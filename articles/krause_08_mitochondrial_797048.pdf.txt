Abstract
Background: Despite being one of the most studied families within the Carnivora, the phylogenetic relationships among the
members of the bear family (Ursidae) have long remained unclear. Widely divergent topologies have been suggested based on
various data sets and methods.
Results: We present a fully resolved phylogeny for ursids based on ten complete mitochondrial genome sequences from all
eight living and two recently extinct bear species, the European cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) and the American giant short-faced
bear (Arctodus simus). The mitogenomic data yield a well-resolved topology for ursids, with the sloth bear at the basal position
within the genus Ursus. The sun bear is the sister taxon to both the American and Asian black bears, and this clade is the sister
clade of cave bear, brown bear and polar bear confirming a recent study on bear mitochondrial genomes.
Conclusion: Sequences from extinct bears represent the third and fourth Pleistocene species for which complete
mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced. Moreover, the cave bear specimen demonstrates that mitogenomic studies can
be applied to Pleistocene fossils that have not been preserved in permafrost, and therefore have a broad application within
ancient DNA research. Molecular dating of the mtDNA divergence times suggests a rapid radiation of bears in both the Old and
New Worlds around 5 million years ago, at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. This coincides with major global changes, such as
the Messinian crisis and the first opening of the Bering Strait, and suggests a global influence of such events on species radiations.

Background
The bear family (Ursidae) is one of the most studied families within the order Carnivora. Members of this family
are present on most continents and occupy a wide range
of ecological niches from the arctic ice shelves to tropical
rainforests (see Additional File 1, Figure S1a). Despite
numerous morphological and molecular studies on the
phylogenetic relationship among Ursidae members, no
consensus exists with regard to either their phylogeny or
their taxonomic nomenclature (Table 1). Most analyses
have concentrated on the eight extant bear species: brown
bear, American black bear, Asian black bear, polar bear,
sun bear, sloth bear, spectacled bear and giant panda (for
species names see Table 1). Molecular studies based on
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from modern bears have
recently provided convincing evidence about several of
the controversial relationships among the bears, such as
the basal positions of the giant panda and the spectacled
bear in the bear tree [1-4] and the position of the polar
bear within the brown bear tree making the later paraphyletic [5,6]. However, molecular studies for a long time
failed to conclusively resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the members of the bear subfamily Ursinae
[5], which includes all living bear species except the giant
panda and the spectacled bear, from here on referred to as
ursine bears. The phylogenetic uncertainty has resulted in
major taxonomic confusion. Based on both morphological and molecular data up to six different genera (Ursus,
Helarctos, Euarctos, Selenartos, Thalarctos and Melursus; i.e.
one for each species) have been suggested for the extant
ursine bears (Table 1).
Recently, a study on mitochondrial genome sequences
(mtDNAs) of all extant bears presented for the first time
an almost completely resolved bear phylogeny with support for most of the problematic nodes in the bear family
tree, except for the position of the sloth bear [4]. This
shows that longer sequences are necessary for reconstructing a robust phylogeny [4,6-9]. Such large data sets also
facilitate the molecular dating of divergence events within
a phylogeny [12-14]. To resolve the relationships between
the extant and extinct members of the bear family and to

date the various divergence events among them, we used
the complete mtDNA (consisting of ~17 kb) from ten different bear species. In addition to three published modern
mtDNAs [10], we amplified and sequenced five modern
bear mtDNAs using a 2-step multiplex PCR approach
[9,16]. We also amplified and sequenced entire mtDNAs
from the extinct European cave bear (Ursus spelaeus),
believed to belong to the ursine bears [11], and the extinct
North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus)
(see Additional File 1, Figure S1b), thought to be related
to the spectacled bear [12].

Results
Sequence retrieval
We retrieved complete mtDNAs from GenBank for three
extant bear species: brown bear, American black bear and
polar bear (GenBank: NC003427, GenBank: NC003428,
GenBank: NC003426). For the remaining five living bear
species, we sequenced the entire mtDNA in overlapping
fragments using a 2-step multiplex PCR approach [7] and
a mixture of direct sequencing and sequencing multiple
EMBL:FM177761,
clones
(EMBL:FM177759,
EMBL:FM177763, EMBL:FM177764, EMBL:FM177765).
We also obtained the complete mtDNA from the extinct
European cave bear using a 44,000 year old bone found in
Gamssulzen Cave, Austria. Again, we used a 2-step multiplex approach, but in this case, all PCR products were
cloned and multiple clones were sequenced
(EMBL:FM177760). Moreover, to ensure sequence accuracy, we determined each sequence position from at least
two independent primary PCRs [13]. When we observed a
discrepancy between the consensus sequences from each
of the two amplifications we performed a third amplification and used the consensus sequence from all three
amplifications (see Additional File 1). We used the same
approach to sequence the extinct American giant shortfaced bear mtDNA, using a 22,000 year-old calcaneum
bone from Eldorado Creek, Canada (EMBL:FM177762).
In order to further ascertain that the results obtained are
reproducible, samples of both extinct bears were
extracted, amplified and sequenced each in an additional
laboratory that did not have access to the results obtained

in Leipzig. For the cave bear a total of 3,520 bp were independently reproduced in Cambridge and for the American
giant short-faced bear a total of 395 bp was replicated in
the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA in Adelaide. The
consensus sequences for all fragments determined in
Cambridge were identical to those determined in Leipzig.
The replicated fragments at the Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA were identical to the sequence obtained in
Leipzig except for a single deletion close to the 5'-end of
the light strand in the first fragment. The sequence for this
fragment was obtained by direct sequencing in just one 5'
to 3' direction on the light strand. Given that sequence
accuracy immediately downstream the sequencing primer
is low, it is likely that this deletion represents a sequencing
artifact.
Phylogenetic analyses
All ten bear mtDNAs were aligned using the harbor seal
(Phoca vitulina) mtDNA as outgroup. Phylogenetic trees
were reconstructed using maximum parsimony (MP),
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference. We
recovered the same topology using all above-mentioned
optimality criteria (Figure 1 and Table 2). Our results confirm the giant panda's basal position in the bear phylogeny [1-4,14-17] and also place the spectacled bear outside
ursine bears. In contrast to previous studies our data was
sufficient to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among
ursine bears with statistical support for all nodes. The
sloth bear falls basal to all other ursine bears, which form
a monophyletic group with 85%, 93%, and 100% support
(MP symmetric resampling, ML bootstrap, and 1.00 Bayesian posterior probability (PP), respectively). The hypothesis suggesting that the sloth bear is basal to the sun bear
and black bear clade (hypothesis 6, see Additional File 1,
Figure S2) did not have a significantly worse likelihood
(AU test, p = 0.147) than the topology favored by our data

Unpartitioned and partitioned phylogenetic analyses in maximum
parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference of
phylogeny. In partitioned analyses every partition was allowed to
evolve under a separate unlinked GTR+Γ substitution model and
distinct base frequencies in ML and Bayesian inference of phylogeny.

(sloth bear as the most basal ursine bear; hypothesis 9, see
Additional File 1, Figure S2) although it had a slightly
higher homoplasy index and a less parsimonious tree
(HIbest = 0.389, HIcompeting = 0.393; TLbest = 10092, TLcompeting = 10157). In a MP analysis, however, this hypothesis
(hypothesis 6, see Additional File 1, Figure S2) received
significantly less support (Wilcoxon signed-ranks and sign
tests, p < 10-4). Thus, we suggest that ursine bears are separated into two sister clades, comprised of three species
each with the sloth bear forming the basal branch. The
first clade contains cave, brown, and polar bears and is
supported by all methods. The second clade is composed
of the sun and black bears (American and Asian) and
receives varying support values, depending on the tree
reconstruction method (76% MP symmetric resampling,
97% ML bootstrap, and 1.00 Bayesian PP). Finally, the
placement of the extinct American giant short-faced bear
as a sister taxon to the spectacled bear is supported in all
analyses (100% bootstrap/symmetric resampling and
1.00 PP in all analyses).
The phylogenetic reconstruction makes evident a difficulty in resolving the relationships within ursine bears. As
a matter of fact, most of the internal branches are very
short. This observation (Fig. 2) makes it likely that individual genes (or short sequences) may exhibit different
tree topologies, as shown for humans, chimpanzees and
gorillas [18]. In our case, we notice that individual loci of
the mtDNA support different topologies. Genes such as
12S rRNA, ND4L, ND5, and ND3 exhibited phylogenetic
incongruence with two to four other mitochondrial genes
(ILD test, p ≤ 0.05). The highest amount of phylogenetic
conflict emerged from partitioning the mtDNA to individual genes and the tRNAs of the two strands (tRNA- and
tRNA+), but only two nodes showed evidence of hidden
conflict in a MP setting (node t3 HBS = -10, node t5 HBS =
-5). Emerging support was evident for all terminal nodes
including the ursine branching point (HBS range: 7–21).
Intra-ursine nodes t5, t8, and t9 were the only nodes to
show <100% replicate-based support values, a fact that
may be owed to the lack of consistent support provided by
those genes (PHBS range: -1 to -7).
Estimation of divergence times
We used several fossil calibration points to estimate the
mtDNA divergence dates within the bears (see Materials
and Methods). The posterior mean of the divergence time
between bears and the harbor seal was estimated at 36
million years ago (Ma), which agrees with previous estimates based on both molecular and paleontological data
[12,19]. However, due to the wide uniform priors we used
for the calibration points, the confidence interval (26.5–
47.4 Ma, Table 3) remains large, depending on the type of
analysis. The initial divergence within bears occurred
between the giant panda and all remaining bears, esti-

mated to have happened between 17.9 and 22.1 Ma
(range of posterior means across analyses). The next divergence was that of the New World spectacled bear group,
which separated from the main ursine bear lineage about
12.4 to 15.6 Ma. The posterior mean divergence of the two
New World species, the extant spectacled and the extinct
American giant short-faced bear, was estimated to have
happened between 5.3 and 7 Ma. Within the remaining
ursine bears, the estimated divergence times all show
overlapping confidence intervals, except for those within
the brown bear clade.
Within the brown bear clade, we dated the divergence
event between the cave and brown bear mtDNA to 2.4–

3.1 Ma. The origin of the polar bear is more difficult to
determine, as partial mtDNA sequences suggest that polar
bears actually fall within the genetic diversity spectrum of
brown bears [20,21], where they constitute a monophyletic clade closely related to a clade of brown bears
from the ABC Islands in Alaska. Unfortunately, the published brown bear mtDNA [10] does not originate from
this ABC Island clade, and therefore our estimated divergence for polar bears and brown bears is not a minimum
date for this event, but rather the divergence date for different brown bear clades. As a consequence, the estimated
divergence date of 2.7 and 1.3 Ma for brown and polar
bears obtained in two recent studies [4,19] using the same
complete mtDNAs should be interpreted with care. A

around the Miocene- Pliocene boundary.

mtDNA from an ABC island brown bear will be required
to date the actual speciation event of polar bears more
accurately.
We also examined whether more sequence data would
improve our estimates on divergence times by plotting the
posterior means of divergence times against the width of
their corresponding 95% credibility interval (see Additional File 1, Figure S3), following Yang and Rannala [22].

We found significant correlations for both the unpartitioned and partitioned datasets (p < 2.2 × 10-16). This linear relationship strongly suggests that longer sequences or
more taxa than those examined here are unlikely to
increase the precision of the divergence time estimates.
Therefore, in order to narrow the confidence intervals for
the divergence date estimates within the bear phylogeny,
more precisely dated fossil calibration points would be
required.

The estimated substitution rate of approximately 10-8 substitutions/site/year was more similar to a mitogenomic
dataset from primates than to the rate from extant and
extinct proboscideans [9]. This evolutionary rate was also
higher than that for parts of the nuclear IRBP gene in bears
(0.139 × 10-8 substitutions/site/year; [17]).

Discussion
Our study represents the first comprehensive sampling of
mtDNAs for recent bears, including all living and two
recently extinct bear species. The cave bear and the American giant short-faced bear are the third and fourth Pleistocene species for which mtDNAs have been determined.
Moreover, the cave bear genome is the first determined
from a Pleistocene sample obtained from a non-permafrost environment. Compared to the extinct moas from
which complete mtDNAs have previously been determined from non-permafrost specimens [23], the cave bear
genome extends the time frame by an order of magnitude,
showing that complete mtDNA analysis can be performed
using a wide range of samples. As is common in large scale
ancient DNA analyses [7,9,24], we found a number of
consistent differences between independent primary
PCRs, all of which were either C to T or G to A substitutions (see Additional File 1). This confirms previous
reports that deamination of cytosine is one of the most
common, and probably the only type of miscoding lesion
in ancient DNA [13,24-26]. Moreover, the high number of
consistent substitutions (81) observed in the cave bear
genome sequences shows that each sequence position
needs to be replicated when performing such large scale
analyses.

This analysis has allowed the phylogenetic topology of the
bear family to be resolved with high support values. Interestingly, it places the sloth bear basal to all other ursine
bear species and the sun bear in a sister group related to
the two black bear species. The latter observation coincides with paleontological information [27] and previous
mtDNA studies [4,17,21]. An earlier study analysing six
mtDNA fragments, also placed the sloth bear basal to all
other members of the ursine bears [3]. However, this
study found weak support for the sun bear as being basal
to the brown bear – polar bear clade rather than to the two
black bear species.
The phylogenetic reconstruction also reveals the reasons
for previous problems in resolving the relationships
among ursine bears, as most of the internal branches for
their phylogenetic tree are very short. Such a short internal
branch structure (Figure 1) makes it likely that individual
nuclear genes (or short sequences) may exhibit different
tree topologies, as shown for nuclear loci from humans,
chimpanzees and gorillas [18]. Furthermore it was previously shown that despite being a non-recombining single
genetic locus, individual genes on the mtDNA might produce different tree topologies [6,8,9,18].
The mitogenomic data also has implications for bear taxonomy. Six ursine bears and the sloth bear are monophyletic with absolute support, which agrees with Hall
and Nowak's inclusion (Table 1) of the Asian black bear,
American black bear, sun bear, polar bear and brown bear
within the genus Ursus [28,29] and confirms the mitogenomic study by Yu et al [4]. Given the short divergence

time of the six ursine bears and the sloth bear we suggest,
following Hall 1981, Nowak 1991 and Yu et al 2007
[4,28,29], that the sloth bear is grouped together with the
other ursine bears in the genus Ursus and that the other
genus names previously suggested for members of this
radiation are discarded (Table 1).
Using this data set and multiple fossil calibration points,
we have dated the various mtDNA divergence events during bear evolution with reasonable confidence. Strikingly,
the divergence of the giant panda is estimated at about 19
Ma (95% HPD: 14.4–24.8 Ma, HPD: highest posterior
density). This estimate is much earlier than previously
reported for the divergence of the panda lineage from the
Ursavus lineage based on teeth morphology of Agriarctos
fossils (12–15 Ma) [30]. The latter divergence date has
been used in several studies as a calibration point for dating bear radiations [2,4,35]. We decided not to use this
date as a calibration point, since the oldest known panda
fossil, Ailuropoda microta, is less than 2.4 million years old
[31], and therefore allows no inference about the date of
divergence of this lineage. Moreover, the fossil record for
both Ailuropoda and its potential ancestral species from
the genus Agriarctos is sparse, making an early Miocene
divergence date for the giant panda's lineage plausible.
Interestingly, the next divergence event is not until 13 Ma
(spectacled and American giant short-faced bear) followed by a gap until 6 Ma when a rapid radiation occurs.
The American giant short-faced and spectacled bears
diverged around 5.7 Ma, and the five ursine lineages
diverged between 5.4 and 4.1 Ma (posterior mean age estimates) (Figures 1 and 2).
Thus, taking the confidence intervals for the molecular
dating into account, seven lineages radiated between 3.7
and 7 Ma. Such rapid radiations are also observed in other
mammals, such as the cats [32] and procyonids [33], as
well as in bird families like the woodpeckers [34]. Strikingly, the major radiation wave for these families also
occurred at the end of the Miocene. In combination with
the fossil record, the mtDNA divergence estimates suggest
that the rapid radiation of the bear family around the
Miocene-Pliocene boundary followed a major extinction
of some of the main bear genera such as Ursavus, Indarctos,
Agriotherium, and the Hemicyoninae (Figure 2). Similar
species turnover events were also observed for other mammals over a limited time span near the Miocene-Pliocene
boundary resulting in a massive extinction of more than
60–70% of all Eurasian genera and 70–80% of North
American genera [35]. The cause of this widespread species turnover during this time period remains unclear.
Some studies suggest that the initial opening of the Bering
Strait at the beginning of the Pliocene around 5.3 Ma
caused a major separation of northern hemisphere habitats [36]. Major climatic changes occurred during that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/220

time, such as the Messinian crisis during which the Mediterranean Sea lost its connection to the world ocean system and became desiccated [37]. These changes resulted
in forest cover decline and the spread of arid habitats in
Northern America and Eurasia [38,39] as well as a global
increase in C4 biomass [40]. During that time, open grassland habitats, which were exploited by an entirely new
suite of mammals [40], replaced the earlier less seasonal
woodland forest habitats. Thus, it is possible that the environmental changes associated with the Miocene-Pliocene
boundary and the following emergence of new ecological
niches such as open grasslands caused an adaptive radiation in Old and New World bears similar to a number of
other species groups [34]. This could explain the divergence of the Tremarctinae with the spectacled bear adapted
to closed habitats and the American giant short-faced
bears being predators dwelling in open habitats [12,27].
The latter adaptation was also described in other predator
species that evolved around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary and were built for hunting in open habitats such as the
cats [32,35]. Other events such as the opening of the Bering Strait could have additionally promoted allopatric
speciation in black bears. Our divergence time estimates
suggest that the American black bear could have spread to
America before the Bering Strait opened around 5.3 Ma
[36]. An early migration of ursine bears into the Americas
is also supported by the oldest known Ursus fossil in
North America, Ursus abstrusus [41], which was dated at
4.3 Ma, suggesting that U. abstrusus may be ancestral to the
American black bear lineage.
Obviously, the Miocene-Pliocene global changes had a
major impact on the radiation of bears and other species,
both between and within the Old and New Worlds. It is
interesting to note that African apes experienced a similar
species turnover at the end of the Miocene, including the
divergence of the chimpanzee and human lineages [42].
This latter event has been attributed to a magnified climatic variability starting at the end of the Miocene [43].
More studies are necessary to address the relationships
between global changes and species radiations at the
beginning of the Pliocene. Our results strongly support
the idea of a major wave of bear radiations during that
time.
Our data also indicate a much earlier divergence for the
cave bear and brown bear lineages than those previously
assumed, with a mean estimate at 2.8 Ma. This date agrees
with recent results suggesting the existence of representatives of the brown bear lineage in Europe as early as 1.5
Ma (G. Rabeder, personal observation). Nevertheless, it
questions other studies suggesting a later divergence time
for this species pair at around 1.2–1.4 Ma based on the
fossil record [27] and molecular data [44]. Loreille et al.
[44], however, used Taberlet & Bouvet's estimated diver-

gence date for the two European brown bear lineages
(Western and Eastern) of 850 ka [45], which in turn was
based on an application of Vigilant et al.'s [46] intraspecific human rate of 8.4 × 10-8 substitutions/site/year –
Taberlet & Bouvet cautioned that their estimates could be
prone to uncertainty as they imported a human evolutionary rate. Given recent reports of problems in estimated
intraspecific divergence times based on interspecific calibrations and vice versa, the implicit use of indirectly
extrapolated evolutionary rates is not recommended
[51,52].
Most of the youngest fossils for Ursus etruscus, the
assumed ancestor of the cave and brown bear, have been
dated to 2–2.7 Ma [47], suggesting that a late divergence
for the two lineages around 1.2 Ma is rather unlikely.
These dates also partially overlap with the divergence date
we obtained (range of posterior means across methods:
2.4–3.1 Ma). A greater number of reliably dated fossils
from early members of both the cave bear and brown bear
lineages are necessary to date the divergence of U. spelaeus.
However, around 2.8 Ma, the climate again changed dramatically with the onset of the first major cooling events
and climatic oscillations at the end of the Pliocene that
eventually led to the Pleistocene glaciations [48]. Thus, if
bear speciation events were influenced by climate change,
cave bears and brown bears may indeed have separated as
early as 2.8 Ma.

Conclusion
Using complete mitochondrial genome sequences from
both extinct and extant bears, we found evidence for a
rapid radiation of bears at the Miocene – Pliocene Boundary 5–6 million years ago within the Old and New worlds.
As rapid radiations were also observed in other species
groups around this time [37-39], we suggest that climate
change played an important role during bear evolution
and animal speciation in general.
Our results clearly demonstrate the power of mitogenomic analyses for resolving complicated phylogenetic
relationships among both extant and extinct species,
using samples obtained not only from permafrost, but
also from non-permafrost environments.

Methods
Ancient and modern DNA samples
The modern DNA samples of the Asian black bear, sloth
bear and sun bear were obtained from DNA stocks held at
the National Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Genomic
Diversity in Frederick, Maryland (USA). The DNA samples
of the giant panda and spectacled bear were obtained
from the National Fish & Wildlife Forensic Lab in Ashland, Oregon (USA).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/220

In Leipzig, cave bear DNA was extracted from 640 mg of
bone powder taken from a femur found in Gamssulzen
cave (Austria) that was dated to 44.160 +1.400/-1.190 BP
(KIA 25287). The extraction was performed as described
previously [49], yielding 70 μl of DNA extract. In Cambridge, 500 mg of cave bear bone was extracted using the
same protocol as in Leipzig. Details for the American giant
short-faced bear DNA extraction performed in the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA can be found in Additional
File 1.
Multiplex amplification and sequencing
Primer pairs were designed by aligning the three published mtDNAs of brown bear, polar bear and American
black bear [10], and partial mtDNAs from various bear
species retrieved from GenBank. The revised Cambridge
reference sequence for the human mtDNA [50] was also
included in the alignment. For the primers, regions were
chosen that are highly conserved among bears, but carry
substitutions compared to the modern human sequence,
to minimize the risk of human contamination. As previously described for the 2-step multiplex protocol [7,51],
the primer pairs for the first and second step were divided
into two sets, ODD and EVEN, to avoid amplifying the
overlapping fragments between adjacent products. The
two primer sets were used in separate 2-step multiplex
PCRs, as previously described [7]. The first amplification
step was performed in a total volume of 20 μl. Each reaction contained a final concentration of 1x PCR-buffer, 4
mM MgCl2, 250 μM of each dNTP, 150 nM of each primer
from one set and 2 U AmpliTaq® Gold DNA polymerase
plus 5 μl of the DNA extract. PCRs were initiated by exposure to 94°C for 9 min, followed by 25 cycles of 20 s at
94°C, 30 s at 52°C and 1 min at 72°C. At the end, a final
4-min extension at 72°C was performed. This amplification was then diluted 40 fold and 5 μl of the dilution were
used as a template in each of the single amplification reactions. Reagent concentrations were as described above,
except that a single primer pair was used at a concentration of 1.5 μM for each primer, and only 0.5 U of DNA
polymerase were used in each reaction. The PCR temperature profile was the same as in the first amplification step.
Amplification products of the correct size for the two
extinct bears were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen), and a minimum of three clones were
sequenced on an ABI3730 capillary sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). For the modern samples, PCR products were
either sequenced from both directions, or multiple clones
were sequenced to ensure sequence accuracy. Primers for
fragments that gave no product in the first amplification
attempts were redesigned if the adjacent fragments
showed substitutions in the primer site. The resulting
primers were then used to amplify the remaining segments of the bear genomes. For the two extinct bear species, each position of the mtDNA was amplified at least

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:220

twice from independent primary amplifications to ensure
the authenticity of the sequence [13]. For the cave bear a
nested primer design was chosen where the primers in the
singleplex amplification are shifted inwards compared to
the primers used in the multiplex step. This design ensures
specificity of the singleplex PCR and reduces the risk of
contamination of the multiplex PCR since only products
from the singleplex reaction are amplified to high copy
numbers [51]. All primer sequences used can be found in
Additional File 1. For the sequenced modern bears and
the cave bear primer sets EVEN and ODD are comprised
of 20 primer pairs each. A single primer pair, EVEN21,
spanning a repeat region within the D-loop, was excluded
from both sets and only used in singleplex PCRs. For the
Giant short faced-bear 81 primer pairs were designed in
total and split into two sets; all amplification attempts
spanning the repeat region within the D-loop for the
American giant short-faced bear failed.
In Cambridge, amplifications were completed using the
same PCR conditions as in Leipzig, but with a reduced
number of primer pairs. Both water controls and an
extraction control consisting of a mammoth DNA extract
were negative for cave bear-specific products. Eighteen
amplification products, originating from independent
primary PCRs, were sequenced in both directions for 9 different fragments distributed throughout the whole
mtDNA. A total of 3,520 bp were amplified and
sequenced. The consensus sequences for all fragments
were identical to the corresponding sequences produced
in Leipzig.
For the American giant short-faced bear in total 395 bp of
the mtDNA were replicated in two fragments at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA. Details can be found in
Additional File 1.
Mitochondrial genome sequence alignment and
annotation
The newly sequenced mtDNAs for the two extinct and five
extant bear species, as well as the four publicly available
genomes (three bears and a harbor seal) were aligned in
MUSCLE 3.6 using the default parameters [52]. The Dloop was removed for all analyses, as it is too variable for
interspecific comparisons and could partially not be
determined from the American short-faced bear. We
employed nine sequence data partitioning schemes in the
following order: the transcription process; the three
codon positions on each strand, the tRNAs on each strand
and the rRNA genes. A few nucleotides were duplicated in
the partitioned dataset because of the overlap of some
loci, and a small number of non coding nucleotides were
excluded. The annotation was completed using the program DOGMA [53] and modified manually to avoid overlap of tRNA and protein-coding genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/220

Phylogenetic analyses
The substitution model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion on all models available in the baseml
program of PAML 3.15 [54]. For both the partitioned and
the unpartitioned datasets, the GTR+Γ [55-57] was found
to be the best-fit model. This model was used in all subsequent analyses unless specified otherwise.

The phylogeny of the mtDNAs was reconstructed using a
thorough maximum parsimony (MP) search that is implemented in TNT [58], with 500 random-addition
sequences and a variety of tree space exploration techniques. We also employed maximum likelihood (ML) in
RAxML 2.2.3 [59], as well as a Bayesian inference (BI) of
phylogeny in MrBayes 3.1.2 [60]. The GTR+Γ4 substitution model was used for both ML and BI analyses. Phylogenetic support was provided with 1000 bootstrap
pseudoreplicates in ML and 5,000 replicates of symmetric
resampling in MP. MrBayes was run twice for 3 million
generations with a burn-in of 2,500 steps. For details, see
Additional File 1.
Incongruence between individual partitions was evaluated in an MP framework employing variations of Bremer
support measures, as implemented in Automated Simultaneous Analysis of Phylogenies [61], as well as with the
ILD test [62]. Agreement or disagreement between individual partitions at each node in the mtDNA tree was
expressed through positive and negative hidden branch
support (HBS) values, respectively [63]. See Additional
File 1 for further details.
Contrasting alternative phylogenetic hypotheses
We collected 10 alternative topologies on the phylogenetic relationships of bears from the available literature
(see Additional File 1, Figure S2) and compared them in
an ML framework using the approximately unbiased test
(AU) [64] in CONSEL [65], along with a comparison of
homoplasy indices and tree lengths.
Estimation of divergence times
Dating of the divergence events within bears was done
using a molecular clock approach and several fossil calibration points. The minimum for the divergence of bears
and seals was set to 33.9 Ma, based on the fossil species
Parictis montanus [66] and Parictis parvus [67] both dated
to 38–33.9 Ma, and the first well-described members on
the bear lineage. As a second calibration point, the minimum age for the oldest described Ursus fossils, U. minimus
and U. ruscinensis, at 4.2 Ma [47] was used, and the maximum for the youngest fossils from the genus Ursavus, U.
depereti and U. ehrenbergi, which gave rise to the Ursus lineage [11], at 7.1 Ma [47].

The above mentioned calibration points were used as priors to obtain the posterior distribution of the estimated
divergence times. Evolutionary rate constancy according
to a molecular clock for all bear mtDNAs, including the
harbor seal outgroup, was tested using a likelihood ratio
test (LRT) in baseml [68]. The assumption of a molecular
clock at the 1% level under a GTR+Γ model for the whole
mtDNA alignment excluding the D-loop for the partitioned (-2δL = 14.3, p = 0.112) and unpartitioned (-2δL =
18.0, p = 0.036) dataset could not be rejected.
We estimated divergence times using two Bayesian
approaches implemented in the programs mcmctree [54]
and BEAST 1.4.4 [69]. Mcmctree was run using the
HKY85+Γ8 substitution model [57,70], the most parameter-rich model available in this program. A total of 105
generations were sampled every 5 steps after discarding
104 initial steps as burn-in. The more parameter-rich
model GTR+Γ4 was used in BEAST with the following priors: Yule speciation prior on the tree, siteModel.alpha
(initial = 0.2, exponential prior with mean 1.0 and 95%
CI of 0.05129–2.996), clock.rate (initial = 0.015, uniform
prior of 0–10), root.height of ursine bear clade (uniform
prior of 7.1–4.2 Ma based on the basal ursine bear radiation fossil data). Thirty million Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) steps were sampled every 1,000 generations. Convergence was assessed in Tracer v1.3 [71] after
excluding the first 5 million samples as burn-in. All effective sample size values exceeded 20,000, suggesting a sufficient run length. The strict clock was implemented in all
divergence time estimations, as suggested by the LRT.
