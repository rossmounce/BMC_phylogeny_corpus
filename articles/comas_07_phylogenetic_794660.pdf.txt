Abstract
Background: A comprehensive evolutionary analysis of bacterial genomes implies to identify the
hallmark of vertical and non-vertical signals and to discriminate them from the presence of mere
phylogenetic noise. In this report we have addressed the impact of factors like the universal
distribution of the genes, their essentiality or their functional role in the cell on the inference of
vertical signal through phylogenomic methods.
Results: We have established that supermatrices derived from data sets composed mainly by
genes suspected to be essential for bacterial cellular life perform better on the recovery of vertical
signal than those composed by widely distributed genes. In addition, we show that the
"Transcription" category of genes seems to harbor a better vertical signal than other functional
categories. Moreover, the "Poorly characterized" category performs better than other categories
related with metabolism or cellular processes.
Conclusion: From these results we conclude that different data sets allow addressing different
questions in phylogenomic analyses. The vertical signal seems to be more present in essential genes
although these also include a significant degree of incongruence. From a functional perspective, as
expected, informational genes perform better than operational ones but we have also shown the
surprising behavior of poorly annotated genes, which points to their importance in the genome
evolution of bacteria.

Background
The genomes of bacteria harbor different evolutionary signals as the result of the different evolutionary processes
that act upon them. As a consequence, the information
encoded in these genomes can be divided into three main
categories: vertical signals, non-vertical signals and phylogenetic noise. The reconstruction of bacterial evolution
and the appraisal of the different forces that have shaped

their genomes depend on the disentangling of these signals.
The vertical signal is associated to the transmission of
genetic information from ancestors to descendants. From
a genomic perspective, this signal resides in the set of true
orthologs shared by microbial genomes. The non-vertical
signal arises as the result of evolutionary processes that do

not involve the immediate ancestors as donors of genetic
material. The two most common processes at a genome
scale level originating this signal are duplications and horizontal gene transfers. Paralogs are those genes resulting
from a process of duplication. After their origin, paralogs
may have different fates from neo or sub-functionalization to extinction through gene disintegration [1].
Xenologs are genes horizontally transmitted from a nonrelative of the recipient genome [2,3]. The existence of
horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms is known
from quite long ago [4] and is currently recognized as one
of the main processes influencing the evolution of bacteria [5,6]. The term synologs denotes the presence of more
than one homolog within a genome regardless of the origin of the duplicate copies (paralogy or xenology) [7].
Lastly, phylogenetic noise could have different sources
and embrace cases of insufficient phylogenetic signal or
complex evolutionary patterns that limit phylogenetic
inference [8].

results with information encoded in protein coding genes
[18]. Firstly, because the evolutionary scenario derived
from gene trees is often incongruent with that of 16S
rDNA and, secondly, because the evolution of one gene
does not necessarily reflect the vertical signal of the whole
genome. Current works are taking advantage of the relatively recent development of phylogenomic methodologies [19-21]. Two of the most common approaches are the
supermatrix and supertrees analyses. A supermatrix is created by the concatenation of multiple partitions, usually
genes in this phylogenomic context. It has the potential of
adding up the individual phylogenetic signals with the
aim of recovering the main one. The supertree approach
uses an alternative route: instead of analyzing all the partitions in a single analysis it recovers the gene trees of the
individual genes and generates a tree (supertree) [22,23].
This supertree is a summary of the underlying source trees
and it is supposed to be the most compatible topology for
all of them.

In principle, it could be expected that the largest group of
genes in bacteria belong to the vertical category [9,10].
Most of the genome is vertically inherited every generation, although the most important innovations seem to be
acquired as the result of horizontal transfer events [11]
and, to a lesser degree, of duplications [12]. However, the
exact fraction of genes belonging to each category is variable among different groups, even species, and difficult to
assess. In fact, there is disagreement about the extent to
which non-vertical processes, mainly lateral gene transfers, influence the inference of genome phylogenies and
the existence of a species tree for bacteria. If the rate of lateral gene transfer is high, then a phylogeny that relies on
ancestor-descendant relationships will not be able to
reflect the evolution of bacterial genomes that might be
described better by means of networks [13]. However, if
this rate is low enough then we will be able to represent
bacterial evolution as a tree and not as a network [14]. In
their extreme version, these two positions deny the importance of the vertical or the non-vertical signals, respectively. Only those studies capable of reporting both
signals and measuring the possible influence of phylogenetic noise will be addressing properly the evolution of
bacterial genomes.

On the other hand, not only the phylogenomic methodology is important but also the data set to which it is
applied is of relevance. The nature of the genes that compose the data set to be analyzed can have a direct incidence on the phylogeny recovered and on the
phylogenetic signals contained therein [24]. From any
genome, which is composed by a mixture of signals, different subsets can be derived. The term 'minimal genome'
has been used to describe the set of genes that are supposed to be essential for a self-sustainable cell live [25].
There is no single, unique minimal genome and several
proposals have been put forward [25,26]. However, a
recent review of different approaches has proposed a synthesis of 206 genes as the minimal genome needed for cellular life [27]. It is expected that these genes, most of them
characterized by their essentiality and their central role in
the metabolic network, encode a good, vertical signal in
agreement with the complexity hypothesis [28,29].

In traditional phylogenetic analysis different molecules
have been proposed to be good, reliable markers of bacterial evolution. However, the most widely used method
has been the analysis of 16S rDNA, which was demonstrated to contain a good vertical signal and able to
recover accurate phylogenies at different phylogenetic levels [15,16]. Currently, this is still the most widely used
tool in bacterial taxonomy [17]. However, the availability
of a growing number of complete bacterial genomes is
confirming the necessity of verification of 16S rDNA

Nevertheless, essentiality is not the only factor that could
influence the presence of vertical signal in a set of genes.
It is also important that these genes are shared by all the
taxa analyzed due to restrictions in the applicability of
some phylogenomic methods [30]. Consequently, a core
of genes suitable for the phylogenomic analysis can be
defined by the universality of their presence in all the
genomes considered. The universality of this core is, in
consequence, another factor to consider in the analysis of
the evolutionary vertical signal of bacterial genomes.
In this work, we have centered on how to identify and
extract the vertical signal from a real data set of bacterial
genomes in the presence of incongruence. We have performed experiments to analyze the performance of two
phylogenomic methods, supermatrix and supertrees, on

the inference of vertical signals. We have chosen 21 Proteobacteria genomes and have worked with the corresponding putative orthologs of the 579 protein coding
genes of Blochmannia floridanus, a γ-Proteobacteria endosymbiont of carpenter ants [31]. In a previous work
(Comas et al., submitted) we derived a reference tree (RT)
for these genomes, which was supposed to grasp the vertical relationship among the species. This tree allowed us to
test the presence of incongruence by comparing the RT to
each gene tree. In this context, by incongruence we mean
the presence of non-vertical signals or phylogenetic noise
in the set of genes to be used in phylogenetic/phylogenomic analysis although how to address the source(s) of
such incongruence is out of the scope of this paper. However, we study the effect of the presence of incongruence
in the performance of the two phylogenomic methodologies mentioned above and address several points about
the phylogenetic signal contained in the different functional categories and the role of essentiality and universality in the correct inference of vertical evolution.

posal of a minimum number of genes for a self-sustainable cell by Gil et al. [27] and composed what we called the
'essential' core, whose genes not only are universally distributed but also suspected to have an essential functional
role. The distinction is important because minimal
genome proposals take into account not only essential
genes but also genes whose function could be replaced by
other, alternative genes not included in the proposal.
However, those genes included in 'minimal genome' proposals which have a universal distribution are probably
essential genes.

Results

Our first approximation to the problem of analyzing the
vertical signal of these genomes consisted in comparing
the performance of the 'universal' and 'essential' cores in
a supermatrix analysis. We generated 100 random concatenates of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 genes for each core
and analyzed their corresponding phylogenetic trees. Figure 1 summarizes the results of two metrics to evaluate the
efficiency of each data set in recovering a reference tree
(RT) congruent with current taxonomical classification of
the species analyzed.

The first step in a phylogenomic analysis is to obtain a
reliable data set of putative orthologs for the genomes
being considered. In this case, we searched for putative
orthologs of the 579 protein coding genes of the Blochmannia floridanus genome in 20 additional Proteobacteria
genomes (Table 1). The search identified 200 protein coding common genes which composed what we called the
'universal' core, thus characterized by (quasi)universal
genes. Of these, 133 genes were coincident with the pro-

The 'essential' core performed better than the 'universal'
core. The 'essential' core recovered the reference tree in all
60-genes concatenates generated, whereas the 'universal'
core with 60 genes concatenated only yielded a null Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance to the reference tree in 41 of
the 100 concatenates. In addition, the mean topological
distance reflected the differences between the two data
sets. The average initial topological distances were 3.56

and 2.62 for the 'universal' and the 'essential' core concatenates, respectively. The behavior of the distance metric
when the number of genes in the concatenates increased
from 10 to 60 genes reflected very different dynamics for
the two core sets. While the 'essential' core concatenates
reduced the distance to the RT as more genes were added,
the 'universal' core increased the gap as more genes were
incorporated in the concatenates. The final value obtained
for the 60-genes concatenates reflected this clear discrepancy: concatenates for the 'essential' core had RF distances
of zero, since all of them recovered the reference tree,
while the average distance of 60-genes concatenates from
the 'universal' core was 5.78. The difference in the performance between these two data sets must reside, at least
to a certain extent, in the 67 genes present in the 'universal' core and absent from the 'essential' core. In consequence, we included this subset of 67 genes in subsequent
analyses and denoted it as 'non-essential' core.
When the complete sets of genes in the 'universal' and
'essential' cores were used to obtain the corresponding
concatenates, the maximum likelihood trees showed

identical topology to the reference tree (RF distance = 0).
The same analysis with the 'non-essential' core resulted in
a topology with RF distance = 4 to the reference tree, due
to the unresolved position of Xanthomonadales at the
base of the tree (not shown).
Once the overall phylogenetic signal in the 'universal' and
'essential' cores had been evaluated, we proceeded to
study the relationship between functional assignment of
the genes and performance of the phylogenomics methods described. Table 2 shows the description of each functional category whereas Figure 2 shows the contribution
in percentage of each category to each data set. As
expected, both the 'universal' and 'essential' cores had an
enriched fraction of the informational categories while
other categories had almost disappeared. In this analysis
we were interested in comparing the 'universal' and the
'essential' core and also the 'Blochmannia' core, for which
we had to introduce a supertree analysis, since in the latter
the unequal number of sequences in the 579 multiple
alignments prevented the application of a concatenate
analysis. Also, due to the small number of genes present

in the 'non-essential' core in the different functional categories considered, we did not include this subset in this
analysis.
A summary of the supertree and concatenate analyses is
shown in Figure 3. Overall, the K ('Transcription') and the
J ('Translation') categories, both related to information
processes, presented the best vertical signal. For the transcription category both supermatrix and supertree
approaches recovered the RT of the 'universal' and 'essential' cores as did the supertree method when applied to the
'Blochmannia' core subset. The reference tree was recovered from the subset of genes in the 'Translation' category
only in the supermatrix analysis for the 'universal' and
'essential' cores, but neither in the supertree nor in the
'Blochmannia' core. The other informational category,
related to replication (L), did not recover the RT in any
case. The supertree derived from all the individual trees of
informational genes always recovered the RT as shown in
Figure 4. In the remaining categories, the RT was obtained
only in a few cases. For the general categories, only the
'Blochmannia' core subset of 'Cellular processes' recovered the RT in the supertree analysis. Among the additional specific functional categories, only genes related to
posttranslational modification (category O), like chaperones, seemed to retain a good vertical signal. However,
two cases grabbed our attention: on the one hand, the two

concatenates derived from the 'Cell motility and secretion'
(N) category recovered the RT; on the other hand, the general function (R) category also behaved well in the concatenate analysis.
For a more detailed quantitative analysis, we also analyzed the topological distance of the concatenate trees
derived from each of these categories to the RT. Figure 4
shows the distances from the maximum likelihood-based
phylogenies obtained with the concatenates derived from
the 'universal' and 'essential' cores. The general category
with the shortest distances to the RT was that of informational genes whereas the others had higher distances,
above all the metabolism category. Surprisingly, the second category with shortest distance to the RT was that of
'poorly characterized' genes which comprises those of
'General function' (R) and 'Unknown function' (S). In
fact, a detailed analysis of the more specific categories
showed that the R category was the main contributor to
the short distance of the general category, recovering the
RT tree in both data sets. Meanwhile, categories G ('Carbohydrate transport and metabolism') and T ('Signal
transduction mechanisms') presented the largest distances among specific categories. On the other side, categories O and N that were identified with good vertical
signal were the two categories, apart from the informational, with shortest distances with respect to the RT.

Finally, we analyzed the performance of the individual
gene trees in the different data sets for recovering the reference tree topology. The results were very similar for the
'universal', the 'essential' and the 'non-essential' cores,
with average RF distance values of 12.19, 12.00 and 12.57,
respectively. This statistic was not computable for the 'Blochmannia' core as the number of sequences varies among
the 579 individual gene trees considered. The results of
the SH tests, at α = 0.05, for each gene tree revealed a rejection rate of 29.5%, 29%, 27% and 34.3% for the 'Blochmannia', the 'universal', the 'essential' and the 'nonessential' cores, respectively (Table 2). The same analyses
were carried out taking into account the functional assignment of the genes. Only those genes of the K ('transcription') category present in the 'universal' and 'essential'
core data sets showed a significantly lower rejection rate
than the mean of their corresponding data sets. Conversely, genes from the 'non-essential' core in the E
('Amino acid transport and metabolism') and I ('Lipid
metabolism') categories had a significantly higher rejection rate of the RT using the SH test (Table 2).

Discussion
One of the main questions in phylogenomic analyses
based on sequence information is the composition of the
data set used. We have generated three different data sets
derived from the genes present in the endosymbiont Blochmannia floridanus and other 20 genomes. These data
sets, denoted 'Blochmannia' core, 'universal' core and
'essential' core, have allowed us to study the influence of
different, presumably important factors on bacterial phylogenomics.

The main question we wanted to address was whether
essentiality and universality were important factors influencing the efficiency of the commonly used concatenate
methodology. Genes common to the 21 genomes, therefore expected to be quasi-universal at least at the Proteobacteria taxonomic level, were included in the 200-gene
data set thus conforming the 'universal' core. On the other
hand, the 133-genes common to the 21 genomes and
simultaneously proposed to be minimal for a self-sustainable life conformed the 'essential' core, whose most relevant feature is essentiality. Their performance in the
concatenate analyses was completely different: the 'essential' core recovered the RT with fewer genes and with
higher frequency than the 'universal' core. Clearly, essentiality seems to be an important factor. In fact, while the
addition of genes had little effect over the 'universal' core,
in the 'essential' core the mean distances to the RT reduced
continuously until becoming null when 60 genes were
concatenated. These results indicate that although the vertical signal is strong in the 'universal' core it still includes
incongruent genes and therefore universality does not
necessarily mean absence of factors like phylogenetic
noise or lateral gene transfer [32]. Meanwhile, 'essential'
genes seem to have an even stronger vertical signal, a
result expected because of the increased proportion of
informational genes in the 'essential' core data set [29,33].
The difficulties in recovering the RT mainly in the 10- and
20-genes concatenates revealed that some incongruence
was still present in the 'essential' core. The analysis of the
set of genes present in the 'universal' core and not
included in the 'essential' core reveals that a substantial
portion of the non-vertical signal that differentiates these

two core sets is found in this 67-genes subset, which we
have referred to as 'non-essential' core.
Therefore, we have shown that essentiality, defined as the
intersection between universality and minimal gene set, is
a more important factor than universality to recover the
vertical signal of proteobacterial genomes. However, we
have also shown that the presence of incongruence is not
always buffered even in cases where the number of concatenated genes is high. In consequence, we have analyzed
the importance of a third factor, namely the function of
the genes included in each data set. Due to the nature of
the three data sets we have been able to use both supertree
and supermatrix approaches. Obviously, the composition
of the core is clearly influenced by the special gene composition of the endosymbionts included in the study.
These genomes have retained only those genes useful to
their symbiotic association and to maintain the essential
functions of the cell [27].

Many studies have shown a relationship between gene
function and the evolutionary signal encoded therein,
associating a higher frequency of lateral gene transfer to
operational genes [28,33,34]. We have analyzed this signal in a phylogenomic context taking into account not
only the functional category of the genes but also their
assignation to each of the three data sets defined previously. In agreement with the results obtained in previous
works, the informational categories seem to retain a better
vertical signal than operational ones. The supertrees
obtained for each of the three data sets with genes in the
information category recovered the RT, whereas cellular,
metabolism and poorly characterized genes showed a
poor performance. In addition, the mean topological distance of each category to the RT confirms the high efficiency of the informational category with respect to the
others, whose distance to the RT is significantly higher.
However, a more detailed analysis reveals a more complex
pattern.

Functional category

Figure 4
Comparisons (RF distances) between concatenate trees, by functional category, and the reference tree
Comparisons (RF distances) between concatenate trees, by functional category, and the reference tree. The
phylogenies for concatenates of genes in the 'essential' and 'universal' cores and functional category were derived by maximum
likelihood. Cases marked with an asterisk indicate that no genes were present in the corresponding category for the 'essential'
core.

Focusing in the three informational categories, the 'transcription' (K) category recovers the RT in all cases. Furthermore, this is the only category for which supertrees and
concatenates perform equally well. Meanwhile the 'Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis' (J) category
also presents a good efficiency in the concatenate analysis.
However, the 'DNA replication, recombination and
repair' (L) category only recovers the RT in the 'universal'
data set. Therefore, it seems that the 'Transcription' category is a good marker for phylogenomic exploration studies in which the vertical descent relationships of the
species have to be assessed.
Metabolism genes usually represent the category with a
higher frequency of horizontal gene transfer events [34].
Our analysis corroborates this result, as we have shown
that the specialized categories encompassed by this general class have the higher distance to the RT. This result
contrasts with the good performance of cellular categories, notably the 'Posttranslational modification, protein
turnover, chaperones' (O) and 'Cell motility and secretion' (N) categories. In fact, the relative frequency of these
categories is maintained or even increased over the three
data sets analyzed. Even more interesting is the case of the
'poorly characterized' genes. Particularly, the 'General
function' (R) behaves surprisingly well. Contrary to the
'Function unknown' (S) category, which practically disap-

pears in the 'universal' and 'essential' cores, around 15
genes of the R category are present in these two data sets.
The importance of these genes is being recognized now
and their influence on bacterial evolution and adaptation
is being studied [26,35]. Our results confirm the importance of some of these genes that seem to encompass a
good vertical phylogenetic signal.
Finally, it is also remarkable the frequency of RT rejection
through the SH test of genes belonging to each functional
category. Taking into account the whole genome, around
30% of the gene trees reject the RT and a similar fraction
is maintained in the 'universal' and 'essential' cores. This
incongruence could be due to the presence of non-vertical
signals or to phylogenetic noise (for instance, insufficient
signal in the corresponding multiple alignments). The
same analysis but splitting the data set by functional category reveals that only the 'Transcription' (K) category has
a significantly lower rate of rejection. This means that
non-vertical processes and the presence of phylogenetic
noise pervade all categories although, as we have shown,
genes in some categories are better vertical markers than
those in others.
We acknowledge the possible effects that including endosymbiont genomes could have in the recovered phylogenies. The evolution of endosymbiotic genomes is directly

influenced by their lifestyle. Due to their relationship with
the host, those genes that are not necessary for their survival are difficult to retain. This means that genes related
to a free-living style or those related to motility are lost
and most of the remaining ones are under weak selection
or even in pseudogenization process [36]. This process of
genome erosion translates most of the times into high
A+T content and substitution rates that, from a phylogenomic point of view, imply possible convergences in the
same clade of unrelated genomes, a phenomenon known
as "long branch attraction" [37-39]. These features have
posed a challenge to traditional phylogenetic methods
and are being revealed also as a conflicting point in
genome phylogenies, mostly in those based on gene content. Our reference tree assumes the monophyly of the five
endosymbionts studied, a result derived in previous works
although with some conflicting results [30,31,40-42]. The
inclusion in the data set of these genomes has two opposing effects. On the one hand, it reduces the number of
genes shared among the species and thus affects the concatenate analyses. However, the number of genes shared
by these Proteobacteria excluding these genomes is
around 290, not much higher than the 200 genes found
here [43]. On the other hand, testing phylogenomic methods with these special conditionings also allows for testing their robustness and more general applicability.

Conclusion
Phylogenomic analyses are allowing us to study the
genome evolution of microorganisms in an extent and
detail impossible before the genomic revolution [44]. In
the case of evolutionary genomics, current efforts are
focusing on the identification of all the evolutionary signals encoded in their genomes. Here we have presented a
detailed study on where the vertical signal in Proteobacteria genomes resides. From a phylogenomic perspective,
we have shown that the division between informational
and operational genes is not as important as previously
postulated and that the essentiality of the genes plays an
important role in the phylogenetic signal they carry. We
have also shown that those sequences classified as 'poorly
characterized' are important from an evolutionary perspective as revealed by the gene and phylogenomic trees
derived from them and represent a challenge to interpret
the evolution of the gene composition of bacteria.

Methods
Selection of putative orthologs and definition of cores
We have used the complete genomes of 21 Proteobacteria
species (Table 1), including three β-Proteobacteria, one αProteobacteria and five endosymbiont genomes belonging to the γ-Proteobacteria group. In a previous work
(Comas et al. submitted) we obtained the complete phylome of one of these endosymbionts, Blochmannia floridanus [31]. The first step consisted in retrieving the putative

orthologs of each protein coding gene in the B. floridanus
genome. For this, we started by constructing a reference
tree with orthologs for 60 informational genes present in
all the genomes considered. This reference tree was
obtained with the same procedure described in detail
below and it represents an expanded version of the tree
reported in Gil et al. [31] with additional sequences from
the non-γ-Proteobacteria genomes. With this reference
tree, we assigned each genome to one of nine different
groups (see Figure 1) in order to reduce the BLAST database and to speed up and refine the searches.
Each of the 579 B. floridanus protein coding genes was
queried [45] against the members of each group. The best
hit within a group was used in a subsequent BLAST search
against the remaining genomes in that group to retrieve
the remaining homologs. We used a minimum threshold
of E-value < 1E-03 to consider hits for further analysis.
This procedure allowed us to amplify the strength of the
searched signal. Most of the genes retrieved in this step
were unambiguously putative orthologs. However, we
considered that a more stringent test of orthology was necessary before proceeding with the analysis. Hence, we
aligned the homologs resulting from the BLAST search for
the 579 Blochmannia genes and obtained the corresponding maximum likelihood gene trees. Then each homolog
was considered as a putative ortholog of the corresponding B. floridanus gene once it successfully passed a filtering
process based on the following criteria: BLAST report (we
used a minimum threshold of E-value < 1E-03), associated functional annotation, length of the alignment,
observed and expected position in the gene tree, and
adscription to the clusters specified in the Microbial
Genome Database for Comparative Analysis [46]. When
more than one gene in a genome were identified fulfilling
these criteria, we kept the one with best alignment and
least likelihood of being a non-orthologous paralog or
xenolog for further analysis. Since the B. floridanus
genome contains no duplicated genes, only one gene per
genome was considered in all the analyses. From the 579
alignments, we defined three data sets with different
genomic, evolutionary and phylogenetic meaning:
- 'Blochmannia' core: composed by the 579 annotated protein coding genes of Blochmannia floridanus and their corresponding homologs in the other 20 genomes. In this set
we deal with from genes present in the 21 genomes to
genes present in only four.
- 'Universal' core: the 200 genes of Blochmannia floridanus
that are also present in the remaining 20 genomes. This set
represents those ubiquitous genes in this particular set of
genomes but it does not mean that they are essential for
bacterial cell life. In this set a fraction of true orthologs
and xenologs/paralogs coexist.

Reference Tree (RT) and taxonomical classification of the 21 Proteobacteria genomes studied
Reference Tree (RT) and taxonomical classification of the 21 Proteobacteria genomes studied. The figure is
adapted from a previous work (Comas et al. submitted). The taxa and their corresponding taxonomic classification are shown.
The topology was obtained in an extensive phylogenomic analysis with the same data set used here. The analyses included a
200-gene supermatrix, a 579-gene supermatrix with coding for absent genes and the supertree derived from the phylome of
Blochmannia floridanus. Further analyses aimed to correct for the possible influence of GC content bias affecting mainly endosymbiont genomes resulted in the same topology shown here. The branch lengths provided were retrieved from a concatenation of 60 informational genes analyzed by maximum likelihood.

- 'Essential' core: from the 200 genes of the 'universal' core
we obtained those genes coincident with the proposal for
the minimal genome by Gil et al. [27]. This paper
describes the 206 genes needed by a cell for a self-sustainable life. From them, 133 genes were present in our 'universal' core and were selected for the 'essential' core and
considered as a subset of genes with higher fraction of true
orthologs and with essentiality as their common property.
Each data set is composed of the single gene alignments
and their derived gene trees. Multiple alignments were
obtained with CLUSTALW [47] and later trimmed of positions of ambiguous homology using GBLOCKS [48] with
default settings. All the gene trees were inferred using
PHYML [49] whose maximum likelihood reconstructions

are based on the simultaneous optimization of the topology and branch lengths. In all cases we used the JTT [50]
model of amino acid substitution with frequencies estimated from the data set. The proportion of invariant sites
was also estimated and we assumed eight discrete rate categories to approximate a gamma distribution for substitution rate heterogeneity among sites.
The congruence of each gene tree was tested against this
reference tree by means of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)
test [51] of topologies implemented in TREE-PUZZLE
[52].
Genes from each data set were assigned to different functional categories following their annotation in the Bloch-

mannia floridanus genome. We used 18 specific functional
categories and 4 general ones as defined in the COG database [53].
Supermatrix analysis
We first analyzed the performance of the concatenate
analysis without taking into account the functional
assignment of the genes. We carried out two different
analyses, one for the 'essential' core and the other for the
'universal' core. One hundred concatenates of 10, 20, 30,
40, 50 and 60 genes were generated randomly from the
pool of genes belonging to both core sets resulting in 600
concatenates for each data set. Each one of the 1200 concatenates was analyzed by maximum likelihood using
PHYML under the JTT model of evolution and four
gamma categories. The computational load prevented us
from using more parameters in the evolutionary model.
We compared the phylogeny derived from each concatenate with the reference tree shown in Figure 5 by using the
Robinson-Foulds distance [54]. This metric measures the
number of partitions not shared between two phylogenies
and is implemented in the program TREEDIST of the
PHYLIP package [55].
Concatenate and supertree analyses of functional
categories
We divided the genes in each core into 18 specific functional and four general categories. For the phylome set of
genes, we screened the phylogenetic signal contained in
each functional category by obtaining the supertrees
derived from the gene trees of each alignment. Differences
in the number of species represented in each gene alignment prevented us from performing a concatenate analysis of the whole phylome. However, for the 'universal' and
'essential' cores we were able to obtain the supertree and
the concatenate alignments for each functional category.

All the supertrees were obtained with the CLANN software
[56]. We employed the commonly used Matrix Representation using Parsimony – MRP [57,58] method. In this
method each node of the source trees is coded as a character and a binomial code is assigned to the presence (1) or
absence (0) of each taxon in the clade defined by the
node. The resulting matrix is analyzed by parsimony. In
some cases, the analyses resulted in more than one possible supertree in which case we took into account whether
the RT topology was among the most parsimonious topologies found. With the concatenate alignments we
obtained the maximum likelihood topology through
PHYML [59]. For all the alignments, we used the JTT
model of evolution, frequencies estimated from the data
set, an estimated proportion of invariant sites and eight
gamma rate categories.

Once a supertree and a concatenate phylogeny were
obtained for each functional category and core set, we
analyzed their phylogenetic signal through their comparison with the RT. The Robinson-Foulds distance as implemented in the program TREEDIST of the PHYLIP package
was used to measure the similarity between the obtained
topologies and the RT topology. The Shimodaira-Hasegawa test obtained as explained above was also used taking
into account the functional assignment of the genes.
