Abstract
Background: Methanogenesis is the sole means of energy production in methanogenic Archaea.
H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd) catalyzes a step in the
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in class I methanogens. At least one hmd paralog has
been identified in nine of the eleven complete genome sequences of class I hydrogenotrophic
methanogens. The products of these paralog genes have thus far eluded any detailed functional
characterization.
Results: Here we present a thorough computational analysis of Hmd enzymes and paralogs that
includes state of the art phylogenetic inference, structure prediction, and functional site prediction
techniques. We determine that the Hmd enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from Hmd paralogs
but share a common overall structure. We predict that the active site of the Hmd enzyme is
conserved as a functional site in Hmd paralogs and use this observation to propose possible
molecular functions of the paralog that are consistent with previous experimental evidence. We
also identify an uncharacterized site in the N-terminal domains of both proteins that is predicted
by our methods to directly impart function.
Conclusion: This study contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary history, structural
conservation, and functional roles, of the Hmd enzymes and paralogs. The results of our
phylogenetic and structural analysis constitute datasets that will aid in the future study of the Hmd
protein family. Our functional site predictions generate several testable hypotheses that will guide
further experimental characterization of the Hmd paralog. This work also represents a novel
approach to protein function prediction in which multiple computational methods are integrated
to achieve a detailed characterization of proteins that are not well understood.

Background
The methanogens are a diverse, but phylogenetically
related, group of Archaea. Methanogenic Archaea have
been isolated from habitats ranging from mammalian gut
flora to deep sea hydrothermal vents. Methanogens are

comprised of two taxonomic classes known as class I and
class II [1-3]. Class I methanogens include the orders
Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, and Methanopyrales,
while class II methanogens include the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales.

The three known methanogenesis pathways are distinguished with regards to the electron source. These are
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis, and methylotrophic methanogenesis [4].
Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis involves the reduction of CO2 to CH4, utilizing H2 and reduced cofactors as
electron donors through a seven step pathway (Figure 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/199

Many hydrogenotrophic methanogens are autotrophic,
requiring only CO2, H2, and inorganic salts to produce
energy through methanogenesis and synthesize biomass
through CO2 fixation [5].
The fourth step in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis
of class I methanogens involves the reduction of N5,N10methenyltetrahydromethanopterin (methenyl-H4MPT)
to N5,N10-methylene-H4MPT. Class II methanogens differ
in their use of methanosarcinapterin rather than H4MPT
as the C1 carrier. This step in class I methanogens can be
carried out by either of two different enzymes. Coenzyme
F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (Mtd)
reduces methenyl-H4MPT using reduced coenzyme F420 as
the electron donor. H2-forming methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (Hmd) reduces methenyl-H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT using H2 as an electron source. Afting et al. [6]
observed in Methanothermobacter marbugensis that Hmd
has a specific activity greater than that of Mtd under
nickel-limited, ammonia-limited, and non-limited conditions while Mtd has a specific activity greater than that of
Hmd under hydrogen-limited conditions. Hendrickson et
al. [7] observed in Methanococcus maripaludis that hmd is
upregulated proportional to growth rate and mtd is upregulated under hydrogen limitation.
The Hmd holoenzyme is comprised of a homodimer of
38 kDa subunits, two pyridone derivative cofactor molecules, and two iron atoms [8]. Each iron atom coordinates
the reduction of methenyl-H4MPT and oxidation of H2
while bound to both Hmd and a cofactor molecule [8,9].
The apoenzyme of Hmd is stable and can be restored to
active holoenzyme by the addition of cofactor [9]. Hmd is
the only known hydrogenase that lacks an iron-sulfur
cluster and is sometimes referred to as the 'iron-sulfur
cluster-free hydrogenase'.

The hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway of
class I methanogens. The pathway diagram was adapted
from [5] with permission from the author and publisher. The
fourth step of this pathway can be catalyzed by either Hmd,
which uses H2 as an electron donor, or Mtd, which uses
F420•H2 as an electron donor. H4MPT = tetrahydromethanopterin, F420 = coenzyme F420, and HTP = S-S-7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate.

Almost all genomes of class I hydrogenotrophic methanogens contain both an hmd enzyme gene and at least one
hmd paralog gene. Several species have two copies of the
hmd paralog (referred to in this manuscript with arbitrary
numeration as paralog1 and paralog2; see Additional file
1). Afting et al. [6] first showed in M. marburgensis that the
protein products of hmd paralogs are present in the cell.
Their study also revealed that Hmd paralog1 is detectable
at low H2, while Hmd paralog2 is detectable at high H2
and that neither paralog show any observable hydrogenase activity. Recent unpublished work mentioned in a
review by Shima and Thauer [10] indicates that Hmd
paralog1 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii can competitively bind cofactor and inhibit the activation of Hmd
apoenzyme. Curiously, Hmd paralog1 in M. jannaschii was
shown by Lipman et al. [11] to specifically bind prolyltRNA synthetase. While these results taken together constitute a partial characterization of Hmd paralogs, our

understanding of these proteins and their role in methanogenesis is far from complete.

trees and differs in only three terminal nodes of the Phylip
[26] tree.

Here we present advanced computational analyses of
Hmd enzymes and their paralogs from the genomes of sixteen class I hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The relationship of hmd enzyme and paralog sequences is
demonstrated through phylogenetic analysis. The tertiary
structures of Hmd enzymes and paralogs from five representative species are predicted using the top ranking modeling server of the last two CASP competitions [[12]; http:/
/predictioncenter.org/casp8/]. Functional characterization of the Hmd paralogs is performed using a state of the
art method recently developed by our group [13]. Taken
together, these analyses form a thorough computational
characterization of the Hmd enzymes and paralogs and
generate several testable hypotheses regarding the molecular functions of both Hmd enzymes and paralogs.

In all three trees, Hmd enzymes and paralogs form two
distinct monophyletic groups. Curiously, the Hmd
enzyme and paralog subtrees are considerably dissimilar
regarding the placement of M. jannaschii sequences. These
sequences are more basal in the paralog subtree than the
enzyme subtree (with the exception of Hmd paralog1 in
the Phylip tree). Bifurcation patterns in the tree suggest
that paralog duplication has taken place independently in
the lineages leading to M. jannaschii, M. kandleri, and the
last common ancestor of M. marburgensis and M. thermautotrophicus. The two Hmd paralogs of M. jannaschii are paraphyletic in the PhyML and MrBayes trees and
polyphyletic in the Phylip tree. The paralog duplicates of
M. kandleri and the last common ancestor of M. marburgensis and M. thermautotrophicus both produce monophyletic topologies. It should be noted that M.
marburgensis and M. thermautotrophicus were considered
strains of a single species until recently [21].

Results and discussion
Sequence analysis
An exhaustive search for hmd genes was performed using
PSI-BLAST [14] and the MetaCyc multi-genome browser
[15]. This process identified thirty hmd enzyme and paralog sequences from sixteen species and strains of class I
hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Several methanogen
prephenate dehydrogenase genes were also identified by
our search. We use these genes as a phylogenetic outgroup
in the subsequent analysis. Complete genome sequences
are available for eleven of the sixteen species and strains.
Of these eleven, only the genomes of Methanocorpusculum
labreanum and Methanobrevibacter smithii contain an hmd
enzyme but not an hmd paralog. All Methanococcus spp.
have only one hmd paralog gene, while Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Methanothermobacter marburgensis, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, and Methanopyrus kandleri
have two hmd paralog genes. No species was found to
have an hmd paralog, but not an hmd enzyme. Features of
these genes, their GenInfo Identifiers, and their associated
references [[16-23]; Copeland et al., unpublished data;
Hartmann and Thauer, direct submission to NCBI databases
1996] are presented in Additional file 1. A ClustalW2
alignment of the protein sequences of these genes is
included as Additional file 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the thirty Hmd enzyme and paralog sequences was performed by three independent
methods. In each tree, the three prephenate dehydrogenase sequences were used as an outgroup. Figure 2 shows
the three trees and specifies the software, calculation algorithm, amino acid substitution matrix, and confidence
score calculation method used to generate them. Though
branch lengths differ between trees, the overall topology
is identical between the PhyML [24] and MrBayes [25]

These trees do not provide a conclusive explanation for
the lack of a paralog sequence in M. labraenum or M.
smithii. M. labraenum and M. smithii enzyme sequences are
not basally branching, but were inherited from the last
common ancestor of these species and the Methanothermobacter genus. Given that the M. kandleri paralog sequences
appear in a subtree with the other paralog sequences,
rather than branching from the base of the tree, it is likely
that both M. labraenum and M. smithii lost the Hmd paralog late in evolution. It is therefore probable, but not certain, that the last common ancestor of all class I
methanogens had both an Hmd enzyme and paralog.
Structure modeling
Tertiary structure models of fourteen representative Hmd
enzymes and paralogs were generated with I-TASSER
[27,28], which was the best performing structure modeling server in the two most recent CASP competitions
[[12], http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/]. The I-TASSER
algorithm is an advanced modeling method that searches
the SCOP database [29] for parent template structures,
uses these parent structures to comparatively model short
segments of the query protein, and connects these segments using de novo modeling techniques. Because the
modeling is not dependent on comparison to a single
homolog, this method can be considered a form of de novo
structure modeling.

The structure of the Hmd enzyme from M. jannaschii has
previously been solved by X-ray diffraction [[8]; PDB ID =
2b0j]. This structure was the most often used parent template of the top C-scoring [27] model of each protein. The
next three most often used parent structures were dehy-

Figure 2
Three phylogenetic trees of the Hmd protein family
Three phylogenetic trees of the Hmd protein family. Each phylogeny was calculated independently using different software, tree calculation algorithms, and amino acid substitution models, which are displayed to the upper left of each tree.
Archaeal prephenate dehydrogenase is used as an outgroup in each tree. The trees have differing branch lengths, but almost
identical topologies. The Phylip tree differs from the other two at three leaf nodes highlighted in red. In these trees, Hmd
enzymes and paralogs form two distinct monophyletic groups. Only two species with complete genome sequences, M. smithii
and M. labraenum, have an Hmd enzyme and do not have an Hmd paralog. The phylogenies indicate that three independent
duplications of the Hmd paralog took place in the lineage leading to M. jannaschii, the lineage leading to M. kandleri, and the lineage of the last common ancestor of M. marburgensis and M. thermoauotrophicum. This analysis suggests that Hmd paralogs have
a conserved functional role in class I hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

drogenases. These parent structures were arogenate dehydrogenase from Synechocystis sp., hydroxyisobutyrate
dehydrogenase from Homo sapiens, and prephenate dehydrogenase from Aquifex aeolicus. The resulting I-TASSER
models were evaluated by both the C-score [27] and residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function
(RAPDF) [30] scoring functions. These scoring functions
measure the relative accuracy of a given model compared
to other models of the same protein. C-score is determined by clustering the thousands of intermediate models generated during the I-TASSER run. Structures in the
center of the largest clusters are assumed to be the most
accurate. RAPDF determines the quality of a model by calculating the sum of logodds scores for all interatomic distances within the model derived from frequencies
observed in diffraction structures. The model with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/199

highest C-score also had the best RAPDF score in the case
of all five Hmd enzymes and two of the nine Hmd paralogs. Figure 3 shows all top C-scoring and RAPDF-scoring
models mapped onto a PhyML [24] phylogeny of the corresponding sequences. A summary of features of these
models is given in Table 1. A concatenated file of all top
C-scoring and RAPDF-scoring models in PDB format is
available as Additional file 3.
All models are composed of two distinct folding regions,
a 200–300 amino acid N-terminal domain which contains both α-helices and β-sheets and a ~50 amino acid Cterminal domain containing only α-helices. According to
the diffraction structure of the Hmd enzyme, catalytic
activity takes place within the N-terminal domains while
dimerization occurs between the C-terminal domains of

labeled "R" represent the model with the best RAPDF score [30] for a given protein. Models labeled "C" represent the model
with the best C-score [27] for a given protein. Models labeled "RC" had both the best RAPDF and C-score for a given protein.
Features of these models are summarized in Table 1. All models contain the same overall structure consisting of an N-terminal
domain composed of α-helices and β-sheets and a C-terminal domain composed of α-helices. In the Hmd enzyme, the N-terminal domain contains the catalytic site while the C-terminal domain facilitates dimerization in the Hmd holoenzyme. In general, the N-terminal domain exhibits more structural variability than the C-terminal domain (see Table 1).

RAPDF = residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) [30]
C-score = internal I-TASSER scoring function [27]
RMSD = all-atom root mean square deviation between the model and the diffraction structure of Hmd enzyme from M. jannaschii (PDB ID = 2b0j)

subunits [8,9]. To gauge the structural conservation
between Hmd enzymes and paralogs, root mean square
deviations (RMSDs) between the models and the diffraction structure were calculated with respect to the whole
protein, the N-terminal domain only, and the C-terminal
domain only.
The RMSD between model and diffraction structure is significantly lower with respect to C-terminal domains than
N-terminal domains for 10 out of 21 models. These models are Hmd enzymeRC from M. kandleri, Hmd paralog1-R,
Hmd paralog1-C, and Hmd paralog2-R from M. thermautotrophicus, Hmd paralog2-R and Hmd paralog2-C from M.
marburgensis, Hmd paralogR from M. maripaludis, Hmd
paralog1-R, Hmd paralog2-R, and Hmd paralog2-C from M.
jannaschii, and Hmd paralog2-R and Hmd paralog2-C from
M. kandleri. The RMSD of the C-terminal domains of the
Hmd enzymeRC from M. maripaludis and the diffraction
structure of Hmd was higher than that of the N-terminal
domain. ClustalW2 multiple sequence alignments [31] of
the query protein with its I-TASSER parent structures are
available as Additional file 4. Visual analysis of these
alignments suggests that the modeling is not biased
towards one of the two domains due to sequence similarity with the parent structures. These results therefore indicate that the C-terminal domain is more structurally
conserved between Hmd enzyme and paralog than the Nterminal domain.

Function prediction by Protinfo MFS comparison
The Meta-Functional Signature score (MFS) was used in
conjunction with multiple sequence alignment to predict
functional sites and functional similarity between Hmd
enzymes and paralogs. MFS is part of the Protinfo suite of
algorithms
http://protinfo.compbio.washington.edu/
and predicts the functional sites of a protein with higher
accuracy than other currently available algorithms [13].
For a given protein, the MFS algorithm quantifies and
measures multiple orthogonal features of each amino acid
pertaining to either the evolutionary conservation of the
amino acid, the contribution of the amino acid to structural integrity, or the frequency in which the residue type
itself is found in known functional sites. These features are
combined to give the MFS score, which represents the
probability that a given amino acid contributes directly to
function.

MFS scores were calculated for each model summarized in
Table 1. The raw MFS data are available as Additional file
5. Any residue with an MFS score in the top ten out of the
whole protein was considered a putative functional residue. A ClustalW2 multiple sequence alignment [31] was
used to tally the number of putative functional sites that
appear in the same alignment position across multiple
species (Figure 4). This analysis served two purposes. First,
the comparison of putative functional sites across either
Hmd enzymes or paralogs provided an ad hoc bootstrapping of the MFS predictions. Second, the comparison of

An abridged multiple sequence alignment with putative functional site tallies. For clarity, only the consensus
sequence along with representative Hmd enzyme and paralog1 sequences from M. jannaschii are shown. The original multiple
sequence alignment containing every sequence is available as Additional file 6. Arrows indicate positions where at least one top
ten MFS scoring residue appears in the alignment. Such residues are considered putative functional sites. Arrows referring to
putative functional residues from Hmd enzymes are shown above the alignment while those referring to putative functional
residues from the Hmd paralogs are shown below the alignment. Numbers at the base of each arrow refer to the quantity of
putative functional residues that appear in a single alignment position. Putative functional residues from models that had both
the best C-score [27] and RAPDF score [30] are counted twice. Positions in which putative functional residues are found in at
least 40% of either Hmd enzymes or Hmd paralogs are highlighted. In five such alignment positions, putative functional sites are
found in at least 40% of Hmd enzymes and 40% of Hmd paralogs. Such residue positions are predicted to facilitate a function
that is common between Hmd enzymes and paralogs.

putative functional sites between Hmd enzymes and paralogs was used to ascertain whether they share common
functional attributes. The unabridged superimposition of
MFS data onto a full ClustalW2 alignment of all modeled
Hmd proteins is available as Additional file 6.
In fifteen such alignment positions, putative functional
residues were predicted in at least 40% of either Hmd
enzymes or paralogs. In five of these fifteen alignment
positions, putative functional sites were predicted in at
least 40% of Hmd enzymes and at least 40% of Hmd paralogs. Figure 5A shows representative residues from these
fifteen alignment positions mapped onto the diffraction
structure of Hmd enzyme [8] and the structure model of
Hmd paralog1 from M. jannaschii. All fifteen residues are
located within the N-terminal domain of the protein. The
paucity of these residues in the C-terminal domain of
either protein is most likely due to its involvement in
dimerization rather than enzymatic function.
Four of the five alignment positions in which multiple
putative functional residues are conserved between Hmd
enzymes and paralogs cluster into a single distinct region
(Figure 5B). This cluster is comprised of H174, C176,
T177, and H201 in Hmd enzyme and N125, C127, T128,
and H154 in Hmd paralog1 from M. jannaschii (Figure
5C). In the Hmd enzyme from M. jannaschii, C176 was
previously demonstrated to bind the cofactor and coordinate the iron and substrate [8,9]. This cluster of putative
functional sites therefore represents the active site of the
Hmd enzyme. The H174 residue of the Hmd enzyme corresponds to the N125 residue of Hmd paralog1. Thus the
functional importance of this site appears to be conserved
while the residue type itself is not. These results are consistent with the independent observations that the Hmd
paralog1 of M. jannaschii is able to competitively bind the
Hmd cofactor [10] and that both Hmd paralogs of M.
marburgensis are unable to catalyze a hydrogenase/dehydrogenase reaction [6] (see Background). A second predicted common functional site between Hmd enzymes
and paralogs is comprised of a single amino acid, D143 in

Hmd enzyme and E94 in Hmd paralog1 (Figure 5D). The
functional relevance of this region is yet unknown. There
is no experimental evidence that all Hmd paralogs are
functionally equivalent. Our analysis however is not
dependent on all Hmd paralogs having a single common
function. Rather all Hmd paralogs are predicted here to
have a common ancestral function and still maintain
common features of function, such as the locations of
functional sites.
Lipman et al. [11] demonstrated that Hmd paralog1 from
M. jannaschii specifically binds prolyl-tRNA synthetase.
The biological significance of this binding has not been
examined in a published study since this initial work. Lipman et al. observed that mutations V248A and L252A
reduced this binding 4-fold. In our MFS calculation for
Hmd paralog1 from M. jannaschii, V248 has a score of 0.05
and L252 has a score of 0.22. Val and Leu are typically not
conserved within protein-protein binding "hot spots"
[32]. It may be the case that V248 and L252 represent
structurally important residues in Hmd paralog1 that do
not contribute directly to function. Thus, our MFS analysis
cannot confirm the biological relevance of Hmd paralog1
binding to prolyl-tRNA synthetase in M. jannaschii.

Conclusion
This study offers an in depth computational analysis of
the relationship between the sequences, structures, and
functional features of Hmd enzymes and paralogs in class
I hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Phylogenetic analysis
of thirty hmd enzyme and paralog genes from sixteen species and strains confirms that the genetic predecessors of
modern Hmd enzymes and paralogs were present in the
last common ancestor of all class I hydrogenotrophic
methanogens. Structural modeling of fourteen representative Hmd enzymes and paralogs reveals a common structural arrangement comprised of one large N-terminal
domain containing α-helices and β-sheets and one
smaller C-terminal domain containing only α-helices.

tionally conserved residues in this functional site is a His
in Hmd enzymes and an Asn in most Hmd paralogs. We
conclude from these observations that the molecular
function of the Hmd paralog is similar but not identical to
the enzyme. Our analysis also predicted a second site of
common function between Hmd enzymes and paralogs
that is yet uncharacterized. Our MFS data did not substantiate the observation of Lipman et al. [11] that Hmd
paralog1 in M. jannaschii specifically binds to prolyl-tRNA
synthetase.

Predicted functional sites superimposed onto representative tertiary structures of the Hmd enzyme and
paralog. (A) Residues representing alignment positions in
either Hmd enzymes (red) or paralogs (orange) with putative
functional residues in at least 40% of models are superimposed onto the structures of the Hmd enzyme (blue) and
paralog1 (green) from M. jannaschii. These residues are D143,
K151, H174, C176, T177, H201, C204, E207, K209, R235,
and D251 in Hmd enzyme from M. janaschii and H55, E61,
E91, N125, C127, T128, H155, K198, and D206 in Hmd
paralog1 from M. janaschii. (B) Five such residues from each
protein are conserved between the Hmd enzymes and paralogs. (C) One cluster contains four such residues from each
protein (H174, C176, T177, and H201 from Hmd enzyme
and N125, C127, T128, and H154 from Hmd paralog1). C176
is known to bind the iron atom and cofactor molecule that
coordinate the enzymatic reaction of the Hmd enzyme [8,9].
(D) A second region with no previously characterized functional contribution contains one such residue from each protein (D143 in Hmd enzyme and E94 in Hmd paralog1). This
figure shows a predicted functional similarity between Hmd
enzymes and paralogs and also identifies a putative novel site
of common function.

Functional site prediction was performed by the calculation of Meta-Functional Signature (MFS) scores for the
fourteen modeled Hmd enzymes and paralogs [13]. MFS
comparison across a multiple sequence alignment
revealed five functional sites conserved between Hmd
enzymes and paralogs. The superimposition of these sites
onto representative structures of the Hmd enzyme and
paralog showed that the enzyme active site is maintained
as a functional site in the paralog. One of the four func-

Previous experimental work has demonstrated that Hmd
paralogs do not enzymatically catalyze hydrogenase/
dehydrogenase reactions [6], but are able to competitively
bind the Hmd enzyme cofactor [10]. Our results indicate
that the catalytic site of the Hmd enzyme is conserved as
a functional site in Hmd paralogs, but that the molecular
function of the paralog differs from that of the enzyme
due to at least one key amino acid substitution. Given
these observations, it is possible that the Hmd paralog is
responsible for acting as a reservoir for the Hmd enzyme
cofactor when H2 is low and the Mtd reaction is favored
over the Hmd reaction (see Background). Alternatively,
the Hmd paralog may act as a scaffold for cofactor synthesis. These hypotheses warrant experimental verification.
The datasets and predictions generated in this study provide a guide for future experimental characterization of
the Hmd protein family. This work also serves as an example of detailed protein function prediction that can be
achieved by the combination of multiple independent
computational techniques. We are currently working to
optimize and generalize the method presented here. Such
an approach will increase the accuracy of protein function
prediction and help to guide the early steps of experimental protein characterization.

Methods
Sequence analysis
Thirty Hmd enzyme and paralog sequences from sixteen
species and strains were identified using the NCBI
implemetation of PSI-BLAST [14] and the multi-genome
browser on the MetaCyc server [15]. Three sequences of
methanogen prephenate dehydrogenase were also identified and used as an outgroup in the phylogenetic analysis.
The boundary between N-terminal and C-terminal
domains that is presented in Additional file 1 was ascertained by extrapolating this boundary in the diffraction
structure of the Hmd enzyme from M. jannaschii across a
ClustalW2 multiple sequence alignment [31] of all thirty
Hmd sequences. Sequence identities between each pair of
proteins were calculated by ClustalW [33]. All of these
data are summarized in Additional file 1 along with references and GenInfo Identifiers for each sequence.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenies were generated separately using the PhyML
webserver [24], the Phylip software package [26], and the
MrBayes software package [25]. The PhyML phylogeny
was calculated using the maximum likelihood method
[34] and the WAG substitution matrix [35], which was
recommended on the server website. Confidence scores
for each branch are bootstrap support values obtained
from 500 independent resamplings of alignment positions. The Phylip phylogeny was calculated using the
neighbor joining method [36] and the JTT substitution
matrix [37]. Confidence scores for each branch are bootstrap support values obtained from 1,000 independent
resamplings of alignment positions. The MrBayes phylogenetic trees were calculated using mixed models of
amino acid substitution [38], which converged after
10,000 iterations in 100% usage of the WAG substitution
model [35]. The MrBayes tree and conditional probability
values of the corresponding branches were estimated from
750 tree topologies sampled along 7,500 iterations, following 2,500 burn-in iterations. All three trees were
drawn using the Retree and Drawgram programs from the
Phylip software package [26]. Trees were relabeled for
clarity using graphics editors.
Structure modeling
Structures were modeled using the I-TASSER webserver,
which was determined to be the most accurate structure
prediction server in both the CASP7 and CASP8 competitions [12,27,28]. The algorithm threads the query
sequence through experimentally solved structures in the
SCOP database [29] in order to identify up to five parent
structures to be used as comparative modeling templates.
Comparative modeling is used to model short segments
of the query protein. These segments are then attached by
physics-based de novo modeling.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/199

This comparative modeling was performed with Protinfo
CM [39,40]. Details of all fourteen models are presented
in Table 1. Root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of all
heavy atoms between the models were calculated using
the compare_structures program in the RAMP modeling
suite http://www.ram.org/computing/ramp/. A concatenated PDB formatted file of the models is available as
Additional file 3.
Function prediction by Protinfo MFS comparison
Meta-Functional Signature (MFS) scores were calculated
for each protein using the Protinfo MFS algorithm
[13,41]. For a given protein, the MFS algorithm quantifies
multiple orthogonal features of each amino acid that pertain to either the evolutionary conservation of the residue,
the contribution of the residue to the structural integrity
of the protein, or the frequency of the residue type in previously characterized functional sites. These features are
combined to produce a score from zero to one that represents the likelihood that the residue is a functional site.
Raw MFS data for each modeled protein are available as
Additional file 5.

The top ten MFS scoring residues from each protein were
considered putative functional sites. A multiple sequence
alignment of the corresponding sequences was generated
using ClustalW2 [31]. The number of putative functional
sites appearing in each alignment position was tallied.
Alignment positions in which at least 40% of either Hmd
enzymes or paralogs had a putative functional site were
identified on representative structures from M. jannaschii
using the Pymol molecular viewer [42]. An unabridged
multiple sequence alignment with highlighted putative
functional sites from each protein is available as Additional file 6.

Authors' contributions
I-TASSER returns five models for each amino acid
sequence. For all proteins, the most accurate model in
each set of five was determined using either the C-score,
which is internal to I-TASSER [27], or the residue-specific
all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF)
[32]. Both of these scoring functions measure the likelihood that a given model is correct with respect to other
models of the same protein. C-score is calculated by clustering the thousands of intermediate structures produced
during the I-TASSER run. The score is determined by the
size of the cluster surrounding each model. RAPDF determines the quality of a model by calculating the sum of
logodds scores for all interatomic distances within the
model derived from frequencies observed in diffraction
structures. The I-TASSER models of Hmd paralog2 from M.
jannaschii had a disconnected main chain. The main
chains of these models were made congruent by comparative modeling using the I-TASSER models as templates.
