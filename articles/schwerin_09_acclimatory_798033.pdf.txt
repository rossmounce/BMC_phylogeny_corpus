Abstract
Background: Temperature affects essentially every aspect of the biology of poikilothermic
animals including the energy and mass budgets, activity, growth, and reproduction. While thermal
effects in ecologically important groups such as daphnids have been intensively studied at the
ecosystem level and at least partly at the organismic level, much less is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying the acclimation to different temperatures. By using 2D gel electrophoresis
and mass spectrometry, the present study identified the major elements of the temperatureinduced subset of the proteome from differently acclimated Daphnia pulex.
Results: Specific sets of proteins were found to be differentially expressed in 10°C or 20°C
acclimated D. pulex. Most cold-repressed proteins comprised secretory enzymes which are
involved in protein digestion (trypsins, chymotrypsins, astacin, carboxypeptidases). The coldinduced sets of proteins included several vitellogenin and actin isoforms (cytoplasmic and musclespecific), and an AAA+ ATPase. Carbohydrate-modifying enzymes were constitutively expressed
or down-regulated in the cold.
Conclusion: Specific sets of cold-repressed and cold-induced proteins in D. pulex can be related
to changes in the cellular demand for amino acids or to the compensatory control of physiological
processes. The increase of proteolytic enzyme concentration and the decrease of vitellogenin, actin
and total protein concentration between 10°C and 20°C acclimated animals reflect the increased
amino-acids demand and the reduced protein reserves in the animal's body. Conversely, the
increase of actin concentration in cold-acclimated animals may contribute to a compensatory
mechanism which ensures the relative constancy of muscular performance. The sheer number of
peptidase genes (serine-peptidase-like: > 200, astacin-like: 36, carboxypeptidase-like: 30) in the D.
pulex genome suggests large-scaled gene family expansions that might reflect specific adaptations to
the lifestyle of a planktonic filter feeder in a highly variable aquatic environment.

Background
Planktonic crustaceans of the genus Daphnia experience
pronounced variations in ambient parameters such as
oxygen concentration and temperature in the field and
show plastic adaptive responses to these environmental
changes. Differential regulation of gene expression provides specific sets of proteins for the maintenance of cellular function under altered ambient conditions. The recent
release of the Daphnia pulex genome sequence [1,2] offers
the opportunity to relate proteomic adjustments to the
differentially regulated genes.
Temperature affects the performance of poikilothermic
animals at all levels of biological organization ranging
from biochemical reactions via physiological processes to
organismic properties such as fecundity and reproductive
success. Acute changes in water temperature, for example,
have a strong effect on systemic parameters such as heart
and ventilation rate of Daphnia spp. (e.g. [3]). However,
such physiological perturbations can be damped by acclimatory processes. Previous studies [3-6] have shown that
the metabolic rates, heart and ventilation rates, and muscular performances of several Daphnia species at 10°C and
20°C are not as different as expected from the Q10 rule,
provided the animals have the chance to acclimate to the
temperature at which they were tested. Such a type of
compensatory control (metabolic cold adaptation) is primarily based on adjustments in enzyme concentration
[7]. Nevertheless, a more or less reduced metabolic rate in
the cold decreases the nutritive requirements [8] and
causes also a retardation in somatic growth and development [9-11]. To mechanistically explain the role of temperature acclimation for the control of physiological
processes, it is essential to know the adjustments which
occur at the proteomic level.
The present study analyzed the protein expression patterns of 10°C and 20°C acclimated animals of Daphnia
pulex under normoxic conditions. Two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were employed to
identify the major elements of the temperature-induced
subset of the proteome. Based on their putative functions,
the probable physiological role of these sets of proteins
are discussed.

Results
Two-dimensional gels were prepared from total soluble
proteins extracted from 10°C or 20°C acclimated cultures
of Daphnia pulex kept under normoxia (oxygen partial
pressure: 20 kPa). A total of 224 spots were detected in
representative fusion images for each acclimation condition (Figure 1A, B; encircled spots). The dual-channel representation of both fusion gels revealed a large set of coldinduced proteins of low molecular weight (Mr < 40 kDa)
in the lower right diagonal half of the gel (Figure 1C; red-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/8

colored spots). Proteins of reduced expression in the cold
were mainly confined to the low-pI range (pI = 4–5) in the
upper left diagonal half of the gel (green-colored spots).
A total number of 17 spots comprising cold-repressed proteins (36–41, Figure 1A) and cold-induced proteins (spots
42–52, Figure 1B) were successfully identified by mass
spectrometry (Tables 1, see Table 2 for corresponding protein IDs and gen models). Additionally included into the
inter-gel comparison was a set of spots (1, 19–22, 28–32,
34–35), the identity of which was already known from a
previous study [12]. These spots showed either constitutive or temperature-dependent expressions.
It is conspicuous, that a separation of cold-induced and
cold-repressed proteins by Mr/pI leads to protein groups
of similar classification. Almost all of the identified proteins with a reduced expression in the cold (expression
reduction by 40–80%) were secretory enzymes involved
in protein digestion (spots 31–32 and 36–41, Table 1).
These include three trypsins (TRY4B, TRY5F, TRY5L), two
chymotrypsins (CHY1A, CHY1C), one astacin (ACN2),
and two carboxypeptidases (CPA1A, CPA1B). All these
proteins are synthesized as pro-enzymes (zymogens),
which are activated by the removal of an N-terminal
propeptide (3–11 kDa). Owing to the similarities in their
Mr/pI values, these proteins were multiply identified
among the analysed spots. In addition, the multiple
occurrence of TRY5F and CHY1C in spots with assigned
Mr values of 25 and  30 kDa may be explained by the possible co-presence of pro-enzymes and enzymes. The only
non-proteolytic proteins identified among these spots
were two secretory proteins (ERNA, ERNB) carrying the
characteristic domain of the EndoU/XendoU family of
endoribonucleases [13,14]. The spot region 28, which was
excised and analyzed in a previous study [12], contained
a mixture of enzymes (including peptidases of the family
M2 and M13), which made an expression evaluation
impossible.
Most dominant among the identified cold-induced proteins were the vitellogenins (VTGs) and actins. These proteins showed a 4–7-fold induction and were detected in
ten spots (43–52). The multiple detection of these proteins and the large discrepancies between the experimental (15–40 kDa) and predicted Mr values (actins: 42 kDa,
VTGs: 190–220 kDa) indicate that the main share of the
cold-induced protein spots in the lower right diagonal
half of the gel (Figure 1C; red-colored spots) were proteolytic cleavage fragments. However, it is important to note
that VTG cleavage fragments of 65–155 kDa may naturally
occur in developing Daphnia embryos (see discussion).
The tryptic peptides used for the identification of VTGs
covered a large part of the VTG sequences including the
superoxide dismutase-like domain (SOD), the large-lipid-

type-D domain (VWD) (Figure 2). None of the tryptic
peptides could be allocated to the domain of unkown
function (DUF1943) and to the interdomain regions.
Based on the high sequence coverage by trypic fragment
analysis, two vitellogenins (VTG1, VTG4) could be identified (Figure 2, lower part). Although the present study did
not yield any tryptic peptides for the N-terminal SOD-like

domain of VTG2, the presence of VTG2 among the analyzed spots cannot be excluded because of the very large
sequence identity of VTG2 and VTG1 (98% identity when
excluding the SOD-like domain).
Actins were detected in four spots (44, 47, 48, 51). The
tryptic peptides used for the identification of actins (Figure 3) covered only the C-terminal half of the 42-kDa pro-

Identification was based on 2D gel electrophoresis and nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of trypsin-digested proteins matched against the "Frozen Gene Catalog" of the D. pulex protein database [2]. The
compiled information includes the spot number (Figure 1A, B), the 10-to-20°C expression ratio, the number and sequences of matched peptides, the sequence coverage, the Mascot score as a statistical
measure of identification probability, the experimental and theoretical molecular weight (Mr) and isolectric point (pI) of the mature protein (without signal peptide), the predicted length of the N-terminal signal
peptide (SP) in secretory proteins, as well as the putative function and symbolic name of the protein. The length of the putative pro-peptide (PP) is additionally provided for proteolytic enzymes that are
secrected as inactive precursors (zymogens). The predicted Mr and pI values of zymogens and the mature enzymes are given as value ranges. The amino acid sequences of the identified proteins were derived
from the gene models listed in Table 2. a)percentage of predicted protein sequence covered by matched peptides. b)Probability-based MOWSE score: -10*Log(P), where P is the probability that the observed
match is a random event. Scores >38 indicate identity or extensive homology (p < 0.05). Protein scores are derived from ions scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein hits. The Mascot-score
calculation was performed using whole-protein sequence (including the N-terminal signal peptide in case of extracellular proteins). *p < 0.05 (t-Test).

Figure 2 of protein spots to the vitellogenins of Daphnia pulex
Assignment
Assignment of protein spots to the vitellogenins of Daphnia pulex. Daphnia vitellogenins (VTGs) are generally composed of an N-terminal large-lipid-transfer-module (Vit-N), a domain of unkown function (DUF1943), and a C-terminal von
Willebrand-factor type-D domain (VWD). Of the muliple VTGs of D. pulex, only four are shown in respect to their domain
composition (top). Note that VTG1, VTG2 and VTG3 additionally contain a superoxide dismutase-like domain (SOD) at the
N-terminus. Interdomain regions are shown in gray, the signal peptide in black. Conserved residues of the SOD for Cu2+ and
Zn2+ binding are indicated by blue (histidines) and green characters (histidines, aspartic acid), respectively. Potential N-linked
glycosylation sites are indicated by plus signs. 'ARRI' indicates primary cleavage sites between two arginine residues. The lower
part lists the tryptic peptides in the order of their appearance in the VTG sequences and in the analyzed spots.

teins, suggesting that the N-terminal half was
proteolytically cleaved during the preparation of wholeanimal extracts. Proteolytic cleavage is additionally indicated by the discrepancy between experimental (25–36
kDa) and predicted Mr values (42 kDa). Owing to the high
sequence identity ( 97%), it was impossible to discriminate the expression of cytoplasmic isoforms (ACT1A-D)
and muscle-specific isoforms (ACT2A-C). The lower
number of tryptic-peptide assignments and the complete
lack of EST evidences for ACT1D and ACT2C, however,
suggests that these two actins were probably not
expressed.
A ten-fold up-regulation in the cold was found for an
AAA+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase associated with
diverse cellular activities; [15]), a fragment of which was
detected in spot 42. Additional identifications comprised
proteolytic cleavage fragments of a molecular chaperone
(HSP90, spot 47), the heavy chain of myosin (MHC-1)
and a pyruvate kinase (both in spot 48). Since the latter
three proteins were co-identified with actins and VTGs in
the same spots, it was impossible to assess their induction
states.
Among the remaining identifications was a group of carbohydrate-modifying enzymes with a constitutive or
reduced expression in the cold. Constitutive expressions
showed the exo--1,3-glucanase EXG5 (spot 34) and the
-amylase AMY (spot 35). The cold-repressed proteins
included a cellubiohydrolase (CEL7A, spot 1), an endo-1,4-glucanase (CEL9A, co-localized with paramyosin in
spot 19), an endo--1,4-mannanase (MAN5A, co-local-

ized with a -1,3-glucan-binding protein in spot 30), and
the enolase ENO (spot 19).

Discussion
As a companion study to a previous investigation of acclimatory adjustments of the Daphnia pulex proteome to
hypoxia [12], the effects of two different acclimation temperatures (10°C and 20°C) on the Daphnia pulex proteome were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis and mass
spectrometry. Temperature acclimation mostly affected
the expression of sets of proteins different from those
identified under variable oxygen conditions. Several proteins constitutively expressed or subjected to hypoxic
induction were also detected in the 2D gels presented
here. The specific sets of proteins up- or down-regulated in
the cold (10°C) were identified here for the first time.
Cold-induced protein sets I: Egg yolk proteins and
precursors
The most dominant group among the cold-induced proteins in D. pulex were the vitellogenins (Table 1). Vitellogenin (VTG) is a precursor of the yolk protein vitellin. It is
a lipoglycoprotein that is employed as a vehicle to provide
the developing embryo with proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other essential resources. In many oviparous
animals such as insects and non-mammalian vertebrates,
VTG is synthesized in extraovarian tissues (e.g. fat body or
liver) and is then transported via the blood/hemolymph
to the developing oocytes [16,17]. An exception are the
decapod crustaceans which show, in addition to the
extraovarian synthesis in the hepatopancreas, an intraovarian synthesis of yolk proteins [18]. Since the VTGs of
the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia spp. are more closely
related to insect VTGs than to the yolk protein precursors
of decapods [19-21], it is reasonable to postulate a vitellogenic tissue that is homologous to the VTG-synthesizing
fat body of insects. Although there are some cytological
indications for an endogenous synthesis of yolk proteins
in amphigonic oocytes [22], the main site of VTG synthesis in Daphnia appears to be the highly polyploid fat cells,
which exhibit periodic variations in lipid and glycogen
content, cell size and ultrastructure in relation to the parthenogenetic reproduction cycle [22-24].

The screening of the D. pulex genome database suggests 19
loci with VTG-like coding sequences. Two gene products,
VTG1 and VTG4, were identified in the present study (Figure 2). The additional expression of VTG2, however,
which shares a high sequence similarity with VTG1, cannot be excluded. VTG1 and VTG2 are homologous to the
vitellogenins DmagVTG1 and DmagVTG2 of D.magna
[25]. As in D. magna, the VTG1 and VTG2 genes are
arranged in a tandem array in a back-to-back orientation,
which might enable a coordinated hormonal regulation
of their transcription [25]. DmagVTG1 and (probably)

BMC Physiology 2009, 9:8

DmagVTG2 are the most abundant polypeptides in
D.magna parthenogenetic eggs at initial stages of development [19]. At least one of the primary cleavage sites is
present in VTG1 and VTG2 of D. pulex (Figure 2, top:
'ARRI'). Given the high sequence identity (88–90%)
between the corresponding VTGs of both Daphnia species,
it is likely that primary cleavage fragments of similar size
occur in the developing eggs of D. pulex as well. However,
none of these primary cleavage fragments could be
detected in full length (65–155 kDa) among the analyzed
spots, which contained only smaller VTG fragments of
18–27 kDa, possibly as a consequence of a residual proteolytic activity during the preparation of whole-animal
extracts. Alternatively, smaller-than-expected fragments
may have arisen prior to extract preparation by an
advanced cleavage of yolk material during embryonic
development.
The 4–7-fold up-regulation of VTGs in 10°C acclimated
D. pulex (Table 1) was an unexpected finding. About 50–
100 adult daphnids were randomly sampled irrespective
of their reproductive states for single protein extractions.
The protein extracts consequently contained contributions from parthenogenetic eggs and embryos in the
brood chamber as well as from maternal tissues. A greater
share of vitellogenin in the protein extracts from 10°C
acclimated animals may therefore result from a greater
amount of eggs in the ovaries and the brood pouch or
from an increased vitellogenin concentration in the synthesizing tissues, ovaries, eggs and embryos. An inspection of both acclimation groups did not reveal any
differences in clutch size or in the share of animals carrying eggs and embryos. Previous findings on the impact of
temperature on clutch sizes in Daphnia are ambiguous:
there were reports on lowered [9], unchanged [11] or
increased [26] clutch sizes in D. magna at lower temperatures. In this study, the protein concentration in the
extracts was quantified and the extracts were appropriately
diluted to guarantee the application of identical amounts
of protein (142 g protein) per 2D gel. Compared to the
extracts from 20°C acclimated animals, the extracts from
10°C acclimated animals had a 50% higher protein concentration. The slower growth and development of D.
pulex in the cold may possibly result in a higher concentration of whole-body protein with the VTGs particularly
contributing to this effect.
A striking feature of VTG1-VTG3 is the presence of an Nterminal superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like domain (Figure 2), which is related to the Cu/Zn SODs of prokaryotes
[25]. The catalytic activity of this class of SODs depends
on Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions, which are coordinated by six histidine residues and one aspartic residue [27]. These residues
are still present in VTG3. VTG1 and VTG2 have lost all Znbinding residues and one of the four histidine residues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/8

involved in Cu2+ binding. Functional studies on the purified yolk-protein complexes of D. magna revealed some
residual SOD activity per constituent VTG chain ( 1%, in
comparison to the activity of a bovine Cu/Zn SOD) [19].
Because of the great number of VTG loci in the D. pulex
genome and the presence of an apparently intact SOD-like
domain in VTG3 (for which EST evidence is available), it
is difficult to analyze any (residual) detoxifying capacity
of VTG1 and VTG2. Future experimental studies will be
necessary to evaluate the suggested implications of the
SOD-like domains of the Daphnia VTGs in superoxide
detoxification [19] and copper binding/transportation
[25].
Cold-induced protein sets II: Cytoskeleton and muscle
proteins
Actins were the second large set of proteins up-regulated
in the cold (Table 1). Although actins were often co-identified with VTGs during the proteomic analysis, the identification of only actin in spot 51 indicates the manifold
induction of these proteins. Actin is a highly conserved
protein. As major building block of the cytoskeleton and
the thin filaments of myofibrils, it is involved in many
important cell functions including cell motility, muscle
contraction and intracellular transport. Actin generally
occurs in multiple isoforms which are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific manner [28]. Compared to
the genomes of human, mouse, and fly, which contain six
actin loci [29], seven actin loci are present in the genome
of D. pulex (Figure 3). Four of the predicted amino acid
sequences (ACT1A, ACT1B, ACT1C, ACT1D) of D. pulex
are related to cytoplasmic actin isoforms (5C, 42A) of Drosophila melanogaster [28,30] The other three D. pulex
sequences (ACT2A, ACT2B, ACT2C) are similar to the
muscle-specific actin isoforms (57B, 79B, 87E, 88F) of
Drosophila. The ACT2C gene is very likely a pseudogene as
it lacks about 50% of the actin sequence information.
Among the putative cytoplasmic actins of D.pulex, ACT1D
possesses less conserved sequence characteristics. The
complete lack of EST support for ACT1D and ACT2C suggests that only three cytoplasmic and two muscle-specific
actin isoforms are expressed in D. pulex. Because of high
sequence identity, a discrimination between these isoforms was not possible in the present study.

Two additional muscle proteins, the heavy chain(s) of
muscle myosin (e.g. MHC-1) and a paramyosin (PMY),
were identified on the 2D gels (Table 1). These proteins
were detected in separate spots together with other proteins, which make an assessment of induction state difficult. The MHC gene of D. pulex deserves special attention
as it shares interesting features with the MHC gene of Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4) [58]. In contrast to many
complex organisms with physiologically distinct muscle
types, in which MHC isoforms are encoded by multiple

genes, at least 15 muscle MHC isoforms are expressed in
Drosophila from a single-copy gene by alternative splicing.
Many of these isoforms show tissue- or development-specific expression [29,31,32] The D. pulex genome also contains a single-copy muscle MHC gene, whose exon
structure shows similarity to the MHC gene structure of
Drosophila. Given the complexity of the MHC gene and
the, at present, only scarcely available transcript information, no conclusions can be drawn about the number and
identity of MHC isoforms in D. pulex.
In general, a reduction of ambient temperature is immediately responded by a decrease of muscular performance in
Daphnia. For example, the limb beating rate decreases
which in turn reduces the uptake of oxygen and food.
Likewise, the heart rate decreases with the consequence of
a reduced hemolymph transport of substrates [3,5,8,11].
However, the heart and limb beating rates were frequently
not much different in Daphnia species at identical ambient and acclimation temperatures of 10–12°C or 18–
20°C [3,5]. In addition, maximum swimming activity of
10°C acclimated D. magna was found to be similar to that
of 20°C acclimated animals [6]. In poikilothermic animals, the concentration of enzymes involved in cellular
metabolism frequently increases with decreasing acclimation temperatures to prevent a too strong depression of
metabolic rate (metabolic cold adaptation) [7]. Such a
type of long-term compensatory control may apply as well
to the cytoskeletal or muscular proteins to maintain a similar level of muscular performance at lower acclimation
temperatures.

Cold-repressed protein sets: Proteolytic enzymes
In the cold, different classes of enzymes mainly involved
in extracellular digestion were down-regulated. In other
words, the capacity for the digestion of proteins increased
with acclimation temperature (Table 1). The identification comprised serine peptidases of the chymotrypsin
family S1, metallo peptidases of the astacin/adamalysin
family M12, and the carboxypeptidase A family M14
(classification according to the MEROPS database) [33]. A
screening of the D. pulex genome database revealed more
than 200 loci with coding sequences for serine-peptidase
domains, 36 loci with astacin-like coding sequences, and
30 loci coding for carboxypeptidase-like domains. However, not all predicted gene products are involved in digestive processes. Serine proteases of the chymotrypsin
family, for example, are involved in multiple physiological functions such as digestion, degradation, blood clotting, immunity, and development [34]. Nevertheless, the
sheer number of peptidase genes in the D. pulex genome
indicates large-scaled gene family expansions that might
reflect specific adaptations to the lifestyle of a planktonic
filter feeder in a highly variable aquatic environment [35].

The identified serine peptidases comprised three trypsinlike proteins (TRY4B, TRY5F, TRY5L) and two chymotrypsin-like proteins (CHY1A, CHY1C). The presence of Nterminal signal and propeptide sequences classifies these
candidates as secretory proteins that are synthesized as
inactive pro-enzymes (zymogens). All sequences contain
the characteristic residues of the catalytic triade (His57,
Asp102, Ser195; Figures 5A and 6A) [59]. Substrate specificity is usually determined by three residues at the S1 site

which is a pocket adjacent to Ser195 [36]. The S1-site residues of trypsin are Asp189, Gly216 and Gly226 [37]. All
three residues are present in the detected trypsins of D.
pulex (Figure 5A). Multiple-sequence alignment (Additional Files 1, 2) and phylogenetic-tree analysis of serine
peptidase sequences from the D. pulex genome database
revealed many other trypsin-like proteins. Two of them
(TRY5F, TRY5L) together with 11 other sequences from
D.pulex form a monophyletic cluster (Figure 5B). In
CHY1A and CHY1C, the primary specificity residues comprise Ser189, Gly216 and Ala226 (Figure 6B). The first
two residues are the same as in bovine chymotrypsin [37].
At the third position, Ala226 replaces the typical Gly226.
These two residues are similar in shape and electrostatic

character, suggesting that substrate specificity is not significantly altered by this replacement. CHY1A and CHY1C
together with six additional chymotrypsin-like proteins
from D. pulex form a monophyletic cluster (Figure 6C). D.
pulex chymotrypsins are closely related to the C-type
brachyurins (MEROPS classification: S01.122), which
include the decapod chymotrypsins and collagenolytic
proteases [38-42] C-type brachyurins are characterized by
a broad substrate specificity [41]. Among the D.pulex chymotrypsins, an even enlarged range of substrate specificity
may be assumed because of the sporadic replacements of
Ser189 and Gly226 by residues of different electrostatic
properties (Figure 6B).

The MS analysis could identify and assign only those tryptic peptides which were specific for mature proteolytic
enzymes. No support was obtained for the N-terminal signal peptides, which direct the nascent proteins to the
secretory pathway, and for the pro-peptides, which shield
the active sites in the immature trypsinogens or chymotrypsinogens (Figure 5 and 6). Therefore, it can be assumed
that the proteases originated from the gut lumen, which
(in D. magna) contain the major share of proteases [43].
During the preparation of whole-animal extracts for the
present study, intestinal proteins such as proteases are
included along with those from other tissues. The pres-

ence of high amounts of proteases causes methodical
problems [12], resulting in a contribution of proteolytic
fragments to the observed protein spots. On the other
hand, the high concentration of proteases being present in
the whole-animal extracts documents a high digestive
capacity for nutritional protein resources which increases
with acclimation temperature. The marked induction of
proteases between 10°C and 20°C acclimated animals
probably reflects a higher rate of protein turnover at the
higher temperature. Between identical ambient and acclimation temperatures of 10 and 20°C, the oxygen consumption rate of D. magna increased by 30% [4] and that

of D. pulex by 60% (unpublished results). Accordingly,
the observed induction of proteolytic capacity by a factor
of 2–5 (Table 1: trypsin, chymotrypsin) may reflect at least
in parts the temperature effect on metabolic rate in acclimated D. pulex. In addition, higher needs for proteins may
arise at higher temperatures due to modifications in the
allocation and/or requirement of nutrient resources (e.g.
enlarged protein needs for growth and reproduction). Previous reports on the impact of temperature on clutch sizes
in Daphnia were ambiguous; however, a reduction of vitellogenin and protein concentration was detected in this
study between 10°C and 20°C acclimation (see Discussion above). At 20°C acclimation (in comparison to 10°C
acclimation), the higher growth rate (and possibly a
higher reproduction rate) of D. pulex and/or a faster passage of nutrients through the digestive tract with possibly
incomplete nutrient digestion and reduced assimilation
efficiency goes hand in hand with a reduced concentration of total protein and vitellogenin in the animals. These
relationships at least indicate higher demands for proteins
at 20°C acclimation, which may explain the induction of
intestinal proteases.
Miscellaneous proteins
Among the miscellaneous proteins with an unambiguous
(one spot-one protein) identification were several carbohydrate-modifying enzymes, which were either down-regulated in the cold (cellubiohydrolase, enolase) or
remained constitutively expressed (-amylase, exo--1,3glucanase), and an AAA+ ATPase, which was strongly upregulated under cold conditions. AAA+ ATPases are
molecular machines that are involved in a variety of cellular functions including vesicle transport, organelle assembly, membrane dynamics and protein unfolding [15].
They contribute to the non-destructive recycling of proteins, play an important role in protein quality control
(e.g. chaperone function), and can act as microtubule
motor proteins or microtubule-severing enzymes [15].

Conclusion
Major sets of proteins (egg yolk proteins and precursors,
cytoskeleton and muscle proteins, proteolytic enzymes)
were differentially expressed in 10°C and 20°C acclimated D. pulex. Compared to 10°C, the acclimation to
20°C was associated with a decrease of vitellogenins,
actins and even total protein concentration, as well as
with an increase of proteases. The increase of proteolytic
enzymes probably reflects a higher cellular demand for
amino acids, which may result from higher growth and
reproduction rates and/or from a lower efficiency of intestinal protein digestion/assimilation. The decrease of protein reserves (vitellogenins, actins or total protein) also
indicates an increasing bottle-neck in the amino acid supply of cells. Conversely, the acclimation to cold conditions induced an increase in protein concentration which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/8

may be related to metabolic cold adaptation, a phenomenon for which multiple physiological support exists. Metabolic cold adaptation is a compensatory mechanism
which ensures a relative constancy of metabolic rate and
muscular performance. Particularly, the increase of actins
in the cold maybe related to a compensatory control of
muscular proteins to establish a relative constancy of muscular activity and performance.

Methods
Acclimation conditions
Water fleas, Daphnia pulex, were raised in the laboratory as
described previously [12]. The animals were acclimated at
least for three weeks (mostly months) to 10°C or 20°C at
normoxic conditions (100% air saturation; oxygen partial
pressure: 20 kPa), which was obtained by mild aeration
using an aquarium pump. To guarantee an adequate
nutrient supply at each acclimation temperature, animals
were fed with green algae (Desmodesmus subspicatus) ad
libitum (>1 mg C L-1) every second day. Only adult females
were used for protein extraction.
Proteomics
Protein extraction, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
and statistical analysis of protein expression were carried
out as described previously [12]. Spots showing a sufficient size and staining intensity (relative spot volume, Vrel
> 0.1%) and differential expression between 10°C or
20°C acclimation, were excised from representative gels
and subjected to in-gel digestion using trypsin and mass
spectrometric analysis (nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) [12].
Ratios of relative spot volumes at both temperatures were
considered as induction factors. Several spots of high but
constitutive expression were also included in the analysis.
Identification and characterization of proteins
Proteins were identified by correlating the ESI-MS/MS
spectra with the "Frozen Gene Catalog" of the D. pulex
v1.1 gene builds (July, 2007) [2] using the MOWSE-algorithm as implemented in the MS search engine MASCOT
(Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) [44]. The "Frozen Gene
Catalog" contains all manual curations as of July 3, 2007
as well as automatically annotated models chosen from
the "Filtered Models" v1.1 set. "Filtered Models" is the filtered set of models representing the best gene model for
each locus. The putative function of identified proteins
was inferred by sequence homology either from the automated blastp search provided by Joint Genome Institute
[2] or from a manual blastp search provided by NCBI.
Derived protein sequences were checked for the presence
of N-terminal signal sequences using the SignalP V3.0
server [45-47]. The theoretical molecular weight (Mr) and
isolectric point (pI) of mature proteins (without N-terminal signal peptide) was calculated using the ExPASy Proteomics tool "Compute pI/MW" [48-50]. Characteristic

domains of protein families were identified using the conserved domain database (CDD) and search engine v2.13
at NCBI [51,52]. Putative N-glycosylation sites in vitellogenins were predicted using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server [53].
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple-sequence alignments were performed using the
T-Coffee algorithm [54-56]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm [57] and a
bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates.
