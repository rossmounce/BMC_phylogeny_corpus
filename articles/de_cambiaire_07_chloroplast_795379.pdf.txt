Abstract
Background: In the Chlorophyta – the green algal phylum comprising the classes Prasinophyceae,
Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae – the chloroplast genome displays a highly
variable architecture. While chlorophycean chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs) deviate considerably
from the ancestral pattern described for the prasinophyte Nephroselmis olivacea, the degree of
remodelling sustained by the two ulvophyte cpDNAs completely sequenced to date is intermediate
relative to those observed for chlorophycean and trebouxiophyte cpDNAs. Chlorella vulgaris
(Chlorellales) is currently the only photosynthetic trebouxiophyte whose complete cpDNA
sequence has been reported. To gain insights into the evolutionary trends of the chloroplast
genome in the Trebouxiophyceae, we sequenced cpDNA from the filamentous alga Leptosira
terrestris (Ctenocladales).
Results: The 195,081-bp Leptosira chloroplast genome resembles the 150,613-bp Chlorella genome
in lacking a large inverted repeat (IR) but differs greatly in gene order. Six of the conserved genes
present in Chlorella cpDNA are missing from the Leptosira gene repertoire. The 106 conserved
genes, four introns and 11 free standing open reading frames (ORFs) account for 48.3% of the
genome sequence. This is the lowest gene density yet observed among chlorophyte cpDNAs.
Contrary to the situation in Chlorella but similar to that in the chlorophycean Scenedesmus obliquus,
the gene distribution is highly biased over the two DNA strands in Leptosira. Nine genes, compared
to only three in Chlorella, have significantly expanded coding regions relative to their homologues
in ancestral-type green algal cpDNAs. As observed in chlorophycean genomes, the rpoB gene is
fragmented into two ORFs. Short repeats account for 5.1% of the Leptosira genome sequence and
are present mainly in intergenic regions.
Conclusion: Our results highlight the great plasticity of the chloroplast genome in the
Trebouxiophyceae and indicate that the IR was lost on at least two separate occasions. The
intriguing similarities of the derived features exhibited by Leptosira cpDNA and its chlorophycean
counterparts suggest that the same evolutionary forces shaped the IR-lacking chloroplast genomes
in these two algal lineages.

Background
All chloroplasts of photosynthetic eukaryotes inherited
from their cyanobacterial ancestors a reduced genome
that encodes part of the genes essential for their biogenesis. The chloroplast genome has been studied in various
algal lineages, particularly in the green algal/land plant
lineage (Viridiplantae) for which the number of complete
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences available in public
databases increases steadily. Comparative analyses of the
latter genome sequences highlight distinct evolutionary
trends in the Streptophyta and the Chlorophyta. In the
Streptophyta, the division comprising the green algae
from the class Charophyceae and all land plants, the chloroplast genome shows remarkable conservation in overall
structure, gene content, gene order and intron content
[1,2]. In contrast, considerable fluidity in chloroplast
genome organization is the hallmark of the Chlorophyta,
the division comprising the four remaining green algal
classes (Prasinophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae
and Chlorophyceae).
The chloroplast genomes from members of the Ulvophyceae (Oltmannsiellopsis viridis [3] and Pseudendoclonium akinetum [4]), Trebouxiophyceae (Chlorella vulgaris [5] and
the non-photosynthetic alga Helicosporidium sp. [6]) and
Chlorophyceae (Stigeoclonium helveticum [7], Scenedesmus
obliquus [8] and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [9]) display
various patterns of divergence compared to the ancestral
pattern described for a representative of the Prasinophyceae (Nephroselmis olivacea [10]). The cpDNA of this prasinophyte resembles most of its streptophyte homologues
in displaying small and large single-copy (SSC and LSC)
regions that are separated from one another by two identical inverted repeat regions (IR). Moreover, the set of
genes encoded by each of these three genomic regions is
almost identical in Nephroselmis and streptophyte cpDNAs. Moderate deviations from this ancestral-type architecture are seen in the two earliest-diverging lineages of
the Ulvophyceae (the orders Oltmannsiellopsidales and
Ulotrichales), supporting the hypothesis that a dozen
genes were transferred from the LSC to the SSC region and
that the rRNA operon in the IR was altered in orientation
very early during the evolution of ulvophytes [3].
Although the cpDNAs of the chlorophycean green algae
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus have also retained a
quadripartite structure, the single-copy regions of these
genomes differ extensively in gene content and both
genomes deviate radically from the ancestral gene partitioning pattern [8]. The chloroplast genomes of Chlorella
[5] and Stigeoclonium [7] as well as the plastid genome of
Helicosporidium [6] lack an IR, indicating that this repeat
was lost independently in the Trebouxiophyceae and
Chlorophyceae. Considering that loss of the IR is often
correlated with gene rearrangements [11,12], it is noteworthy that the IR-lacking cpDNA of the trebouxiophyte

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/213

Chlorella retains an almost intact pattern of ancestral gene
partitioning [3].
In Helicosporidium and the three lineages of chlorophycean green algae examined, remodelling of plastid/chloroplast genome architecture was accompanied by the
formation of long blocks of consecutive genes on the
same DNA strand [6-8,13]. For the Stigeoclonium and Helicosporidium genomes, the pattern of gene distribution
between the two DNA strands was found to be correlated
with a bias in base composition along each strand, allowing the identification of a potential origin of replication
[6,7].
The cpDNAs of ulvophyte, trebouxiophyte and chlorophycean (UTC) green algae also underwent erosion of
ancestral gene clusters, many gene losses, proliferation of
short dispersed repeats and introns as well as expansions
of intergenic spacers and proteins-coding genes [3,7]. All
photosynthetic genes were lost in the lineage leading to
the heterotrophic trebouxiophyte Helicosporidium, giving
rise to an extremely compact genome greatly reduced in
both size and gene content [6]. In addition, three
expanded genes in chlorophycean green algal cpDNAs
were split into two distinct open reading frames (ORFs);
this is the case for the rpoB genes of Stigeoclonium,
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas, for rps2 of the latter two
algae and for rpoC1 of Chlamydomonas [7]. While chlorophycean green algal cpDNAs were most affected by the
abovementioned structural changes, their ulvophyte
homologues were altered to an intermediate degree relative to the chlorophycean and Chlorella genomes [3,4].
To gain insights into the evolutionary trends of the chloroplast genome in the Trebouxiophyceae and to elucidate
the relationships among the various lineages of this class,
we undertook the complete sequencing of cpDNA from
phototrophic trebouxiophytes occupying lineages distinct
from that represented by Chlorella and Helicosporidium
(Chlorellales). We describe here the chloroplast genome
sequence of Leptosira terrestris, a filamentous alga formally
named Pleurastrum terrestre [14] and currently thought to
belong to the Ctenocladales. Even though this genome
resembles its Chlorella homologue in missing an IR, it is
considerably shuffled in gene order and displays derived
features that were previously observed in ulvophyte and/
or chlorophycean green algal cpDNAs. Our results highlight the great plasticity of the chloroplast genome in the
Trebouxiophyceae.

Results
Genomic features
The Leptosira chloroplast genome sequence assembles as a
circular molecule of 195,081 bp encoding a total of 106
genes, not counting the intron ORF and the 11 free stand-

ing ORFs (Figure 1). All genes are present in single copy.
Table 1 compares the general features of Leptosira cpDNA
with those reported for the eight other chlorophyte cpDNAs completely sequenced to date. With an overall A+T
content of 72.7%, the Leptosira genome ranks at the third
position, after Helicosporidium plastid DNA and Scenedesmus cpDNA, with respect to the abundance of these bases.
The 106 conserved genes, four introns and 11 free standing ORFs of more than 60 codons account for 48.3% of
the total genome sequence of this trebouxiophyte, with
the introns representing only 2.3% of the sequence. This
is the lowest coding density among all examined chlorophyte cpDNAs. Intergenic regions have an average size of
981 bp, a value slightly higher than those observed for Stigeoclonium (950 bp) and Chlamydomonas (941 bp) cpDNAs. All four introns belong to the group I family.
Gene content and gene expansions
The chloroplast gene repertoire of Leptosira differs from
that of Chlorella by the absence of three protein-coding
genes (chlI, ccsA and ycf12) and three tRNA genes
[trnL(gag), trnS(gga) and trnT(ggu)]. Although the latter
three genes are missing, the set of 28 tRNA species
encoded by Leptosira cpDNA is sufficient to read all
codons present in this genome. The trnL(gag) and
trnT(ggu) genes are also missing in the two ulvophyte and
three chlorophycean green algal chloroplast genomes
sequenced so far and chlI is absent from all three chlorophycean genomes: however, the ccsA and ycf12 genes have
been retained in all these genomes. Aside from Leptosira,
the trnS(gga) gene has been lost from all UTC algal cpDNAs previously investigated, except Chlorella and Stigeoclonium.

As in other UTC algal chloroplast genomes, a small fraction of the genes in Leptosira cpDNA have expanded coding regions relative to their Nephroselmis and streptophyte
homologues. Nine genes in the Leptosira genome are more
than 50% larger than their Mesostigma counterparts (cemA,
ftsH, rpl19, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, ycf1 and ycf4) compared to only three in Chlorella cpDNA (cemA, ftsH and
ycf1) [3]. In addition, for the latter three expanded genes,
we find a more important expansion factor in Leptosira
than in Chlorella.
Like its chlorophycean green algal homologues, the chloroplast rpoB gene of Leptosira consists of two separate
ORFs (rpoBa and rpoBb) that are not associated with
sequences typical of group I or group II introns (Figure 1).
As in Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus cpDNAs, these
ORFs are contiguous in Leptosira cpDNA and are separated
by stop codons. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis failed
to identify a genuine transcript encompassing both the
Chlamydomonas rpoBa and rpoBb codingregions [9]; however, distinct transcripts were found to be specific to these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/213

ORFs [9]. This result together with the observation that
the Stigeoclonium rpoBa and rpoBb are encoded by different
DNA strands and map to separate genomic loci [7] suggest
that the two ORFs are transcribed independently. The
Chlamydomonas rpoBa and rpoBb are considered to be functional genes, because no chloroplast-targeted RNA
polymerase gene could be identified in the nuclear
genome of this alga [15]. The fragmentation of rpoB in
Leptosira cpDNA and its chlorophycean homologues is
reminiscent of the well-known case of rpoC gene fragmentation in cyanobacteria and plastids (rpoC1 and rpoC2)
[16].
Figure 2 shows the results of our comparative sequence
analysis of the translated rpoB sequences from Leptosira,
the seven other photosynthetic chlorophytes whose chloroplast genome has been scrutinized, and two streptophytes. Regions displaying high sequence divergence and
significant heterogeneity in size were identified at the two
termini and at 11 internal sites. Some of the variable,
internal regions represent insertions that are unique to
one or more of the taxa examined. For example, the
sequences mapping to three sites are present only in Leptosira, whereas that corresponding to a fourth site is specific to Stigeoclonium. Blast analyses conducted during the
course of the present study revealed that the insertion
sequence of 390 amino acids at the latter site displays features typical of inteins [17]; this finding was made independently by another laboratory and documented in
InBase [17,18] under the accession name She_RPB2. The
rpoB genes of Leptosira and of the three chlorophycean
green algae are fragmented at the same site, near the junction of a conserved segment of 80 codons and a highly
variable region (ranging from 7 to 803 codons in size)
found in all taxa.
The 11 ORFs of more than 60 codons that we identified in
intergenic regions of Leptosira cpDNA failed to display any
similarity with known DNA sequences. All these ORFs differ from the conserved protein-coding genes at the levels
of codon usage and their tendency to be richer in A+T.
Gene distribution between the two DNA strands
With 78 genes occupying one strand and 28 genes the
other strand, the gene distribution over the two DNA
strands of the Leptosira genome is highly biased (Figure 1).
While a similar bias has been observed for Scenedesmus
cpDNA (77 genes on one strand and 26 genes one the
other) [8], other completely sequenced chlorophyte cpDNAs display about the same number of genes on the two
strands (Figure 3). All 78 Leptosira genes found on the
same cpDNA strand, except ycf62 and cemA, are grouped
together, forming four separate stretches containing 9 to
24 genes.

c Genes present in the IR were counted only once. Unique ORFs and intron ORFs were not taken into account.
d Because Chlorella, Helicosporidium, Leptosira and Stigeoclonium cpDNAs lack an IR, only the total size is given for each of these genomes.

previously [3, 7, 8].

Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs.
g This region was designated SC2 by de Cambiaire et al. [8] rather than SSC because it differs markedly in gene content relative to the SSC region in
Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs.
b Conserved

The propensity of adjacent genes to be located on the
same strand is a property distinguishing all UTC algal
cpDNAs, except the Chlorella genome, from Nephroselmis
and streptophyte cpDNAs. The degree to which neighbouring genes are clustered on the same strand is reported
in Figure 3 for various chlorophyte chloroplast genomes
using the sidedness index (Cs) of Cui et al. [13]. This index
was calculated using the formula Cs = (n - nSB)/(n - 1),
where n is the total number of genes in the genome and
nSB is the number of sided blocks, i.e. the number of
blocks containing adjacent genes on the same strand.
When Cs reaches the maximum value of 1, all genes are
located on one strand. In Figure 3, it can be seen that the
sidedness index of Leptosira cpDNA (Cs = 0.88) is comparable to those of most other UTC algal cpDNAs. However,
in contrast to Stigeoclonium cpDNA and Helicosporidium
plastid DNA, analyses of cumulative GC and AT skews
indicated that the coding strand bias in the Leptosira
genome is not associated with a strand bias in base composition.
Gene order
Unlike its Chlorella homologue, the Leptosira chloroplast
genome does not reveal any obvious remnant of the
ancestral gene partitioning pattern displayed by Nephroselmis and most streptophyte cpDNAs (Figure 1). However, the two trebouxiophyte genomes resemble one
another with respect to the conservation of ancestral gene
clusters (Figure 4). Leptosira cpDNA exhibits nine of the 24
ancestral clusters conserved between Mesostigma and
Nephroselmis cpDNAs as well as the remains of five other
clusters; altogether, these conserved clusters encode 53

genes. In Chlorella, 62 genes are found to be part of 11
intact and four partially conserved, ancestral clusters.
Breakage of three of the intact clusters present in Chlorella
cpDNA, further fragmentation of the four partially conserved clusters in this alga and specific retention of an
ancestral cluster [rpl20-trnD(guc] absent from the Chlorella
and other UTC cpDNAs explain the main differences
observed in the Leptosira genome. Note that these rearrangement events involved the disruption of the highly
conserved rRNA operon [rrs-trnI(gau)-trnA(ugc)-rrl-rrf]
downstream of rrs and the relocalization of this gene 62
kb away from the remaining portion of the operon.
Only two derived gene clusters, trnV(uac)-trnL(caa) and
rpl20-rps18, are shared specifically between Leptosira and
Chlorella cpDNAs. The rpl20-rps18 gene pair is also conserved in the ulvophytes Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium.
To compare the degrees of similarity in gene order
between the Leptosira and other green algal cpDNAs, we
also estimated the minimal number of gene permutations
that would be required to convert the gene order of a given
genome to that of another genome. More specifically, we
examined the orders of the 86 genes common to the cpDNAs of Leptosira, Chlorella, Nephroselmis, Oltmannsiellopsis,
Pseudendoclonium, Stigeoclonium, Scenedesmus and
Chlamydomonas using GRIMM [19]. We found that the
Leptosira and Chlorella genomes differ by as many as 53
inversions. As shown in Table 2, this level of gene rearrangements is identical to that found for the cpDNAs of
the ulvophytes Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium but

lower than those obtained for the chlorophycean algae
Stigeoclonium, Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas (59–83
inversions). Furthermore, our results showed that the
Nephroselmis, ulvophyte and chlorophycean genomes,
except Stigeoclonium cpDNA, display more similarity in
gene order with the Chlorella genome than with Leptosira
cpDNA.
Intron content
The four group I introns in Leptosira cpDNA interrupt chlL,
psaB, psbC and trnL(uaa). They fall within two different
subgroups (IA1 and IC3), with the IA1 subgroup including the three introns found in protein-coding genes. All
four introns, except that present in psbC, are positionally
and structurally homologous to previously reported
introns in chlorophyte cpDNAs (Table 3). In this context,
it is worth noting that Leptosira and Chlorella cpDNAs
share homologous introns in trnL(uaa) and chlL. The psbC
intron is unique to Leptosira and displays an ORF. The predicted protein of 415 amino acids specified by this ORF is
related to the LAGLIDADG endonucleases and contains
two copies of this motif.

Repeated sequences
Comparison of the Leptosira cpDNA sequence against
itself reveals that short repeats are present in many intergenic regions as well as in some introns and genes (predominantly expanded genes) (Figure 5). Repeats
represent 5.1% of the total genome sequence and 8.5% of
the total size of the intergenic regions. The relative abundance of these elements is therefore lower than in Chlorella cpDNA (7.8% of total genome and 14.9% of intergenic
regions) but is comparable to those observed in Scenedesmus and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs (see Table 2 in [20]).
In all other completely sequenced cpDNAs of photosynthetic UTC algae, short repeats account for more than 10%
of the genome. The longest repeated sequence in Leptosira
cpDNA is 194 bp in size, whereas the maximal size of the
Chlorella repeats is two-fold smaller (84 bp).

The most abundant repeated sequences in the Leptosira
genome consist of dispersed repeats. Analysis of these
repeats revealed two distinct groups of repeat units: repeat
unit A with sequences of 25 bp (TTYAYCTGGGCAGGGAGATYYGRTC) and repeat unit B with sequences of 18 bp

complement of an almost identical sequence, creating
imperfect palindromes. Copies of repeat unit B, in turn,
are usually associated with such palindromes to generate
larger palindromes of the type B-A-Arev-Brev, where rev
stands for reverse complement. No repeats identical to the
Leptosira repeat units A and B were detected in any other
completely sequenced UTC algal cpDNA.

features variants that differ slightly in primary sequence.
Altogether, the 81 copies of repeat unit A and the 74 copies of repeat unit B represent 1.7% of the Leptosira genome
sequence. In term of localization, a close relationship
exists between repeat units A and B. Copies of repeat unit
A are frequently found to be contiguous with the reverse

Multiple losses of the IR during the evolution of
trebouxiophytes
As in Chlorella vulgaris cpDNA and Helicosporidium plastid
DNA, we found that a rDNA-encoding IR is missing from
the Leptosira chloroplast genome. Despite the absence of
the IR in these three trebouxiophyte DNAs, there is little
doubt that the chloroplast genome from the common
ancestor of all trebouxiophytes featured a quadripartite
structure very similar to that found in streptophytes and
the prasinophyte Nephroselmis. This inference is supported
by two separate observations. First, the partially
sequenced chloroplast genome of Chlorella ellipsoidea, a
representative of the trebouxiophyte order Prasiolales,
displays a large IR, even though the latter region is atypical
in containing a disrupted rDNA operon [21]. Second, the
IR-lacking Chlorella vulgaris cpDNA retains not only a remnant of an IR in the form of a pseudo rrs gene [5] but also
the ancestral partitioning of genes displayed by prasinophyte cpDNA [3,10].

Although the divergence order of the various monophyletic groups recognized in the Trebouxiophyceae
remains ambiguous, the currently available phylogenetic
data suggest that at least two distinct events of IR loss
account for the disappearance of the IR in the three
sequenced trebouxiophyte chloroplast genomes. The Trebouxiophyceae is a morphologically diverse assemblage
that includes lichen phycobionts such as Trebouxia, freeliving planktonic or terrestrial species, secondarily nonphotosynthetic coccoid algae and picoplanktonic coccoids [22,23]. At least five distinct monophyletic lineages
are recovered with 18S rDNA data [24-27], four of which

correspond to the Trebouxiales, Microthamniales, Prasiolales and Chlorellales. Members of the Chlorellales,
which include both Chlorella vulgaris and Helicosporidium,
are consistently identified with high bootstrap support as
the earliest-diverging branch of the Trebouxiophyceae,
but the interrelationships among the remaining trebouxiophyte lineages remain ambiguous. This tree topology
supports the view that the IR was lost independently in
the Chlorellales and in the lineage leading to Leptosira.
Obviously, for the Chlorellales, a single loss event is the
most parsimonious explanation for the absence of the IR
in Chlorella vulgaris cpDNA and Helicosporidium plastid
DNA. To distinguish this scenario from the alternative
hypothesis involving two independent losses, additional
members of the Chlorellales will need to be surveyed for
the presence/absence of this repeat.
In the light of previous reports indicating that loss of the
chloroplast IR occurred relatively frequently during the
evolution of the Viridiplantae, our inference that the IR
was lost independently on at least two separate occasions
in the Trebouxiophyceae does not imply that the quadripartite structure is less unstable in this algal group than in
others. Aside from the Trebouxiophyceae, chloroplast
genomes that experienced complete or almost-complete
loss of the IR have been documented for the chlorophyte
classes Ulvophyceae [28] and Chlorophyceae [7], for the
charophycean lineage leading to the Zygnematales
[29,30] and for a number of land plants, including conifers and six tribes of legumes [31,32]. Losses of the IR in
conifers and legumes occurred independently and differed in the extent of the IR sequence lost, in the gene content of the IR prior to loss, and in the copy of the IR that
was deleted [32]. The site of deletion in pea cpDNA was
found to exhibit duplicated gene fragments, but no simple
mechanism involving recombination between these
repeats could be postulated to account for the IR loss [33].

In the present study, it was not possible to elaborate evolutionary models for the IR losses sustained by green algal
cpDNAs, because the highly variable gene organization
found in these genomes precluded inferences of gene
order in ancestral IR-containing cpDNAs. Chloroplast
genome sequences from more trebouxiophytes will thus
be required to gain deeper insight into how the IR was
deleted.
Similar evolutionary forces may have shaped the IRlacking Leptosira and Stigeoclonium chloroplast
genomes
We found that the Leptosira chloroplast genome differs
considerably from its Chlorella vulgaris counterpart not
only in gene order, but also in gene density, gene distribution between the two DNA strands and structure of some
protein-coding genes. The important changes in gene
order (Table 2) and in conservation level of ancestral gene
clusters (Figure 4) observed for these trebouxiophyte cpDNAs are not surprising, given that IR loss is generally correlated with gene rearrangements [11,12]. On the basis of
this correlation, it has been hypothesized that IR loss
enhances the frequency of intramolecular recombination
between short dispersed repeats [31]. In this context, it is
worth mentioning that no short dispersed repeats = 30 bp
with over 90% sequence identity are shared between the
intergenic regions of Leptosira and Chlorella vulgaris cpDNAs, suggesting that these elements evolved independently in these two trebouxiophyte lineages. The fact that
the Chlorella vulgaris genome displays a more ancestral
gene order than its Leptosira homologue might be due to a
more recent loss of the IR and/or a more recent proliferation of short repeats in the Chlorella vulgaris lineage.

Most intriguingly, the Leptosira chloroplast genome exhibits derived traits that are reminiscent of the evolutionary
pattern observed for ulvophyte and/or chlorophycean

Conservation of ancestral gene clusters in Leptosira and other UTC algal cpDNAs
Conservation of ancestral gene clusters in Leptosira and other UTC algal cpDNAs. Black boxes represent the 89
genes found in the 24 clusters shared by Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs as well as the genes in UTC algal cpDNAs that
have retained the same order as those in these ancestral clusters. For each genome, the set of genes making up each of the
identified clusters (either an intact or a fragmented ancestral cluster) is shown as black boxes connected by a horizontal line.
Black boxes that are contiguous but are unlinked indicate that the corresponding genes are not adjacent on the genome. Grey
boxes denote individual genes that have been relocated on the chloroplast genome; open boxes denote genes that have disappeared from the chloroplast genome. Although the rpl22 gene is missing from Nephroselmis cpDNA, it is shown as belonging to
the ribosomal protein cluster equivalent to the contiguous S10, spc and α operons of Escherichia coli because it is present in this
cluster in the cpDNAs of Mesostigma, streptophytes and algae from other lineages. Note also that the psbB cluster of Pseudendoclonium differs from the ancestral cluster by the presence of psbN on the alternate DNA strand.

cpDNAs. These derived traits were identified in the course
of analyzing the following genomic features: (1) gene distribution over the two DNA strands, (2) gene density and
(3) expansion and structure of protein-coding genes. The
Leptosira chloroplast genes display a highly biased and
asymmetrical distribution pattern over the two DNA
strands, which most closely matches that observed for the
chloroplast genome of the chlorophycean green alga
Scenedesmus (Figure 3). The strong propensity of adjacent
genes to be located on the same DNA strand in Leptosira
cpDNA also mirrors the gene distribution patterns found
in the chloroplast/plastid genomes of the two other chlo-

rophyceans
investigated
(Stigeoclonium
and
Chlamydomonas), the ulvophytes Oltmannsiellopsis and
Pseudendoclonium and the trebouxiophyte Helicosporidium.
With regard to gene density, Leptosira cpDNA is currently
known to be the most loosely packed chlorophyte
genome (Table 1), followed by the Chlamydomonas and
Stigeoclonium cpDNAs. The chloroplast genes exhibiting
expanded coding regions relative to their Nephroselmis and
streptophyte homologues are three-times more abundant
in Leptosira than in Chlorella vulgaris, with the Leptosira set
of nine expanded genes being more similar to those found
in ulvophyte genomes with respect to coding content. In

contrast to the conventional structure observed for rpoB in
Chlorella vulgaris and ulvophytes, the Leptosira rpoB gene is
fractured at the same site as that found for the fragmented
genes of the three analyzed chlorophycean green algae
(Figure 2). Therefore, two separate events of gene fragmentation, one occurring in the Leptosira lineage and the
other before the emergence of the three chlorophycean
groups examined so far, must be postulated to account for
the distribution of the split rpoB structure among UTC
algae.
From the similarities described above, it is tempting to
propose that the same evolutionary forces shaped the IRlacking chloroplast genomes in trebouxiophyte and chlorophycean lineages. However, considering the extraordinary fluidity of the chloroplast genome structure in the
Chlorophyceae and the fact that no IR-containing chloroplast genomes from close relatives of Leptosira and Stigeoclonium have been investigated, it remains uncertain
whether the common trends identified here are directly
linked with the convergent events of IR loss that occurred
in these chlorophyte lineages. For the Streptophyta, more
specifically the zygnematalean lineages leading to Staurastrum and Zygnema, there exists convincing evidence that
IR loss from the chloroplast genome was correlated with
the expansion of intergenic regions and extensive gene
rearrangements [30]. Indeed, the low degree of compaction, the highly scrambled gene order and the numerous
disrupted ancestral clusters observed in the Staurastrum
and Zygnema genomes contrast sharply with the short
intergenic spacers and with the extraordinary conservation of gene order and ancestral clusters exhibited by all
their homologues in other streptophyte lineages.

Conclusion
The numerous derived features that we report here for the
IR-lacking Leptosira chloroplast genome contrast sharply
with the pronounced degree of ancestral features displayed by Chlorella vulgaris cpDNA, a trebouxiophyte
genome also missing a rDNA-encoding IR. The close
resemblance of the Leptosira genome with its ulvophyte
and/or chlorophycean homologues with respect to the
pattern of gene distribution, gene density and structure of
protein-coding genes was also an unanticipated finding.
On the basis of the current knowledge regarding the phylogeny of trebouxiophytes and the distribution of the
presence/absence of the IR in the chloroplast genome, we
conclude that the IR was lost independently in the Chorellales and the Leptosira lineage. The intriguing similarities
between the derived features exhibited by the Leptosira
chloroplast genome and those of its chlorophycean counterparts might suggest that the same evolutionary forces
shaped the IR-lacking chloroplast genomes in the Leptosira
and chlorophycean lineages. To test this hypothesis and
better understand the dynamics of IR loss, IR-containing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/213

chloroplast genomes from close relatives of Leptosira and
Stigeoclonium will need to be investigated.

Methods
Isolation and sequencing of Leptosira cpDNA
Leptosira terrestris (formally Pleurastrum terrestre Fritsch et
John) was obtained from the University of Texas Algal
Culture collection (UTEX 333) and grown in modified
Volvox medium [34] under 12 h light-dark cycles. An A+T
rich fraction containing cpDNA was isolated and
sequenced as previously described [35]. Sequences were
assembled and edited with SEQUENCHER 4.2 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Harbor, MI). The fully annotated
genome sequence has been deposited in [GenBank:EF506945].
Sequence analyses
Genes were identified by BLAST searches [36] against the
nonredundant database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information server (NCBI) [37]. Positions of
ORFs and protein coding genes were determined using
ORFFINDER at NCBI, programs of the GCG Wisconsin
package (version 10.3) (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA)
and applications from the EMBOSS version 2.9.0 package
[38]. Gene coding for tRNAs were localized with tRNAscan-SE 1.23 [39]. The RpoB sequences were aligned using
ClustalW 1.82 [40]. Repeated sequences were identified
with PipMaker [41] and REPuter 2.74 [42]. Repeats were
sorted with REPEATFINDER [43] and the retrieved classification was refined manually. Numbers of SDR units
were determined with FINDPATTERNS of the GCG Wisconsin package version 10.3. The total length of genome
sequences containing repeated elements was estimated
with RepeatMasker [44] running under the WU-BLAST 2.0
search engine [45]. Separate files containing the concatenated sequences of the intergenic regions of Leptosira and
Chlorella cpDNAs were produced to search for the presence of shared repeated elements = 30 bp with up to 10%
mismatches using the -d -p -l 30 -e 3 -seedlength 10 -q -v
options of V match [46]. The results of this analysis were
visualized using GenAlyzer 0.81b [47].
Analyses of genome rearrangements
The GRIMM web server [19] was used to infer the minimal
number of gene permutations by inversions in pairwise
comparisons of chloroplast genomes. For these analyses,
genes within one of the two copies of the IR were excluded
from the data set and only the genes common to all compared genomes were analyzed. The data set used in the
comparative analyses reported in Table 2 contained 86
genes; the three exons of the trans-spliced psaA and rbcL
genes, the two exons of the trans-spliced psaC and petD
genes, as well as the rpoBa and rpoBb genes, were coded as
distinct fragments (for a total of 93 loci).
