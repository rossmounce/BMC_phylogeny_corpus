Abstract
Background: Phage jIBB-PF7A is a T7-like bacteriophage capable of infecting several Pseudomonas fluorescens
dairy isolates and is extremely efficient in lysing this bacterium even when growing in biofilms attached to
surfaces. This work describes the complete genome sequence of this phage.
Results: The genome consists of a linear double-stranded DNA of 40,973 bp, with 985 bp long direct terminal
repeats and a GC content of approximately 56%. There are 52 open reading frames which occupy 94.6% of the
genome ranging from 137 to 3995 nucleotides. Twenty eight (46.7%) of the proteins encoded by this virus exhibit
sequence similarity to coliphage T7 proteins while 34 (81.0%) are similar to proteins of Pseudomonas phage gh-1.
Conclusions: That this phage is closely related to Pseudomonas putida phage gh-1 and coliphage T7 places it in
the “T7-like viruses” genus of the subfamily Autographivirinae within the family Podoviridae. Compared to the
genome of gh-1, the sequence of jIBB-PF7A is longer and contains more genes with unassigned function and
lacks a few potentially essential and non-essential T7 genes, such as gene1.1, 3.8, and 7.

Background
Formerly, the phylogenetic and taxonomic classification
of bacteriophages (phages) was based on similarities in
phage morphology, host range [1], ability to recombine,
and also on similar cross-hybridization patterns of their
DNAs [2-4]. Today, phage genome sequencing is commonly performed for classification and characterization
purposes and is based on the arrangement of conserved
genes and the nucleotide and protein sequence identity
[5,6]. A specific group of phages has a number of conserved proteins but also a relatively high number of proteins for which no match occurs in the current
databases. This reveals the great genetic diversity existent within phages. Of the total global estimated phage
population (> 10 31 ), only a small number have been
completely sequenced.
In the last few years, a large number of T7-like phages
have been sequenced most of which have been gathered
in a new viral subfamily within the family Podoviridae.

The Autographivirinae was formerly referred to as the
T7 supergroup of phages [7]. All these phages, most of
which have members of the Enterobacteriaceae as their
host, present a highly conserved genome organization
and mainly differ at sequence level through the presence
or absence of nonessential genes [8]. Phages presenting
more similarities to each other are grouped in genera
within the Autographivirinae, namely the “T7-like
viruses”, the “SP6-like viruses” and the “phiKMV-like
viruses”. The genome of coliphage T7 has 56 genes
encoding potential proteins [8], of which 35 have known
function or functions. In addition, there are 25 nonessential proteins, of which only 12 are conserved across
the genus “T7-like viruses” [8].
In this manuscript we report on the full genomic
characterization of Pseudomonas fluorescens phage
jIBB-PF7A, a phage capable of infecting several dairy
P. fluorescens isolates including isolates belonging to different ribotypes [9]. On the basis of TEM micrographs
this virus resembled T7-like phages with a head diameter of about 63 nm and a noncontractile tail size
approximately 13 × 8 nm. In terms of growth cycle,
phage jIBB-PF7A has a latent period of 15 minutes, an
eclipse period of 10 minutes and a burst size of 153

plaque forming units per infected cell. Furthermore, this
phage has been the focus of several recent studies lysing
efficiently its host present in single [10] and dual species
biofilms [11]. Moreover, jIBB-PF7A is the first reported
phage capable of efficiently infecting elongated P. fluorescens cells - which are up to 10 times longer than normal sized cells - and killing planktonic stationary
(3 days old) phase cells [9]. For these reasons, a more
detailed characterization was desired in order to further
increase our knowledge about this particular lytic phage.

Results and Discussion
This work focuses on the determination of the complete
genome sequence of the P. fluorescens phage jIBBPF7A. This virus is the first T7-like bacteriophage for
P. fluorescens for which the genome has been determined.
jIBB-PF7A nucleotide sequence and general sequence
properties

The DNA sequence of phage jIBB-PF7A was determined and it consists of linear double-stranded DNA of
40,973 bp. The size of this phage correlates well with
other T7-like phage members, where the smallest and
largest phages reported so far are the Pseudomonas
putida phage gh-1 (37.4 kb) and the Vibrio parahaemolyticus phage VpV262 (45.9 kb), respectively [12]. The
redundant terminal repeats (DTR) of jIBB-PF7A are
unusually long (985 bp) for member of the T7 group
(T7 has DTRs of only 160 bp [13]) and, up till now, the
genome of P. aeruginosa phage LKD16 had the longest
DTRs (428 bp) [14]. Phage jIBB-PF7A has an overall
genomic guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of 56.3%,
well within the range of GC contents observed in other
T7-like phages (46.2 - 62.3%) [15].
The genome of jIBB-PF7A was scanned for open
reading frames (ORFs) of 100 bp or longer using computational software complemented with visual inspection
of the genome sequence. The search resulted in 52 predicted genes with lengths ranging from 137 to 3995 nt.
The initiation codon of 92% of the protein-coding genes
is ATG and only four other ORFs, including RNA

Page 2 of 6

polymerase (gene1) and the packaging protein B
(gene19), start with GTG. The temporal and functional
distributions of genes are tightly organized and packed
close to each other so that they occupy 94.6% of the
entire nucleotide sequence.
Comparative genomics of phage jIBB-PF7A

All predicted protein-coding genes were screening using
BLASTP against the non-redundant protein database at
NCBI. From the 52 ORFs of jIBB-PF7A: i) 25 (48.1%)
have assigned function; ii) 12 (23.1%) are similar to proteins of unknown function in the nonredundant databases and (iii) 15 (28.8%) code for hypothetical proteins
unique to this bacteriophage. While the great majority
(34) of the homologs is to proteins of Pseudomonas
phage gh-1, examples of primary sequence similarity to
Pseudomonas phages phi-2 and LKA1, coliphage T3,
Yersinia phage YeO3-12, Vibrio phage ICP3_2008_A
and Kluyvera phage Kvp1 exist. With the exceptions of
Pseudomonas phage LKA1 which is a member of the
“phiKMV-like viruses,” all of these phages are members
of the “T7-like viruses” genus. Since 28 gene products
were related to T7 phage proteins, the T7 gene nomenclature was adopted for these genes (Additional file 1,
Table S1). No function can be speculated about the
hypothetical proteins of phage jIBB-PF7A without
further study. Based upon overall protein homology
determined using CoreGenes [16,17] this virus shares 28
(47%), 11 (21%) and 10 (20%), similar proteins with
phages T7, SP6 and KMV, respectively. These results
indicate that it is a member of the Autographivirinae,
specifically a member of the “T7-like viruses” genus [7].
At the protein level jIBB-PF7A showed the greatest
sequence identity with proteins of phage gh-1, and therefore the gene clustering of the two phages was compared
(Figure 1). Unlike P. putida phage gh-1, which presents
no putative genes before gene 1, in jIBB-PF7A we
observed six unique hypothetical proteins of which two
(orf1 and orf2) are part of the 985 bp long DTR. Furthermore, these first six ORFs do not display sequence similarity to any of the T7 genes between gene0.3 and

gene0.7. Compared to gh-1, phage jIBB-PF7A also lacks
gene 1.1, a gene with unknown function.
Despite the different host ranges of P. fluorescens
phage jIBB-PF7A and P. putida phage gh-1, there are
34 phage proteins which show significant sequence
identity (Figure 1). As pointed out above, phage gh-1
belongs to the same viral genus as jIBB-PF7A and its
sequence is linear double-stranded DNA of 37,359 bp
with 216 bp direct terminal repeats, and has 43 predicted putative genes.
A Mauve alignment [16,18] of phage jIBB-PF7A DNA
against the genomes of gh-1, T3 and T7 show the
regions of DNA sequence similarity (colored areas)
interspersed with regions (white) where no sequence
similarity exists (Additional file 2; Figure S1).
DNA penetration

The genes essential of forming the channel which allows
the phage DNA injection into the hosts’ cytoplasm are
all present in phage jIBB-PF7A, namely gene14, gene15
and gene16.
jIBB-PF7A gene arrangement
A. Early gene expression

The early genes of this type of virus are transcribed by the
host RNA polymerase. The transcribed genes include genes
which function to overcome host restriction and to convert
the metabolism of the host cell to the production of phage
proteins, e.g. synthesis of the phage promoter-specific RNA
polymerase (RNAP; gene1). Two host-type promoters were
discovered (Additional file 3; Table S2). Interestingly, the
early region of this phage contains six ORFs, two of which
are in the LTR, which show no sequence similarity at the
DNA or protein level to the early genes of any other member of the Autographivirinae. Indeed, this is the first report
for the existence of putative ORFs within the terminal
repeats of a member of this subfamily, though they are
found in phages such as T5 and SPO1. jIBB-PF7A does
not encode the T7-like Gp0.3 (ocr), 0.6 or 0.7 homologs.
B. Middle gene expression

The class II genes are transcribed by the phage RNAP
and are involved in DNA replication. Both phages jIBBPF7A and gh-1 lack several class II genes present in T7,
namely: gene1.4, gene1.5, gene1.6, gene1.7, gene1.8,
gene3.2, gene3.7, gene4.3, and gene5.5. Most of these
class II genes are nonessential and only gene1.7 is considered an essential gene and reportedly is beneficial for
phage growth [8]. Besides the genes not present in both
jIBB-PF7A and gh-1, jIBB-PF7A is also missing the
nonessential homing endonuclease (gene3.8).

Page 3 of 6

T7-like phages are also present in jIBB-PF7A (Additional file 1, Table S1). Phage jIBB-PF7A is only missing
gene7, a nonessential protein which is usually involved in
host range [8]. Compared to gh-1, phage jIBB-PF7A has
more ORFs situated just before the right DTR (Figure 1).
We have identified two ORFs which display sequence
similarity to the major capsid proteins of phages belonging to the “T7-like viruses.” The upstream gene displays
homology to the capsid gene of Yersinia phage YeO312 while the downstream gene is similar to the analogous
protein in P. putida phage gh-1. That these two genes
might be coexpressed as a single fusion protein is suggested by the presence of a slippery site (GTTATCGAAAAGGCGTAA) which is translated as VIEKA(stop);
but could be extended, via -1 frameshifting, into
VIEKgvsvpdp...(stop). While a diagnostic pseudoknot was
discovered immediately downstream of the potential slippery site [19-22] there is no proteomic evidence for frameshifting in this bacteriophage [9]. The structural
proteome of this phage is therefore made up of gene10A
(capsid), the connector gene8, and a conspicuous core
made by the proteins gene14, gene15, and gene16 [23].
Phage jIBB-PF7A contains gene16, the internal virion
protein D, which contains peptidoglycan hydrolase
motif. This activity is essential for enlarging a hole
across the cell wall of cells when hosts are infected at
low temperatures [8]. Possibly, due to the presence of
this protein phage jIBB-PF7A showed a high efficiency
towards mature biofilms [10].
Lysis genes

Endolysins are muralytic enzymes produced by dsDNA
phages which hydrolyze the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. As in T7 phages, gene3.5 of jIBB-PF7A is
proposed to be the endolysin-like protein which possesses
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity, but is
apparently not essential for lysis (I. Molineux, personal
communication). The access of endolysins to the cell wall
occurs through the presence of a secondary lysis factor
known as holin. The small membrane protein derived
from gene17.5 of jIBB-PF7A is proposed as holin and it
showed highest sequence similarity to Morganella phage
MmP1 lysis protein. Phage jIBB-PF7A has also one more
lysis gene, the l Rz-like lysis protein (gene18.5) which presents a 34% sequence identity to the homologous protein
in phage gh-1. The proteins of phage jIBB-PF7A was
scanned for transmembrane helices using TMHMM. A
total of six ORFS contain transmembrane helices (TMD,
orf2, gene17.5, gene18.5, gene19, and gene19.5, and orf52),
with only one (gene17.5) presenting two TMD.

C. Late gene expression

The late genes or class III genes are transcribed by the
phage RNAP and are mostly involved in morphogenesis
and host lysis. The majority of putative genes found in

Putative regulatory elements

No tRNA genes were predicted in the jIBB-PF7A genome using tRNAscan-SE. Several potential putative

Sillankorva et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:142
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/142

promoters were identified in the DNA sequence of
jIBB-PF7A, using PHIRE and BPROM (Additional file
3, Table S2). Using strict criteria for the assignment of
host promoter sites, i.e. that four out of the six bp in
the -10 and -35 regions be conserved, two host-dependent promoters were discovered. These are both located
in orf4. We have been unable to definitively assign promoters to earlier ORFs.
In all T7 group phages, the phage RNA polymerase
(RNAP) is responsible for the recognition of phagespecific promoters. In phage jIBB-PF7A, we identified
12 phage RNAP specific promoters (Additional file 3,
Table S2) which are named according to the downstream gene. Eleven promoters were identified which
show remarkable sequence conservation with a consensus of taAAAtmCCCTCACCwrAAcAGGGa (Figure 2).
Interestingly the consensus sequence is 1 bp longer than
that for the other members of this genus.
The promoter sequences all lie in intergenic regions
and show the greatest sequence similarity to those of
coliphage T3 (Additional file 3, Table S2). The specificity of the RNAP is determined by the positions -10 and
-11 and it is the position -2 that establishes the promoter strength [24]. The highest relative utilization of the
promoter is observed when there is a T at the -2 position. Phage jIBB-PF7A may have lower promoter utilization since there is not a T positioned at -2.
Nonetheless, the promoter positions -10 and -11 are
identical to the consensus sequence of T3 and SP6 (C s,
respectively). In phage jIBB-PF7A, seven of the promoters were found to be present in identical places as in
phage T7: j1, j2.5, j6.5, j9, j10A, j17and j19.5,
respectively. The promoter sequences which were found
in analogous genomic positions to the ones in T7 suggest that the regulation of phage mRNA synthesis is
well conserved within the group.
FindTerm, RibEx and TransTerm programs were used
to search for transcriptional terminators. T7 and gh-1

Page 4 of 6

phages have three terminators identified while phage
jIBB-PF7A has only one rho-independent terminator
downstream of gene10 (22995 to 23040) which suggest
the presence of the Tø2 terminators (named T Late1
in phage gh-1). Downstream of gene1.3 is a sequence
(gccctgtaccttgcagggc) which exhibits a ΔG of -11.60 kcal/
mol. While this sequence is identically placed to the rhoindependent terminator of most T7-like phages it lacks
the classical polyT tail.
Summarizing, the genome sequencing of jIBB-PF7A
showed similarity to “T7-like viruses” of the subfamily
Autographivirinae and allowed the recognition of a new
subgroup consisting, so far, of only phages jIBB-PF7A
and gh-1.

Methods
Bacteria and bacteriophage jIBB-PF7A

The bacterium used (P. fluorescens PF7) was isolated
from a dairy industry (Estação Experimental, Paços de
Ferreira, Portugal), identified using the API 20NE panel
(BioMérieux S.A., France), and grown at 30°C in Tryptic
Soy Broth (TSB, Fluka) or TSB agar plates for bacteriophage propagation. Bacteriophage jIBB-PF7A was isolated from raw sewage and has been previously
characterized according to morphology, growth cycle
and other parameters [9].
Bacteriophage jIBB-PF7A propagation

For phage amplification, the plate lysis and elution
method described by Sambrook & Russell [25] was used
with some modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of phage (1 × 103
PFU ml-1) and 1 ml of overnight grown host were mixed
with 30 ml of TSB soft agar (TSB + 0.6% agar) and added
to 250 ml T-flasks with a thin layer of TSA media. The
soft-agar layer was allowed to solidify and the flasks were
incubated at 30°C for 7 h. The phage particles were subsequently eluted with SM buffer and concentrated with
PEG 8000, and then extracted with chloroform. Samples
in SM buffer were stored at 4°C until further use.
DNA isolation

Phage DNA was isolated using a Wizard Lambda Preps
DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Phage jIBB-PF7A DNA was sheared with a nebulizer.
Following 1% agarose gel electrophoresis overnight electrophoresis at 30 V, fractions with sizes between 1 and
4 kb were cut from the gels and the DNA purified. The
ends were repaired, the fragments were ligated overnight, at 16°C, into pZero cloning vector (Zero background/Kan cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
previously digested with EcoRV, and transformed into

chemically competent One Shot® TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The cells were recovered in SOC medium, incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 225 rpm (Titramax plate
shaker, Heidolph Elektro GmbH & Co. KG, Kelheim,
Germany) and plated onto LB-Kan plates containing XGal. Selected clones were picked with a Genetix QPix2
robotic colony picker (Genetix Corp., Boston, MA) and
grown overnight in LB medium at 37°C and 225 rpm.
The cultures were centrifuged and plasmid DNA was
extracted. For sequencing, Big Dye chemistry was used
and the sequencing was carried out in ABI 3700 DNA
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence reads were
assembled using GAP4 (Staden package software) and
the sequences were assembled into contigs [26].
Several frameshift errors were corrected, through a
primer-walking technique with 20-mer oligonucleotide
primers and pure jIBB-PF7A DNA with the amplicons
being sequenced.

ORF prediction and annotation

Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) was performed using GeneMark.hmm, OrfFinder and Kodon
(Applied Maths, Austin, TX). For tRNA gene identification, the tRNAscan-SE program was used [27].
Translated ORFs were compared with known protein
sequences using BLASTP, against the non-redundant
protein GenBank database. To tease out function conserved hypothetical proteins were also analyzed by
HHPred at http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred.
