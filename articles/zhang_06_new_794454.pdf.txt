Abstract
Background: Although the biosynthetic pathways for anthocyanins and their regulation have been
well studied, the mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in the cell is still poorly understood.
Different models have been proposed to explain the transport of anthocyanins from biosynthetic
sites to the central vacuole, but cellular and subcellular information is still lacking for reconciliation
of different lines of evidence in various anthocyanin sequestration studies. Here, we used light and
electron microscopy to investigate the structures and the formation of anthocyanic vacuolar
inclusions (AVIs) in lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum) petals.
Results: AVIs in the epidermal cells of different regions of the petal were investigated. Three
different forms of AVIs were observed: vesicle-like, rod-like and irregular shaped. In all cases, EM
examinations showed no membrane encompassing the AVI. Instead, the AVI itself consisted of
membranous and thread structures throughout. Light and EM microscopy analyses demonstrated
that anthocyanins accumulated as vesicle-like bodies in the cytoplasm, which themselves were
contained in prevacuolar compartments (PVCs). The vesicle-like bodies seemed to be transported
into the central vacuole through the merging of the PVCs and the central vacuole in the epidermal
cells. These anthocyanin-containing vesicle-like bodies were subsequently ruptured to form threads
in the vacuole. The ultimate irregular AVIs in the cells possessed a very condensed inner and
relatively loose outer structure.
Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest the existence of mass transport for anthocyanins from
biosynthetic sites in the cytoplasm to the central vacuole. Anthocyanin-containing PVCs are
important intracellular vesicles during the anthocyanin sequestration to the central vacuole and
these specific PVCs are likely derived directly from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a similar manner
to the transport vesicles of vacuolar storage proteins. The membrane-like and thread structures of
AVIs point to the involvement of intravacuolar membranes and/or anthocyanin intermolecular
association in the central vacuole.

Background
Anthocyanins are a large subclass of flavonoid pigments
[1] that provide important functions in plants and are also
of significance to agriculture and commerce [2]. Their biosynthetic pathway, a branch of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, has been extensively characterized, and there is also
a good understanding of the transcriptional regulation of
the structural enzyme genes [3-5]. Furthermore, they are
one of the few groups of secondary metabolites for which
there are data on the sub-cellular nature of the biosynthetic enzyme complex and the subsequent transport of
the phytochemical product to the site of accumulation.
Anthocyanins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, likely by
a multienzyme complex anchored on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the cytochrome P450 enzymes that are part
of the complex [6,7]. Once formed, the anthocyanins are
transported from the cytoplasm into the vacuole, an acidic
environment in which anthocyanins can accumulate to
high levels, and in which they assume a brightly colored
chemical structure [7]. Although there has been progress
from molecular studies in deciphering the molecular
requirement of the transport process to the vacuole, this is
the least understood stage of the biosynthetic pathway at
cellular and sub-cellular levels.
There is evidence from several species for a number of
alternative transport routes relating to intracellular transport of the flavonoids, with anthocyanins being possible
targets for only some of these. Some members of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family have been found to be
necessary for anthocyanin sequestration into the vacuole
[8-11]. Although a mechanism similar to xenobiotic
detoxification processes was proposed for anthocyanins
[8], specifically addition of glutathione residues by GST to
form stable water-soluble conjugates and the sequestration of these conjugates by ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transmembrane transporters, no anthocyanin-glutathione
conjugates have been observed in vivo. Instead, the GST
works as an anthocyanin-binding protein that may escort
anthocyanins from the synthetic site to the tonoplast [12].
A second possible transport route is via multidrug and
toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters located in
the tonoplast membrane. Mutant analysis has suggested
the involvement of a MATE transporter for proanthocyanins in Arabidopsis [13], anthocyanins in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, [14]) and maize (Zea mays, [15]).
A third aspect of proanthocyanin/anthocyanin transport
is the coordination of the transport process with vacuole
biogenesis, and the involvement of vesicles. Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) suspension cell lines of maize transformed with maize anthocyanin transcription factor
transgenes produce high levels of phytochemicals, and
also trigger the production of autofluorescent vesicles that
are transported into vacuoles [16,17]. Furthermore, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/29

tds4 mutation of Arabidopsis, that prevents anthocyanidin synthase activity and inhibits proanthocyanin production, prevents normal vacuole development and causes
accumulation of small vesicles [18]. This effect is not seen
with mutations affecting other enzymes in the proanthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, implying a link between
proanthocyanin biosynthesis and vacuole development.
Thus, one possibility is that the major vacuole in a pigmented cell may grow by small anthocyanin-containing
pro-vacuolar vesicles being formed at the site of anthocyanin biosynthesis, which then bud off the ER and fuse
with the tonoplast.
With regard to the fate of the anthocyanins after transport
to the central vacuole, a number of different forms of
anthocyanin accumulation have been observed with light
microscopy: an evenly colored solution, vesicle-like bodies and dense, compact bodies of either regular or irregular shape. Some of the anthocyanin-concentrated bodies
in cells were originally suggested as sites of anthocyanin
biosynthesis, and termed anthocyanoplasts [19]. However, upon their further characterization they have been
given the name Anthocyanic Vacuolar Inclusions (AVIs)
[20]. AVIs have been found in a wide range of angiosperm
species [19], without any obvious phylogenetic association. The most studied vesicle-like AVIs are those observed
in suspension cell cultures of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and maize. In sweet potato, the vesicle-like AVIs usually start as a large number of smaller vesicles that
gradually fuse into a small number of larger vesicles [21].
No boundary membrane has been observed for these
sweet potato AVIs [22]. However, specific proteins have
been found associated with the AVIs [22].
AVIs in petals of lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum) and carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) have been reported to be
non-vesicle, dense and compact bodies, which can be isolated from the plant as particles [20]. It was reported that
the AVIs of lisianthus do not have a surrounding membrane, but, as with sweet potato, may have protein components that are involved in selectively binding specific
anthocyanin structures. The association of anthocyanins
with AVIs in lisianthus is also thought to shift the perceived petal color [20].
In this study, we report on the further characterization of
the AVIs of lisianthus. Using a combination of light
microscopy, TEM and SEM the structural aspects of AVIs in
planta and as isolated particles have been studied, and evidence obtained for their formation from ER-derived vesicles.

Results
Forms of AVIs in different petal regions
The petals of lisianthus have a dark inner throat region
and a lighter colored outer region, with anthocyanins
present in both the abaxial and adaxial epidermal cells.
The shape difference of AVIs between the outer and inner
petal regions of lisianthus flowers was noted by previous
researchers [20]. In this study, we investigated the form
variations of AVIs in the epidermal cells located at different regions of lisianthus petals. Microscopic examination
of the unstained transverse sections under bright field
showed that not only are the AVI forms in the adaxial epidermis different between the outer and inner petal
regions, but also the AVI forms differ more greatly in the
adaxial epidermal cells than in the abaxial epidermal cells
of the same inner petal region (Fig. 1A). The dark brownish color that remained in the epidermal cells of the transverse sections provided a good marker to recognize the
anthocyanin-containing structures.

In the adaxial epidermis (Fig. 1A and 1B), the brownish
AVIs in the central vacuoles displayed irregular forms,
sizes and even appeared as separated masses in transverse
sections. These AVI structures did not appear to be highly
organized and seemed to have loose 'fuzzy' structures
(Fig. 1B), with the main AVI body occurring towards the
centre of the main vacuoles. Around this loose structure, a
highly colored band was apparent in most AVI-containing
adaxial epidermal cells (Fig. 1A). The AVIs in the freshly
peeled adaxial epidermis (Fig. 1C) of the inner petal
showed intensely colored AVIs in the main vacuoles and
very uneven surfaces of these AVIs were observed from the
top under a bright field microscope (Fig. 1C), again displaying loose structures of the anthocyanin-containing
deposits.
Protoplasts generated from adaxial epidermal cells of
inner petals displayed more dispersed AVIs than were
apparent in the epidermal peel (Fig. 2A), clearly showing
irregular-shaped anthocyanin-containing deposits of the
AVI. Interestingly, these AVI-containing protoplasts were
rigid, tending to maintain their original cell shape. No cell
walls were evident under fluorescent microscopic examination of these rigid protoplasts, as cell walls would have
given clear cellular borders under the UV lighting condition used (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the protoplasts generated from the adaxial epidermis of the inner petal region
also contained functional chloroplasts as revealed by red
auto-fluorescence emitted from chlorophyll (Fig. 2B).
AVIs in the abaxial epidermal cells of the inner petal
region were vesicle-like bodies of varying sizes (Fig. 1D
and 1E). The protoplasts generated from these abaxial epidermal cells were round with a large colored vacuole and
vesicle-like AVIs scattered in the vacuole and cytoplasm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/29

(Fig. 2C). Occasionally, anthocyanin-containing deposits
similar to those observed in the adaxial cells were also
seen in these abaxial protoplasts (Fig. 2C). Chloroplasts
were also present in these abaxial protoplasts as shown by
the red autofluorescence (Fig. 2D).
The protoplasts generated from adaxial cells of the outer
petal region had a round shape with a large colored vacuole (Fig. 2E). Single barbed rod-like AVIs were present in
each of the highly colored vacuoles of the protoplast (Fig.
2E). No chloroplasts were observed in these protoplasts
(Fig. 2F).
Topographic features of AVIs
To understand more about the organization of AVIs in
lisianthus petals, we examined them using bright field
light microscopy and SEM. At high magnification under
bright field, the surfaces of the AVIs in adaxial epidermal
cells appeared as a collection of irregular colored deposits
and strands that were tangled in the central space of the
vacuole (Fig. 3A). The pink area surrounding the AVI
appeared to have a higher anthocyanin concentration
around membrane-like structures weaving through the
area (Fig. 3A). These pink areas became colorless in most
cells as the petals further developed. Although the shape
of the AVIs was different in outer petal regions than in the
inner region, the AVI surfaces were similar (Fig. 3A and
3B). This tangled structure of colored deposits and strands
was also apparent for the AVIs isolated from the adaxial
epidermis of lisianthus inner petal and placed in water
(Fig. 3C). All these examinations of AVIs, both in live cells
and as isolated particles, failed to show any evidence of a
membrane surrounding the entire AVI.

The surface of isolated lisianthus AVIs was further analyzed using SEM (Fig. 3DâG). Acetone was found unable
to dissolve lisianthus AVIs in the preliminary experiments
and therefore was used to briefly remove water from the
AVI preparations prior to SEM. The physical nature of the
AVIs was a loose and porous body consisting of irregular
granules, strands and sheets (Fig. 3D and 3E). The morphology of the isolated AVIs under SEM appeared to
involve membranous networks that folded as boluses
(Fig. 3D and 3E). At higher magnification under SEM,
these lisianthus AVIs displayed a structure resembling a
coral reef (Fig. 3F and 3G), with rough granular or sandy
surfaces.
Internal structures and formation of AVIs
To elucidate the internal structures of AVIs, light and TEM
examinations were carried out on transverse micro-sections. When the 1 Î¼m sections of the isolated AVIs were
stained with Toluidine Blue for light microscopy, bluecolored networks were revealed (Fig. 4A). These networks
were unevenly distributed, with some areas being denser

TEM examinations of in planta AVIs of adaxial epidermal
cells revealed similar structures as the ones identified for
isolated AVIs (Fig. 4C and 4D). For the cellular AVIs it was
also notable that the outer regions of the thread structure
of the AVI residing in the central vacuole in the adaxial
cells were more loosely distributed than in the central
region of the AVI (Figure 4C). Examination at higher magnification showed that the networks within the cellular
AVI seemed to retain more electron-dense materials (Fig.
4D), while the cellular AVI threads resembled those in the
isolated AVI. The thickness of the basic AVI threads
appeared to be less than 50 nm in both the isolated and
the cellular AVIs (Fig. 4B and 4D). No membrane was
observed around the intra-vacuolar AVI under TEM (Fig.
4C).

small as 200 nm (Fig. 6C) was clearly observed in the cytoplasmic vesicles that were morphologically similar to prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and surrounded by
abundant ER (Fig. 6B and 6C). These cytoplasmic vesicles
appeared to further develop to various sizes in the PVCs
(Fig. 6C and 6D), and the electron-dense bodies in them
were released into the central vacuole (Fig. 6D). After
release, these electron-dense bodies initially maintained
their integrity and trafficked towards the central AVI area
and subsequently ruptured so that their contents added to
the AVI bulk (Fig. 6D and 6E). The released electron-dense
material had a thread-like structure, while the remainder
of the ruptured electron-dense body maintained its previous form. These phenomena indicated that these electrondense bodies are possibly insoluble.

Staining of the light microscopic sections with Toluidine
Blue clearly demonstrated that the central vacuoles in the
adaxial epidermal cells of the inner petal region could
contain up to several highly condensed 'cores' within an
AVI (Fig. 5A, white arrowhead). Surrounding the cores
were the loose thread networks (Fig. 5A black arrowhead)
that appeared continuous throughout each central vacuole even when they had more than one AVI core. Bluestaining vesicles were clearly observed in the cytoplasm
and at the edge of the thread networks in these epidermal
cells (Fig. 5A, black arrows). Starch granule-containing
chloroplasts were stained pink-purple with Toluidine
Blue (Fig. 5A, double black arrowheads). The starch
nature in these chloroplasts was further verified using
iodine staining (Fig. 5B, double black arrowheads). The
thread networks of AVIs were not evident in the unstained
and iodine stained sections but the condensed AVI cores
were clearly visible (Fig. 1B and 5B).

Intravacuolar membrane fragments (Fig. 6F, dash arrow)
were sometimes observed among the AVI networks in
places. However, even at higher magnification, when the
edges of the electron-dense bodies were clearly shown, no
evidence of a membrane envelope for the electron-dense
body was observed (Fig. 6G and 6H).

The formation of AVIs in the adaxial epidermal cells was
also investigated by TEM examination of the subcellular
structures present. Under TEM, a typical lisianthus adaxial
epidermal cell was highly connected with subepidermal
cells through numerous plasmodesmata and contained a
large central vacuole with a major, irregularly shaped AVI
(Fig. 4C). The cytoplasm of these cells had large numbers
of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, starchcontaining chloroplasts and vesicles (Fig. 6A,6B and 6C).
Many of these cytoplasmic vesicles, morphologically
resembling the ones revealed under light microscopy (Fig.
5A), contained electron-dense bodies that did not possess
clear physical limits, instead displaying a fluffy boundary
zone (Fig. 6B and 6C, black arrow).
Although a TEM section is a 'snapshot' of a single time
point, there seemed to be a clear transition from the electron-dense bodies in the cytoplasmic vesicles to the AVI in
the central vacuole of adaxial epidermal cells (inner petal
regions). The accumulation of electron-dense bodies as

Discussion
Previous studies of AVIs in petals of lisianthus noted the
occurrence of thread-like bodies in the outer region of the
petal, and larger irregularly shaped bodies in the inner
region [20]. From more detailed examination in this
study, we can determine three forms of AVIs, which can
co-exist in three different types of epidermal cells in the
same petal: vesicle-like forms in the abaxial epidermal
cells of the inner petal region (Fig. 1A,1D and 1E), irregular forms in the adaxial epidermal cells of the inner petal
region (Fig. 1A,1B and 1C) and a rod-like form in the
adaxial epidermal cells of the outer petal region (Fig. 2E).
It is probable that the three AVI forms reflect differences
in the associated vacuolar contents of the different cells,
for example the anthocyanin type or amount. The inner
region of lisianthus flowers is known to have a different
anthocyanin profile to the outer region [20], but it is not
known whether the anthocyanins vary between the abaxial and adaxial epidermis. It is clear that flowers have
sophisticated mechanisms for controlling the amount and
type of pigment produced in specific regions of the petal,
to allow complex floral pigmentation patterns to be
formed [23]. There are no obvious environmental signals
associated with cell location or cell type that would influence the type of AVI that occurs. Light is the main signal
that affects AVI formation in maize cell cultures [24],
probably through promoting the fusion of anthocyanincontaining vesicles into AVI-like structures that contained
the spread of anthocyanins from the inclusions into the
vacuolar sap. However, light incidence is likely to be similar for the inner and outer region epidermal cells in
lisianthus flowers under glasshouse conditions.

The vesicle, thread and large irregular forms of AVIs
observed may represent three successive steps in AVI formation, perhaps linked to the rate and/or species of
anthocyanin biosynthesis in the particular cell, with the
large irregular-shaped AVI being the final form. The high
levels of "unbound" anthocyanins observed in vacuoles
containing the vesicle-like or rod-like AVI forms may indicate that the formation of AVIs in these cells has not progressed to the same extent as in the adaxial epidermal cells
of the inner petal region. This is further supported by the
observations that, firstly, the "unbound anthocyanins" in
the outer petal region can become completely associated
with larger AVIs in some cells (Fig 3B), and secondly, that
the abaxial epidermal cells had the ability to form insoluble AVI-like granules (Fig. 2C). That the large AVIs in inner
region adaxial cells are insoluble structures is supported
by a number of observations. Firstly, they can be isolated
as stable particles. Secondly, protoplasts prepared from
cells containing these AVIs do not form spherical cells but
have an irregular shape that reflects the presence of the
AVIs within the cells (Fig. 2A). The ability of the protoplasts from the adaxial epidermal cells of the inner petal
to maintain their original cellular shapes is unlikely to be
due to the incomplete removal of the cell walls but more
likely to be due to the presence of the AVI. The protoplasts
released from the abaxial epidermal cells always tended to
be spherical, but in the same digestion solution the protoplasts derived from the corresponding adaxial epidermal
cells always tended to keep their original shapes.
It is not known whether AVIs have a physiological role,
and consequently, it is not known whether the different
forms of AVIs observed have distinct physiological functions. It has been suggested that AVIs may enable the storage of high concentrations of anthocyanins [20], and have
a darkening effect on flower color in lisianthus and roses
[20,28]. Whether the impact on flower color has arisen
through an evolutionary trend to new colors is not
known, but it seems probable that the formation of the
different AVIs could be a consequence of changes in the
biosynthesis and/or intracellular transport of anthocyanins. The throat of lisianthus does have a much darker
color than the outer region. The presence of chloroplasts
in the adaxial epidermal cells of the inner petal region but
not the outer petal region may also contribute to the
darker color of this region. Anthocyanins are thought to
be present in complex structures in the vacuole that enable strong color formation, involving processes such as
self-association, intra- or inter supramolecular copigmentation [25]. Whether these states can still be formed when
the anthocyanins are associated with an AVI is not known,
but it is possible they may be generated immediately following biosynthesis and before transport to the AVI.
These self- and inter-molecular interactions may continue

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/29

to draw together the components of an AVI to form final
structures.
Different forms of AVIs have been reported in different
species. For instance, AVIs in the cell cultures derived from
sweet potato tubers [22] or grapevines [26] have a vesiclelike morphology similar to that observed in some lisianthus cells. However, electron microscopy examination
[22] showed that the sweet potato AVIs in the vacuoles
had neither membrane boundary nor internal structures
but appeared as strongly osmiophilic globules [22]. AVIs
in red-cabbage leaves [27], some cells of lisianthus, carnation [20], rose [28] and apple skins [29] have more compact forms, either regular or irregular in shape, and do not
resemble vesicles. Apart from the presence of anthocyanins, and the VP24 protein identified as associated with
sweet potato AVIs [30-32], the materials present in AVIs
are unknown. As with the sweet potato AVIs, neither the
lisianthus (this work and [20]) nor apple [29] AVIs display a membrane envelope. Although there is no single
surrounding membrane, we did find evidence for membrane fragments associated with AVIs in lisianthus petals.
Both SEM and light microscopy observations of isolated
and in planta AVIs showed a rough and grainy surface
comprised of strand-, granule- and sheet-like structures,
suggestive of a membranous origin, and the fine thread
network structures observed by TEM also suggest the presence of intravacuolar membranous materials. Although
acetone was used during SEM sample preparation, AVIs
remained physically intact. This suggests either that the
membranous structures observed in the AVIs are not lipidbased, or that the anthocyanins are able to protect these
structures from corrupting by acetone.
The results obtained in the current study clearly suggest
that, in lisianthus petals, the ultimate AVIs in the central
vacuoles are derived from the aggregation of anthocyanins
into insoluble structures that are similar to membranous
networks in appearance (Fig 4 and 5). The aggregation
process seems to have started from some kind of 'seed'
structure (Fig. 5A), perhaps composed of membrane
material, and then the surrounding anthocyanic networks
continue to be deposited to these 'seed' structures (Fig. 4,
5 and 6). A clear traffic route of anthocyanic vesicle-like
bodies from the cytoplasm to the central vacuole observed
in this study also demonstrates that mass transport of
anthocyanins is a major means of anthocyanin sequestration into the central vacuole.
Based on the observations of lisianthus petal cells, a hypothesis can be presented for formation of AVIs in this species. As the anthocyanins are being formed on the ER they
may be simultaneously transported into PVCs in the cytoplasm and accumulate as electron-dense vesicle-like bodies. Certainly these colored, electron-dense bodies present

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:29

in the cytoplasm, as observed with the light and TEM
microscopes respectively, indicate that the cytoplasm is
not only the site of anthocyanin biosynthesis but also a
site where anthocyanins can accumulate to a certain level.
Material from the ER may be co-transported with the
anthocyanins into these transport bodies, perhaps including membrane fragments. That the vesicle-like bodies do
not contain a free solution of anthocyanins is suggested
by the images of them rupturing and releasing their contents onto the AVI. The PVCs gradually enlarge and subsequently merge with the central vacuole to release the
anthocyanic, electron-dense bodies into the central vacuole. As the material is released from the electron-dense
bodies into the main vacuole environment, the network
of insoluble anthocyanic thread-like material is then
formed and aggregated to give a stable AVI particle. This
may occur if the solubility of the material is different
between internal vesicle environment and vacuolar environment. If co-pigmentation or self-stacking of anthocyanins is occurring on the growing AVI then this may
further promote insolubility.
Vesicles directly derived from ER have been reported to be
involved in the mass transport of proteins into protein
storage vacuoles in soybean and rice [33,34]. Intracellular
trafficking of ER-derived vesicles to the central vacuole has
also been suggested for yellow fluorescent phytochemicals in transgenic maize BMS cell suspensions [4], including the formation of AVI-like structures [17]. The
accumulation of pre-vacuolar vesicles in the tds4 mutant
of Arabidopsis [35,36] also suggests an involvement of
vesicle transport in proanthocyanin biosynthesis. Further
evidence for the formation of vesicles associated with the
biosynthesis of anthocyanins on the ER comes from studies of the localisation of the biosynthetic enzymes. UDPglucose:flavonol 2'- and 5'-O-glucosyltransferases in
leaves of Chrysosplenium americanus [37], and chalcone
synthase and chalcone isomerase in Arabidopsis roots
[38] have been localized not only on the ER but also in
small vesicles, which may be derived from the ER. In the
epidermal cells of lisianthus petals, the prevacuoles were
often observed in close proximity to abundant ER,
although whether this is a casual or coincidental occurrence is not known.
Morphological evidence of intracellular flavonoid transport and sequestration into the central vacuole is required
to reconcile with evidence derived from molecular
research [6]. Based on the cellular and sub-cellular evidence in the current study, it is tempting to assume that
GSTs [9-12,39] and transporters [13,40] mainly work at
the stage when anthocyanins are being packed into prevacuoles in the cytoplasm. Losses of anthocyanin-related
GSTs or transporters may disrupt the packing process in
the cytoplasm. Further studies using combined

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/29

approaches of molecular and cell biology will help gain
more insight into this process.

Conclusion
AVIs can take three different forms in the epidermal cells
of lisianthus, dependent on the positions of the epidermal
cells on a petal. Although these different forms are relatively stable, they do seem to have the ability to progress
towards the ultimate morphology of an irregular form.
The present study has clearly demonstrated that a mechanism involving mass transport of anthocyanins from the
cytoplasm to the central vacuole exists in lisianthus petals.
Cellular and subcellular evidence suggests that the
anthocyanins may be first packed into PVCs in close proximity to the sites of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These prevacuolar vesicles, along with the contained anthocyaninic
bodies, further develop and ultimately merge with the
central vacuole to deliver anthocyanins into the vacuole,
where various forms of AVIs develop. Physically, AVIs in
lisianthus are aggregates of anthocyanin-containing membrane-like and thread networks. Further investigation is
currently being undertaken to look into chemical nature
of these anthocyanic networks in the AVI.

Methods
Plant material
The lisianthus used in this study was a deep purple-flowered variety Wakamurasaki (WMS, Mioshi Seed Company, Japan). All plants were grown in pots at 18â24Â°C
throughout the year with no supplemental lighting in a
standard glasshouse in Palmerston North, New Zealand.
During the experiments, fully open and healthy flowers
were harvested, petals were detached and then thoroughly
washed at least three times with 1 liter of tap water containing three drops of Tween-20 prior to a final wash with
MilliQ water.
Protoplast Generation
The washed petals were chopped up using an onion chopper on a plastic board until the petals became slurry. Small
amount of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing
10 mM EDTA was added during the chopping in order for
the chopped petals to form slurry. The petal slurry was
added to a macerating solution [41] containing 1% (w/v)
cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Yakult Honsha Co., HigashiShinbashi, Minatoku, Tokyo) and 0.05% (w/v) Pectolyase
Y23. The mix was incubated on a rocker overnight at room
temperature to release AVI-containing protoplasts.
AVI isolation
The method of isolating AVIs from flower petals was
based on that of Markham and colleagues [20] with some
modifications. The mix of AVI-containing protoplasts was
vortexed, filtered through 50-Î¼m cheesecloth and washed
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer plus 0.3 M NaCI (wash solu-

tion) prior to centrifugation at 100 g for 5 min to collect
an AVI-containing pellet. The pellet was washed in combination with vortexes twice more with the wash solution to
remove debris and increase free AVIs. The final pellet was
suspended in a minimal volume of wash solution.
The suspended pellet was transferred into a new tube containing 80% (v/v) Percoll (AMRAD-Pharmacia Biotech,
Auckland, New Zealand) and mixed with vortexing. The
pellet containing free AVIs was harvested from the bottom
of the centrifuge tube after centrifugation at 10,000 g for
10 min. The pellet was washed twice in wash solution and
then stored at -80Â°C until use.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Isolated AVIs were quickly washed twice in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), once in 100% acetone, and then
briefly air-dried at room temperature. The conductive surfaces of the AVIs during the SEM were achieved through
gold sputtering, using a BAL-TEC SCD 050 coater. AVIs
were then observed and photographed with a Cambridge
250 Mk III scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Isolated AVIs, small pieces of carnation petals and lisianthus inner petals were fixed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2) containing 3% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (v/
v) formaldehyde. After three washes with the phosphate
buffer, the samples were transferred to 1% OsO4 (w/v) for
secondary fixation. Dehydration used a graded acetone
series (25%, 50%, 75%, 95% and 2Ã 100%). The samples
were then embedded in Procure 812 epoxy resin at 60Â°C
for 48 h. Ultra-thin sections were prepared using a diamond knife and a Leica Ultracut R Ultramicrotome.
Nickel grid-mounted sections were double-stained using
saturated uranyl acetate in 50% (v/v) ethanol, followed by
lead citrate. Observation and photography used a Philips
201C transmission electron microscope.
Light Microscopy
Transverse sections (1 to 3 Î¼m thick) of isolated AVIs and
petals were prepared in the same way as described for the
transmission electron microscope. Prior to light microscopy observation, the sections were stained with 0.05%
(w/v) Toluidine Blue in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2),
KI/I2 solution (containing 2.0% (w/v) KI and 1.0% (w/v)
I2) or unstained to take advantage of the anthocyanin
color as markers. All light microscopy of petal peels, protoplasts, isolated AVIs, sectioned AVIs and petals used an
Olympus BH-2 microscope in either bright field or epifluorescent mode. All samples were mounted on glass slides
and covered with glass cover slides for observation. Photographs were taken using Leica DFC Cameras operated
by Leica FireCam software on a Macintosh computer.
