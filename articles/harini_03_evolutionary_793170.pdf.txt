Abstract
Background: Drosophila nasuta nasuta (2n = 8) and Drosophila nasuta albomicans (2n = 6) are a pair
of sibling allopatric chromosomal cross-fertile races of the nasuta subgroup of immigrans species
group of Drosophila. Interracial hybridization between these two races has given rise to new
karyotypic strains called Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2 (first phase). Further hybridization between
Thailand strain of D. n. albomicans and D. n. nasuta of Coorg strain has resulted in the evolution of
two more Cytoraces, namely Cytorace 3 and Cytorace 4 (second phase). The third phase
Cytoraces (Cytorace 5 to Cytorace 16) have evolved through interracial hybridization among first,
second phase Cytoraces along with parental races. Each of these Cytoraces is composed of
recombined genomes of the parental races. Here, we have made an attempt to systematically assess
the impact of hybridization on karyotypes, morphometric and life history traits in all 16 Cytoraces.
Results: The results reveal that in most cases, the newly evolved Cytoraces, with different
chromosome constitutions, exhibit decreased body size, better fitness and live longer than their
parents. Particularly, Cytorace 5, 6 and 8 have evolved with very much higher range values of
quantitative traits than the parents and other Cytoraces, which suggests the role of transgressive
segregation in the evolution of these Cytoraces.
Conclusion: Thus, the rapid divergence recorded in the chromosomes, karyotypes, body size and
fitness traits of Cytoraces exhibit the early event of recombinational raciation / speciation in the
evolution of the Cytoraces under laboratory conditions.

Background
One of the important aspects of studying evolution is to
understand how new species are formed and their uniqueness maintained. Dobzhansky et. al [1] treat hybridization as an 'evolutionary catalyst' which, may lead to
perfection of isolating mechanisms, be a source for the
origin of a new species or increase the quantum of genetic
variability. Templeton [2] had also felt that hybridization
experiments provide the best tool for distinguishing the

genetics of speciation and the genetics of species differences. Speciation genetics concentrates on populations or
races that have been recently separated from each other
and has not yet attained the status of species. More
advanced the stage of speciation of two diverging populations; the more difficult it becomes to delineate the
genetic event that has set the process into motion. Thus, it
may not be possible to understand the process of speciation by looking at the finished products [3].

During last two decades, the nasuta subgroup of the immigrans species of Drosophila has attracted the attention of
taxonomists, cytogenetists, biochemists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. The nasuta subgroup has
certain evolutionary peculiarities that make this subgroup
a potent system to study the genetics of speciation in Drosophila [4]. D. nasuta was first described from Seychelles
islands [5]. Later, morphologically similar forms were
reported in India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and in coastal
regions of Africa [6–8]. D. albomicans was described from
Paroe, Formosa [9]. More recently, it was reported from
several Japanese islands, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan
[6–8]. Even though the morphological description of D.
albomicans was almost identical to that of D. nasuta, Wilson et al. [10] considered them as allopatric sibling species. Though the D. nasuta (2n = 8) and D. albomicans (2n
= 6) differ in their chromosome number, based on their
open genetic systems, cross fertility, similarities and differences in karyotypes, they have been treated as chromosomal races and called D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans
[11,12].
The cytological distinctness of these two races has been
extensively studied [12–17,8]. In brief, D. n. nasuta with
2n = 8 has a pair of metacentrics representing chromosome 2, two pairs of acrocentric chromosome 3 and chromosome X (an acrocentric X, a submetacentric Y in males)
and a pair of dot chromosomes. Whereas D. n. albomicans
has 2n = 6 with two pairs of metacentrics, one of which
represents chromosome 2, while the other represents X3,
X3 in females and X3, Y3 in males; and a pair of long dots
(Chromosome 4). Under laboratory conditions they are
cross-fertile. In nature no hybrids were found. They are
isolated from each other by more than 3000 miles and are
allopatrically distributed. Ranganath and Hagele [18],
while discussing the karyotypic evolution in the nasuta
subgroup have demonstrated that the karyotype of D. n.
albomicans is the recent product of karyotypic orthoselection involving successive centric fusions. In view of this
karyotypic phylogeny, D. n. nasuta is ancestral to D. n.
albomicans.
Interracial hybridization between these two races followed by the maintenance of hybrid populations for over
20 generations in the laboratory has resulted in the evolution of new karyotypic strains called Cytoraces [16]. These
Cytoraces were constructed in three phases. In the first
phase, Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2 were formed through
hybridizing D. n. nasuta (Coorg strain) and D. n. albomicans (Okinawa strain) [16]. The second phase yielded two
more karyotypic strains called Cytorace 3 and Cytorace 4
from the hybridization between D. n. nasuta of Coorg
strain and D. n. albomicans of Thailand strain [19]. The
third phase interracial hybridization among D. n. nasuta,
D. n. albomicans, Cytorace 1, Cytorace 2, Cytorace 3 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/20

Cytorace 4 has resulted in the creation of 12 new stabilized karyotypic strains, named from Cytorace 5 to
Cytorace 16 (Table 1) [17,20]. Each of these Cytoraces is
composed of recombined genomes of the parental races,
contain chromosomes of both parents, and differ in their
karyotypic composition. These newly created Cytoraces
along with their parental races constitute a new assemblage the "nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila" [17].
Tanuja et al [21] have suggested a new terminology called
"allo-sympatric" for these members of the nasuta-albomicans complex, because, each race is passing through a
phase of racial differentiation in 'genetic isolation'
through physical as opposed to behavioral barriers to
interbreeding while inhabiting the same area and more
importantly common set of environmental (cultures in
the laboratory) conditions. They also suggested considering this complex as an 'artificial hybrid zone' in the environs of laboratory. Earlier studies on cytogenetic
differentiation [16,17], mating preference [22], sternopleural bristles number [23], body size [24], body weight
[25] and abdominal bristles number [26] of parental races
namely D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans as well as
Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2 have shown significant differences between parental races and Cytoraces.
The impact of hybridization on karyotypes, morphometric and fitness traits has not been studied systematically in
all these 16 Cytoraces together. In the present study, we
measured the body size, body weight and certain life history traits in all 18 members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila. The rapid divergence recorded in the
chromosomes, karyotypes, body size and fitness traits of
Cytoraces exhibits the early event of recombinational raciation / speciation during the evolution of these Cytoraces
under laboratory condition.

Results
Chromosomes of Cytoraces
The comparative account of D. n. nasuta, D. n. albomicans,
F1 and Cytoraces chromosomes were presented in our earlier publications (Table 1) [16,19,17,20]. One of the
advantages in the karyotypic analysis of these races and
hybrids is that the chromosomes of D. n. nasuta and D. n.
albomicans can easily identified based on their size and
heterochromatin content. Chromosome 2 of D. n. nasuta
was larger in size than D. n. albomicans with more of pericentric heterochromatin. While chromosome 3 and X of
D. n. albomicans were the product of centric fusion forming metacentrics X3 and Y3 chromosomes. On the other
hand, chromosome 4 of D. n. albomicans was longer than
D. n. nasuta with more of heterochromatin content.
Cytoraces were the karyotypically stabilized hybrid forms
having different chromosome composition with 2n = 6,
2n = 7 and 2n = 8 (Table 1). Some of the Cytoraces such
as Cytorace 1, Cytorace 4, Cytorace 5, Cytorace 6,

Cytorace 7, Cytorace 8 and Cytorace 14 had unequal diploid number in males (2n = 7), and equal diploid number
in females (2n = 6 or 2n = 8), even then, they breed true
along with a few sterile anueploids. Both males and
females of the remaining 9 Cytoraces, Cytorace 2,
Cytorace 9, Cytorace 11, Cytorace 12 and Cytorace 13 had
2n = 6, while Cytorace 3, Cytorace 10, Cytorace 15, and
Cytorace 16 had 2n = 8. The chromosomes of these
Cytoraces were the introgressed genomes between the
parental races and they are not the same as their parents.
Although some of these Cytoraces had same chromosome
number and chromosome morphology, they are numbered as different Cytorace since they were derived from
different parental genomes.
Based on the relative contributions of D. n. nasuta and D.
n. albomicans chromosomes, these 16 Cytoraces are categorized into six types (Table 1). Of which, Cytorace 6
(belonging to group VI) is with more number of chromosomes which have the morphology like that of D. n. nasuta chromosomes (12N+ 3A), while Cytorace 2, Cytorace
9, Cytorace 11, Cytorace 12 and Cytorace 13 (belonging
to group II) are with more number of chromosomes
which have the morphology like that of D. n. albomicans
chromosomes (10A+2N). The dot chromosomes in all the
Cytoraces were in homozygous condition, wherein only
Cytorace I and Cytorace 6 have D. n. nasuta dot chromosomes, while all other Cytoraces evolved with D. n. albom-

albomicans

icans dot chromosomes. Except in the males of Cytoraces
who have stabilized with 2n = 7, the sex and chromosome
3 were evolved in homozygous condition. It has been
reported that the chromosome 2 is always in polymorphic
nature with more frequency of heterozygous combination. Taking all the chromosomes of all the 16 Cytoraces
together, it has been observed that chromosomes of D. n.
albomicans were more favored (123 chromosomes) than
D. n. nasuta (98 chromosomes) during the evolution of
these Cytoraces. However, all these chromosomes of the
karyotypically stabilized Cytoraces were the introgressed
chromosomes by recombination during the evolution of
these Cytoraces.
Body size
The females of all 18 members of the nasuta -albomicans
complex (NAC) of Drosophila have increased mean wing
length (Table 2) and width (Table 3) than males. The
analysis of variance test has revealed significant differences in males, females and both males and females with
P < 0.001. Based on Dunken's multiple range test
(DMRT), D. n. nasuta, D. n. albomicans and the products of
first phase of interracial hybridization (Cytorace 1 and
Cytorace 2) have increased wing length (Fig. 1) than
recently evolved second and third phase Cytoraces, except
in males, wherein Cytorace 12 had higher mean values
than Cytoraces 1, however, the difference is insignificant.
In contrast to this, the mean values of wing width in

males, females, and both males and females together
majority of the Cytoraces had outside the range of parental races (Fig. 2) indicating that the wing width varies significantly among the Cytoraces.
The analysis of variance test (Table 4) has revealed significant differences among the 18 members for genitalia
length (P < 0.001) and genitalia width (P < 0.002). D. n.
albomicans and Cytorace 8 had the highest and the lowest
mean genitalia length and width, respectively (Table 4).
Among the Cytoraces, Cytorace 16 has increased genitalia
length (Fig. 3a) and Cytorace 2 has increased genitalia
width (Fig. 3b) (which is also equivalent to D. n. albomicans) than rest of the Cytoraces. It has been observed that
none of the other Cytoraces have increased size of genitalia than D. n. albomicans, however, most of the Cytoraces
exhibited their genitalia size outside the range of D. n. nasuta parents.
The mean body weight of 2 days old flies (Table 5) in 18
members of the NAC of Drosophila revealed that females
show increased body weight than males. The males of
Cytorace 10 and Cytorace 8 had lesser and greater body
weight respectively, while in females and both males and
females together, D. n. nasuta and Cytorace 8 has
decreased and increased body weight respectively, however, the difference between the values of D. n. nasuta and
Cytorace 10 is insignificant (Fig. 4). Most of the Cytoraces
have increased body weight than parental races. These
results are contrasting with the other body size traits indicating that body weight trait is independent of body size
traits.
Life history traits
The mean lifetime fecundity, lifetime fertility, ovariole
numbers and hatching success in the 18 members of the
NAC complex of Drosophila (Table 6) revealed that D. n.
nasuta, has decreased lifetime fecundity, lifetime fertility
and hatching success than D. n. albomicans as well as most
of the Cytoraces. While Cytorace 12 in fecundity and
Cytorace 13 in fertility as well as hatching success (Table
6) have reduced values than all other Cytoraces. On the
other hand, Cytorace 8 had the highest lifetime fecundity
and lifetime fertility, while Cytorace 6 and D. n. albomicans had the highest ovariole number and hatching success respectively (5a-c). The mean lifetime fecundity of the
parental races is lower than Cytoraces, however, in
Cytoraces, the mean lifetime fecundity extends outside
the range of parental races. These observations suggest
that, the newly evolved Cytoraces of the third phase have
also exhibited the lowest as well as the highest fecundity,
indicating the extent of divergence. The results of
decreased ovariole number in D. n. nasuta and D. n.
albomicans and also first phase Cytoraces (Cytorace 1 and
Cytorace 2) suggest that recently evolved Cytoraces are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/20

having increased ovariole number than ancestral races
(Fig. 5b). The lifetime fertility of all the 16 Cytoraces also
extends outside the range of parental races. The percent of
hatching success (which was measured by dividing fertility by fecundity values) across the lineages ranges from 60
and 75% with the exception of Cytorace 13 (36%).
The mean longevity of unmated males and virgin females
(Table 7) in the 18 members of the NAC complex of Drosophila revealed that the virgin females (55.53 to 83.63
days) of all these races lived longer than males (48.33 to
68.60 days). Both mated and virgin flies of D. n. nasuta
and D. n. albomicans had the reduced longevity than most
of the 16 newly evolved Cytoraces. Of these two, D. n.
albomicans lived longer than D. n. nasuta. Among the
Cytoraces, in both mated and virgin flies, Cytorace 8 lived
longer (63.53 to 83.63 days) than other Cytoraces,
whereas males of Cytorace 12 (47.16 days) and females of
Cytorace 1 (51.06 days) showed the reduced longevity
than all other Cytoraces. These results suggest that, D. n.
nasuta which is ancestor to all these races based on chromosomal evolution has decreased life span than the
newly evolved Cytoraces (Fig. 6a,6b,6c,6d). In addition,
the results revealed that virgin flies live longer than mated
flies in the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila (Fig.
6e). It is clear that all the Cytoraces live longer than parental races indicating that the hybridization followed by
recombination played a major role in this process of raciation / speciation.
Correlation analysis
Correlation analysis based on the Euclidean distance dissimilarity in 18 members of the NAC complex of Drosophila is compiled in Table 8 - Additional file: 1. The traits
used for male, female and both male and female together
analysis were 7 (wing length and width, genitalia length
and width, body weight, longevity in unmated and mated
males), 8 (wing length and width, body weight, lifetime
fecundity, ovariole numbers, lifetime fertility, longevity in
virgin and mated females) and 5 (wing length and width,
body weight, longevity in virgin and mated flies) respectively. The Euclidean distance between two values is the
arithmetic difference. The minimum value is 0, and it has
no upper limit. Based on this, Cytorace 8 had the maximum distance from D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans than
other Cytoraces. Figure 7 illustrates the Cytoraces, which
deviate with higher and lower range of Euclidean distance
from the parental range. Interestingly, some of the 3rd
phase Cytoraces have higher range of Euclidean distance
with D. n. nasuta, D. n. albomicans, Cytorace 2 and Cytoraces 1. In particular, Cytorace 5, Cytorace 6 and Cytorace 8
had maximum divergence with D. n. nasuta and D. n.
albomicans. While some of the 3rd phase and 2nd phase
Cytoraces had minimum divergence among themselves

Based on the Duncan's multiple range test (DMR), 18 members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila are constructed
into clusters and named in the hierarchical form from the lowest to the highest mean wing length. The members belonging to
each cluster have insignificant differences. In males, (Fig. 1a), females (Fig. 1b) and both males and females together (Fig. 1c), 8
clusters are made. In males, cluster 1 (C8) with only one member forms an independent cluster, while N, A and C2 emerged as
independent (Fig. 1c) as well as overlapping clusters (Fig. 1a and 1b) from the other clusters. All others are with overlapping
clusters.

hybrid segregants, rapid chromosomal evolution and the
availability of habitats suitable for the establishment of
hybrid neospecies [30].

Discussion

The feasibility of this mode of speciation has been verified
experimentally via crossing studies. These studies
demonstrate that fertile and viable hybrid lineages can be
obtained after only a small number of generations (<10)
of selfing and/or backcrossing, even if the F1 hybrids were
almost completely sterile. Furthermore, experimental
crosses indicate that the synthetic hybrid lineages are
often strongly reproductively isolated from the parental
species [31]. Rieseberg et al [32] have demonstrated
hybrid speciation accompanied by genomic reorganization in wild sunflowers. Ungerer et al [27] have also
demonstrated the rapid hybrid speciation by estimating
the sizes of parental species chromosomal blocks in Helianthus anomalus, a wild sunflower species derived via
hybridization between H. annuus and H. petiolaris. Waugh
O'Neill et al [32] have reported the occurrence of genomewide undermethylation, retroviral element amplification
and chromosome remodeling in the interspecific mammalian hybrids of Macropus eugenii with Wallabia bicolor
could facilitate rapid karyotypic evolution. These reports
clearly indicate that the rapid karyotypic evolution following hybridization can facilitate the evolution of reproductive barriers in hybrid lineages.

A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is
whether speciation is gradual or punctuated. This question has been difficult to evaluate critically because the
evolutionary history of most plant and animal species is
poorly known. However, it may be feasible to determine
which modes of speciation are likely to be rapid and
which ones are likely to occur gradually [27]. The most
widely accepted model for diploid or homoploid hybrid
speciation is the recombinational model described by
Grant [28]. According to this model, the sorting of chromosomal rearrangements in later generation hybrids
could, by chance, lead to the formation of new populations that are homozygous for a novel combination of
rearrangements. The new hybrid population would be fertile, stable and has the same ploidy as its parents, yet
would be at least partially isolated from both parental species by a chromosomal sterility barrier. Although
homoploid hybrid speciation is not instantaneous, computer simulation studies suggest that it should occur
rapidly. In the simulations, long periods of hybrid zone
stasis are typically followed by abrupt transitions in which
the new hybrid type becomes established and rapidly displaces the parental species [29]. Other factors that appear
to play a critical role in recombinational speciation
include: strong natural selection for most fertile or viable

Chromosomes of Cytoraces
In the present study, Interracial hybridization between D.
n. nasuta (2n = 8) and D. n. albomicans (2n = 6) yielded a
range of new karyotypic stabilized combinations called
Cytoraces. Some of the important features in the evolution of these Cytoraces are as follows: a) Chromosome 2
in the Cytoraces has not been stabilized into one
combination, and more than 50% of the karyotypes in
each of the Cytoraces present in heterozygous condition,
which indicate that chromosome 2 is in polymorphic
state. Therefore, all these Cytoraces show fixed heterozygosity for the 2nd chromosome. b) Of the 16 Cytoraces, 14
of them retained and established D. n. albomicans dots
chromosomes in homozygous state, the remaining two
Cytoraces (Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 6) retained the D. n.
nasuta dot chromosomes suggesting that D. n. albomicans
dots are more stable and favoured. c) Regarding the sex
and chromosome 3, there is a trend of retaining more of
albomicans X3/Y3 chromosomes in the Cytoraces than nasuta chromosomes. d) There is also a tendency of retaining
parental chromosomes in Cytoraces depending on its
male parents (10/16). These Cytoraces evolved by
reshuffling of parental chromosomes (and genes) and
also retaining certain chromosomes by eliminating others. Within a span of one -and- half decades, hybridization
as an evolutionary stimulus has influenced the evolution
of sixteen cytogenetically different Cytoraces in the laboratory. It might have taken millions of years in nature to
evolve a group of such differentiating races. These Cytora-

ces differ in karyotypes from their parents, which is out
side the range of the parental combinations due to
transgressive segregation of chromosomes and recombinational events. Evolution of these new karyotypes
through hybridization and recombination ranging from
20–200 generations is a unique evidence for rapid chromosomal evolution in animals particularly in Drosophila.
Body size
Evolutionary response to selection depends on the
amount of genetic variation expressed in the population.
Because of this, the effect of environmental changes on
the expression of genetic variation in the quantitative
traits has important evolutionary implications [33]. Body
size is the central feature of any organism – physiologically, ecologically and evolutionarily [34]. Body size is the
most easily observable and measurable phenotypic trait,
that is closely linked with life history traits and has been
widely used in the studies of quantitative genetics [35]. In
the present study, investigations on the body size traits
namely, wing length, and width; genitalia length and
width and body weight brings out the following: a) the
females of all the 18 members of the NAC complex of Drosophila have larger wing length and wing width than
males. b) D. n. albomicans has increased wing length, genitalia length and genitalia width while Cytorace 12 has
increased wing width. c) Cytorace 8 has greatly reduced
wing length and width, genitalia length and width along
with the highest body weight. d) Except males of Cytorace

10, all the other Cytoraces have shown the greater body
weight than parental races. e) In most of the Cytoraces,
body size and body weight are negatively correlated. If
one considers only mean wing length values, one can
strongly argue that the newly evolved Cytoraces are always
smaller in size than their parents. When we compare wing
length with body weight trait, it is clear that the Cytoraces
are smaller in size with increased body weight than parental races. Such correlations cannot be achieved for the
other body-sized traits. In addition to this, majority of
these Cytoraces exhibit most of the morphophenotypes
out side the range of parental range, which indicate that
these Cytoraces are unique products of interracial hybridization followed by recombination and transgressive segregation of quantitative traits/genes.
Life history traits
Various investigators have contributed towards the understanding of measurements of population fitness and its
components in natural and experimental populations of
Drosophila [36–39]. The likelihood of establishing a new
hybrid lineage depends in large part on its fitness in
parental and /or divergent habitats [31]. Egg laying
potentiality is an important attribute, which determines
to certain extent the reproductive success of a population.
Fecundity is the major determining factor of female fitness
[34]. In the present study, except Cytorace 12, all other
Cytoraces have higher fecundity than D. n. nasuta and D.
n. albomicans parents. Therefore, one can surmise that

each of these Cytoraces is the unique recombinant product exhibiting their evolutionary independence with
higher fitness.
Ovariole number is an anatomical trait determined during pupation for which a polygenic basis is known in
various species of the D. melanogaster complex [40]. Ovariole number is correlated with female reproductive success
via a simple relationship between the number of ovarioles
and the rate at which, the eggs have produced by the
female [41]. The newly evolved second and third phase
Cytoraces have greater number of ovarioles than their parents. In addition to this, the ancestor races D. n. nasuta
emerged out as an independent member with lowest
ovariole number indicating the significant divergence
from all the other members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila. This also supports the chromosomal
basis of orthoselection in the nasuta subgroup of Drosophila [18,7] stating that D. n. alboimcans karyotype 2n =
6 is derived from D. n. nasuta 2n = 8 which is an ancestral
race.
Fertility, the newly produced offspring from that particular mating pair is an important component of fitness,
measured in terms of productivity has been extensively
studied in different species of Drosophila [24]. Cytoraces
with uneven diploid chromosome number in males and
even diploid number in females (Cytorace 1, Cytorace 4,
Cytorace 5, Cytorace 6, Cytorace 8 and Cytorace 14)

Based on the DMR test, 18 members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila are constructed into clusters and named
in the hierarchical form from the lowest to the highest mean lifetime fecundity (Fig. 5a), ovariole number (Fig. 5b) and lifetime
fertility (Fig. 5c). The members belonging to each cluster have insignificant differences. For life time fecundity, six clusters were
recognized, of which, cluster 1 to 5 are overlapped with each other, while cluster 6 (C8) is formed as independent cluster. For
ovariole number, six clusters were recognised, of which, except cluster 1 (N), all the other clusters from 2 to 6 are overlapped, while cluster 1 is formed as independent cluster. For fertility, cluster 1 (C13) is formed as independent cluster, while
cluster 2 to cluster 7 are overlapped with each other.

showed more fertility than others suggesting that the
hybrid combinations of chromosome 3 and X will play a
role in the production of more fertile individuals. D. n.
nasuta has less hatching success than D. n. albomicans.
Most of the Cytoraces except Cytorace 13 have tendency to
increase the hatching success like D. n. albomicans.
The quantitative aspect of life span is well categorized in
Drosophila [42]. In the present study, females live longer
than males in both virgins and mated flies. One of the
very interesting observations is that most of the Cytoraces,
which are recently evolved, have achieved greater life span
than parental races, D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans suggesting that the hybridization has enhanced the longevity
of the newly evolved Cytoraces
By considering all the fitness components, one can bring
out that Cytorace 8 of the third phase is with maximum
fitness and lives longer than all the other races. While D.
n. nasuta, an ancestral to all these races experienced
reduced ovariole number and lives shorter than all the
other races. In contrast to this, only Cytorace 12 and
Cytorace 13, evolved in third phase have the lowest fecundity and fertility. Recently, Buck et al. [43] have reported
that long-lived strains of Drosophila with reduced fitness
and extension of longevity involves costs as well as benefits, which is again contrasting to the present investigations, wherein most of the Cytoraces are smaller in size
and live longer with better fitness than their parents.

Conclusions
Formation of new karyotypic combinations (Cytoraces)
with different chromosome constitutions and decreased
body size with better fitness is theoretically difficult,
because it often requires simultaneous changes at multiple traits. One of the possible mechanisms to overcome
this difficulty might be hybrid recombination which generates novel combinations of these genetic variations,
Cytoraces. Therefore, the Cytoraces are the resulting set of
segregants, which contain an admixture of the two parental genotypes as a result of chromosome recombination.
Since the parental genotypes are quite different, segregant
genotypes exhibit transgressive variation in Cytorace chromosomes, body size and fitness phenotypes that are much
more extreme than those of the parents from which they
arose. Although some of the Cytoraces are having same
chromosome number, they do not exhibit similarities in
their body size indicating that these are the rapidly evolving products of interracial hybridization. During subsequent generations parents donate contributing alleles
from different genes to these hybrids in the evolution of
these Cytoraces. Thus, the rapid divergence recorded in
the chromosomes, karyotypes, body size and fitness traits
of Cytoraces exhibit the early event of recombinational
raciation / speciation in the evolution of the Cytoraces
under laboratory conditions. This is a unique observation
in animal system, which illustrates the power of evolution
after the event of hybridization under laboratory condition. Formation of so many new and isolated karyotypic
races from the same two parental species suggests that
similar hybridization events might contribute to karyoPage 14 of 19

cans complex of Drosophila
Evidence for recombination and transgressive segregation of quantitative traits analysed in 18 members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila. Correlation of Euclidean distance dissimilarity (Table 8) is computed to the traits assessed separately in males (7 traits), females (8 traits) and both males and females together (5 traits). Based on these values, the members
are classified into three ranges, namely parental range, higher range and lower range. Many of these newly evolved Cytoraces
are more fit in the laboratory than their parental species and exhibit phenotypes that are extreme relative to either parent.
The generation of extreme phenotypes through recombination in segregating hybrids is referred to as transgressive
segregation.

typic evolution and speciation in nature. Therefore, the
evolution of the nasuta-albomicans complex is very
interesting which is a large scale evolutionary experimentation under laboratory condition and the members of
this complex are evolving at different stages of divergence,
offers a rare and unique opportunity to study the
multidimensional process of raciation / speciation particularly recombination speciation.

Methods
Fly stocks
The following Drosophila stocks were employed in the
present study:

a) Drosophila nasuta nasuta (Coorg, India),
b) Drosophila nasuta albomicans (Okinawa strain, Texas
collection, USA, 3045.11),
c) Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2 [16],
d) Cytorace 3 and Cytorace 4 [19] and
e) Cytorace 5 to Cytorace 16 [17].
The karyotypic compositions of the newly evolved 16
Cytoraces were reported elsewhere (Table 1) [17,20]. In
the evolution of each of these Cytoraces, the starting population size was around 10 pairs of flies. In every
generation, flies from five replicate cultures were mixed
and distributed to 5 new culture bottles. At the time of the
present experiment, Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2; Cytorace
3 and Cytorace 4; and Cytorace 5 to Cytorace 16 are passing through 350, 200 and 100 generations respectively.
All the above stocks were cultured in wheat cream agar
media in an uncrowded culture conditions at 22 ± 1°C
and were used for the following experiments.
Assessment of body size
The body size in all eighteen members of the nasutaalbomicans complex of Drosophila has been assessed by
using five different body size related traits such as, wing
length, wing width, genitalia length, genitalia width and
body weight.

a) Wing length and width: For both of these parameters, 30
flies were measured separately from 8 days old males and
females. Each fly was anaesthetized separately using ether
and left wing was dissected under stereomicroscope and
mounted on slides with DPX. The wing length was measured from the humeral cross vein to the tip of the wing,
while wing width was measured exactly from the middle
of the wing vertically by using ocular micrometer at 4X
magnification in units of 10 µm under a microscope [6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/20

b) Genitalia length and width: To measure these, male genitalia of 30 flies were dissected out following the method
of Emerald and Roy [44] with little modifications. The
genitalia were mounted on the cavity slide using creosote
and covered with the cover glass. These preparations were
observed under microscope with an ocular micrometer
and measured the length from the mid of the genitalia
arch to the tip of toe vertically, and width from the mid of
the left toe to the mid of the right toe horizontally at 10X
magnification in units of 0.06 µm.
c) Body weight: To measure the body weight, two days old
fifty virgin female and male flies were etherized individually and total fresh body weight was weighed using a fine
balance [45].
Life history traits
Using five different traits namely, fecundity, ovariole
numbers, fertility, longevity of virgin flies and longevity of
mated flies have assessed the life history traits in all eighteen members of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila.

a) Lifetime Fecundity assays: For the assessment of this, the
method of Buck et al. [46] was used with slight modifications. Thirty pairs of virgin females and males were isolated and sexed them separately for two days and then pair
mating was made. After 2 days, they were transferred to
fresh food media vials supplemented with yeast grains.
Likewise once in two days, each replicate was transferred
successively to the next set of vials. Immediately after each
transfer, the vials were checked for the number of eggs lay
by each pair and were counted under stereomicroscope till
the egg laying is stopped. Thus, the mean number of eggs
laid by these pair mated females was recorded.
b) Counting of Ovariole numbers: Thirty virgin female flies
were collected from uncrowded culture conditions and
aged for five days. Then each fly was anaesthetized and
dissected the left ovarioles in saline. The bundles of ovarioles were separated by a fine needle and counted under
stereomicroscope [40].
c) Lifetime Fertility assays: The same set of vials, which were
used to assess lifetime fecundity of a single female, was
also used in this assessment. The number of flies emerged
from each replicate were recorded for the total lifetime fertility. Hatching success was calculated by dividing mean
values of lifetime fecundity by lifetime fertility.
d) Longevity of virgin and mated flies: Longevity was
assessed using the modified protocol of Luckinbill and
Clare [47]. For virgin flies, single virgin female fly and
male fly were transferred to fresh vials separately supplemented with yeast grains. For mated flies, virgin females

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2003, 3

and males were aged for 5 days separately from the day of
emergence. On the sixth day, a male fly and a female fly
were placed in fresh media vials seeded with yeast grains
and were allowed to mate for two days. Once in two days,
each fly was transferred to fresh vials. Likewise a series of
changes were made once in every two days till the fly was
alive. For each experiment 30 replicates were assessed and
each fly was observed every day from the day of emergence to record the life span.
Statistical Analysis
The analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan's multiple
range test (DMRT) and Euclidean absolute distance dissimilarity correlation test were used to record the racial
divergence among them. To compile and calculate, the
program used was statistical presentation system software
10.0 for MS Windows.
