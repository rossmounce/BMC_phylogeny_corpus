Abstract
Background: Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are small single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses
infecting plants. Their virion morphology is unique in the known viral world – two incomplete T =
1 icosahedra are joined together to form twinned particles. Geminiviruses utilize a rolling-circle
mode to replicate their genomes. A limited sequence similarity between the three conserved
motifs of the rolling-circle replication initiation proteins (RCR Reps) of geminiviruses and plasmids
of Gram-positive bacteria allowed Koonin and Ilyina to propose that geminiviruses descend from
bacterial replicons.
Results: Phylogenetic and clustering analyses of various RCR Reps suggest that Rep proteins of
geminiviruses share a most recent common ancestor with Reps encoded on plasmids of
phytoplasmas, parasitic wall-less bacteria replicating both in plant and insect cells and therefore
occupying a common ecological niche with geminiviruses. Capsid protein of Satellite tobacco necrosis
virus was found to be the best template for homology-based structural modeling of the geminiviral
capsid protein. Good stereochemical quality of the generated models indicates that the geminiviral
capsid protein shares the same structural fold, the viral jelly-roll, with the vast majority of
icosahedral plant-infecting ssRNA viruses.
Conclusion: We propose a plasmid-to-virus transition scenario, where a phytoplasmal plasmid
acquired a capsid-coding gene from a plant RNA virus to give rise to the ancestor of geminiviruses.

Background
The origin(s) of viruses is a longstanding but yet unresolved question in biology. Several hypotheses were put
forward in efforts to understand this enigma (reviewed in
[1]). According to the "Virus-first" hypothesis, viruses
emerged in the prebiotic world, just before or in parallel
with cellular organisms [2,3]. The "Reduction" hypothesis
states that viruses evolved by reduction from free-living
ancient cellular lineages [4], while the alternative
"Escape" hypothesis suggests that viruses originated from

cellular genomic fragments that became free of their cellular environment [5]. Irrespective of which of the viral origin hypotheses is considered, these converge in the
appreciation of the extreme antiquity of viruses, with origin(s) possibly predating the emergence of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular organisms. The
ancient origin of viruses is inferred not only from bioinformatic investigations [2] but, perhaps more convincingly, from the recent flow of structural information on a
number of individual viral proteins as well as entire viri-

ons. Structural comparison of viruses infecting hosts from
all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya)
revealed that certain viruses utilize very similar assembly
principles and can be grouped accordingly into structurebased viral lineages [6,7]. The viral lineage hypothesis predicts that viruses existed at the time of (or even before)
LUCA and their diversification into bacterial, archaeal and
eukaryotic viruses was associated with the emergence of
the three cellular domains. But do all virus families come
from the dawn of life or can we still witness the more
recent emergence of new viral families?
Plasmids comprise another group of parasitic genetic elements that inhabit cells in all three domains of life.
Resemblance of plasmids to DNA viruses is apparent,
especially when DNA replication strategies are considered
[2]. Nevertheless, evolutionary relationships between
these two groups are far from being understood. Obviously, the main (and in some cases the only) difference is
the presence of the capsid protein-coding gene in the viral
genome. For example, there are a number of cryptic plasmids that encode a single protein responsible for DNA
replication, while some small viruses of the Circoviridae
family bear only two genes [8,9], one for genome replication and the other one for capsid formation. Members of
another virus family, Nanoviridae, contain multipartite
genomes where each genomic segment contains a single
gene and is packed into a separate isometric capsid [10].
For example, Faba bean necrotic yellows virus contains up to
eleven chromosomes [11]. Of special interest are plantinfecting satellite RNA viruses, such as Satellite tobacco
necrosis virus (STNV), that encode a single capsid protein
and depend on helper viruses for genome replication. It is
thus reasonable to assume that acquisition of a capsid
gene by a plasmid or, vice versa, loss of a capsid gene by a
virus will result in the transition from a plasmid to a genuine virus or from a virus to a plasmid, respectively. This
hypothesis should be testable by scrupulous analysis of
replication and capsid protein sequences and/or structures.
Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are small insect vector-transmitted plant-infecting viruses. Their circular single-stranded (ss) DNA genome is encapsidated into
twinned particles that are formed by joining two incomplete T = 1 icosahedra (Fig. 1A). According to the genome
organization, host range and the insect vector used, geminiviruses are divided into four genera: Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Begomovirus and Topocuvirus. Peculiarly, a number of
begomoviruses possess bipartite genomes, i.e. genes are
distributed on two separate ssDNA molecules that are
usually both required for productive infection, while mastre-, curto- and topocuviruses encode all their genes on a
single chromosome [12]. Geminiviruses replicate their
genomes in the nuclei of infected (usually phloem tissue)

cells via the rolling-circle (RCR) mechanism initiated by
virus-encoded replication initiation protein (Rep) that
ranges in size from approximately 320 to 400 amino acid
residues. In addition to the three conserved motifs, typical
to RCR Reps [13], geminiviral Reps possess a carboxy-terminal helicase domain with Walker A and B motifs
[14,15]. The ATPase activity of the geminivirus Rep protein was proven to be essential for replication [16].
Koonin and Ilyina (1992) observed a limited sequence
similarity between the three conserved motifs of the RCR
Reps of geminiviruses and plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria and suggested that geminiviruses descend from bacterial replicons [17]. Here we tested this hypothesis by
thoroughly analyzing a set of capsid and RCR protein
sequences from geminiviruses.

Results and Discussion
Geminiviruses are plant pathogens and due to their agricultural importance, a great number of sequences from

geminiviral isolates has been determined and deposited
into databases. We generated a specific sequence pattern
to select from the non-redundant BLAST database (including environmental protein sequences) all 1072 protein
sequences sharing conserved motifs with Rep proteins of
geminiviruses. Many of these sequences are almost identical; therefore, in order to avoid redundancy, the initial
dataset was filtered to leave only sequences that are less
than 70% identical to each other. After subsequent manual examination, the final dataset contained 40 sequences
(see Methods for data collection details). Nineteen of
these belonged to geminiviruses, while the rest were from
a marine metagenome project (6 sequences), circoviruses
(6 sequences), phytoplasmal plasmids (5 sequences),
plasmid of Porphyra pulchra (1 sequence), nanovirus (1
sequence), Bifidobacterium catenulatum DSM 16992 (1
sequence), and Nicotiana tabacum (1 sequence). Interestingly, the latter sequence was previously concluded to
originate from integration of geminiviral DNA into the
plant chromosome [18]. Nanoviruses and circoviruses are
small icosahedral viruses with ssDNA genomes. While
nanoviruses infect plants, circoviruses replicate in mammalian or avian cells. Bifidobacteria are gram-positive
bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract of humans
and other warm-blooded animals. Interestingly, Rep from
B. catenulatum DSM 16992 is homologous to a Rep of the
Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum plasmid p4M [GenBank:AAM00235], which has been previously observed to
be similar to Reps of circoviruses [19]. Phytoplasmas are
parasitic bacteria infecting the phloem tissue of plants.
Phytoplasmas belong to the class of Mollicutes, which
encompasses small pleiomorphic wall-less bacteria, also
including mycoplasmas, ureaplasmas, spiroplasmas and
acholeplasmas [20]. Phytoplasmas are transmitted by
insects that feed on the phloem of infected plants [21,22].
It should be noted that geminivirus-related bacterial RCR
Reps, other than those from phytoplasmal plasmids and
B. catenulatum DSM 16992, could not be identified neither by BLAST searches, nor by geminivirus-specific pattern searches (see Methods). Since reasonable sequence
conservation is a prerequisite for robust phylogenetic
analysis, we did not incorporate RCR Rep sequences from
other origins into our dataset.
The 40 sequences were aligned. The alignment was manually verified and edited [see Additional file 1]. A pairwise
distance matrix was calculated from the alignment and
used in the complete linkage clustering analysis (see
Methods for details). All geminiviral Reps formed a single
cluster (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Reps of phytoplasmal plasmids were found to be an integral part of the geminiviral
cluster with individual data points dispersed within the
cluster. Circoviral sequences clustered with two marine
metagenomic sequences obtained during the Global
Ocean Sampling Expedition. The rest of the sequences did

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/112

not form clusters that would contain more than one
sequence. The most divergent of the 40 sequences was Rep
of a nanovirus [GenBank:NP_620700]. The pairwise distances between the nanoviral and other Reps were considerably larger than distances between any other pair of
sequences (data not shown). Examination of the sequence
alignment [see Additional file 1] revealed that the Rep
protein of the nanovirus lacks the Walker B motif (DD) at
the equivalent position in other Rep proteins. Furthermore, Walker A motif in nanovirus Rep (GxxGxxGKS),
which was confirmed to be functional and essential for
replication, differed from the canonical P-loop sequence
(GxxxxGKT/S [11]). Therefore, nanoviral Rep was chosen
as an outgroup in the following phylogenetic analyses.
Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian trees were
inferred using PhyML [23] and MrBayes [24], respectively.
The ML tree is shown in Fig. 3. All geminiviruses (including geminivirus-derived Rep from N. tabacum [18]) form
a monophyletic group. The geminivirus clade, however, is
divided into two clearly defined subgroups. One subgroup contains begomoviral and curtoviral sequences,
where curtoviral sequences are at the base of the subclade.
The second subgroup contains only mastreviral Rep
sequences (Fig. 3). Interestingly, geminiviral Reps share a
most recent common ancestor with plasmids of phytoplasmas and not with other ssDNA viruses, implying a
separate origin for cicoviruses and possibly nanoviruses
(see also below). Topology of the tree calculated using
Bayesian inference was generally similar to that of the ML
tree, predicting a more recent common ancestor for Reps
from phytoplasmal plasmids and geminiviruses (compare
Fig. 3 and Additional file 2. There were, however, slight
differences in the branching within the geminiviral clade
when compared to the ML tree. Position of the Rep from
B. catenulatum DSM 16992 on the ML tree was different
from that on the Bayesian tree.
When Rep proteins of phytoplasmal plasmids were
searched for homologues using PSI-BLAST [25] against
bacterial and viral databases at NCBI, only Rep protein
sequences of other phytoplasmal plasmids or geminiviruses were identified with significant scores. This suggests
that other bacterial RCR Rep proteins share much less similarity with phytoplasmal Reps than those of geminiviruses. Indeed, sequences of bacterial plasmid Reps
identified using pattern searches by Koonin and Ilyina
(1992) share only three of the five motifs characteristic to
geminiviral Reps [15,17]. Also, there is no significant
sequence similarity, other than the three shared motifs,
between RCR Reps of bacterial plasmids (other than phytoplasmal plasmids) and geminiviruses. For example,

NCBI using as seeds Rep sequences of plasmids pMV158

Bank:CAA27141], the two plasmids whose Reps were
found to be the closest to geminiviral Reps [17], returned
no positive hits. Our analysis identifies Reps of phytoplasmal plasmids as the most similar sequences to geminiviral
Reps from currently available public protein sequence
databases. This observation suggests that geminiviral Reps

share a more recent common ancestor with phytoplasmal
plasmids than they do with other viral or plasmid RCR
Reps.
Interestingly, phytoplasmas and geminiviruses are both
obligate parasites occupying a common ecological niche –

phloem tissue of plants, which consists of parenchyma
cells, sieve-tube cells, and companion cells. Phytoplasmas
have been observed in companion cells and phloem
parenchyma cells as well as in sieve elements [21]. The
same types of cells were shown to contain geminiviral
DNA when Nicotiana benthamiana and Lycopersicon esculentum were infected with Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia
virus and/or Tomato yellow leaf curl virus [26]. It should be
noted, however, that not all geminiviruses are phloemlimited [27]. Furthermore, both geminiviruses and phytoplasmas share at least one common insect vector (leafhoppers) that is essential for transmission between plants
[21,27]. It is conceivable that extrachromosomal replicons of phytoplasmas evolved by acquisition of the capsid-coding gene to give rise to geminiviruses.
In order to test this possibility, we focused on the capsid
protein (CP) of geminiviruses. BLAST searches [25]
against viral protein database at NCBI using CP sequences
of geminiviruses as seeds revealed no possible homologues from viral families other than Geminiviridae. Since
tertiary structure of the protein is usually more conserved
than the primary one, structural comparisons of viral CPs
have been previously proven to be useful by revealing
connections between viral families that cannot be
deduced from the sequence analysis alone [6,28]. Unfortunately, high resolution X-ray data on CP of geminiviruses is not available. We therefore approached structure
prediction of CPs from four geminiviruses representing
each of the four genera in the family Geminiviridae. Protein sequences of Panicum streak virus (Swiss-Prot:
Q00323 Mastrevirus), Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus ([GenBank:]; Begomovirus), Horseradish curly top virus ([GenBank:]; Curtovirus) and Tomato pseudo-curly top virus
([GenBank:]; Topocuvirus) were downloaded from the
NCBI protein database and submitted to the Structure Prediction MetaServer [29]. There are currently 231 icosahedral virus structures solved by X-ray crystallography and
deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These structures are from bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic viruses
that belong to 29 different viral familes [30]. Out of all
these icosahedral virus structures CP of Satellite tobacco
necrosis virus (STNV) was found to be the only suitable
template for structural modeling with significant scores
for all four geminiviral CPs. In order to further corroborate this prediction we constructed 3D models of the four
geminiviral CPs (Fig. 4A) and tested the stereochemical
quality, along with the X-ray structure of the STNV CP (see
Methods for details). Comparison of the obtained results
(Fig. 4B) supported the reliability of the models indicating that CPs of geminiviruses have a potential to adopt the
same fold as the CP of STNV – an eight stranded (βB-βI)
β-barrel fold (with two sheets BIDG and CHEF) also
known as the viral jelly-roll [28,31]. This observation
leads to an intriguing conclusion that structurally similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/112

viruses may employ different nucleic acids (RNA versus
DNA) as their genetic material.
Next, we superimposed the structural models of the STNV
and geminiviral CPs and extracted the structure-based
sequence alignment (Fig. 4C). Of the 184 STNV CP amino
acid residues for which structural information is available
[PDB:2buk], 69.1% had corresponding amino acids in at
least one of the four geminiviral CP sequences (75 identical and 52 similar residues) (Fig. 4C). Given the fact that
all geminiviral CPs are true homologues, our observation
indicates that STNV and geminiviral CPs share not only
tertiary but also significantly similar primary structures
which further justifies the suggested relationship between
these viral CPs. It is obvious from Fig. 4 that secondary
structure elements are well conserved and that insertions
in the loop regions between β-sheets account for the larger
size of geminiviral CPs. The most prominent insertions
are observed in the CP of mastrevirus (between βB and
βC, and between βF and βG) and begomovirus (between
βC and βD, and between βD and βE). The βD/βE loop was
identified as essential for controlling whitefly transmission of begomoviruses [32], whereas the βF/βG loop was
proposed to be required for leafhopper transmission [33].
It is notable that the eight stranded β-barrel fold is characteristic to all icosahedral ssRNA plant and animal viruses
[28] as well as to ssDNA viruses of the Microviridae and
Parvoviridae families [34]. Previously, twinned particles of
two geminiviruses, Maize streak virus (MSV; Mastrevirus)
and African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV; Begomovirus), were
resolved using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and
image reconstruction techniques to 25 Å [35] and 16–19
Å [33] resolution, respectively. In both studies the CP of
STNV was also found to be the best template for structural
modeling of the geminiviral CPs. Successful fitting of the
pseudo-atomic model of MSV CP into the cryo-EM density map [35] strongly corroborates the prediction that
CPs of STNV and geminiviruses share the same fold.
All these observations suggest a possible scenario for the
origin of geminiviruses. Phylogenetic and clustering analyses of the geminiviral Rep proteins (Figs. 2, 3) indicate
that they share a more recent common ancestor with Reps
of plasmids from phytoplasmas rather than from other
bacteria or viruses. There are two possible ways to explain
this relationship. One is that a phytoplasmal cell, while
being inside the plant cell, internalized the genome of a
geminivirus-like agent, replication and partitioning of
which was subsequently stabilized along with the loss of
a CP-coding gene. The other possibility is that phytoplasmal plasmids released upon lysis of the bacterial cell in
the cytoplasm of the host plant cell were able to obtain a
capsid-coding gene from an unknown plant virus. The
former possibility seems unlikely since some geminivi-

ruses not only maintained features of prokaryotic replicons, such as typical bacterial promoter sequences [36],
but what is more surprising, are in some instances still
able to replicate their DNA in bacterial cells [37,38]. We
were unable to identify any other proteins in addition to
RCR Reps common to both, phytoplasmal plasmids and
geminiviruses. However, this is not surprising, since protein content required for successful persistence inside bacterial (for plasmids) and plant (for geminiviruses) cells is
likely to be different. Furthermore, the capsid volume is a
limiting factor dictating the amount of genetic information that can be packaged. So, there is a strong pressure on
the genome content of viruses with small capsids leading
to the loss of genetic information unnecessary for virus
propagation.
What virus might be a donor of a capsid-coding gene to
the escaping phytoplasmal plasmid? The vast majority of
plant viruses have RNA genomes. Modeling of the geminiviral CP suggests that it folds into the eight-stranded βbarrel (Fig. 4A), a fold common to all isometric ssRNA
plant viruses. Notably, STNV encodes a single protein, a
capsid protein, which was found to be the closest nongeminiviral relative of the geminiviral CP out of the 231
icosahedral virus capsid proteins whose X-ray structures
are currently available at the PDB [30]. STNV possesses the
simplest capsid formed from 60 subunits of the CP
arranged into T = 1 icosahedral lattice [31]. Pentamers of
the CP are the building blocks of the STNV particles [39].
The same is true for geminiviruses [34]. Geminivirus virions are composed of two incomplete icosahedra (110
copies of CP in MSV) that are joined together [35] (Fig.
1A). Such virion architecture is unique to geminiviruses
and is not observed in any other currently known viruses.
While the interior volume of the isometric particles is sufficient to pack 1,239 bp of the STNV genome, it is unable
to accommodate the larger (2.5 – 3.0 kb [12]) genome of
geminiviruses. Interestingly, it was found that the CP of
geminiviruses produces not only twinned wild-type capsids but also isometric and even capsids formed of three
incomplete icosahedra (Fig. 1) [40-42]. The valency of the
capsid apparently correlates with the length of the packed
nucleic acid. It has been shown that noninfectious isometric T = 1 MSV particles contain subgenomic MSV DNA
fragments from about 0.2 kb to nearly half of the wildtype genome [40]. Such heterogeneity in particle size and
production of noninfectious particles per se might be seen
as an indication of ongoing optimization and adaptation
of the CP, which was originally utilized to form smaller
(isometric) particles, to build larger capsids. Taking into
account the high nucleotide substitution rate in geminiviruses, which is similar to that of RNA viruses [43], the
sequence conservation between STNV and geminiviral
CPs as well as between phytoplasmal plasmid and geminiviral Reps is striking. It is possible that the emergence of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/112

the ancestor geminivirus from a phytoplasmal plasmid
and an RNA virus occurred relatively recently on the evolutionary timescale. Although less likely, the possibility of
the convergent evolution cannot be ruled out either.
An alternative hypothesis for the origin of geminiviruses is
that they are descendants of as yet undiscovered ssDNA
viruses with geminiviral-like Reps that have acquired their
CP-coding genes either from an RNA or DNA virus by horizontal gene transfer. Indeed, recent metagenomic analysis of samples from a rice paddy soil unveiled the presence
of putatively viral replicons with geminivirus/phytoplasma-like Reps but not other geminiviral genes [44].
Unfortunately, metagenomic studies do not provide any
information on the origin of the amplified replicons,
making it impossible to know with certainty that the
amplified DNA does not belong to geminiviruses or plasmids. Therefore, there is currently no evidence to support
the hypothesis predicting the existence of a virus that
would be a missing link between geminiviruses and other
ssDNA viruses.
If geminiviruses originated from phytoplasmal plasmids,
is it possible that similar transitions happened several
times to give rise to different viral families? As mentioned
above, RCR Rep of the Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum
plasmid p4M [GenBank:AAM00235] was previously
shown to be more similar to Reps of various circoviruses
than it is to Reps from other bacterial plasmids and viruses
[19]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that circoviruses
might also be direct descendants of bacterial plasmids.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic as well as complete linkage clustering analysis of RCR Rep proteins from geminiviruses suggests their
evolutionary relationship with Rep proteins of phytoplasmal plasmids, while structural modeling of the geminiviral CP points to a connection between geminiviruses and
icosahedral ssRNA viruses. We suggest a scenario for the
origin of geminiviruses in which acquisition of the capsid
protein-coding gene from an ssRNA plant virus by phytoplasmal plasmid gave rise to the ancestor of geminiviruses. This scenario involves two assumptions. First, there
was a coinfection of the same plant cell by a phytoplasma
and an ssRNA virus. Indeed, such a coinfection has been
previously observed. Sugarcane phloem was found to frequently contain both phytoplasmas and Sugarcane yellow
leaf viruses (an icosahedral ssRNA virus) [45,46]. The second assumption is that recombination occurred between
the RNA genome of a virus and the DNA molecule of a
plasmid. Although recombination between RNA and
DNA viruses is not common, there is evidence pointing to
the possibility of such gene exchange in the viral world
[47,48]. The scenario proposed here implies that geminiviruses emerged in plant cells through introduction of a

Page 8 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:112

structural element (capsid-coding gene) of a plant virus
into a plasmid liberated from a plant infecting bacterium.
Although this plasmid-to-virus transition does not satisfy
the requirements of de novo virogenesis, since a preexisting
viral building block was utilized for virion formation, it
nevertheless accounts for the emergence of a novel virus
family, the Geminiviridae. Consequently, the borderline
between the two selfish genetic elements – viruses and
plasmids – becomes transparent.

Methods
Data collection and phylogenetic analysis
Koonin and Ilyina (1992) found that geminiviral rollingcircle replication (RCR) initiation proteins (Rep) are
related to certain bacterial Reps [17]. In order to obtain a
dataset for phylogenetic analysis of geminiviral Reps we
set out to get all bacterial RCR Reps from the nonredundant protein database at NCBI using PSI-BLAST searches
(BLOSUM62 matrix, 0.05 as an E-value cutoff) [25]. Surprisingly, only RCR Reps from phytoplasmal plasmids
were identified using this approach. To extend the dataset,
we carried out an alternative approach, pattern matching.
Rolling circle replication proteins of geminiviruses contain five conserved motifs that are essential for the activity
[13-16]. Based on this knowledge, an exact geminivirusspecific sequence pattern, encompassing all the five conserved motifs, was generated: F(T

[ST]X(1,100)DD. The residues shown in square brackets are alternatives; X – any amino acid; numbers in parentheses denote the allowed distance between
corresponding motifs; slash sign indicates alternation of
the dipeptides in the second and third positions in the
pattern. The non-redundant protein sequences and environmental protein sequences from BLAST database were
downloaded (07.02.2009) from NCBI FTP site and
searched for sequences exactly matching the derived pattern without paying attention to the sequences surrounding the conserved motifs (as long as their length falls in
the range specified in the pattern). Using this approach
sequences missed by BLAST searches are expected to be
found. 1072 protein sequences were initially extracted. In
order to avoid redundancy, the original dataset was subsequently filtered to leave only sequences with less than
70% identity. As a result, a dataset containing 43 protein
sequences was obtained. Of these two sequences were
false-positive – a 799 amino acid-long hypothetical protein [GenBank:XP_001614627] from Plasmodium vivax
SaI-1 and a 440 amino acid-long hypothetical TrmE
domain protein GOS_1133298 [GenBank:EDE42344]
from marine metagenome project, which were not
included in the further analysis. The resultant dataset (41
sequences) was used to create a multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTALW [49]. One geminiviral sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/112

[GenBank:ABD67440] was found to be considerably
longer (469 aa) than the rest of the sequences. The protein
was found to be a fusion of RCR Rep and geminiviral transcriptional activator AC2 and was therefore removed from
the alignment. The 40 sequences were realigned and following manual examination and editing the subsequent
alignment [see Additional file 1] was utilized for phylogenetic analysis. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried
out by using PhyML v2.4.4 [23], with a WAG [50] model
of amino acid substitution, including a gamma law with 4
categories to take into account differences in evolutionary
rates at sites, and an estimated proportion of invariable
sites. The robustness of the tree was assessed by bootstrap
analysis (1,000 replicates). Bayesian phylogenetic tree was
constructed using MrBayes [24] with a mixed model of
amino-acid substitution and a Gamma-law (eight discrete
classes). MrBayes was run with four chains for 2.1 × 106
generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations. To construct the consensus tree, the first 25% of the
trees were discarded as "burnin".
Complete linkage clustering analysis
Multiple sequence alignment [see Additional file 1] was
used to calculate the pairwise distance matrix with
MEGA4 [51]. Analyses were conducted using the Poisson
correction method. All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete
deletion option). There were a total of 178 positions in
the final dataset. The calculated pairwise distances were
used to perform complete linkage clustering analysis,
where the distance between two clusters is defined as the
distance between the two farthest objects in the two clusters. At each round the clusters are examined and split to
two clusters according to the longest distance. The members of the clusters were then grouped within the new
cluster that has a shorter distance. The clustering was run
until all sequences formed their own clusters.
Structural modeling
BioInfoBank MetaServer [29] was used for prediction of
the tertiary structures. The structure of STNV capsid protein (CP) [31] was determined to be the best template for
structural modeling with significance scores ranging from
57.67 – 82.50; scores above 50 are assumed to be significant and correspond to a prediction accuracy of above
90% [29]. The sequences of the geminiviral CPs were individually aligned with the corresponding protein sequence
of STNV using version 9.2 of the MODELLER program
[52]. Align2d algorithm of the MODELLER program is different from standard sequence-sequence alignment methods because it takes into account structural information
from the template when constructing an alignment. This
task is achieved through a variable gap penalty function
that tends to place gaps in solvent exposed and curved
regions, outside secondary structure segments, and

between two positions that are close in space. The resulting alignments were utilized to build the three-dimensional models of the four geminiviral CPs using the
MODELLER. Ten variants of each CP were generated and
one of them was chosen on the basis of having the best
stereochemical quality, which was validated using MolProbity [53]. The structural superpositioning of the models with the X-ray structure of the STNV CP was performed
using the STAMP algorithm [54], and the results were visualized with the VMD program [55].
