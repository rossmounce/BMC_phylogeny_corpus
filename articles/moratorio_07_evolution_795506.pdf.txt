Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the subject of intense research and clinical investigation as its major
role in human disease has emerged. Previous and recent studies have suggested a diversification of type 1 HCV in the
South American region. The degree of genetic variation among HCV strains circulating in Bolivia and Colombia is
currently unknown. In order to get insight into these matters, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of HCV 5' noncoding region (5'NCR) sequences from strains isolated in Bolivia, Colombia and Uruguay, as well as available comparable
sequences of HCV strains isolated in South America.
Methods: Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method under a matrix of genetic
distances established under the Kimura-two parameter model. Signature pattern analysis, which identifies particular sites
in nucleic acid alignments of variable sequences that are distinctly representative relative to a background set, was
performed using the method of Korber & Myers, as implemented in the VESPA program. Prediction of RNA secondary
structures was done by the method of Zuker & Turner, as implemented in the mfold program.
Results: Phylogenetic tree analysis of HCV strains isolated in the South American region revealed the presence of a
distinct genetic lineage inside genotype 1. Signature pattern analysis revealed that the presence of this lineage is consistent
with the presence of a sequence signature in the 5'NCR of HCV strains isolated in South America. Comparisons of these
results with the ones found for Europe or North America revealed that this sequence signature is characteristic of the
South American region.

Conclusion: Phylogentic analysis revealed the presence of a sequence signature in the 5'NCR of type 1 HCV strains
isolated in South America. This signature is frequent enough in type 1 HCV populations circulating South America to be
detected in a phylogenetic tree analysis as a distinct type 1 sub-population. The coexistence of distinct type 1 HCV
subpopulations is consistent with quasispecies dynamics, and suggests that multiple coexisting subpopulations may allow
the virus to adapt to its human host populations.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170
million people worldwide and therefore creates a huge
disease burden due to chronic, progressive liver disease
[1]. Infections with HCV have become a major cause of
liver cancer and one of the most common indications for
liver transplantation [2-4]. The virus has been classified in
the family Flaviviridae, although it differs from other
members of the family in many details of its genome
organization [2].
HCV is an enveloped virus with an RNA genome of
approximately 9400 bp in length. Most of the genome
forms a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes
three structural (core, E1, E2) and seven non-structural
(p7, NS2-NS5B) proteins. Short untranslated regions at
each end of the genome (5'NCR and 3'NCR) are required
for replication of the genome. This process also requires a
cis-acting replication element in the coding sequence of
NS5B recently described [5]. Translation of the single ORF
is dependent on an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in
the 5'NCR, which interacts directly with the 40S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation [6].
Comparison of nucleotide sequences of variants recovered from different individuals and geographical regions
has revealed the existence of six major genetic groups [1].
Each of the six major genetic groups of HCV contains a
series of more closely related sub-types.
Little is known about the earlier divergence of the six
major genotypes of HCV, the origins of infection in
humans and the underlying bases of the current geographical distribution of genotypes. Some genotypes, such as
1a, 1b or 3a have become widely distributed and now are
responsible for the vast majority of infections in Western
countries [2].
Genotype 1 is the most prevalent type in the Latin American region [7]. Previous and recent studies on genetic variation of HCV revealed a diversification of type 1 HCV
strains circulating in that region [8-12]. There is no knowledge about the degree of genetic variability of HCV strains
circulating in Bolivia and Colombia. This study aimed to
elucidate these matters by performing a phylogenetic
analysis of 5'NCR sequences from type 1 HCV strains
recently isolated in Bolivia, Colombia and Uruguay, as

well as available comparable sequences of HCV strains
isolated in other regions of South America. In order to
compare the results found for the South American region
with other regions of the world, the same approach was
used to perform a phylogenetic analysis of HCV strains
isolated in Europe and North America.

Results
Phylogenetic tree analysis of HCV strains isolated in the
South American region
To study the degree of genetic variation of HCV strains isolated in Bolivia and Colombia, sequences from the 5'NCR
of Bolivian, Colombian and Uruguayan strains recently
isolated by us, as well as all available comparable
sequences (i.e. longer than 220 nucleotides) from HCV
strains isolated in the South American region were
aligned. Once aligned, phylogenetic trees were created by
the neighbor-joining method applied to a distance matrix
obtained under the Kimura two-parameter model [13]. As
a measure of the robustness of each node, we employed
the bootstrap method (1000 pseudo-replicas). The results
of these studies are shown in Fig. 1A.

All HCV strains included in this study are clustered
according to their genotype. Inside the main cluster of
type 1 strains, different genetic lineages can be observed.
One main line represents sub-type 1b strains (Fig. 1A,
upper part), another represents type 1a strains (Fig. 1A,
middle). Interestingly, type 1 HCV strains isolated in
Bolivia, Colombia and some of the Uruguayan strains do
not clustered together with major type 1 sub-types (1a and
1b). Instead, they are assigned to a different genetic lineage
together
with
strains
[EMBL:DQ077818],
[EMBL:AY376833] and [EMBL:DQ313454], recently
reported by Gismondi et al.[8,9] and Schijman et al.
(EMBL database submissions) as a new type 1 genetic lineage circulating in Argentina (see Fig. 1A, middle, cluster
in red).
To observe if similar results can be found in other geographic regions of the world, the same studies were carried
out for strains isolated in North America and Europe. The
results of these studies are shown in Figs. 1B and 1C,
respectively.
As it can be seen in the figures, while three different clusters can be clearly identified in HCV type 1 strains isolated

[EMBL:DQ077818] (Schijman et al., unpublished data), [EMBL:DQ313454] and [EMBL:AY376833] (Gismondi et al. [8, 9] previously reported as a new genetic lineage inside type 1 strains are shown in italics and an arrows denote its position in the figure.
Phylogeny for HCV strains isolated in North America and Europe are shown in (B), (C), respectively.

in South America, this is not observed for type 1 strains
isolated in North America or Europe (compare Fig. 1A
with Figs. 1B and 1C).
Signature pattern analysis of type 1 HCV strains isolated in
South America
In order to test if the presence of the third phylogenetic
lineage in type 1 HCV strains isolated in South America
was due to a particular sequence signature, present exclusively in HCV strains assigned to that lineage, a signature
pattern analysis was performed to assess viral sequence
relatedness. For that purpose, a query dataset of 19 type 1
HCV sequences belonging to this third cluster was analyzed using a background dataset of 19 type 1 HCV
sequences assigned to the two other clusters found in the
South American region (see Fig. 1A). The results of these
studies detected the presence of a sequence signature in
type 1 HCV strains assigned to the third genetic lineage in
the phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 2). Comparison of the
frequencies obtained for each particular nucleotide and
position in the signature gives statistical support to these
findings (Table 1). When similar studies were performed
using the same query dataset and background datasets of
sequences from strains isolated in Europe or North America, similar results were obtained (Table 1). These results
suggest that the sequence signature found in HCV type 1
strains isolated in South America may be characteristic of
this geographic region of the world. To observe if this
nucleotide sequence signature can be found indeed in
strains isolated outside the South American region, BLAST
studies were performed using sequences from strains bearing the sequence signature as a query against all HCV
strains reported to HCV LANL Database [14]. Only strains
isolated in the South American region have 100% similarity to the signature sequence strains (not shown).
Prediction of secondary structure of signature RNA
sequences
Biochemical and functional studies have revealed that the
5'NCR of HCV folds into a highly ordered complex structure with multiple stem-loops [15]. This complex RNA
structure contains four distinct domains, with domains II,
III and part of domain IV forming the IRES. These highly
folded secondary RNA elements function as cis-signals for
interaction with the 40S ribosome subunit and/or eukaryotic translation initiation factors [6]. Signature mutations
map in IRES stem-loops II (G107A) and III (G243A,
C247U and U248C) relative to strain HCV1b [16] (see
Fig. 3).

To observe how these substitutions may affect IRES secondary RNA structure, predicted secondary structures of
HCV IRES domains II and III of consensus dataset
sequences of type 1 strains isolated in South America
(background dataset) and consensus signature sequence

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/79

dataset (query dataset) were compared. The results of
these studies are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.
As it can be seen in Fig. 4, the predicted secondary structure of domains II of background and signature consensus
sequences give similar structures. Nevertheless, mutation
A107 in the sequence signature might help to stabilize a
buckle in the structure by base pairing with U75 (compare
Figs. 4A and 4B).
In the case of IRES stem-loop III predicted secondary
structure, similar structures have also been obtained for
background and signature sequences (see Fig. 5). Nevertheless, mutations in stem-loop III does not seem to have
a particular effect in loop III folding (compare Figs. 5A
and 5B).

Discussion
Phylogenetic tree analysis of the 5'NCR from HCV strains
isolated in South America revealed that genotype 1 is the
most predominant in that region, in agreement with previous results [7]. There are no previous reports on the
genetic variation of HCV circulating in Bolivia. All Bolivian strains enrolled in these studies have been clearly
assigned to genotype 1. Although more studies will be
needed in order to have a definitive picture on the degree
of genetic heterogeneity of HCV strains circulating in
Bolivia, the results of these studies suggests that genotype
1 might also be prevalent in that country (see Fig. 1A). In
the case of Colombia, previous studies suggested the presence of genotype 1 and 3 [17]. This is in agreement with
the results found in the present study. Interestingly, the
phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of genotype 4
in Colombia for the first time (see Fig. 1A, bottom). This
genotype is prevalent in the Middle East [2] and not particularly in the South American region, although genotype
4 has been also found in Argentina [7]. More studies will
be needed to address the epidemiological situation of this
genotype in Colombia.
The phylogenetic analysis of HCV strains isolated in South
America also revealed the presence of a new genetic lineage in HCV type 1 strains (Fig. 1A). These results are in
agreement with previous ones obtained for type 1 HCV
isolates circulating in Central and South America [8-12].
These previous data have suggested the presence of a distinct type 1 HCV sub-population in South America and a
diversification of HCV in that region. In this study, we
have analyzed more than 150 HCV strains isolated in
South America. The results of this work revealed that the
third type 1 sub-population observed in the phylogenetic
tree analysis of the HCV strains isolated in South America
is in fact due to the presence of a particular nucleotide signature sequence (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This sequence signature is frequent enough to be detected in a phylogenetic

tree analysis as a distinct type 1 sub-population (see Fig.
1A). Nevertheless, when the same analysis is carried out in
type 1 HCV strains isolated in Europe or North America,
only two genetic lineages are observed which correspond
to the major type 1 sub-types (see Fig. 1B and 1C).
Sequence signature pattern analysis has been useful for
epidemiological linkage, to corroborate transmission link
hypothesis or sequence relatedness studies [18-21]. The
identification of a sequence signature in the 5'NCR of type
1 HCV strains isolated in South America may permit a
more in-depth study on the molecular epidemiology of
HCV in this region.
Nevertheless, more studies will be needed to determine
the extent of distribution of this particular signature.
BLAST studies, on the other hand, have shown that only
type 1 HCV strains circulating in the South American
region have 100% similarity to the nucleotide sequence
signature found in that region.
HCV, as many other RNA viruses, replicates as complex
mutant distributions termed quasispecies [22-25]. Quasispecies dynamics is characterized by continuous generation of variant viral genomes, competition among them,
and selection of the fittest mutant distributions in any
given environment [23]. The coexistence of distinct type 1
HCV subpopulations is consistent with quasispecies
dynamics, and suggests that multiple coexisting subpopulations may occupy different regions on a fitness landscape to allow the virus to adapt rapidly to changes in the
landscape topology. This, in turn, may allow the virus to
adapt to its human host populations.
The 5'NCR, even though is one of the most conserved part
of the virus genome, shows a quasispecies distribution
with minor variants observed in the population [26] (Fig.
3). Since virus particles in serum are likely to be released
from the liver but also from compartments such as lymphocytes or dendritic cells, it has been suggested that the
sequence diversity found in the IRESs may reflect their

translational activity and tropism for these compartments
[27-29].
If all this is correct, the results of these studies may also be
related to these facts. Owing to the error-prone nature of
the HCV polymerase, mutations are expected to occur randomly distributed over the 5'NCR. However, only mutations compatible with replication and translation can be
propagated. Whether the stem-loop II and III mutations
observed confer a survival advantage or disadvantage in
vivo remains unknown. Nevertheless, the in silico predicted RNA secondary structures of IRES stem-loops suggest that some mutations in the signature sequence might
have an effect in IRES structure. Further work with HCV
replicons containing the observed signature mutations
may help to clarify this point.
The unique structure of the HCV IRES makes it an attractive target for the development of antiviral agents directed
against this RNA element [30]. Mapping sequence signatures in that region may help to understand their effects in
HCV IRES functions.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a sequence
signature in the 5'NCR of type 1 HCV strains isolated in
South America. This signature is frequent enough in type
1 HCV populations circulating South America to be
detected in a phylogenetic tree analysis as a distinct type 1
sub-population. The coexistence of distinct type 1 HCV
subpopulations is consistent with quasispecies dynamics,
and suggests that multiple coexisting subpopulations may
allow the virus to adapt to its human host populations.

Methods
Serum samples
Serum samples were obtained from 7 volunteer blood
donors from Banco de Sangre de Referencia Departamental, La Paz, Bolivia, 14 volunteer blood donors from
Banco de Sangre de la Cruz Roja, Bogotá, Colombia and

gre, Montevideo, Uruguay. All patients tested positive in
an enzyme immunoassay from Abbott, used accordingly
to manufacturer's instructions. All patients were from La
Paz, Bogotá and Montevideo, respectively. For epidemiological data of Bolivian, Colombian and Uruguayan
strains, see Table 2.
PCR amplification of 5'NCR of HCV strains
The 5'NCR of the HCV genome from samples that were
reactive in the enzyme immunoassay were amplified by
PCR, as previously described [31,32]. To avoid false positive results, the recommendations of Kwok and Higuchi
[33] were strictly adhered to. Amplicons were purified
using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from QIAGEN,
according to instructions from the manufacturers.

Sequencing of PCR amplicons
The same primers used for amplification were used for
sequencing the PCR fragments, and the sequence reaction
was carried out using the Big Dye DNA sequencing kit
(Perkin-Elmer) on a 373 DNA sequencer apparatus (Perkin-Elmer). Both strands of the PCR product were
sequenced in order to avoid discrepancies. 5'NCR
sequences from position 62 through 285 (relative to the
genome of strain AF009606, sub-type 1A) were obtained.
For sequence accession numbers of Bolivian, Colombian
and Uruguayan HCV strains, see Table 2.

the LANL HCV Database [14]. Sequences were aligned
using the CLUSTAL W program [34]. Phylogenetic trees
were generated by the neighbor-joining method under a
matrix of genetic distances established under the Kimuratwo parameter model [13], using the MEGA3 program
[35]. The robustness of each node was assessed by bootstrap resampling (1,000 pseudo-replicas).
Signature pattern analysis
Signature pattern analysis identifies particular sites in
amino acid or nucleic acid alignments of variable
sequences that are distinctly representative of a query set
relative to a background set. We employed the method

described by Korber & Myers [36] as implemented in the
VESPA program [37]. Sequences in the query and background datasets where aligned using the CLUSTAL W program [34] and then transformed to the FASTA format
using the MEGA 3 program [35]. The query set was
formed by 19 type 1 HCV sequences isolated in South
America and representative of the third genetic lineage
identified in the phylogenetic tree analysis (see Fig. 1A).
The background set was formed by 19 type 1 HCV
sequences isolated in South America. The same studies
were performed using background sets of 19 type 1 HCV
strains isolated in Europe or North America. The threshold was set to 0 (the program will use the majority consen-

particular base pair. The folding temperature was set to
37°C. Ionic conditions was set to 1M NaCl, non divalent
ions. Base pairs that occur in all predicted folding structures are colored black. Otherwise, base pairs are assigned
in a multi-color mode that displays precisely what foldings contain that base pair.

Sequence similarity studies
Sequence similarity among query signature strain URU2
and all HCV strains of all types, isolated elsewhere, was
established using BLAST program [38], using the HCV
LANL Database [14].

Competing interests

Prediction of RNA secondary structure
Secondary structure prediction was done by the method
of Zuker & Turner [39], as implemented in the mfold program (version 3.2) [40]. The core algorithm of this
method predicts a minimum free energy, ΔG, as well as
