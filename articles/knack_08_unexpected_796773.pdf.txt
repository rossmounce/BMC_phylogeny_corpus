Abstract
Background: Adhesion mediated through the integrin family of cell surface receptors is central
to early development throughout the Metazoa, playing key roles in cell-extra cellular matrix
adhesion and modulation of cadherin activity during the convergence and extension movements of
gastrulation. It has been suggested that Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a single β and two α
integrins, might reflect the ancestral integrin complement. Investigation of the integrin repertoire
of anthozoan cnidarians such as the coral Acropora millepora is required to test this hypothesis and
may provide insights into the original roles of these molecules.
Results: Two novel integrins were identified in Acropora. AmItgα1 shows features characteristic
of α integrins lacking an I-domain, but phylogenetic analysis gives no clear indication of its likely
binding specificity. AmItgβ2 lacks consensus cysteine residues at positions 8 and 9, but is otherwise
a typical β integrin. In situ hybridization revealed that AmItgα1, AmItgβ1, and AmItgβ2 are
expressed in the presumptive endoderm during gastrulation. A second anthozoan, the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis, has at least four β integrins, two resembling AmItgβ1 and two like
AmItgβ2, and at least three α integrins, based on its genomic sequence.
Conclusion: In two respects, the cnidarian data do not fit expectations. First, the cnidarian
integrin repertoire is more complex than predicted: at least two βs in Acropora, and at least three
αs and four βs in Nematostella. Second, whereas the bilaterian αs resolve into well-supported
groups corresponding to those specific for RGD-containing or laminin-type ligands, the known
cnidarian αs are distinct from these. During early development in Acropora, the expression patterns
of the three known integrins parallel those of amphibian and echinoderm integrins.

Background
Integrins are a large family of cell surface transmembrane
receptors known only from metazoans, which function in
intracellular signalling as well as cell-cell and cell-extracel-

lular matrix (ECM) adhesion [1]. As the main mediators
of cell-ECM interactions they are key players in early
development [2] functioning in gastrulation by rapid
modulation of their own adhesion between low and high

affinity states and by modulating the activities of adhesion molecules (e.g. cadherins) in cell layers undergoing
convergence and extension [3].
Integrins function as αβ heterodimers with several subunits of each type being present in most animals. Analyses
of the whole genome sequence of Caenorhabditis elegans
[4,5] indicate that it has a single β subunit of the β1 type
that is capable of associating with two α subunits, which
confer specificity for either laminin- or RGD-containing
ligands, and it has been suggested that this may reflect the
ancestral state. Drosophila melanogaster has five α and two
β subunits [5] and mammals, eighteen α and eight β
integrin subunits [6]. In each case, however, integrin subunits above and beyond likely orthologs of the two αs and
one β of Caenorhabditis are clearly lineage-specific.
"Lower" animals are of particular significance in terms of
understanding the ancestral state, but have not been
extensively studied. Both α and β integrin subunits have
been identified in sponges [7-9], and cnidarians
[7,10,11], but the extent of integrin diversity and the
range of functions of these molecules in "lower" animals
are unknown.
Anthozoan cnidarians such as the coral Acropora millepora
and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis appear to have
retained much of the genetic complexity of the metazoan
common ancestor [12,13]; hence these animals are likely
to be highly informative with respect to the ancestral
integrin complement and may provide insights into the
original roles of these molecules. Known cnidarian
integrins include a β integrin from Acropora millepora [7]
and single α and β subunits (IntA and IntB) from the
hydrozoan jellyfish Podocoryne carnea [11]. Here we report
the characterisation of novel β and α integrins from Acropora. The known Acropora integrins are expressed during
gastrulation in patterns like those seen at the corresponding stages of echinoderm and amphibian development.
However, we know from morphological observation
[14,15] that Acropora gastrulation is not a simple epithelial to mesenchymal transition in which the expressing
cells lose their adhesivity and invaginate. Instead, in Acropora it is clear that changing cell shape also plays a major
role[14]. Two further implications of this work are that
the cnidarian integrin complement is significantly more
complex than was predicted, and that functional diversification of α integrins may have occurred independently in
Cnidaria and Bilateria.

Results
Identification of novel integrins
Three unigenes encoding integrin subunits were identified
during an ongoing EST analysis of Acropora millepora
[13,16]. One of these corresponds to the previously
known Acropora integrin β Cn1 [7]; to simplify compara-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/136

tive analyses, this integrin is henceforth referred to as
AmItgβ1. Complete sequences were determined for cDNA
clones corresponding to the other two integrin unigenes;
comparative analyses indicated that an EST clone corresponding to a second β subunit (AmItgβ2) encodes a full
length protein of 771 amino acids, whilst an α integrin
EST clone lacked the 5' end of the open reading frame. To
complete the 1021 amino acid integrin α coding
sequence, overlapping clones were isolated from a cDNA
library, enabling the determination of the complete open
reading frame for a molecule designated AmItgα1. These
sequences have been submitted to GenBank under the following accession numbers: EU239371 (AmItgα1) and
EU239372 (AmItgβ2).
AmItgβ2 is a possible coral ortholog of a known jellyfish
integrin β
Database comparisons identified AmItgβ2 as a possible
ortholog of integrin β (IntB; Q9GSF3) from Podocoryne
[11]. Previously Reber-Muller et al. [11] suggested that
Podocoryne IntB was orthologous with AmItgβ1; however,
the former not only has higher overall sequence identity
with AmItgβ2 (44% amino acid identity compared to
<40%), but also shows the same atypical pattern of
cysteine residues (Fig. 1, 2) Whereas the β integrin extracellular domain characteristically contains 56 cysteine residues arranged in a specific pattern [7], in both Podocoryne
IntB [11] and AmItgβ2, cysteine residues at positions 8
and 9 in the canonical structure are absent as occurs in vertebrate β4-type integrins. In terms of most other structural
features, however, both AmItgβ2 and Podocoryne IntB are
typical integrin βs – the MIDAS domain, cysteine-rich
stalk and transmembrane region are all clearly present. In
both cases, the DxSxS motif of the MIDAS cation-binding
domain [17] is completely conserved, whereas the DDL
motif of the ADMIDAS is changed to EDL in AmItgβ2
(Fig. 1). The cytoplasmic domains contain the conserved
membrane proximal sequence KLLxxxxD and two NPxY/F
motifs (NPIF and NPTY in AmItgβ2, NPIY and NPMY in
IntB). Whereas the degree of similarity between these
Acropora and Podocoryne sequences implies that these
might be orthologs, one complicating factor is that the
Nematostella genome appears to encode two integrins of
the AmItgβ2 type (see below). Hence orthology relationships will only be clear when more complete datasets are
available for Acropora and Podocoryne.
AmItgα1 is a cnidarian integrin resembling the vertebrate
α4/9-type
Comparative analyses indicate that AmItgα1 shares some
characteristics with those integrin α subunits that lack an
α-A (I) domain. Database comparisons revealed that
AmItgα1 is most similar to mouse integrin α9 (MmItgα9;
Q91YD5; 28% identity and 48% similarity). Whereas the

β integrin alignments (amino terminal end of the molecules). Amino acid sequence of AmItgβ2 aligned with representative β integrin sequences. Atypical absence of cysteines (yellow, numbered) from positions 8 and 9 suggests orthology
between AmItgβ2 and Podocoryne IntB (PcIntB). Structural features including the MIDAS motif (DLSXS, underlined), transmembrane region (long wavy line), membrane proximal motif (short wavy line), and two NPxY/F motifs (double underline) are conserved. The ADMIDAS motif (DDL, underlined) is changed to EDL in AmItgβ2. An arrow indicates the position where a
deletion was made in the sponge sequence (OtItgβ1) to facilitate alignment. Abbreviations and database accession numbers for
sequences used in the alignment are: Acropora AmItgβ2 (AmItgβ2; EU239372); Podocoryne IntB (PcIntB; AAG25994); Acropora
AmItgβ1 (AmItgβ1; AAB66910); Human β1 (HsItgβ1; P05556); Strongylocentrotus βG (Urchin SpItgβG; AAB39739); Strongylocentrotus βL (SpItgβL; AAC28382); Ophlitaspongia βPo1 (Sponge OtItgβ1; AAB66911).
orthologs (AmItgβ2 and PcIntB) are 44% identical, the α
subunits AmItgα1 and Podocoryne IntA have a much lower
amino acid identity (27%), and there are several differences between these that are likely to have functional and/
or structural significance. Both proteins are typical in
terms of the presence of FG-GAP repeats, transmembrane
regions, membrane proximal KxGFFKR motifs and extracellular cleavage sites fitting the RxK/RR consensus (Fig. 3,

4). However, whereas AmItgα1 is typical in having three
cation binding motifs (DxD/NxD/NxxxD; [18]) within
FG-GAP repeats V, VI, and VII, the three cation binding
sites in Podocoryne IntA are in FG-GAP repeats VI, VII and
immediately C-terminal of repeat VII. Both proteins are
atypical in terms of the positions of cysteine residues relative to the consensus; AmItgα1 is missing Cys residues at
positions 9, 10 and 17, whereas IntB is missing Cys resi-

dues at positions 13 and 14, but both proteins have a
novel Cys pair between consensus positions 10 and 11. A
corresponding extra pair of Cys residues is also present at
the same position in both the Nematostella α integrin predicted from the genome sequence (NvItgα1; see below)
and the atypical Drosophila integrin PS3.
Phylogenetic analyses of the novel integrin sequences
To better understand relationships between the Acropora
sequences and the major integrin types of higher animals,
maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses were
undertaken using MolPhy version 2.3 [19]. Integrin phylogenetics is complicated by high levels of primary
sequence divergence and homoplasy, leading to difficulties in unambiguous alignment of sequences. The analyses presented here are therefore based on extensively
edited alignments. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW via the EBI website, manually edited using JalView,
and used for phylogenetic analyses. In the case of the
integrin α alignment, the output from ClustalW consisted
of 2383 positions and was manually edited to 1091 posi-

tions (20 sequences). The corresponding figures for the
integrin β alignments were 2159 positions prior to editing
and 991 after editing (24 sequences).
The ML phylogenetic analyses of integrin α sequences
(Fig. 5A) are broadly consistent with previous studies; the
resolution of bilaterian sequences into two major clades
corresponding to the major ligand classes RGD (PS2) and
laminin (PS1) is strongly supported. The fact that these
two clades each contain protostome (fly, worm) and deuterostome (human, sea urchin) sequences indicates that
the functional divergence of α integrins had already
occurred in Urbilateria – the common ancestor of bilateral (higher) animals. However, the ML phylogenetic
analyses give no clear indication of the likely ligand specificity of the known cnidarian α integrins. The cnidarian
(Podocoryne, Acropora and Nematostella) α integrins group
together with high bootstrap support (albeit on long
braches which reflects their divergence), the sister group
of this cnidarian integrin α clade being the α4/9 type
integrins (Fig. 5A).

α integrin alignments (amino terminal end of the molecules). The major structural features of alpha integrins lacking
an alpha-A domain are conserved in AmItgα1 including seven FG-GAP repeats (underlined, roman numerals), three DxD/
NxD/NxxxD cation binding sites (double underline), the transmembrane region (long wavy line) and the cytosolic membrane
proximal domain (short wavy line). The position of a putative fourth cation binding site in the Podocoryne sequence is indicated
in red. Arrows mark the positions where regions that could not be unambiguously aligned were removed from the Drosophila
(DmPS2; 219 residues), Caenorhabditis (CePat2; 132 residues) and human (HsItgαV; 6 residues) sequences. Abbreviations and
database accession numbers for sequences used in the alignment are: Acropora AmItgα1 (AmItgα1; EU239371); Podocoryne IntA
(PcIntA; AAG25993); Drosophila αPS2 (DmPS2; P12080); Mouse α9 (MmItgα9; NP_598482); Human αV (HsItgαV; P06756);
Caenorhabditis αPat2 (CePat2; P34446).

ML analyses of the integrin β sequences (Fig. 5B) confirmed the possible orthology of Podocoryne IntB with the
novel Acropora β sequence (AmItgβ2) reported here. Preliminary surveys of the genome sequence of Nematostella
suggest the presence of at least four β integrins, and gene
models (the gene as predicted in the genome assembly,
including the open reading frame, introns and untranslated regions) of these were sufficiently complete for them
to be included in phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 5B) which
group the Nematostella β integrins with the Acropora subu-

nits – two with AmItgβ1 and two with AmItgβ2. It
remains to be seen whether each member of these pairs of
Nematostella genes has an Acropora ortholog. As in the
integrin α phylogeny, the sponge sequences were relatively distant to those from the Cnidaria. Again, the analyses were broadly consistent with previous studies [2022], resolving the vertebrate sequences into three clades
known as β1 (integrin β1/2/7), β3 (integrin β3/5/6/8)
and β4 in the Hughes [20] phylogeny. Unlike the α
integrins, there is no evidence for divergence of β subunits

prior to the protostome/deuterostome split. Rather, it
appears more likely that β integrins have diverged independently in several bilaterian lineages.
Expression of integrins during coral gastrulation
RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that mRNAs encoding each
of the coral integrins (AmItgα1, AmItgβ1 and AmItgβ2)
are present in eggs (Knack et al., unpublished data; [23])
and early developmental stages (Fig. 6) at relatively uni-

form levels. No specific pattern could be detected via in
situ hybridization prior to the prawn chip stage however,
implying that the maternal mRNA is uniformly distributed until this time. In the early development of Acropora,
a clear and specific in situ hybridization pattern for
AmItgα1 is first seen in late prawn chip stage embryos
(early gastrula) (Fig. 7A), the mRNA being localized in a
characteristic pattern on the concave side of the flattened
cell bilayer corresponding to Fig. 4b in Hayward et al.

integrins. Whereas integrins from Bilateria group in a ligand specific manner, consistent with previous phylogenies, the cnidarian sequences form an independent clade, reflecting their early divergence. These groupings suggest that functional divergence
of α integrins had already occurred in the Urbilateria. Sequences aligned, abbreviations, and accession numbers are: Lytechinus

here are consistent with previous phylogenies. The position of sequences within the cnidarian clade is consistent with orthology between Podocoryne IntB (PcIntB) and AmItgβ2, and groups two Nematostella βs with each Acropora β. Unlike the α
integrins, the β integrins appear to have diverged independently in several bilaterian lineages. Sequences aligned, abbreviations,

[14]. Expression is maintained in these presumptive
endodermal cells as the concavity deepens and they are
internalized. Staining remains strong in the presumptive
endoderm until blastopore closure is complete (Fig. 7C),
after which only weak endodermal staining of AmItgα1 is
observed.
The early expression patterns of both AmItgβ1 and
AmItgβ2 (Fig. 7) were broadly similar to that of AmItgα1,
but with the following differences. First, it was only possible to visualize the localization of transcripts corresponding to the β integrins at slightly later stages of
development. Second, whereas AmItgα1 and AmItgβ1
transcripts were tightly restricted at the area of the blast-

opore lip in early gastrulae (Fig 7B and 7E), AmItgβ2 was
also expressed more generally (Fig 7G–I).

Discussion
Whereas Reber-Muller et al. [11] hypothesized the presence of only single α and β integrin subunits in cnidarians, the integrins identified to date in Acropora are likely
to be only a subset of those present. Preliminary surveys
of the genome of Nematostella imply that at least four β
integrins (two resembling AmItgβ1 and two more similar
to AmItgβ2), and at least three distinct α types are present
(data not shown). However, gene models for only one α
integrin were sufficiently complete to allow its inclusion
in the phylogenetic analyses shown as Fig 5A. The integrin

expression throughout development.
repertoire of this morphologically simple animal is therefore considerably more complex than that of Caenorhabditis (one β and two αs), which has often been assumed to
reflect the ancestral metazoan state.
Due to structural constraints on integrin proteins during
evolution, phylogenetic analyses are likely to be complicated by homoplasy effects. The position of the cnidarian
sequences in the α integrin phylogeny (Fig. 5A) is likely
due to both the early divergence of the Cnidaria and
homoplasy effects. Hence, in this case, phylogenetics is
not informative as to ligand binding properties. It is likely
that in cnidarians, as in higher animals, distinct α integrin
types participate in binding to laminin and RGD-containing ligands, but functional analyses are required to verify
this hypothesis.
Despite having a common pattern of cysteine loss, phylogenetic analyses (Fig 5B) indicate that AmItgβ2 is only distantly related to the vertebrate β4-type. Those cysteine
residues (positions 8 and 9) in the consensus absent from
the Acropora and Podocoryne sequences form the c8–c9
loop of the β A domain, which has been implicated in
determining integrin-ligand specificity, specificity of α-β
interactions, and signalling properties [24-28]. Whilst this
loss has apparently occurred independently of that leading to the vertebrate β4 type, it may result in common
consequences for ligand and/or α-subunit specificity.

Comparison of AmItgα1, AmItgβ1 and AmItgβ2
mRNA distribution patterns during gastrulation in
Acropora. At the prawn chip stage, the AmItgα1 and
AmItgβ1 mRNAs are clearly restricted to one side of the
flattened cell bilayer (A, A', D). During gastrulation, these
mRNAs are tightly restricted to the area of the blastopore
(asterisks) lip (B, B', C, C', E, F), and throughout development
remain endodermal. The distribution of AmItgβ2 mRNA (G,
H, I) is broadly similar to that of AmItgα1, but is less tightly
restricted, as indicated by weak general staining. Arrow
heads in A, B, and C indicate the plane of the sections shown
as A', B' and C'.

here for Acropora have precedents in Podocoryne [11] as
well as in higher animals. Co-localization of mRNAs for
AmItgβ1, AmItgβ2 and AmItgα1 suggests that either or
both of the β subunits associate with the α1 subunit.
There are many precedents from bilaterians for RGD-type
αs associating with β1-type βs (α5β1; αVβ1; α8β1;
PS2βPS). Of these, α5β1 and PS2βPS have been implicated as regulators of gastrulation in vertebrates [29,30]
and Drosophila [31] respectively. In Podocoryne, IntA is
assumed to associate with IntB (a possible AmItgβ2
ortholog) since they are co-expressed in a wide variety of
locations over a range of life cycle stages [11], suggesting
that AmItgβ2 may associate with the AmItgα1 subunit.
Although integrins clearly play important roles in gastrulation in several animal groups, including vertebrates
[29], Drosophila [31], and sea urchins [32], the interactions that have been demonstrated are heterogeneous

with respect to both the ligands and types of integrins
involved. The expression patterns of α and β integrin
genes observed in the coral are reminiscent of expression
during both amphibian and sea urchin gastrulation. Modulation of integrin adhesion to the RGD domain of
fibronectin plays a central role during Xenopus gastrulation [33], and in the sea urchin Lytechinus changes in laminin adhesion mediated by the epithelial α integrin α SU2
are likewise important [34]. In both the sea urchin and
Xenopus, changes in integrin-mediated cell adhesion during gastrulation occur independently of transcription and
translation. In Acropora, integrin mRNAs are present in
eggs [23] and the extent to which those visualized in the
presumptive endoderm reflect zygotic transcription is
unknown.
The simplest interpretation of the patterns of integrin
expression is that they reflect increases in cell adhesion in
the presumptive endoderm. Expression on the concave
side of the "fat prawn chip" stage embryo, which is essentially a flat bilayer of cells (for a description of gastrulation
in Acropora, see [14]), suggests that integrin-based adhesion may constrain the presumptive endoderm whilst the
cells of the presumptive ectoderm move upward and
inward around them. Whilst the cells that will end up
inside the embryo may adhere to each other more tightly
than they do to the putative ectoderm, as is consistent
with many forms of gastrulation, the inferred increased
adhesion in the putative endoderm is not consistent with
a typical epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
The early expression patterns of the α and β integrins in
Acropora are very similar to those of two transcription factors, snailA [15] and otxB [35]. Snail genes have central
and conserved roles in gastrulation in Drosophila [36] and
vertebrates [37] and members of the broader class of
related genes are regulators of other epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). Whilst the best understood
means by which snail genes regulate cell adhesion is by
acting as repressors of E-cadherin expression [36,38,39],
in human epidermal keratinocytes the snail-related gene
Slug (Snail2) is a repressor of α3, β1 and β4 integrin
expression, leading to decreased cell-adhesion to
fibronectin and laminin 5 [40]. Across the Bilateria, Otx
genes are conserved anterior markers [41] and, whilst
most Otx genes are expressed in the nervous system, evidence from a diverse range of metazoans suggests an
ancient role as regulators of cell adhesion (eg. [42,43]). In
Hydra, high levels of CnOtx expression correspond to
regions where cells are undergoing rearrangements or
movement [44]. Both snailA and otxB are thus candidate
regulators of integrin expression in Acropora. Given the
similarity of AmItgα1 to diverged RGD-type mammalian
integrins, it will be of particular interest to examine the
expression of ECM proteins containing fibronectin type

III domains during cnidarian gastrulation in parallel with
adhesion studies. Candidates identified in Nematostella
include predicted proteins similar to vertebrate usherin
and titin, and a likely homolog of Drosophila sidekick.

Conclusion
Whilst one might expect morphologically simple metazoans to have a correspondingly basic integrin complement,
comprising perhaps just two αs and a single β subunit (as
in Caenorhabditis elegans), the repertoire of these molecules in anthozoan cnidarians is considerably more complex. In the case of cnidarian α integrins, ligand specificity
cannot be predicted by phylogenetic analysis, suggesting
the possibility that specificity mechanisms arose independently in Cnidaria and Bilateria. During early development in Acropora, some of these adhesion/signalling
molecules are expressed in patterns which parallel those
of their amphibian and echinoderm counterparts, and
which are inconsistent with gastrulation being a simple
epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Methods
Sample collection and RNA extraction
Developmentally staged Acropora millepora embryos were
collected during annual spawning events. Embryos were
staged based on Ball et al. (2002). Total RNA was
extracted using RNAWIZ (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RT-PCR analysis
RNA was treated with DNase (Fermentas) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Single stranded cDNA was synthesised using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) using 1 μg of
total RNA. One μl of this product was used as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) template. For AmItgα1, primers
AmItga1RTF (5'-GCCAATGAAACAGCTACG-3') and
AmItga1RTR (5'-TTGTCTCCAGCCTTCAAC-3') were used
to amplify a 130 bp product. For AmItgβ2, primers
AmItgb2RTF (5'-TGGGCATTTGTGGTGTGAG-3') and
AmItgb2RTR (5'-GCTTGTTCTGATGAGTGATGG-3') were
used to amplify a 219 bp product. For AmItgβ1 (Brower et
al. 1997), primers IB1RTF (5'-CTTGTGTTGCCACTTATGGCTT-3') and IB1RTR (5'-CTGCTACTTGCATTAACGCATC-3') were used to amplify a 144 bp product. The PCR
protocol was 1 min at 94°C, then 40 cycles of 0.5 min at
94°C (denaturation), 0.5 min at 50°C (annealing), 2 min
at 72°C (extension), followed by an additional extension
for 2 min at 72°C.) As a control, primers ADH-F (5'AAGAAGACAAACATCAAGCCTCA-3') and ADH-R (5'CACATCCAAGGTTCACAAGACG-3') were used to
amplify a portion of coral AdoHcyase (S-adenosyl-Lhomocysteine hydrolase) cDNA (unpublished data).
