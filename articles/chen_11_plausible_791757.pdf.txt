The plausible reason why the length of 5’
untranslated region is unrelated to organismal
complexity

Abstract
Background: Organismal complexity is suggested to increase with the complexity of transcriptional and
translational regulations. Supporting this notion is a recent study that demonstrated a higher level of tissue-specific
gene expression in human than in mouse. However, whether this correlation can be extended beyond mammals
remains unclear. In addition, 5’ untranslated regions (5’UTRs), which have undergone stochastic elongation during
evolution and potentially included an increased number of regulatory elements, may have played an important
role in the emergence of organismal complexity. Although the lack of correlation between 5’UTR length and
organismal complexity has been proposed, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored.
Results: In this study, we select the number of cell types as the measurement of organismal complexity and
examine the correlation between (1) organismal complexity and transcriptional regulatory complexity; and (2)
organismal complexity and 5’UTR length by comparing the 5’UTRs and multiple-tissue expression profiles of human
(Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The transcriptional regulatory
complexity is measured by using the tissue specificity of gene expression and the ratio of non-constitutively
expressed to constitutively expressed genes. We demonstrate that, whereas correlation (1) holds well in the threeway comparison, correlation (2) is not true. Results from a larger dataset that includes more than 15 species,
ranging from yeast to human, also reject correlation (2). The reason for the failure of correlation (2) may be
ascribed to: Firstly, longer 5’UTRs do not contribute to increased tissue specificity of gene expression. Secondly, the
increased numbers of common translational regulatory elements in longer 5’UTRs do not lead to increased
organismal complexity.
Conclusions: Our study has extended the evidence base for the correlation between organismal complexity and
transcriptional regulatory complexity from mammals to fruit fly, the representative model organism of invertebrates.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the elongation of 5’UTRs alone can not lead to the increase in regulatory
complexity or the emergence of organismal complexity.

Background
The evolution of organismal complexity is a fundamental issue in biological sciences. A number of hypotheses
have been proposed to explain the emergence of organismal complexity, including increases in gene/protein
number [1-3], gains of noncoding regulatory elements
[1,2,4,5], and expansions of biological networks [2,6]. A

previous study provides evidence that human (a more
complex organism) has an increased proportion of genes
that are narrowly expressed (indicating increased transcriptional regulatory complexity) than mouse (a less
complex organism) [7]. However, the study only compares human and mouse due to data limitations. The
close relationship between the two mammalian species
has restricted the applicability of the study to a small
evolutionary scope. For example, we are not sure
whether the suggested correlation between transcriptional regulatory complexity and organismal complexity
can be extended to other vertebrates (e.g. birds or

fishes) or invertebrate species. Furthermore, the source
of the increased regulatory complexity in complex
organisms has not been fully explained, although the
elongation of 5’ untranslated regions (5’UTRs) has been
alluded to [7]. Since 5’UTRs are associated with both
transcriptional and translational cis-regulations [8-10],
the elongation of these non-coding regions may have
contributed to increased regulatory complexity [7]. A
recent analysis suggested that the length of 5’UTR was
unrelated to organismal complexity [11]. However, the
analysis did not discuss possible reasons for the lack of
correlation. Furthermore, this analysis did not take into
consideration the phylogenetic relationships among the
compared species (see the discussion below about independent contrast). Therefore, we are interested in reconfirming the lack of correlation between 5’UTR length
and organismal complexity and examining the potential
underlying molecular mechanisms. To this end, we analyzed the 5’UTR lengths of more than 15 species ranging
from yeast to human. Furthermore, to examine the relationship between transcriptional regulatory complexity
and 5’UTR length, we analyzed the gene expression data
of human, mouse, and fruit fly, for which multiple-tissue
gene expression data are available.
Notably, there have been some discussions over how
organismal complexity should be measured [12]. However, most of the proposed methods cannot be applied
to our study because unbiased quantification of these
measurements (e.g. functional complexity [13], number
of transcription factor families [14], or phenotypic complexity [15]) for all of the compared species is difficult.
Therefore, we selected the number of cell types, a generally acceptable index [16], as the measurement of
organismal complexity.
We also noted that closely related species might have
similar genetic features, levels of organismal complexity,
and 5’UTR lengths. Such similarities may lead to overweighting of some lineages and biased correlations
between biological features [17]. To reduce such biases,
we employed independent contrast to correct for the
compared genetic characteristics [17]. Independent contrast considers the phylogenetic distances between the
compared species and adjusts the weighting of the compared biological features according to the phylogenetic
tree of the compared species (see Methods).
Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework of this
study. Here we examined (A) the association between
organismal complexity and the complexity in transcriptional regulation (represented by the breadth or tissue
specificity of gene expression, logical connection (ii) in
Figure 1), which in turn is supposedly related to the
information contents (lengths) of 5’UTRs (logical connection (i)) if 5’UTR is an important contributor to
organismal complexity; and (B) the relationship between

Page 2 of 12

organismal complexity and the abundance of 5’UTRassociated translational regulatory elements (logical connections (iii) and (iv) in Figure 1). We also examined
connection (v) using several different datasets, including
experimentally supported ones, to avoid potential annotation errors or dataset-specific biases. In summary, logical connection (i) posits that longer 5’UTRs contribute
to higher transcriptional regulatory complexity (more
non-constitutively expressed genes or more tissue-specific gene expressions); connection (ii) states that higher
transcriptional regulatory complexity is related to
increased organismal complexity; connection (iii)
hypothesizes that longer 5’UTRs contain more translational regulatory elements (uAUGs and uORFs); connection (iv) links the increase in uAUGs and uORFs with
increased organismal complexity; and connection (v)
states that increased 5’UTR length contributes to
increased organismal complexity.
Our results indicate that 5’UTR length correlates with
neither organismal complexity nor breadth/tissue specificity of gene expression. In addition, the increased
numbers of common translational regulatory signals
(upstream start codons and upstream open reading
frames) in longer 5’UTRs do not contribute to increased
organismal complexity. In other words, we provide evidence that logical connections (i), (iv), and (v) are invalid. Therefore, we suggest that the elongation of 5’UTRs
alone cannot explain the emergence of organismal complexity, despite that transcriptional regulatory complexity indeed positively correlates with organismal
complexity (connection (ii)) from fruit fly to mammals.

Results
The increase in 5’UTR length is unrelated to the increase
in organismal complexity

To examine the correlation between organismal complexity and 5’UTR length, we first selected 11 vertebrates and 3 invertebrates that have well-annotated
5’UTR information from the Ensembl website (Table 1).
Yeast was also included to represent unicellular
eukaryotes.
As different alternatively spliced transcripts may have
different 5’UTR lengths, the selection of transcript isoforms may affect our results. Therefore, we used two
different criteria to select a representative transcript in
the case of alternative splicing: a randomly selected transcript or the transcript with a “pure” 5’UTR (see Methods). As shown in Figure 2, the independent contrast
analyses indicate that 5’UTR length has no significant
correlation with the number of cell types for either dataset (R 2 = 0.037, P = 0.494 for dataset (A), and R 2 =
0.009, P = 0.739 for dataset (B)).
Since the lengths of 5’UTRs may differ between different annotation systems, and plants are not included in

the above analysis, we used an independent dataset
(UTRdb, see Methods) and added two plant species to
again evaluate the correlation between 5’UTR length
and organismal complexity. Accordingly, the 5’UTRs of
a total of 17 species, including 9 vertebrates, 5 invertebrates, 2 plants, and yeast, were analyzed (Table 1). The
correlation between organismal complexity and 5’UTR
length is again statistically insignificant (R2 = 0.001, P =
0.884; Figure 2(C)).
To control for the factor of lineage-specific gains/
losses of genes, we extracted one-to-one orthologous
genes from 11 vertebrate species from the Ensembl
dataset and performed the analysis again. Note that we
included only vertebrate species to ensure a large
enough number of genes for the analysis. The correlation remains statistically insignificant (Additional file 1),
suggesting that lineage-specific gene gains/losses do not
affect our result. Therefore, connection (v) in Figure 1 is
not supported by this multiple-species comparison.

One potential caveat in the above analyses is that the
lengths of 5’UTRs may be subject to annotation errors,
particularly for less extensively studied species. To tackle
this problem, we compared the lengths of 5’UTRs of the
one-to-one orthologous genes of three intensively studied species, namely human, mouse, and fruit fly with
reference to three different databases: Ensembl, UTRdb,
and RefSeq-CAGE (RefSeq transcripts with the 5’cap
annotation supported by CAGE data [18-20]) (Figure 3;
Methods). For the UTRdb and RefSeq-CAGE datasets, a
randomly selected transcript for each gene was analyzed,
whereas for the Ensembl dataset, randomly selected and
pure-5’UTR transcripts were separately analyzed. As is
commonly recognized, the numbers of cell types (Table
1) indicate that human is the most complex organism
among the three, followed by mouse, and finally by fruit
fly. The 5’UTR lengths of the three organisms are
expected to follow the same order if organismal complexity is indeed associated with 5’UTR length.

Unexpectedly, however, fruit fly actually has longer
5’UTRs than mouse in all of the analyzed datasets (All P
values < 1.3E-20 by the Mann-Whitney U test; Figure
3). In the RefSeq-CAGE dataset, fruit fly has the longest
5’UTRs (P < 4.9E-9 in both human-fly and mouse-fly
comparisons; Figure 3(D)) despite its lowest organismal
complexity. Meanwhile, in the other three datasets, the
differences in 5’UTR length between human and fruit fly
are all statistically insignificant (Figure 3 (A)~3(C)).
These observations suggest that the increase in organismal complexity is not directly related to the elongation
of 5’UTR. Therefore, connection (v) in Figure 1 is again
not supported by the high-quality data.
The length of 5’UTR cannot fully explain the breadth or
tissue specificity of gene expression

We have shown that organismal complexity does not
increase with increasing length of 5’UTR. We then
examine possible reasons for the lack of correlation by
investigating logical connections (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) in
Figure 1 using the biological features of the three intensively studied species, for multiple-tissue (>10 tissues)
gene expression data are available only for these species.

We first analyzed the relationship between 5’UTR length
and the breadth/tissue specificity of gene expression.
Vinogradov and Anatskaya [7] showed that human had
a higher fraction of non-constitutively expressed genes
than mouse, which was suggested to result from
human’s longer 5’UTRs (logical connections (i) and (ii)
in Figure 1). In this vein, organisms with longer 5’UTRs
are expected to have a larger proportion of narrowly
expressed genes (higher tissue specificity) because the
supposedly larger numbers of regulatory elements in
longer 5’UTRs allow subtle transcriptional regulations,
which should in turn lead to increased organismal
complexity.
To examine the validity of these logical connections,
we compared the expression patterns of one-to-one
orthologous gene among the three species for all the
available tissues (Methods [21,22]). Notably, there are
two technical issues in this comparison. First, the numbers of experimentally examined tissues are much larger
for mammals (79 for human and 61 for mouse) than for
fruit fly (17 tissues). This may lead to a larger proportion of “constitutively expressed genes” in fruit fly than
in mammals because, intuitively, a gene is more likely to

be expressed in 17 tissues than in 61 (or 79) tissues.
Second, it is infeasible to compare “homologous” tissues
between mammals and fruit fly. To address these issues,
we randomly sampled 10 non-redundant tissues from
each of the species 1,000 times, and analyzed the
expression profiles in the sampled tissues (Methods).
The rationale of this analysis is that the gene expression
patterns in complex organisms should be more variable
than in relatively simple organisms. In other words,
given the same numbers of tissues, more complex

organisms should have fewer genes that are expressed in
all of the examined tissues, and demonstrate higher
levels of tissue specificity of gene expression. We then
took three measurements for the analyzed genes in the
sampled tissues: (a) the 5’UTR length; (b) the ratio of
“non-constitutively expressed genes” to “constitutively
expressed” genes (Methods); and (c) the mean of tissue
specificity of gene expression (the “τ” statistic [23]).
With the above data, we were able to examine and
potentially extend from mammals to fruit fly the notion

Also note that the numbers of cell types are 169, 159, and 64, respectively, for human, mouse, and fruit fly [16].

that more complex organisms have a larger proportion
of narrowly expressed genes [7]. According to this
hypothesis, human is expected to have the largest fraction of non-constitutively expressed genes, followed by
mouse, and lastly by fruit fly, which is in fact supported
by our result (Figure 4). The tissue specificity of gene
expression of the three species also shows a similar
trend (Figure 5). Note that we also re-sampled 17 tissues
from the human and mouse data 1,000 times and

compare the distributions with the median values of the
fruit fly data. The results remain the same (Additional
files 2 and 3). Therefore, our results indicate that logical
connection (ii) in Figure 1 is applicable to such a wide
range as from fruit fly to mammals.
We then examined logical connection (i). If the elongation of 5’UTR actually contributes to the increase in
transcriptional regulatory complexity, it is expected that
human has the longest 5’UTRs and fruit fly has the

expressed genes). This inference is based on the observation that these “expressed genes” exhibit highest tissue
specificity in human and lowest specificity in fruit fly
(Figures 4 and 5). However, this expected result is not
observed. Among the examined genes, fruit fly in fact
has significantly longer 5’UTRs than mouse (Figure 6).
A potential caveat in this analysis is that the fruit fly

different groups at different times. In addition, the cutoff thresholds of “expressed genes” are different between
mammals and fruit fly (Methods). The longer 5’UTRs in
fly than in mouse thus may result from data bias. However, a similar trend is actually observed in the allortholog comparison (Figure 3). Therefore, our results
may have reflected the biological truth, arguing against
logical connection (i). In other words, organisms with
longer 5’UTRs do not necessarily have more non-constitutively expressed genes.

Increasing numbers of upstream start codons and
upstream open reading frames do not contribute to
increase in organismal complexity

Next, we examine the relationship between organismal
complexity and the numbers of translational regulatory
motifs in 5’UTRs (logical connections (iii) and (iv) in Figure 1). Here we use two common motifs, namely
upstream start codons (uAUGs) and upstream open
reading frames (uORFs), to represent the translational
regulatory elements in 5’UTRs. This is reasonable
because these elements occur frequently in 5’UTRs and
can significantly down-regulate the translation of the

main coding regions [24]. Furthermore, for the same species, the numbers of uAUGs and uORFs are positively
correlated with the lengths of 5’UTRs [25,26]. We can
examine whether this is also true between different species. To this end, we used the 15-species Ensembl datasets to examine the correlation between 5’UTR length
and the number of uAUG/uORF. In fact, the numbers of
uAUGs and uORFs are both positively correlated with
the lengths of 5’UTRs, with only one exception (the number of uAUGs VS. 5’UTR length for randomly selected
transcripts; Additional file 4). Therefore, the general
trend is that organisms with longer 5’UTRs tend to have
more translational regulatory elements, which supports
logical connection (iii) in Figure 1.
We also use the Ensembl datasets to examine whether
the numbers of uAUG/uORF correlate with organismal
complexity. The independent contrast analyses indicate
that the number of neither of the two types of regulatory elements per gene significantly correlates with organismal complexity (P ≧ 0.340; Additional file 5).
Therefore, logic connection (iv) is not supported.
In sum, we provide evidence against two important
assumptions (connections (i) and (iv) in Figure 1) in the
5’UTR length-organismal complexity hypothesis. The
failure of these assumptions leads to falsification of the
hypothesis itself (connection (v)). Therefore, we suggest
that the elongation of 5’UTR is not the major contributor of the increased organismal complexity.

Discussion
We have demonstrated that the elongation of 5’UTR is
not directly related to the increase in organismal complexity among human, mouse, and fruit fly (and also in
several larger datasets). The possible reason for the lack
of correlation is twofold. First, at the transcription level,
5’UTR length is not correlated with breadth/tissue specificity of gene expression. Second, at the translation level,
the larger numbers of common translational regulatory
elements in longer 5’UTRs do not lead to increased
organismal complexity.
However, we emphasize that our results support the
correlation between organismal complexity and the
complexity in gene regulations [7]. It is well established
that transcriptional/translational regulations involve a
wide variety of trans- and cis- factors. 5’UTRs represent
only part of the cis-factors. We cannot rule out the possibility that organismal complexity is associated with the
interactions between 5’UTRs and other regulatory factors, thus blurring the correlation between 5’UTR length
and organismal complexity. Furthermore, 5’UTRs may
contain so far uncharacterized transcriptional/translational regulatory elements, which alone or in combination with other regulatory elements may contribute to
organismal complexity.

The apparent lack of correlation between 5’UTR
length and organismal complexity is unexpected, for the
elongation of 5’UTRs and the emergence of organismal
complexity were suggested to result from the same evolutionary process [27,28]. It has been proposed that the
decrease in population size and the consequent reduction of selective constraint on genome evolution led to
the accumulation of regulatory elements and the emergence of organismal complexity [29]. Therefore, it
appears reasonable to assume an association between
organismal complexity and 5’UTR length. However, as
we discussed earlier, 5’UTR is not the only regulatory
element in the genome. For example, non-coding RNAmediated gene regulations [30-32], nonsense-mediated
decay [33], the lengths and interactions of protein coding sequences [34], and 3’UTRs may all contribute to
regulatory complexity [11]. To be sure, 5’UTRs represent only part of the complicated machinery of eukaryotic gene regulations. The proportion that 5’UTRs
contribute to the variations in transcriptional/translational regulations remains unknown. And such proportions are also likely to vary with biological conditions. It
is intriguing to study whether the collective length of all
regulatory elements correlates significantly with organismal complexity. A potential approach is to integrate
these features into a multiple regression model and analyze the contributions of each characteristic to the variations in organismal complexity.

Conclusions
Our study has extended the evidence base for the association between organismal complexity and transcriptional regulatory complexity from mammals to fruit fly.
We also show that increased organismal complexity
does not result directly from the elongation of 5’UTRs
because longer 5’UTRs do not contribute to higher regulatory complexity. Therefore, despite the proposed
common evolutionary origin of these two biological phenomena, one single type of regulatory sequence (5’UTR)
may not account for such a multi-faceted feature as
organismal complexity.
Methods
Data sources

We used two primary data sources for well-annotated
5’UTR information: Ensemble (version 56) and UTRdb
(http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/; updated in July 2010) [35].
For the Ensembl dataset, 11 vertebrate and 3 invertebrate species were selected (Table 1). The sequences of
5’UTRs and gene annotations (Ensembl version 56) were
retrieved by using BioMart [36]. For the UTRdb dataset,
10 vertebrate, 4 invertebrate, and 2 plant species were
selected (Table 1). The 5’UTR sequences of yeast

Page 9 of 12

(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were retrieved from a recent
publication [37] and added to both datasets for subsequent analyses. Note that the Ensembl dataset was
applied in all of the analyses of this study, whereas the
UTRdb dataset was used to examine logical connection
(v) only.
Furthermore, we selected the most extensively studied
species, namely human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus
musculus), and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) for
analyses. The high study intensities for these species
have considerably reduced the probability of annotation
errors as compared with the other analyzed species. In
addition, the large-scale gene expression data available
for these three species enable us to analyze the correlation between 5’UTR length and gene expression patterns, which would be impossible for the other species.
In addition to Ensemble and UTRdb data, a RefSeqCAGE dataset was also employed. For this last dataset,
only the RefSeq-annotated transcription start sites that
were supported by the CAGE tag clusters [18-20] were
retained. Therefore, the lengths of 5’UTRs derived from
this dataset were considered as highly accurate. Chromosomal positions of tag clusters were downloaded
from the FANTOM website for human and mouse
[18,19] and from a recent genome-wide study for fruit
fly [20].
To further enhance the quality of the data, several criteria were applied to filter the retrieved transcripts: the
transcripts to be analyzed must (a) have an annotated
5’UTR; (b) be a known transcript (rather than a novel
or predicted transcript); and (c) have a known protein
product. The last two conditions were employed to
ensure that the 5’ and 3’ termini of the analyzed 5’UTRs
were experimentally supported. In the case of alternative
splicing, we used two different criteria to select one
transcript for each gene for the Ensembl dataset (Table
1): (A) a randomly selected transcript; or (B) the transcript with a “pure 5’UTR” (i.e. a 5’UTR that does not
overlap with the coding sequences in any other transcripts). In the latter case, we further filtered out the
pure 5’UTRs that matched any of the entries in the
non-redundant (NR) protein database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.
gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) by using blastx [38] with the
default parameters (E-value < 10 -5 ). Analyses of both
datasets yield consistent results. For the UTRdb dataset,
we randomly selected one transcript for each gene with
alternatively spliced isoforms.
For the measurement of organismal complexity, we
used the number of cell types because this indicator has
been shown to be highly correlated with organismal
complexity [39]. The numbers of cell types of the compared species (Table 1) were retrieved from Vogal and
Chothia’s study [16].

Evaluating the correlation between organismal
complexity and genetic features

The genetic characteristics of closely related species may
not evolve independently, which may lead to biased correlations between genetic features [17]. To eliminate
such biases, we employed the “CONTRAST” module of
PHYLIP [17] to derive the contrasts of the measured
biological features (5’UTR lengths, the numbers of
translational regulatory elements, and the numbers of
cell types) with reference to the phylogenetic tree of the
compared organisms. The process is summarized as follows. First, the phylogenetic tree was constructed based
on the protein sequences of one-to-one orthologous
genes of the compared species. Second, unweighted contrasts of the biological characteristics (e.g. 5’UTR length)
were calculated for the internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. Third, weighted contrasts were calculated
according to the genetic distances between the nodes of
the tree.
The Spearman’s correlations of a zero-intercept linear
regression model were then evaluated for the derived
contrasts of biological characteristics by using the R
program (http://www.r-project.org). The reason for
using the zero-intercept regression is that no changes in
one biological characteristic are expected if the other
characteristic does not change (e.g. no changes in organismal complexity are expected if the lengths of 5’UTRs
do not change). Notably, the overall results hold well
even if we use the regular Spearman’s correlation.
Measurements of gene expression breadth and tissue
specificity

Gene expression data of human and mouse were
retrieved from the BioGPS website (http://biogps.gnf.
org/downloads/). The datasets covered 79 human and
61 mouse tissues, where the levels of gene expression
were measured using the Affymetrix microarray chips
(U133A/GNF1H for human and GNF1M for mouse)
[21]. To determine the probe-gene associations, we
blastn-aligned [38] the probe sequences against the
complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of known
human and mouse protein coding genes retrieved from
Ensembl version 56. Only the probes that could be completely matched to a cDNA with 100% identity were
retained. The probes that matched more than one gene
were excluded. In the cases where multiple probes
matched the same gene, we retained the probe that had
the highest sum of expression levels in all tissues.
Accordingly, 15,834 human and 15,627 mouse genes
were identified and subsequently analyzed. The gene
expression data of adult fruit fly were retrieved from the
FlyAtlas (http://flyatlas.org/drosophila_2.na23.annot.csv),
which covered 17 tissues that were examined using the

Page 10 of 12

Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array [22]. The
probe-gene associations were determined as described
above. Accordingly, 12,095 of the fruit fly genes were
included in the subsequent analyses.
Note that the numbers of examined tissues differ
remarkably between the mammalian species and fruit
fly. To fairly reflect the differences in expression patterns among human, mouse, and fruit fly, we randomly
sampled 10 non-redundant tissues from each of species
(or 17 tissues from human and mouse) 1,000 times, and
analyzed the expression profiles in the sampled tissues.
A mammalian gene was considered as expressed in a
given tissue if its average difference (AD) value was larger than 200 [21]. In the case of fruit fly, a gene was
regarded as expressed if it had at least 3 present calls
out of 4 biological replicates [40]. The genes that were
not expressed in any of the 10 (or 17) sampled tissues
were excluded. We then took three measurements for
the analyzed genes in the sampled tissues: (a) the median 5’UTR lengths; (b) the ratio of “non-constitutively
expressed genes” (defined as genes that were not
expressed in all of the 10 (or 17) sampled tissues) to
“constitutively expressed” genes (genes that were
expressed in all of the 10 or 17 sampled tissues); and (c)
the average tissue specificity of gene expression. Tissue
specificity of gene expression was measured by the modified τ statistic [23], which considered both expression
breadth and expression level of a gene. The τ value falls
between 0 and 1. A larger τ value indicates higher tissue
specificity of gene expression.
Identification of translational regulatory elements in
5’UTRs

Identification of all of the translational regulatory elements in 5’UTRs is infeasible due to our limited understanding of these elements. Instead, we calculated the
numbers of two common regulatory elements that have
been proved able to significantly alter the levels of protein translation: upstream start codons (uAUGs) [41]
and upstream open reading frames (uORFs) [24]. The
uAUGs in 5’UTRs were scanned from the 5’ cap to the
3’ end in three different reading frames. A uORF was
defined as a putative open reading frame that started at
a uAUG and terminated at a stop codon within a
5’UTR. A uORF must be at least 9 nucleotides long,
including a uAUG, a stop codon, and at least one codon
in-between. To avoid redundancy in the calculation of
uORF numbers, only the first uAUG triplet was used as
the start of a uORF when multiple in-frame uAUGs
were present.
This study applies only bioinformatics analyses on
data from the public domain. Therefore, no ethical
approval or consent for data usage is required.
