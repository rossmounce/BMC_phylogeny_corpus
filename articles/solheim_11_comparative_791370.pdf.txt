Abstract
Background: Enterococci rank among the leading causes of nosocomial infections. The failure to identify
pathogen-specific genes in Enterococcus faecalis has led to a hypothesis where the virulence of different strains
may be linked to strain-specific genes, and where the combined endeavor of the different gene-sets result in the
ability to cause infection. Population structure studies by multilocus sequence typing have defined distinct clonal
complexes (CC) of E. faecalis enriched in hospitalized patients (CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40).
Results: In the present study, we have used a comparative genomic approach to investigate gene content in 63
E. faecalis strains, with a special focus on CC2. Statistical analysis using Fisher’s exact test revealed 252 significantly
enriched genes among CC2-strains. The majority of these genes were located within the previously defined mobile
elements phage03 (n = 51), efaB5 (n = 34) and a vanB associated genomic island (n = 55). Moreover, a CC2enriched genomic islet (EF3217 to -27), encoding a putative phage related element within the V583 genome, was
identified. From the draft genomes of CC2-strains HH22 and TX0104, we also identified a CC2-enriched non-V583
locus associated with the E. faecalis pathogenicity island (PAI). Interestingly, surface related structures (including
MSCRAMMs, internalin-like and WxL protein-coding genes) implicated in virulence were significantly
overrepresented (9.1%; p = 0.036, Fisher’s exact test) among the CC2-enriched genes.
Conclusion: In conclusion, we have identified a set of genes with potential roles in adaptation or persistence in
the hospital environment, and that might contribute to the ability of CC2 E. faecalis isolates to cause disease.

Background
For many years, Enterococcus faecalis was considered as an
intestinal commensal, which only sporadically caused
opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.
During the last thirty years, however, E. faecalis has gained
notoriety as one of the primary causative agents of nosocomial infections [1,2], including urinary tract infections,
endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections and bacteremia.
The ability of E. faecalis to cause infection has been

connected to inherent enterococcal traits, enabling the
bacterium to tolerate diverse and harsh growth conditions.
Moreover, several putative enterococcal virulence factors
have been characterized (reviewed in [3]), and the role of
these virulence factors in pathogenicity have been further
established in various animal infection models [4-8] and
cultured cell lines [9,10]. Reportedly, several of the proposed virulence determinants are enriched among infection-derived E. faecalis and/or E. faecium isolates,
including esp (enterococcal surface protein) [11], hyl (hyaluronidase) [12], genes encoding collagen binding adhesins
[13,14] and other matrix-binding proteins [15], and pilin
loci [16,17]. On the other hand, recent studies on enterococcal pathogenicity have shown that a number of the

putative virulence traits are present not only in infectious
isolates but also in animal and environmental isolates
[18-23]. This widespread distribution of putative virulence
determinants in enterococcal isolates strongly suggest that
enterococcal pathogenicity is not a result of any single
virulence factor, but rather a more intricate process.
Indeed, the virulence potential of the newly sequenced
laboratory strain E. faecalis OG1RF was, despite its lack of
several factors, comparable to that of the clinical isolate
E. faecalis V583 [24]. Bourgogne et al. [24] proposed a scenario where the virulence of V583 and OG1RF may be
linked to genes that are unique to each of the two strains,
but where the combined endeavor of the different genesets result in the ability to cause infection.
Population structure studies of E. faecalis by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) have previously defined
distinct clonal complexes (CC) of E. faecalis enriched in
hospitalized patients (CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40),
designated high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes
(HiRECCs) [25,26]. In one of our previous studies, we
reported an overall correlation between MLST and
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of gene content as
revealed by microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) [27]. This observation led us to
speculate whether the virulence of different HiRECCs
may be due to lineage-specific gene sets. In the present
study we have used the comparative genomics approach
to further investigate variation in gene content within
E. faecalis, with a special focus on CC2. This complex
was chosen on the basis of previous Bayesian-based phylogenetic reconstruction [27]. CC2 is equivalent to the
previously designated BVE complex, and comprises several clinically important E. faecalis isolates, including
the first known beta-lactamase producing isolate HH22,
the first U.S. vancomycin-resistant isolate V583, and
pathogenicity island (PAI)-harboring clinical bacteremia
isolate MMH594 [26,28,29]. This CC represents a globally dispersed hospital-associated lineage, and identification of CC2-enriched genes may unravel novel fitness
factors implicated in survival and spread of E. faecalis
clones in the hospital environment.

Results and discussion
Overall genomic diversity

To explore the genetic diversity among E. faecalis, BLAST
comparison was performed with 24 publicly available
sequenced draft genomes, including the two CC2-strains
TX0104 (ST2), which is an endocarditis isolate, and HH22
(ST6; mentioned above) against the genome of strain
V583, which is also a ST6 isolate. The number of V583
genes predicted to be present varied between 2385
(OG1RF) and 2831 (HH22) for the 24 strains (Additional
file 1). In addition, we used CGH to investigate variation
in gene content within 15 E. faecalis isolated in European

hospital environments, with a special focus on a hospitaladapted subpopulation identified by MLST (CC2). Of the
3219 V583 genes represented on the array, the number of
V583 orthologous genes classified as present ranged from
2359 (597/96) to 2883 (E4250). Analysis of the compiled
data set (in silico and CGH), revealed a total of 1667 genes
present in all strains, thus representing the E. faecalis core
genome. None of the annotated V583 genes were found to
be divergent in all the isolates analyzed.
Putative CC2-enriched elements

In a previous study, we identified a set of potential
pathogen-specific genes, which were entirely divergent
in a collection of commensal baby isolates [27]. None of
these genes were found to be present in all hospitalrelated isolates analyzed in the present study, neither
was any gene found to be unique to any HiRECC. In
order to identify genes specifically enriched among
strains belonging to CC2, data from the present study
were supplemented with hybridization data from an
additional 24 strains of various origins ([27,30] and
M. Solheim, unpublished data). The additional data sets
were obtained by hybridization to the same array as
described above. All together, data from a total of 63
strains were analyzed, in addition to V583 (Table 1).
A genome-atlas presentation of the gene content in all
the strains analyzed by CGH compared to the V583
genome is shown in Figure 1.
By Fisher’s exact testing (q < 0.01), 252 genes were
found to be more prevalent among CC2-strains than in
non-CC2-strains (Additional file 2). The CC2-enriched
genes included large parts of phage03 (p03; n = 51),
efaB5 (n = 34) and a phage-related region identified by
McBride et al. [31](EF2240-82/EF2335-51; n = 55), supporting the notion that the p03 genetic element may
confer increased fitness in the hospital environment
[27]. Indeed, prophage-related genes constituted a predominant proportion of the CC2-enriched genes (55.5%;
p < 2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, the
Tn916-like efaB5 element has previously also been suggested to play a role in niche adaptation (Leavis, Willems et al. unpublished data): CGH analysis identified an
efaB5-orthologous element in E. faecium that appeared
to be common for HiRECC E. faecalis and CC17 E. faecium, a hospital-adapted subpopulation identified by
MLST. To further confirm the presence of the relevant
MGEs in E. faecalis, we used PCR combining internal
primers with primers targeting the genes flanking p03,
efaB5 and the vanB-associated phage-related element in
V583, to monitor conserved V583 junctions on either
side of the elements in 44 strains (Table 1). Seven
strains contained the junctions on both sides of p03, of
which six strains were CC2-strains. Eleven strains were
positive for the junctions on both sides of efaB5,

including nine CC2-strains, while thirteen strains gave
positive PCR for both junctions of the phage-related element surrounding vanB, of which eleven strains
belonged to CC2 (Additional file 3). These results substantiate the theory of p03, efaB5 and the vanB-associated phage as CC2-enriched elements.
A total of 178 of the 252 putative CC2-enriched genes
identified here, were associated with previously defined
MGEs identified in V583 [32]. In addition to p03, efaB5
and the vanB-surrounding phage element, these
included p01 (n = 5), PAI (n = 7), p04 (n = 21), p06 (n
= 1) and pTEF1 and pTEF2 (n = 5) (Additional file 2).
In addition, a ten-gene cluster (EF3217 to -27) with significant GC skew compared to the genome-average
(31.6 and 37.4%, respectively), was found to be significantly more frequent in strains belonging to CC2 than
in non-CC2 strains. The deviation in GC content suggests that this genetic element may also be of foreign
origin. This notion was further supported by the
sequence similarities of several of the genes with known
phage-related transcriptional regulators (EF3221, EF3223
and EF3227). Moreover, EF3221 to -22 showed high
degree of identity (>85%) to EfmE980_2492 to -93 of
the newly sequenced Enterococcus faecium E980 [33].
EfmE980_2492 holds a domain characteristic of the
aspartate aminotransferase superfamily of pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent enzymes. Interestingly, EF3217
encodes a putative helicase, while EF3218 encodes a
putative MutT protein, both with implications in DNA

repair [34,35]. A potential role of these genes in protection against oxidative DNA damage induced in the hospital environment and during infection is plausible. To
further investigate the distribution of EF3217 to -27 in
E. faecalis, 44 strains were screened by PCR (Additional
file 3): 10 CC2-strains held all ten genes, while 19
strains including two CC2-strains were devoid of the
entire element. Moreover, 2 strains contained EF3225
only, 3 strains contained EF3217 to -18, while 8 strains,
including OG1RF, contained EF3226 only. The two latter patterns of presence and divergence of EF3217 to
-27 were also obtained with BLASTN analysis of
TX0104 and OG1RF, respectively, corroborating that
these are indeed genuine polymorphisms in this locus.
Notably, in the OG1RF genome five more genes
(OG1RF_0214 to -18) are also located between the
homologs of EF3216 and EF3230 [24], suggesting this
locus may represent a hot spot for insertions. Partial
sequencing across the junction between EF3216 and
EF3230 suggested that several of the non-CC2 strains
carry genes homologous to OG1RF_0214 to -18 in this
locus (results not shown).
Mobile DNA constitutes a substantial fraction of the
E. faecalis V583 genome and transfer of MGEs and
transposons thus plays an important role in the evolution of E. faecalis genomes [32]. The large pool of
mobile elements also represents an abundant source of
pseudogenes, as indel events occurring within coding
regions often render genes nonfunctional. To verify the

expression of the CC2-enriched genes, we correlated the
list of enriched genes with data from two transcriptional
analyses performed in our laboratory with the same
array as used in the CGH experiment described in
present study ([30] and Solheim, unpublished work).
Transcription was confirmed for all but fifteen of the
CC2-enriched genes (results not shown), thus validating
the expression of these reading frames. The fifteen
genes, for which no transcripts were detected, were
mainly located within efaB5 and phage04.
A constraint of the comparative genomic analyses presented here, is that the comparison of gene content is
based on a single reference strain only (V583). To compensate, we conducted a CC2 pangenome analysis with
the draft genomes of CC2-strains HH22 and TX0104 to
identify putative CC2-enriched non-V583 genes. The
pangenome analysis identified a total of 298 non-V583
ORFs in the HH22 and TX0104 (Additional file 4).
Among these ORFs, one gene cluster was identified as
particularly interesting (Fisher’s exact; Additional file 4
and Figure 2). Notably, HMPREF0348_0426 in TX0104
represented the best BLAST hit for all the three ORFs
HMPREF0364_1864 to -66 in HH22, suggesting discrepancy in annotation between the two strains. Sequencing
across the gap between contig 00034 and contig 00035 in
TX0104 confirmed that HMPREF0348_0427 and
HMPREF0348_0428 represent the two respective ends of
a gene homologous to HMPREF0346_1863 in HH22.
(Additional file 5). The presence of the putative nonV583 CC2-enriched gene cluster among E. faecalis was
further elucidated by PCR in our collection of strains
(Additional file 3). Strains were screened for the presence
of three individual genes (HMPREF0346_1861,
HMPREF0346_1864 and HMPREF0346_1868) and the
entire element, with primers hmpref0346_1868-F and
hmpref0346_1861-R. Fisher’s exact testing (q < 0.01) on
the basis of the PCR data confirmed that the gene cluster
was significantly enriched among CC2. Comparative
sequence analysis of the flanking regions suggests that
the gene cluster is located in the HH22 and TX0104 versions of the E. faecalis pathogenicity island [36]. Recently,

Page 6 of 12

a microarray-based assessment of PAI-content in a set of
clinical E. faecalis isolates revealed high degree of variation within the island, and an evidently modular evolution of the PAI [37], which would be consistent with
acquisition by an indel event of this locus in the PAI of
TX0104, HH22 and other positive CC2-strains.
CC2-enriched surface-related structures

Lepage et al. [38] have previously identified eight genes
as potential markers for the V583/MMH594-lineage, of
which all except one gene (EF2513) are found among
the CC2-enriched genes in this study. Interestingly, several of these genes were later assigned to a recently classified family of surface proteins, with a C-terminal WxL
domain, proposed to form multi-component complexes
on the cell surface [39,40]. Siezen et al. [40] termed
these genes cell-surface complex (csc) genes and postulated a role in carbon source acquisition. Independently,
Brinster et al. [39] showed that WxL domains are
involved in peptidoglycan-binding. A total of nine WxL
protein-coding genes, divided into three clusters
(EF2248 to -54, EF3153 to -55 and EF3248 to -53), were
identified as putative CC2-enriched genes in the present
study. Note that EF3153 to - 55 does not represent a
complete csc gene cluster, as not all four csc gene
families (cscA - cscD) are present in the cluster [40].
Interestingly, the OG1RF genome sequence revealed
homologues loci encoding WxL-proteins corresponding
to the gene clusters EF3153 to -55 and EF3248 to -53 in
V583 (50-75% sequence identity) [24]. Such homologs
may possibly explain the divergence observed between
CC2 and non-CC2-strains in the present study. Indeed,
BLAST analysis with the OG1RF sequences against the
E. faecalis draft genomes suggested that the
OG1RF_0209-10 and OG1RF_0224-25 are widely distributed among non-CC2 E. faecalis. Given the putative
function in carbon metabolism, the observed sequence
variation may be related to substrate specificity.
In addition to the WxL domain, EF2250 also encodes
a domain characteristic for the internalin family
[39]. Internalins are characterized by the presence of

and TX0104 draft genomes (GenBank accession numbers ACIX00000000 and ACGL00000000, respectively). The EF-numbers of flanking
genes indicate the insert site location compared to the E. faecalis V583 pathogenicity island.

N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The best characterized bacterial LRR proteins are InlA and InlB from
Listeria monocytogenes, known to trigger internalization
by normally non-phagocytic cells [41]. Two internalinlike proteins were identified in E. faecalis V583 (EF2250
and elrA (EF2686)) [41,42]. Recently, Brinster et al. [42]
presented evidence of that ElrA play a role in E. faecalis
virulence, both in early intracellular survival in macrophages and by stimulating the host inflammatory
response through IL-6 induction. Moreover, by quantitative real-time PCR Shepard and Gilmore [43] found that
elrA was induced in E. faecalis MMH594 during exponential growth in serum and during both exponential
and stationary growth in urine. Contradictory data have,
however, been published for this and other strains using
different methods [42,44]. Although it is tempting to
speculate that EF2250 contributes to the interaction
with the mammalian host, the role of internalins in
E. faecalis pathogenesis is still not understood, and it
may therefore be premature to extrapolate function
solely on the basis of shared structural domains.
Glycosyl transferase family proteins are involved in the
formation of a number of cell surface structures such as
glycolipids, glycoproteins and polysaccharides [45].
E. faecalis is in possession of several capsular polysaccharides [46-48], with Cps and Epa being the best characterized. The epa (enterococcal polysaccharide antigen)
cluster represents a rhamnose-containing polysaccharide
which was originally identified in E. faecalis OG1RF [46].
The version of the epa cluster found in the V583 genome
contains an insertion of four genes (EF2185 to -88) compared to OG1RF. This insertion appeared to be enriched
among CC2. While EF 2185 and EF2187 encodes transposases of the IS256 family, the two remaining genes
showed 100% identity to the two respective ends of a
racemase domain protein in E. faecalis TX0104. Neighboring the epa cluster, two glycosyl transferases (EF2170
and EF2167) proposed as potential virulence factors [32],
are part of a three operon locus (EF2172 to -66), possibly
associated with lipopolysaccharide production. Five of
the genes within this locus were also found to be
enriched among CC2 in the present study.
Paulsen et al. [32] also listed other putative surfaceexposed virulence genes, including a choline-binding protein (CBP; EF2662) and a putative MSCRAMM (microbial
surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; EF2347) that based on our analysis were found to be
enriched in CC2. A role of CBPs in pneumococcal colonization and virulence has been established [49,50]. A number of putative MSCRAMMs have been identified in
E. faecalis [51], however, only Ace (adhesion of collagen
from E. faecalis; EF1099) has been characterized in detail:
Ace was shown to mediate binding to collagen (type I and
IV), dentin and laminin [52-54]. Lebreton et al. [55]

Page 7 of 12

recently presented evidence of an in vivo function of Ace
in enterococcal infections other than involvement in the
interaction with extracellular matrix. It was demonstrated
that an ace deletion mutant was significantly impaired in
virulence, both in an insect model and in an in vivo-in
vitro murine macrophage models. The authors suggested
that Ace may promote E. faecalis phagocytosis and that it
may also be possible that Ace is involved in survival of
enterococci inside phagocytic cells. Also the structurally
related MSCRAMM, Acm, found in E. faecium was
recently reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of this
bacterium [56].
Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins
expressed by a wide variety of epithelial cells, including
those of the gastrointestinal tract, and located at the
interface between the cell and the surrounding environment [57]. The binding of bacteria to mucins through
mucin-binding domain proteins is thought to promote
colonization [58]. Diversity in the carbohydrate side
chains creates a significant heterogeneity among mucins
of different origin (e.g. different organisms or body sites),
facilitating bacterial attachment to epithelial cells [58].
The non-V583 CC2-enriched gene cluster identified
through in silico analysis in the present study harboured
an ORF (HMPREF0346_1863 and HMPREF0348_0427/
HMPREF0348_0428 in HH22 and TX0104, respectively)
with homology to known mucin-binding domain
proteins.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified a set of genes that
appear to be enriched among strains belonging to CC2.
Since a significant proportion (9.1%; p = 0.036, Fisher’s
exact test) of these genes code for proteins associated
with cell surface structures, absence of or divergence in
these loci may lead to antigenic variation. Indeed, both
MSCRAMMs and internalins have been identified as
potential antigens of E. faecalis or other Gram-positive
bacteria [59-61]. It is noteworthy that the genes encoding any of the established enterococcal virulence factors
were not among the CC2-enriched genes. Surface structures that promote adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to
human tissue are also promising targets for creation of
effective vaccines. However, functional studies of the
individual CC2-enriched genes are required in order to
distinguish their implications in enterococcal virulence.
Methods
Bacterial strain and growth conditions

Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.
E. faecalis strains were grown overnight (ON) in brain
heart infusion broth (BHI; Oxoid) at 37° without shaking.
All the strains have previously been sequence typed by the
MLST scheme proposed by Ruiz-Garbajosa et al. [26].

Comparative genomic hybridization
Microarrays

The microarray used in this work has been described
previously [27]. The microarray design has been deposited in the ArrayExpress database with the accession
number A-MEXP-1069 and A-MEXP-1765.

Page 8 of 12

presence or divergence, i. e. genes with Sb-value > 0.75
were classified as present, while genes with Sb-value <
0.75 were classified as divergent. Genes with Sb-value =
0.75 remained unclassified. All genes were tested for significant enrichment among the CC2-strains by using the
Fisher’s exact test.

DNA isolation

Genomic DNA was isolated by using the FP120 FastPrep bead-beater (BIO101/Savent) and the QiaPrep
MiniPrep kit (Qiagen) as previously described [27].

Microarray data accession number

The microarray data have been deposited in the
ArrayExpress database with the series accession number
E-TABM-905.

Fluorescent labeling and hybridization

Fifteen hospital-associated E. faecalis strains were
selected for CGH based on their representation of MLST
sequence types (STs) belonging to major CCs and potential HiRECCs, with a special focus on CC2, and their variety of geographical origins within Europe. Genomic DNA
was labeled and purified with the BioPrime Array CGH
Genomic labeling System (Invitrogen) and Cyanine
Smart Pack dUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified samples were
then dried, prior to resuspension in 140 μl hybridization
solution (5 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1.0% (w/v) bovine
serum albumin, 50% (v/v) formamide and 0.01% (w/v)
single-stranded salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for
16 h at 42°C to the E. faecalis oligonucleotide array in a
Tecan HS 400 pro hybridization station (Tecan). Arrays
were washed twice at 42°C with 2 × SSC + 0.2% SDS, and
twice at 23°C with 2 × SSC, followed by washes at 23°C
with 1) 0.2 × SSC and 2) H2O. Two replicate hybridizations (dye-swap) were performed for each test strain.
Hybridized arrays were scanned at wavelengths of 532
nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) with a Tecan scanner LS
(Tecan). Fluorescent intensities and spot morphologies
were analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular
Devices), and spots were excluded based on slide or morphology abnormalities. All water used for the various
steps of the hybridization and for preparation of solutions
was filtered (0.2 μM) MilliQ dH20.
Data analysis

Standard methods in the LIMMA package [62] in R http://
www.r-project.org/, available from the Bioconductor
http://www.bioconductor.org were employed for preprocessing and normalization. Within-array normalization
was first conducted by subtracting the median from the
log-ratios for each array. A standard loess-normalization
was then performed, where smoothing was based only on
spots with abs(log-ratio) < 2.0 to avoid biases due to
extreme skewness in the log-ratio distribution. For the
determination of present and divergent genes a method
that predicts sequence identity based on array signals was
used, as described by Snipen et al. [63]. A threshold of
0.75 was used in order to obtain a categorical response of

Polymerase chain reaction

The presence of selected genes was verified by means of
polymerase chain reactions (PCR). A similar approach
was also applied to investigate the presence of selected
mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Primers targeting the
genes flanking the MGEs were combined with internal
primers to monitor the presence of the junctions on
either side of each MGE. PCR was carried out in 20 μl
reaction volumes containing 1× buffer, 250 μM of each
deoxynucleotide triphosphate and 1 U DyNAZyme II
polymerase (Finnzymes). The reaction conditions
included an initial denaturation step at 95°C and 35
cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 56-60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1-5
min, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min.
The primers used in this study are listed in Table 2.
Validation of microarray data by sequencing

Sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism Big dye
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PrismTM 3100 Genetic Analyzer and
primers listed in Table 2.

CC2 pangenome content analysis

Among the newly released E. faecalis draft genomes
were two CC2-strains; HH22 and TX0104. In order to
extend the list of CC2-enriched genes beyond V583, we
conducted a BLAST search using the annotated genes of
these two strains as queries against the full genome
sequences of the other draft genomes. Again, a cutoff of

75% identity to the query was used to distinguish
present from divergent genes.
