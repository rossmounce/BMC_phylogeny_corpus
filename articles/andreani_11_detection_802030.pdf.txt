Abstract
Background: Genetic characterization of HIV-1 in Argentina has shown that BF recombinants predominate among
heterosexuals and injecting drug users, while in men who have sex with men the most prevalent form is subtype
B.
Objectives: The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of HIV dual infections in HIV-infected individuals
with high probability of reinfection
Study design: Blood samples were collected from 23 HIV positive patients with the risk of reinfection from Buenos
Aires. A fragment of the HIV gene pol was amplified and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Antiretroviral drug
resistance patterns of all the sequences were analyzed.
Results: Five dual infections were detected with four patients coinfected with subtype B and BF recombinants and
one patient was coinfected with two BF recombinants presenting different recombination patterns. Prolonged
infection with a stable clinical condition was observed in the five individuals. Resistance mutation patterns were
different between the predominant and the minority strains.
Conclusions: Our results show that HIV dual infection can occur with closely related subtypes, and even with
different variants of the same recombinant form in certain populations. Clinical observations showed neither
aggressive disease progression nor impact on the resistance patterns in the dually-infected patients.

Findings
The occurrence of infection with more than one strain
of HIV-1 has important implications for understanding
HIV transmission and for the development of an AIDS
vaccine, as well as the fact that it is leading to many
recombinant strains of global epidemiological relevance
[1-3].
Resistance concerns also emerged as a key issue for
dually infected patients, since they can acquire a resistant strain or generate a multidrug-resistant virus [4].
Nevertheless, the influence of superinfection on resistance evolution is still unclear [5].

The genetic characterization of HIV-1 in Argentina
showed that BF recombinant forms are the most prevalent genetic forms among heterosexuals, and among
intravenous drug users (IDUs); while subtype B is the
most prevalent in men who have sex with men (MSM)
[6-8]. Thus, patients with multiple epidemiological risks
(e.g. bisexual men and/or IDUs) may be exposed to
both subtype B and BF recombinants.
To evaluate the presence of HIV-1 dual infections we
selected HIV-1 positive individuals whom presented
multiple epidemiological risks for HIV-1 infection, based
on confidential interviews regarding sexual behavior,
intravenous drug use and medical history, in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Informed consent was obtained from
all individuals. Blood samples were collected and serological studies were performed. Total RNA and genomic
DNA isolation from plasma and PBMC respectively
were performed, (QIAgen, Valencia, CA, USA). A pol

gene fragment was amplified as described [9], and
cloned into the pCR2.1-Topo vector (Invitrogen) or
evaluate by single genome amplification (SGA) [9]. The
amplicons were then sequenced with Big Dye terminators using an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems Inc, Foster City CA). Drug resistance phenotype was determined using the Stanford University HIV
Drug Resistance. Sequence alignment was performed
using the CLUSTAL × software, followed by a Neighbor-joining method with Kimura’s two-parameter model
of distance calculation using MEGA 4.1. Recombinant
analysis was performed using SimPlot v2.5
For case 1 (C1), a dual infection was found in the first
sample (C1S1), where 1 out of 21 clones clustered with
BF recombinants and the rest with subtype B. The
recombinant BF clone exhibited a different pol gene
recombination pattern than CRF12_BF. However, in
C1S2 (2 years later) all of the 12 clones clustered with
subtype B references (Figure 1a). The mean of the
genetic distances of the B sequences from C1S1 compared to those from C1S2 was 2%, while their distance
to other Argentine subtype B sequences was close to

5%, suggesting that C1S2 sequences did not occur due
to a new superinfection. This patient was diagnosed in
September 1991 and until the sampling period has been
asymptomatic. He reported having had heterosexual
contacts but for the last 10 years he has only had homosexual intercourse. He had been receiving antiretroviral
(ARV) treatment since 1995 (Table 1). The analysis of
resistance pattern showed that there were relevant resistance mutations in the RT (Table 2).
In the only sample available from C2, 1 out of 25
sequenced clones clustered with subtype B while the
others clustered with BF recombinants (Figure 1b). The
BF clones exhibited a similar pol gene recombination
pattern to CRF12_BF (Figure 1b). This patient was diagnosed in January 2000 and reported having had only
homosexual encounters, with some male partners being
foreigners and/or HIV-infected. He had no resistance
mutations in the BF clones, but subtype B sequence
showed major PI resistance mutations (Table 2).
In C3, two sequences clustered with the CRF12_ BF,
while 13 grouped with B references (Figure 2a). HIV
infection was diagnosed in 2000 and the patient

she was also coinfected with HCV and HBV. The
patient was clinically asymptomatic during sampling and
had never been on HAART (Table 1).
In C5S1, all the sequences clustered with the
CRF12_BF with a high bootstrap value (Figure B.e). In
C5S2, besides proviral DNA, RNA was also analyzed by
cloning. One sequence from S2 amplified by SGA clustered with a BF recombinant showing a different recombination pattern confirmed by bootscanning analysis
(Figure 2c). The NJ tree showed that sequences from
both samples formed one cluster. HIV infection in this
patient was diagnosed in 1998. He reported being an
IDU as his only risk factor and was coinfected with
HCV. He had always had high CD4 T-cell counts and
was clinically asymptomatic at the time of the study
(Table 1). He had received HAART therapy but he

declared having had sexual intercourse with members of
both sexes. This patient discontinued his treatment
without medical indication. But during the sampling
period (2004) he was again on HAART and clinically
asymptomatic (Table 1).
In C4S1, 20 sequences were obtained from DNA and
amplified by SGA and 11 clones from RNA. As shown,
one sequence derived from DNA clustered with subtype
B references while 19 clustered with CRF12_ BF references (Figure 2b). Recombination as well as similarity to
the CRF12_BF was confirmed (Figure 2b). In C4S2, 22
clones clustered with CRF12_BF references. The HIV
infection was diagnosed in 1993. Fifteen years prior to
the sample collection, he conceded to having had sexual
intercourse with men, with only heterosexual relations
thereafter. His female partner was an IDU HIV+ and

interrupted it two years before the first sample was
taken (Table 2).
It has been observed that several drug resistance-associated mutations in the pol region of BF recombinant
variants include mutations which are in fact natural
polymorphisms of the BF strains [10,11]. Therefore, we
only considered major PI-resistance associated mutations to categorize viral variants as resistant. Among the
B sequences in C1, there were multiple resistance mutations to NRTI and NNRTI, but the unique BF sequence
was susceptible. Hence, the selective pressure of the
treatment could be responsible for the predominance of
subtype B [12]. Moreover, the changes in the resistance
patterns from C1S1 to C1S2 completely mirrored the
treatment change (Tables 1 and 2). The fitness costs on
the persistence of M184V in the absence of selective
pressure has been extensively studied [13] and it has
been observed that viruses carrying the TAMs M41L,
L210W and T215Y have higher fitness than those with
M184V [14]. Therefore, between C1S1 and C1S2,

M184V did not persist in the viral population, while the
TAMs did. A similar rationale can support the loss of
NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. Finally, since
the presence of at least three TAMs is associated with
cross-resistance to ddI [14], the new HAART scheme
actually worked as monotherapy leading to the selection
of multiple PI resistance-associated mutations.
In C2, although he had never received ARV therapy,
subtype B strain clone was drug-resistant. This virus
could have been acquired from a person with a resistant
strain, and thus become the minority one because of its
lower fitness [15]. Also, in C4 only one sequence from
C4S1 carried a mutation to PR while one sequence
from C4S2 had one mutation to RT. Since C4 had
never received ART, these minority viral quasispecies
might have disappeared. The evolution of his HIV disease had not been aggressive over time, but the RNA
and proviral DNA sequences from C4S1 intermingled
among the proviral sequences from S2, indicating active
replication [16].

HIV-1 superinfections have been described after treatment interruption, as in C3, the minority CRF12_BF
virus did not show any resistance mutations, it could be
hypothesized that it might have been acquired after
treatment interruption [17] (Table 2).
C5 had been under HAART, but treatment had been
suspended due to medical advice. As with C4, active
replication was observed [16]. The putative superinfection was likely coincidental with the relapse of intravenous drug use; which may explain the fact that the
secondary virus was a BF recombinant, since these are
common among IDUs [7]. Previous HAART probably
explains the resistance mutations found in sequences of
the predominant virus. Since the secondary viral
sequence did not show any resistance mutations, as in
C3, treatment interruption might have been a major
predisposing factor leading to superinfection [17]. This
individual could have acquired the second infection at
least 8 years after the first one. In this regard, recent
studies have found lack of protection against superinfection in chronic HIV-infected individuals as well as no
significant deficits in neutralizing antibodies response
[18]. In C5, the evaluation of the recombination patterns
of each sequence and the analysis of partial trees performed taking into account the breakpoint of the superinfecting strain, suggest that, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case of HIV dual-infection
with different BF recombinants (Figure 2c and data not
shown).
The link between dual infection and recombinant
forms has been already shown [19,20], and since a
high viral load level is important in transmission, it
could be that recombinants are generated in individuals who also develop higher viral loads and readily
transmit them. Eventually, superinfection and double
infection would be expected to increase the complexity of viral genotypes circulating in the population
[21,22].
In this report, we described five cases of dual infections from 23 individuals with multiple epidemiological
risks. This study underlines the frequency of dual
infection in high risk populations, but additional
research will be needed to interpret superinfection in
the context of anti-HIV-1 immunity and vaccine
development.
