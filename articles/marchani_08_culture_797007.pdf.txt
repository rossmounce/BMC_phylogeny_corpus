Abstract
Background: Near the junction of three major continents, the Caucasus region has been an
important thoroughfare for human migration. While the Caucasus Mountains have diverted human
traffic to the few lowland regions that provide a gateway from north to south between the Caspian
and Black Seas, highland populations have been isolated by their remote geographic location and
their practice of patrilocal endogamy. We investigate how these cultural and historical differences
between highland and lowland populations have affected patterns of genetic diversity. We test 1)
whether the highland practice of patrilocal endogamy has generated sex-specific population
relationships, and 2) whether the history of migration and military conquest associated with the
lowland populations has left Central Asian genes in the Caucasus, by comparing genetic diversity
and pairwise population relationships between Daghestani populations and reference populations
throughout Europe and Asia for autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-chromosomal markers.
Results: We found that the highland Daghestani populations had contrasting histories for the
mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data sets. Y-chromosomal haplogroup diversity was
reduced among highland Daghestani populations when compared to other populations and to
highland Daghestani mitochondrial DNA haplogroup diversity. Lowland Daghestani populations
showed Turkish and Central Asian affinities for both mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal data sets.
Autosomal population histories are strongly correlated to the pattern observed for the
mitochondrial DNA data set, while the correlation between the mitochondrial DNA and Ychromosome distance matrices was weak and not significant.
Conclusion: The reduced Y-chromosomal diversity exhibited by highland Daghestani populations
is consistent with genetic drift caused by patrilocal endogamy. Mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal
phylogeographic comparisons indicate a common Near Eastern origin of highland populations.
Lowland Daghestani populations show varying influence from Near Eastern and Central Asian
populations.

Background
The populations of the Caucasus region have complex histories of isolation and gene flow. The region as a whole
has served as a gateway between continents, with waves of
human migration leaving rich cultural and linguistic
diversity in their wake [1,2]. The Caucasus Mountains
have shaped the routes of migrating populations and military invasions, diverting these travellers away from the
remote highlands and into the more easily accessible lowlands. Differences between highland and lowland populations are exaggerated by the marriage practices of
highland populations: wives move to the home of their
husbands, while husbands remain in the land of their
forefathers for generations [3,4].
We have identified five populations from Daghestan that
have been influenced by both physical and cultural barriers to gene flow. Three are highland isolates, while two
lowland populations represent admixed groups influenced by Turkic and Mongolian migrants. We investigate
whether the geographic barrier of altitude, the cultural
barrier of patrilocal endogamy, or the introduction of
migrants from a great distance have left detectable patterns in the genetic diversity of these populations. Specifically, we ask 1) whether geographic isolation and
patrilocal endogamy have caused more genetic drift in
highland than lowland populations, and 2) whether lowland populations show evidence of admixture from Turkic
and Mongolian migrants.
We test these hypotheses by comparing mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome (non-recombining,
NRY) haplogroup frequencies among Daghestani, Near
Eastern, Central Asian, Central/Northern European, and
East Asian populations, as well as autosomal variation in
100 polymorphic Alu insertions among Daghestani, Central/Northern European, and East Asian populations. We
compare measures of haplogroup diversity and pairwise
distance for the mtDNA and NRY markers, then compare
these to genetic distances from the autosomal data, looking for evidence of genetic drift and shared origins. Our
results demonstrate that the cultural practice of patrilocality and historic population movements have shaped
genetic variation in these Caucasus populations.

Methods
Populations
The Avar, Dargin, and Kubachi populations sampled in
our study live in the highlands of Daghestan (Figure 1).
They each speak different languages belonging to the
Northeast Caucasian language family. The Avars and Dargins have traditionally been agriculturalists and pastoralists, while the Kubachi have specialized in jewelry making
[5]. These highland populations are isolated due to their
remote location, their linguistic variation, and their prac-

tice of strict patrilocal endogamy [3,4]. This marriage
practice controls the inheritance of property and restricts
male gene flow [3]. These populations are thought to be
indigenous to the region but, like other native peoples of
the Caucasus region, their exact origins are unclear [6].
Previous genetic studies have revealed that populations
within the Caucasus region do not share the genetic variation believed by some researchers to be a signature of the
Neolithic expansion through Europe, leading some to
infer that these populations are remnants of a more
ancient Eurasian population [3,7,8]. Others suggest that
the Caucasus region is instead inhabited by a collection of
peoples who represent those who have travelled through
or invaded the region in the historic past [4,9,10].
The Nogai and Kumiks of the Daghestani lowlands have a
history of admixture. These populations speak different
languages belonging to the Kipchak division of the Turkic
language family and are more exogamous than the highland populations [11,12]. The Kumik population represents a mixture of native peoples of the Caucasus with
Turkic migrants from the 4th to the 15th centuries and may
be descended from the Kipchaks, an ancient Turkic population [10,12]. The Kumiks currently practice a flexible
form of virilocality and frequently exchange mates with
other villages. The Nogai are descended from the Nogai
khanate of the Mongol empire, established in the 12th century, which arrived in Daghestan in the 13th and 14th centuries [5,11]. Although administrated by Mongolians, this
khanate was peopled by many native Caucasian ethnic
groups [11,12], suggesting that the Nogai are an admixed
population. The Nogai practice dual exogamy, prohibiting marriage within one's kin group or patronymic, a practice that encourages gene flow.
Overall, the five ethnic groups sampled for our study are
representative of the genetic variation to be found in
Daghestan, as these groups represent approximately onehalf of the country's population [3]. DNA samples were
obtained following voluntary consent procedures developed and approved by the Daghestan IRB at the Institute
of History, Archeology and Ethnology of Daghestan
Center, of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
To place the genetic variation observed within Daghestan
into a regional perspective, we include mtDNA and NRY
data obtained from the literature for several Near Eastern
and Central Asian populations in our analyses. Near Eastern populations include Crimean Tatars [2,13], Georgians
[2,14], Iranians [2,13], and Turks [14,15]. The Central
Asian populations included in this study are Kazak [2,13],
Karakalpak [2,13], and Mongolian [2,16].
We are unable to include these Near Eastern and Central
Asian population in our analyses of autosomal Alu inser-

tion variation, as comparable data have not been published. We therefore include Central/Northern European
and East Asian populations in our study of mtDNA, NRY,
and Alu insertion variation. Our Central/Northern European sample includes 15 French and 57 Utahns of Central/Northern European ancestry, while the East Asian
population includes 9 Cambodians, 13 Han Chinese, 16
Japanese, 5 Malay, 3 Taiwanese, and 9 Vietnamese individuals. These populations are geographically and genetically more distant from the Daghestani populations than
the Near Eastern and Central Asian populations. As such,
they act as extreme values in pairwise distance calculations and principal components analyses. These populations place the observed differences between Daghestani
and other populations into a broader perspective. Distances between Daghestani populations and the Central/
Northern European and East Asian populations serve as a
yardstick against which distances within Daghestan, and
between Daghestani populations and populations from
the Near East and Central Asia may be measured.

Mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup Variation
We have genotyped 62 Avar, 28 Dargin, 25 Kubachi, 26
Kumik, 33 Nogai, 54 East Asian, and 71 Central/Northern
European individuals for the following 24 mtDNA haplogroup-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
using ABI SNaPshot (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
multiplexes designed by WSW [17]: A1811G, T4646C,
A4833G, C4883T, G7598A, A7768G, G7805A, A7933G,
C8137T, G8994A, G9055A, T9090C, G9266A, A9545G,
C10400T, T10436C, C10810T, C10873T, A12308G,
A12612G, T12705C, A13263G, T14766C, A14793G. We
have refined these data by identifying mtDNA haplogroup
defining SNPs [16,18-20] in the HVS-I sequences of our
samples. We performed new HVS-I sequencing for our
Avar samples, while the sequences for the other Daghestani populations are available in the literature [3]. We
were able to define 26 mtDNA haplogroups with these
data, with the combinations of SNPs used to define each
mtDNA haplogroup in our samples listed in additional
file 1: mtDNAdefinitions.xls. MtDNA haplogroup frequencies among Near Eastern and Central Asian populations were obtained from the literature [13,14,16].

Y-chromosome Haplogroup Variation
In a similar fashion, we have genotyped the males of the
above sample (18 Avar, 8 Dargin, 14 Kubachi, 10 Kumik,
16 Nogai, 31 East Asian, and 61 Central/Northern European individuals) for the following 19 NRY haplogroupdefining SNPs using ABI SNaPshot (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) multiplexes designed by WSW [17]:
M122, M145, M17, M170, M172, M173, M174, M175,
M181, M20, M201, M207, M216, M52, M74, M89, M9,
M91, M96. NRY haplogroup frequencies among Near
Eastern and Central Asian populations were obtained
from the literature [2,15]. We follow the phylogeny and
nomenclature established by the Y Chromosome Consortium [21], with the combination of SNPs used to define
each haplogroup listed in additional file 2: NRYdefinitions.xls.
Autosomal Alu Insertion Variation
Genotypes for 100 Alu insertions have been previously
published [22] for the Dargin, Kubachi, Kumik, Nogai,
Central/Northern European and East Asian individuals
genotyped for the mtDNA SNPs.
Analytical Methods
Haplogroup diversity within Daghestani populations was
calculated using Nei's h statistic [23]. The pairwise genetic
distances between populations were calculated using population pairwise FST. Genetic distances were tested for significant differences from zero with 10,000 permutations
in a randomization test (Arlequin 2.0; [24]). Principal
components analyses were performed using MATLAB
R2007b in order to visualize the genetic relationships
between populations. Mantel tests, using 10,000 random
permutations in Arlequin 2.0, were performed to assess
the correlations among the NRY, mtDNA, and Alu distance matrices.

Results
Haplogroup Frequencies and Diversity
Mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies and diversity values are presented in Table 1. The Daghestani populations
resemble our samples from Central/Northern Europe and
Turkey in their frequencies of common haplogroups HV,
T, and U5. The highland Kubachi are an exception, with
more than 75% of the sample possessing subtypes of haplogroup U, most commonly observed in Central/Northern Europe and Russia [25]. The lowland Nogai samples
resemble the samples from Central and East Asia, as all
have appreciable frequencies of haplogroups B, C, and D.
The range of haplogroup diversity values within Daghestan lies within the range observed among other populations, with neither highland (Avar, Dargin, Kubachi) nor
lowland (Kumik, Nogai) Daghestani populations exhibiting unusually high or low values.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/47

NRY haplogroup frequencies and diversity values are presented in Table 2. The highland Avar, Dargin, and
Kubachi populations exhibit high frequencies of haplogroup F (including haplogroup G, see Discussion), which
is also common in many Near Eastern populations. The
lowland Nogai and Kumik samples exhibit a mixture of
European, Near Eastern, and Central Asian haplogroups.
The lowland Kumik and Nogai populations have NRY
haplogroup diversity values as high as those observed in
the Near East and Central Asia, while the highland Daghestani populations have lower NRY haplogroup diversity,
less than or equal to that observed in our Central/Northern European sample. The highland Dargins are exceptional, with a Nei's h value of zero, as all males sampled
belong to NRY haplogroup F.
Population Pairwise Distances
Genetic distances based on mtDNA haplogroup frequencies are shown in the upper triangle of Table 3, while the
NRY pairwise distances are shown in the lower triangle.
The NRY population pairwise distances show no differentiation between the highland Daghestani populations,
while the Avar and Dargin highland populations are significantly different from the highland Kubachi with
respect to the mtDNA. This suggests that either the history
of Daghestani Y chromosomes differs from that of the
mtDNA and autosomal loci, or that the males genotyped
for the NRY polymorphisms are not sufficiently representative of the population at large. The Kumik and Turkish
populations have FST values of zero, while the Nogai have
low genetic distances to the Near Eastern and Central
Asian populations, for both the mtDNA and NRY data
sets.

The autosomal pairwise genetic distances calculated from
the 100 Alu loci (Table 4) are similar to those observed for
the mtDNA data but not the NRY data. Mantel tests of correlation between the mtDNA, NRY, and autosomal distance matrices (Table 5) demonstrate a strong and
significant correlation between the mtDNA and Alu distances, a weaker correlation between the NRY and Alu distances, and no significant correlation between the NRY
and mtDNA distance matrices.
Principal Components Analysis
Figure 2 presents the principal components analysis
results for the mtDNA haplogroup frequency data. The
first principal component, explaining 41% of the variance, identifies the Central/Northern European and East
Asian populations as the extremes. Populations fall along
the first principal components axis in a rough west-to-east
gradient, with the exception of the Daghestani populations. The highland Kubachi are isolated by the second
principal component, explaining 23% of the variance.
This is likely due to genetic drift leading to the observed

The third principal component, explaining 13% of the

Discussion
Cultural restrictions on marriage practices have proved to
be powerful barriers to gene flow, as evidenced by the historical caste system in India [26] and patrilocal marriage
practices throughout the world [27-29]. Because highland
Daghestani populations practice patrilocal endogamy, we
would expect that they would exhibit reduced genetic
diversity and larger genetic distances when compared to
other populations with respect to the NRY but not
mtDNA. Our observations are consistent with these predictions. We see a reduction of genetic diversity in the
NRY among highland populations compared to that in
other populations and to their own mtDNA diversity. This
pattern of reduction is not observed for the lowland Daghestani populations.
We see no significant correlation between the mtDNA and
NRY distance matrices. Y chromosomes of highland
Daghestanis appear to have undergone genetic drift independent of the population history of mitochondrial and
autosomal loci, suggesting that restrictions on marriage,
and not geographic isolation, are the causal agents for
NRY drift among highland populations. This is consistent
with previous research [30], which found that the mountain range had not acted as a significant barrier to gene
flow between populations located north and south of the
Caucasus Mountains.
The highland Kubachi form an endogamous isolate of
nearly 3,000 individuals [5], restricting both male and
female gene flow. Our results indicate genome-wide signs
of genetic drift for this population. For each set of markers, the Kubachi population has high pairwise distance
values to lowland Daghestani populations as well as to
reference populations. These patterns of genetic isolation
are reflected in the mtDNA and autosomal principal com-

ponents analyses, where the Kubachi are isolated from
other populations by the second principal component.
Patrilocal endogamy should have resulted in each highland population drifting to different extremes, as the stochastic process of genetic drift occurs independently in
each population. Instead, we see that all Daghestani highland populations share high frequencies of NRY haplogroup F in contrast to their neighbours. When we break
haplogroup F down to include haplogroups G and J,
greater detail emerges. The highland Avar, Dargin, and
Kubachi exhibit high frequencies of haplogroup J (0.56,
1.00, and 0.67, respectively), though haplogroup F is still
present among the Kubachi (0.25), and haplogroup G is
observed among the Avar (0.06), Kumik (0.10), and
Nogai (0.06) populations. The NRY haplogroup frequencies among highland Daghestani populations are consistent with a shared common ancestral population
dominated by NRY haplogroup J and other haplogroups
observed among Near Eastern and Indian populations
[31-33].

Phylogeographic analysis of the mtDNA haplogroups
found in highland Daghestani populations also suggests
Near Eastern and Caucasus-specific origins [31,32,34,35].
Among the highland Daghestani populations, we observe
polymorphic frequencies of Near Eastern mitochondrial
haplogroups U1 and W and Caucasian haplogroups U3,
U4, and X. An extreme case is observed among the
Kubachi, who maintain high frequencies of mitochondrial haplogroups U1 (48%) and U2 (24%), though these
haplogroups are generally rare in other populations.
Together, the mitochondrial and NRY haplogroup histories suggest that the highland Daghestani populations
possess genetic variation that has not been substantially
influenced by recent migrants.
Genetic variation among the lowland Kumik and Nogai
populations reveals a diverse heritage influenced to varying degrees by Turkic and Mongolian migrants. Both the
Kumiks and Nogai possess high levels of mtDNA and NRY
haplogroup diversity, consistent with multiethnic origins.
Kumiks show genetic affiliation with Near Eastern popu-

lations for all measures of mtDNA and NRY genetic variation, with FST distances to the Turkish population
equalling zero for both analyses. This is consistent with
historical evidence of a Turkic origin of the Kumik population.
The Nogai population is defined by its relationship to the
administration of the Mongol Empire in the Caucasus,
when Mongolians ruled over the native peoples of the
Caucasus region [11,12]. We might expect that this historical event would have mainly introduced Central Asian
males to the native populations of the Caucasus, and
would have subsequently introduced more Central Asian
Y chromosomes than mtDNA variants to the Caucasian
gene pool [36]. If instead, the Nogai represent a population of both males and females that migrated to the Caucasus region, we would expect the mtDNA and NRY
histories to be similar to each other. In fact, this is the case

for the Kalmyks, a Russian population who migrated from
Mongolia approximately 300 years ago [37].
The Nogai do show clear evidence of an Asian heritage.
Approximately half of the mitochondrial and NRY haplogroups observed among the Nogai are of Asian origin
(mtDNA: M, C, Z, D, G; NRY: C, D, O, O3) [34,35]. They
are also placed between the Near Eastern and Central
Asian populations for both mtDNA and NRY principal
components analyses. Autosomal Alu analyses places the
Nogai at an intermediate position between the East Asian
and other Daghestani populations, and are consistent
with the pattern observed in the mtDNA analyses. The
relationships between the Nogai and Central Asian and
Near Eastern populations are consistent across marker
types, showing the importance of including Near Eastern
and Central Asian populations in our analyses. It is quite
possible that our small (N = 16) sample of Nogai males is
not representative of the full spectrum of NRY genetic var-

results demonstrate that population history, geographic
isolation, and patrilocality have all left detectable signatures on the genetic landscape of the Caucasus.

Conclusion

Authors' contributions

This study describes the effects of culture, geography, and
gene flow on genetic diversity among Daghestani populations. Highland populations show reduced Y-chromosome diversity, but autosomal and mtDNA variation is
not reduced, reflecting the effects of a patrilocal mating
system. Mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal phylogeographic inferences suggest a Near Eastern or Caucasusregion origin of the highland populations. Our results,
including haplogroup sharing, genetic diversity, and patterns of population pairwise distance lead us to confirm
that the lowland Kumik and Nogai populations have been
