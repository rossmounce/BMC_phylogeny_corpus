Abstract
Background: In this paper, we introduce a novel inter-range interaction integrated approach for
protein domain boundary prediction. It involves (1) the design of modular kernel algorithm, which
is able to effectively exploit the information of non-local interactions in amino acids, and (2) the
development of a novel profile that can provide suitable information to the algorithm. One of the
key features of this profiling technique is the use of multiple structural alignments of remote
homologues to create an extended sequence profile and combines the structural information with
suitable chemical information that plays an important role in protein stability. This profile can
capture the sequence characteristics of an entire structural superfamily and extend a range of
profiles generated from sequence similarity alone.
Results: Our novel profile that combines homology information with hydrophobicity from
SARAH1 scale was successful in providing more structural and chemical information. In addition,
the modular approach adopted in our algorithm proved to be effective in capturing information
from non-local interactions. Our approach achieved 82.1%, 50.9% and 31.5% accuracies for onedomain, two-domain, and three- and more domain proteins respectively.
Conclusion: The experimental results in this study are encouraging, however, more work is need
to extend it to a broader range of applications. We are currently developing a novel interactive
(human in the loop) profiling that can provide information from more distantly related homology.
This approach will further enhance the current study.

Background
The accurate delineation of protein domain boundaries is an
important step for the prediction of protein structure,
function, evolution and design. Since a single domain spans

an entire polypeptide chain or a subunit of such a chain,
domains provide one of the most useful sources of information for understanding protein function, analysis based on
domain families, and the study of individual proteins [1,2].

Proteins are composed of smaller building blocks, which
are called “domains” or “modules”. These building
blocks are distinct regions in three-dimensional (3D)
structure resulting in protein architectures assembled
from modular segments that have evolved independently [3]. The modular nature of proteins has many
advantages, offering new cooperative functions and
enhanced stability. For example, new proteins, such as
chimeric proteins, can be created because they are
composed of multi-functional domains [4]. The search
method for templates used in comparative modelling
can be optimised by delineating domain boundaries,
since the templates are classified on the basis of domains
[5]. Domain boundary prediction can improve the
performance of threading methods by enhancing their
signal-to-noise ratio [6], and for homologous domains
plays a key role in reliable multiple sequence alignment [7].
Over the past three decades, a large number of methods
using the 3D coordinates of protein structure have been
proposed for more accurately delineating domain
boundaries [8]. However, the demand for fully automated approaches to identify domains in globular
proteins from one-dimensional (1D) atomic coordinates
has significantly grown over recent years [9,10]; because,
genome and other sequencing projects have produced a
flux of DNA and protein sequence data [11]. Many
automated systems have shown reasonable improvements since they have successfully captured the information of a single molecule or of neighbouring residues
involving short-range (local) interactions. However, at
the same time, their limitations in the exploitation of
information from long-range (non-local) interactions
have been observed [12-15]. These limitations are related
to model overfitting, and the weak signal-to-noise ratio
associated with non-local interactions, which lead to the
problem of the “vanishing gradient”.
In this paper, we introduce a novel inter-range interaction integrated approach for protein domain boundary
prediction. It involves (1) the design of modular kernel
algorithm, which is able to effectively exploit the
information of non-local interactions, and (2) the
development of a novel profile that can provide suitable
information to the algorithm. One of the key features of
this profiling technique is the use of multiple structural
alignments of remote homologues to create extended
sequence profiles and combines the structural information with suitable chemical information that plays an
important role in protein stability. This profile can
capture the sequence characteristics of an entire structural superfamily and extend a range of profiles
generated from sequence similarity alone.

Results
To see the suitability of our proposed approach in
domain boundary prediction, we have chosen the most
widely adopted machine-learning models and profiles
for comparison. Our experiment has three consecutive
steps. First, we compare the performance of our modular
neural network, Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME)
with two other well-regarded machine-learning models
in protein domain boundary prediction, transductive
support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layered perceptron (MLP). Second, in the model comparison, the
effectiveness of hydrophobicity information presented in
Evolutionary and Hydrophobicity profile (EH-profile) is
thoroughly tested and compared with widely known
evolutionary profile, position specific scoring matrix
(PSSM) generated by PSI-BLAST [16]. Last, the performance of our modular kernel approach (MKA) that
consists of HME model and EH-profile is compared with
three other protein domain boundary predictors on
Benchmark_3 and CASP8 datasets.
The performance of each model was measured by the
fractions of true negative and true positive (TNf: the
proportion of true negative data correctly predicted) and
TPf: the proportion of true positive data correctly
predicted), the sensitivity (Sn: the proportion of correctly
predicted domain boundary residues with respect to the
total positively identified residues), the specificity (Sp:
the proportion of incorrectly predicted boundary residues with respect to the total number of domain
boundary residues), correlation-coefficient (Cc: an
equal balance between positive and negative predictions,
between -1 and 1) and accuracy (Ac: the proportion of
true-positive and true-negative residues with respect to
the total positive and negative residues). Cc reflects a
situation in that a method, which predicts every residue
to be positive, shows a prediction accuracy of 100% in
detecting positive boundaries, but 0% accuracy for
negative residues. Hence, a high value of Cc means
that the model is regarded as a more robust prediction
system.
We adopted a sevenfold cross-validation scheme for the
model evaluation. Cross validation effectively solves the
potential problems caused by residual evaluations.
Because the residual uses the entire dataset in the
training, it does not give an indication of how well the
model will predict for unseen data. For this reason, we
remove some of the data before training begins. When
training is completed, the data that was removed can be
used to test the performance of the learned model on
new data. The advantage of this method is that it matters
less how the data gets divided. Every data point gets to be
in one of the test sets (exactly once), and gets to be in

one of the training sets (six times in sevenfold cross
validation).
In this experiment, the dataset is divided into seven
subsets, and the holdout method is repeated seven times.
Each time, one of the seven subsets is used as the test set
and the other (six) subsets are put together to form a
training set. The estimated prediction accuracy is the
average of the prediction accuracy for the models,
derived from the independently and randomly generated
test divisions.
In our preliminary experiments [17], we tested five
different window sizes (3, 7, 11, 19 and 27) for each
model and found that the window size of 11 is the most
suitable for our experiments. A window size of 11 means
which contain 23 amino acids with 11 preceding and 11
following amino acids for the boundary residue (located
at the centre of the window).
Table 1 summarises confusion matrices for each test
model. The predictive performance of proposed model
(HME) was compared with two other machine-learning
models. They were tested with two different profiles. As
indicated, the standard deviation for each model is
insignificant, suggesting reasonable performance consistency. The average accuracy over three models for EHprofile is about 3 percentage points better than evolutionary profile. This proves our hypothesis that the
hydrophobicity information used in EH-profile provides
suitable information as it performs key roles for protein
stability. Clearly, EH-profile is more useful than the
widely known evolutionary profile for protein domain
boundary prediction. More importantly, the performance of HME with EH-profile showed the best
predictive performance (Ac: 0.78). With evolutionary
profile, it also outperformed other models in Sn, Cc, and
Ac. The modular approach used in HME improved its
predictive performance by effectively capturing the
information from non-local interactions. In other
words, it is more resistant to model overfitting, and the
weak signal-to-noise ratio associated, which lead to the
problem of vanishing gradient.

Finally, our modular kernel approach (MKA) that
comprises HME model and EH-profile, and three other
well-known predictors, were evaluated on Benchmark_3
and CASP8 datasets. DOMpro [18] uses evolutionary
information (gene-exon shuffling), secondary structure
and solvent accessibility information with a recursive
neural network. DOMpro is trained and tested on a
curated dataset derived from the CATH database. It
achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 71%,
respectively in the CAFASP4 and was ranked among the
top ab initio domain predictors. DomNet [17] is a
recently introduced machine-learning algorithm that
uses a novel compact domain profile (CD-profile). It
outperformed nine other machine-learning methods on
Benchmark_2 dataset. DomNet is trained with an interdomain linker-region index, secondary structure and
relative solvent accessibility information with CD-profile. CD-profile uses additional structural information
from conserved-domain database [19] because conserved domains contain conserved sequence patterns or
motifs, which allows for their detection in polypeptide
sequences. Hence, the PSSMs in conserved domain
database can be useful to find remote homology.
DomPred [20] uses a combined homology and foldrecognition based approach. The sequence homology
approach simply attempts to distinguish boundaries
from overlapping edges in PSI-BLAST multiple sequence
alignments using hidden Markov models. The fold
recognition approach relies on secondary structure
element alignments, using DomSSEA method [20] to
find domain boundaries in more distant homologs. The
DomSSEA has been shown to provide a rapid prediction
of the fold for given sequences with no detectable
homology to any known structure and have also been
applied to the related problem of novel fold detection.
The method has an accuracy of 49% at predicting the
domain boundary location within 20 residues using a
representative set of two domain chains.
Table 2 shows the accuracies obtained by each predictor
on Benchmark_3 and CASP8 datasets. The accuracies
were provided based on the number of domains in a
sequence. We combined multi-domain proteins in

CASP8 dataset. This, because, we have too small number
of sequences (causing statistically insignificant) if we
split them based on the number of domains.
MKA correctly predicted 86 of all 106 targets for
1-domain chains and showed 82.1% accuracy. The
accuracy of MKA was 0.9 percentage points less than
DomNet in 1-domain prediction. In 2-domain prediction, DomNet still performed better as it predicted 113
of all 208 chains correctly. However, with 3-domain and
more chains, only MKA correctly predicted with above
30% accuracy. Its accuracy in this category was 10.5 and
11.7 percentage points higher than DomNet and
DOMpro respectively. Again, MKA showed the best
performance (51.9%) with the multi-domain proteins
in CASP8. This means MKA more consistently captures
information from EH-profile and eventually leads to
model stability and robustness. Although it is well
acknowledged that the model stability is a more
important factor than the learning bias in predictive
performance [21], several important issues that should
be taken into account in order to improve the
performance of the proposed MKA. This will be
discussed in the next section.
Two experiments performed in this study proved that
hydrophobicity information presented in the EH-profile
provides useful information. However, the PSSMs in the
conserved domain database used by DomNet can be of a
central source, providing valuable structural/homology
information. Because, conserved sequence patterns in
the PSSMs of conserved domain database are effectively
recognised by its learning model. The computational
learning model was also specially designed for processing high-dimensional data with the focus of the
exploitation of local-interaction information. Because
of these capacities, the predictor showed even more
powerful performance in the prediction of singledomain proteins and as demonstrated in the two
above-mentioned experimental results.

Discussion
Although many machine-learning-based domain predictors have been developed, they have shown limited
capability for multi-domain proteins. Our approaches

used in MKA were shown to be effective for multidomain proteins. The two experiments confirmed our
hypothesis that MKA efficiently captures non-local
interaction information while preserving accurate data
modelling in domain-boundary prediction. However, as
its prediction accuracy reaches only about 40% for multidomain and 82% for one-domain proteins, there is still
much room for improvement. Some areas of possible
improvement are discussed in this section.
Non-local interactions in amino acids
As historical summaries have shown [22], many
researchers have built successful secondary structure
predictors using machine learners such as feed-forward
neural networks and support vector machines with local
input windows of 9-15 amino acids [23-26]. Over the
years, the performance has steadily improved by about
one percent per year. This was possible because of
increased training data and several additional techniques
including (1) output filers to cleanup predictions, (2)
input profiles - associated with homologous sequence
alignments and (3) predictor ensembles. The main
weakness of these approaches resides in the researchers’
use of a local window that cannot capture non-local
information such as that presented in b-sheets. This is
partially corroborated because the b-sheet class always
shows the weakest performance results. Substantially
increasing the input window’s size, however, does not
seem to improve the performance. As long as we cannot
fully capture information about the interaction of
remote sequence positions, efficient learning for the
long-range dependencies does not appear possible. The
learner is given only a set of inputs and a serial order
relation for them and must solve a difficult credit
assignment problem to identify the interacting positions.

Our modular kernel approach using HME architecture
consists of comparatively simple experts (specialists
neural) and gating networks, organised in a tree structure
(Figure 1). The basic functional principle behind this
structure is the well-known technique called “divide and
conquer”. This technique solves complex problems by
dividing them into simpler problems for which solutions
can be obtained easily. These partial solutions are then
integrated to yield an overall solution to the whole

problem. Its architecture enforces constant error flow
(thus, neither exploding nor vanishing) through internal
states of units.
Many gradient-based machine learners solve their
classification problem (i.e. function approximation) by
explicitly hard splitting the input space into sub-regions,
such that only one single “expert” is contributing to the
overall output of the model. The “hard splits” of the
input space make algorithms to be variance increasing,
especially in the case of higher dimensional input spaces
where data is very sparsely distributed. In contrast, HME
architecture uses a soft splitting approach to partition the
input space instead of hard splitting, as is the case in
statistical models, allowing the input data to be present
simultaneously in multiple sub-regions. In this case,
many experts may contribute to the overall output of the
network, which has a variance decreasing effect.

Secondary structure information
In the literature, protein secondary-structure information
has been widely used for domain-boundary prediction,
as it was shown to be useful for increasing prediction
accuracy. Most inter-domain regions are composed of
loops while b-strands tend to form sheets that constitute
the core of protein domains. The a-helices and b-sheets
in proteins are relatively rigid units and therefore
domain boundaries rarely split these secondary structure
elements. The mutations at the sequence level can
obscure the similarity between homologs. However,
their secondary-structure patterns remain more conserved because changes at the structural level are less
tolerated. The secondary-structure-alignment methods
used in this study aim to exploit these conserved features
to locate domain regions within secondary-structure
strings. We obtained the secondary-structure information by one of the widely known secondary-structure

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S21

predictors called SSpro [27]. However, there is one
significant limitation: the best predictor still cannot
reach the upper boundary of prediction accuracy. The
best secondary-structure predictors show only about 7580% accuracy. Clearly, the incorrectly predicted secondary structures are highly likely to lead to the incorrect
delineation of domain boundaries. Although the predicted secondary information seems to be useful for
current approaches, it may not be ideal if one attempts to
reach better than 80% accuracy.
Hydrophobicity and profiles
One of the existing powerful methods for rapidly
shifting through protein data is homology modelling,
which uses dynamic-programming-alignment methods
to search evolutionarily related (and hence similar)
sequences in the databases of known sequences. In the
last decade, a number of machine-learning-based systems have used evolutionary profiles that contain
homology information from sequence alignments and
showed striking improvements [17,23-25,28-31]. This
has been a major breakthrough in protein structure
prediction literature [23]. This profiling technique that
provides suitable information for the base algorithm
opened a way on how to effectively incorporate valuable
information into computational structure prediction
models.

For prediction or classification tasks, it is well-known
that finding the right features or information plays key
roles in improving model performance. Our profiling
method based on the assumption that hydrophobicity, a
major factor in protein stability with a suitable homology information can provide better information for its
computational leaner proved to be successful. However,
many more issues need to be investigated, as indicated in
various alignments studies [32-35]. One of the examples
is human intervention in the adjustment of automatic
alignment. As widely believed, domain expert intervention at (1) fold identification and (2) readjustments
multiple alignment levels can significantly improve its
accuracy. In the literature, therefore, research to develop
more biologically realistic profiles has been actively
reported. This should prevent the current limitations of
automated methods by allowing domain experts to
interact with the computation to control the quality of
analysis at processing stages.
Domain assignment is more accurate for proteins with
fewer domains
In general, the prediction accuracy of sequence-based
methods has been far smaller (< 50%) for multi-domain
proteins. For example, Liu and Rost’s [36] experiments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S21

on CATH and SCOP assigned domains to random
subsets of 1187 proteins of known high-resolution
structure and less than 10% sequence homology; they
showed correct prediction of the number of domains
(single and multi) in 69% of the cases. However, the
accuracy for multi-domain cases alone was only 38%.
For the two continuous-domain proteins, the average
accuracy of dbp prediction in different validation runs
was 46-51% considering a prediction to be correct if it
were in ± 20 residues interval of the CATH- and SCOPassigned boundaries.
Joshi [37] discussed the main reasons for the problems
in deciphering the multi-domain-protein structures and
his possible solutions. With experimental data, although
the structure within a domain is fixed, the relative
positioning of two domains within the same chain can
vary. For this reason, and because protein structural
domains are independent folding units, it is unusual to
find single crystal structures containing more than one
domain. Similarly, protein modelling by database
searching, sequence alignment and/or phylogenic analysis is better performed on a single domain rather than a
multi-domain polypeptide. Hence, in most cases, the
number of domains in a protein should first be
identified to determine the locations of such domains
on the primary chain before embarking on a standard
method of protein-structure/function determination.
The identification of linker regions connecting two
distinct domains is also useful in finding domainboundary locations; accordingly, several domain-boundary predictors employing domain-linker information,
such as DomCut and DomainDiscovery, showed reasonably better predictive performance in domain-boundary
prediction.

Continuous vs. discontinuous
Since Wetlaufer [38] introduced the classification of
domains into continuous and discontinuous, a large
number of researches have been done in these separate
fields. Continuous domains form from a single-chain
segment whereas discontinuous domains are composed
of two or more chain segments. The boundary prediction
for discontinuous domains remains very difficult,
especially from ab initio approaches. The most current
and successful ab initio method for predicting discontinuous domains is SnapDRAGON [39]. It is comparably
reliable and as it requires a set of homologous
sequences, similar to the target sequence to generate a
multiple sequence alignment as input. It showed the
accuracy for continuous domains is 63.9% while only
35.4% for discontinuous domains, with an overall
accuracy of 51.8%.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S21

The main reason for poor performance in case of
discontinuous domains appears to be that use of secondary
elements is not appropriate in such cases [40]. A
component of (sequentially) local organisation is partly
an element in the domain but is not sufficient as some
domains are formed from segments of the protein sequence
that are distant in the primary chain. The b-sheet also
influences the definition of a domain since b-sheets are
rarely split into separate domains. However, although one
sheet would not normally be in two domains, two or more
sheets might be in one domain, so again this structural
element does not provide a sufficient definition.
The partitioning of the structure into domains may result
in domains consisting of continuous stretches of
ploypeptide chain, one stretch per domain (continuous
domains). Frequently, however, regions of the polypeptide chain that are distant in sequence, are close together
in 3D structure, thus a domain may consist of two or
more segments of the chain, which are non-continuous
in sequence (discontinuous domains). Our method
simply assigns each domain segment to a separate
domain, ignoring at this time the relatively rare problem
of non-continuous domains.

Conclusion
We have firstly used modular kernel approach (MKA) in
protein domain boundary prediction as a novel method
to effectively tackle the problem of non-local interaction.
Our approach adopted modular HME that leverages
evolutionary and hydrophobicity information in the
form of profiles and also used predicted secondary
structure and relative solvent accessibility. This was
demonstrated in the three consecutive experiments in
this study. The novel EH-profile that combines homology information with hydrophobicity from the SARAH1
scale was successful in providing more structural and
chemical information. In addition, the modular
approach adopted in HME proved to be effective in
capturing information from non-local interactions. Each
memory-based model in HME (Figure 1) showed a
learning ability to bridge time intervals at some level in
the non-local interaction environment (This is the case
of noisy and incompressible input sequences), without
much loss of a short-time-lag capability (the time
interval in the learning process between residues involving non-local interactions). With Benchmark_3 and
CASP8 datasets, our approach showed its usefulness,
especially in the case of multi-domain chains.

neural network for the exploitation of non-local interaction information.
Multi-domain benchmark dataset
Benchmark_3 is a newly developed comprehensive
dataset for benchmarking structure-based domain-identification methods. Benchmark_3 is similar to the dataset
published by Holland et al. [41]; it contains proteins of
known structures for which three methods - e.g. CATH
[42] and SCOP [43] - agree on the assignment of the
number of domains. The dataset consists of 271
polypeptide chains, 106 one-domain chains (39.1%),
108 two-domain chains (39.9%), 45 three-domain
chains (16.6%), 7 four-domain chains (2.6%) and 5
five-domain chains (1.9%). Also, 44 chains were
removed from the Benchmark_2, as the overlap between
the domains was below 90%. The dataset is nonredundant in a structural sense: each combination of topologies occurs only once per dataset. Sequences of protein
chains are taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [44].
The secondary-structure information and solvent accessibility are predicted for each chain in Benchmark_3,
using SSpro [27] and ACCpro [45]. Evolutionary
information for each chain is obtained using the
position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which was
constructed using PSI-BLAST [16].

CASP8 is the latest benchmark dataset in the Critical
Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition. Annually, most of the wellknown domain predictors participate in the CASP
competition. Further information on the available
datasets is at http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/. The
dataset contains 88 single-domain chains and 40
multi-domain chains. For each chain, we obtained
secondary-structure information, solvent accessibility,
PSSM and inter-domain linker index, using the previously mentioned methods.

Methods

Evolutionary and hydrophobicity profile
The existing models of multiple sequence alignments are
generally represented by sequence patterns proving
homology information (e.g. consensus sequences [46]).
This has been regarded as one of the most valuable
information for determining local protein structures. To
construct more informative profile, EH-profile uses one
effective hydrophobicity scale in addition to evolutionary information generated by PSI-BLAST.

Our approach to domain boundary prediction consists
of three consecutive steps. (1) comprehensive multidomain dataset construction for the purpose of

properties for protein structure prediction (such as
polarity, charge or size) [47-49]. Several recent studies
reported that the level of phosphorylation affect protein’s hydrophobicity significantly or vice versa [50,51].
Hydrophobicity is a major factor in protein stability. The
“hydrophobic effect” plays a fundamental role in the
spontaneous folding of proteins. It can be expressed as
the free energy (kilocalories per mole) of transfer of
amino-acid side-chains from cyclohexane to water. The
amino acids with positive values of free energy in
transferring cyclohexane to water are hydrophobic, and
the ones with negative values are hydrophilic [47].
Table 3 shows hydrophobicity scales, and the hydrophobicity matrix can be formulated using the following
function.
Given:
Amino_Acid [] = {C, Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P, S, T, W,
Y, V, ...} and
Hydrophobicity_Index [] = {1.28, -5.54, -6.81, 0.94,
-4.66, 4.92, 4.92, -5.55, 2.35, 2.98, 4.04, -3.40, -2.57,
2.33, -0.14, 4.04, ...},
hydrophobicity _ matrix[i][ j] =

abs(hydrophobicity _ index[i]− hydrophobicity _ index[ j])
20

where the denominator 20 is used to convert the data
range into [0,1].
Hydrophobicity matrix [3,4] means the absolute value of
the difference of the hydrophobicity indices of two
amino acids E (-6.81) and G (0.94). With the range
adjustment, we obtain 0.2935.

superior to all others when used for protein structure
prediction. The Rose scale is correlated to the average
area of buried amino acids in globular proteins
(Table 4). However, Korenberg et al. [54] pointed out
several key drawbacks with Rose scale. Since it is not a
one-to-one mapping, different amino-acid sequences can
have identical hydrophobicity profiles; the scale covers a
narrow range of values while causing some amino acids
to be weighted more heavily than others. To overcome
these problems, the SARAH1 scale - five bits “state”
representation for amino acid - was introduced by
Korenberg et al.
SARAH1 assigns each amino acid a unique five-bit
signed code, where exactly two bits are non-zero.
SARAH1 ranks 20 possible amino acids according to
the Rose hydrophobicity scale (Table 4). Each amino
acid is assigned a five-bit code in descending order of the
binary value of the corresponding code. One of the
benefits of using the five-bit code is that the complexity
of the classifier can be significantly reduced and can
arrange these numbers in 32 possible ways (25 = 32). If
the representations with no or all 1 s, and those with one
or four 1 s are removed, there are exactly 20 representations left. This leaves just enough representation to code
for the 20 amino acids. In the case of window-size 5, a
residue vector has 5 × 11 = 55 dimensions, which leads
to less model complexity than the residue vector using
widely used orthogonal encoding (20 × 11 = 220
dimensions) [55].

In the case of structure/function families and the
classification of protein sequences, various hydrophobicity scales were thoroughly examined by David [52]. He
showed the effectiveness of numerous hydrophobicity
scales, and concluded that the Rose scale [53] was

The resulting scale in Table 5, where the right-half is the
negative mirror image of the left-half, is referred to as
SARAH1. The 10 most hydrophobic residues are positive,
and the 10 least hydrophobic residues are negative.
Korenberg et al. indicated that while the above scales
carry information about hydrophobicity, scales can
similarly be constructed to embed other chemical or
physical properties of the amino acids such as polarity,
charge, a-helical preference, and residue volume.

Non-local interaction and vanishing gradient problem
In protein structure prediction problem, existing large
kernel algorithms such as neural networks have performed well; however, they have also shown several
limitations especially when dealing with non-local
interactions in amino acids. The main difficulty with
this class of neural networks is due to the lack of
generally efficient algorithms for solving numerical
optimisation. In particular, error minimisation is
known to fail in the presence of non-local interactions
[56,57]. Interesting remedies to this vanishing gradient
have been suggested in the literature [58,59]; however,
their effectiveness in realistically large scale supervised
learning tasks has not been elucidated so far.

To overcome this limitation, one should be able to
minimise the problem of the “vanishing gradient”
[56,57]. In the case of non-local-interaction, residues
that are close in space (3D-strucure) occupy distant
positions in the sequence. At each sequence position the
model may receive important structural information
needed at distantly located sequences. Therefore, it must
deal with long-term dependencies, which leads to the
problem of the vanishing gradient. The vanishing
gradient addresses the characteristics of non-chaotic
dynamic systems that the gradient of states with respect
to previous states vanishes exponentially with the
temporal distance between these states. This feature of
non-chaotic systems results from the fact that initial
conditions do not have a large influence over later states.
Therefore, non-chaotic systems are prevented from
learning to store information over time.
A modular approach to neural networks
This new modular approach to neural networks combines
a number of methods and procedures to effectively exploit
non-local information. The first step was to develop a
modular kernel model and train it to predict domain
boundaries of proteins with an EH-profile. Within this
model, each kernel has a learning ability capable of
bridging intervals of time so that even in the case of noisy,

incompressible input sequences, without the loss of a
short-time-lag capability. Its architecture enforces constant error flow (thus, neither exploding nor vanishing)
through internal states of units. Being modular, this
approach requires several small networks to cooperate
and communicate with each other in order to obtain the
complete map of inter-molecular interactions.
These networks are comprised of modules which can be
categorised both according to their distinct structure and
to their functionality, which are integrated together via
an integrating unit. With functional categorisation, each
module is a neural network, which carries out a distinct
identifiable subtask. This approach allows different types
of learning algorithms (these can be neural network
based or otherwise) to be combined in a seamless
fashion. Through the utilisation and integration of the
best-suited learning algorithms for a given task, there is a
distinct improvement in artificial neural network learning. As with other modular learning systems the main
advantages include extendibility, incremental learning,
continuous adaptation, economy of learning and relearning, and computational efficiency.

Hierarchical mixture of experts
This approach incorporates the Hierarchical Mixture of
Experts (HME), a well-known tree-structured model for
regression and classification based on soft probabilistic
splits of the input space [60]. In this model, the
distribution of target variables is given by a mixture of
component distributions in which the components, as
well as the mixing coefficients, are conditioned on the
input variables. The component distributions are
referred to as experts, while mixing coefficients are
controlled by gating distributions. Values for the parameters of this model can be set using an efficient EM
algorithm to predict maximum likelihood [60]. The
resulting model will automatically perform a soft
partitioning of the dataset into groups corresponding
to different regions of input space and simultaneously fit
separate models (corresponding to the mixture components) to each of those groups.

The fundamental concept behind the probabilistic interpretation of this network is that a paralinguistic mapping
of input vectors x(t) to output vectors y(t) in the dataset can
be subdivided into sequence of nested decisions, generating a probabilistic tree. For a particular input vector x(t),
values generated by the gating networks are assumed to be
multinomial probabilities which select one of the
connected expert networks. A sequence of decisions starts
from the top node influenced by the probability distributions of the intermediate gating networks. The process
eventually ends at a specific terminal expert network.

HME describes a conditional probability distribution
over a vector t of target variables, conditioned on a vector
x of inputs (Figure 1). Consider the case of functional
mapping learning of the type Y = f X based on
training data set T = (x(t), y(t)), t = 0, ..., n with
X = { x1 , x 2 ,..., x n } and a corresponding desired response
Y = { y1 , y 2 ,..., y n } . All of the networks, both experts and
gating, receive the same input vector at the tth time instant,
x(t). However, while the gating networks use this input to
compute confidence level values for the outputs of the
connected expert networks, the expert networks themselves use the input to generate an estimate of the desired
output value. The outputs of the gating networks are
scalar values and are a partition of unity at each point in
the input space, i.e. a probability set. Thus, consider the
two-layered binary branching HME as depicted in
Figure 1: Each of the expert neural networks (i, j) produces
outputs yij from the input vector x(t) according to the
relationship:

( )

(

t
y ij = f x ( ) , Wij

)

where f is a neural network mapping using input x(t) and
its corresponding weight matrix Wij . The input vector x(t)
is considered to have an additional constant value to
allow for network bias. The gating networks are generally
linear. Since they perform multi-directional classification
among the expert networks, the non-linear output is
chosen to be a “softmax” (short for soft maximum). The
outputs of the gating network gi at the top level are
computed according to:

gi

eς i
t
with ς i = ViT x ( )
ςk
∑k e

where Vi is the weight matrix associated with gating
network gi. Due to the special form of the softmax being
non-linear, the gi’s are positive and sum up to one for
each input vector x(t). They can be interpreted as the
local conditional probability in that an input vector x(t)
lies in the affiliated partitioned sub-region of the
associated expert network. The lower level gating
networks compute their output activations similar to
the top level gating network according to the following
expression:

g j|i =

e ς ij
T t
with ς ij = Vij x ( )
ς ik
∑k e

The output activations of the expert networks are
weighted by the gating networks’ output activations as
they proceed up the tree to form the overall output

vector. Specifically, the output of the ith internal node in
the second layer of the tree is:

yi =

∑g

j|i y ij

j

while the output at the top level node is:
t
y( ) =

∑g y

i i

i

Since both the expert and the gating networks compute
their activations as functions of the input X , the overall
output of the architecture is a non-linear function of the
input.

Overall architecture
Our modular approach contains three main components. First, given amino-acid sequences, PSI-BLAST was
used to generate PSSMs with an e-value threshold, for
the inclusion of 0.001 and six search iterations of
nonredundant (nr) sequence database. The PSSM has
20 × N elements, where N is the length of the target
sequence, and each element represents the log-likelihood
of a particular residue substitution, based on a weighted
average of BLOSUM62 [61] matrix scores for a given
alignment position in the template. Second, SARAH1
scales were computed from the amino-acid chains in
Benchmark_3 dataset and combined with the PSSM. The
EH-profile, which contains PSSMs and SARAH1 scales,
were all normalised to fall in the interval [-1, 1] using the
following algorithm.

pn = 2 × (p − minp) /(maxp − minp) − 1
where p is R × Q matrix of input vectors, minp is R × 1
vector containing minimums for each p, and maxp is R ×
1 vector containing maximums for each p.
Third, our modular kernel model used the resulting
profile and performed its classification tasks. As discussed, we adopted a sevenfold cross-validation scheme
for its evaluation. With the threshold T, the final
predictions were simulated from the raw output generated by HME. During the post-processing of the network
output, because the network generates raw outputs with
many local peaks, we again adopted Liu and Rost’s [36]
method to filter the raw outputs. First, we determined
the threshold for each network output according to the
length (L) of the protein and to the distribution of raw
output values for all residues in that protein. We
compiled the 92nd percentile of the raw output T1 and
set the threshold T to:

networks; (4) target levels were assigned to each profile (positive, +1, for domain boundary residues and negative, –1, for non-boundary
residues); (5) a hold-out method, to divide the combined dataset into seven subsets (training and testing sets); (6) model training on each
set, to create a model; (7) simulation of each model on the test set, to obtain predicted outputs; and (8) post-processing to find
predicted domain boundary locations. The procedure from (6) to (8) was performed iteratively until we obtained the most suitable
kernel and the optimal hyperparameters for HME for Benchmark_3 dataset.

T was set to the threshold that divides domain boundaries
and others. If the value of a residue was above the
threshold, the residue was regarded as domain boundary.
Second, we assigned the central residue as a domain
boundary if three or more residues were predicted as a
domain boundary. And all parameters for these filters
were developed using the validation set alone.
The performance of our modular approach was measured
by accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Sn) specificity (Sp), correlation
coefficient (Cc), and the fractions of true negative (TNf) and
true positive (TPf). The Sn, Sp, Ac and CC can be expressed
in terms of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true
