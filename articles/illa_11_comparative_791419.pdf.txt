Abstract
Background: Comparative genome mapping studies in Rosaceae have been conducted until now by aligning
genetic maps within the same genus, or closely related genera and using a limited number of common markers.
The growing body of genomics resources and sequence data for both Prunus and Fragaria permits detailed
comparisons between these genera and the recently released Malus × domestica genome sequence.
Results: We generated a comparative analysis using 806 molecular markers that are anchored genetically to the
Prunus and/or Fragaria reference maps, and physically to the Malus genome sequence. Markers in common for
Malus and Prunus, and Malus and Fragaria, respectively were 784 and 148. The correspondence between marker
positions was high and conserved syntenic blocks were identified among the three genera in the Rosaceae. We
reconstructed a proposed ancestral genome for the Rosaceae.
Conclusions: A genome containing nine chromosomes is the most likely candidate for the ancestral Rosaceae
progenitor. The number of chromosomal translocations observed between the three genera investigated was low.
However, the number of inversions identified among Malus and Prunus was much higher than any reported
genome comparisons in plants, suggesting that small inversions have played an important role in the evolution of
these two genera or of the Rosaceae.

Background
Economically, the Rosaceae is one of the most important plant families [1] comprising some 90 genera with
over 3000 distinct species having chromosome numbers
ranging from x = 7 to x = 17 [2]. Four sub-families are
distinguished on the basis of fruit types: the Maloideae
(including Malus, and Pyrus); the Prunoideae (Prunus
and other stone fruit and almonds); the Rosoideae (Fragaria, Rubus, and Rosa); and the Spiraeoideae (containing many ornamental species, including Physocarpus)
[3]. A recent phylogenetic treatment of the Rosaceae
based on DNA sequence data of nuclear and chloroplast
genomic regions reclassified the genus into three subfamilies (the Dryadoideae, the Rosoideae and the

Spiraeoideae), each containing a number of distinct
supertribes [2]. Prunus and Malus are included in the
Spiraeoideae, supertribe Amygdaleae and Pyrodae (tribe
Pyrinae) respectively, whilst Fragaria is included in the
Rosoideae, supertribe Rosodae (tribe Fragariinae). It has
been postulated that the poor phylogenetic resolution
along the backbone of the Rosaceae phylogenetic tree
suggests a rapid evolutionary radiation of lineages within
the family, corresponding to a relatively recent divergence of the genera [2]. Possibly because of the rapid
evolution, members of the Rosaceae display remarkable
phenotypic diversity, with common morphological synapomorphies not readily identifiable. Indeed, plant habit,
chromosome number, and fruit type have all evolved
independently on more than one occasion within the
family [2,4,5]. A better understanding of how the phenotypic diversity within the Rosaceae arose would provide

an insight into how evolution can lead rapidly to
diversification.
Comparative mapping has been carried out in a number of economically important plant families including
the Poaceae, Solanaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae
[6-10]. In the Poaceae, marker order is highly conserved
within syntenic ‘genome blocks’ between genera [8].
However, despite the conservation of syntenic blocks,
grass lineages may rapidly evolve, with high rates of chromosomal ‘reshuffling’ observed between the rye and
wheat genomes [11]. Using restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLPs), Bonierbale et al. [12] studied
the conservation of synteny between potato (Solanum
tuberosum) and tomato (S. lycopersicum syn. Lycopersicon esculentum) and found remarkable conservation of
genome structure, with only a few regions where paracentric chromosomal rearrangements could be identified.
More recently, Wu and Tanksley [13] reported a higher
frequency of inversions than translocations among the
genomes of different genera of the Solanaceae.
In the Brassicaceae, almost complete genome colinearity between Arabidopsis thaliana and Capsella rubella
has been observed, with gene repertoire, order and
orientation highly conserved [14] and likewise, soybean
linkage group A2 was shown to be conserved over its
entire length with Arabidopsis chromosome I, with just
3 rearrangements identified between the chromosomes
of the two species [15]. However, between Arabidopsis
and Brassica oleracea, rates of chromosomal rearrangements were shown to be much higher [16]. Between
dicotyledenous families, comparisons have been performed between much wider evolutionary distances, for
example between Prunus and Arabidopsis [17-19], but
only fragmentary patterns of conserved synteny have
been observed. However, intrafamilial studies have
shown that genome evolution within a family usually
proceeds through whole-scale inversions and translocations between chromosomes, meaning regions in which
marker order is highly conserved can be identified
between genera that diverged millions of years ago, and
thus information on genes within conserved genome
blocks of one genus can inform studies in other genera
within a family.
Comparative genome studies in the Rosaceae have so
far been based on the alignment of genetic maps within
the same genus, or amongst closely related genera, using
small sets of orthologous markers. These studies showed
that the genomes of Prunus species are essentially collinear, for example in peach and apricot [20,21], and
peach and sweet cherry [22,23]. Similarly, within the
Pyrinae tribe, the genomes of Malus, Pyrus and Eriobotrya were shown to be highly collinear [24-26]. Only a
few studies investigated genome comparisons across
Rosaceae tribes or subfamilies. Dirlewanger et al. [27]

compared Malus and Prunus and found strong evidence
that single linkage groups in the diploid Prunus were
homologous to two distinct homeologous linkage groups
in the amphitetraploid genome of Malus. Vilanova et al.
[28] compared the diploid reference linkage maps for
Prunus (T×E; almond ‘Texas’ × peach ‘Earlygold’) and
Fragaria (FV×FN; F. vesca ‘815’ × F. nubicola ’601’) and
they identified numerous chromosomal translocations
and rearrangements that occurred in the 29 million
years since the genera diverged from a common ancestor. They also found clear cases of conservation of chromosomal synteny, and reconstructed a hypothetical
ancestral Rosaceae genome composed of nine
chromosomes.
Whole genome sequencing using next generation
technologies has now become accessible to the broad
scientific community. In the Rosaceae, the genome of
Malus × domestica was recently sequenced using a
whole genome shotgun approach [29]. The analysis of
the draft sequence of ‘Golden Delicious’ is consistent
with a putative nine chromosome diploid ancestor for
the genus [28]. Although there are no published genome
sequences that would permit direct comparisons of the
M. × domestica genome and those of other genera of
the Rosaceae, there are a large number of genetic markers available for Rosaceous species. Recently, Cabrera
et al. [30] reported the development of 857 Rosaceous
Conserved Orthologous Set (RosCOS), of which 613
were mapped on the T×E Prunus reference map.
Because of the conserved nucleotide sequence and low
or single copy presence across species, the COS
sequences are particularly useful for comparative genome studies between related species [30]. The RosCOS
set demonstrated extensive conservation of synteny
between poplar and Prunus, members of two different
plant families in the eurosid clade [30]. Also a significant fraction of the RosCOS markers were transferable
to the FV×FN Fragaria reference population.
In this paper, we compared the apple genome
sequence with conserved molecular markers previously
mapped in Prunus and Fragaria [28,30,31], along with
an additional set of markers developed for the purpose.
The goal was to derive at the ancestral genome structure and organisation of species within the Rosaceae
family and to study the genome evolution of the economically relevant Fragaria, Malus and Prunus. The
locations of molecular markers on the Prunus and Fragaria genomes were determined through bin mapping
[32,33], and their physical positions through analysis of
the Malus × domestica ‘Golden Delicious’ genome [29].
The comparisons identified syntenic blocks common
among the genomes of the three genera as well as
within the polyploid Malus genome. The findings
allowed us to hypothesize about genome evolution

within Rosaceae, and to reconstruct its ancestral genome
for the family.

Results
Mapping of markers in the Prunus T×E bin set

A set of transferable expressed sequence tag (EST)derived markers were developed in this study from consensus Prunus-Malus sequences by aligning all available
Prunus EST sequences (75,404; peach EST database,
[34]) to 1,262 Malus ’Golden Delicious’ gene sequences
with known locations on the M. × domestica consensus
reference map. Of the 155 novel EST-derived markers
screened by PCR over the parents of the T×E population, 126 (81.2%) amplified a single band, five (3.2%)
amplified a length polymorphism between the parents of
the bin set that was scored by agarose gel electrophoresis, 20 (12.9%) gave no amplification product, and the
remaining four (2.4%) produced multiple fragments. Of
the 126 single band markers, those that produced amplicons between 100 and 300 bp (107) were analysed by
high resolution melting (HRM). In total, 60 exhibited a
clear segregation pattern, enabling their localization on
T×E bin map, 17 were monomorphic, and 30 revealed
an ambiguous pattern. The 19 PCR marker products larger than 300 bp, together with the products of 30 markers that produced ambiguous segregation patterns
following HRM analysis, were sequenced directly,
enabling a further 29 polymorphic markers to be
mapped. Thus in total, 94 of the 155 (60.7%) new ESTderived markers were located on the Prunus reference
map (Table S1 in Additional File 1). Their distribution
ranged from one to six markers per bin, and the novel
markers were evenly distributed over the eight linkage
groups of the T×E map. Marker MDP0000144421
revealed a new mapping bin (7:34), however its addition
did not increase the coverage of the T×E map.
Mapping of markers in Fragaria FV×FN bin set

A total of 126 (23%) RosCOS markers bin mapped in
Prunus by Cabrera et al. [30] were located to defined
mapping bins on the FV×FN map. Additionally, results
from 111 markers previously mapped in Fragaria,
Prunus, or in Malus by Vilanova et al. and Sargent et
al. [28,35] were included in the analysis. Markers were
evenly distributed across the seven FV×FN linkage
groups, with 1 - 15 markers located to each bin (Table
S2 in Additional File 2).

queries for GMAP and BLASTN. Of these, 1,013
markers (214 SSRs, 72 RFLPs, 182 EST-derived markers
and 545 RosCOS) showed a high level of DNA sequence
conservation with apple, allowing them to be located to
precise positions on the Malus chromosomes using
GMAP (Table S3 in Additional File 3). In general, a single locus identified in Prunus or Fragaria detected in
Malus either one locus, or two distinct homeologues.
Following the criteria described in Materials and Methods, 806 markers were retained for syntenic analysis. Of
these, 784 were common between Malus and Prunus,
whilst 148 were common between Malus and Fragaria
and 129 were common to all three genomes (Table 1).
Figures 1 and 2 show the relationships between the 806
markers visualized using the Circos program [36].
Figure 1 shows the conservation of synteny between
Malus and Prunus, Figure 2 the conservation of synteny
between Malus and Fragaria, and Figure S1 in Additional File 4 shows the conservation of synteny between
Prunus and Fragaria.
The assignment of collinearity of regions of Malus chromosomes (referred to hereafter as MC) with Prunus and
Fragaria was based on the number of reciprocal translocations or fission/fusion events (which we will refer collectively as translocations) and the number of inversions
which explain the current marker order in Malus
(Table 2). When considering only the common set of
129 syntenic markers, the number of inversions was
three times higher between Fragaria and Malus than
between Prunus and Malus. At least 45 inversions were
needed to place the markers in the same order between
Fragaria and Malus, and 14 between Prunus and Malus.
When compared with syntenic regions of both Fragaria
and Prunus, MC11 and MC7 were characterized by
complete collinearity (lack of inversions), based on markers in common across the three genera. When the 784
markers shared only between Malus and Prunus were
considered, the number of inversions reached 65 across
all MC, almost five times that found with the markers
in common across the three genera (Figure S2 in Additional File 5). However, for MC7 and MC11 the numbers of rearrangements observed remained low, with

which corresponded to those identified by Velasco et al.
[29] on the basis of whole genome sequence information
and reported earlier by Celton et al. [25] on the basis of
SSR mapping. Four fully homeologous pairs of chromosomes were revealed: Malus chromosomes 3 and 11; 5
and 10; 9 and 17; and 13 and 16. More complex relationships between chromosomes 4, 6, 12 and 14; chromosomes 1, 2 and 7; and chromosomes 2, 8 and 15
were evident. Among genera, eleven major syntenic
blocks were common to all three genomes and, in some
cases, conservation of synteny was revealed across whole
chromosomes. Amongst these, homeologous groups
MC13 and MC16 were syntenic to the top of Prunus
linkage group (PG)1 and Fragaria linkage group (FG)4,
and the top of Malus homeologues MC5 and MC10
corresponded to PG4 and FG3.
Reconstructing the ancestral genome of the Rosaceae

A total of 129 markers that mapped to syntenic blocks
common to the marker datasets of the three genera were
used to develop a model for the ancestral genome of the
Rosaceae. The conformation of syntenic blocks shared
among the Fragaria, Malus and Prunus genomes was used
to model a hypothetical ancestral genome with nine

positions of 129 orthologous markers shared by all three genomes. The hypothetical ancestral genome contains nine chromosomes numbered
Ancestral 1 (A1) - A9. Sections of the chromosomes of Malus and the linkage groups of Fragaria and Prunus are coloured according to the
hypothetical ancestral chromosomes. Breakpoints indicating chromosomal fusion-fission events or reciprocal translocations correspond to arrows
between coloured syntenic blocks. Red arrows indicate the positions of major inversions that can be predicted based on the fusion-fission or
translocations detected. Extant chromosome/linkage group lengths assume that all nine hypothetical ancestral chromosomes were of the same
length.

chromosomes (Figure 4). Starting from the ancestral genome and considering only translocation events, the extant
Prunus linkage groups (x = 8) would have experienced
three translocation events, and the Fragaria linkage groups
four translocation events, whilst for the Malus chromosomes (x = 17), seven translocation events, two of which
(a fusion of two major fragments of the two ancestral
chromosomes A1 and A9 to form MC5 and MC10 and of
A8 and A9 to form MC3 and MC11) preceded the whole
genome duplication in apple. Figure 4 depicts the genomes
of Fragaria, Malus and Prunus showing the positions of
major chromosomal translocations necessary to create
their extant genomes starting from the putative nine chromosomes of the ancestral genome. Chromosome/linkage
group lengths are approximated relative to the lengths of
the hypothetical ancestral chromosomes that we assumed
to have a similar length. Colouring of the ancestral chromosomes follows Vilanova et al. [28].

Discussion
We have conducted a comparative analysis between
sequence-characterised molecular markers genetically
anchored to the Prunus and Fragaria reference linkage
maps and the recently published whole genome
sequence of Malus × domestica [29]. In total, 784 Prunus markers meeting the conservation of synteny criteria
described in Material and Methods corresponded to 988
Malus loci. The density distribution of these markers
was higher than in previous studies involving other
families (one marker every 0.65 cM in Prunus corresponding to one locus every 0.76 Mb in Malus, compared to one marker every 1.6 cM in a comparative
analysis between B. napus and A. thaliana, and one
marker every 6.9 cM in a comparison between Capsicum annuum and S. lycopersicum [10,37-42]. The relationships between Fragaria and Malus were based on
fewer markers, which revealed 164 loci on the Malus
genome sequence (one marker every 4.24 cM in Fragaria corresponding to one locus every 3.64 Mb in
Malus). These values, despite being lower than for Prunus, were still within the range of densities employed
for genome comparisons based on linkage maps in species of other families.
The RosCOS markers showed the highest level of
transferability among genomes, with only 4 out of 549
sequences not found in the Malus genome sequence.
This was expected because RosCOS markers have been
developed from genes highly conserved across genomes
that are present as low or single copy genes in Arabidopsis [30]. Transferability from species to species of
EST-derived markers was also high, with 78% of those
tested matching one or two loci in the Malus genome.
A similar value was also observed for RFLPs generated
from cDNA libraries. In contrast, SSRs derived from

Page 8 of 13

genomic regions were less conserved among the three
genomes, as reported in previous studies [43]. While
SSRs have been shown to be transferable between genera in a family, the evolutionary relationship between
target and source genus plays an important role [44].
For example, a higher level of SSR transferability
between Prunus and Malus compared with Fragaria and
Prunus was expected, since Prunus is phylogenetically
closer to Malus than to Fragaria [2]. The results presented in this paper indicate that the majority of genes
are conserved among the three genera investigated,
however that significantly higher divergence was
observed in non-coding regions of the genome than
coding. Correspondence among marker/gene positions
in the three genomes was high in all pair-wise comparisons, with clear conserved syntenic blocks identified
between genera. The 129 markers present in syntenic
blocks and common to all three genomes allowed us to
propose a hypothetical ancestral genome for the Rosaceae consisting of nine chromosomes. Our study considered nearly twice the number of markers used by
Vilanova et al. [28] in an analysis of the FV×FN and
T×E linkage maps. The additional markers revealed an
additional translocation event between the hypothetical
ancestral chromosomes A1 and A3 to create the extant
Fragaria linkage group FG5. The same set of marker
data fully support the findings of Velasco et al. [29],
who postulated an ancestral diploid progenitor for
Malus with a genome containing a chromosome complement of x = 9. Our data also revealed a fusion/fission
event between A1 and A9 during the formation of MC5
and MC10. This occurred before the major whole genome duplication of Malus and thus was not identified in
the analysis of the Malus genome alone.
Whilst an early hypothesis as to the origin of Malus
implied a wide hybridisation between an ancestral amygdaloid (x = 8) and an ancestral spiraeoid (x = 9) [45],
other data suggest that Malus may have arisen due to a
polyploidization of a spiraeoid species [46,47]. The more
recent hypothesis is supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses based on various nuclear encoded genes
[48], and by the comparison between Malus DNA
sequence data and that of various Rosaceae species [29],
which showed that Gillenia (x = 9) was the closest
extant diploid genus to both homeologous genomes of
Malus. Our results indicate that from the four pairs of
homeologous chromosomes entirely conserved in apple,
two pairs, MC3-MC11 and MC5-MC10, were assembled
from unique major fragments of two ancestral chromosomes. This suggests that the translocations that produced them pre-date the duplication within the apple
genome, and were common to the ancestor(s) of apple.
The fact that none of these corresponded to rearrangements found in Prunus indicates that its genome is an

Illa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/9

unlikely ancestor of apple. In all, these results support
the hypothesis that the two genomes that constitute
apple were similar, however distant from Prunus, in
agreement with the hypothesis of a possible origin of
apple as an autotetraploid from a x = 9 genome [29].
Hence, evidence from both previous phylogenetic analyses [48] and the comparative mapping data presented
here supports the hypothesis that a genome containing
nine chromosomes is the most likely most recent ancestral progenitor of the Rosaceae.
Upon pair-wise comparison of each of the three genomes with the ancestral Rosaceae genome (Figure 4), we
found that the number of major chromosomal translocations separating them was four, three and eight
respectively, which is consistent with a relatively uniform rate of translocation, considering that the apple
genome is tetraploid and thus the average number of
estimated translocations per genome is four. When
using the set of 129 markers common to all three genera, including all rearrangements (major and minor,
inversions and translocations) we found that Malus and
Prunus differed by 19 translocations and 14 inversions
(an average of 9.5 translocations and seven inversions
per diploid genome) and Malus and Fragaria by 30
translocations and 45 inversions (15 and 22.5). Nine
translocations and 27 inversions were estimated when
comparing Fragaria and Prunus [28]. The total number
of rearrangements is consistent with genome divergence
[2], with less (an average of 16.5) between Malus and
Prunus and more in the comparisons involving Fragaria
(36-37.5). Our data suggest that the number of inversions (seven for Malus and Prunus and 22 and 27 for
the comparisons involving Fragaria) better estimate the
evolutionary distance between genera than the number
of translocations, as the comparison of inversions
between Fragaria and Prunus yields a smaller number
(9) than predicted based on the other two comparisons.
When we compared the whole set of 784 markers of
Prunus to the Malus genome, the number of translocations identified was the same as when using the 129
markers in common, however the number of inversions
was 65, almost five times higher than that estimated
with fewer markers. As expected, most of these inversions were found in relatively small DNA fragments,
with 71% (46) of them concerning apple genomic fragments ≤ 7.5 Mbp (1% of the Malus genome). Other
explanations could account for errors in this estimate,
such as wrongly-oriented scaffolds in the whole genome
apple sequence, or markers misplaced on the linkage
maps. It seems however unlikely that they can account
for the majority of the inversions observed. When we
re-examined our data and discarded 20 markers that, if
misplaced would have generated one or more spurious
inversions each, we found a more conservative estimate

Page 9 of 13

of 43 inversions (more than three times that of the common set of markers), with 58% of them (25) involving
apple DNA fragments ≤ 7.5 Mbp, still a very large number of inversions. We attribute this high frequency of
inversions to the fact that our comparison is based on
an unusually high average density of markers, allowing
the identification of much smaller inverted regions compared with other plant families. Paterson et al. [49] did
not find such high numbers of inversions in the comparison between the genome sequences of Sorghum
bicolor and Oryza sativa and another comparison
between a map of B. napus with high marker density
(0.63 markers/cM) with the genome of Arabidopsis
(3.67 markers/Mb) allowed the detection of only eight
inversions [39]. A pattern of chromosomal evolution
involving many small inversions has been found in Drosophila [50], suggesting that inversions may be an
important driving force in the evolution of Rosaceae or
at least of the genera investigated, being partly responsible for the high level of phenotypic diversity observed
among members of this family.
Based on data from the comparison of genomes of
various plant families, Paterson et al. [51] showed that
the difference between plant genomes consist of a finite
number of chromosomal rearrangements, and estimated
average frequency of 0.14 chromosomal rearrangements
per Myr of divergence time from a common ancestor.
From our data, this may be a reasonable approximation
for a low/medium resolution level in terms of anchor
points per Mb of the genome; however, in higher resolution analyses, small inversions may completely change
the picture, leading to a variable number of breakpoints
depending on the particular history of the genera being
compared.

Conclusions
We have used markers located to the genomes of Fragaria, Malus and Prunus to conduct the first detailed
family-wide comparative analysis of the Rosaceae. The
high density distribution of markers analysed throughout the genomes of the three genera permitted a
detailed study of the conservation of synteny, comparable to those performed in other plant families, such as
the Solanaceae. Clear syntenic blocks that were conserved across the family were identified, and a hypothetical ancestral genome for the Rosaceae has been
reconstructed using 129 common markers. The
hypothetical ancestral genome contained nine chromosomes and was comparable to hypotheses proposed in
previous studies of Malus, Fragaria and Prunus [28].
Our study revealed novel syntenic relationships that
were not resolved in previous investigations. The number of inversions identified among Malus and Prunus,
based on 784 markers was much higher than that

estimated with fewer markers, and higher than any
reported genome comparisons in plants, suggesting that
small inversions have played an important role in the
evolution of these two genera or of the Rosaceae.

polymorphisms were extended with a 5’ M13F sequence
on the forward primer and products were sequenced
and scored for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
as described by Sargent et al. [56].

Methods

Marker anchoring to the Malus × domestica ‘Golden
Delicious’ genome sequence assembly

Development and bin mapping of novel EST-derived
markers in Prunus

A total of 155 primer pairs were designed from consensus Prunus-Malus sequences for a set of genes that were
well-distributed throughout the 17 Malus linkage
groups, using PRIMER 3 [52] with default parameters
set to give an expected product size from 150-300 bp
with a small number of exceptions. Primers were tested
for amplification in the parents of the Prunus reference
mapping population (T×E) following Troggio et al. [53].
All primer pairs amplifying a single product of 300 bp
or less were used to test for polymorphism between the
parental genotypes and the six plants of the T×E bin set
[32] using HRM analysis methodology [54] as follows.
PCR was performed in a total volume of 10 μl containing 20 ng of template DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 nM
forward and reverse primers and 1× HRM master mix
(Roche Applied Science). Both PCR and HRM were performed on a Roche LightCycler ® 480 (Roche Applied
Science). The PCR parameters used were an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles
of 95°C for 10 s, 57°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 15 s. Following amplification, the samples were heated to 95°C
for 1 min and then cooled to 40°C for 1 min. Melting
curves were generated with continuous fluorescence
acquisition during a final ramp from 65°C to 95°C at
1.1°C/s and the resultant fluorescence data were processed using the LightCycler480 ® software (version
1.5.0.39; Roche Applied Science).
Amplicons greater than 300 bp in length and those
that gave ambiguous results following HRM analysis
were sequenced from the parental genotypes and the
bin set following the methods of Troggio et al. [53].
Sequence data were aligned using SEQUENCER v4.8
(Gene Codes Corporation; Ann Arbor, MI, USA), all
markers were scored in the bin set and their locations
added to the Prunus reference bin map.
Bin mapping of RosCOS markers in Fragaria

Primer pairs for the 549 RosCOS markers [30] that were
successfully anchored to the M. × domestica genome
sequence were screened across the parents of the diploid
Fragaria mapping population FV×FN [28,33] following
the methods of Sargent et al. [55]. Markers that amplified a discrete PCR product were scored in the FV×FN
bin set [33] either following agarose gel electrophoresis,
or capillary electrophoresis as described in Sargent et al.
[55]. Primers which did not reveal visible

The high quality draft genome sequence of M. × domestica ‘Golden Delicious’ [29] was used to locate markers
bin mapped in Fragaria and Prunus, to the Malus genome. Marker sequences were used as queries for GMAP
[57] and as a validation step, BLASTN, using a cut off
E-value of 1e-15.
Identification of chromosomal rearrangements and
determination of syntenic blocks among Malus, Prunus
and Fragaria

Markers showing a high degree of DNA sequence conservation in apple (BLAST E-value < e-15) and that
were located to the ‘Golden Delicious’ genome with
GMAP, together with the novel EST-derived mapped
markers, were used for the conservation of synteny analysis. Syntenic blocks among Malus, Prunus and Fragaria were defined by the following criteria: a syntenic
block should contain a minimum of five (Prunus) or
three (Fragaria) homologous marker loci mapping to
one or two contiguous bins in Prunus and Fragaria, and
located within 3.5 Mbp from each other on the Malus
genome. Markers originally mapped in the full populations of either Prunus or Fragaria, were converted to
bin positions before the analysis. To visualise the relationships between the genomes of the three genera, the
Circos software package was used [36]. As input data
for Circos, the physical positions of markers on the
Malus genome were divided by 4 × 10 5 to obtain a
genetic distance equivalent to marker linkage values of
the Malus consensus map [29]. For the Fragaria and
Prunus bin sets, a genetic distance corresponding to the
mid-point of each mapping bin was considered. Comparisons between Malus and Prunus, Malus and Fragaria, and Fragaria and Prunus were then visualised,
with three linkage groups represented in each ideogram.
The method of Vilanova et al. [28] was used to estimate
the number of chromosomal rearrangements which
occurred among the three genomes since they diverged
from a common ancestor.
Reconstruction of a hypothetical ancestral genome for
Rosaceae

The set of 129 genetic markers located on the genomes
of all three genera were used to define a hypothetical
ancestral genome for the Rosaceae. The positions of
these markers were used to identify homeologous chromosomal regions within the Malus genome, and

Illa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/9

subsequently homologous chromosomal segments on
the Fragaria and Prunus reference maps. We started
with the chromosomal evolution hypothesis of strawberry and peach elaborated by Vilanova et al. [28], modified it with the new data provided by this research, and
then constructed the apple chromosome complement
using the more complete Prunus-Malus comparison
mainly. As we intended to present a simplified view of
the complexity of this comparison, we considered translocated segments as only those that involved large DNA
fragments (i.e. that covered ≥4.41 Mbp of the apple
sequence, equivalent to a 10% of the average apple chromosome 750Mbp*0.10/17 chromosomes). We only
included two inversions, one in strawberry and another
in apple, that were obvious consequences of the major
rearrangements considered in this ancestral genome
reconstruction.
