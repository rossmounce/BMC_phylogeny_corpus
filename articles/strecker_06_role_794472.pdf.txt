Abstract
The Z protein is the matrix protein of arenaviruses and has been identified as the main driving force
for budding. Both LCMV and Lassa virus Z proteins bud from cells in the absence of other viral
proteins as enveloped virus-like particles. Z accumulates near the inner surface of the plasma
membrane where budding takes place. Furthermore, biochemical data have shown that Z is
strongly membrane associated. The primary sequence of Z lacks a typical transmembrane domain
and until now it is not understood by which mechanism Z is able to interact with cellular
membranes. In this report, we analyzed the role of N-terminal myristoylation for the membrane
binding of Lassa virus Z. We show that disruption of the N-terminal myristoylation signal by
substituting the N-terminal glycine with alanine (Z-G2A mutant) resulted in a significant reduction
of Z protein association with cellular membranes. Furthermore, removal of the myristoylation site
resulted in a relocalization of Z from a punctuate distribution to a more diffuse cellular distribution
pattern. Finally, treatment of Lassa virus-infected cells with various myristoylation inhibitors
drastically reduced efficient Lassa virus replication. Our data indicate that myristoylation of Z is
critical for its binding ability to lipid membranes and thus, for effective virus budding.

Background
Lassa virus (LASV) belongs of the family of Arenaviridae.
Based on phylogenetical, serological, and geographical
findings, this family can be subdivided into two groups:
The Old World group includes the prototype of this family, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as
well as Lassa virus. The New World group (also known as
Tacaribe complex) includes other important human pathogens like Machupo virus, Junin virus, Guanarito virus
and Sabia virus which are responsible for hemorrhagic

fever outbreaks in South American countries. LASV is the
causative agent of human Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic
fever disease that is endemic in certain countries of West
Africa. As a potential bioterrorism threat and due to the
lack of an effective, safe therapy, Lassa virus has emerged
as a worldwide concern.
Lassa virus is an enveloped virus that contains a bi-segmented single-stranded RNA genome. Each RNA segment
encodes two viral genes in an ambisense coding strategy

separated by an intergenic region. The small RNA (S-RNA)
segment encodes the nucleoprotein NP and the glycoprotein precursor preGP-C which undergoes co- and posttranslational cleavage events in order to obtain its mature
form [1-5]. The large RNA (L-RNA) segment encodes the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L and the Z protein
[6,7].
Although the information available so far indicates multiple functions of Z, the role of Z during different stages in
the arenavirus life cycle is still poorly understood. Several
cellular factors have been described to interact with Z, e.g.
the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), the nuclear
fraction of the ribosomal protein P0, and the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E. However, the biological
role of these interactions still remains largely unknown
[8-10]. Z also exhibits a dose-dependent inhibitory effect
on RNA synthesis, and cells expressing the Z protein are
resistant to LCMV and Lassa virus infection [11,12]. In
addition to its multifunctional regulatory role in the arenavirus life cycle, Z is also a structural component of the
virus particle [13]. It has been shown that Z is the arenavirus counterpart to matrix proteins found in other negative-stranded RNA viruses [14,15]. In Lassa virus-infected
cells, Z is mainly localized at the inner surface of the
plasma membrane. Z protein of Lassa virus interacts with
lipid membranes and can form enveloped particles that
are similar in diameter and morphology to those particles
released from Lassa virus-infected cells [15,16]. Furthermore, using biochemical methods we demonstrated that
Z is highly membrane-associated. Membrane-detachment
studies of Z revealed that treatment with chaotropic
agents which characteristically remove most peripheral
membrane proteins, had no effect on the association of Z
with membranes [15]. The nature of this tight membrane
interaction is still unknown since Z is lacking a characteristic hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Alignment of
the amino acid sequences of several Z proteins revealed
the presence of a putative myristoylation site at the glycine
position 2 in context of a potential myristoylation signal
motif that is highly conserved among New and Old World
arenavirus Z proteins (Fig. 1). It has been shown recently
that both LCMV and LASV Z are targets for attachment of
myristic acid [17]. Mutation of the glycine at position 2,
thereby disrupting the myristoylation signal prevented the
incorporation of myristic acid. As a consequence Z-mediated budding activity was impaired [17]. Further evidence
of the importance of myristoylation in arenavirus budding was provided by studies of Cordo et al. [18] showing
that treatment with myristic acid analogs inhibited the
replication of the New World arenaviruses Junin and
Tacaribe. Thus, myristoylation of arenavirus proteins
seems to be a crucial modification necessary for efficient
virus replication.

N-myristoylation is a co-translational event in which myristate (a 14-carbon fatty acid) is covalently attached to an
N-terminal glycine. This reaction is catalyzed by the
enzyme N-myristoyl transferase (NMT) using myristoylCoA as a substrate upon removal of the initiator methionine by a methionine aminopeptidase [19]. N-myristoylation is a common lipid modification of proteins in
eukaryotes and essential for the function of proteins
involved in many cellular pathways of signal transduction, apoptosis and oncogenesis [20-24]. In addition, an
increasing number of viral and bacterial proteins have
been also reported to be myristoylated [25-27]. Modification of viral proteins by myristic acid plays an important
role at different stages of the virus life cycle [28-36]. Nmyristoylation can influence protein-protein interaction
and the conformational stability of proteins as well as
mediating membrane targeting and binding [22].
In this study, we investigated the contribution of N-myristoylation to the membrane binding ability of the Lassa
virus Z protein. We demonstrate that myristoylation is
required for efficient binding of Z to cellular membranes.
Using a flotation assay we show that the mutant Z-G2A in
which the amino-terminal glycine residue was changed to
alanine exhibited a strongly reduced membrane binding
affinity compared to wild-type Z protein. As a consequence, the budding activity of this mutant was impaired.
Interestingly, the removal of myristic acid also affected the
cellular localization of Z indicating that myristoylation is
important for Z targeting to specific cellular regions.
Finally, treatment of LASV-infected cells with myristoylation inhibitors resulted in significant decrease of LASV
particle release. Our data indicate that myristoylation of Z
is critical for its binding ability to lipid membranes and
thus, for effective virus budding.

Results
Myristoylation of Z is not required for stability
In addition to its role in membrane anchoring, myristoylation was also reported to contribute to the stability of
proteins [37]. To compare the stability of wild-type Z and
a non-myristoylated mutant, we constructed a mutant,
designated Z-G2A, in which the glycine at position 2 was
exchanged to alanine (Fig. 1). This mutation disrupts the
myristic acid attachment site and does not allow incorporation of myristic acid [17]. To address whether the
removal of myristic acid affects the stability of Z and therefore undergoes faster degradation, we performed pulsechase experiments of Z-G2A and Z-WT for up to 5 h. As
shown in Fig. 2, both Z-WT and Z-G2A were expressed to
similar levels and no significant change in the stability
was observed. Therefore, we conclude that the removal of
the myristic acid has no effect on the overall stability of Z
and, thus, the myristoyl group in Z is not involved in
intramolecular stabilization. Interestingly, a second band

was observed in the Z-G2A construct which appeared with
a molecular mass slightly higher than the main band.
However, the identity of this band remains to be determined.
Myristoylation mediates efficient membrane association
of Z
We have previously shown that solitary expressed Z has an
intrinsic membrane-binding capacity [15]. Up to now the
mechanism by which Z interacts with cellular membranes
is still unknown. However, myristic acid attachment has
been shown to play an important role in plasma membrane targeting and binding [36,38,39]. Thus, we wanted
to investigate the role of myristoylation in the ability of Z
to bind to lipid membranes. We performed membrane
flotation analysis of the Z-G2A mutant in comparison to
wild-type Z protein as described previously [15]. Huh7
cells expressing either Z-WT or Z-G2A were disrupted and
the post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to flotation.
Cellular membranes and membrane-associated proteins
float to the OptiPrep-TNE interface during ultracentrifugation whereas soluble proteins remain at the bottom.
Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western Blotting.

As described before, wild-type Z efficiently floated into
the interface between 30% OptiPrep and TNE (fraction 1)
showing that the Z protein is associated with cellular
membranes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the exchange of glycine
to alanine at position 2 resulted in a clear shift of a major
fraction of Z-G2A from a membrane to a cytosolic localization. Thus, we conclude that myristoylation contributes
to efficient membrane binding of Z.
Mutation of the glycine at position 2 is critical for LASV Zdriven VLP formation
For a number of viruses it has been shown that stable association of viral proteins with cellular membranes is
required for virus assembly and production of virus particles. Lassa virus Z protein is sufficient to drive the release
of Z containing VLPs that are surrounded by a lipid envelope [15]. Therefore we analyzed whether membrane
binding through myristoylation is a prerequisite for Zinduced budding. To test this, supernatants of Huh7 cells
expressing Z-WT or Z-G2A were subjected to ultracentrifugation (UC) through a 20% sucrose cushion. The UCpelleted VLPs and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting using Z-specific antisera. As
shown in Fig. 3B, the amount of Z released into the super-

decreased compared to wild-type Z although proteins
were expressed at comparable levels. Thus, consistent with
the report of Perez et al. [17] mutation of the glycine at

important prerequisite to fulfill its budding function.

be accumulated in the perinuclear region. (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with Vero cells expressing Z-WT
in the presence of the myristoylation inhibitor 2 OHM
(Fig. 4C). Our data suggest that punctuate structures targeted by myristoylated Z represent cellular regions important for assembly and budding.

Z-G2A mutant exhibits altered cellular localization
Next, we wanted to determine whether the loss of myristoylation affects the subcellular localization of Z. Therefore, we performed indirect immunofluorescence
microscopic analysis in order to determine the cellular
distribution of Z-G2A and Z-WT in the presence of the
myristoylation inhibitor DL-2-hydroxymyristic acid (2
OHM), an inhibitor of N-myristoyltransferase. Consistent
with our previous data, wild-type Z was distributed in a
punctuate fashion throughout the cytoplasm including
localization at the plasma membrane as well as the perinuclear region (Fig. 4A). In contrast, cells expressing the
non-myristoylated Z-G2A mutant showed a much more

Inhibition of LASV replication by blocking myristoylation
Inhibitors of myristoylation have been reported to inhibit
the replication of a wide range of viruses including the
Old and New World arenaviruses LCMV and Junin,
respectively [17,18,29,31,40-42]. However the impact of
blocking myristoylation on LASV replication has not been
addressed yet. Therefore we assessed the inhibitory effect
of DL-2-hydroxymyristic acid (2 OHM), 13-oxamyristic
acid (13 OM) and 4-oxatetradecanoic acid on the multiplication of LASV. Vero cells were infected with LASV and
1 hour post-adsorption, cells were either treated with myristoylation inhibitors at indicated concentrations or left
untreated. After 48 hours, supernatants were harvested

and virus yields were measured by defining the 50% tissue
culture infectious dose (TCID50). In the presence of myristoylation inhibitors a significant reduction in virus titers
was observed compared to untreated LASV-infected cells
indicating that myristoylation plays an important role in
the life cycle of LASV (Fig. 5A). DL-2-hydroxymyristic acid
and 13-oxamyristic acid exhibited similar effects and
reduced virus production up to 3 log10 at a final concentration of 100 µM. 4-oxatetradecanoic acid was found to
be less active but still able to reduce virus release up to 2

log10 compared to untreated infected cells. In order to
investigate the effect of blocking myristoylation on virus
particle release, cell lysates and supernatants of infected
cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

Similar results were observed for DL-2-hydroxymyristic
acid and 4-oxatetradecanoic acid (data not shown). Taken
together, our data clearly demonstrate that myristoylation
is important for efficient LASV assembly and virus particle
release.

Discussion
In the present report, we analyzed the role of N-myristoylation for the membrane binding properties of LASV Z
and its function during virus release. We created a mutant
(Z-G2A) that has been shown to fail the incorporation of
myristic acid [17] to demonstrate that in the absence of
the myristoyl moiety, Z was not efficiently associated with
membranes. These results are in agreement with reports
for other proteins showing that N-myristoylation is
important for membrane binding [36,38,39]. Although
the disruption of the myristoylation motif resulted in a
clear shift of Z from the membrane to the cytosolic fraction, a minor fraction of Z was still found to be associated
with membranes indicating that additional factors might
be involved in membrane binding. It is known that many
myristoylated proteins like the transforming protein
pp60v-src of Rous sarcoma virus or the HIV gag and nef
proteins need a cluster of basic amino acids close to the
myristoylation site for efficient membrane binding [4345]. This "myristate plus basic" motif synergizes hydrophobic and electrostatic forces resulting in strong membrane binding. Interestingly, LASV Z contains basic amino
acids downstream of the myristoylated glycine residue
(Myr-GNKQAKAPESKDSPR...) which show some similarity to those present in the N-terminus of the transforming
protein pp60v-src (Myr-GSSKSKPKDPSQR...) of Rous sarcoma virus. The role of basic amino acids and/or additional hydrophobic sequences within Z for membrane
binding is currently under investigation. However, the
glycine to alanine exchange was sufficient enough to significantly reduce the release of Z-mediated VLPs. These
results are in line with data published by Perez et al. [17]
showing that mutation of the glycine at position 2 is critical for VLP formation. Our data suggest that assembly
and budding of Lassa virus requires membrane binding of
Z to which the myristoyl moiety greatly contributes.
N-terminal myristoylation of LASV Z is not only important for efficient membrane binding but also participate
in targeting Z to specific cellular regions. Unlike wild-type
Z, the non-myristoylated mutant Z-G2A shows a diffuse
distribution pattern throughout the cytoplasm and accumulates in the perinuclear region. The change from a
punctuate staining for wild-type to a diffuse cellular distribution for a non-myristoylated mutant has also been
described for HIV-1 gag [46]. Our results suggest myristoylation-mediated targeting of Z to specific cellular
regions that are important for efficient LASV budding.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/93

The data presented in this work as well as results described
by Perez et al. [17] demonstrate that myristoylation of Z
plays a key role in arenavirus budding. Treatment of LASV
with myristoylation inhibitors resulted in drastic reduction of infectious virus particle production. Although we
have shown that myristoylation is crucial for the correct
function of Z, it cannot be excluded that other LASV proteins might require myristoylation for their function during virus replication. For the glycoprotein GP of the New
world arenavirus Junin virus it was recently shown that its
signal peptide is myristoylated and mutation of this myristoylation motif resulted in reduced membrane fusion
activity of GP [47]. Similar results were observed for LASV
GP (T. Strecker, unpublished results). Thus, myristoylation inhibitors might target multiple arenaviral proteins
and therefore may have the potential to serve as an antiviral drug against Lassa virus and other arenaviruses causing
hemorrhagic fever in humans.

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that N-myristoylation of LASV Z
plays an important role in both targeting to and association with specific cellular membranes that are important
for assembly and budding.

Materials and methods
Cell cultures and viruses
Human hepatoma (Huh7) cells and green monkey kidney
(VeroE6) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin. Lassa virus, strain Josiah, was grown on
VeroE6 and Huh7 cells, respectively. Infection with Lassa
virus was carried out at a MOI of 0.1. All experiments performed with Lassa virus were done under biosafety level 4
biocontainment conditions at the Institute of Virology in
Marburg, Germany.
Molecular cloning and vectorial expression
The open reading frame of Lassa virus Z protein (Lassa
virus strain Josiah) was expressed using the pCAGGS vector as described previously [15]. The Z myristoylation
mutant, designated Z-G2A, in which the glycine at position 2 was exchanged to alanine was generated by standard PCR techniques. A list of the respective
oligonucleotides will be made available on request. The
accuracy of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Huh7 and VeroE6 cells were transfected with wild
type and mutated recombinant DNA using Lipofectamine
2000 (Gibco/Invitrogen).
Antibodies and reagents
Antisera against GP-C, NP and Z protein were raised by
immunization of rabbits as described previously [5,48].
Anti-beta actin antibody was purchased from Abcam

(UK). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horse radish
peroxidase were purchased from DAKO (USA). Secondary
antibodies labelled with Alexa680 (700 nm) were from
Molecular Probes™ Invitrogen (Germany) and were used
for visualization of proteins using Odyssey™ Infrared
Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). Myristic acid inhibitors DL-2-hydroxymyristic acid (2 OHM), 13-oxamyristic
acid (13 OM) and 4-oxatetradecanoic acid (4 OXA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Stock solutions were prepared in ethanol at 10 mM.
Acrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% or 15%
polyacrylamide gels as described previously [15]. Immunoblotting was performed as described earlier [49].
Pulse-chase experiments and immunoprecipitation
Plasmid-transfected Huh7 cells were starved 24 h posttransfection for 1 h with DMEM lacking methionine and
cysteine, before cells were labeled with 100 µCi/ml [35S]
methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham). After a 30 min
pulse, radioactive medium was replaced by fresh DMEM
and cells were chased for different time intervals as indicated. Cells were lysed in Co-IP buffer (1% NP-40, 0.4%
deoxycholate (DOC), 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mM iodacetamide, 1 mM PMSF).
Nuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm and 4°C. Immunoprecipitation of pro-

teins was performed using protein A-Sepharose-coupled
rabbit anti-Z antibodies. Precipitated immunocomplexes
were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by
autoradiography on BioMax films (Kodak).
Flotation experiments
Flotation experiments were carried out as described previously [15]. Briefly, Z-expressing Huh7 cells were harvested
and disrupted in a hypotonic Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.4]) by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer on ice.
Nuclei and cell debris were removed from the cell lysate
by low centrifugation at 4°C. OptiPrep (Sigma) was
added to the postnuclear supernatant to a final concentration of 35% in a total volume of 500 µl, which was placed
at the bottom of a Beckmann-SW60 centrifuge tube. It was
overlaid with 3.5 ml of 30% OptiPrep and then with 200
µl of TNE buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA). All OptiPrep solutions were prepared
in TNE containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche). The gradient was centrifuged to equilibrium at 52 000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C. Fractions were
collected from the top, subjected SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting.
Generation of Z-induced virus-like particles (VLP)
To generate VLPs, Vero cells were transfected with Lassa
virus Z Protein. After 48 h, supernatants cleared from cell
debris were laid on a 20% sucrose cushion and ultracen-

trifuged in a SW-60 rotor at 52 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 h. The
pellet was then resuspended in PBS (phosphate-buffered
saline) buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Immunocytochemistry
Vero cells were grown on coverslips and Lipofectaminetransfected with appropriate plasmid constructs for protein expression. 24 hours after transfection, cells were
washed and incubated for 5 min with acetone/methanol
(1:1 v/v) for fixation and total permeabilization of membranes. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated for
1 h with 1:100 diluted primary rabbit antibodies followed
by incubation for 45 min with 1:100 diluted anti-rabbit
antibody from goat coupled to FITC (Dianova, Germany).
Protein expression of cells was examined using an
immunofluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss, Germany).
Treatment of LASV-infected cells with myristoylation
inhibitors
VeroE6 cells were grown to 80% confluence and infected
with LASV at a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. 1 hour post-adsorption, cells were either treated with different concentrations of DL-2-hydroxymyristic acid (2 OHM), 13oxamyristic acid (13 OM) or 4-oxatetradecanoic acid (4
OXA) or left untreated. After 48 hours, cells and supernatants were collected. Virus titration was performed by
defining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50).
For this, the supernatants were diluted 5-fold and the dilutions were used to infect VeroE6 cells in 96-well plates
(four wells for each dilution). The cultures were scored
periodically for cytopathic effect over a period of 7 days.
The endpoint virus titers for culture supernatants were calculated with the method of Reed and Muench. Viral titers
were expressed as the log10 of the 50% titration endpoint
for infectivity as calculated by the methods of Karber and
Spearman. In addition, the amount of viral proteins
released into the supernatant in the presence or absence of
myristic acid inhibitors was analyzed by immunoblotting.
Therefore, cell lysates and supernatants that were ultracentrifuged as described above were collected and lysed in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer.
