Abstract
Background: Social wasps in the subfamily Polistinae (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) have been
important in studies of the evolution of sociality, kin selection, and within colony conflicts of
interest. These studies have generally been conducted within species, because a resolved phylogeny
among species is lacking. We used nuclear DNA microsatellite flanking sequences, mitochondrial
COI sequence, and morphological characters to generate a phylogeny for the Polistinae
(Hymenoptera) using 69 species.
Results: Our phylogeny is largely concordant with previous phylogenies at higher levels, and is
more resolved at the species level. Our results support the monophyly of the New World
subgenera of Polistini, while the Old World subgenera are a paraphyletic group. All genera for
which we had more than one exemplar were supported as monophyletic except Polybia which is
not resolved, and may be paraphyletic.
Conclusion: The combination of DNA sequences from flanks of microsatellite repeats with
mtCOI sequences and morphological characters proved to be useful characters establishing
relationships among the different subgenera and species of the Polistini. This is the first detailed
hypothesis for the species of this important group.

Background
A robust phylogenetic tree is of paramount importance as
a beginning point for many kinds of evolutionary studies
[1-4]. Understanding the evolutionary history of a character can allow us to tease apart factors important for adaptation to a specific environmental condition from those
due to history [5,6]. However, obtaining accurate phylogenetic relationships can sometimes be difficult. Historically, morphological traits were used in combination with

the principles of cladistics [7,8] to elucidate phylogenetic
relationships. Morphological traits require specialists who
can detect sometimes minute differences between species,
and such expertise requires years of training.
Nucleic acid sequence information, primarily from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has allowed us to make enormous strides towards resolving phylogenies during the
last twenty years [9-15]. But these sequence regions have

the disadvantage that they are often not evolving at ideal
rates to reveal histories of desired traits. The branching
pattern of gene trees and species trees are not necessarily
overlapping in time and proceed concurrently. Also, evolution of mtDNA genes might not necessarily correspond
to the speciation process [4]. Mitochondrial DNA genes
are essentially single linkage groups and might not reveal
the actual whole organism phylogeny [16,17].
For nearly as long as sequence data have been available,
there has been a heated debate about which kinds of data,
molecular or morphological, provide the most accurate
result when topologies obtained from different data sets
are in conflict. Molecular data are undoubtedly considered by many to be more reliable than morphology (i.e.,
more likely to produce a "true" tree, e.g. [18]). It is clear
that the perception of morphological data as inferior to
molecular data also extends to value judgments on the
quality of a particular morphological analysis based on
how well the results of that analysis conform to the results
of molecular analyses (e.g. [19]). Such standards are usually not applied to independent molecular analyses,
which are also often in conflict with each other (e.g. [20]).
No single particular data set may completely conform
with our best estimate based on total evidence. The best
estimator for a species phylogeny might therefore not necessarily depend on the sole use of one set of characters
(morphological or molecular), but on a combination of
different characters that can prove to be a better estimator
of species trees [8,13,21-24].
Nuclear markers are independent from mitochondrial
markers, and can be independent from each other if they
are scattered through the genome. Nuclear genes represent
a largely untouched resource for molecular systematics
[25]. However, few nuclear genes, besides some rDNA
sequences, have been used in phylogenetic studies [26].
The earliest molecular studies in Hymenoptera focused
almost entirely on mitochontrial 16S rDNA [27-32]. More
recently, the nuclear 28S rDNA gene has been used successfully for analyses of relationships within superfamilies, but with less success at higher taxonomic levels
[33-36]. It has also been applied to social wasps [37], but
its use is controversial [38]. Microsatellite loci are abundant, single copy, and widely distributed throughout the
genome [39-41]. Few studies have used microsatellites to
reconstruct phylogenies although they have been widely
used for population genetic studies (e. g. [42-46]).
Though their sequences are short and the repeat regions
themselves are highly variable, sequence information
from several microsatellite flanking regions can be combined for robust, informative and easily aligned characters
that can help resolve difficult phylogenetic relationships.
The single copy flanking sequences are much less variable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/8

than are numbers of repeats themselves, making them
easier to align.
Here we present a phylogeny for a very important group
of social wasps. Social insects of the order Hymenoptera
constitute a highly diverged group, with cosmopolitan
distributions. Because of the existence of different castes,
division of labor, altruism, and a haplodiploid genetic
system, these social insects represent a unique system to
study kin selection [47-50]. The subfamily Polistinae
(paper wasps) is the second largest of six subfamilies of
the family Vespidae, and is entirely composed of social
wasps. It is made up of four tribes (Polistini, Epiponini,
Mischocyttarini and Ropalidiini), with 943 species ([51],
unpublished). This group probably arose in the mid- to
late Jurassic. Carpenter [51] has estimated that this group
diverged from other Vespidae at the breakup of Gondwana, as much as 140 million years ago. A molecular
study, which used microsatellite loci to establish the conservation and polymorphisms across different species of
this subfamily, discovered interesting results for divergence times among species [52]. The divergence time for
Polistes bellicosus and P. annularis was estimated to be
between 10 to 80 million years. The divergence time for
the entire tribe is larger than among the species of the
genus Polistes and smaller than for the subfamilies of
Vespidae (between 80 and 175 million years), and
Vespinae and Polistinae probably split in the Mid Jurassic
[52]. The tribe Polistini is the only one with a cosmopolitan distribution (Table 1). The genus Polistes was formerly
subdivided into 12 different subgenera, either distributed
in the New World (Fuscopolistes, Aphanilopterus, Palisotius,
Epicnemius, Onerarius) or Old World (Gyrostoma, Stenopolistes, Nygmopolistes, Megapolistes, Polistella, Sulcopolistes
and Polistes sensu stricto). More recently, seven of these
subgenera have been synonymized [53], with one subgenus for the New World species (Aphanilopterus) and three
for the Old World species (Gyrostoma, Polistella and Polistes
sensu stricto). The New World subgenera were synonymized because two were found to be paraphyletic, a
result not supported by the present study. The other three
tribes, on the other hand, are either distributed in the New
World (Epiponini, Mischocyttarini) or the Old World
(Ropalidiini).
The subfamily Polistinae is characterized by two major
behavioral groups, based on their mode of colony founding and mechanism of reproductive dominance [54,55].
Independent founding is characterized by small, simply
constructed nests without a protective paper envelope,
founded by a single queen or few queens, without the
assistance of workers [56,57]. By contrast, swarm founding species have large colonies initiated by swarms consisting of multiple queens and a large number of workers
[55].

The independent-founding group is made up of five genera: Polistes, Mischocyttarus, Belonogaster, Parapolybia, and
some species of Ropalidia. Colonies are initiated by one or
several inseminated egg-layers and no workers. Egg layers
go through a solitary phase after insemination (few days
to months). Soon after nest initiation, one fertilized
female becomes the sole egg-layer. These groups of species
are characterized by small colony sizes (rarely more than
50 adult wasps) and the lack of a protective envelope on
the nest [56,58,59]. Reproductive dominance in this
group is at least partly maintained through aggression by
the queen.
The swarm-founding group is made up of 20 genera of the
tribe Epiponini, the genus Polybioides, and some Ropalidia
species. Colonies are initiated by a large number of workers and a small number of egg-layers. There is no colony
phase without workers. Workers choose the site and built
the nest while egg-layers wait. Swarm founding wasps
characteristically have large colony sizes (usually over 50
adult wasps), and nests are often provided with a protective envelope. Reproductive dominance in this group is
obtained through worker aggression on potential queens,
and there is a tendency towards morphological castes in
some but not most species [50,55].
Many behavioral, ecological and evolutionary questions
in this group could be asked in a phylogenetic framework
including characteristics of nest structure [5,60,61], reproductive strategies [62-64], and solutions to potential conflicts of interest among colony members [57,65,66].
For the present study, we used a combination of nuclear
(three microsatellite loci flanking regions and a coding
system generated by the different repeat motifs, with
priming sites largely conserved throughout the Polistinae
subfamily; [52], adult morphological [2,53,67], larval
[68-76], behavioral [77] and mitochondrial (COI) characters to obtain a better understanding of the relationships
in this group. A study by Zhu et al. [78] used a subset of
the characters and species presented in this study. The use

of these characters was to reconstruct the evolution of
microsatellite repeats within the Polistinae subfamily. For
the completion of that study, the best tentative tree available at that time was used in order to establish the evolution of these microsatellite repeats in an explicitly
phylogenetic perspective.
With this study we investigate two phylogenetic hypotheses. First, we wanted to test whether or not the subgenera
of Polistes of Richards [79] are monophyletic. For this, we
used 33 species of Polistes and 36 species in the outgroup,
the Epiponini, Ropalidiini and Mischocyttarini. Second,
we evaluated the phylogenetic relationships within and
among the other three Polistinae tribes, Epiponini,
Ropalidiini and Mischocyttarini, using the 33 species of
the tribe Polistini as an outgroup.

Results
Polistini
Morphological characters alone showed little resolution
in the Polistini at the species level, instead supporting
most of the subgenera as monophyletic – but not all (Fig.
1). New World species as a whole were monophyletic with
a bootstrap support of 75% while Old World species were
paraphyletic. Of the subgenera, Polistes sensu stricto, Megapolistes, Polistella, Epicnemius and Fuscopolistes were all supported as monophyletic with bootstraps of 64%, 95%,
74%, 63% and 61% respectively. But there was no resolution within these groups, and Aphanilopterus was not
resolved as a group.

The COI, and microsatellite combined characters supported the subgenera Megapolistes, Fuscopolistes, and Aphanilopterus with bootstraps of 93%, 93%, and 70%
respectively (Figure 2). Both Polistella and Polistes sensu
stricto were mostly supported at 50% and 66%, but each
left out one species. There was also considerable resolution within the supported subgenera. Thus, the independent molecular and morphological trees offered resolution
in both different and overlapping parts of the tree and,
where they were resolved, were not in conflict.

support. Although the support for this same clade was
75% in the morphological characters tree (Fig. 1), the
combined tree provides a much more resolved phylogeny
at the species level. The clade for the Old World Polistes is
paraphyletic. All the subgenera for which we have 2 or
more exemplars are supported. The Old World subgenera,
Megapolistes, Polistella, and Polistes sensu stricto are supported with bootstraps of 99%, 93% and 92% respectively. The New World subgenera, Fuscopolistes,
Aphanilopterus and Epicnemius are supported with bootstraps of 99%, 96% and 70% respectively.
Epiponini, Mischocyttarini, Ropalidiini
Morphological characters alone supported the Old World
Ropalidiini and the New World Epiponini and Mischocyttarini with bootstraps of 64%, 85% and 91% respectively
(Figure 4). All of the genera for which we had more than
one species were also supported except for Polybia. There
was little resolution within genera except for Brachygastra.
However most genera were only represented by a few
species.

The combined COI and microsatellite characters were
largely uninformative on their own, though there was
some grouping of epiponine species and resolution
within the monophyletic Mischocyttarus (Figure 5).
The combined tree is much more resolved than either separate analysis, and bootstrap supports are greater (Figure
6). Monophyly of Ropalidiini, Mischocyttarini, and
Epiponini is supported at bootstrap levels of 83%, 95%,
and 90% respectively. However the relationships between
the tribes are not resolved. All genera for which we have
more than one species are supported except for Polybia
which is broken into three groups, among which relationships are not resolved (Figure 6). Relationships among
genera within Ropalidiini and Epiponini are generally not
well resolved. The basal genus of the Epiponini is
unresolved.

Discussion
Relationships in the Polistini
The combined character phylogeny is partly congruent
with the earlier phylogeny proposed by Carpenter in
1996, though there are some differences (Figure 7). First,
note that the earlier tree is not bootstrapped; Figure 1 is
the bootstrapped tree for morphological characters, based
on the present sample of species. Results from both studies on the monophyletic origin of the New and Old World
Polistini subgenera only found support for the monophyletic origin of the New World Polistini (Fig. 3). In both
studies, the Old World Polistini subgenera represent a
paraphyletic group. However, the present study showed
Polistes sensu stricto as the most basal subgenus (with a
bootstrap support of 98%), in contrast to Carpenter [53],
where it was the sister group of the New World subgenera
(with a bootstrap support of 89%, Fig. 7). The present
study found the sister group of the New World subgenera

to be the clade of Polistella, Nygmopolistes, and Megapolistes.
Several subgenera were absent from the present study (viz.
Gyrostoma, Stenopolistes and Sulcopolistes) and it is possible
that their absence affected character polarizations
obtained within Polistes.
In contrast to Carpenter's [53] study, the present results
support monophyly of the subgenus Aphanilopterus in the
strict sense, and of the subgenus Epicnemius, albeit based
on a smaller number of species.
Polistes sensu stricto is unique in the Polistinae for having
social parasites, species that kill their host queen so her
workers can rear the brood of the social parasite [12,8082]. The three social parasite species are monophyletic
and most closely related to P. nimphus and P. dominulus,
and less close to P. gallicus and P. biglumis [12,82]. The
present study agrees that the latter two species are sister

study does not put these two as sister species. The earlier
study did not include morphological characters, and did
not include either P. chinensis or P. marginalis which could
account for the differences [82].

regions will represent a powerful molecular tool in future
studies.

Methods
In a series of papers Strassmann and Queller argued that a
form of worker control of sex ratios was general for the
Epiponini [40,83]. This form of worker control meant
that colonies did not produce a new generation of queens
until the colony had reduced in queen number to one or
perhaps no queens. This is important to sociality because
such a queen reduction before requeening maintains high
relatedness within colonies. The species that they studied
this cyclical oligogyny in were Parachartergus colobopterus,
Protopolybia exigua, Brachygastra mellifica, Polybia emaciata
and Polybia occidentalis [63,83-86]. In addition West- Eberhard documented either cyclical oligogyny or some of its
features in three additional genera, Agelaia, Synoeca and
Metapolybia [87-89]. Taken together, these studies come
from all of the four basal-most lineages of the Epiponini,
and also cover 4 of the 6 lineages in our best sampled
clade, the one containing Polybia (Figure 7). Thus, it seems
they are justified in claiming the generality of this form of
worker control for the tribe.
Importance of molecular and morphological characters
The inclusion of several genetic markers (mitochondrial
and nuclear), improved the resolution of the trees
obtained from morphology alone. The COI sequence
alone did not resolve Polistes as a group; combining it with
the microsatellites did. While COI and the microsatellite
flanking regions did not resolve Polistella, adding the
repeat regions did so. The use of microsatellite flanking
regions and the presence/absence coding system for the
repeated regions of the microsatellites proved to be useful
in the resolution of some of the branches.

For the last fifteen years, a considerable rise in the use of
molecular markers has been observed. The majority of the
studies have exclusively included molecular data from
mtDNA genes. Even when the information gathered for
those studies has been informative, problems with the use
of this type of molecular data (saturation synonymous
sites with mtDNA; constrains imposed on RNA sites by
secondary structure, length variation, etc.) have been considered [25,90]. Unfortunately, few nuclear markers have
been used in phylogenetic systematic studies in the past.
The search for new, powerful, informative-single copy
nuclear markers has increased our wealth of information
in systematic studies. At the present time just a few more
nuclear markers have been used for insect phylogenetic
studies [26,91]. More genes are needed for testing
phylogenetic hypotheses. Meanwhile, the use of microsatellite flanking regions represents a valuable tool as nuclear
single-copy markers. The wealth of microsatellite data is
constantly growing across different taxa. The use of these

Species and specimens used
We used a total of 69 species representing the four tribes
of the subfamily Polistinae (Table 1). Specimens were
either donated by colleagues, or were in our own collections. These specimens included 33 species from the tribe
Polistini, 7 from the Mischocyttarini, 7 from the Ropalidiini and 22 from the Epiponini. We used the Polistini as
the
outgroup
for
the
Epiponini+Mischocyttarini+Ropalidiini. We used the latter three tribes as the outgroup for the analysis of the
Polistini.
Morphological and molecular characters
We used a total of 932 characters, including 95 morphological and behavioral characters (all morphological characters and character states from Carpenter's studies
[2,53,67] examined on pinned specimens for this study;
larval and behavioral characters and states from citations
given in appendixes 1 and 2); a 488 base pair (bp) fragment of the mtDNA COI gene (appendix 3) [92]; a 311 bp
fragment of single-copy nuclear flanking sequence of
three microsatellite loci (Pbe216AAG [137 bp],
Pbe269bAAG [75 bp], and, Pbe411AAT [99 bp]
(appendix 4) [52,93], and 38 characters representing the
different trinucleotides in the repeat region (not their
number; appendix 5 [78]). The repeat regions varied considerably across the four different tribes and across the different subgenera in the tribe Polistini. The coding system
for the repeat region was based on presence or absence of
each repeat motif and resulted in16 characters for
Pbe216AAG, 15 characters for Pbe269bAAG, and 7 characters for Pbe411AAT. For example, the first four characters at Pbe216AAG were GGA, AAA, TAA, GCA, all
substituted for AAG within the repeat region [78]. We did
not count times a specific motif was repeated because this
character is so variable its evolutionary history would be
unclear.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing for COI,
and microsatellites
We extracted DNA using protocol Strassmann I [94]. Prior
to DNA extractions, we stored all specimens either at 80°C or in 100% ethanol at room temperature. PCR reactions followed protocols as in Wilcox et al. [95] for the
mtDNA fragment, and Zhu et al. [78] for the
microsatellite loci. Sequencing PCR products were completed directly with thermo sequenase radiolabeled 33P
(Thermo Sequenace radiolabeled terminator cycle
sequencing Kit, Amersham Life Science). DNA sequences
were run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dried and
exposed to X-ray film. All new DNA microsatellite

data set. Paup* runs gave similar results as those with
Winclada and Nona.

Sequence alignment
The sequences for both mtDNA (COI) and for nuclear
regions (microsatellite flanking regions) were aligned
based on the criterion of maximum parsimony, using the
program Malign, specifying a 3:1 change:gap ratio [96].
We occasionally adjusted alignments by eye when Malign
gave poor results.

Authors' contributions

Systematic analysis techniques
We used Paup* 4.0b10 [97], Nona [98], and Winclada
[99] to construct the phylogeny, with equal weight for all
base-pair substitutions (including the mtDNA COI
sequence, [100]). For the COI gene, the analysis was completed with the use of the three coding positions weighted
equally and with the first and second coding positions
only. The phylogenetic trees were not in conflict by
excluding the third coding position.

We completed the phylogenetic analyses following the
principles of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood
and distance analysis. As the overall topology was not in
disagreement by applying different algorithms, we are
only presenting the results obtained based on maximum
parsimony. All parsimony analyses were run using
approximate searches, due to the large number of species
and characters. The runs consisted of 1000 replications of
the parsimony ratchet [101] as implemented in Winclada,
with 10% character reweighting and holding one tree; 500
replications at the "default amb-poly+" setting and 500 at
"amb = poly-." Resulting trees were read into Nona and
swapped on with "max*" (TBR branch swapping). Nona
was also used to carry out 1000 random addition
sequences as a check. Maximum parsimony trees were first
estimated individually for each of the different data sets
(morphological and molecular), and then in combination. Gaps were treated as missing characters. Bootstrap
analyses with 1000 replications were also run for each
