Abstract
Background: Despite the economic and ecological importance of ants, genomic tools for this
family (Formicidae) remain woefully scarce. Knowledge of genome size, for example, is a useful and
necessary prerequisite for the development of many genomic resources, yet it has been reported
for only one ant species (Solenopsis invicta), and the two published estimates for this species differ
by 146.7 Mb (0.15 pg).
Results: Here, we report the genome size for 40 species of ants distributed across 10 of the 20
currently recognized subfamilies, thus making Formicidae the 4th most surveyed insect family and
elevating the Hymenoptera to the 5th most surveyed insect order. Our analysis spans much of the
ant phylogeny, from the less derived Amblyoponinae and Ponerinae to the more derived
Myrmicinae, Formicinae and Dolichoderinae. We include a number of interesting and important
taxa, including the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), Neotropical army ants (genera Eciton
and Labidus), trapjaw ants (Odontomachus), fungus-growing ants (Apterostigma, Atta and
Sericomyrmex), harvester ants (Messor, Pheidole and Pogonomyrmex), carpenter ants (Camponotus), a
fire ant (Solenopsis), and a bulldog ant (Myrmecia). Our results show that ants possess small genomes
relative to most other insects, yet genome size varies three-fold across this insect family.
Moreover, our data suggest that two whole-genome duplications may have occurred in the
ancestors of the modern Ectatomma and Apterostigma. Although some previous studies of other
taxa have revealed a relationship between genome size and body size, our phylogeneticallycontrolled analysis of this correlation did not reveal a significant relationship.
Conclusion: This is the first analysis of genome size in ants (Formicidae) and the first across
multiple species of social insects. We show that genome size is a variable trait that can evolve
gradually over long time spans, as well as rapidly, through processes that may include occasional
whole-genome duplication. The small genome sizes of ants, combined with their ecological,
evolutionary and agricultural importance, suggest that some of these species may be good
candidates for future whole-genome sequencing projects.

Background
Genome size is one of the most fundamental genetic
properties of living organisms. Moreover, the size of an
organism's genome has important practical implications
for applications ranging from PCR-based microsatellite
genotyping to whole-genome sequencing [1-3].
The genome sizes of invertebrates (particularly insects)
remain understudied relative to their abundance and
diversity. This is particularly true in light of their impacts
on human health, industry, agriculture and science. Of
the nearly 1,000,000 described species of insects, genome
sizes have been estimated for approximately 453
(0.045%). For comparison, genome size estimates exist
for 8.05% of mammals (443 of ca. 5500 species) and
2.06% of birds (206 of ca. 10000 species) [4].
Ants (family: Formicidae) are among the most familiar,
abundant and ecologically important of the arthropods
[5,6], yet few genomic tools exist for this family of insects,
and virtually nothing is known of their genome sizes. Of
the nearly 20,000 species of ants that likely exist, the
genome size of only one (Solenopsis invicta) has been
reported [7,8], and the two estimates for this species differ
by >146 Mb.
Numerous studies have documented naturally occurring
variation in genome size at various taxonomic levels.
Clearly, extremely distantly related organisms usually possess genomes of different sizes, as the accumulated effects
of genomic expansions and contractions have had ample
time to produce measurable differences in genome size. A
number of studies have documented genome size variation over more recent evolutionary time-spans – among
congeneric species [9], and even among individuals
within single species (reviewed in [10,11]).
Ultimately, this genome size variation is determined by
the net effects of genome expansion and genomic deletion
(reviewed in [10]). Processes that act at the chromosomal
scale, such as polyploidy, aneuploidy, and whole genome
duplication, can produce rapid and extreme changes in
genome size. At smaller scales, the expansion of genomes
can be driven by mechanisms such as the proliferation of
transposable elements [12-14] or various types of noncoding DNA (reviewed in [15]). For example, both the
length [16] and frequency [17-19] of microsatellites (also
known as simple sequence repeats {SSRs} or variable
numbers of tandem repeats {VNTRs}) are positively correlated with genome size. This is true for taxa as disparate
as Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens
(reviewed in [15]). The duplication of coding sequences
also appears to play a role in the evolution of genome size,
and may be more important for generating phenotypic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/64

variation than is widely appreciated [20]. The mechanisms involved in genomic shrinkage, however, remain
unclear, and various hypotheses have been proposed to
explain this process (reviewed in [21,22]), including
reduction of long tandem repeats (LTRs), illegitimate and
unequal recombination, and the accumulation of small
deletions [23-26]. Overall, the rate of genome size evolution appears to be proportional to genome size, as larger
genomes are more likely to experience large or rapid
expansions and contractions [27].
The phenotypic correlates and consequences of genome
size variation remain murky, but correlative studies in a
variety of taxonomic groups have identified a handful of
characteristics that co-vary with genome size (reviewed in
[10]). For example, a positive relationship between body
size and genome size has been reported for several taxonomic groups, including turbellarian flatworms [28],
copepods [28], aphids [29] and mosquitoes [30]. Moreover, animals with high metabolic rates, such as flying birds
and bats, tend to have smaller genomes, suggesting that
metabolism may be a constraint [10,31,32]. Although the
ancestors of extant birds possessed genomes that were
small.(prior to the evolution of flight, [33]), modern
flightless birds, which have presumably been released
from flight-associated metabolic constraints, possess
genomes that are larger than flying birds [34]. Similarly,
flying insects have extremely high mass-corrected metabolic rates [35], and generally have small genomes
(reviewed in [10]). At a broad taxonomic level, genome
size also appears to be related to developmental life history. Gregory [10,36] proposed, based on data from 18
insect orders, that holometabolous groups (characterized
by complete metamorphosis) have smaller genomes than
those that are hemimetabolous or ametabolous. Specifically, the holometabolous orders possess genomes
smaller than 1C = 2 pg whereas the ametabolous and
hemimetabolous taxa, with exceptions [37], possess
genomes that span a range from <1 pg to <17 pg. Interestingly, a similar pattern occurs in amphibians – species
with rapid metamorphosis typically possess smaller
genomes than those characterized by direct development,
slower metamorphosis, or neoteny (no metamorphosis)
(reviewed in [36]). The adaptive significance of these correlations, if any, remains unclear. Finally, cell size appears
to be positively correlated with genome size in a variety of
taxonomic groups [10,38].
In this study, we use flow cytometry to estimate the
genome sizes for 40 species of ants, collected from 10 of
the 20 recognized subfamilies. These data were collected
from 173 separate genome size estimations, from 164
individual ants. We also test the hypothesis that genome
size is positively correlated with body size, as has been
reported in other taxa. Using data from the recent studies

of ant phylogeny, we place these results in a phylogenetic
context.

Results and Discussion
Our data increase the number of published genome size
estimates for ants from 1 species (Solenopsis invicta) to 41
species. Only three other insect families (Chrysomelidae,
Tenebrionidae and Culicidae) have had genomes sizes
estimated for more species [4] (Fig. 1). Similarly, only
four other orders of insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera) have genome sizes estimated for
more species [4] (Fig. 1).
Overall, the mean genome size of the ant species examined here was 361.8 Mb (0.37 pg), and values for individual species ranged three-fold, from 210.7 Mb (0.22 pg) in
Cerapachys edentata to 690.4 Mb (0.71 pg) in Ectatomma
tuberculatum (Table 1). The subfamilies within which
these two species occur (Cerapachyinae and Ectatommi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/64

nae, respectively) also had the most extreme genome sizes
of the ant subfamilies, but we only estimated genome
sizes for a single species within each of these subfamilies.
For subfamilies represented by more than one exemplar,
the Dolichoderinae had the smallest mean genome size
(289.1 Mb; 0.30 pg) and the Ponerinae possessed the largest (489.1 Mb; 0.50 pg). The small size of ant genomes
appears to be similar to non-ant Hymenoptera. For example, the wasp, Polistes dominulus, possesses a genome size
of 301.4 Mb (0.31 pg) [8], and the genome size of the
honeybee, Apis mellifera, is 262 Mb (0.27 pg) [39].
Ants, in general, appear to possess small genomes relative
to other insect families (Fig. 1). Of the 60 families for
which sufficient data exist, only 16 possess a mean
genome size that is smaller than that of the Formicidae.
Moreover, 10 of these 16 families are represented by a single species, and 3 have estimates from only two species.

Our estimate of genome size for the fire ant, Solenopsis
xyloni, was 472.3 Mb (0.48 pg). This appears to be substantially smaller than the genome size of the congeneric
red imported fire ant, S. invicta, estimated at 753.3 Mb
using flow cytometry [8].

lation on the data (P > 0.5). Compared to previously
studied taxa [28-30], the ants studied here possessed a
substantially narrower range of genome sizes, which may
have made it more difficult to detect a relationship
between genome size and body size.

For one species, Myrmecina americana, we found individual workers with two distinctly different genome sizes living within the same colony. Nine of the individuals
sampled possessed a genome size that was near 300 Mb,
but two individuals possessed genomes of about 250.7
Mb. This could represent true intraspecific variation in
genome size, or may indicate the presence of an undescribed cryptic social parasite, which has been reported for
this species (Stefan Cover, pers. comm.). In our analyses,
we treat these classes of individuals as two different samples.

Comparison of genome sizes among subfamilies suggests
that genomes of ants have both expanded and contracted
since the origin of ants, approximately 140 million years
ago [40,41]. Amblyopone pallipes, in the less derived subfamily Amblyoponinae, possesses a genome size of 335.5
Mb (0.34 pg), which is slightly larger than the mean size
of the more derived Formicidae, Dolichoderinae and Myrmicinae (Fig. 2). The Ponerinae, on the other hand, possess genomes that are larger than that of A. pallipes,
suggesting a genomic expansion in this lineage.

Similarly, the two Odontomachus chelifer individuals analyzed possessed genomes that differed by 39.9 Mb. This
difference is unlikely to be measurement error, as we
repeated our measurements for both of these individuals
and found similar values. For this species, we included
both values in our analyses, since we had no a priori reason to expect the presence of two different species.

Interestingly, we found evidence for genomic expansion,
perhaps via whole-genome duplication, in two ant lineages. Ectatomma tuberculatum, the sole species sampled
from the subfamily Ectatomminae, possesses a genome
size of 690.4 Mb (0.71 pg), which is about twice that of
the most closely related subfamilies, Formicinae (323.2

The largest proportion of the total variance (58%) was
observed among subfamilies, followed by 36% of the
total variance apportioned among genera (Table 2). Only
3.8% of the total variance was apportioned among species, but this is likely a consequence of the relatively small
number of species sampled within some of the subfamilies and genera.
The TFSI test on the genome size values of the terminal
taxa yielded P-values of 0.20, whether or not outliers were
excluded. We then used independent contrast values to
test the relationship between body size and genome size.
Independent contrast analysis of genome size vs. body
size showed no significant correlation between genome
size and head width when phylogeny was taken into
account (r2 < 0.002, P = 0.82, P = 0.84 with outliers
excluded). Re-running the TFSI test using the contrast data
indicated that the use of independent contrasts had successfully reduced any influence of phylogenetic autocorreTable 2: Variance components.

Mb; 0.33 pg), Myrmicinae (329.1 Mb; 0.34 pg) and Dolichoderinae (289.1 Mb; 0.30 pg) (Fig. 2). This suggests that
a genome duplication may have occurred in an ancestor of
Ectatomma, potentially as long as 80–90 million years ago
[40,41]. More thorough sampling of species in this and
closely related subfamilies (such as the sister subfamily,
Heteroponerinae) may illuminate more precisely when
this large genomic expansion occurred.
Similarly, the genome size of the fungus-growing ant,
Apterostigma dentigerum (636.4 Mb; 0.65 pg), is about
twice that of the most closely related species. Atta cephalotes (300.1 Mb; 0.31 pg), A. columbica (298.8 Mb; 0.31
pg) and Sericomyrmex amabilis (440.7 Mb; 0.45 pg), also
fungus-growing ants in the tribe Attini, possess genomes
that are about 47%, 47% and 69%, respectively, the size
of the Apterostigma genome. Because the fungus-growing
attines diverged from other ants about 50 million years
ago [42] the genomic expansion in Apterostigma may have
occurred more recently than the one in Ectatomma. The
history of this genomic expansion, and whether it arose
via a whole-genome duplication, could be clarified by a
closer examination of these genomes for signatures of
genome duplication as well as knowledge of genome size
in more closely related species, such as in the genera Mycocepurus and Cyphomyrmex [43,44].
Although few other studies have examined genome size at
the levels of individual, species, genus, and subfamily,
recent analyses of spiders and species of Lepidoptera have
revealed patterns similar to what we report for the ants.
Specifically, within Lepidoptera, genome size varies little
within subfamilies, and more substantially among subfamilies and families [45]. Similarly, in spiders most of
the variation in genome size occurs within families, and
less is partitioned among genera and species [46].
Previous studies have suggested that animals with high
metabolic rates, including flying insects, possess relatively
small genomes [10]. Although most individual ants are
wingless workers, and do not ever fly, ants still have
extremely small genomes. This may be because males and
queens, in many species, engage in nuptial flights. This
pattern may hold for non-flying lineages because they are
descended from ancestors who flew [6], and thus had
high metabolic rates.
A growing body of research suggests that species that
undergo complete metamorphosis possess genomes that
are smaller than 2 pg [10,36]. Our data match this pattern:
All ants undergo complete metamorphosis and the
genome sizes of the species that we examined all fall at the
small end of the spectrum. In fact, compared to other
insect families, ants (like other Hymenoptera) appear to
possess some of the smallest genomes (Fig. 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/64

Clearly, within this family, as well as within other taxonomic groups, there are interesting and unexplained patterns of genome size variation. Within the ants,
exploration of intergeneric genome size variation within
the Attini or inter-subfamilial variation centered on
Ectatomminae may illuminate processes involved in the
expansion and contraction of genomes across divergent
evolutionary time scales. These data may be particularly
useful when placed into phylogenetic context using the
recent in-depth studies of Moreau et al. [40] and Brady et
al. [41]. Similarly, closer examination of genetic characteristics such as number of transposable elements, intron
size, and microsatellite size and number, may elucidate
the mechanisms by which genomes expand and contract
through time.
Finally, the recent development of genomic tools for ants
[47] and whole-genome sequences for other Hymenoptera [39] suggest that similar resources may be on the horizon for other ant species. Because genome size is an
important consideration for whole-genome sequencing
programs, our genome size data will be useful for guiding
selection of candidate ant taxa. Not only will knowledge
of genome size be useful in this arena, for the development of ant genomics, but the resulting genomic tools will
also inform studies of genome size evolution.

Conclusion
The total amount of genetic material possessed by an
organism is a fundamental feature of its biology. However, we currently know little about the processes that
underlie variation in genome size, or even how much variation occurs within and among most taxa. Our study is
the first to explore the variation and evolution of genome
size in ants, and one of the first (in any system) to examine genome size variation across a range of taxonomic levels, from individuals up to subfamilies. We show that
ants, in general, have remarkably small genomes, and that
most variation in genome size occurs among subfamilies.
Given the ecological, agricultural and economic importance of ants, these findings indicate that many species
may be amenable to the development of genomic tools,
or even whole-genome sequencing projects. Moreover,
the presence of both large- and small-scale variation in
genome size (and a well-studied phylogeny) suggests that
ants may be useful model systems for exploring the general processes underlying the evolution of genomes.

Methods
We collected ants from colonies in the field that were discovered by visual searching. When possible, we used multiple individuals from the same colony as replicates for
genome size estimates. In some cases, when we were unable to replicate across individuals, we replicated across tissues from the same individual. Genome sizes are

presented here as either megabases (Mb) or C-value,
which is the haploid nuclear DNA content expressed in
picograms (pg) (1 pg = 978 million bases).
To estimate genome sizes, we dissected brains from the
ant species under consideration and from the yellowwhite strain of Drosophila melanogaster.(described in [48]).
These were ground together in Galbraith buffer using 15
strokes of the "A" pestle in a Kontes 2 ml Dounce. The
mixture was passed through a 50 micron filter, stained
with 50 parts per million (ppm) of propidium iodide and
run (after 30 minutes in the cold and dark) in a Partek
flow cytometer with the laser emitting an exciting light at
514 nanometers (nm). Red flourescence from propidium
iodide (intercalated into the DNA of the 2C and 4C nuclei
of Drosophila and ant) was detected using a high bandpass
filter (615 nm). The amount of DNA in the ant was calculated as the ratio of mean channel number of the 2C ant/
mean channel of 2C Drosophila times 175 Mb. The latter is
the genome size of the sequenced strain of Drosophila
anchored against the fully sequenced Caenorhabditis elegans [48]. Overall, we performed 173 genome size estimations from 164 individual ants.
To compare the genome sizes of ants (family: Formicidae)
to the genome sizes of other insect families, we compiled
data from the Animal Genome Size Database [4]. These
data were downloaded from the database in September
2007, when there were 535 estimates of genome sizes
from 453 species of insects. Since there were two different
estimates for the single ant species represented (Solenopsis
invicta), we used the value of 753.3 Mb ± 1.8 S.E. (0.77
pg), which was estimated using flow cytometry [8], rather
than the smaller value, which was estimated via disassociation kinetics [7]. We used ANOVA, implemented in
ProcGLM (SAS), to examine variation in genome size at
different taxonomic levels.
One individual of one species, Tapinoma sessile, appeared
to be a polyploid, and was thus excluded from further
analyses (but is shown in Table 1). Four other ants from
four different species appeared to be outliers, with
genome sizes that were 34.0 – 47.7 Mb larger (in three
cases) or smaller (in one case) than the mean genome size
for the other representatives of that species. In these cases,
we conducted our analyses both including and excluding
the outliers.
To test for phylogenetic autocorrelation and to correct for
phylogenetically-based non-independence of genomesize data, we used the multi-step approach of Abouheif
[49]. First, we used a test of serial independence (TFSI, as
implemented in the PI software package, [50]) to determine whether phylogenetic autocorrelation was statistically relevant in our dataset. With that test indicating the

possibility of phylogenetic effects on genome size, we
used the independent contrasts method of Felsenstein
[51] as implemented in the software package CAIC [52].
Taxa were arranged by phylogenetic relatedness of their
respective genera according to the phylogenies of Brady et
al. [41] and Moreau et al. [40], which were complementary and congruent with respect to the taxa sampled.
Branch lengths were treated as equal due to the combination of data from independently derived phylogenies, and
monophyly of genera was assumed for the purposes of
determining the branching pattern, as the published phylogenies used different species exemplars than this study
in many cases. Head width was used as a proxy for size,
and treated as the independent variable, and genome size
as the dependent variable for the independent contrast
analysis. For genera with multiple species exemplars (e.g.
Odontomachus), the arithmetic mean of the genome size
across all species was used as the value for the genus. Contrast values (30) for genome size were regressed against
those for head width. Contrast values were subsequently
reanalyzed using the PI software to determine whether the
contrast method had successfully produced statistically
independent results. All PI and IC analyses were also run
using a data set which excluded the outliers described
above.

Abbreviations
Pg = picograms, Mb = megabases, or million base pairs,
PCR = polymerase chain reaction, IC = independent contrasts.

Authors' contributions
NDT and AVS conceived and designed this study and performed the field-work. JSJ performed the flow cytometry
to estimate genome sizes. AVS collected the body size data
and JCS performed the tests for phylogenetic autocorrelation and independent contrasts. Other analyses were performed by NDT and JSJ. NDT, JCS and AVS provided
funding for the research and NDT wrote the manuscript
with input from all authors. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
