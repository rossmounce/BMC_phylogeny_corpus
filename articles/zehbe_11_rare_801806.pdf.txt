Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine whether low prevalence human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 variants differ
from high prevalence types in their functional abilities. We evaluated functions relevant to carcinogenesis for the
rarely-detected European variants R8Q, R10G and R48W as compared to the commonly detected L83V. Human
immortalized keratinocytes (NIKS) stably transduced with the E6 variants were used in most functional assays. Low
and high prevalence E6 variants displayed similar abilities in abrogation of growth arrest and inhibition of p53
elevation induced by actinomycin D. Differences were detected in the abilities to dysregulate stratification and
differentiation of NIKS in organotypic raft cultures, modulate detachment induced apoptosis (anoikis) and
hyperactivate Wnt signaling. No distinctive phenotype could be assigned to include all rare variants. Like L83V, raft
cultures derived from variants R10G and R48W similarly induced hyperplasia and aberrantly expressed keratin 5 in
the suprabasal compartment with significantly lower expression of keratin 10. Unlike L83V, both variants, and
particularly R48W, induced increased levels of anoikis upon suspension in semisolid medium. R8Q induced a
unique phenotype characterized by thin organotypic raft cultures, low expression of keratin 10, and high
expression of keratins 5 and 14 throughout all raft layers. Interestingly, in a reporter based assay R8Q exhibited a
higher ability to augment TCF/b-catenin transcription. The data suggests that differences in E6 variant prevalence
in cervical carcinoma may not be related to the carcinogenic potential of the E6 protein.
Background
Development of cervical cancer is strongly associated
with the infection of high risk human papillomavirus
(HPV), with HPV16 having the highest prevalence rate
(50-70%) [1-4]. Cervical cancer is a rare consequence of
high-risk HPV infection and additional viral and non
viral factors are involved in determining the risk for
cancer development. There are four key viral factor
determinants that contribute to the progression of low
grade lesions to invasive cancer: 1) persistence of HPV
infection, 2) contentious expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7, 3) integration of viral DNA into the
host cell chromosomes and 4) inactivation of the E2
gene. Furthermore, host factors such as HLA genotypes
and polymorphism of p53 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase are also important determinants [4,5]. In
fact, considerable evidence has been gathered on

polymorphism in the HPV genome and risk for cancer
progression.
Diversity arises within any given HPV genotype via
limited nucleotide changes in the coding (< 2%) and
non-coding (5%) regions [5]. These variants phylogenetically segregate based upon their geographical origin and
thus are named European, African, Asian, Asian-American and North American. Significant differences in
pathogenicity exist between variants within a single genotype and have been elucidated most clearly for HPV16.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that HPV16 variants
differ in their association with cervical cancer [6-15],
viral persistence [16-21] and the frequency of recurrence
of cervical disease [15]. Moreover, several studies investigated the functional consequence of changes in the
viral LCR, E2 and E6 gene with respect to promoter
activity, HPV gene expression and genome replication as
well as cell transformation and related molecular pathways [4,5]. Most of the functional and mechanistic studies on carcinogenesis-related functions have been
carried out on HPV16 E6 variants [22-27].

Previous investigations by our group and others indicated that E6 variants differ in their abilities to bind to
the calcium-binding protein, E6BP, an E6 target involved
in differentiation; to target bax, a pro-apoptotic protein
for degradation [24], to inhibit serum/calcium-induced
differentiation [22,25], to abrogate human keratinocyte
phenotypic differentiation and expression of cytokeratins
when grown in organotypic raft cultures [26] and to
transform spontaneously immortalized aneuploid human
keratinocytes [23] as well as foreskin primary human
keratinocytes [27].
In a previous study we investigated the functional
characteristics of L83V-related E6 variants that are
highly represented in cervical cancers [7,8,14,19], including the Asian-American Q14H/H78Y/L83V variant [26].
The study found that variants differed from the E6 prototype in their abilities to dysregulate keratinocyte differentiation in organotypic cultures and modulate
detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis).
In the present study, we continued our investigation
on the role of HPV E6 polymorphisms in the development of cervical cancer. We asked whether E6 variants
with low prevalence in cervical carcinoma of European
women have different carcinogenic potential than high
prevalence variants. Three rare variants were characterized for their functional abilities in assays relevant to
carcinogenesis when compared to a common variant in
cervical cancer of European women, namely L83V. The
rare variants contain a single amino acid variation in the
N-terminus of E6. These include the R8Q, identified in
one high-grade lesion of a Finnish woman [14], R10G,
identified in two cervical carcinomas of Swedish women
[12] and R48W identified in one cervical carcinoma of
an Italian woman [12]. We provide evidence that low
prevalence E6 variants possess significant, though different activities in the dysregulation of keratinocyte differentiation, modulation of suspension-induced apoptosis
(anoikis) and augmentation of Wnt signaling. Thus, no
distinctive phenotype that could be assigned to all rare
variants could be identified.

Materials and methods
Human papillomavirus 16 E6 genotypes

We have chosen four HPV16 E6 variants, which had
previously been detected in clinical samples from Swedish, Finnish and Italian women: the European R8Q,
R48W, R10G and L83V [7,12,14]. The E6 genotypes
tagged with HA at the carboxy-terminus were cloned
into the LXSN vector and pJS55 vector as described previously [24,26].
Transfection and retroviral gene transfer

High titer retroviral supernatants were generated by
transient transfection of the Phoenix cell line

Page 2 of 13

(amphotropic virus). Infection of NIKS and selection in
medium containing 150 μg/mL G418 were carried out
as described [26]. Transfections into HEK293T and
C33A cells were carried out with the jetPEI reagent
(polyPlus transfection).
Detection of HPV E6/variant expression

To verify the presence of DNA of each E6 variant in the
recipient cells and to ensure E6 expression on the
mRNA level, mRNA extracted from the transduced
NIKS was reverse transcribed and amplified using the
primers 5’- CAGCTGGGTTTCTCTACGTCT-3’ and 5’CATTTTCGTTCTCGTCATCTG-3’ to detect the full
length 16E6 transcript and the two splice variants. Protein expression was verified by Western blot analysis
(anti E6 antibody and anti HA antibody), and immunofluorescence (anti HA antibody) as described previously
[24,26]. The variation in R8Q hindered recognition by
the anti HPV16 E6 clone 6F-4 [26].
Western blot analysis

One hundred and twenty μg of protein lysate were
loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE mini-gel, transferred to a
PVDF membrane and immunoblotted. For detection of
E6 variants, the monoclonal HPV16 E6 antibody (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France) [26] or anti HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Y-11) (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology Inc.)
were used at 1:1000. For detection of actin, goat antiactin (sc-1616, Santa-Cruz Biotechnologies Inc.) was
used at 1:1000. Detection of p53 was carried out using
mouse anti-p53 (clone Do-7, DAKO, Mississsauga, ON,
Canada) at 1:1000. A goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson
Immunoresearch #115-036-071) was used either at
1:10.000 (for E6) or at 1:50.000. Detection of E6, p53 or
b-actin was achieved by using the ECL Plus Western
Detection Kit for horseradish peroxidase (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Determination of p53 protein levels by ELISA

After treatment with 0.5 nM AD NIKS were harvested
by trypsinization, counted and 1 × 105cells/sample used
per read-out. The cells were lysed and remaining levels
of p53 were measured by Diaclone’s ready-to-use fully
formatted ELISA kit (Diaclone, Besancon, France). The
mean value/STD of 3 independent experiments using
duplicates for each cell line was calculated with MS
Excel.
Organotypic raft cultures and immunofluorescence

Raft cultures derived from NIKS stably transduced with
LXSN and HPV16 E6 variants were grown in triplicate
for 14 days and processed for immunofluorescence as
previously described [26]. Immunofluorescence on raft

culture sections (5 μ) was performed using the appropriate primary antibodies: a rabbit anti-K5 polyclonal antibody (#24647, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), a mouse
anti-K10 monoclonal antibody (DAKO, Mississauga,
ON, Canada), or an anti human K14 antibody
(MLA890T, SeroTec), followed by secondary antibodies,
AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) or AlexaFluor 594 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen), as described
[26,27]. A Nikon eclipse 80 i microscope configured
with a Nikon digital camera Dxm 1200 c was used to
image the fluorescent-stained sections with 350, 488 and
594 lines for blue, green and red channel excitation,
respectively. Exposure times were adjusted to each colour channel, identical for each respective image. All colour images were saved in a Tag Image File Format
(TIFF) and were used for quantitative fluorescence
analysis.
Quantitative fluorescence analyses

The digital microscopy images were quantified and the
average fluorescence intensity of each region of interest
was calculated using the Multi Image Quantification
Analysis System; Cytoview, Petach Tikva, Israel as
described [26,28]. Four images of each staining were
captured from different sections and used for quantitative analyses. The regions of interest, basal and suprabasal, were defined manually in each image, according to
the tissue morphology of the DAPI stain. Finally in
order to compare the relative levels of protein expression in each region, the average area intensity values
were used.

Luciferase reporter activity assay

Assays for induction of Wnt signaling and its augmentation by E6 variant expression were carried out as previously described [29]. HEK293T or C33A cells growing
in 5 cm dishes were transfected at 60-70% confluence
with DNA of the superTOPFLASH or the control superFOPFLASH (containing mutated TCF/b-catenin binding
sites) (1 μg) plasmid, the b-gal (0.1 μg) expression plasmid (used to evaluate the transfection efficiency in
HEK293T cells) or 0.5 μg Renilla luciferase (used to evaluate the transfection efficiency in C33A cells) and various
amounts of the E6 variant plasmid. Wnt signaling was
induced by cotransfection of the plasmids encoding the
Wnt ligand, pWnt3a (0.1 μg), and the Wnt receptor,
human Frizzeled 1, pHFz1 (0.3 μg). Empty vector DNA
was added to adjust for equal amounts of transfected
DNA. The jetPEI reagent, (polyPlus Transfection) was
used for transfection. Forty eight hours after transfection,
luciferase levels were measured using the Luciferase
Assay System kit (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity
was normalized relative to the b-galactosidase or the
Renilla luciferase activity. Luciferase readouts obtained
with the superFOPFLASH (0.01-0.001 of the superTOPFLASH signal) were subtracted from the readouts
obtained with the superTOPFLASH plasmid. Data is presented as relative luciferase readouts (fold activation)
where luciferase readouts in the vector cells were presented as 1. The collated results of fold activation are
mean values and standard deviations (SD) from at least
three independent experiments done in duplicates.
Statistical analyses

Induction of apoptosis in semisolid medium

To prepare semisolid medium 3.37 g of methylcellulose
was autoclaved with a magnetic stir bar in a 250 ml
bottle. 100 ml of serum-free medium (Ham’s F12 and
DMEM at a ratio of 3:1 as well as Ca2+ at a final concentration of 0.66 mM) was heated to 60°C, added to
methylcellulose, stirred for 20 min at RT followed by
adding an additional 100 ml medium and stirred at 4°
C for 1 h. The semisolid medium was then centrifuged
for 90 min at 10,000 rpm in 50 ml Falcon tubes to
remove non-dissolved methylcellulose fibers. NIKS
were trypsinized, washed once with serum-containing
NIKS medium followed by one wash with serum-free
medium. NIKS were suspended in semisolid medium
at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells/ml at 37°C and 5% C02
atmosphere for 16 h. Negative controls were adherent
cells overlaid with semisolid medium. After incubation
in semisolid medium, cells were washed three times
with PBS, trypsinized, washed once in serum-containing medium and twice in PBS. Pellets were used for
the Annexin V-FITC assay (Sigma) measured by flow
cytometry.

Data of activity in the various functional assays is presented in the figures as average (mean) values + standard deviation (SD). Data was subjected to one-way
ANOVA. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

Results
In this study, we evaluated the functional abilities of rare
HPV16 E6 variants, i.e. those with low prevalence in cervical carcinomas of previously studied European populations, including variant R8Q, R10G, and R48W [12,14].
These variants were tested for activities considered to be
important in HPV associated carcinogenesis. The E6
L83V, which is highly represented in European populations and in cervical carcinomas, was included for comparison. The E6 mRNA and protein expression of the
variants was verified. Results are summarized in Figure 1.
E6 polymorphisms similarly abrogate growth arrest and
inhibit elevation of p53 induced by actinomycin D

The ability of high risk HPV E6 to inhibit growth arrest
and to abrogate DNA damage responses induced by p53 is
crucial during HPV-associated carcinogenesis [30]. The

Figure 1 Gene expression of HPV16 E6 variants in NIKS as defined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
Western blot and immunofluorescence. RT-PCR detected three bands representing mRNAs of the full length and the splice variants E6I and
E6II (A). With the E6 antibody used (clone 6F4) and input of 120 μg of total protein, a band of the expected size was detected in extracts of
NIKS transduced with all E6 proteins except R8Q. Loading of 200 μg total protein detected a faint band (data not shown). Western with the antiHA antibody detected all the E6 proteins (B). The micrograph shows immunofluorescence against the HA-tag epitope. E6-specific staining is
present in all transduced NIKS lines (C).

capacity of the E6 protein to abrogate actinomycin D
(AD)-induced growth arrest was correlated to its ability to
target p53 for degradation in vivo [31]. We examined the
ability of the E6 variants to override growth arrest and to
reduce p53 levels induced by AD. The distribution of cells
in the G1, S and G2/M phases and the G1/S ratios were
determined before and after the treatment with AD (Figure 2A-B). Treatment of the control vector NIKS resulted
in a dramatic increase of growth-arrested cells, as evidenced by the reduction in the proportion of cells in S
phase and increase in the proportion of cells in G1 phase
with an increase in the G1/S ratio (Figure 2C). In contrast,
no significant change in the G1/S ratio was observed in
E6-transduced NIKS, indicating that all E6 variants alike

could overcome the growth arrest induced by AD (Figure
2C). In the empty vector control cells, the ratio increased
about 5-fold, while it stayed close to 1 (range 0.8 to 1.4) in
the E6-transduced NIKS in the presence of AD (Figure
2C). The highest efficiency in overcoming the G1 block
was exhibited by the E6 variants R10G (r = 0.9) and R48W
(r = 0.8), while R8Q showed the lowest efficiency (r = 1.4)
(Figure 2C). Additionally, all variants demonstrated an
increased proportion of cells in G2/M after AD treatment.
In both cases, the inter-variant differences were not statistically significant. Consistent with these results, when
compared to control NIKS all variants significantly lowered the steady-state levels of p53 and were able to prevent
the elevation of p53 after treatment with 0.5 nM AD for

24 h. However, the p53 level increased about 3-fold in the
vector control NIKS after treatment, as evidenced by
ELISA and Western blot (Figure 3). These results showed
no statistically significant difference in the activities
between the rare (R8Q, R10G, R48W) and common L83V
variants, consistent with previously described data [24,26].
E6 polymorphisms selectively alter keratinocyte
differentiation induced in organotypic keratinocyte raft
cultures

Squamous epithelia consist of proliferating, basal, and
differentiating suprabasal layers of keratinocytes. Keratinocyte stratification and differentiation is a tightly

regulated process [32,33]. The epidermal layers are characterized by intermediate filament structures denoted
keratins. While keratin pairs K5 and K14 are expressed
in the basal layer, K1 and K10 are expressed in suprabasal layers starting with the spinous layer. Due to the fact
we found aberrant morphology and differentiation patterns (phenotypes) in keratinocyte cultures transduced
with the high prevalence variants [26] we determined it
necessary to investigate the pattern of differentiation
induced by low prevalence variants.
To evaluate the abilities of the HPV16 E6 variants to
alter phenotypic differentiation, we grew the E6-transduced NIKS in organotypic raft cultures and looked for

alterations in the three dimensional structure and
expression of specific keratins. NIKS underwent a normal differentiation program, comparable to normal skin
when cultivated in organotypic raft cultures [34]. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of raft cultures transduced
with the empty vector showed ordered stratification and
epithelial thickness as previously described for normal
NIKS [34]. A layer of undifferentiated basal cells, several
layers of suprabasal cells and anucleated cells from the
cornified envelope could be detected (Figure 4A). Raft
cultures obtained from NIKS transduced with the E6
variants were different in morphological appearance. All
cultures were dysplastic with abnormal stratification,
showing more or less than the expected epithelial thickness, nuclear atypia and lack of cell polarity (most pronounced in the R48W raft). No cornified layers
(anucleated cells) were seen suggesting lack of terminal
differentiation. Nuclei were present in all layers;

however mitotic figures, usually observed in epithelial
dysplasia, were absent (Figure 4A). The raft cultures
derived from R8Q and R48W demonstrated mostly
undifferentiated cells with little cytoplasm, while L83V
and R10G demonstrated strata with undifferentiated and
differentiated keratinocytes. The R8Q variant raft
showed a considerably lower number of epithelial layers
than the raft cultures expressing the vector LXSN.
Other E6 variants showed increased thickness compared
to LXSN characteristic of hyperplasia.
To examine whether keratin marker expression varied
amongst E6 variant raft cultures, we performed immunofluorescence using antibodies against both the basal
cell markers K5 and keratin 14 and the suprabasal cell
differentiation marker K10 (Figure 4A-D). In the vector
control NIKS, basal cell type markers K5 and K14 were
expressed in the basal cell compartment and K10 was
expressed in the suprabasal cells as expected. Thus, control rafts demonstrated a complementary staining pattern of differentiation markers similar to normal skin.
Rafts expressing the E6 proteins exhibited perturbed
epithelial differentiation. K5 was expressed in basal and
suprabasal layers independent of the E6 subtype, suggesting a phenotype of early sqamous cell carcinoma for
both rare and common variants [35,36]. The area intensity of K5 in the suprabasal layers was the strongest in
the R8Q raft culture with the difference in intensity
from LXSN, L83V, R10G and R48W being statistically
significant (Figure 4A-B). K10 staining was mainly
detected in the suprabasal cell layers. Staining was uniform in the L83V rafts, whereas only sporadic staining
was observed in the R8Q, R10G and R48W rafts (Figure
4A-B). R8Q exhibited K10 staining in the uppermost
layer only. The area intensity of K10 in the suprabasal
layers of all E6 variant rafts was significantly lower than
that of the vector. K14 another marker of basal cells,
was mainly expressed in the basal layer of rafts, except
for R8Q, which showed uniform staining in all layers
(Figure 4C-D). The area intensity of K14 in the suprabasal part of the R8Q rafts was significantly higher than
that of LXSN and all other E6 rafts.
The ability of rare and common HPV16 E6 variants to
modulate apoptosis induced by cell suspension in
semisolid medium differs

NIKS are permissive for cell-detachment-based apoptosis (anoikis), which is triggered by the extrinsic death
receptor pathway [37]. Anoikis can be induced by suspending cells in a semisolid medium. NIKS were
exposed to serum-free medium made semisolid with
methylcellulose. NIKS kept in suspension underwent
apoptosis as determined by annexin V-FITC labeling
and FACS analyses (Figure 5A-B). A significant increase
in the proportion of cells that stained with annexin V-

FITC, characteristic to apoptosis, was observed in the

these cells (24.3-54.5%) also stained with propidium
iodide (annexinV+/PI+) indicating late apoptotic cells. A
smaller fraction (2.4-5.6%) consisted of early apoptotic
cells (annexinV+/PI-) with no significant difference in
their proportion among the tested cultures. The L83V
NIKS showed approximately 20% lower levels of

apoptotic cells than LXSN NIKS. Conversely, the other
E6 variant NIKS showed higher levels of apoptosis than
the vector cells, indicating that the rare variants sensitize
NIKS for suspension-induced apoptosis (Figure 5B).
NIKS transduced with R48W exhibited the highest levels
of late apoptotic cells, with the difference from the
empty vector NIKS and NIKS expressing L83V being
statistically significant (Figure 5B).

HPV16 E6 variants show different abilities in the
hyperactivation of Wnt signaling

The role of the Wnt TCF signaling pathway in the
development of cervical cancer has not been elucidated,
although several reports have provided evidence on
deregulation of this pathway in cervical cancers [38,39].
Previous studies showed that activation of the canonical
Wnt signal in HPV immortalized keratinocytes induced
their malignant transformation, while Wnt signal activation in cells absent of HPV did not [38]. Our recent studies demonstrated that the high risk HPV E6 augments
canonical Wnt-TCF signaling [29]. In the present study,
we evaluated the abilities of the E6 variants to hyperactivate Wnt signaling in a b-catenin/TCF reporter assay.
Transfection of the Wnt3a ligand and HFz-1 receptor
into HEK293T cells upregulated lucerifase activity.
Cotransfection of E6 variant plasmids further augmented
the Wnt/HFz-1-induced signal in a dose-dependent
manner reaching up to 4-fold activation over that of the
vector LXSN (Figure 6A). Consistent with our previous
report, none of the E6 proteins were capable of inducing
the luciferase reporter activity when transfected alone
(data not shown). The E6 variants showed different abilities to augment Wnt signaling. The R8Q variant
showed the highest hyperactivation activity and the
R48W showed the lowest activity. The differences in
activity between R48W and both R8Q and L83V were
statistically significant. R10G and L83V variants also
showed lower activity than R8Q but the difference was
not statistically significant. Luciferase reporter assays
carried out with C33A cells, a cervical carcinoma cell
line that lacks HPV, showed similar results (Figure 6B).
Although luciferase readouts in extracts of C33A cells
were lower than HEK293T cells, signal augmentation by
the different variants showed a comparable trend as that
observed in HEK293T cells (Figure 6B).

Discussion
Previous data suggests that variants of the same HPV
type are biologically distinct and may confer different
pathological risks [5]. We have previously found differences in the functional activities of common HPV16 E6
variants and sought to investigate how rare variants differed in these activities. Three variants with low presentation in cervical carcinomas of previously studied
European populations, accounting for 0-2.2% in different
cohorts [12-14], were investigated. Activities of these
variants were compared with the L83V variant, which is
highly represented in cancer of European populations.
In this study, several activities considered to be important in HPV associated carcinogenesis were evaluated.
The disruption of p53-mediated responses to DNA
damage by E6 is believed to contribute to subsequent
accumulation of genetic changes associated with cervical

carcinogenesis [40]. Previous studies with site directed
mutants demonstrated that other amino acid changes in
the same positions as those of R8Q and R10G, did
impair the ability of E6 to induce p53 degradation [31].
However, consistent with our earlier investigations
[24-26] we show that all tested E6 polymorphisms were
capable of strongly reducing the steady-state levels of
p53 in NIKS.
This research also demonstrates that similar to L83V,
the rare E6 variant proteins were able to both suppress
the elevation in levels of the p53 protein and override
p53-mediated growth-arrest that normally is induced by

Zehbe et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:77
http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/10/1/77

actinomycin D [30]. The similarities in the modulation
of DNA damage responses between the common L83V
and the rare E6 variants, both in terms of suppression
of p53 accumulation and overcoming growth arrest,
strongly suggest that these functions of E6 cannot be
compromised to initiate the carcinogenic process.
Growth of HPV-immortalized cell lines in organotypic
cultures produces epithelial layers exhibiting abnormal
morphology with phenotypes similar to that observed in
premalignant lesions and carcinomas found in vivo
[27,41,42]. Expression of the E6 protein alone was also
shown to induce alterations of keratinocyte differentiation in organotypic cultures, including disorganized
layer formation and hyperplasia [[26] and references
therein]. In a recent study, L83V-related variants of
HPV 16 E6 were evaluated for alteration of NIKS differentiation, it was demonstrated that all tested E6 proteins
induced hyperplastic cultures with abnormal stratification. In addition, deregulated expression of squamous
cell differentiation proteins was detected in all E6expressing rafts [26]. We show herein that the rare E6
variants also induce dysregulated differentiation of NIKS
when grown in organotypic cultures, but with various
phenotypes. R10G and R48W induced hyperplastic proliferation similar to that induced by the high prevalence
type L83V, whereas the R8Q cultures had a unique phenotype, characterized by lack of stratification. Furthermore, the same variant was previously demonstrated to
have high activity in the inhibition of serum- and calcium triggered stratification and terminal differentiation
[25].
Perturbed differentiation in all E6 cultures was indicated by aberrant expression of K5 in suprabasal cells.
Expression of K14 was more confined to the basal cells
except for R8Q, which showed strong expression of
both K5 and K14 throughout the rafts suggesting that
the cells do have a basal cell phenotype. Although
expression of K10 was restricted to the suprabasal layers
of the raft cultures, a significantly lower expression was
detected in the E6 NIKS with the rare variants R10G,
R48W and R8Q. Interestingly, these E6 variants showed
lower capacity to bind E6BP, a calcium binding protein
involved in keratinocytes differentiation, as demonstrated in a previous study [24]. Simultaneous expression of K10 and K5 was also observed in the E6
cultures. This was more pronounced in the L83V and
the R48W cultures. Replication of suprabasal keratinocytes aberrantly co-expressing K5 and K10 due to a premature migration of proliferating keratinocytes into the
suprabasal compartment is a hallmark of early squamous cell carcinogenesis [35,43]. This may reflect an
advantage for the variants exhibiting this characteristic
in promoting carcinogenesis. On the other hand, the
observed phenotype may impact on the viral life cycle,

Page 10 of 13

which is tightly linked to the differentiation program of
the cell and typically occurs during early carcinogenesis.
In this respect, strong activity in suppression of keratinocyte differentiation as that exhibited by R8Q may not
be favorable for viral persistence, which may explain in
part the rare detection of the R8Q variant in previously
studied populations [12,14].
Suspension of normal keratinocytes into semisolid
medium induces their terminal differentiation [44]. This
trigger also induces detachment associated apoptosis
(anoikis) in NIKS [34]. NIKS transduced with the minor
E6 variants, R8Q, R10G and particularly R48W, exhibited higher apoptotic figures when suspended in low calcium and serum-free semisolid medium, indicating their
ability to augment anoikis. The largest increase was in
R48W and was statistically significant when compared
to the vector cells. In an earlier investigation [26] NIKS
transduced with the E6 variants Q14H/H78Y/L83V and
R10G/L83V demonstrated significantly higher levels of
late apoptotic cells when suspended in methylcellulose
than L83V. The biological significance of this finding
was suggested to be related to the means of viral transmission and spread in the tissue. Further confirmation
of this comes from the fact that caspase-3 has been
found elevated during the productive stage of the viral
life cycle that occurs in differentiating keratinocytes
[45]. High activity of the Asian American variant Q14H/
H78Y/L83V in apoptosis induction [26] was suggested
to be related to its high persistence and increased risk
of progression to cancer (reported to be 20-fold higher
than that of prototype E6) [13]. However, data obtained
in this study suggests that, induction of high levels of
apoptosis may not be a major determinant of viral persistence. As our data shows R48W with significantly
higher ability to induce apoptosis than L83V, has low
prevalence in previously studied European populations
(identified in only one ICC of an Italian women) [12,14].
It appears that the differentiation ability as reflected by
K10 expression is more important as it was found to be
significantly higher among common compared to rare
variants detected in cervical carcinomas [26,27]. Thus,
the viral life cycle is largely dependent on the differentiation program of the cell.
Deregulation of the canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling
pathway often leads to the formation of epithelial
tumors [46,47]. It was recently shown that the Wnt
canonical signal controls the maintenance of skin cancer
stem cells [48]. The role of the Wnt-TCF signaling pathway in the development of cervical cancer has not been
elucidated, although evidence for deregulating this pathway in cervical cancers exists [38,39]. Experimentally,
Wnt signaling activation in HPV immortalized keratinocytes induced their malignant transformation [38]. In a
recent study, we demonstrated that HPV16 E6 augments

Zehbe et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:77
http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/10/1/77

Wnt/b-catenin signaling, which could be a way by which
HPV oncoproteins may contribute to promoting transformation of human keratinocytes [29]. Luciferase
reporter assays described herein indicated that the
HPV16 E6 variant proteins were capable to hyperactivate TCF-b-catenin-dependent transcription. The rare
variant R8Q exhibited significantly higher ability to augment Wnt/TCF-b-catenin transcription, an activity that
could be of advantage in keratinocyte transformation.
Interestingly, as indicated above, this variant inhibited
stratification and differentiation of human keratinocytes;
an event associated with the initial stages of keratinocytes transformation. Additional studies are needed to
determine how enhancement of the canonical Wnt
pathway by E6 contributes to transformation of human
keratinocytes.
The underlying mechanisms for the differential phenotypes triggered by the various E6 proteins with respect
to differentiation, anoikis and Wnt signaling augmentation remain to be determined. Differential binding to
and altered expression of E6 targets involved in apoptosis [49] keratinocyte differentiation [32,33] and Wnt signaling [46,47,50] could be the reason for the
observations described here.

Conclusion
The aim of this study was to discover whether low prevalence E6 variants differ from high prevalence types in
their oncogenic abilities. We found that rare variants
similar to common variants exhibit significant activities
in various assays relevant to cervical carcinogenesis.
Based on our data in this and a previous study [26] several differences between the high and low prevalence
types in biological activities were identified, but none of
the activities were exclusively distinctive for either
group. The common types may differ from the rare
types in other biological functions relevant to transformation and development of cancer that were not tested
in this study [4,5]. However, it is also possible that other
determinants influence the prevalence of distinct viral
variants in cancer, such as rates of transmission and
persistence in certain populations (which depends on
host genetic factors and immunogenicity) [4,5,20].
Indeed, both HLA type and E6 variation were shown to
influence immune recognition by T lymphocytes,
thereby impacting on prevalence of E6 variants in cervical cancer [12,51,52]. Thus both genetic factors in populations and functional activities of E6 variants likely
contribute to cervical carcinogenesis. Based on the current data, low prevalence of distinct E6 variants in cervical cancer may not necessarily correlate with their
carcinogenic potential. This data is important for the
understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HPVs

and also have clinical implications for the management
of HPV infected patients and future vaccine design.
