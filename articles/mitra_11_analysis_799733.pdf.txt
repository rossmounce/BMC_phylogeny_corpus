Abstract
Background: Metagenomics is a rapidly growing field of research aimed at studying assemblages of uncultured
organisms using various sequencing technologies, with the hope of understanding the true diversity of microbes,
their functions, cooperation and evolution. There are two main approaches to metagenomics: amplicon
sequencing, which involves PCR-targeted sequencing of a specific locus, often 16S rRNA, and random shotgun
sequencing. Several tools or packages have been developed for analyzing communities using 16S rRNA sequences.
Similarly, a number of tools exist for analyzing randomly sequenced DNA reads.
Results: We describe an extension of the metagenome analysis tool MEGAN, which allows one to analyze 16S
sequences. For the analysis all 16S sequences are blasted against the SILVA database. The result output is imported
into MEGAN, using a synonym file that maps the SILVA accession numbers onto the NCBI taxonomy.
Conclusions: Environmental samples are often studied using both targeted 16S rRNA sequencing and random
shotgun sequencing. Hence tools are needed that allow one to analyze both types of data together, and one such
tool is MEGAN. The ideas presented in this paper are implemented in MEGAN 4, which is available from: http://
www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/megan.

Background
Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a
assemblage of organisms, obtained from a common habitat or an environmental sample of microbes. With the progress in the throughput and cost-efficiency of sequencing
technology, there is a rapid increase in the number and
scope of metagenomic projects. Two possible ways to analyze the taxonomic content of an environmental sample
are either to perform a random shotgun sequencing of the
DNA of the sample, or to use a targeted approach in
which only one particular gene is amplified and
sequenced. The latter is sometimes called amplicon
sequencing.
As rRNA gene sequences are present in all living cells,
these sequences (16S or 18S rRNA) are widely used for

phylogenetic studies and also as the target of amplicon
sequencing [1,2]. There are a number of tools for the
analysis and comparison of 16S or 18S data, such as
DOTUR [3], MOTHUR [4], SINA aligner at the SILVA
website [5], RDP [6] and EstimateS [7]. More recent tools
include MLtreemap [8], UniFrac [9] and pplacer [10] and
QIIME [11].
MEGAN (“MEtaGenome ANalyzer”) [12] is widely
used to perform the taxonomic and functional analysis
of large metagenomic datasets. Previous versions of
MEGAN could only be applied to random shotgun
sequences. One of the new features released with the
version 4 of MEGAN [13,14] is the ability to analyze
16S sequences. The aim of this paper is to describe this
new approach in more detail.
We will illustrate how to apply MEGAN4 to rRNA
sequences using an example dataset of ≈ 4000 published
16S sequences from [15] (obtained from a set of mice
children and referred here as ‘mice-data’). The ideas

presented in this paper are quite simple. The main merit
of this work lies in the integrated implementation of the
methods in the form of a user-friendly program, which
can be used by biologists to analyze their 16S datasets
in the context of other types of datasets.

archive from [17]. Beside the scientific name this file
includes synonyms, equivalent names and misspellings.
Those additional notations provide a higher chance for
successful name matching. A part of this file is shown
in Figure 2.

Methods
The aim of this work is to support the analysis of the
result of a BLAST comparison of 16S rRNA against the
SILVA database. SILVA result files do not contain the
information on the species and/or the strain from which
a reference sequence was obtained. Hence, we created a
mapping file that maps SILVA accession numbers to corresponding NCBI taxon IDs. This mapping file is used by
the “accession lookup” feature of MEGAN4 to identify
the related species. An advantage of this approach is that
no modification to the original SILVA database are
required and it is possible to include additional information on the species/strain name when creating the mapping file. Moreover the mapping file is very small and can
be updated with ease.

Mapping algorithm

Data extraction from the SILVA-ARB file and the NCBI file

To create the mapping file some information on the
SILVA sequences such as accession numbers, the corresponding full taxonomic path and species/strains information are needed. A file containing these information
can be created by exporting the SILVA database using
the ARB-software (Available at: [16]). The entries are
exported using the “NDS field export” function. A part of
the final data file (referred to as the SILVA file) is presented in Figure 1.
In addition, the algorithm also requires the input of a
file containing a mapping between NCBI taxon IDs and
the associated NCBI taxon names. For this purpose we
downloaded the ‘names.dmp’ file (referred to as the
NCBI taxonomy file) contained in the ‘taxdmp.zip’

Our simple mapping algorithm starts by computing a
hash map between all NCBi taxon names, synonyms,
equivalents names and missing spellings, on the one
hand, and all corresponding taxon IDs, on the other.
Then each entry in the SILVA file is compared against
the NCBI map. If a match to a taxon name is found,
then the Silva entry is mapped to that taxon, unless the
taxon name contains one of the keywords ‘uncultured’,
‘unidentified’ or ‘metagenome’, in which case the lowest
taxon entry from the SILVA full taxa description is
taken. If neither case is successful, then we change the
capitalization of the Silva entry and retry the matching
step.
The algorithm is illustrated by the examples in Table
1. When a species name is supplied, as in the first
example, the algorithm tries to find this name in the
NCBI map and then writes the corresponding NCBI ID
for this name and the Accession ID of the read to the
mapping file. In this example, a match was found. The
Accession AB365303 is assigned to the NCBI ID
336503, which represents Homalopoma granuliferum,
and is written to the mapping file.
As a second example (Table 1), the keyword ‘uncultured’ appears in the species name. In such a situation
the taxonomic path is used to assigning this read to a
taxa. To be precise, the lowest taxonomic entry which is
in this case Fusibacter is considered. This name is found
in the NCBI hash map and the read assigned to the ID
76008. If there was no hit for Fusibacter, the next higher
taxonomic entry would be used for searching (in this

case: Family XII Incertae Sedis). If this search also failed
to find a hit, then this procedure is repeated until the
highest taxonomic entry for this read (here: Bacteria) is
reached and a hit is to be expected.
The last case illustrates an example of combining two
unwanted keywords (Table 1). In the species name the
keyword ‘uncultured’ again appears. The lowest taxonomic entry is also rejected by the searchFullTaxamethod because the keyword ‘environmental samples’ is
detected. So this read is finally assigned to NCBI ID for
Nematoda.
Test dataset

In order to test the analysis method with the created
mapping file first we used published 16S sequences from
[15] (≈ 4000 reads obtained from mouse guts (all mice
children data) referred to here as ‘mice-data’).
First the ‘mice-data’ is aligned against the SILVA ribosomal RNA sequence database [5] using a variant (BLASTN)
of the program BLAST [18]. Furthermore, we aligned the
dataset against NCBI-NR database (of non-redundant protein sequences [19]) using BLASTX, expecting to see no
hits as the NR database is not supposed to contain any
16S sequences, as it is a database of protein sequences. For
both the cases for aligning the sequences using BLAST we
used a very relaxed threshold in order to allow almost all
the mappings. But while importing it in MEGAN we used
a threshold of Min Score=120, Top Percent=10 and Min
Support=5, which enables a conservative assignment.

Importing datasets in MEGAN 4 using the mapping file

When importing BLAST output files produced by comparing against SILVA database some adjustments need
to be made in comparison to the case of regular BLAST
files compared against NCBI. After selecting the BLAST
output file in the Import from BLAST-menu item the
option Use Synonyms needs to be enabled in the
Advanced-tab, providing the previously described mapping file (as shown in Figure 3).
This tells MEGAN4 to use the mapping file to assign
the accession number of a hit in the BLAST output file
to a taxa, before trying to make taxon names. Before
opening “regular” BLAST output files these changes
must be revoked.
Comparison with other services

To compare the performance of the MEGAN4 analysis
based on a BLASTN comparison of the reads against the
SILVA database, we applied a number of different analysis
tools to the mice-data. In more detail, we ran the data
through the RDP web server [6] (using ‘Confidence
threshold’: 80%) and the SINA aligner at the SILVA website (using default settings) [5], and a Greengene-, RDPand SILVA-based analysis offered by MG-RAST web
service [20] (all analyses are as of July 12, 2011). For MGRAST analyses the e-value cutoff for sequences matches
to these annotation sources (Greengene/RDP/SILVA) was
set to 1 × 104 with a Min. % Identity Cutoff as 90%. We
didn’t specify minimum alignment length in order to allow

all the assignments with previous threshold. We extracted
our result at genus level in order to compare the analyses
in depth. As MG-RAST does not produce a result in a
hierarchical structure we certainly loose many hits that
couldn’t attain the threshold at ‘genus level’. For comparison purpose we put those reads that are not available at
‘genus level’ analysis as ‘No hits’.
MEGAN4 is able to directly import the results obtain
from the RDP website and also the results obtained from
the SILVA website. For importing the the SILVA result
users need to select Import from BLAST-menu item using
the option Use Synonyms as mentioned above. For RDP
analysis results users need to download the resulting text

file from the “Classifier:: Assignment detail” page. For
importing the analysis directly from SILVA website, users
need to download the “log file” after running the website’s
aligner. MEGAN 4 is then able to read both the files using
the standard ‘Import from BLAST’ dialog. MG-RAST
results can be saved and imported using an importer for
CSV (comma separated value) files (using only two columns ‘genus’ and ‘abundance of reads’ without any header).

assigned to a taxon, and this was usually because the
‘min score’ threshold was not reached. While in some
cases the taxonomic assignment based on NR was the
same as the one obtained using an appropriate method,
in most cases the assignment to was to a taxon that
is probably incorrect. One of the best examples of
the wrong assignment using NCBI-NR is the node Oryza
(21 reads mapped to an unknown protein [Oryza sativa

probability of observing random hits with an alignment

Figure 6 Comparison of the taxonomic analysis of a 16S rRNA dataset [15], computed using six different approaches: MEGAN4’s BLASTN-based
SILVA analysis, the RDP website’s classifier [6], MG-RAST’s RDP-based approach [21], the SILVA website’s aligner [5], MG-RAST’s Greengene based
approach and MG-RAST’s SILVA based approach targeting the SSU gene. In this figure, the bar charts on higher-rank nodes reflect the total
number of reads assigned to the corresponding node or to any of the nodes in the subtree below the node.

of 16S rRNA sequences that are falsely assumed to be
protein-coding genes.
An important practical implication of this study is that
one should remove all rRNA sequences from a random
shotgun dataset before performing an NCBI-NR based
analysis, as they will lead to false positive assignments.
Comparison with other methods

In Figure 6 we show the comparison of the MEGAN 4’s
SILVA-based analysis of 16S rRNA reads (depicted in
Figure 4), with analyses produced using the other services
mentioned above. All the nodes are scaled by the summarized value (sum of the reads to a particular node and
the related children nodes). Only for MG-RAST results it
was not possible to achieve the hierarchical assignments.
Here we generally see a good correlation between all the
analyses. In some cases where MEGAN can not attain a
high number of hits at genus level (for example Oscillibacter), the reads are assigned to a higher level to meet
the threshold.

Conclusions
Metagenomics is a fast growing field and novel tools are
required to analyze the ever growing datasets. Amplicon
sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene is widely used
for estimating the taxonomic structure of environmental
bacterial assemblages. MEGAN 4, already widely used
for analyzing random shotgun sequences, can now also
be used for 16S rRNA, allowing the direct comparison
of taxonomic profiles obtained from different types of
data, and different methods.
