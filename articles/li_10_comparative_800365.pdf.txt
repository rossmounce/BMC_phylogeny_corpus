Comparative genomics reveals conservative
evolution of the xylem transcriptome in vascular
plants
Xinguo Li, Harry X Wu*, Simon G Southerton*

Abstract
Background: Wood is a valuable natural resource and a major carbon sink. Wood formation is an important
developmental process in vascular plants which played a crucial role in plant evolution. Although genes involved
in xylem formation have been investigated, the molecular mechanisms of xylem evolution are not well understood.
We use comparative genomics to examine evolution of the xylem transcriptome to gain insights into xylem
evolution.
Results: The xylem transcriptome is highly conserved in conifers, but considerably divergent in angiosperms. The
functional domains of genes in the xylem transcriptome are moderately to highly conserved in vascular plants,
suggesting the existence of a common ancestral xylem transcriptome. Compared to the total transcriptome
derived from a range of tissues, the xylem transcriptome is relatively conserved in vascular plants. Of the xylem
transcriptome, cell wall genes, ancestral xylem genes, known proteins and transcription factors are relatively more
conserved in vascular plants. A total of 527 putative xylem orthologs were identified, which are unevenly
distributed across the Arabidopsis chromosomes with eight hot spots observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
evolution of the xylem transcriptome has paralleled plant evolution. We also identified 274 conifer-specific xylem
unigenes, all of which are of unknown function. These xylem orthologs and conifer-specific unigenes are likely to
have played a crucial role in xylem evolution.
Conclusions: Conifers have highly conserved xylem transcriptomes, while angiosperm xylem transcriptomes are
relatively diversified. Vascular plants share a common ancestral xylem transcriptome. The xylem transcriptomes of
vascular plants are more conserved than the total transcriptomes. Evolution of the xylem transcriptome has largely
followed the trend of plant evolution.

Background
The evolution of xylem was a critical step that allowed
vascular plants to colonize vast areas of the earth’s terrestrial surface. Xylem plays an essential role in the
transport of water and nutrients and provides mechanical support for vascular plants. Herbaceous vascular
plants develop primary xylem, and woody plants also
produce secondary xylem (or wood). Evolution from
tracheids to vessels reflects a more efficient way for
angiosperms to develop secondary xylem [1-3]. Primary
xylem consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and
proteins, while secondary xylem contains higher

amounts of cellulose and lignin. From a practical point
of view, wood represents a renewable natural resource
for the timber, fibre and biofuel industries and it is a
major carbon sink in natural ecosystems.
In the last few decades the molecular basis of xylem
formation and evolution has been investigated. Syringyl
(S) lignin biosynthesis was found to be an evolved lignin
pathway in angiosperms, representing an addition to the
ancient and predominant guaiacyl (G) lignin pathway
conserved in land plants [3-6]. However, the S lignin
pathway was also recently observed in lycophytes [7],
suggesting a complex evolutionary history of lignin biosynthesis in vascular plants. Genes involved in wood formation have been identified in many plant species
[8-13], allowing investigation of xylem evolution at the

transcriptome level. A core xylem gene set was identified in white spruce among which 31 transcripts are
highly conserved in Arabidopsis [14]. The expanding
genomic resources of model plant species [15-18] are
invaluable for exploring many aspects of plant development and evolution, including xylem formation and evolution. Recent studies suggest whole-genome duplication
and reorganization [15-17] have been a major driving
force in plant evolution.
Comparative genomics is a powerful tool for investigating plant evolution at the whole-genome level [19-27].
Lower collinearity across dicots and monocots [16,21] and
lineage-specific genes have been observed using comparative genomics [28,29]. Comparisons between rice and Arabidopsis showed that 50% of the rice genome was
homologous to Arabidopsis [16], while as much as 88% of
the poplar genome shares homology with Arabidopsis
[17]. Comparative genomics of poplar with Arabidopsis
revealed at least 11,666 protein-coding genes were present
in the ancestral eurosid genome [17]. The recently
sequenced Selaginella moellendorffii [30], moss [31] and
Eucalyptus grandis [18] genomes provide new opportunities for comparative genomics in vascular plants.
Many commercial crops and forest trees do not have
sequenced genomes; thus, comparative genomics in
these species must rely on studies of the transcriptome
(expressed sequence tags, ESTs). Using a transcriptome
approach about half of loblolly pine xylem unigenes did
not match Arabidopsis unigenes [32], and 39-45% of
pine contigs had no hits in the genomes of Arabidopsis,
rice and poplar [33]. In white spruce and sitka spruce
between 30 and 36% of the unigenes lacked homologs
in poplar, Arabidopsis and rice [12,33]. Similar results
were also observed in other comparisons between gymnosperms and angiosperms [19,34]. By contrast, comparison of different gymnosperm species revealed highly
conserved transcriptomes. For example, about 84% of
the white spruce transcripts had matches in the Pine
Gene Index [12], and 60-80% of spruce contigs had
homologs in loblolly pine and other gymnosperms [33].
Although comparative genomics has increased our
understanding of plant evolution at the genome level,
most studies to date have focussed on the entire genome sequence, and/or mixed EST resources developed
from a range of tissues. In order to examine xylem evolution in vascular plants we focused our attention on
genes expressed specifically in xylem. We selected ten
species which represent different categories of vascular
plants, including gymnosperms (pine and spruce),
angiosperms (woody dicots, herbaceous dicots, and
monocots) and lycophytes. The non-vascular plant moss
was included as a reference for xylem evolution. Up-todate public genome sequences and xylem transcriptomes
of selected plant species were used for comparative

genomic analysis, aiming to explore the evolution of the
xylem transcriptome in vascular plants.

Results
The xylem transcriptome is highly conserved in conifer
species

We compared the xylem transcriptomes among different
conifer species (radiata pine, loblolly pine and white
spruce), and analysed the homologs between conifer
xylem transcriptomes and the xylem (or entire) transcriptomes or genomes of angiosperms, lycophytes and
moss (Additional file 1A-D and Figure 1A-B). At the
nucleotide level 63-66% (E ≤ 10-50) and 78-82% (E ≤ 105
) of radiata pine xylem unigenes have homologs in the
xylem transcriptomes of loblolly pine and white spruce
(Additional file 1A). A higher proportion (74-89% at E ≤
1e-50, or 93-95% at E ≤ 1e-5) had homologs in the
entire transcriptomes of conifers based on gene indices
of pine and spruce (Additional file 1A). These results
suggest that radiata pine xylem unigenes are highly conserved as full (E ≤ 10-50) or partial sequences (E ≤ 10-5)
in other conifer species. Additional analysis with loblolly
pine and white spruce nucleotide sequences (Additional
file 1A) revealed similarly high percentages of homologs
in other conifer species. Using deduced amino acid
sequences more than 58% (E ≤ 10-50) or 79% (E ≤ 10-5)
of the radiata pine xylem transcriptome are conserved
as functional genes or domains in the three conifer species. Comparisons of average percentage of homologs
among different conifers (Figure 1A-B) further confirmed that the xylem transcriptomes are highly conserved in conifers at both the nucleotide (67% at E ≤ 1e50, 81% at E ≤ 1e-5) and deduced amino acid sequences
(58% at E ≤ 1e-50, 84% at E ≤ 1e-5).
Conifer xylem transcriptomes are significantly distinct
from the xylem transcriptome or genomes of angiosperms, lycophytes and moss (Additional file 1A-B). For
example, at the nucleotide level only 1-4% (E ≤ 1e-50)
and 15-32% (E ≤ 1e-5) of radiata pine xylem unigenes
have homologs in angiosperms, Selaginella and moss.
Furthermore, average percentage of homologs between
conifer xylem transcriptomes and angiosperms (xylem
transcriptome or entire genome) at the nucleotide level
is only 2% (E ≤ 1e-50) or 23% (E ≤ 1e-5) (Figure 1A);
while even lower percentages (1% or 16%) are observed
between conifers and Selaginella & moss. Comparisons
between two xylem transcriptomes would be expected
to reveal fewer homologs than comparisons between a
xylem transcriptome and a total transcriptome or a
whole genome. The low percentage of homologs
detected is statistically significant (P < 0.001) compared
to the high percentage of matches among conifer xylem
transcriptomes. Unsurprisingly, the deduced amino acid
sequences of conifer xylem unigenes have relatively

Figure 1 Comparisons of conifer xylem unigenes with genes in other species. Xylem unigenes of radiata pine, loblolly pine and white
spruce were blasted using blastn (A) and blastx (or tblastx) (B) against xylem unigenes, gene indices, gene models or scaffolds of other plant
species. Percentage of hits is presented on the Y-axis at three E-value cut-offs (0, 1e-50 and 1e-5). Eleven databases used for blasts are presented
on the X-axis, including pine (PGI) (1) and spruce gene indices (SGI) (2), loblolly pine (3), white spruce (4) and poplar (5) xylem unigenes,
Eucalyptus scaffolds (7), and gene models of poplar (6), Arabidopsis (8), rice (9), Selaginella (10) and moss (11), respectively. These databases
include four plant groups: conifers (1-4), angiosperms (woody 5-7 and herbaceous 8-9), Selaginella (10) and the non-vascular plant, moss (11).

more homologs in non-coniferous plants (Additional file
1B and Figure 1B). However, they are still significantly
(P < 0.001) lower than the homologous xylem unigenes
among the three conifers.
We further examined the nucleotide identity of homologous unigenes in the xylem transcriptomes of different
conifers as well as homologs between conifer xylem transcriptomes and unigenes of other plant species. The
nucleotide identity between radiata pine and loblolly pine
is consistently higher (97.5%) at different E-value cut-offs
ranging from 0 to 1e-5, than between radiata pine and
the two spruce species (91%) (Additional file 1C). By contrast, lower nucleotide identity (81-83%) was observed in
the homologs between radiata pine and angiosperms
(Populus, Arabidopsis and rice) or moss. Similar results
were also observed in the analyses with loblolly pine
(Additional file 1C). The average nucleotide identity of
homologous xylem unigenes in different conifers is about
92%, significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the homologs
between conifers and angiosperms & moss (about 82%)
(Additional file 1D). Thus, comparisons of nucleotide
identity provide further evidence of the higher conservation of the xylem transcriptomes in conifers and its divergence in angiosperms and other plants.
The xylem transcriptome has evolved considerably in
angiosperms

Poplars are woody angiosperms and are used as a model
tree species for wood formation. Surprisingly, at the
level of nucleotide sequence less than 5% of poplar
xylem unigenes have homologs (E ≤ 1e-50) in the

scaffolds or gene models of other woody and herbaceous
angiosperms (Eucalyptus, Arabidopsis and rice) (Figure
2A). Poplar xylem unigenes also have few homologs (E
≤ 1e-50) in the gene indices of pine or spruce and in
the gene models of Selaginella and moss (Figure 2A).
These results suggest that the poplar xylem transcriptome is distinct compared to other vascular and nonvascular plants. Because gene models of a species represent its entire genome which includes the xylem transcriptome, the few homologs shared between the poplar
xylem transcriptome and gene models of other angiosperms suggest that the xylem transcriptome has undergone considerable evolution in angiosperms. This
contrasts with the highly conserved xylem transcriptomes in gymnosperms observed earlier (Additional file
1A-D and Figure 1A-B). The entire genome of poplar is
also unique at the nucleotide level among the species
examined in this study (Figure 2A). However, the functional gene sequences of the poplar xylem transcriptome
and its entire genome (Figure 2B) are moderately (3650% at E ≤ 1e-50) conserved, while their functional
domains are highly conserved (77-85% at E ≤ 1e-5) in
other vascular and non-vascular plants. Clearly, all land
plants share an ancestral xylem transcriptome which
may have been largely involved in cell wall biosynthesis
in ancient non-vascular plants.
The xylem transcriptome is relatively more conserved in
vascular plants

We examined the pattern of the xylem transcriptome
evolution by comparing it with the total transcriptome

Figure 2 Comparisons of genes between poplar and other species. Poplar xylem unigenes and gene models (nucleotide or protein
sequences) were blasted with blastn (A) and tblastn (or blastp) (B) against gene indices, gene models or scaffolds of other plant species.
Percentage of hits is presented on the Y-axis at three E-value cut-offs (0, 1e-50 and 1e-5). Seven databases used for blasts are presented on the
X-axis, including pine (PGI) (1) and spruce gene indices (SGI) (2), Eucalyptus scaffolds (3), and gene models of Arabidopsis (4), rice (5), Selaginella
(6) and moss (7), respectively. These databases include four plant groups: conifers (1-2), angiosperms (woody 3 and herbaceous 4-5), Selaginella
(6) and moss (7).

derived from a range of tissues. Although the xylem
transcriptomes of pine, spruce and poplar have few
homologs in the gene models of Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss (1.2-5% at E ≤ 1e-50), there are about
two to four times more homologs than there are for the
total transcriptome (Figure 3). When using a lower
stringency E-value (≤ 1e-5), the xylem transcriptomes of
pine, spruce and poplar have more homologs (about 2060%) in the above four model species compared to the
total transcriptome (9-34%). Thus, at the nucleotide
level the xylem transcriptome is relatively more conserved in vascular and non-vascular plants. Notably both
the conifer xylem and total transcriptomes have few
homologs in poplar (a woody species) and herbaceous
species (Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss)
(Figure 3), suggesting conifer transcriptomes are distinct
from other land plants.
The conservative evolution of the xylem transcriptome
was more clearly observed when using deduced amino
acid sequences (Figure 3). For example, 37-46% of the
conifer xylem transcriptome matched the genomes of
angiosperms (Populus, Arabidopsis and rice), lycophyte
and moss; nearly two times more than the matches with
the total conifer transcriptome. Similar results were also
obtained with the poplar xylem transcriptome in the

comparisons with the total transcriptome. Therefore,
the functional gene sequences in the xylem transcriptome are significantly more conserved in vascular plants
than that in the total transcriptome.
Different functional gene groups have distinct patterns of
evolution

We divided the xylem transcriptome into different functional gene groups for investigating their diverse patterns of evolution. We defined xylem unigenes with
matches (blastx, E ≤ 1e-5) in the moss gene models as
ancestral xylem genes, and those with no matches as
vascular plant-specific xylem (VSX) genes. Among the
ancestral xylem genes derived from radiata pine, loblolly
pine and white spruce, 96-99%, 78-94% and 48-60% (E ≤
1e-5), or 41-48%, 20-26% and 28-35% (E ≤ 1e-50),
respectively, have homologs (blastx) in the genomes of
the three angiosperms and the lycophyte (Figure 4A-C).
In contrast, only 8-28% (E ≤ 1e-5) and 0.4-1% (E ≤ 1e50) of the conifer VSX genes are homologous to the
genomes of these model vascular plants (Figure 4A-C).
These results suggest that the ancestral xylem genes are
moderately to highly conserved in non-coniferous vascular plants, while considerable divergence has occurred in
VSX genes among conifers, angiosperms and lycophytes.

Figure 3 The xylem transcriptome is relatively more conserved in vascular and non-vascular plants. Xylem gene indices and total gene
indices of pine, spruce and poplar were blasted (blastn and blastx) against the gene models of Populus, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss.
Percentage of hits is presented on the Y-axis at E-value cut-offs of 1e-50 and 1e-5. Statistical tests for the different number of hits observed with
xylem and total gene indices were performed assuming a binomial distribution. All comparisons showed statistical significances (P < 0.001) (data
not show for the simplicity of the figure) except for two comparisons between conifer species and poplar (blastn at 1e-50).

Similar patterns were observed in the comparisons of
VSX and ancestral xylem genes with the poplar xylem
transcriptome (Figure 4D).
Cell wall genes were identified according to the CellWallNavigator [35] and MAIZEWALL [36] databases.
We compared the level of conservation of cell wall
genes to non-cell-wall genes (Figure 4A-D). In the four
woody species (radiata pine, loblolly pine, white spruce
and poplar) the cell wall genes have 1.5 to two times
more homologs than the non-cell-wall genes in the genomes of the four herbaceous model plants (Figure 4AD). This suggests that cell wall genes have been highly
conserved across diverse land plants. Comparisons of
transcription factors (TFs) (based on PlantTFDB [37])
with non-TFs and known functional genes with
unknowns revealed significantly more conservation of
transcription factors and known functional genes among
different groups of vascular and non-vascular plants
(Additional file 2A-D).
Identification of putative xylem orthologs in vascular
plants

Putative xylem orthologs conserved in diverse plant
groups were identified using deduced amino acid or protein sequences (Additional file 3), and their numbers are
briefly presented at two E-value cut-offs (≤ 1e-50 and ≤
1e-5) in Figure 5. The xylem orthologs (9,164 at E ≤ 1e-5

or 3,460 at E ≤ 1e-50) shared by loblolly pine, white
spruce and sitka spruce represent a common gene set
expressed in conifer wood formation. While the xylem
orthologs common to the three conifers and poplar
(6,641 at E ≤ 1e-5 or 1,339 at E ≤ 1e-50) are putative
woody plant xylem orthologs. Surprisingly, the number
of putative xylem orthologs in deeper plant groupings is
only slightly smaller (Figure 5), suggesting that very limited numbers of xylem orthologs are specific to each
plant group. The majority (93-96%) of the vascular plant
xylem orthologs have matches in the gene models of a
non-vascular plant (moss). This suggests that the xylem
transcriptome of vascular plants has largely evolved from
a subset of genes found in non-vascular plants. This is
likely to be a group of genes predominantly involved in
cell wall biosynthesis that have been recruited to synthesize secondary xylem in higher plants.
Of the 1,003 loblolly pine xylem unigenes with homologs (tblastx or blastx, E ≤ 1e-50) in the six vascular plants,
94% and 100% have hits in the UniProt known proteins
and TIGR gene indices databases, respectively, and 94%
are assigned with GO terms (Additional file 3). Among
these unigenes 349 (35%) were identified as cell wall
genes, and the largest gene families are tubulin (16 unigenes) and cellulose synthase (CesA) (10). Several primary
wall genes are abundant including pectate lyase (8), pectinesterase (7), XET (7), expansin (6) and peroxidase (5).

Figure 4 Cell wall genes and ancestral xylem genes are relatively more conserved in diverse plants. Putative cell wall, non-cell-wall,
vascular plant-specific xylem (VSX) and ancestral xylem genes within xylem unigenes of radiata pine, loblolly pine, white spruce and poplar were
blasted with gene indices (tblastx) of pine and spruce, and gene models (blastx) of poplar, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss. Percentage of
hits is presented on the Y-axis at three E-value cut-offs (0, 1e-50 and 1e-5). Different numbers of hits observed with cell wall and non-cell-wall
genes, as well as with VSX and ancestral xylem genes were statistically tested assuming a binomial distribution. All comparisons showed
statistical significances (P < 0.001) (data not show for the simplicity of the figure) except for a few between conifers at 1e-5.

Lignin biosynthesis-related genes are well represented in
the cell wall gene lists, including SAMS (11), laccase (9),
methionine synthase (cobalamin-independent) (6), 4CL (3),
COMT (2), CAD (2) and CCoAMT (3). In addition, 49
transcription factors were found, including NAC, PHD,
HB, MYB, LIM, CCCH, etc. The large number of transcription factors suggests that wood formation involves
considerable transcriptional regulation. Interestingly,
aquaporins (16 unigenes) is one of the largest gene
families in the 1,003 unigenes, reflecting their central
importance in water transport in xylem.
The 1,003 loblolly pine xylem unigenes have between
749 and 894 close homologs (blastx or tblastx, E ≤ 1e50) in white spruce, sitka spruce, poplar, Arabidopsis,
rice and Selaginella, with 527 xylem orthologs common
to the above 6 species. These common xylem orthologs
matched (blastx, E ≤ 1e-50) 501 unique gene models in
moss, indicating that at least 501 ancestral xylem

orthologs are shared in land plants. We also identified
all loci in Arabidopsis and rice with homology to the
1,003 loblolly pine xylem unigenes. All possible homologs in Arabidopsis are represented by 3,115 (E ≤ 1e-50)
or 6,563 unique loci (E ≤ 1e-5), and in rice by 3,057 or
8,458 unique loci. Based on the numbers of close homologs in Arabidopsis (785) and rice (776), an average of
4-8 and 4-11 paralogs may have arisen from each xylem
ortholog in these two species, respectively.
The xylem orthologs and paralogs are relatively evenly
distributed across the chromosomes of Arabidopsis and
poplar, but may be unevenly distributed among rice
chromosomes (Additional file 4). However, eight hot
spots were detected within the five Arabidopsis chromosomes (Figure 6A, B), which contrasts with the even distribution of all Arabidopsis genes across each
chromosome [38] (Figure 6C). These hot spots may be a
result of gene and chromosome duplication in

Figure 5 The number of putative xylem orthologs in different
plant groups. Loblolly pine xylem unigenes (18,320) were blasted
using tblastx against the unigenes of white spruce and sitka spruce,
and the gene models of poplar, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and
moss. The number of putative xylem orthologs common to
different plant groups is presented at two E-value cut-offs (1e-50
and 1e-5). Conifers 1: loblolly pine plus white spruce; Conifers 2:
conifers 1 plus sitka spruce; Woody plants: conifers 2 plus poplar;
Seed plants 1: woody plants plus Arabidopsis; Seed plants 2: seed
plants 1 plus rice; Vascular plants: seed plants 2 plus Selaginella;
Land plants: vascular plants plus moss. The xylem orthologs shared
in conifers 2, woody plants, seed plant 1, seed plants 2 and vascular
plants represent genes specific to conifers, woody plants, seed
plants, lower seed plants (lacking secondary xylem) and vascular
plants, respectively. The high proportion of xylem orthologs
homologous to moss suggests that the ancestral xylem genome
was largely present in non-vascular plants.

Arabidopsis [15,39,40]. Within the chromosomes of rice
and poplar the xylem orthologs have a relatively even
distribution (Additional file 5A-C and 6A-C). Different
distribution patterns of the xylem orthologs among the
Arabidopsis, rice and poplar genomes may reflect their
diverse history of gene duplication and segmental chromosomal rearrangements.
Molecular evolution of xylem orthologs in vascular plants

We used the 501 ancestral xylem orthologs for phylogenetic analysis because they largely (95%) represent the
527 unique xylem orthologs and it allowed us to include
the non-vascular plant moss as a reference. Two slightly
different trees (Figure 7A-B) were constructed using
three alignment methods, two of which generated the
same tree configuration (Figure 7B). These trees clearly
separate angiosperms and gymnosperms from lycophytes
and moss. Based on tree B moss and Selaginella
emerged at the earliest time point followed by the two
conifers (loblolly pine and white spruce) and then by
the two dicots (poplar and Arabidopsis). The monocot
xylem transcriptome appears to be the most

chromosomes of Arabidopsis. The 1,003 loblolly pine xylem
unigenes highly conserved in other vascular plants (xylem
orthologs) have strong homology (1e-50) with 3,115 loci and
moderate homology (1e-5) with 6,563 loci in the Arabidopsis
genome. Positioning of these homologs on the five chromosomes
of Arabidopsis revealed eight hot spots of putative Arabidopsis xylem
orthologs. A: 3,115 highly homologous loci; B: 6,563 moderately
homologous loci; C: 6,000 randomly selected loci.

evolutionarily distinct. In summary, the phylogenetic
analysis suggests that molecular evolution of xylem
orthologs largely parallels the trend of plant evolution.
From individual phylogenetic trees of 501 ancestral
xylem orthologs, 235 (46.9%) genes showed an evolutionary pattern that generally followed the trend of plant
evolution (Figure 7C). These genes are likely more sensitive to evolutionary forces. Molecular evolution of
other xylem orthologs (266, 53.1%) did not closely
resemble the general pattern of plant evolution. A large
proportion of orthologs in this category (158, 31.5%)
had trees with similar patterns between angiosperms
(poplar, Arabidopsis and rice) and ancient plant species
(moss and/or Selaginella), but quite distinct branches
for the gymnosperms (pine and spruce) (Figure 7D).
These genes have possibly undergone slower evolution,
although considerable evolution appears to have
occurred within the gymnosperms. This type of genes
may have unique and important roles in softwood formation. Other orthologs (108, 21.6%) exhibit complex
evolutionary patterns which are poorly correlated with
plant evolution, suggesting that genetic shift might be a
major driven force for their evolution.
Using GO terms at various levels we compared gene
functions between xylem orthologs which paralleled and
diverged from plant evolution. Genes involved in cellular
components and biological process are significantly (Pvalue < 0.05) more abundant in the divergent orthologs

with a bootstrap of 1,000. Individual trees were also generated for each gene using CLC Genomic Workbench 3 (CLC bio, Denmark). Genes with
phylogenetic trees paralleled the trend of plant evolution (235, 47%) were present in an example (C) while genes that diverged from plant
evolution (266, 53%) had diverse patterns of molecular evolution. A representative phylogenetic tree of genes (158, 32%) with conserved
branches between angiosperms and ancient plant species but divergent branches to gymnosperms is showed in example (D).

(Additional file 7). Further analyses with GO terms at
lower levels (Additional file 7) suggest that genes
involved in ribosome, transporter activity and translation
tend to parallel plant evolution; while genes with functions in cell parts, binding and metabolic process have
distinct patterns of evolution. Among cell wall genes
4CL-like, XET and beta-galactosidase have a molecular
evolutionary pattern paralleling plant evolution. However, many other cell wall genes have not tightly followed plant evolution, such as CCoAMT, pectate lyase,

pectinesterase, sucrose synthase, actin, alpha tubulin,
COMT, CesA, FLA, laccase and peroxidase.
Identification of putative conifer-specific xylem genes

moss, as well as no hits in any other angiosperms in the
UniProt known protein database (blastx, E > 1e-5), were

identified as putative conifer-specific xylem unigenes
(Additional file 8). All conifer-specific xylem unigenes
are unknown protein sequences based on the UniProt
database, and only 16% were assigned with GO terms in
the TIGR gene index database. This contrasts with 94%
of the xylem orthologs annotated with GO terms. The
poor annotation of the conifer-specific xylem genes is
likely due to the intense functional characterisation of
genes that has taken place in angiosperms.
Of the conifer-specific xylem unigenes several relatively abundant transcripts have low homology to arabinogalactan-like proteins (AGPs), glycine/proline-rich
proteins (GPRP), metallothionein-like class II proteins,
neurofilament triplet H proteins, zinc finger proteins,
cytochrome c1, etc (Additional file 8). Genes with low
similarity to other cell wall proteins (such as alpha tubulin, cellulose synthase like and extensin-like proteins) are
present. The conifer-specific xylem unigenes also
include genes similar to transcription factors, i.e. Aux/
IAA, NAC, CCAAT-binding, WRKY, R2R3-MYB,
BHLH and CCAAT-binding (Additional file 8). These
conifer-specific xylem unigenes may share the functions
of related homologues, but some may have unique roles
in gymnosperm wood formation.

that their functional domains are moderately to highly
conserved in vascular plants. This is consistent with the
diversification of all vascular plants from a common
ancestor which is thought to have lived about 400 Ma
[42]. Some of these conserved patterns are also consistent
with comparisons using the total transcriptome in previous studies [32,43]. The conserved functional domains
of the xylem transcriptome suggest the existence of a
shared ancestral xylem transcriptome of vascular plants.
The common ancestral xylem transcriptome should be
present in the earliest ancient vascular plants, which
produced hilate/trilete spores during the Late Ordovician [44]. The lycophyte Selaginella is among the closest
living relatives of these plants and its xylem transcriptome is likely to resemble most closely the ancestral
xylem transcriptome. The 5,047 (27%) xylem unigenes
of loblolly pine with homologs (E ≤ 1e-5) in the six vascular plants including Selaginella could largely represent
the ancestral xylem transcriptome. Because the vast
majority (95%) of the ancestral xylem transcriptome has
homologs (E ≤ 1e-5) in the moss genome, the xylem
transcriptome is likely to have evolved largely from the
cell wall transcriptome of non-vascular plants, which
can be traced back as far as 450 Ma [31].

Discussion

Conservative evolution of the xylem transcriptome in
vascular plants

Gymnosperms and angiosperms have distinct patterns of
xylem transcriptome evolution

Our data revealed that the xylem transcriptome is highly
conserved in conifers but has undergone considerably
more diversification in angiosperms. This suggests the
xylem transcriptome has a distinct pattern of evolution
in angiosperms compared to gymnosperms. Pine and
spruce diverged 120-140 Ma [41], slightly earlier than
the radiation of angiosperms (100-120 Ma) [16,17]. The
rapid evolution of the angiosperm xylem transcriptome
suggests greater sensitivity to evolutionary forces in
flowering plants. Our results also showed that poplar
has a relatively distinct genome and xylem transcriptome, thus poplar is unlikely to be a useful model for
investigating wood formation and other developmental
processes in gymnosperms. Mechanisms underlying the
diverse patterns of xylem transcriptome evolution in
angiosperms and gymnosperms are not well understood.
Gene duplications and segmental chromosome rearrangements may be the major driving forces for this diversification; however, the role of genome size or gene
number remains unclear.
The common ancestor of the xylem transcriptome in
vascular plants

Our data demonstrated that the nucleotide and protein
sequences of the xylem transcriptome are highly diversified among different categories of vascular plants, but

Xylem functions in the transport of water and solutes
throughout the plant and together with the phloem
makes up the vascular transport tissues of plants. Our
data suggests that the xylem transcriptome is relatively
more conserved than the total transcriptome in vascular
plants. Several functional gene groups within the xylem
transcriptome are significantly more conserved among
vascular plants, including cell wall genes, ancestral
xylem genes, transcription factors and known protein
genes. This implies that xylem has evolved more slowly
compared to other organs of vascular plants such as
leaves, flowers and seeds. On the other hand, the
unknown function and VSX genes have been more
rapidly evolving in vascular plants. The rapid evolution
of VSX genes contrasts with the generally conservative
evolution of the total xylem transcriptome, suggesting
VSX genes are particularly sensitive to evolutionary
forces. These genes will be useful targets for functional
characterisation in order to understand xylem formation
and evolution in vascular plants.
Our data showed that the loblolly pine xylem transcriptome has significantly more homologs in spruce
(white spruce and sitka spruce) than in poplar and
Eucalyptus, thus it is possible to identify genes specific
to gymnosperm wood formation (softwoods). Interestingly, the number of homologs of the loblolly pine
xylem transcriptome in woody angiosperms (poplar and

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/190

Eucalyptus) is similar to that in herbaceous angiosperms
(Arabidopsis and rice), suggesting that evolution in a
small number of xylem genes in angiosperms gave rise
to woody plants. Furthermore, the number of homologs
of the conifer xylem transcriptome in angiosperms is
only slightly more than the number in lycophytes and
moss. The limited number of xylem genes specific to
woody plants suggests that differential transcriptional
regulation may have played an important role in xylem
evolution; in a similar way that transcriptional regulation
gives rise to plant diversity [20].
Comparison of gene expression between softwoods and
hardwoods

A previous study in Cryptomeria japonica identified 56
putative conifer-specific transcripts, including three specific to reproductive organs and one (unknown) specific
to woody tissues [45]. Here we identified 274 coniferspecific xylem unigenes, all of which are of unknown
function. Transcripts with low homology to some cell
wall genes (i.e. tubulin, CesA and AGP) are abundant or
present in the conifer-specific xylem unigenes (Additional file 8). These cell wall gene families may include
some unique members which are specific to conifer
wood formation. The identified conifer-specific xylem
genes could provide clues to the molecular processes
that give rise to the distinct cell wall structures and chemical properties of softwoods compared to hardwoods.
Genes related to lignin biosynthesis are not present in
the conifer-specific xylem unigenes, which is consistent
with the earlier conclusion that the conifer lignin pathway is conserved in other vascular plants [3].
Transcripts similar to arabinogalactan protein (AGP)
genes are the most abundant genes in the conifer-specific xylem unigenes. In loblolly pine six AGPs including
PtAGP4 were identified in xylem tissues [46] and 11
AGPs were identified in radiata pine. Radiata pine
PrAGP4 is highly abundant in earlywood [13] and preferentially transcribed in earlywood at different tree ages
across a rotation period [47]. The conifer-specific xylem
AGPs and AGP-like genes had no homologs with any of
the 47 AGPs of Arabidopsis [48-50]. AGPs are a large
class of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. Most AGPs
are anchored to the plasma membrane [48] and released
into the cell wall after cleavage of the GPI anchor [51].
AGPs may act as cell wall plasticizers, enlarging the pectin matrix, and allowing wall extension and cell expansion [52]. Radiata pine AGPs are located in the
compound middle lamella of newly developed tracheids
[53]. Expression of AGPs containing FLA domains has
recently been found to influence the mechanical
strength of stems of the herbaceous (Arabidopsis) and
woody (Eucalyptus) angiosperms [54]. However, fasciclin-like domains (FLAs) were not found in the AGP

Page 10 of 14

genes specific to conifer wood formation, suggesting different AGPs may have distinct roles in softwood and
hardwood formation.
We identified 527 xylem orthologs in vascular plants,
including many primary and secondary cell wall genes as
well as transcription factors. Conservation of cell wall
genes suggests that cell wall biosynthesis is a central event
in xylem formation in vascular plants. These xylem orthologs maintain the stability of the basic xylem machinery in
vascular plants and may regulate development of xylem
structures and properties shared by different vascular
plants, such as the common features of softwoods and
hardwoods. COMT was previously thought to be one of
three enzymes (F5H/Cald5 H, COMT and SAD) specifically involved in S lignin synthesis of angiosperms [3]. The
occurrence of COMT genes in the xylem orthologs of vascular plants suggests their involvement in diverse functions other than S lignin synthesis.

Conclusions
The xylem transcriptome is highly conserved in conifer
species, but the nucleotide sequences of the xylem transcriptome are significantly distinct among angiosperms,
thus considerable evolution of the xylem transcriptome
has occurred in angiosperms. The functional domains of
the xylem transcriptome are moderately to highly conserved among vascular and non-vascular plants. This
suggests that vascular plants share an ancestral xylem
transcriptome which is likely to have evolved predominantly from the cell wall transcriptome of non-vascular
plants. In comparison to the total transcriptome from a
wide range of tissues, the xylem transcriptome has
evolved conservatively in vascular plants. Several functional gene groups within the xylem transcriptome,
including cell wall genes, ancestral xylem genes, transcription factors and known function genes, are relatively
more conserved in vascular plants. A total of 527 xylem
orthologs of vascular plants and 274 conifer-specific
xylem genes were identified in this study. These genes
provide good candidates for molecular investigations of
xylem formation and evolution in softwoods (conifers)
and hardwoods (woody angiosperms). The uneven distribution of xylem orthologs within Arabidopsis chromosomes suggests genome rearrangements have played an
important role in xylem evolution. Phylogenetic analysis
of the 501 ancestral xylem orthologs suggests that molecular evolution of the xylem transcriptome has largely
paralleled the trend of plant evolution despite several
gene classes did not tightly track it.
Methods
Plant species

We selected ten species to represent three major classes
of vascular plants (gymnosperms, angiosperms and

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/190

lycophytes). Four conifer species: Pinus radiata (radiata
pine), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), Picea glauca (white
spruce) and Picea sitchensis (sitka spruce), represent
gymnosperms. Four species of dicots including Populus
tremula × Populus tremuloides (hybrid aspen), Populus
trichocarpa, Eucalyptus grandis and Arabidopsis thaliana, and one monocot (Oryza sativa, rice) represent
angiosperms. The recently sequenced Selaginella moellendorffii [30] represents lycophytes. The non-vascular
plant Physcomitrella patens (moss) was included as a
reference. The seven woody species (four conifer and
three woody dicot species) both undergo primary and
secondary xylem formation. Arabidopsis also develops
secondary xylem and has been used as a model system
for secondary xylem development [10,11,55-58]. The
monocot rice and the lycophyte S. moellendorffii only
produce primary xylem, while the non-vascular plant
moss has no xylem at all.
Public genomic resources

We previously developed a radiata pine xylem transcriptome resource with 3,304 xylem unigenes [13]. Unigenes
of loblolly pine, white spruce, sitka spruce, hybrid aspen,
P. trichocarpa, Arabidopsis, rice and moss were retrieved
from the NCBI UniGene database [59] (Additional file
9). The gene indices of pine, spruce and poplar (Additional file 9) were collected from the TIGR gene indices
database [60]. These gene indices represent the total
transcriptome from a wide range of tissues (such as
stem, shoots, xylem, leaves, flowers, bark, roots and
seeds, etc). A sub-set of xylem gene indices of pine,
spruce and poplar was separately retrieved from pure
xylem libraries. These included genes expressed in pure
xylem tissues, while genes expressed in mixed tissues of
xylem and phloem (such as shoots, cambial regions, etc)
were not considered as they were likely to contain
phloem-specific transcripts. After removing redundant
sequences a total of 14,527, 15,262 and 9,109 xylem
gene indices of pine, spruce and poplar were identified.
To minimize the bias in comparative genomics, pure
xylem gene indices were reassembled using the same
method and parameters as used in the EST assembly of
radiata pine [13]. A total of 18,320, 12,489 and 7,991
pure xylem unigenes were finally obtained for pine,
spruce and poplar, respectively.
The public transcriptome resources (unigenes and
gene indices) are unlikely to include all transcripts
expressed in xylem formation due to sampling limitations. Therefore, selected fully sequenced plant species
(P. trichocarpa, E. grandis, Arabidopsis, rice, S. moellendorffii and P. patens) were added for comparative genomics in this study (Additional file 9). Gene models of P.
trichocarpa, S. moellendorffii and P. patens (moss) were
downloaded from the JGI website [61]. E. grandis

Page 11 of 14

scaffolds were downloaded from EucalyptusDB [18]. A.
thaliana gene models were downloaded from the TAIR
website [62] and O. sativa gene models were downloaded from the MSU website [63]. Detailed information
on the public genomic resources used in this study is
listed in Additional file 9.
Comparative genomic analysis

Comparisons of sequences were performed locally using
the BlastStation2 software (TM software, Inc., CA) with
default parameters, including various blast programs
(blastn, tblastx, blastx, blastp and tblastn). Expectedvalue (E-value or E), sequence identity and bit scores
were collected for evaluating the similarity between two
sequences. Percentage of hits, average sequence identity
and average bit score at different E-value cut-offs were
calculated for the comparisons of transcriptomes or genomes between different plant species.
The E-value cut-offs for inferring sequence similarity
vary from 1e-3 [17,24] to 1e-50 [64,65], but 1e-10 to 1e30 have been widely used [19,32,43,66-69]. To ensure
high confidence as previously suggested [64] and to
increase the likelihood of inferring biological significance, we used the following thresholds of E-values: (a)
E = 0, the two sequences are identical and considered to
derive from the same gene; (b) 1e-50 ≤ E < 0, the two
sequences are highly similar and likely to be from the
same gene family; (c) 1e-5 ≤ E < 1e-50, the two
sequences are similar in one or more regions along the
whole sequence and likely to contain the same functional domain(s) or motif(s); (d) E < 1e-5, the two
sequences are likely to be unrelated genes. As a general
rule, E ≤ 1e-50 was interpreted in this study to indicate
whole sequence similarity of two given sequences (gene
conservation or apparent homologs); and 1e-5 to 1e-50
was interpreted to indicate partial sequence similarity
(domain or motif conservation). Possible influences of
different blast programs and the size of databases were
not considered in setting the above E-value thresholds.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the ancestral xylem orthologs
was carried out using the predicted amino acid
sequences of loblolly pine and white spruce, and protein
sequences from the five model species (poplar, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss). For each species all
these sequences were combined into one sequence. The
sequences from the above 7 species were aligned using
three methods: ClustalX2, Kalign and Mafft [70] with
default settings. Phylogenetic trees were created using
the neighbour-joining algorithm with a bootstrap of
1,000. Sequences of individual genes were also used to
build phylogenetic trees using CLC Genomics Workbench 3 (CLC bio, Denmark). All individual trees were

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:190

visually compared with the trees from the combined
sequence data.

Additional file 1: Comparisons of xylem unigenes in conifers and
genes in other species. The xylem transcriptomes of radiata pine,
loblolly pine and white spruce were blasted using blastn (A) and blastx
(or tblastx) (B) against xylem unigenes, gene indices, gene models or
scaffolds of other plant species. Eleven databases were used for blasts
and presented on the X-axis, including pine (PGI) (1) and spruce gene
indices (SGI) (2), xylem unigenes of loblolly pine (3), white spruce (4) and
poplar (5), poplar gene models (6), Eucalyptus scaffolds (7), and gene
models of Arabidopsis (8), rice (9), Selaginella (10) and moss (11). These
databases include four plant groups: conifers (1-4), angiosperms (woody
5-7 and herbaceous 8-9), Selaginella (10) and the non-vascular plant,
moss (11). Percentage of hits is presented on the Y-axis at three E-value
cut-offs (0, 1e-50 and 1e-5). In addition, the xylem transcriptomes of
radiata pine and loblolly pine were blasted (blastn) against unigenes (the
entire transcriptome) of other plant species, including loblolly pine (1),
white spruce (2), sitka spruce (3), hybrid aspen (4), P. trichocarpa (5),
Arabidopsis (6), rice (7) and moss (8). These databases were presented on
the X-axis including three plant groups: conifers (1-3), angiosperms
(woody 4-5 and herbaceous 6-7) and moss (8). Homologous unigenes at
four E-value cut-offs (0, 1e-100, 1e-50 and 1e-5) were collected.
Nucleotide identities (%) in each comparison (C), average nucleotide
identities (%) within a plant group and their variations (D) were
presented on the Y-axis. Error bar in figure D indicates standard deviation
of average nucleotide identities, and statistical test was shown using Pvalues.
Additional file 2: Known protein genes and transcription factors in
the xylem transcriptome are relatively more conserved in diverse
plants. Known protein genes, unknowns, transcription factors (TFs) and
non-TFs of radiata pine, loblolly pine, white spruce and poplar were
blasted against gene indices (tblastx) of pine and spruce, and gene
models (blastx) of poplar, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss.
Percentage of hits is presented on the Y-axis at three E-value cut-offs (0,
1e-50 and 1e-5). Different numbers of hits observed with known protein
genes and unknowns, as well as with TFs and non-TFs were statistically
tested assuming a binomial distribution. Almost all comparisons are
statistically significant (P < 0.001) except for a few comparisons between
conifers at 1e-5.

plants. A total of 1,003 loblolly pine xylem unigenes have homologs
(tblastx or blastx, E ≤ 1e-50) in the unigenes or gene models of white
spruce, sitka spruce, poplar, Arabidopsis, rice and Selaginella. These
unigenes represent possibly 527 unique xylem orthologs in vascular
plants. The 527 xylem orthologs matched 501 unique gene models of
the non-vascular plant, moss.

chromosome of Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. The proportion of genes
homologous (E ≤ 1e-50 or 1e-5) to the 527 xylem orthologs in each

proportion of all genes in each chromosome. Their differences were
statistically tested and those showing significance were indicated in the
figure using P-values.

Additional file 7: Comparisons of gene ontology (GO) terms of
ancestral xylem orthologs with evolutionary patterns that parallel
or diverge from the trend of plant evolution. Among 501 ancestral
xylem orthologs 235 genes have a molecular evolution pattern similar to
that of plant evolution, while 266 genes diverge from plant evolution.
Functions of genes in these two groups were compared at different
levels of GO terms and their differences were statistically tested using Pvalues.
Additional file 8: The 274 putative conifer-specific xylem unigenes.
A total of 274 loblolly pine xylem unigenes which matched unigenes of

in the gene models of poplar, Arabidopsis, rice, Selaginella and moss as
well as other angiosperm species in the UniProt known protein database
(blastx, E > 10-5), were identified as putative conifer-specific xylem
unigenes.
