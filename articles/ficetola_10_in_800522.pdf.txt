Abstract
Background: DNA barcoding is a key tool for assessing biodiversity in both taxonomic and environmental studies.
Essential features of barcodes include their applicability to a wide spectrum of taxa and their ability to identify
even closely related species. Several DNA regions have been proposed as barcodes and the region selected
strongly influences the output of a study. However, formal comparisons between barcodes remained limited until
now. Here we present a standard method for evaluating barcode quality, based on the use of a new bioinformatic
tool that performs in silico PCR over large databases. We illustrate this approach by comparing the taxonomic
coverage and the resolution of several DNA regions already proposed for the barcoding of vertebrates. To assess
the relationship between in silico and in vitro PCR, we also developed specific primers amplifying different species
of Felidae, and we tested them using both kinds of PCR
Results: Tests on specific primers confirmed the correspondence between in silico and in vitro PCR. Nevertheless,
results of in silico and in vitro PCRs can be somehow different, also because tuning PCR conditions can increase the
performance of primers with limited taxonomic coverage. The in silico evaluation of DNA barcodes showed a
strong variation of taxonomic coverage (i.e., universality): barcodes based on highly degenerated primers and those
corresponding to the conserved region of the Cyt-b showed the highest coverage. As expected, longer barcodes
had a better resolution than shorter ones, which are however more convenient for ecological studies analysing
environmental samples.
Conclusions: In silico PCR could be used to improve the performance of a study, by allowing the preliminary
comparison of several DNA regions in order to identify the most appropriate barcode depending on the study
aims.

Background
DNA barcoding, i.e., the identification of biological
diversity using standardized DNA regions, has been
demonstrated as a new, very useful approach to identify
species [1]. Originally, DNA barcoding was proposed to
assign an unambiguous tag to each species, giving to
taxonomists a standard method for identification of specimens. In this context, it was also proposed that DNA
barcoding is an opportunity to accelerate the discovery
of new species [2-4]. Today, the fields of applications of
this approach are broader. As example, DNA barcoding
has been already used in biodiversity assessment, forensics, diet analysis and paleoecological studies [5-7].
In the former context, a portion of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) has been proposed as the standard
barcode for animal identification [1,8]. Since then, other

portions of DNA have been proposed as barcodes, because
different DNA regions have different performances in
some taxa (e.g., flowering plants [9,10]; amphibians [11]).
If we consider the other applications of barcoding (sensu
lato DNA barcoding, [6]), the necessity to limit the number of usable barcode loci for conserving the standard
aspect of this method can be relaxed. In such a new context, multiple barcodes in different regions of the genome
could be combined to improve identification, according to
the taxon studied and to the aims of the research [9,10].
Therefore, the first step of a sensu lato barcoding study
should be the selection of the best DNA region(s) to be
used as barcode considering the aims of the study. The
availability of large public sequence databases may allow
comparing multiple potential barcodes and their properties before performing studies.

Among the properties of an ideal DNA barcode, high
taxonomic coverage and high resolution are essential
[6,12]. A high taxonomic coverage (also called universality) would allow the application of barcodes to a number
of taxa as large as possible, including undescribed species. This constraints the DNA barcode region to have
sufficiently conserved flanking regions enabling the
design of universal primers. This is especially important
for describing unknown biodiversity or diversity within
environmental samples such as soils or faeces [6,7,13].
However, universality can be extremely difficult to
achieve, because of the incomplete knowledge of genetic
variation in poorly studied taxa [12]. The resolution
capacity of a barcode is its ability to differentiate and
identify species that relies on interspecific differences
among DNA sequences [8,14]. Thus, the challenge for
defining a barcode of good quality consists in finding a
quite short and enough variable DNA sequence flanked
by highly conserved regions. Depending of the application, the size, the taxonomic coverage or the resolution
of the DNA barcode could be the most important characteristic to optimise [6].
This study proposes an explicit approach for comparing
the performance of potential barcoding regions, which is
based on 'in silico PCRs' performed over extensive databases, and on two indices that estimate the resolution
capacity of the barcodes and the taxonomic coverage of
the primers used for their amplification. As an example,
we analysed several primers available from the literature
that have been used in sensu lato barcoding studies [6] for
the identification of Vertebrates species. First, we assessed
the taxonomic coverage of several primer pairs by evaluating the proportion of species amplified in silico in a purposely designed database. Subsequently, we analyzed the
GenBank sequences amplified by each primer pair, in
order to evaluate the proportion of species correctly identified on the basis of their barcodes. We also used an
in vitro analysis to validate the correspondence between
in silico and real world PCR.

Methods
General strategy

First, we created a reference database representative of
the mitochondrial genomes of all vertebrates, by retrieving from Genbank all the complete mitochondrial genomes of Vertebrates available (accession: September
2007). Subsequently, we randomly selected one sequence
per species, to reduce the overrepresentation of a few
species (e.g., humans, mouse, zebrafish etc.). We
obtained a set of 814 mitochondrial genomes representative of the five major monophyletic clades of vertebrates [Chondrichthyes: 8 species; Actinopterigii: 385
species; Amphibia: 79 species; Sauropsida (= birds +
"reptiles"): 133 species; Mammalia: 202 species; other

Page 2 of 10

taxa: 7 species]. Most of species were the unique representative of their genus and the database corresponded
to 633 genera.
To analyze the performance of each primer pair studied, we first performed an in silico PCR on the reference database and we evaluated the taxonomic coverage
of each primer pair as the proportion of amplified taxa.
Then, we performed an in silico PCR on the whole GenBank, to evaluate the resolution of the amplified fragments that represents the proportion of unambiguously
identified taxa. These properties were evaluated for the
whole Vertebrates and for each of the five clades which
compose it.
In Silico PCR

An in silico PCR consists in selecting in a database the
sequences that match (i.e., exhibit similarity with) two
PCR primers. The regions matching the two primers
should be localised on the selected sequence in a way
allowing PCR amplification, which forces the relative
orientation of the matches and the distance between
them. In order to simulate real PCR conditions, the in
silico PCR algorithm should allow some mismatches
between the primers and the target sequences. Standard
sequence similarity assessment programs such as BLAST
[15] are not suitable for such kind of analysis because the
heuristic search they use is not efficient on short
sequences. Moreover, a post processing of BLAST output
should be performed to verify previously stated constraints. We have developed a program named ecoPCR
that is based on the very efficient pattern matching algorithm Agrep [16]. This algorithm allows specifying the
maximum count of mismatched positions between each
primer and the target sequence, and to use the full
IUPAC code (e.g., R for purines or Y for pyrimidines). It
also allows specifying on which primer's specific positions
mismatches are not tolerated, what is useful to force
exact match on the 3′ end of primers for simulating real
PCR conditions. Moreover, to facilitate further analysis,
ecoPCR output contains the taxonomic information for
each sequence selected from the database. For the analyses presented in this article, we allowed two mismatches between each primer and the template, except
on the last 3 bases of the 3′ end of the primer. Analyses
performed with 0, 1 or 3 mismatches led to similar conclusions (results not shown), even if the results were
sometimes different (see discussion). This software was
developed for Unix platforms and is freely available at
http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPCR.
Measuring taxonomic coverage

To measure the taxonomic coverage of a primer pair,
we defined a coverage index Bc as the ratio between the
number of amplified taxa for a specified taxonomic rank

Ficetola et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:434
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/434

(i.e., species for this analysis; genus or family can be specified as alternative taxonomic ranks) and the total number of taxa of the same level representing the studied clade
in the reference sequence database. Bc can be computed
from ecoPCR output file using the ecoTaxStat script.
Measuring resolution capacity

The resolution capacity of a barcode was estimated by
an index measuring the ratio of unambiguously identified taxa for a given taxonomic level over the total number of tested taxa. A taxon unambiguously identified by
a primer pair owns a barcode sequence associated to
this pair that is not shared by any other taxa of the
same taxonomic rank. To be computed, this definition
can be formalized considering the mapping E, Img and
E' between four concept sets: taxon (T), individual (I),
barcode (B) and region (R) (for a full definition see
figure 1). Considering the a taxon t ∈ T and a primer
pair (barcode region) r ∈ R and using the mapping E,
Img and E' we define the Ω(t,r) set of all barcodes
belonging to a taxon for a region:
Ω ( t , r ) = Img(E ( t )) ∩ E ’ ( r )

From the above description, we note the set of all
individuals owning a barcode corresponding to a taxon
as:
Img −1(Ω) ≡

 Img

−1

(b i / b i ∈ Ω)

i

This allows defining an unambiguously identified
taxon t by a barcode region r if and only if:

Page 3 of 10

Img −1 ( Ω(t , r ) ) = E ( t )

This defines a mapping ε of T to R and allows to
define the specificity index Bs as:
B s (r ) =

{ t /t r }
|T |

Bs can be computed from an ecoPCR output file using
the ecoTaxSpecificity script. ecoTaxSpecificity and
ecoTaxStat scripts are parts of the OBITools python
package freely available at http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/
trac/OBITools.
In a few cases, especially for Chondrichthyes, ecoPCR
ran over the entire GenBank yielded only a small number of sequences. Thus, we calculated the resolution
capacity of a barcode only when the primer pair amplified more than 10 species.
Correspondance between in vitro and in silico PCRs

Strict experimental validation of the electronic PCR
realized over large databases would be extremely
difficult, as it would require obtaining tissues from
hundreds of species. Alternatively, specific primer pairs
designed to amplify only one species can be used to
confirm the correspondence between the results of
ecoPCR and in vitro PCR. Therefore, we designed specific primers to amplify mitochondrial DNA of three
species, using ecoPCR to test their specificity. Then,
we cross-amplified the three species with each primer
pairs with in vitro PCR to verify the ecoPCR
predictions.

Figure 1 Relationships between taxa, individuals, barcodes and regions as used in the Bs index estimation. In this example the taxon T1
is unambiguously identified by the R1 barcode region (green links) but the T2 is not well identified by the R1 region because this taxon share
the B4 barcode region with the T3 taxon via the I6 individual (red links).

We considered three species of Asiatic Felidae: the
Leopard (Panthera pardus); the Snow Leopard (Uncia
uncia) and the Leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis).
We designed specific primers for amplifying short
sequences of mitochondrial 12S; this kind of primer
pairs can be used to identify species from degraded
DNA and remains, such as faeces. The three primer
pairs were: (a) PantF, 5′-GTCATACGATTAACCCGG3′; PantR, 5′-TGCCATATTTTTATATTAACTGC-3′,
designed to amplify the Leopard (amplified fragment:
120 bp); (b), UnciF, 5′-CTAAACCTAGATAGTTAGCT3′, UnciR, 5′-CTCCTCTAGAGGGGTG-3′, designed to
amplify the Snow Leopard (amplified fragment: 104 bp);
(c) PrioF, 5′-CCTAAACTTAGATAGTTAATTTT-3′,
PrioR, 5′-GGATGTAAAGCACCGCC-3′, designed to
amplify the Cat Leopard (amplified fragment: 94 bp).
DNA was extracted from faeces using QiAamp DNA
Stool Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The PCRs
were conducted in a 20 μl total volume with 8 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM
of each primer, BSA (5 μg), 0.5 U of AmpliTaq Gold
DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and 2 ml of
DNA extract. For all primers, the PCR programme
included an initial 10 min denaturation step at 95°C,
45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s and annealing
at 53°C for 30 s. Samples of each of the three species

were amplified with the three primer pairs, to verify
in vitro the possibility of cross-amplification. We also
tested cross-amplification ability of these primer pairs
using ecoPCR, allowing two mismatches between each
primer and the template, except on the last 3 bases of
the 3′ end of the primer; subsequently, we simulated
more relaxed PCR conditions [17] by allowing a larger
number of mismatches.
Vertebrate primer pairs tested

The vertebrate primers tested (table 1) were selected in
the bibliography as representative of the diversity of the
strategies used for defining barcodes. Some of them
(COI-1, COI-2, COI-3) were highly degenerated, in
order to maximise the number of taxa amplified (i.e.,
the taxonomic coverage) [18]. Most of primers chosen
amplified long sequences (> 500 bp) to maximize resolution, while some (e.g., Uni-Minibar, 16Smam) have been
designed to amplify short sequences, to maximize the
possibility of retrieving sequences from damaged/ancient
DNA [19-21].

primers amplified Common Leopard only; Unci primers
amplified Snow Leopard only, and Prio primers amplified Cat Leopard only (Figure 2). Crossamplification
through ecoPCR yielded identical results when allowing
two mismatches. A more extensive analysis using
ecoPCR, and allowing a larger number of mismatches (i.e.,
simulating more relaxed PCR conditions), shows that Pant
primers require at least 3 mismatches for cross-amplifying
Uncia uncia. Similarly, Unci and Prio primers require at
least 4 mismatches for cross amplifying other species.
Evaluation of vertebrate primer pairs: Taxonomic
coverage

The primer pairs tested showed very different taxonomic coverage. Overall, COI-2, 16Sr and 16Sr2 were
the primers with the highest percentages of species
amplified (95, 90 and 93% of vertebrates amplified,
respectively; Figure 3, table 2). Following our in silico
PCRs, the primers with the lowest coverage corresponded to Uni-Minibar, COI-1, COI-2H, MCB and
cytM. The primers also differed in their performance in
amplifying the major clades of vertebrates. For example,
COI-3 had the highest amplification rate in Chondrichthyes, while it amplified only 32% of the mammals.
Conversely, 16Smam amplified most of the mammals,
but failed in the amplification of Chondrichthyes (Figure
3, table 2). Nevertheless, in a similar way to how modifying the annealing temperature influences in vitro PCR
[17], the number of electronically amplified species can
be quickly increased by allowing a larger number of
mismatches (Figure 4). For example, with primers

Page 5 of 10

Uni-Minibar, the proportion of amplified species
reached 98% with eight tolerated mismatches (Figure 4).
Resolution capacity of barcode regions

When tested over the entire Genbank, most of the primer pairs had a very high resolution capacity, indicated
by a high Bs index (Figure 5; table 2). We did not calculate Bs for primers Uni-Minibar and COI-2H because of
the low number of species amplified with the settings
used for this analysis (see discussion). Only the 16Smam
primer pair, which amplifies a very short sequence
(140 bp), had Bs < 85%. Bs was ≥ 90% for all other primer pairs and even > 97% for 16Sr and 16Sr2 whatever
the vertebrate clade analysed (Figure 3, table 2). Apart
from a few cases (e.g., low resolution of cytM within
Actinopterigii), the resolution capacity of all primer
pairs was consistently high across all taxa tested. These
B s differences are not correlated with the number of
Genbank sequences amplified (analysis over all vertebrates: Spearman's correlation rS = -0.323, N = 8, p =
0.4; the correlations between resolution and number of
amplified sequences were not significant also within the
monophyletic groups analysed).
The in silico PCRs performed over the entire GenBank
always yielded sequences from the target mitochondrial
region. None of the primers amplified sequences
recorded as nuclear sequences in GenBank.

Discussion
The identification of universal primer pairs amplifying
fragments with high resolution capacity is a major task

of DNA barcoding, and can help the broad scale analysis
of life on earth. However, some authors argued that it is
impossible that a single short sequence will be enough
to distinguish all members of all species [12]. In this
context, explicit in silico approaches like the one
presented in this study allow analysing the properties of
different sets of primers, and identifying the most
appropriate ones a priori.

In silico vs. real PCR

The real in vitro amplification pattern depends on PCR
conditions. Controlling the PCR conditions can alter
amplification results, and thus the taxonomic coverage
of primers. For example, low annealing temperature and
high concentration of MgCl 2 reduce the specificity of
primers in real-world PCR, and can thus allow amplification of target sequences with a larger number of

mismatches in the primer regions [17]. Our in silico
analyses have been performed allowing two mismatches.
These parameters correspond well to actual amplification at rather high annealing temperatures (Figure 2), in
accordance with previously published environmental
genetics studies [22]. Nevertheless, these stringent conditions probably lead us to predict more false negative
results (non electronic amplification of amplifiable
sequences) than false positive ones (electronic amplification of non amplifiable sequences). Increasing the
authorized mismatches can simulate more relaxed conditions, but the strict relationship between electronic
and experimental conditions cannot be formally
described. On the other hand, stringent PCR conditions
reduce the risk of amplifying unwanted regions of the
genome (see below), particularly when using degenerate
primers. Furthermore, our study focused on sensu lato
barcode primer pairs. These studies often amplify DNA
extracted from environmental samples, which may
represent a mix of the DNA of several taxa [6]. Considering this, primers and PCR conditions must be as specific as possible, because the rare species with a low
number of mismatches in the primer region (Figure 4)
are expected to be overamplified and overrepresented in
the PCR products, while species that are present, but
with a higher number of mismatches, may not be amplified enough to yield sequences. Therefore, "ideal" primers would have a constantly low number of
mismatches, leading to a less biased estimate of species
presence.
EcoPCR can also be used to simulate less stringent
PCR conditions, allowing more mismatches. With this
approach, primers can amplify a much larger number of

species (Figure 3). For example, in our stringent in silico
analysis the primers Uni-Minibar showed limited taxonomic coverage, and amplified very few vertebrates
(table 2). Conversely, the PCRs performed by Meusnier
et al. [20] showed that these primers can amplify nearly
100% of fish and Amphibians, at an annealing temperature of 46°C. Results coherent with Meusnier et al. [20]
can be obtained using ecoPCR by allowing a large number of mismatches (up to eight) (Figure 4). Taking into
account all these considerations, we have to assume that
the taxonomic coverage Bc estimated from ecoPCR is
not an exact value, but it reflects the relative capacity of
primer pairs to amplify a broad variety of taxa. For
example, the fact that 16Sr amplifies a much larger
number of species of amphibians than COI-2H [[11,23],
see also [24] for a different approach] was correctly predicted by in silico analyses (see Figure 2, table 2).
Pseudogenes are a further potential issue in barcoding
analysis; our approach may be affected by this trap. For
instance, in our analyses none of the primers amplified
nuclear sequences. However, nuclear sequences are
underrepresented in Genbank; furthermore, the in silico
amplification of pseudogenes would require the presence
of a target nuclear sequence and both the corresponding
primer regions, i.e., a good coverage of nuclear genome.
Therefore it is difficult that ecoPCR hits nuclear pseudogenes, which can nevertheless be amplified by in vitro
PCR, particularly under relaxed (e.g., low annealing temperature) conditions. Another potential issue of our
approach is that the adjoining primer regions of
sequences submitted to the databases are not a queryable portion of the database, therefore limiting the number of sequences obtained when ecoPCR is run over the

red curve and the associated right axis represent the cumulative fraction of amplified sequences with less that m mismatch. We can observe
than a few species present a small count of mismatches; these sequences with a few mismatches are expected to be advantageously amplified
in a DNA mix containing multiple species.

entire GenBank. To partially address this issue, the
assessment of taxonomic coverage was performed on
species for which the whole mitochondrial genome was
available, and therefore both target sequences and flanking regions are present. The increasing availability of
whole mitochondrial genomes due the improvement
sequencing technologies, and the rising of phylogenomics may reduce this limitation in the next future.
The correspondence between in silico and real PCR is
certainly more accurate for the resolution capacity, still
potential sources of bias remain. Our approach is based
on the analysis of all the sequences deposited in GenBank, i.e., including thousands of vertebrate species in
the example developed here. Assuming that all GenBank
sequences are assigned to the correct species in the
database, such approach uses the same kind of information than large scale barcoding studies. Clearly, the
availability of sequences in different clades depends on
the previous use of markers. For example, GenBank
includes a very large number of COI sequences for Actinopterigii, while most of the mitochondrial sequences of
mammals and amphibians are 16S. Furthermore, annotation errors are present in Genbank [25], and the error
rate might be clade dependent. The BS index is sensible
to these errors, leading to an underestimation of B S ;
therefore, as for BC previously, BS should be considered
as a relative measure of primer performance.
Comparison of vertebrate barcodes

Universality is a key feature of barcodes, and several
strategies exist that can increase the taxonomic coverage
of primer pairs. One strategy consists in making cocktails of degenerate primers. For example, the COI-2

primer pair [18] had one of the highest taxonomic coverages (figure 2). A predictable drawback of degenerate
primers is a limited specificity with regards to the target
DNA sequence amplified. However, our in silico PCRs
performed on the whole GenBank did not amplify incorrect regions. All sequences amplified by the COI-2
primer pair were labelled in GenBank as mitochondrial
COI, suggesting that these primers maintained enough
specificity.
An alternative strategy consists in designing universal
primers on highly conserved regions. This strategy has
been used for example on the 16S, that exhibits some
highly conserved regions in vertebrates [26]. The primers amplifying the 16S [[27,28]; this study] were very
powerful, and had the highest taxonomic coverage and
resolution capacity in vertebrates (Figure 2, Figure 3,
table 2). The 16S region has been investigated as an
alternate barcode locus for amphibians [11] but COI has
not been rejected [24]. Some studies advocated that 16S
has a too low rate of molecular evolution, and thus does
not hold enough interspecific variation for a correct species identification [1]. Our analysis suggests that, at least
in vertebrates, 16S has the same resolution capacity as
COI, when using sequences with comparable length
(500-600 bp), and therefore can be a good candidate site
for barcoding. Nevertheless, the good performance of
16S observed in vertebrates may not be valid in other
taxa; our in silico approach can be a key tool to analyse
this possibility.
Long barcodes (500-600 bp) like the standard COI and
16S barcodes have a high resolution capacity, and are
ideal candidates, for example, to unambiguously identify
taxa in the context of the original DNA barcoding

Ficetola et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:434

usage. However, studies analysing environmental samples or degraded DNA require the use of shorter DNA
fragments [6,7,13,20,22,29] even though those smaller
regions include less information. We have included in
our analysis two primer pairs amplifying short sequences
that can be used for such analyses: Uni-Minibar [20]
and 16Smam [21], which amplify sequences of 130140 bp. Our analysis did not amplify enough sequences
to evaluate the overall performance of Uni-Minibar, but
allowed estimating the taxonomic coverage of 16Smam,
which was very high for mammals (i.e., the taxon for
which the primers have been designed), and lower for
the other clades (Figure 2). This short barcode had the
lowest resolution capacity for identification at the species level (Figure 3). However, in many cases species
identification is not needed in ecological barcoding, as
information on the genus or family can be already valuable [6,7,13,29]. Indeed, the resolution of 16Smam was
much higher if the aim was the identification at the
genus or family level (resolution capacity of 96% and
100%, respectively; results not shown).
Our analysis focused on vertebrates, because several
primers have been proposed for their sensu lato barcoding. Furthermore, the in silico assessment of primers
strongly depends on the sequences in online databases;
vertebrates are the phylum best covered by available
sequences, therefore they are the ideal focus of a methodological analysis. Nevertheless, biodiversity on Earth is
dominated by other phyla, such as arthropods and molluscs: The evaluation method describe here can be
applied to these taxa and to any other ones, considering
that the precision of the estimated BS and BC indices is
directly linked to the amount and the quality of available
sequences in public database corresponding to the studied clade.

Conclusion
Based on our in silico analyses, the different barcodes
tested showed dissimilar adequacy to be used according
to the five clades of vertebrates studied. If we consider
all possible applications of sensu lato barcoding, no single barcode could be identified as the best for all vertebrates. The primers amplifying COI-2 showed the
highest taxonomic coverage in Actinopterigii and Sauropsida, while those amplifying 16Sr/16Sr2 showed the
highest coverage of Amphibians and Mammals (Figure
3, table 2). Furthermore, the barcodes with the highest
taxonomic coverage and resolution capacity (i.e., COI-2,
16Sr, 16Sr2) amplified long fragments, which can make
their application problematic for describing biodiversity
within environmental samples. In such a context, it is
useful to select a priori the barcode that best suited the
research topic. Our in silico method can help identifying
the most appropriate barcode according to different

aims. Such formal approach, which is possible thanks to
the availability of bioinformatics tools and large public
databases, can focus on target taxa or DNA regions and
would make easier the validation of new barcodes by
reducing the number of candidate primer pairs to be
tested in vitro.
