In silico analysis highlights the frequency and
diversity of type 1 lantibiotic gene clusters in
genome sequenced bacteria

Abstract
Background: Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides. These
peptides have significant, but largely untapped, potential as preservatives and chemotherapeutic agents. Type 1
lantibiotics are those in which lanthionine residues are introduced into the structural peptide (LanA) through the
activity of separate lanthionine dehydratase (LanB) and lanthionine synthetase (LanC) enzymes. Here we take
advantage of the conserved nature of LanC enzymes to devise an in silico approach to identify potential lantibioticencoding gene clusters in genome sequenced bacteria.
Results: In total 49 novel type 1 lantibiotic clusters were identified which unexpectedly were associated with
species, genera and even phyla of bacteria which have not previously been associated with lantibiotic production.
Conclusions: Multiple type 1 lantibiotic gene clusters were identified at a frequency that suggests that these
antimicrobials are much more widespread than previously thought. These clusters represent a rich repository which
can yield a large number of valuable novel antimicrobials and biosynthetic enzymes.

Background
Bacteriocins are bacterially produced peptide antibiotics.
Two major classes of gram-positive bacteriocins have
been recognised, Class I undergo significant post-translationally modifications while the Class II are unmodified [1,2]. The majority of the class I bacteriocins are
lantibiotics; small peptides containing internal bridges
resulting from the formation of (b-methyl)lanthionine
residues. The structural gene encodes a ribosomally
synthesised precursor prepeptide which is generically
named LanA. This prepeptide contains a leader
sequence at the N-terminus, which is ultimately cleaved,
and a propeptide at the C-terminus. Many or all of the
serine and threonine residues within the propeptide are
dehydrated to form dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively. When these modified residues interact with an intrapeptide cysteine, a thioether
bond is formed resulting in the formation of lanthionine
(Lan, from Dha) or b-methyl lanthionine (meLan, from
Dhb).

The lantibiotics and lantipeptides (lanthionine containing peptides which lack antimicrobial activity) can
be divided into four groups according to the nature of
the enzymes which catalyse (me)Lan formation [3]. In
the case of type 1 lantibiotics two enzymes are involved;
LanB, the lanthionine dehydratase which catalyses the
dehydration of the amino acids, and LanC, the lanthionine synthetase which catalyses thioether formation.
Type 2 lantibiotics contain a single LanM enzyme which
performs both functions. Type 3 and 4 are lantipeptides
which are also catalysed by distinct enzymes such as the
RamC-like and LanL enzymes [4,5]. The type 1 and 2
lantibiotics can also be further subdivided on the basis
of the amino acid sequence of the unmodified propeptide. In the case of the type 1 lantibiotics, five such subgroups have been identified, each of which is named
after the corresponding prototypical lantibiotic; the
nisin-like, epidermin-like, Pep5-like, streptin-like and
planosporocin-like lantibiotic subgroups [2,6]. The
nisin-like group is named for nisin A, which is the most
extensively studied bacteriocin and is currently sold in
more than 50 countries as a food preservative [7]. In
addition to LanA, B and C, other proteins involved in

the the production of nisin A and other type 1 lantibiotics include LanP, a serine protease that cleaves the leader from the propeptide; LanT, an ABC transporter
responsible for the transport of the lantibiotic precursor
across the cell membrane; LanIEFG encode proteins
involved in immunity and; LanK, a histidine kinase and
LanR, a response regulator, that together operate as a
two-component regulatory system. LanD enzymes, such
as that responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of
C-terminal cysteines in epidermin [8], are less common.
Given the broad antimicrobial spectrum of many lantibiotics, the possibility of applying lantibiotics in a medicinal capacity has become the subject of much
attention. This is supported by an enhanced understanding of their mechanisms of action [9] and the dearth of
novel antibiotics. Of the type 1 lantibiotics, nisin, mutacin and planosporicin have been shown to be active
against multi-drug resistant gram-positive pathogens
[10-12], Pep5 and epidermin inhibit Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion to catheters [13] and epidermin and
gallidermin are active against Propionibacterium acnes
[14]. Other lantibiotics, or their producer strains, have
been used as food preservatives and as oral and gastrointestinal antimicrobials/probiotics [15-17]. As a consequence of this increased interest in lantibiotics, a
concerted effort has taken place to identify new and
improved forms of these peptides. Culture based screening strategies have in the past been responsible for the
identification of lantibiotics produced by bacteria isolated from diverse microbial niches including the oral
cavity, intestine, soil, kefir grains and milk [12,18-21].
Recently, an alternative means of identifying novel lantibiotics has emerged as a consequence of the increasing
generation and availability of genomic and metagenomic
sequence data. The availability of such information has
recently led to the identification of the type 1 epidermin-like lantibiotic, Bsa [22] as well as type 2 lantibiotics such as haloduracin [23,24], licheniciden [25,26], as
well as a range of cyanobacteria-associated lantipeptides
[27]. This has prompted the development of on-line
tools and repositories such as BAGEL and BACTIBASE
to facilitate such screening strategies [28-31]. Notably,
although an in-silico screen for lanM genes has recently
resulted in the identification of 61 novel type 2 lantibiotic-like gene clusters [25], a corresponding screen for
type 1 lantibiotics has not yet been described. Here we
address this issue by screening for clusters containing
genes homologous to the nisin A biosynthetic genes
nisB (representing lanB) and nisC (representing lanC).
In each case, the regions flanking the newly identified
lanB/lanC genes were subjected to further in silico analysis to determine if they are potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide-associated gene clusters. This included a search
of nearby open reading frames (orfs) which might

encode a corresponding LanA, defined as being of relatively short length (approx 60 amino acids) and containing an uneven distribution of cysteine, threonine and
serine amino acids within the propeptide region. Using
this approach, 27 novel type 1 lantibiotic/lantipeptideencoding clusters were identified. Subsequent screening
using the newly identified LanA, B and C homologs as
driver sequences revealed a further 22 gene clusters,
resulting in a total of 49 putative novel type 1 lantibiotic
clusters. Significantly, many of these clusters are present
in species, genera and phyla not previously associated
with lantibiotic/lantipeptide production and are predicted to encode peptides which represent completely
new type 1 subclasses.

Results and Discussion
In silico screen for lanC genes

An in silico screen for LanC homologues, using the
NisC sequence as a driver, resulted in the identification
of 56 homologues. Of these 7 have previously been associated with lantibiotic production, 11 were orphan
homologs (in that no other lantibiotic-associated genes
were identified in close association) (Table 1), 9 were
encoded within a cluster in which no lanA could be
detected (Table 2) and one cluster contained two LanCs
(but no structural peptide). The remaining 27 potential
lantibiotic/lantipeptide-encoding gene clusters all contained putative lanA, B and C genes (Table 3). The
genes flanking the 27 novel lanC-like genes were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis to determine the
presence of other orfs that share homology with genes
linked to lantibiotic production or immunity. While
these 27 clusters are the primary focus of this in silico
analysis, the sequences of the newly identified LanA,
B and C proteins associated with these clusters were in
turn used for further in silico screens. This approach
uncovered an additional 22 clusters (Table 4) that were
also predicted to be novel lantibiotic/lantipeptideencoding clusters, thereby yielding a total of 49 novel
type 1 clusters.
All except one of the 27 gene clusters revealed following the initial screen were located within the genomes
of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The exception was
Chitinophaga pinensis DSM 2588 of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Of the other 26, the genera most commonly
associated with lantibiotic production were Bacillus,
Geobacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Streptococcus,
Frankia and Streptomyces. In many cases the novel clusters associated with a specific genus, such as those
found on the Streptomyces and Frankia genomes,
showed at least some similarity to each other. It was
also noted that several of the genomes in which a cluster was located also contained an additional cluster(s)
(Table 3), or other genes predicted to encode additional

The Frankia are nitrogen-fixing, root nodule-forming
filamentous Actinobacteria that live in symbiosis with
actinorhizal plants. All species of Frankia are closely
related [32]. To date, four Frankia genomes have been

EAN1pec, Frankia sp. Cc13 and Frankia sp. EUI1c, and
although no Frankia-associated bacteriocins have previously been reported, a number of predicted lantibiotic
clusters can be found in each case (Figure 1) in addition
to a number of apparently LanB- and LanC-encoding
genes which do not have an accompanying lanA (Table
2). This latter phenomenon could be a result of the frequent rearrangements which occur in Frankia strains
[32]. Of the clusters identified, many resemble clusters
associated with another genus of Actinobacteria, the
Streptomyces.

identical to Franean1_0057 of Frankia sp. EAN1pec (see
below). The LanB and LanC proteins resemble those
associated with other Frankia, as well as Streptomyces,
clusters. The LanC protein is also 62% identical to
Tcur_4648 of Thermomonospora curvata DSM 43183

(NC_013510), which itself appears to be encoded by an
orf within a novel lantibiotic gene cluster. The ACN14a
II cluster is also predicted to encode two proteins which
share homology with O-methyltransferases (FRAAL6342
and FRAAL6346). O-methyltransferases contribute to the

Marsh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:679

production of a number of non-ribosomal antibiotics
[33,34] and catalyse the methylation of hydroxyl group(s)
on deoxysugar rings to protect the reactive hydroxyl
group from undesired modifications and can alter the
solubility and pharmacokinetic properties of the resulting
molecule [35]. Although O-methyltransferases have not
previously been associated with lantibiotic production,
this study reveals that many Actinobacteria-associated
type 1 clusters possess genes predicted to encode these
enzymes.
Frankia sp. Cc13: The Frankia sp. Cc13 genome [32]
contains three gene clusters of interest (Frankia sp.
Cc13 I, Frankia sp. Cc13 II and Frankia sp. Cc13 III).
Two O-methyltransferase-encoding genes were identified in each case and it was noted that the associated
LanB and LanC proteins are similar to one another
and to numerous others predicted to be produced by
Frankia and Streptomyces species. In contrast, there is a
lack of homology between the three lanA genes. The
lanA gene from cluster I was not previously annotated
and was only identified following closer inspection of
the DNA sequence. The cluster II-associated LanA,
Francci3_1820, most closely resembles Frankia sp.
EuI1c FraEuI1cDRAFT_6351 (69% identity) while the
third, and also previously unannotated LanA appears to
be one of an extended group of Frankia- and Streptomyces-associated LanAs that includes Frankia sp. EuI1c
FraEuI1cDRAFT_1582 (56% identity).
Frankia EAN1pec: The Frankia EAN1pec genome
[32] contains 4 putative LanB-encoding genes three of
which correspond to potential lantibiotic/lantipeptideassociated gene clusters (Frankia EAN1pec I, Frankia
EAN1pec III and Frankia EAN1pec IV) which again
resemble those of Streptomyces and other Frankia species, and contain O-methyltransferase-encoding genes.
Within the first cluster, a putative LanA prepropeptide,
encoded by a previously unannotated orf located
between Franean1_1331 and the LanB determinant, is
homologous to a number of other LanAs, including
Sare_0601 of Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 (55% identity). The cluster is also noteworthy be virtue of the presence of two LanC-encoding genes, Franean1_1333 and
Franean1_1336. Within Frankia EAN1pec III, the LanA
peptide, encoded by Franean1_6756 is 42% identical to
FraEuI1cDRAFT_6351 of Frankia sp. EuI1c while finally,
a screen using F. alni ACN14a FRAAL6345 as a driver
led to the identification of yet another cluster (consisting of at least Franean1_0057-0055) which closely
resembles cluster II of F. alni ACN14a II.
Frankia sp. EuI1c: Frankia sp. EuI1c contains a single
putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide gene cluster (Frankia sp.
EuI1c I) which again contains LanB, C and O-methyltransferase genes typical of Frankia and Streptomyces clusters.
The associated LanA homolog (FraEuI1cDRAFT_1582) is

Page 6 of 21

notable by virtue of being 46% identical to SSCG_03316, a
known LanA of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064
while a gene encoding an ABC transporter related protein
(FraEuI1cDRAFT_1578) is also present.
Identification of novel Salinispora -associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

Salinispora are marine Actinobacteria. There are two
recognised species, S. tropicalis and S. arenicola. Representatives have been sequenced in each case and genes
predicted to encode non-lantibiotic bacteriocins have
been identified in both cases [36]. The existence of a
putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster, between
Sare_0602 and Sare_0623, in the genome of S. arenicola
CNS-205 was noted previously [36]. However, this cluster has not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatic
characterisation. Our analysis reveals that Sare_0601
apparently encodes a LanA peptide which is 88% identical to that encoded by MicauDRAFT_5818 of Micromonospora aurantiaca ATCC 27029. The proteins encoded
by Sare_0602 (LanB) and Sare_0603 (LanC) also resemble other ATCC 27029-associated proteins (encoded by
MicauDRAFT_5819 (71% identity) and MicauDRAFT_5820 (75% identity)), thereby revealing an additional novel cluster in Micromonospora, a genus better
known for its production of non-ribosomal antibiotics
such gentamycin and netamycin [37] (Table 4).
Identification of novel Stackebrandtia-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

Stackebrandtia are aerobic, non-motile Actinobacteria
which have been isolated from soil [38]. There are only
2 associated species i.e. S. albiflava and S. nassauensis
and in silico analysis of S. nassauensis DSM 44728
(NC_013947) reveals the presence of two similar clusters
(S. nassauensis DSM 44728 I and S. nassauensis DSM
44728 II) (Figure 1). The hypothetical LanA, encoded by
Snas_5416, of the first cluster showed a singular homology of 78% identity to Snas_3601 of the second cluster.
The corresponding LanBs (Snas_5417 and Snas_3602)
are 62% identical while the LanCs (Snas_5418 and
Snas_3603) are 68% identical.
Identification of novel Streptomyces-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

Bacteria from the genus Streptomyces, comprising over
500 species, are filamentous, high G-C bacteria found
frequently in soil and rotting vegetation. They are the
most numerous and ubiquitous soil bacteria [39]. Streptomyces are also responsible for the production of over
two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural
origin (e.g., neomycin, chloramphenicol) [40]. Although
a number of Streptomyces-associated bacteriocins, such
as ancovenin [41] and cinnamycin [42], have been identified, this number is relatively small considering the
size of the genus. As was apparent above, our in silico
analysis has revealed that many Streptomyces possess

Marsh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:679
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/679

potentially lantibiotic-encoding gene clusters which
resemble those found in Frankia. Once again, the
majority of these clusters contain O-methyltransferases
(Figure 2).
Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 S. clavuligerus
is an aerobic, mesophillic Streptomyces sp. While there
have been no previous reports of bacteriocin production
by this species, two lantibiotic clusters were found to be
present on the genome of S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064.
In the first of these clusters, the associated hypothetical
LanA, B and C proteins (SSCG_01498-01496) are 63%,
42% and 50% identical to the corresponding proteins of
Frankia sp. CcI3 II. BLAST analysis of these proteins
also revealed another novel cluster in Streptomyces
viridochromogenes DSM 40736 corresponding to
SvirD4_23440 (LanA; 50% identity), SvirD4_23449
(LanB; 36% identity) and SvirD4_23454 (LanB; 45%
identity) (Table 4). The second S. clavuligerus cluster,
which contains SSCG_03316 (LanA), SSCG_03317
(LanB) and SSCG_03318 (LanC), resembled clusters present in a number of other strains such as that of Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus NBRC 13350 [43] (73%,
56% and 64% identity, respectively). BLAST analysis of
these sequences also led to the identification of yet
another novel cluster in Streptomyces sp. SPB74
(SSBG_01041 [LanA] 69% identity and SSBG_01042
[LanB] 58% identity).
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Streptomyces coelicolor A3
(2) (NC_003888) is the best characterised representive of
its genus [44] and was the first Streptomyces strain to
have its genome sequenced [45]. Although bacteriocins/
bacteriocin-like peptides are known to be produced by
this species (e.g. the class III morphogenic peptide SapB
[4]), such peptides have not previously been associated
with this strain. Here BLAST analysis revealed the presence of two lantibiotic/lantipeptide clusters (S. coelicolor
A3(2) I and S. coelicolor A3(2) II). The first of these clusters, containing SCO0268 (LanA), SCO0269 (LanB) and
SCO0270 (LanC), very closely resembles Streptomyces griseoflavus Tu4000 cluster II (see below). Subsequent
BLAST searches with the A3(2) cluster I-associated proteins led in turn to the discovery of an almost identical
cluster in Streptomyces lividans TK24 which contains
SSPG_07329 (LanA; 100% identity), SSPG_07328 (LanB;
99% identity) and SSPG_07327 (LanC; 100% identity)
(Table 4). The second cluster, Streptomyces coelicolor A3
(2) II, is predicted to encode two LanA peptides,
(SCO6932 [43aa] and SCO6931 [59aa]) which are 97%
identical to each other, as well as LanB (SCO6930) and
LanC (SCO6929) proteins with homology (39-46% identity) with corresponding proteins associated with Frankia
sp. CcI3. Such analysis also revealed another cluster of
interest in the actinomycete, Catenulispora acidiphila
DSM 44928 (NC_013131; [Table 4]).

Page 7 of 21

Streptomyces griseoflavus Tu4000 Three lantibiotic/
lantipeptide clusters were identified on the genome
of this anaerobic, terrestrial Streptomyces. Although
the LanA encoded within the first cluster (SgriT_
010100000925) does not significantly resemble any other
protein, the associated LanB (SgriT_010100000920) and
LanC (SgriT_010100000915) proteins are homologous
to the corresponding proteins of S. coelicolor A3(2) cluster I and Tu4000 cluster II. BLAST searches using the
cluster I proteins as drivers also resulted in the identification of several additional clusters in Nocardiopsis dassonvillei DSM 43111 (NdasDRAFT_3161 [LanB] 30%
identity), Streptomyces sp. Mg1 (SSAG_05771 [LanB]
37% identity) and two clusters on the genome of
M. aurantiaca ATCC 27029 (NZ_ADBZ00000000;
MicauDRAFT_5820 and MicauDRAFT_3008 [both
LanBs] 35% identity). In addition to the components of
the second cluster referred to above, an associated LanA
(SgriT_010100036309) was also noted. In addition to
the Tu4000 I and A3(2) I clusters, this cluster is also
highly identical to that of S. lividans TK24 (SSPG_07329
[LanA] 97% identity; SSPG_07328 [LanB] 87% identity
and SSPG_07327 [LanC] 89% identity). The LanA associated with the final cluster (SgriT_010100029766) again
bears no homology with any other known peptides
whereas the LanB (SgriT_010100029771) and LanC
(SgriT_010100029776) corresponded to those of Frankia
sp. EAN1pec II (39% and 44% identity, respectively).
Type 1 lantibiotic gene clusters in Firmicutes
Identification of novel Bacillus-associated lantibiotic gene
clusters

Bacillus is a large and diverse genus of rod-shaped,
sporulating, obligate aerobes which contains both free
living and pathogenic species. A number of type 1 lantibiotics have previously been characterized in this genus
(e.g. subtilin [46] and ericin [47]). The NisC-driven
screen highlighted the presence of a type 1 lantibiotic
cluster in the genomes of two Bacillus strains i.e. Bacillus cereus F65185 and Bacillus mycoides DSM 2048
(Figure 3). Bioinformatic analysis of these clusters
revealed two further clusters in B. cereus ATCC 14579
and B. cereus AH1272.
Bacillus cereus F65185 B. cereus F65185 is a mesophilic bacterium sourced from a human wound containing
one lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster which is unusual in
that 3 orfs separate the putative LanB and C genes and
the two have a divergent orientation. The predicted
LanA (bcere0025_48310) does not resemble any other
known lantibiotic prepropeptides. The LanB homolog
(bcere0025_48320) resembles a putative LanB associated
with Clostridium cellulovorans 743B (ClocelDRAFT_0452, 30% identity) while the predicted LanC
(bcere0025_48280) most closely resembles two further

743B proteins (ClocelDRAFT_0452, 34% identity and
ClocelDRAFT_0446, 28% identity). However the 743B
strain lacks an associated LanA. Further BLAST analysis
with the F65185-associated LanB highlighted the presence of a related protein within thiocillin-encoding
gene cluster in B. cereus ATCC 14579 [48].
Bacillus mycoides DSM 2048 B. mycoides is a nonmotile, non-pathogenic, saprophytic Bacillus, strains of
which have been investigated with a view to their application as biological pesticides. Although representatives of
this species have been associated with bacteriocin production [49], there are no published reports of lantibiotic-producing B. mycoides. The DSM 2048 genome
contains a lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster that contains
putative lanA, B, C and other lantibiotic-associated genes
which is very similar to other novel clusters in B. cereus
AH1272 and B. cereus AH1273. Bmyco0001_53830 is
the predicted prepropeptide and is 100% identical to
the products of the B. cereus AH1272-associated
bcere0029_28240 and bcere0029_28250. It is also 58%
identical to prepropeptides associated with several
Staphylococcus-associated Bsa lantibiotics, such as
BsaA2RF122 of S. aureus RF122 [22]. It is thus apparent
that the LanA is a member of the epidermin-like
peptides. In addition to homologues in B. cereus AH1273
and AH1272, use of the DSM 2048-associated LanB
and LanC sequences as drivers also surprisingly highlighted a gene cluster present in Actinomyces sp. oral
taxon 848 (Table 4). In addition to homology with
respect to LanB and LanC proteins (HMPREF0972_00932
and HMPREF0972_00933, respectively), the proposed
LanA (HMPREF0972_00931; 86aa) is 43% identical
to bmyco0001_53830 and bcere0029_28240 and
bcere0029_28250 of Bacillus mycoides DSM 2048 and
Bacillus cereus AH1272, respectively.
Identification of novel Clostridium-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

The Clostridia are gram postitive anaerobic, endosporeforming Firmicutes of which there are approximately
100 species. These include important pathogens such as
Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfingens and Clostridium tetani. Several Clostridium-associated bacteriocins
have been characterised from this genus [50-52], but no
type 1 lantibiotic producers have been identified to date.
Here, bioinformatic analysis revealed one Clostridiumassociated lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster, located on the
genome of C. perfringens CPE str. F4969 (Figure 3).
C. perfringens CPE str. F4969 C. perfringens is one of
the leading causes of food-borne illness in the developed
world, usually as a result of the improper sterilization of
canned foods in which endospores have germinated. It
can also be responsible for wound and surgical infections [53,54]. The predicted LanA (AC5_A0201) of
strain F4969 is most closely related to the LanAs of

Page 10 of 21

B. mycoides DSM 2048 and B. cereus AH1272 (51%
identity) while the proteins encoded by AC5_A0200
(LanB) and AC5_A0198 (LanC) most closely resemble
proteins associated with Geobacillus sp. G11MC16
(G11MC16DRAFT_2954 and G11MC16DRAFT_2952;
34% and 35% identity respectively). Surprisingly, BLAST
analysis also highlighted the presence of a related LanB
homolog encoded within a lantibiotic/lantipeptidelike gene cluster in the genome of Parachlamydia
acanthamoebae (phlylum Chlamydiae) str. Hall’s coccus
(pah_c028o031; 25% identity). Adjacent genes of
note within the P. acanthamoebae cluster include
pah_c028o029 (LanA) and pah_c028o030 (LanC).
Identification of novel Enterococcus-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

The enterococci are gram positive lactic acid bacteria
which are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans but can also be pathogens. Many Enterococcus-associated bacteriocins (enterocins) have been
identified [55]. Only one Enterococcus-associated lantibiotic, the type 2 peptide cytolysin, has been identified
to date [56]. Here we describe genes which potentially
encode the first type 1 Enterococcus-associated lantibiotic (Figure 3).
Enterococcus faecalis Fly1: E. faecalis Fly1 (NZ_ACAR00000000) is a non-motile, facultative anaerobe.
Within its genome we identified a previously unannotated LanA determinant, through analysis of raw
sequence data. The corresponding peptide is homologous to C. perfringens CPE str. F4969 (AC5_A0201; 68%
identity), as well as a number of epidermin-like LanAs
in other bacilli. The putative LanB protein is split across
two orfs, EFKG_00402 (80 amino acids) and
EFKG_0403 (942 amino acids), with both components
most closely resembling the N-terminus of the dehydratase of Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS10270,
MGAS10270_Spy0922. It is unclear whether the apparent frameshift in the Fly1 lanB is genuine or the result
of a sequencing error. The LanC-like EFKG_00405, was
most closely related to the corresponding protein in
G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 (SpaC GTNG_0268; 35%
identity).
Identification of novel Geobacillus-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

Geobacilli are thermophillic (45-70°C), aerobic, sporeforming Firmicutes. They have been isolated from various terrestrial and marine environments, in geothermal,
temperate and permanently cold habitats. Reclassified in
2001 [57], these bacteria are of industrial interest as
sources of thermostable enzymes. Bacteriocins have
been identified in Geobacillus stearothermophilus [58]
and Geobacillus thermoleovorans [59], and while screening for LanM-producing gene clusters has highlighted
the potential existence of a number of type 2 lantibiotics

Marsh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:679
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/679

[25], associated type 1 lantibiotics have not previously
been described. Here, three putative type 1 lantibiotic/
lantipeptide-encoding clusters within the genomes of
Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2 and Geobacillus sp. G11MC16
(Figure 3) are described.
Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 G. kaustophilus
grows optimally in aquatic environments at 60°C with
an upper temperature limit of 74°C. From a lantibiotic
persepective, genome xsequencing of HTA426 revealed
a hypothetical protein annotated as a ‘lantibiotic precursor’ GK0294. Our analysis revealed that this putative
LanA is 91% identical to another prepropeptide encoded
by the closely located GK0286 gene. It is also 100%
identical to orphan ‘lantibiotic precursor’ homologs
(GYMC52DRAFT_3129 and GYMC61_1158) in Geobacillus sp. Y412MC52 and Geobacillus sp. Y412MC61,
respectively. More distantly related LanAs (79% identity)
are also associated with the genomes of Geobacillus
thermodenitrificans NG80-2 (GTNG_0265) and Geobacillus sp. G11MC16 (G11MC16DRAFT_2956). The
homology between the Geobacillus LanAs is highest
within the leader regions, but, as is the case with nisin-,
epidermin- and streptin-like lantibiotics, a conserved
serine and CTPGC motif in the N-terminus of the propeptide is present, which is believed to be involved in
the binding of these lantibiotics to lipid II in the cell
wall in gram positive bacteria [60]. BLAST analysis of
the GK0286-encoded LanA highlighted the presence of
another potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster in Corynebacterium lipophiloflavum DSM 44291 (57% identity
with HMPREF0298_1795). Within the HTA426 cluster,
the proteins predicted to be encoded by GK0300/301
(an apparently frameshifted lanB) and GK0304 are
homologous to those associated with many other geobacilli. It was also noted that this cluster is less condensed
than typical lantibiotic gene clusters in that there are
insertions of 7, 5 and 3 genes (predicted to encode
many transposases and small, hypothetical proteins)
between the lantibiotic associated genes.
Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2 and Geobacillus sp. G11MC16: G. thermodenitrificans are facultative soil bacteria with denitrification qualities.
Representatives of this species grow between 45°C and
73°C (optimum 65°C). NG80-2 was isolated from a
deep-subsurface oil reservoir in Dagang oilfield, Northern China [61] and on the basis of in-silico analysis is
potentially the producer of both a type 1 (see below)
and type 2 lantibiotic [25]. Our analysis reveals that the
type I lantibiotic/lantipeptide operons in G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 and Geobacillus sp. G11MC16 are very
highly conserved. The two LanAs are 100% identical
and the homology between these, and indeed the associated B and Cs, and the corresponding G. kaustophilus

Page 11 of 21

HTA426 proteins is discussed above. It was noted that
the lanB of Geobacillus sp. G11MC16 is apparently frameshifted (G11MC16DRAFT_2955 (176aa) and
G11MC16DRAFT_2954 (848aa)) but that this is not the
case in G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 (GTNG_0266).
Identification of novel Staphylococcus-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

The staphylococci are non-sporeforming, non-motile
Firmicutes. The genus Staphylococcus contains 33 species, most of which are harmless and reside normally on
the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other
organisms. However, staphylococci can also cause a
wide variety of diseases either through toxin production
or penetration and are a common cause of food poisoning and nosocomial infections. Several strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis have been shown to be producers
of type 1 lantibiotics, including epidermin [62], Pep5
[63], epicidin 280 [64] and epilancin K7 [65], gallidermin
was isolated from S. gallinarum [14] while Staphylococcin Au26 [66] and Bsa [22] were isolated from S. aureus.
BLAST analysis has revealed that several other S. aureus
strains possess gene clusters similar to those associated
with Bsa and BsaRF122 [22]. These clusters were identified in S. aureus A9765, D139 and H19. In A9765,
SAPG_01762 and SAPG_01760 correspond to the
BsaA1 and BsaA2 peptides of S. aureus MW2 (97% and
100% identity, respectively). The precursor peptides of
the D139 (SATG_00575 and SATG_00574; 76% identical to each other) and H19 (SAUG_01228 and
SAUG_01229; 76% identical to each other) strains are
100% identical. The peptides encoded by SATG_00575
and SAUG_01229 are 93% identical to BsaA1RF122 of S.
aureus RF122 (93% identity) while those corresponding
to.SATG_00574 and SAUG_01228 are 100% identical to
BsaA2RF122.
Identification of novel Streptococcus-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

These facultative anaerobes of the phylum Firmicutes
are spherical in shape and grow in long chains. Many
species are part of the normal commensal flora of the
mouth, skin, intestine and upper respiratory tract of
humans but the genus also includes numerous human
pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, pyogenes
and agalactiae. The streptococci are known to producers of type 1 lantibiotics [67,68], such as streptin [69],
some mutacins [21,70-72], nisin U and nisin U2 [73], as
well as several non-lantibiotic bacteriocins. Here we discuss two clusters, identified in strains of S. pyogenes and
S. thermophilus LMG 18311.
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS10270 S. pyogenes (or
Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is the cause of many
important human diseases ranging from mild superficial
skin infections to life-threatening systemic diseases. Bacteriocin production by these strains may give them a

Marsh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:679
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/679

competitive advantage against the natural skin microbiota. It has previously been established that many S. pyogenes strains, as well as strains of Streptococcus salivarius,
produce the type 2 lantibiotic salivaricin A or closely
related variants [16]. The type 1 streptins (1 and 2) and
type 2 streptococcin A-FF22 are also S. pyogenes associated [69,74]. Here our analysis focuses on a type 1 cluster within the genome of S. pyogenes MGAS10270 [75].
This includes MGAS10270_Spy0919, which is 100% identical to the propeptide sequence of streptin. While this
lantibiotic is thus not novel, subsequent BLAST searches
were revealing in that they highlighted the presence of a
LanA with 97% identity in S. pyogenes MGAS10750
(MGAS10750_Spy0955) which is contained within a cluster which also encodes a LanB (MGAS10750_Spy0958)
and LanC (MGAS10750_Spy0957).
Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311 S. thermophilus
is a thermophillic, non-pathogenic Streptococcus. It is of
major importance to the fermented dairy food industry.
A number of non-lantibiotic bacteriocins (thermophilins)
from this species have been characterized, including thermophilin 347 [76], thermophilin A [77] and thermophilin
ST-1 [78]. Strain LMG 18311 was sequenced in 2004 and
at the time it was noted that bacteriocin production was
one of the characteristics that distinguishes it from strain
CNRZ1066 [79]. While the existence of a putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide gene cluster in LMG 18311 has been
reported [79,80], this cluster (Figure 3) has not been the
focus of a detailed in silico analysis. The associated LanA,
encoded by stu0097, is homologous with that predicted
to be encoded by SPCG_0144 of S. pneumoniae CGSP14
(88% identical) which, on the basis of previous in silico
analysis, is also within a lantibiotic gene cluster [81]. The
LanB protein (Stu0098) is 73% identical to SPCG_0145 of
S. pneumoniae CGSP14 and 97% identical to a truncated
LanB associated with S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 [79].
Type 1 lantibiotic gene clusters in Bacteroidetes

The Bacteroidetes are a highly diverse phylum found in
soil, seawater and the skin and intestines of animals.
The Bacteroidales class, which includes the genus Bacteroides, are the best-studied of the phylum. Bacteroides
comprises the most substantial portion of the human
gastrointestinal tract [82] some of which are opportunistic pathogens [83].
Identification of novel Chitinophaga-associated lantibiotic
gene clusters

Chitinophaga are rod-shaped mesophiles of the phylum
Bacteroidetes which are are noted for their ability to
degrade chitin [84]. There have been no reports to date
of bacteriocin production by any of the 10 Chitinophaga
species. Chitinophaga pinensis DSM 2588 (NC_013132)
is unusual in that it appears to be a Bacteroidetes possessing genes encoding a type 1 lantibiotic (Figure 4).

Page 12 of 21

Figure 4 Diagramatic representation of the Chitinophaga
pinensis (Bacteroidetes) type 1 lantibiotic operons, found in the
original NisC screen, which contain genes predicted to encode
a structrural peptide LanA, and the modification enzymes LanB
and LanC.

There are two predicted LanA peptides, corresponding
to Cpin_1438 and Cpin_1437, which are 50% identical
as a consequence of similar N-terminii. Adjacent orfs of
note include Cpin_1435 and Cpin_1440, predicted to
encode a b-lactamase and a 2-component transcriptional
regulator of the LuxR family, respectively. BLAST analysis of the associated LanB and LanC proteins
(Cpin_1436 and Cpin_1439 respectively) revealed
another putative LanB (Cpin_3392; 36% identity) and
LanC (Cpin_3397; 23% identity) encoded within the
same genome. Within this second C. pinensis-associated
cluster, Cpin_3393 possess a number of features which
suggest that it may be a LanA-encoding gene. Interestingly, BLAST analysis of the Cpin_3397-encoded LanC
also led to the identification of a number of additional
homologs apparently encoded within the genomes of
strains not previously associated with lantibiotic production. The genome of another Bacteroidetes, Spirosoma
linguale DSM 74, is notable in that it contains 4 putative LanB-encoding genes and 5 putative LanC-encoding
genes. Of these only one LanB protein (Slin_4704; 31%
identity) and one LanC protein (Slin_4705; 26% identity), are encoded within what appears to be a novel lantibiotic-associated gene cluster. This cluster contains 3
potentially LanA-encoding genes, Slin_4706-4708.
Slin_4706 and Slin_4707, which are identical and share
58% identity with Slin_4708. The genome of another
Bacteroidetes species, Pedobacter heparinus DSM 2366
(NC_013061), contains a cluster encoding two LanBs
(Phep_0556 and Phep_0557; 37% and 36% identity,

potential LanA (Phep_0553; no significant BLAST hits).
A cluster within Kordia algicida OT-1 contains LanB
(KAOT1_15523; 36% identity), LanC (KAOT1_15518;
30% identity) and LanA determinants (KAOT1_15533;
no significant BLAST hits) while Microscilla marina
ATCC 23134 potentially has five associated LanB homologs, but of these, the LanB corresponding to
M23134_03921 (28% identity) was the only one to be
located in close proximity to one of multiple LanC proteins (M23134_03925; 22% identity). The putative LanA,
M23134_03926, does not resemble any other known
proteins.

Phylogenetics of LanABC

The conserved nature of LanB and LanC proteins facilitated a phylogenetic analysis of their relatedness. The
resultant cladogram of LanB enzymes (all those identified in both screens, as well as a number of LanBs from
previously analysed clusters) highlights the existence of
two distinct phylogroups (Figure 5). The first phylogroup contains Actinobacteria-associated LanBs, all of
which are from strains not previously known to be producers of lantibiotics/lantipeptides. The second contains
a variety of lanthionine synthetases associated with
known lantibiotics (nisin, subtilin, epidermin etc), some
uncovered by previous in silico analysis (e.g. S. pneumoniae CGSP14 [81]), novel clusters from genera with
which lantibiotic production has previously been attributed as well as genera not previously associated with lantibiotic production. Within this second phylogroup one
finds two subgroups; one consisting of Bacteroidetesassociated LanBs (2A) and a second consisting of Firmicutes-associated LanB’s (2B) as well as that from
P. ancanthamoeba. Among the Firmicutes-associated
LanBs further subclustering is evident. One common
branch contains three offshoots; (i) Bacillus/Geobacillus/
Enterococcus/Clostridium, (ii) S. pyogenes and (iii)
P. acanthamoebae str. Hall’s coccus LanBs. The Staphylococcus LanBs and that of mutacin 1140 (those associated with epidermin-like peptides) also form a distinct
subgroup as do those encoded with the genomes of
S. thermophilus LMG 18311 and S. pneumoniae
CGSP14. Curiously the epicidin (S. epidermidis) LanB
does not group with any other LanB.
The cladogram of the corresponding lanthionine
synthetases (LanCs) is quite similar to that of the dehydratases (Figure 6). All can be positioned into one of
two phylogroups (phylogroups 1 and 2). Phylogroup 1
contains six Bacteroidetes-associated LanC’s. In contrast
phylogroup 2 is large and can be further divided into
group 2A, which are Actinobacteria-associated, and the
Firmicutes-associated group 2B. Further subgrouping
follows the patterns identified from analysis of the LanB
cladogram. 8 exceptional LanCs that avoid subgrouping
include those associated with C. lipophiloflavum DSM
44291, S. thermophilus LMG 18311/S. pneumoniae
CGSP14, epicidin, B. cereus F65185, N. dassonvillei
subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111, nisin-producing lactococci and Actinomyces sp. oral taxon 848.
A cladogram of the less highly conserved LanAs
revealed 13 major branches, several of which contain
only one corresponding LanA (Figure 7). Notably the
various phylogroups do not group in a phylum specific
manner to the same extent as was evident in LanB and
LanC cladograms. The largest phylogroups, i.e. phylogroups 11 and 13, are those containing the nisin-like
and epidermin-like peptides, respectively. While

Page 14 of 21

phylogroup 13 is, with the exception of the Actinomyces
sp. oral taxon 848-associated LanA, composed of Firmicutes-associated LanAs, phylogroup 11 contains LanAs
from both Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. This phylogroup contains three subgroups, with subgroup 11A
containing LanAs from E. faecalis Fly1 and C. perfringens F4969, 11B contains Actinobacteria-associated
LanAs and 11C contains both Actionobacteria- and Firmicutes-associated LanAs. Of the other phylogroups,
phylogroups 6 and 7 are largest and contain Chlamydiae/Bacteroidetes- and Actinobacteria-associated
LanAs, respectively.
Alignment of LanABC

The availability of a significant number of LanA, B and
C protein sequences enabled further in silico analysis to
identify conserved motifs and residues. Alignment of 66
LanB proteins highlighted a number conserved motifs
which are summarised in Table 5. A YxxR motif (corresponding to residues 80-83 of NisB) is conserved in 89%
of the LanB enzymes, while a GxG motif (363-365) is
present in 92% of LanBs, with the LanB of C. lipophiloflavum being exceptional by virtue of lacking both glycine residues. A GRF motif (463-465) is fully conserved
in 86% of LanBs with the Streptomyces sp. Mg1 III LanB
being the only protein to lack this motif. An RxTPFG
motif (87-94) is present in 77% of LanBs but is completely absent from the LanBs of Geobacillus sp.
G11MC16, Streptomyces sp. Mg1 III, M. aurantiaca and
C. lipophiloflavum. A FxxxYG motif (342-347) is present
in 82% of LanBs and, although present in only 50% of
LanBs, a PxxxRxxNV (501-509) motif is at least partially
conserved in many such proteins i.e. 94% contain the
proline, 71% contain the NV residues and the least conserved is the arginine with 71% conservation. Elsewhere,
there is a RFL motif (585-587) conserved in 51% of
LanBs, a RYG motif (826-828) conserved in 85% of
LanBs and a HxxxNR motif (961-966) in 70% of the
dehydratases. n addition to these, there are multiple
highly conserved residues such as aspartates at residues
121, 299, 648 and 843, prolines at 612 and 639 and a
leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine at 97, 616 and
840.
Alignment of the LanC protein also revealed several
conserved regions (summarised in Table 6). Of these,
CHG and WCYG motifs were particularly notable. The
CHG motif (corresponding to residues 330-333 of NisC)
was found to be conserved in 98% of the LanCs. The
cysteine 330 and histidine 331 residues, which act as
ligands to the zinc in the active site of NisC, have been
shown to be necessary for enzyme activity [85]. The
WCYG motif (283-286) was present in 95% of the
aligned enzymes. Within the WCYG motif, tryptophan283 (W) and cysteine284 (C) have been shown to be

refer to location in NisC) [85,86]. It has previously been
shown that although alanine subsititution of tyrosine285
(Y) results in enzyme inactivation, a phenylalanine
change is tolerated indicating that the presence of an

aromatic ring at this position is of key importance [85].
In the same study, a preceding arginine residue (Arg280),
present in 86% of these enzymes, was found not to be
essential for enzyme activity. 92% of LanCs also contained a closely located Gly289 residue. The histidine212

involved in the electrophilic activation of the carbonyl
group of dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine or in the

protonation of the enolate (thiol substrate) [85]. The
HG of this latter motif was conserved in 98% of the
enzymes (the exception being S. aureus subsp. aureus
D139). In addition to these, other motifs of note
included LxxG (39-42; conserved in 83% of LanCs),

the 70 aligned peptides. The only peptides lacking this residue are those from M. marina, B. cereus F65185, N. dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei and P. heparinus as well as
mutacin 1140. The leader regions from many actinobacteria, and especially those from phylogroup 11, are also distinctive as a consequence of the frequent presence of
proline residues.
Within the propeptide, the most highly conserved
residues are cysteines corresponding to positions 30 and
34 of the Nisin A prepropeptide [60] which significantly
are within the lipid II-binding region of the peptide.
These cysteines are each found in 86% of the type 1
LanAs. The Actinobacteria in phylogroups 10 and 11
also share a conserved or partially conserved DGCG
motif in the propeptide region. A less highly conserved
AC motif which is closer to the C terminus is also evident. In addition to motifs which are conserved across
motifs, a large number of motifs which are conserved
within phylogroups are evident.

respectively).
Although LanA peptides are less conserved than their
modification enzymes, some motifs were evident (Figure 8).
A DLD motif present in the leader region of the almost all
phylogroup 13 LanAs is also found in many other LanAs.

Conclusions
The in silico strategy adopted here resulted in the initial
identification of 56 proteins which share 20-30% identity
with NisC. Further investigation of novel LanC proteins
in turn led to the identification of even more homologs,
revealing novel lantibiotic/lantipeptide associated clusters
and establishing the existence of subgroups of LanA, B
and C proteins. Theoretically, additional homologs could
be identified through a continuation of this method but
the rate at which new homologs would be identified
would begin to level off. The approach taken led to the
identification of 49 novel clusters which, prior to this
study, had not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatic analysis. While the in silico identification of gene
clusters in a strain will not always be confirmed by detection of an associated lantibiotic/lantipeptide, past experience [22-25] suggests that there is likely to be a strong
correlation. It is thus anticipated that the peptides produced by these gene clusters will represent a valuable
resource, as will be the associated biosynthetic proteins.
This study reveals new details regarding type 1 lantibiotics and their associated clusters. Type 1 lantibiotics
have been predominantly associated with the Firmicutes,
with the Actinobacteria-produced planosporicin and
microbisporicin being notable exceptions. It is thus
interesting to find type 1 clusters distributed among the
genomes of bacteria representing four different phyla,
the Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Chlamydiae, which have been isolated from a diverse range
of habitats including soil, skin, intestines and the deepsea. Indeed, based on these investigations, it would
appear that such clusters are as common among Actinobacteria as they are among Firmicutes, with Streptomyces and Frankia sp. being particularly rich sources.

Figure 8 Alignment of the LanA prepeptides identified in this study, as well as a number of previously identified LanAs.

The Actinobacteria clusters are, in general, quite similar,
typically encoding a LanA, B, C and a methyltransferase.
The role of the methyltransferase is not clear but may
serve to protect specific serine and threonine residues
from LanB-mediated dehydration. The presence of five
clusters within the genomes of five Bacteroidetes, a phylum in which bacteriocin production is purportedly
quite rare, is particularly noteworthy. However, the
sequencing of additional representatives of this species
may well reveal this to be a common feature. The
P. acanthamoebae cluster is unusual by virtue of its presence in a representative of the Chlamydiae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the LanB and LanC proteins
from this strain are closely related to those of several
Firmicutes and thus the cluster may originally have been
acquired from such a source.
The availability of a much larger collection of LanA, B
and C sequences for further in silico analysis is also extremely useful for a number of other reasons. In addition to
providing greater certainty with respect to the proposed
conservation of particular motifs, it also reveals the existence of a greater number of subgroups of sequences than
was previously apparent. This is particularly important

with respect to LanAs as alignment of these peptides has
previously been employed as a means of subgrouping type
1 lantibiotics [2,6]. Ultimately, the most significant outcome has been the number of new type 1 lantibiotic gene
clusters. When one considers that less than 25 type 1 lantibiotics had been identified prior to this study, this represents a major expansion. While the genome sequenced
strains themselves can be accessed with a view to purifying
the associated peptides and/or utilising the biosynthetic
machinery, the information gathered will also encourage
researchers to include Actinobacteria and Bacteroiodetes
when carrying out wet lab-based screens for novel lantibiotic producers. A combination of this approach and analysis of newly generated bacterial genome sequence data
will ensure that many more lantibiotics and lantipetides
will soon be discovered which are associated with unusual
microorganisms and a wide variety of environments.

Methods
Screening of genomic databases

Using the nisin modification enzyme NisC (GenBank
accession number CAA79470) as a driver sequence, all
fully sequenced genomic sequences (approx. 1178 at

using Genomic-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sutils/genom_table.cgi). BLASTs were carried out with
default parameters; criteria for homolog detection were
a threshold of 1e-7 and greater than 20% identity.

Bioinformatic anlaysis of lanC-containing gene clusters

In cases where novel lanC-like genes encoding enzymes
were identified, the arrangement of adjacent genes was
visualised using the genome viewer on NCBI, and individual orfs were subjected to BLAST analysis to identify
those potentially involved in lantibiotic production or
immunity. The predicted LanA, LanB and LanC proteins
from these operons were each in turn used for further
in silico screens to determine their similarities to corresponding proteins associated with known lantibiotics
and to identify additional novel clusters. In instances
where a LanC- and LanB-, but not a LanA-, encoding
gene were annotated, intergenic regions were inspected
following translation by the Seqbuilder program of the
DNASTAR Lasergene 8 software package to investigate
the presence of potentially unidentified lanA genes. The
tblastn program was then used to search all sequenced
DNA for related peptides.
