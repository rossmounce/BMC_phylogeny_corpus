Abstract
Background: The Fagaceae family comprises about 1,000 woody species worldwide. About half belong to the
Quercus family. These oaks are often a source of raw material for biomass wood and fiber. Pedunculate and sessile
oaks, are among the most important deciduous forest tree species in Europe. Despite their ecological and
economical importance, very few genomic resources have yet been generated for these species. Here, we describe
the development of an EST catalogue that will support ecosystem genomics studies, where geneticists,
ecophysiologists, molecular biologists and ecologists join their efforts for understanding, monitoring and predicting
functional genetic diversity.
Results: We generated 145,827 sequence reads from 20 cDNA libraries using the Sanger method. Unexploitable
chromatograms and quality checking lead us to eliminate 19,941 sequences. Finally a total of 125,925 ESTs were
retained from 111,361 cDNA clones. Pyrosequencing was also conducted for 14 libraries, generating 1,948,579
reads, from which 370,566 sequences (19.0%) were eliminated, resulting in 1,578,192 sequences. Following
clustering and assembly using TGICL pipeline, 1,704,117 EST sequences collapsed into 69,154 tentative contigs and
153,517 singletons, providing 222,671 non-redundant sequences (including alternative transcripts). We also
assembled the sequences using MIRA and PartiGene software and compared the three unigene sets. Gene
ontology annotation was then assigned to 29,303 unigene elements. Blast search against the SWISS-PROT database
revealed putative homologs for 32,810 (14.7%) unigene elements, but more extensive search with Pfam,
Refseq_protein, Refseq_RNA and eight gene indices revealed homology for 67.4% of them. The EST catalogue was
examined for putative homologs of candidate genes involved in bud phenology, cuticle formation,
phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and cell wall formation. Our results suggest a good coverage of genes involved in
these traits. Comparative orthologous sequences (COS) with other plant gene models were identified and allow to
unravel the oak paleo-history. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
searched, resulting in 52,834 SSRs and 36,411 SNPs. All of these are available through the Oak Contig Browser
http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/Quercus_robur/index.html.
Conclusions: This genomic resource provides a unique tool to discover genes of interest, study the oak
transcriptome, and develop new markers to investigate functional diversity in natural populations.

Background
The distribution of adaptive genetic variation has
become of upmost importance in domesticated and wild
tree species for the management of natural resources
and gene conservation [1]. Monitoring of genetic diversity for adaptive traits in plants is usually implemented
in common garden experiments. Forest tree population
geneticists have struggled for decades with the establishment of such experiments called provenance tests, aiming at exploring the range and distribution of genetic
variation of fitness related traits. However, such investigations are extremely costly, as most traits can only be
evaluated after trees have reached the adult stage.
Hence provenance and progeny tests have been mainly
limited to woody species of short rotation and of economic importance, and usually undergoing intensive
breeding efforts. Species of lower economic interests or
long generation tree species, for which no breeding
activities could be conducted, have been largely unexplored for their natural genetic variation. For these species, genomics may offer a short cut to field tests for
exploring gene diversity, provided that genes of adaptive
significance have been identified. In this respect, our
objective was to develop an extensive catalogue of gene
sequences that can be used for exploring genetic variation in natural populations of tree species of widespread
ecological importance such as oaks.
Oaks belong to the genus Quercus, which comprises
several hundred diploid and highly heterozygous species
spreading throughout the northern hemisphere, from
the tropical to the boreal regions [2]. The distribution
encompasses strong ecological and climatic gradients in
the Eurasiatic as in the American continents, in an
almost continuous pattern. Throughout its natural
range, the genus has differentiated into numerous species and populations adapted to extremely variable habitats from swamps to deserts and from sea level up to
4,000 meters in the Himalayas, and expressed in very
different life history traits [3]. Because of their longevity
and their very large geographic distribution, oaks are
also key drivers of terrestrial biodiversity as they harbour large communities of insects, fungi, and vertebrates
[4]. We expect that the discovery of genes of adaptive
significance in oaks may therefore lead to significant
progress in the evolutionary genetics and ecology of
whole communities.
The genus Quercus belongs to the Fagaceae family, that
comprises other genera of ecological significance mainly
Castanea (chestnuts), Fagus (beeches), Castanopsis and
Lithocarpus [5]. Phylogenetic and historical investigations
suggest a very rapid differentiation among the different
genera, and the persistence of strong genetic relationships, especially between Quercus, Castanea, Castanopsis,

Page 2 of 24

and Lithocarpus [6,7]. Indeed earlier reports of comparative mapping indicate strong macrocolineratity within
linkage groups between Quercus and Castanea [8-10].
Hence, gene sequences of oaks may lead to a broad range
of genetic investigations within one of the largest distributed tree family.
In this study we describe the construction and analyse
the content of wide EST data corresponding to the first
large scale exploration of the transcriptome of oaks. A
total of 34 cDNA libraries were constructed from
mRNA extracted from bud, leaf, root and wood forming
tissue of the two main European white oak species
(Quercus petraea, sessile oak and Q. robur, pedunculate
oak). Tissues were also collected from abiotically challenged trees. After clustering and contig assembly of
EST sequences, comparative analysis was conducted to
assign functional annotation through similarity searches.
The project led to the construction of a biological
resource accessible at the repository centre established
by the Evoltree network of excellence http://www.evoltree.eu/index.php/repository-centre and a database
where assembly and annotations and putative SNP and
SSR markers are available http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/Quercus_robur/index.html. This
resource is vitally important not only for genomic and
genetic research in oaks and related species, but also for
larger communities harboured by oak ecosystems.

Results and Discussion
A schematic representation of data processing is shown
in Figure 1.
Sanger sequencing

We produced 145,827 Sanger reads from 20 cDNA
libraries (Tables 1 and 2), including ten libraries from
Q. petraea and ten from Q. robur. There were nine Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) and 11 cDNA
libraries. We used five different experimental systems
(kit combinations) for library construction. Two systems
were used for SSH libraries, while three systems were
used for cDNA libraries. The maximum and minimum
number of genotypes in a library was 60 for library D
and 2 for libraries B and I, respectively. There were
seven bud, seven root, four leaf and two differentiating
secondary xylem libraries. All sequences were subjected
to pre-processing (SURF and qualityTrimmer software,
see Methods section) to remove library specific cloningvector and adaptor sequences, to mask low complexity
sequences, to eliminate contaminants and poor-quality
sequences (e.g. very short reads). The resulting Sanger
catalogue contained 125,886 high quality sequences that
are available at the EST section of EMBL. Furthermore,
all of the chromatograms can be downloaded from the

name (oak) and password (oak1).
The sequencing success rate (defined as the number of
high quality reads divided by the total number of
sequences) as well as the average length of high quality
sequences varied depending on libraries (Table 2).
Excluding the three Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) libraries (C, D, E) for which these two parameters were among the lowest, the former parameter
ranged from 69% to 97.9% and the latter from 500 bp to
712 bp. Overall, the average read length of high quality
sequences was 575 bp.
SURF detected 402 chloroplastic (cp) reads, corresponding to a global rate of 0.28% (Table 3). cp
sequences were detected in all tissue types, including
leaves and buds at quite high rate, ranging from 2 to
10% (libraries C, D, Q, R), but also in root (M) and
xylem (J) at a much lower rate. There were three reads

that matched with E. coli sequence. SURF tagged a total
of 22,431 sequences as ‘not valid’ (short and/or contaminant sequences) including 1,555 and 229 sequences
flagged as ‘doubtful’ (containing library specific short
vector/adaptor sequences), and ‘pcrkitful’ (containing
short sequences from the UniVec database), respectively.
Interestingly, most of these low quality sequences were
found in libraries constructed with the lambdaZap kit
(A, M, P, S) as well as in three SSH libraries (C, D, E).
It should also be noted that about 1/3 (544) of the
‘doubtful’ sequences could be attributed without ambiguity to chimeras, because they presented library specific
sequences in the [30%-70%] interval of the sequence.
Trace2dbEST pipeline [11] also detected 63 reads with
putative chimeras. Out of 63 chimeras judged by this
pipeline, only one read was common with those
detected by SURF. The difference may result from the
different phred [12,13] and cross_match [14] parameters.

Trace2dbEST uses phred error probability cut-off of
0.05 (which corresponds to quality value (QV) of 13),
while that in SURF was 0.01 (QV = 20). The sequence
regions with the specified QV were expected to be
longer in sequences processed by trace2dbEST than by

SURF. Theoretically, the probability to detect a chimera
is higher for larger sequences. Unfortunately, trace2dbEST had less stringent parameters in cross_match compared to SURF, which decreased the rate of chimera
detection. This comparison clearly shows that parameter

sequenced by Titanium. Average depth estimated based
on the Newbler assembler was higher (varying from 7.32
to 10.08) and unique sequence rate was lower (varying
from 16.9% to 23.9%) for libraries sequenced by Titanium compared to GS-FLX (additional file 2: TableS2).
We used the pyrocleaner program from NG6 to identify too short or too long sequences, dirty sequences,
low complexity sequences and duplicated reads as
defined in the Methods section. Depending on the
library, from 14.0% (library X) to 46.3% (library III) of
the reads presented these features (Figure 2). Overall,
libraries sequenced by Titanium showed lower number
of low quality sequences (from 14.0% in library X to
18.8% in library XIV), while those sequenced by GS-FLX
showed higher values (from 22.5% in library V to 46.3%
in library III). In particular, the duplication rate was
higher in libraries sequenced by GS-FLX (7.2% to
15.9%) compared to Titanium (3.0% to 4.1%).

optimization to detect possible chimera is necessary for
each study objectives. For example, if the goal is to provide a global view of the transcriptome, chimeric clones
do not cause large problems. However, if the goal is to
bioinformatically infer full-length cDNAs, chimeric
clones must be strictly eliminated.
454-sequencing

We constructed nine libraries from Q. petraea and five
from Q. robur (Tables 4 and 5). Six libraries were established from mRNA extracted from the parental lines of
mapping pedigrees and consisted of leaves and buds
from single individuals. They were sequenced by 454
Titanium. There were four libraries from buds, two
from leaves and buds and two from flowers. These eight
libraries were sequenced by 454 GS-FLX. In total
1,948,579 reads were produced. The average read length
varied from 167 to 211 bp for libraries sequenced by
GS-FLX and from 350 to 390 bp for those sequenced by
Titanium (Table 5). We used the NG6 pipeline (see
Methods section) to detect contaminants by Blast search
and found yeast sequences in nine out of 14 libraries
(additional file 1: TableS1). No E. coli and phage
sequences were found in libraries sequenced by GSFLX, while they were detected in all the libraries

Coverage of transcripts within libraries

Transcript coverage was estimated by inferring relationship between number of ESTs in a library and number
of contigs (Figure 3) as detailed in the Methods section.
For libraries sequenced by the Sanger method (Table 6),
the maximum coverage (82.7%) was obtained for library

J, followed by library T (80.7%). These two libraries were
constructed by Creator Smart Kit (Table 1) and
sequenced from both 3’ and 5’ directions (Table 2).
They showed the plateau for the number of contigs in
OakContigV1 at the number of ESTs around 8,000
(Figure 3A). This means 8,000 ESTs were enough to
represent the transcripts in these libraries. On the other
hand, library K showed the minimum transcript coverage of 48.9% with 8,652 ESTs (Table 2). To achieve the
coverage greater than 80% in library K, about 18,000
ESTs may have been necessary. Libraries sequenced by
pyrosequencing achieved a coverage greater than 80%
(Table 6). Furthermore, for libraries sequenced by

Titanium platform (libraries from IX to XIV), the coverage was virtually 100%, which was probably attained
by both mixing RNAs from different tissues and normalization procedure used to construct these libraries
(Table 4).
Assembly

We produced three kinds of assemblies using three different approaches (Table 7). First, we processed the 134,500
Sanger reads (Table 8) resulting from the trace2dbEST
analysis using the PartiGene pipeline[15] and produced

40,944 unigene elements, containing 17,499 contigs and
23,445 singletons (Table 7). Contigs were defined in
sequence assembly, resulting from multiple reads, while
singletons were unique sequence that were not clustered
with any other reads or that were not assembled with any
other reads in a cluster. The distribution of sequence
length (bp) of contigs and singletons is indicated in additional file 3: Figure S1 (A). While the mode of the distribution resided in the (600-700] class for both singletons and
contigs, the average and maximum length of singletons
and contigs were quite different: 919 bp and 4,412 bp,

respectively for the contigs, and 485 bp and 1,305 bp for
the singletons. Of the 17,499 contigs, 6,271 (35.8%) contained two ESTs, 3,104 (17.7%) contained three ESTs,
1,842 (10.5%) contained four ESTs, 1,257 (7.2%) contained
five ESTs and 5,025 (28.7%) contained more than five
ESTs (additional file 4: Figure S2, red bars). The average
and maximum number of ESTs in a single contig was 6.3
and 510, respectively. The average GC content of this unigene sets was 41.6%. When we compared these results
with other similar studies (Table 9), the statistics of the
oak assembly were within the range of what has been
reported so far in plants. Positive relationships between
the different quantities (numbers of ESTs, unigene elements, contigs, and singletons) were evident. Even though

the number of ESTs collected was different for each study,
the percentages of contigs within each unigene set was
nearly identical (mean = 41.1%), except for the cocoa EST
assembly.
Second, we used the SIGENAE system (which relies
on the TGICL software [16], see Methods section) to
bring together in the same analysis 125,925 Sanger and
1,578,192 454-reads. Overall, 222,671 elements (69,154
(31%) tentative consensus sequences (TCs) and 153,517
(69%) singletons; OakContigV1) were obtained (Table
7). The average and maximum length of contigs was
705 bp and 7,898 bp, respectively. The distribution of
sequence length (bp) of contigs and singletons is indicated in additional file 3: Figure S1 (B). The distribution

was bimodal for both contigs and singletons. The first
peak for singletons resided in (200-300] class, where
56,249 GS-FLX reads (92.5% of total reads within the
class) resided. The second peak for singletons laid in the
(400-500] class, where 14,336 Titanium reads (95.7% of
total reads within the class) resided. For contigs, the
mode was located at the (200-300] class. Within this
class, there were 11,269 contigs (92.0% of total contigs
within the class) that were made up from GS-FLX reads
only. The average and maximum depth of contigs was
22.4 and 4,927, respectively. The deepest contig was
1,336 bp and presented similarity with a chloroplast
membrane protein from Mercurialis perennis at e-value
of 6e-10. Of the 69,154 TCs, 23,281 (33.7%) contained
two ESTs, 8,860 (12.8%) contained three ESTs, 5,069
(7.3%) contained four ESTs and 31,944 (46.2%) contained more than four ESTs (additional file 4: Figure S2,
green bars). Overall the 69,154 TCs contained 1,550,824
sequences. Among the 69,154 TCs, 40,542 (58.6%) consisted of 454-reads only, while 1,230 (1.78%) were made
up of Sanger reads only (Figure 4A). In total, 356,893
(22.6%) of the 454-reads did not cluster to Sanger reads
(139,443 singletons plus 217,450 454-reads in 40,542
TCs supported only by 454-reads). This also means that
77.4% of the 454-reads clustered with Sanger reads. The
average GC content of OakContigV1 was 39.8%.
Graphical interface to browse OakContigV1 was constructed using the Ensembl tool (oak contig browser;
http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/
Quercus_robur/index.html (user: oak, pass word: quercus33)). Browsing similarity annotation, SNP alignments
and data mining by BioMart are also available as
described in detail in Fleury et al. [17]. All of the data
can be downloaded from the web site.
Third, we used MIRA software [18] to produce direct
454-Sanger hybrid assembly. This analysis resulted into
116,826 unigene elements including 113,625 contigs and
3,201 singletons (Table 7). There were also 189,268 so
called “debris” reads, including 12,532 Sanger and
176,736 454-reads. About 54.6% (103,428 reads out of
189,268) of the sequences in the ‘debris’ corresponded
to 67.4% of the OakContigV1 singletons. The number of
Sanger and 454-reads included in assembly was 125,925
and 1,578,013, respectively. The distribution of sequence
length (bp) of contigs and singletons is indicated in
additional file 3: Figure S1 (C). For contigs, the mode
was located on the (200-300] class. Within this class,
there were 16,601 contigs (86.6% of total contigs within
the class) that were made up of GS-FLX reads only.
Among the 113,625 contigs, 72,896 (64.2%) consisted of
454-reads only, while 3,582 (3.2%) were made up of Sanger reads only (Figure 4B). In total, 421,391 (26.7%) of
the 454-reads did not cluster to Sanger reads (2,992 singletons plus 418,399 454-reads in 72,896 TCs supported

by 454-reads only). This also means that 74.3% of the
454-reads clustered together with Sanger reads, a similar
(although larger) value to that obtained using TGICL.
The average and maximum length of contigs was 671
bp and 15,177 bp, respectively (additional file 3: Figure
S1 (C)). The average and maximum depth of contigs
was 13.3 and 3,253, respectively, that is almost twice
smaller than that obtained with TGICL. Of the 113,625
TCs, 38,730 (34.1%) contained two ESTs, 15,189 (13.4%)
contained three ESTs, 8,686 (7.6%) contained four ESTs
and 51,020 (44.9%) contained more than four ESTs.
Overall the 113,625 TCs contained 1,511,639 sequences.
The average GC content of this unigene sets was 41.9%.
A total of 33.5% of the reads that did not clustered with
Sanger reads using either MIRA or TGICL assembler
were identical.

Reciprocal best Blast hits (RBHs) were searched
between unigene elements constructed by MIRA and
TGICL, PartiGene and TGICL, as well as between PartiGene and MIRA. In total 32,459 sequences were identified as RBH between MIRA and TGICL (OakContigV1)
unigene elements, which accounted for 27.8% and 14.6%
of MIRA and OakContigV1 unigene elements, respectively. In terms of contigs, 27.9% of MIRA and 38.1%
OakContigV1 contigs had RBHs, while in terms of singletons, 24.0% of MIRA and 4.0% of OakContigV1 singletons presented RBHs. This low percentage is due to
the fact that MIRA classified most of the singletons as
‘debris’. There were 17,933 RBHs between PartiGene
and OakContigV1 unigene elements, which accounted
for 43.8% and 8.05% of PartiGene and OakContigV1
unigene elements, respectively. In terms of contigs,
59.8% of PartiGene and 19.6% OakContigV1 contigs had
RBHs, while in terms of singletons, 32.2% of PartiGene
and 2.83% of OakContigV1 singletons had RBHs. There
were 13,037 RBHs between PartiGene and MIRA unigene elements, which accounted for 31.8% and 11.2% of
PartiGene and MIRA unigene elements, respectively. In
terms of contigs, 51.4% of PartiGene and 11.4% of
MIRA contigs had RBH, while in terms of singletons,
17.2% of PartiGene and 1.1% of MIRA singletons presented RBHs.
By the addition of 454-reads, the number of unigene
elements was greatly increased from 40,944 based on
the PartiGene assembly to 222,671 in OakContigV1.
This is due to 139,443 454-singletons and 40,542 contigs
that contain only 454-reads. In total, these 179,985 454unigene elements accounted for 80.8% of the OakContigV1 sequences, comprising 22.6% of the 454-reads. It
should also be pointed out that 46.8% (i.e. 10,073 Sanger
reads) of the 21,504 PartiGene singletons also present in
OakContigV1 were present as contig member of the
TGICL assembly. In addition, mapping 454-reads onto
the PartiGene assembly (using MIRA) showed that
852,986 (54.0%) reads were mapped, including 683,768
(43.3%) reads on contigs. The rest of the 454-reads did
not find corresponding sequences within the PartiGene
Sanger assembly. Because 77.4% of 454-reads were
assembled with at least one Sanger read in OakContigV1, this simple mapping procedure resulted into a
much lower rate of integration of 454-reads. All
together, these results indicate the value of the combined assembly approach based on TGICL and the
added value of 454-reads to assemble Sanger reads into
contigs. When the assembly was carried out based on
454-reads only using the MIRA assembler, we found
that 2698 (2.3%) decrease in the number of unigene elements, 60.7 bp (9.0%) decrease in the length of contigs.
Sanger reads contributed more to the length of contigs
than to the number of unigene elements.

Detection of unique peptide elements

Starting from 222,671 unigene elements in OakContigV1, FrameDP [19] predicted peptides for 117,311
(52.7%) of them (additional file 5: Figure S3), resulting
in 132,406 predicted peptides. A single peptide was predicted for 104,172 (46.8%) elements of OakContigV1,
while the rest produced multiple peptides. The maximum number of predicted peptides from one sequence
of OakContigV1 was seven. When 116,826 unigene elements plus the 189,268 ‘debris’ produced by MIRA were
used for peptide prediction (’debris’ were included here
for comparative purpose with TGICL analysis), FrameDP predicted peptides for 176,324 (57.6%) elements.
For 164,468 (53.7%) of them, there was only one peptide
predicted by FrameDP. When peptide prediction was
performed for the unigene elements produced by PartiGene, 31,798 (77.7%) presented at least one peptide.
Only one peptide was predicted for 27,273 (66.6%) unigene elements. Therefore, unigene elements of OakContigV1 presented the largest portion of non-translated
sequences (additional file 5: Figure S3). Unigene elements from MIRA analysis also presented a large portion of non-translated sequence, due to ‘debris’ reads.
When the ‘debris’ were excluded for peptide prediction,
both MIRA and PartiGene displayed similar patterns of
distribution of predicted peptides (data not shown).
Only 41.3% singletons of OakContigV1 and 28.2% of
‘debris’ in MIRA, respectively, had at least one predicted
peptide, while 67.6% of the singletons in PartiGene presented at least one predicted protein. Focusing on the
contigs, 91.2%, 77.4% and 77.7% of PartiGene, OakContigV1 and MIRA elements, respectively, had at least one
predicted peptide. Of 132,406 predicted peptides from
OakContigV1, 91,148 (68.8%) had N-terminal or
C-terminal peptide, while the rest (31.2%, i.e. 41,310 elements) was assumed to be full-length peptide with both
start and stop codons identified.
BLASTClust, a part of BLAST package [20], found
114,977 peptide clusters at 70% coverage and 75% similarity for the 132,406 OakContigV1 FrameDP-predicted peptides, which corresponded to 14.2% reduction in the total
number of predicted peptides (Figure 5B). Even with the
100% coverage and 100% similarity, 1,651 peptides clustered into 719 clusters. Those peptide sequences in the
same cluster showed complete identity. When we performed BLASTClust analysis for 189,171 FrameDP-predicted peptides from MIRA assembly plus ‘debris’, there
were 2,188 clusters (6,339 elements), in which all of the
cluster members showed the same peptide sequence. At
the 70% coverage and 75% similarity, the rate of unique
peptide was 67.1% (corresponding to 32.9% reduction)
(Figure 5C), which was smaller than that found in OakContigV1 (85.8%). Because reduction rate was higher
using MIRA, this analysis suggests that MIRA is more

using MIRA because i/ MIRA excluded a great number
of ESTs from the unigene set (so called “debris”), most
(67.4%) corresponding to singletons in the TGICL
assembly and ii/ TGICL produced less contigs (69.2 k
vs. 113.6 k) with higher depth (22.4 vs. 13.3 reads on
average) and longer length (705 vs. 671 bp on average).
Similarity searches

Similarity searches were carried out using the hybrid
assembly resulting from the TGICL pipeline (OakContigV1) that provides an approximate estimate of unique
transcripts, because it discriminates alternative spliced
transcripts. Out of 222,671 elements of OakContigV1,
homology search against protein databases resulted into
32,810 (14.7%), 52,959 (23.8%) and 37,262 (16.7%) elements with at least one hit against SWISS-PROT [21],
RefSeq_protein [22] and Pfam [23] database, respectively
at the e-value cut-off of 1e-5, while that against nucleotide databases resulted in 93,658 (42.1%) and 143,830
(64.6%) unigene elements with at least one hit against
Refseq_RNA and eight TIGR gene indices [24], respectively. The result of BlastN against eight gene indices
showed that both the number of hits and aligned length
of the high-scoring segment pair (HSP) were the greatest for sequences in VVGI (Vitis vinifera) and least in
SGI (Picea sp.) (Figure 6). This may partly reflects the
phylogenetic position of Quercus within the eurosids I.
In total, 150,063 (67.4%) of OakContigV1 sequences had
at least one hit in this homology search process, while
the remaining sequences (72,608, i.e. 32.6%) were
orphans, which may be considered as oak specific. However, caution should be made to consider orphan

efficient to distinguish not only polymorphisms and substitutions but also splice variants in the assembly step.
This partly explains the difference in the depth of contigs.
Contigs by MIRA had an average depth of 13.3, while that
of OakContigV1 was 22.4. The BLASTClust result for PartiGene unigene elements (Figure 5A) showed similar trend
to that of OakContigV1.
All together, the comparison of the procedures that
were tested to assemble Sanger and 454-reads resulted
into the following conclusions: first, there was an added
value (in terms of integration of 454-reads) to perform a
combined analysis of 454 and Sanger reads compared to
a simple mapping procedure of the 454 data onto a Sanger unigene set, second, a seeded assembly using TGICL
was found to be more efficient than a direct assembly

sequences as oak specific without experimental validation of such sequences in cDNAs. Gene ontology (GO)
[25] annotation assigned at least one GO term for
29,303 (13.2%) of OakContigV1 sequences. The average
number of GO annotations per sequence was 5.08,
while the maximum number of annotation per sequence
was 46. The total number of GO terms was 4,960.
When these terms were mapped onto plant specific GO
slim terms, the number of term converged to 69 terms
(Figure 7). The most abundant GO slim terms were
Transport, Nucleotide binding, Plastid, in terms of Biological process, Molecular function and Cellular component, respectively. Candidate genes of ecological or
economic importance were found in OakContigV1 as
illustrated for bud phenology (additional file 6: Table
S3), drought stress resistance with emphasis on cuticle
formation (additional file 7: Table S4) and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (additional file 8: Figure S4). Genes
relating to cell wall formation were detected based on
tBlastX searches against MAIZEWALL database [26]
(Additional file 9: Table S5). These results demonstrate
the value of the EST catalogue that was produced for
future functional genomics studies in oaks.
To further analyse the added value of Sanger reads in
terms of annotation, we compared the annotation rate
of 454 and Sanger unigene elements. From the 40,542
contigs and 139,444 singletons containing 454-reads
only, 5,404 (13.3%) contigs and 33,047 (23.7%) singletons did not show a single Blast hit, whereas, from the
28,612 contigs and 14,073 singletons containing at least
one Sanger read, these numbers drop down to 391
(1.37%) contigs and 1,351 (9.60%) singletons. This result
clearly indicates the value of Sanger reads for functional
annotation. Therefore it can be concluded that Sanger
reads improve not only the assembly but also the annotation of large dataset produced by next generation
technology. The fact that the lower annotation (no blast
hit) rate of unigene elements containing 454-reads only
may also suggest they contain higher rate of novel or
artifactual transcripts. Tedersoo et al. [27] indicated that
singletons from 454-reads contained higher rate of artifactual reads. Further laboratory work and/or bioinformatic characterization may be needed for the validation
of singletons in OakContigV1.
In silico mining of Simple Sequence repeats (SSRs) and
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

Using mreps [28], we found 52,834 SSRs (microsatellites) with minimum repeat of five, four, three, three
and three for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-SSRs,
respectively, in 38,653 unigene elements of OakcontigV1. Specific information for each SSR included the
unigene element ID and the annotation, the repeat
motif, its length and position (Additional file 10: Table

Page 13 of 24

S6, also available through the Quercus portal https://w3.
pierroton.inra.fr:8443/QuercusPortal/Home.jsf). Dinucleotide as well as trinucleotide motifs were frequent,
summing up 72.9% of the total number of microsatellites (Table 10). Among dinucleotide and trinucleotide
repeats, AG and AAG motifs, respectively, were the
most frequent. Only 40 CG repeats were found. Tetranucleotide (10.5%), pentanucleotide (6.8%) and Hexanucleotide (9.9%) repeats were of low abundance. The
frequency of microsatellites was 23.7% considering multiple occurrence in a same unigene element, which was
close to that calculated by Durand et al. [29] for 28,024
Sanger unigene elements in oak (18.6%). When we
screened microsatellites within eight TIGR gene indices
[24] used in the similarity search (see Method section)
with the same method (ie. mreps), the most frequent
motif was tri-SSRs (Additional file 11: Figure S5), which
confirmed the general trend in SSR frequency for plant
ESTs [30]. It should be noted, however, that definition
of microsatellite and detection algorithm have great
impact on number of detected microsatellite in silico
[31]. When the distribution of SSR motif was visualized
by SOM (Self Organizing Map), OakContigV1 located
near PPLGI (Populus) (Figure 8), which may again
reflect the phylogenetic position of oaks in the eurosid I.
When SSR locations (coding or non-coding) were estimated by combining results from ESTScan [32] and
mreps as in Durand et al. [29], the location for 38,649
(73.2%) SSRs was estimated and the same trends were
found (Additional file 12: Figure S6). In brief, tri-SSRs
were the most frequently found in coding regions
(33.4% of the total SSRs with location estimation), while
di-SSRs were frequent (27.2%) in non-coding regions.
Because of functional constraints of peptides, tri-SSRs
with no frame shift mutations are preferable for coding
regions [33]. As discussed in [27], di-SSRs in non-coding
regions were more frequently found in 5’ UTRs of plant
transcripts [34], suggesting that they may be involved in
gene expression regulation.
SNP detection was carried out on a subset of the 69,154
contigs. We first took into account the presence of
duplicated reads in order to avoid false SNP detection
[35,36], i.e. a single representative was kept for the analysis. Then, putative SNPs were screened for contigs
with a coverage depth of more than six sequences. If the
less frequent allele count was more than two and 100%
identical for four bases before and after the polymorphic
site, we considered this site as a putative SNP. The
putative SNPs were identified among 13,334 (19.2%)
contigs, resulting in 36,411 sites and an average of 1
SNP every 471 bp in contigs with putative SNPs. Average and maximum number of SNPs detected in a contig
was 2.7 and 19, respectively. Transition type SNPs (A/G
and T/C) were relatively frequent and amounted to

67.18% (Table 11). Within FrameDP-predicted peptides,
there were 48,247 SNPs, which resulted in 27,762
(57.54%) SNPs in coding regions, including 17,620
(36.52%) and 10,140 (21.02%), synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs, respectively. SNP density in oak was
lower compared to that found in Eucalyptus grandis transcriptomes (1 SNP every 192 bp) based on 21 individuals
using GS Reference Mapper (454 Life Science, Branford,
CT, USA) [37]. If we apply the same criteria to calculate
SNP frequency to that of the Eucalyptus study (SNP
called within contig length >200 bp and contig depth
>10), the frequency remained identical (1 SNP every 471
bp), though we used more than 200 individuals for the
sequencing step. In a de novo assembly of a coral larval
transcriptome with 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing [38],
SNPs were screened by QualitySNP program and 33,433
SNPs were identified resulting in 1 SNP per 207 bp. The
oak SNP frequency was still lower, probably due to more
stringent criteria used for SNP detection. Using information from the predicted peptides by FrameDP (only one
peptide predicted for each unigene element to avoid chimeric elements) and clustering by BLASTClust (at 70%
coverage and 75% similarity), a set of 20,826 SNPs,
including 16,196 and 4,630 potential coding and noncoding SNPs, respectively, was selected. We also found
59 SNPs relating to chloroplast (45) and mitochondrial
(14) sequences. After these SNPs were eliminated, 20,810
genomic SNPs were retained for future genetic study.

Gene diversity was calculated for 308 and 1,770 SNP
sites within Q. robur and Q. petraea, respectively (for
criteria to select SNP sites for gene diversity calculation,

Peptides were predicted by FrameDP, which often produces multiple peptide
for a single unigene elements. Because location of SNP sites (coding/noncoding) were estimated for each predicted peptide, the sum of coding and
non-coding SNPs exceeded the total number (36,411) of SNPs. Tri-nucleotides
are polymorphic sites with three alleles.

Detection of orthologous and paralogous gene pairs
between oak and the eudicotyledons sequenced
reference genomes

Recently, Salse et al. [41] published an original and
robust method for the identification of orthologous
regions between plant genomes as well as for the detection of duplications within genomes based on integrative
sequence alignment criteria combined with a statistical
validation. This approach was applied to identify 7
paleo-duplications in monocots and eudicots and to
propose a common ancestor with 5 and 7 chromosomes
for the monocots and eudicots respectively [42]. In the
current study, we used the 31,798 unigene set resulting
from the PartiGene assembly and FrameDP analysis to
integrate the oak transcriptome information into previous paleo-genomics analysis in order to unravel the
oak evolutionary paleo-history.
Using the alignment parameters and statistic tests previously described by Salse et al. [42,43], we analysed the
orthologous relationships between oak, Arabidopsis
(33,198 gene models), poplar (30,260 gene models),
grape (21,189 gene models) and soybean (46,194 gene
models) genomes. Based on the 31,798 oak unigene elements, we identified 4,574 orthologous gene pairs
between oak and Arabidopsis (477 orthologs), poplar
(658 orthologs), grape (1,825 orthologs) and soybean
(1,614 orthologs) genomes. The Ks distribution analysis
(Figure 9A) performed between the 4,574 orthologous
gene pairs establishes that oak is most closely related at
the sequence level to grape (brown curve and arrow)
than any other eudicot genome included in the analysis.
We then produced a heterologous oak gene map based
on the precise identification of oak orthologs on the 19
grape chromosomes (Figure 9B). This 1,825 robust

Ueno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:650
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/650

orthologs identified between oak and grape can be considered as a valuable source of COS (Comparative
Orthologous Sequences) markers for further comparative genomics and genetics analysis [43].
We applied the most robust and direct approach allowing the characterization of genome duplications that consists of aligning the available unigene set (31,798
elements) on itself using stringent alignment criteria and
statistical validation described in Salse et al. [43]. The Ks
distribution analysis (Figure 9C) obtained for 1,526 (43%)
of the 3,520 paralogous gene pairs available (black bars)
when compared to that obtained for Arabidopsis (1,646
paralogs, light blue curve), poplar (4,164 paralogs, red
curve), grape (542 paralogs, brown curve), and soybean
(9,532 paralogs, blue curve) genomes clearly established
that the actual oak genome went through at least two
rounds or series of whole genome duplications (grey
boxes on Figure 9C), such as ancestral (referenced as g in
the literature based on grape distribution peak in brown)
shared by the eudicots and more recent (referenced as a/
b based on the Arabidopsis distribution peak in light blue
or p based on soybean and poplar distribution peaks
respectively in dark blue and red).

Conclusions
We collected about 146 K Sanger and 2 M 454-ESTs for
two oak species: Q. petraea and Q. robur. Seeded assembly
by TGICL software produced 222,671 unigene elements
(OakContigV1: 69,154 contigs and 153,517 singletons). On
the one hand, the 454-pyrosequencing data contributed to
greatly increased the number of unigene elements compared to that obtained by assembling Sanger reads only
(40,944 unigene elements). On the other hand, Sanger
reads significantly improved the quality of the assembly
both in terms of clustering and annotation
Based on similarity searches, we identified candidate
genes for traits of ecological importance as well as comparative orthologous sequences (COS) which were
mapped onto Vitis (grape) chromosomes. These COSs
may be considered as a valuable source of genetic markers for comparative genomic analysis. Evolutionary
analysis also showed that grape was the closest to oak
within the eudicots. Additional data mining within OakContigV1 identified 52,834 SSRs and 36,411 putative
SNPs that can be used as functional markers in future
studies. These resources are publically available from
the oak contig browser at http://genotoul-contigbrowser.

This large collection of expressed sequence tags provide an important resource for the scientific community
that is interested in the molecular genetics and functional genomics of Oaks. It is a fundamental resource
for analysis of gene expression, discovery of genes of

ecological interest, comparative mapping, and annotation of the forthcoming oak genome sequence.

Methods
Plant material for Sanger sequencing

Plant material used to generate the cDNA and SSH
libraries were collected from different tissues, developmental stages or after different treatments. Below we
summarize (into six categories) the 20 libraries that were
produced for Q. robur and Q. petraea (see Table 1):
i/ libraries H and I: Quercus petraea seedlings were
grown at INRA Nancy (North East of France). Acorns
were harvested in a local forest and sown in 10 L containers with a peat and sand mixture (1/1: v/v). A complete fertilisation (4.5 g L -1 of slow-release fertiliser
Nutricote T100; N/P/K/Mg: 13/13/13/2 + trace elements
and 0.2 g L-1 of lime) was provided at the beginning. All
individuals were watered daily to field capacity with
deionized water. The seedlings were 22-24 weeks old
when submitted to five different treatments. Three different seedlings were submitted to each stress. For the
cold (10°C for 3 days) and heat (35°C for 4 days) stress
treatments, growth cabinets were used. The elevated
CO2 treatment (700 ppm for 18 days) was done using a
climate controlled greenhouse. For the drought stress
treatment, irrigation was stopped, the soil humidity was
measured daily using a TDR (Trase 6050X1, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara CA, USA) and
seedlings were harvested at about 17% remaining soil
humidity. For root hypoxia, the seedlings were placed
into water tight containers and the water level was
maintained 1 cm above soil level. All stresses were
pooled and three biological replicates were extracted
and mixed in equal amount for cDNA synthesis.
ii/ libraries B, J, K, L, P, S: adult trees from South
West of France (INRA Pierroton forestry station) were
sampled in their natural area. Leaves were taken in summer, differentiating xylem in spring and vegetative buds
both in winter and spring to provide different bud
development stages from the same genotypes.
iii/ libraries A, C, D, E: vegetative buds from one- or
two-year old seedlings from North West of France were
acclimated in the nursery of INRA Pierroton (South
West of France).
iv/ library M: roots from one-year old trees were
grown under optimal conditions in a greenhouse at
INRA Nancy.
v/ libraries Q, R: second flush sun-leaves were harvested in greenhouse grown plants in summer 2004 on
one-year old cuttings from high and low water-use efficient genotypes identified in Brendel et al. [44].
vi/ libraries F, G, N, O, T: cuttings were obtained from
10 sessile and 10 pedunculate oak trees in August 2006
at INRA Pierroton. After three months of growth,

cuttings were placed into oxygenated water tight containers for 2 weeks in a growth chamber providing a 16h photoperiod, a day/night temperature of 25°C/20°C, a
day/night relative humidity of 85%/70% and a quantum
flux of 260 μmol m -2 s -1 . Root hypoxia was then
imposed by using deoxygenated water obtained by

bulling with N2, in order to maintain the O2 concentration below 5 mg L-1. White roots from each genotype
and species were sampled after 6, 24 and 48 hours of
hypoxia. In all cases, white roots were immediately
dipped in liquid nitrogen to prevent degradation and
stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.

RNA extraction for Sanger sequencing

Oak material was collected from either field grown trees
or seedlings raised in greenhouse or phytotrons. Plant
material used as RNA source for cDNA and subtractive
library construction was detailed above. For each library
devoted to Sanger sequencing, total RNA was extracted
following the procedure described by Le Provost et al.
[45] with a final purification step using the RNAeasy kit
(QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France).
cDNA library construction for Sanger sequencing

Depending on the quantity of each tissue, cDNA
libraries were constructed using either CloneMiner
cDNA Library Construction Kit (Invitrogen Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Stratagene cDNA synthesis kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) when plant material was
abundant, or Creator SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View,
CA, USA) when plant material was limiting.
For libraries constructed with CloneMiner kit, mRNA
was isolated from 200 μg of total RNA of each genotype
using Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen
Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 μg of mRNA.
Ligation to attB1 adapter, cDNA size-fractionation and
recombination reaction between pDONR222 vector and
cDNAs were performed as described in the User Manual. Finally, ElectroMax DH10B T1 Phage Resistant
Cells (Invitrogen Corporation) were transformed with
recombinant plasmids by electroporation. Each library
titer was estimated on Kanamycin LB plates (50 μg mL1
). Libraries were stored at -80°C in glycerol Super Optimal broth with Catabolite repression (SOC) medium
until sequencing.
Libraries constructed using the Stratagene kit were
done according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
The resulting cDNAs were packaged into l ZAP II
phages using the Gigapack III Gold packaging kit
(Stratagene).
For libraries constructed with Creator kit, equal quantities of total RNA from each genotype were mixed and
cDNA synthesis was then performed from 1 μg of total
RNA by long distance PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sfi1 digestion, cDNA size fractionation, plasmid ligation and transformation into
ElectroMax DH10B T1 Phage resistant cells were done
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. An aliquot of
each transformation was spread on Chloramphenicol LB
plates (30 μg mL -1 ) to determine the percentage of
recombinant clones. When more than 75% of recombinant clones were obtained, transformation mixtures
were pooled together to constitute the library. If necessary, new ligations were performed to give a final library
of approximately 106 clones: the titer was estimated on

Page 18 of 24

Chloramphenicol LB plates. Glycerol SOC medium was
added and libraries were stored at -80°C.
For suppression subtractive hybridization libraries, we
used the method, originally described by Diatchenko
et al. [46], that is based on selective amplification of differentially expressed sequences. All libraries were comprised of a unique tissue collected on several genotypes
of Quercus species. Total RNA was extracted using the
method described above. Double-stranded tester cDNA
and driver cDNA were prepared from 1 μg total RNA of
each sample using the SMART™PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
forward subtracted libraries were constructed using the
PCR-select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech). Amplified,
differentially expressed cDNA fragments were cloned
into either the pGEM T easy vector (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) or the PCR4 TOPO kit from Invitrogen. ESTs
were obtained from the following tissues:
• Bud: three SSH libraries (C, D, E), obtained as
detailed in Derory et al. [47]
• Leaf: two SSH libraries (Q, R) obtained using total
RNA extracted from leaves sampled on 5 genotypes displaying extreme phenotypes for water-use-efficiency
(WUE). The libraries were obtained by subtracting RNA
form High WUE phenotypes vs. Low WUE phenotypes,
and vice-versa [48].
• Root: four SSH libraries (N and O for Q. robur, F
and G for Q. petraea) constructed by subtracting sessile
against pedunculate mRNA and vice-versa for early (6
hours) and late (24 and 48 hours pooled) flooding stress.
Sanger DNA sequencing

Sequencing was completed using the standard Sanger
method as described by Sanger et al. [49]. Briefly, clones
were randomly isolated and arranged individually in
384-well microtitre plates for storage and processing
and subjected to high-throughput single-path sequencing from either their 5’- and/or 3’-ends. cDNA libraries
were sequenced at “Centre National de Séquençage”
(Genoscope, Evry, France). SSH libraries were sequenced
at the “Genome & Transcriptome” facility of Bordeaux.
Briefly recombinant clones were re-amplified using M13
universal primer. PCR products were then purified using
Multiscreen PCR micro 96 kit (Millipore, San Francisco,
CA, USA) and subjected to single pass sequencing from
their 5’-and/or 3’-end using BigDye version 3.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. All the sequences were
run on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster city,
CA, USA) sequencing machine.
Plant material for pyrosequencing

Plant material was collected on different genotypes
(Table 4):

Ueno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:650
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/650

i/ libraries I to IV: buds were taken from two populations (30 Q. petraea genotypes each) at endo- and ecodormancy to provide clues about genes differentially
expressed between these two developmental stages.
ii/ libraries V and VI: leaves and buds were sampled
from two species (Q. robur and Q. petraea, 10 genotypes
each) for the discovery of genes involved in species
divergence.
iii/ libraries VII and VIII: pollen and flowers were collected on 2 Q. petraea and 2 Q. robur genotypes, to
enrich the tissue panel with reproductive organs.
iv/ libraries IX to XIV: buds and leaves were collected
on 6 parental trees of three full-sub pedigrees to detect
polymorphic markers for genetic linkage mapping.
RNA extraction for pyrosequencing

Total RNA was extracted as described by Le Provost
et al. [45]
cDNA library construction for pyrosequencing

We used the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) and MINT cDNA synthesis Kit (Evrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Library normalization
was done for libraries IX to XIV by Beckman Coulter
Genomics (Grenoble, France) using Duplex-SpecificNuclease (Evrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
454-sequencing

cDNA nebulisation, adaptor ligation, emulsion PCR and
sequencing were done at Beckman Coulter Genomics
(Danvers, MA, USA). Sequencing was performed using a
Roche-454 Genome Sequencer platform (FLX or Titanium technology).
Sequence processing

We have summarized the approach that was followed in
Figure 1 (blue boxes).
A total of 145,827 Sanger ESTs were cleaned using the
SeqUence Repository and Feature detection pipeline
(SURF, http://surf.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/surf.cgi, user
name: oak, password: oak1). The documentation of
SURF can be found at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/doc/
bioinfo/edition/surf-1.0/SURF.pdf. SURF includes: i/
base calling by phred [12,13], ii/ masking and clipping
of library specific vectors/adaptors using cross_match
[14] with -minmatch 10 -minscore 15, iii/ masking low
complexity regions (mononucleotide repeats) using
RepeatMasker [50], iv/ screening of PCR kit sequences
using cross_match against short UniVec ftp://ftp.ncbi.
nih.gov/pub/UniVec/ sequences with parameters -minmatch 8 -minscore 10, v/ screening and elimination of
possible contaminants in putative insert using cross_match on the UniVec with -minmatch 10 -minscore 25

Page 19 of 24

and short UniVec with -minmatch 10 -minscore 15, as
well as on E. coli and yeast sequences with -minmatch
100 -minscore 150, and vi/ detection of chloroplast
sequences using cross_match with -minmatch 100 -minscore 150. The Quercus robur chloroplast genome
sequence was kindly provided by F Sebastiani and GG
Vendramin from CNR (Florence, Italy). The detailed
parameters used in SURF are documented on the SURF
web site. Three other features, namely “doubtful”,
“pcrkitful” and “not valid” were added by SURF. If
library specific vectors, adaptors and primers were
detected inside an insert, SURF judged the sequence as
“doubtful” (possible chimera), if SURF detected short
UniVec sequences inside an insert, the sequence was
labelled as “pcrkitful” and if SURF detected contaminants inside an insert, “not valid” status was attached to
the sequence. Too short sequences (length < 100) with
high quality (phred QV > 20) were discarded for further
analysis.
Prior to submission of sequences to the EMBL database, reads were further processed by qualityTrimmer in
Euler-SR package [51] with the option -minQual 20. As
indicated in Table 2, a total of 125,886 ESTs were finally
submitted to EMBL: 57,750 for Q. petraea and 68,136
for Q. robur. These sequences can be accessed by submitting the following query: Quercus [Organism name]
and Frigerio [Authors] to EMBL. Quality scores can be
downloaded from SURF web site.
Sanger reads were also processed by trace2dbEST (ver.
3.0.1) pipeline [11] using the default parameters except
that the minimum sequence length, required for
sequences to pass further analysis, was set at 60 bp. The
phred [12,13] parameter for error probability was set to
0.05 (default value). The cross_match [14] parameters
for vector (including adaptor) and E. coli masking were
set at -minmatch 10 -minscore 20 and -minmatch 20
and -minscore 30, respectively. These cross_match parameters corresponded to the default values for trace2dbEST. Screening libraries, which included any sequences
of adaptors, adaptor and vector junctions and vectors,
were constructed for each vector and adaptor combinations. Poly A/T sequences with repeats ≥12 were also
screened and masked. Possible chimera sequences were
suggested by trace2dbEST if vector and/or E. coli
sequences were detected in the middle of an insert.
They were then discarded from further analysis.
The 454-reads (1,948,579 sequences) were screened by
cross_match [14] for primers and adaptors and then
masked. For each 454-read, the longest non-masked
region was extracted and further cleaned-up by SeqClean
[52]. The shorter regions were discarded in order to take
care of potential chimeras. This process resulted into
1,578,192 clean reads. The sequencing statistics for 454reads were calculated by NG6 system (http://vm-bioinfo.

Ueno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:650
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/650

toulouse.inra.fr/ng6/, user name: oak, password: quercus33). SRA (Sequence Read Archive) accession number
is SRA012448 and can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/sra. In NG6, four kinds of analysis were performed in parallel for each library: i/ in the first analysis,
contaminants were searched for E. coli, phage and yeasts
with Blast, ii/ in the second, the quality of each read was
analyzed, iii/ in the third, reads were analyzed by pyrocleaner, to remove too short or too long sequences
(sequences with more than or less than two standard
deviations from the mean), dirty sequences (sequences
with more than 4% of N), low complexity sequences and
duplicated reads [35,36], and iv/ in the fourth, reads were
assembled by Newbler (Roche) within each library. The
duplicated reads in step iii were defined as clusters by
megablast with minimum hit score of 100, percent identity cut-off of 98, alignment of reads starting exactly at
the same position and ending in a 70 bp window of the
end of the longest sequence.
Coverage of transcripts within libraries

In order to estimate the coverage of transcripts within
libraries, we first randomized links between a EST
sequence and the corresponding contig. Secondly, for
each library, 100 EST sequences were selected and the
number of corresponding contigs was counted. The second step was repeated until no EST sequences were left
for the library. The relationship between number of EST
sequences (X) and the number of contigs (Y) were modelled by the following equation:
Y = A{1 − exp(BX )}

where A and B are coefficients determined by nls
function of R language http://www.r-project.org/. The
coefficient A indicates the expected maximum number
of contigs (transcripts) in a library under this model.
The coefficient B as well as A relates to the rate of the
increase of the number of contigs. The library coverage
was defined as the ratio of the observed number of contigs by the coefficient A. We excluded libraries C, D, E,
G, N, Q and R for this analysis, because they did not
contain enough ESTs.
Sequence assembly

Assembly of Sanger and 454-reads was first carried out
using the SIGENAE system http://www.sigenae.org/ that
is based on the TGICL software http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/[16]. This software uses the CAP3
assembler [53] that takes into account the quality of
sequenced nucleotides into the computation of the
alignment score. The different steps of the assembly are
highlighted in red in Figure 1. First, Sanger reads were
assembled into 15,835 tentative consensus sequences

Page 20 of 24

(TC) using TGICL (mgblast, a modified version of
megablast [54] and CAP3). The software FrameDP [19]
was then used to predict complete ORF of 2,000 TC
(the longest ones) with SWISS-PROT [21] as a reference, resulting in 224 TCs which potentially contain
full-length coding sequences (starting with a methionine
residue and ending with a stop codon). The TCs were
used to split large clusters built by mgblast using the
sclust program within TGICL. Global assembly was performed using TGICL with 125,925 Sanger ESTs, 224
TCs and the 1,578,192 454-ESTs with sequence qualities
and options of (-l) minimum overlap length of 100, (-p)
minimum percent identity for overlap of 96 and (-s)
splitting clusters larger than 100,000. The resulting
222,671 contigs and singletons were called OakContigV1
and are available at http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/Quercus_robur/index.html (user: oak,
password: quercus33). Because all of the sequences
resulted from assembly were directly loaded into the
OakContigV1 database, low quality regions were not filtered out.
MIRA (V3rc4) software [18,55] was also used to
directly perform hybrid assembly of Sanger and 454reads (Figure 1, purple boxes), instead of assembling the
consensus of 454 data with Sanger reads as in TGICL.
MIRA was run with a standard options (-job = denovo,
est, normal, sanger, 454) and no XML files. The assembly by MIRA was compared with OakContigV1. Contigs
showing Reciprocal best Blast Hit (RBH) was searched
between sequences in OakContigV1 and MIRA assembly
by using BlastN with “soft” filtering option. Soft filtering
makes it efficient to detect orthologous sequences [56].
We also used the PartiGene (ver. 3.0.5) pipeline [15]
to compare OakContigV1 assembly to the assembly constructed using Sanger reads only (Figure 1, green boxes).
The sequences cleaned by trace2dbEST were grouped,
using CLOBB [57], into clusters based on Blast similarity. Sequences in the same cluster were then assembled
using Phrap [14] (using the default parameters of PartiGene). The resulting 40,944 unigene elements (23,730
singletons and 17,214 contigs) were used for peptide
prediction using FrameDP [19]. The resulting 36,883
peptide sequences were finally used to detect comparative orthologous markers (see section below). Assemblies
within each Sanger library were also conducted by PartiGene to estimate redundancy rate of libraries. The
assembly by PartiGene was compared with OakContigV1. Contigs showing RBH was searched between
sequences in OakContigV1 and PartiGene assembly by
using BlastN with “soft” filtering option [56].
Finally, MIRA (V3.0.0) software was used to map 454reads to the unigene elements constructed by PartiGene
with the following options (job = mapping, normal, 454)
and no XML files for 454-reads.

Annotation and similarity searches

A functional annotation was assigned for each contig
and singleton of Oakcontigv1 (Figure 1, gray boxes).
The strategy is based on homology search with public
protein and nucleic acid sequence databases. BlastX [20]
was carried out against SWISS-PROT (Release 57.1 of
14-Apr-2009) [21] and RefSeq_protein (Release 34 of 6March-2009) [22] with e-value cut-off at 1e-5. Conserved protein domains were searched against Pfam
(Release 23.0 of 20-Jul-2008) [23] with e-value cut-off at
1e-5. Blastn was carried out against OakContigV1,
Refseq_RNA (Release 34 of 6-March-2009) and TIGR
gene indices with e-value cut-off of 1e-30, 1e-5 and 1e2, respectively. We used the following TIGR gene
indices [24]: AGI (Arabidopsis_thaliana release_14),
HAGI (Helianthus_annuus release_6), NTGI (Nicotiana_tabacum release_5), MTGI (Medicago_truncatula
release_9), OGI (Oryza_sativa release_17), PPLGI (Populus release_4), SGI (Picea release_3) and VVGI (Vitis_vinifera release_6). These gene indices were selected so as
to represent phylogenetic relationships of land plants as
follows: gymnosperm (SGI), monocots (OGI), rosids
(VVGI), rosid I (MTGI and PPLGI), rosid II (AGI),
asterid I (NTGI) and asterid II (HAGI). The Gene
Ontology (GO) [25] annotation was based on the best
hit in SWISS-PROT. The GO terms were mapped upon
plant GOslim terms using Blast2GO software [58].
Detection of unique peptides based on FrameDP peptide
prediction

Because oak ESTs contain sequences from about 200
individuals of Q. robur and Q. petraea, we expected to
detect not only polymorphisms within species but also
substitutions between species in the combined assembly.
In addition, ESTs were collected from multi-stressed
libraries (Table 1), which are likely to increase the number of splice variants. These factors may split EST clusters into multiple contigs. In order to estimate the
minimum unigene sets, FrameDP [19] was used, translating assembled sequences into peptide sequences
(Figure 1, orange boxes). The TAIR9_pep sequences
(available at ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/
Sequences/blast_datasets/) were used as reference
sequences in FrameDP. The resulting peptide sequences
from OakContigV1 were further clustered by BLASTClust, a part of the BLAST package [20] to provide a
set of unique peptide that was further used to retain
in silico SNPs within coding sequences.
Identification of candidate genes

Candidate genes for bud phenology related genes (list
kindly provided by M. Lascoux & G. Zaina) were
searched against peptide sequences estimated by FrameDP. The predicted peptide sequences were used in

Page 21 of 24

BlastP with e-value cut-off set at 1e-5. Drought stress
resistance candidate genes with emphasis on cuticle formation in Arabidopsis thaliana were searched within
OakContigV1 by BlastP or BlastX with e-value cut-off of
1e-10. Genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway within
OakContigv1 were also targeted. We used GO annotation (see previous section) to convert GO terms into
enzyme code (EC) using Blast2GO software [58]. Those
EC corresponding to the phenylpropanoid pathway were
mapped on the corresponding KEGG map [59]. In order
to detect genes related to cell wall formation in OakContigV1, tBlastX was performed against the MAIZEWALL database [26] with e-value cut-off of 1e-10.
In silico mining of SSRs and SNPs

To detect simple sequence repeats (SSRs), we used
mreps [28] and listed microsatellites with minimum
repeat number of five, four, three, three and three for
di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-SSRs, respectively. SSRs
were also screened within eight gene indices used for
the annotation (see the section “Annotation and similarity searches”). To visualize phylogenetic similarity of the
SSR motif distribution, data were analyzed by self organizing map (SOM) using som_pack (ver. 3.1) [60],
which utilizes unsupervised pattern recognition
algorithms.
For SNP detection, we first took into account the presence of duplicated reads in order to avoid false SNP
detection [35,36], i.e. a single representative was kept for
the analysis. Then, putative SNPs were screened for
contigs with a coverage depth of more than six
sequences. If the less frequent allele count was more
than two and 100% identical for four bases before and
after the polymorphic site, we considered this site as a
putative SNP. SNPs were summarized according to the
following categories: transition/transversion, synonymous/non-synonymous and coding/non-coding. The
frame-corrected nucleotide sequences inferred by FrameDP [19] as coding regions were used for the identification of “coding SNPs”. By fasty35 program in FASTA
package [61], we re-mapped the frame-corrected nucleotide sequence onto corresponding OakContigV1 original
sequence. The peptide sequences inferred by FrameDP
were used as references to identify non-synonymous
mutations at the SNP site. Using tfasty35, non-synonymous mutations were identified by alignment of the
allelic peptide sequence with the reference peptide
sequence. Finally, a more stringent set of SNPs was
retained, considering contigs for which a single protein
was predicted by FrameDP. In addition, SNPs whose
unigene elements represented significant blast hits with
organelle sequences (Q. robur chloroplast kindly provided by F Sebastiani and GG Vendramin from CNR,
Florence, Italy and Vitis vinifera mitochondria [62])

Ueno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:650
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/650

were detected. The percent identity and coverage
threshold was set at 90% and 80%, respectively, for
chloroplast and 60% and 70%, respectively, for mitochondria. These SNPs useful for population genetic studies were discarded from the nuclear SNP data set. Both
nuclear and organelle SNPs data sets have been made
available at Quercus portal https://w3.pierroton.inra.
fr:8443/QuercusPortal/Home.jsf. SNPs whose unigene
elements presented Sanger reads with significant hit
with Q. robur chloroplast sequence in the SURF process
were also eliminated.
2
Gene diversity ( H E = n(1 − ∑ p i ) / (n − 1) ), where n
i

is the number of reads included for the calculation and
P i is allele frequency, was estimated for Quercus. At
SNP sites in each assembly, we randomly selected one
read from each library to avoid multiple sampling of the
same allele in the same individual. We only targeted
SNP sites with number of reads ≥8 for each species.
Evolutionary analysis
Arabidopsis, grape, poplar and soybean sequence
databases

The Arabidopsis (5 chromosomes - 33,198 genes - 119
Mb - ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR9_genome_release/TAIR9_sequences/), Grape (19 chromosomes - 21 189 genes - 302 Mb - http://www.

Mb - ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/Poplar/), Soybean
(20 chromosomes - 46 194 genes - 949 Mb - ftp://ftp.
jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/phytozome/v5.0/Gmax/) genome sequences were used for comparative genomics
study.
Synteny and duplication analysis

We used the two parameters recently defined by Salse et
al. [41-43] to increase the stringency and significance of
Blast sequence alignment by parsing Blast results and
rebuilding HSPs (High Scoring Pairs) or pairwise
sequence alignments to identify accurate paralogous and
orthologous relationships.
Distribution of KS distances (MYA scale) for paralogous
and ortholougous gene pairs

We performed the sequence divergence as well as speciation event datation analysis based on the rate of nonsynonymous (Ka) vs. synonymous (Ks) substitutions
calculated with PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) [63]. The average substitution rate (r)
of 6.5 × 10-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year
for grasses is classically used to calibrate the ages of the
considered gene [64,65]. The time (T) since gene

Page 22 of 24

insertion is then classically estimated using the formula
T = Ks/r.
