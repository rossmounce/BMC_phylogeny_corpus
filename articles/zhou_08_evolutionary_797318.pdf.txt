Abstract
Background: Histone methylation can dramatically affect chromatin structure and gene
expression and was considered irreversible until recent discoveries of two families of histone
demethylases, the KDM1 (previously LSD1) and JmjC domain-containing proteins. These two types
of proteins have different functional domains and distinct substrate specificities. Although more and
more KDM1 and JmjC proteins have been shown to have histone demethylase activity, our
knowledge about their evolution history is limited.
Results: We performed systematic phylogenetic analysis of these histone demethylase families and
uncovered different evolutionary patterns. The KDM1 genes have been maintained with a stable
low copy number in most organisms except for a few duplication events in flowering plants. In
contrast, multiple genes for JmjC proteins with distinct domain architectures were present before
the split of major eukaryotic groups, and experienced subsequent birth-and-death evolution. In
addition, distinct evolutionary patterns can also be observed between animal and plant histone
demethylases in both families. Furthermore, our results showed that some JmjC subfamilies contain
only animal genes with specific demethylase activities, but do not have plant members.
Conclusion: Our study improves the understanding about the evolutionary history of KDM1 and
JmjC genes and provides valuable insights into their functions. Based on the phylogenetic
relationship, we discussed possible histone demethylase activities for several plant JmjC proteins.
Finally, we proposed that the observed differences in evolutionary pattern imply functional
divergence between animal and plant histone demethylases.

Background
One important mechanism for eukaryotic gene regulation
is the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. The
basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists
of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of four his-

tone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histone proteins
can be modified on the N-terminal tail and the modifications can disrupt the interaction between nucleosomes to
prevent the packaging of chromatin into higher order
structures; also the modified tails can serve as binding

sites for chromatin modifiers, facilitating their functions
[1]. Histone modifications, such as methylation and
acetylation, have been well studied and many of the sites
for the modifications are known [1]. For example, methylation can take place on several lysine residues on histone H3 and H4 (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, etc.) and
each lysine residue can be mono-, di- or trimethylated.
Histone arginine residues like H3R2 and H4R3 can also
be mono- or dimethylated. According to the histone code
hypothesis, different histone modifications are linked to
distinct functional outcomes: H3K4 and H4K36 methylations are mainly associated with active genes while methylated H3K9 and H3K27 are markers for the repressed
chromatin in general [1,2].
As important mechanisms of gene regulation, histone
modifications themselves are under precise control [1]. It
is known that many histone modifications are dynamically regulated by enzymes which add or remove the chromatin modifications, with defects in either of these two
functions resulting in incorrect activation or repression
[1]. However, histone methylation was considered irreversible for a long time. Although histone methylation
was first reported in 1964 and the first histone methyltransferase was discovered in 2000 [3,4], it was not until
2004 that KDM1 [histone lysine (K) demethylase 1; previously known as LSD1 (Lysine specific demethylase)] was
identified as the first histone demethylase [5]. KDM1 contains a C-terminal amine oxidase (AOD) domain, which
is responsible for the demethylase activity through a flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent mechanism, and
an N-terminal SWIRM domain also found in other chromatin regulators [5]. Several studies showed that the
SWIRM domain is important for the stability and chromatin targeting of KDM1 [6-8]. Since the chemical mechanism of KDM1 mediated demethylation requires a
protonated nitrogen for the reaction to proceed, the substrate specificity of KDM1 is limited to mono- or dimethylated lysine residues [9]. Types of histone methylation
shown by biochemical studies to be demethylated by
KDM1 include H3K4me1/2, and in the presence of androgen receptor (AR), H3K9me1/2, representing a small subset of all the possible states of histone methylation [10].
Soon after the identification of KDM1, the Jumonji C
(JmjC) domain-containing proteins were discovered to be
another family of histone demethylases [11]. The JmjC
domain is the catalytic domain and these proteins belong
to the Cupin superfamily of Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate
dependent dioxygenases [12]. Unlike KDM1, the JmjC
domain-containing proteins that have been tested do not
require a protonated nitrogen and are able to reverse all
three states of lysine methylation [9]. Members in this
family have been shown to be able to remove the methyl
groups on H3K4, H3K9, H3K27 and H3K36 [13]. Further-

more, a protein in this family, the JMJD6, functions as a
histone arginine demethylase through a similar chemical
mechanism [14]. JmjC proteins usually contain additional domains, which are involved in the recognition of
methylation (e.g. PHD and Tudor), protein-protein interaction (e.g. F-box) and DNA binding (e.g. C2H2 zinc finger), suggesting a wide range of possible functional
interactions.
The number of studies of histone demethylases is increasing rapidly in recent years, with members in both families
shown to have important biological functions. KDM1 is
an essential gene in mouse [15] and important for viability and fertility in Drosophila [16]. The Arabidopsis
homologs of KDM1, including Flowering Locus D (FLD),
regulate the transition to reproductive development [1720]. Moreover, the JmjC domain-containing proteins are
involved in a broad range of processes. For example, the
newly identified H3K27 demethylases, UTX and JMJD3,
play important roles in regulating Hox gene expression
and the animal body development [21,22]. In addition,
JMJD3 was suggested to function in the neural stem cell
differentiation [23]. Other JmjC domain-containing proteins are involved in processes such as the X-linked neural
development (JARID1C) [24,25] and embryonic stem cell
self-renewal (JHDM2A and JHDM3C) [26].
While these studies greatly advanced our understanding
about the molecular and biological functions of histone
demethylases, they only covered a limited fraction of the
proteins in the two histone demethylase families. A large
number of KDM1 and JmjC-containing proteins remain
to be functionally characterized, especially in plants.
There are only very few studies on plant histone demethylases. In addition to FLD and its two relatives, only three
JmjC domain-containing proteins in Arabidopsis have
reported functional studies [27,28], although it is reasonable to expect that the plant histone demethylases have
important functions.
Phylogenetic analyses can provide useful information
about evolutionary relationship among related genes
from different organisms and clues about possible functions of genes closely related to those with known functions. Furthermore, the differences in evolutionary
pattern between gene families or species also suggest different evolutionary pressures and diverged functions.
Homologs of both types of histone demethylase have
been detected in major groups of eukaryotes [5,12]. However, to our knowledge, there is no detailed phylogenetic
analysis on the KDM1 proteins and only one report exists
for JmjC domain-containing proteins from fungi and animals [29]. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary history of these two histone demethylase families,
we performed systematic phylogenetic analyses in this

study including sequences from eukaryotes and bacteria.
We also discussed the functional implications of the evolutionary patterns we observed in the two families.

which is thought to have experienced a relatively recent
genome-wide duplication [30].
In fungi, KDM1 was found in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe but not the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [5]. To investigate the distribution of KDM1 in
fungi, we searched for KDM1 genes in completely
sequenced fungal genomes in the NCBI database. Our
phylogenetic analysis of the fungal KDM1 sequences (see
Additional file 2) indicates that one KDM1 gene was
present in the ancestor of Ascomycota and it was lost in
the common ancestor of the budding yeast and Candida
albicans after its divergence from Y. lipolytica. In fission
yeast, the two KDM1 genes were shown to have important
functions in regulating heterochromatin [31,32], which is
marked by H3K9 methylation. In contrast, the budding
yeast does not possess H3K9 methylation and employs a
different set of proteins to fulfill the function of fission
yeast KDM1 genes in heterochromatin regulation [33].
Furthermore, in the absence of KDM1 homolog, The
H3K4 demethylation in the budding yeast is performed
by a JmjC domain protein which will be discussed later.

Results and discussion
Distribution of AOD domain-containing proteins in major
lineages
Since the AOD domain is the catalytic domain in the
KDM1-type histone demethylases, we collected gene
sequences for AOD domain proteins from selected animal, plant and fungal species following the procedure
described in Methods. In total, 118 sequences were
retrieved from 12 organisms (Table 1, Additional file 1).
The AOD genes are present in Eukaryotes and Eubacteria,
but absent in Archaea. In this study, all AOD genes were
named based on their domain structure. The genes which
encode proteins with only the AOD domain were named
as AOD genes, whereas the genes coding for proteins with
both the SWIRM and the AOD domain were named as
KDM1. KDM1 genes only exist in Eukaryotes, and account
for only a small fraction of the AOD genes (e.g., 2/8 in
human and 4/14 in Arabidopsis). The KDM1 genes have
maintained a constant copy number of two in most animal species from the basal invertebrate sea anemone to
human, except for insects and several nematodes, which
contain one and three copies, respectively. A different
trend was observed in plants. The number of KDM1 genes
increased from 2 in green algae to 4 in Arabidopsis and rice,
with the highest number of 7 in poplar (P. trichocarpa),

Phylogenetic analyses of AOD genes
To investigate the evolutionary history of AOD genes, we
carried out phylogenetic analyses with sequences from
representative species using both NJ and ML methods,
yielding very similar results. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1)
indicates that all KDM1 genes form a single clade with 90/

genes prior to the divergence of animals and plants.
Besides the KDM1 clade, there are six major clades of AOD
genes. One of these clades contains both animal and plant
AOD genes, three are plant specific and one is animal specific. Based on these results, it could be estimated that, in
the most recent common ancestor of animals and plants,
there were at least one KDM1 gene and six additional
AOD genes.

Previous studies showed that the human KDM1A protein
has an insertion in the AOD domain [5]. The insertion
forms a coiled-coil protruding from the AOD domain and
is required for the binding between human KDM1 and
CoREST [6,8,34]. The alignment of AOD amino acid
sequences showed that this insertion is conserved among
animal KDM1A. The fungal KDM1 proteins also have an
insertion at the same position, but the sequences are not
similar to the animal insertions. Insertions of much
shorter length can also be detected in several plant KDM1
proteins. By contrast, no insertion was found in other
AOD proteins.

and animal species using the AOD domain region
Phylogenetic tree of AOD genes from representative plant
Phylogenetic tree of AOD genes from representative
plant and animal species using the AOD domain
region. Both NJ and ML methods were used to infer the
evolutionary history, and only the NJ tree is shown. NJ/ML
bootstrap values are presented for clades with support
greater than 50%. All KDM1 genes which code for proteins
with both SWIRM and AOD domains form a single clade,
which is highlighted in the box. The remaining AOD genes
form six well supported clades.

We used the COILS program to test whether the insertions
in different KDM1 proteins are able to form a coiled-coil
structure. Consistent with the crystal structure, the insertions in the human KDM1A protein is predicted to form a
coiled-coil structure with high support. The same results
were obtained for other animal KDM1A proteins, suggesting that the interaction between human KDM1A and
CoREST might be conserved in all animals. The lack of
insertion in animal KDM1B suggests a functional divergence between these two proteins. Interestingly, although
the fungal KDM1 proteins possess an insertion, no coiledcoil is predicted. Several studies showed that the two S.
pombe KDM1 proteins form a complex with two PHD
domain-containing proteins [35]. Hence, unlike their
counterparts in animal, the insertions in fungal KDM1s
might be involved in the interaction with these PHD proteins or have other functions. The absence of the insertion
in other KDM1 proteins suggests that this insertion is not
essential for the histone demethylase activity. Alternatively, the KDM1 proteins without the insertion might
have different activities.

83 bootstrap support. Within this clade, the animal
KDM1 genes form two highly supported (100/100)
groups, each contains one KDM1 gene from the two vertebrates, human and zebrafish. The only Drosophila KDM1
gene is in the same group as the human KDM1A gene.
Similarly, the plant KDM1 genes are also divided into two
separate groups, each with 100/100 support. The relationship between these animal and plant groups is unclear
since the topology lacks strong bootstrap support. However, our results still suggest an early origin of KDM1

Plant and animal KDM1 genes have different evolutionary
patterns
To further understand the evolution of KDM1 genes in
different lineages, KDM1 genes from more species were
included in the phylogenetic analysis. A representative
phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 2 has high bootstrap supports for the two animal clades and two plant clades of
KDM1 genes. In this tree, the plant group I and animal
KDM1A group cluster together to form a clade with 97/86
bootstrap support. The plant group II is placed outside
this clade, and the animal KDM1B group occupies the

ancestor of angiosperms. Due to the lack of complete
genomic sequence and EST data, we did not detect
sequences from gymnosperms. Hence it is unclear how
many KDM1 genes were present in the ancestor of seed
plants. However, the basalmost position of the green
algae KDM1A in this group suggests that all members in
group I were derived from a single copy of KDM1 in the
ancestor of green plants. In addition, lineage specific
duplication events were found in moss and poplar, as well
as in group II.

genes as2outgroupfor KDM1 genes with AOD1 and AOD2
Phylogenetic tree
Phylogenetic tree for KDM1 genes with AOD1 and
AOD2 genes as outgroup. The tree was constructed using
the AOD domain region. Plant and animal KDM1 genes each
form two separate clades; the plant specific group I and
group II, and the animal specific KDM1A and KDM1B. The
methods for tree construction and bootstrap values are
given as in Fig. 1.

basalmost position in the KDM1 clade. However, while
the position of plant group II is highly supported (95) in
the NJ tree, it has no support from the ML method. This
discrepancy between the bootstrap values from two methods might be due to the long branches of the animal
KDM1B genes. Therefore, according to these results, there
were at least two copies of KDM1 genes present in the
most recent common ancestor of animals and plants. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional sequences revealed
distinct evolutionary patterns of animal and plant KDM1
genes. The animal KDM1A and KDM1B genes both maintain only one copy in most animals. However, KDM1B
was not found in insects, implying that it was lost in the
ancestor of insects. By contrast, the plant group I contains
three subgroups and each subgroup consists of genes from
monocots and eudicots, indicating the presence of three
copies of group I KDM1 genes in the most recent common

Several genome-wide studies in fungi and Drosophila suggested that evolutionary patterns of gene families are correlated to their functions [36,37]. The genes with low
volatility in copy number during evolution are usually
associated with essential functions. In fact, the KDM1A
genes have been shown to be essential in mouse and S.
pombe and are involved in important biological processes
like meiotic progression and spermatogenesis [31,38].
Although the function of animal KDM1B genes is not
known, the similarity of their evolutionary pattern to that
of KDM1A also implies functional conservation and
importance. Consistent with this idea, the residues critical
for cofactor binding and catalytic activity are conserved in
animal KDM1B proteins, suggesting that they have histone demethylase activity. Moreover, the expression of
animal KDM1B gene is supported by considerable
amount of EST data, although less abundant than
KDM1A.
However, several potential substrate-binding residues are
substituted in animal KDM1B, suggesting possible
changes in substrate specificity of these proteins. Other
lines of evidence also support the functional divergence
between animal KDM1A and KDM1B genes. Besides the
SWIRM and the AOD domain, the animal KDM1B proteins also contain a CW-type zinc finger near the N-terminus. The function of this zinc finger is not well
characterized, but it is usually found in proteins which
also have other domains involved in DNA binding or protein-protein interaction [39]. Interestingly, this domain is
also found in a class of SET domain histone methyltransferases (HMTs), which have H3K36 methyltransferase
activity [40]. Therefore, the zinc finger possibly facilitates
the recognition of substrates other than methylated H3K4
and H3K9 by KDM1B. Furthermore, the tree in Fig. 2 also
shows that the animal KDM1B genes have branches
longer than those of KDM1A, indicating that the KDM1B
genes have evolved at higher rates. To test this idea, we
also conducted Ka/Ks analyses for several pairs of animal
genes. The results indicate that: (1) both KDM1A and
KDM1B genes were under purifying selection with Ka/Ks
ratio lower than 0.1; (2) Ka/Ks values for KDM1B genes
were significantly higher than those for KDM1A genes,
indicating that the KDM1B genes have evolved under less

The origin of SWIRM-AOD architecture
To investigate the origin of the KDM1 genes, we performed additional phylogenetic analysis with eukaryotic
AOD genes and the most similar AOD genes from Eubacteria. Our results (Fig. 3) showed that most major clades
have one eubacterial AOD gene at or near the basal position. The R. castenholzii AOD gene is placed at the basal
position outside all KDM1 genes with 91/55 bootstrap
support values. This topology suggests that all KDM1
genes have a single origin from an AOD gene in the ancestor of Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. However, it is still not
clear whether the plant AOD1 and AOD2 genes have the
same origin as KDM1 since the position of R. castenholzii
AOD gene was only weakly supported by the ML method.

w

In contrast, such duplication events were not observed for
group II genes, suggesting a difference in the function
between group I and group II KDM1 genes. Since there is
no reported study on AtKDM1D, it is unclear whether this
gene also participates in the regulation of flowering. The
expression data from the GENEVESTIGATOR database
and our previous microarray results [43,44] showed that
AtKDM1D is expressed at very low levels across all developmental stages. On the other hand, the sequence of
AtKDM1D gene is well conserved. Hence it is possible that
AtKDM1D has evolved a function in a specific group of
cells or for a specific environmental situation.

x

In plants, our results showed that the copy number of
group I KDM1 gene increased from one in the common
ancestor of green plants to three in the common ancestor
of flowering plants. The functional studies of AtKDM1A,
AtKDM1B and AtKDM1C revealed that all three genes regulate the transition to reproductive development [17,18].
It is possible that the expansion of plant group I might
have contributed to the evolutionary success of flowering
plants. The initiation of reproductive development is one
of the most important developmental events in plants and
is regulated by a complex regulatory network [41].
According to the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model [42], the duplicate group I KDM1
genes would have undergone sub-functionalization or
neo-functionalization, which might help to optimize the
regulatory network controlling flowering. In fact, functional studies showed that these three genes have partially
redundant functions in the repression of the expression of
FLC, a major inhibitor of flowering [17,18]. In addition,
AtKDM1B and AtKDM1C can also affect the expression of
FWA, a function independent of that of AtKDM1A.

stringent selective pressure (see Additional file 3). As all
these results point to a functional divergence between animal KDM1A and KDM1B, it will be worth investigating
the functions of KDM1B proteins in the future.

eukaryotic AOD genes
Figure 3
Phylogenetic tree showing the possible origin of selected
Phylogenetic tree showing the possible origin of
selected eukaryotic AOD genes. The tree includes
KDM1, AOD6, AOD7 and AOD8 genes and their most closely
related eubacterial homologs. The tree was constructed
using AOD domain region. The methods for tree construction and bootstrap values are given as in Fig. 1.

As the KDM1 proteins also contain a SWIRM domain in
addition to the AOD domain, how the SWIRM-AOD
domain architecture originated is still a question. According to previously proposed mechanisms for the evolution
of new gene structures [45], there might be two possible
origins for the first KDM1 gene: (1) an exon shuffling/retrotransposition event that brought these two domain
together; (2) de novo evolution of SWIRM domain coding
region at the 5' of a preexisting AOD gene. Previous studies have shown that, in spite of its short length, the
SWIRM domain is an evolutionarily conserved domain
that occurred in proteins with different domain compositions [46]. Therefore the second possibility is unlikely.
To explore the first possibility, we analyzed the intron/
exon structures of the KDM1 genes and the closely related
AOD genes (Fig. 4). Among the plant AOD1 and AOD2
genes, the number of introns ranged from 7 to 9 in the
AOD domain-coding region. With the exception of only a
few intron loss and gain events, the positions of all the
introns are highly conserved. In contrast, the plant KDM1
genes have many fewer introns. All plant KDM1D genes
have two introns in the SWIRM domain-coding region
and, except for the two PpKDM1D genes, have no intron
in the AOD domain. Interestingly, the other plant KDM1
genes have no intron in the SWIRM domain, but most of

Figure 4
Schematic diagram of intron-exon structure of KDM1, AOD1 and AOD2 genes
Schematic diagram of intron-exon structure of KDM1, AOD1 and AOD2 genes. Only the introns in SWIRM and
AOD domain coding region are shown. The exons are drawn to scale.
them possess an intron in the AOD domain at a different
position from all the other introns mentioned above, and
the AtKDM3B and OsKDM3B are intronless for the entire
gene. These intron/exon structures are also conserved in
poplar and grape (V. vinifera) (not shown) [30,47].
In comparison to the few introns observed in plant KDM1
genes, the animal KDM1 genes exhibit completely different patterns of intron positions. Most of the animal
KDM1 genes have one or two introns in the SWIRM
domain and around 10 introns in the AOD domain, with
the exception of insect KDM1 genes, which have only 2
introns in the AOD domain only. Furthermore, although
the positions of introns are conserved among animal
KDM1A and KDM1B genes respectively, they are different
from each other or that of the plant KDM1 genes.
The most parsimonious explanation for the observed
intron patterns is that the AOD domain of the ancestral
KDM1 gene in the most recent common ancestor of animals and plants was intronless, which supports the origin
of KDM1 gene through retrotransposition. After that, the
plant KDM1 genes have experienced limited or no intron
gains, whereas the animal KDM1 genes accumulated

many introns during their evolution. It is still not clear
what evolutionary pressure suppressed intron gain in
plant KDM1 genes. Nevertheless, these results again
clearly support our conclusion that the animal and plant
KDM1 genes experienced very different evolutionary history.
Evidence for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) during the
evolution of AOD genes
Another interesting result worth noting in Fig. 3 is that the
most closely related eubacterial homologs of the plant
AOD7 and AOD8 genes, respectively, are both from
cyanobacteria. Previous studies revealed that both
AtAOD7 and AtAOD8 proteins have chloroplast targeting
signal and are localized to chloroplast [48]. It has been
proposed that chloroplast originated from an eubacterium related to cyanobacteria through an endosymbiotic
event, after which many genes have been transferred from
the chloroplast to the nuclear genome [49]. Hence it is
highly possible that the plant AOD7 and AOD8 genes are
derived from the chloroplast. To examine this possibility,
we performed further phylogenetic analysis that included
the plant AOD7 and AOD8 genes and their eubacterial
homologs. Besides plants, the only eukaryotic species in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/294

which we were able to find homologs of AOD7 and AOD8
was the brown alga T. pseudonana, which was proposed to
have acquired a chloroplast through a secondary endosymbiotic event [50]. As shown in Fig. 5, the eukaryotic
AOD7 and AOD8 genes cluster with their respective
homologs from cyanobacteria with high bootstrap support (100/100). These results together suggest a cyanobacterium-like origin of the eukaryotic AOD7 and AOD8
genes.
AOD7 and AOD8 both are key enzymes important for the
biosynthesis of carotenoids in all photosynthetic organ-

isms, including plants, algae and cyanobacteria [51]. In
the carotenoid synthetic pathway, these two enzymes catalyze the two dehydrogenation reactions that convert phytonen to cis-lycopene, which is then converted to all-translycopene by an isomerase [48]. In many nonphotosynthetic organisms like fungi and eubacteria except cyanobacteria, these three steps are replaced by a single reaction
that is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme [48]. It is possible
that these two AOD genes were recruited to the carotenoid
pathway in the common ancestor of cyanobacteria after
its divergence from the other eubacteria, and then the
photosynthetic eukaryotes acquired these two genes from
cyanobacteria through HGT.

The plant-specific AOD6 group, which is closely related to
AOD7 and AOD8 groups, also shows a similar pattern. A
homolog of plant AOD6 genes can be found in the brown
alga T. pseudonana, but not in animals and fungi. The
AOD6 proteins are predicted to have a chloroplast-targeting signal, but the actual localization and function
remains unknown. In addition, the region of the AOD6
genes encoding the AOD domain is intronless. Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5) showed that eukaryotic AOD6
genes are most closely related to AOD genes from proteobacteria and bacteroidetes, suggesting that the eukaryotic
AOD6 genes also originated through HGT from a eubacterium. The results on AOD6, AOD7, and AOD8 phylogeny
together reveal an important role of HGT events in the
evolution of AOD genes.

Figure possible of eukaryotic AOD6, AOD7 and species,
and plants tree horizontal gene transfer between bacteria
showing5
genes and their homologs from selected bacterial AOD8
Phylogenetic
Phylogenetic tree of eukaryotic AOD6, AOD7 and
AOD8 genes and their homologs from selected bacterial species, showing possible horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and plants. The tree was
constructed using AOD domain region. The methods for
tree construction and bootstrap values are given as in Fig. 1.

JmjC domain-containing proteins
Klose et al. have studied the evolutionary relationship
between animal and fungal JmjC domain-containing proteins and they identified seven subfamilies based on both
phylogenetic analysis of JmjC domain and domain architecture information [29]. JmjC proteins in six of the seven
subfamilies have multiple domains and each family has a
distinct domain structure. However, the evolutionary history of plant JmjC proteins is not clear. It has already been
reported that two Arabidopsis JmjC proteins have an unusual domain architecture, which is not found in animals
and fungi. Hence it will be of interest to elucidate the phylogeny of plant JmjC proteins, and compare between the
evolutionary patterns of plant and animal JmjC proteins.
To investigate the evolutionary history of plant JmjC
domain histone demethylase genes, we retrieved
sequences for JmjC domain-containing proteins from various plants and selected animals (Table 1, Additional file
1). We also used the sequences of eukaryotic JmjC
domains as queries to search for JmjC domain-containing
proteins in prokaryotes. While proteins with limited similarity were found in Eubacteria, no homolog was detected
in Archaea. Thus, our results indicate that neither AOD
nor JmjC protein is present in Archaea. It is known that
some archaea already possess the pseudonucleosomal

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:294

tetrameric structures [52]. However, the absence of histone demethylase in Archaea is not surprising since
archaeal histone proteins do not have N-terminal tails
[52]. It is possible that, upon the acquisition of histone
tails in early eukaryotes, AOD and JmjC proteins were
recruited to serve as chromatin modifying enzymes.
The JmjC domains in most eubacterial JmjC proteins have
low support from the SMART analysis and they are annotated as Cupin domain by Pfam with high e-value. Similarly, the JmjC domains in human MINA53, NO66,
Drosophila CG2982 proteins retrieved in this study are also
annotated as Cupin with strong support. The domain
architecture analysis of the collected proteins shows that
all the eubacterial proteins have only the JmjC domain. In
contrast, most eukaryotic proteins contain other
domain(s) besides the JmjC domain. Some domain architectures were observed only in plant members and others
only in animals and/or fungi members. From the amino
acid sequence alignment, the proteins with the same
domain architecture have more similar JmjC domains and
regions flanking the JmjC domains.
The birth-and-death evolution of genes encoding JmjC
domain proteins
According to the NJ tree shown in Fig. 6, the JmjC family
can be divided into 12 monophyletic subfamilies. These
12 subfamilies represent 11 different domain architectures, as two subfamilies contain only the JmjC domain.
Previously, these two subfamilies were in a monophyletic
group with low support and was defined as a single subfamily [29], but our study supports two separate subfamilies. On the other hand, the other six subfamilies
defined in the previous study [29] were confirmed by our
result. Most of the 12 subfamilies are designated after the
name of their animal members according to their chromatin modifying enzyme activities [53]. Among these subfamilies, the KDM2, KDM4 and KDM6 subfamilies are
animal specific, while KDM3, KDM5 and JMJD6 have
members from both plants and animals. Those subfamilies without a known histone demethylase function
are named as PKDM (Putative-KDM). Among these, the
PKDM7, PKDM8 and PKDM9 subfamilies are composed
of only plant genes and PKDM10 is animal specific; the
remaining two subfamilies, PKDM11 and PKDM12, contain both plant and animal genes. According to the tree
topology, it could be estimated that there were at least
nine JmjC genes in the most recent common ancestor of
plants and animals. After the divergence of animals and
plants, some copies were lost in plants, others in animals.
When the human MINA53, NO66, Drosophila CG2982
genes and their eubacterial homologs encoding Cupin
proteins were included in the analysis, they form a separate clade that is sister to the PKDM12 subfamily. There-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/294

fore it is possible that all JmjC genes originated from the
ancestor of these Cupin genes.
Besides the above mentioned loss of specific subfamilies
in plant or animal JmjC genes, three different patterns of
birth-and-death evolution were also observed within the
subfamilies. In the PKDM9 and PKDM11 subfamilies, a
single copy has been stably maintained in both animals
and plants, except for a recent duplication of PKDM9 in
poplar. In other subfamilies, JmjC genes experienced
duplication in one of the animal and plant lineages, but
were stable or lost in the other lineage. For example, in the
JMJD6 subfamily, while one copy has been maintained in
each animal, two gene duplication events can be detected
in plants, one before the divergence of land plants and
another in moss. In contrast, the KDM5 subfamily has
four members in humans, resulting from duplication
events after the divergence of vertebrate animals from
insects. This pattern is also found in the plant (e.g.
PKDM3) or animal (e.g. KDM6) specific subfamilies. A
third pattern is that JmjC genes were duplicated in both
animals and plants, such as the KDM3 subfamily. As
shown in Fig. 7A, five well supported clades all include
members from Arabidopsis and poplar, suggesting the
presence of five KDM3 genes in the most recent ancestor
of Arabidopsis and poplar. These five clades were all
derived from possibly one copy in the ancestor of plants
and animals through gene duplication. In addition, lineage specific gene duplication events can be observed in
plants. In animals, duplication events can also be inferred
from the clade with 100/100 supports that is composed of
one Drosophila KDM3 and four human KDM3 genes.
Potential histone demethylase activities of plant JmjC
proteins
Among the twelve subfamilies identified in this study, six
of them have at least one member with known histone
demethylase activities [13]. However, as all functional
studies so far are performed in animals and fungi, no
plant JmjC protein in these six subfamilies has been
reported to have histone demethylase activity. In the
absence of biochemical studies, our phylogenetic results
can be valuable clues about possible functions of plant
JmjC proteins. Here, we propose potential histone
demethylase activities for the plant JmjC proteins based
on the evolutionary relationships from this study, the
conservation of enzymatic active sites and domain architectures.

As described above, three subfamilies have both members
with known biochemical activities and members from
plants. Two human proteins in KDM3 subfamily, human
KDM3A and KDM3B, have been shown to have
H3K9me1/2 demethylase activity [54]. The plant KDM3
proteins have the same domain architecture as the animal

Phylogenetic trees of JmjC subfamilies
Phylogenetic trees of JmjC subfamilies. (A) A phylogenetic tree of JmjC genes in KDM4, KDM5, PKDM7, PKDM8 and
KDM9 subfamilies. The tree was constructed using JmjN and JmjC domain regions as well as another region which is conserved
among these five subfamilies. (B) A phylogenetic tree of KDM3 subfamily. The tree was constructed based on RING domain,
JmjC domain and other conserved regions inside this subfamily. Proteins with mutated cofactor binding sites are indicated by

members, with a zinc finger domain in addition to the
JmjC domain. The predicted cofactor binding sites are
also conserved in most plant KDM3 proteins, suggesting
possible H3K9 demethylase function. Consistent with
this idea, a recent study revealed an increased level of
H3K9 methylation at the BNS locus in the Arabidopsis
kdm3c mutant [28]. However, proteins in the two clades
including Arabidopsis KDM3A and KDM3B have variant
residues at the co-factor binding sites. Hence it is possible
that they have evolved novel functions or become pseudogenes. To investigate these two possibilities, we examined
the expression data of Arabidopsis KDM3 genes from our
previous microarray analysis [44] and the GENEVESTIGATOR database [43]. AtKDM3A has the highest expression
level among these genes at all the developmental stages,
and AtKDM3B is also expressed, suggesting they are functional.
Similar phenomenon can be observed in the PKDM7 subfamily. All proteins in this subfamily are from plant and
they contain a JmjN domain, a C5H2-zinc finger domain

and C-terminal FYRN and FYRC domains. The cofactor
binding sites are conserved in all members but the Arabidopsis and poplar PKDM7A proteins, which have evolved
much faster than the other members. Nevertheless, the
expression data shows that AtPKDM7A is expressed at a
level comparable to AtPKDM7B and AtPKDM7D [43,44].
Although the AtPKDM7C protein has intact cofactor binding sites, it has no detectable expression. The phylogeny in
Fig. 7B shows that the PKDM7 subfamily forms a clade
with 99/97 bootstrap supports and is most closely related
to the KDM5 subfamily. Several animal KDM5 proteins
have been shown to have H3K4me2/3 demethylase activities [24,55-57]. Therefore, although the plant KDM5 and
PKDM7 proteins have distinct domain architecture, they
might have H3K4 demethylase activities.
Recently, the human JMJD6 protein was shown to have
histone arginine demethylase activity [14]. Although most
of the cofactor binding sites are conserved in plant JMJD6
proteins, the first KG binding site has been substituted by
Ser and Ala in plant JMJD6A and JMJD6B proteins, respec-

tively. It is unclear whether these substitutions will compromise the histone arginine demethylase activity of plant
JMJD6 proteins. We noticed that AtJMJD6A and AtJMJD6B
are expressed at a high level at specific developmental
stages [43,44], suggesting that these proteins are functional.
In summary, we have used our phylogenetic results to propose histone demethylase activities for plant JmjC proteins in four subfamilies. The other plant JmjC proteins
are either in the plant specific subfamilies PKDM8 and
PKDM9 or in the subfamilies PKDM11 and PKDM12
which do not have an animal member with known biochemical activities. Nevertheless, some of these plant
JmjC proteins have already been implicated in chromatin
modification. For example, an elevated histone H4
acetylation level is observed at the FLC locus in the Arabidopsis pkdm9a mutant, which is phenotypically similar to
the kdm1a mutant [27]. Moreover, it is still not clear
which proteins are responsible for the H3K9me3, H3K27
and H3K36 demethylation in plants, since the KDM2,
KDM4 and KDM6 subfamilies do not have a plant member. One possibility is that these demethylase activities in
plants are carried out by some of the other JmjC proteins
without a known function.
Functional implications of differences in evolutionary
patterns
Our phylogenetic analyses of these two histone demethylase families revealed a significant difference in evolutionary pattern between animal and plant proteins in both
families. In the AOD family, the plant group I KDM1
genes were duplicated several times before the diversification of flowering plants and further in specific lineages,
whereas the animal KDM1 genes have been maintained
with a constant copy number in most species. The animal
and plant JmjC domain-containing proteins show similar
patterns of evolution in some subfamilies but not in the
others. Furthermore, certain types of histone demethylation might be conducted by plant JmjC proteins in subfamilies different from the animal JmjC proteins. These
results indicate a divergence in the regulation of histone
methylation between animals and plants, consistent with
the proposed divergent roles of histone methylation in
different organisms [58]. In animals, both H3K9me2 and
H3K9me3 are enriched in heterochromatin. However, in
Arabidopsis, while the H3K9me2 is considered as a hallmark of heterochromatin, H3K9me3 is mainly found in
euchromatin [58]. In animals, H3K9me3 demethylation
is catalyzed by members of the KDM4 subfamily [59-62],
which lacks plant members, suggesting that H3K9me3
demethylation in plants is catalyzed by proteins from
another subfamily. Furthermore, previous phylogenetic
analysis also revealed a similar evolutionary pattern in the
HDAC families; one of the three major classes of SIR2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/294

family of HDACs has members from animal but not
plant, whereas the HD2 family is plant specific [63]. Thus,
the functional and regulatory diversification might be a
common feature of chromatin modification genes.
In addition, our study also showed distinct evolutionary
patterns between the AOD and the JmjC families. Whereas
the KDM1 genes only experienced limited duplication
events and maintained relatively constant domain architecture in their history, the JmjC gene have evolved several
types of domain architectures before the divergence of
major eukaryotic groups and underwent further duplication subsequently. As suggested by genome-wide studies
in Drosophila and fungi, such divergence in evolutionary
patterns may indicate differences in functional essentiality
[36,37]. The KDM1 histone demethylases are reported to
have a variety of functions. In animal, KDM1 is required
for the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by
nuclear hormone receptors [10,64]. It also plays important roles in cell differentiation, cell cycle control and
spermatogenesis [38]. In addition, most of these functions are also shared by JmjC proteins. For example, members of the KDM3 and KDM4 subfamilies, which possess
H3K9 demethylase activities, are also required for the steroid hormone induced gene expression [26,54,64] and
KDM3A is crucial for spermatogenesis [65]. In addition,
the KDM5A, an H3K4me2/me3 demethylase, has overlapping roles with KDM1 in the regulation of cell differentiation [55]. It is also possible that KDM1 has some distinct
function from those of JmjC proteins. In fact, the work by
Lan et al. showed that KDM1 is retained on the unmethylated H3K4 after its action and suggested a role of KDM1
in the prevention of H3K4 methylation [66].
Another explanation for the observed evolutionary patterns is that they reflect the difference in evolutionary
potential of these two families of histone demethylase.
Consistent with this idea, several lines of evidence support
a greater functional potential of JmjC proteins than
KDM1. First, the JmjC proteins have broader substrate
specificity than KDM1 proteins. The requirement of a protonated nitrogen in KDM1-mediated demethylation limits the substrate specificity of KDM1 to mono- and
dimethylated lysine residues. By contrast, JmjC proteins
are able to demethylate all the three states of lysine methylation. In addition, KDM1 proteins are only known to
catalyze the demethylation on H3K4 and H3K9, whereas
the substrates for JmjC proteins include H3K4, H3K9,
H3K27, H3K36 and even H3R2. Studies on protein structures suggest that the interactions between KDM1 and the
substrate are intricate and specific, leading to the exquisite
substrate specificity of KDM1. Second, the JmjC domain is
much smaller than the AOD domain in KDM1. The JmjC
domain in most JmjC proteins are less than 200 amino
acids, but the length of the AOD domain is usually more

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:294

than 400 amino acids. Smaller domain might be combined with the other domains more easily, providing
JmjC proteins greater evolutionary adaptability. This is
supported by a recent study, which identified the protein
domains with relatively high tendency to combine with
different domains in eukaryotes [67]. In their list of highly
versatile domains, most have 250 or fewer amino acids
residues. Hence the short length of JmjC domain may
allow JmjC proteins to evolve new functions quickly by
combining with new domains, which can promote protein-protein interaction, DNA binding or recognition of
chromatin modification.
Apparently convergent evolution of histone demethylases
The fact that the KDM1 and JmjC genes belong to two phylogenetically distinct gene families indicates that, during
evolution, these two gene families were recruited to perform the histone demethylation activity independently,
providing an example of convergent evolution. In fact,
this phenomenon is prevalent among histone modifying
enzymes. For instance, the enzymes that catalyze histone
methylation belong to two different families, the widespread SET-domain family and the DOT1-related protein
family [2]. Similarly, there are three distinct families of
HDACs and four different families of HATs [63]. In addition, it is also common that families responsible for the
same type of histone modification show distinct evolutionary patterns. While some families are widespread in
eukaryotes (e.g. SET family HKMTs and SIR2 family
HDACs), others are only present in specific lineages of
eukaryotes (e.g. DOT1-related HKMTs in animals and
fungi and HD2 family HDACs in plants) [2,63]. The
recruitment of more than one gene families to fulfill the
same type of biochemical activities might have allowed
these families to evolve specific roles under different circumstances (e.g. cell type, developmental stage, environmental cues) or toward different substrates. The multiple
origins of histone modification enzymes have likely contributed to the complexity of epigenetic regulation.

Conclusion
In this paper, we present detailed phylogenetic analyses of
the KDM1 and JmjC families, whose members include the
recently identified histone demethylases. Our results
revealed a possible single origin of all KDM1 histone
demethylase genes through the acquisition of the region
encoding the SWIRM domain by an AOD gene before the
split of major eukaryotic lineages. The KDM1 genes are
conserved in both copy number and domain structure
during evolution, although a few duplication events were
observed in plants. We also identified the contribution of
HGT events to the evolution of AOD genes. On the other
hand, our analyses JmjC genes showed this family clearly
experienced birth-and-death evolution and the subfamilies displayed lineage-specific duplication patterns.

According to the evolutionary relationship revealed by
our study, we proposed histone demethylase activities for
several plant JmjC domain-containing proteins. Furthermore, we found distinct evolutionary patterns of histone
demethylases in different lineages and between the KDM1
and JmjC families. These results may imply functional
divergence of certain types of histone methylation in different organisms and different classes of function associated with KDM1 and JmjC domain-containing histone
demethylases. In summary, our study improves the understanding about the evolution and functions of histone
demethylases and provides valuable information for
future studies.

Methods
Data retrieval
The amino acid sequences of the AOD domain in reported
KDM1 histone demethylases were retrieved from
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
They were used as queries to search against NCBI, TAIR,
TIGR and JGI databases for all possible AOD domain-containing proteins in selected eukaryotic organisms by using
TBLASTN with e-value less than e-5 as cut-off. All the new
results were used as queries to carry out a second round of
BLAST search, until no new sequence was found. The collected protein sequences were then analyzed by SMART
and Pfam for domain architecture. The proteins which
lack the AOD domain or have an AOD domain with evalue greater than e-10 based on both SMART [68] and
Pfam [69] results were excluded from the further analyses.
The prokaryotic sequences were retrieved from NCBI database through BLASTP by using eukaryotic AOD domaincontaining proteins as queries and e-5 as cut-off. The same
procedure was followed for the retrieval of JmjC domaincontaining proteins. Common names for the following
species are shown in the figures: Arabidopsis, Arabidopsis
thaliana; Poplar, Populus trichocarpa; Rice, Oryza sativa;
Moss, Physcomitrella patens; Human, Homo sapiens; Cow,
Bos taurus; Mouse, Mus musculus; Zebrafish, Danio rerio;
Fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster; Mosquito, Anopheles gambiae; Honey bee, Apis mellifera; Beetle, Tribolium castaneum;
Sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis; Sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus; and Sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis.
Sequence alignment
A preliminary multiple sequences alignment (MSA) was
generated using MUSCLE 3.6 [70] with the default settings
and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed using
MEGA 4.0 [71] based on the MSA. According to the tree
topology, the sequences were divided into several subgroups. Each subgroup of sequences was aligned by MUSCLE 3.6 separately followed by manual adjustment using
GeneDoc 2.6.0.3 [72]. These alignments were then combined using the profile alignment function of ClustalX

1.83 [73]. The codeml program from the PAML 4.1 package is used for the Ka/Ks analyses [74].
Phylogenetic analysis
Both NJ and Maximum likelihood (ML) methods were
used to perform the phylogenetic analyses. NJ trees were
constructed using MEGA 4.0 with "pairwise deletion"
option and "Poisson correction" model. Bootstrap test of
1000 replicates was carried out to evaluate the reliability
of internal branches. ML trees were generated using
PHYML 2.4.4 [75] with 100 nonparametric bootstrap replicates. ProtTest 1.4 [76] was used to select the model and
parameters for the ML analysis. In this study, WAG amino
acid substitution model was used and both proportion of
invariable sites and gamma distribution parameter were
estimated from the data. In this study, we presented only
the NJ trees with bootstrap values from both NJ and ML
analyses.
