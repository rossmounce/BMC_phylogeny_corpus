Abstract
Background: Oat is an important crop in North America and northern Europe. In Scandinavia,
yields are limited by the fact that oat cannot be used as a winter crop. In order to develop such a
crop, more knowledge about mechanisms of cold tolerance in oat is required.
Results: From an oat cDNA library 9792 single-pass EST sequences were obtained. The library
was prepared from pooled RNA samples isolated from leaves of four-week old Avena sativa (oat)
plants incubated at +4°C for 4, 8, 16 and 32 hours. Exclusion of sequences shorter than 100 bp
resulted in 8508 high-quality ESTs with a mean length of 710.7 bp. Clustering and assembly
identified a set of 2800 different transcripts denoted the Avena sativa cold induced UniGene set
(AsCIUniGene set). Taking advantage of various tools and databases, putative functions were
assigned to 1620 (58%) of these genes. Of the remaining 1180 unclassified sequences, 427 appeared
to be oat-specific since they lacked any significant sequence similarity (Blast E values > 10-10) to any
sequence available in the public databases. Of the 2800 UniGene sequences, 398 displayed
significant homology (BlastX E values ≤ 10-10) to genes previously reported to be involved in cold
stress related processes. 107 novel oat transcription factors were also identified, out of which 51
were similar to genes previously shown to be cold induced. The CBF transcription factors have a
major role in regulating cold acclimation. Four oat CBF sequences were found, belonging to the
monocot cluster of DREB family ERF/AP2 domain proteins. Finally in the total EST sequence data
(5.3 Mbp) approximately 400 potential SSRs were found, a frequency similar to what has previously
been identified in Arabidopsis ESTs.
Conclusion: The AsCIUniGene set will now be used to fabricate an oat biochip, to perform
various expression studies with different oat cultivars incubated at varying temperatures, to
generate molecular markers and provide tools for various genetic transformation experiments in
oat. This will lead to a better understanding of the cellular biology of this important crop and will
open up new ways to improve its agronomical properties.

Background
Avena sativa (oat) belongs to the Poaceae family. Other
cereals in this family are wheat, barley and rye [1]. Wild
oats are diploid, but all cultivated oats are hexaploid with
an estimated 1C genome size of 13.23 pg, corresponding
to about 13000 Mbp [2]. The commercial value of oat is
derived both from its high-energy grain and from superior
break-crop benefits. Oat plantations also have a comparatively low input demand of insecticides, fungicides and
fertiliser due to high disease tolerance and low nourishment requirements of this crop [3]. Today oat is mainly
used as animal feed, but it is one of the most promising
future cereals in the functional food area. It has unique
and well-documented cholesterol lowering effects, as a
result of its soluble dietary fibres and high β-glucan content [4-6]. An oat diet greatly improves the well feeling of
persons with celiac disease and also reduces the risk of
diet-related diseases [7-9]. Oat is rich in natural phenolic
antioxidants [10-14], which prevent the development of
cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. In Sweden
most of the harvested oat is used for animal feed. Only
about 35000 tons per year are used for human consumption. However, due to its many health-enhancing properties, the market for oat and processed oat products like oat
milk for human consumption is rapidly growing.
Many European countries grow winter oat, i.e. oat that is
sown in the autumn and survives the winter in the field.
Winter oat therefore has a longer growth season compared
to summer varieties, allowing an earlier harvest and giving
a higher yield. However, inherently oat is not as winter
hardy as rye, wheat and barley. Due to the harsh climate
in the Scandinavian countries, winter oat is therefore not
grown there. Based on the English experience with winter
oat, a Swedish winter oat would probably increase the
yield of the harvest by at least 30% (John Valentine, IGER,
UK, personal communication). In addition, since oat is
the most important rotation crop for wheat and oil crops,
an early harvest of winter oat would mean an earlier sowing also of the rotation crops, resulting in increased yields
also for these crops. To develop a winter oat suitable for
the Scandinavian climate is therefore of high priority
(Anders Jonsson, The SwedishFarmers Supply and Crop
Marketing Co-operative, personal communication). Since
cold hardiness is a quantitative trait controlled by several
genes [15], the traditional plant breeding programs have
so far been of limited success in improving the cold hardiness for any of the important crop species [16] and the
Swedish oat breeders have more or less given up their
efforts to produce a Swedish winter oat (Rickard Jonsson,
Svalöf Weibull AB, personal communication).
A cost efficient and rapid way to obtain new data from an
organism with a large, complex and unknown genome is
through partial sequencing of randomly selected cDNA

clones. The resulting collection of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) reflects the level and complexity of gene expression
in the sampled tissue and will also give an insight into
gene structure of the chosen organism. This not only leads
to the identification of a number of genes from the new
organism that have known or putative functions but also
to the discovery of completely novel, previously unknown
putative proteins.
In this work, starting from 9792 EST sequences, we identified 2800 putative oat genes, several of which showed
similarities to genes previously defined as cold stress
related or involved in transcriptional regulation, signal
transduction or metabolism. Several sequences that could
represent new, unknown and unique oat genes were also
identified. This data will now be used to study cold-acclimation in oat, to identify key genes in regulating winter
survival, to produce molecular markers to facilitate the
breeding for winter hardiness and to construct transgenic
oat with increased freezing tolerance. These experiments
will increase our general knowledge about the physiology
of cold acclimation in plants in general and in oat in particular and in the long term allow the development of a
Scandinavian winter oat.

Cold-acclimation
120 individual, four-week old, greenhouse-grown plants
of the winter oat varieties Gerald, 83-48 CH and the
spring oat varieties Matilda and Birgitta were incubated in
the dark at +4°C (± 0.5°C) for 12 and 24 h and thereafter
moved to -15°C for 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 h. Another 120 individual plants were transferred directly at -15°C for 1, 2 4,
8 or 16 h. After the incubation period the plants were
transferred back to the greenhouse and allowed to recover
for one week. Visible freezing damage was then scored on
a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means no visible damage and
5 means a dead plant (Figure 1A–D). The damage was less
severe on the plants that were incubated at +4°C prior to
freezing than on plants directly transferred to -15°C
(Table 1). Thus, oat plants, as expected, are able to coldacclimatise to some extent. A clear difference could be
seen between summer and winter varieties, however, the
latter being more cold adaptable and more winter hardy
both before and after acclimation (Table 1).

To confirm cold acclimation on the molecular level a
known marker for cold acclimation was investigated.
Total RNA was isolated from 3 week-old plants of the winter variety Gerald after incubation at +4°C for 4, 16, 32
and 64 hours. An oat sequence, corresponding to the
wheat COR410 gene, known to be cold inducible in
wheat [17], was amplified by PCR from genomic oat
DNA. A northern analysis using RNA isolated from cold

induced plants and oat COR410 as a probe, showed that
the COR410 gene expression could be detected after 4 h
and then remained strongly expressed even after 64 h of
cold incubation (Figure 1E).
EST sequencing and UniGene set construction
Since we aimed for both early and late cold inducible
genes in our EST analysis, a cDNA library was constructed
from pooled RNA samples isolated from oat plants at different stages of cold acclimation. After plating the library,
bacterial colonies were randomly picked and 9792 singlepass sequence reactions performed on cDNAs present in
plasmids from these clones. This resulted in 8508 highquality ESTs of 100 bp or longer, with an average
sequence length of 710 bp. The 8508 ESTs were assembled
into 1100 contigs and 2616 singletons, giving 3716 candidate genes. All ESTs that contained rRNA, mitochondrial or chloroplast sequences were excluded from further
analysis. Finally, the number of redundant sequences in
the candidate gene set was eliminated. This was done by a
comparative BlastX analysis of the candidate gene set to

the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (see
"Materials and Methods"). This reduced the candidate
gene set to 2800 transcripts with an average sequence
length of 800 bp (Figure 2). These final genes were
denoted as the AsCIUniGene (Avena sativa cold induced
UniGene) set.
Annotation and functional classification
The annotation of the AsCIUniGene set is based on
homology. Each gene in the AsCIUniGene set inherited
the annotation from the best match found after a BlastX
search against nr protein database at NCBI. An expectation value (E value) threshold of 10-10 was used. All
sequences, in total 427, that had E values above this
threshold were annotated as unknown.

The AsCIUniGene set was functionally classified by identifying every individual sequence in the set by the protein
in the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences
(MIPS) Arabidopsis database (MATDB) that gave the highest BlastX score. Since every gene in MATDB is assigned to

at least one of the 28 different classes defined by the MIPS
functional classification system, this proved to be a fruitful way to assign putative functions for sequences in the
AsCIUniGene set. One drawback with the MIPS classification system is that it is somewhat crude since many of the
functional classes were assigned automatically. Therefore,
in addition to the automated process, we manually
inspected the functional classification assignments for all
the proteins and re-assigned them if necessary. In this way
all of the 2373 oat sequences, out of which approximately
400 were manually assigned, were finally classified into
the previously mentioned MIPS classes. The remaining
427 sequences (with E values > 10-10 in the BLASTX search
versus nr) could not be assigned either automatically or
manually and where therefore classified as unknown proteins (Figure 3).
The most abundant ESTs
To analyze the most abundant ESTs from the cold induced
cDNA library we grouped the sequences by means of the
KOG (Clusters of Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of Proteins) database. This database currently includes 7 eukaryotic genomes, including Arabidopsis. This gave a functional
annotation of sequences based on orthologous proteins
[18]. In addition we used complementary databases to
annotate our sequences like FOGs (Fuzzy Orthologous
Group), which contains proteins with promiscuous
domains that has not been assigned a KOG identity due to
unclear orthologous relationships, TWOGs, which con-

tains provisional clusters of proteins that are represented
in two genomes and LSEs, which contains proteins that
are lineage-specific expansions of paralogs present in the
KOG database. The classification was based on best
homology match of BlastX searches against Arabidopsis
protein sequences where an expectation value (E value)
threshold of 10-10 was used. Proteins annotated in this
way were termed "KOG-TWOG-LSE". Since not all Arabidopsis proteins are represented in the KOG database, not
all ESTs could be annotated with a KOG-TWOG-LSE. Oat
ESTs that had a homology match in Arabidopsis but not a
KOG-TWOG-LSE annotation, inherited the annotation
from MIPS annotation in MATDB. In addition, several of
the sequences did not have an Arabidopsis homolog match
with an E value above the threshold. These sequences
were annotated with the best homolog match from a
BlastX search against the nr protein database at NCBI.
Again, an E value threshold of 10-10 was used.
As a comparison, 2189 EST sequences from a noninduced oat leaf library [19] were analysed in the same
way. As can be deduced from Table 2, the non-induced
and the induced leaf libraries are quite different. In both
libraries, chlorophyll a/b binding, ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small chain and ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (InterPro
accession numbers IPR001344 and IPR000894) were the
most expressed gene families, although in a different
order (Table 2). The ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxyPage 5 of 17

Summary

lase/oxygenase sequence was the most common in the
non-induced library, perhaps reflecting the higher photosynthetic activity in these plants. Interestingly, several
cold related proteins were among the most abundant ESTs
in the cold-acclimated library but were not represented
among the most abundant ESTs from oat grown under
optimal conditions. The cold-induced COR410
(Wcor410) is a dehydrin [17]. Dehydrins are expressed
during water-deficit and cold stress. The cold-responsive
LEA/RAB-related COR protein (Wrab17) belongs to
group-3 of LEA-proteins and has previously been established as induced by cold [20]. Other interesting proteins
in this context are the auqaporin PIP and hydroxyprolinerich glycoproteins. The aquaporins are membrane proteins that facilitate water transport across biological membranes. In Arabidopsis there are 13 members of aquaporins
that belong to the plasma membrane intrinsic protein
(PIP) subgroup. Recently, a study has shown that the PIP
proteins are either up- or down-regulated in response to
various abiotic stresses [21]. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins have a strong homology to OSR40 proteins in
Oryza sativa, which have previously been shown to be upregulated by salt stress [22]. None of these genes were
present in the non-induced library, indicating the great
enrichment for cold stress related genes in the induced
library. Since only genes that were annotated as cold
induced, cold acclimated or as cold regulated were
included, other stress related genes that indirectly also are
involved in cold stress responses are most likely also
enriched in this collection.

"Cellular Communication/Signal Transduction Mechanism", "Metabolism" and "Transcription" were considered to be of great potential interest for cold acclimation.
Together these categories were represented by 931 entries
in the AsCIUniGene set, corresponding to more than 30%
of all genes (Table 3). To increase the resolution of this
analysis and to improve the identification of putative
cold-regulated genes we built a separate database with
proteins previously reported in the literature to be directly
involved in cold stress-related processes [23-26]. This
"cold stress database" (CSDB) presently comprises 545
entries. In a BlastX search with the AsCIUniGene set
against CSDB we identified 398 sequences in the
AsCIUniGene set that showed significant homology (E ≤
10-10) to genes in the CSDB (Table 3). Thus, 14.2% of all
the genes in the AsCIUniGene set seem to be cold stress
related. Looking just at the two classes that we consider as
most important for the cold acclimation process (Cell rescue, defence and virulence; Cellular communication and
signal transduction) almost 40% of all sequences were
homologous to potential cold stress related proteins. In
the "Metabolism" and "Cellular Transport and Transport
Mechanisms" classes, cold stress related genes were also
overrepresented (approx. 25%).
To analyze whether this high proportion of cold regulated
genes in relation to the total number of genes in the
AsCIUniGene set was similar to other EST collections
derived from cold acclimated plants, we downloaded and
analysed EST datasets from cold acclimated wheat and
barley. The datasets were clustered and assembled with
the TGI clustering tool (see Material and Methods). This
resulted in a TaCIUniGene set of 2894 genes and a
HvCIUniGene set of 3932 genes. In addition, as a comparPage 6 of 17

ison the same oat ESTs collection derived from leaves of
plants grown under optimal conditions (Table 2) was
clustered and assembled into a AsNIUniGene set of 1445
sequences. These three UniGene sets were then searched
against the CSDB. This showed that the proportions of
cold stress related genes were 9.6% in the TaCI candidate
gene set and 11.1% in the HvCI, but only 5.1% in the
AsNI UniGene set (Table 4). Thus the AsCI UniGene set is
quite different from previous oat EST collections and also
the EST collection that contains the highest proportion of
cold induced genes of all cereals.
Phylogenetic analysis of AP2 containing proteins
Among the 190 sequences in the transcription class (Table
3), 107 were found to be homologous to transcription factors. Remarkably, 51 of these 107 sequences were homologous to genes in the CSDB, representing almost 48% of
all transcription factors found in the AsCIUniGene set. To
investigate this a bit more, the transcription factors were
further classified into 14 different transcription factor
families (Table 5). Dominating among these were genes
encoding AP2 domain, homeodomain and zink finger
proteins. Proteins belonging to the CBF/DREB1 transcription factor family have previously been shown to be the
regulators of the majority of cold-response genes. The
CBF/DREB1 family belongs to the AP2/ERF super family
[27] and in Arabidopsis the AP2/ERF super family comprises 145 proteins. Based on similarities in their DNAbinding domains, these proteins have been subdivided
into the AP2, RAV, DREB and ERF subfamilies and one
family with the remaining proteins. In the AsCIUniGene
set, we found 11 sequences belonging to the AP2/ERF
superfamily (Table 5). The AP2/ERF domain of these 11
Avena proteins were more closely analysed and also compared to 45 previously described AP2/ERF containing proteins [28]. The resulting phylogenetic tree revealed that 4
of the oat AP2/ERF proteins belonged to the DREB sub-

family, 2 to the AP2/RAV subfamily and the remaining 5
sequences to the ERF subfamily (see Figure 4 and Table 6).
From the analysis it can also be deduced that the oat CBF/
DREB1 proteins are most closely related to the monocot
CBF/DREB1 proteins (Figure 4).
To further analyse relations between oat and other monocot CBF/DREB1 proteins, a multiple alignment of AP2/
ERF domains from AsCBF1, AsCBF2, AsCBF3, AsCBF4,
OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, HvCBF1, HvCBF2, HvCBF3,
ScCBF and TaDREB was made. In addition, the Arabidopsis CBF/DREB sequences AtCBF1, AtCBF2 and AtCBF3
were included to further elucidate the relation between
dicots and monocots in this respect (Figure 5). In previous
studies it has been reported that in particular two amino
acids, a valine at position 19 (V19) and a glutamic acid at
position 24 (E24) (Figure 5) in the AP2/ERF domains of
Arabidopsis have important roles in determining DNAbinding specificity [27]. The AsCBF proteins have the conserved valine in the V19 position but not the glutamic acid
in the E24 position (Figure 5). Instead, a valine is conserved in this position. This feature is in fact shared
among all included monocot CBF/DREB proteins (Figure
5). The monocot CBF/DREB1 proteins could be further
divided into three subgroups (Figure 4). The first subgroup (G1) contained the AsCBF3, HvCBF1, HvCBF2,
ScCBF, and TaDREB proteins, the second subgroup (G2)
contained the AsCBF1, AsCBF2 and HvCBF3 proteins and
the third subgroup the remaining AsCBF4, OsDREB1 and
OSDREB2 proteins (Figure 4). This grouping is based on
differences in aa at positions 10, 18 and 39 between the
different proteins (Figure 4, Figure 5). At position 10 the
G1 proteins have a basic arginine (R) residue, the G2 proteins a hydrophilic asparagine (N) and the G3 proteins N,
hydrophilic serine (S) or glycine (G) residues (Figure 5).
In position 18 there is a basic residue, an arginine (R) in
G2 and G3 proteins whereas G1 proteins have a
hydrophilic residue, a glutamine (Q) (Figure 5). Finally
G2 proteins have a hydrophilic tyrosine (Y) in position 39
while in G1 and G3 proteins this position is occupied by
a hydrophobic phenylalanine (F) except for AsCBF4,
which has a basic histidine (H) (Figure 5).
Expression of the AsCBF genes
To explore whether the four identified oat AsCBF genes
were cold induced with similar kinetics as other previously described CBF genes an expression analysis was performed. Multiplex RT-PCR was run on total RNA isolated
from leaves of three weeks old plants cold induced (to
+4°C) at time points between 15 min to 24 h using gene
specific primers for AsCBF1, AsCBF2, AsCBF3 and AsCBF4
respectively. Total RNA isolated from untreated plants at
the same time points were used as a comparison. An oat
actin gene (AsActin) was also amplified from the same
RNA samples as a loading and RNA quality control. To

define conditions where the PCR amplification was in the
exponential phase, several experiments with 30, 35 or 40
cycles were performed. This showed that the different
AsCBF genes all were induced by the cold treatment but
that they were differentially regulated (Figure 6). The
AsCBF1 gene was not detectable at time 0, was induced
after about 30 min, peaked at 4 hours and was completely

shut off after 24 h. The AsCBF3 gene had quite a different
expression pattern. It was weakly expressed also in noninduced plants, but was in addition rapidly induced
already at the first time point after 15 min. The expression
levels continued thereafter to increase, peaked after about
4 hours but still showed an elevated expression at 24 h.
The AsCBF4 gene was slowly induced and not detected at
all until after 4 hours. Unlike the others its expression
peaked a bit later, after 8 hours and then had completely
declined after 24 h. Despite several attempts, using
different primer pairs we could not obtain a reproducible
expression pattern of the AsCBF2 gene (data not shown).
Thus, the different oat AsCBF genes seem to be active during different phases of the cold acclimation process and
therefore perhaps induce different downstream gene programs. We are presently addressing this issue more
specifically.
Identification of microsatellites
Using the Sputnik program and threshold values as specified in the Methods section, we searched for potential
microsatellite (SSR) sequences in the 3716-candidate
gene set. In total, 399 di- to pentanucleotide SSRs that fulfilled the criteria of the search were identified. This corresponds to approximately one microsatellite per 13 kb of
sequence. Using the same methods and thresholds,
Cardle et al. (2000) found on average one SSR per 14 kb
of EST data in Arabidopsis. This indicates that the SSR
frequency in oat is similar to that in Arabidopsis. In the oat

sequence collection, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most
commonly found followed by di-nucleotide repeats (Figure 7), which again matches the results from Arabidopsis
[29]. Except for two exceptional TA/AT SSRs of length 45
and 55 bp, SSR lengths ranged from 15 to 25 bp, with 16
and 17 bp being the most common.
Work is now in progress to determine which of these SSRs
can be reproducibly amplified by PCR, are polymorphic,
and can be linked to a phenotypic marker. The vast
majority of the oat SSRs were found in non-coding DNA.
Since they nevertheless represent actively transcribed
genes, we expect that several of these will turn out to be
useful markers for breeding.

Discussion
Plant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have proven to be
valuable tools in molecular biology research and a
number of collections from many different plant species
are now publicly available [19]. In cereals, which are the
most important food providers on earth, several major
EST sequencing projects have been carried out. At the time
of writing, there are 284 779 publicly available ESTs from
Oryza sativa (rice), 562 786 from Triticum aestivum
(wheat) and 367 768 from Hordeum vulgare (barley). In
contrast, there are only 7 624 entries for Avena sativa (oat)
and no sequences from cold acclimated oat are available.
Obviously, there is a great need for more EST sequencing
also on this important crop. Here we contribute an additional 9 792 sequences, originating from cold-acclimated
oat, to the research community. Since we were mainly
interested in genes involved in the perception, signal
transduction and early regulation of cold acclimation, we
focused on short incubation times from a few minutes to
24 h. Already after 12 hours acclimation, there was a clear
difference in freezing tolerance between acclimated and
non-acclimated plants and winter varieties were more tolerant than spring varieties (Table 1). To confirm that cold
induced genes were overrepresented in these plants, a
northern analysis was performed on an oat gene
corresponding to the previously described cold induced
wheat COR410 gene on RNA isolated from several differ-

ent time points during cold acclimation at +4°C. This
revealed that the diagnostic COR410 gene was cold
induced also in oat and, interestingly, the peak expression
level was higher in the winter varieties (Figure 1 and Table
1). The same tendency with earlier induction and higher
expression levels was also seen for other cold induced
genes (data not shown).
Pooled leaves from confirmed cold induced plants were
used for cDNA construction and EST sequence generation.
Since leaves were used as the RNA source, the most common ESTs in our collection represent various genes
involved in photosynthesis, like chlorophyll a/b binding
protein, ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase, photosystem I reaction centre protein, fructosebisphosphate aldolase, carbonic anhydrase/carbonate
dehydrase and photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex
proteins. Other well-represented sequences are those
encoding ribosomal proteins (Table 2). However, among
the 20 most expressed gene families, dehydrin was also
present, indicating that our collection indeed represents
plants with a cold stressed induced condition. This was
confirmed by a direct comparison to an EST set derived
from leaves of non-induced plant. In this collection, dehydrin and other cold induced genes were not among the 20
most highly expressed.
From our cold induced EST collection, an AsCI UniGene
set of 2 800 genes was identified. Of these, 1 726 could be
placed into the functional groups defined by MIPS (Figure
3), leaving a relatively large proportion of the genes
(approx. 40%) outside of this classification. Perception of
the stress stimuli, transduction of the stress signal and a
molecular response are necessary activities if the plant is
to react to abiotic stress. In oat, however, very little is
known about cold stress response at this level, although
the general mechanisms are probably similar in all plants.
In order to better identify oat genes involved in the cold
response we therefore created a database denoted CSDB
(cold stress data base), in which all genes available from
the public domain and classified as cold stress responsive

indicated below the lanes (m, minutes; h, hours). Total RNA

or cold induced were collected. When the sequences in the
CSDB were compared to the oat AsCIUniGene set we
found that 398 sequences matched, indicating that at least
14% of all the genes in the AsCIUniGene set are involved
in cold stress. Among these, sequences encoding activities
related to perception, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation were overrepresented (Table 3). From
the oat EST collection generated from leaves of three
weeks old oat plants grown under green house conditions
we created a UniGene set of 1445 different transcripts
using the same tools as with the AsCIUniGene set. This
non-induced leaf set was denoted AsNIUniGene. When
the CSDB was searched with AsNIUniGene only 5.1% of
the genes were found to be similar (Table 4), a dramatic
difference to the AsCIUniGene set. These studies were
extended to EST collections from cold acclimated wheat
and barley. By creating UniGene sets (TaCIUniGene and
HvCIUniGene) both these collections were analysed in
the CSDB. We then found that the amount of cold stress
related genes were around 10% in both the wheat and barley collections (Table 4). Generalising, it seems like that at
least 10% of all expressed genes in cold acclimating plants
are devoted to various cellular responses needed to prepare the plant to freezing temperatures. The cold induced
oat gene collection will now be a valuable new asset in further analysis of such genes.

to repeat motif length. The height of the bar indicates the
number of SSRs that were found for each class. Numbers

Our functional analysis of the AsCIUniGene set showed
that transcription factor genes were represented by 107
sequences, belonging to at least 14 different families
(Table 5). Of these, 51 were homologous to cold-induced
genes from other systems. Of special importance for cold
acclimation is the CBF transcription factor family. Genes
in this family regulate several different downstream genes,
including the COR genes [16,30]. However, this regulation is complex and several different CBF genes are
involved. From the AsCIUniGene set we identified four
oat CBF genes, denoted AsCBF1, AsCBF2, AsCBF3 and
AsCBF4. Our phylogenetic and multiple alignment analysis showed that all four belonged to the monocot DREB
subfamily of ERF/AP2 domain proteins. The AsCBF1 and
AsCBF2 genes were very closely related, while the AsCBF3
and AsCBF4 genes were somewhat more distantly related
to each other and also belonged to a different clade than
the AsCBF1 and AsCBF2 genes (Figure 4 and 5).
To investigate the expression profile of the AsCBF genes,
we designed gene specific primers and by RT-PCR analysis
showed that these genes indeed were cold induced, but
that their expression patterns were different. Their
expression ranged from early induction already after 15
min (AsCBF3) to induction after 1 h (AsCBF4) and from
peaking at 4 h (AsCBF1 and AsCBF3) to peaking at 8 h
(AsCBF4) (Figure 6). The AsCBF3 was particularly interesting since it was weakly constitutively expressed, showed a
clear increase in expression after cold treatment and still
expressed after 24 h. Despite several attempts using different primer pairs we could not obtain a reproducible

BMC Plant Biology 2005, 5:18

expression pattern of the AsCBF2 gene. The reason for this
is presently not known. The complex regulation of the
AsCBF genes is different from what was previously
described in Arabidopsis [31] where the AtCBF1, AtCBF2,
and AtCBF3 genes follow more or less the same expression
pattern with a rapid induction after 15 min and a peak
after 2 h. This indicates that CBF factors have intricate and
different individual roles in inducing and maintaining
cold acclimation in oat. This is corroborated by preliminary data from barley. This cereal has at least 10 different
genes encoding CBF factors, which are all differentially
regulated (Eric Stockinger, Ohio State University, personal
communication). Thus, a more detailed analysis of the
structure and regulation of CBF genes in cereals may
reveal new pathways of cold induction, not present in Arabidopsis.
A number of genes with hitherto unknown functions were
identified in the AsCIUniGene set. These were divided
into two groups, one in which homologous or similar
genes from other systems exist and one where no significant similarities could be found to any other sequence, i.e.
genes that could be oat specific. In order to rule out that
small "non-real" peptides contributed to this group, only
sequences with open reading frames of 100 aa or more
were included. Work is now in progress to elucidate which
of the 427 oat specific unknown genes that are induced by
cold stress, drought stress or combinations of different
stress factors. Assuming that approx. 10% of these
sequences are cold related, more than 40 completely new
oat genes involved in cold acclimation will be present in
this collection. Such genes are potentially very interesting
and could encode hitherto uncharacterised proteins or
regulatory factors involved in cold-adaptation and freezing protection
Microsatellites (SSRs) are excellent DNA markers for
genetic mapping, since they are polymorphic, abundant,
show a co-dominant inheritance and are easy to analyse
by PCR [32]. SSRs have therefore been widely utilized in
plant genomic studies [33-36]. They are especially advantageous when there is a need to track desirable traits in
large-scale breeding programs and when defining anchor
points for map-based gene cloning strategies. However,
only a few oat SSRs are currently available. Here we identify approximately 400 potential oat SSRs, the majority
present in the non-coding part of the EST sequence. Work
is now in progress to optimise primers for these SSRs and
to identify the ones that give reliable PCR products and
are polymorphic. Crude genetic maps have been developed for both diploid [37,38] and hexaploid oat [39], but
these maps need to be improved [40]. The best SSR
markers will therefore be mapped to the oat genome, and
linked to valuable genetic markers.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/18

The AsCIUniGene set will now be used to fabricate an oat
biochip carrying all 2800 identified genes. In addition, by
constructing subtractive libraries, more cold-related ESTs
will be generated. Various expression studies will be performed and genes from our collection that show a rapid
induction to either cold or drought will be selected for further analysis. We are especially interested in those genes in
our EST collection that show a very rapid induction at
+4°C and have DNA binding properties. Especially promising genes will be tested in transgenic Arabidopsis and oat
systems [41,42] and by complementing chosen Arabidopsis T-DNA knock-out mutants.

Conclusion
A UniGene set of 2800 genes was produced from a cold
induced oat cDNA library. Further analysis revealed that
genes related to cold stress were overrepresented in this
library and that several genes could encode hitherto
unknown functions. RT-PCR analyses of CBF
transcription factor genes revealed that they are differentially expressed in oat and therefore might regulate different cold pathways. Approx. 400 potential SSR markers are
also present in the collection, several in non-coding
regions and in close vicinity to genes involved in regulating cold acclimation.

Methods
Plant growth
Oat plants, Avena sativa v. Gerald, 83-48 CH, SW Matilda
and SW Birgitta were obtained from the SW-collection
(Svalöf Weibull AB, Landskrona, Sweden). Gerald and 8348 are English winter varieties while Matilda and Birgitta
are Swedish spring varieties. Seeds were germinated in 2liter pots filled with fertilized and pressed peat. Plants
were cultured in a greenhouse under natural light supplemented with metal halogen lamps, giving a photon flux
density of 240 µmol per m2 per sec. The photoperiod was
18 h, the day/night temperature was 20/12°C and the
relative humidity about 70%. The plants were watered as
needed.
Cold induction experiments
To investigate the cold acclimation capacity of the chosen
oat varieties, 24 pots with 10 seeds each of Gerald, 83-48
CH, Matilda, and Birgitta were prepared. About three
weeks after germination, when each plant had produced 3
– 4 leaves, pots were moved to a dark cold room at +4°C
(± 0.5°C) and incubated for 12 and 24 hours. After this
period the pots were moved to -15°C (± 1°C) for 3 h, 6 h
and 12 h. In addition, plants were moved from the greenhouse directly to -15°C, and incubated for 3 h, 6 h and 12
h. After the cold incubation period, the plants were moved
back to the greenhouse for recovery. One week later the
cold damage was visually scored.

Total RNA preparation
Winter oat (Gerald) was germinated and grown for three
weeks in the greenhouse. They were then incubated in the
dark at +4°C (± 0.5°C) for 4, 16, 32 or 48 hours. At every
timepoint, leaves were randomly picked from several individual plants and pooled. RNA was extracted from pooled
leaves essentially as described by Chang et al. (1993). Tissue isolates were ground in liquid nitrogen, transferred to
65°C CTAB extraction buffer (2% CTAB [hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide] [Sigma], 2% PVP [polyvinyl
pyrrolidone, intrinsic viscosity 29–32] [Sigma], 100 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 25 mM EDTA, 2.0 M NaCl, 0.5 g per L
spermidine, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), and extracted twice
in equal volumes of chisam (phenol:chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol 1:1:24). RNA was precipitated overnight at
4°C by adding 0.25 v/v 10 M LiCl. The precipitate was dissolved in 1 × SSTE (1.0 M NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA), pH 8.0, extracted with an equal volume of chisam, precipitated with two volumes 99.5% ethanol, and re-suspended in distilled water treated with
DEPC. Total RNA of each sample was quantified spectrophotometrically at OD260. An OD260 of 1 corresponded to
40 µg/ml RNA. Subsequently, the RNA was precipitated
and re-suspended in DEPC-treated distilled water to a
final concentration of 1 mg/ml.
Northern hybridization
Ten µg of total RNA were denatured with glyoxal/DMSO
[43] and separated on a 1% agarose gel. The RNA was
blotted onto a nylon membrane (Boeringer-Mannheim)
and hybridized in Church hybridization buffer [44]. An
oat sequence, similar to the wheat COR410 gene was used
as a probe. This was isolated by PCR amplification from
oat genomic DNA using the forward primer 5'-ATGGAGGATGAGAGGAGCAC-3' and the reverse primer 5'-TTTCTTCTCCTCCTCGGGC-3'. Primer design was based on the
wheat sequence. Amplification resulted in an 530 bp
sequence which was verified by DNA sequencing (data
not shown). The fragment was labelled with 32P-dCTP
(Amersham), using a random hexanucleotide mix and
labelling-grade Kleenow enzyme (Boeringer-Mannheim).
Stringency washes were performed at 65°C for 2 × 5 min
in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS and for 4 × 5 min in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1%
SDS. Membranes were exposed to X-ray film (Du Pont
Medical Scandinavia AB).
cDNA library construction and EST sequencing
Total RNAs isolated from plants incubated at +4°C for 6,
12 and 24 hours were pooled. The RNA pooled
preparation was sent to MWG Biotech (Germany) where
cDNA libraries were constructed, cDNA cloned into the
pSPORT1 vector [45] and EST sequencing was performed.

Bioinformatic tools
All similarity searches were batch executed locally using
the BlastN, BlastX or TBlastX tools [46], all included in the
BLASTALL program package [47]. Transeq, a program
from the EMBOSS package [48,49] was used to translate
DNA sequences into protein sequences. Conserved
domain search (CD-search) was performed against the
Conserved domain database (CDD) at NCBI [47] using
the Reversed position specific Blast (RPS-BLAST) algorithm with translated ESTs. InterProScan [50,51] was used
to scan translated ESTs for protein signatures in the InterPro member databases. For the multiple alignments we
used ClustalW [52], included in the MacVector 7.2.2 package (Accelrys Inc). The phylogenetic tree was constructed
by means of the MacVector 7.2.2 tool kit using the neighbour-joining (NJ) algorithm. Appropriate PERL scripts
were written in order to pipeline the process of running
tools in sequence, parsing result files and loading the
results into the database. All data and results are stored in
a PostgreSQL database.
Data sets and treatment
In this paper started off with four different primary
sequence data sets. The first set was the 9792 ESTs from
cold acclimated oat, which was denoted the Avena sativa
Cold Induced (AsCI) data set. The second data set comprises 2189 ESTs [53], which originated from untreated
green leafs of 3 weeks old oat plants and was denoted the
Avena sativa NonInduced (AsNI) data set. The third data
set, which contains 4337 sequences originates from cold
acclimated wheat [53] was denoted the Triticum aestivum
Cold Induced (TaCI) data set and the final data set comprises 5418 sequences from cold stressed barley plants
[53] and was denoted the Hordeum vulgare Cold Induced
(HvCI) data set.
EST clustering and assembly
The AsCI data set was filtered, clustered and assembled
with the Paracel Transcript Assembler™ (PTA) program
(Paracel, Pasadena, CA), which integrates quality filtering,
clustering, and assembly into a single pipeline. The filtering step includes masking of vector sequence, low-complexity, low-quality, repeats and poly(A) regions. In the
next step clustering was performed. Here PTA utilizes the
Haste algorithm in an all-versus-all sequence comparison.
The criterion set for clustering sequences together was an
alignment of a minimum of 100 bases and with at least
93% similarity between the aligned sequences. Sequences
that did not fit into such clusters were defined as singlets.
In the assembly step PTA uses CAP4, which is a refinement of the CAP3 algorithm [54]. Sequences that did not
fit into a contig were also defined as singlets. Finally, ESTs
in singlets that had passed the filters but had an unmasked
sequence < 100 bases were discarded. The resulting singlets and contigs represented the AsCI candidate gene set.

The other data sets where clustered and assembled into
candidate gene sets using the TGI clustering tool [55]. The
clustering was performed by a slightly modified version of
NCBI's MegaBlast program [56] and the resulting clusters
were assembled using CAP3.
Most abundant ESTs
Individual ESTs were first annotated by the best BlastX
homolog match against Arabidopsis thaliana, where an E
value of < 10-10 was used. The A. thaliana proteins were
retrieved from the MIPS Arabidopsis database (MATDB).
Thereafter the annotation given in the KOG database [18]
was retrieved for each A. thaliana protein. For those A.
thaliana homologs that did not have a KOG annotation,
the EST sequence inherited the annotation from MATDB.
Those sequences that did not have an A. thaliana homolog
above the threshold were annotated with the best
homolog match from a BlastX search versus the nr database at NCBI. Again an E value of < 10-10 was used.
UniGene set determination
Non-redundant sets of genomic singlets and contigs (UniGene sets) were created in a two-step procedure. First
sequence information derived from rRNA, chloroplastic
DNA or mitochondrial DNA was identified by comparison to homologous Arabidopsis sequences (accession nr.
X52322, AP000423, and Y08501/Y08502 respectively)
using BlastN. In this way, sequences containing rRNA or
mitochondrial DNA were separated from the genomic
sequences.

The second step was a BlastX search of the non-redundant
(nr) protein database. The accession numbers and E values of the best matches were extracted from the result file.
The criterion used for a sequence to be identified as nonredundant was based on a unique best match based on the
accession numbers from the BlastX search. If two or more
query sequences resulted in best matches with identical
accession numbers they were sorted according to their E
values. Only the sequence with the lowest E value was
included in the UniGene set.
Annotation and functional classification
The UniGene sets were annotated based on the results of
BlastX searches of the nr database. The definition line of
the Blast match was used as a description of the putative
function of the UniGene gene. An E value threshold of 1010 was used and UniGene genes that did not meet this
requirement were annotated as unknown.

Our functional classification of individual genes followed
the functional categories as defined in the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences (MIPS) Arabidopsis
thaliana functional catalogue (MATDB; downloaded from
http://mips.gsf.de). To create a semi-automated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/18

functional classification pipeline a two-step procedure
was developed. First, a BlastX search was performed with
the UniGene set versus the MATDB, requiring an E value
of < 10-10. Locus name and E value of the best match for
each gene were extracted from the result file. Secondly, the
functional classification was identified by a search with
the locus name in the Arabidopsis functional catalogue.
Genes that did not meet the criteria for being functionally
classified based on the semi-automated procedure were
classified manually based on the annotation and the
result from a conserved domain search versus the conserved domain database (CDD) downloaded from the
NCBI web site.
Identification of microsatellite sequences
A set of 3716 sequences resulting from the clustering and
assembly steps, comprising a total of 5.3 Mb of sequence,
was searched for microsatellites (simple sequence repeats;
SSRs) in the form of mononucleotide repeats of > 15 bp,
dinucleotide repeats of > 14 bp, trinucleotide repeats of >
15 bp, tetranucleotide repeats of > 16 bp, and pentanucleotide repeats of > 20 bp, as previously described by [29].
To better locate di- to pentanucleotide repeats, we also
used the program Sputnik, developed at the Washington
University [57]. This program allows minor imperfections
on the SSRs by implementing a scoring system for insertions,
mismatches
and
deletions.
To
locate
mononucleotide repeats we used a simple PERL script
developed by ourselves.
RT-PCR
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactions (RTPCR) were performed on total RNA prepared from leaves
of three weeks old oat plants (variety Gerald), incubated
for 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 8 h and 24 h
at +4°C, using the SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogene™). RNA samples were first DNase treated
using the Dnase I Amplification Garde from Invitrogene™.
To amplify the different AsCBF genes the following primers were used:

AsCBF1 forward primer 5'-CCACAGTCCACCGTATCAGCAAG-3'
AsCBF1 reverse primer 5'-CGTCTCCTTGAACTTGGTGCG3'

For the AsCBF1 gene a product size of 174 bp was
expected, for AsCBF3 104 bp and for AsCBF4 172 bp. The
AsActin gene used as a control and was amplified using the
forward primer 5'-GCGACAATGGAACTGGC-3 and the
reverse primer 5'-GTGGTGAAGGAGTAACCTCTCTCG-3'.
In this case the expected product size was 580 bp. The RTPCR reactions were run according to the manufacturer's
instructions and 100 ng total RNA were used in each reaction. A 30-min reverse transcription at 55°C followed by
a PCR amplification step with 30, 35 or 40 cycles were
used. To verify the outcome of the RT-PCR reactions,
equal amounts (30%) of the corresponding RT-PCR reaction mixes were applied on 1% agarose gels containing
ethidium bromide (0.5 ng per ml).
