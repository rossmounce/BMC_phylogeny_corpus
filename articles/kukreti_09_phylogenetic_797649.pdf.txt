Abstract
Background: Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) have been mostly circulating silently with dominant
serotypes DENV-2 and DENV-3 in India. However recent times have marked an increase in DENV1 circulation in yearly outbreaks. Many studies have not been carried out on this virus type, leaving
a lacunae pertaining to the circulating genotypes, since its earliest report in India. In the present
study, we sequenced CprM gene junction of 13 DENV-1 isolated from Delhi and Gwalior (North
India) between 2001–2007 and one 1956 Vellore isolate as reference. For comparison, we
retrieved 11 other Indian and 70 global reference sequences from NCBI database, making sure that
Indian and global isolates from all decades are available for comparative analysis.
Results: The region was found to be AT rich with no insertion or deletion. Majority of the
nucleotide substitutions were silent, except 3 non-conservative amino acid changes (I → T, A → T
and L → S at amino acid positions 59,114 and 155 respectively) in the Indian DENV-1 sequences,
sequenced in this study. Except two 1997–98 Delhi isolates, which group in genotype I; all other
Indian isolates group in genotype III. All Indian genotype III DENV-1 exhibited diversity among
them, giving rise to at least 4 distinct lineages (India 1–4) showing proximity to isolates from diverse
geographic locations.
Conclusion: The extensive phylogenetic analysis revealed consistent existence of multiple lineages
of DENV-1 genotype III during the last 5 decades in India.

Background
Dengue fever (DF) is one of the most important arboviral
diseases of humans in tropic and sub-tropics [1,2]. In
South-East Asia, with a total population of 1.5 billion,

approximately 1.3 billion people live at risk of acquiring
DF or DHF [3,4]. Its etiological agent, Dengue virus
belongs to family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus; and exists
in 4 antigenically distinct serotypes, Dengue virus type 1–

4 (DENV-1 to 4) [5]. Although history of dengue virus in
India dates back to 1946, however the first major outbreak was reported in 1963 in Calcutta. Since then many
outbreaks have been reported from all over the country [69]. Although all 4 dengue serotypes have been reported to
circulate in the country [10] but only DENV-2 and DENV3 have been implicated in major DF/dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) outbreaks [11-14]. We and some other workers have earlier reported CprM gene based genotyping of
DENV-2 and DENV-3 which has proved to be useful for
carrying out molecular epidemiology of these viruses
[12,14-16]. Lately there has been a rise in DENV-1 associated cases, which account for around 30% of the total
cases in most recent 2006 DF outbreak, when it co-existed
with pre-dominant DENV-3 [17]. Earlier DENV-1 has
been reported from south India (Vellore) in 1956 and
1962–64; and from north India (Delhi and Gwalior) in
1970, 1982, 1997–98 and 2002–2006. Inspite of all these
reports, no attempt has been made to study the phylogeny
of this virus since its emergence. With increase in DENV-1
cases, the need to understand the genetic nature of circulating DENV-1 has become even more necessary as it will
harbors significant information regarding the genotypes
of the DENV-1 circulating in the country for so long. In
addition it will also indicate whether these viruses were
pre-existing or an importation. With this view, present
study was undertaken to understand the genetic nature of
circulating DENV-1 in India and to trace their evolution
during the last 50 years, by sequencing CprM gene junction of 13 DEN-1 isolated in India during 2001–2007 and
comparing 354 bp of this region with 11 other Indian
DENV-1 sequences reported till date with at least one
sequence from each decade, since it was first reported in
the country. Seventy other global reference sequences
were also retrieved from NCBI nucleotide database for
comparison. This study shall help to fill the lacunae pertaining to knowledge of circulating DENV-1 genotypes in
India since its first report.

Results
Thirteen serum samples found positive for DENV-1 during dengue outbreaks in northern India during 2001–
2007 were included in this study. For sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis we selected a 354 bp
sequence (nucleotides 208–561) from CprM gene junction of 13 DENV-1 sequenced in this study and compared
them with 11 representatives Indian and 70 other global
geographically diverse DENV-1 sequences, spanning last 5
decades. All these sequences were aligned with the prototype Indian DENV-1 isolate (India-56 (Vellore) that was
also sequenced in the study. This region was found to be
AT rich and the AT composition of the Indian DENV-1
varied from 52.6–53.7%. The alignment did not reveal
any base insertion or deletion, only substitutions which
were mostly synonymous in nature. Deduced amino acid

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/1

alignment of the Indian isolates sequenced in this study
revealed that the non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, gave rise to only 3 non-conservative amino acid
changes i.e. isoleucine to threonine (Amino acid position
59) and leucine to serine (Amino acid position 155) as
seen in some 2006 and 2007 Delhi isolates; and alanine
to threonine (Amino acid position 114) as observed in
2001 Delhi and 2002 Gwalior isolates (amino acid alignment shown as Figure 1 and 2).
On comparison of sequences, we observed that one 2002
Gwalior and two 2001 Delhi CprM sequences exhibited
close nucleotide identity of 99.7% to a 2004 Reunion
Island sequence. It was also found that the most recent
Indian isolates from 2006 and 2007 show mean sequence
identities of 96.45%, 95.35%, 97.5% and 96.75% with
1956 Vellore, 1970 Delhi, 1982 Delhi and 2004 Gwalior
sequences; and 98.6–99.2% (mean 98.9%) nucleotide
identity among themselves. On analyzing the Indian reference sequences taken for comparison, it was observed
that 2005 Delhi sequences exhibited 95.8–99.2% (mean
97.5%) identity with sequences from South American isolates sampled between 1989–2001. Three sequences from
south India (Vellore) sampled in 1962–64 show a nucleotide identity of 96.6–96.9% (mean 96.75%) with a 1956
sequence from the same area. Two Delhi sequences from
years 1997 and 1998 show more nucleotide identity i.e.
95.8–96.6% (mean 96.2%) with Japan Mochizuki
sequence isolated in 1943; than to the other Indian
sequences, with whom theses two sequences show a
nucleotide identity of only 93%.
On carrying out the phylogenetic analysis of all these
DENV-1, on basis of CprM sequences, we observed that
they grouped in 3 distinct clusters (Figure 3) or genotypes
with a mean inter-genotype sequence divergence ~7.2%.
All the Indian isolates, grouped in genotype III except 2
Delhi 1997 and 1998 isolates which grouped in genotype
I showing closeness to 1943 Mochizuki strain from Japan.
All the Indian Isolates classified in genotype III show
intra-genotypic clustering giving rise to 4 distinct Indian
lineages (India-1 through 4) and some Indian isolates
although clustering together but not giving rise to a separate lineage. India-1 lineage consists of DENV-1 from
Delhi isolated in 2005 and is close to South American
viruses isolated from Brail, Argentina, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela between 1990–2007. Lying
close to this lineage is another lineage, India-4 clustering
with a 2004 African isolate from Reunion Island. Delhi
2001 and Gwalior 2002 sequences exhibit 2 C → T (at
nucleotide position 274 and 522) and 2 G → A (at nucleotide position 434 and 436) transitions, which they share
with 2004 Reunion island sequence. Alanine to threonine
amino acid change at position 114 was also observed
exclusively in this lineage and hence considered as a line-

age specific change (Figure 1). Designation of these Indian
lineages i.e. India-1–4 do not signify a chronological
order, however they were sequentially designated in order
of discovery of these lineages. 1962–64 strains from South
India (Vellore) also formed a different lineage (India-3)
that diverged long ago, with no other Indian and global
isolates clustering in this group. There were other Indian
sequences which clustered together but did not form a distinct grouping or lineage. These include 1956 Vellore isolate, 1970 and 1982 Delhi isolates and 2004 Gwalior
isolate. These sequences were close to 1993 isolates from
Singapore and Comoros and a 2005 isolate form Brunei.
All these sequences showed a common T → C transition
at nucleotide position 208. These DENV-1 were also close
to most recent isolates from Delhi sampled in 2006 and
2007 which clustered together to give rise to another independent lineage (India-2) that exhibited 3 lineage specific
nucleotide changes (A → G, C → T and T → G at nucleotide position 307, 469 and 520). Amino acid changes
Isoleucine to threonine (at position 59 in Figure 1) and
leucine to serine (at position 155 in Figure 2) were also
observed in some and not all isolates in this lineage and
hence could not be designated as lineage specific changes.
Genotype I in which two of the Indian isolates from Delhi
(1997–98) cluster; consists of viruses from Asia except 1
African isolate from Djibouti isolated in 1998. Although,
most Asian strains in this genotype are from South East
Asian countries viz. Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and
Singapore; 2 recent isolates from China and 1 very old
strain from Japan (Japan 43 Mochizuki strain) are the
only 3 strains from North Asia that lie in this genotype.
None of the Indian strains was classified as genotype II.
This genotype was more cosmopolitan in nature with
strains from East Africa, Asia and South Pacific. East African strains include recent viruses from East African islands
of Seychelles and Reunion isolated during 2003–04;
South Pacific strains include viruses from Hawaii, Nauru
Island and Micronesia isolated between 74-04; and Asian
strains include viruses from China, Philippines and Indonesia isolated during 1995–2004. Although African
strains are clustering together, making a distinct grouping;
strains from South Pacific and Asia do not show any such
geographical clustering within this genotype.

Discussion
The large scale climatic and demographic changes have
resulted in distribution of Aedes species in hitherto
unknown areas. This has led to appearance of dengue
infection in many newer areas with an estimated 3 billion
people living at risk of this infection around the world.
Considering the high rates of Aedes infestation and the
presence of high-risk susceptible population, the probability of dengue epidemic always remain very high in

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/1

India [18]. The pathogenesis of dengue is not yet fully
understood. Though re-infection with a heterologous
dengue serotype remain a major risk factor for DHF, however, occurrence of DHF even in primary infection makes
the role of virus in pathogenesis all the more important.
The incursion of new genotype into an area is also being
attributed to the severe form of the disease [19]. All these
facts drive the scientific community to pay more attention
towards the genetic nature of dengue viruses and their
spread in the population.
Like other RNA viruses, the dengue viruses also revealed
strong genetic diversity. Dengue serotypes are further classified into 4–5 'genotypes' based on their genetic diversity
[20]. However in recent reports many researchers have categorized DENV-1 in three distinct genotypes [21-23].
Researchers have also reported clustering of sequences
below the genotype level that correlate with the geographical origin and/or time of isolation and defined as lineages/clades [21,23,24]. Different regions of dengue
genome like Envelope, E-NS1, C-prM and complete
genome has been utilized for the genotyping
[15,20,21,24]. We have utilized the sequence information
of CprM gene junction in this study. The genotyping
based on the CprM gene junction has been adopted by
several researchers including us in the recent past
[12,14,15,25]. This results in faster and economical genotyping due to utilization of a single set of primer pair for
both amplification and sequencing [26].
The involvement of DENV-1 in major dengue outbreaks
in India was not recorded. Most of the major dengue outbreaks are attributed to DENV-2 and DENV-3 viruses.
However, DENV-1 were isolated from different parts of
India at regular intervals, since its first isolation from
southern India (Vellore) in 1956. It is increasingly implicated as a minor serotype during recent outbreaks in
India, including the Delhi outbreak in 2006 [17,27]. The
lack of sequence analysis of Indian DENV-1 also affects
the effective monitoring of circulating genotypes in India.
In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of
13 recent DENV-1 directly from clinical samples to avoid
selection and sequencing of mutant viral RNA which may
occur during isolation/propagation in mouse brain/cell
culture [28]. The comparison of deduced amino acid
sequence revealed 3 important unique substitutions in
2001–02 and some of the 2006–07 Indian isolates. These
involve substitutions of hydrophobic Isoleucine and Leucine by hydrophilic Threonine and Serine respectively in
some 2006–07 isolates; and hydrophobic Alanine by
hydrophilic Threonine in Delhi 2001 and Gwalior 2002
isolates. The hydrophilic amino acids are found mostly on
the surface of the protein and are involved in the immunological interactions. The implications of these unique

changes in recent Indian DENV-1 warrants further studies
to understand their virulence and epidemic potential.

lates clustered together indicating independent evolution
of these viruses in this area.

The phylogenetic analysis revealed the Indian DENV-1
collected over last 5 decades fall into two genotypes (I and
III). However, majority of the viruses are grouped within
genotype III, two isolates sampled from Delhi during
1997–98 group in genotype I. These genotype I viruses
from Delhi were found closely related to the 1943 Japanese Mochizuki strain. Their proximity was however difficult to explain. Similar type of genotype I viruses were also
found circulating predominantly in other Asian countries
including Thailand and China around the same time.
Presence of an African isolate from Djibouti in this group
probably signifies the introduction of these Asian viruses
in Djibouti or vice-versa. Thailand strains belonging to
this genotype were isolated over four decades (1964–
2001); indicating persistence of this genotype in Thailand
for a long time. However, the restricted circulation of genotype I viruses in Delhi for just 2 years is very surprising.

Conclusion
Thus we conclude that during the last 5 decades there has
been a persistence of genotype III of DENV-1 in India with
genotype I being present only during 2 years i.e. 1997–98
in Delhi. Most of the Indian DENV-1, grouping in genotype III were quite diverse, giving rise to distinct lineages.
Thus, there has been persistence of multiple lineages of
DENV-1 genotype III during the last 50 years in India.
This study clearly identified the genotypes of DENV-1 circulating in India since 1956. It also confirmed the utility
of CprM gene junction for rapid and economical genotyping in endemic areas. The prevalence of multiple lineages
of DENV-1 in India warrants sustained monitoring of the
circulating viruses, to implement effective control measures at the earliest.

Materials and methods
The phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed continuous circulation of genotype III viruses over the last 50 years in
India. Interestingly, majority of the Indian genotype III
viruses are found to be phylogenetically quite distinct. It
is surprising to find that the recent viruses recovered in
quick succession in 2001–02, 2004 and 2006–07 from
northern India also belong to separate lineages. In contrast, this type of distinct lineage pattern was not observed
among Indian DENV-2 and 3 [12,14].

Clinical samples
Serum samples from febrile patients suspected for dengue
infection were collected from Delhi and Gwalior during
2001–2007. Informed consent from all the patients and/
or their parents (in minors) was obtained, before collection of clinical samples. Approval of the ethical committee of both institutions was obtained to carry out the
present study. Thirteen serum samples found positive for
DENV-1 RNA were included in this study.

Domingo et al., [24] has earlier established 2 distinct lineages of DENV-1 in India and designated them as India-1
and India-2. While India-1 has shown closeness to South
American strains, India-2 exhibited close proximity to a
1993 isolate from Singapore. In our earlier study we have
substantiated the presence of India-1 and India-2 lineages
during 2005 and 2006 respectively and also reported a
third lineage that was present in south India (Vellore)
between 1962–64, whose present existence could not be
established [17]. In this study we now report another lineage, which consists of viruses from Delhi and Gwalior
sampled in 2001 and 2002 respectively; that we designated as India-4. During the same period presence of
India-2 lineage was also reported [24], there by suggesting
the co-circulation of India-2 and India-4 lineage in India
during 2001. As evident from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) Indian DENV-1 isolated in 1956, 1970, 1982 and
2004 could not be designated in a separate lineage but
their relatedness could be deciphered by clustering
together of these isolates in the phylogenetic tree.

Virus
Dengue virus serotype 1 (P-23086) obtained from the
National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India was used
as reference strain in this study. This is the prototype
Indian DENV-1 virus isolated from Vellore, India in 1956.

In the cosmopolitan genotype (genotype II) with viruses
from East Africa, Asia and South Pacific, only African iso-

Extraction of viral RNA
Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μl of serum samples
and P-23086 infected C6/36 supernatant by using
QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Finally RNA
was eluted in 50 μl of nuclease free water and stored at 80°C until use.
Reverse transcription- Polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
The RT-PCR was carried out in a 25 μl reaction volume
using the access quick one-step RT-PCR kit (Promega,
USA) containing PCR master mix, AMV-RT, and respective
sense and antisense primers [(D1: 5'-TCAATATGCTGAAACGCGCGAGAAACCG-3')
(D2:
5'-TTGCACCAACAGTCAATGTCTTCAGGTTC-3')] [26] in a thermal
cycler (BioRad, USA). The thermal profile of the RT-PCR
reaction was- RT step at 42°C for 45 min, followed by PCR

step of initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by
35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at
55°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 2 min and final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were gel
purified from 1.2% agarose gel using the QIAquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) and used as template
in sequencing reaction.
Sequencing reaction
Both strands of the purified amplicons were sequenced
employing Big dye terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the
standard protocol described by us earlier [12]. The cycle
sequenced product was purified by precipitation with
75% isopropanol and was vaccum dried. The DNA pellet
was resuspended in 10 μl of template suppression reagent
(TSR), heated at 95°C for 2 min and loaded on the ABI
310 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
USA).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The CprM gene sequences of fourteen Indian DENV-1
obtained in the present study were submitted to GenBank
at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (accession numbers are
mentioned in Table 1). BLAST search was carried-out to

confirm the identity of strains. For comparison, we
retrieved 11 DENV-1 CprM sequences from India and 70
belonging to diverse geographical locations from the global data base as shown in phylogenetic tree (Figure 3).
Lasergene 5 software package (DNASTAR Inc, USA) was
used to examine the percent identity and diversity among
sequences. Sequences were translated into amino acid and
aligned using BioEdit v7.0.9. Phylogenetic analysis was
carried out using MEGA version 3.1 [29]. Phylogenetic
tree was constructed employing Neighbor Joining method
[30] with bootstrap analysis of 10000 replicates.
