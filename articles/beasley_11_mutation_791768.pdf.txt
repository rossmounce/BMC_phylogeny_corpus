Mutation of L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid synthase
genes blocks staphyloferrin B synthesis in
Staphylococcus aureus
Federico C Beasley1†, Johnson Cheung1† and David E Heinrichs1,2*

Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus synthesizes two siderophores, staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B, that
promote iron-restricted growth. Previous work on the biosynthesis of staphyloferrin B has focused on the role of
the synthetase enzymes, encoded from within the sbnA-I operon, which build the siderophore from the precursor
molecules citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate and L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid. However, no information yet exists on
several other enzymes, expressed from the biosynthetic cluster, that are thought to be involved in the synthesis of
the precursors (or synthetase substrates) themselves.
Results: Using mutants carrying insertions in sbnA and sbnB, we show that these two genes are essential for the
synthesis of staphyloferrin B, and that supplementation of the growth medium with L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid
can bypass the block in staphyloferrin B synthesis displayed by the mutants. Several mechanisms are proposed for
how the enzymes SbnA, with similarity to cysteine synthase enzymes, and SbnB, with similarity to amino acid
dehydrogenases and ornithine cyclodeaminases, function together in the synthesis of this unusual
nonproteinogenic amino acid L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.
Conclusions: Mutation of either sbnA or sbnB result in abrogation of synthesis of staphyloferrin B, a siderophore
that contributes to iron-restricted growth of S. aureus. The loss of staphyloferrin B synthesis is due to an inability to
synthesize the unusual amino acid L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid which is an important, iron-liganding component
of the siderophore structure. It is proposed that SbnA and SbnB function together as an L-Dap synthase in the S.
aureus cell.

Background
The stimulus of iron limitation is a key sensory trigger
for virtually all bacteria. Iron is scarce in the fluids of
mammalian hosts, due to rapid oxidation of the soluble
ferrous (Fe2+) form to the less soluble ferric (Fe3+) form
under aerobic, physiological conditions [1]. Any residual
soluble ferric iron is further sequestered through high
affinity binding by innate immune proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin [2]. For many pathogenic
microbes, decreasing iron availability leads to the
enhanced expression of iron acquisition mechanisms
and virulence factors, which frequently play direct roles

in liberating iron from host sequestration factors [2-4].
A prevalent component of bacterial iron responses is
the secretion of siderophores. These small molecules
scavenge residual ferric iron as well as transferrin-bound
iron from the extracellular milieu with extremely high
affinity and are actively reimported into bacterial cells
via dedicated ABC-type transport systems [5,6]. Siderophore assembly pathways fall into two broad classes:
nonribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS) and NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) synthesis [7,8]. NRPS siderophores are peptidic constructs assembled in a stepwise
fashion by large, heterofunctional, multidomain proteins,
independently of ribosomes. NIS siderophores are
formed via condensation of alternating subunits of
dicarboxylic acids with diamines, amino alcohols, and
alcohols by sets of synthetase enzymes.

Encoded within the genome of S. aureus are two loci
directing the production of NIS-type siderophores. The
sfaABCD locus encodes for proteins involved in biosynthesis and secretion of staphyloferrin A, a molecule
also produced by the majority of less pathogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci [9-12]. This metabolite is
assembled from one unit of the nonproteinogenic
amino acid D-ornithine and two units of citrate; the
staphyloferrin A biosynthetic pathway was recently
established in an elegant study [10]. The sbnABCDEFGHI operon encodes for biosynthesis and secretion of
staphyloferrin B. This siderophore has been identified
in S. aureus and a few species of coagulase-negative
staphylococci, and in the Gram-negative genera Ralstonia and Cupriavidus [13-16]. However, based on early
studies by Haag et al. [16] and recent staphylococcal
genome data, staphyloferrin B may also be produced
by other coagulase-positive staphylococci other than S.
aureus. Staphyloferrin B is comprised of one unit each
of citric acid, 1,2-diaminoethane, alpha-ketoglutaric
acid, and the nonproteinogenic amino acid L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (L-Dap) [15-17]. These precursors
are condensed by NIS synthetase enzymes SbnC, SbnE,
and SbnF, with modification of an intermediate metabolite by decarboxylase SbnH [17]. Inactivation of staphyloferrin B biosynthesis (via chromosomal deletion
of a siderophore synthetase) was previously shown to
reduce the virulence of S. aureus in a mouse infection
model [14], which underscores the contribution of specialized iron uptake mechanisms to pathogenesis. In
addition to the characterized functions of SbnCEFH in
staphyloferrin B biosynthesis, the sbn operon also
encodes several auxiliary enzymes predicted to be
involved in generation of staphyloferrin B precursors
or substrates that would be fed to the NIS synthetases.
Of interest are the first two genes sbnA and sbnB,
which encode proteins with a yet undiscovered role in
staphyloferrin B biosynthesis. Furthermore, it is intriguing that SbnA and SbnB share sequence homology
to the enzymes VioB and VioK, respectively, of the
viomycin assembly pathway in Streptomyces sp. [18].
Like staphyloferrin B, the antibiotic viomycin molecule
also contains L-Dap as a structural component. It was
hypothesized by Thomas et al. [18] that VioB (homologous to SbnA) catalyzes a b-substitution replacement
reaction to generate L-Dap from (O-acetyl-)L-serine
using ammonia as a nucleophile. The source of this
ammonia would come from the activity of VioK, which
like SbnB, shares sequence identity with bacterial
ornithine cyclodeaminases that would catalyze the
cyclization of L-Orn to L-Pro with concomitant release
of ammonia. Therefore, it is probable that VioK and
VioB (or SbnA and SbnB) function synergistically as
an L-Dap synthase. The production of L-Dap is a

Page 2 of 12

critical process because the molecule is used twice per
mole of staphyloferrin B [17]. Specifically, both prochiral carboxyl groups of citrate are condensed onto a
molecule of L-Dap as catalyzed by the synthetases
SbnE and SbnF [17].
In this study, through a series of genetics-based
experiments, we propose that the generation of L-Dap
in S. aureus is a coupled function of enzymes SbnA and
SbnB, whose activity is essential for the downstream
biosynthesis of the siderophore staphyloferrin B.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions

Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used
throughout the study are described in Table 1. E. coli
strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth, with the following antibiotic concentrations used for selection of
plasmids: kanamycin (30 μg/mL), ampicillin (100 μg/
mL), erythromycin (300 μg/mL). S. aureus strains were
grown in tryptic soy broth for genetic manipulations,
with the following antibiotic concentrations used for
selection of strains bearing plasmids or chromosomal
resistance cassettes: erythromycin (3 μg/mL), chloramphenicol (5 μg/mL), tetracycline (4 μg/mL). For characterization of growth phenotypes, S. aureus strains were
grown in Tris-minimal succinate (TMS) [19] broth.
TMS culture medium was pretreated with Chelex-100
resin (Bio-Rad) for 24 h at 4°C with 10% (wt/vol) Chelex-100 resin prior to autoclaving. Some micronutrients
were added postautoclave. Further culture amendments
are detailed below. All media were made with water
purified through a Milli-Q water purification system
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). All glassware was treated
overnight in 0.1 M HCl and rinsed thoroughly with
Millipore-filtered water to remove residual contaminating iron.
DNA and PCR preparation and purification

Plasmid DNA was isolated from bacteria using Qiaprep
mini-spin kits (Qiagen), as directed. S. aureus cells were
incubated for 30 min at 37°C in P1 buffer amended with
50 mg/mL lysostaphin (Roche Diagnostics) prior to
addition of lysis buffer P2. Restriction enzymes, T4
DNA ligase, Klenow fragment, and PwoI polymerase
were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Pfu Turbo
polymerase was purchased from Stratagene and oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. For all PCR reactions, genomic template was
from S. aureus strain Newman.
Genetic manipulation and construction of S. aureus
mutants

All extrachromosomal genetic constructs were created
in E. coli strain DH5a and then electroporated into the

sbnA::Tc and sbnB::Tc) were generated in strain RN6390
[21] and transduced into the Newman [22] background

EDDHA. Culture supernatants were harvested at 15 and
40 hours after initial culturing. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation and supernatants were lyophilized. The
freeze-dried supernatant was extracted with methanol
(one-fifth the original supernatant volume), and then
passed through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove
insoluble material followed by rotary evaporation. The
methanol-extracted material was solubilized in water to
5% of the original supernatant volume. The resulting
preparations were stored at -20°C.
Siderophore plate-disk diffusion assays

Siderophore growth promotion assays were performed
essentially as described [9]. Briefly, S. aureus strains
were seeded into TMS agar (1 × 104 cells ml-1) containing 10 μM EDDHA. Ten-μL aliquots of culture supernatant concentrates (as prepared above) were added to
sterile paper disks which were then placed onto the
TMS agar plates. Growth promotion was quantified by
measuring the diameter of growth around the disc after
36 h at 37°C.

Growth assays

S. aureus growth curves were generated using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Oy Growth Curves, Finland). Prior
to plate inoculation, strains were grown in glass tubes
for 12 h in TMS broth and then subcultured and grown
for 12 h in TMS broth containing 100 μM 2,2’-dipyridyl
(Sigma). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed
twice in sterile saline solution, and diluted 1:100 into
200- or 250-μl chelex-treated TMS. Amendments to
culture media included 10 μM human holotransferrin
(60% iron saturated) (Sigma), 5 mM L- or D-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Iris Biotech GmbH), 5 mM Lornithine (Sigma), 5 mM L-alanine, 5 mM O-acetyl-Lserine (Sigma), 5 mM L-proline (Sigma), or FeCl3 (at 10
or 100 μM). Appropriate antibiotics at the concentrations stated above were included to maintain plasmid
selection for complementation experiments. Plates were
incubated with constant shaking at medium amplitude.
Optical density (OD) was recorded every 15 min,
although for graphical clarity, figures have been edited
to display values every 2 h.
Siderophore quantification

Quantification of siderophore output from S. aureus
strains was performed by testing the iron-binding activity of culture supernatants, using a chrome azurol S
(CAS) shuttle solution as described previously [9,27].
Supernatant siderophore units were normalized to culture optical density.
Siderophore preparations

Siderophore concentrates were prepared by growing S.
aureus strains with aeration in TMS with 0.1 μM

Computer analyses

DNA sequence analysis, oligonucleotide primer design
and sequence alignments were performed either using
programs available through NCBI or using Vector NTI
Suite software package (Informax, Bethesda, MD).
Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 4.0.

Results
The S. aureus sbn operon contains genes predicted to
encode L-Dap biosynthesis enzymes

Original studies on the structural elucidation of staphyloferrin B revealed that it contained citric acid, a-ketoglutaric acid (a-KG), 1,2-diaminoethane (Dae), and L2,3-diaminopropionic acid (L-Dap) [15] (Figure 1A).
The unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid L-Dap serves
a critical role for the siderophore in terms of iron-coordination, since a carboxyl group oxygen and the nitrogen atom on the primary amine of L-Dap contribute
two of the six iron-ligands used to obtain the distorted
octahedral geometry in the ferric-staphyloferrin B complex [28] (Figure 1A). In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, L-Dap is twice incorporated into the staphyloferrin
B molecule, as the amine nucleophilic substrate for the
type A and type C NIS synthetases SbnE and SbnF,
respectively [17]. While SbnE condenses the first molecule of L-Dap to citrate, the action of the decarboxylase
SbnH removes the carboxyl group from the L-Dap residue to give rise to the Dae portion of staphyloferrin B
[17]. SbnF then condenses a terminal L-Dap onto a
citryl-Dae intermediate within the staphyloferrin B
structure [17]. Since L-Dap plays such a pivotal role in
iron-coordination for staphyloferrin B, and since the

products of these two genes are hypothesized to be an L-Dap
synthase. C) S. aureus mutants were grown in chelex 100-treated
TMS medium containing 10 μM holo-transferrin. In the Δsfa genetic
background, growth in this medium is dependent on the

the medium with FeCl3 allows for equivalent growth for all strains
(inset). D) The growth impairment exhibited by S. aureus sbnA or

biosynthesis of this siderophore requires two units of LDap per unit of staphyloferrin B, we were interested in
elucidating the genetic requirement for L-Dap biosynthesis in S. aureus.
S. aureus possesses a nine-gene sbn operon with an
adjacent sir operon; these operons encode proteins that
function in staphyloferrin B biosynthesis and transport,
respectively [17,23,29,30] (Figure 1B). SbnC, SbnE, SbnF,
and SbnH have been previously described as the core
enzymes involved in staphyloferrin B biosynthesis [17],
however the function of several gene products in the
sbn operon remain to be resolved. Since L-Dap is such a
critical component of staphyloferrin B, we reasoned that
the biosynthesis of this molecule must be intrinsic to
the sbn operon and that L-Dap biosynthesis is likely to
occur concurrently with the activity of the rest of the
Sbn enzymes. The first two genes in the sbn operon are
sbnA and sbnB (Figure 1B) which, through simple NCBI
BLAST searches, reveal that they share similarity with
cysteine synthases (Table 2) and L-ornithine cyclodeaminases (Table 3), respectively. However, further bioinformatic analyses suggested that genes homologous to
sbnA and sbnB fall under a new family of enzymes currently dubbed “PLP_SbnA_fam” and “dehyd_SbnB_fam”,
respectively, suggesting that they may carry out functions distinct from the above mentioned enzyme activities. Furthermore, close homologs of these two genes
consistently appear adjacent to one another or are
genetically fused into a single polypeptide (see Table 4)
with the presumed purpose of functioning together to
create a biosynthetic precursor. Of particular note are
other organisms, in addition to S. aureus, that are predicted to produce staphyloferrin B based on the similarity and gene organization of their biosynthetic operons
to that of the S. aureus sbn operon. Furthermore, genes
homologous to sbnA and sbnB are also found in biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for producing the characterized antibiotics zwittermicin A [31,32], viomycin
[18], and dapdiamides [33,34] that all contain L-Dap
(Table 2). In support of the presumed role of SbnA and
SbnB in L-Dap synthesis, Thomas and colleagues [18]
earlier proposed that the enzymes VioB (SbnA homologue) and VioK (SbnB homologue) were involved in production of L-Dap for viomycin synthesis. Therefore, it
appears that homologues of sbnA and sbnB are widely
distributed across biosynthetic gene clusters, whose
enzymes synthesize molecules for which L-Dap is featured as a structural component.
Both sbnA and sbnB are required for staphyloferrin B
biosynthesis in S. aureus

The goal of this study was to elucidate the requirement
for sbnA and sbnB in staphyloferrin B synthesis in S.
aureus, specifically with regard to their presumed role in

providing a source of L-Dap in the cell. Under iron-limiting growth conditions, S. aureus synthesizes two siderophores, named staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B.
As we have previously demonstrated, both siderophores
play a vital role in acquisition of iron from human holotransferrin [23]. Moreover, because of functional redundancy, when either the biosynthetic gene cluster for staphyloferrin A (sfa) or staphyloferrin B (sbn) is
inactivated alone (i.e. leaving the other intact in the S.
aureus cell), the resulting mutants do not display a
growth deficit phenotype when human holo-transferrin
is provided as the sole iron source. Therefore, the simplest manner in which to study the function of specific
genes within the sbn operon was to use a strain that
was deficient in its ability to synthesize staphyloferrin A;
as such, all experiments outlined in this study were performed in a S. aureus sfa deletion background.
With holo-transferrin as the sole iron source in the
bacterial growth medium, an S. aureus Δsfa mutant was
capable of growth to an optical density in excess of 1.0
within twenty-four hours (Figure 1C), in agreement with
earlier studies [23]. This growth was dependent on an
intact sbn gene cluster (and, hence, staphyloferrin B production) since the Δsfa Δsbn mutant did not grow above
an optical density of 0.1 over the same time period.
These growth kinetics were identical to those of S. aureus Δsfa sbnA::Tc and S. aureus Δsfa sbnB::Tc mutants
(Figure 1C), suggesting abrogation of staphyloferrin B
production in the absence of either sbnA or sbnB. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was used to

confirm that staphyloferrin B was present in the spent
culture supernatant of the Δsfa strain, yet was absent in
the spent culture supernatants of the S. aureus Δsfa
sbnA::Tc and S. aureus Δsfa sbnB::Tc strains (data not
shown). Importantly, the ESI-MS data were obtained
from cultures grown in TMS without added transferrin;
this medium is iron-limited but not so much as to completely abrogate growth of siderophore-deficient strains.
In order to ensure that the mutant growth deficiencies
were not due to pleiotropic effects as a result of the
introduction of alternate genetic mutations and that
growth, or lack thereof, is solely dependent on iron
accessibility, we supplemented each strain with FeCl3;
this resulted in the growth rescue of all strains (Figure
1C, inset). Moreover, mutants carrying insertions in
sbnA and sbnB were fully complemented by expressing
the wild-type version of the genes in trans; complemented strains were able to reach a final biomass comparable to the isogenic S. aureus Δsfa parental strain
(Figure 1D).
Supplementation of growth media with L-Dap bypasses
sbnA and sbnB mutations, allowing for restored
staphyloferrin B production in S. aureus

If SbnA and SbnB are involved in the production of LDap for staphyloferrin B biosynthesis, then the growth
deficit phenotype displayed by S. aureus Δsfa sbnA::Tc
and S. aureus Δsfa sbnB::Tc mutants (Figure 1) should
be restored when L-Dap is supplemented in the culture
medium, since presence of this molecule would bypass

*Indicates fusion of sbnA and sbnB homologs into one coding region
**Known gene required for staphyloferrin B biosynthesis (sbnH homolog) is missing from operon

the need for the activities of SbnA or SbnB in siderophore production. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 2A,
the iron-restricted growth of sbnA and sbnB mutants is
restored equivalent to that of staphyloferrin B-producing
cells when the culture medium of the sbnA and sbnB
mutants is supplemented with L-Dap, but not D-Dap.
This is in agreement with the fact that only the L-isomer of Dap is present in the final structure of the staphyloferrin B molecule [15,16,28]. Providing L-Dap to
the complete staphyloferrin-deficient mutant (Δsfa
Δsbn) did not allow iron-restricted growth, suggesting
that growth restoration of sbnA and sbnB mutants by LDap is a result of this precursor being incorporated into
a functional siderophore in the presence of other staphyloferrin B biosynthesis enzymes (Figure 2A). This
result shows that provision of L-Dap to either sbnA or
sbnB mutants allowed the bypass of the requirement for
these genes in staphyloferrin B biosynthesis, which
strongly supports the hypothesis that sbnA and sbnB
function together in a direct role in L-Dap synthesis.
Since the iron-restricted growth of S. aureus Δsfa
sbnA::Tc and S. aureus Δsfa sbnB::Tc mutants was
restored in the presence of L-Dap, we hypothesized that
this was due to the mutants’ renewed ability to synthesize staphyloferrin B. To verify this, we performed a
chrome azurol S (CAS) assay on concentrated and
methanol-extracted culture supernatants of several
mutant derivatives of S. aureus Δsfa (grown under iron
starvation) to quantify their siderophore production
(Figure 2B and 2C). Consistent with the growth phenotype illustrated in Figure 2A, amendment of growth
media with L-Dap allowed siderophore production by S.
aureus Δsfa sbnA::Tc and Δsfa sbnB::Tc (Figure 2C).

Interestingly, supplementation of the parental strain
(Δsfa) with L-Dap enhanced the level of staphyloferrin B
output by approximately five-fold (Figure 2C cf. Figure
2B).
As a final method to demonstrate that the siderophore
secreted by S. aureus Δsfa sbnA::Tc or Δsfa sbnB::Tc
mutants, in media supplemented with L-Dap, was
indeed staphyloferrin B, we performed plate-disk growth
promotion assays by spotting culture supernatants onto
sterile paper disks that were then placed onto TMS agar
seeded with various S. aureus siderophore transport
mutants (Figure 2D). Only culture supernatants from S.
aureus sbnA::Tc or sbnB::Tc mutants that were fed LDap promoted the growth of seeded S. aureus Δhts and
its isogenic wild-type strain, but strains containing a
mutation in the sirA gene (encoding the receptor lipoprotein for staphyloferrin B) did not grow. Moreover, no
growth-promoting siderophore was produced by sbnA
or sbnB mutants grown in media lacking L-Dap (Figure
2D). LC-ESI-MS/MS was used for confirmation of staphyloferrin B presence in methanol-extracted culture
supernatants of complemented mutants (data not
shown); spectra were as published previously [17].
When iron-restricted growth media were supplemented
with several other molecules that were predicted substrates or byproducts of an SbnA-SbnB reaction (e.g. Lornithine, L-proline, and O-acetyl-L-serine) according to
the models illustrated in Figure 3, scheme A, we noted
that none rescued the iron-restricted growth of sbnA or
sbnB mutants in the Δsfa background (Figure 2E). This
leads us to conclude that none of these molecules can
be modified into L-Dap by alternative S. aureus
enzymes.

Figure 3 Proposed schemes for SbnA- and SbnB-dependent synthesis of L-Dap. Scheme A is adapted from Thomas et al. [18] for which
the functions of SbnA and SbnB are analogous to the proposed functions VioB and VioK, respectively. The proposed functions of SbnA in
schemes B-D remain as a b-replacement enzyme while SbnB is proposed to be an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase of the indicated amino
acid.

Discussion
In this study we have demonstrated, through a series of
genetics-based experiments, that the S. aureus sbnA and
sbnB genes are necessary for staphyloferrin B production. We have also shown that S. aureus mutations in
sbnA and sbnB are fully complementable in trans by
both wild-type copies of each gene as well as through
feeding of the molecule L-Dap itself, leading to the
renewed production of the staphyloferrin B molecule.
The data support the contention that the enzymes SbnA
and SbnB function synergistically as a L-Dap synthase,
catalyzing the first committed biosynthetic step towards
staphyloferrin B synthesis in S. aureus. Overall, this is
the first study that simultaneously investigates the roles
of both genes encoding a cohesive L-Dap synthase.
The L-Dap molecule is a very unusual and rare amino
acid. It is non-proteinogenic but it is often found structurally associated with secondary metabolites such as
antibiotics (Table 4). To our knowledge, staphyloferrin
B represents the only characterized siderophore that
contains L-Dap as part of its structure (Figure 1A). The
experiment shown in Figure 2A also reinforces the fact
that only L-Dap, and not D-Dap, is incorporated into
staphyloferrin B. This is in agreement with initial structural elucidation studies [15], the high resolution crystal
structure of the siderophore [28], as well as enzymatic
recognition of L-Dap as a substrate by staphyloferrin B
NIS synthetases [17]. The only siderophore with a component similar to L-Dap in its structure is achromobactin from Pseudomonas syringae [35], which has an
overall structure and biosynthetic pathway that is very
similar to that of staphyloferrin B. In place of L-Dap,
achromobactin contains L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid
which is condensed onto a unit of citrate and a-KG at
both amino groups. L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid may be
synthesized by a putative aminotransferase (AcsF) that is
also encoded within the achromobactin biosynthetic
gene cluster. In the case of achromobactin, synthesis of
this diamino acid substrate requires only one enzyme as
opposed to the two enzymes required for synthesis of LDap. Biochemical characterization of AcsF, along with
its substrate specificity, awaits further investigation.
Why some siderophore biosynthetic systems have
evolved to select one diamino acid over another is an
intriguing biological question.
Based on bioinformatics and the emerging diversity of
members of the OCD enzyme family, the S. aureus
SbnB enzyme likely does not contribute to proline production, and hence would not recognize L-ornithine as
a substrate. In agreement with this hypothesis, under
the experimental conditions of Li et al. [36] in testing S.
aureus for proline synthesis, they could not attribute the
production of L-proline to SbnB, but rather L-proline

Page 10 of 12

production was solely dependent on the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase pathway; it should be noted, however, that these experiments did not test whether sbnB
was responsible for proline synthesis under low-iron
growth conditions and thus do not completely eliminate
the possibility that SbnB has OCD activity. The exact
biochemical reactions catalyzed by SbnA and SbnB (and
homologs) await detailed investigation.
SbnA and SbnB are likely functioning together as an
L-Dap synthase and perhaps the mechanism is that originally proposed by Thomas and colleagues [18] for
VioB and VioK with regards to viomycin biosynthesis in
Streptomyces (Figure 3, scheme A). In this scheme for
L-Dap synthesis, VioK (or SbnB) acts as an L-ornithine
cyclodeaminase (based on sequence similarity to an
OCD [1X7D]) that will convert L-Orn to L-Pro with the
concomitant release of ammonia. The released ammonia
is picked up by VioB (or SbnA) to be used as a nucleophile for the b-replacement reaction on (O-acetyl-) Lserine, thus generating L-Dap. The reaction catalyzed by
VioB (or SbnA) is modeled after homologous cysteine
synthases which use a sulfide group for b-replacement
reactions to generate cysteine [18]. Therefore, the action
of VioB, or SbnA, would appear to be an amidotransferase in this reaction scheme.
However, more recent bioinformatic and phylogenetic
analyses of these enzymes suggest that the mechanism
of L-Dap synthesis may be quite different from that just
described. This is especially true for SbnB, which is
more closely related to NAD + -dependent amino acid
dehydrogenases rather than characterized ornithine
cyclodeaminases. Therefore, this prompted us to propose several new mechanisms of L-Dap synthesis (Figure
3, Schemes B-D), emphasizing the role of SbnB as an
amino acid dehydrogenase, while SbnA would continue
to serve the function of a b-replacement enzyme or aminotransferase. As illustrated in Figure 3, scheme B, SbnB
acts as an NAD+-dependent L-Glu dehydrogenase that
converts L-Glu to 2-oxoglutarate (or a-KG). This reaction will release an ammonia molecule to be used by
SbnA in an identical manner to the second half of the
reaction proposed in scheme A. The reaction depicted
in scheme B is attractive since all products of this
mechanism can be funneled towards staphyloferrin B
biosynthesis (i.e. a-KG is a substrate for SbnC, while LDap is a substrate for SbnE and SbnF), as opposed to
scheme A where the generation of L-Pro serves no purpose in staphyloferrin B biosynthesis. In scheme C,
SbnA would act as the first enzyme in the pathway by
condensing L-Ser with L-Glu to form a larger intermediate consisting of an L-Ser-L-Glu conjugate. In
effect, SbnA would perform a b-replacement reaction on
L-Ser by displacing the hydroxyl group on L-Ser with L-

Beasley et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/199

Glu. Dehydrogenase activity provided by SbnB would
resolve and split the intermediate compound to give rise
to L-Dap and 2-oxoglutarate. As in scheme B, all products from this reaction are used in the biosynthesis of
staphyloferrin B. In scheme D, SbnB would serve as a 2Ser dehydrogenase, converting L-Ser to 2-amino-3-oxopropanoic acid, an intermediate that would be primed
for nucleophilic attack at the b-carbon by an ammonia
molecule derived from the aminotransferase activity of
SbnA. The source of this ammonia might be L-Glu, LAsp, or L-Ala, which are all common amino group
donors. In this scheme, if L-Glu is used as the amino
donor, 2-oxoglutarate is produced and would be a substrate for the SbnC synthetase.
Unlike the substrate uncertainty exhibited by SbnB,
the substrate for SbnA homologs have been defined
through precursor labeling studies [37,38]. Since, an
SbnA homologue is involved in L-Dap production for
viomycin (Table 4), then it is very likely that L-serine
(or the O-acetylated derivative) is also the substrate for
SbnA. Moreover, a recent study by Zhao et al. [32]
characterized the gene zwa5A, an SbnA homologue
(Table 4), and through genetic knockout of this gene in
Bacillus thuringiensis, confirmed that it is involved in
synthesizing L-Dap for the antibiotic zwittermicin A.
Similar to our experiments, these researchers were able
to restore the production of zwittermicin A in the
zwa5A mutant by providing exogenous L-Dap to the
culture media [32].
It is important to note that b-replacement reactions
involving ammonia as the nucleophile are rare. Only
recently was an L-2,3-diaminobutyric acid (L-Dab)
synthase studied that is involved in mureidomycin A production [39]. This enzyme, which catalyzes a similar reaction to the ones proposed for SbnA (Figure 3), will use LThr as the substrate (instead of L-Ser) and will displace
the b-hydroxyl group with an ammonia molecule to form
L-Dab. However, the source of the ammonia was not
described and thus it is assumed that this enzyme may
depend on cellular concentrations of free ammonia
rather then receiving the ammonia from a dedicated
dehydrogenase. The idea that an enzyme acquires free
ammonia within a cell is intriguing. Certainly, the rate of
diffusion of ammonia inside a cell can be a limiting factor
and this is perhaps why both halves of an L-Dap synthase
appear to be consistently co-expressed, and potentially
are intimately associated with one another such that liberated ammonia by the dehydrogenase unit can be properly channeled to the aminotransferase unit. This would
ensure catalytic efficiency and also assumes that extensive protein-protein interactions would occur between
the two enzymes. Certainly, this idea is supported by the
existence of single-polypeptide encoding genes found
within the P. syringae and Acidobacterium capsulatum

Page 11 of 12

genome, in which half of the polypeptide shares significant similarity with SbnA and the other half shares significant similarity with SbnB (Table 4).
It is interesting that supplementation of the S. aureus
culture medium with L-Dap enhanced staphyloferrin B
output in wildtype cells (Figure 2B cf. 2C), a phenomenon that has previously been observed [15]. It is tempting to speculate that L-Dap may be a critical molecule
in terms of regulating staphyloferrin B production or
that the presence of L-Dap is a signal for the organism
to commit to staphyloferrin B synthesis. At this time,
how such a signal may be transduced is unknown but
perhaps L-Dap can induce allosteric effects on certain
Sbn proteins that may, in turn, regulate staphyloferrin B
production. Interestingly, enhancement of end product
formation by L-Dap feeding has also been observed for
zwittermicin A production in B. thuringiensis [32].
The biochemical schemes for L-Dap synthesis, as
depicted in Figure 3, await experimentation with purified enzymes as well as screening with potential substrates, and these experiments are under investigation in
our laboratory. Certainly, the actual mechanism of LDap synthesis may not be restricted to those mechanisms outlined here, but at least these provide a starting
point towards the biochemical investigation of L-Dap
synthase enzymes in different bacteria. No matter the
mechanism, it is most surely to be novel. Regardless, the
studies here have demonstrated the essentiality of SbnA
and SbnB towards L-Dap synthesis in S. aureus, a nonproteinogenic amino acid component of staphyloferrin B
that is critical to the iron coordinating function of the
siderophore, as well as providing implications for the
role that L-Dap may play in regulating production of
the molecule.

Conclusions
Mutation of either sbnA or sbnB result in abrogation of
synthesis of staphyloferrin B, a siderophore that contributes to iron-restricted growth of S. aureus. The loss of
staphyloferrin B synthesis is due to an inability to
synthesize the unusual amino acid L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid which is an important, iron-liganding component of the siderophore structure. It is proposed that
SbnA and SbnB function together as an L-Dap synthase
in the S. aureus cell.
