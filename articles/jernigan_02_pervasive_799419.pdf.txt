Abstract
Background: The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature
because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows
on a given genome. Both the causes and the functional significance of this phenomenon could be
illuminated by determining if it persists on smaller scales. The profile is computed from the base
step "odds ratios" that compare dinucleotide frequencies to those expected under the assumption
of stochastic equilibrium (thorough shuffling). Analysis is carried out on 22 sequences, representing
19 species and comprised of about 53 million bases all together, to assess stability of the signature
in windows ranging in size from 50 kilobases down to 125 bases.
Results: Dinucleotide relative abundance distance from the global signature is computed locally
for all non-overlapping windows on each sequence. These distances are log-normally distributed
with nearly constant variance and with means that tend to zero slower than reciprocal square root
of window size. The mean distance within genomes is larger for protist, plant, and human
chromosomes, and smaller for archaea, bacteria, and yeast, for any window size.
Conclusions: The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on all scales considered in the
sequences (either genomes or chromosomes) that were scanned.

Background
Compositional heterogeneity pervades the genome on all
scales [1] and attempts to partition DNA sequences into
homogeneous segments give different results depending
on the method chosen, even for genomes as small as the
49 kilobases (kb) of bacteriophage lambda [2]. It therefore seems remarkable that dinucleotide relative abundance profiles exhibit local stability in the sense that,
when computed for any 50 kb window on a given microbial genome, the profile is about the same as if computed
globally from the bulk genomic DNA of the organism
[3,4]. The dinucleotide relative abundance profile, previously called the "general design [5]," can be viewed as a

"genomic signature" that reflects a "total net response to
selective pressure [6]." Yet the 50 kb window spans the
complete genome of bacteriophage lambda and hence it
would not be surprising to discover local instability in the
profile seen through smaller windows.
Bacterial genomes commonly exhibit an approximate balance between purine (A+G) and pyrimidine (C+T) fractions, and between amino (A+C) and keto (G+T)
fractions, when the whole leading strand is examined. Locally, however, these fractions fluctuate from their global
averages almost as dramatically as the strong (C+G) and
weak (A+T) fractions that do not show global balance. InPage 1 of 9

deed, these compositional biases, extending over hundreds of kilobases, are strongly correlated with the
direction of replication in some species [7]. Perhaps the
stability of the dinucleotide relative abundance profile in
50 kb and longer windows conceals highly variable behavior on a shorter scale. By analogy, the variability of the
profile within 50 kb windows could have as much functional significance as invariance between such windows.
The stability of the dinucleotide relative abundance profile could result from constraints on dinucleotide stacking
energy and DNA helicity, context-dependent mutation
pressures, and replication and repair mechanisms
[3,4,6,8]. To gauge the influence of these or other factors
in contributing to total net response, it again seems pertinent to ask whether stability persists on smaller scales
than 50 kb. If it is reasonable to suppose that signature
variation between species is due to differences in replication machinery, operating through local DNA structures
and base step conformational tendencies [9], then we may
expect to find stability on the scale of the machinery. For
example, the proximity of dinucleotide relative abundance profiles in two samples could reflect the similarity
of enzymes [10] that engage them in their replication
processes. When these samples come from the same genome, which encodes the same enzymes, a close proximity should be expected.
Replicational constraints that act on all parts of the genome could also manifest themselves in codon usage
preference. The genomic signature may be associated with
codon usage to the extent that it embodies these constraints. Given that the signature "pervades both coding
and noncoding DNA," its uniformity throughout the genome "cannot be explained by preferential codon usage
[9]." The converse proposition, that codon usage is explained by dinucleotide relative abundance, is hardly
more defensible, since dinucleotide frequencies do not
determine trinucleotide frequencies [11]. Yet the replicational constraints could be a common factor underlying
both phenomena. If the global signature pervades an
open reading frame (ORF), the trinucleotide frequencies
will to some extent express the signature as modulated by
the local composition. (Codon usage may exhibit more
diversity within genomes by virtue of its sensitivity to
composition.) This kind of association would be supported by discovery of signature stability in windows smaller
than the average ORF and negated by the breakdown of
signature stability below some window size that far exceeds the typical ORF length, unless protein coding sequences are less sensitive to local replicational constraints
than dinucleotide relative abundance [12].
Genomes are identifiable by their signatures and dissimilarity between signatures is used to estimate the evolu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/23

tionary distance between species [4,6]. If the imprint of
the global signature is locally pervasive, down to the scale
of the single gene or coding sequence, large deviations on
that scale could highlight segments introduced by recent
horizontal transfer from another species [13]. So-called
filtration methods, based on dissimilarity measures computed from dinucleotide counts, have been employed for
the alignment-free computation of evolutionary distances
between homologous sequences [14,15]. The "transition
matrix method" was a similar technique involving raw
counts of amino acid pairs in protein primary sequences
[16]. Phylogeny construction based on dinucleotide relative abundance distance ("delta-distance") would seem to
have a similar intent although its application has been to
whole genomes [9]. Mathematically, however, the use of
relative abundance instead of raw abundance (frequencies
or counts) is a subtle innovation that compensates for
compositional variation. This subtle change has a profound effect and is essential to achieving logical results
since whole genome comparisons based on raw abundance often fail to find a close proximity between closely
related species.
Can the same improvement be achieved by dinucleotide
relative abundance distance calculations in smaller windows? If so, a delta-scan of one bacterial genome could
detect outliers bearing the imprint of a host or foreign signature. Whether this is practical depends on how the variability of the intra-genomic delta-distance grows with
shrinking window size. Purely statistical considerations
will limit the detectability of small scale deviations. From
the investigations of Karlin et al [3,4,6,8,9,12,17] it is clear
that delta-distances between 50 kb and larger windows
show fluctuations that are small compared to distances
between closely related species.
Hypothesis formulation
The assessment of bias in dinucleotide relative abundance
begins with the "odds ratios" rxy = fxy/fxfy where fx denotes
the (normalized) frequency of nucleotide (base) x and fxy
is the frequency of dinucleotide (base step) xy in the leading strand. These ratios compare observed dinucleotide
frequencies to those expected from the base composition
alone under the assumption of statistical independence
(i.e., thorough shuffling of the sequence). When rxy is
greater (less) than one, xy is over(under)-represented. The
symmetrized version r*xy is computed from frequencies of
the sequence concatenated with its inverted complement.
The numbers {r*xy} comprise the dinucleotide relative
abundance profile [3–6].

The statistical problem is to test the hypotheses that patterns of dinucleotide over- and under-representation in a
given genome are invariant. Using symbol f for frequencies in windows, let g be used to represent the global fre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/23

quencies computed for a complete sequence (a genome or
chromosome). The hypothesis asserts that r*xy in any window is approximately equal to a constant. This constant is
the global signature c*xy = g*xy/g*xg*y.
Karlin, Landunga, and Blaisdell [8] assessed homogeneity
of the dinucleotide relative abundance profile through the
delta-distance δ* = (1/16) Σ |r*xy - c*xy|. They provided
standards for classifying δ* in 100 kb windows as follows:
"random" (0 < 1000δ* < 15), "very close" (15 < 1000δ* <
30), "close" (30 < 1000δ* < 45), "moderately related" (45
< 1000δ * < 65), and "distantly related" (65 < 1000δ * <
95). The upper limit of the "random" range, which typifies thoroughly shuffled sequences, scales as 1/√n, where
n is the number of bases in the window.
The local stability of rxy would be an ancillary result under
the assumption of a stationary stochastic process, since
then the frequencies converge in probability to fixed limits, fx → px and fxy/fx → pxy as n → ∞. The simplest case
would be a homogeneous Markov chain with base step
transition probabilities pxy and stationary base composition px. In this case the differences fx - px and fxy/fx - pxy tend
to zero as 1/√n and it is clear that rxy - pxy/py will vanish at
the same rate [18]. Moreover, the globally computed quotient cxy = gxy/gxgy would be a consistent estimate of pxy/py.

Thus the separate terms of Σ |rxy -cxy| tend to zero as 1/√n
and the same must obviously apply to δ*.
We start however with the understanding that the sequence is fundamentally nonstationary, exhibiting statistically significant variations in base frequencies between
non-overlapping windows [1,2]. Locally or globally estimated Markov models may describe it better than assuming that the bases are independent and identically
distributed [19] but they fail to reflect the salient features
of natural sequences [20]. For example, Robin and Daudin [21] compared the frequency of a specific motif in the
genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae to Markovian
predictions and found that the observed frequencies were
everywhere higher than predicted.
This point aside, the stationary Markov analogy provides
a useful benchmark in assessing local stability of the genomic signature. If nucleotide sequences behaved like
Markov chains, then δ*√n would not depend on n. We
will examine this scaled delta-distance δ*√n to see if it exhibits any trend. A decreasing ("super-Markov") trend
would imply that signature stability emerges as the scale
increases and could indicate the breakdown of stability
for some window size below 50 kb.

Scope of the investigation
This survey examines 22 sequences from 19 species and
17 genera. The sequences are listed in Table 1 along with
serial numbers (SN) and 4-letter abbreviations (Abbr).
Most of them have been previously studied and found to
show stability of the genomic signature in 50 kb windows
[9]. The shortest is the 580 kb complete genome of Mycoplasma genitalium. The longest complete sequence is the
7657 kb human chromosome XXII.

The selected sequences, which are not always complete genomes, fall into two main classes, being typically (1) the
chromosome that constitutes the largest single element in
a prokaryotic genome or (2) one of the chromosomes in
a eukaryotic genome. In the first case, for example, is the
Borrelia burgdorferi sequence that excludes 21 identified
plasmids. The second case is exemplified by Plasmodium
falciparum where chromosomes II and III are selected to
the exclusion of the other 12. Since our investigation focuses on scaling properties of the genomic signature, it is
appropriate to consider sequences comprised of many 50
kb contigs, assuming that variation between such contigs
is small compared to variation between species.
The present sample, which spans a wide range of G+C proportion, is hoped diverse enough that any consistent
trends and features in the statistical picture it produces
cannot be easily attributed to chance. A broader range of
sequences, including mitochondrial and large viral genomes, has been surveyed by Karlin et al [3,4,6,8,9,12,17]
using 50 kb and larger windows. This investigation, which
applies similar methodology to smaller window sizes,
concerns the intra-genomic homogeneity of dinucleotide
relative abundance, and inter-sequence distance calculations are beyond its scope.
Our use of nonoverlapping windows is consistent with
the methodology employed in prior studies using 50 kb
and longer windows. (Overlapping windows with a high
percentage overlap would be required to localize and sort
out the significance of nonconforming segments that
could possibly reflect a foreign signature.) Overlap would
introduce statistical dependence between successive windows and such dependence could only complicate the
analysis of variance within sequences. Window size was
varied by factors of approximately two, the specific values
being 50 kb, 25 kb, 10 kb, 5 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 500 b, 250 b,
and 125 b.

Results and discussion
Increasing trend in mean scaled delta-distance
Table 2 shows mean scaled delta-distance by sequence
(Abbr) and window size (n). Scaled delta-distance, defined above as δ*√n, is a statistical invariant for any
benchmark sequence generated by a Markov chain exhib-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/23

iting the same signature as the given sequence. Except for
the Borrelia burgdorferi sequence, the mean scaled deltadistance is increasing in window size for every sequence.
The lone exception is a drop, for B. burgdorferi, from
3.580 to 3.553, as window size increases from 10 kb to 25
kb.
The essentially increasing trend in δ*√n has an obvious
implication for the scalability of standard binning levels
used in classifying intra-genomic delta-distance [8]. These
levels cannot be re-scaled by the reciprocal square root of
window size without admitting that the profiles seen
through smaller windows are statistically closer to the global signature. The profiles seen through larger windows
obviously tend toward the signature but local fluctuations
tend to zero slower than 1/√n (i.e., the convergence rate is
"sub-Markov").
Quasi-stable hierarchy of mean scaled delta-distances
The rows of Table 2 are grouped as archaea (Aful, Mjan),
protist (Pfa2, Pfa3), yeast (Sc11, Sc15), plant (Ath4), human (Hs22), or bacteria (all 14 others). Rows are averaged
in groups and the results are plotted in Figure 1. Granted
that the curves for archaea and bacteria are almost indistinguishable, we see that ranking mean scaled delta distances by groups produces about the same result for every
window size. The one clear exception is the crossing of the
curves for plant (Arabidopsis thaliana, chromosome IV)
and human (chromosome XXII) between n = 2 kb and n
= 5 kb. Thus the view through 50 kb windows shows that
the imprint of the global signature is weaker in the latter;
but 2 kb and smaller windows show relatively clearer imprints in the human chromosome.
Normality and homoscedasticity of log delta
The increasing trend in all the curves of Figure 1 suggests
that local deviations from the global signature are better
described by a multiplicative error process (instead of additive). Therefore we examine the (natural) logarithms of
the delta-distances in windows and find that they are close
to normally distributed with nearly constant variance over
the range of window size. Mean values of -log(δ*) are
shown in Table 3 with corresponding standard deviations
in Table 4.

Each pair of corresponding cells in Tables 3 and 4 defines
a normal distribution with mean a variance determined
by a sample of observed delta-distances. Each sample is
subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of fit to the corresponding normal distribution [22]. (We generate a random sample of the same size as the observed sample from
a normal distribution with the same parameters. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is then invoked. The
null hypothesis is that the observed and simulated samples share a common underlying distribution.) P-values

Figure 1
Mean scaled delta-distance versus window size for six
subsets of the sequences. The mean intra-genomic deltadistance for windows of a given size on each sequence was
computed and scaled up by the square root of window size
to give the numbers shown in Table 1. Then the table is condensed by grouping its 22 rows into 6 subsets as defined in
the text. Each curve shows the group-wise average.

from the test, which measure support for the null hypothesis of normality, are shown in Table 5. The bottom row
of Table 5 counts (by window size) the number of times
the test accepts normality of log(δ*) at the 5% significance
level.
Delta-distances tend to fit the log-normal distribution better for window sizes 1 kb and larger. Rejection of log-normality for the smallest window sizes is to some extent a
consequence of increasing sample size. The apparent
goodness-of-fit actually gets better as window size decreases as illustrated in Figure 2 for three indicated window sizes on the Haemophilus influenzae sequence. (The
sample CDF approaches a smooth curve as window size
declines and the number of windows increases. The heavy
plotted points are from log-normal distribution functions
with means and variances of the corresponding samples.)
Sub-Markov convergence rate of mean log delta
Since δ*√n is essentially increasing in n, we infer that the
locally computed dinucleotide relative abundance converges to the global signature more slowly than the reciprocal square root of window size. The log-normality of the
intragenomic delta distance suggests a log-linear model of
the form log(δ*) = α - βlog(n) for intercept (α) and slope

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/23

Figure 2
Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of log
delta-distance computed from windows of three sizes
on theHaemophilus influenzae genome. The CDF gives
the fraction of windows in which log delta-distance did not
exceed the abscissa. The empirical CDFs are drawn with
connected line segments and they increase in smoothness
with the total number of windows. The discrete points
(squares) trace the CDFs of corresponding normal distributions having the same mean and variance as the three sets of
observations.

(β) coefficients that can be estimated for each sequence
(or group) by simple linear regression. Table 3, columns
10 and 11, give intercept and slope coefficients of least
squares fits to the scatter plots of mean log(δ *) versus
log(n). Column 12 gives the mean absolute residual
(MAR) to indicate the closeness of the straight line fit. All
estimated slope coefficients are greater than the benchmark value -1/2 implied by the Markovian analogy. Figure
3 shows least squares fits to log-log scatter plots obtained
by grouping rows of Table 3 (in the same as way described
above for going from Table 2 to Figure 1).
Weakly consistent patterns of intragenomic variability in
delta-distance
Residual accumulated delta-distance (RADD) is defined
as window size times the cumulative sum of terms δ*(t) mean(δ*), t = 1, 2, ..., T where t is the position index
(counted in windows from the 5' end) and T is the total
number of windows. Here mean(δ*) is just the average of
unscaled delta-distances in windows of size n. Since δ*(1)
+...+ δ*(T) = T mean(δ*), a plot of RADD versus t always
returns to zero. The RADD plot will superficially resemble

Figure 3
Mean log delta-distance versus window size for six
subsets of the sequences. The lines show simple linear
regressions of the mean log delta-distance on log window
size. The plotted points were obtained by grouping rows of
Table 3 as described in the text.

random walks obtained by integrating counts of purine
minus pyrimidine bases. Such "walking plots" are useful
in depicting long range compositional biases concomitant
to replication [7] and their self-similarity with respect to
re-scaling has been said to instantiate the "fractal geometry of nature [23,24]."
Here we use the RADD plot to examine how well deltadistances in smaller windows are smoothed by corresponding larger windows. For example, take a single 50 kb
window on the M. genitalium sequence, compute its deltadistance from the global signature, then divide it into 50
contiguous 1 kb windows and repeat the calculation for
each piece. Do the 50 delta-distances exhibit random fluctuations about the level indicated by the single larger window? If so, the patterns would be judged consistent, and
that result would typify a stationary process. Such consistency is only weakly evidenced In Figure 4, however, as
larger scales give rise to emergent trends. The same effect
is seen in Figure 5 where the 125 b and 1 kb traces track
each other closely but diverge from the other traces in the
central region.

Conclusions
The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on
all scales considered in the sequences that were scanned.
No lower bound can yet be placed on the local scale on

Figure 5

position for the Human chromosome XXII sequence.
The RADD is plotted against fractional position for each of
four indicated window sizes. The full horizontal scale is 7650

which the global signature is reflected. The inter-genomic
hierarchy of mean intra-genomic delta-distances is essentially preserved across the range of window sizes. Intra-genomic delta-distance is approximately log-normally
distributed (in windows down to 1 kb) and the variance
of log-delta is fairly uniform across the set of sequences.
Delta-distance tends to zero with increasing window size
but the rate of this convergence is significantly slower than
for simple random processes.

Methods
The sequences listed in Table 1 were downloaded from
the (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
GenBank [25] in FASTA format and saved as plain text
files. The last two columns of Table 1 provide GenBank accession numbers and approximate dates of the revisions
used in this analysis. The sequences, as text files, were
processed by routines written in SPlus, Version 4.5. The
texts were read in blocks (contigs) of 50 kb (when computing delta-distances in 50 kb and 25 kb windows) or 20
kb (for smaller windows). Counts of overlapping base
steps in windows were computed with the last base of one
window serving as the first base of the next. Thus the
number of base steps in a window is equal to the number
of bases (not one less). However, one base step was uncounted at the start of every block. Incomplete windows
in the last block were discarded and blocks past end-of-file
were ignored. Sometimes complete blocks near end-of-file
were omitted. With the exception of Arabidopsis thaliana,
chromosome IV, the total sequence lengths in kilobases are
listed in the fourth column (kb) of Table 1. All corresponding sample lengths are at least 96% of total length,
and most are close to 99%, when texts were read in 20 kb
blocks. For A. thaliana, however, the global signature was
computed from a scan of the 99% complete sequence; but
local delta-distances from the global signature were computed only for the first 50% of the complete sequence due
to computing difficulties. The 8750 kb length for this sequence in Table 1 is therefore about half the total bases in
the chromosome.
