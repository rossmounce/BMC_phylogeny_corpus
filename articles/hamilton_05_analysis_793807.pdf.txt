Abstract
Background: Linkage studies in autism have identified susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2q and
7q, regions containing the DLX1/2 and DLX5/6 bigene clusters. The DLX genes encode
homeodomain transcription factors that control craniofacial patterning and differentiation and
survival of forebrain inhibitory neurons. We investigated the role that sequence variants in DLX
genes play in autism by in-depth resequencing of these genes in 161 autism probands from the
AGRE collection.
Results: Sequencing of exons, exon/intron boundaries and known enhancers of DLX1, 2, 5 and 6
identified several nonsynonymous variants in DLX2 and DLX5 and a variant in a DLX5/6intragenic
enhancer. The nonsynonymous variants were detected in 4 of 95 families from which samples were
sequenced. Two of these four SNPs were not observed in 378 undiagnosed samples from North
American populations, while the remaining 2 were seen in one sample each.
Conclusion: Segregation of these variants in pedigrees did not generally support a contribution
to autism susceptibility by these genes, although functional analyses may provide insight into the
biological understanding of these important proteins.

Background
Autism is a severe heterogeneous neurobehavioral syndrome that becomes apparent in the first years of life [13] Autism is often viewed as a type of mental retardation,
as most autistics have IQs lower than 70. However, autism
is distinguished from other mental retardation syndromes
by disproportionately severe deficits in language and
social skills. Persons with some autistic features but with
preserved language are often referred to as having
Asperger's Syndrome [4].

There has been much interest and work investigating the
genetic basis of autism [5]. Twin studies have shown that
autism is a strongly inherited disorder [2,6,7], as monozygotic twins are concordant for this syndrome substantially
more frequently than are dizygotic twins. For reasons that
are not yet understood, autism affects boys about four
times more often than girls. Non-genetic etiological factors are under careful consideration [8], given the controversy over changing estimates of the incidence of autism
over the past decades [9].

Recently, we hypothesized that some forms of autism may
be due to a disproportionate high level of excitation (or
disproportionately weak inhibition) in neural circuits that
mediate language and social behaviors [10]; related models have also been postulated [11,12]. A "noisy" (hyperexcitable, poorly functionally differentiated) cortex is
inherently unstable, and susceptible to epilepsy, a common malady of autistic people [13]. Consistent with this
model, a subset of patients with a mutation of the Xlinked homeobox gene ARX have autistic features [14,15].
Analysis of the expression and function of murine Arx has
revealed that this transcription factor controls proliferation of cortical progenitor cells and it regulates the development of the basal ganglia and the tangentiallymigrating GABAergic neurons, derived from this region,
that become cortical local circuit neurons [16]. Furthermore, Arx is expressed in mature cortical local circuit neurons [16,17]. Arx expression in GABAergic neurons in the
basal ganglia and cortex could underlie the epilepsy and
movement disorders in humans bearing Arx mutations.
The highly conserved Dlx1, 2, 5 & 6 homeobox transcription factors also control the development of the basal ganglia and cortical local circuit neurons [18-23]. This gene
family regulates the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase [24,25] (and Cobos and Rubenstein, unpublished).
Furthermore, these genes control the expression of Arx in
cells derived from basal ganglia progenitor domains [17].
Finally, mice lacking Dlx1 have defects in subsets of cortical local circuit neurons that lead to their apoptosis and
subsequent onset of epilepsy [26]. Therefore, murine Dlx
genes have a central role in controlling the development
and function of forebrain GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons. The human DLX genes are organized as bigene clusters on chromosomes 2q31.1 (DLX1/2) and 7q21.3
(DLX5/6) and their expression is controlled by intra- and
extragenic enhancers [27-30] These genes are close to loci
that have been linked with autism (2q32, and 7q22-31)
[31-34].
In a genome scan using 152 affected sibling pairs, a
multipoint maximum lod score (MLS) of 3.74 was
reported near D2S2188 [31]. This region on chromosome
2 has also been reported to be linked to autism in one
study of 51 multiplex families [35], while other studies
show linkage slightly more telomeric to this region
[36,37]. Chromosome 7q, also an important region in
linkage studies of autism [38], contains DLX5 and DLX6.
The International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism
Consortium (IMGSAC) reported a single locus MLS of
2.93 in 83 sibling pairs at D7S477, some 4.1 Mb telomeric
to the DLX5/6 cluster on 7q22 [31]. When 152 sibling
pairs were analyzed, a multipoint MLS of 3.20 was calculated. An earlier IMGSAC study reported linkage ~35 Mb
telomeric to the DLX5/6 region [39].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

Converging biological and genetic evidence thus suggest a
role for DLX proteins in autism. While previous studies
have failed to identify non-synonymous mutations in
DLX1 and DLX2 [32], or close linkage of a polymorphism
in DLX6 in autistic patients [40], we sequenced the exons,
exon/intron boundaries, and known regulatory elements
of the DLX1/2 and DLX5/6 genes in 161 autism probands
and 58 non-autistic siblings collected as part of the
Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) [41], an initiative coordinated by Cure Autism Now (CAN). We identified three non-synonymous variants in DLX2 and two
non-synonymous variants in DLX5 that were either very
rare or not present in other populations. A number of
other SNPs were identified in all four genes.

Results
We resequenced the coding regions (total 3,153 bp, mean
263 bp/coding region, range 82–400 bp) and flanking
non-coding regions (total 3831 bp, mean 319 bp/noncoding region, range 176–755 bp) of human DLX1,
DLX2, DLX5, and DLX6. Additionally, we resequenced
2,679 bp of the regions between each bigene cluster
known to contain highly conserved tissue specific enhancers [28]. Finally, we sequenced 1,372 bp of an upstream
regulatory element (URE2) located ~12 kb upstream of
DLX1 (Ghanem and Ekker, unpublished observations).
The sample consisted of 161 autism probands and 58
non-autistic siblings obtained from AGRE, for a total of
2.08 Mb of sequence. The DNA variants discovered are
summarized in Table 1. The relative location of each variant within the DLX1/2 and DLX5/6 clusters is depicted in
Figure 1. Variants are referred to by our simple name (e.g.,
DLX2 SNP-1) for the purpose of clarity within this manuscript, while technically accurate nomenclature [42,43] or
dbSNP rs#, if available, are also referenced in Table 1.
Allele frequencies for these variants are detailed in Additional File 2. Thirty-three variants were observed, consisting of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
two insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Coding region
variants consisted of three synonymous SNPs (one in
DLX2, two in DLX5) and four non-synonymous SNPs
(two in DLX2, two in DLX5). Additionally, an in-frame
insertion of AGC in exon 1 of DLX2 leads to the insertion
of an additional serine after serine 46, lengthening a polyserine stretch from six to seven residues. DLX1 and DLX6
did not have any coding region variants in this study. One
SNP each in DLX1 and DLX2, as well as two SNPs in
DLX6, have been previously deposited in dbSNP. Interestingly, DNA variants were ~2.3 fold less common in the
four DLX1/2 and DLX5/6 intergenic enhancers and DLX1/
2 URE2. For 33 of 34 variants, for which corresponding
chimpanzee genomic sequence was available, the major
human allele matched the chimpanzee allele. For the single exception, in the brain specific DLX1/2 intergenic

observed none of three SNPs in DLX1 and all three SNPs
in DLX2 observed in a recent resequencing effort in 48
autism probands [32].
We focused on the non-synonymous SNPs and the DLX2
serine insertion for further analysis given the plausibility
of the functional significance of these amino acid changes.
The DLX2 InDel-1 was observed on 3 autism chromo-

somes. DLX2 SNPs-2 and 6 and DLX5 SNP-6 were each

observed on 4 chromosomes. These observations result in
allele frequencies of 0.009, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, and
0.012, respectively, in our autism sample. We compared
the allele frequencies for each of these five observed DLX2
and DLX5 variants in the AGRE sample with the frequency
of these DLX variants in a different population. For this
purpose we sequenced 188 DNAs from the Coriell DNA
Polymorphism Discovery Resource (PDR). This popula-

tion is not phenotypically defined, but does represent a
diverse array of populations for the detection of uncommon DNA polymorphisms. An additional two SNPs
(SNPs 3 and 4) in DLX5 were observed in the PDR sample
as part of this effort, but not in the autistic sample or the
non-autistic siblings (Additional File 2). Additionally, we
genotyped the four non-synonymous SNPs in 95 Caucasian and 95 African-American samples, also obtained
from the Coriell Institute. No heterozygous genotypes
were seen for SNPs 2 and 6 of DLX2. For SNPs 6 and 7 of
DLX5, single heterozygous samples were seen, with both
occurring in the Caucasian sample. Inspection of this data
indicates that allele frequencies for the 4 protein-changing
variants did not differ between autistic probands and their

In general, the variants were uncommon. Fifteen were
observed only once in the autism probands. Ten were seen
in 2–4 autistic individuals. Four of the variants were more
common in the autism probands, with minor allele frequencies ranging between 3.4% and 46.5%.

susceptibility variants. DLX2 InDel-1 and DLX2 SNPs-2
and DLX5 SNP-6 are found in affected and unaffected siblings within the same pedigrees. The minor variant for
DLX2 SNP-6, which was also seen in the Caucasian panel,
is introduced to one of two affected cousins by a father
who is not related by blood to the second cousin. SNP-7
in DLX5, which predicts a substitution of Arginine for Serine at position 234, was seen in 3 pedigrees (Additional
File 3, figure 1e), but also in the PDR and Caucasian panels. Four autism probands and one sibling diagnosed as
broad-spectrum autism were heterozygous for this SNP.
Two normal siblings and one autistic proband were
homozygous for the wild type allele. It is transmitted to
both affected siblings in two families, and to an affected
sibling and unaffected sibling in a third. The rich phenotypic data collected by AGRE provided an opportunity to
assess any relationship between phenotype and the variants described above. The average non-verbal IQ for all
affected persons in the pedigrees in which the four nonsynonymous SNPs occurred was 96.5. The two lowest
scores, 68 and 85, occurred in two sibs (one with autism,
the other with "not quite autism") who both were heterozygous for the DLX2 Serine insertion/deletion and both
had early trigonocephaly which normalized. The most
notable observation is with family AU0028, in which a
heterozygous mother transmits the variant DLX5 SNP-7 to
one of her two affected children. Both children have medical histories positive for generalized tonic-clonic seizures,
although only the heterozygous child, required medication treatment. Both children also exhibited obsessivecompulsive disroder and attention deficity hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) symptoms, although only the heterozygous child received an ADHD diagnosis. The child heterozygous for the variant also exhibited failure to thrive
and an early gait abnormality, which resolved. Given the
discordance between genotypes of the affected siblings, it
is hard to argue for the role of the DLX5 variant in these
specific phenotypes.
We investigated the evolutionary conservation of this particular amino acid change. As shown in Additional File 4,
the Serine at position 234 in humans is conserved in two
other mammals and one amphibian, and is substituted
with Glycine in one bird species. Phylogenetic analysis
shows close DLX5 homology among six vertebrate species, particularly among mammals. Similarly, the Serine at
position 229 [which is substituted with Proline (SNP-6)]
is conserved among all species examined, except for
zebrafish, where the residue is Proline.

Discussion
In the present report, we focused on the DLX bigene clusters given their importance in forebrain development
[18,25] and potential neurophysiological processes
underlying autism [10]. We sequenced the coding regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

and flanking non-coding regions for DLX1, DLX2, DLX5,
and DLX6 in 161 autistic probands and 58 non-autistic
siblings. We also sequenced four intergenic enhancers
(two each between each cluster [28,30]) and an enhancer
sequence ~13 kb upstream of DLX1 (Ghanem and Ekker,
unpublished observations). In the gene regions, we identified 28 variants, four of which were previously deposited
in public SNP databases. We found five variants that are
predicted to change or insert an amino acid in the protein
in DLX2 and DLX5. Three synonymous SNPs were also
found in these genes. Interestingly, no coding sequence
variants, synonymous or non-synonymous, were seen in
DLX1 or DLX6. The low frequency of the non-synonymous variants preclude meaningful assessment of correlation between variant and disease in the families analyzed.
For example, SNP-2 in DLX2 (Glu→Lys), SNP-6 in DLX2
(Ala→Thr), and SNP-6 in DLX5 (Ser→Pro) were each seen
in single pedigrees (Additional File 1). In all three cases,
one affected offspring in the pedigree has the variant,
while either a second affected member does not, or a nonaffected sibling also has the variant. The insertion of Serine residue between Serine 36 and Leucine 47 in DLX2
(InDel-1) occurred in three families, but occurred equally
as frequently in autistic individuals as in non-autistic siblings, and was seen in 12 of 376 chromosomes in the polymorphism discovery sample. Interestingly, mouse and
rat show tri-peptide insertions (Asn-Ser-Ser and Asn-SerAsn, respectively) at this site when compared to human
and chimp sequence. Finally, a variant predicting a serine
to arginine change in DLX5 (SNP-7), was seen in three
pedigrees. In two pedigrees, each containing three offspring, two affected individuals were heterozygous for the
variant, while a non-autistic sibling was homozygous for
the wild type allele. In the third pedigree containing an
affected sibling pair, one individual was heterozygous and
the other was homozygous for the wild type allele. This
variant was seen in one of 374 chromosomes in the polymorphism discovery sample, as well as in one of 380
chromosomes from the human variation panel samples.
The non-synonymous changes from SNPs-2 and 6 in
DLX2 and SNP-6 in DLX5 were not seen in 376 polymorphism discovery chromosomes or in the human variation
panels. Our study design, involving resequencing of DLX
family genes in autistic probands, has identified potentially interesting variants within these genes, but cannot
provide statistically meaningful inferences about the
effect on populations given our ascertainment scheme
using non-independent probands from multiplex families
and a rather small number of non-affected siblings.
Given the location of DLX1/2 and Dlx5/6 in relation to
autism linkage intervals, other groups have examined
whether DNA variants in these genes are significantly
associated with autism. The IMGSAC consortium conducted a sequence survey of DLX1 and DLX2 in 48 autistic

probands [32], which identified three variants in DLX1
that were not detected in our much larger sample and
three of the DLX2 variants seen in our sample. One explanation for the non-overlap in findings is the low allele frequency of most variants found in both studies. For
example, our SNP-1 in DLX1 was in a region also
sequenced by the IMGSAC group, but our allele frequency
was 0.2%, making it highly unlikely that it would be
detected by assaying 96 chromosomes [32]. The high frequency SNPs-1 and 4 occurred in both samples. Another
reason may be the origin of samples. The AGRE samples
are predominantly of U.S. origin [41], while the IMGSAC
samples are from a variety of geographically diverse countries [39], raising the possibility of population specific variants. This is particularly the case with rare variants, which
are less likely to be shared across populations. Finally, differences in coverage of the gene (coding and non-coding
regions), depth of coverage (i.e., sample size), or variant
detection technology (e.g., direct sequencing in this
report, versus variant detection with denaturing high performance liquid chromatography followed by direct
sequencing by Bacchelli et al.) may explain the discrepancy in variants described. For example, our DLX1 SNPs2 and 3 lie outside of the region assayed by IMGSAC.
In another recent study in 99 AGRE pedigrees and 308
other pedigrees, two SNPs in DLX2 were investigated [44].
One of these, rs2228184, corresponding to our DLX2
SNP-4, a synonymous coding sequence variant, showed
marginal association to autism. This common variant was
equally common in autistic probands and their unaffected
siblings in our study (Additional File 2). The second SNP
in the study by Rabionet et al., which was not associated
with autism, occurs outside of the region we sequenced.
These published data and our own do not provide support
for the possibility that common variation in the DLX loci
is associated with autism.
Another study focusing on DLX6 reported the existence of
a CAG repeat in exon 1 of DLX6 after assaying 90 Caucasian samples [45]. Although we sequenced the same
region, we did not detect this variation. In any case, the
uncommon nature of the DLX variants reported here,
even in aggregate, are unlikely to provide the basis for any
linkage signal in the DLX gene clusters on chromosomes
2 and 7.
A striking observation in our data was the prominent lack
of sequence diversity in the five non-coding regions we
investigated. In the 4,000 bp encompassing the four intergenic enhancers and DLX1/2 upstream regulatory element, we found only seven variants. However, given the
sequence conservation of these functional elements [28],
this result is not surprising. Indeed, three of the four intergenic elements are included in 481 genomic segments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

greater than 200 bp with 100% conservation of human
sequence with mouse and rat [46]. In other words, 0.6%
of known ultraconserved sequences can be found in the
0.001% of the genome representing the DLX1/2 and
DLX5/6 clusters. These deeply conserved sequences that
were not exonic were significantly enriched near genes
involved with transcriptional regulation, and in particular, those with Homeobox domains (p < 10-14) [46].
Of the variants identified, eight occurred in the coding
regions of DLX2 and DLX5. The four variants that change
the identity of an amino acid are non-conservative modifications: DLX2 SNP-2 (Glutamic acid to Lysine), DLX2
SNP-6 (Alanine to Threonine), DLX5 SNP-6 (Serine to
Proline), and DLX5 SNP-7 (Serine to Arginine). In both
DLX2 and DLX5, amino acid substitutions lie in conserved regions of the proteins. DLX2 SNP-2 is just N-terminal of the homeodomain in a region conserved among
the human DLX2,3,5 subgroup. This DLX2 residue is conserved between human and chimp, dog, rat, and mouse,
and fugu, while chicken, African clawed frog, and
zebrafish contain the conservative Aspartic acid at the
same position. The amino acids changed by DLX2 SNP-6,
DLX5 SNP-6 and DLX5 SNP-7 are adjacent to a Prolinerich domain C-terminal to the homeodomain. The amino
acids substituted by DLX5 SNP-6 and SNP-7 are invariant
in 5 mammal species, chicken (except for the Serine
changed to Arginine by SNP-7), and frog. DLX2 InDel-1
leads to the insertion of seventh Serine residue into a six
residue polyserine tract within the conserved DLX2,3,5
DllA domain [21,47]. The functional significance of such
a change is unknown.
The functional significance of the three synonymous SNPs
(DLX2 SNP-4, DLX5 SNP-1 and DLX5 SNP-2) is uncertain, but cannot be summarily dismissed. For example,
such "silent" variants can alter binding sites (exonic splice
enhancers, ESE) for proteins involved in RNA splicing
[48]. Using ESEfinder, a web-based application designed
to analyze exonic sequences to identify potential ESEs
responsive to the human SR proteins [49], each of these
three variants alter the predicted strength or presence of
recognition sites for one or more of several highly conserved and structurally related splicing factors termed Serine/Arginine-rich (SR) proteins (data not shown). For
instance, the C to T substitution for DLX5 SNP-2 synonymous change abolishes binding sites for two of three SR
proteins located in the region surrounding the SNP. The
functional significance of this in silico observation is
unknown, but highlights the potential importance of
DNA variation that does not necessarily alter the primary
structure or proteins. As is always the case with the analysis of rare variants, until the functionality of these variants
is demonstrated, either through statistical differences in
allele frequencies at the population level or through direct

functional studies, these variants should not be considered disease mutations.
While the identification of variants that generate non-conserved amino acid changes in DLX2 and DLX5 in autistic
people suggests that the DLX genes could contribute to
autism susceptibility, there are limitations to our study.
First the identified DLX variants identified here are rare
variants that could be expected to naturally occur across
the human population. While this is a possibility given
the low likelihood that any random gene is an autism susceptibility locus [50], we believe that biological and
genetic linkage data elevate the a priori probability that the
DLX genes analyzed here may be autism genes. Furthermore, the nature of the amino acid changes suggests that
they could alter the function of the DLX proteins,
although direct demonstration of this is currently lacking.
A second limitation is that the rarity of the DLX variants
precludes the possibility that they account for a significant
portion of the genetic susceptibility to autism. A further
weakness is that our study did not allow the large-scale
population-based case control design that would allow a
better estimation of the probability that these variants
contribute to causing autism. A third limitation involves
the use of unaffected siblings in our mutation screen.
These siblings were rigorously phenotyped, but not having clinical autism does not rule out the possibility that
they have milder traits representing aspects of the autism
phenotype. Thus, it is possible that variants shared by
affected and "unaffected" siblings may be functionally significant. In terms of co-occurring medical conditions, we
found no evidence for such in five families segregating
non-synonymous amino acid variants. A fourth limitation
is that the population sample we used to compare the
allele frequencies of the autism variants with a "normal"
population was not optimal. We used the DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource sample, which is designed to
mirror the sequence diversity of the human population.
While this sample allowed us to examine a cross section
of global genetic diversity, the use of this sample introduces two major limitations for the interpretation of our
data. One is the lack of knowledge of phenotypes in the
PDR and human variation samples raises the possibility
that we may falsely conclude that a variant seen both in
autistic probands and the Coriell samples is not involved
with autism when in fact the Coriell samples with the variant unbeknownst to us may have autism or a related phenotype. The second involves the relative enrichment of
the PDR sample for non-Caucasian samples when compared to our autism sample, which is predominantly Caucasian. This under-sampling of Caucasians (and
consequent lack of power to detect rare variants) in the
PDR sample may cause us to falsely attribute a rare variant
as autism-related, when it may in reality be merely Caucasian-specific. This may indeed be the case for the two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

DLX5 non-synonymous variants, which were not seen in
the PDR sample, but were seen in the Caucasian panel.
Thus by including the Caucasian and African-American
human variation panels, we have observed that the variants may be Caucasian-specific, albeit at low allele frequencies.
Despite the caveats described above, we suggest that the
non-synonymous DLX SNPs could contribute to autism
susceptibility for several reasons. Mice lacking DLX1 have
epilepsy [26], a common feature in autistic patients. Heterozygosity of transcription factor mutations is wellknown to cause human disease [51]. In mice the dosage of
the DLX genes is known to be important in controlling the
differentiation of forebrain GABAergic neurons and morphogenesis of craniofacial structures, including the middle and inner ear. Indeed, heterozygosity of DLX2 alters
morphogenesis of the skull (Depew and Rubenstein,
unpublished), although it is uncertain whether heterozygosity of a DLX gene alters brain function. Given recent
evidence that the DLX5 locus is partially imprinted in
humans [52], heterozygosity for DLX5 alleles could have
profound ramifications. In our own pedigrees, we note
that two of three pedigrees segregating the DLX5 non-synonymous SNP-7 show maternal transmission, while the
single DLX5 SNP-6 pedigree showed paternal transmission (Additional File 3). Increases in Dlx5 expression have
been found in mice lacking MECP2 (the Rett Syndrome
gene), which are associated with alterations in long-range
chromatin organization [53]. Therefore, several recent
findings are increasing the likelihood that changes in DLX
function/expression are involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.
The fact that 4.4% of autistic probands had non-synonymous DLX2 and DLX5 variants (5% when including the
DLX5/6 intergenic enhancer variant) could reflect the
multifactorial etiology of autism. Finally, perhaps the variants in DLX2, DLX5 and ARX [16], all of which alter the
development of forebrain GABAergic neurons [18-25], are
providing a clue that an increase in the ratio of excitation/
inhibition underlies some forms of autism [10]. Furthermore, it suggests that one should study other genes within
genetic pathways that control the ratio of excitation/inhibition in neural circuits that regulate cognition, memory
and emotion [10].

Conclusion
We carried out in depth resequencing of the exons, exon/
intron boundaries and known enhancers of the human
homeobox genes DLX1, 2, 5 and 6 and identified four
nonsynonymous variants in DLX2 and DLX5 in 4% of
families tested. We also observed a variant of unknown
significance in the highly conserved DLX5/6intragenic
enhancer. Without a larger population controlled for phe-

notype, we cannot assert that these variants are more common in autism. While it is possible that these potentially
functional rare variants may alter DLX gene function, our
observations do not support a significant contribution to
autism susceptibility. More detailed functional analysis or
population analysis (e.g., more comprehensive SNP genotyping performed on a massively large trio sample with
statistical evidence for genetic association for some of the
identified variants) is needed before these variants in the
DLX genes can be connected to autism.

Methods
Description of sample
Autism sample details: We used 161 autism probands and
58 non-autistic siblings from 95 families in the Autism
Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection [41]. The
phenotypic characterization is comprised of the Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), a semi-structured
clinical instrument for assessing autism [54] based on
DSM-IV criteria. In addition, AGRE assigns the phenotypes of Not Quite Autism (NQA) and Broad Spectrum.
The former identifies individuals who are no more ≤1
point from meeting autism criteria on any or all of the 3
content domains (i.e., social, communication, and/or
behavior); or, individuals who meet criteria on all 3 content domains, but do not meet criteria on the age of onset
domain. Broad Spectrum characterizes persons who show
patterns of impairment along the spectrum of pervasive
developmental disorders, comprising individuals with
mild to severe impairment. Details regarding the interview process and consent are available from the AGRE
web site http://www.agre.org. Permission to access the
AGRE sample and phenotypic data was obtained. The selfreported ethnicities of the pedigrees are: 68 Caucasian, 16
unknown, 7 mixed parentage, 2 African-American, and 2
Asian-American. In general, samples were chosen in
which there were >1 affected person per pedigree. Subjects
were chosen blinded to clinical data, including molecular
data, beyond the primary phenotype. At the cost of not
detecting an unknown number of additional variants, we
chose to sequence more than one autism proband from
many of the families as a way of more rapidly identifying
variants that are segregating with disease in the families.
This does not allow direct comparison with the undiagnosed populations described in the following section as
one would see in a case-control association study, which
was not the design for this study. The correlated genotypes
within families would inflate estimates of the allele frequencies of discovered variants if compared to independent controls. Although we do not formally test for
differences in allele frequencies, this could be done by
randomly choosing a proband from families with more
than one proband for any statistical test.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

Undiagnosed population sample details: The prevalence
of DNA variations detected in the autism sample was
assayed in several populations chosen for representation
of the major populations of humans. The DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource (PDR) sample set, obtained
from the Coriell Institute, contains samples from United
States residents who have ancestors from the major geographic regions of the world: Europe, Africa, the Americas,
and Asia. The European-American group includes nonHispanic whites; the African-American group includes
non-Hispanic blacks; the Americas group includes Mexican-Americans and Native Americans; and the AsianAmerican group includes individuals whose ancestors
came from several countries in East and South Asia. We
used 188 of the 450 available samples. Additionally, we
used 95 Caucasian and 95 African-American samples
from the Coriell Human Variation Panels, which do not
overlap with the PDR collection.
Sequence analysis
Sequencing of DLX genes was based on gene structure
information provided by GenBank accessions AY257976
(DLX1), NM_004405 (DLX2), NM_005221 (DLX5), and
NM_005222 (DLX6). Target sequence for the DLX1/2 and
DLX5/6 intergenic enhancers was identified from consensus sequence data [28,30]. Genomic context and intron/
exon boundaries were provided by the UCSC (http://
genome.ucsc.edu, July 2003, hg16, NCBI Build 34) and
ENSEMBL
(http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/,
February 2004, v19.34b.2) genome browsers.

Sequences were uploaded into VectorNTI 8 (InforMax,
Frederick, Maryland) and PCR primers were designed
using Primer3 with the human repeat mispriming library
[55]. Primers, primer concentrations, and PCR conditions
are listed in Additional File 1. All liquid handling was carried out on a TECAN Genesis robot (TECAN-US, Research
Triangle Park, NC). PCR reaction volumes were 10 µl,
using one of two PCR reagents. The first was Platinum Taq
polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing 10 ng
DNA template, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 8.4), 200
uM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM Betaine, and 0.25
units Platinum Taq DNA polymerase. The second was
with AmpliTaq Gold, containing 10 ng DNA template,
and 5 µl of the 2× AmpliTaq Gold Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers were added at the
concentrations listed in Additional File 1. Reactions were
cycled in 96 well GeneAmp 9700 PCR machines (Applied
Biosystems). All amplicons could be amplified with one
of two protocols. A "short touchdown" protocol involved
5 minutes at 95°C, followed by 10 cycles of 94°C (0:20),
61°C (0:20, decreasing 0.5°C every cycle), and 72°C
(0:45), then followed by 35 cycles of 94°C (0:20), 56°C
(0:20), and 72°C (0:45), followed by 10 minutes at 72°C.
A "long touchdown" procedure involved 5 minutes at

95°C, followed by 14 cycles of 94°C (0:20), 63°C (0:20,
decreasing 0.5°C every cycle), and 72°C (0:45), then followed by 35 cycles of 94°C (0:20), 56°C (0:20), and
72°C (0:45), followed by 10 minutes at 72°C. Excess PCR
primers and nucleotides were removed by adding a 2 µl
solution containing 1 unit each of shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I and incubating at 37°C for 1
hour, followed by denaturation of the enzymes by incubation 90°C for 15 minutes. Sequencing was carried out in
5 µl reactions in a 384 well GeneAmp 9700 PCR machine
using the BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems) containing 400 nM sequencing
primer, 1 µl PCR template, 0.25 ul dye terminators, and
0.875 µl 5× sequencing buffer. Reactions were cycled by
running at 96°C for one minute, followed by 25 cycles of
96°C (0:10), 50°C (0:05), and 60°C (4:00). Unincorporated dye terminators and residual salts were removed by
use of the Montáge SEQ96 Sequencing Reaction Cleanup
Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples were electrophoresed on 3700 or 3730xl DNA Analyzer capillary electrophoresis platforms (Applied Biosystems). Bases were
called using the ABI KB Basecaller. Sequencher (Gene
Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to edit the called bases.
All variants will be submitted to dbSNP at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information and the AGRE web
site upon acceptance of this manuscript for publication.
Predicted protein alignments were carried out in the
AlignX utility in VectorNTI, with construction of phylogenetic trees using the neighbor joining method [56].
SNP genotyping
For SNPs 2 and 6 in DLX2 and SNPs 6 and 7 of DLX5, we
designed genotyping assays to determine the presence of
these SNPs in the Caucasian and African-American
Human Variation Panels. For SNPs 2 and 6 in DLX2 and
SNP 7 in DLX5, custom 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays were
designed by and purchased from Applied Biosystems
(primers are listed in Additional File 1). Genotyping was
performed by cycling a 40-fold dilution of the primer/
probe mix with 2× Universal MasterMix and 20 ng of
genomic template in a final reaction volume of 5 µl. Samples were incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes, and then
were cycled 40 times at 92°C for 15 seconds followed by
60°C for 1 minute. Samples were then brought to room
temperature before fluorescence was read on an Applied
Biosystems 7900 Sequence Detection System. DLX5 SNP6 was genotyped using fluorescence polarization detection of template-directed dye terminator incorporation
(FP-TDI), an assay based on single base extension [57].
Briefly, the first step involves polymerase chain reactions
(PCR) of 5 microliters (µl) containing 500 nM of the forward and reverse primers (Additional File 1), 20 ng
genomic DNA template, 200 µM dNTPs (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 1 M anhydrous betaine (Acros Organics, Geel,
Belgium), 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/52

MgCl2, and 0.25 units Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All primers and TDI probes
were designed using Primer3 software and were manufactured by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) [55]. Cycling conditions were: 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by a touchdown
protocol of 10 cycles 94°C for 20 seconds, then 61°C for
20 seconds (with -0.5°C increments) and 72°C for 45 seconds, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds, 56°C
for 20 seconds, 72°C for 45 seconds, with a subsequent
10 minute incubation at 72°C. Primers and dNTPs were
degraded by addition of a 2 µl solution of E. coli exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase, with cycling of
37°C for 90 minutes with inactivation at 95°C for 15
minutes. The final step was the addition of a 13 µl solution containing a final concentration of 0.38 µM TDI
probe, 2 µl of 10× TDI Reaction Buffer, 0.5 µl of AcycloTerminator Mix (containing R110 and TAMRA labeled AcycloTerminators, corresponding to the polymorphic base),
and 0.025 µl of AcycloPol DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer). This mixture was cycled at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 20 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec and 55°C for 30 sec.
Genotypes were read on a Victor 2 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Positive controls for both TaqMan and FP-TDI
consisted of sequence-verified samples from the initial
sequencing survey.

Allele frequencies of variants detected by resequencing in four DLX genes
and DLX1/2 intergenic enhancers. The allele frequency of the minor allele
is presented for 161 autism probands (autism sample), 58 normal siblings
of 58 autism probands (non-autism sample), and 188 samples from the
NIGMS/NHGRI Polymorphism Discovery Resource (PDR sample).
Selected variants were assayed in the PD sample, as described in the text.
Variants from other autism studies are designated in the Variant column,
with numbers of samples tested shown in the Autism Sample column. *,
Bacchelli et al., 2003. [reference [32] **, Nabi et al., 2003 [reference
[40]. The "intron 1 C/T" SNP currently maps to intron 2, and is also
known as rs3801290, and was assayed in 221 affected sibling pairs and
210 discordant sibling pairs in 196 AGRE families. †, a variant reported
at dbSNP within the region we sequenced, but that was not seen in our
dataset. Of note, DLX2 SNP-1, a common SNP (rs743605) was found
to differ significantly in allele frequency between the autistic probands and
the polymorphism discovery sample (χ2 = 4.43, df = 1, p = 0.04). However, this SNP has also been genotyped as part of the HapMap project in
a sample of 30 CEPH trios, and the minor allele frequency was found to
be 0.47, essentially identical to our autism sample. This discrepancy is
likely due to the heterogeneous population composition of the polymorphism discovery sample, which is approximately 26% each of EuropeanAmerican, African-American, and Asian-American populations, with
smaller contributions of Mexican-American and Native-American samples (Collins, et al., 1998, Genome Res. 8, 1229–1231).
