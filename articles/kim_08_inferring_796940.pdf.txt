Abstract
The complete set of mouse genes, as with the set of human genes, is still largely uncharacterized,
with many pieces of experimental evidence accumulating regarding the activities and expression of
the genes, but the majority of genes as yet still of unknown function. Within the context of the
MouseFunc competition, we developed and applied two distinct large-scale data mining approaches
to infer the functions (Gene Ontology annotations) of mouse genes from experimental
observations from available functional genomics, proteomics, comparative genomics, and
phenotypic data. The two strategies – the first using classifiers to map features to annotations, the
second propagating annotations from characterized genes to uncharacterized genes along edges in
a network constructed from the features – offer alternative and possibly complementary
approaches to providing functional annotations. Here, we re-implement and evaluate these
approaches and their combination for their ability to predict the proper functional annotations of
genes in the MouseFunc data set. We show that, when controlling for the same set of input
features, the network approach generally outperformed a naïve Bayesian classifier approach, while
their combination offers some improvement over either independently. We make our
observations of predictive performance on the MouseFunc competition hold-out set, as well as on
a ten-fold cross-validation of the MouseFunc data. Across all 1,339 annotated genes in the
MouseFunc test set, the median predictive power was quite strong (median area under a receiver
operating characteristic plot of 0.865 and average precision of 0.195), indicating that a mining-based
strategy with existing data is a promising path towards discovering mammalian gene functions. As
one product of this work, a high-confidence subset of the functional mouse gene network was
produced – spanning >70% of mouse genes with >1.6 million associations – that is predictive of
mouse (and therefore often human) gene function and functional associations. The network should
be generally useful for mammalian gene functional analyses, such as for predicting interactions,
inferring functional connections between genes and pathways, and prioritizing candidate genes. The
network and all predictions are available on the worldwide web.

Background

Mouse is one of the most important animal models for human
biology and disease, sharing broad molecular, cellular, tissue,
and physiological similarities with humans. Most mouse systems are in close enough equivalence to human for direct
transfer of gene functions, and even show a frequent equivalence of precise phenotypes, such as the observed high similarity of mouse knockout strain phenotypes and human drug
phenotypes [1]. In both mouse and humans, a large fraction
of genes is still largely uncharacterized; of the approximately
28,000 mouse genes in the Mouse Genome Database,
approximately 11,000 have no functional annotations [2].
Thus, it is of critical importance that approaches be explored
for using current data to infer functions for these genes. One
approach to interpreting the mouse (and therefore human)
genome is to take advantage of the vast available collections
of mouse functional genomics and phenotypic data in order to
help identify functions of the many uncharacterized mouse
genes.
When considering how to infer gene function from functional
genomics, proteomics, and phenotypic data, two distinct
strategies appear most viable. The first is the construction of
classifiers that discover mappings from the observed features
to the functional annotation of the genes. Classifiers use previously annotated genes as training examples to learn the
relationships between genes' features and their annotations
(for example, from the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium [3]).
The standard functional prediction approach is to create a
family of simple classifiers, each one learning to predict a single GO annotation. This general strategy exploits the tendency of functional genomics data to directly correlate with
(or exclude) GO annotation; for example, the presence of a
proline dehydrogenase Pfam domain [4] is a strong indicator
that the gene should be annotated with the GO term 'proline
dehydrogenase activity' (GO:0004657).
The second general strategy is not to directly learn mappings
from features to GO annotations, but instead to learn functional associations among the genes (that is, learning the
probability for each gene pair to share annotations conditioned on the data), then propagate annotations via these
associations. This 'guilt-by-association' strategy [5,6] is simple and pragmatic (for example, see [7-14]), given sufficient
data to reconstruct a high-confidence, high-coverage association network. This approach takes advantage of the fact that
many of the available types of functional genomics data naturally describe relationships between genes, rather than
directly correlate with functions. For example, patterns of
mRNA expression may themselves only provide weak features for learning specific GO annotations, but the tendency
to share mRNA expression patterns across many experiments
can be a strong indication of genes' tendency to work
together, and thus to share GO annotations. Likewise, protein
interactions directly specify associations, and thus fall naturally within this scheme.

Within the framework of the MouseFunc competition [15], we
explored these two parallel computational strategies for discovering the functions of mouse genes. Using a limited set of
functional genomics data provided for the mouse genes
within MouseFunc, with gene names disguised and no
sequences provided, contestants trained algorithms to learn
the GO annotations provided for 90% of the mouse genes, and
then made blind predictions on the 10% of genes whose functions were withheld by the organizers. These data and the
structure of this contest provide a platform for assessing the
relative merits, biases, and complementarities of these two
computational strategies. Our submission to the contest combined a functional association network with a classification
ensemble network, both of which involved several handtuned parameters. The analysis presented in the paper is
focused on general properties of the two approaches; thus, we
have repeated the contest using a simpler version of the classifier and network approaches. Using the identical subset of
GO annotations employed in the MouseFunc competition, we
evaluated the relative strengths of these two different
approaches, tested several simple strategies for their combination, and evaluated which biological functions were well
and poorly inferred. As this work represents a draft functional
network of mouse genes, likely to be useful given the absence
of large-scale experimental maps of mouse protein interactions or protein complexes, we also provide the network itself
and search tools on a supporting website.

Results
Data and task
The data provided in the context of the MouseFunc competition (described in Materials and methods and in [15]) consisted of mRNA expression data, eukaryotic and prokaryotic
phlylogenetic profiles, Pfam and Interpro protein domain
annotations, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) disease annotations, for a total of approximately 18
million individual observations. These data sets were provided (with widely varying coverage) for 21,603 mouse genes.
At the time of the MouseFunc competition, 19,443 of those
genes were supplied with labels, and of the remaining 2,160
unlabeled genes, 1,718 were designated as targets for functional prediction.
The gene annotations provided and to be predicted were
terms from the GO. Roughly 5,600 distinct GO annotations
have been defined for mouse genes, falling into three broad
classes: 3,185 labeling biological processes (BP; that is, pathways), 1,874 labeling molecular functions (MF; that is, biochemical activities), and 566 labeling cellular components
(CC; that is, subcellular locations and complexes). For the
contest, 2,816 terms (1,726 BP, 763 MF, and 326 CC) were
selected for prediction evaluation. These were separated into
four frequency categories (3 to 10 occurrences among the
MouseFunc gene set, 11 to 30 occurrences, 31 to 100 occurrences, and 101 to 300 occurrences).

Participants' functional prediction performance was evaluated by computing the quality of the predictions of the 2,816
designated GO annotations on the target genes, with the evaluation broken down by hierarchy (BP, MF, and CC) and frequency (3 to 10, 11 to 30, 31 to 100, and 101 to 300).

Prediction strategies
Any functional prediction technique should identify some
structure between features and annotations in the labeled
data that allow the prediction of annotations in the unlabeled
set. We examined two approaches for discovering this structure and using it to make predictions: a feature-based
approach and a network-based approach. We also examined
the complementarity of these two approaches and simple
approaches for combining them.
The feature-based approach to this problem is conceptually
straightforward: learn a mapping from the features (that is,
the datasets) to the GO annotations. Each mapping (classifier) takes the responsibility for predicting presence or
absence of one of the GO terms. Once trained, the 2,816 individual classifiers map the features of the unlabeled genes to
2,816 predictions regarding the presence or absence of GO
annotations. As our representative of this strategy, we used a
simple naïve Bayes classifier trained on all of the binary features (that is, excluding the co-expression datasets).
As a second strategy, we employed a network-based approach
that operated on the assumption that genes are associated in
a functional network, and that shared GO annotation indicates a functional linkage. The network approach learns functional associations by looking at every pair-wise combination
of genes in the training set. When a pair of genes shares a
given GO term, the features shared by that pair are taken to
be indicative of the functional connection indicated by the
shared annotations. The unlabeled genes are incorporated
into the network by their features, and then annotations are
propagated according to the observed linkages. To test this
approach, we calculated a functional gene association network using a naïve Bayes strategy spanning approximately
91% to 98% (depending on major GO class) of the mouse
genes (as described in the Materials and methods) and then
propagated training set annotation terms through the network to calculate GO annotations for all of the held-out test
set genes. We constructed two networks: a 'full' network ('networkfull') from all of the features and a 'slim' network ('networkslim') from the same binary features used in the classifier.
Since these methods take dramatically different approaches
to the functional prediction problem, it would be reasonable
to investigate whether the two approaches are complementary, with one excelling in some areas and the other in others.
To explore this possibility, we tested simple combinations of
the results of the two approaches (networkfull and classifier),
evaluating the maximum, mean, and minimum of their
scores.

Evaluation of the overall prediction accuracy
In order to measure the prediction performance, we calculated the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve) and APR (average precision) for each GO
class (BP, MF, and CC) and frequency category. AUC is appropriate for normalized, class distribution insensitive evaluations across many GO terms. APR provides a complementary
evaluation, particularly for highly skewed data sets [16].
We conducted two sets of functional prediction experiments,
one using ten-fold cross-validation and another repeating the
MouseFunc contest. Our primary result comes from conducting the ten-fold cross-validation on all 21,603 genes of the
contest. In each fold, 10% of the genes were used as a test set,
and the prediction models were trained on the remaining
90%. The overall performance of each approach is plotted as
average AUC and average APR across all ten folds in Figure 1.
In general, we observed the network-based approach to outperform the classifier, particularly for less frequent categories
(3 to 10, and 11 to 30). In more frequent categories (31 to 100,
and 101 to 300), the evaluations by AUC and APR were not
always consistent (Figure 1a,b). In CC, the network performed better or at least similarly in terms of both AUC and
APR. For BP and MF, the classifier showed higher APR than
the network, although the two approaches were similar in
terms of AUC. Although the networkfull outperformed networkslim across all GO classes and categories, the performances were not very different for both AUC and APR.
Combinations of the two approaches (for example, 'mean' and
'max') generally performed the best but only slightly better
than the network on its own.
The overall predictive accuracy was remarkably high, and the
median AUC and APR values are summarized in Tables 1 and
2, respectively. Across the entire set of GO annotations tested,
the median AUC = 0.865 and the median APR = 0.195, indicating the high power of data mining on existing datasets for
the directed learning of mammalian gene functions. In addition to the ten-fold cross validation, we recreated the MouseFunc contest, using the 19,433 genes of the contest training
set for training. Of the 1,718 contest target genes, we used the
1,339 annotated with at least one of the contest target GO
terms. The results of this experiment are very similar to those
of the cross-validation (see Additional data file 1 for the overall performance for the MouseFunc target genes).
Both of the experiments exhibited consistent trends. BP was
more difficult to predict than MF and CC by both approaches.
The network-based approach generally outperformed the
classifier based approach for infrequent annotations as measured by both AUC and APR, but the two approaches performed more similarly for frequent terms. The network
approach showed more consistent performance across GO
frequency categories, while the performance of the classifier
approach varied more widely.

Figure 1 (see previous page)
Overall performance of the various algorithms' capacity to predict mouse gene GO annotation
Overall performance of the various algorithms' capacity to predict mouse gene GO annotation. The performance of each general strategy ('networkfull',
network-based prediction including expression data; 'networkslim', network-based prediction excluding expression data; and 'classifier', naïve Bayes
classifiers) as well as several methods of combining the networkfull and classifier scores ('mean', arithmetic mean of network and classifier scores; 'min',
minimum of their scores; and 'max', maximum of their scores) is plotted as (a) the mean AUC and (b) the average APR across all Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations averaged across ten-fold predictions in the indicated hierarchies (BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function) and
annotation specificities (terms annotating 3 to 10, 11 to 30, 31 to 100, or 101 to 300 genes). The network approach clearly outperforms the classification
approach on the infrequent annotations ('3 to 10' and '11 to 30'), while the two methods perform nearly equivalently on the frequent annotations ('31 to
100' and '101 to 300'). The mean and max combinations generally perform slightly better than either of their constituents (networkfulland classifier). The
full network shows a significant advantage over the slim network for CC terms and, to a lesser degree, for BP and MF terms. AUC, area under the receiver
operating characteristic.

The relative merits of the association network versus
the classifier
Given the general dominance of the network-based approach
for less frequent terms, we investigated further the relative
performance of each approach. To directly compare the two
approaches, we considered 'networkslim', constructed using
only the binary features in the data, which comprised exactly
the same data set used to train the classifier. Figures 2 and 3
plot the relative performance of the classifier and the networkslim for each specific GO term, separated out by GO class
and frequency category. In terms of both AUC and APR, the
network method performed better in the 3 to 10 and 11 to 30
frequency groups across all three hierarchies (Figures 2 and
3, respectively). In the other frequency groups (31 to 100 and
101 to 300), the points are concentrated along the diagonal,
suggesting highly similar performances from both
approaches. For the most specific terms (3 to 10), many GO
terms show AUCclassifier approximately 0.5 and AUCnetwork_slim
>> 0.5 (Figure 2). This suggests that many GO terms could be
predicted effectively only by the network approach even
based on the same training data, for example 'male sex differentiation' (GO:0046661), with AUCclassifier = 0.54 and
AUCnetwork_slim = 0.95 (recall that AUC of approximately 0.5
indicates random prediction). In contrast, there were cases
where the classifier was much better at predicting the target
GO term, for example 'triplet codon-amino acid adaptor
activity' (GO:0030533), with AUCclassifier = 0.97 and
AUCnetwork_slim = 0.50, and 'antigen binding' (GO:0003823),

with AUCclassifier = 0.92 and AUCnetwork_slim = 0.71. For MF,
this classifier bias could result from a strong association with
a particular domain. For example, the term 'peptide antigen
binding' (GO:0042605), with AUCclassifier = 0.87 and
AUCnetwork_slim = 0.64, was highly predictable by the classifier
due to the annotation's strong correlation with the Pfam
domain 'Perilipin family' [PF03036] involved in lipid/peptide binding. The prediction bias for network and classifier
approaches is discussed in more detail in the next section.

The network and the classifier show different, specific
functional biases
Given the differences observed above between the two general strategies, we asked on which specific GO terms was
there the largest difference in performance between predictions by the network and the classifier. Again, the networkslim
and the classifier were compared for consistency of training
data. As AUC is insensitive to class distribution, that is, GO
term frequency [17], we used AUC to measure the relative performance between the two approaches. In our investigation,
we rank-ordered each GO term by the difference in AUC
based on the network versus the classifier, and then examined
those terms with the largest ΔAUC (Figures 4 to 6). The minimum AUC for either method was set to 0.5, thus ΔAUC values ranged from 0 to 0.5.
We observed strong differences in the predictability for some
GO terms, suggesting functional biases depending on the pre-

Relative 2 (see previousof the network and the classifier methods by AUC
Relative performance of the network and the classifier methods by AUC. Each filled circle represents a specific Gene Ontology (GO) annotation term in
the biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), or molecular function (MF) class, plotting AUC for the slim network on the x-axis and for the
classifier on the y-axis. For less frequent categories ('3 to 10', '11 to 30'), AUC tends to be higher in the networkslim than in the classifier, with most points
falling under the diagonal. For more frequent terms ('31 to 100', '101 to 300'), most points are concentrated near the diagonal, suggesting that the two
approaches perform similarly. This network-bias for less frequent terms was observed across all GO classes of BP, MF and CC. It is notable that for the
most specific GO terms ('3 to 10'), many GO terms were predicted effectively by the network but not by the classifier with AUCnetwork >> 0.5 and
AUCclassifier, although the two approaches used the same data set for training and testing. AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic.

diction method. For example, the MF term 'triplet codonamino acid adaptor activity' (GO:0030533) was effectively
predicted by the classifier, but only poorly by the network; in
contrast, the term 'fibroblast growth factor receptor binding'
(GO:0005104) was predicted well by the network, but only
poorly by the classifier (Figure 5). The biases do not appear
confined to specific types or classes of GO terms. For example, both the network and the classifier-biased BP terms
include diverse cellular functions, such as metabolism, differentiation/development and cell cycle (Figure 4). For the CC
terms, the network predictions are consistent with a known
ability of probabilistic gene networks to effectively capture
core cellular complexes [18], such as transcription/translation apparatus, nucleotide-excision repair complex and cell
signaling (Figure 6).

Overall evaluation of well-predicted and poorly
predicted mouse gene functions
We next took the best performing approach (the 'mean' combination of the networkfull and classifier) and evaluated its
overall predictive performance, asking which overall biological functions were well and poorly predicted. The correlation
between AUC and APR ranged from 0.55 to 0.76 for all tested
GO terms, depending on the prediction algorithm. For our
purpose here, AUC is chosen as the primary measure and
APR as the secondary one.
We employed high level GO terms, choosing terms from the
second level (BP and MF) and the second and the third levels
(CC) of the GO hierarchy. The GO terms in ancestor-descendant relationships were merged to the ancestor term to avoid
redundancy. We examined the distribution of AUC values for
all GO terms that were descendants of each high-level GO
term in the hierarchy. This method allowed us to evaluate
which general functions remain difficult to predict. Figures 7
to 9 plot the results, showing the distributions of AUCs and
APRs as box plots rank ordered by median AUC. Both the
AUCs and the APRs tend to show high variance, although the
GO terms in each box plot share the same high level GO term
as a more general function.
In the BP hierarchy, many of the core cellular processes are
well predicted, for example 'cell proliferation' (GO:0008283),
'RNA localization' (GO:0006403), and 'cytokine production'
(GO:0001816) (Figure 7). Interestingly, many GO annotations that are not single cell-based, but rather tissue specific,

are also well-predicted, for example 'homeostasis of number
of cells' (GO:0048872), 'immune system process'
(GO:0002376),
'reproductive
development
process'
(GO:0003006), and 'synaptic organization and biogenesis'
(GO:0050808). At the lower end of performance, several
other high-level GO BP terms are poorly predicted, among
them 'response to abiotic stimulus' (GO:0009628), 'sexual
reproduction' (GO:0019953), and 'behavioral interaction
between organisms' (GO:0051705). As a wide variety of genes
in many different pathways could participate in these processes and these are primarily emergent behavioral properties,
it is perhaps not surprising that they are hard to learn from
molecular data.
Similar trends are observed amongst MF (Figure 8) and CC
categories (Figure 9), although, in general, the predictions
were strongest for the MF category, with a median AUC of
0.926 across all tested MF annotations (Table 1).

A draft association network of mouse genes
Although the primary goal of this work was to predict the
functions of genes by specifically learning their GO annotation terms, the gene association network itself carries value
beyond the prediction of GO terms. In particular, such networks have proven useful, especially in unicellular organisms
such as yeast, for accurately predicting gene functional associations (for example [19-22]), gene essentiality [23], and the
effect of gene disruption on growth rates (for example [24]).
It is likely that the mouse gene network created here might
have similar utility. In all, the network model is quite extensive; from the MouseFunc datasets, we estimated the probability of sharing at least one GO term for all pairs of mouse
genes. The top-scoring 10% of the associations (>23 million
pairs) were used to construct the association network, covering 91% to 98% of the total genes, depending on GO class.
Even limiting the network to those gene pairs predicted at
high confidence (P > 0.5) to share annotation results in a network comprising >1.6 million associations among approximately 72% to 74% of the total mouse genes. In order that this
network may be used for research beyond that considered
here, the complete set of links with P > 0.5 is made available
on the supporting website [25]. Users can input a specific set
of genes and retrieve additional genes most likely to operate
in the same processes as the input set. This approach is thus
not limited to currently annotated processes, but should be

useful even for gene sets without current GO annotations for
which functional relationships are captured in the network.

Discussion
Relative performance of the network and classifiers
We observe a significant difference in the relative performance of the two overall computational approaches. The network approach showed relatively uniform performance
(AUC) across GO frequency categories, while the performance of the classifier approach showed performance positively correlated to frequency group. The network-based
approach strongly outperformed the classifier approach for
more specific, lower frequency GO terms. For more general
(and more frequent) GO terms, the two approaches were
comparable in terms of both AUC and APR. Since prediction
performance is influenced by a number of factors, such the
amount of data in the training genes, the data available for the
test genes, the reliability of the data set, the algorithm and its
parameters, and the inherent predictability of each GO term
or target function, the reason for the performance differential
on infrequent annotations is not obvious. We offer two plausible explanations below.
First, in the network approach, a test gene prediction is made
by the transfer of GO term annotations from its network
neighbors. As long as the network is more densely connected
among the genes sharing a target GO term, the prediction
score for the target GO term will dominate the scores for other
terms. As the connectivity of a gene is independent of term
frequency but is determined by the number and the types of
available features, the network approach may show uniform
performance across the GO frequency groups. In contrast, the
classifier approach may need a certain amount of training
data to effectively capture the signal for a particular function.
This may explain why AUCclassifier increased from '3 to 10' to
'31 to 100' and reached a plateau between '31 to 100' and '101
to 300' for all classes of BP, MF, and CC (Figure 1a).
Second, some of the binary data represent relationships (for
example, PPI, phylogenetic profiles) that are probably more
useful to the network approach than to the classifier approach
as the network framework is concerned with deducing relationships between genes. Thus, from these data sets, the network can infer strong associations leading to better
propagation of annotation via these associations. While in
principle the classification strategy should be amenable to
this as well, the simple implementation practiced here may

Volume 9, Suppl 1, Article S5

Kim et al. S5.8

not have exploited the contribution of many weak features
effectively for infrequent terms.
Given these potential explanations, it should be noted that the
classifier did outperform the network on a small fraction of
infrequent terms (Figures 2 and 3), and that for a subset of
GO annotations the classifier complemented the network predictions (upper diagonal in Figures 2 and 3), with the result
that the mean score of the two approaches generally showed
a higher performance than either alone (Figure 1a,b).

Compatibility of relational data with the network
approach
Many of the functional genomic data types naturally describe
relationships among genes and are thus amenable to the network-based strategy but not to the classifier approach in a
straightforward way. For example, mRNA expression patterns, when gathered over many distinct experimental conditions, can strongly indicate genes belonging to the same
pathways, as was noted in early analyses of DNA microarray
experiments [26]; the inferred pair-wise relationships are
simple to incorporate in the network framework [5]. Proteinprotein interactions and phylogenetic profiles are also highly
compatible with the network approach. In our experiments,
networkfull (including the expression data) consistently outperformed networkslim (excluding the expression data), supporting the inclusion of such relational data, easily
accommodated in the network approach.

Enhancement of learning rare Gene Ontology
annotations
The strikingly improved performance of the network for rare
(for example, level 3 to 10) GO annotations raises the question of why the network should show such an improvement
for these cases. In particular, the related MouseFunc implementation of this algorithm was one of the top performers in
the MouseFunc competition for the GO level 3 to 10 annotation predictions on held-out genes, and by a considerable
margin in the BP and CC categories. One possibility for this
enhanced performance relates to an intrinsic property of the
network for allowing only functionally related genes to propagate annotation - that is, not all terms are considered as candidates for all genes, but rather only those genes directly
linked to a gene carrying a term can be considered for having
that term. This local connectivity produces two related
effects, one on the prior odds of each annotation being
awarded and one on the prior odds of each gene to receive the
annotation. First, it awards terms in proportion to the prior

the networkslim than in the classifier for less frequent categories ('3 to 10', '11 to 30') with most points falling under the diagonal, but are similar for more
frequent terms ('31 to 100', '101 to 300'), with most points near the diagonal.

odds of having that term - rare terms annotate only a few
genes, which have limited neighbors, which in turn are the
only genes considered for those terms, thereby resulting in
those terms being assigned only rarely in the resulting predictions. Second, as indicated above, in addition to enforcing the
low prior odds for awarding rare terms, only the linked genes
can receive the rare term; not all genes have equal chances of
being labeled with the term. We speculate that these dual
effects may augment the network-based prediction of rare
terms relative to the classification-based strategies.

Implications for discovery of remaining gene functions
One point in particular bears noting: the data employed in the
MouseFunc competition represented only a small fraction of
that currently available; thus, simply by including more of the
data sets already in existence, we can expect a large improvement in prediction of the remaining gene functions. In particular, there is considerable additional mRNA expression data
spanning diverse mouse/human tissues, cell types, and treatments (>500 mouse and >600 human DNA microarray datasets are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database

ple [30]), omitted from MouseFunc, and considerable data
from comparative genomics approaches for inferring interactions (reviewed in [31]), such as the approaches of phylogenetic profiles, gene fusions, and conserved gene neighbors.
While these latter methods do not measure protein sequence
similarity, they require amino acid sequences to calculate,
and therefore were excluded from the MouseFunc competition; they nonetheless add considerable value for analyzing
animal gene functions. For example, knowledge of bacterial
or archaeal homologs' operon organization has been shown to
be a useful predictor of functional relationships among ani-

mal genes [32]; in the absence of sequence information, these
data could not be included. Likewise, phylogenetic profiles
based primarily upon eukaryotic genomes, as in the competition, are known to be much poorer predictors of gene functional associations than phylogenetic profiles based entirely
upon bacterial genomes (for example, see [20,33]). Beyond
these data, incorporation of data from other species via
orthology also offers a rich source of evidence likely useful for
predicting mouse gene function. We estimate that these various data (not even considering orthologous data sets) represent approximately 120 million individual experimental
observations, that is, more than ten-fold more data than

employed in the MouseFunc competition. Thus, there is a
great opportunity for data-mining approaches of the sort
explored here to directly infer mouse gene functions even if
limited to current datasets.

Conclusion

We demonstrate that mouse gene functions can be accurately
learned directly from current functional genomics, proteomics, and phenotypic data sets. Using a combination of
approaches, our median performance for predicting all of the
held-out test set mouse gene GO annotations is reasonably
high (AUC = 0.865, APR = 0.195). We explored the relative
contributions to the predictions of two different computa-

tional strategies - propagation of annotation through a functional gene network and direct prediction of annotation using
an ensemble of classifiers - and showed that the networkbased strategy significantly outperformed the tested classifier-based strategy for relatively infrequent GO terms, while
performing similarly for frequent terms. Analysis of the functions that remain poorly predicted highlights areas for
improved data integration and analyses. Finally, this work
also results in a single gene network that both spans the
majority of mouse genes (>70% of mouse genes in the high
confidence network) and is predictive of mouse (and therefore often human) gene function [25].

Predicting Gene Ontology annotations by a family of
naïve Bayes classifiers

Data
In the context of the MouseFunc competition, we were provided with several data sets describing features of the 21,603
genes in the mouse genome (as of February 2006). The datasets are described elsewhere [15]; we provide short descriptions here.
Three datasets, 'Zhang', 'Su', and 'SAGE', provide mRNA
expression data. 'Zhang' contains 55 DNA microarray experiments covering 13,567 genes [34]. 'Su' contains 61 DNA
microarray experiments covering 18,209 genes [35,36].
'SAGE' describes SAGE tag counts at the 'quality 99' cut-off
for 139 SAGE libraries in the Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression.
Two datasets, 'Pfam' and 'InterPro' provide protein domain
data. Pfam contains 3,133 domains covering 15,569 genes [4].
'InterPro' contains 5,404 domains covering 16,966 genes
[37]. There is some overlap between the domains represented
in each dataset, and both datasets are very sparse. One dataset, 'PPI', contains protein-protein interaction data from the
OPHID database [38]. 'OMIM' contains human disease gene
associations for 2,488 diseases/phenotypes and covers 1,938
genes [39]; additional mouse phenotypes were available from
the Mouse Genome Database [2] ('MGI') containing 33 phenotypes spanning 3,439 genes, as were very limited phylogenetic profiles calculated using BioMart [40] (18 eukaryotic
species) and InParanoid [41] (21 species), covering 15,940
genes and 15,703 genes, respectively.
Along with the data sets, some GO annotations were provided
for 19,443 of the 21,603 known mouse genes, although fewer
than half were annotated by any one major GO branch (BP,
CC, or MF). Of the remaining 2,160 genes, 1,718 were designated as the 'test set', for which functions were to be predicted. Mouse genes have been annotated with 5,624 unique
GO labels; however, only 2,816 of these were used for the
functional prediction problem, selected for having between 3
and 300 positive examples in the data set. Of the 2,816, 1,726
were from BP, 763 from MF, and 326 from CC. After the conclusion of the MouseFunc competition, the organizers provided the annotations of the 1,718 withheld genes. Of the
1,718, 1,339 were annotated and 379 were unannotated.

Organization of experiments
We evaluated prediction performance in two ways: by average
performance over ten-fold cross-validation, and by prediction
of the annotations of the MouseFunc held-out genes. For tenfold cross-validation, we randomly divided the 21,604
MouseFunc genes into 10 equal sized groups. Our evaluation
involved ten rounds of holding out one of the groups, training
the classifier and networks on the remaining groups, and predicting annotations for the held-out group. For the MouseFunc held-out genes, we trained the classifier and networks
on the 19,443 annotated genes, and predicted the annotations
for the 1,339 annotated MouseFunc test set genes.

As a representative example of the classification approach, we
trained and applied 2,815 naïve Bayes classifiers, each to predict the presence or absence of one GO annotation. Feature
vectors for the classifiers were constructed from the following
binary MouseFunc datasets: Pfam, InterPro, PPI, Phenotype,
phylogenetic_binary, and InParanoid, totaling 11,000 binary
features. Use of binary features allowed training of the naïve
Bayes classifiers by simple counting. We used the log-odds
form of naïve Bayes, calculated as:

L = log

P (c =1| f )
P ( c = 1)
= log
+
p(c = 0| f )
P (c = 0)

n

n

∑ log P( f | c = 1) − ∑ log P( f | c = 0)
i

i =1

i

i =1

where c is the class assignment (that is, 1 if the gene has the
annotation, 0 if not), f is a given binary feature, and i is a
counter across the features. In this form, the log-likelihood on
the left hand side will be positive if the features indicate c = 1,
and negative if the features indicate c = 0. Missing features
were omitted from the computation. We transformed the
resulting log-odds ratio into a score by projecting the logodds ratio L onto a sigmoid using the following transformation:
s = eL/(1 + eL)
We implemented naïve Bayes and the sigmoid transformation in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).

Predicting Gene Ontology annotation by the
association network
The network-based prediction comprised two steps: first, the
probability (P) was predicted for each pair of genes to share a
GO term using a naïve Bayes classifier based on all the available features. This produced a functional network, in which
genes formed vertices, with gene pairs connected by edges of
weight P. Second, the GO annotations of each target gene
were inferred by propagating the GO annotations of the
gene's network neighbors.
In calculating the network, 11 pairwise features were
employed (all as provided from the MouseFunc competition):
protein-protein interactions, shared interaction partners,
shared phenotypes (MGI phenotypes, OMIM diseases),
shared domains (Pfam, InterPro), mRNA co-expression
(Zhang, Su and SAGE), and phylogenetic profiles (Ensembl,
InParanoid). Each feature was scored using one of three scoring schemes: the hypergeometric probability, frequency, or
Pearson correlation coefficient.
In the case of protein interactions, shared interaction partners and phylogenetic profiles, we calculated the hypergeometric probability of the partners occurring by random
chance, calculated as:

p(i | n, m, N ) = ⎝ ⎠ ⎝
⎛N⎞
⎜ ⎟
⎝m ⎠
In this approach, P indicates how likely a protein pair (A, B)
is to interact (or share at least k interaction partners, or show
similar phylogenetic profiles, depending on data set) by
chance. For protein-protein interactions, n and m equal the
number of interactions in which each protein A and B is
involved, respectively. N equals the total number of interactions, and k equals 1. In the case of shared interaction partners, n and m are as before, but N equals the total number of
genes, and k equals the number of shared interaction partners
between proteins A and B. For phylogenetic profiles, each
profile (provided in the competition using both Ensembl and
InParanoid) consisted of a binary vector of '1's and '0's, indicating the presence or absence of orthologous genes in the
target organisms. In calculating the phylogenetic profile
hypergeometric distribution, n and m equal the sum of each
vector for the proteins A and B, respectively, N equals the
total number of organisms used to construct the phylogenetic
profiles, and k is the number of shared organisms in the phylogenetic profile. Finally, we calculate -log P as the score for
each of these data sets for each pair of genes.
For the calculation of gene associations using the MGI mouse
phenotype, OMIM disease, Pfam domain, and InterPro
domain data sets, we employed a frequency model as follows.
Each gene was considered to have a feature vector, vi, of
length n, where each vector element represents the presence
(1) or absence (0) of a phenotype, a disease, or a domain. We
calculate P as the probability of sharing the observed number
of vector elements by chance. -log P is taken as the score, calculated as:
n

−log P =

∑
i =1

⎛ f ⎞
−log ⎜ i ⎟

where fi is the frequency of the element i among the N total
genes.
Finally, for the gene expression data sets (Zhang, Su and,
SAGE), we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of
the mRNA expression levels between each pair of genes
across each of the expression data sets.

Volume 9, Suppl 1, Article S5

Kim et al. S5.17

Given this set of scores associated with each pair of genes, we
calculated the probability for a gene pair to share GO terms as
follows. The scores for each pairwise feature were discretized
into bins (9 to 28 bins, depending upon data set). Bins were
chosen by ranking the gene pairs by the given score, then
selecting bin locations to separate the top scoring pairs of
10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000 ...
50,000,000 and L (the total number of pairs) gene pairs. In
the case of the mRNA expression data sets, a similar process
was also performed after ranking the gene pairs in reverse
order (capturing anti-correlation of the expression vectors).
In the event that the number of bins was less than 7 after
merging the same break points, the bin size was reduced by
half until the number of bins became 7 or more. For each gene
pair, the posterior probability of sharing at least one GO term
was then predicted using a naïve Bayesian classifier based
upon the discretized bins.
Finally, a gene association network was constructed between
gene pairs using the top 10% probabilities of sharing GO
terms as edge weights. GO terms were predicted for each target gene by propagating the GO terms of its neighbors in the
network. For a target gene with k neighbors (n1, n2 ... nk), the
prediction score, Si, for each GO term, Gi, was calculated as:

Si = 1 −

∏ (1 − P )
k

k

where Pk is the edge weight between the target gene and its kth neighbor.

Combination of network and classifier predictions
The predicted scores from the networkfull and the classifier
were combined by simply applying the given operation (minimum, maximum, mean) to each pair of predictions. If the
prediction score by network is Snetwork and the score by classifier is Sclassifer, then the combined score will be min(Snetwork,
Sclassifer), (Snetwork+Sclassifer)/2 and max(Snetwork, Sclassifer) for
the minimum, the mean, and the maximum score, respectively.

Evaluation of prediction performance
To evaluate the prediction performance of the various algorithms, we calculated the AUC, or area under a ROC curve, for
each classification approach as applied to each GO term, and
then examined the mean, median, and distribution of the
AUC values. An ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity, TP/[TP+FN]) versus the false positive rate (1 - specificity, FP/(FP+TN)), where TP is true positives, FN is false
negatives, FP is false positives, and TN is true negatives. A
randomly guessing classifier will have an equal true positive
rate and false positive rate, yielding an AUC of 0.5. A classifier
making predictions better than random will produce a curve
above the diagonal, and an AUC greater than 0.5, with a perfect classifier having an AUC of 1.0. A classifier making predictions worse than random will produce a curve below the

diagonal, yielding an AUC between 0 and 0.5. The AUC was
calculated using the ROCR library [42], which is shown to
generate nearly the same AUC values as the script used for the
MouseFunc competition.
We calculated the AUC for the 1,339 annotated genes (out of
the 1,714 total genes) in the MouseFunc test set, using the
same February 2006 GO annotations used in the competition, and the identical held-out test set of annotated genes.
Summary statistics for groups of GO terms (mean, median,
standard deviation) include only annotations with at least one
positive example. The mean for a given group - for example,
'BP 3 to 10' - is the mean of the AUCs computed for the 1,339
annotated test set genes, for all of the GO terms belonging to
the group 'BP 3 to 10', where its GO terms belong to the biological process class and the term frequency is between 3 and
10 in the MouseFunc training data set.
