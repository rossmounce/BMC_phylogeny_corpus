Abstract
Background: Cattle are important agriculturally and relevant as a model organism. Previously
described genetic and radiation hybrid (RH) maps of the bovine genome have been used to identify
genomic regions and genes affecting specific traits. Application of these maps to identify influential
genetic polymorphisms will be enhanced by integration with each other and with bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) libraries. The BAC libraries and clone maps are essential for the hybrid cloneby-clone/whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach taken by the bovine genome sequencing
project.
Results: A bovine BAC map was constructed with HindIII restriction digest fragments of 290,797
BAC clones from animals of three different breeds. Comparative mapping of 422,522 BAC end
sequences assisted with BAC map ordering and assembly. Genotypes and pedigree from two
genetic maps and marker scores from three whole-genome RH panels were consolidated on a
17,254-marker composite map. Sequence similarity allowed integrating the BAC and composite
maps with the bovine draft assembly (Btau3.1), establishing a comprehensive resource describing
the bovine genome. Agreement between the marker and BAC maps and the draft assembly is high,
although discrepancies exist. The composite and BAC maps are more similar than either is to the
draft assembly.
Conclusion: Further refinement of the maps and greater integration into the genome assembly
process may contribute to a high quality assembly. The maps provide resources to associate
phenotypic variation with underlying genomic variation, and are crucial resources for
understanding the biology underpinning this important ruminant species so closely associated with
humans.

Background

Cattle have played a crucial role throughout recent human
agrarian history, providing draft power, milk and meat for
human consumption since domestication 8,000 years ago
[1,2]. Cattle studies have contributed to our knowledge of
endocrine function, fertilization, and growth, and enhanced
our understanding of genetics, selection and evolution [3,4].
However, much remains to be determined; particularly, how
cattle have adapted to intense selection pressures since
domestication and how ruminants convert low quality forages into energy and protein-dense meat and milk. Worldwide, roughly 1,000 different breeds and varieties have been
recognized [5]. These breeds originated in different locations,
were subjected to different environments, and possess somewhat different characteristics as a consequence of ongoing
natural and artificial selection. Ancestry of much of today's
seedstock can be traced to breed-specific herdbooks established in the mid-1800's [2]. Formalization of the genetic
selection process has culminated in extensive estimation of
heritabilities, and genetic and environmental relationships
between traits [6,7], coupled with objective approaches to
animal evaluation [8] and selection [9]. These have been
widely utilized in the development of modern beef and dairy
performance recording and evaluation schemes [10-12]. The
phenotype-based selection systems developed and optimized
in the last century are now moving towards integration of
DNA information to accelerate genetic progress.

While numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been
mapped [13,14], only a small number of quantitative trait
nucleotides or causative mutations [15-19] have been identified for economically important cattle QTL. We expect further
development of cattle genomic resources to accelerate discovery of causative mutations, and facilitate genome-wide selection that considers whole genome sequence and associated
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rather than specific individual loci [20].
Understanding the genetic basis of breed differentiation
through natural and artificial selection, production related
traits, and disease will be greatly advanced by the availability
of the genomic sequence of cattle. The foundation of the
genomic sequence is provided by a clone-based physical map.
Development of a clone-based physical map also offers a
resource to accelerate discovery of polymorphisms within and
between breeds, including causal polymorphisms contributing to a wide variety of bovine traits. The physical map is a
source of genomic clones for sequencing templates and functional studies, and can also be employed to assist in the
assembly of whole genome shotgun sequence [21-23].
The value of a clone-based map can be enhanced by establishing connections to the annotated genome sequences of closely
related species [24], as well as to sequence tagged site (STS)
maps of the same species. Links established between clones
and annotated sequence can be used to identify specific

digest fingerprint patterns, containing a single large molecular weight HindIII fragment (> 30 kb, the largest marker fragment), in addition to the expected vector-specific HindIII
fragment(s). These clones appeared to lack HindIII sites
within the insert, and were therefore unsuitable for fingerprint pattern-based assembly. Digestion of a small number of
these clones with EcoRI generated fingerprints of one to four
restriction fragments, each present in multiple copies (data
not shown), suggesting that the inserts in these BAC clones
were probably derived from regions of repetitive sequence
[36]. Thus, while represented within the BAC library these
genomic regions are under-represented within the fingerprint map.

Aligning bovine BAC clones to the human genome

refereed research

Clone fingerprints were assembled into the International
Bovine BAC Consortium (IBBMC) map, which consists of 655
contigs containing 257,914 clones, and 32,883 singletons
(Table 3) [39-42]. This map is the result of first assembling an
initial, high-stringency map, followed by merging based on
similarity between clones at contig ends, number of
unmatched restriction fragments at potential merge points,
and comparative BES alignments. The initial 13,426 contigs
and 34,189 singletons were assembled with FPC [43,44],
before clone order within contigs was refined using
CORAL[45].

reports

Following strategies used to increase contiguity, order and
orient the mouse [24] and rat [21] BAC maps, bovine BAC end
sequence (BES) reads were aligned with the reference human
genome sequence [37,38]. At least one end read was available
for 186,872 (64%) of the mapped BAC clones, and 149,865
(52%) had sequence data for both ends (Table 2, with additional data on their properties in Additional data file 1). A set
of 12,273 paired BES alignments was obtained after filtering
on alignment score, relative position and orientation. A single
end sequence of 40,134 clones had a suitable match. In total,
48,325 clones in 480 contigs, along with 4,082 singletons,
had sequence anchors to the human genome.

BAC clone fingerprinting
Clones from three BAC libraries, representing DNA from both
beef and dairy cattle, were fingerprinted: 200,064 CHORI240 [32], 94,848 RPCI-42 [32,33], and 44,948 TAMBT [34].
These include 18,982 CHORI-240 clones previously mapped
on a low-coverage BAC fingerprint map [35], and 755 TAMBT
clones selected for presence of a bovine marker. Fingerprints
were attempted for 339,840 clones, and fingerprints for
290,797 clones (85.6%) were used to assemble the fingerprint
map. These fingerprinted clones represent approximately a
15.5-fold coverage of the estimated 3.1 Gb bovine genome
(Table 1).

comment

clones containing genes of interest, and connections to
genetic STS maps can indicate clones harboring QTL. Existing bovine genetic maps, however, have limited utility for
identifying clones containing positional candidate genes near
QTL, due to a lack of gene-specific genetic markers and a lack
of recombination to separate closely linked markers within
the existing bovine genetic maps [25-27]. Available gene-rich
radiation hybrid (RH) maps [28-30] have greater short-range
resolution than genetic maps, but their whole-chromosome
ordering may be unreliable [31], and RH maps often lack
many of the polymorphic markers that are needed to refine
the locations of QTL. Exploiting the complementary resolution of genetic and RH data, a composite map can consolidate
marker information to more efficiently indicate genes and
sequence in the vicinity of QTL. Connections between a clonebased physical map, composite marker map, and annotated
genome sequences will greatly facilitate the annotation of
newly generated and assembled sequence. We report here the
generation of a fingerprinted bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC)-based physical map, representing approximately 15.5fold coverage of the bovine genome; the construction of a
composite marker map from two linkage and three RH data
sets; and connections with annotated human sequence and
the largely unannotated draft bovine genome sequence.

When merging contigs, Sulston fingerprint similarity scores
[46] were relaxed from the initial stringency, considering that
the search space was limited to contig ends, and comparative
alignments provided supporting evidence. A maximum of
four unmatched restriction fragments across the merge point
(fragments present in only one of the two merged contigs)
allowed for: first, minor errors in fragment identification by
BandLeader, the automated band calling software; second,
the fact that HindIII does not cleanly excise the insert from
the vector in the CHORI-240 and RPCI-42 BAC clones,
resulting in two vector-insert junction fragments of unpredictable size that are not expected to be shared by neighboring clones; and third, the potential presence of polymorphic
restriction fragments produced by indels, duplications, SNPs

creating or destroying HindIII restriction sites, and other
haplotype and/or breed-specific DNA variations that result in
restriction fragment length differences. Automated scripts
were employed throughout the merging process, although
merges based on comparative alignments were manually
inspected. Discrepancies between FPC/CORAL and humanbased clone orders were identified, and manually evaluated in
conjunction with the fingerprint images. Clones were rearranged to be consistent with human order only when the rearrangements were supported by fingerprint data.

and X chromosome (Additional data file 3) [40,48,49] was

information

BES alignments to the human genome was used to assign,
order and orient contigs on bovine chromosomes. Contigs
were renumbered to reflect their chromosome assignments
and relative order. A total of 379 of the 655 contigs were
mapped onto bovine chromosomes by this process, 300 to
autosomes (Table 3; Additional data file 2) and 79 to the X
chromosome. An additional 18 contigs were tentatively
assigned to the Y chromosome, five based on positive probes
for the sex-determining region Y (SRY) marker, and the
remainder based on fingerprint similarity to the SRY-positive
contigs. The contigs assigned to autosomes had a mean size of
9.8 Mbp, based on the fingerprint data, and a mean of 813
clones per contig. Contigs assigned to the X chromosome
were substantially smaller, with means of 1.7 Mbp and 92
clones per contig. Y-assigned contigs also averaged 92 clones

maps, and the third generation Illinois-Texas (ILTX-2005)
[28], Shirakawa Institute (SIAG) [29], and BovGen RH maps.
For this work, the BovGen data set includes markers on the
BovGen map [30], bovine sequencing project SNP [50], and
other markers scored on the ComRad [51] panel. Strategies to
exploit complimentary resolution characteristics of linkage
and RH data [52,53] were employed to overcome inconsistencies between the individual maps. Sequence-based matching
identified 17,254 unique markers from a total of 25,582 markers in the combined data sets, with 6,716 shared by at least
two data sets and 6,173 common to at least one linkage and
one RH data set (Table 5).
The markers were mapped as 15,627 discrete entities,
accounting for RH markers showing identical retention
patterns within a panel. Three maps were computed for each
chromosome. Only linkage and RH data were considered to
determine an unassisted order. Ordering information from
the BAC map and Btau3.1 draft assembly [54] was introduced
for BAC- and sequence-assisted maps. Centimorgan (cM) and
kilobase pair locations from the most likely of the three maps
were interpolated using location database software [55], and
confidence intervals were estimated. Mean separation
between projected marker positions was 0.27 cM, or 228 Kbp.
Estimated confidence intervals (CIs) indicate that 5,241
markers, occupying 4,639 positions, could not be repositioned relative to other markers without reducing likelihood.
Expressed in cM, the median estimated CI is 0.8 cM, and
62.5% of markers have CI ≤ 1 cM. A tiny fraction of markers
(0.1%) have extremely ambiguous positions with estimated
CI ≥ 25 cM. Most of the extremely ambiguous markers are
expressed sequence tag (EST)-based SNPs and have ambiguous placement on the SIAG-USDA linkage map [27].

Marker-clone, marker-sequence and clone-sequence
alignments
In addition to markers derived from BES, direct alignments
between marker and clone-based sequences and indirect
alignments using alignments of marker and clone sequences
to whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS) contigs were used

to anchor markers to the BAC fingerprint map. Matches
between 10,313 markers and 25,591 BAC clones in 426 contigs were identified using e-PCR [56] and BLAT [57]. This
includes 9,916 markers that matched 23,724 clones in 359
contigs assigned to autosomes or the X chromosome. Composite and BAC map chromosome assignments were consistent for 97.6% of the 8,902 markers that matched clones from
a single chromosome. For 97.2% of the 1,014 markers that
matched clones from multiple chromosomes (autosomes and
X), at least one of the matched clones was assigned to the
same chromosome as the marker. Additionally, clone-marker
alignments suggested placement of 23 contigs that were not
assigned to chromosomes by comparative alignments.
The comparative map-based chromosome assignments were
supported by marker-clone alignments for 290 of the 300
contigs assigned to autosomes, and 66 of the 79 contigs
assigned to X. The composite map indicated different chromosome assignments for only three autosome-assigned contigs (ctg7970 - BTA10; ctg17005 - BTA6; ctg25050 - BTA4).
Each of these is located near a bovine-human breakpoint, so
ambiguity in the bovine-human comparative map may have
resulted in the apparent misassignment. For 112 of the 121
contigs containing clones that were assayed for a marker,
comparative chromosome assignments agree with the physical probe assignments.
Further support for the comparative map-based chromosome
assignments was provided by the first-generation bovine
physical map produced by the French National Institute for
Agricultural Research (INRA) [35]. The IBBMC and INRA
BAC maps share 18,980 CHORI-240 clones, which allow 227
of IBBMC contigs to be joined with 653 INRA contigs. Chromosome assignments concur for 192 of the 214 assigned
IBBMC contigs containing a shared CHORI-240 clone. Markers associated with INRA clones suggest chromosome assignments for the 13 unassigned IBBMC contigs containing a
shared clone, although the assignments for two of these contigs remain ambiguous.

information

A BAC physical map that spans the majority of the bovine
genome has been constructed. Genome coverage by the BAC
map is at least equal to that of the Btau 3.1 7X draft sequence
assembly. Genome size estimated from the BAC map is 3.1
Gbp, somewhat larger than the 2.9 Gbp estimated by the
bovine genome sequencing project, but at the low end of the
3.1 to 3.8 Gbp range of estimates obtained from different
measures of haploid DNA content [61,62]. The use of three
different BAC libraries each constructed using different
restriction enzymes may have increased coverage over that
possible with a single restriction enzyme, because certain
genomic regions may not be clonable due to recognition site

Discussion

refereed research

The arrangement of markers and BAC clones along the composite map, BAC map and Btau3.1 assembly is depicted in
Figure 1. Gbrowse [59] implementations to visualize the
maps, including alignments to the BAC map, draft bovine and
human sequence assemblies, and relative positions of QTL
summarized from the literature [14,60] are available online
[40,48,49].

deposited research

After removing markers that matched multiple chromosomes, or had widely separated matches on a single chromosome, a set of 14,123 markers was identified to evaluate the
likelihood of marker order along the Btau3.1 draft assembly,
and to provide the starting point for sequence-assisted reordering of the composite map. Similarly, 7,780 markers with
consistent BAC and composite map chromosome assignments matched to single or close clones on the BAC map were
used to evaluate the likelihood of markers in the BAC map
order, and initiate a BAC-assisted reordering of the composite
map. Log10-likelihoods of markers ordered according to the
assembly are lower than for the same markers in the unassisted composite map order (Additional data file 4). Differences in log10-likelihoods between markers ordered
according to the BAC or unassisted composite map are not as
pronounced; the BAC map orders for BTA17 and BTA20 are
more likely than the unassisted order. After rearranging and
adding markers not included in the starting order, the BACassisted order was more likely than the unassisted order for
20 autosomes (Additional data file 5). Sequence-assisted
orders were never the most likely computed order, but the
log10-likelihoods are intermediate between the unassisted
and BAC-assisted orders for ten chromosomes.

reports

End and other partial sequences from 156,783 fingerprinted
BAC clones were also aligned to the assembled draft genome
sequence. These include: 128,774 autosome- or X-assigned
clones matched to whole-chromosome scaffold sequences;
26,587 autosome- or X-assigned clones matched to unassigned scaffolds; and 14,586 singleton BAC clones or clones in
unassigned fingerprint contigs matched to whole-chromosome scaffold sequence. BAC map and draft assembly chromosome assignments were consistent for 96.1% of the aligned
clones. All 379 autosome- and X-assigned fingerprint contigs
contained at least one clone with sequence matching the
bovine assembly. All autosomal BAC contigs contained at
least one clone matching sequence assembled for that auto-

some, and the most frequently matched chromosome was
consistent with BAC map chromosome assignment for 98.7%
of the 300 autosome-assigned BAC contigs. Thirty-seven contigs exclusively matched sequence assembled for the assigned
chromosome. Agreement between BAC map and assembly
orders was less than that observed between the composite
map and either the BAC map or assembly, with ρ between
0.88 and 0.95, and τ between 0.81 and 0.91 for the autosomes; for X, ρ = 0.79 and τ = 0.62.

reviews

Composite map markers were also matched to the Btau3.1
draft assembly using e-PCR and BLAT. The draft assembly
consists of contig sequences and intermediate scaffolds
assembled with ATLAS [58], which were arranged on wholechromosome scaffolds according to a set of bovine markers. A
total of 15,746 markers matched 14,952 contig sequences,
including15,498 markers matching whole-chromosome scaffolds, and 706 markers matching unassigned scaffolds. Further, 3,897 markers matched multiple contigs; for 3,495 of
these, all contigs were within the same intermediate scaffold,
175 matched multiple intermediate scaffolds assigned to the
same chromosome, and 227 matched scaffolds assigned to
different chromosomes. Composite map and draft assembly
chromosome assignments were consistent for 96.4% of the
markers matching a single chromosome, and one assembly
assignment concurred with the composite map for 92.7% of
markers matching multiple chromosomes. Markers matched
668 unassigned scaffolds; 542 unassigned scaffolds matched
a single marker, 97 matched more than one marker from the
same chromosome, and 29 unassigned scaffolds matched
markers from two or more chromosomes. Rank correlations
suggest somewhat greater rearrangement between the composite map and draft assembly than was observed between
the composite and BAC maps; ρ ranged from 0.89 to 1.00,
with ρ of 13 chromosomes greater than 0.99; and τ was
between 0.87 and 0.96. The level of agreement for the X chromosome was similar to the autosomes, with ρ = 0.98 and τ =
0.95.

comment

Strong agreement between composite and BAC map orders is
indicated by Spearman's (ρ) and Kendall's (τ) rank correlation coefficients. Spearman's ρ, used to measure strength of
the relationship between marker order along the two maps,
ranges from 0.97 to 1.00 among autosomal markers matched
to BAC clones. Coefficients are > 0.99 for 21 of the 29 autosomes. Kendall's τ indicates rearrangement necessary to reconcile orders, and ranges from 0.92 to 0.99 for the autosomal
maps. Agreement between orders along the X chromosome is
slightly weaker, with ρ = 0.91 and τ = 0.72. For all chromosomes, ρ exceeds τ, suggesting any rearrangements between
the maps are predominately local, involving markers in close
proximity to each other.

ILTX−2005

Examination of preliminary composite and BAC maps
showed that discrepancies could not readily be resolved.
Beyond the inevitable laboratory errors contributing to incorrect marker and clone order and contig membership, potential causes of discrepancies include sub-optimal orders of
both maps, ambiguous orders, and error arising from spurious marker and clone sequence alignments. The composite
map orders are probably less than optimal, because explicitly
evaluating n!/2 possible orders, where n may represent a
hundred or more markers on each chromosome, is computationally infeasible. The traveling salesman problem (TSP)
approach [69,70] can be taken to implicitly determine optimal order for some RH data sets, but the combined data sets
were not suitable for TSP analysis. Our approach of adding
markers to an initial order, and using iterative flips and polish
consistently produced the most likely order when testing
alternative map construction strategies. The final order from
this approach, however, is influenced by the starting order,
and identifying the optimal order is not guaranteed. The
process of computing maps from three different starting
orders was intended to avoid bias towards any of the contributing marker maps, and to introduce fine-scale arrangements
supported by external data that are not explicitly considered
in the ordering process. Unassisted maps started from a pair
of markers from opposite ends of each chromosome, to avoid
bias towards any of the contributing maps. BAC-assisted
orders started with markers ordered according to the BAC
map, to introduce arrangements supported by fingerprint
data. Similarly, sequence-assisted orders starting from markers ordered according to the draft assembly introduced
assembly-based arrangements. This strategy of seeding the
marker order according to the BAC map or assembly introduces marker arrangements that may not otherwise be evaluated. By considering these arrangements, the BAC map and

There is significant global agreement among the bovine maps,
although each of the contributing maps was rearranged to
some extent relative to the composite map, and differences in
order among the composite map, BAC map and sequence
exist. Based on rearrangements among the well-connected
whole-genome maps, the ILTX-2005 RH map is more similar
to the composite and BAC map than either the SIAG RH or
SIAG-USDA linkage map, and all the marker maps are more
similar to the BAC map than to the Btau3.1 draft sequence
assembly (Figure 2). Differences in log10-likelihoods suggest
that the BAC map order is better supported by available linkage and RH data than the order of markers along the assembled sequence.

reports

A composite linkage/RH map was also developed. This map
consolidates available data to place markers in a consensus
order and approximate positions in common cM and Kbp
scales. The CarthaGene [31,51] procedures used to construct
the bovine composite map have also been used to order
markers on composite linkage maps of a parasitoid wasp [63],
grapevine [64], rapeseed [65] and conifers [66], and a porcine
map that combines linkage and RH data [67]. A related
approach using weighted least squares is implemented in
JoinMap [68] to compute composite linkage maps produced
from different populations. Combining four linkage data sets
for the Picea mariana × Picea rubens species complex [66]

reported that similar maps were obtained with either JoinMap or CarthaGene.

biases. Coverage by the BAC map may still be incomplete,
however, because other highly repetitive, complex regions,
such as telomeric and centromeric regions, may not be clonable with any enzyme, and may not be represented in any of the
BAC libraries or the BAC map. Error in our estimates of
genome size and genome coverage by individual contigs cannot be fully ascertained without a more finished assembly of
bovine genomic sequence.

sequence have some influence on the resulting composite
map, but testing rearrangements of the seeded order ensures
that the composite map will not include arrangements that
are not supported by the marker data.
Some apparent discrepancies may result from ambiguously
placed markers, which can occupy several positions on the
composite map with equal likelihood. Ambiguity on the composite map also affects orders within regions between markers shared by two or more data sets, where there are no data
to indicate the best merged order of markers that are unique
to each data set. Other discrepancies may be attributed to
spurious marker-clone alignments that appear only because
of the erroneous match between a marker and clone, while
some real discrepancies may be hidden by undetected links
between markers and clones. Erroneous alignments may also
contribute to errors on the composite map, if markers from
different data sets are matched by incorrect alignments to the
same GenBank bovine sequence or EST cluster (Bos taurus
gene index or NCBI UniGene). The sequence based marker
matching procedures were implemented to overcome inconsistent marker nomenclature, and result in identification of
many more common markers than matches based solely on
marker name. The sequence based procedures are
dependent, however, on correct assembly of the sequences
used to link markers. The two-point procedures to resolve
inconsistent chromosome assignments will correctly break
matches between markers that should be placed on different
chromosomes, but will not detect incorrect matches between
markers that should be separated on the same chromosome.
Repetitive sequence, particularly segmental duplications and
other large scale genome variants [71], may exacerbate discrepancies between the marker and BAC maps. BAC clones
that encompass or overlap a large duplication may be incorrectly assigned to the same contig, or correctly assigned but
incorrectly ordered within a contig due to similarity of the fingerprints. Markers that match non-overlapping clones may
indicate presence of repetitive sequence in the marker, clone
and/or intermediate WGS sequence. Some rearrangements
between the marker and BAC maps may be real, considering
the diversity of genetic material represented by the maps,
which include Bos taurus × Bos indicus crosses and several
Bos taurus breeds. Breed-specific rearrangements have been
shown in sheep [72], and structural variations, including
inversions and inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations,
have been detected among humans of diverse ethnic origin
[73,74].
The level of disagreement between the composite map and
assembled sequence can be reduced by rearranging the intermediate scaffold sequences according to the average (mean or
median) composite map position of markers matching each
scaffold, instead of ordering scaffolds according to minimum
marker position within each scaffold, as was done for the current draft assembly. Basing the order of scaffolds on average

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R165

rather than minimum marker position will be more accurate,
especially if the minimum position is for a marker misplaced
relative to other markers matching the scaffold. Remaining
discrepancies between the composite map and assembly may
have similar explanations as the inconsistencies between the
composite and BAC maps: laboratory errors, ordering errors
and ambiguous orders, spurious alignments, complications
arising from repetitive DNA sequence, and structural
variation among the genomes represented by the composite
map and sequence.
Rearranging scaffolds to more accurately represent the
marker map will also reduce disagreement between the
assembled sequence and BAC map. Further refinement of the
draft assembly may be achieved through greater consideration of the BAC map in the assembly process. Genomes represented by the BAC map and bovine reference sequence should
be highly similar; reference DNA was obtained from a
daughter of the bull used to construct the CHORI-240 library,
which predominates the BAC map. The relationship coefficient (rxy) [75] of 0.954 between these two partially inbred
individuals indicates their genomes will not be exactly the
same, but will be much more similar than sire and progeny
genomes resulting from mating unrelated parents (rxy = 0.5).
Besides the high density of alignments between WGS and
BAC sequences, which can anchor and orient more genomic
sequence than any marker map, paired BES alignments are
especially valuable to orient and space adjacent sequence segments. Paired BES information has been used along with
sequenced mammalian genomes to construct detailed framework maps [76]. In the current context, it can also be used as
an independent check of the draft assembly and map coherency. Paired BES alignments [77] against the current draft
assembly revealed possible clone identification and assembly
errors. Systematic identification errors may affect BACs on 25
or more plates of the CHORI-240 library, containing approximately 3% of the BAC clones (A Ratnakumar and B Dalrymple, unpublished). Mis-identification may account for some
chromosome assignment discrepancies between the
composite and BAC map, and between the BAC map and draft
assembly, but will not affect within-chromosome order comparisons, which do not include discrepant chromosome
assignments. Considering estimated clone size, orientation
and separation between paired BES alignments may improve
the genome assembly. In a preliminary examination of a 50scaffold region of BTA1, links between paired BES suggested
a number of currently unassigned scaffolds should be placed
in the region, and the neighbors and/or orientation of most
scaffolds should change (B Dalrymple, W Barris and A Ratnakumar, unpublished). The discrepancies in order are
predominantly local, consistent with the Kendall's correlation
analysis.
Currently observed inconsistencies between the composite
map, BAC map, and assembled sequence suggest that all may

The composite map consolidates available bovine mapping
data, and leverages the complementary resolution of linkage
and RH maps to provide a comprehensive marker map of the
bovine genome. The BAC fingerprint map provides a resource
to define comparative synteny, order and orient bovine
genomic sequence, and estimate genome size and complexity.
Further elucidation of the bovine genome is obtained from
integration of the composite and BAC maps with annotated
human sequence, draft bovine genomic sequence, and QTL
describing genomic regions associated with phenotypic variation. QTL, described relative to the marker maps, can be
anchored to underlying bovine genomic sequence through
the BAC map. Annotation, transferred through the high-resolution bovine-human BAC-based comparative map, supplies
information about genes and gene function needed to
enhance our understanding of biological mechanisms affecting agriculturally important traits. The BAC map is a valuable
resource for the development of genomic tools to further our
knowledge of evolution of this species, which has undergone
natural, undocumented and documented artificial selection,
and which may contribute further insight into human
conditions.

Based on recorded pedigree, the Hereford bull used for
CHORI-240 has an inbreeding coefficient (Fx) of 0.31 [75].
His daughter used for the bovine genome sequencing project

be improved to provide more accurate representations of the
bovine genome. Some improvement of the composite map
was realized by including fingerprint-scale information to
reorder markers on the BAC-assisted map. Re-examination of
the BAC map in light of the refined marker map may suggest
further refinement of the BAC map, involving merges
between contigs, splitting of contigs and other rearrangements. Similarly, examination of the draft sequence assembly
relative to the BAC map may increase consistency with the
BAC map and composite map. An iterative approach to refining the various maps is suggested. However, no rearrangement should occur for the sake of increasing consistency
between the maps and sequence, unless appropriate data supporting the rearrangement are available. Discrepancies
between the maps are relevant, pointing to regions where
more experimental data are needed, where caution is
required when examining contents of particular regions, and
where bovine genomes may be prone to differ due to naturally
occurring large-scale polymorphisms.

Initial fingerprint map assembly
BAC fingerprints were assembled using FPC [43,44]. The initial assembly was performed using the default parameters
(tolerance 7; min bands 3; best = 10; no CpM) and a cutoff
value of 1 × 10-16. The fingerprinted clones were then screened
and filtered as follows to remove fingerprint patterns indicative of artifactual data. First, a software application, MapMop, was developed to calculate the distributions of insert
size and number of restriction fragments for the clones. Based
on these distributions, filtering parameters were determined
to identify 'outlier' clones that represented extremes for insert
size and/or number of restriction fragments, suggesting
problematic data such as that resulting from partial digestion
of the BAC DNA, or the presence of DNA from more than a
single BAC clone (cross-well contamination). Second, initial
filtering parameters were assessed by visual inspection of
representative clone fingerprints and were adjusted to
minimize the retention of poor quality data while limiting the
loss of high quality data. Filtering parameters were determined separately for individual libraries, for clones within
contigs and for clones that were not assembled into contigs
('singletons').
Following filtering, the remaining fingerprints were again
assembled at a cutoff value of 1 × 10-16. The DQer function in
FPC was used to reassemble any contigs that contained 'Q'
clones, which exhibit an unusual number of extra bands or
gaps between bands matching the Q clone to other clones,
resulting in false positive overlaps between putative contigs.
The presence of Q clones within a contig is suggestive of misassembly due to false-positive fingerprint matches. The DQer

function reassembled the clones within the contig with successively increasing stringency until no Q clones remained.
The resulting contigs were subsequently processed with an
automated clone ordering application, CORAL [45], to refine
clone order within the contigs.

Merging map contigs
Contigs were merged in multiple steps using automated
scripts to identify and execute joins between contigs. Initial
merges were performed using only the fingerprint data to
identify candidate merge points for contigs that satisfied the
criteria of Sulston scores of 9 × 10-8 for at least two contig end
clones, and that had no more than four unconfirmed fragments at the merge point. An unconfirmed fragment is one
that is present in the fingerprint of the end clone of one contig
but without a match to fragments in fingerprints of end clones
in either of the contigs at the merge point. A subset of merged
contigs was manually reviewed to evaluate whether these
parameters resulted in incorrect merges.
After making the initial merges, BES alignments to the
human sequence assembly were examined to identify candidate contig merges based on their human genome sequence
coordinates. Merges were made in cases where the Sulston
score match between end clones was 9 × 10-7 and there were
four or fewer unconfirmed fragments. Automated scripts and
human inspection were used to identify and eliminate incorrect clone orders and merges at multiple points throughout
the merging process.

Independent two-point analyses of each RH data set were
conducted to identify markers to be included on the composite map. Markers common to each RH data set and the SIAGUSDA linkage data were identified. Starting from this set,
markers linked with a two-point LOD > 7.0 and < 40 centiRad
(cR) separation from previously linked marker were identified in successive passes through the two-point results.
Markers assigned to each chromosome-specific linkage group
were ordered by an automated process [53], seeded with
three different orders. An initial, unassisted order started
with a pair of markers from opposite ends of the chromosome. The BAC-assisted order started with the BAC map
order of markers that were matched to BAC clones, and the
sequence-assisted order started with the assembly order of
markers that were anchored to the assembly. Only markers
with consistent chromosome assignments, and unambiguous
placement on the BAC map or sequence were included in the
starting orders. Log10-likelihoods of markers in the BAC- and
sequence-based starting orders were computed, iterative
polish and flips procedures were applied to determine a more
likely order of markers included in the starting order, remaining markers assigned to the chromosome were sequentially
added, and the final order was determined with iterative

reports

The composite map was built using data from two independent linkage maps, as well as markers scored for presence or
absence on three independent whole-genome RH panels
(Table 5). Genotypes and pedigrees were those used for the
SIAG-USDA linkage map [26] with EST-based SNP [27], and
the UAMU SNP linkage map [50]. The two maps anchor
7,404 markers along 30 bovine chromosomes (29 autosomes
and the X chromosome), albeit at relatively low resolution
with many markers not separated by observed recombination. Markers scored on at least one of the three independent
RH panels provided the basis to separate closely linked markers as well as place 9,850 additional markers that were not
represented in the linkage maps. Radiation hybrid data
included those used for the ILTX-2005 map scored on the
5,000 rad Illinois-Texas panel [28], the SIAG map scored on
a 7,000 rad panel [29], and the BovGen map [30] with markers scored on the 3,000 rad ComRad panel [51]. For this
work, additional markers scored on the ComRad panel are
also considered part of the BovGen data set. These include
Illumina BeadStation-scored SNP [50] identified from the
bovine genome sequencing initiative, and a number of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. The UAMU
linkage map SNPs are a subset of the sequencing project SNPs
scored on the ComRad RH panel.

ordered. Markers were matched across data sets using a combination of marker names, primer sequence, and primer
sequence alignments to the same bovine sequence or EST
cluster. Markers with identical primer sequences were considered to be the same, regardless of marker name. Additional
matches between data sets were obtained using e-PCR [56] to
align primer pairs with GenBank bovine and Bos taurus Gene
Index sequences (BtGI, version 11) [84]. Primer pairs that
matched the same sequence, with no more than one mismatch or gap, were considered to represent the same marker,
as were markers matching different ESTs from the same Bos
taurus UniGene (NCBI Bos taurus UniGene, build 68) [85].
Name-based matches were made only between those markers
with identical names and no sequence or mapping evidence to
the contrary (markers without primer sequence but sharing
the same name and chromosome assignment were matched,
and markers sharing the same name but having different
primer sequences were not matched unless the different
primers hit the same sequence). Matches were checked for
consistency with original chromosome assignments from the
independent maps. When markers assigned to different chromosomes in the independent maps were matched, data used
to match markers, results of two-point analyses, and comparative human alignments were examined. Matches were preserved, and markers reassigned, when two-point linkage
supported reassignment. Sequence- and name-based
matches were ignored if two-point linkage supported the
original assignments. Comparative alignments were used to
break ties, when two-point LOD scores and distances for a
marker indicated equally likely assignment to two or more
chromosomes, and the comparative alignment supported
assignment to one of those chromosomes.

comment

Contig sizes were estimated from fingerprint data with an
algorithm that compared the restriction fragments of overlapping clone pairs in the canonical clone set for each contig.
Canonical clones are the set of non-redundant overlapping
clones spanning a contig that each represent a unique complement of restriction fragments in their fingerprint, such
that the remaining non-canonical clones within the contig are
subsumed by the canonical clones (that is, all the restriction
fragments in the fingerprint of a non-canonical clone are
completely represented in one of the canonical clones). The
unique fragments for each canonical clone were identified,
and their sizes were summed to estimate the overall size of the
contigs. Specifically, the algorithm performed the following
for each contig: first, sum the sizes of all the fragments in the
left-most canonical clone in the contig to create a cumulative
size estimate; second, identify the next canonical clone immediately to the right and identify its unique fragments (any
fragments not shared with the previous canonical clone to the
left or the next canonical clone to the right), then add the sizes
of these unique fragments to the cumulative size estimate;
third, repeat step 2 until all unique fragments in the canonical
clones have been identified and summed to give a total size
estimate for the contig. Fragments were considered to be the
same if their calculated standard mobilities were within ten
mobility units of each other.

polish and flips. Confidence intervals surrounding marker
placement were approximated from polish applied to the final
order. Cytogenetic band, cM and Kbp positions for each
marker were computed with a modification of the ldbf program [55], using the native unit (cM and cR) maps in the most
likely consensus order determined from the three different
starting orders.

Marker, clone and genomic sequence alignment
Markers placed on the composite map were associated with
BAC clones in the fingerprint map via direct alignment of
marker and BAC end- or sub-clone sequences, and indirect
alignment of marker and BAC sequences to the same WGS
contig sequence. Direct marker-clone, and indirect markerWGS-clone alignments were identified by e-PCR and BLAT.
Alignments of primer pairs against BAC clone and WGS by ePCR allowed no more than one mismatch or gap. BLAT was
used to align marker sequences with BES and WGS contigs,
and to align BAC clones with WGS contigs. BLAT alignments
required exact matches and a bit score of at least 100, 99.5%

identity with a score of 250, or 99% identity and a score of
500. Direct matches were identified from markers matching
BAC clone sequences, and indirect matches from markers and
BAC clones matching the same WGS contig.
Marker sequence used for BLAT alignments was obtained
from GenBank when information to associate the marker
with a GenBank accession number was available, or from STS
sequence supplied with the marker. When only primer
sequences were available, the e-PCR results used to match
markers across data sets were also used to construct an
amplimer sequence. Sequence between primer locations was
extracted from each e-PCR match, and assembled with Phrap
(version 0.990329) [86]. This assembled sequence was used
to represent the marker only when the Phrap assembly
resulted in a single contig.

alignments to match markers across linkage and RH data sets

refereed research

Direct marker-clone and indirect marker-WGS-clone alignments were used to identify the set of markers from the current composite map with consistent, unambiguous
alignments to the BAC map. The order of these markers on
the BAC map was used to seed the ordering process for each
chromosome. A map of the markers matching the BAC map
was computed, followed by iterative polish and flips to reorder markers in that set. Markers assigned to the chromosome,
but not matching BAC clones, were added with buildfw, and
a final BAC-assisted order obtained from iterative polish and
flips after all assigned markers were included.

reports

Associations between markers and clones were used to assess
and refine chromosome assignments and the order of fingerprint contigs, where the contigs were initially assigned and
ordered along chromosomes using end-sequence alignments
to human sequence and bovine-human comparative maps
[29,47]. For each fingerprint contig containing clones
associated with markers mapped on a preliminary composite
map, marker positions unambiguously linked to a single contig were identified, and uninterrupted runs of marker positions associated with a single contig were determined. Marker
positions were regressed on corresponding clone position
within a contig for the run with the greatest number of markers to predict clone position on the composite map. Predicted
positions of clones within contigs linked to the composite
map by a single marker position were set to that marker position. Discrepancies between predicted clone positions, and
composite map positions of markers linked to those clones
were identified. Fingerprints of clones linked to the observed
discrepancies were examined, and clones were rearranged to
eliminate discrepancies only if the rearrangement was supported by fingerprint data. The preliminary composite map
used included SIAG-USDA linkage data, and RH markers and
vectors from SIAG, the second generation Illinois-Texas map
[47], and a subset of the BovGen data used for the current
map.
