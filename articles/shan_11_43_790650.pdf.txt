43 genes support the lungfish-coelacanth
grouping related to the closest living relative of
tetrapods with the Bayesian method under the
coalescence model
Yunfeng Shan1*, Robin Gras1,2

Abstract
Background: Since the discovery of the “living fossil” in 1938, the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) has generally
been considered to be the closest living relative of the land vertebrates, and this is still the prevailing opinion in
most general biology textbooks. However, the origin of tetrapods has not been resolved for decades. Three
principal hypotheses (lungfish-tetrapod, coelacanth-tetrapod, or lungfish-coelacanth sister group) have been
proposed.
Findings: We used the Bayesian method under the coalescence model with the latest published program
(Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees, or BEST) to perform a phylogenetic analysis for seven relevant taxa and 43
nuclear protein-coding genes with the jackknife method for taxon sub-sampling. The lungfish-coelacanth sister
group was consistently reconstructed with the Bayesian method under the coalescence model in 17 out of 21
taxon sets with a Bayesian posterior probability as high as 99%. Lungfish-tetrapod was only inferred from BCLS and
BACLS. Neither coelacanth-tetrapod nor lungfish-coelacanth-tetrapod was recovered out of all 21 taxon sets.
Conclusions: Our results provide strong evidence in favor of accepting the hypothesis that lungfishes and
coelacanths form a monophyletic sister-group that is the closest living relative of tetrapods. This clade was
supported by high Bayesian posterior probabilities of the branch (a lungfish-coelacanth clade) and high taxon
jackknife supports.

Background
The origin of land vertebrates (tetrapods) has not been
fully resolved. Since the discovery of the “living fossil” in
1938, Latimeria chalumnae [1,2], the last discovered
surviving species of a lineage of lobe-finned fish, has
generally been considered the closest living relative of
the land vertebrates, the missing link between aquatic
and terrestrial vertebrates. This is still the prevailing
opinion in most general biology textbooks [3]. The origin of tetrapods always has considerable popular interest
in public and academic fields since the legendary fish
discovery. Three hypotheses have been proposed for the
phylogenetic relationship: e.g., lungfish-tetrapod

(Hypothesis 1, Figure 1a), coelacanth-tetrapod (Hypothesis 2, Figure 1b), or, lungfish-coelacanth sister group
(Hypothesis 3, Figure 1c). The coelacanth-lungfish-tetrapod trichotomy (Figure 1d) is not generally considered a
hypothesis.
Based on comparative morphological and paleontological studies, the lungfish were historically thought to be
the closest living relatives of tetrapods [4,5], but the coelacanths were purported to have that claim [1,6,7] since
its discovery in 1938, whereas the coelacanths and lungfish sister group (Tree III) was also proposed [8-10].
Over the last two decades, single genes and whole
mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced with a
view to inferring phylogenetic relationships. Lungfish as
the closest relatives of tetrapods were supported by single genes [11-15] and mitochondrial whole genomes
[16-19], the coelacanth as the closest living sister group

of tetrapods was preferred by single genes [20], and coelacanth-lungfish sister group relationship was suggested
by the single gene [13] and the mitochondrial whole
genome [17,19], while an unresolved coelacanth-lungfish-tetrapod trichotomy was shown by the 12 S rRNA
gene [12].
Recently, this question was reinvestigated. The result
using 44 genes with the concatenation genome-scale
approach [21] was an unresolved trichotomy. Another
from two recombination activating genes (Rag1 and
Rag2) supported lungfish and not the coelacanth as the
closest living relative of the tetrapods [15]. Our previous
study provided strong evidence in favor of rejecting
Hypothesis 2, but weak evidence to support Hypothesis
3 based on 43 genes with three common phylogenetic
methods and three genome-scale approaches [22,23].
Although many morphological, paleontological and
molecular phylogenetic studies have attempted to
resolve this question, the results have so far not discovered unequivocal evidence as to whether either the coelacanth or the lungfish is the closest living relatives of
tetrapods or that both lineages are equally closely
related to tetrapods. Therefore, the origin of tetrapods
continues to be debated and still is one of the longest
standing major questions in vertebrate evolution.

BEST implements a Bayesian hierarchical model to
jointly estimate gene trees and the species tree from
multilocus sequences [24]. The procedure applies the
same substitution models as those used in traditional
phylogenetics and coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from species trees to gene trees and from
gene trees to sequence data, forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees, species trees and
species divergence times simultaneously [25]. The model
is based on the assumption that gene trees are correlated due to being come from a single species tree and
therefore should be estimated jointly [25]. It provides a
new approach for estimating species phylogenies within
the popular Bayesian phylogenetic program MrBayes
[26]. BEST was applied to a prominent yeast phylogenomics data set and have shown that it is more efficient
in estimating the species tree than concatenation is in
estimating the gene tree [27]. With simulation data, analysis of the same DNA sequences by concatenation
using either Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods
reconstructed the wrong tree with high confidence,
whereas the BEST analysis converged on the correct
tree with high confidence [27].
To provide more evidence to resolve the origin of tetrapods, we used here the Bayesian method under the

Shan and Gras BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:49
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/49

coalescence model with a newly published program
(Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees, or BEST) for genome-scale phylogenetic analysis [24-27] and the jackknife method for taxon sub-sampling to analyze all 43
nuclear protein-encoding genes that are currently available in Genbank, having considered the results of our
previous study [23] using three other genome-scale
approaches with all three commonly used phylogenetic
methods together. Seven taxa include Mammal (M),
Bird (B), Amphibian (A), Coelacanth (C), Lungfish (L),
Ray-finned Fish (R), and Shark (S).

Materials and methods
Sequence Collection

The sequences of 43 nuclear protein-encoding genes were
downloaded from GenBank through the National Center
for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/ using the program SeqMiner.pl [28]. These 43 genes
were previously analyzed using the genome-scale approach
of concatenated genes; however, the sequence length of
some genes was different [Additional file 1: Supplemental
Table S1]. One gene (FSCN1) is omitted because some
taxa lack its sequences in GenBank. In order to compare
the results with the genome-scale concatenated multiple
gene approach [21], the same seven taxa were included:
Mammal, Bird, Amphibian, Coelacanth, Lungfish, Rayfinned Fish, and Shark. The species examined included
human (Homo sapiens), bird (Gallus gallus), amphibian
(Xenopus laevis), coelacanth (mostly Latimeria chalumnae,
with a few L. menadoensis), lungfish (mostly Protopterus
dolloi and P. aethiopicus) with a few Neoceratodus forsteri
and Lepidosiren paradoxa), ray-finned fishes (Danio rerio),
and cartilaginous fishes (represented by Scyliorhinus canicula) [21].
Phylogenetic Analysis

Sequences of an individual gene were aligned using
ClustalX with default settings [29]. All alignments of
single genes were manually edited to exclude insertions
or deletions and uncertain positions for further analysis.
The BEST phylogenetic analysis software (version 1.1)
with the Bayesian method under the coalescence [24]
was used for tree inference under the GTR + Γ+ I
model and four simultaneous Markov chains for 20 million generations, starting with random initial trees and
sampling every 2000 generations. The burnin value was
set to 100. The majority rule consensus tree was generated using the remaining trees with posterior probability
plotted on each node.
Taxon Jackknife Sub-sampling

We used a jackknife approach to sub-sample six, five
and four taxa from seven taxa with permutation and
combination. The debate over taxon sampling has not

terminated. On the one hand, the accuracy was
enhanced dramatically with the addition of taxa [30].
On the other hand, adding taxa can reduce accuracy
and increase the probability of distorting the tree topology [30]. Adding characters can always increase the
accuracy [30-32]. So, as many genes as possible should
be included. The sequence data of 43 genes that are all
currently available in GenBank were used in this study.
Sequence data sets are available upon request.
Chi-square Test

The statistically significant difference in the Bayesian
posterior probabilities for the branch of the lungfishcoelacanth or the taxon jackknife support averages
between the six-, five- and four-taxon sets was analyzed
by means of the chi-square test.

Results
Tree III was inferred with 90% Bayesian posterior probability of the branch of lungfish-coelacanth for seven
taxon set (Figure 2 and Table 1). Four of five six-taxon
sets recovered tree III with Bayesian posterior probabilities for the branch of lungfish-coelacanth ranging from
77 to 93%. The exception was MBCLRS, which recovered an alternative tree (Table 1). Seven of the nine
five-taxon sets inferred tree III, but BACLS recovered
tree I and ACLRS reconstructed an alternative tree.
Although BCLS recovered tree I, all the other five fourtaxon sets inferred tree III (Table 1).
Taxon jackknife support was 81.0% for tree III, 9.5%
for tree I or an alternative tree other than tree I - IV,
and zero for tree II and tree IV with the Bayesian
method under the coalescence model for all 21 taxon
sets (Table 1).
Bayesian posterior probabilities for the branch of lungfish-coelacanth were 85.0, 64.0, and 70.4% and taxon

jackknife support averages were 83.3, 77.8, and 80.0%
for the six-, five-, and four-taxon sets, respectively
(Table 1). The chi-square test showed no significant differences among the taxon sampling sets. The results
showed that taxon sampling had no significant effect on
phylogenetic inference for the taxon sets.

Discussion
Tree III is consistently reconstructed with the Bayesian
method under the coalescence model in 17 out of 21

taxon sets with a Bayesian posterior probability as high
as 99%. Tree I was inferred only from BCLS and
BACLS, and two alternative trees were recovered from
ACLRS and MBCLRS (Table 1). Therefore, we provide
strong evidence to support Hypothesis 3, namely that
coelacanths and lungfish form a monophyletic group
that is the phylogenetically closest living relatives of tetrapods (Tree III). Our results agree with those of other
studies in terms of the morphological, palaeontological
and molecular analyses below. The coelacanth and lungfish sister group relationship was supported by the single gene [13] and the whole mitochondrial genome [19],
and by the nuclear 28 S ribosomal RNA gene [17]. This
relationship was also proposed in comparative morphological and paleontological studies [8-10].
Recently, an investigation using 44 genes with a concatenation genome-scale approach showed an unresolved trichotomy [21]. Another result from two genes
supported lungfish and not the coelacanth as the closest
living relative of the tetrapods [15]. In our previous
study [22,23], tree II received significantly lower support
than tree I or tree III and, evidently, lower taxon jackknife probabilities with all the phylogenetic methods
and genome-scale approaches. The supports for tree III
were significantly higher than those for tree I for only
two out of 63 events, and taxon jackknife probabilities
for tree III were slightly higher than those for tree I
with MP, but the differences in supports and taxon jackknife probabilities between tree III and tree I are not as
obvious as those between tree II and tree III/I. Therefore, the results in our previous study provide strong
evidence to reject Hypothesis 2 that coelacanth is the
closest living relative of tetrapods, but only weak support for Hypothesis 3 based on phylogenetic analysis of
43 genes with those three common methods and those
three genome-scale approaches yet at that time [22,23].
Our results in this study also provide further strong evidence in favor of rejecting Hypothesis 2 because none
of 21 taxon sets recovers tree II. Recently major
palaeontological studies proposed that lungfishes are the
closest living relatives of the tetrapods or alternatively,
that coelacanths and lungfishes form a monophyletic sister group that is equally closely related to the tetrapods
[33,34]. The cause of this puzzle is the fact that the
divergence of coelacanth and lungfish happened over a
relatively short period within a small (20-30 millions
years) window in time around 400 million years ago
[3,5]. This results in little time and opportunity for lineage-specific molecular changes to happen, yet considerable time and opportunity for multiple and parallel
changes and their accumulation since the origin of these
two lineages [3]. For this challenging phylogenetic question, therefore, it was very difficult to achieve high resolution using ad hoc molecular phylogenetic methods

Shan and Gras BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:49
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/49

and algorithms given that the available sequence data set
of genes were currently very limited before the publication of the BEST program using the Bayesian method
under the coalescence model [24]. However, we would
like to point out that the species tree inferred from gene
trees using the BEST program achieves high resolution,
but is not always correct for all cases. The wrong species trees, such as those of ACLRS and MBCLRS, may
be recovered from gene trees (Table 1). Therefore, the
jackknife method for taxon sub-sampling is recommended to obtain further statistical confidence with
jackknife support values. Additionally, this approach is
newly published, it is not surprising that it has not been
used widely in its early stage compared with the popular
concatenation approach. Some caution should be kept.
However, its use is strongly encouraged based on our
study and other [27].

Conclusions
This study provides strong evidence in favor of accepting Hypothesis 3, namely that the lungfish and coelacanth form a monophyletic sister group and that the
sister group should be the phylogenetically closest living
relatives of tetrapods. These conclusions are supported
by high Bayesian posterior probabilities for the branch
(a lungfish-coelacanth clade) and high taxon jackknife
supports based on the genome-scale phylogenetic analysis of 43 genes using the latest program (BEST)
[24,25,27] with the Bayesian method under the coalescence model and the jackknife method for taxon
subsampling.
