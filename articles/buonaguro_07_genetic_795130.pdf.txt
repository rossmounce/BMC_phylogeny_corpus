Abstract
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is classified into genetic groups, subtypes and
sub-subtypes which show a specific geographic distribution pattern. The HIV-1 epidemic in Italy, as
in most of the Western Countries, has traditionally affected the Intra-venous drug user (IDU) and
Homosexual (Homo) risk groups and has been sustained by the genetic B subtype. In the last years,
however, the HIV-1 transmission rate among heterosexuals has dramatically increased, becoming
the prevalent transmission route. In fact, while the traditional risk groups have high levels of
knowledge and avoid high-risk practices, the heterosexuals do not sufficiently perceive the risk of
HIV-1 infection. This misperception, linked to the growing number of immigrants from nonWestern Countries, where non-B clades and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are prevalent,
is progressively introducing HIV-1 variants of non-B subtype in the Italian epidemic. This is in
agreement with reports from other Western European Countries.
In this context, the Italian HIV-1 epidemic is still characterized by low subtype heterogeneity and
represents a paradigmatic example of the European situation. The continuous molecular evolution
of the B subtype HIV-1 isolates, characteristic of a long-lasting epidemic, together with the
introduction of new subtypes as well as recombinant forms may have significant implications for
diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine development. The study and monitoring of the genetic evolution
of the HIV-1 represent, therefore, an essential strategy for controlling the local as well as global
HIV-1 epidemic and for developing efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Background
HIV-1 genetic subtypes
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates are classified in three groups:group M (main), a
group O (outlier) as well as a group N (non-M/non-O)
[1-3]. The group M, responsible for the majority of infections in the HIV-1 worldwide epidemic, can be further
subdivided into 10 recognized phylogenetic subtypes or

clades (A – K, excluding E, which is actually a CRF), which
are approximately equidistant from one another (Fig. 1).
HIV-1 phylogenetic classifications are currently based
either on nucleotide sequences derived from multiple sub
genomic regions (gag, pol and env) of the same isolates or
on full-length genome sequence analysis. This approach
has revealed virus isolates in which phylogenetic relations

HIV-1 epidemic in Italy
Injecting drug users (IDUs) have been the most affected
risk group during the first phase of the HIV epidemic in
Italy and the HIV-1 B subtype, in accordance with other
Western Countries, is the molecular form circulating
among IDUs [10]. However, the annual percentages of
AIDS cases reported in IDUs have gradually decreased to
32.3% in 2004 [11], in part as consequence of prevention
programs [12,13]. In parallel, the AIDS cases reported in
heterosexual individuals has continuously increased during the epidemic, becoming in 2004 the most prevalent
risk factor for AIDS (40.4%) (Fig. 3) [10]. Similarly, in
2005 heterosexual contact accounts for over half (55%) of
HIV infections newly diagnosed in the EU, nearly half
(46%) of them were diagnosed in immigrants/migrants,
primarily from sub-Saharan Africa, and most of these
infections were acquired outside the EU (EuroHIV, 2006).

with different subtypes switch along their genomes. These
inter-subtype recombinant forms are thought to have originated in individuals multiply infected with viruses of two
or more subtypes. This results in the generation of several
recombinants called "unique recombinant forms," or
URFs [4]. When an identical recombinant virus is identified in at least three epidemiologically unlinked people,
and is characterized by full-length genome sequencing, it
can be designated as circulating recombinant forms
(CRFs) [5-7]. The intra-genomic recombination appears
to be a very frequent event and the CRFs account for 18%
of incident infections in the global HIV-1 pandemic [8,9].
On a global scale, according to recent studies, the most
prevalent HIV-1 genetic forms are subtypes A, B, C and
CRF02_AG, with subtype C accounting for almost 50% of
all HIV-1 infections worldwide. In Europe, in particular,
subtype B is the circulating main genetic form, while subtype A viruses are predominant in east European countries
formerly constituting the Soviet Union, where they are
mainly transmitted among injecting drug users. Unlike all
the surrounding Countries, Romania is characterized by
an F subtype epidemic (Fig. 2).

More than 10% of heterosexual individuals diagnosed
with AIDS in Italy are either immigrants from endemic
regions for HIV-1 (6.87%) or their Italian partners
(3.03%). This epidemiological evidence, not considering
all the HIV-1 infections derived also from traveling
abroad, suggests that at least 10% of the viruses transmitted through heterosexual contacts could potentially
belong to non-B subtypes and CRFs. This has been
recently reported in other European Countries, with a
higher prevalence due to an older tradition of immigration waves and much tighter historical as well as economic links with countries endemic for HIV-1 infection
[14-22]
Molecular evolution of the B-clade env sequences in the
Italian epidemic
The biological relevance of genetic variations in the env
gene is due to the central role of the envelope protein in
the virus-host interaction. In particular, the V3 loop contains epitopes for strain-restricted neutralizing antibodies,
it is a major determinant for viral tropism and co-receptor
usage, and its orientation partially masks the CD4 and
chemokine receptor binding sites [23-31].

The analysis performed including the B-subtype Italian
sequences [32-45] has shown a progressive increase of
nucleotide divergence in this region, increasing from
9.2% between isolates identified in the late 80's [46], to
17.51% between isolates identified in the early 2000's
[33,45]. This closely resembles the expected evolution of
a region under a strong immunological pressure during a
long-lasting epidemic [45,47].
Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis performed on the
same C2-V3 env region (position 7001 to 7196 of HIV1HXB2) has shown the presence of an "Italian branch"
where the HIV-1 isolates are distributed into three major

clusters, each of them including several sub-clusters (Fig.
4). The 143 sequences derived from the different studies,
selecting one sequence per patient deposited at the Los
Alamos Database, do not form independent clusters and/
or sub-clusters but are rather found inter-dispersed in the
sub-clusters. This is likely due to the fact that the majority
of the samples have been identified in Italy during overlapping periods in the early 90's. The distribution pattern
of the sequences within the sub-clusters is not significantly associated to the risk factor for HIV-1 infection
(IVDU, homo- or heterosexuality), by nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0,096). Moreover, the B1 cluster
includes the majority of sequences identified in a broad
time range, while the B3 cluster is prevalently based on
recent sequences identified in our study. Moreover, as
shown in Fig. 4, Italian B clade variants do not cluster with
sequences from known "B clade-derived" CRFs.

Rate of amino acid substitution and codon usage in the Bclade V3 env sequences
The B clade C2-V3 env sequences identified during the
HIV-1 Italian epidemic have been subsequently analyzed
for the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions at each codon corresponding to the 35 aa
forming the V3 loop of the env gene. The analysis has
shown that very few codons (C1, R2, G17, G28, C35) are
characterized by no substitutions or synonymous substitutions only, indicating the absolute conservation of
those specific amino acid residues. In contrast, the vast
majority of codons are characterized by a higher percentage of non-synonymous substitutions leading to amino
acid changes. Nevertheless, the only residues found with a
frequency < 80% at specific positions in the crown of the
V3 loop are S11, N13, T22 and E25, although these do not
seem to influence the binding of the gp120-CD4 complex

to the CCR5 (Fig. 5). This is, in fact, mainly influenced by
substitutions in the stem of the loop [48].
Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop
show a significant uniform distribution in the HIV-1
sequences identified during the Italian epidemic, with the
exception of the T-to-A22 substitution (within the tip of
the loop) which is prevalent in the isolates identified in
the early 2000's.
The codon usage in the V3 region has been previously
associated with HIV-1 isolates identified in patients with
different risk factors. In particular, considering the second
glycine at the tip of the V3 loop, the GGG codon has been
associated with the homosexual risk group and the GGC
codon with the IDU risk group [43,49-51]. In Italian B
subtype sequences, the GGC codon is strongly associated
with intra-venous transmission (p < 0.015), while the
GGG codon is strongly associated with sexual (homo and
hetero) transmission of HIV-1 (p < 0.007) (Fig. 6). The
striking segregation of the GGC and GGG codons in the
virus variants transmitted through different routes could
be the consequence of different selections, including viral
tropism, genetic bottlenecks or a founder effect.
Non-B-clade env sequences in Italian epidemic
So far, during the entire HIV-1 epidemic in Italy, only
seven non-B clade env sequences have been described,
identified in heterosexual individuals (either immigrants
from sub-Saharan Africa or their Italian partners) [44,45];
[33,34]. In particular, a very recent near-full length
sequence analysis has shown that a HIV-1 isolate originally classified as A is actually close to the A3 sub-subtype
and does not cluster in any of the known subtypes. It

needs to be confirmed with the identification of at least
two additional related isolates in unlinked individuals
[52].
Molecular evolution of the B-clade protease sequences in
Italian epidemic
The sequences relative to HIV-1 pol gene, and the protease
region in particular, have been extensively analyzed and
collected only from the year 2000, consequent to appearance of viral isolates resistant to protease inhibitors (PI),
introduced as a component of anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) combinations. This effect has made obvious the
need to evaluate the resistant mutants to guide the choice
of drug combinations in heavily drug-treated HIV-1infected individuals as well as in recent treatment-naïve
seropositive individuals.

The nucleotide divergence of the protease region during
the HIV-1 epidemic in Italy has been evaluated including
all the B-subtype Italian sequences from the published
reports [53-64]. The analysis, unlike the analyses of the V3
env region, has shown a rather constant nucleotide divergence in this region (6.83% – 7.68%) over the 2000–2006
period. These results confirm that, also in a long-lasting

epidemic, the pol genes (and the protease in particular) are
not driven to genetic change by immunologic pressure.
"Pharmacologic" pressure, instead, plays a significant role
in the evolution of the protease gene by inducing the constant appearance and spread of mutant variants with
degrees of drug resistance [65]. In this perspective, the
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions have
been evaluated for the protease sequences described in
Italy, showing the presence of "hot spot" in the 99 protease codons, where the frequency of non-synonymous
substitutions has increased over the 2000–2006 period
with the presence of PI drugs in the ART combination. In
particular, sequences identified in ART-treated groups
[54-56] showed a > 2.5 fold-increase in the frequency of
non-synonymous substitutions at codons strongly associated with PI drug resistance, compared to sequences identified in a naïve group [62] (Fig. 7).

The phylogenetic analysis performed on the protease
region of the HIV-1 B-subtype Italian sequences showed,
as for the env region, an "Italian branch" including three
major clusters, each of them formed by several sub-clusters (Fig. 8). Also for the protease gene, as for the env C2V3 region, sequences derived from the different studies do
not form independent clusters and/or sub-clusters but are
rather found inter-dispersed in the tree. Moreover, a distribution pattern based on the risk factor for HIV-1 infection
(IVDU, homo- or heterosexuality) could not be assessed
due to undisclosed demographic information. It is to be
underscored that, as result of this phylogenetic analysis,
the sequence 3193_1620A (Accession # DQ348068),
deposited as B-subtype isolate [56], showed a strong phylogenetic link to the F1 subtype, suggesting that a revised
classification of this isolate in the Los Alamos DataBase is
appropriate.

Distribution of codons in risk groups. The distribution
of the four codons encoding the second glycine residue in
the crown of the env gene V3 loop (GPGRAFYT) has been

with different risk practices.

The phylogenetic analyses, therefore, strongly suggest
that, as for the env region, the protease region of the pol
gene in HIV-1 B subtypes in Italy are derived from three
main molecular ancestors, which have continuously
evolved and spread among infected individuals during the
epidemic.
Non-B-clade protease sequences in Italian epidemic
The non-B clade protease sequences, described in Italy over
the 2000–2006 period [52,55,58,59,63,66,67], show
intra-clade nucleotide divergences ranging from 3,34%
(CRF01_AE) to 8,74% (F1), which are comparable to the

divergence values observed for the B-clade sequences.
Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis shows a limited evolution for each subtype, suggesting a recent introduction
into Italy, although the limited number of isolates does
not allow significant strong correlations to be made (Fig.
9).
Gag sequences in Italian epidemic
Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gag gene has not been
a priority over the HIV-1 epidemic in Italy, and a very limited number of B as well as non-B clade sequences have
been described [44,45,52,68]. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis confirms the original subtype classification
of the isolates and shows a distribution of the Italian Bsubtype in different sub-clusters, where the sequences
deriving from the different studies are found interspersed
(Fig. 10). The lack of "cross-epidemic" sequences, however, does not allow inferences on phylogenetic evolution
in gag.

Concluding remarks
The B clade remains predominant and is circulating
among all risk groups in the Italian epidemic, as observed
all across Western European Countries [69]. Nevertheless,
the structural genes of B subtype HIV-1 variants show a

Authors' contributions
continuous spectrum of genetic diversification, although
the currently circulating viruses appear to derive from a
few early "founders". The introduction and the spread of
non-B subtype HIV-1 isolates in the Italian epidemic, in
contrast, appear to be still limited. In particular, as
reported in other Western European countries, it is
strongly associated with heterosexual transmission
between local and immigrant/migrant partners. In this
regard, it has to be mentioned that the general strategy of
sequencing and performing phylogenetic analyses only
on the env sub-genomic region, pursued in Italy and
worldwide for many years, could have resulted in missing
the identification of novel CRFs early in the Italian epidemic.
The Italian HIV-1 epidemic, therefore, represents a paradigmatic example of the European situation, being still
characterized by low subtype heterogeneity. However, the
slow introduction and diffusion of non-B subtypes in the
population could progressively change the overall scenario and drive the need of adapting the diagnostic and
treatment strategies currently used in European Countries.
