by the complete mitochondrial genome of
Symsagittifera roscoffensis

Abstract
Background: Acoels are simply organized unsegmented worms, lacking hindgut and anus. Several publications
over recent years challenge the long-held view that acoels are early offshoots of the flatworms. Instead a basal
position as sister group to all other bilaterian animals was suggested, mainly based on molecular evidence. This led
to the view that features of acoels might reflect those of the last common ancestor of Bilateria, and resulted in
several evo-devo studies trying to interpret bilaterian evolution using acoels as a proxy model for the “Urbilateria”.
Results: We describe the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a member of the Acoela,
Symsagittifera roscoffensis. Gene content and circular organization of the mitochondrial genome does not
significantly differ from other bilaterian animals. However, gene order shows no similarity to any other
mitochondrial genome within the Metazoa. Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated alignments of amino acid
sequences from protein coding genes support a position of Acoela and Nemertodermatida as the sister group to
all other Bilateria. Our data provided no support for a sister group relationship between Xenoturbellida and Acoela
or Acoelomorpha. The phylogenetic position of Xenoturbella bocki as sister group to or part of the deuterostomes
was also unstable.
Conclusions: Our phylogenetic analysis supports the view that acoels and nemertodermatids are the earliest
divergent extant lineage of Bilateria. As such they remain a valid source for seeking primitive characters present in
the last common ancestor of Bilateria. Gene order of mitochondrial genomes seems to be very variable among
Acoela and Nemertodermatida and the groundplan for the metazoan mitochondrial genome remains elusive. More
data are needed to interpret mitochondrial genome evolution at the base of Bilateria.

Background
Acoels are marine, soft-bodied, unsegmented worms
without hindgut and anus - the mouth opens to a central digestive parenchyma, a gut lumen is absent. Acoels
move with their multiciliated epidermis although many
are ‘surprisingly muscular’ [1]. Most of the species are
free-living, some are ectocommensals. Several species
from the subtaxa Sagittiferidae and Convolutidae form
obligate symbioses with green algae [2], making them
functional photoautotroph organisms. In traditional systematics the Acoela were considered to be representatives of the Platyhelminthes, due to their ‘flatworm-like’

features such as the ciliated epidermis, the frontal organ,
neoblasts, hermaphroditic reproduction, biflagellate
sperm, and a lack of body cavities (acoelomate structure), hindgut and anus [3,4]. Based on the ultrastructural characteristics of cilia, and the hypothesized
reduction of gut and protonephridia, Ehlers (1985) combined Acoela with Nemertodermatida to form the Acoelomorpha. In his system the Catenulida form the sister
group to all other Platyhelminthes (Euplatyhelminthes),
which comprise the sister groups Acoelomorpha and
Rhabditophora. However, the monophyly of the Platyhelminthes was soon questioned because of the weakness of these morphological characters [5,6]. Subsequent
ultrastructural studies have demonstrated numerous differences between Acoelomorpha and Platyhelminthes,
particularly amongst characters once thought to be

homologous. For example, frontal organ morphology
[6,7], sperm ultrastructure [8], and patterns in the nervous and muscular systems [9-11] all demonstrate the
uniqueness of acoelomorphs.
Early molecular systematic studies using ribosomal
RNA genes strongly suggested that Acoela and Nemertodermatida were distinctly separate from the Platyhelminthes [12-14]; this result remains coherent even in
the light of more taxa, more sequence data and more
sophisticated models of phylogenetic analysis [15]. In
the last 10 years several phylogenetic studies with molecular sequences have suggested a phylogenetic position
of acoels as sister group to all other Bilateria [16-19].
Studies with broad taxon sampling of both Acoela and
Nemertodermatida supported paraphyly of Acoelomorpha, with Acoela forming the sister group to the
remaining Bilateria (Nemertodermatida + Nephrozoa)
[19-21]. Presuming a position as sister group to all other
Bilateria and considering the comparably simple body
organisation, the morphological features of acoels may
provide insights concerning the bodyplan of the ‘last
common bilaterian ancestor’ [18], the ancestor of extant
acoels, protostomes and deuterostomes [22]. Thus,
acoels came into the focus of studies in evolutionary
developmental biology as a possible window into the
deep past of bilaterians [23-27].
In spite of these advances there is still controversy
about the phylogenetic position of Acoela, and at the
same time Nemertodermatida. Despite overwhelming
molecular evidence against a platyhelminth affinity,
some authors discuss the stem cell system of Acoela
and Rhabditophora as a potential synapomorphy of
these taxa [28]. However, data about stem cells from
other invertebrate taxa are very sparse, so this character
is in need of a broad comparative study. Recent phylogenomic studies do not recover platyhelminth affinities
for Acoela, but show quite different results due to the
varying amount of genes and taxa covered. A phylogenomic analysis of EST data from Isodiametra pulchra
[29] found no relevant nodal support for any sister
group relation. However, the best tree from this analysis
clustered I. pulchra together with the deuterostomes.
Another EST study, including the acoel species Neochildia fusca and S. roscoffensis also failed to support any
convincing relationship with another metazoan phylum
or lineage [30]. Thus, the authors omitted acoels from
subsequent analyses due to their low leaf stability.
Finally, a recent increase in taxon sampling incorporated
in the latter study, with additional sampling of acoels
and including nemertodermatids, supported Acoelomorpha (Acoela + Nemertodermatida) as a monophylum
with bootstrap support of 70% and 90% in two datasets
of different sizes [31]. Acoelomorpha were the sister
group to Xenoturbella in that study, but with only

moderate bootstrap support from one of the two analysed datasets. Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha together
formed the sister group to all other Bilateria (= Nephrozoa), once again with merely moderate nodal support.
To evaluate the phylogenetic position of acoels using
an independent set of molecular data we present the
first complete sequence of a mitochondrial genome of a
member of the Acoela, Symsagittifera roscoffensis (Graff,
1891). We describe gene content and tRNA secondary
structure, compare the mitochondrial gene order to
other taxa and show the results of a phylogenetic analysis with sequence alignments from mitochondrial protein-coding genes.

Results and discussion
Organisation of the genome and genes

The circular, double-stranded mitochondrial genome of
S. roscoffensis consists of 14803 bp (Fig. 1, table 1). It
contains two rRNA- and twelve protein-coding genes.
The gene for atp8, which is normally also present in
bilaterian mt genomes, is missing. This gene is also
absent in the mitochondrial genomes of Platyhelminthes,
Chaetognatha and almost all nematodes (except Trichinella spiralis). Thus there seems to be a tendency to
lose atp8 in several unrelated taxa. We identified 20
tRNA genes and determined their putative secondary
structures (Fig. 2). Despite a careful software search and
inspection by eye, no sequence resembling the genes for
trnL1 and trnL2 could be detected except within other
genes. Two candidate positions for trnL1 and trnL2 are
in nad5 (5778-5841; reverse direction) and in rrnL
(8131-8201), respectively (Fig. 2). Amongst the tRNA
genes, one loop of the typical cloverleaf structure is
absent in some cases: trnS1 and trnD lack the DHUstem. A missing DHU- stem in trnS1 is typical for all
parasitic flatworms and many other Metazoa [32,33].
The TψC-stem is missing in trnA, -H, -I, -M, -T, -E and
-Y. The majority of the tRNA genes show either mismatches of one to several nucleotides and/or shortened
stems and enlarged loops, respectively (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial genes are transcribed from both strands, with
cox1-3, atp6, lrRNA, srRNA, nad6 and nad4, as well as
trnT, -F, -Y, -V, -N, -H, -E, -K, -A, -R, -G, -S1, -S2 and
-M being transcribed from the plus-strand, the remaining ones from the minus-strand. Thirty, mostly short,
non-coding regions can be found, ranging from one to
137 bp in length. None of these regions is significantly
more AT-rich compared to the complete genome. Thus,
a putative control region [34] could not easily be determined at first sight. The entire genome has a high A+T
content of 75.3% and overall nucleotide frequencies of
38.6% A, 36.7% T, 12.8% G and 11.9% C. AT-skew
[(A-T)/(A+T)]- and GC-skew [(G-C)/(G+C)] [35] of the
whole plus-strand sequence are both close to zero (AT:

0.02; GC: 0.05), so there is no conspicuous strandasymmetry in nucleotide frequency as in many other
metazoan mt genomes [36]. High A+T content is a typical feature of nuclear ribosomal genes of Acoela, and it
has been suggested a possible factor affecting phylogenetic resolution of these worms amongst the Metazoa
[15], similarly to the acoels’ highly truncated and modified rRNA genes.
Overlaps between genes were not detected, except for
the remaining possibility that trnL1 and trnL2 are positioned within nad5 and rrnL, respectively. All protein
genes terminate with the codon TAA, except for cox3
ending with TAG. Existing start codons are more

variable: ATT is found in cytb, nad3, cox2 and cox3;
nad1 and nad4 start with ATG; atp6 begins with ATA
and nad6 with ATC. Only cox1 with GGT and nad2
with CAT are exceptions from the commonly used start
codons in mitochondrial genomes. Another uncommon
feature is a repeat region of 42 bp found in nad6 (5′
TGA GAA ATT TAC AAT CAA ATT TTA ACT ATT
TCT CCT AGA TTT 3′).
Gene order

The gene order found in S. roscoffensis shows no clear
similarity with any other mitochondrial gene order published to date. Fig. 3 shows a comparison between

S. roscoffensis, Paratomella rubra, Nemertoderma westbladi and Microstomum lineare [17], Fasciola hepatica
[37], Xenoturbella bocki [38-40], and the putative bilaterian ground pattern [41]. Even the partial genome of
P. rubra [17], another member of the Acoela, differs
completely from our data. Both organisms share merely
the fact that rrnS and rrnL are not adjacent, but separated by one (S. roscoffensis) and four (P. rubra) proteinencoding genes, respectively. This feature was also
found in the nemertodermatid species Nemertoderma
westbladi [17]. The ancestral state is supposed to be a
separation only by trnV [41], a feature found in many
metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Conserved gene
blocks, which are shared with other taxa, could not be

identified in S. roscoffensis. In addition to visual comparison of genome maps, we analyzed gene order data with
CREx [42], determining the number of common intervals. This means the number of “blocks” with the same
set of genes, regardless of their order inside a “block”.
We compared only gene orders of protein-coding and
ribosomal RNA genes, as tRNAs are known to be subject to more frequent gene translocation than the larger
genes. The result (Additional file 1, Fig. S1) shows overall low numbers of common intervals for comparison of
S. roscoffensis with any of the other gene orders (0-18,
whereas the maximum number of possible common
intervals is 176). However, although not significant, the
highest numbers (16-18) are obtained in comparison

with the putative deuterostome ground pattern and with
Xenoturbella bocki (which differ only by the relative
position of nad6), while the lowest number was
obtained in comparisons to platyhelminth gene orders
(Fasciola: 2, Schistosoma: 0). We also determined breakpoint distances between these taxa, but these results
were even less meaningful for S. roscoffensis (Additional
file 1, Fig. S1).

Phylogenetic analysis

Initial Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses with evolutionary models using
site-homogenous substitution matrices derived from
mitochondrial amino acid alignments (mtREV, mtZOA),
yielded poor resolution of the phylogenetic position of
acoels. It is well known that analyses of mitochondrial
amino acid alignments on higher taxonomic levels suffer

westbladi (Nemertodermatida) and Microstomum lineare (Rhabditophora), as well as to the complete sequence of Fasciola hepatica (Trematoda),
Xenoturbella bocki (Xenoturbellida) and the putative bilaterian ground pattern.

from two major problems: (a) the taxa may strongly
vary in amino acid composition, which hampers the
usefulness of a fixed substitution matrix, and (b) accelerated substitution rates in some fast-evolving taxa,
leading to long-branch attraction artifacts. A few
recent approaches aim to handle these problems more
appropriately. In large datasets the empirical site-

heterogeneous CAT mixture model [43] is superior to
all site-homogenous amino acid matrix models in avoiding long-branch attraction [44]. In addition, changes in
model parameters for parts of the tree will be applied
empirically using the “breakpoint” (BP) approach in
combination with the CAT model [45]. A recent study
demonstrated the usefulness of the CAT-BP model by

Mwinyi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:309
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/309

placing the long-branching Tunicata together with Acrania and Vertebrata as Chordata, while other model settings were not successful in this respect [46]. We set up
a dataset of 50 species, including representative members of all phyla, among them long-branching taxa like
Platyhelminthes and Nematoda. We ran four MCMC
chains with NH-PhyloBayes and the CAT-BP option.
Two chains converged with each other twice, each
favoring different topologies with respect to acoels. In
both variants Acoela and Nemertodermatida were supported as sister groups, with significant support values
(Bayesian posterior probabilities equal or above 0.95).
The first topology, recovered from two out of four independent chains (Fig. 4) shows significant support (1.0)
for Acoela and Nemertodermatida forming the sister
group to all other Bilateria (0.95). Ecdysozoa excluding
nematodes (1.0) as well as Lophotrochozoa + Nematoda
+ Chaetognatha (1.0) and Deuterostomia + Xenoturbella
(1.0) are significantly supported.
The other topology, with small differences represented
in the two other chains, found no resolution at the base
of Bilateria (Fig. 5). Instead there is a polytomy of five
taxa: Xenoturbella, Acoela + Nemertodermatida, Ambulacraria, Chordata and the protostomes. In the best tree
Xenoturbella clusters with Acoela + Nemertodermatida,
but there is no significant support for this group (0.76
and 0.92, respectively).
Due to these findings and the preliminary analyses we
suspected that it was predominantly Xenoturbella which
had an unstable position in the phylogenetic trees.
Therefore we conducted additional analyses with a dataset without Xenoturbella, and a second analysis without
Acoela and Nemertodermatida. In both variants four
independent chains were run. In all four chains with
Xenoturbella omitted, Acoela and Nemertodermatida
form a monophylum which is the sister group to the
remaining Bilateria (with significant support in three of
the four chains; additional file 1, Fig. S2). In the analysis
without Acoela and Nemertodermatida, Xenoturbella
was found either as sister to Deuterostomia (with support values of 0.65 and 0.99) or as sister to Ambulacraria (with support values of 0.87 and 1.0)(Additional
file 1, Fig. S3). Thus, in the absence of acoels Xenoturbella has a more unstable position in the bilaterian tree
than acoels have in the absence of Xenoturbella. Acoels
remain a critically important taxon to place within the
Metazoa.

Conclusions
Concluding discussion

Mitochondrial gene order of the complete mitochondrial
genome of the acoel S. roscoffensis is highly divergent
from that of other bilaterian animals, including the partial mitochondrial genome of Paratomella rubra. Even

Page 7 of 14

computational approaches of gene order comparison
like minimal breakpoint analysis and common interval
analysis did not favour any affinity of S. roscoffensis to
another taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial
amino acid sequences give support for acoels forming a
clade with nemertodermatids. But the limited available
dataset representing the Nemertodermatida gives this
result a rather preliminary nature. The dataset of
Nemertoderma westbladi is incomplete as it consists of
sequences from only three complete and two partial
genes, thus covering only 34.8% of the final alignment.
For a better evaluation of monophyly versus paraphyly
of Acoelomorpha we are in need of more complete
mitochondrial genome sequences from Nemertodermatida and Acoela.
Altogether we see more evidence for a position of
Acoela and Nemertodermatida branching off early
from the bilaterian tree rather than being grouped
with deuterostomes or protostomes. The position of
Xenoturbella cannot be fixed with this dataset, but its
affinity to deuterostomes is greater than to Acoela
and/or Nemertoderma.
Our trees also demonstrate limitations of the CAT-BP
model with the bilaterian mitochondrial protein dataset.
Nematoda are still clustering with the similarly longbranched Platyhelminthes and Syndermata, instead of
forming a monophylum with other ecdysozoans (in this
case arthropods, a priapulid and an onychophoran).
Almost all other molecular datasets support Ecdyszoa
(including Nematoda), so this must be an artifact probably due to selection. A similar problem is described
from snakes, where selection seems to act on mitochondrial protein-complexes under special physiological conditions [47]. The long branches in the bilaterian tree are
found in both parasitic and in free-living species of
nematodes and platyhelminths. Thus, a parasitic life
style does not seem to contribute to this accelerated
evolutionary change.
If Acoela and Nemertodermatida represent ancient
clades which split off early from the bilaterian tree,
while Xenoturbella splits off later than these two, probably as sister group of the deuterostomes [38,40], then
we can easily interpret morphological features shared by
both as plesiomorphic character states, shared with the
last common ancestor of Bilateria. As Telford [48]
noted, Acoela and Xenoturbella share the following features: an acoelomate bodyplan with ventral mouth and
absence of anus [1]; a unique tapering shelf at the ciliary
tip and other similarities in the ciliary rootlets [49]; the
nervous system is non-centralized and intra-epidermal
in some Acoela and in Xenoturbella [50]. Recently,
Nielsen [51] pointed out that the genomes of Xenoturbella and acoels have a significantly reduced Hox gene
complement [25,26,52]. The more complex set of hox

genes in the remaining bilaterians would be a valuable
apomorphic character supporting Nephrozoa excl. Xenoturbella, a topology as in Fig. 5 (noting that there is
only insufficient data from Nemertodermatida).
But this plesiomorphic feature cannot support a relationship between Xenoturbella and acoels. If Xenoturbella is part of the deuterostomes (as suggested by the
tree in Fig. 4), the hox complement of Xenoturbella
must be secondarily reduced, as there are many similarities in the hox complement of the remaining deuterostome and protostome taxa. Nuclear genome data of the
complete hox clusters seem to be indispensible for a
comprehensive evaluation of the evolution of hox genes
at the base of Bilateria.
With regard to comparative analysis of mitochondrial
genomes, especially gene order, more data are definitely
needed, e.g. complete mitochondrial genome sequences
from more than one acoel species, since the comparison
of S. roscoffensis and P. rubra has shown that gene order
in acoels seem to differ radically. Thus, single “representative” species are by no means sufficient to characterise
or represent taxa [53]. Similarly, nemertodermatid genomes also require further and exhaustive evaluations.
There is still no complete mitochondrial sequence of
this group available, preventing meaningful, genomebased phylogenetic analyses.

Specimen, DNA extraction, PCR and cloning

S. roscoffensis specimens were provided by Xavier Bailly
and were sampled close to the Station Biologique de
Roscoff (France). All analyses were conducted with
individuals preserved in 100% ethanol. DNA was isolated from whole animals (approx. 15-20 specimens
per approach) using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue 50 kit
(Qiagen, Germany) and following the manufacturer’s
guidelines. Based on previously published primers
for cox1 [54], cytb [55] and rrnL [56] initial genome
fragments were amplified and provided the basis for
specific primer design. Additional primary sequence
information came from the EST sets provided by the

Page 10 of 14

NCBI nucleotide database and NCBI trace archive. Primer suitability for both amplification and sequencing
was checked with the NetPrimer tool (Premier Biosoft
int.). Primer sequences and annealing temperatures are
given in table 2. General PCR setup was done in 50 μl
volumes (41.75 μl water, 5 μl 10× buffer, 0.25 μl Taq
polymerase (5 U/μl), 1 ml dNTP mixture, 1 μl template DNA, 1 μl primer mixture (10 μM each)). PCR
conditions were: 94°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for
30 sec, primer-specific annealing temperature for 1
min, 68°C for 1 min and a final extension step of 68°C
for 2 min. For standard PCR up to 3 kb we used the
Eppendorf 5-prime Taq polymerase and buffer
(5-prime, Germany). When we expected large PCR
fragments we used the Takara LA kit and set up PCRs
in 25 μl volumes (16.75 μl water, 2.5 μl buffer, 0.25 μl
Takara LA Taq polymerase, 4 μl dNTP mixture, 1 μl
template DNA, 0.5 μl primer mixture (10 μM each)).
In this case conditions were as above except for the
extension step of 72°C for 10 min at the end of each
cyclic PCR run. The amplified products were checked
on 1% TBE agarose gels and either purified directly
with the Nucleo Spin Extract II kit (Macherey &
Nagel, Germany) or the Blue Matrix PCR/DNA clean
up DNA Purification kit (EurX, Poland), respectively. If
gel purification was necessary, we used the QIAquick
Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). In some cases it was
required to PCR-clone some fragments for better
sequencing results. We then used the pGEM-T Easy
Vector system (Promega) and selected positive clones
by blue-white screening. Plasmid purification was performed with the Quantum Prep Plasmid mini kit
(BioRad), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sequencing and data assembly

Initial sequencing of amplified PCR fragments was carried out in the Berlin lab, using a CEQ™8000 capillary
sequencer (Beckmann-Coulter, USA) and the CEQ
DCTS Quick Start kit (Beckmann-Coulter) according to
the standard protocol, except for using half volumes for
setup of the sequencing reaction (10 μl). Final

sequencing was performed by the professional sequencing service of AGOWA (Berlin, Germany). Following
sequencing, BLAST programs on the NCBI server were
used to determine rRNA- and protein-encoding genes.
ClustalW and the cap-contig program, both integrated
in BioEdit version 7.0.5 [57], were used for sequence
assembly and comparison. The final sequence was compared with previously published mitogenomic sequences
of other taxa recovered from GenBank and OGRe [58].
For comparison and evaluation of gene boundaries we
built alignments from genes of several metazoan species
(predominantly including Platyhelminthes and other
Lophotrochozoa, as well as Xenoturbella bocki). In addition, our sequence was compared to the recently published EST data of S. roscoffensis from the NCBI trace
archive to get an independent confirmation of gene
boundaries. The putative secondary structures of all
tRNAs were either detected in a combined approach
using tRNAscan-SE [59], ARWEN [60] or by extensive
inspection of intergenic regions by eye. The complete
mt genome sequence of S. roscoffensis is deposited at
the NCBI database with accession number [GenBank:
HM237350]. CREx [42] was used to determine common
intervals and breakpoint distances in pair wise comparisons of gene orders. AT and GC skew were calculated
according to the following formula: AT skew = (A
%-T%)/(A%+T%); GC skew = ( G%-C%)/(G%+C%), as
described in [35].
Phylogenetic analysis

For the phylogenetic analyses we concatenated amino
acid alignments from 11 protein-coding genes. We
omitted alignments from atp8 and nad4l, as these are
the shortest and least conserved genes from the protein-coding set of animal mt genomes. A total of 60
species was chosen to build the alignments. A detailed
overview of the respective taxa and their accession
numbers is given in table 3. The alignment of proteincoding genes was done with MAFFT using the FFT-NSi option [61]. Gblocks ver. 0.91 [62] was used for
excluding ambiguously aligned proportions. We used
the following settings for the 50 species dataset: minimum number for a conserved position: 26; minimum
number for a flank position: 26; maximum number of
non-conserved positions: 8; minimum length of a block:
10; allowed gap positions: with half. The reduced alignment has a length of 2095 amino acids, which is 42% of
the original alignment (4959 amino acids). The alignment is available from the corresponding author’s website http://www.cgae.de. NH-PhyloBayes [63] was used
to conduct Bayesian inference with the site-heterogeneous CAT model and the BP option, allowing changes
of model settings at “breakpoints” along the tree
(empirical optimisation). Four independent MCMC

Page 12 of 14

chains were run for each specific alignment. Runs were
checked for convergence and stopped when all chains
converged to a similar topology. If not, runs were continued up to three weeks on a fast multicore processor
unit, allowing for about 10000 sample points per run.
Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) were calculated
from the trees sampled during stationary phase of the
different chains.
