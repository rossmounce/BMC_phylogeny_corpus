Abstract
Background: Major modifications to the pharyngeal jaw apparatus are widely regarded as a
recurring evolutionary key innovation that has enabled adaptive radiation in many species-rich
clades of percomorph fishes. However one of the central predictions of this hypothesis, that the
acquisition of a modified pharyngeal jaw apparatus will be positively correlated with explosive
lineage diversification, has never been tested. We applied comparative methods to a new timecalibrated phylogeny of labrid fishes to test whether diversification rates shifted at two scales where
major pharyngeal jaw innovations have evolved: across all of Labridae and within the subclade of
parrotfishes.
Results: Diversification patterns within early labrids did not reflect rapid initial radiation. Much of
modern labrid diversity stems from two recent rapid diversification events; one within julidine
fishes and the other with the origin of the most species-rich clade of reef-associated parrotfishes.
A secondary pharyngeal jaw innovation was correlated with rapid diversification within the
parrotfishes. However diversification rate shifts within parrotfishes are more strongly correlated
with the evolution of extreme dichromatism than with pharyngeal jaw modifications.
Conclusion: The temporal lag between pharyngeal jaw modifications and changes in diversification
rates casts doubt on the key innovation hypothesis as a simple explanation for much of the richness
seen in labrids and scarines. Although the possession of a secondarily modified PJA was correlated
with increased diversification rates, this pattern is better explained by the evolution of extreme
dichromatism (and other social and behavioral characters relating to sexual selection) within Scarus
and Chlorurus. The PJA-innovation hypothesis also fails to explain the most dominant aspect of
labrid lineage diversification, the radiation of the julidines. We suggest that pharyngeal jaws might
have played a more important role in enabling morphological evolution of the feeding apparatus in
labrids and scarines rather than in accelerating lineage diversification.

Background
Labrid fishes comprise roughly 600 species and inhabit
tropical and temperate marine habitats around the world.
They are an ecologically dominant component of major
reef systems [1] and display a staggering degree of trophic
and morphological diversity [2-5]. Members exploit
nearly all known feeding niches available to fishes including algae, fish, zooplankton, ectoparasites, crabs, polychaetes, mollusks, amphipods, and echinoderms [6], range in
size from a few grams to over 100 kg, and exhibit high
diversity in cranial and axial morphology [3,4,7,8].
Recently, the parrotfishes (subfamily Scarinae), which
constitute one of the major groups of reef herbivores and
bioeroders [9], have been recognized as a subclade of
labrids [5,10]. One classic explanation for both the species richness and the ecomorphological diversity of
labrids is that this clade has evolved a key innovation in
the form of modified pharyngeal jaws that has fueled their
subsequent radiation [11-14].
Percomorph fishes possess two sets of jaws: oral jaws
which function in prey capture and manipulation, and
pharyngeal jaws which usually aid in processing food and
moving it to the esophagus. Like cichlids, which are also
widely recognized for their exceptional functional diversity and species richness, labrids exhibit a highly modified
condition of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA) referred
to as pharyngognathy [12,14,15]. Pharyngognathy
involves united left and right lower jaw elements (fifth
ceratobranchials), a muscular sling connecting the neurocranium to the united fifth ceratobranchials, and a mobile
diarthrotic articulation of the upper pharyngeal jaws with
the neurocranium [12,14,15]. One of the most speciesrich groups of labrids, the parrotfishes, exhibit further
modifications of the PJA that are associated with forceful
grinding [13,16,17]. These include a laterally expanded
fourth epibranchial, laterally compressed upper pharyngeal jaws (pharyngobranchials), an anterior muscular
sling through novel attachments of the transversalis ventralis muscle (complementing the existing posterior muscle sling), a well developed sliding joints between the
pharyngobranchial, neurocranium and epibranchial that
permit extensive anterior-posterior motion of the upper
jaw, and a posterior to anterior progression of ordered
tooth tows on the lower pharyngeal jaws. These modifications are thought to enable trophic diversification by
allowing the pharyngeal jaws to take on enhanced functions in prey processing, freeing the oral jaws to become
specialized for prey capture [15].
The labroid pharyngeal jaw condition has been proposed
to be a key innovation [18] that underlies putative adaptive radiation in cichlids [15] and labrids [12-14]. Recent
studies have examined the role of the pharyngeal jaws in
shaping cichlid morphological diversification and clado-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/255

genesis [19-22]. However, the hypothesis that pharyngeal
jaws have influenced labrid diversity has never been
explicitly tested (though it recently received some support
from Mabuchi and colleagues [11] who demonstrated
that the PJA has evolved independently in labrids and a
clade which includes cichlids, pomacentrids, and embiotocids). Similarly, although structural and functional
innovations of the scarine pharyngeal jaw to allow the
processing of algae and coral skeletons are thought to
underlie the ecological radiation of this clade in reef and
seagrass habitats [17,23], the influence of this trait upon
parrotfish diversification patterns has never been studied.
In Schluter's framework of ecological adaptive radiation,
key innovations are one mechanism that provides ecological opportunity [24]. These traits are hypothesized to trigger adaptive radiations by enabling a lineage that evolves
the innovation to exploit a range of previously unavailable niches. The filling of niche space is expected to proceed rapidly. One of the central predictions of a key
innovation hypothesis in this framework then is concordance between the acquisition of the key innovation and a
shift in lineage diversification rate [25-27].
Here we evaluate this aspect of the key innovation
hypothesis by testing whether the evolution of modified
pharyngeal jaws has accelerated lineage diversification
within labrid fishes. The current lack of knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among major percomorph groups
prevents a sister group comparison between labrids and
their outgroup. However labrids remain an especially
good group to address this question because the nested
radiation of parrotfishes within them provides the opportunity to examine both ancient and recent signatures of
pharyngeal jaw innovation on patterns of diversification.
We assembled the largest time-calibrated phylogeny of
labrids to date and used comparative methods to assess
the impact of the pharyngeal jaw modifications on diversification rate. We asked three general questions:
1. Did pharyngeal jaw innovation trigger rapid lineage
diversification as part of an adaptive radiation?
If specialized pharyngeal jaws enabled labrids or parrotfishes to adaptively radiate along ecological axes, we
would expect to see a pattern where diversification after
the acquisition of the trait was rapid (as lineages exploited
newly available niches) and then slowed through time (as
this niche space became filled) [24,26,28]. We tested for
this pattern, which has recently been identified as one of
the ten key signatures of adaptive radiations [25], in two
ways: first using the MCCR test of Pybus and Harvey [29]
which tests for a slowing of diversification rates through
time and second, by directly comparing the fit of density
dependent models of cladogenesis to models where diversification is not a function of clade richness [28]. We

applied these methods to both the entire timetree to test
for this signature of adaptive radiation in the initial diversification of labrids, and within parrotfishes, to test for
adaptive radiation following the evolution of pharyngeal
jaws modified for grinding.
2. Are diversification rate shifts within labrids and scarids
temporally concordant with the pharyngeal jaw
innovations?
If PJA innovations have been primarily responsible for
diversification within labrids and parrotfishes, we can
make three further predictions. First, since key innovations are thought to trigger increased diversification, we
would expect the overall rate of labrid diversification to be
high compared to other percomorph fishes. Second, if the
PJA is the main cause of labrid species richness, any additional diversification rate increases should be restricted to
relatively small subclades. If a large fraction of labrid richness occurs in young, fast-evolving subclades temporally
removed from the labrid root, then the PJA is a weak
explanation for standing labrid diversity even if the PJA
played some role in initially establishing the clade in
diverse environments. Third, if the pharyngeal mill in parrotfishes were a key innovation that triggered a further
adaptive radiation, we would expect to see diversification
rates increase at or near the origin of this clade.
3. Does the character state of the pharyngeal jaws predict
diversification rate?
Key innovation hypotheses predict that lineages with the
innovation should diversify more quickly than lineages
that lack the trait [30]. We used BiSSE [31], a recently
developed comparative method, to test whether labrid
lineages with a modified pharyngeal mill (i.e. the parrotfishes) have diversified more quickly than those with the
labroid PJA. The sister group of labrids is currently not
known [5,11,32]. This lack of phylogenetic resolution
prevented us from testing whether the labroid PJA itself
was associated with faster rates of diversification than the
generalized percomorph condition.

Results
Divergence time analysis
Our BEAST analysis produced a well-resolved phylogeny
of 131 labrid species that was in good agreement with previous work (Fig. 1) [5,33]. A recent divergence time study
of labrids treated the crown age as fixed at 55 MY [33].
Our analysis recovered an almost identical crown age of
labrids even though we assigned far more liberal constraints to this node (50-120 MY) (Fig. 1; Table 1). Our
estimate of the split between scarines and cheilines +
labrines (46 MY, 95% HPD:36-58) is consistent with both
the CR (53 MY) and PL (36 MY) estimates of Smith et al
[33]. In contrast, our estimates for the age of crown
scarines (28 MY, 95% HPD:20-36) excludes both Streel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/255

man et al.'s [23] age of 42 MY and Smith et al.'s [33] estimate of 17 MY. The rest of our estimates within
parrotfishes including the age of the seagrass clade, reef
clade, Scarus + Chlorurus and crown ages of those genera
are slightly older than those Smith et al., [33] though in
almost all cases their mean is captured in our 95% credible interval.
Diversification analysis
A lineage through time plot revealed that the log number
of lineages appeared to accumulate at a roughly constant
rate in the early history of labrids. This pattern is expected
for lineages where diversification rate has been constant
[34], suggesting that diversification in early labrid history
was not initially fast (Fig. 2). This interpretation was supported by the MCCR test for labrids which failed to reject
the hypothesis of a constant diversification rate (Table 2).
Although the exponential density dependent model fit the
labrid data best, the 95% credible set of models based on
the calculation of Akaike weights [35] did not exclude the
pure-birth model. A lineage through time plot for scarines
revealed fewer lineages in their early history than expected
under a constant rates model. This result was reinforced
by a nonsignificant MCCR test (Table 2), suggesting that
explosive scarine diversification did not accompany the
evolution of modified pharyngeal jaws. An exponential
model of density-dependent diversification fit the scarines
best but the 95% credible interval did not exclude the
pure birth model (Table 3).

MEDUSA (Modeling Evolutionary Diversification Using
Stepwise AIC), a recently developed comparative method
that integrates taxonomic and phylogenetic information,
allows exceptionally radiating clades to be identified on
an incompletely sampled phylogeny [36,37]. MEDUSA
analysis revealed that the background rate of labrid diversification, (0.086 lineages/MY) is somewhat higher than
the average rate of diversification of percomorph (0.081
lineages/MY) and ostariophysan (0.067 lineages/MY)
fishes as well as most major tetrapod lineages [36,37]
(Table 4). We found evidence for two significant rate
shifts within labrids, though neither of these corresponded to the predictions generated by the PJA key-innovation hypothesis (above). The first corresponded to the
origin of a clade comprising Scarus and Chlorurus (S-C
clade hereafter). The net diversification rate of the stem SC lineage is only modestly higher than the background
rate of labrid diversification due to a long branch leading
from the split with Hipposcarus to the crown group (Table
4). However rates within the crown S-C clade (r = 0.23, Îµ
= 0.76) were approximately 2.5 times greater than the net
diversification rate of other labrids. The second rate shift
occurred on the branch leading to most of the julidine
diversity including the Indo-Pacific Halichoeres, the New
World Halichoeres, and the Labrichthyinae. The rate

Nodes in bold were fossil-calibrated (Table 7).

within this lineage was approximately twice that of labrids
diversifying at the background rate and roughly equal to
the rate of diversification within the crown S-C clade
(Table 4). We fit diversification models to both of the fastevolving clades identified by MEDUSA analysis to explore
whether their patterns were consistent with adaptive radiation. The scarines did not strongly favor a density
dependent model (Table 3), suggesting that their early
diversification was not explosive. This result was reinforced by a convex lineage through time plot, indicating
fewer than expected species in their early history. In contrast, the fast evolving julidines showed some evidence for
adaptive radiation both by model fitting which strongly
favored density dependent models (Table 3), and a concave lineage through time plot (Fig. 2) indicating more
species than expected in their early history.
We tested for a correlation between diversification rate
and the presence of a parrotfish pharyngeal mill using
BiSSE [31]. Our results found strong support in favor of a

model where pharyngeal mill-equipped lineages diversified ~4X faster than lineages with the typical labrid pharyngeal jaw apparatus (Table 5). However we were
concerned with the possibility of a trickle-down effect
from the S-C clade given that our MEDUSA analysis found
a rate increase for this group. To investigate this further,
we reran BiSSE with the S-C clade excluded and found no
support for a two-rate model (Table 5). Furthermore, the
speciation estimates in this unsupported two-rate model
were nearly identical (0.057 with pharyngeal mill vs.
0.053 without) suggesting that diversification rates in parrotfish genera besides Scarus and Chlorurus are similar to
rates in other labrids.
The S-C clade comprises the most sexually dichromatic,
haremic, and territorial of parrotfishes [23] and it has
been suggested that sexual selection has played a dominant role in their diversification [23,38]. To test whether
extreme sexual dichromatism was a better explanation of
diversification rates than a pharyngeal mill, we performed

A comparison of likelihood scores favored the extreme

Discussion
Did the evolution of the labrid pharyngeal jaw trigger rapid
lineage diversification?
A common element of many key innovation hypotheses is
that the trait is linked to rapid diversification [18] and
adaptive radiation [24]. Although we found the Labridae
as a whole to have diversified rapidly compared to other
percomorphs, we also found no evidence for a pulse of
cladogenesis coincident with the origin of the clade followed by declining rates as predicted by models of adaptive radiation [28,29]. Instead, we found that cladogenesis
in the early history of labrids proceeded in a fairly log-linear manner consistent with a model where net diversificaTable 2: MCCR results for tests of labrid subclades.

tion rates were constant. Thus, we find no direct support
for the hypothesis that the PJA triggered rapid lineage
diversification as part of an adaptive radiation (sensu
Schluter [24]). High rates of extinction have been shown
to erase the signature of adaptive radiation [26,28,39] and
so one possibility is that background extinction within
labrids has masked PJA-facilitated diversification. However other marine fish clades of roughly similar ages with
less trophic diversity and species richness do retain the signature of exceptionally rapid initial diversification [40].
Thus we are skeptical that exceptionally high extinction
rates have masked the signal of explosive lineage diversification in labrids. Further evaluation of extinction rates
across labrid history is hampered by their poor fossil
record. In any case, our analyses cast doubt on the PJA-key
innovation as a strong general explanation of labrid species richness because over 40% of non-scarine labrid
diversity can be attributed to the julidine rate shift, an
event which occurred ~30 MY after the origin of the labrid
PJA.
Our findings are similar to those from recent studies of
cichlid diversity. Although the pharyngeal jaw has been
suggested to underpin species richness in this family as
well [15], recent phylogenetic analyses have found that

the major diversification rate shift which lead to the origin
of most of the diversity of East African haplochromines
(~1800 species) occurred within the last 2.4 MY, well after
the evolution of the PJA [20-22]. Instead, diversification
patterns appear to be strongly correlated with the evolution of specific behavioral and sexual characters [38] such
as mouth brooding and egg spots on the anal fins [20].

labrid diversification rate. We suggest that the most likely
cause of diversification in the S-C clade is the evolution of
extreme male breeding coloration and reproductive
behaviors through sexual selection [23]. Other contributing biogeographic factors are considered in Smith et al.,
[33] and include Pliocene/Pleistocene fluctuations in sea
level and the closing of the Isthmus of Panama.

Is the parrotfish pharyngeal mill a key innovation that
explains scarine biodiversity?
We similarly found weak evidence in favor of the pharyngeal mill key innovation hypothesis. The MCCR test did
not support the hypothesis that early parrotfish diversification had slowed through time and fitting of diversification models did not favor density dependent models
(Tables 2, 3). Once again it is possible that high extinction
rates have masked this signature although we regard this
as less likely since scarines are considerably younger than
crown labrids. Although we did find a significant increase
in the rate of scarine diversification relative to other
labrids, this rate increase was restricted to a clade comprising two very young genera of parrotfishes rather than at or
near the root of the entire clade. The strongest evidence
supporting the idea that a pharyngeal mill has contributed
to scarine biodiversity comes from our BiSSE analysis
which found a high correlation between the possession of
a pharyngeal mill and the diversification rate. However we
suggest that this result is driven by trickledown effects of
the rate increase on Scarus + Chlorurus. This was supported
by our BiSSE reanalysis which showed that the diversification rate in other scarines was very similar to the average

What explains the rate shifts in julidines?
The julidines have been recognized as one of the largest of
all coral reef fish radiations [5]. For the first time we show
that this radiation was exceptionally fast, with a net diversification rate of 0.19 species/MY. Recently Alfaro et al.
[41] found evidence of rapid diversification of reef-associated tetraodontiform families during the late Oligocene
and early Miocene. The mean age estimate of the julidine
rate increase (~24 MY) falls at the end of the Oligocene,
suggesting that similar factors may underlie the diversification of julidines and possibly other major reef-associated fish clades. These include the closing of the Tethys
and the collision of the Australia New Guinea plate with
SE Eurasia [41-44].
Do trophic key innovations drive species diversification?
The key innovation hypothesis has been invoked to
explain both the species richness and phenotypic diversity
of labrids [11,15,18,24,45]. Although these two aspects of
a radiating clade are often conflated, it is important to
point out that diversification and phenotypic evolution
need not be strongly linked [46,47]. Our results show that
pharyngeal jaw innovations provide weak explanations

for the major patterns of species richness observed at relevant levels of labrid and scarine phylogeny. However it is
currently not known if the labrid PJA or the pharyngeal
mill of parrotfishes could have acted as a key innovation
to spur rates of functional evolution as it has in cichlids
[19]. The wealth of studies on labrid functional evolution
suggests that this might be true. Multiple studies have
established that labrids are functionally [3,48] and trophically diverse [5,49,50], that their functional diversity is
partitioned unevenly across extant clades [3], and that
they display complex patterns of functional evolution
over their history [5]. Similarly, it is possible that the parrotfish pharyngeal mill is associated with a greater than
expected amount of functional and morphological diversity observed in scarines relative to other labrid clades [3].
Increasingly sophisticated methods exist for answering
questions about patterns and rates of morphological evolution [51-53] but have yet to be applied to test key innovation hypotheses.
Our results add to a growing body of work on diversification patterns in fish clades with modified pharyngeal jaws
[20-22]. Together these studies cast doubt on the hypothesis that the pharyngeal jaw innovation itself is directly
responsible for observed patterns of species richness in
fishes. It is possible that pharyngeal jaw innovations influence diversification rates by allowing clades to establish
ecological 'footholds' in novel environments [18] or in
ways that are context-dependent [54]. However, these formulations of key innovation hypotheses are difficult to
test with the suite of comparative methods currently available to evolutionary biologists [55]. In contrast, predictions about the influence of pharyngeal jaw modifications
on evolution of other trophic characters are more direct
and lend themselves to hypothesis testing [19]. We suggest that pharyngeal jaw innovations do not constitute a
general explanation for patterns of labrid or scarine diversity but that the hypothesis that this trait represents a key
innovation might still be useful in explaining patterns of
morphological and functional evolution within these
clades.

Conclusion
Labrids diversified rapidly relative to other percomorphs.
However there is no evidence that pharyngeal jaw innovations triggered explosive lineage diversification within
either labrids or scarines. Even if pharyngeal jaw evolution
triggered adaptive radiation with accelerated cladogenesis,
over half of labrid richness can be attributed to two more
recent diversification events where key innovations are
not suspected as causes: one within the julidines and one
within the most dichromatic of parrotfishes, Scarus and
Chlorurus. The similarity of these results to similar studies
of diversification patterns in cichlids suggests that the
pharyngeal jaws-as-key-innovations hypothesis should
not be invoked as a general explanation for the species
diversity in either family though it may have utility in
explaining patterns of ecomorphological diversity.

Methods
Divergence time estimation
We downloaded GenBank sequence data for 131 labrid
species and 17 outgroups from three previously published
studies: Westneat and Alfaro [5], Clements et al. [10], and
Smith et al. [33] for two mitochondrial (12S, 16S) and
two nuclear (tmo4c4, RAG2) genes. Genbank accession
numbers are given in Additional FIle 1.

We aligned the mitochondrial gene sequences to previously published models of secondary structure in a text
editor and used the Clustal [56] module of Geneious [57]
to align the protein coding nuclear genes and concatenate
the matrix. We compared three possible partitioning
schemes of the concatenated data using Bayes factors
based on the marginal likelihood: all genes together (one
partition), separate partition for each gene (four partitions), and separate partitions for 12S and 16S plus codon
positions within genes (eight partitions). We assigned
each partition a GTR + I + G model. In addition, we examined an eight partition scheme with an HKY + G model to
assess whether a more simple substitution model better fit
the data. After comparing Bayes factors in Tracer [58]
(Table 6) we used the best of the four partitioning
schemes (the eight parameter GTR + I + G model) to estimate divergence times using BEAST 1.4 [59]. However, we

found that all four models produced nearly identical
results where the ages of focal nodes differed by less than
+/- 1 MY. We constrained four clades in the analysis on the
basis of the labrid fossil record (Table 7). In each case the
age of the fossil served as a hard bound on the minimum
age of the constrained clade. To mitigate against the effects
of truncated prior distribution [60,61] we assigned exponential priors to the constrained nodes where the 95%
upper limit on the prior reflected our best guess for the
maximum age of the clade based on the fossil record.

Crown seagrass parrotfishes
(Fig. 1, node 27): A fossil parrotfish, Calotomus preisli [65]
is known from the Middle Miocene (14 MY). Recent
molecular studies place Calotomus within the 'seagrass'
[23] clade of parrotfishes though there is some ambiguity
about the exact position of the lineage within this clade
[23,33]. We calibrated the minimum age of the 'seagrass'
parrotfishes using this fossil and assigned a maximum age
of 50 MY to reflect our belief that this split is younger than
the age of the oldest known fossil labrids (above).

Crown Labridae
(Fig. 1, node 1): The fossil Phyllopharyngodon longipinnis
from the Middle Eocene of the Monte Bolca (50 MY) [62]
is the earliest known labrid and is considered to be a stem
hypsigenyine, providing a minimum estimate for the age
of crown labrids. We placed an upper bound for the age of
the crown labrids at 120 MY to reflect our belief that it is
unlikely that labrids are much older than the oldest
known acanthomorph fossils, dated 90-110 MY [63,64].

Split Bolbometopon vs. Cetoscarus
(Fig. 1 node 29) Fossil elements belonging to the genus
Bolbometopon are known from the late Miocene (5.3 MY)
[17,65] and we used this as a minimum age of the split
between Bolbometopon and Cetoscarus. We assigned a maximum age of 50 MY to this split to reflect our prior belief
that Bolbometopon and Cetoscarus diverged before the age
of the earliest known labrids (above).

Crown hypsigenyines (except Lachnolaimus)
Trigonodon (Fig. 1, node 3): The fossil Trigonodon jugleri
[17,65], known from the Early Miocene (20 MY), is a stem
chiseltooth wrasse (genus Pseudodax). In a recent molecular phylogeny of labrids, Westneat and Alfaro [5] recover
the clade Pseudodax + Achoerodus as the sister to all other
hysigenyines except for Lachnolaimus. On the basis of this
placement, we constrained the crown age of hypsigenyines (excluding Lachnolaimus) to be 20 MY. We
assigned an upper limit of 50 MY to reflect our belief that
this split is likely to be younger than the first appearance
of stem hypsigenyines (above).

We ran the BEAST MCMC sampler for 50 million generations sampling every 1000 generations. We assessed convergence visually using Tracer [58] to plot of likelihood
versus generation and estimate the effective sample size
(ESS) of all parameters. As an additional check that the
sampler converged on the target distribution, we repeated
the analysis with separate starting trees five times.
Diversification Analysis
We used the LASER package [66] in R to generate lineage
through time plots for labrids, scarines and the two fastevolving subclades identified by MEDUSA (Fig. 3). We
tested whether rapid lineage diversification characterized
the origin of labrids, and parrotfishes using the MCCR test

Species richness from Fishbase [70].

(Pybus and Harvey, 2001) which compares the distribution of branching events on the observed tree to that
expected under a pattern of constant diversification. To
account for incomplete taxon sampling we constructed a
null distribution of the test statistic (gamma) with 1000
replicates that reflected the subsampling of the clade in
question [29]. For example, we simulated the evolution of
1000 573-taxon trees (to reflect current estimates of labrid
diversity) and pruned them to 131 tips (to reflect our sampling) using the mccrTest in the Laser package for R. Total
and sampled richness for each of these groups is reported
in Table 8.
We restricted our lineage through time plots and fitting of
diversification models to the early history of focal clades
for two reasons. First, our questions about the relationship between the acquisition of pharyngeal jaw characters
and lineage diversification predict that adaptive radiation
would leave a signature on the early evolutionary history
of labrid groups. Second, the previous phylogenetic studies which provide the sequence data for our analyses were
designed to capture the splitting events among major lineages but not to resolve species-level relationships within
diverse genera [4,23,33]. Thus we expect our phylogeny to
capture early splitting events among tribes and genera and
to undersample more tipward splits. Incomplete sampling of more recent splits may cause an apparent decline
in net diversification towards the present, creating the
potential for artifactual rejection of a constant-rates
model. To avoid this problem, we followed the approach

of Nee et al. [67] and fit diversification models (and
restricted lineage through time plots) to the first 70% of
the timetree (from the root) of labrids, fast-evolving julidines, and Scarus + Chlorurus. We included the first 85% of
the scarine timetree because the taxonomy and phylogeny
of this clade has been long studied [17,23,33,68] and we
are confident that the only unsampled splitting events in
our tree are within the young clades Scarus, Chlorurus, and
Sparisoma. Four models of diversification were fit to the
labrid and scarine timetrees and the two fast-evolving
clades identified by MEDUSA using maximum likelihood:
a constant-rates pure birth; logistic and exponential density-dependent; and linear decline in which net diversification decreased through time at a rate that is
independent of clade size [27]. We modified R code
kindly provided by Dan Rabosky to fit these four models
of diversification to the time-truncated phylogeny. For
each model, the difference between its AIC score (AIC)
and that of the best-fitting model was calculated as well as
the Akaike weight. All model-fitting analyses were done in
R [69].
To identify periods of exceptional diversification in the
history of labrids we used MEDUSA (Modeling Evolutionary Diversification Using Stepwise AIC) a recently developed comparative method that combines phylogenetic
and taxonomic information to estimate rate shifts on a
phylogeny [36]. We first compiled taxonomic species richness data from FishBase [70] for the major clades of the
timetree. Then we pruned the tree down so that each of

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:255

these clades was represented by a single tip species. In
pruning the tree we strived to preserve the maximum
amount of phylogenetic resolution possible that would
still allow the entirety of labrid species richness to be distributed among the tips. Thus we retained a single representative of the genus Scarus in the pruned tree and
assigned it the richness of the genus (52 species) because
we could not confidently divide the richness further
among the tips we sampled. Assignment of unsampled
species richness was based upon the membership and
placement of labrid tribes and subclades from Fig. 1 and
previous
taxonomic
and
phylogenetic
studies
[5,10,17,23,43,71,72].
MEDUSA involves the stepwise addition of rate shifts on
the pruned topology. In the first iteration, the AIC score of
a birth-death model across the diversity tree was compared to a model where both rates were allowed to shift
on the optimal branch (in this case, the branch leading to
Scarus + Chlorurus). If the rate shift substantially improved
the AIC score, we retained the shift and repeated the procedure, comparing the two rate tree to a tree where the rate
was allowed to optimally shift on a third branch. We
repeated this procedure until the addition of parameters
resulted in AIC improvements of less than 4 units (indicating moderate support of the data for the model in an
AIC framework [35]). Code to perform MEDUSA analysis
is distributed in the Geiger package [73] for R [69].

We used BiSSE [31], implemented in Mesquite [74] to test
key innovation hypotheses to explain patterns of diversification in labrid fishes. BiSSE [31] provides a likelihoodbased test of whether a discrete character (in this case the
presence or absence of a modified pharyngeal mill) influences the rate of lineage diversification. First we tested
whether the evolution of modified grinding pharyngeal
jaws facilitated rapid diversification in parrotfishes relative to other labrids by coding the tips in Fig. 1 for presence/absence of a pharyngeal mill. Second, we repeated
the first analysis excluding the extremely dichromatic genera Scarus and Chlorurus to test whether rapid diversification within this clade was driving significance across all
scarines. Finally we tested whether the evolution of
extreme dichromatic coloration in Scarus and Chlorurus
was a better explanation of diversification rate than the
acquisition of a pharyngeal mill. In all cases, BiSSE was
used to compute likelihoods of our empirical data (timetree and character states at the tips) under two models, a
constrained and unconstrained model. The unconstrained model had all parameters (i.e. Î», Î¼, q) free to vary
while the constrained model forced the speciation rates
for both character states to be equal (Î»0 = Î»1). Two times
the difference in log-likelihoods was computed and a Ï2distribution with a single degree-of-freedom was used to
test for significance.
