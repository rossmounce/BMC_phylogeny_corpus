Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short (~22 nt) non-coding RNAs that play
important regulatory roles. MiRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are characterized by their hairpin
structures. However, a large amount of similar hairpins can be folded in many genomes. Almost all
current methods for computational prediction of miRNAs use comparative genomic approaches
to identify putative pre-miRNAs from candidate hairpins. Ab initio method for distinguishing premiRNAs from sequence segments with pre-miRNA-like hairpin structures is lacking. Being able to
classify real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs is important both for understanding of the nature of miRNAs
and for developing ab initio prediction methods that can discovery new miRNAs without known
homology.
Results: A set of novel features of local contiguous structure-sequence information is proposed
for distinguishing the hairpins of real pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre-miRNAs. Support vector
machine (SVM) is applied on these features to classify real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs, achieving about
90% accuracy on human data. Remarkably, the SVM classifier built on human data can correctly
identify up to 90% of the pre-miRNAs from other species, including plants and virus, without
utilizing any comparative genomics information.
Conclusion: The local structure-sequence features reflect discriminative and conserved
characteristics of miRNAs, and the successful ab initio classification of real and pseudo pre-miRNAs
opens a new approach for discovering new miRNAs.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNAs about 21–26
nucleotide (nt) in length that can play important roles in
gene regulation by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression [1,2]. According to the current understanding, miRNA is transcribed as long primary miRNA,

which is processed into 60~70 nt miRNA precursor (premiRNA) by nuclear RNase III Drosha [3,4]. The premiRNA is transported from nuclear to cytoplasm by
Exportin-5 [5,6] and then cleaved into ~22 nt duplexes
[2]. Almost all pre-miRNAs have the characteristic of
stem-loop hairpin structures. During the biogenesis proPage 1 of 7

cedure of a mature miRNA, the hairpin structure of premiRNA acts as not only the structure motif for Exportin-5
in nuclear-cytoplasm transportation, but also a substrate
for Dicer enzyme [5-7]. This indicates the importance of
the secondary structures in the miRNA biogenesis procedure.
Due to the difficulty of systematically detecting miRNAs
from a genome by existing experiment techniques, computational methods play important roles in the identification of new miRNAs. As a characteristic secondary
structure, the hairpin of pre-miRNA is an important feature used in the computational identification of miRNAs.
For examples, MiRscan relies on the observation that the
known miRNAs are derived from phylogenetically conserved stem-loop precursor RNAs with characteristic features [8,9]. It successfully predicted hundreds of miRNAs
in nematodes and human with a sensitivity of 0.74. The
miRseeker [10] was developed for predicting miRNA
genes in insects, whereas MIRcheck [11] and MIRFINDER
[12] were applied in plants. Recently, the miRAlign [13]
aligns the secondary structure of pre-miRNAs to detect
miRNAs. However, there can be many sequence segments
in a genome that may fold into the similar stem-loop hairpin structures, e.g., about ~11 million hairpins can be
folded in the human genome [14], and some 44,000 hairpin candidates can be obtained in C. elegans, corresponding to ~4% of the worm genome [15]. Therefore, all those
existing methods utilize comparative genomics information besides structure features to predict new miRNAs. A
typical idea is to use comparative genomics to filter most
of hairpins that are not conserved in related species. Such
filtering steps make the methods unable to identify new
miRNAs for which there are no known close homologies
either due to the limitation of current data or due to the
possibly rapid evolution of miRNAs. A latest report shows
that the number of non-conserved miRNAs which are
missed by the comparative genomics strategy is still large
[14]. Furthermore, for a species that does not have a
closely related species sequenced, its miRNAs cannot be
studied with comparative genomics approaches either.
In this study, we focus on the ab initio classification of real
pre-miRNA from other hairpin sequences with similar
stem-loop features (we call them as pseudo pre-miRNAs).
A set of novel features that combines the local continuous
structure and sequence information of the stem-loops are
proposed. The machine learning method SVM or support
vector machine is used to classify two classes based on the
features. SVM has been widely applied to the prediction
and classification of important biology signals such as
promoters [16], translation initiation sites [17], splicing
sites [18] and proteins [19]. Recently, SVM was successfully applied to predict new virus miRNAs [20] and functional siRNAs [21]. With the local structure-sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/310

features we extracted, SVM achieves the accuracy about
90% for distinguishing real vs. pseudo human pre-miRNAs. Interestingly, the SVM classifier trained on human
miRNA data can also identify miRNAs of other species
across animals, plants and virus with high accuracy, which
indicates that the features may reflect a characteristic that
is consistent across all species. The classifier is also validated on the latest human miRNA data which were
missed by all existing prediction methods [14] and a high
accuracy (92.3%) is achieved.

Results and Discussion
Human miRNA precursor and pseudo miRNA datasets
Sets of human pre-miRNAs and pseudo-miRNA hairpins
are collected to train SVMs and to evaluate the classification performance.
Human miRNA precursors
The sequences of human pre-miRNAs are downloaded
from the miRNA registry database [22-24] in Sept., 2004
(release 5.0), which contains 207 reported pre-miRNA
entries from Homo sapiens. Only the pre-miRNAs whose
secondary structures do not contain multiple loops are
considered, which gives us 193 pre-miRNAs, covering
more than 93% of all the reported human pre-miRNAs.
Pseudo and candidate miRNA hairpins
Two datasets of pre-miRNA-like hairpins are built. They
are sequence segments that have similar stem-loop structures as genuine pre-miRNAs but have not been reported
as pre-miRNAs. For the convenience of discussion, we call
them as the "CODING" and the "CONSERVED-HAIRPIN" datasets according to the ways we collect them.

The CODING dataset is collected from the protein coding
regions. The protein coding sequences (CDSs) of human
RefSeq genes with no known alternative splice events are
collected. The CDS sequences are extracted according to
the UCSC refGene annotation tables [25,26]. We join the
CDS sequences together and extract non-overlapping segments from it, keeping the length distribution of the
extracted segments identical with that of human pre-miRNAs. The secondary structures of the extracted segments
are predicted using RNAfold [27]. The criteria for selecting
the pseudo-miRNAs from the segments are: minimum of
18 base pairings on the stem of the hairpin structure
(included the GU wobble pairs), maximum of -15 kcal/
mol free energy of the secondary structure, and no multiple loops. These criteria ensure that the extracted pseudo
pre-miRNAs are similar to real pre-miRNAs according to
the widely accepted characteristics. (The thresholds 18
and -15 are the lowest number of base pairings and the
highest free energy among all the genuine human premiRNAs, respectively.) As all reported miRNAs are located
in the un-translated regions or intergenic regions, we take

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:310

the hairpins collected from CDS as examples of pseudo
pre-miRNAs. Totally, 8,494 pre-miRNA-like hairpins are
collected in this dataset.
The CONSERVED-HAIRPIN dataset is extracted from the
genome region of position 56,000,001 to 57,000,000 on
human chromosome 19. The data are obtained from the
UCSC database (hg17, May 2004) [25]. The 659
sequences conserved between human and mouse in this
region are collected, which contain 313,212 nucleotides.
We use a window of width 100 nt to scan the region with
step length 10 nt to produce sequence segments, the secondary structures of which are then predicted by RNAfold
[27]. This results in 2,444 hairpins to compose the CONSERVED-HAIRPIN dataset according to the same criteria
used for the CODING dataset. It should be noted that,
unlike the CODING set, there might be a few true miRNAs
among these segments. But since miRNAs only takes a
very small proportion in the genome, most of the hairpins
in this dataset are more likely pseudo-miRNAs. In fact,
there are 3 known miRNAs (hsa-mir-99b, hsa-let-7e and
hsa-mir-125a) in this dataset.
The CODING dataset is used as negative samples in the
training and validation of the SVM classifier, and the
CONSERVED-HAIRPIN dataset is used as a candidate
dataset to evaluate how the classifier works on the
genome.
Training and test sets for classification experiments
For the classification experiments, one training set and
two test sets are built using the datasets described above.
The training set TR-C includes 163 human pre-miRNAs
(positive samples) and 168 pseudo pre-miRNAs (negative
samples) randomly selected from the 193 human premiRNAs and the CODING dataset, respectively. The test
set TE-C comprises of the remaining 30 human pre-miRNAs not used in TR-C and 1000 pseudo pre-miRNAs randomly picked up from the CODING dataset (examples
already selected in the training sets are avoided). The
CONSERVED-HAIRPIN dataset is the second test set.
CROSS-SPECIES test set
After experimenting on the human data, we apply the
SVM classifier trained with human data to other species to
see if the features are conserved during evolution. The
release 5.0 of the miRNA registry [22,23] contains 1138
pre-miRNAs entries from 11 species besides human:
Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, Drosophila
melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Dnio rerio, Gallus
gallus, Mus musculusi, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Epstein Barr Virus. Only the pre-miRNAs with no multiple loops are used, which cover more
than 90% of all the reported pre-miRNAs of the 11 species. The pre-miRNAs that share high sequence similarities

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/310

with the human pre-miRNAs are excluded to avoid biased
evaluation of the SVM trained on human data. The similarity is calculated using BLASTCLUST [28] with S = 80, L
= 0.5, W = 16. With these processing, 581 pre-miRNAs
from the 11 species remained for the test experiment. We
refer this set of pre-miRNAs as the CROSS-SPECIES test
set.
Latest human miRNA updated set
At the time this paper was being written, a batch of new
human miRNAs are reported, most of which are not conserved beyond primates [14]. We took these latest data as
an independent test set and applied our SVM classifier on
it. From the 89 pre-miRNAs reported in [14], we extract
the 88 that have no multiple loops. The sequence similarities between the 88 pre-miRNAs are calculated using
BLASTCLUST with S = 80, L = 0.5, W = 16. Only one premiRNA is then chosen for each cluster to eliminate closely
related sequences, which gives us 40 non-redundant premiRNAs. We also check the sequence similarity of these
40 pre-miRNAs with the 163 human pre-miRNAs in the
training dataset and eliminate one more miRNA that has
high similarity with entries in the training data. Finally,
the remaining 39 pre-miRNAs are used as the UPDATED
test set.
The local contiguous structure-sequence features
Recent reports have shown that local sequence features are
important in pre-miRNAs [29]. Our investigations show
that the distributions of local contiguous sub-structures
(continuously paired or unpaired structures) of pre-miRNAs are significantly distinct with that of pseudo pre-miRNAs. Based on these observations, we propose a set of
features that combines the local contiguous structures
with sequence information to characterize the hairpin
structure of real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs. The features
focus on the information of every 3 adjacent nucleotides,
and we name them as triplet structure-sequence elements
or triplet elements for the convenience of discussion.

The RNA secondary structures are predicted using RNAfold [27]. In the predicted secondary structure, there are
only two statuses for each nucleotide, paired or unpaired,
indicated by brackets ("("or")") and dots ("."), respectively. The left bracket "(" means that the paired nucleotide is located near the 5'-end and can be paired with
another nucleotide at the 3'-end, which is indicated by a
right bracket")". We don't distinguish these two situations
in this work and use "(" for both situations. For any 3
adjacent nucleotides, there are 8 (23) possible structure
compositions: "(((", "((.", "(..", "(.(", ".((", ".(.", "..(" and
"...". Considering the middle nucleotide among the 3,
there are 32 (4 × 8) possible structure-sequence combinations, which we denote as "U(((", "A((.", etc. This defines
our triplet structure-sequence elements. As an example,

Figure 1
sequence triplet elements to represent the local structureUsing the features of the hairpin
Using the triplet elements to represent the local structuresequence features of the hairpin. The triplet element is composed of the 3 continuous sub-structures and the nucleotide
type at the middle. The appearances of all 32 possible triplet
elements are counted along a hairpin segment, forming a 32dimensional vector, which is then normalized to be the input
vector for SVM.

Figure 1 illustrates how a hairpin is represented using triplet elements. We exclude the terminal loop and external
single-stranded regions of the hairpin and only consider
the stem portions. The number of appearance of each triplet element is counted for each hairpin (pre-miRNA or
pseudo pre-miRNA) to produce the 32-dimensional feature vector. It is normalized before being used as input
features for SVM.
SVM classification
Support vector machine or SVM is used to classify real vs.
pseudo pre-miRNAs with the 32-dimentional feature vectors. SVM is adopted due to its reported good generalization ability [30,31]. The SVM classifier is trained with the
set TR-C and then applied on all the test sets. We call the
whole strategy of using SVM with the triplet element features to recognize pre-miRNAs as the triplet-SVM method.
Classification of human real vs. pseudo miRNA precursors
When applying SVM classifier on the set TE-C, 28 out of
the 30 human pre-miRNAs are correctly recognized (the

missed ones are "hsa-mir-147" and " hsa-mir-187") and
881 out of the 1000 pseudo-miRNAs are detected as negative, which gives a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of
88.1% (Table 1).
On the set CONSERVED-HAIRPIN, the SVM classifier
identifies 2,174 out of the 2,444 potential hairpin structures as false miRNAs, which give a specificity of or greater
than 89.0% if we assume all the hairpins in this dataset are
not true pre-miRNAs (but in fact there are at least 3 true
pre-miRNAs and they are all correctly detected).
The high classification accuracies illustrate that the real
and pseudo pre-miRNAs are quite distinct with regard to
the triplet element features, though they share similar
hairpin structure. The triplet elements reflect information
of the local contiguous fine-structures and the sequence
composition. For example, the triplet unit "(((" represents
the stacking of paired bases and the unit "..." represents
the interior or bugle loops, etc. The success of using these
features to recognize real pre-miRNAs from other hairpins
shows that these features might reflect some intrinsic
characteristic of pre-miRNAs. We calculate the average
occurring frequencies of the 32 triplet elements in the 163
pre-miRNAs and the 168 pseudo-miRNA hairpins in
training dataset. Figure 2 displays the distribution of the
average frequencies of triplet elements in the two classes.
Comparing each of the basic structure units in the triplet
elements between the real and pseudo pre-miRNAs, we
can find that continuously paired nucleotides like "((("
appear at higher frequencies in pre-miRNAs than in
pseudo-miRNAs, and continuously unpaired structures
like "..." or "..(" tend to appear more often in pseudo-miRNAs.

A feature selection criterion reported in Dror et al [32] is
adopted to analyze the discriminative powers of the different triplet elements. Denote xi, i = 1 ...32 as the 32 triplet element features. The means µi+ , µi− and standard
deviations σ i+ , σ i− of xi in the two classes are calculated.
The discriminatory power of each triplet element− is
µ + − µi
assessed by an F value defined as F( xi ) = i
.
σ i+ + σ i−
Table 2 lists the 15 most discriminative triplet elements. It
can be seen that the most informative triplet elements are
the continuously paired or unpaired structures. It should
be emphasized that the pseudo-miRNAs collected in this
study are also "good" hairpins selected with a series of
strict criteria according to the existing understanding of
pre-miRNA hairpins. Our observations show that the
major differences between pre-miRNAs and other similar
hairpins are in these kinds of fine structure features. This
can be related with the stability of the secondary structure
of the pre-miRNAs. Essentially, the stacking of more continuously paired nucleotides can decrease the free energy
of the folded structure and stabilize of the secondary structure, whereas the occurring of interior loops and bugle
loops (like the "..." and "..(" in the triplet elements) can
destabilize the RNA structures by increasing the free
energy [33]. So, these results manifest that pre-miRNAs
are more stable than other hairpins with similar stemloop structures in the genome. It has been suggested that
the stability of pre-miRNA might be associated with the
biogenesis and processing procedure of mature miRNAs
[28].
Sequence information is also included in the triplet elements. Previous studies of pre-miRNAs have carefully
considered the effect of primary sequence orders. Distri-

butions of mono-nucleotides and di-nucleotides are often
preserved when producing comparable sequences [29].
Our experiments show that the appearance frequencies of
the same triplet structure units with different middle
nucleotides in real pre-miRNAs are not identical, and their
appearance frequencies between real and pseudo miRNAs
are significantly distinct (see Figure 2). Experiments also
show that SVM performs better when taking the sequence
information into the triplet elements, than using just the
8 triplet structure features without the nucleotide information. For example, we trained another SVM classifier
with same training dataset using only the 8 triplet structure features. When being applied to the set TE-C, the SVM
classifier correctly recognized 29 out of 30 human premiRNAs (sensitivity 96.7%), but it only detected 636
pseudo-miRNAs as negative (specificity 63.6%). On the
CONSERVED-HAIRPIN set, that SVM classifier identified
1702 out of the 2444 potential hairpin structures as false
pre-miRNAs, which gave specificity of or above 69.6%.
We can see that the specificity can be greatly improved
when using both structure and sequence information.
Applying to all other species
Most, if not all, existing miRNA prediction methods work
on animals and plants separately, since plant miRNAs are
known to have more heterogeneous hairpin structures
than animal miRNAs [2,34]. Interestingly, when we apply
the SVM classifier trained with only human data to all
other species (ranging from animals, plants and virus)
where miRNAs have been reported, it can correctly identify most of the true pre-miRNAs. Table 3 shows the SVM
prediction on the CROSS-SPECIES set, which contains
581 known pre-miRNAs of 11 species. Any pre-miRNAs

that are homologous to the human miRNAs have been
excluded from the set. The SVM classifier achieves an overall accuracy of 90.9% on the CROSS-SPECIES set. Especially, it is noticeable that the classifier correctly identifies
most the plant and viral pre-miRNAs. It is known that
plant miRNAs usually have longer precursor sequences
[29]. The success of the triplet-SVM classifier across the
wide range of different species indicates that there may be
local contiguous structure-sequence characteristics that
are conserved in pre-miRNAs of all species. Similarly,
when comparing the appearance frequencies of each triplet elements in real pre-miRNAs within all the species vs.
the pseudo pre-miRNAs, their differences are well conserved.

achieving about 90% accuracy on human test data.
Remarkably, the triplet-SVM classifier built on human
data can correctly classify up to 90% of the pre-miRNAs
from the other 11 species including plants and virus without utilizing any comparative genomics information and
an accuracy of 92.3% is achieved on the newly reported
novel human miRNAs. The local structure-sequence features may contain distinctive and conserved characteristics of miRNAs, and the successful ab initio classification of
real and pseudo pre-miRNAs opens a new approach for
discovering new miRNAs.
Scanning the genome, there could be numerous amounts
of sequence segments that can be folded into pre-miRNAlike hairpins. The ability to distinguish pseudo vs. real premiRNAs is essential in the computational identification of
novel and species-specific miRNAs. Since the number of
possible candidate hairpins is very large, the current specificity around 89% is still not satisfactory for genomewide applications and a lot of false positive predictions
can be produced. How to find more information to further reduce the false positive rate is what should be sought
next. However, latest reports suggested that there may be
much more miRNAs than the number currently known
[35]. It might be necessary to reconsider what we previously regard as false-positive predictions. The successful
application of the human-based classifier on all other species implies that the biogenesis and processing mechanism of miRNAs might be conserved between animals,
plants and viruses.

Methods
Testing on the latest human-specific miRNAs
The 39 human pre-miRNAs from in the UPDATED set
were newly reported when this work was almost completed. They are not conserved in closely related species,
and therefore existing homology-based methods all fail to
identify them [14,35]. With our triplet-SVM classifier, 36
of the 39 new pre-miRNAs are correctly recognized, giving
an accuracy of 92.3% (Table 1). This shows that ab initio
miRNA predictors like the proposed triplet-SVM method
can be more powerful in discovering novel or species-specific pre-miRNAs.

Conclusion
A major characteristic that defines miRNA precursors is
the hairpin structures, but large amounts of similar hairpins can be formed from sequence segments in genomes.
Ab initio method for distinguishing true pre-miRNAs from
other pre-miRNA-like hairpin structures is important for
discovering new and species-specific miRNAs. For this
purpose, a set of novel features (the triplet elements) to
describe local contiguous structure-sequence characteristics are extracted, and support vector machine is applied
with these features to classify real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs,
