Comparative analyses of vertebrate posterior
HoxD clusters reveal atypical cluster architecture
in the caecilian Typhlonectes natans
An Mannaert1, Chris T Amemiya2, Franky Bossuyt1*

Abstract
Background: The posterior genes of the HoxD cluster play a crucial role in the patterning of the tetrapod limb.
This region is under the control of a global, long-range enhancer that is present in all vertebrates. Variation in limb
types, as is the case in amphibians, can probably not only be attributed to variation in Hox genes, but is likely to
be the product of differences in gene regulation. With a collection of vertebrate genome sequences available
today, we used a comparative genomics approach to study the posterior HoxD cluster of amphibians. A frog and a
caecilian were included in the study to compare coding sequences as well as to determine the gain and loss of
putative regulatory sequences.
Results: We sequenced the posterior end of the HoxD cluster of a caecilian and performed comparative analyses
of this region using HoxD clusters of other vertebrates. We determined the presence of conserved non-coding
sequences and traced gains and losses of these footprints during vertebrate evolution, with particular focus on
amphibians. We found that the caecilian HoxD cluster is almost three times larger than its mammalian counterpart.
This enlargement is accompanied with the loss of one gene and the accumulation of repeats in that area. A similar
phenomenon was observed in the coelacanth, where a different gene was lost and expansion of the area where
the gene was lost has occurred. At least one phylogenetic footprint present in all vertebrates was lost in
amphibians. This conserved region is a known regulatory element and functions as a boundary element in neural
tissue to prevent expression of Hoxd genes.
Conclusion: The posterior part of the HoxD cluster of Typhlonectes natans is among the largest known today. The
loss of Hoxd-12 and the expansion of the intergenic region may exert an influence on the limb enhancer, by
having to bypass a distance seven times that of regular HoxD clusters. Whether or not there is a correlation with
the loss of limbs remains to be investigated. These results, together with data on other vertebrates show that the
tetrapod Hox clusters are more variable than previously thought.

Background
Perhaps the best studied gene clusters in animals are the
Hox clusters, not only for their importance in the establishment of the metazoan body plan, but also for their
tight genomic organization. Hox genes encode transcription factors that belong to the family of homeodomain
proteins and play an essential role in the establishment
of the anterior-posterior body axis during embryonic
development. In addition, they are also involved in

patterning of limbs and in organogenesis [1-4]. In
vertebrates, the expression domains of Hox genes are
collinear in space and time, and reflect their chromosomal arrangement [5].
Invertebrates possess one - often interrupted or disintegrated - Hox cluster, while all vertebrates have multiple clusters [6-8]. Gnathostomes typically have four Hox
clusters that arose by subsequent duplications in the
stem lineage of vertebrates, while most ray-finned fishes
contain seven (e.g. zebrafish) to thirteen (e.g. salmon)
clusters as a result of additional, teleost-specific genome
duplications and subsequent cluster losses [9-11]. Due
to these additional duplications, the gene content of the

fish Hox clusters is variable, with different gene losses in
different species examined. In contrast, the Hox complement of tetrapods is rather conserved, with the same
genes present in mammalian and bird genomes [7]. In
the genome of the frog Silurana tropicalis, at least one
and possibly two genes have been lost [12,13].
Hox gene clusters in vertebrates are compact (around
100 kb in mammals and even shorter in teleost fishes),
with highly conserved distances between paralogous
genes, and with little or no interspersed repetitive
DNA elements [14]. The only exceptions known so far
are squamate reptiles, with the lizard Anolis carolinensis as a striking example of having accumulated a substantial number of retrotransposons in its Hox clusters,
resulting in considerably larger cluster sizes [15,16]. In
general, the tight clustering of the Hox genes in vertebrates may be the result of an evolutionary constraint
to keep the genes in close proximity, thus maintaining
the intergenic distances and prohibiting insertion of
interspersed repeats [17]. This constraint may be facilitated by the presence of cis-regulatory elements within
the clusters that are shared by neighboring genes, as
well as by remote enhancers producing regulatory
landscapes that would be broken when the clusters
split [18]. In this context, a suite of global long-range
enhancers that control the expression of six genes
located 5’ of the HoxD cluster of fishes and mammals
has been discovered [19]. This Global Control Region
(GCR) reinforces the effect of another enhancer, Prox,
that drives the expression of the genes Lnp and Evx-2
- both adjacent to the 5’ end of the HoxD cluster - and
the posterior Hoxd genes (Hoxd-13 to Hoxd-10) in the
distal limb and genital buds (digit enhancer); it also
regulates the expression of Lnp and Evx-2 in the central nervous system (neural enhancer) [19-21]. The
action of the GCR in the nervous system is somehow
restricted by boundary elements between Evx-2 and
Hoxd-13, while in the limb bud its effect decreases
progressively with distance from the 5’ end of the
HoxD cluster [22-24].
Defects in Hoxd genes or gene regulation often have
an effect on limb development. For example, the mouse
Ulnaless mutation causes reduction of the zeugopod,
which is the result of the alteration of Hoxd gene
expression due to an inversion of the HoxD cluster and
subsequent change of cis-regulatory control [19,25,26].
Similar phenotypes can be observed in human mesomelic dysplasia patients, which results from microduplications in the HoxD cluster [27]. Normal limb
development can also be affected by mutations within
Hoxd genes. For example, the expansion of a poly-alanine tract in HOXD13 results in the synpolydactyly syndrome, with abnormal reductions, duplications and
fusions of digits [28].

Despite their differences in limb types, frogs and
salamanders are characterized by the presence of only
four fingers. Of all amphibians, caecilians (Gymnophiona) probably form the most enigmatic order, as
most of them spend their life hidden under the ground.
Similar to snakes, they have an elongated trunk and
have undergone secondary loss of limbs. The diversity
in body plan and limbs among the three amphibian
orders may have been affected by changes in Hox gene
sequence, or, more likely, regulation (e.g. [29]).
At present, the only amphibian genome sequence publicly available is from the frog Silurana tropicalis. We
constructed a BAC library of the aquatic caecilian Typhlonectes natans to obtain the sequence of the posterior
end of the HoxD cluster, including Evx-2, i.e. the part of
the cluster that is important in limb development and
which has been shown to be under control of the Global
Control Region. Comparative analyses of this region
with the orthologous region of other vertebrates and the
subsequent identification of conserved, non-coding,
putative regulatory elements may shed light on the
evolution of the caecilian body plan.

Results and Discussion
BAC sequencing and annotation

The haploid genome size of Typhlonectes natans was
estimated at 13.37 pg by flow cytometry with chicken
erythrocyte nuclei as an internal standard (data not
shown). A pooled BAC library of about 460,000 clones
with an average insert size of 107 kb from Typhlonectes
natans was constructed, comprising a theoretical 3.8 ×
coverage of the genome, and screened by PCR to isolate
a clone that contained the posterior HoxD cluster.
A single clone with an estimated size of approximately
115 kb containing Hoxd-13 was sequenced using 454
sequencing technology [30] and over 15,000 reads were
assembled into two supercontigs. The orientation of the
two supercontigs was determined by sequencing of both
BAC ends, and they were assembled into one final contig with a small gap arbitrarily set at 100 base pairs (bp)
because the total sequence length is consistent with the
estimated insert size. The total caecilian sequence comprises 116,633 bp, including a 100 bp gap (GenBank
HQ398255). An initial blastx analysis and the software
GenomeScan [31] identified the genes Evx-2, Hoxd-13,
Hoxd-11 and a large part of Hoxd-10. The exon-intron
boundaries were refined manually by alignment with
Hox sequences of other vertebrates. Hoxd-12 was not
found in these analyses.
Vertebrate posterior HoxD cluster comparison

We compared the posterior HoxD cluster of the
caecilian with the clusters of the horn shark, zebrafish,
coelacanth, frog, chicken, anole lizard, opossum, dog,

mouse and human. In the caecilian, the 5’ end of the
HoxD cluster, starting from the stop codon of Evx-2,
situated on the reverse strand, until the stop codon of
Hoxd-10 is 107 kilo base pairs (kb), which is over 2.5
times larger than the orthologous region in mammals
(approximately 40 kb) (Figure 1). Apart from the caecilian, the coelacanth and the lizard sequences are also
larger than average, with lengths of 82 kb and 95 kb,
respectively. The expansion of the caecilian HoxD cluster is mainly due to the lengthening of the intergenic
region between Hoxd-13 and Hoxd-11, which is over six
times larger than in the human. In the coelacanth, the
intergenic region between Evx-2 and Hoxd-12, where
the Hoxd-13 gene was lost, is almost four times longer
than the corresponding region in mammals. In the
anole lizard, not only the HoxD cluster, but also the
other three Hox clusters are significantly longer [15].
Global alignment with the other vertebrates uncovered
the remains of Hoxd-12 in the caecilian (Figure 2). The
presence of multiple frameshift-producing indels and
stop codons implies that it is no longer protein coding
and has become a pseudogene (ψHox-d12). As frogs and
caecilians comprise the basal split within amphibians
[32], the most parsimonious explanation for the absence
of Hoxd-12 from the Silurana tropicalis genome and its
pseudogenization in the caecilian is an early loss in
amphibian evolution with unequal rates of evolution in
T. natans and S. tropicalis, although two independent
loss events cannot be excluded. We also discovered a
pseudogene (ψHoxd-13) in the coelacanth posterior
HoxD sequence. A blastx analysis revealed fragments of
both exons that could still be aligned with other vertebrate Hoxd-13 genes.
The length of the coding sequences of Hox genes is
similar in both amphibian species, except for Hoxd-13,
which is over 100 bp shorter in Typhlonectes. In general,
most posterior HoxD coding sequences have comparable

Hoxd-13 and Hoxd-11, which are about 25% longer in
amniotes and placental mammals, respectively. The
amniote or mammalian expansion of the HOXD13 and
HOXD11 proteins can be attributed to sequences rich
in alanine, glycine, serine and proline. In HOXD13, a
homopolymeric repeat consisting of nine alanines in the
chicken and 15 alanines in mammals [28] is not present

in any other species. HOXD13 proteins are overall rich
in serine and alanine in mammals, but not in nonamniotes. In addition to the conservation of both exons
of each Hox gene, evolutionarily conserved regions were
also detected in non-coding intergenic and intronic
sequences. These conserved, non-coding sequences or
phylogenetic footprints may represent regulatory elements and non-coding RNA genes and were further
investigated.
Distribution of repeats

To investigate whether the caecilian HoxD cluster
expansion was accompanied by an accumulation of
repeats, we compared it to the Repbase database [33] of
known vertebrate repetitive elements using RepeatMasker [34] and Censor [35]. RepeatMasker identified 4.74%
of the sequence as part of transposable elements, while
Censor reports 7.45% interspersed repeats, mostly retrotransposons like LINES and SINES. It must be noted
that the hits are not always very strong because of short
alignment length. However, blastn searches of all the
repeats resulted in a significant match with known
repeats (e-value ≤ 1e-05) for 11 out of 54 repeats. Moreover, blastx searches of the intergenic regions recovered
one additional SINE and one LINE. The majority of the
repeats is located in the intergenic region between
Hoxd-13 and ψHoxd-12 (Figure 1). The same analyses
were performed for the other vertebrate sequences by
comparison with the repeat databases for the respective
species, if available. In the caecilian and the coelacanth,
the repeats are almost exclusively found in the large
intergenic region where the pseudogene is situated, i.e.
between Hoxd-13 and ψHoxd-12 in the caecilian and
between Evx-2 and ψHoxd-13 in the coelacanth. In the
lizard and zebrafish, transposable elements are dispersed
over the cluster, with a concentration of repeats between
Evx-2 and Hoxd-13 in the latter. Additionally, a self-self
blastn analysis was performed to identify direct and
inverted repeats that are not part of known transposons.
This revealed the presence of 30 inverted repeats (stemloop), 15 palindromes (stem) and 12 direct repeats
(minimum identity of 70%, e-value ≤1e-5) in the caecilian HoxD cluster. Again, almost all repeats are located
in the region between Hoxd-13 and the ψHoxd-12.
Some of these repeats are a part of transposable elements, but the majority is unknown. A similar result
was obtained for the coelacanth sequence. Here, no
direct repeats, 21 inverted repeats and 11 palindromes
were found, all located in the region between Evx-2 and
Hoxd-12, with several large stretches in the former
intron of ψHoxd-13. The anole lizard sequence also contains a large amount of inverted and direct repetitive
sequences, but spread across the cluster, which is in
concordance with the distribution of transposable

elements. Few or no additional repeats were found in
the other vertebrate HoxD sequences. The presence of
interspersed, repetitive DNA may undermine genomic
stability [36]. In vertebrate genomes, regions containing
developmental genes, such as Hox clusters, are usually
devoid of transposable elements [37], suggesting the
presence of a constraint against the invasion of foreign
elements into a region essential for development. The
caecilian, coelacanth, anole lizard and zebrafish have a
higher than average amount of repetitive elements in
the posterior HoxD cluster, and the caecilian and coelacanth also experienced the loss of a functional Hox
gene. Whether the presence of repeats attributed to the
pseudogenization of Hoxd-12 in the caecilian (and of
Hoxd-13 in the coelacanth), or whether the loss of
Hoxd-12 weakened the constraint and allowed repeats
to accumulate, remains unknown. In the human genome, pseudogenes are frequently found in the vicinity of
long inverted repeats [38].
Despite being essential for proper embryonic development, the loss of one Hox gene does not necessarily
have a negative impact on an organism’s phenotype, as
Hox genes can be functionally equivalent [39]. However,
expansion of the cluster may have an effect on gene regulation. Since all the genes in this region of the HoxD
cluster are under the control of the long-range enhancer
GCR, the loss of Hoxd-12 accompanied with the enlargement of the distance between Hoxd-13 and Hoxd-11
and the accumulation of repetitive elements in the caecilian may have an influence on the effect of the GCR
on the expression of Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-10. Whether
this effect, if any, is reflected in morphology, is
unknown, but it is worth mentioning that a similar cluster architecture was found in the corn snake [16]. Some
transposable elements have been exapted to modulate
gene regulatory networks (reviewed by [40]). As changes
in - especially developmental - gene regulation may lead
to morphological changes [41], the adoption of a highly
derived body plan, such as in caecilians, may have been
facilitated by transposable elements. It is possible that
caecilians and snakes have employed a similar mechanism of limb loss, though this is probably not the case in
other limbless squamates, since Hoxd-12 is present in
the slowworm Anguis fragilis [16].
Identification of phylogenetic footprints

More and more regulatory sequences and non-coding
RNA (ncRNA) genes are being discovered in the portion
of the genome that does not code for proteins [42].
Although it has been shown that not every regulatory
sequence is evolutionarily conserved and that an
apparent function cannot always easily be allocated to a
conserved sequence [43,44], screening genomes for evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences is a widely

Mannaert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:658
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/658

used strategy to discover potential regulatory elements.
Such elements are expected to be present in the vicinity
of transcription factors or developmental genes, such as
Hox genes [42]. We identified 33 evolutionarily conserved non-protein coding sequences, or so-called phylogenetic footprints, with the software tracker [45]
(Additional file 1). To distinguish putatively transcribed
footprints, we blast searched all footprints against the
NCBI database of ESTs, which resulted in the identification of eight footprints between 29 and 876 bp long, not
located within untranslated regions (UTRs), with one or
more EST matches (Additional file 2). Because EST data
are absent for many organisms, including coelacanth
and caecilians, we did not find ESTs corresponding to
these footprints for every organism. However, given the
high degree of sequence conservation and the finding of
ESTs of each footprint in at least two different organisms, we believe it is possible that transcription and perhaps the function of these elements are conserved.
Therefore, we consider these footprints to be putative
ncRNA genes, and the other, non-transcribed footprints
as potential cis-regulatory elements (Figure 1).
Non-coding RNAs are functional molecules that are
not translated into a protein. Instead, they are involved
in post-transcriptional modification or DNA replication
or have a regulatory function, and can be found in intergenic regions, introns and even in the UTR of genes or
overlapping with protein coding genes [46]. The gene
regulatory RNAs are usually small and act in trans by
post-transcriptional silencing of target genes through
the binding of complementary sites. Next to the large
number of small ncRNAs, an increasing number of long
ncRNAs is being described, which are at least 200 to
over 10,000 nucleotides long (reviewed by [47]). Long
ncRNAs can act independently of a target sequence, in
cis, by interfering with the transcription of a neighboring
gene, or in trans, by recruiting proteins that alter the
chromatin state [47]. One example of a regulatory
ncRNA in the HoxC cluster is HOTAIR, which epigenetically represses transcription of 40 kb across the HoxD
locus [48]. Screening of all the expressed footprints
against the Functional RNA Database [49] did not result
in the identification of any classified ncRNA. However,
four of them produced significant matches with putative
RNAs predicted by Evofold, which is a method to identify functional RNA structures in vertebrates by using a
combined probabilistic model of RNA structure and
sequence evolution [50]. In addition, in footprint fp1,
also known as CR3 [51], a significant RNA secondary
structure was predicted (p = 0.92). Seven of the
expressed footprints lie in the intergenic region between
Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-10 (Figure 1). What tracker considers to be multiple footprints may correspond to a single
potential ncRNA gene, as indicated by alignment of the

Page 5 of 9

region between Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-10 with the corresponding ESTs (not shown). Two of the expressed footprints were previously identified as regulatory regions
RVIII/RIX (fp26) and RX (fp20) ([52-55]. The fact that
these two regulatory regions appear to be transcribed
may shed new light on how they function.
Cis-regulatory elements can be anticipated in intergenic regions, in introns and in the 5’ and 3’ UTR of
protein-coding genes, and may act as a promoter,
enhancer, repressor or insulator [42]. In total, 24 footprints (fps) are putative cis-regulatory elements. Nine of
these were found in the intergenic regions, including the
area downstream of Evx-2; four footprints are located in
an intron, five located in the 5’ UTR and six located in
the 3’ UTR of the Hox and Evx-2 genes. Three of the
intergenic footprints were identified in previous studies
and are known as RXI (fp18) and RXII (fp9 and fp10)
[23,56]. Two other intergenic footprints (fp 2 and fp3)
are extremely conserved in all species used in this study
and are located downstream Evx-2. The reason for this
high degree of conservation however remains unclear
[51]. One footprint (fp23) that was found in the intron
of Hoxd-11 contains a HB1 element, which consists of
homeodomain binding sites. This element is previously
described from the intron of Hoxa7, the Drosophila
homolog Ubx, the introns of Hox4 genes and the intron
of Hoxa-11 [57-60]. Of the five footprints in the 5’UTR,
two also include the promoter region. The 5’ and 3’
UTRs of mRNAs play an important role in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression through
the presence of cis-acting elements and through interaction with micro-RNAs (miRNAs) [61,62]. Conserved
sequences in 3’ UTRs may contain potential target sites
for miRNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional
gene silencing. Micro-RNAs are short, single-stranded
RNA molecules of ~22 nucleotides that show at least
partial complementarities to their target mRNA. If the
miRNA is only partially complementary, a perfect match
between the seed (nucleotides 2 to 7) of the miRNA and
the target mRNA is necessary for inhibition of translation or for promotion of deadenylation [63,64]. Therefore all six footprints located in the 3’UTR of the genes
were screened for the presence of hypothetical target
sites for miRNAs. One footprint (fp15), located in the
3’UTR of Hoxd-13, contains a short motif of seven
nucleotides, with perfect match to the seed of the
miRNA miR-26.
Reconstruction of conserved element evolution

Gains and losses of putative ncRNAs and cis-regulatory
elements in vertebrate posterior HoxD clusters were
mapped on a vertebrate timescale under the Dollo parsimony criterion, i.e. assuming a single origin (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Reconstruction of vertebrate posterior HoxD cluster evolution. A Dollo parsimony reconstruction of the evolution of HoxD cluster
elements shows the ancestral presence of 16 conserved elements in jawed vertebrates. Divergence times of the species are taken from Alfaro et
al. [73]. A schematic representation of the posterior HoxD cluster with correct relative distances is shown on the right. The human cluster is
representative for placental mammals, except for the loss of footprint 14, which did not occur in other mammals. Potential ncRNAs are
symbolized by orange ovals, putative cis-regulatory elements by blue ovals. Gain of elements is shown as full ovals, with the respective footprint

reconstruction of footprint 11, which is due to missing data in the chicken sequence. Gains and losses of footprints were not dated.

the amphibian ancestor: fp9, which is one of two motifs
of RXII, and fp15, a small footprint in the 3’ UTR of
Hoxd-13. The conserved region RXII is a boundary element located in the intergenic region between Evx-2
and Hoxd-13, whose promoters are in each other’s vicinity. Unlike Hoxd genes, Evx-2 is expressed in the central nervous system, regulated by the neural enhancer of
the GCR. RXII is considered to function as an insulator
to prevent the ectopic expression of Hoxd genes in the
nervous system, since GCR regulation is not promoterspecific [23]. Although tracker failed to recover the
entire RXII element (fp9 and fp10) in the zebrafish,
short, apparently homologous sequences were found in
the zebrafish cluster in the same area as in other vertebrates [23]. Moreover, both footprints were found in the
horn shark, which points to their ancestral presence in
vertebrates, and therefore we conclude that fp9 was lost
in amphibians. Footprint 15 is a short DNA stretch of
~22 bp with a highly conserved motif of 7 bp located in
the 3’ UTR of Hoxd-13. This motif is somewhat degenerated in the coelacanth, which does not have a functional Hoxd-13 gene, and it is located around 14 kb
5’ to ψHoxd-13, which may indicate that this sequence

is not homologous to the other vertebrate fp15
sequences. On the other hand, pseudogenization of
Hoxd-13 and insertion of repetitive sequences may have
promoted the relative relocation of this element. For our
reconstruction, we considered all footprints as identified
by the tracker software to be truly conserved sequences.
Therefore, we conclude that this element originated in
Sarcopterygii, and was lost in amphibians. In theory, this
footprint can serve as a target for the microRNA miR26, which is expressed in neurons and astrocytes of the
developing mouse brain [65]. The absence of both
elements may indicate that restriction of Hoxd-13
expression in neural tissue is regulated differently in
amphibians.

Conclusion
The posterior HoxD cluster of the caecilian is much
larger than that of most known vertebrates due to the
accumulation of interspersed and inverted repeats
accompanied with Hoxd-12 gene loss. A similar event
occurred in the coelacanth and in the corn snake HoxD
cluster. Whether these occurrences are reflected in the
morphology of these species is not clear, but it is

Mannaert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:658
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/658

possible that caecilians and snakes adopted a similar
mechanism that resulted in body elongation and limb
loss. The distance created between two subsequent
genes that are under the control of the same long-range
limb enhancer is likely to have some effect on the action
of this enhancer on the genes after the void. A number
of conserved, non-coding regions have been identified in
the HoxD cluster, some of them showing extremely high
conservation among all vertebrates. While no new footprints arose in the amphibian lineage, at least one, and
possibly two conserved sequences were lost. These
results, together with data on other vertebrate Hox clusters show that tetrapod Hox clusters show more variation than expected previously.

Methods
Genomic library and DNA sequencing

High molecular weight DNA was extracted from erythrocytes from two Typhlonectes natans specimens and
was used to construct a BAC library according to Osoegawa et al. [66] and as described by Danke et al. [67].
The genome size was estimated by flow cytometry analysis using chicken erythrocyte nuclei as a standard.
EcoRI partial digests of the caecilian DNA were size
selected and inserted in the pCC1 BAC vector (Epicentre) and the library was combined in 2304 pools containing 200 clones each. The library was screened by
PCR with primers specific for Hoxd-13 (forward primer:
5’-GCAATGAAGGCGCCTCCAG-3’, reverse primer: 5’GGAGATATAGGTGTCGTGCCTCGG-3’) to isolate
the posterior end of the HoxD cluster. The positive
clone was 454 GS FLX-sequenced and assembled by
Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). The
clone was also end sequenced using BigDye 3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Several smaller
contigs were assembled manually and contig overlaps
were confirmed by PCR, except in one case where a gap
was present. Because the length of the two contigs is
consistent with the size of the insert, we inferred this
gap to be small and therefore arbitrarily set it at 100 bp.
Caecilian HoxD cluster annotation

The genes in the caecilian posterior HoxD cluster were
annotated by initial blastx searches of the entire cluster
sequence and with the program GenomeScan [31] using
mouse HOXD and EVX2 proteins as a training set.
Exon - intron boundaries were determined manually by
alignment with Hox sequences of other vertebrates.
HoxD alignments

Global alignments of the caecilian posterior HoxD cluster with other vertebrate HoxD clusters were performed
with MultiPipMaker [68] and VISTA [69]. The HoxD
clusters of the following species were used: Heterodontus

Page 7 of 9

francisci (horn shark, AF224263), Danio rerio (zebrafish,
UCSC Genome Browser) Latimeria menadoensis
(Indonesian coelacanth, FJ497008), Silurana tropicalis
(tropical clawed frog, JGI), Gallus gallus (chicken,
ENSEMBL), Anolis carolinensis (green anole, UCSC
Genome Browser), Monodelphis domestica (grey shorttailed opossum, ENSEMBL), Canis familiaris (domestic
dog, ENSEMBL), Homo sapiens (human, NT_005403)
and Mus musculus (mouse, AC_015584). The MultiPipMaker alignments were performed with mouse and
T. natans as reference sequence respectively.
Interspersed repeats and low complexity regions in all
clusters were masked by screening against a library of
repetitive elements if available for the organism by
RepeatMasker [34]. If no such library was available, as
for the horn shark, coelacanth, caecilian, lizard and
opossum, the sequences were compared to a database of
transposable element encoded proteins.
Repeat content

The repeat content of the HoxD clusters was determined with Censor [35] and RepeatMasker, using the
Repbase library of the species-specific or vertebrate
repeats and a database of transposable element encoded
proteins. All reported interspersed repeats were taken
into account. In addition, self-self blastn analyses were
performed to identify direct and inverted repeats within
each cluster. Only repeats with maximum 30% mismatch and an e-value ≤ 1e-05 were retained.
Analyses of phylogenetic footprints

The program tracker [45] was used to detect evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences or phylogenetic
footprints. This program is based on blastz [70] to produce initial local pairwise alignments of all pairs of the
input sequences. Only the intergenic regions between
two homologous genes are compared. After several filtering steps, these alignments, which contain a window
of 12 nucleotides with minimum identity of 75%, are
assembled into groups of partially overlapping regions,
resulting in local sequence alignments, or footprint cliques. To be able to detect conserved sequences in all
non-coding regions, introns were treated as intergenic
regions. This analysis was repeated using the same, but
repeat masked sequences and all footprints from both
analyses were combined. Not every footprint is necessarily conserved in each taxon, as its presence or absence
may be indicative of the loss of a cis-regulatory element
and a subsequent change in gene regulation. Phylogenetic footprints were treated as two classes: potential
(cis-) regulatory elements and putative non-coding RNA
genes. Conserved sequences found in the 3’ UTR of
genes were screened for the presence of hypothetical
target sites of miRNAs using TargetScan Release 5.1

Mannaert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:658
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/658

[63,71]. To detect whether footprints are expressed and
thus may be ncRNA genes, a blastn search of all footprints against the NCBI database of ESTs was performed. Footprints with one or more EST matches were
screened against the Functional RNA Database [49] for
similarity with known ncRNAs. In addition, the RNAz
server (Vienna RNA server, http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at)
was used to identify thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures in the
footprint alignments.
A Dollo parsimony reconstruction of the genes and
footprints was done with MacClade v4.06 [72] to assess
whether putative cis-regulatory elements and ncRNAs
were lost or gained during vertebrate evolution.
