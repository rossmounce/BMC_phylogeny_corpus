Abstract
Background: Two Calyptogena clam intracellular obligate symbionts, Ca. Vesicomyosocius okutanii (Vok; C. okutanii
symbiont) and Ca. Ruthia magnifica (Rma; C. magnifica symbiont), have small genomes (1.02 and 1.16 Mb,
respectively) with low G+C contents (31.6% and 34.0%, respectively) and are thought to be in an ongoing stage of
reductive genome evolution (RGE). They lack recA and some genes for DNA repair, including mutY. The loss of recA
and mutY is thought to contribute to the stabilization of their genome architectures and GC bias, respectively. To
understand how these genes were lost from the symbiont genomes, we surveyed these genes in the genomes
from 10 other Calyptogena clam symbionts using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: Phylogenetic trees reconstructed using concatenated 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences showed that the
symbionts formed two clades, clade I (symbionts of C. kawamurai, C. laubieri, C. kilmeri, C. okutanii and C. soyoae)
and clade II (those of C. pacifica, C. fausta, C. nautilei, C. stearnsii, C. magnifica, C. fossajaponica and C.
phaseoliformis). recA was detected by PCR with consensus primers for recA in the symbiont of C. phaseoliformis. A
detailed homology search revealed a remnant recA in the Rma genome. Using PCR with a newly designed primer
set, intact recA or its remnant was detected in clade II symbionts. In clade I symbionts, the recA coding region was
found to be mostly deleted.
In the Rma genome, a pseudogene of mutY was found. Using PCR with newly designed primer sets, mutY was not
found in clade I symbionts but was found in clade II symbionts. The G+C content of 16S and 23S rRNA genes in
symbionts lacking mutY was significantly lower than in those with mutY.
Conclusions: The extant Calyptogena clam symbionts in clade II were shown to have recA and mutY or their
remnants, while those in clade I did not. The present results indicate that the extant symbionts are losing these
genes in RGE, and that the loss of mutY contributed to the GC bias of the genomes during their evolution.

Background
Recent genome analyses have shown that the genomes
of intracellular obligate symbionts, which are vertically
transmitted to the next generation of their hosts, have a
tendency to reduce in size during evolution [1-3]. Generally, smaller genomes have a lower G+C content (GC
bias) [3], although there are some exceptions, e.g., a
symbiont of cicadas, Ca. Hodgkinia cicadicola has a very

small genome (150 kb) with a relatively high G+C content (58.4%) [4]. Genes for DNA recombination and
repair, i.e., recA and uvrA to C, are deleted in many
intracellular symbiont genomes [1,5,6].
Reductive genome evolution (RGE) has been extensively studied in insect symbionts. Buchnera strains,
which are intracellular heterotrophic symbionts of
aphids, have small genomes (0.45-0.65 Mb). Although
the genome architectures of the extant Buchnera strains
are stable, RGE is ongoing with small deletions at a
slower rate than in its early stage [7-9]. However, the
earlier stages of RGE are still largely unknown.

Intracellular symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria are
ubiquitous in deep-sea invertebrates such as Calyptogena clams [10]. Calyptogena clam symbionts are
thought to be vertically transmitted via eggs [11,12].
The similarity between the phylogenetic topologies of
Calyptogena clams and their symbionts indicates their
co-evolution [13], although the possibility of lateral
acquisition of the symbionts in some Calyptogena clams
has been reported [14,15]. The genomes of symbionts in
Calyptogena magnifica (Ca. Ruthia magnifica, Rma, 1.16
Mb) and in C. okutanii (Ca. Vesicomyosocius okutanii,
Vok, 1.02 Mb) have been reported [16,17]. They lack
large-sized repeated sequences (> 200 bp), phage and
mobile genetic elements [16,17]. A comparative analysis
of these genomes showed that the RGE in Calyptogena
symbiont genomes is currently ongoing and is still in an
earlier stage than that in the Buchnera strains [8].
Further, it has been reported that both of the Calyptogena symbionts lack genes for DNA recombination and
repair such as recA and mutY [17].
Recombinase RecA is a key enzyme for homologous
recombination [18]. It requires relatively long repeated
sequences (> 200 bp) for recombination [19] and is a
possible driving mechanism of dynamic genome rearrangement including large deletions. In RGE in symbionts
of Calyptogena clams, RecA probably functioned to
delete large gene sequences by recombination, consuming the long repeated sequences in the early stage of
RGE [8]. On the other hand, MutY is known to repair
A-G mispairs to C-G pairs [20]. Thus, the loss of mutY
is thought to cause decreasing G+C content of the
genome.
While losses of genes for DNA repair and recombination may occur spontaneously, they affect the later stage
of RGE by increasing mutation rates, affecting the GC
bias and regenerating short repeated sequences [8].
After the loss of recA, the genome architecture probably
stabilized in the clam symbionts [8]. In the insect symbiont Buchnera, recA was reported to be lost in its early
evolution [21]. The contribution of RecA to RGE in
intracellular symbionts is still controversial. It was
shown that small deletions with a size of up to 200 kb
occur without recognizable repeats via RecA-independent recombination events in Salmonella [22]. To
understand the roles of RecA-dependent and -independent recombination events in RGE in intracellular symbiosis, it is important to determine when and how recA
was lost in their lineages and the effects of its loss on
their RGE. However, little is known about the relationship between the loss of DNA repair/recombination
genes and RGE. To understand the effects of their loss
on RGE, we posed the question of whether these genes
had been lost before the divergence of the Calyptogena
clam symbionts or whether they remained in some

Page 2 of 13

symbionts thereafter. To address this question, we
searched for recA, mutY and/or their remnants in the
genomes of 10 Calyptogena clam symbionts in addition
to Rma and Vok.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships of Calyptogena clam symbionts

Before screening the genes for DNA recombination and
repair, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of 12
symbionts of Calyptogena clams (Table 1). Because the
resolution of the 16S rRNA tree was too low, we amplified and sequenced the 23S rRNA genes (Tables 2 and
3) from the symbionts and reconstructed trees using the
concatenated 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences (Figure
1). Two clades well supported with high bootstrap
values and posterior probabilities were identified. Symbionts of C. kawamurai, C. laubieri, C. kilmeri, C.
soyoae and C. okutanii (Vok) formed clade I, and those
of C. pacifica, C. fausta, C. nautilei, C. stearnsii, C. magnifica (Rma), C. fossajaponica and C. phaseoliformis
formed clade II (Figure 1). The bootstrap support for
clade II [bootstrap values at the node in the maximum
likelihood (ML) tree > 89, posterior probability = 1.00]
was slightly less than that for clade I (bootstrap values =
100, posterior probability = 1.00). In clade II, the symbionts of C. phaseoliformis and C. fossajaponica formed
a subclade with Rma, and the symbionts of C. stearnsii,
C. nautilei, C. fausta and C. pacifica formed another
subclade with a high bootstrap value (Figure 1). It is
noteworthy that the branch length from the node of
clade II (** in Figure 1) to Rma was longer than those of
other branches in clade II, and that the branch length
from the node of the radiation of the Calyptogena clam
symbiont (* in Figure 1) to the node of clade I radiation
(*** in Figure 1) was longer than that to clade II (** in
Figure 1). In clade I, two subclades respectively containing symbionts of C. kilmeri, C. soyoae and C. okutanii
(Vok) and those of C. kawamurai and C. laubieri were
not robust (Figure 1).
DNA recombinase gene, recA, in Calyptogena clam
symbionts

Using PCR with an internal primer set designed from
the conserved sequences of recAs of several gamma-proteobacteria (Table 2), we obtained an amplicon from the
genomic DNA of a C. phaseoliformis symbiont (data not
shown). The sequence obtained was shown to be a part
of recA by a BLASTX search in the DDBJ/GenBank/
EMBL. A search for a residual recA in the Rma and Vok
genomes using this sequence and the Escherichia coli
recA sequence revealed that the Rma genome contains a
DNA fragment similar to recA between Rmag_0799
(ABC transporter related, Figure 2A) and Rmag_0800

reductase, Figure 2A], but the Vok genome does not.
The entire recA sequence and its flanking sequences
from the C. phaseoliformis symbiont were amplified in
PCR using the primers recA_F and recA_R (Table 2),
which were designed from the franking conserved
sequences of the recA-like sequence in Rma (Rmag 0799
and Rmag 0800) and their respective corresponding
sequences in Vok [COSY_0725 (ABC transporter ATPbinding protein) and COSY_0726 (bifunctional riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibD)]. While Rmag_0800 and
COSY_0726 are annotated with different gene names,
they are homologous to each other.
In PCR using the primers recA_F and recA_R, amplicons with different lengths were obtained from 10 symbionts and sequenced (Table 3). These amplicons were
designated as recA-amplicons. In open reading frame
(ORF) analysis, we detected intact recA coding for 344amino acid RecA in the symbiont genomes of C. pacifica and C. fossajaponica as well as C. phaseoliformis

(Figure 2A). Their amino acid sequence identities to
that of E. coli were 70.0%, 70.6% and 70.3%, respectively.
However, Rma and the symbionts of C. stearnsii, C.
fausta and C. nautilei were shown to have defective
recAs. In Rma, highly degraded remnants of the recA
gene were detected (Figure 2A). In the symbionts of C.
fausta and C. nautilei, the recA was found to be
degraded into a few apparent ORFs (Additional file 1
Figure S1). In both of the symbionts, the 52nd codon
âGGTâ was replaced with a stop codon âTAG.â This was
found to be caused by the same insertion of âCCâ at the
151st-152nd base from the initiation codon of the original recA sequences (at the position between 483 and
484 in Additional file 1 Figure S1).
In the symbiont of C. stearnsii, the coding region of
recA was found to be fragmented by many stop codons,
which were caused by substitutions and a few base
insertions, i.e., the substitution of âCâ with âTâ makes
the stop âTGAâ at the 343rd (10th base from the initiation site in C. phaseoliformis recA) and the insertion of

âAâ between the 427th and 428th base makes the stop
âTAAâ at 438-440 in Additional file 1 Figure S1 (Figures
2A and Additional file 1 Figure S1). No common insertion, deletion or substitutional mutation was detected
between the symbiont of C. stearnsii and those of C.
nautilei and C. fausta. In the symbionts of C. pacifica,
C. fossajaponica, C. phaseoliformis, C. fausta and C.
nautilei, an apparently intact ORF coding recX was
found downstream of recA (Figure 2A). However, the
symbiont of C. stearnsii was found to contain a pseudogene of recX (Figure 2A).
We performed multiple alignments of the recA-amplicons of the symbionts and analyzed the deletion profiles
(Figure 2B). The longest amplicon was that of the symbiont of C. phaseoliformis or C. fossajaponica. They
were thus thought to be the most similar to that of the
common ancestor of clade I and II symbionts. In clade
II symbionts, the nucleotide sequence of the recAamplicon of the C. fossajaponica symbiont was the most
similar to that of the C. phaseoliformis symbiont, or vice
versa. However, the sequence identity of the recA coding
region between symbionts of C. phaseoliformis and C.
fossajaponica (90.1%) was lower than the identities of
those of symbionts of C. fausta, C. nautilei and C. pacifica compared with that of the C. phaseoliformis symbiont (95.6%, 95.5% and 95.3%, respectively). To
compare the sequences of recA-amplicons, we selected
that of the C. phaseoliformis symbiont as a reference.
Compared with the recA-amplicon of the C. phaseoliformis symbiont, that of Rma had several deletions (Figure 2B). Deletions of almost the same size were found
in symbionts of C. fausta (Figure 2B; from position 1857
to 2123 in Additional file 1 Figure S1) and of C. pacifica
(Figure 2B; from position 1859 to 2125 in Additional file

1 Figure S1), while no such deletion was found in the
symbionts of C. stearnsii, C. nautilei or C. fossajaponica
(Figure 2B).
In clade I symbionts, recA was not recognized in their
recA-amplicons. However, large deletions of a similar
size were found in their respective recA-amplicons (Figure 2B). While some DNA fragments corresponding to
the N-terminal RecA remained, recA was markedly disintegrated due to the large deletion (Figure 2B).
DNA repair gene, mutY, in Calyptogena clam symbionts

By performing a BLAST search of unannotated ORFs
and pseudogenes in the Rma genome [16], we found
that a translated amino acid sequence of Rmag_0017
(21165-22172) was homologous to MutY of other bacteria (48% identity to that of Alteromonas macleodii str.
deep ecotype or 45% identity to that of Thiomicrospira
crunogena XCL-2), but this gene was found to be a
pseudogene due to the amber mutation âUGAâ at codon
167. No such ORF was recognized in the Vok genome.
A primer set, mutY_F and mutY_R, was designed to
amplify the genomic region containing mutY (Table 2).
The PCR products were designated as mutY-amplicons.
An apparently intact mutY was found in each mutYamplicon of the genomes of clade II symbionts except
for Rma, i.e., symbionts of C. phaseoliformis, C. fossajaponica, C. pacifica, C. stearnsii, C. fausta and C. nautilei
(Figure 3A), of which the gene product showed significant similarity to MutY of other bacteria. DNA
sequence homology analysis with multiple alignment
showed that the nucleotide sequences of mutY-amplicons from symbionts in clade II except for Rma showed
greater similarity to that of the C. phaseoliformis symbiont (greater than 90%), while the identity with Rma

inframe deletions (3 bp and 15 bp; positions from 797
to 799 and from 974 to 988 in Additional file 2, Figure

mutY. On the other hand, the mutY-amplicons from
clade I symbionts were much shorter than that of the C.
phaseoliformis symbiont, showing that it was highly
degraded by deletions and substitutions (Figure 3B).

Because MutY was expected to contribute GC bias to
the genomes of the Calyptogena clam symbionts, we
analyzed the G+C contents of their 16S and 23S rRNA
genes (Table 4). The mean G+C content of the 16S
rRNA genes in clade I symbionts and Rma, which
lacked intact mutY, and that in clade II symbionts
except for Rma were 49.01 Â± 0.59 and 50.21 Â± 0.29 (%:
mean Â± SD), respectively. This difference was significant
in the t-test (p = 0.00119) (Table 4). Those of 23S
rRNA genes in the symbionts lacking mutY (clade I
symbionts and Rma) and in the symbionts with mutY
(clade II symbionts except for Rma) were 48.25 Â± 0.35
and 49.47 Â± 0.36 (%: mean Â± SD), respectively, and the
difference was significant (p = 0.000143) in the t-test.
The G+C contents of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of
Rma were 50.20% and 48.94%, respectively, which were
intermediate between those of the symbionts with or
without mutY (Table 4). This may indicate that mutY in
Rma became a pseudogene relatively recently.

Discussion
Previously, we reported that recA was probably lost in
the early stage of RGE in Calyptogena clam symbionts
[8]. The present study showed that some of the extant
clam symbionts still have intact recA (Figure 2). We
hypothesized that in the early phase of RGE of the clam

symbionts before the loss of recA, large-sized deletions
occurred due to RecA-dependent recombination [8].
This type of deletion requires repeated sequences larger
than 200 bp, which have been depleted from the genomes of Rma and Vok [8,19]. It is still not clear whether
the genomes of the Calyptogena clam symbionts containing recA have large-sized (> 200 bp) repeated
sequences. The presence of intact or of nearly intact
recA and of mutY in clade II symbionts except for Rma
suggests that the genomes of clade II symbionts are larger than those of clade I symbionts and that their RGE
is in an earlier stage than in clade I symbionts. To
resolve these questions, we must await their genome
sequence analyses.
The coding region of recA was shown to be mostly
deleted in Rma and clade I symbionts (Figure 2A and
2B). A similar large-sized deletion was found in each of
the recA-amplicons of clade I symbionts (Figure 2B).
This indicates that the shared part of their deletions
occurred in the common ancestor of clade I symbionts
after divergence from that of clade II symbionts [arrowhead (6) in Figure 1]. While both Rma and clade I symbionts lack recA, the phylogenetic tree strongly suggests
that these losses occurred independently in both the
ancestral Rma and the common ancestor of clade I symbionts (Figure 1).

Degradations of the ORFs for recA in Rma and in the
symbionts of C. stearnsii, C. fausta and C. nautilei indicate that RGE in the extant clade II symbionts of Calyptogena clams is in the transitional stage of recA loss.
The loss of recA may start with the degeneration of its
ORF by point mutations or a few base insertion/deletion
mutations like those in the symbionts of C. fausta, C.
nautilei and C. stearnsii (Figures 2 and Additional file 2,
Figure S1), then continue in the next stage with larger
deletions, e.g., those in Rma and in clade I symbionts
(Figures 2 and Additional file 2, Figure S1), generated by
successive illegitimate recombinations or replication
slippages without RecA [8,23]. This also suggests that
the longer (> 200 bp) repeated sequences were depleted
in the symbiont genome, and that as a result RecA was
not able to function as a recombinase or a deletion generator in the genome before losing this gene.
A three-dimensional (3D) homology model of RecA
reconstruction using the crystal structure of E. coli
RecA [24] as a template showed that the 3D structure
of RecA in the symbiont of C. phaseoliformis was similar
to that of E. coli (Additional files 3 and 4, Figure S3).
RecA consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain
functions as a monomer-monomer interface; the central
domain is responsible for ATP binding; and the C-terminal domain is responsible for dsDNA binding [24]. This
indicates that RecA in the symbionts of C. phaseoliformis, C. fossajaponica and C. pacifica are functional, and
that the truncated RecA in C. fausta and C. nautilei
symbionts having only the N-terminal 68 amino acids is
functionless (Additional files 3 and 4, Figure S3).
In the symbiont genomes of C. fausta and C. nautilei,
the truncations of their recAs were respectively caused
by the same two-base (CC) insertion mutations at the
same position of the gene (Additional file 1, Figure S1).
It is not clear whether the insertion occurred in the
common ancestor of the symbionts of C. fausta, C. nautilei and C. pacifica [arrowhead (5) in Figure 1] and the
inserted sequence was removed later in the symbiont of
C. pacifica, or whether the insertions occurred independently in the two symbiont lineages of C. nautilei and
C. fausta [arrowheads (3) and (4) in Figure 1]. If an
insertion occurs randomly at any position of the genome, the identical two-base insertion would not likely
have occurred independently at the same position of
two different genomes at approximately the same time.
This question should be addressed in future studies of
their genomes.
Because no common insertion/deletion or substitutional mutation making a stop codon was detected
among the symbionts of C. stearnsii, C. fausta and C.
nautilei, the mutations in the C. stearnsii symbiont
occurred independently in its lineage [arrowhead (2) in
Figure 1].

Page 9 of 13

The recAs of C. fausta and C. nautilei symbionts were
shown to have additional insertions (Additional file 1,
Figure S1). These insertions may have occurred after the
loss of the function of the gene by the insertion of âCCâ
as a result of the relaxation of selective pressure. While
RecA is known to be important for recombination and
repair mutations, like double-strand breaks of DNA,
intracellular symbionts tend to lose it [6]. The selective
pressure to retain recA probably remained in the early
evolutionary stages of the Calyptogena clam symbionts.
However, after the loss of large-sized repeated
sequences, the selective pressure for retaining recA may
have decreased.
In clade II symbionts, the present data indicate that
their recAs are currently deteriorating. This also supports the above hypothesis that the RGE stage due to
recA-dependent deletion is probably ending in these
extant genomes.
The DNA repair gene mutY was found in the genomes of clade II symbionts except for Rma (Figure 1).
In Rma, mutY was found to be split into two ORFs (Figure 3A) by a substitution of the 501st G with A, making
a new stop codon (Additional file 2, Figure S2). The
phylogenetic tree indicates that this mutation occurred
in the Rma lineage after divergence from the symbionts
of C. phaseoliformis and C. fossajaponica [arrowhead (1)
in Figure 1]. MutY has been shown to be composed of
the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Additional files
5 and 6, Figure S4) [25]. Substrate DNA binds to the
cleft between these two domains [26]. While 3D homology modeling showed that MutY of C. phaseoliformis, C.
fossajaponica, C. fausta, C.nautilei and C. pacifica symbionts seemed to have an intact 3D structure and to be
functional (Additional files 5 and 6, Figure S4), the split
gene products of the Rma mutY fragments are functionless (Additional files 5 and 6, Figure S4). The evidence
that the gene encodes an almost intact amino acid
sequence/architecture indicates that Rma lost the functionality of mutY relatively recently.
The G+C content of genomes generally tends to
decrease in obligate intracellular symbionts with
decreasing genome size [3]. MutY is known to repair AG mismatches to C-G [20]. The loss of mutY in a genome is expected to decrease the G+C content [8,27].
However, many insect intracellular symbionts such as
Buchnera spp. with genomes that have low G+C content
still have mutY [8]. In addition, a recently found very
small genome of the insect symbiont Ca. Hodgikinia
cicadicola lacking mutY has a high G+C content [4].
These may contradict the above view and indicate that
the loss of mutY does not significantly contribute to the
decrease in the G+C content of the genome. However,
in this study, the G+C content in the 16S and 23S
rRNA gene sequences was significantly lower in the

Kuwahara et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:285
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/285

Calyptogena symbionts without mutY than that in the
symbionts with mutY (Table 4). This supports the
hypothesis that the loss of mutY contributes to the GC
bias of the genome [20,27]. The G+C content of Rma
was intermediate between the two symbiont clades. This
agrees with the view that it lost functional mutY more
recently than clade I symbionts during evolution. This
result also coincides with the data showing that the G
+C content of the Rma genome (34.0%) is higher than
that of Vok (31.6%) [16,17]. Stewart et al. have recently
reported that the G+C contents of 9 genes including
16S and 23S RNA genes of the symbionts in the gigas/
kilmeri clade that corresponds to clade I in the present
study were significantly lower than those of another
clade that corresponds to clade II in the present study
(Additional file 7, Figure S5) [28]. Although it was not
clear whether the symbionts in the other clade reported
by Stewart et al. [28] had mutY or not, the present
results suggest that they do and thus the G+C contents
of their genes are higher than those of the symbionts in
the gigas/kilmeri clade.
It has recently been shown that mutational bias of
GCÂ®AT is a general trend in bacteria, and this trend
may be counterbalanced by biased gene conversion and
natural selection to maintain the G+C contents [29-31].
In intracellular symbionts, relaxation of natural selection, lower recombination frequency, small effective
population size, codon usage, availability of nucleotides
in the cytoplasmic pool and loss of DNA repair genes
may contribute to lower G+C content [4,31,32]. In addition to the loss of mutY, any of these factors may have
also contributed to a greater reduction of the G+C content in symbionts in clade I compared with those in
clade II. However, this remains to be studied in future.
The present phylogenetic tree shows that both mutY
and recA have been lost in Rma and in clade I symbionts
(Figure 1). Were the losses in clade I symbionts and Rma
accidental coincidences or related phenomena? The loss
of recA may increase the mutation rate of the genome
and hence increase the possibility of losing other genes
such as mutY. It is also noteworthy that the branch
length of Rma is longer than other branches in the clade
II lineage, and the branch length from the node between
clade I and II symbionts (* in Figure 1) to the node of
clade I symbiont radiation (*** in Figure 1) is longer than
the length to the node of clade II symbiont radiation (**
in Figure 1). As a result, the loss of recA which occurred
in Rma and clade I symbionts independently may have
increased the mutation rate and elongated these branch
lengths. This may also increase the probability of losing
other genes including mutY.
Once genes lose their functions, their selective pressure must be relaxed and their mutation rates are
expected to increase [33]. In the functionless recAs of C.

Page 10 of 13

fausta and C. nautilei, one additional mutation was
found in each (Additional file 1, Figure S1). Two additional deletions were also found in the Rma mutY
(Additional file 2, Figure S2). These may be the result of
the decreased (relaxed) selective pressure after the losses
of the functions of the genes.
While an evolutionary event like the loss of a gene for
DNA repair or recombination may occur spontaneously
in a certain lineage, it must greatly affect the later evolutionary fate of that lineage. We previously suggested that
the loss of recA probably stabilized the genome architecture in Calyptogena clam symbionts [8,34]. The present
data raise the possibility that the loss of mutY affected
the G+C content of the genomes of the Calyptogena
symbionts. The effect of losing genes for DNA recombination and repair on their RGE will be analyzed by
sequencing the genomes of other Calyptogena clam
symbionts, which is now in progress and will be published elsewhere.

Conclusion
The apparently intact genes for DNA recombination and
repair recA and mutY were found in some clade II symbionts, i.e., symbionts of C. phaseoliformis, C. fossajaponica and C. pacifica. Those of C. stearnsii, C. nautilei
and C. fausta had intact mutY but their recA was found
to be a pseudogene due to insertion/deletion and/or
substitution mutations. These genes were disintegrated
and lost in Rma and in clade I symbionts. Most of the
recA coding region was lost in the common ancestor of
clade I symbionts and in the Rma lineage as a result of
deletions. In the symbionts of C. stearnsii, C. fausta and
C. nautilei, recA became functionless due to small base
insertions and substitutions. The mutY gene of Rma was
disintegrated by a substitutional mutation. mutY was
also lost through deletions in the common ancestor of
clade I symbionts. The coinciding losses of both recA
and mutY in Rma and clade I symbionts are thought to
have occurred independently in the respective lineages.
The G+C contents of the symbionts with mutY were
significantly higher than in those without mutY. This
indicates that the loss of mutY probably decreased the
G+C contents of the descendant symbiont genomes.
This suggests that gene degradation, which occurs by
chance in some lineages of symbionts, greatly affects the
genomes of later descendants of the lineage.
Methods
Sample collection

Calyptogena clams were collected and stored at -80Â°C in
a freezer until use (Table 1). C. pacifica, C. stearnsii and
C. kilmeri were collected in Monterey Bay (Table 1) and
were kind gifts to JAMSTEC from Dr. J. Barry of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

DNA extraction

The gill tissue was dissected, washed with filtered (0.2Î¼m pore membrane filter; Millipore), sterilized artificial
seawater to remove bacteria attached to the gill surface
and chopped with scissors. DNA was extracted from
approximately 10 mg of the tissue with a DNeasy Tissue
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Although some bacteria attached to the surface of
the gill tissue might have remained after washing, only
the amplified products of the symbionts were detected
in PCR for the 16S rRNA gene. This indicated that bacteria contaminating the surface of the gills were far less
numerous than the symbionts.
Primer design

Almost whole-length genes for the small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and the large subunit ribosomal
RNA (23S rRNA) were amplified from 10 Calyptogena
clam symbionts with specific primers (Table 2).
Based on the conserved RecA amino acid sequences of
several gamma-proteobacteria, a set of internal consensus primers was designed for PCR amplification of recA
in the Calyptogena clam symbionts (Table 2). In PCR, a
DNA fragment amplified from C. phaseoliformis symbiont DNA was detected. A BLAST search showed that
the DNA fragment obtained was a portion of recA. We
then searched for recA or its remnant in the genomes of
Rma and Vok with BLASTX using recA in E. coli str.
12, substr. MG 1655 (accession number = NC_000913,
gene locus tag = b2699) as a reference and found a remnant gene sequence of recA in the Rma genome. A set
of primers was designed from the conserved franking
regions of the corresponding regions of the Rma and
Vok genomes. The primers were designated as the
external primers for recA (Table 2). Primers for PCR of
mutY were designed based on the franking regions of
the remnant sequences of mutY detected in the Rma
genome and their corresponding sequences in Vok
(Table 2).
Amplification of the ribosomal RNA genes, recA and
mutY, from Calyptogena clam symbionts

The genome regions containing 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA,
mutY, recA or their corresponding regions were amplified by PCR with the primer sets shown in Table 2.
According to the manufacturerâs instructions, the reaction mixture contained 1 Î¼l of template solution containing 100 ng of DNA, 5 Î¼l of 10Ã ExTaq buffer
(Takara), 4 Î¼l of dNTP mix (Takara), 1 Î¼l of the 10
pmol/Î¼l forward primer solution, 1 Î¼l of the 10 pmol/Î¼l
reverse primer solution, 0.25 Î¼l of ExTaq polymerase
solution (Takara) and 37.75 Î¼l of pure water. The reaction mixture was initially incubated at 96Â°C for 2 min,
then subjected to 35 cycles of the PCR protocol (96Â°C

Page 11 of 13

for 20 s, 55Â°C for 45 s and 72Â°C for 3 min) and finally
to extension at 72Â°C for 10 min with a Takara TP600
Thermal cycler. The reaction mixture (2 Î¼l) was applied
to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to check the amplicons. The gel was stained with 0.6% ethidium bromide
solution to visualize the amplicon bands. The amplified
DNA was purified with a Wizard SV Gel and a PCR
Clean-Up System Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.
The nucleotide sequences of the amplified and purified DNAs were determined using a Big Dye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an
ABI PRIZM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The
sequences obtained were submitted to DDBJ-EMBLGENBANK, and their accession numbers are listed in
Table 3.
Phylogenetic relationships of Calyptogena clam symbionts were analyzed using the genes for 16S rRNA and
23S rRNA, some of which were retrieved from DDBJEMBL-GENBANK. The 16S and 23S rRNA gene
sequences were concatenated and aligned using MAFFT
6 [34,35]. The alignment obtained was manually refined,
and ambiguous nucleotide positions were excluded
using Se-Al ver. 2.0all [36]. The aligned sequences (3128
bp) were analyzed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) and
maximum composite likelihood methods [37] and maximum parsimony (MP) methods with MEGA 4 [38,39],
as well as with the maximum likelihood (ML) method
with PAUP* 4.0 [39]. The NJ tree was constructed with
the maximum composite likelihood method distance
[37]. MP analysis was performed with a heuristic search
using close neighbor interchange (level = 1), a branchswapping method with initial trees generated by random
addition (10 replications); a complete deletion option
was used to treat gaps/missing data. Modeltest ver 3.7
[40] was used to select the appropriate model of evolution for the ML analysis, with the Akaike information
criterion. ML analysis was performed using the GTR+I
+G model [41], and optimized parameter values were
applied after the determination using Modeltest. The
reliability of the tree topology was assessed by bootstrap
resampling (number of pseudoreplicates: NJ and MP,
1000; ML, 100). They were also analyzed by the Bayesian method using MrBayes 3.1 [42]. The posterior
probabilities were calculated to assess the reliability of
the tree topology. For Bayesian analysis, we determined
the optimal model of sequence evolution for each of the
two genes (16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes) using
MrModeltest 2.2 [43]. The GTR+I+G model was
selected for both the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes.
Bayesian analysis was performed with random starting
trees and unlinked parameters and run for 5,000,000
generations, sampling the Markov chains at intervals of

Kuwahara et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:285
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/285

100 generations. Four heated Markov chains (using
default heating values) were used. The first 12,500 of
the 50,000 resulting trees were discarded as âburn-in.â
To ensure that Markov chains were not trapped on
local optima, Bayesian inferences were performed twice,
beginning with different starting trees, and apparent stationary levels were compared for convergence [44].
To locate recA and mutY in the amplified DNA fragments, a search was performed for an ORF, and then a
BLAST search against the NCBI protein database (nr)
was performed. Multiple alignments for their nucleotide
sequences were constructed using the Multi-LAGAN
program [45].
