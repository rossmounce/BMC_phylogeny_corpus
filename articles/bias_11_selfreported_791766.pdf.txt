Abstract
Purpose: The use of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has generated much debate concerning safety issues among the
general population and physicians. It was questioned if this is a safe vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the safety
of an inactivated monovalent H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine
Methods: We focused on the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix® and applied a self reporting
questionnaire in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) and medical students at a major university hospital.
Results: In total, 4337 individuals were vaccinated, consisting of 3808 HCWs and 529 medical students. The
vaccination rate of the employees was higher than 40%. The majority of individuals were vaccinated in November
2009. In total, 291 of the 4337 vaccinations were reported to lead to one or more adverse reactions (6.7%). Local
reactions were reported in 3.8%, myalgia and arthralgia in 3.7%, fatigue in 3.7%, headache in 3.1%.
Conclusions: Our data together with available data from several national and international institutions points to a
safe pandemic influenza vaccine.
Keywords: adverse reaction, healthcare worker, immunization, novel H1N1 influenza

Introduction
Various infectious diseases play a major role in occupational health. Next to classical diseases such as tuberculosis [1], new diseases including SARS [2-4] or the novel
influenza A H1N1/2009 virus [5,6] are endangering occupational health in the last years. The novel influenza A
H1N1/2009 virus was first identified in Mexico and led
to pandemic warning of the WHO in June 2009 [7].
Novel influenza A H1N1/2009 virus is often called
“swine flu” and represents a result of the reassortment
of different influenza viruses [8,9]. It was reported that
the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of A H1N1/2009 was
similar to that of swine flu viruses which are present in
United States pigs since the year 1999. By contrast, the
matrix protein (M) and neuraminidase (NA) genes are

found in European swine flu isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus shows that six
genome segments stem from a triple-reassortant virus
circulating in North American swine, seeded from
human, avian and classical swine lineages.
Concerning the pandemic, a first outbreak of Influenza-like illness occurred in Mexico and the USA in
April 2009 and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported seven cases of novel A/H1N1 influenza by this time.
By April 24 the WHO issued a health advisory on the
outbreak of “influenza like illness in the United States
and Mexico”. Despite measures by the Mexican government against the spread of the virus, the number of
confirmed cases raised to 2,099 by May 7 2009 [10].
One month later, on June 11, 2009, the WHO officially
declared a H1N1 pandemic [11]. This was the first pandemic since the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic. The
WHO alert level was lifted to phase 6.

Different vaccines were generated: In autumn 2009,
GlaxoSmithKline produced the vaccine Pandemrix ®
[12]. Other vaccines were Focetria®, made by Novartis
and Celvapan®, made by Baxter.
The safety of influenza vaccine is in the focus of
research since many years [13-17]. Due to a special
debate on the safety of the pandemic influenza vaccines
[18], it was the objective of the present study to analyse
the safety using a self reporting questionnaire approach
in the acute event of a pandemic and a novel vaccine
which was debated for its safety by the general population and healthcare worders (HCWs). We chose a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) and medical
students after vaccination with Pandemrix ® since
according to German federal recommendations HCWs
had a top priority for vaccination [19].

Period

The observed vaccination period began on October 26,
2009 and ended at December 30, 2009. All individuals
that were vaccinated after informed consent.
Self reporting questionnaire

Applying a cross-sectional study design, a self reporting
questionnaire (Tab. 1) was used that consisted of questions relating the time of the vaccination, the start of
symptoms, the duration of symptoms, the consultation
of a physician and the incapacity for work with duration.
The symptoms included in the questionnaire are presented in Appendix 1. The self reporting questionnaires
were received until 2010-01-31.

Results
Population

Methods
Vaccine

After the declaration of the pandemic, the German federal commission for vaccination (STIKO) recommended
the vaccination for HCWs. The local occupational
health service of the University Hospital Berlin Charité
was supplied with 6000 Pandemrix® doses on October
26, 2009.
The active antigen of Pandemrix® derived from the A/
California/7/2009 (H1N1). Pandemrix® also contains an
immunologic adjuvant AS03 which consists of DL-atocopherol (vitamin E), squalene and polysorbate 80.
Thiomersal (thimerosal) is added as a preservative.
Other components are formaldehyde, sodium deoxycholate, and sucrose [20]. The vaccine is generated in hen’s
eggs and therefore also contains traces of egg proteins.
A single dose of the vaccine was injected by occupational physicians with the recommended dosage and
vaccination procedure.
Sample selection method

In the situation of a pandemic and the acute supply of a
novel vaccine which included the immunologic adjuvant
AS03 and thiomersal (thimerosal), and a public debate
about the safety of this vaccine, the sample selection
method based on the assessment of all individuals that
were vaccinated after informed consent at the occupational medicine centre of Germany largest university
hospital. No specific further sample selection methods
were applied.

In total, 3808 HCWs and 529 medical students were
vaccinated. The peak of vaccinations was November 13
2009 with 459 vaccinations at one day (Figure 1).
Self reported adverse reactions

Overall, 291 of the 4337 vaccinated individuals returned
the questionnaire and reported adverse reactions. This is
a rate of 6.7%. The majority of reported adverse reactions was found in the age between 30 and 39 years.
(Figure 2)
The most frequently reported local site reactions were:
local pain/pruritus or the sensacion of heat at the injection site in 3.8% out of the 4337 vaccinations, myalgia
or arthralgia in 3.7%, induration or erythema at the
injection site in 2.6%, lymph node swelling in 0.9%, skin
rash in 0.3% and ecchymosis at the injection site in 0.1%
(Figure 3).
The presence of systemic adverse reactions were
reported as follows: fatigue in 3.7%, headache in 3.1%,
flu-like symptoms in 2.3%, shivering in 1.9%, temperature > 38°C in 1.3%, dizziness in 1.1%, increased perspiration in 1.1%, gastrointestinal symptoms in 1.0%,
drowsiness in 0.9%, , insomnia in 0.7%, formication in
0.3%, Further some severe reportable adverse reactions
were observed (0.5%, Figure 3) as one case of facial
nerve paralysis, one case of rheumatoid arthritic symptoms and one case of skin alteration which was reported
to the local health authorities and the Paul-EhrlichInstitute.
Duration of symptoms

Population

In total, 3808 HCWs and 529 medical students were
vaccinated with Pandemrix® after informed consent.

The mean duration of symptoms lasted 3.5 days, the
maximal duration of symptoms was reported with 40
days.

Leave of absence

Overall, 42 HCWs (0.97%) were not able to work due to
the adverse reactions (Figure 4). The resulting leave of
absence was 2.7 days in mean with a maximum absence
of 14 days in one case. In total, there were 115 days of
absence recorded.

Discussion
Personal protective equipment is important to prevent
transmission of novel A/H1N1 as stated earlier by Shine

Figure 2 Distribution of age of study participants.

et al [21]. However, vaccination is the most effective
means of preventing influenza transmission and associated morbidity and mortality. It is most important to
realize that an effective measure against a pandemic is to
have vaccinated and well-informed health care workers.
Unfortunately, the A/H1N1 vaccination coverage was
extremely affected by an ongoing public discussion
about potential side effects. Therefore, we analysed self
reporting questionnaires concerning adverse reactions in
4337 HCWs and medical students.

Of course, this study - that was initiated in the acute
event of a pandemic and a safety discussion - has a variety of limitations. Apart from the paucity of demographic data, self reporting questionnaires are largely
limited since there may be a number of individuals who
do not return the questionnaire despite adverse reaction
manifestation. However, there was a need to assess
potential adverse reactions since the general population
and the HCWs asked for data about the new vaccine.
Therefore, we decided to undertake a self reporting
study despite that fact that the extent of underreporting
of side effects can not be examined precisely in the chosen design. It is noteworthy that with our self reporting
system we found a rate of 6.7% (291 of 4337 vaccinations). This frequency differs slightly from data from
other studies but points to a safe vaccine in terms of
acute adverse reactions. A prospective, randomised
study with 178 participants by Vajo et al. concluded that
all adverse events were rare, mild, and transient. Using
the vaccine Fluval P, the most frequent reactions in this
study were pain at injection site (eight cases) and fatigue
for 1-2 days after vaccination (three cases) [22]. Concerning the vaccination rate we can report a rate of
4337 of about 10 000 employees of the hospital. This is
a vaccination rate of over 40%. In a parallel study in
Frankfurt/Main, the influenza vaccination rates of the
HCWs of the University Hospital Frankfurt were measured. In this study, we were also able to show that the
2009 vaccination rate (seasonal influenza [40.5%], swine
flu [36.3%]) was better than the average annual uptake
of influenza vaccine in the German health care system
(approximately 22% for seasonal and 15% for swine flu)
[23].
In meantime, a number of studies were published that
also addressed safety issues of the H1N1 vaccination in
healthcare workers [24-26]. I.e. an inactivated, splitvirus, unadjuvanted AH1pdm vaccine, manufactured in
Japan, was given to HCWs from October 19, 2009. A
retrospective cohort study was conducted and and
severe adverse events were rare [24]. A recent study
using monovalent vaccination (Panenza; Sanofi Pasteur,
Val de Reuil Cedex, France) among HCWs in a university hospital setting in Thailand also reported a low rate
of side effects. The most common adverse reaction was
fatigue/uncomfortable feeling (24%) [25].

Conclusions
It can be summarized that our data points to a safe pandemic influenza vaccine in our 4337 vaccinations. It
needs to be taken into account that the use of self
reporting questionnaires leads to differing results concerning the frequency of adverse reactions, of course.
Therefore, this mode of reporting should be interpreted
cautiously and only applied in the acute event of

pandemics/novel vaccines that are administered without
