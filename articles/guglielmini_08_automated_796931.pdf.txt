Abstract
Background: Although often viewed as elements "at the service of" bacteria, plasmids exhibit
replication and maintenance mechanisms that make them purely "selfish DNA" candidates. Toxinantitoxin (TA) systems are a spectacular example of such mechanisms: a gene coding for a cytotoxic
stable protein is preceded by a gene coding for an unstable antitoxin. The toxin being more stable
than the antitoxin, absence of the operon causes a reduction of the amount of the latter relative
to the amount of the former. Thus, a cell exhibiting a TA system on a plasmid is 'condemned' either
not to loose it or to die.
Results: Different TA systems have been described and classified in several families, according to
similarity and functional parameters. However, given the small size and large divergence among TA
system sequences, it is likely that many TA systems are not annotated as such in the rapidly
accumulating NCBI database. To detect these putative TA systems, we developed an algorithm that
searches public databases on the basis of predefined similarity and TA-specific structural
constraints. This approach, using a single starting query sequence for each of the ParE, Doc, and
VapC families, and two starting sequences for the MazF/CcdB family, identified over 1,500 putative
TA systems. These groups of sequences were analyzed phylogenetically for a better classification
and understanding of TA systems evolution.
Conclusion: The phylogenetic distributions of the newly uncovered TA systems are very different
within the investigated families. The resulting phylogenetic trees are available for browsing and
searching through a java program available at http://ueg.ulb.ac.be/tiq/.

Background
Plasmids are autonomously-replicating extra-chromosomal circular DNA molecules usually nonessential for
cell survival under non-selective conditions and widely
distributed in prokaryotic cells. Because plasmids sometimes bear genes that provide bacteria with functions
(such as virulence, resistance to drugs, the ability to
exploit a specific source of carbon) that can be adaptive in

variable environments, they are often viewed as elements
"at the service of" a (intra- or inter-specific) pool of bacteria, thus allowing the long-term survival of these lines or
species. However, their ability to autonomously replicate
makes plasmids possible purely "selfish DNA" candidates. Indeed, some plasmids exhibit features that seem to
be strictly restricted to mechanisms related to their maintenance in cell lines (through replication and partitioning

mechanisms) or dispersal across cell lines or species
(through conjugation mechanisms).
Poison-antidote, or Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, were
first discovered on plasmids [1] and associated to plasmid-maintenance mechanisms. Later, several TA systems
were identified on chromosomes [2-5] and interpreted as
bacterial programmed cell death or stress response loci
[2,6,7]. Thought to occur in many Prokaryotic species [8],
most TA systems are organized as follows: a gene coding
for a cytotoxic and stable protein is preceded by a DNA
sequence coding for an unstable antitoxin (or "antidote")
protein or antisense RNA that can neutralize the toxic protein or its corresponding mRNA, respectively. The instability of the antitoxin protein is due to specific
degradation by a protease [9,10]. Most systems investigated to date (i) involve a proteic (rather than RNA) antitoxin that efficiently sequesters the toxin, and (ii) exhibit
a tandem organization with a single promoter and a small
distance (about 20–30 bases), or even an overlap (about
20–30 bases), between the antitoxin and toxin genes (Fig.
1a). The transcription of the system is auto-regulated by
the binding of the antitoxin (and/or the [antitoxin+toxin]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/104

complex) to the promoter region of the operon [11,12].
We hypothesize here that, despite the instability of the
antitoxin, cells containing such an operon survive probably because the frequency of translation termination is
increased after the stop-codon of the antitoxin (for example due to the overlap and/or frame-shift between the two
genes) making the antitoxin protein more abundant than
the toxin protein. Once a bacteria has received one or
more copies of the system (through cell division or horizontal transfer), that cell is 'condemned' either not to
loose the operon or to die (Fig. 1b) because absence of the
operon would cause a reduction in the amount of antitoxin relative to the amount of toxin through degradation
of the former (that cannot be replenished) prompting, in
turn, the poison to exert its toxicity on an essential intracellular host target, such as the gyrase or RNA translation
mechanisms [6,13,14], eventually causing cell death or
cell-cycle arrest. Note that TA systems have been domesticated as biotechnological tools [15] for facilitating DNA
engineering and protein production without the use of
antibiotics [16].

system is auto-regulated by the binding of the antitoxin (and/or the [antitoxin+toxin] complex) to the promoter region (yellow) of the operon. In the absence of the TA operon, the unstable antitoxin is degraded by a protease (green) and the poison
can exert its toxicity on an essential intracellular host target.

Different TA systems have been described and classified in
several families, according to the target of the toxin and/
or the nature of the protease that degrades the antitoxin
[17]. Recently, about 150 toxin genes have been separated
into 4 groups on the basis of sequence or structure similarities and gene neighborhood criteria [18]: the "families" relE/parE, mazF/kid/ccdB, and Doc, as well as the
family of proteins sharing a "PIN-domain". On the basis
of phylogenetic analyses, these families have been suggested to be non-homologous [18], i.e., the TA systems
would have appeared at least four times independently
during evolution.
As known TA systems, identified on different plasmids,
phages, and prokaryotic (including archaeal) genomes are
all very small and potentially very divergent (TA systems
originated from one or a few very old radiations), we
hypothesize that many TA systems might not be annotated as such in the NCBI database. However, given that
(i) TA-bearing plasmids with broad host range can be
found in multiple bacterial species, and (ii) most systems
exhibit the structural organization outlined above, we predicted that many more descendent systems than previously described should be detected across a wide range of
prokaryotic genomes and plasmids. To detect these putative TA systems, we developed an algorithm, implemented
into a computer program, TAQ V1.0 (for "TA Query"), that
searches public databases on the basis of predefined similarity and TA-specific structural constraints. Our algorithm is complementary to that implemented in RASTABacteria [19]. The latter first identifies sequences exhibiting conserved putative TA domains and then uses structural constrains to further restrict and score the resulting
set of putative TA systems. Our approach, using a single
starting query sequence for each of the ParE, Doc, and PIN
families and two starting sequences for the MazF/CcdB
family identified over 1,500 putative TA systems, of which
many were unknown. These five groups of sequences are
analyzed phylogenetically for a better classification and
understanding of TA systems evolution.

Results and Discussion
In order to produce a single set of homologous sequences
per family, we performed one TAQ V1.0 search for each
family of TA systems starting with a single poison (the
ParE toxin from the E. Coli RK2 plasmid for the relE/parE
family [20]; the MazF toxin from the delivery vector
pIEF16S for the mazF/kid/ccdB family, [21]; the VapC toxin
from Leptospira interrogans [serovar Lai str. 56601] for the
PIN-domain family [18,22], and the Doc toxin from the
Enterobacteria phage P1 for the Doc family, [23]). Since
we did not find any CcdB sequence during the search
using the MazF toxin as query (despite that CcdB and
MazF are thought to belong to the same family), we also
run one search using CcdB from the F plasmid as the starting sequence. In each case, the program TAQ V1.0 converged after 1 or 2 days of computation on a standard Intel
Pentium 4 computer (2.0 GHz) and generated the results
summarized in Table 1.
Although induced expression of the bacterial RelE toxin in
yeast and in human cell lines indicated the broad potential activity of TA systems [24,25], none of the sequences
that met all the sequence similarity and structural criteria
defined in our algorithm are found in eukaryotic
genomes. On the other hand, other categories include
eukaryotic sequences: e.g., Tetrahymena thermophyla (Alveolata), Debaryomyces hansenii (Fungi), and Dictyostelium
discoideum (Mycetozoa) in the ParE "Bad poisons" category,
and Cryptosporidium hominis (Alveolata) in the ParE "without antidote poisons" category; Aspergillus fumigatus (Ascomycota), Coccidioides immitis (Ascomycota) Macaca
mulatta (Mammalia), Drosophila melanogaster (Insecta),
Mus musculus (Mammalia), Homo sapiens (Mammalia),Gallus gallus (Aves), Rattus norvegicus (Mammalia),
Pan troglodytes (Mammalia), Canis lupus (Mammalia), Bos
taurus (Mammalia) in the Doc "Bad poisons" category.
Some of these sequences contain a domain (Fic domain in
the Drosophila and Mus sequences; HYPE domain in other
mammals and the chicken) that has been suggested to be
homologous to the Doc domain [18].

Values represent the number of sequences in each category. The " in silico inferred toxins" are sequences that meet all the constraints implemented
in TAQ whereas the "bad poisons" do not match the length constraints and the "without antidote poisons" meet the size constraints but do not
exhibit an ORF of constrained size and position (see text for details). "Artificial" sequences are engineered sequences such as cloning vectors.

Figure 2a shows the assignment of the ParE "in-silico
inferred toxins" to functional categories. Note that this classification is simply based on the annotation of the corresponding sequences as provided by the NCBI database.
The bulk of the sequences uncovered by our algorithm are
annotated by the NCBI as "ParE", "RelE", "unknown",
and "toxins". Note that annotation of the NCBI database
is improving fast: the "unknown" category moved from
the most frequent to the third most frequent category in 7
months (Fig. 2a&2b). Similarly, the erroneous annotation
of 2 sequences as "Doc" and "KidB" disappeared in the
most recent run. We suggest that, without accurate and
extensive functional data (for example on the exact mechanism by which each poison exerts its action), a phylogenetic approach might generate the most appropriate and
objective classification (e.g., because it is likely to be reasonably stable to the addition of new sequences). Note
that one preliminary run of our program TAQ V1.0 with
low BLAST stringency (E-value of 1 instead of 0.1) col-

lected about 30 sequences annotated as belonging to the
"merR" gene family, whose members are involved in
metallic-ion metabolism [26]. Visual inspection of the
run log files indicates that the low stringency of the similarity search generated a (probably inapt) hit on one merR
protein, which, in turn (when used as query), collected
additional members of the family. The merR genes happened to meet the structural constraints because they
form operons with short genes arranged in tandem. Note
that changing the E-value from 1 to 0.1 caused the loss of
very few sequences of the category "unknown", suggesting
that the merR family was the only significant artifact.
Figure 3a shows the assignment of the 216 MazF "in-silico
inferred toxins" to functional categories. Most sequences
uncovered by our algorithm are annotated by the NCBI as
"ChpA", "ChpK", "MazF", "PemK", "Kid", and
"unknown". The frequency of the latter category is much
smaller than in the run using ParE as query. Note that one

Figure 3c shows the assignment of the 86 Doc "in-silico
inferred toxins" to functional categories: about 10% of the
sequences are annotated as unknown, whereas all remaining sequences are annotated as "Doc".
The run that was started with a single member of the PIN
family generated 1418 putative toxins, 544 bad poisons,
and 611 without-antidote poisons. Among the 1418 putative toxins, 381 are known VapC toxins, 163 are
unknown, and 556 are simply annotated as containing a
PIN domain. However, as the PIN domain is not specific
to TA systems, it is highly likely that the first step of our
TAQ algorithm (i.e. the BLASTP search) returns many
false positives (i.e., sequences that are not TA systems)
that are not efficiently filtered out by the structural-constrain criteria. One example is the FlbT protein clearly
involved in the flagellum biosynthesis [27]; note that one
cannot exclude the possibility that some proteins regulating gene expression (e.g., the FlbT gene product may act as
a negative regulator of the flagellin fljK gene expression
[28]) originate from TA systems. Surprisingly, TAQ even
identified known Phd antitoxins. Hence, to avoid comparing non-homologous sequences, we decided to
decrease the E-value to 10-3. Under that setting, TAQ did
not recover any FlbT, Phd, or any other sequence that can
readily be identified as false positives.
This second run generated 860 putative toxins, 121 bad
poisons, and 87 without-antidote poisons. Among the
860 putative toxins, 368 are known VapC toxins, 89 are
unknown, 25 are annotated as toxins and 377 as containing a PIN domain (Fig 4).
We compared the results of TAQ to those obtained by
RASTA-Bacteria [19], a program that searches for putative
TA systems in a specific organism but that restricts the
BLAST search to known TA domains before applying additional structural constraints (ORF size, occurrence of an
operon). RASTA-Bacteria finds many more putative TA
elements (including isolated putative poisons or putative
antidotes) than does TAQ because the latter uses more
stringent size criteria (and constraint for the presence of
both a toxin and an antitoxin genes) to minimize the risk
of false positives that would seriously jeopardize the phy-

logenetic analyses. RASTA-Bacteria and TAQ have different objectives as the former attempts to score putative
Toxin or Antitoxin elements whereas the latter attempts to
generate a phylogeny among poison sequences that are
very likely to belong to real TA systems (because they are
all associated to a putative antidote and they all meet multiple size and localization criteria).
For a meaningful evolutionary analysis of the large sets of
proteins recovered by TAQ, an additional criterion (e.g.,
the use of RASTA-Bacteria to test for the presence of an
antitoxin domain in the putative antitoxin sequence)
would be warranted. Unfortunately, RASTA-Bacteria does
not allow, in its present form, to perform automated multiple searches using batch files.
Ancestral sequences tree
After initially grouping sequences by query, we manually
separated or merged groups for generating low ambiguity
alignments. We used 35 groups for the ParE analysis, 12
groups for the MazF analysis, 7 groups for the Doc analysis, and 54 groups for the VapC analysis. Sequences within
each group were then aligned and used to produce ML
phylogenies. Then, the 35 inferred ML root sequences
(MLRS) for the ParE analysis (12, 7, and 54 MLRS for the
MazF, Doc and VapC analyses, respectively) were themselves aligned and analyzed phylogenetically (see Methods for details). The final trees and their branch support
values are available through TIQ v1.0, a Java program,
available at [29] (using the login "tiq" and password "yqgWrj.81"). TIQ allows browsing the trees, select branches,
perform searches of NCBI annotation fields (such as
sequence, taxa names, Global Identifiers (GI), etc.) and
filter sequences according to the host taxonomy. The 22

CcdB sequences were simply incorporated into a single
MrBayes analysis.
Supertree
For the ParE analysis, after grouping hits on the basis of
the query sequence(s) that generated them, we obtained
710 groups of which many were highly redundant. Using
the algorithm described in the Methods section, we
reduced that number to 111 partially-overlapping groups
that collectively contain all putative TA systems uncovered
here. We then inferred the ML phylogenetic relationships
among sequences within each group, generating 111 trees
that are partially overlapping in terms of the included
sequence. The overlapping trees were then used as input
for "supertree" inference (see Methods section). The strict
consensus among the 4 best supertrees (score 310.49) is
available through TIQ v1.0 (see above). Similarly, for the
MazF analysis, the initial 227 highly redundant groups
were reduced to 76 partially-overlapping groups that collectively contain all uncovered putative TA systems. The
single best supertree (score 157.57) is available through
TIQ v1.0. For the Doc analysis, the initial 86 highly redundant groups were reduced to 9 partially-overlapping
groups that collectively contain all uncovered putative TA
systems. The strict consensus among the 17 best supertrees (score 11.72) is available through the java program
TIQ v1.0. Finally, for the VapC analysis, the initial 860
highly redundant groups were reduced to 208 partiallyoverlapping groups that collectively contain all uncovered
putative TA systems. The 50% majority-rule consensus
among the 115 best supertrees (score 246.91) with a cutoff value of 50% is available through the java program
TIQ v1.0. No supertree analysis was run for the 22 CcdB
sequences given the small size of that dataset.
Consensus among methods
Given (i) the very large divergence among the very short
poison sequences from TA systems (even within each of
the major families: ParE, MazF, Doc and VapC), (ii) the
heuristic nature of the inference methods used here (see
below), and (iii) that ML models used are only approximations of the real substitution process across the billions
of years of TA systems history, a high degree of uncertainty
is very likely attached to the phylogeny analyses performed here. However, given that the two heuristics used
are quite different (i.e., either inferring relationships
among reconstructed most likely ancestral sequences of
predefined groups of poison sequences or using a supertree approach among a set of overlapping trees), a consensus between the two resulting phylogenies might
highlight the most robust portions of these trees. Hence,
for each major family, we combined the trees generated by
the two approaches into an Adams consensus tree (Fig. 5,
6, 7 and 9). An Adams consensus [30] typically preserves
more structure than a strict consensus by displaying "nest-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/104

ings", rather than clades, shared among trees (given two
sets of leaves, A and B, and a tree T, set A nests inside set B
if (i) A is a subset of B, and (ii) the leaves in set A have a
more recent common ancestor in T than do the leaves in
set B). In other words, one group is said to nest within a
larger group if the most recent common ancestor of the
smaller group is a descendant of the most recent common
ancestor of the larger group, which needs not require
monophyly of either group. The consensus trees, presented in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 9 are also available (for
browsing and searching) through the java program TIQ
v1.0 (see above). The CcdB tree (Figure 8) is also available
through TIQ.
Origin of the TA systems
Very little objective data is available to shed light on the
origin of the TA systems. Considering the structural relative similarity (i.e., the criteria implemented in our software TAQ V1.0, see Methods section) among known
systems, Gerdes [17] suggested that they all share a common ancestor. However, the evolutionary relationships
and functional (dis)similarities among TA families are
unclear. For example, the similarities between, on one
hand, toxin sequences from the RelE family and, on the
other hand, those from the ParE family (see refs [8,31]
and analyses above) demonstrate that the two families are
homologous (i.e., they share a common ancestor). However, RelE and ParE proteins are thought to exert their
toxic activity on different targets: mRNA cleavage for RelE
and DNA gyrase for ParE [7]. Similarly, MazF and CcdB
proteins are thought to be homologous because they
share the same basic tertiary structure [31,32]. Finally,
Schmidt et al. [33] described an "hybrid" TA system, i.e.,
whose antidote sequence is similar to the MazE antitoxin,
whereas its toxin sequence is similar to RelE, providing a
putative evolutionary link between the RelE/ParE and
MazF/CcdB superfamilies.

Conversely, other scholars suggested that TA systems
evolved several times independently. For example, on the
basis of protein domains and "gene-neighborhood analysis", Anantharaman and Aravind [18] proposed that RelE/
ParE, MazF/CcdB, Doc, and PIN form different TA superfamilies that have been assembled more than once during
the evolution, from a limited pool of protein domains.
To test for the possible homology among TA superfamilies, we run TAQ using PSI-BLAST criteria (e-value of
10.0 and PSI-BLAST threshold of 0.1, 10 iterations) more
permissive than in a classical TAQ run (see Methods).
Using ParE as input, we found 4ζ toxins from the ω -ε -ζ
system, as well as a sequence containing the PIN domain
(previously detected in some VapC toxins [18] of the
VapBC system [22]). This result suggests possible homologies among ParE/RelE, ζ, and VapC families, and the

sequences might bridge additional putative phylogenetic
gaps among TA families. Moreover, our first run of TAQ
with a VapC toxin as initial query retrieved some Phd antitoxins (see above).

We also input 303 sequences of putative toxins (139
referred as "toxins" and 164 referred as "unknown")
uncovered by TAQ V1.0 into RASTA-Bacteria [19]. When
RASTA-Bacteria gave more than one possible domain per
sequence, we only considered the domain with the highest score. Strikingly, seven of our putative poisons belong-

domain for 3, 1, 1, 1, and 1 sequences, respectively) by
RASTA-Bacteria. Although these results exhibit low scores,
they might prove to be the first objective link, in terms of
homology, among TA superfamilies. In-vivo experiments,

identifying the nature of the domains by which these proteins exert their putative toxicity, would probably shed
light on this exciting hypothesis (see below).

Conclusion
Figure 5 indicates that among the "in-silico inferred ParE
toxins", i.e., the new putative TA systems (red lineages)
identified by our search algorithm (Fig. 10) are widely distributed into the phylogenetic tree of the ParE family.
Conversely, the new putative TA systems uncovered here

for the MazF, Doc, and VapC families are more restricted
in their phylogenetic localization (Fig. 6, 7 and 9). However, for the MazF family, the new putative TA systems are
particularly ancient (hence, divergent) in the phylogeny
of the family, emphasizing the efficiency of our algorithm
for identifying new TA systems.

All analyses presented here include exclusively sequences
that met all similarity and structural constraints implemented in TAQ V1.0, i.e., the "in-silico inferred toxin"
sequences. However, many additional hits meet the similarity criterion but fail to meet either the size criterion or
the presence of a putative antidote ("bad toxins" or "without-antidote putative toxins" sequences, respectively). It
would be particularly interesting to extend the phyloge-

netic analyses performed here to these additional
sequences, especially for those found in eukaryotic
genomes, to assess their likelihood to represent functional
or degenerated poison genes.

toxic nature, (ii) identify their mode of action, and/or (iii)
possibly confirm their hybrid character (i.e., with the toxic
mode of action from family A, and the antitoxin structure
of family B). Finally, it would be worth investigating
which of the two proteases known to degrade antitoxins

are active against the antitoxins of the tested putative TA
systems.

Methods
Search for TA homologs
Given the small size of and the very large divergence
among TA systems, we assumed that many might not be
annotated as such in the NCBI database. Hence, we developed an algorithm and implemented into a computer
program, TAQ V1.0, for the detection of putative TA systems (Figure 10a). The program starts with an input file
that contains one or more amino-acid poison sequence(s)
in FASTA format. The first sequence in the list is used for
a sequence similarity search against a local copy of the
"nr" public database (non-redundant protein sequence
database; see [34] for additional information). The local
alignment algorithm used is BLASTP V2.2.9 or PSI-BLAST
V2.2.9 (Position-Specific Iterated – BLAST). The latter is a
method that automatically combines statistically-significant alignments produced by BLAST [35] into a positionspecific score matrix; the database is then searched using
this matrix [36,37]. PSI-BLAST was used with an e-value
threshold (E) of 0.1 (i.e., 0.1 expected random hit with the
same score, given the sizes of the query and database) and
4 iterations. All other parameters were set as default.

The next step of the algorithm consists into using structural parameters to check if BLAST hits are likely to belong
to TA systems. To this end, TAQ V1.0 uses the annotated
NCBI file (listing all hits) generated by BLAST to identify,
for each amino-acid sequence hit, the corresponding
genomic region and nucleotide sequence. Sequences are
then filtered according to the following successive criteria
(Figure 10a): (i) the length of the putative toxin (LpT) must
be 60aa <LpT < 150aa, a range encompassing the length
distribution of all known toxin genes plus 40 aa; (ii) an
additional ORF (putative antitoxin) of length 40aa <LpA <
150aa must be found (using the appropriate translation
table and the three phases) in the 410 bp interval downstream of the putative toxin ORF; (iii) the separation or
overlap between the putative antitoxin and putative toxin
ORFs (i.e., between the stop codon of the former and the
start codon of the latter) must be of maximum 30 bp.
Only the sequences meeting all the above conditions are
stored as "in-silico inferred toxins" (and the corresponding
antitoxins are stored in a separate database) for further
analyses. For each run, we assume that all sequences
retained are (i) TA systems (active or inactive), and (ii)
homologous (i.e., share a common ancestor). Every new
"in-silico inferred toxin" sequence is automatically fed as a
query into the TAQ V1.0 software until it converges (i.e.,
until no new sequence is found, Figure 10b). BLAST hits
that do not meet the size criterion are stored in a "bad
toxin" database, whereas BLAST hits that meet the size criterion but cannot be associated to a putative antitoxin are
stored in a "without-antidote putative toxins" database. It is
indeed conceivable that real toxin genes can lose their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/104

activity, hence, their associated antitoxin, during evolution.
In order to produce a single set of homologous sequences,
we performed one TAQ V1.0 search for each family of TA
systems starting with a single poison (the parE toxin from
the E. Coli RK2 plasmid for the relE/parE family, the MazF
toxin from the delivery vector pIEF16S for the mazF/kid/
ccdB family, the Doc toxin from the Enterobacteria phage
P1 for the Doc family, and the VapC toxin from Leptospira
interrogans [serovar Lai str. 56601] for the PIN domain
proteins). Since we did not find any CcdB sequence during the search using the MazF toxin as query (despite that
CcdB and MazF are thought to belong to the same family),
we also run one search using CcdB from the F plasmid as
the starting sequence.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Given the difficulties to analyze sequence matrices including a large number of short and highly divergent
sequences, we used several criteria to separate them into
groups. First, we grouped all sequences found with the
same query. Large groups were sometimes very difficult to
align and were manually separated into sub-groups until
alignment became much less ambiguous. On the contrary, very small groups (< 6 sequences) were manually
combined with a larger group with which they aligned
best. Final alignment among aa sequences within each
group was generated with PROALIGN V0.4 (available at
[38]), a program implementing a method for multiple
sequence alignment that combines an HMM approach, a
progressive alignment algorithm, and a probabilistic evolution model describing the character substitution process
[39]. This method allows the assignment of a posterior
probability to each aligned position at each node of the
guide tree and has been demonstrated to perform particularly well in benchmarks comparing different approaches
[40]. Each alignment was used to produce a maximum
likelihood (ML) phylogeny (see below), and the most
likely ancestral (root) sequence (MLRS) was estimated
using software GASP [41], with mid-point rooting. MLRS
(one per alignment) were then themselves aligned using
PROALIGN and their ML phylogenetic relationships were
inferred (see below). The final tree was built by replacing
MLRS, on the tree among MLRS, by the corresponding initial trees (Figure 11a).

ML phylogeny inference was carried out with the Bayesian
approach [42] implemented in MRBAYES 3.1.2 [43,44]
with the "mixed protein model". The Markov chain Monte
Carlo search was run with 6 chains for 106 millions generations and an initial temperature of 0.1, with trees sampled every 100 generations (the first 2,500 trees were
discarded as "burnin"). Hence, Bayesian posterior proba-

Figure 11 the the "ancestral sequence tree" method used
uncovered by TAQ V1.0
for Schematic of phylogeny among putative toxins sequences
(a) inferring
(a) Schematic of the "ancestral sequence tree" method used
for inferring the phylogeny among putative toxins sequences
uncovered by TAQ V1.0. In this hypothetical example, the
sequences are separated into 4 groups. Black edges represent the ML phylogenies within each of the 4 considered
groups. The red dots stand for the inferred ancestral
sequence of each group. The red edges define the phylogeny
among the inferred ancestral sequences. (b) Schematic of the
second heuristic ("super tree" approach) used for inferring
the phylogeny among putative toxins sequences uncovered
by TAQ V1.0. In this hypothetical example, the sequences
are separated into 3 groups. The red, green, and blue trees
represent the ML phylogenies within each of the 3 considered groups. These source trees are then used collectively
for generating the best super tree, i.e., the tree including all
sequences that is most compatible with all source trees (see
Methods section for details).

bilities were estimated as the majority-rule consensus tree
among the 7,500 last sampled trees.
As an alternative to the above-mentioned approach (performing phylogenetic analysis among MLRS inferred from
sub-groups of sequences), we also applied the supertree
method [45,46]. To this end, we requested our program
TAQ V1.0 to output the query sequence(s) that generated
each hit. Different poison sequences were grouped when
they had been generated by the same query sequence. As

different queries can generate the same hit, the groups are
partially overlapping. As many of these groups are highly
redundant (some group are even fully included into others), we reduced the number of groups using the following rules. First, groups of less than 3 sequences are
discarded. Second, groups are sorted by decreasing size;
groups 2 to N are compared each with group 1 (the largest
group); any group sharing more than 2 sequences with
group 1 are discarded and group 1 is set aside; the procedure is then iterated using the remaining groups. Once the
two last groups have been compared, we checked that all
toxin sequences in the initial list were included in the
union of all groups set aside. Note that for the MazF family, the maximum allowed overlap between groups was
raised from 2 to 3. We then inferred the phylogenetic relationships among sequences (using MRBAYES 3.1.2 with
the "mixed protein model") within each of the N groups,
generating N trees that are partially overlapping in terms
of the included sequence. The overlapping trees were then
used as input for "supertree" inference (Fig. 11b) using
CLANN v 3.0.3d [47]. This program implements 5 different methods of supertree reconstruction, of which only
the "Most Similar Supertree" approach allowed analysis of
the RelE and VapC datasets in practical computing time.
This hill-climbing heuristics consists into generating a
supertree topology Ti (i.e., containing all taxa as leaves) at
iteration i by performing a random branch swapping (following the SPR algorithm, [48]) on the topology Ti-1 generated at iteration i-1. Ti is accepted as a new starting
topology if its score (evaluated under an optimality criterion described below) is better than that of tree Ti-1, otherwise it is rejected and a new branch swapping is
performed on Ti-1. The score of a proposed supertree
topology is evaluated as follows. First a taxa distance
matrix is computed for each of the N source trees: the distance between a pair of taxa is the number of nodes that
separate them in the source tree. Second, each source tree
topology is compared to the proposed supertree topology:
for each comparison, the supertree topology is pruned of
all the taxa that are not present in the source tree and the
supertree distance matrix is computed. Third, the score of
the supertree topology relative to a given source tree is
computed as the absolute difference between the distance
matrix of the latter and that of the corresponding pruned
supertree. Finally, the full score of the proposed supertree
topology is computed as the normalized sum of all scores.
For each major toxin family (ParE, MazF, and Doc) we
performed 10 CLANN (v 3.0.3d) runs and kept all equally
best trees. For the VapC family, we performed 5 runs (each
using a starting trees generated using various heuristics
since CLANN did not manage to build a starting tree from
our set of trees) and kept all equally best trees.
