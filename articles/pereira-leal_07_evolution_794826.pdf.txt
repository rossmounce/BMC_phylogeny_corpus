Background: Cellular functions are accomplished by the concerted actions of functional modules.
The mechanisms driving the emergence and evolution of these modules are still unclear. Here we
investigate the evolutionary origins of protein complexes, modules in physical protein-protein
interaction networks.

Background

ular organization [4-6]. They are organized into a number of
functional modules, which are sets of interacting proteins
accomplishing discrete biological functions in relative spatial,
temporal or chemical isolation from other modules in the network [6]. Protein complexes are functional modules in the
sense that the protein subunits of the complex are sufficient
for its function, even when isolated from the system, as has
been demonstrated by in vitro reconstitution of active protein
complexes in a variety of studies (for example, [7]).

information

The success of genome sequencing projects has resulted in
the accumulation of catalogues of genes for hundreds of
genomes. Within each genome, the genes and their proteins
interact to form complex networks with properties that transcend those of individual genes. One such network is formed
by the totality of physical protein-protein interactions in the
cell: the protein interaction network (PIN). These networks,
like many other naturally occurring networks, such as the
transcriptional [1,2] and metabolic networks [3], have a mod-

interactions

Conclusion: Our study provides the first insight into the evolution of functional modularity in
protein-protein interaction networks, and the origins of a large class of protein complexes.

Results: We studied protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, complexes of known threedimensional structure in the Protein Data Bank and clusters of pairwise protein interactions in the
networks of several organisms. We found that duplication of homomeric interactions, a large class
of protein interactions, frequently results in the formation of complexes of paralogous proteins.
This route is a common mechanism for the evolution of complexes and clusters of protein
interactions. Our conclusions are further confirmed by theoretical modelling of network evolution.
We propose reasons for why this is favourable in terms of structure and function of protein
complexes.

A hypothesis for the origins and evolution of protein complexes
A hypothesis for the origins and evolution of protein complexes. Gene
duplication with conservation of protein interactions is frequent [9]. Selfinteractions (homomeric interactions) have special structural properties
(see text for details) that are conserved into the duplicated interaction
between paralogous proteins (light-dark interaction). Interactions between
paralogous proteins are more versatile functionally and structurally, and
are systematically selected for in evolution. These interactions are central
in the establishment and evolution of clusters in PINs and protein
complexes.

The mechanisms that drive the emergence and subsequent
evolution of modularity in cellular networks are unclear. This
is in part due to the fuzzy nature of the concept and the difficulty in identifying functional modules in cellular networks.
Here, we focus on the evolution of one specific type of functional module, protein complexes, and propose an evolutionary route that accounts for the origin and evolution of a
proportion of these modules. We hypothesize that duplication
of self-interacting proteins (homomers) is critical for the
establishment and evolution of a proportion of protein complexes, and hence of functional modularity in protein interaction networks (Figure 1). Our hypothesis was based on the
following considerations.
First, gene duplication and divergence is the most important
force driving the expansion of eukaryotic proteomes (for
example, [8]). Conservation of protein interactions is frequent after duplication and paralogous genes thus frequently
share interaction partners [9]. Mathematical models of network evolution based on this principle of duplication and
divergence result in networks that display topological properties comparable to those of biological protein interaction networks, in particular high clustering coefficients [10,11].
Clusters in protein networks are frequently part of protein
complexes [4,12,13]. The clustering coefficient of a network
(C) is a measure that quantifies how interconnected the proteins are [14], partly reflecting modularity of the network. So
duplication followed by conservation of protein interactions
is linked with modularity in theoretical simulations of network evolution.
A second piece of evidence is that the oligomerization of multiple, identical subunits is a simple way of forming large, functional structures in a genetically economical manner. Smaller
component subunits will fold more readily than a single large
protein and are less prone to translational errors [15,16]. Mul-

tiple copies of the same protein will tend to be co-localized in
the cell as they can be synthesized from the same mRNA. This
may promote oligomerization, for example, by domain swapping [17] or other mechanisms. Furthermore, evolution of a
homomeric interface by incremental mutation is aided by the
fact that the effect of one advantageous mutation will apply to
all subunits of a homo-oligomer, and is thus, a priori, the
most likely type of interface to occur [18]. In protein interaction networks, homomeric interactions are indeed over-represented [19]. They are also very abundant in complexes of
known three-dimensional structure, present in 85% of all
complexes in the Protein Quaternary Structure (PQS) database (Table 1).
The third consideration is that when genes coding for proteins that form homodimers duplicate, conservation of interactions will generate dimers of paralogous proteins. In these,
the stability associated with the homodimer is maintained,
while at the same time asymmetry is introduced into the
interaction. This asymmetry provides more degrees of evolutionary freedom and represents a source of functional novelty
(discussed in [20]). This is illustrated by the anecdotal examples like the photosystem I (Figure 1), in which there is asymmetry in terms of the subunits bound to PsaA and PsaB, the
two paralogous proteins at its core [21,22].
These considerations suggest the following evolutionary scenario (see Figure 1), which we test in the work presented here.
An initial interaction is established between two (or more)
copies of the same protein (homomeric interactions; Figure 1,
left). This is the stable 'seed' of a new complex, and functional
and structural factors will contribute to this interaction being
selected for conservation. Gene duplication and divergence
with conservation of the interactions will then follow. This
initially results in multiple homomeric and heteromeric complexes with different numbers of the two duplicates (Figure 1,
middle), permitting functional and structural diversification.
Over time, sequence divergence will produce distinct complexes with distinct functionalities. The complexes containing
paralogous proteins will frequently be selected in evolution
due to the advantages of asymmetry, and accretion of new
interactions may follow. This evolutionary process is illustrated by the related complexes of the RecA recombinase
homohexamer and the F1 ATP synthase α3:β3 hexamer (discussed below). These two functionally distinct complexes are
likely to have evolved from a common homomeric ancestor
[23].

Results

We test the evolutionary scenario hypothesized above by
investigating the following corollaries: whether duplication of
genes coding for homodimers is frequently accompanied by
conservation of protein interactions in protein interaction
networks; whether interactions between paralogous proteins
are associated with high clustering in protein interaction

PPIs/Complexes are the number of protein-protein interactions and protein complexes (for complexes) in the data sets, respectively. HD,
homodimers; PD, dimers of paralogous proteins; F(HD) and F(PD) represent the frequency at which the complexes contain homodimers or dimers
of paralogous proteins in any of the two S. cerevisiae protein interaction datasets. These numbers were obtained by computationally superimposing
the PINs onto the complex data and are significantly higher than expected by chance at p < 10-4 in all cases. F(HI) and F(PI) are the frequency of
complexes with homomeric or paralogous interactions, respectively.

It is known from previous work that gene duplication accompanied by conservation of interactions is common in PINs for
both homomers and interactions between non-homologous
proteins [9,19]. We have calculated the frequency of interac-

protein interaction networks studied here (Table 1). We used
structural assignments to detect homology, thus considering
even very distant evolutionary relationships, as described in
Materials and methods. We found that interactions between
paralogues are significantly more frequent than expected by
chance (Figure 2). In order to investigate the evolutionary origins of interactions between paralogues, we determined the
conditional probabilities for a protein that forms a paralogous
dimer to also be a homodimer. The observation that interactions in homodimers and paralogous dimers are not independent (Table 2) supports an evolutionary link between
these two types of dimers, such that paralogous dimers
evolved by duplication of homodimers. These observations
support the corollary that duplication of homomers is frequently accompanied by conservation of interactions.

over-represented in protein complexes of known threedimensional structure; whether these interactions are older
than other interactions and, hence, paralogous dimerization

the establishment of dimers of paralogues is associated with
asymmetry of protein interactions.

probability of a polypeptide forming a homodimer given that it also participates in forming a dimer of paralogues. The standard deviations for each

This is consistent with the result obtained in a previous
theoretical study of network evolution by duplication-divergence [10]. The increases in clustering levels in this simplified
model are modest, suggesting that additional mechanisms
must operate in the evolution of real networks, and that only
a subset of protein complexes are derived by the mechanism
proposed here.

Dimers of paralogues in the protein-protein interaction network. On top
is a cartoon illustrating how paralogous dimers result from the duplication
of proteins that form homodimers. The bar chart shows the fraction of
paralogous dimers (gray bars) in four protein interaction networks
compared with random expectation levels, obtained by 10,000 network
randomizations by shuffling evolutionary relationships (p < 10-4; see
Materials and methods for details).

Duplication of homodimers and network clusters
We next investigated whether the duplication of homodimers
is associated with protein complexes in PINs. We consider the
average clustering coefficient (C) of a network as a descriptor
of the extent of modularity of that network. Clusters frequently correspond to known protein complexes, as shown by
[4,12,13] and by us (Supplementary material S1 in Additional
data file 1; illustrated in Figure 3a). This parameter captures
the frequency of densely connected subgraphs in the network
[14], and allows us to measure modularity in a PIN without
specific knowledge of the identity of the protein complexes.
We show here that PINs are more clustered than randomized
networks with exactly the same broad degree distributions as
the real yeast PIN (Figure 3b), extending previous analysis
where it was shown that protein interaction networks were
more clustered than random Erdõs-Rényi networks and random power-law networks [24]. This provides strong support
for the biological significance of clusters in networks.
We investigated whether duplication plays a role in determining the clustering levels of the network. The duplication and
conservation scenarios in Figure 3c suggest that only duplication of proteins that form homodimers, and not other proteins, will lead to an increase in the clustering coefficient of
the network. To investigate this, we implemented a theoretical model of network growth by duplication-divergence
[11,25,26] and asked whether inclusion of self-interactions in
the model increases the global clustering coefficient.
As shown in Figure 3d, the presence of self-interacting proteins increases the clustering of the network in this model. In
particular, the higher the initial proportion of self-interac-

Conversely, when we consider the four real PINs (Table 1) and
ask the opposite question, whether selective removal of interactions between paralogous proteins reduces the global clustering of the network, we find that this is the case. Clustering
levels are reduced by between 7% and 15% (Supplementary
material S3 in Additional data file 1). This is significantly
more than obtained by removal of other interactions, which
has negligible effects on the global clustering of the network.
These small but significant reductions are consistent with the
modeling results, further supporting that this mechanism
operates in the evolution of a subset of protein complexes.
This result is subject to the following caveats. First, in some
cases the formation of a cluster is not due to a single multiprotein complex, but many alternative ones, which may not
co-exist in time and in space. This has been described in transcription factor families [27,28], and is illustrated in Figure
3a. Secondly, the graph representation we use for PINs is, in
itself, limited; for example, it ignores the stoichiometry of the
different subunits within protein complexes. For example, a
protein complex composed of six identical subunits forming a
ring would be depicted as a single self-interacting node, and
not captured as a cluster in the PIN. Thus, although
considering PINs gives us a network perspective on protein
complexes and also large numbers of interactions and
increased statistical power, we need to consider alternative
definitions of protein complexes to substantiate the above
result. So, we next investigated experimentally derived protein complexes.

Paralogous subunits in protein complexes
We tested the corollary that there is an over-representation of
interactions between paralogous proteins within protein
complexes. We considered two distinct types of protein complex data. The first is composed of three independent data
sets of protein complexes in S. cerevisiae (Table 1) and is discussed in this section; the second is composed of protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure, and will be
considered in the next section.
First, we found that in all three S. cerevisiae datasets, about
one-third of the protein complexes contain duplicated proteins, which is more than expected by chance (Figure 4a). We
then wanted to check whether the duplicates physically contact each other within these complexes. However, the three S.

and some redundancy may exist, deriving from multiple baits
picking up the same complex. For the TAP dataset, the
authors provide a smaller set of predicted complexes based on
bioinformatics methods. We repeated the calculation on this
set of predicted TAP complexes and found that the frequencies at which the complexes contain homodimers (F(HD)) or
dimers of paralogous proteins (F(PD)) are 43% and 34%,
respectively. In all cases we found that this enrichment is
highly significant at p < 10-4.

interactions

cerevisiae protein complex datasets lack information on the
physical interactions, or interfaces, formed between the constituent proteins of a complex, as well as the stoichiometry of
the complexes, that is, how many copies of each protein are
present. Therefore, we computationally overlaid all the protein interactions (Yeast and Yeast-large) onto the protein
complexes and asked whether the paralogous subunits of
complexes physically interact. Of the complexes for which
protein interactions can be superimposed, 27% to 30% have
interacting homologous proteins (Table 1). The TAP and
HMS-PCI datasets are the result of large-scale experiments,

Clusters3in PINs
Clusters in PINs. (a) A small section of a PIN in S. cerevisiae is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to proteins and edges to physical
interactions between pairs of proteins. One definition of a module in this work is a highly connected subgraph, such as that shaded in the figure (left), in
which the central (green) node has a maximum clustering coefficient (C = 1). A clustering coefficient can be calculated for each protein in the network and
measures the number of interactions between neighbors of that protein, divided by the total number of possible interactions between those neighbors. In
this example, the green node and its fully connected neighborhood correspond to the protein complex AP-2 [49]. Fully connected subgraphs can also
represent interactions that are dissociated in time and/or in space. For example, the shaded cluster on the right represents members of the basic helixloop-helix transcriptional regulator family, in which duplication of a homodimeric protein with inheritance of interactions resulted in Max existing as a
homodimer, as well as distinct dimers of paralogous proteins (c-Myc and Mad1) [34,35]. (b) Cumulative frequency distribution of the clustering
coefficients in the Yeast PIN and in randomized networks with exactly the same degree distribution (scale-free random; see the Randomization by link

biology and not of the degree distribution. (c) Cartoon illustrating the consequences of duplication with conservation of interactions for the clustering

Duplication of subunits in protein complexes
Duplication of subunits in protein complexes. (a) Nearly 40% of the
protein complexes have homologous subunits (gray bars). These levels are
higher than expected by chance (white bars). Random expectation levels
are the averages of 10,000 randomized protein complex datasets, where
the complex size distribution is kept constant. While the MIPS dataset is
the result of manual curation (see table 1), both TAP and HMS-PCI are the
result of large-scale experiments, and some redundancy may exist from
multiple baits picking up the same complex. For the TAP dataset, the
authors provide a smaller set of predicted complexes based on
bioinformatics methods. We repeated the calculation on this set of
predicted TAP complexes and found that 47% of the complexes have
duplicated subunits, while 18 ± 2% would be expected at random. The
significance level remains the same for this predicted set of complexes as
for the raw purification data. (b) Percentage of complexes of known
three-dimensional structure that have duplicated subunits, as a function of
complex size. Grey bars are for the complete data set, whereas black bars
are from a dataset that excludes purely homomeric complexes, as these
dominate the dataset (see Table 1) and may distort the results. On
average, between 9% and 30% of the complexes display duplicated
subunits (including and excluding purely homomeric complexes,
respectively). This is not an artifact introduced by the complex size
distribution.

Thus, analysis of the three sets of S. cerevisiae protein complex datasets supports the corollary that interacting paralogues are over-represented amongst protein complexes.

Next we concentrated on the set of protein complexes with
known three- dimensional structure (Table 1) to further test
the corollary that there is an over-representation of interfaces
between paralogues within each protein complex. This dataset, obtained from the PQS database, is an automatically generated subset of the PDB containing solely oligomers [29]. In
PQS, the proportion of complexes with paralogues is comparable to the S. cerevisiae complex datasets, at 30% (Figure
4b). The advantage of studying this dataset is that it can provide stoichiometry and interaction maps for complexes, that
is, we can test directly whether paralogues interact.
Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the frequency
of interactions between paralogues within a protein complex
is higher than would be expected by chance, while that of
homomeric interactions is lower (Figure 5a; see Materials and
methods for an explanation on how the expected values are
calculated). One example is the mitochondrial F1/Fo ATP
synthase complex (Figure 5b), which contains interacting
paralogous subunits [30]. While it could potentially establish
homomeric contacts, no such contacts exist in the complex,
illustrating how homomeric interactions can be under-represented compared to the random scenario. Thus, we have
shown that paralogues not only frequently interact within
protein complexes, but also appear to interact preferentially
compared to homomeric interactions and interactions
between evolutionarily unrelated proteins.
To further investigate this, we repeated the experiment
shown in Figure 5a, but considering only subunits that can
establish homo-interactions as well as interactions between
paralogues. This is equivalent to determining what choice is
made in a situation such as that represented in Figure 5b. We
found that given a choice, in almost all cases a preference for
interactions between paralogues will be made, as shown in
Figure 5c. The reason for this is likely to be that this type of
geometrical arrangement of proteins within complexes
requires the smallest number of different interfaces to be
formed, and so is the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario. In the F1 sub-complex, the three α and three β subunits
alternate within the hexameric ring [30], so that only two different interfaces are formed (α:β and β:α; Figure 5b, left).

Evolutionary cores of protein complexes and
asymmetry
Our hypothesis is that many protein complexes start with
homomeric interactions that duplicate and diversify, and
serve as a seed for the coalescence of further subunits. The
photosystem I shown in Figure 1 illustrates this concept. In
Heliobacteria, the complex contains a homodimer at its core
(PshA2), whereas the eukaryotic complex contains a dimer of
paralogues (PsaA:PsaB). These two paralogous polypeptide
chains are each decorated by different peripheral subunits,
suggesting that in this class of photosystem (Type-I RC), the

Duplicated subunits in complexes interact. (a) Interactions between paralogous subunits (red) are more frequent than expected given the stoichiometry of
subunits within protein complexes. Chains from PQS complexes were binned according to probability of forming a homomeric interaction or interactions
between paralogous or different chains (see Materials and methods). The frequencies at which these chains form homodimers and paralogous dimers
(averaged for each bin) are shown as blue and red bars, respectively. In a random scenario, all the points lie within the range shown in the black lines. (b)
Possible arrangements of two distinct subunits in a hexameric ring like that of the F1 complex. The actual F1 complex is shown on the left. Bars of different
colors correspond to different inter-subunit interfaces. (c) If there are multiple identical and paralogous chains within a protein complex, the chains tend
to be arranged in three-dimensional space so that the paralogous chains rather than identical chains are contacting each other, corresponding to the
scenario shown on the left. Note that when there is a choice, interactions between paralogous proteins are always preferred. This experiment is similar to
that described in (a), but considering only the two types of interaction in the calculations. (d) The role of oligomers of paralogues in generating structural
diversity. n is the number of protein complexes found in PQS that have identical chains (left) or paralogous chains (right), which contact the same (top) or
distinct binding partners (bottom). Hetero-oligomers that contain paralogous dimers are more frequently asymmetrical (10/31) than those containing
homomers (6/210), that is, paralogues tend to bind different partners. The complexes shown illustrate the four possible situations. Top left is the
tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, in which the homomeric α:α dimer (blue) binds one β subunit on each side (yellow) [50], which
represents symmetry in binding partners of homomers. Top right is the photosynthetic reaction centre from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, in which both
paralogous L and M chains (blue and purple) bind to the H and C subunits (shown in yellow) [51], which illustrates symmetry in the binding partners of a
dimer of paralogues. Bottom left is the structure of the Rac1 small GTPase bound to the arfaptin-1 homodimer [52] from Homo sapiens, in which Rac1
binds solely one of the arfaptin chains, but occupies a volume that excludes the possibility of additional Rab molecules binding the other arfaptin chain; this
illustrates the rare cases of asymmetry in the binding partners of homomers. Bottom right is the RNA polymerase from S. cerevisiae [53], in which many
peripheral subunits decorate the central core formed by the dimer of paralogues A:B, which illustrates the creation of asymmetry by the duplication of the
ancestral homodimer [32].

core was established prior to the accretion of further subunits
[21,22]. Another example is RNA polymerase II, which contains at its core a large dimer of homologous subunits, and is
believed to have evolved from an ancestral generic nucleic
acid binding homodimer [31,32].
To investigate whether this is a frequent mechanism of evolution of complexes, we tested the fifth corollary and asked
whether homomeric interactions and interactions between
homologous proteins precede interactions between unrelated
proteins in evolution. Then we tested whether paralogues
within complexes of known three-dimensional structure have
asymmetric interactions.
To answer the first question, we compared PINs in different
organisms and asked whether homomeric interactions and
interactions between paralogues in one organism are likely to
be conserved in the PINs in other organisms, that is, whether
the protein(s) have orthologues that interact. Such pairs of
interactions have been termed interologs in [33]. In Table 3
we show that self-interactions and dimers of paralogues are
three to seven times more likely to be conserved from yeast to
fly and worm than interactions between unrelated proteins.
However, due to the small number of conserved interactions,
these results are not definitive. To gain a larger coverage of
the yeast proteins, we tested whether proteins that establish
interactions with identical and/or with homologous proteins
are older than other proteins. We estimated the likely time of
origin of each gene in S. cerevisiae by phylogenetic profiling
and analyzed both the Yeast and Yeast-large PINs as
described in Materials and methods. Homomeric proteins
and those that interact with paralogues are significantly older
than other proteins, tending to be present in all Eukaryotes
and either in Bacteria or Archaea (Yeast) or all Eukaryota
(Yeast-large). Other proteins tend to be present only in Fungi
and Metazoa, but not in other Eukaryota. The difference in
evolutionary conservation is statistically significant in both
data sets (p = 0.003 for yeast and p < 0.001 for Yeast-large,
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). These two results support the
corollary that the establishment of homomeric interactions
and the duplication to dimers of paralogous chains are early
events in the emergence of a protein complex.

considered the protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure again. We compared the set of complexes that
contain paralogues to the complexes that contain homomeric
interactions and no paralogues. As shown in Figure 5d, we
found that 32% of paralogues have asymmetrical interactions, while only 4% of the homomers do, a significant difference (p < 0.001). Thus, the hypothesis that duplication of
homomers results in new asymmetrical complexes is supported by the data. This may represent part of the selective
advantage for conservation of such duplications.

Discussion

We present here a genome-wide, cross-species analysis of the
origins and evolution of protein complexes. At the beginning,
we hypothesized that duplication of self-interacting proteins
(homomers) is an evolutionary path leading to the establishment and evolution of many complexes. To substantiate this
hypothesis, we tested five corollaries that arise from such an
evolutionary scenario.
The first corollary is that duplication of genes coding for
homodimers is frequently accompanied by conservation of
protein interactions. Conservation of protein interactions
after gene duplication has been shown to be frequent [9,19].
We show here that between 4% and 13% of interactions in
PINs are between paralogous proteins.
Next we tested the association between clustering of the network and interactions between paralogous proteins. Clusters
in protein interaction networks frequently represent protein
complexes. We have shown that removal of interactions
between paralogues causes a small but highly significant
decrease in the global clustering level of the network. This is
consistent with our theoretical modeling results.
We then observed that about 30% of protein complexes from
proteomics experiments contain duplicated subunits. In protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure, a similar proportion of complexes have duplicated subunits, and
more importantly, there is preferential binding of paralogous
subunits. This supports the corollary that interactions
between paralogues are frequent in complexes.

To test whether paralogous proteins break the symmetry of a
complex and allow accretion of different types of subunits, we

Datasets of protein interactions and protein complexes
Binary physical protein-protein interactions for S. cerevisiae
[36,37], Drosophila melanogaster (high confidence interactions) [38] and Caenorhabditis elegans. [39], as well as protein complex datasets for S. cerevisiae [36,40,41] and
complexes of known three-dimensional structure used in this
study [29] are summarized in Table 1.
A non-redundant set of protein complexes of known structure, based on the PQS database as of June 2005, was prepared by considering complexes as graphs where nodes are
the protein subunits (labeled by the domain architecture and
chain identity) and edges are a contact between these subunits: two complexes were considered identical when they had
the same subunits (same domain architectures, that is, identical or homolgous chains) and the same contact topology
between subunits. Details of this procedure can be found in
[42].

information

We used domain architecture as defined in the Superfamily
database [43,44] to identify paralogous proteins in PINs, that
is, those proteins resulting from duplication of the corresponding genes. The SUPERFAMILY database provides protein domain assignments, at the SCOP 'superfamily' level
[45], for the predicted protein sequences in completed
genomes. Domain assignments were generated using a
curated set of profile hidden Markov models. In this work,
two proteins are considered paralogous if they display the
same amino- to carboxy-terminal domain architecture, ignoring gaps and tandem domain repetitions as described in [9].
Domain assignments were based on Superfamily release 1.63
[44].

interactions

We have shown previously that duplication of protein interactions and of entire protein complexes is accompanied by specialization of function [9]. Inspection of the effects of
duplication of homo-interactions suggests a similar outcome.
In other words, the main function is established when the
homomer is first formed, and then duplications will serve to
specialize these functions. For example, in Figure 3a the tran-

Our investigations of protein interactions and protein complexes, as well as theoretical modeling, reveal that many protein complexes evolved by the initial establishment of selfinteractions followed by duplication of these self-interacting
proteins. Our study provides the first insight into the evolution of functional modularity in protein-protein interaction
networks, and the origins of a large class of protein
complexes.

deposited research

Another issue that at this stage is difficult to ascertain is the
nature of the complexes that emerged by the proposed route.
If we assume that both the proteomics data and the crystallographic data represent an enrichment for stable protein complexes, then our proposed evolutionary route appears to be
more prevalent in stable complexes. In fact, most examples
discussed in the text are stable complexes. They also appear
to be complexes that were established very early in evolution,
which is illustrated by the ages of the proteins that establish
homomeric interactions and interactions between duplicates.

Conclusion

reports

Altogether, our data suggest an evolutionary route to the formation and specialization of many extant protein complexes.
On this route, homomers and oligomers of paralogous subunits represent an ancestral core around which further subunits can coalesce in evolution. Sequence divergence of the
paralogous subunits creates the asymmetry that permits the
accretion and diversification of interactions. In addition,
divergence of paralogues may be involved in functional specialization of complexes. The biases inherent in each data
type make it difficult to determine the exact fraction of protein complexes that evolved via the proposed route. A higher
bound is about one-third, estimated by the fraction of
proteomics complexes that display duplicated subunits. A
lower bound is less than one-tenth, estimated by the fraction
of dimers of paralogues in one of the yeast two-hybrid data
sets (Table 1).

sition from homodimer to dimers of paralogous proteins of
the helix-turn-helix transcription factors results in specialization of the function of the complex, that is, distinct but
overlapping specificities in DNA binding [34,35]. Other
examples of functional specialization are in the ATP synthase
and proteosome families, as discussed in Additional data file
1.

reviews

Finally, we showed that amongst three-dimensional structures of complexes, 32% of dimers of paralogues establish
asymmetric interactions with other proteins whereas only 3%
of homodimers show such asymmetry, further substantiating
that the duplication of homomeric interactions helps to create
asymmetry in protein interactions, and allows the coalescence of other subunits in the complex.

Pereira-Leal et al. R51.9

comment

We observed that proteins involved in homomeric interactions and interactions between paralogues were more conserved than other proteins: more than half of yeast proteins
had orthologues in all eukaryotes and either archaea or
bacteria, whereas more than half of the other yeast proteins
had orthologues only in fungi and animals. Homomeric interactions and those between paralogous proteins were also
three to seven times more likely to be conserved, when compared to other interactions. Thus, this supports the corollary
that homomers and oligomers of paralogues represent the
first steps in the evolution of new protein complexes, with
other subunits added later.

In the analysis of protein complexes from PQS we considered
two chains to be identical when strict sequence identity was
found, and accepted gaps at the amino and carboxyl termini
of the sequences. Two chains were considered homologous
when they displayed the same amino- to carboxy-terminal
SCOP superfamily domain architecture, and to be different
when they did not satisfy any of the above criteria. We used a
cut-off of five amino acids with atoms within their van der
Waal's radii plus 0.5 Å for two chains to be considered in contact. The expected frequency for a given chain to form a
homo- or a paralogous contact (Ph and Pp, respectively)
within a complex was calculated by counting the number of
times the given chain made one or more homo- or paralogous
contacts (Nh and Np, respectively) in a set resulting from 500
randomizations of that protein complex. Randomizations
consisted of considering the topology of each complex fixed,
and shuffling the position of each chain within the complex.
The expected frequencies were estimated by Ph = Nh/500 and
Pp = Np/500.

distribution) in the final network, that is δ = 0.9 and α = 0 or
α = 0.1. For more details, see Supplementary information S2
in Additional data file 1.

Phylogenetic profiling
We used Smith-Waterman alignments to identify orthologs of
yeast genes in the genomes of 40 organisms, representing the
three branches of the tree of life, and the major taxonomical
groups within each of the branches. We used the SmithWaterman implementation of the TimeLogic's DeCypher®
accelerated hardware. The significance of each hit is based on
a PSCORE statistic where the p value is a real number
between 0 and 1 describing the probability of a hit being random. The significance is based on the histogram fitting
method and we used a cutoff of p < 0.01. A complete list of the
organisms studied is shown in Additional data file 1 (Supplementary material S5). We considered two proteins to be
orthologous if they were bidirectional best hits. The 'age'
groups we can define based on available genomes are, starting
from the most recent, 'S. cerevisiae specific'; 'Saccharomyceta'; 'Fungi'; 'Fungi/Metazoa'; 'Fungi/Metazoa/Amoebozoa';
'Eukaryota'; 'Eukaryota+Archaea' or 'Eukaryota+Bacteria';
'universal'. The eukaryotic tree used as reference is that in
[47].

Randomization by domain architecture shuffling
To test for statistical significance of the measured parameters, we performed 10,000 network randomizations, in which
the topology of the network was kept constant, and the evolutionary relationships between proteins, that is, their Superfamily domain assignments, were shuffled.

To measure the influence of local organization of network
structure, link shuffling was used [46]. Repeated swapping of
interaction partners among pairs of interacting proteins preserves the degree of each individual node in the network but
destroys higher order topological correlations and structures
such as clustering.

Modeling of the growth of the network by gene
duplication
We implemented a theoretical model of network evolution
based on the concepts proposed in [11,25,26]. In this model
we started with x = 340 proteins, representing the total
number of 241 protein families and 29% of unassigned proteins in the Yeast dataset. We randomly introduced an interaction between any pair of proteins with a probability 0.0059
= 2/339, leading to a classic random graph with a Poissonian
degree distribution and an average degree of two. The network is then allowed to grow until it reaches the same size as
the Yeast network (neglecting isolated nodes generated during the simulation). The parameter δ for the probability to
delete a link under duplication and α for random re-linking of
a new node to older nodes in the network was chosen with the
aim of obtaining realistic network features (that is, degree
