Abstract
Background: Multi-drug-resistant, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
Enterobacteriaceae, constitute an emerging public-health concern. Little data on the molecular
epidemiology of ESBL producing Escherichia coli is available in Germany. Here we describe the
prevalence and molecular epidemiology of ESBL producing-Escherichia coli isolates at a German
University hospital.
Methods: We analysed 63 non-duplicate clinical ESBL isolates obtained over an 8-month period
using PCR and sequence-based ESBL allele typing, plasmid replicon typing, phylogenetic group
typing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) based genotyping and plasmid profiling was
performed, as well as confirmatory DNA-based hybridization assays.
Results: Examination of the 63 Escherichia coli isolates revealed an almost equal distribution among
the E. coli phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D. High prevalence (36/63) of the CTX-M-15 gene
was observed and an analysis of PFGE-based patterns revealed the presence of this CTX-M allele
in multiple clones. Resistance to cefotaxime was a transferable trait and a commonly occurring
145.5 kb conjugative IncFI plasmid was detected in 65% of E. coli carrying the CTX-M-15 allele. The
rate of transferable antibiotic resistances for GM, SXT, TET, GM-SXT-TET, SXT-TET and GM-TET
was 33%, 61%, 61%, 27%, 44% and 11%, respectively. The remaining strains did not have a common
IncFI plasmid but harboured transferable IncFI plasmids with sizes that ranged from 97 to 242.5 kb.
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate the presence of IncFI plasmids within the prevailing E. coli
population in a hospital setting and suggest that the dissemination of CTX-M-15 allele is associated
to lateral transfer of these well-adapted, conjugative IncFI plasmids among various E. coli genotypes.

Background

Emergence of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics was
described even before the first β-lactam penicillin was developed. The first β-lactamase was identified in E. coli prior to

the use of penicillin in medical practice [1]. In 1983, a Klebsiella ozaenae isolate from Germany was found to secrete a
SHV-2 β-lactamase which efficiently hydrolyzed cefotaxime
and to a lesser extent ceftazidime [2]. Many ESBL-producing

enterobacterial isolates express enzyme variants that are
derived from TEM-1 and SHV-1 by mutations. Recently, different types of ESBL such as CTX-M have been detected.
These enzymes hydrolyze cefepime with high efficiency and
cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime [3]. In clinical
strains, CTX-M-encoding genes have commonly been
located on plasmids which vary in size from 7 – 200 kb [35]. A number of studies have established that most of these
plasmids have either replicons that belong to the incompatibility group (Inc) FII, or multireplicons of Inc FII associated
with Inc FIA and FIB [4-8]. The presence of an Inc FI plasmid
replicon harbouring CTX-M-15 was reported in a single isolate from Turkey [8]. Associations with plasmids of other Inc
groups such as Inc I1 and Inc N have also been reported [7].
Many of these plasmids are conjugative and have transfer frequencies ranging from 10-2–10-7. Additionally, they also
encode multiple resistance genes for different antibiotics as
described for various Inc FII plasmids isolated in UK and
Canada [9]. To date, more than 60 different CTX-M ESBLs
belonging to 5 evolutionary groups have been described. In
most clinical isolates CTX-M-15 is the most frequent CTX-M
type, and has been reported in Enterobacteriaceae isolates
from Poland, Canada, France, UK, Russia, Cameroon, India,
Bulgaria and Japan [3-5]. In Germany isolates harbouring
CTX-M-1, -3, -9 have previously been described [3].
In the present study, we prospectively examined E. coli
ESBL-producing isolates at a German University Hospital
with respect to their phylogenetic type, PFGE pattern,
plasmid incompatibility groups and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles in order to shed light into the epidemiology of these isolates in our clinical setting. We report
here on the emergence of a cluster of CTX-M-15 producers
in Germany exclusively associated with a large conjugative
IncFI replicon-type plasmid.

Methods
Isolates and susceptibility testing
A total of 63 non-duplicate ESBL-positive E. coli were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from different
wards of the local university hospital. These isolates were
obtained from urine, wound swabs, blood, sputum and
aspirates. Polymicrobial infections with Enterobacteriaceae harbouring the same ESBL-type were detected in
three cases of urinary tract infections (UTI): the first two
cases involved E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli
and Enterobacter gergoviae in urine samples, while the third
case involved K. pneumoniae in the urine sample and E. coli
in blood culture of the same patient. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of the University of Giessen and Marburg University Hospital and was
deemed exempt from informed consent.

The specimens were collected over a period of 8 months
from August 2006 to April 2007. Pure cultures of clinical
isolates were identified based on biochemical test systems

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/97

(API 20E, BioMerieux, France) following the instructions
of the vendor. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined
using the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar
(Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) as recommended by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) [10].
Susceptibility was tested against ampicillin (10 μg), amoxycillin/clavunate (20/10 μg), ampicillin/sulbactam (10/
10 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), tobramycin (10 μg), SXT (1.25/23.75 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg),
moxifloxacin (5 μg), cefpodoxim (10 μg), ceftazidime (30
μg), cefepime (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg) and meropenem (10 μg) (BD BBL, Franklin Lakes, USA). Escherichia
coli ATCC 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603
were used as reference strains.
All isolates resistant to multiple cephalosporins were confirmed for ESBL production using the double disk synergy
method (disk approximation method) [10]. The MIC for
cefepime and tigecycline in all isolates producing CTX-M
alleles was determined using E-tests ranging from 0.016 to
256 μg/ml (AB Biodisk, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the recommendations of the
CLSI. Quality of media, antibiotic disks and E-test strips
were controlled with the E. coli ATCC 25922 isolate. Isolates with a MIC of ≥ 8 μg/ml for cefepime and a MIC of ≥
2 μg/ml for tigecycline were considered resistant according to the CLSI [10,11].
Amplification of ESBL genes and the ISEcp1 element
The presences of genes encoding ESBL (CTX-M, TEM and
SHV) were investigated using specific primers and methods described previously [12,13]. Using the published
sequence of a 92 kb plasmid carrying CTX-M-15 GenBank
accession NO AY044436 (9), primers tnpA/ISEcp1 F (5'GCAGGTGATCACAACC-3'), tnpA/ISEcp1 R (5'-GCGCATACAGCGGCACACTTCCTAAC-3') and CTX-tnpA F (5'CATGCTCACGGCGGG-3'), CTX-tnpA R (5'-GCTAGGTGATCACAACC-3') were designed to amplify the ISEcp1
(1881 bp) and CTX-M-15 gene plus ISEcp1 elements
(3181 bp) in CTX-M-15-carrying E. coli and transconjugants [8]. For amplification, 5 μl of template DNA (50 ng/
μl) was added to a 45 μl mixture containing 200 μM of
dNTP mixtures (Roche, Switzerland) 0.4 μM of each
primer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Germany) and
appropriate buffer (0.2 μM MgCl2, 2.5 μM KCL, 0.5 μl
10% Tween 20, 1 μl of Gelatin and 3.8 μl of pure water).
The reaction was performed in a Gene Amp PCR system
9700 thermo cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) under the
following conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5
minutes followed by 35 amplification cycles comprising
of 30 seconds denaturation at 94°C, 30 seconds annealing at 62°C, 60 seconds extension at 72°C, followed by a
final extension step at 72°C for 7 minutes. All PCR products were sequenced and a previously characterized E. coli
J53-pMG 267 harboring blaCTX-M genes associated with
ISEcp1 was included as a positive control.

Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and phylogenetic
group typing
PFGE was performed according to the Pulse Net protocol
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta,
USA
http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/proto
cols.htm. The agarose-embedded DNA was digested with
the restriction endonuclease XbaI (New England Biolabs,
USA) at 37°C for 16 hrs. Electrophoresis was conducted
using a CHEF Drive II (Bio-Rad, UK); conditions were 6 V,
with 2.2 s–54 s pulses for 20 hrs. Strain differentiation by
PFGE analysis was achieved by comparison of band patterns using Gelcompar II (Applied Maths, Belgium). Patterns were normalized using the molecular weight marker
(PFGE Lambda Marker, Fermentas, Germany). Dendograms were generated to visualize relationships among the
isolates. The similarity coefficient (SAB) of sample pairs
was calculated based on band positions by using DICE
metric [14,15]. A similarity coefficient SAB of 0.80 was set
as a threshold for defining clusters of genetically similar
isolates.

Escherichia coli phylogenetic grouping was achieved using
triplex PCR for chuA, yjaA and tspE4C2 genes as described
previously. Amplification of these genes was performed
with the following primers chuA.1 (5'-GACGAACCAACGGTCAGGAT-3') and chuA.2 (5'-TGCCGCCAGTACCAAAGACA-3'), yjaA.1 (5'-TGAAGTGTCAGGAGACGCTG-3')
and yjaA.2 (5'-ATGGAGAATGCGTTCCTCAAC-3'), and
tspE4C2.1 (5'-GAGTAATGTCGGGGCATTCA-3') and
tspE4C2.2 (5'-CGCGCCAACAAAGTATTACG-3') [5,16].
Plasmid analysis, DNA hybridization and PCR-based
replicon typing (PBRT)
Plasmids from transconjugants and clinical isolates were
detected using PFGE as described previously [4,5,17].
Genomic DNA was prepared as described above. A single
block was incubated at 55°C for 45 minutes with 1 unit
of S1 nuclease (Invitrogen, Germany) in 200 μl of 50 mM
NaCl, 30 mM sodium acetate and 5 mM ZnSO4. Electrophoresis was done under the following conditions 6 V, 5
s–50 s for 20 h. DNA fragments were transferred to the
polyvinyl-based membrane using overnight capillary
transfer followed by hybridization with digoxygenin
(DIG)-labeled CTX-M-15 FIA, and FIB amplicon probes
prepared according to the manufacturers instruction (DIG
High Prime DNA labelling and Detection Starter Kit II,
Roche, Germany) [5].

PCR-based replicon typing was carried out as described by
Carattoli et al [5,7]. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy
tissue extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and 5 μl of template DNA (50 ng/μl) was used in simplex PCR to detect
FIA, FIB, FII, I1 and N groups. PCR conditions were: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes followed by 30 amplification cycles comprising of 30 seconds denaturation at
94°C, 30 seconds annealing at 58°C, 60 seconds exten-

sion at 72°C, followed by a final extension step at 72°C
for 5 minutes. Escherichia coli strains ATCC 25922 and R
100 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.
Sequencing
PCR products of all ESBL genes detected as well as 6 randomly selected FIA- and FIB-amplicons were sequenced.
PCR products were purified using Invitek purification kit
(Invitek, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence reactions were done using the corresponding primers used for amplification, and sequencing
was performed using the automated sequencer ABI Prism
3100 (Applied Biosystems, USA). DNA sequence was analysed using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, USA) followed by homology searches using the NCBI BLAST
algorithm (Altschul SF et al. 1997).
Transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes
Conjugation experiments were performed using E. coli
CC118 (Rifr, Strr, Lac-, plasmid-free) as a recipient strain
[18] and 18 randomly selected clinical isolates of E. coli,
representing different PFGE-based clusters as donor
strains. Strains were mixed at the ratio of 1:2 (donor/
recipient) on LB agar followed by overnight incubation at
37°C. Transconjugants were selected by suspending the
growth in 1 ml of PBS and 0.1 ml portions of 10-1 to 10-4
dilutions were plated on LB agar containing 300 μg/ml
rifampicin and 30 μg/ml cefotaxime. The transconjugants
were tested for ESBL production using disk approximation
method followed by PCR amplification of ESBL genes and
replicon typing.

Results
Isolates and types of ESBL genes
A total of 63 non-duplicate clinically relevant isolates of E.
coli were confirmed as ESBL-producing strains using the
double disk assay. Thirty five of these isolates were recovered from urine (55.5%), 6 from blood culture (9.5%), 5
from sputum (7.9%) and 17 were from swabs (wound,
eye, cervix, 27%). Twenty-nine of the isolates originated
from general medical wards (46%) and 7 were from intensive care units (11.1%). Among the 63 phenotypically
confirmed ESBLs, 61 (96.8%) were positive in PCR amplification using primers specific for the detection of TEM
and CTX-M genes. CTX-M occurred at the highest frequency and was found in 49 (77.7%) isolates. CTX-M-15
was the most common allele detected and was found in
36 (57.1%) of all E. coli tested. Other detected ESBL alleles
were CTX-M-3 (4.7%), CTX-M-1 (11.1%), CTX-M-28
(3.1%), Tem-144 (7.9%), Tem-126 (3.1%), Tem-105
(3.1%), Tem-150 (1.6%) and Tem-143 (3.1%), '[see
Additional file 1]'. CTX-M-15 was detected in all cases of
polymicrobial infections. Twenty randomly selected CTXM-15-carrying E. coli isolates were positive for the 1.8 kb
ISEcp1 element using designed primers. The nucleotide

sequences of several CTX-M 15 alleles were published at
GenBank under the accession numbers EU118591 to
EU118602.
Antibiotic resistance profiles
All isolates were sensitive to imipenem/cilastin and meropenem. Additionally, we tested for tigecycline and
obtained MICs ranging from 0.5 μg/ml to 1 μg/ml with a
median of 0.75 μg/ml indicating that all isolates were sensitive to tigecycline. All isolates carrying the CTX-M-15
allele were resistant to cefepime (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml). The
majority of isolates carrying CTX-M-15 were resistant to
gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), tetracycline and ciprofloxacin when compared to other alleles
(p = 0.006, chi-square test). There was a significant association (p = 0.00067, Fisher exact test) between resistance to
cefepime and the presence of the CTX-M-15 allele, when
compared to other CTX-M alleles data not shown.
Conjugation
The 18 randomly selected CTX-M-15-carrying E. coli isolates were all capable of transferring plasmids by conjugation with transfer frequencies ranging from 10-4 – 10-9 per
donor cell. Genes for tetracycline and SXT resistance were
co-transferable in 61% and gentamicin in 33% of isolates.
No transferable ciprofloxacin resistance was observed
(Table 1).
Characterization of isolates using PFGE and phylogenetic
grouping
All of the 63 E. coli isolates were subjected to PFGE analysis. Examination of the PFGE patterns revealed 13 PFGE

types (Figure 1). Using a similarity level SAB of 0.80 (line
X in Figure 1), the 63 strains could be assigned to 6 clusters (clusters 1–6 in Figure 1) indicating the overall close
relationship of the isolates. PCR-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that 28 (44.4%) of all isolates belonged to
the B2 phylogenetic group, 20 were classified as group A
(31.7%), 10 (15.8%) as D and 5 (7.9%) as B1. CTX-M-15
was found in 61% of group B1 isolates, in 50% of group
D isolates, and in 60% of group A and B2, respectively.
Thirteen (65%) of the group A isolates were obtained
from urine samples. Phylogenetic group B2 formed the
majority of the PFGE clusters 2 (15/21), 3 (3/4) and 5 (5/
7) (Figure 1).
Plasmid analysis and replicon typing
Plasmids of variable sizes were detected, and the majority
of transconjugants had plasmids ranging from 145.5 kb to
194 kb (Figure 2). A 145.5 kb plasmid was detected in
65% of the isolates tested and when present it was always
found to hybridize with CTX-M-15, FIA as well as FIB
probes, '[see Additional file 2]'. In one isolate the CTX-Mgene was located on a 242.5 kb IncF1 plasmid. All clinical
isolates and transconjugants were found to harbour IncFI
group plasmids. The majority of isolates (71.4%) were
positive for both FIA and FIB. FIA and FIB alone were
found in 10 (15.8%) and 8 (12.7%) isolates respectively.
Plasmids harbouring Inc FII, IncN and IncI1 replicon
types were not detected.

Discussion
This study provides molecular-epidemiological data on
ESBL-carrying Escherichia coli in the clinical setting of a

University Hospital in Germany. The study demonstrates
that CTX-M ESBLs are the most common ESBL types
among E. coli ESBL producers in our setting. The predominance of CTX-M-15 indicates that this allele might now
be as common in Germany as in other European countries
(such as UK, Poland, Greece, France, etc.) [3-5,12].
CTX-M-15 ESBL producing isolates displayed a significantly
(p = 0.0064) higher level of resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(SXT) as compared to other ESBL alleles. Other studies have
also reported co-resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycosides,
fluoroquinolones
in
ESBL-producing
organisms
[9,12,18,19]. In this study gentamicin, tetracycline and SXT
resistance were transferable by conjugation in more than
30% of isolates tested. Isolates harbouring CTX-M-15 were
resistant to cefepime with most of them exhibiting a MIC of
greater than 32 μg/ml which is significantly higher than that
reported for other CTX-alleles (p = 0.00067). It has been
demonstrated that CTX-M ESBLs hydrolyze cefepime with
higher efficiency compared to other ESBL types [13]; this
finding was confirmed in our study. Our data furthermore
suggests that among the CTX-M-alleles, CTX-M-15 confers a
higher ability to hydrolyze cefepime as compared to other
CTX-M-types. In addition to carbapenems, all our ESBL isolates habouring CTX-M types were found to be sensitive to
tigecycline with a MIC ≤ 2 μg/ml. This suggests that tigecycline could be a therapeutic alternative to carbapenems in
cases of systemic infection due to ESBL producing organisms
[11,20].

All phylogenetic groups of E. coli were observed in our
study with group B2 representing the majority of our isolates [21]. Twenty isolates in our study were classified as
phylogenetic group A. Among these 13 (65%) were from
urine samples and 60% of them carried the CTX-M-15
allele. Bacteria from the phylogenetic group A are considered as commensals, but they have occasionally been
associated with serious nosocomial infections. In this
study, one group A CTX-M-15 positive isolate was recovered from a blood culture. In contrast to data reported in
other studies, we cannot detect a significant bias in the
distribution of CTX-M-15 among the different phylogenetic groups [22].
Analyses of PFGE banding patterns indicate a total of 55
genotypes among the isolates collected (Figure 1), suggesting that the spread of ESBLs is most probably linked
to mobile genetic elements. Using a similarity coefficient
(SAB) of 0.80, we were able to establish 6 different clusters (1–6) in our isolates. Cluster 2 was the largest cluster
and was mainly formed by the B2 phylogenetic group
with 67% of the isolates harbouring the CTX-M-15
allele. All isolates were typed for plasmid incompatibility groups and could be classified as FIA- and FIB-replicon types. Unlike most previously published studies
[4,5,8], where an association of FII together with FIA
and/or FIB was observed, no FII-replicon type could be
detected in our isolates. To date there is only a single
report from Turkey in which CTX-M-15 of an E. coli isolate was associated with an IncFI plasmid [8]. Plasmid
analysis revealed that the majority of our transconjugants harboured large plasmids ranging from 145.5 to
194 kb. In 65% of the tested ESBL isolates, a common
IncFI plasmid of about 145.5 kb could be demonstrated.
One isolate carried a 242.5 kb IncFI plasmid harbouring
CTX-M-15, which is the largest IncFI plasmid described
in Escherichia coli to be associated with CTX-M-15. Most
previous studies have found plasmids ranging from 7 to
200 kb in association with CTX-M-15 [3-5]. These findings suggest that in our setting, the CTX-M-15 allele is
carried on large conjugative plasmids which are welladapted and constantly exchanged by lateral gene transfer among the E. coli isolates. The detection of other
Enterobacteriaceae with the same ESBL type, as demonstrated in the above-mentioned cases of polymicrobial
infections, furthermore suggest a species-overlapping
transfer of CTX-M-15 (data not shown). Indeed all E. coli
tested were able to transfer antibiotic resistance by conjugation with a frequency ranging from 10-4 to 10-9 per
donor cell, indicating in several cases an at least 100-fold
higher frequency compared to previous reports from the
UK [18]. In addition CTX-M ESBL genes are often associated with an ISEcp1 element which facilitates its transfer.
In this study the ISEcpl element was found in all isolates
tested.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the predominant presence of
CTX-M-15 ESBL producing E. coli, commonly associated
with a 145.5 kb IncFI plasmid, in our setting. This is the
first report of a CTX-M-15 occurrence in Germany associated with large conjugative plasmids with exclusive IncFI
replicon-type. This study furthermore illustrates that the
prevalence of CTX-M-15 is not due to spread of a single
clonal type but is associated with the spread of related E.
coli isolates. Dissemination of the ESBL phenotype is
linked to the lateral transfer of highly adapted IncF1 conjugative plasmid. Based on these findings, larger multicenter studies to determine the molecular epidemiology
of E. coli ESBL isolates, the distribution of CTX-M ESBL as
well as the presence of conjugative plasmids among
Enterobacteriaceae in hospital populations are warranted.
