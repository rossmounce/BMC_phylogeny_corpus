Abstract
Background: The seacoasts of the Japanese Arc are fringed by many gravel beaches owing to
active tectonic uplift and intense denudation caused by heavy rainfall. These gravel beaches are
inhabited by gobies of the genus Luciogobius that burrow into the gravel sediment and live
interstitially. Although their habitat and morphology (e. g., reduced fins, elongated, scale-less body,
and highly segmented vertebral column) are highly unusual among fishes, little is known on how
their morphological evolution has facilitated the colonization of interstitial habitats and promoted
extensive diversification. We conducted thorough sampling of Luciogobius and related species
throughout Japan, and performed molecular phylogenetic analysis to explore the patterns of
morphological evolution associated with gravel beach colonization.
Results: An analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggested a remarkable diversity of
previously unrecognized species. The species-level phylogeny based on six protein-coding nuclear
genes clearly indicated that interstitial species cluster into two distinct clades, and that transitions
from benthic or demersal habits to interstitial habits are strongly correlated with an increase in
vertebral number. Colonization of gravel beach habitats is estimated to have occurred ca. 10 Ma,
which coincides with the period of active orogenesis of the Japanese landmass. Different species of
interstitial Luciogobius inhabit sediments with different granulometric properties, suggesting that
microhabitat partitioning has been an important mechanism facilitating speciation in these fishes.
Conclusion: This is the first study to document the adaptation to interstitial habitats by a
vertebrate. Body elongation and excessive vertebral segmentation had been the key aspects
enhancing body flexibility and fishes' ability to burrow into the gravel sediment. The rich diversity
of coastal gravel habitats of the Japanese Arc has likely promoted the adaptive radiation of these
unique gravel-dwelling fishes.

Background
Fishes have undergone remarkable adaptations to utilize
various coastal environments, including sandy beaches,
mud flats, rocky shores, coral reefs, and mangroves [1].
Another, less exploited, coastal habitat is gravel beaches,
where the shore sediment consists mainly of gravels [2-4].
Gravel beaches harbor diverse interstitial invertebrates
[5], but the perpetual stirring of gravel by the waves usually make them unsuitable as habitat for vertebrates.
However, gobies of the East Asian genus Luciogobius have
elongated, flexible bodies and are adapted to inhabit the
dynamic sediment of gravel beaches (Figure 1) [6-11]. The
genus is characterized by the loss of the first dorsal fin, an
elongated, scale-less body, and a drastic increase in the
number of vertebrae [12,13], which are putative morphological adaptations to the interstitial lifestyle. So far, 11
Luciogobius species have been described from the Japanese
Arc, Taiwan, Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and the south-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/145

ernmost seacoasts of the Russian Far East and Korean
Peninsula (Figure 2). Seven of these species are endemic
to Japan [13-15]. Five of the 11 species are strongly associated with well-sorted gravel beach sediment and are
strictly interstitial [11,16-19] (Table 1); they reside within
the gravel throughout their life after a pelagic larval stage
and prey on interstitial invertebrates [16-19].
Among East Asian seacoasts, those surrounding the Japanese Arc are particularly rich in gravel beaches [4]. This is
because the Japanese Arc is located on compressional
plate margins and has experienced active orogenesis since
the Middle Miocene (ca. 15 Ma) [20-22]. The resultant
steep mountain ranges and abundant rainfall produced
gravely riverbeds and gave rise to many gravel beaches
along the seacoasts of Japan. Consequently, the diversity
and endemicity of Luciogobius gobies may have been
shaped by the richness of gravel beach habitats along the

coastline of the Japanese Arc. However, the actual diversity and patterns of morphological evolution associated
with the interstitial habits of the genus remain largely
unexplored. Examination of the evolutionary history of
these unique gobies could produce a model for understanding the processes and mechanisms of adaptation by
vertebrates to dynamic interstitial habitats.
In this study, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic
analysis based on extensive sampling of Luciogobius gobies
and allied genera from the seacoasts of Japan (Figure 2),
to clarify their diversity and the evolutionary history of
their interstitial habits. We focused on the correlated evo-

lution of interstitial habits and vertebra number, because,
despite being among the smallest gobies, Luciogobius species have vertebra numbers (i. e., 35–50) that far exceed
those typically found in other Gobiidae (i. e., 26) [12].
The elongated body and highly segmented vertebral column likely enhance flexibility and increase the fishes'
ability to burrow into the gravel sediment. The obtained
phylogenetic tree was then used to estimate the timing of
the evolution of interstitial habitat use, which is interpreted in light of the geological history of the Japanese
Arc. We also compared the granulometric properties of
gravels inhabited by different species of interstitial Luciogobius to determine if there is niche partitioning among

species, which may have contributed to the evolution and
maintenance of the present diversity of Luciogobius.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
To determine whether Luciogobius species contain any previously unrecognized taxa, we first sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene for all sampled
gobies (190 individuals). Phylogenetic analysis of the Cyt
b data suggested that six of the seven sampled Luciogobius
species each contain genetically divergent clades that are
separated by 5–12% uncorrected pairwise sequence difference (Figure 3). Luciogobius elongatus had the highest
number of clades (six), while L. guttatus was separated
into three clades, and the others were each grouped into
two clades. The divergent clades within each species
formed a monophyletic group, except for L. guttatus,
which was not recovered as monophyletic in the Cyt b tree
(but see results of the combined nuclear analysis).
Although most of the intraspecific clades did not overlap
in their distributions, those within L. guttatus, L. elongatus,
and L. grandis co-occurred in some locations (Figure 3),
suggesting that the observed genetic differentiation is not
simply due to geographic isolation. While detailed morphological examinations are currently underway, at least
some pairs of genetically differentiated clades have distinct morphological differences; the six clades within L.
elongatus can be distinguished from each other by vertebra
number and the morphology of the pelvic fin (Figure 4).
Therefore, we treat each of the well-defined clades as distinct species in the following analyses (see Discussion for
further arguments on species status). In addition to the
above previously unrecognized taxa, gobies that could not
be assigned morphologically to presently described species were grouped into three well-supported clades (L. sp.
and Gen. sp. 1 and 2 in Figure 3).

Because the Cyt b gene evolves too rapidly and is therefore
not sufficiently informative for examining species-level
relationships, we also sequenced six protein-coding
nuclear genes to recover phylogenetic relationships
among Luciogobius species and related gobies. One representative individual was chosen from each species arbitrarily, including the Luciogobius taxa genetically revealed
by the Cyt b data, and sequenced for the following six
genes: recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (Rag1 and
Rag2); myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukaemia
(Mll); protease III (Ptr); ryanodine receptor 3 (Ryr3); and
myosin, heavy chain 6, cardiac muscle, alpha (Myh6).
Phylogenetic analysis based on the combined nuclear
gene dataset produced a well-resolved phylogeny with
high nodal support values (Figure 4 and Additional file
1). The genus Luciogobius is monophyletic and does not
include I. koma and I. saikaiensis, which are treated as species of Luciogobius in most recent classifications [13]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/145

interstitial species (Table 1) separated into two distinct
clades within Luciogobius. The three genetically divergent
clades within L. guttatus, which were not recovered as
monophyletic in the Cyt b tree, grouped into a single, wellsupported clade.
Evolution of vertebra number
The vertebra numbers of Luciogobius species are among the
highest of all gobies known [12]. The increase in the
number of vertebrae likely enhances body flexibility, and
the transition to interstitial habitats may be associated
with increases in vertebra number. To test this hypothesis,
we counted the number of vertebrae for each taxa identified from the Cyt b phylogeny (Additional file 2). The
number of vertebrae varied little within species, but
greatly across the sampled goby species, ranging from 30
in Astrabe flavimaculata to 50 in L. adapel. Using the above
species-level phylogeny, we reconstructed ancestral character states of vertebra number (Figure 4), which shows
that clades of interstitial species have markedly higher
numbers of vertebrae. Regression using independent contrasts [23] indicated that the probability of transition to
interstitial habitats is strongly correlated with an increase
in vertebra number (r = 0.605, P = 0.00064).
Estimation of divergence time
To determine the timing of the origin of interstitial habit
in Luciogobius, we estimated divergence times based on the
combined nuclear gene phylogeny. Fossil data are commonly used to calibrate divergence times, but fossils
belonging to the gobiid group under study are not currently available. Instead, we calibrated the tree using (1)
the split between Gymnogobius isaza and G. urotaenia,
which was previously estimated at 2.3 Ma based on geological calibration [24] and (2) the divergence rate of the
Cyt b gene (approximately 2.7% per My in gobiid taxa
[24]). Since a likelihood ratio test rejected a strict molecular clock for the combined nuclear gene dataset (P <
0.001), we employed the penalized-likelihood relaxed
clock approach using the program r8s [25].

Because a reliable maximum prior for the age of the root
node is unavailable, we first obtained relative node ages
by fixing the age of the root node at one arbitrary time
unit without any internal constraints. The obtained ultrametric tree was then calibrated by fixing the G. isaza-G.
urotaenia split at 2.3 Ma, which suggested that the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA) of interstitial Luciogobius species dates back to 7.67 Ma (95% credibility interval, 5.52–12.27 Ma) (Figure 4). We also estimated ages of
all the internal nodes individually based on average pairwise ML distances across each node and the 2.7% Cyt b
divergence rate. These estimates were then individually
used as calibration points to infer the age of the MRCA of
interstitial Luciogobius on the above ultrametric tree.

Results of this analysis converged on a similar range of
estimates for the age of interstitial Luciogobius, as nodes
used to calibrate the tree became deeper on the phylogeny
(Additional file 3). Although older estimates were
obtained when calibrated with recent nodes, these outlying values are likely due to stochastic error associated with
using shallowly placed nodes for deep extrapolations
[26,27].
In addition to these analyses, we also estimated divergence times by obtaining the age of the root node with an
iterative approach [28]. This was done by adjusting the
age of the root node until average rate of Cyt b substitution
(calculated using r8s) equalled the previously inferred rate
of 0.0135, which is half the 2.7% divergence rate [24].
This method resulted in estimates of 27.7 Ma for the root
node (Additional file 4) and 8.11 Ma (95% credibility
interval, 6.89–9.58 Ma) for the MRCA of the interstitial
Luciogobius, which is comparable to the values obtained
using the above two approaches.
Habitat assessment
To determine whether different species of interstitial Luciogobius prefer habitats with different gravel sizes, we quantified the median gravel size and sorting index of the
sediment [29]; these are granulometric measures used to
describe the properties of sediments. The sorting index
describes how well the gravels are sorted by size and
ranges between 0 and 1, with better-sorted gravels having

lower sorting indices. Using the median diameter and
sorting index as descriptors of gravels, the five interstitial
Luciogobius species analyzed were largely grouped into
three habitat types (Figure 5 and Additional file 5): L.
grandis inhabiting relatively large, less sorted gravel sediments, L. platycephalus inhabiting intermediate-sized
gravel sediments, and L. elongatus, L. adapel, and L. sp.
inhabiting small, well-sorted gravel sediments. There were
significant differences among L. grandis, L. platycephalus,
and L. elongatus in both median gravel size (ANOVA, F2,17
= 13.36, P < 0.001) and sorting index (F2,17 = 9.59, P =
0.002), suggesting that they utilize gravel habitats with
broadly different granulometric properties. Data on L.
adapel and L. sp. were not included in the test due to insufficient sample sizes.
Although the six species within the L. elongatus group (sp.
A-F) inhabited sediments with similar granulometric
parameters, their microhabitats differed from one another
with respect to other aspects of the beach. Species A inhabited intertidal gravel banks on turbulent coasts, whereas
sp. B was found in the intertidal sediments of lava gravel
on rocky shores, sp. C in intertidal gravel sediments on
bedrock, sp. D in the upper intertidal zone of protected
gravel beaches in inner bays, sp. E in infiltrations of fresh
water running through gravel sediments on boulder
beaches, and sp. F in the lower layer of intertidal gravel
sediments on boulder beaches. Although further, detailed
habitat assessment is necessary, these species with their

prefer specific interstitial microhabitats characterized by
wave action, tidal level, and the presence or absence of
boulders, rocks, bedrock, and inflow of infiltrated freshwater.

Discussion
Diversity and phylogeny of Luciogobius
Overall, our discovery of numerous previously unrecognized species within Luciogobius greatly advanced our
understanding of the diversity in the genus. Different taxa
within currently recognized species generally occur in
allopatry (Figure 3), suggesting that geographic isolation
is an important process during incipient divergence [30].
It is therefore possible that genetically distinct clades simply reflect geographic differentiation within single species.
However, clades within each of L. guttatus, L. elongatus,
and L. grandis are often found on a single beach yet
remain distinct in the nuclear gene genealogy, which suggests the presence of a reproductive barrier. Also, at least
the six genetic clades within L. elongatus can be clearly distinguished based on vertebra number, degree of reduction
of the pelvic fin sucker, and microhabitat, indicating that
the level of Cyt b differentiation found in L. elongatus (6.8–
13.8% uncorrected pairwise difference) represents divergence at the species level. Further genetic, morphological,
and ecological studies are therefore likely to reveal additional evidence for the identity of species recovered in this
study.

The species-level phylogeny based on combined analysis
of six nuclear genes suggested that the genus Luciogobius is
monophyletic and does not include Inu koma and I. saikaiensis. Previous inclusion of the Inu species in Luciogobius is
based on the shared absence of the first dorsal fin and
scales [13], which likely reflects parallel reduction associated with adaptation to narrow habitats (e. g., rocky
shores, gravel beaches). The genus Luciogobius as treated
here clearly differs osteologically from Inu and other
gobies: the pterygiophore of the first ray of the second
dorsal fin is inserted into the caudal vertebra in Luciogobius, whereas that of all other gobies is connected to the
abdominal column. The two undescribed species of the
unplaced genus (Gen. sp. 1 and 2) also share these characteristics with Luciogobius, suggesting that they may be
the direct sisters of Luciogobius. Alternatively, the presence
of fleshy maxillary barbels in the two species suggests
affinity to species of Inu and Clariger. Due to lack of statistical support (Figure 4 and Additional file 1), however, the
placement of Gen. sp. 1 and 2 remain inconclusive. Considering these circumstances, we tentatively treated these
species as incertae sedis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/145

Evolution of the interstitial habit
The nuclear gene phylogeny clearly suggested that the
interstitial species belong to two separate clades (Figure
4). Based on the obtained phylogenetic pattern, the interstitial habit evolved either twice independently in the
common ancestors of these two clades, or once in the
common ancestor of Luciogobius and was lost twice independently in L. pallidus and L. guttatus. Although there is
no rationale for choosing between these alternative
hypotheses, in either case, the analysis of independent
contrasts indicates that transitions to interstitial habits are
strongly correlated with increases in vertebra number.
Since an increase in vertebra number results in finer segmentation of the vertebral column and hence improved
flexibility of the body, the evolution of an elongated body
with a highly segmented vertebral column has likely been
one of the key innovations during adaptation to the
dynamic gravel environment. The ground vertebra
number of gobiid fishes is 26, which is fixed across more
than 70% of all goby species occurring in Japan [12] (Figure 6). However, interstitial Luciogobius species have far
more vertebrae than this number, despite being among
the smallest of gobiid fishes (ranging in size from 2 cm in
L. adapel to 7 cm in L. grandis). Gobies with the highest
numbers of vertebrae (58 and 56) are medium sized fishes
(6–9 cm) of the genus Gunnellichthys [12]; therefore, the
vertebral column of interstitial Luciogobius are among the
most finely segmented of all gobiid fishes.
Diversification of Luciogobius in the Japanese Arc
The Japanese Arc is located on compressional margins of
four tectonic plates (i. e., Okhotsk, Eurasia, Philippine,
and Pacific Plates), and this has caused active orogenesis
that started ca. 15 Ma in the Middle Miocene [20-22]. The
resultant steep mountain ranges and abundant rainfall
provided by monsoons have brought a rich supply of terrigenous rocks to the sea via rivers. The steep, strongly
indented nature of the Japanese seacoasts and active stirring by waves have also facilitated the accumulation of
well-sorted rocks and gravels along the coast [4]. These
processes are the major cause of the present-day excessive
abundance of gravel beaches in Japan. Importantly in the
tropics, where gobies are most diverse, many seacoasts are
fringed by coral reef, which diminishes strong wave action
and prevents the development of well-sorted gravel
beaches.

Considering the uniqueness of Japanese seacoasts, the
high species diversity and largely restricted distribution of
interstitial Luciogobius in the Japanese Arc are mostly feasibly interpreted as the result of in situ diversification within
the archipelago. In fact, our estimation of the origin of the
interstitial species (6–12 Ma; Figure 4, Additional files 3
and 4) is consistent with the initial formation of Japanese
mountain ranges being followed by colonization by Luci-

ogobius and subsequent diversification. Furthermore, our
results suggest that different species of interstitial Luciogobius prefer gravel sediments with largely different gravel
sizes (Figure 5). This indicates that the granulometric
complexity of gravel beaches has provided an opportunity
for niche partitioning among major clades of Luciogobius,
which was probably an important process during the initial stages of their diversification. Although closely related
Luciogobius species are similar in morphology and may
occupy interstitial habitats with similar granulometric
parameters, their microhabitats differ with respect to wave
action, tidal level, and the presence or absence of boulders, rocks, bedrock, and the inflow of infiltrated fresh
water.
Adaptive radiation of Luciogobius
Adaptive radiation is the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity within a rapidly diversifying lineage.
Schluter [31] proposed four criteria for detecting an adaptive radiation: (1) recent common ancestry, (2) phenotype-environment correlation, (3) trait utility, and (4)
rapid speciation. Even the widely acknowledged examples

of adaptive radiation rarely fulfil or explicitly test these criteria [31]; thus, it is beyond the scope of the present study
to fully substantiate the four criteria. However, available
evidence suggests that the present organismal and phenotypic diversity of Luciogobius is likely the result of an adaptive radiation in the interstitial habitats of gravel beaches.
Recent common ancestry is clearly the case of interstitial
Luciogobius species. Although the interstitial species are
not monophyletic, they are all descended from a recent
common ancestor, which colonized gravel beaches and
evolved to utilize various interstitial environments. We
found that gravel sediments with different granulometric
properties are occupied by different species of interstitial
Luciogobius (Figure 5). This habitat preference is associated
with differences in body size and vertebra number (phenotype-environment correlation), because species having
more finely-segmented body tend to inhabit small, wellsorted gravels. For example, L. elongatus, L. adapel, and L.
sp., which have the smallest body sizes and highest vertebra numbers of all Luciogobius species, inhabit sediments
with the most finely sorted gravels, whereas L. grandis hav-

utility) is not straightforward to assess. Nevertheless, it is
likely that fine morphological match to the gravel environment promotes fishes' ability to burrow into the sediment, escape from predators, and/or capture prey in wavedisturbed gravel beaches. Finally, recent ancestry (< 12
Ma) and a remarkable diversity of Luciogobius species
found within a small geographic area (the Japanese Arc
and surrounding regions) are consistent with rapid speciation in Luciogobius. Indeed, the number of species in Luciogobius far exceeds those found in any other related
marine genera (18 in Luciogobius vs. five in the next largest
genus Clariger). Although further study is clearly necessary, the above observations suggest that Luciogobius provides a valuable, promising new example of adaptive
radiation that took place in a habitat previously considered inaccessible to vertebrates.

Conclusion
Overall, our findings illuminate the significance of gravel
beaches as previously unappreciated theaters of marine
fish radiation. Luciogobius fishes have adapted to this
dynamic environment with elongated bodies and finely
segmented vertebral columns, which allowed them to
access new niches and radiate into various microhabitats
within the gravel beach. Interstitial habitats of gravel
beaches are not utilized by any other vertebrate, which has
likely been important for these gobies to flourish in such
a unique habitat. It is likely that adaptation to interstitial
habitats has provided preconditions for the colonization
of infiltrating underground water, anchialine caves, or
estuarine mudshrimp burrows, which further fuelled the
diversification of this unique fish clade. Therefore, the
genus Luciogobius offers a valuable future model system
for studying vertebrate adaptation to interstitial life and
adaptive radiation by fishes in an extraordinary habitat.

Methods
(a) Sampling
Gobies were collected from various coastal habitats along
the Japanese seacoast (Figure 2 and Additional file 6). We
sampled seven of the 11 described Luciogobius species and
one putative undescribed species that does not match any
of the known species morphologically (Table 1). Inu koma
and I. saikaiensis are included in Luciogobius in most recent
classifications [e.g. [13]], but they are treated as a separate
genus, which concurs with our phylogenetic results. We
also sampled 11 additional species representing eight
related genera and two undescribed taxa that are probably
related to Luciogobius. Among the Luciogobius species, four
taxa are strictly interstitial and occur only in the intertidal
zones of well-sorted gravel beaches [16-19]. Another
interstitial species, L. adapel, lives in gravel beds at depths

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/145

of 20~40 m, and has completely lost the first and second
dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins [11]. The remaining species
are found under rocks in estuary sand beds (L. guttatus and
L. dormitoris) or in underground water in gravel estuaries
(L. pallidus and L. albus) [10,32-34]. Luciogobius albus, the
only known cavefish in Japan, has been collected only
from a few anchialine caves [33], while L. pallidus is sometimes found within mudshrimp burrows [35]. We were
unable to sample L. albus, L. dormitoris, L. brevipterus, or L.
matellii; the last three species are known only from the
type collections [10,36,37]. A full list of sampling localities is provided in Additional file 6.
Gobies were collected using either a hand net or by scooping gravel sediments with a shovel and placing them into
a net to sort the fish. Luciogobius adapel was collected using
a bottom sampler at depths of 20 m. For each goby, a
small fragment of muscle tissue was removed and kept in
absolute ethanol for subsequent extraction of DNA, and
the remaining body was kept in 10% formalin solution
for morphological examination.
(b) Molecular protocols
Genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue following
a standard phenol-chloroform method. Using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we amplified fragments
of the Cyt b gene using the primers detailed in Additional
file 7. PCR conditions for amplifying the Cyt b fragments
consisted of an initial 5 min at 94°C, followed by 30
cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 45°C, and 1 min at
72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR
reaction conditions for the six nuclear genes were the
same as those for Cyt b, except for the annealing temperatures, which are listed along with the primer sequences in
Additional file 7. The PCR products were purified using
NucleoSpin Extract (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany).
Both strands were sequenced using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer, Foster City, CA), and an ABI 3100 sequencer.
Obtained sequences have been deposited in the DNA
Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) database [DDBJ: AB503858–
AB504232].
(c) Phylogenetic analysis
The alignment was straightforward and required only a
few unambiguous gaps in the Mll intron. Analyses were
conducted separately for the Cyt b gene and the combined
nuclear genes, and for each dataset, phylogenetic trees
were obtained using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods. Because
saturation of base substitution was suspected in the Cyt b
data, we partitioned the data by codon positions and plotted transitions against transversions to detect potential
saturation [38] using PAUP* version 4.0b10 [39]. This
analysis suggested that the third codon position of the Cyt

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:145

b gene suffered from substitution saturation (Additional
file 8). However, trees reconstructed with and without the
third codon position did not differ significantly in terms
of resolution and branch support; thus, we only report
results obtained using all positions combined.
Using PAUP*, we performed MP analysis with 100 random addition analyses and tree bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping and we validated the robustness
of the MP trees using bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. Before the ML analysis, the program Modeltest
3.0 [40] was used to select appropriate models of base
substitution and to estimate model parameters. ML analysis of the Cyt b dataset proved to be very computer-intensive using the TBR swapping algorithm and so was done
using PhyML [41], while that of the combined nuclear
dataset was performed using PAUP* with ten random
addition analyses and TBR branch swapping. ML bootstrap analyses of both datasets were conducted with
PhyML with 100 replications. For the Bayesian analysis,
we used the program MrModeltest 2.2 [42] to select an
appropriate model of base substitution for each gene partition. Based on the selected models, we performed Bayesian analyses using MrBayes 3.1.2 [43] with the unlink
command (nuclear dataset only) to estimate substitution
parameters separately for each partition. Analyses consisted of running four simultaneous chains for 2 × 106
generations, sampling trees every 1000 generations for a
total of 2001 trees. We plotted the ln-likelihood of the
sampled trees against generation time to identify the
region of the analysis in which the parameter estimates
were stable. Then, we discarded the burn-in region (trees
and parameter estimates obtained before equilibrium; the
initial 1001 trees), and the remaining 1000 samples were
used to estimate the tree topology, branch lengths, and
substitution parameters.
(d) Analysis of vertebra number evolution
Number of vertebrae was counted for 1–19 representative
individuals for each taxa identified from the Cyt b phylogeny (Additional file 2). Vertebral counts were taken from
radiographs produced with Softex Type C-60 (Softex,
Tokyo, Japan) exposed at 20 KVp and 4 mA for 20 seconds. Then, the average vertebra number for each taxon
was mapped onto the combined nuclear ML phylogeny,
and ancestral state estimates of vertebra number were
obtained using the squared change parsimony algorithm
as implemented in Mesquite version 1.12 [44]. To test for
correlated evolution between interstitial habitat use and
vertebra number along cladogenesis, we calculated independent contrasts [23] of each of the variables using the
PDAP module of Mesquite [45]. Each species was assigned
as either interstitial (1) or non-interstitial (0) as designated in Table 1. The use of discrete character states does
not violate the assumption of independent contrasts [46].

(e) Estimation of divergence time
Combined nuclear gene ML phylogeny was transformed
to an ultrametric tree using the penalized-likelihood
relaxed clock approach with the program r8s [25]. Since a
reliable maximum prior for the age of the root node is not
available, we first obtained a linearized tree by fixing the
age of the root node at one arbitrary time unit (without
any internal constraints) with a smoothing parameter of
10 as inferred by cross validation. This analysis produces
an ultrametric tree with fixed relative node heights but
without absolute ages. Divergence times on this tree were
then calibrated using (1) the split between Gymnogobius
isaza and G. urotaenia, which was previously estimated at
2.3 Ma based on geological calibration [24] and (2) the
divergence rate of the Cyt b gene. For the later approach,
every node on the ultrametric tree obtained by penalized
likelihood was used individually as a calibration point to
obtain a conservative range of estimates for the MRCA of
the interstitial Luciogobius species. We used the Cyt b divergence rate because it is generally conserved across fish
taxa, has been used previously for dating in gobies [47],
and clusters at approximately 2.7% per My in gobiid taxa
[24]. Using the 2.7% per My substitution rate, the average
pairwise ML distance across each node was transformed to
absolute age, and this was used individually as a calibration point. We obtained 95% credibility intervals of node
estimates by producing 100 bootstrapped datasets using
the SeqBoot program in the PHYLIP package [48], estimating branch lengths of the above ML phylogeny under
the substitution model used in the ML calculations, and
performing divergence date estimates as described above.

In addition to the above two approaches using internal
calibration points, we also adjusted the age of the root
node so that the overall rate of Cytb substitution equals
the previously inferred rate of 0.0135 substitutions/site/
My, which is half the 2.7% divergence rate [24]. We first
calculated branch lengths of the ML topology using the
Cyt b data with a substitution model and parameters
inferred using Modeltest. This tree was linearized by fixing
the age of the root node, and substitution rate along each
branch calculated, using the program r8s. We iterated the
age of the root node until an average substitution rate
comparable to 0.0135 substitutions/site/My was found.
The inferred root node age was then used to estimate the
age of the MRCA of interstitial Luciogobius by performing
a penalized likelihood analysis on the combined nuclear
ML phylogeny.
(f) Habitat assessment
We obtained median gravel size and sorting index of the
sediment for five interstitial species (L. grandis, L. platycephalus, L. elongatus, L. adapel, and an undescribed species
Luciogobius sp.). When we collected the gobies, we also
sampled 1–4 litres of sediment from the habitats where

the gobies were found using a shovel. Sediment samples
were passed through a series of standard sieves with running water, dried separately, and weighed. Then, the
median particle size and sorting index were calculated
using the equation given in [28], and between-species differences in these indices were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
