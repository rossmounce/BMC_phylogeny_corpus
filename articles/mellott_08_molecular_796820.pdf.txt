Abstract
Background: The tissue distributions and functions of Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands have
been well studied, however less is known about their evolutionary history. We have undertaken a
phylogenetic analysis of Eph receptors and ephrins from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate
species.
Results: Our findings indicate that Eph receptors form three major clades: one comprised of nonchordate and cephalochordate Eph receptors, a second comprised of urochordate Eph receptors,
and a third comprised of vertebrate Eph receptors. Ephrins, on the other hand, fall into either a
clade made up of the non-chordate and cephalochordate ephrins plus the urochordate and
vertebrate ephrin-Bs or a clade made up of the urochordate and vertebrate ephrin-As.
Conclusion: We have concluded that Eph receptors and ephrins diverged into A and B-types at
different points in their evolutionary history, such that primitive chordates likely possessed an
ancestral ephrin-A and an ancestral ephrin-B, but only a single Eph receptor. Furthermore, ephrinAs appear to have arisen in the common ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates, whereas
ephrin-Bs have a more ancient bilaterian origin. Ancestral ephrin-B-like ligands had transmembrane
domains; as GPI anchors appear to have arisen or been lost at least 3 times.

Background
The Eph family represents the largest subgroup of receptor
tyrosine kinases, with most vertebrate genomes having 14
members [1]. Eph receptors can be divided into two
classes based on sequence similarity and ligand binding
affinity [2,3]. A-type Eph receptors (EphA1–8,10) bind
promiscuously to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) –
linked ephrin-A ligands (ephrin-A1–6), whereas B-type
Eph receptors (EphB1–4, 6) bind promiscuously to transmembrane ephrin-B ligands (ephrin-B1–3). The only
known exceptions to this are EphA4, which can bind
ephrin-B2 and 3 in addition to the ephrin-As [3], and

EphB2, which can bind ephrin-A5 in addition to the
ephrin-Bs [4].
Eph receptors and ephrin ligands classically function in
cell-cell repulsion events. For example, retinal ganglion
cell (RGC) axons expressing high levels of Eph receptors
are excluded from ephrin-rich regions in the optic tectum
and instead map to points where ligand expression is low
[5,6]. Eph receptors and ephrins similarly show complementary distributions in the developing hindbrain, where
their interactions function to keep different cell populations separate and thus establish segment boundaries [7].
Eph receptors are also expressed by the neural crest (NC)

and mediate the exclusion of these cells from territories
where complementary ephrin ligands are expressed, thus
restricting their migration to stereotypical pathways [8,9].
Eph receptors and ephrins are found throughout the
metazoans and the phylogeny of these genes in vertebrates is well established [10,11]. However, the relationship of invertebrate Eph receptors and ephrins to their
vertebrate counterparts is not as clear [12]. A number of
studies have constructed phylogenies using vertebrate and
ecdysozoan (e.g. nematode and insect) sequences, generally resulting in trees with three major clades: one comprised of ecdysozoan Eph receptors/ephrins, a second
comprised of vertebrate EphAs/ephrin-As, and a third
comprised of vertebrate EphBs/ephrin-Bs [11,13,14].
However, this approach is unsatisfactory because of the
large evolutionary gaps between the protostomes and the
vertebrates. The increasing availability of genomic data
from deuterostomes such as echinoderms, urochordates
and cephalochordates presents an opportunity to better
resolve the question of how Eph receptors and ephrins
diversified.

Results
The amino acid sequences of the full-length Eph receptors
could be readily aligned with the ephrin binding domains
and the tyrosine kinase domains being most highly conserved and acting as anchors (see Additional file 1). Gaps
were introduced principally by inclusion of the human
EphA6 and C. intestinalis Eph sequences. The full-length
Eph sequences ranged from 10% to 68% identity, whereas
the sequences between the ephrin binding domain and
the kinase domain ranged from 30 to 60% identity. Trees
constructed from full-length sequences, sequences
between the Ephrin binding and kinase domains, or from
the kinase domain alone all had similar topology. The
full-length Ephrin amino acid sequences will also readily
align with ClustalW centered on the conserved Ephrin
domain (see Additional file 2). The amino terminal
sequence of N. vectensis and the amino and carboxyl
sequences of D. melanogaster sequence are unique and
were removed from the analysis. Gaps were introduced to
accommodate the D. melanogaster and C. elegans
sequences. The overall identity within the Ephrin
sequences was from 10 to 60%, whereas within the Ephrin
domain identities ranged from 30 to 60%. Several of the
sequences used are predictions made from genomic data
and introns exon boundary predictions may be incorrect.
Our phylogenetic tree for invertebrate and vertebrate Eph
receptors is comprised of a cephalochordate plus nonchordate clade, a urochordate clade, and a vertebrate clade
(Fig. 1). There is weak support for the Urochordate and
Cephalochordate/Metazoan grouping, however independent diversification of urochordate, cephalochordate,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/27

and ecdysozoan clades is well supported. With this larger
data set, there is a distinct vertebrate Eph clade divided
into a EphA and EphB groups. Within the EphA clade,
there is strong bootstrap support for a subgroup comprised of EphA3–6,8 and another comprised of EphA7
and 10. Similarly, within the EphB clade, there is a distinct
group comprised of Eph4,6 and another comprised of
Eph1–3.
Our phylogenetic tree for ephrin ligands can be broadly
divided into two major clades (Fig. 2). One diverse group
includes coelenterate, ecdysozoan, echinoderm, cephalochordate, urochordate and vertebrate B ephrins. Within
this group there is evidence for independent diversification of cephalochordate, ecdysozoan and deuterostome
ephrin ligands. The second major ephrin clade is comprised of a urochordate ephrin-A subclade and a vertebrate ephrin-A subclade. There is good support for this
being a monophyletic group in which there have been
independent diversifications.

Discussion
The clearest implication from our phylogenetic analysis is
that Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands diversified at
different times in evolutionary history. Vertebrate EphAs
and EphBs do not have invertebrate orthologues, whereas
vertebrate ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs have urochordate
counterparts. This suggests that the diversification of Eph
receptors followed the diversification of ephrins and that
the common ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates
likely had a single receptor for the two different types of
ligand.
The possibility exists that EphA4 and EphB2 have some
special relationship to the ancestor of vertebrate Eph
receptors, given that these two receptors are uniquely
capable of interacting with both ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs
[3,4]. Indeed, the most common vertebrate matches for
urochordate Eph receptors returned from BLAST searches
are EphA4 and EphB2. EphA4 and EphB2 may therefore
represent the most ancient vertebrate Eph receptors. By
this scenario, the descendants of the ancestral Eph, which
was presumably capable of interacting with both types of
ligand, became increasingly specific for either ephrin-As
or ephrin-Bs, such that EphA4 and EphB2 persist as the
only reminders of the ancestral characteristic of dual ligand binding specificity. Our findings, however, fail to support this idea since neither EphA4 nor EphB2 is placed
outside of a subclade containing the remaining EphA or
EphB receptors. This suggests that vertebrate Eph receptors
randomly lost the ability to interact with both ephrin-As
and ephrin-Bs as they diversified, which is consistent with
the fact that EphA4 cannot bind all ephrin-Bs just as
EphB2 cannot bind all ephrin-As. However, the homology
of the urochordate Eph receptors to EphA4 and EphB2

remains as a point of support for the idea that the predecessor of vertebrate Eph receptors could bind to both
ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs.
Is there evidence that the diversification of Eph receptors
in the vertebrates is associated with a diversification of
function? The functions performed by Eph receptors and
ephrins typically fall into one of several categories including regulation of axon guidance (e.g. formation of visual

topographic maps), directed cell migration (e.g. NC cell
pathfinding), or tissue segregation (e.g. hindbrain segmentation). Do EphA receptors perform different functions from EphB receptors? A survey of the literature
reveals that while some specific roles are unique to each
class of receptor, in a broader context both EphAs and
EphBs perform a wide range of similar functions. For
example, EphAs are uniquely involved in tissue segregation events that are part of somite segmentation [15,16]

and limb development [17-20], as well as motor neuron
axon guidance [21-27]. On the other hand, both EphAs
and EphBs contribute to hindbrain segmentation [7,2831], segregation of veins from arteries during angiogenesis
[32-35], patterning of the inner ear [36,37], directed
migration of NC cells [8,9,38,39], and guidance of RGC
axons to their targets [39-41]. Thus, it is difficult to ascribe
one set of functions to EphAs and another to EphBs. The
impressive array of EphAs and EphBs may simply reflect

the duplication and diversification of an ancestral receptor to perform subtle variations of the same functions in
different cell or tissue types as the body plan become progressively more complex in the lineage from basal chordate to vertebrate.
Another intriguing question is if one of the three prototypical functions performed by Eph receptors can be
regarded as ancestral. The surprising discovery of a porif-

eran Eph [10] indicates that these receptors are not a
eumetazoan novelty. Sponges lack nerves, muscles, and
true tissues, but do possess a cellular grade of organization
in which different cell types are arranged into tissue-like
layers such as the porous epidermis (pinacoderm) on the
exterior and the lining of flagellated cells on the interior
[42,43]. While there has been no research on Eph function in sponges, they may play a role in the positioning of
these different cell types during development [44]. In the
nematode C. elegans, Eph receptors and ephrins are
expressed in adjacent populations of neural precursor
cells and when either receptor or ligand function is disrupted, the neural precursors become disorganized and
the ventral epidermis fails to close over these cells [45,56].
While the Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in neural cells, the function performed here is more consistent
with a tissue segregation mechanism. On the other hand,
defective Eph function in C. elegans also results in axons
extending beyond their expected target sites [47], indicating that these receptors can contribute to axon guidance in
invertebrates as well. In the insect D. melanogaster, Eph
receptors and ephrins function similarly to guide cortical
axons to the optic ganglion [48] and restrict interneuronal
axons from either crossing the midline or exiting the central nervous system [49]. In the echinoderm S. purpuratus,
Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in non-overlapping ectoderm domains and do not appear to function
directly in axon guidance, but rather are involved in patterning domains of ectoderm (Jones, Yaguchi, and Burke,
unpublished). In C. intestinalis embryos, Eph and ephrin
mediate an early cell fate specification by activation of
ERK signalling pathway producing an asymmetric cell
division [50]. [51] has speculated that the ancestral function is regulation of cellular movements, but we currently
lack sufficient functional data from diverse metazoans to
reasonably conclude which functions of Eph receptors can
be regarded as ancestral. A better understanding of the
interacting signal transduction components of Eph and
ephrin signalling pathways may reveal relationships not
apparent from considerations of overall function.
A second important implication from our findings is that
ephrin-Bs are the more ancient of the two types of vertebrate ephrins. The urochordate and vertebrate ephrin-Bs
are actually part of a larger clade that also includes cnidarian, nematode, insect, echinoderm, and cephalochordate
ephrins. The urochordate and vertebrate subclade is
grouped with one comprised of cephalochordate, echinoderm, and cnidarian ephrins, while the nematode and
insect ephrins form an external ecdysozoan clade. The
four C. elegans ephrins are paraphyletic with the single D.
melanogaster ephrin, perhaps indicating that the common
ancestor for nematodes and insects possessed multiple
ephrins, some of which were lost in the lineage to D. melanogaster. Although lineage specific expansion of ephrins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/27

occur, so an expansion of the C. elegans complement is
equally likely.
Our analysis of Eph receptors suggests urochordate Eph
receptors are more closely related to vertebrate receptors
than the cephalochordate receptors, BfEph1 and BfEph2.
Similarly, our analysis of ephrins allies vertebrate A-type
ligands with urochordate A-type ligands. These topologies
are contrary to the more firmly established relationship of
cephalochordates being considered the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Similar results have been reported
with other analyses involving small sets of molecules, yet
more complete sets confirm the conventional relationships [12,52]. The evolutionary history of Eph receptors
and ephrin ligands appears to be distinct from the history
of the species, which suggests that functional features of
these molecules have constrained their diversification.
The unusual topology of the ephrin-B clade suggests that
the ligands possessed by cnidarians, echinoderms, and
cephalochordates are more ephrin-B-like than those possessed by ecdysozoans. On the other hand the bootstrap
support for the cnidarian, echindoderm, and cephalochordate ephrins grouping with the urochordate and vertebrate ephrin-Bs is low. Therefore, the possibility of a
more obvious non-chordate plus cephalochordate subclade existing cannot be excluded. Although there is currently a wealth of genomic information available for an
array of invertebrates, there are no Eph receptor or ephrin
sequences from lophotrochozoans. This puts a considerable gap into our analysis, the elimination of which might
allow for a more clear resolution of ephrin-B phylogeny.
Our analysis suggests that a clade of ephrin-A ligands distinguished by sequence similarity in the ephrin domain
arose in a common ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates. Curiously, some of the invertebrate ephrins lack a
transmembrane domain and have a putative GPI anchor
site, which is the defining feature of the vertebrate A type
ephrins. These invertebrate ephrins have an ephrin-B-like
receptor binding domain that is the tethered to the cell
membrane by a GPI anchor. Predictions of transmembrane domains occur in cnidarians, insects, urochordates,
cephalochordates, and vertebrates. Whereas, GPI anchors
predictions occur in nematodes, echinoderms, urochordates and vertebrates. This distribution suggests that a
transmembrane anchorage of an ephrin with a B-type ligand binding domain is the ancestral state and that GPI
anchors have arisen or been lost at least 3 times. The types
of membrane anchorage have yet to be confirmed experimentally, but it suggests that the vertebrate ephrin As are
a homologous group related by their binding domain and
that the mechanism of anchorage is not a reliable defining
feature for the group.

Conclusion
We have shown through a phylogenetic analysis that Eph
receptors and ephrin ligands followed different paths of
evolution. For the receptors, the ancestral Eph receptors of
non-chordates and cephalochordates diversified independently in urochordates and vertebrates. For the ligands
there were lineage specific diversifications of forms with
ephrin-B-like receptor binding domains and ephrin-As
appear in the founding lineages of urochordates and vertebrates. Ephrins and Eph receptors therefore diversified
at different points in evolution, such that the common
ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates possessed a single receptor, but two ligands. Additional data on the functions and signalling pathways employed by Eph receptors
and ephrins in diverse metazoans are necessary to more
clearly define the evolutionary relationships within this
intriguing family of signalling molecules.

Methods
Full length Eph and/or ephrin amino acid sequences for
Ephydatia fluviatilis (poriferan), Nematostella vectensis (cnidarian), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Drosophila
melanogaster (insect), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (echinoderm), Branchiostoma floridae (cephalochordate),
Ciona intestinalis (urochordate), and Homo sapiens (vertebrate) were retrieved from (53–55, see additional files 1,
2). Sequences were aligned in MEGA 4.0 (56) and assembled into phylogenetic trees using the minimum evolution (ME), maximum parsimony (MP), neighbour joining
(NJ), and UPGMA methods. Sequences aligned in BioEdit
(57) were assembled into maximum likelihood (ML)
trees using the Treefinder (58) program. Trees were created under the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino
acid substitution (where appropriate) using 1000 bootstrap replications. In each case, the ME, ML, and NJ trees
gave very similar results and so we have included only the
ML trees here. GPI modification site predictions were
done at (59) and transmembrane domain predictions
were made at the TMHMM server (60) (see Additional file
3).
