Abstract
Background: The first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis is catalyzed by PIG-A, an enzyme that
transfers N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol. This
protein is present in all eukaryotic organisms ranging from protozoa to higher mammals, as part of
a larger complex of five to six 'accessory' proteins whose individual roles in the glycosyltransferase
reaction are as yet unclear. The PIG-A gene has been shown to be an essential gene in various
eukaryotes. In humans, mutations in the protein have been associated with paroxysomal noctural
hemoglobuinuria. The corresponding PIG-A gene has also been recently identified in the genome
of many archaeabacteria although genes of the accessory proteins have not been discovered in
them. The present study explores the evolution of PIG-A and the phylogenetic relationship
between this protein and other glycosyltransferases.
Results: In this paper we show that out of the twelve conserved motifs identified by us eleven are
exclusively present in PIG-A and, therefore, can be used as markers to identify PIG-A from newly
sequenced genomes. Three of these motifs are absent in the primitive eukaryote, G. lamblia.
Sequence analyses show that seven of these conserved motifs are present in prokaryote and
archaeal counterparts in rudimentary forms and can be used to differentiate PIG-A proteins from
glycosyltransferases. Using partial least square regression analysis and data involving presence or
absence of motifs in a range of PIG-A and glycosyltransferases we show that (i) PIG-A may have
evolved from prokaryotic glycosyltransferases and lipopolysaccharide synthases, members of the
GT4 family of glycosyltransferases and (ii) it is possible to uniquely classify PIG-A proteins versus
glycosyltransferases.
Conclusion: Besides identifying unique motifs and showing that PIG-A protein from G. lamblia and
some putative PIG-A proteins from archaebacteria are evolutionarily closer to glycosyltransferases,
these studies provide a new method for identification and classification of PIG-A proteins.

Background
Biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cell represents a highly conserved activity in eukaryotes due to the
conservation of the basic structural unit of GPI anchors
[1,2]. The basic anchor consists of a phosphatidylinositol
(PI) moiety decorated with a glucosamine (GlcN) to
which additional 3–5 mannose (Man) residues are
attached to generate a linear chain. One or more of these
Man residues are in turn modified by ethanolamine phosphate (EtP). The nascent protein destined to be GPI
anchored is attached to the EtP present on the third Man
[3].
Despite the overall structure conservation, several speciesspecific differences exist within the GPI biosynthetic pathway. The number of Man residues varies from species to
species. For example, GPI anchors isolated from T. cruzi
and P. falciparum possess an additional mannose residue
[4]. The EtP modification of the Man residues also shows
significant species-dependent variation [5]. GPI anchors
from many species contain additional sugars such as
galactose (Gal) attached to some of the Man residues. In
addition, branching at the sugar residues has also been
reported [6]. The inositol too could have additional acylation at the 2'-OH position in some species and lipid
remodeling of the GPI anchors can add to the possible
variations observed in the glycolipid anchors of several
species [7].
The advantages of anchoring proteins via GPI anchors
vary depending on the protein anchored and the organism concerned [8]. Unlike integral membrane proteins,
GPI anchored proteins can be readily released from the
cell surface under appropriate conditions. In C. neoformans, for instance, GPI anchor has been postulated to regulate the secretion of phospholipase B1 in response to
environmental conditions and hence determine virulence
[9]. The shedding of several GPI anchored proteins from
the sperm cell surface by the GPIase activity of angiotensin
converting enzyme has been shown to be crucial for fertilization in mice [10]. Anchoring of proteins to the membrane via a glycolipid anchor also allows for greater threedimensional flexibility for the protein on the cell surface
and can influence rates of ligand-interaction [11]. Thus,
several GPI-anchored proteins act as cell-surface receptors.
For example, the LPS receptor in human endothelial
membrane is GPI anchored and its removal with PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) affects leukocyte recruitment [12]. Similarly, the malarial parasite receptor on
erythrocytes also is GPI anchored [13].
As cell surface receptors, GPI anchored proteins play a
vital role in cell signaling, growth, adhesion, and virulence. Lowering the expression of such proteins or inter-

ference with GPI anchor synthesis would, therefore, be
expected to interfere with several important functions of
the cell. Indeed, tethering of cell surface proteins using
GPI anchors appears to be critical for the normal development and functioning of eukaryotes including many disease-causing organisms (for a recent review see [14]).
GPI anchor biosynthesis is a multi-step process involving
at least 23 proteins in humans. The first step of this pathway involves transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
from UDP-GlcNAc to PI, a reaction catalyzed by PIG-A.
The gene coding for PIG-A has been cloned from many
organisms and has been demonstrated to be essential for
cell viability [15-18]. Using bioinformatics tools, we have
attempted to understand the evolution of PIG-A. Our
results suggest that it has evolved from glycosyltransferases present in prokaryotic systems. We have also identified motifs unique to PIG-A that may be helpful to
characterize PIG-A proteins from newly sequenced
genomes.

Results
GPI-GnT complex: Species-dependent variation
The first step in the GPI anchor biosynthesis involves the
GlcNAc transferase complex (GPI-GnT). As mentioned
before this complex comprises of seven proteins in
humans. PIG-A has been hypothesized as the catalytic
unit of the GPI-GnT complex due to the presence of a conserved glycosyltransferase domain. Using the human
sequences as query, BLAST analysis was carried out to
identify homologous sequences in other eukaryotes (see
table 1 for the list of organisms and proteins surveyed
along with the abbreviations used). The results show the
presence of PIG-A in all organisms [19,20].

The early-branching eukaryote G. lamblia possesses a very
rudimentary endoplasmic reticulum [21]. Since most of
the GPI-anchor biosynthetic enzymes are localized in
endoplasmic reticulum an analysis was carried out to find
out which of the polypeptides of the GPI-GnT complex
are present in G. lamblia. Our analysis revealed presence of
only PIG-A but not any of the accessory proteins in this
organism (Table 2). Thus, it appears that PIG-A is sufficient for the formation of GlcNAc-PI. Therefore, we
decided to investigate the evolution of PIG-A with the aim
of understanding its ancestral sequences.
After aligning the sequences using ClustalW (Figure 1), we
made an initial inference on the evolution of PIG-A by
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2); [see Additional file 1].
The G. lamblia sequence was found to be relatively closer
to other protozoan sequences. The fungal (S. cerevisiae, S.
pombe, and C. albicans) PIG-A proteins clustered together.
Similarly, the PIG-A proteins from L. major and T. brucei
appeared to have diverged from a common ancestor. Sur-

prisingly P. falciparum and E. histolytica were grouped
together and far from the kinetoplastid PIG-As in spite of
their different phylogenetic relationship. PIG-As from all
higher eukaryotes were found in the same cluster, with
plants forming a distinct subgroup within this cluster with
the exception of the protozoan D. discoideum, which was
observed to be closer to the higher rather than the lower
eukaryotes.
Since the presence of GPI-anchored proteins in some species of archaea has been reported earlier [22,23],
sequences from the archaeal genome database that
showed significant similarity with the consensus PIG-A
sequence from eukaryotes were identified by BLAST. A
phylogenetic analysis including putative PIG-As from
some archaeal species such as A. pernix, T. acidophilum,
M. barkeri and M. acetivorans along with the eukaryotic
PIG-A sequences showed that the G. lamblia PIG-A was
closer to its archaeal counterparts rather than other
eukaryotes, including many protozoa (Figure 3); [see

Motif identification in PIG-A
A discovery approach was used to identify motifs in PIGA sequences that could potentially be used to identify its
ancestors. In order to identify conserved residues and
potential motifs a number of these sequences were
aligned and the alignment was pruned manually by
removing gaps.

Motifs were designated as stretches of amino acid residues
where some of the amino acid residues were conserved
and represented in the same format as that in "Prosite
database" [24,25]. These were labeled as conserved motifs
(CM1-12) and numbered from N- to C-terminal of the
protein as in Prosite format. Twelve motifs were identified
by this method. The motifs were subsequently verified by
using PRATT [26,27] and Scan Prosite as explained in
"Methods". Some of the motifs were also modified and
the modified versions of the motifs were labeled with an
additional small alphabet. For example, the modified version of CM1 was labeled as CM1a. Modifications were
done based on sequence conservation in some of the

eukaryotic PIG-A sequences. The list of conserved motifs,
identified in this study by aligning eukaryotic PIG-A
sequences, is given in Table 3. In addition, Gblocks
[28,29] was also employed for the identification of the
motifs and the results agreed well with the manual
approach [see Additional file 3]. Only small differences
were discernable, for example, CM7 was identified by
manual method as [PFK]-X-X-X-X-[VIMT]-[VI]-[PG]-N[AI] and by Gblocks software as [VISCL]-[LVMI]-R[ATSGH]-X-X-X-[PKQ]-X-X-[VIA]-[SFYD]-[VIMT]-[VI][PG]-N-[AI]-[VLTI].
Distribution of the motifs in eukaryotic PIG-A
In general, the twelve motifs identified by us were found
in all eukaryotic PIG-As except G. lambia. Three of the
motifs (CM1, CM2, and CM3) were not detected in G.
lamblia (Table 3). Since G. lamblia PIG-A is smaller than
other PIG-A proteins and lacks the three N-terminal
motifs it is likely that these motifs were added to the
eukaryotic PIG-A after G. lamblia evolved. The other possibility is that there has been a deletion in the G. lamblia
gene during the course of evolution. This possibility cannot be ruled out as these motifs were found in archaeal
PIG-A (see subsequent sections).
Archaeal PIG-A and distribution of motifs
Having identified sequences from the archaeal genome
database that showed significant similarity with the consensus PIG-A sequence from eukaryotes, motifs were also
deciphered using an alignment of eukaryotic and putative
PIG-A sequences from some archaeal species as described

before (Figure 4). Motifs related to CM4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11
and 12 described before for eukaryotic PIG-A were identified using both manual as well as Gblocks software (Figure 4); [see Additional file 4]. The motifs identified
manually by aligning eukaryotic and archaeal PIG-A
sequences were labeled with a suffix 'ar' (Table 4). For
example, CM3 and CM3ar are the conserved motifs identified by aligning all the eukaryotic PIG-A sequences and
both the eukaryotic and archaeal PIG-A sequence respectively. As shown in Table 4, there were discernable differences in these motifs as compared to those identified by
alignment of eukaryotic PIG-As alone (compare Table 3
and Table 4). However, we could not discern any pattern
in the amino acid substitutions leading to alteration in
motifs.
PIG-A and Glycosyltransferases
Glycosyltransferases have been classified into 90 groups
based on amino acid sequence similarity by Coutinho et
al. [30] and are listed in the CAZy web site [31]. This
method of classification also reflects the molecular mechanism of catalysis within a given family. In such a classification, PIG-A belongs to the GT4 family of
glycosyltransferases comprising of, amongst other members, liposaccharide biosynthesis RfbU-related protein
and polysaccharide biosynthesis protein (for example,
NP_616007 from Methanosarcina acetivorans) involved in
cell wall biogenesis. All PIG-A proteins possess a conserved glycosyltransferase domain with the conserved
EX7E motif.

Archaeal and bacterial glycosyltransferases belonging to
GT4 family were used for multiple sequence alignment
with PIG-A sequences to understand the phylogenetic
relationship within the family (Figure 5); [see Additional
file 5]. This alignment showed the presence of six conserved motifs (Figure 6; Table 5). The motifs identified
manually were labeled with a suffix 'gt' to denote that
these motifs were identified by alignment of PIG-A
sequences with glycosyltransferases. The numbering corresponds to the motifs whose progenitors they appeared
to be. Thus, the motif CM4gt is the progenitor of CM4
(compare Table 3 and Table 5). The motif CM10gt, [FYGTAL]-X-X-X-S-X-X-[ED]-X-[FLY]-[CSGP]-X-X-X-X-E-[AS],
is a specific form of EXFXXXXXE motif present in many
glycosyltransferases, including α-mannosyltransferases,
where the consensus sequence for this motif has been
identified as SXXEFGLPXXE [32]. Motifs CM1, 2, 3, 6, 7,
and 12 or their variants were not detected. Interestingly, in
this respect, G. lamblia PIG-A appeared to be similar to glycosyltransferases and LPS synthesizing enzymes.
Motif analysis using ScanProsite
The conserved motifs identified by aligning eukaryotic
PIG-A were further analyzed using ScanProsite tool to

twelve conserved motifs in PIG-A protein. Three of these motifs are absent in G. lamblia.

determine whether these motifs are characteristics of PIGA or whether they are present ubiquitously in glycosyltransferases and possibly other proteins. All the motif
sequences and the alterations done to the consensus motif
sequences (as discussed in the section on motif discovery)
are listed in Table 6.
CM7 was found to be a promiscuous sequence present in
more than 1000 proteins. Therefore, CM7 cannot be used
for identification of PIG-A sequences. As pointed out
before CM1, CM2, and CM3 were present only in eukaryotic PIG-A sequences except G. lamblia. However CM1a
and CM2a, modified versions of CM1 and CM2, were also
found to be present in archaeal PIG-A sequences (Table
6). It should be noted that CM1a and CM2a are identical
to CM1ar and CM2ar, thus confirming that archaeal
sequences contain a version of CM1 and CM2. CM2a was

also found to be present in many glycosyltransferases, histidine kinases, and transcription regulator Lac I family in
addition to PIG-A sequences. All alterations to CM3
resulted in identification of more than 1000 protein suggesting that any modification to CM3 results in a promiscuous sequence that cannot be used for the identification
of PIG-A.
As the CM4 motif was long, we split it into two segments
for analysis. CM4a as well as CM4e identified only PIG-A
sequences including that from G. lamblia. These motifs
were not present in any other protein sequences including
bacterial glycosyltransferases as well as archaeal PIG-A
sequences.
CM6, CM6a, and CM6b were found in all eukaryotic PIGA including G. lamblia. Similarly CM8 and CM9 and their

Scan Prosite. Thus CM1, CM1a and CM1b are important
variables in all 10 DCVs, suggesting that these 3 motifs are
the most robust of all and are present in all archaeal as
well as eukaryotic PIG-A proteins; likewise, CM2c appears
as the important variable in 9 out of 10 DCVs and so on.
Thus, it is possible to use these 10 motifs (or variables) to
classify PIG-A proteins and differentiate them from glycosyltransferases. According to this analysis, all the glycosyltransferases have been correctly classified. Most of the
PIG-A proteins have been correctly classified except for a
set of twelve proteins. These include PIG-A proteins from
D. rerio, E. cuniculli, M. acetivorans, T. volcanium, P. abyssi,
M. barkeri, A. pernix, T. parva, T. gondii, C. neoformans, P.
chabaudi and G. lamblia. In other words, these putative
PIG-A proteins should be more appropriately classified as
glycosyltransferases. These results agree well with the phylogenetic analysis where the PIG-A protein from G. lamblia
appears to be more closely related to those from archaeal
rather than to those from higher eukaryotes.

sis, and has lately been used for analysis of genome wide
expression data [33] (for a recent review see [34]). A
detailed description is given in the section on "Methods".
For the sake of this analysis, each variant of a motif is used
as an independent variable. Thus a total of 43 variables
were used in the PLSR analysis. A list of this is given in
Table 6. An attempt was made to classify the proteins on
the basis of a binary label, that is presence or absence of a
motif in a set of PIG-A and glycosyl transferases from a
number of different species [see Additional file 6 for the
matrix obtained as well as the list of genes and their accession numbers]. PLSR was used to understand the association of motifs with different protein lineages. A two-level
cross-validation scheme called double cross-validation
(DCV) was employed to obtain honest error results. Table
7 shows the confusion matrix for the results obtained on
the basis of the 10-fold double cross validation (DCV)
approach. The result is based on DCV segments with a
total error rate of 23%. The list of motifs that were found
useful for classification, that is, the most significant in the
first six DCV segments is shown in Table 8. As such, all the
variables (motifs) in each DCV segment should be considered to be equally important. The results here correlate
well with the results obtained from motif analysis using

GPI anchored proteins have been identified in S. solfataricus while in M. barkeri an archaeal ether-based phopholipid bearing the GPI anchor moiety head group has been
identified [23,35]. Using the big-π-predictor program,
Eisenhaber and co-workers also predict the likelihood of
GPI anchor substrate proteins in a subgroup of archaean
species including A. pernix, A. fuldigus, M. thermoautotrophicum and P. horikoshii [22]. However, no biochemical activity related to PIG-A has been demonstrated from
archaeal sources until now. Our analysis suggests that
either these organisms do not have any PIG-A protein per
se or the proteins have diverged significantly as is the case
with G. lamblia.

Discussion
GPI biosynthesis plays a critical role in the biology of
eukaryotic cells by providing membrane anchors to a large
number of proteins and glycoconjugates involved in myriad functions, including signal transduction and pathogenesis [19]. PIG-A is an important gene in the
biosynthetic pathway and studying its evolution may help
us to understand how the GPI-biosynthetic pathway
evolved in its present form in more complex organisms,
and how it may be manipulated to obtain desired phenotypes.
From phylogenetic analysis, G. lamblia PIG-A appears evolutionarily closer to the archaeal PIG-A proteins than to
those from other eukaryotes. However, there is one major
difference. While archaeal PIG-A lacks any transmembrane domain, G. lamblia PIG-A has been predicted to
possess a single transmembrane segment. This correlates
with their intracellular localization. Archaeal PIG-A is a
soluble, probably cytoplasmically localized protein, since
archaeabacteria lack ER; while G. lamblia possesses rudi-

Identification of conserved motifs in PIG-A and glycosyltransferases proteins from prokarotes, archaeabacteria, and eukaryotes
Figure 6
Identification of conserved motifs in PIG-A and glycosyltransferases proteins from prokarotes, archaeabacteria, and eukaryotes. Clustal W analysis using MAFFT was done to identify conserved motifs in PIG-A and glycosyltransferase
proteins from prokaryotes, archaeabacteria, and eukaryotes.

mentary ER vesicles to which their PIG-A is targeted. Thus,
the G. lamblia PIG-A acquired the transmembrane segment in response to increasingly complex cellular
ultrastructure.
Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated that PIG-A
proteins of archaea and eukarya evolved from the glycosyltransferases and lipopolysaccharide glycosyltransferases of prokaryotes. Indeed, the results obtained using

PLSR suggest that not only did PIG-A proteins evolve from
glycosyltransferases but that the PIG-A protein from a
primitive eukaryote like G. lamblia should more correctly
be classified as glycosyltransferase. It also allowed us to
verify that the motifs identified and analyzed by us could
in fact be useful in making a distinction between 'true'
PIG-A proteins and glycosyltransferases.

PIG-A proteins were found to have twelve conserved
motifs, of which CM7 is highly promiscuous and cannot
be used for identifying these proteins. ScanProsite analysis
suggested that seven of the twelve motifs are present in
glycosyltransferases, LPS and other glycosyl transferases.
Of these, CM1, CM1a, CM1b, CM2c, CM3, CM4e, CM5e,
CM10, CM10a, and CM10b were all found to be significant for identification of PIG-A proteins and their classification according to our PLSR analysis. However, CM1,
CM1a, and CM1b were found to be the most robust of all
variables in PLSR.

It may be pointed out that the motif (E/D) X7 (E/D) of
CM10gt (as well as CM10 and CM10ar) is considered a
characteristic of not only for PIG-A proteins and glycosyltransferases of GT4 family but also of α-mannosyltransferases [32]. Besides this, motifs, CM4gt, CM5gt, CM8gt,
CM9gt, and CM11gt, are also present in all members
belonging to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases. Thus,
it is evident that at least five motifs identified in PIG-A
have their origins in glycosyltransferases belonging to GT4
family derived from bacteria and archaeabacteria. These
motifs appear to have been modified, and additional conserved motifs such as CM6 appeared, as PIG-A evolved

and diverged away from glycosyltransferases and LPS proteins. The PLSR method failed to identify any of these
motifs as significant for classification of PIG-A proteins.
The CM6 motif, in particular, was found to be specific
only for eukaryotic PIG-A proteins by the ScanProsite
analysis. One possible explanation could be that some
evolutionary changes took place during the formation of
eukaryotic lineages and have been retained throughout
evolution. These changes may be important for adaptation of the protein to the organellar structure and, therefore, explains its lack of usefulness as a marker for
classification of PIG-A proteins as assessed by the PLSR
method.
Unlike glycosyltransferases of the GT4 family, β-Nacetylglucosamine transferases of the GT28 family, show
no similarity with PIG-A. Since GT4 and GT28 families,
and perhaps all glycosyltransferases have evolved from a
common ancestor involved in the cell wall synthesis of
the primitive organism [36] further development of this
primitive organism would have depended on the evolution of cell wall biogenesis enzymes. Therefore, a single
glycosyltransferase would have probably evolved into
many different classes of glycosyltransferases, each capable of a specific function.
The studies presented in this paper demonstrate that PIGA proteins possess characteristic motifs that can be used
for identifying PIG-A proteins from newly sequenced
genomes. Further, these studies lay the foundation for
site-directed mutagenesis and deletions experiments to
understand the function of PIG-A proteins in the GPI
anchor biosynthesis.

Conclusion
Using a motif discovery approach and ScanProsite analysis, we identified eleven conserved motifs that are present
in PIG-A proteins. A PLSR analysis suggests that the three
motifs, [STC]-D-F-F-[YFC]-P-X-X-G-G-[VI]-E-X-H-X-[YF],
D-[FTW]-[FHY]-[YFCP]-[PS]-X-X-[GD]-G-[VI] and [STC]D-F-F-[YFC]-P-X-X-G-G-[VI] are the most robust for identification of PIG-A proteins. Statistical as well as phylogenetic analysis further demonstrates that PIG-A proteins
evolved from glycosyltransferases. Additionally, our analysis suggests that PIG-A proteins from archaeabacteria and
primitive eukaryotes like G. lamblia, that have been identified using BLAST, are in reality closer to bacterial GT4
glycosyltransferases than to eukaryotic PIG-A proteins and
should be classified as such rather than as 'true' PIG-A proteins.

Methods
Sequence analysis of PIG-A
PIG-A sequence from Homo sapiens, Entamoeba histolytica,
Drosophila melanogaster, Dictyostelium discoidium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, Plasmodium falciparum, and Trypanosoma brucei were
obtained from the web site created by Eisenhaber et al.
[37].

To identify the PIG-A homologus sequence in Leishmania
major, we used the PIG-A sequence from Homo sapiens as
the query. BLAST analysis was done against the Leishmania
major gene database [38]. The sequence with the highest E
value (3e-110) was selected and was cross-verified by
BLAST analysis against the human genome.
Similarly, PIG-A from Giardia lamblia, Arabdiopsis thaliana,
Oryza sativa, Caenorhabditis elegans, Aeropyrum pernix and
Thermoplasma acidiphilum as well as other Archael genomes
were identified.
Sequence analysis was done using Jalview version 2.2. We
used MAFFT version 5 for ClustalW analysis. Gaps were
removed after ClustalW alignment. These aligned
sequences were then used for building phylogenetic trees.
Rooted tree was built using TreeTop program, available
from GeneBee Molecular Biology server [39], and
unrooted tree was built using Phylodendron [40].
Motifs were identified manually as well as by using PRATT
[41] and Gblocks software [28,29,42]. The motifs identified manually were represented in the Prosite format and
were used to search the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases
with match mode of greedy, overlaps, and "no includes".
The motifs were subsequently modified by deleting
sequences from the ends and subjected once more to database search (Scan Prosite) in order to determine the specificity of these motifs in identifying PIG-A sequences.

Statistical analysis using Partial Least Squares Regression
We assumed a linear model described in matrix notation
as y = Xβ + F where, X is a matrix of independent variables,
and y is some response variable to be predicted. β is the
PLS regression coefficient vector and F the residuals estimated with a desired loss function. For PLSR the aim is to
decompose X and y as:

X = SP’+ E
y = U Q ’+ F

Uncertainty estimates in β and variable selection
The approximate uncertainty variance of the PCR and PLS
regression coefficients b can be estimated by jack-knifing.

⎛ M

where S (N × K matrix) and U (N × 1 matrix) are X- and yscore matrices respectively, P (K × K matrix) and Q (K × K
matrix) are the corresponding loading matrices, E and F
are residual matrices and U is related to S according to the
inner relation:
U = SB + H

would chose AOpt from the lowest RMSEP value, but this
can lead to overfitting and an unnecessary high number of
components.

where
N = the number of samples
s2β = estimated uncertainty variance of individual regression coefficients, b

where B is matrix containing the regression coefficients
and H is a residual matrix.

β = the regression coefficient at the cross validated AOpt

Thus, y can be written as:

βm = the regression coefficient at the rank A using all
objects except the object(s) left out in cross validation segment m.

y = SBQ' + F*

(10)

It should be noted that y in this case is a {-1/1} variable
with -1 representing the 10 GT4 sample), and 1 representing the 43 PIG-A samples. Thus, zero is used as a threshold
value where the predicted values of samples below zero
are said to belong to the class -1 (GT4) and values above
zero are said to belong to class 1 (PIG-A). Thus, using a {1/1} labelling we can use PLSR as a method for discrimination analysis (DA) and PLSR used in this mode is often
labelled as PLS-DA.
For methods like PLSR, one of the important aspects is to
find the optimal number of PLS components (AOpt), preferably from a suitable validation method like cross validation (CV) or independent test set validation.
When CV is applied in regression, AOpt is determined
based on prediction of kept-out samples from the individual models. The root mean square error (RMSE) is an error
measure for how well the model performs, and is given by
the expression

RMSE = n =1

When representing estimation of future prediction error
this is called RMSEP. The notation RMSEPCV is used to
indicate the error of prediction estimated by cross validation. RMSEC is the fit from the calibration. Normally, one

components using all the N samples

The degrees of freedom used here is N. Another alternative
is to use the number of segments, M, when CV alternatives
other than full CV are applied. In this case M may also
replace N in equation (2).
On the basis of such jack-knife estimates of the uncertainty of the model parameters, useless or unreliable variables may be eliminated automatically, in order to
simplify the final model and making it more reliable. This
is done by significance tests, where a t-test is performed
for each element in β relative to the square root of its estimated uncertainty variance s2β, giving the significance
level for each parameter. This approach has been termed
as "JK-PLSR"[43].
Validation of the calibration model and the selected genes
The importance of proper validation is appropriately
addressed by Ambroise and McLachlan (2002) [44] as
well as Wood, Visscher, and Mengersen (2007) [45],
clearly showing the effects of selection bias during modelling and subsequent prediction. As per the recommendations made in the two articles sited above, we have used
external or two-level cross-validation for determining the
real predictive value of the selected motifs. We have
termed our procedure for external validation as double CV
(DCV), basically adding an extra or outer layer of validation on top of the normal CV procedure, hence the name
DCV.

We begin by randomly selecting q samples for each DCV
segment (for e.g. diving the data set in M non-overlapping
subsets of roughly equal size) taking care to include the
same number of samples (along with any replicates) from
each class in the DCV segments as in the original population. Begin with subset Mi, i = 1...u, Mi constitutes the
outer layer containing q samples; typically u = 10 representing 10-fold DCV. The remainder samples (representing the inner layer), Nj = N-q, are then used for building
the calibration model and variable selection, for example
using the regular k-fold CV. The motifs thus selected (from
the inner layer) are subsequently used to predict the q
samples in DCV segment, or the outer layer Mi.
The DCV procedure is repeated until all samples have
been included at-least once in the outer-layer. It should be
noted, that in contrast to the standard k-fold CV giving a
single model and a single set of selected variables, our procedure generates a total of i (here i = 10) sub-models giving prediction errors for both the inner and outer layer, as
well as i = 10 set of important variables from each of the
DCV segments. Results from the analysis can be presented
at two different levels: (1) average errors for all the inner
layers, the overall calibration error, reported with and
without variable selection and (2) average errors for the
outer layers (for the selected variables only), the overall
prediction error.
Comparing the results obtained at the two levels of validation outlined above, it should be noted that the overall
prediction error of 23% based on DCV is comparable to
the aggregate of prediction error of 21.6% for the inner
layer CV without any variable selection. However, the
inner layer CV with variable selection give a prediction
error of only 17%. Thus, showing the dangers of reporting
downwards-biased error rates if proper validation routines are not followed [45].
Finally, the important variables were extracted as a set of
motifs appearing in maximum number of the DCV segments varying from variables appearing in all the i = 10
DCV segments to at-least one single DCV segment. As a
rule of thumb, variables common in at least 50% of the
DCV segments are reported.
