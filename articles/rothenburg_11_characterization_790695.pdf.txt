Characterization of a ranavirus inhibitor of the
antiviral protein kinase PKR
Stefan Rothenburg1,2*, V Gregory Chinchar3, Thomas E Dever1

Abstract
Background: Ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are important pathogens of lower vertebrates. However, little is
known about how they circumvent the immune response of their hosts. Many ranaviruses contain a predicted
protein, designated vIF2a, which shows homology with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a. In analogy to
distantly related proteins found in poxviruses vIF2a might act as an inhibitor of the antiviral protein kinase PKR.
Results: We have characterized the function of vIF2a from Rana catesbeiana virus Z (RCV-Z). Multiple sequence
alignments and secondary structure prediction revealed homology of vIF2a with eIF2a throughout the S1-, helicaland C-terminal domains. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that vIF2a blocked the toxic effects of human
and zebrafish PKR in a heterologous yeast system. Rather than complementing eIF2a function, vIF2a acted in a
manner comparable to the vaccinia virus (VACV) K3L protein (K3), a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR. Both vIF2a
and K3 inhibited human PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, but not PKR autophosphorylation on Thr446. In
contrast the E3L protein (E3), another poxvirus inhibitor of PKR, inhibited both Thr446 and eIF2a Ser51
phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of eIF2a by zebrafish PKR was inhibited by vIF2a and E3, but not
by K3. Effective inhibition of PKR activity coincided with increased PKR expression levels, indicative of relieved
autoinhibition of PKR expression. Experiments with vIF2a deletion constructs, showed that both the N-terminal and
helical domains were sufficient for inhibition of PKR, whereas the C-terminal domain was dispensable.
Conclusions: Our results show that RCV-Z vIF2a is a functional inhibitor of human and zebrafish PKR, and
probably functions in similar fashion as VACV K3. This constitutes an important step in understanding the
interaction of ranaviruses and the host innate immune system.

Background
Infectious diseases have devastating ecological and economical impacts on fish, amphibian and reptile populations worldwide (reviewed in [1]). Despite those effects,
the precise pathogenesis of infectious diseases of
ectotherm vertebrates and the interaction with the
immune system of their respective hosts are mostly
poorly understood. Recently, marked progress has been
made in the characterization of the immune system of
lower vertebrates. This has been facilitated by concentrated focus on the cloning of pathogen-induced genes
and by accumulating sequence data from genome and
expressed sequence tag (EST) projects. Similarly,
increased information about the genomes of pathogens

of lower vertebrates is becoming available. However,
there are still large gaps in our knowledge, especially
concerning the interaction of ectothermic pathogens
with the host immune system.
Ranaviruses, which constitute a genus within the family
Iridoviridae, are important pathogens of ectotherms and
have been associated with massive die-offs of both wild
and farmed populations of fish, frogs and salamanders in
diverse areas of the world [2-5]. Ranaviruses are doublestranded DNA viruses with genomes ranging from 105 to
140 kb. Currently the genomes of seven ranaviruses have
been sequenced: Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV, accession no. NC_005832[6]); Frog virus 3 (FV3, accession
no. NC_005946[7]); Tiger frog virus (TFV, accession no.

hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV, accession no.
FJ433873 [12]). Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence
of two major clades among ranaviruses, one that included
GIV and SGIV, and another comprised of ATV, EHNV,
FV3, STIV and TFV. Interestingly, the latter clade could
be further subdivided with ATV and EHNV in one subclade, and FV3, STIV and TFV in the other. The diversity
of organisms (amphibians, fish and reptiles) infected by
viruses from this second clade, combined with short
branch lengths within its two subclades may indicate
recent host switches among ranaviruses [12]. However, it
should be noted that the host range of ranaviruses is
incompletely understood at this time.
The host immune system has evolved multiple ways to
fight virus infection and replication. One important arm
of the host immune response is the innate immune system, which recognizes molecular patterns present in
many pathogens and initiates antimicrobial responses
[13,14]. An important component of the host response
is the antiviral protein kinase PKR, which contains double-stranded (ds) RNA binding domains (RBD) and a
kinase domain. PKR is activated by dsRNA, which is
formed during infection by many RNA and DNA
viruses, and phosphorylates the a subunit of eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2 (reviewed in [15]). PKR is
inactive in its latent monomeric form. However, upon
binding dsRNA, two PKR molecules dimerize and
undergo autophosphorylation on residue Thr446 (for
human PKR) [16-18]. Activated PKR then phosphorylates eIF2a on Ser51, which subsequently acts as an
inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
eIF2B. As eIF2B normally exchanges GDP for GTP on
eIF2, a step necessary for successful translation initiation, eIF2a phosphorylation leads to a general inhibition
of translation initiation [19,20]. The function of mammalian PKR and its interaction with viruses has been
extensively characterized (reviewed in [15]). However,
PKR-like molecules in ectotherms eluded molecular
characterization until recently. PKR-like activity was first
described in fish cells [21,22]. This was followed by the
cloning and functional characterization of crucian carp
and zebrafish PKR-related genes, which contain Z-DNA
binding (Za) domains instead of the dsRBDs and were
hence named PKZ [23,24]. PKZ was subsequently
described in Atlantic salmon and the rare minnow
[25,26]. Recently, authentic PKR genes were described
and characterized in many ectotherm species including
zebrafish, pufferfish, Japanese flounder and two Xenopus
species [27,28]. Like mammalian PKR, both PKZ and
PKR are induced by immunostimulation [23,27,28]. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that a duplication of an
ancestral PKR-like gene in the fish lineage probably led
to the emergence of PKR and PKZ in a fish ancestor,
and might have helped to extend the spectrum of viral

nucleic acids that can be recognized [27]. Although
higher vertebrates lack PKZ genes, they contain a different Za-containing protein, termed ZBP1, which binds
Z-DNA and has been implicated in the recognition of
viral DNA and the induction of an antiviral response
[29-31].
In order to overcome the antiviral effects of PKR
many mammalian viruses encode inhibitors of PKR,
which block PKR activation or activity at different steps
during or following the activation process (reviewed in
[32]). Many poxviruses possess two PKR inhibitors,
which are designated E3 and K3 in vaccinia virus
(VACV) and are encoded by the E3L and K3L genes,
respectively. E3 binds to dsRNA and prevents activation
of PKR [33,34], whereas K3 encodes an S1 domain that
is homologous to the N-terminus of eIF2a and inhibits
activated PKR by binding to the kinase domain and acting as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR [18,35,36].
Interestingly, most ranaviruses encode a protein with
an S1 domain, which is related to the S1 domain of
eIF2a and K3 and is referred to as a viral homolog of
eIF2a or vIF2a. In contrast to K3, which only possesses
the S1 domain, vIF2a proteins contain a C-terminal
extension of between 165 to 190 amino acids, for which
no sequence homology to any other proteins was
described. It was previously speculated that vIF2a in
analogy to K3 might be an inhibitor of PKR and might
therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of
ranaviruses [37-39]. Herein, using a heterologous yeast
assay system, we describe the characterization of vIF2a
as an inhibitor of human and zebrafish PKR.

Results
We present three lines of evidence that the C-terminus of
vIF2a is actually homologous to the helical and parts of
the C-terminal domains of eIF2a. Firstly, we performed
PSI-BLAST searches with vIF2a from ATV and RCV-Z.
During the first iteration, sequence similarity for regions
spanning amino acids 5-118 of ATV-vIF2a with the S1
and helical domains eIF2a from multiple eukaryotes was
noted. During the second iteration, this region of similarity to eIF2a was extended to amino acid position 253 of
vIF2a. Secondly, multiple sequence alignments including
vIF2a from many ranaviruses and eIF2a from a diverse
set of eukaryotes showed conservation of amino acids
outside the S1 domain: 8 amino acids are 100% conserved among the sequences (Figure 1, red background;
Cys99, Glu118, Leu160, Ala177, Gly192, Ala199, Val220
and Gly253). Moreover, conservative amino acid differences are present at 22 positions outside the S1 domain
(Figure 1, green background). At many other positions,
amino acids that are identical to the ones found in vIF2a
are present in a subset of eIF2a sequences (Figure 1,
light blue background). While the multiple sequence

Figure 1 Multiple sequence alignment of vIF2a and eIF2a sequences. Multiple sequence alignment with the indicated sequences was
generated using MUSCLE [54]. The background of residues that are highly conserved between vIF2a and eIF2a are colored as follows: 100%
identity: red; identical or conservative substitutions: green; residues that are 100% conserved in all vIF2a sequences and found in some eIF2a
sequences: light blue. Secondary structure elements as reported for human eIF2a [41] are shown below the sequences: b-strand: red arrow; ahelix: blue box. Vertical arrows indicate boundaries between S1, helical, and C-terminal domains in eIF2a. Secondary structure elements that
were predicted for RCV-Z and ATV vIF2a using Porter are shown above the alignments [55]. Cysteines that form a disulfide bridge in the crystal
structure of human eIF2a are shown in bold and connected by lines. An asterisk marks the position of Ser 51, which is phosphorylated in eIF2a.

alignment reveals sequence homology between vIF2a and
eIF2a throughout the reading frame, sequence similarity
is highest within the S1 domain, with the highest levels
of sequence identity surrounding strands b4 and b5
(Val74 - Leu88 in vIF2a) as previously described [38,39].
Interestingly, in VACV K3 this region was previously
shown to be important for PKR inhibition [40]. Thirdly,

secondary structure prediction with ATV and RCV-Z
vIF2a resulted in predicted b-sheets and a-helices that
coincide very well with the solved structural features
observed in the NMR structure of human eIF2a [41].
These observations indicate that the middle and C-terminal parts of vIF2a are homologous to the helical and Cterminal domains, respectively, of eIF2a.

Yeast-based assays were previously employed to characterize PKR and its interaction with viral inhibitors
[34,40,42,43]. To test whether vIF2a can inhibit PKRmediated toxicity in yeast, we transformed a control
strain and a strain expressing human PKR under the
control of the galactose-regulated GAL-CYC1 hybrid
promoter with plasmids designed to express RCV-Z
vIF2a and VACV K3L also under control of the GALCYC1 promoter. When grown under inducing conditions (galactose medium), comparable growth was seen
in the control strain transformed with vector, K3L or
vIF2a, demonstrating that K3 and vIF2a had no effect
on yeast cell growth (Figure 2A). In contrast, induction
of PKR expression was toxic in the vector-transformed
yeast, whereas the toxicity was suppressed by co-expression of K3L or vIF2a (Figure 2B).
Based on the homology of vIF2a with eIF2a throughout the entire ORF we tested whether suppression of
PKR toxicity might be caused by the complementation
of eIF2a function by vIF2a. To this end, we transformed
a yeast strain that carries a temperature-sensitive mutant
of eIF2a (sui2-1) [44] with an empty vector, with a plasmid designed to express wild-type eIF2a (SUI2) under

the control of its native promoter, or with the plasmids
that express vIF2a or K3L under the control of the
galactose regulated GAL-CYC1 promoter. Yeast transformants were streaked on synthetic complete medium
containing galactose (SC-Gal) and incubated at different
temperatures. At permissive temperatures (27Â°C and
30Â°C) all transformants grew well (Figure 3). However,
when incubated at restrictive temperatures (33Â°C and
36Â°C), only wild type eIF2a was able to rescue growth

eIF2a (p919) under the control of its native promoter, or the vector
pEMBLyex4, were introduced into the temperature-sensitive eIF2a
(sui2-1, TD304-10B) mutant strain. The indicated transformants were
streaked on SC-Gal medium, where eIF2a expression was
maintained and the viral protein expression was induced, and
incubated at the indicated temperatures. Results shown are
representative of 4 independent transformants for each plasmid.

(Figure 3). It is important to note that under these
growth conditions vIF2a and K3L were able to suppress
PKR toxicity (data not shown), indicating that the viral
proteins are functional under these conditions. As
expression of neither vIF2a nor K3L suppressed the
growth defects of the sui2-1 mutant strain, we conclude
that vIF2a does not functionally substitute for eIF2a.
We next compared the effect of vIF2a on human and
zebrafish PKR with the effects of the two VACV PKR
inhibitors K3 and E3. In the control strain not expressing PKR, expression of K3L or vIF2a had no effect on
yeast cell growth, whereas expression of E3L induced a
slow growth phenotype as previously described [34]
(Figure 4A). The toxicity associated with expression of
human PKR was inhibited by co-expression of K3L,
vIF2a or E3L (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the toxicity
associated with expression of zebrafish PKR in yeast
was only inhibited by vIF2a or E3L, but not by K3L
(Figure 4C). Thus in accord with the virus host range
vIF2a, but not VACV K3L, may have evolved to inhibit
fish PKR. To assess the effectiveness of K3, E3, and
vIF2a to inhibit human and zebrafish PKR, matching
sets of strains expressing a particular inhibitor and
either no PKR, human PKR, or zebrafish PKR were
streaked on the same plate for comparison. Examining
the colony sizes of the transformants in the streaks
revealed that K3 did not fully inhibit human PKR (colonies of cells expressing human PKR plus K3L were
smaller than colonies expressing K3L and no PKR,
Additional file 1: Figure S1A). In contrast, vIF2a and E3
appeared to fully inhibit both human and zebrafish PKR
(Additional file 1: Figure S1B, C).
Suppression of PKR toxicity in yeast could be due to
impaired PKR expression or due to inhibition of eIF2a
phosphorylation. In order to examine eIF2a phosphorylation, yeast whole cell extracts were prepared by the
TCA method to prevent protein degradation and dephosphorylation, and Western blot analyses were performed
using phospho-specific antibodies directed against phospho-Ser51 in eIF2a. To normalize for protein loading,
the blot was then stripped and probed with anti-yeast
eIF2a antiserum. As shown in Figure 4D (next to bottom panel), induction of either human or zebrafish PKR
expression in the absence of a viral inhibitor led to high
levels of eIF2a phosphorylation. Co-expression of K3L,
vIF2a, or E3L greatly reduced eIF2a phosphorylation in
cells expressing human PKR (Figure 4D and Additional
file 2: Figure S2). Consistent with the growth assays,
vIF2a and E3, but not K3, inhibited eIF2a phosphorylation in yeast expressing zebrafish PKR. Next, PKR
expression levels were monitored using an anti-Flag tag
antibody. Expression levels of PKR were higher in the
presence of effective eIF2a phosphorylation inhibitors.
As observed previously PKR autoinhibits its own

Page 5 of 12

expression in yeast [34,40,45]. Presumably PKR phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to suppression of total protein synthesis including PKR expression. Accordingly,
inhibition of PKR by the viral inhibitors restores protein
synthesis and leads to higher PKR levels. Taken
together, the results of the PKR expression and eIF2a
phosphorylation studies demonstrate that vIF2a can
effectively inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation by human and
zebrafish PKR.
In the presence of effective eIF2a phosphorylation
inhibitors, PKR migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than in
the controls (Figure 4D, top panel, lanes 2-4 versus 1
and lanes 7-8 versus 5). This might have been caused by
inhibition of PKR autophosphorylation. To examine
PKR autophosphorylation, we probed the Western blots
with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes human
PKR phosphorylated on Thr446. High levels of Thr446
phosphorylation were detected in the absence of inhibitors and when either K3 or vIF2a were present. Thr446
phosphorylation was effectively inhibited in the presence
of E3 (Figure 4D, second panel, lanes 1-4). These results
indicate that K3 and vIF2a are unable to block Thr446
phosphorylation and are consistent with previous findings that K3 binding to PKR is dependent on Thr446
phosphorylation [18]. Presumably vIF2a, like K3, binds
to PKR following autophosphorylation on Thr446 and
blocks subsequent autophosphorylation events that lead
to altered mobility of PKR on SDS-PAGE. Zebrafish
PKR was not detected with the antibody directed against
Thr446-phosphorylated human PKR (Figure 4D, second
panel, lanes 5-8). This was expected because of the
strong sequence divergence between human and zebrafish PKR surrounding the phosphorylation site [27].
Finally, using yeast growth rate assays as described
above, vIF2a was found to inhibit, at least partially, both
Xenopus laevis PKR1 and zebrafish PKZ (data not
shown). However, precise determination of PKR1 and
PKZ sensitivity to vIF2a inhibition will depend on the
ability to obtain yeast strains expressing the appropriate
level of each kinase.
In order to test which domains of vIF2a are important
for PKR inhibition we tested various vIF2a deletion
mutants for their ability to inhibit PKR activity. Additionally, the C-terminus of RCV-Z vIF2a was extended
to match the length of ATV vIF2a (see Figure 1). For
the latter constructs, the 26 C-terminal amino acids
found in ATV vIF2a that are not in RCV-Z vIF2a due
to an early termination codon were appended to the
C-terminus of RCV-Z vIF2a (vIF2a+26C, Figure 5A).
None of the vIF2a constructs led to a growth defect in
the control strain not expressing PKR (Figure 5B). In a
zebrafish PKR-expressing strain, wild-type vIF2a, vIF2a
+26C, and vIF2aÎ59C (lacking the C-terminal 59 amino
acids) led to comparable inhibition of PKR toxicity

Figure 4 Sensitivity of human and zebrafish PKR to inhibition by vIF2a K3 and E3. Plasmids expressing VACV K3L (pC140), RCV-Z vIF2a
(pC3853), or VACV E3L (p2245) under the control of a yeast GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter, or the empty vector pEMBLyex4, were introduced into
isogenic yeast strains having either an empty vector (A, J673), a GAL-CYC1-human PKR construct (B, J983), or a GAL-CYC1-zebrafish PKR construct
(C, J944) integrated at the LEU2 locus. The indicated transformants were streaked on SC-Gal medium where expression of both PKR and the viral
proteins was induced, and incubated at 30Â°C for 4 days. Results shown are representative of 4 independent transformants for each plasmid. (D)
Transformants described in panels A-C were grown in liquid SC-Gal medium for 13 hours, then whole cell extracts were obtained from equal
numbers of cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the upper halves
of the blots were probed with phosphospecific antibodies against Thr446 in human PKR (second panel from top), then stripped and probed
with anti-Flag tag antibodies which detect Flag-tagged human and zebrafish PKR (top panel). The lower part of the blot was incubated with
phosphospecific antibodies against Ser51 in eIF2a (eIF2a-P; third panel from top), then stripped and probed with polyclonal antiserum against
total yeast eIF2a. Lane 9 contains protein extracts from the vector (pEMBLyex4) transformed control strain (J673, panel A). The ratios between
phosphorylated eIF2a and total eIF2a converted to percentages are shown below.

(Figure 5C, sectors 2-4 versus 1). In contrast, no PKR
suppression was observed when the helical domain
was partly (vIF2aÎ94C) or completely (vIF2 aÎ138C)
deleted or when the N-terminus was deleted (vIF2a
Î94N and vIF2 aÎ94N+26C) (Figure 5C, sectors 5-8).
Western analyses of eIF2a phosphorylation in the
strains expressing zebrafish PKR and the various vIF2a
mutants revealed that vIF2a, vIF2a+26C, vIF2a59C led
to strong and comparable inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation (Figure 5D, next to bottom panel, lanes 2-4).
Consistent with their inability to inhibit PKR toxicity in

yeast, high levels of eIF2a phosphorylation were
observed in strains expressing the other vIF2a mutants
(Figure 5D). As seen earlier, PKR was expressed at
higher levels and migrated faster on SDS-PAGE when
PKR toxicity and eIF2a phosphorylation were suppressed (Figure 5D, top panel). Western blot analyses
using antibodies against a C-terminal Myc-epitope tag
in the vIF2a constructs revealed detectable expression
for only vIF2a, vIF2a+26C, and vIF2a59C. Comparable
results were obtained in Western blot analyses of protein extracts from the control (-PKR) strain expressing

these same vIF2a mutants (data not shown), indicating
that both the S1 domain and the helical domain are
essential for vIF2a expression and/or stability.

Discussion
Ranaviruses are important pathogens of fish, amphibians
and reptiles (reviewed in [2]). However, little is known
about how they interact with the immune system of
their hosts. Herein we show that RCV-Z vIF2a, a homolog of eIF2a, is an effective inhibitor of PKR in a heterologous yeast assay system. PKR is an important antiviral
protein kinase that has been primarily studied in mammals (reviewed in [15]). PKR-related genes have recently
been identified in a variety of fish and amphibian species. Fish PKR genes are expressed at low levels constitutively, but they are highly induced after viral infection
and stimulation with the dsRNA analog poly(I:C), which
mimics viral infection [27,28]. It was recently shown
that PKR of the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was able to inhibit replication of Scophthalmus
maximus rhabdovirus [28]. To date, only PKR inhibitors
from mammalian viruses have been functionally characterized (reviewed in [32]). Moreover, the only well-characterized viral PKR inhibitors that directly target the
PKR kinase domain are the pseudosubstrates found in
many poxviruses and represented by VACV K3L, which
is homologous to the S1 domain of the PKR target
eIF2a [33,40,46,47]. It was speculated that the ranavirus
vIF2a protein, another eIF2a homolog, might inhibit
PKR of infected hosts [38,39]. A notable difference
between K3 and eIF2a is the presence of an extended
C-terminal domain in eIF2a. In addition to the C-terminal a/b domain, eIF2a consists of an N-terminal S1
domain and a central a-helical domain. The K3 protein
is homologous to the N-terminal domain in eIF2a. Like
K3, vIF2a shows moderate sequence identity to eIF2a
in the S1 domain. In this study we used PSI-BLAST
analyses, multiple sequence alignment and secondary
structure prediction to show that the C-terminal parts
of vIF2a are likewise homologous to the helical and Cterminal domains of eIF2a.
Functional analyses using deletion constructs of vIF2a
revealed that both the S1 and helical domains are sufficient for inhibition of PKR in yeast (Figure 5). Since the
presence of both domains was necessary for detectable
vIF2a expression, it appears possible that the domains
are important to stabilize each other. The crystal structure of human eIF2a showed that the S1 and helical
domains are connected by an intramolecular disulfide
bridge formed by cysteine residues 69 and 97 [48].
Interestingly, a cysteine corresponding to position 69 is
found in many Metazoa, including Chordata, Echinodermata, Cnidaria and Mollusca, but is missing in most
Arthropoda (except Ioxedes scapularis), in all fungi and

Page 8 of 12

plants sequences currently found in Genbank, and in all
poxviral K3L orthologs (Figure 1 and data not shown).
As cysteines corresponding to residues 69 and 97
in human eIF2a are found in all vIF2a sequences
(Figure 1), we speculate that formation of a disulfide
bridge between the two domains might be important for
the stability of vIF2a. Future in vitro kinase assays with
vIF2a constructs that are produced in a cell-free translation system might be suited to further investigate the
importance of the individual domains.
It is striking that eIF2a sequences and all known
vIF2a sequences display a high level of sequence
identity within their respective groups. The sequence
identity for eIF2a is between 92% and 100% among
vertebrates, while the sequence identity for vIF2a is
between 95% and 98% among ranaviruses. In contrast,
K3L orthologs are very diverse, some of which display
only around 30-40% sequence identity to each other
[49]. The high sequence conservation in eIF2a and
vIF2a indicates that eIF2a might be under purifying
(negative) selective pressure in order to maintain its primary sequence or, alternatively, that current ranaviruses
might have experienced bottlenecks in their recent evolution. Overall the S1 domains of vIF2a and K3 are
comparably distantly related to eIF2a.
Interestingly, some Ranaviruses do not encode functional vIF2a orthologs. GIV and SGIV do not contain
vIF2a orthologs, and truncated vIF2a genes lacking
regions of the N-terminal and the helical domains are
found in the completely sequenced FV3 strain and in
STIV [7,11]. As our studies indicate that the N-terminus
of vIF2a is essential for PKR inhibition, these complete
or partial deletions might lead to the attenuation of the
viruses. In accord with this notion FV3, which lacks
most of vIF2a, is much less pathogenic than RCV-Z in
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles
[39]. Alternatively the absence of predicted functional
vIF2a proteins in some ranaviruses suggests that, as in
vaccinia virus, a second PKR inhibitor may be present in
ranaviruses.
Western blot analyses showed that human PKR was
expressed at higher levels in yeast expressing the PKR
inhibitors vIF2a, K3L, or E3L, consistent with the
notion that the viral inhibitors suppress autoinhibition
of PKR expression. Moreover, PKR from cells expressing
viral inhibitors migrated faster on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the inhibitors might block PKR autophosphorylation. Thr446 is the only site in the human PKR kinase
domain that is stoichiometrically phosphorylated and
visible in the PKR crystal structure, where it is thought
to stabilize the active PKR conformation [18,50]. Once
activated, PKR can phosphorylate eIF2a as well as
autophosphorylate other residues in the kinase [17,34];
however the significance of the latter is not fully

Rothenburg et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/56

understood. Interestingly, only E3L was able to prevent
Thr446 phosphorylation. In cells expressing K3L or
vIF2a, Thr446 was phosphorylated to the level observed
in the absence of an inhibitor, whereas PKR mobility
was comparable to that in E3L transformed cells. A
likely explanation is that K3 and vIF2a bind after the
initial Thr446 autophosphorylation and block subsequent phosphorylation events. This is in agreement with
the finding that activated WT PKR, but not the PKRT446A mutant, was able to bind K3 [18].
Like human PKR, zebrafish PKR was inhibited by E3
and vIF2a. Moreover, as was seen for human PKR, zebrafish PKR from cells expressing the inhibitors migrated
faster on SDS-PAGE, indicative of blocked secondary
phosphorylation events. An interesting difference
between human and zebrafish PKR is that zebrafish PKR
was resistant to K3 inhibition in both the growth and
eIF2a phosphorylation assays. In accord with our previous studies on PKR inhibition by K3 [49], we propose
that K3L might have evolved to suppress PKR of the
natural poxvirus hosts and that zebrafish PKR is too different to be targeted with high efficiency. It is not clear
why vIF2a, which is found in amphibian and fish
viruses, can inhibit both human and zebrafish PKR, but
it is possible that vIF2a targets more conserved residues
in the PKR kinase domain than does K3. Previously we
showed that K3 exhibits species specificity for inhibition
of PKR. Whereas human PKR was only moderately
inhibited by VACV K3, mouse PKR was much more
sensitive [49]. This difference in sensitivity was attributed to residues that were subject to positive selection
during evolution. Interestingly, positive selection was
also observed in the kinase domains of fish and amphibian PKR and fish PKZ [49]. It will be interesting to
determine whether vIF2a also shows altered specificity
for PKR or the related PKZ of the species that are naturally infected with vIF2a-containing ranaviruses.

Conclusions
Overall, it appears that vIF2a and K3 inhibit PKR in a
similar fashion, by acting as pseudosubstrates and inhibiting PKR following kinase activation. As vIF2a does
not act as an eIF2a substitute, but instead inhibits PKR
function, the renaming of vIF2a might be considered.
We suggest changing the name from vIF2a to RIPR, the
acronym for Ranavirus Inhibitor of Protein kinase R.
Methods
Yeast strains and plasmids

Human (hs) and zebrafish (dr) PKR cDNAs containing
both N-terminal His6- and Flag tags were first cloned
into the yeast expression vector pYX113 (R&D systems)
under the control of a GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter [27].
Next, the two DNA fragments containing the GAL-CYC1

Page 9 of 12

promoter and a PKR cDNA were subcloned into the
LEU2 integrating vector pRS305, which was then directed
to integrate into the leu2 locus of the strain H2557
(MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1Î63 gcn2Î) generating the strains J983 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112
trp1Î63 gcn2Î <GAL-CYC1-hsPKR, LEU2 >) and J944
(MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1Î63 gcn2Î <GALCYC1-drPKR, LEU2 >). Construction of the control
strain J673 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1Î63
gcn2Î <LEU2 >) was described previously [51]. The temperature-sensitive eIF2a strain TD304-10B (MATa his4303 ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 sui2-1) is a derivative of the
previously described sui2-1 strain 117-8AR20 [44].
A DNA fragment encoding RCV-Z vIF2a [39] was
amplified by PCR using viral DNA as a template and primers C27 (5â- TAGGATCCAAAATGGCACACAACAGGTTTTAC-3â) and C28 (5â- TAAAGTCGACCGCC
GCCTCAGAGTCGCCGG-3â). The PCR product was
then subcloned between the BamH I and Sal I restrictions
sites of a modified version of the yeast expression vector
pEMBLyex4 that contains two Myc tags at the C-terminal
end of the multiple cloning site (pC3852) generating the
plasmid pC3853. The following primer combinations were
used for cloning of vIF2a mutant constructs: vIF2aÎ59C:
C27 plus C29 (5â- TAAAGTCGACCCGACCGACTCT
GTCGAGGC-3â); vIF2aÎ94C: C27 plus C30 (5â-TAAAGT
CGACTCTCAGGGCCCTCACGGTCTC-3â); vIF2aÎ
138C: C27 plus C31 (5â-TAAAGTCGACCTGATCGGCATTCAC GGC-3â); vIF2a+26C: C27 plus C32 (5â-TAA

GTACGAGTG-3â) plus C28; and vIF2aÎ94N+26C: C33
plus C32. The plasmid template for vIF2a+26C and
vIF2aÎ94N+26C was generated by fusion PCR using vector primer C23 (5â- CATATGGCATGCATGTGCTCTG3â) plus primer C21 (5â- GCCTTTACGACCTCTCGCA
CCTCAGACAGCACGGCGTGCAGTCCCCAGTAC
GCCGCCTCAGAGTCGCCG-3â) for the first PCR and
primer C22 (5â- GTGCGAGAGGTCGTAAAGGCTGC
CGGGGGAGGACTGTGCCCCTTTGTGTA AGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGC-3â) plus vector primer C24 (5âCGCTTCCGAAAATGCAACGC-3â) for the second PCR.
Following PCR purification, the two PCR products were
mixed and used as a template for PCR along with the
vector primers A46F (5â-ATTCTTTCCTTATACATTAGGTCC-3â) and A20R (5â-TGCTGCCACTCCTC
AATTGG-3â). Finally, the PCR products were cloned into
the BamHI and SalI sites of pEMBLyex4. All PCRs were
carried out using Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) and all
plasmids were sequenced to verify correct sequences.
Derivatives of pEMBLyex4 expressing VACV K3L (pC140)
and VACV E3L (p2245), as well as the low copy-number
SUI2, URA3 plasmid p919 were described previously
[34,40,52].

Yeast strains were transformed using the LiAcetate/
PEG transformation method. For each transformation,
four independent colonies were analyzed by streaking
on inducing medium, SC-Gal minus uracil (synthetic
complete medium containing 2% galactose and all
amino acids, but lacking uracil) and grown at 30Â°C if
not otherwise indicated.

zebrafish PKR construct (drPKR, J944) integrated at the LEU2 locus. The
indicated transformants were streaked on SC-Gal medium where
expression of both PKR and the viral proteins was induced, and
incubated at 30Â°C for 4 days. Results shown are representative of 4
independent transformants for each plasmid.
Additional file 2: Figure S2 Relative PKR-induced eIF2a
phosphorylation levels after expression of vIF2a, K3L or E3L. Using
data from Figure 4D and an independent experiment, the band
intensities of phosphorylated and total eIF2a obtained from Western
blots of TCA extracts of yeast cells expressing either human or zebrafish
PKR and transformed with an empty vector or plasmids expressing K3L,
vIF2a or E3L, as indicated, were measured using ImageJ. The ratios of
phosphorylated and total eIF2a bands were calculated. Standard
deviations from the two independent experiments are shown, and
significant differences, as calculated using a t-test and as compared to
the vector controls (p < 0.05), are shown. n. s. = non significant.

Protein expression and Western Blot analyses

Yeast transformants were grown to saturation in 2 ml of
SD medium. This starter culture was diluted 1:50 in 25
ml SD medium and grown to OD 600 = 0.6 and then
shifted to SC-Gal medium to induce expression. After
13 hours, ODs of the cultures were measured and carefully adjusted by dilution in water to obtain comparable
ODs and thus to lyse equivalent amounts of cells for
each sample. Whole-cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared
using the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method as
described previously [53] and then suspended in 200 Î¼l
1.5 Ã loading buffer with reducing agent (both Invitrogen) and neutralized by the addition of 100 Î¼l 1 M Tris
base. Samples (5 Î¼l) were fractionated on 10% Bis-Tris
gels (Invitrogen), run in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Upper
parts of the membranes were incubated with rabbit
phosphospecific anti-human PKR Thr446 antibodies
(21st Century Biochemicals) and then stripped and
probed with anti-D (Flag) tag antibody (Applied Biological Materials). Lower halves of the membranes were
incubated with an anti-Myc tag antibody (Applied Biological Materials), rabbit phosphospecific antibodies
directed against phosphorylated Ser51 of eIF2a (BioSource International), or rabbit polyclonal antiserum
against total yeast eIF2a Immune complexes were
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. Band
intensities were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ and ratios between phosphorylated eIF2a and total eIF2a were calculated.
Multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure
prediction

Multiple sequence alignments of all sequences shown in
Figure 1 plus all poxvirus K3L orthologs listed in [49]
were performed using MUSCLE [54]. Secondary structure predictions for RCV-Z and ATV vIF2a sequences
were performed using Porter [55].

expressing VACV K3L (A, pC140), RCV-Z vIF2a (B, pC3853), or VACV E3L
(C, p2245) under the control of a yeast GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter were
introduced into isogenic yeast strains having either an empty vector
(J673), a GAL-CYC1-human PKR construct (hsPKR, J983), or a GAL-CYC1-
