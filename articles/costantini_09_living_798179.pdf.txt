Abstract
Background: Ongoing lineage splitting within the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is
compatible with ecological speciation, the evolution of reproductive isolation by divergent natural
selection acting on two populations exploiting alternative resources. Divergence between two
molecular forms (M and S) identified by fixed differences in rDNA, and characterized by marked,
although incomplete, reproductive isolation is occurring in West and Central Africa. To elucidate
the role that ecology and geography play in speciation, we carried out a countrywide analysis of An.
gambiae M and S habitat requirements, and that of their chromosomal variants, across Burkina Faso.
Results: Maps of relative abundance by geostatistical interpolators produced a distinct pattern of
distribution: the M-form dominated in the northernmost arid zones, the S-form in the more humid
southern regions. Maps of habitat suitability, quantified by Ecological Niche Factor Analysis based
on 15 eco-geographical variables revealed less contrast among forms. M was peculiar as it occurred
proportionally more in habitat of marginal quality. Measures of ecological niche breadth and overlap
confirmed the mismatch between the fundamental and realized patterns of habitat occupation:
forms segregated more than expected from the extent of divergence of their environmental
envelope – a signature of niche expansion. Classification of chromosomal arm 2R karyotypes by
multilocus genetic clustering identified two clusters loosely corresponding to molecular forms, with

'mismatches' representing admixed individuals due to shared ancestral polymorphism and/or
residual hybridization. In multivariate ordination space, these karyotypes plotted in habitat of more
marginal quality compared to non-admixed, 'typical', karyotypes. The distribution of 'typical'
karyotypes along the main eco-climatic gradient followed a consistent pattern within and between
forms, indicating an adaptive role of inversions at this geographical scale.
Conclusion: Ecological segregation between M and S is consistent with niche expansion into
marginal habitats by chromosomal inversion variants during early lineage divergence; presumably,
this process is promoted by inter-karyotype competition in the higher-quality core habitat. We
propose that the appearance of favourable allelic combinations in other regions of suppressed
recombination (e.g. pericentromeric portions defining speciation islands in An. gambiae) fosters
development of reproductive isolation to protect linkage between separate chromosomal regions.

Background
Ecological diversification is responsible for the adaptive
radiation of several groups of organisms that are not separated geographically but segregate in alternative habitats
or ecological niches [1,2]. The evolutionary process by
which ecological diversification drives species formation,
known as ecological speciation, involves the establishment of barriers to gene flow through ecologically-based
divergent selection [3,4]. Interbreeding between populations that have ecologically diverged, by either niche specialization or invasion of a new niche, produces hybrid
individuals of lower fitness in each of the parental habitats. Ecological speciation theory predicts that reproductive isolation is environment-dependent, i.e. it is driven
by ecological selective forces such as resource competition
or predation, instead of genetic mechanisms producing
hybrid sterility or inviability. The strength of reproductive
isolation is correlated with the degree of ecological divergence, rather than time since lineage splitting. Convincing
evidence exists for the role of ecological speciation in
nature, across a disparate range of taxa from angiosperms
to insects and vertebrates [4-7].
Past and ongoing radiation of some members of the
Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) complex is considered to
reflect different stages of the ecological speciation process,
in particular with respect to divergence of the larval
aquatic habitat [8]. This complex of African mosquitoes
comprises seven recognized isomorphic species distinguished in most cases by fixed chromosomal paracentric
inversions, and often by different larval breeding habitats
[9,10]. The significance of the complex for evolutionary
biologists is compounded by its tremendous importance
for human health: this complex contains two of the most
important Afrotropical vectors of malaria, a pathology
that kills about two million children below the age of five
each year in sub-Saharan Africa alone [11]. The two main
culprits of this extremely efficient vectorial system are the
nominal species An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), and its sibling An. arabiensis, which occur in sympatry across much
of their geographical distribution [12]. Reproductive iso-

lation between An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis is
expressed both at the pre-zygotic and post-zygotic level.
Laboratory colonies of the two species can be induced to
mate and produce viable hybrid progeny, but males have
atrophied testes, hence only females are fertile [13]. In
nature, adult hybrids are found at an average frequency of
0.02–0.76% [8], and heterogamic matings are rare (our
own unpublished data). The occurrence of viable and fertile female hybrids can lead to introgression of genetic
material between the two species [14,15]. Despite this
semi-permeable nature of the species boundary [16], An.
gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis maintain many distinct
genetic and bionomical features and are taxonomically
considered good species under most species concepts.
Ongoing lineage splitting within the nominal species An.
gambiae s.s. (hereafter, An. gambiae) has led to the recognition of "molecular forms" M and S [17,18], which share
many characteristics compatible with ecological speciation. Despite the lack of reproductive isolation in captive
laboratory strains [19], a significant pre-mating barrier
(only 1% of natural inseminations are heterogamic) prevents extensive hybridization in natural populations [20].
The rarity of interbreeding can be explained at least in part
by the occurrence of mostly homogamous mating swarms
[21]. Hybrids are fully fertile and viable [22], and
although rarely found in natural populations [23] (and
our own data, see Results), they can account for the high
estimates of gene flow and the dearth of significant
genetic differentiation between forms inferred from
genome-wide scans of natural populations [24,25]. However, two small unlinked centromere-proximal regions of
the genome show high levels of divergence across West
and Central Africa where M and S populations occur in
sympatry [26-29]. The centromere-proximal location protects both regions from recombination in the face of gene
flow between M and S, but the patterns of sequence variation are not consistent with reduced recombination acting
alone [26,28]. Divergent natural selection aided by
reduced recombination in these regions is what nominates them as "speciation islands" that are expected to

harbour the genes responsible for emerging ecological
and reproductive divergence [28].
Despite compelling evidence for the existence of significant if incomplete reproductive isolation between the M
and S forms, the mechanistic basis for their reproductive
isolation remains completely unknown at both genetic
and ecological levels. Moreover, while the application of
high throughput genomic technologies has led to relatively rapid progress in locating regions of major genetic
distinction between M and S forms, comparable amounts
of ecological evidence concerning the sources of divergent
selection have not been forthcoming. In the arid savannas
of Mali and Burkina Faso in West Africa, evidence collected prior to the recognition of the M and S molecular
forms supported some degree of spatial and temporal segregation between taxonomic units known as "chromosomal forms" [30-32]. The chromosomal forms, defined
based on configurations of shared polymorphic chromosomal inversions, correspond imperfectly or not at all
with the An. gambiae molecular forms [17,33], now considered to be the relevant taxonomic units. Accordingly,
much of the bionomics of An. gambiae ecotypes needs to
be revisited in the context of molecular forms. In much of
West and Central Africa, the M and S forms occur in the
same villages, sharing the same resources such as hosts,
adult resting sites, and freshwater larval breeding sites. At
a microgeographic scale, the aquatic larvae of An. gambiae
and An. arabiensis, and of the two molecular forms of An.
gambiae, have been found at times to segregate in different
breeding sites [23,34,35], though the ecological factors
modulating larval niche partitioning remain unclear [36].
Habitat segregation of larvae of the two molecular forms
has sometimes been associated with the nature of the
breeding site. In Burkina Faso, larvae of the M form are
more prevalent in larger anthropogenic longer-lasting
habitats such as artificial lakes and rice fields, whereas the
S form predominates in rain-dependent smaller ephemeral habitats such as puddles and road ruts [37,38]. Habitat-dependent fitness traits have been attributed to larval
predation and inter-form competition [39,40].
Spatial scale is an important ecological factor structuring
communities and populations [e.g. [41,42]]. Because
geography has an impact not only on the likelihood of
gene flow but also on the ecological sources of divergent
selection [4], habitat segregation between M and S should
be studied also at larger spatial scales. Across the African
continent, knowledge of the geographical distribution of
the molecular forms is sparse. della Torre and colleagues
reviewed existing data on the occurrence and chromosomal make-up of molecular forms across Africa and its
offshore islands, and showed that both are present in all
major biomes and geographic areas, except for the
absence of M east of the Rift Valley [33] (although there is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

a single record of the presence of the M form east of the
Rift Valley based on a few individuals collected in Zimbabwe [43]). However, a higher-resolution, systematic analysis of the distribution and relative abundance of M and S
over large spatial ranges is still lacking: are the two molecular forms equally abundant across major eco-climatic
regions, or do they segregate at this eco-geographical
scale? How does the present geographical distribution
relate to the ecological factors driving the speciation process? Can we expect hybridization and gene flow between
M and S to be frequency-dependent across their range, in
accordance with their geographic distribution?
According to the general tenets of ecological speciation,
several predictions can be put forward concerning the ecological divergence of the siblings and incipient species of
the An. gambiae complex. First, it can be predicted that in
the course of their radiation all the three taxa should have
diverged ecologically to some extent. Second, from the
positive association between the strength of ecological
divergence and reproductive isolation found in other taxa,
it is expected that the ecological niche of the two molecular forms of An. gambiae should have diverged less than
that of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis. Third, since the
molecular forms of An. gambiae represent a more recent
realization of an ongoing speciation process, with the Mform likely being most recently derived [8,10], we predict
that the M-form should occur in more marginal habitats
than the other two taxa, in accordance with a process of
niche expansion from the original, optimal habitat [[44],
for an example, see [45]].
In this and the companion paper by Simard and colleagues [46], we present the results of two countrywide
surveys of An. gambiae M, S and An. arabiensis carried out
in Burkina Faso (West Africa) and Cameroon (Central
Africa) designed to test these predictions with a biogeographic approach [47] based on ecological niche modelling [48,49]. The patterns emerging from these studies
help elucidate the role that ecology and geography play in
ongoing speciation between the molecular forms of An.
gambiae. Specifically, we asked the following five questions: (i) do the three cryptic taxa segregate ecologically at
a countrywide spatial range, and to what extent does their
habitat overlap? (ii) what eco-geographical predictors
characterize the fundamental ecological niche of the three
taxa, and which key ecological factors discriminate among
them? (iii) does the extent of habitat segregation correlate
positively with the degree of reproductive isolation? (iv)
does the M form occur in more marginal habitats than the
S form? (v) do chromosomal inversions play a role in the
ecological segregation of the molecular forms of An. gambiae? To answer these questions, we implemented an
empirical approach to distribution modelling using two
spatially explicit statistical methods. First, to identify the

ecological forces at work in the speciation process, we performed an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis [50] to infer
both the eco-geographical factors delimiting the fundamental ecological niche of a focal species and the potential habitat suitability across the entire study area. Second,
to explore the extent of realized geographical segregation
and habitat overlap, we employed geostatistical methods
to construct kriged surfaces of the relative abundance of
the three cryptic taxa. By comparing the extent of realized
versus potential occurrence and abundance of the three
taxa in relation to predicted habitat quality, we tested
whether the distribution of M (the most recent taxon) is
consistent with a process of niche expansion into a habitat
of marginal quality. Finally, we compared the degree of
association between chromosomal variants and environmental predictors by multivariate ordination techniques
to characterize the ecological niche of the different karyotypes observed in our study area, and verify whether chromosomal inversions play a role in the ecological
segregation of the molecular taxa of An. gambiae.
The parallel approach in Burkina Faso and Cameroon was
prompted by the dramatic distinctions between these
countries, both in the extent of eco-geographical diversity
and the level of chromosomal inversion polymorphism
observed in the molecular taxa: Cameroon covers a wide
range of biomes including the equatorial rainforest, and
the mesic to xeric savannas of Central Africa, while
Burkina Faso lies in the arid Sudanese savanna belt of
West Africa. Chromosomally, the forest populations are
largely monomorphic standard, whereas savanna populations are highly polymorphic [18,51-54]. We expected
that this comparative approach would be revealing about
the forces driving ecological speciation, in light of the
long-hypothesized relationship between chromosomal
inversions, ecological adaptation, and speciation in An.
gambiae. In this paper we present the results of the Burkina
Faso survey; those of the Cameroon survey are presented
in the companion paper [46].

Methods
Study area and sampling plan
A countrywide survey in Burkina Faso was performed
across an area spanning LAT 9°45'N–14°40'N and LONG
5°30'W–1°45'E (Figure 1). In Burkina Faso, annual rainfall and the duration of the rainy season vary following a
latitudinal gradient: in the northernmost regions, rainfall
does not exceed 300 mm during 2–3 months; in the
southernmost regions rainfall can be as high as 1200 mm
during 4–5 months. Population size and relative frequencies of An. arabiensis and molecular forms of An. gambiae
vary seasonally according to the distribution of rains [38].
To maximise the chance of sampling all three taxa from
each location across the country, the mosquito survey
began in the north at the peak of the rainy season (2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

August) and continued until the end of the rainy season
in the south (26 October).
A stratified random sampling scheme was adopted with
the objective of selecting sites (villages) that were representative of the eco-geographical diversity of Burkina Faso
and also accessible during the rainy season. This was
achieved by defining three transects covering the full
diversity of eco-climatic regions and landscapes present in
the country, following the major network of roads. In
total, three hundred villages were chosen for sampling
(additional file 1) from the national topographic database
(Banque Nationale des Données Topographiques – BNDT) of
the Institute of Geography of Burkina Faso (Institut Géographique du Burkina – IGB), an electronic georeferenced
database of all populated places published in 2005 by
IGB. These villages were chosen at random, based on a
grid of 5 × 5 km cells superimposed on other topographical layers in a geographical information system (GIS). For
each transect, a buffer zone of 15 km on each side was
selected and a number of cells proportional to the length
of each transect was randomly chosen. One village per cell
was then selected at random from the list of villages available within the chosen cells.
Entomological survey
Freshly-fed female An. gambiae s.l. were collected in the
morning while resting inside human dwellings by manual
aspiration with the aid of electrical aspirators. Mosquitoes
were kept in small cages wrapped in wet towels and stored
inside cool boxes. Additionally, indoor insecticide spacesprays were carried out in the early afternoon. Collected
mosquitoes were morphologically identified in the field
under a dissecting microscope. Ovaries of An. gambiae s.l.
females at the appropriate stage for polytene chromosome
analysis were immediately cropped and placed in a fixative agent (Carnoy solution, 1:3 glacial acetic acid:absolute ethanol) contained within individual 1.5-mL reaction
microtubes labelled with a unique serial number. The
remaining carcass was placed in an identically numbered
individual 1.5-mL microtube containing a desiccant (silica gel). Ovaries were stored at -20°C, and carcasses maintained at ambient temperature before further processing.
Mosquito DNA was extracted from the carcass and identified to species and molecular form using rDNA-based
PCR assays [55,56]. The corresponding ovaries were prepared for karyotype analysis according to standard procedures [57]. The banding pattern was observed under a
phase-contrast microscope (400×) and interpreted with
reference to the chromosomal map and nomenclature of
Coluzzi and colleagues [9,10].

Geostatistical interpolators were used to construct surfaces of the distribution and relative abundance of mem-

bers of the An. gambiae s.l. complex at unsampled
locations. Two response variables were modelled: (i) the
relative frequency of An. arabiensis vs. An. gambiae s.s. and
(ii) the relative frequency of molecular form M vs. S. Spatial modelling was performed in the Geostatistics module
of ArcGIS® v. 8.3 (ESRI, 2002; http://www.esri.com) by fitting an anisotropic spherical function of the arcsine-transformed response variable to the semivariogram.
Interpolation was then carried out by universal kriging.
Association analysis
To investigate patterns of co-occurrence among taxa at the
countrywide level, we calculated the degree of similarity
in the occurrence of species pairs across locations by the V
association coefficient [58]. This index is based on the frequency of joint presences and absences by two species in
a two-by-two contingency table. The coefficient ranges
from -1 to +1, the sign of the coefficient denoting whether
the species co-occur more (positive sign) or less (negative
sign) than expected at random (V = 0) under given species
frequencies. The index is called the point correlation coefficient, because it is equal to the Pearson correlation coefficient between two species when the values of one and
zero are used to denote their presence or absence, respectively. To assess the statistical significance of the index
(null hypothesis: V = 0), we calculated 95% confidence
intervals by bootstrapping the V values by location over
5,000 replicates.
Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA)
Static species distribution models (SDM) make predictions about the probability of occurrence and geographical distribution of a focal species by extrapolating to a
larger spatial extent the association between the environment and the focal species found at a certain number of
sample locations [48]. The ENFA is a multivariate SDM
technique based on the concept of ecological niche as a ndimensional hypervolume in a hyperspace of n resource
axes [50,59]. The ENFA extracts n uncorrelated factors,
constructed as linear combinations of the n resource axes,
explaining the major part of the environmental distribution of a focal species. The first factor is the marginality,
describing how far is the optimum for the focal species
from the mean environmental profile of a reference set (in
our case, the whole of Burkina Faso). A global marginality
value ≥1 means that the species lives in a particular habitat
relative to the distribution of habitats available in the reference set. The second and subsequent factors represent
the specialization (S) or tolerance (1/S) factors. They are
sorted in decreasing amounts of explained variance, and
describe how specialized is the focal species with respect
to the range of environments available in the study area.
A randomly chosen set of cells is expected to have a global
specialization value of one, with values >1 indicating
some form of specialization. A univariate interpretation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

the ENFA, and a detailed description of its principles and
operation are given in [50]. The strength of the ENFA is
that it uses only the presence data of a focal species. In distinction to alternative SDM techniques, absence from a
location is considered uninformative rather than indicative of habitat unsuitability.
Our study area was rasterized in spatial units of 1-km isometric cells. The entomological data and the eco-geographical variables characterizing the environment were
related to each spatial unit and entered into a GIS database in ArcGIS® v. 8.3. After performing the ENFA, a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), ranging continuously from
zero to one, was calculated for each cell with the software
Biomapper v.4.0 http://www.unil.ch/biomapper[60].
Then, following Hirzel and colleagues [61], habitat suitability (HS) maps were plotted using four classes of habitat
suitability that were defined from the predicted-toexpected (P/E) ratio of habitat suitability based on the
continuous Boyce index evaluator statistic [62]: (1) unsuitable habitat, where no presence of the focal species is predicted (P/E = 0, allowing for the upper 95% confidence
limit); (2) marginal habitat, where presence is predicted at
a frequency less than expected by chance alone (P/E ≤ 1);
(3) suitable habitat, where presence is predicted at a frequency higher than expected by chance alone; and (4)
optimal habitat, separated from suitable habitat by the
steep rate of change of the P/E ratio at the higher end of
the spectrum of habitat suitability.
Eco-geographical predictors
We selected fifteen eco-geographical variables (EGV),
belonging to three classes: climate (4 variables), topography (6 variables), and land use (5 variables) (Table 1).
The climatic variables were retrieved from the meteorological database of the network of weather stations of
Burkina Faso managed by the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA). Topographic and land use variables were extracted from the
BNDT. The quantitative climatic variables and three topographic variables (altitude, aspect, and slope) were postprocessed to extrapolate the mean value of each spatial
unit cell by interpolation and rasterization. Most EGVs
were normalized according to the Box-Cox algorithm
prior to analysis. The Boolean variables classifying the
occupancy of soil of individual cells by categories of land
use were post-processed to render them quantitative: a
buffer zone of 5 km radius around the focal cell was
drawn and the relative frequency of 1 × 1 km cells within
the buffer zone belonging to the category of land use
under consideration was calculated. The frequency was
then normalized by the arcsine transformation prior to
analysis. The size of the buffer zone was guided by the
average dispersal distance that can be covered by An. gambiae complex mosquitoes in our study area [63]. Quanti-

Characteristics of the environmental descriptors used in the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis.

tative information was extracted from the three vectorial
geographical features (populated places: points; transportation network: polylines; and hydrologic network: polygons), by calculating the minimum distance from the
focal cell to each of these features.
Evaluation of Habitat Suitability models
Accuracy and robustness of the habitat suitability models
was assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure
implemented in Biomapper. We used the mean and standard deviation as measures of, respectively, central tendency (assessing model accuracy) and dispersion
(assessing model robustness) of evaluator statistics. Evaluator statistics of presence-only SDMs like the ENFA are
the absolute validation index (AVI), the contrast validation index (CVI), and the continuous Boyce index [61].
The AVI is calculated as the proportion of presence points
falling in cells having a threshold habitat suitability index
(in our case, HSI = 0.5). The CVI is the AVI minus the AVI
of a random model, i.e. one that predicts presence everywhere. Both statistics suffer from the choice of an arbitrary
threshold. To overcome this limitation, the continuous
Boyce index Bcont(20) is calculated as the Spearman correlation coefficient between the ratio of the predicted over
expected frequency of evaluation points, iterated across
the range of HSI values over a sliding window of 20 HSI
units, and the habitat suitability index. Further details
about the calculation, use, and properties of the Boyce
index, are given in [61,62] and the companion paper of
Simard et al. [46].

To compare patterns of similarity, breadth, and overlap of
the fundamental and realized ecological niches of each
taxon, we adopted two approaches. First, a multivariate
discriminant analysis was performed to isolate the envi-

ronmental ordination axis along which each pair of
forms/species was maximally differentiated. Statistics of
niche overlap and related measures (derived from [64])
were then calculated on this factor, as in [65]. This analysis was performed in Biomapper v.4.0. In addition, the
same statistics were calculated from the dataset of location
samples.
Chromosomal polymorphism and population structure
We implemented a Bayesian multilocus genetic clustering
approach using the software STRUCTURE v.2.2 [66-68].
STRUCTURE calculates an estimate of Ln [Pr(X|K)], representing the probability of obtaining the observed genetic
data X conditional on the presence of K populations (i.e.
"clusters"), with K unknown a priori. We adopted the
"admixture" model, as its assumption of correlated allele
frequencies between populations conformed best to our
biological system, given residual gene flow between
molecular forms and linkage between some chromosomal inversions. A series of five independent runs were
performed for each K from 1 to 10, setting 40,000 and
500,000 as burn-in and run numbers (measures of the
length of the MCMC algorithm). The probability of each
individual to belong to one of the K populations was plotted for the most likely value of K. The analyses were at first
performed without prior assignment of individuals to
molecular or chromosomal form to verify the degree of
consistency in the classification of karyotypes by the three
different approaches/markers. The analyses were then
repeated with prior assignment of karyotypes to molecular form to assess the probability of admixture of each
individual.

For the purpose of analysis, inverted and standard
arrangements were treated as alternative alleles of a biallelic locus. However, because the 2Rd and 2Ru inver-

sions overlap, we considered that they constituted a threeallelic locus. Moreover, some inversions have closely
linked breakpoints producing extreme cases of linkage
disequilibrium; thus, we repeated the analysis by grouping inversions in four 'inversion systems': 2Rj/+, 2Rb/bc/+,
2Rd/u/+ and 2La/+. Results of the two analytical
approaches were concordant; here we present only those
of the former approach.
Ecological niche of chromosomal variants
The association between inversion polymorphism and
environmental variables in each molecular form at each
sampled location was investigated by multivariate ordination with the software CANOCO v. 4.5 [69]. The karyotypes recorded at each sampled location were plotted in
ordination space by detrended correspondence analysis
(DCA), with environmental variables passively plotted to
interpret the general relationship between karyotypes and
EGVs. This analytical procedure does not take into
account the geographical structure of the data, hence
results depend upon the underlying spatial and temporal
distribution of the EGVs.

To extract eco-geographical predictors to be used in the
DCA, raster maps of the transformed EGVs used for the
ENFA were translated into vector format and overlaid on
a layer containing the sampled locations in ArcGIS v.8.3.
The value of each EGV at every sampled location was
extracted and saved in a separate layer. All layers were subsequently collapsed in a single table containing information relative to all the EGVs for each sampled location.
Several additional EGVs extracted from the BNDT were
included in this analysis: (i) the distance from major
water bodies, including large artificial or natural water reservoirs (lakes), areas of extensive rice cultivation, and
areas amenable to flooding; (ii) the vegetation zone as
defined by landscape-level physiognomic and floristic
associations (see additional file 2). The four main zones
present in Burkina Faso, i.e. northern Sahelian, southern
Sahelian, northern Sudanese, and southern Sudanese, typically characterize a cline from more to less xeric habitats,
respectively; (iii) the habitat suitability for either M or S
classified as Optimal, Suitable, Marginal, or Unsuitable
(see above); (iv) the relative frequency of 'competitors' for
a focal taxon (i.e. the other An. gambiae s.l. taxa).
In the tabular input for CANOCO analyses, "samples"
were the individual locations, and "species" were the individual karyotypes recorded on the 2R chromosomal arm
of each molecular form. The karyotype at chromosomal
arm 2R of each individual was scored as a series of five digits, after [31]. Each digit represented one of five polymorphic inversions common in our study area (2Rj-2Rb-2Rc2Rd-2Ru), and could assume a value of "0", "1" or "2".

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

The value "0" indicated the standard homokaryotype, "1"
the heterokaryotype, and "2" the inverted homokaryotype
with respect to each inversion. Inversion 2La on the left
arm of chromosome 2 was not considered in the analyses
because it was nearly fixed (frequency ≥0.95) across the
study area. Due to the limited number of specimens collected in each sampled location, the "species" table contained many zero values. To avoid biases due to the
sparseness of the table, we implemented a square root
transformation and downweighted rare 'species' (i.e. karyotypes) by assigning a weight to each karyotype prior to
analysis.

Results
Mosquito identification
Collections in most villages yielded our target of twenty
dissected female An. gambiae s.l.(inter-quartile range 16–
23; cf. additional file 1). Overall, 4,896 specimens were
molecularly identified out of 5,056 that were processed.
Of the identified specimens, most were An. gambiae
molecular form S (49.2%), followed by the M form
(28.9%) and An. arabiensis (20.9%). We found one An.
gambiae-An. arabiensis hybrid, and 46 M-S hybrids, representing 0.02% and 0.94%, respectively, of all identified
specimens. Unless indicated otherwise, the hybrids were
omitted from further analyses.
Geographical distribution
The relative frequency of the three taxa across the sampled
locations is presented in Figure 1. The distribution of M
and S followed a clear geographical pattern: the M form
dominated in the northernmost arid zones; the S form
was generally most abundant in the moister southern
regions. An. arabiensis was more prevalent in the northwest and in the central plateau – between 11°30'N and
13°30'N – decreasing in abundance when moving away
from this area.

The interpolated relative frequencies of An. arabiensis vs.
An. gambiae (both forms combined) and M vs. S form (Figure 2) quantified the patterns observed in Figure 1. In contrast to expectation based on its continental distribution,
An. arabiensis was not most abundant in the arid sahelian
savanna in the north. Rather, this species did not predominate in any region, except perhaps for a small patch (3%
of the total study area) in the north-west around the town
of Ouahigouya (Figure 2A). Perhaps even more interestingly, this species remained at intermediate levels of relative abundance across much of the central and southern
region occupied largely by the catch basin of the river
Nakambé (formerly the White Volta). This is the most
densely populated area in Burkina Faso, where anthropogenic modifications and population pressure on the natural environment are at their highest.

The two molecular forms were distributed according to
opposite latitudinal clines (Figure 2B), with M dominating (relative frequency ≥70%) in the north (representing
29% of the total surface), and S in the south (50% of the
total surface). The reversal in frequency between the two
forms was rather abrupt between 12°N and 13°N latitude
(21% of the total surface), with the exception of an area of
approx. 50 km radius between the towns of Koudougou
(12°15'43"N 2°22'24"W) and Yako (12°57'33"N
2°16'03"W). Although the two forms actually co-existed
in sympatry across most, if not all, of the study area, the
rather steep transition of relative abundance was not
matched by equally steep changes of environmental features across the 'boundary' (maps of EGVs not shown),
suggesting that this distribution pattern may have resulted
not only from the underlying response of the two molecular forms to the environment, but also from, at least to
some degree, spatial dependence and aggregative dynamics due to biological processes such as competitive interactions between forms, predation, or dispersal – among
others [70].
Association analysis
The similarity of distribution of the three taxa among the
samples was investigated by the point correlation coefficient V, which measures the degree of species association
based on presence/absence. It is generally assumed that
similarity in species occurrence among samples reflects
similarity in their overall ecological behaviour [58]. However, as measures of species association depend upon the
chosen set of samples [58], we performed three distinct
analyses to explore the role of geographical scale and ecological conditions on the degree of association and similarity. First, we used the whole data set of samples from
the entire study area to investigate the macroecological
pattern of species occurrence that was examined previously biogeographically using geostatistical interpolators.
Then, because of the gross latitudinal pattern in species
distribution (Figures 1 and 2), we stratified the analysis in
a northern (LAT>12°30'N), and a southern
(LAT<12°30'N) stratum, whose boundary corresponds

approximately to the reversal in molecular forms relative
abundance (Figure 2).
The analysis of the whole data set confirmed the pattern
that could be inferred from the maps of species distribution and abundance in Figure 2: Anopheles arabiensis and
An. gambiae M were positively associated, whereas both
these taxa were negatively associated with An. gambiae S
("Total" row in Table 2), indicating that the two molecular forms of An. gambiae were overall ecologically more
dissimilar than the M form and An. arabiensis. The southern stratum association analysis conformed exactly to the
same pattern (Table 2). Conversely, in the northern stratum the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of the point
correlation coefficient overlapped V = 0 in two cases out
of three, suggesting that in this area An. gambiae S occurred
independently of the other two taxa (Table 2). A weak,
and possibly statistically significant, negative association
between An. gambiae M and An. arabiensis was detected in
this region (Table 2). The fact that An. gambiae M and An.
arabiensis co-occurred less than expected under a null
model where they were most abundant, and were associated more than expected where they were least abundant
suggests that they have more similar ecologies (e.g. adaptation to more xeric conditions), so that they occur in the
same habitats where they presumably engage in frequency-dependent competitive interactions. Conversely,
the fact that An. gambiae S was significantly less associated
than expected where it was the most abundant, and it was
distributed independently of the other taxa where it was
the least abundant, suggests that it is the strongest competitor of the three taxa.
Ecological Niche Factor Analysis
Sample size is the most critical parameter when choosing
a sampling strategy optimized to return accurate predictions by the ENFA [71]. Our analysis was based on a variable number of presence data points out of 300 sampled
locations depending on each taxon: 238 for An. arabiensis,
234 for the M form, and 251 for the S form; in all cases our
sample size approximated values returning robust results

in simulations using virtual scenarios [71-73]. The global
marginality, specialisation, and tolerance indices did not
differ among the three taxa, but the indices indicated that
their ecological requirements were rather marginal and
specialized with respect to the global distribution of the
EGV values in our reference set, i.e. that defined by the
environmental conditions encountered across the whole
of Burkina Faso (Additional file 3). This is not uncommon
when the reference set is constituted by large spatial
extents such as whole countries, given that the degree of
ecological specialization is generally directly proportional
to the diversity of conditions accounted for by the reference set.
The two EGVs having by far the greatest impact upon the
marginality factor of all the three taxa were distance from
populated places and distance from roads (the topographic POPPL and ROAD predictors; cf. Table 1 and
Additional files 4, 5 and 6). As these variables are related
to the density of the human population and of roads,
hence to the impact of anthropogenic modifications on
the environment, this result is perhaps not surprising considering the high degree of anthropophily (sensu Besansky
et al. [74]) generally expressed by An. gambiae and An. arabiensis in West Africa. Moreover, during the rainy season,
unpaved roads are favourable to the occurrence of suitable
larval breeding sites, and may favour the dispersal of mosquitoes by passive transport. Similarly, the EGV with the
third highest positive load on the marginality factor for all
species/forms was the frequency in each spatial unit of
land exploited for farming annual crops (land use predictor CROP, cf. Table 1 and Additional files 4, 5 and 6),
which is again a variable related to the degree of land
occupancy and exploitation by humans.
The remaining four categories of land use differentiated
An. arabiensis and the M form from the S form (Additional files 4, 5 and 6). Somewhat surprisingly, climatic
EGVs were comparatively less influential than other
classes of predictors. Only in the case of the S form did
three out of four climatic EGVs have moderate coefficients
on the marginality factor: this taxon preferred habitats
with higher than average rainfall, and lower than average
solar radiation and evapotranspiration, in agreement with
its higher prevalence in the more humid savannas of the
south. Conversely, An. arabiensis was positively associated with higher mean annual temperatures, consistent
with its higher prevalence in the more arid savannas of the
north. Only the S form was slightly associated with higher
locations (EGV ALT), although it must be noted that the
altitude range in Burkina Faso is limited, and this association probably resulted mostly from a correlation between
the S southern distribution and the geographical localiza-

tion of more mountainous regions in Burkina Faso (Figure 1).
The first specialization factor (Factor 2) of the ENFA,
expresses the degree of tolerance of a species to occur in
regions departing from the optimal habitat. The higher
the factor load (in absolute value), the lower the ability of
a species to cope with less-than-optimal environmental
conditions. The minimum distance from roads and the
frequency of croplands (ROAD and CROP predictors) had
the highest coefficients for all three species/forms. This
result, considered in the context of the disappearance of
the POPPL predictor from this set, suggests that the
impact of the human population on the ecological niche
of these taxa is expressed mainly on rural habitats, presumably through the action of occupation and clearance
of the savanna for agricultural purposes. In several
instances, the specialization coefficient was moderately
high for an environmental predictor of weak marginality
(e.g. OPEN and FARM for An. arabiensis, RAIN and SUN
for the M form, and SHRUB for the S form). This result is
interpreted as the lack of tolerance of the focal species for
the more extreme conditions expressed by that EGV, even
if the optimum of the species coincides with the distribution of the EGV across the whole study area. In other
instances the specialization coefficient was relatively high
for EGVs of moderate marginality (in absolute terms).
This was the case for the environmental predictors SHRUB
for An. arabiensis, FARM and SHRUB for the M form, and
RAIN and FARM for the S form. In this case, both marginality and specialization act in the same direction of preference by the focal species for more specific conditions
concerning that EGV.
Fundamental vs. realized ecological niche
According to the broken stick rule, the Habitat Suitability
(HS) maps exploited in all instances the first two factors
of the ENFA, which explained 76–77% of the available
information. The distribution of habitat quality across
Burkina Faso presented some commonalities between the
three taxa (Figure 3). Specifically, the region defined by
the upper and medium basin of the Nakambé River was of
high average quality (optimal to suitable) for all the three
forms/species. This is an area of high population density
and intensive farming (vegetables, millet, sorghum, cotton, and maize), characterized by numerous irrigation
schemes (damming of small artificial lakes for villagescale farming, the large hydroelectric projects of the
Kompienga and Bagré lakes and associated extensive rice
cultivation schemes). The other commonality between
the three taxa was the unsuitability of large, mostly uninhabited, areas occupied by national parks, game reserves,
and forestry management projects.

Percent coverage of the study area by different bin classes of habitat
suitability stratified by the interpolated relative frequency of members
of the An. gambiae complex in Burkina Faso.

On the other hand, a major difference between the taxa
was the relative amount of suitable or optimal habitat
available across Burkina Faso (Table 3): considerably
more for both An. arabiensis and the S form (30–34% of
the total surface) compared to the M form (22%), for
which most habitat was of marginal quality (36%). In
other words, the environment in Burkina Faso provided
conditions that were mostly good to very good or totally
unsuitable to An. arabiensis and the S form, whereas the
same conditions were mostly marginal or unsuitable for
the M form.
We categorized the study area into two classes according
to the interpolated relative abundance of each taxon
(≥50%, and ≤50%). For each taxon and abundance class,
we assessed average habitat quality (unsuitable, marginal,
suitable, optimal; Table 3).

Under the assumptions of equilibrium dynamics and in
the absence of interspecific interactions, it is expected that
the quality of the habitat as predicted by the fundamental
ecological niche requirements should be positively correlated with the realized distribution and abundance of
each taxon [75]. Theory also predicts that departures from
this pattern – a signature of transient dynamics and/or
interference among the taxa – should be characterized by
the most recent (derived) taxon occupying habitat of
more marginal quality than the ancestral taxa [44]. The
predicted association between habitat quality and abundance matched more in the case of An. arabiensis and the
S form, and less for the M form. The latter remained overly
represented in habitat of marginal quality regardless of
abundance status, whereas the former taxa were more
abundant in habitat of overall higher quality (that is, optimal to suitable; Table 3).
The measures of model performance and robustness
(respectively, Mean and SD in Table 4) for the HS maps
indicated that the models were reasonably accurate for all
the three forms/species, but were not particularly robust.
This is a general feature of species distribution models of
focal species having a widespread distribution with large
marginality and restricted tolerance, as in our case, for
purely methodological reasons [76]. Our main purpose,
however, was not to predict with any degree of accuracy
the occurrence of the focal species, but rather to infer gross
patterns of habitat quality and distribution, and to rank
the impact of environmental predictors on these. These
patterns are less likely to have been strongly affected by
the quality and robustness of the model predictions.
Ecological niche breadth and habitat overlap
The analysis of factor loads over the first discriminant factor isolated the main eco-geographical variables differentiating each pair of taxa. As shown in Table 5, different
combinations of variables distinguished the environmental envelope characteristic of each taxon. However, the frequency distribution of the cell scores showed that in all

cases the extent of overlap was substantial, indicating that
the fundamental environmental envelope described by
the selected EGVs did not differ markedly among the
members of the complex (additional file 7).
To quantify the degree of niche overlap we calculated
three indices [64]: Levin's standardized niche breadth B*,
Hurlbert niche overlap L, and Lloyd's directional interspe-

cific crowding of species y on species x, Zx(y). These measures are related to the probability that individuals of a
species will encounter individuals of the other species. To
assess the extent of ecological niche similarity and overlap
between the fundamental vs. realized ecological niche of
the three taxa, we calculated the indices either over the
environmental envelope that maximally discriminated
each pair of taxa (discriminant analysis, cf. Table 5 and

the fundamental environmental envelope that discriminate most among the taxa (cf. additional file 7, and Table 5), whereas the second approach
provides estimates of the realized degree of segregation between locations. We use the more general notation given by Hurlbert [64] of indices

additional file 7), or across the set of sampled locations
(Table 6).
Anopheles arabiensis had marginally lower indices of niche
breadth than the two molecular forms, and the M form
had marginally higher values than the S form (Table 6,
under columns "DA"). The lowest values of Lloyd's asymmetric index were those between the two molecular
forms, indicating that they segregated the most; an almost
two-fold greater value was obtained for the degree of
niche overlap between An. arabiensis and the M form, indicating that they segregated the least. The overlap was fairly
symmetrical in all cases. The same conclusion was
obtained by the Lloyd's interspecies patchiness index I:
the two molecular forms had the lowest index (L = 2.26),
An. arabiensis vs. An. gambiae M the highest (L = 3.76).
The estimates of niche breadth and habitat overlap
obtained from the distribution and abundance of the
three forms/species in the sample locations conformed to
the general pattern of the discriminant analysis, but differences among taxa and species pairs were much larger
(Table 6, under columns "SL"). Perhaps even more importantly, the degree of niche overlap was lower than that
assessed from the fundamental environmental envelope
(Table 6, under columns "DA"). The index of niche overlap was least between the M and S forms and 3-fold higher
between An. gambiae form M and An. arabiensis. Similarly,
Lloyd's asymmetric indices of interspecific crowding were
lowest in the case of the M and S molecular forms, and 3–
4-fold higher in the case of An. arabiensis and the M form.
A comparison of these same indices across columns "DA"
and "SL" in Table 6 reveals that the indices of niche overlap were 3–6 times greater when calculated along the environmental gradient that maximally discriminates among
pairs of taxa. In other words, the realized habitat segregation of the taxa was more pronounced than that expected
from the degree of habitat suitability across the study area.
Overall, these results indicate that the M form of An. gambiae, despite a potential niche breadth of similar magnitude as the other two taxa, which overlapped extensively
with their fundamental ecological niche, realized a niche
of lower breadth than An. arabiensis and An. gambiae form
S, and diverged most from the latter taxon.
The process of ecological divergence between molecular
forms has shifted the niche of the M form towards that of
An. arabiensis, thereby inducing a higher niche overlap in
the case of these two species.
Chromosomal polymorphism and population structure
The chromosomal analysis was based on 3,377 An. gambiae s.s. that could be scored for all inversions. Table 7
presents the allocation of karyotypes by molecular form,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

by chromosomal form [31], and by genetic clusters of
karyotypes assigned by STRUCTURE. STRUCTURE identified two clusters as the most likely based on the chromosomal data (additional file 8). Although most S
karyotypes were assigned to Cluster 1 and M karyotypes to
Cluster 2, the two clusters did not perfectly coincide with
molecular form status (Figure 4 and Table 7). About 9%
of S individuals were assigned to Cluster 2, and 5% of Mindividuals to Cluster 1. As expected, karyotypes of the MS
hybrids were much more widely shared between clusters
(69% in Cluster 1 and 31% in Cluster 2 – Table 7). The
chromosomal forms definition does not allow the unambiguous assignment of all possible karyotypes, either
because of technical difficulties with scoring inversion
haplotypes (the phase of variants on each chromatid), or
because they are by definition 'recombinants' or otherwise
segregating in multiple chromosomal forms (e.g. the
'FOREST' karyotypes that are shared between MOPTI and
SAVANNA). These ambiguous karyotypes accounted for
13.5% of the samples across our study area. Thus, while
some correspondence between molecular and chromosomal forms of An. gambiae exists in Burkina Faso as
reported in [77], only 71.5% and 91.0% of all M and S
specimens could be assigned to the chromosomal forms
MOPTI and SAVANNA, respectively.
It is interesting to note that the classification of karyotypes
into chromosomal forms was originally proposed to
restore genetic disequilibria observed in natural populations of An. gambiae. The original definition was mainly
based on extensive sampling in Mali [31]. The same objective, by a different approach, is also the basis of the
STRUCTURE algorithms. However, the two karyotype
clusters identified by STRUCTURE from Burkina Faso
samples are not coincident with the chromosomal form
definitions (Table 7). Contrasting levels of chromosomal
polymorphism distinguish the two clusters: Cluster 1 is
characterized solely by the presence of the 2Rb/+ 2La/+
polymorphism, as encountered in An. gambiae populations across much of Africa, including east of the Great
Rift Valley. Conversely, Cluster 2 is characterized by all
other inversion arrangements (2Rc, 2Rd, 2Ru) in combination with the 2Rb.
If we accept the correspondence Cluster 1/S form and
Cluster 2/M form, then "mismatches" between molecular
form and cluster assignment by STRUCTURE would represent "admixed" individuals whose genotype is the result
of shared ancestry or hybridization between the M and S
forms. To explore this hypothesis, and to quantify the
degree of admixture of different karyotypes, we repeated
the STUCTURE analysis, this time after assignment of
individual karyotypes to their empirically determined
molecular form. In this case, STRUCTURE estimates the
probability that each observed karyotype belongs to the

Assignment of karyotypes observed in Burkina Faso according to three classification criteria: the recorded rDNA IGS state (Molecular Form), the
multi-locus genetic clustering approach implemented in the software STRUCTURE, without prior assignment to a given population (Clusters 1 and
2), and the chromosomal form status according to [31]. The non-Linnean nomenclature FOREST, MOPTI, and SAVANNA defines groups of
karyotypes (i.e. chromosomal forms) restoring Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of chromosomal inversion markers in field populations of An. gambiae
s.s., with particular reference to Mali (for more details, see [31]). The table presents the frequency of observed karyotypes falling in each category.

population of origin, or whether it is the result of 'immigration' (in this case, shared ancestry or hybridization).
The results of this analysis, shown in additional file 9,
indicate that most karyotypes derived from M form specimens had a high probability (≥90%) of belonging to the
M form. Karyotypes derived from the S form had a higher
degree of admixture with M (probabilities ≤90%).
Ecology of chromosomal variants
The detrended correspondence analysis showed that the
M and S form karyotypes segregated along the first ordination axis (Figure 5A and 5B), which accounted for c. 23%
of the variance in the karyotype frequency data and c. 58%

of the karyotype/environment correlation. The correlation
between karyotypes and EGVs along this axis was very
high (0.94). The contribution of the second axis was comparatively much lower: 7% of the karyotype frequency
data and 6.5% of the karyotype/environment relation,
with a correlation coefficient of 0.54. Similar values
applied to the third and fourth axes. The first axis, therefore, captured most of the variability in the karyotype frequency distribution and the correlation of karyotypes
with environmental conditions across the study area,
although there remained a large portion of unaccounted
variability that was spread over subsequent axes – each
accounting for a relatively minor portion of the remaining

unexplained variance. Despite the substantial number of
EGVs, the amount of variance that the eco-geographical
variables could account for was only moderate (32%).
To assist interpretation of the environmental gradients
captured by the first and second ordination axes, continuous and nominal variables were plotted in ordination
space (Figures 5C and 5D). The first ordination axis was
highly correlated with the climatic variables and vegetation zones, suggesting that it defines the geographical
(mainly latitudinal) cline associated with these EGVs: the
right end of the axis was associated with higher values of
rainfall and lower values of temperature, solar radiation,
and evapotranspiration characteristic of the southern
Sudan savanna vegetation; conversely higher values of
temperature, solar radiation, and evapotranspiration and
lower values of rainfall were associated with the two types
of sahelian vegetation at the left end of the first ordination
axis. The southern Sudan savanna region in Burkina Faso
is associated with higher values of altitude due to a hilly

region in the south-west (Figure 1), hence slope values are
higher as well. Higher frequencies of woodland, shrubland, and areas of heterogeneous farming characterize the
land cover of these same regions. Conversely, the Sahel is
mostly characterized by areas devoid of vegetation (open
spaces).
Interpretation of the second ordination axis is more difficult, but we suggest that it represents a gradient correlated
with habitat quality. Unsuitable and marginal habitat
classes for both M and S map in the lower part of the diagram, whereas suitable and optimal classes, again for both
M and S, map in the upper part of the diagram. Distance
from populated places, a variable that was highly influential in the ENFA, has a high negative correlation with the
second ordination axis, that is, points falling in the lower
part of the diagram are more distant from populated
places, hence fall in habitat of lower quality according to
the results of the ENFA for both M and S. This axis, there-

fore, would represent a gradient of overall habitat quality
for An. gambiae, regardless of molecular form status.
Under this interpretation of the two main ordination axes,
a model for the distribution of chromosomal variants in
M and S can be proposed. The fact that M and S karyotypes
strongly segregated along the first ordination axis is not
surprising considering the observed pattern of geographical distribution of the two molecular forms across Burkina
Faso (Figure 3). However, it is revealing to compare the
response of the same karyotype segregating in different
molecular forms. In the diagram, the relative position of a
karyotype common to both molecular forms was consistent across forms overall. For example, the standard
homokaryotype 00000M/S is found at the right end of
both molecular form distributions; similarly, the 2Rbc/bc
karyotype 02200M/S is shifted to the left in both distributions (Figure 5A). Thus, the 00000M/S karyotypes were
found in less 'arid' conditions in both M and S relative to
the average conditions of aridity experienced by each form
with respect to their geographical distribution, and the
converse for 02200M/S karyotypes. In general, this suggests that although they are present in (and influenced by)
different genetic backgrounds of the M or S form, each
karyotype responded in a similar manner to environmental variables acting at a macrogeographic scale.
The distribution of karyotypes along the second environmental gradient, the one correlated with habitat quality,
indicates that 'admixed' karyotypes within each molecular
form occurred in habitat of overall less suitable quality.
For example, the admixed karyotypes 02200S, 01100S,
01101S in S and 02000M, 02101M, 02100M, 01000M in
M (see additional file 9 and Table 7) mapped at the lower
end of the second ordination axis, whereas the 'typical'
karyotypes were found higher up along this axis. To formally test this hypothesis we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between the scores on the second
ordination axis of common karyotypes (total frequency
>3) and the probability that the karyotype belonged to the
population of origin (values in additional file 9). The correlation was positive and statistically significant (rs =
0.501, n = 31, P = 0.003), indicating that indeed, on average, more admixed karyotypes scored lower on the habitat
quality gradient.
Several inferences can be drawn from these results: first, if
alternative chromosomal arrangements were acting as
selectively neutral alleles, one would expect similar karyotypes to map closely in ordination space along the first
ordination axis. Contrary to this expectation, the same
karyotypes in M and S were often distant along this axis,
but not in a random order, consistent with the hypothesis
that chromosomal inversions in An. gambiae are not selectively neutral. Second, the adaptive role of inversions is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

not absolute, but instead is conditioned upon the genetic
background of the molecular form. Third, under the
assumption that 'typical' karyotypes occurred in habitat of
better quality because they are better adapted to it, the fitness disadvantage of 'admixed' karyotypes in marginal
habitats of poorer quality might be offset by reduced
intra-specific competition from 'typical' karyotypes. In
other words, the 'admixed' karyotypes are those that 'live
at the edge' of the adaptive landscape of each taxon,
thereby providing the raw material on which evolutionary
forces operate in the ecological speciation process.

Discussion
The ecotypification theory of speciation of anopheline
mosquitoes postulated by Coluzzi [8,78] is a specialized
case of ecological speciation taking into account their
small chromosome number (2N = 6) as well as their
"flush and crash" population dynamics. Like ecological
speciation generally, it is based on the coordinated action
of ecological and genetic mechanisms for the evolution of
reproductive isolation in diverging populations. The principal tenets and steps of this theory are (i) the invasion of
a new ecological niche by a peripheral population; (ii) the
appearance in the peripheral isolate and establishment
(by positive selection) of alleles conferring a fitness
advantage in the novel environment, in the absence of
gene flow from the core population; (iii) the maintenance
of linkage between these alleles in the face of gene flow
from the core population by a genetic mechanism that
suppresses recombination, notably paracentric chromosomal inversions; (iv) the increase of genetic differentiation between the ecologically diverging populations by
accumulation of allelic differences, including genes
involved in reproductive isolation.
From an ecological standpoint, this theory presupposes
several ecological mechanisms, of which the invasion of a
new niche is amongst the most crucial. When a peripheral
population invades a new habitat, it is unlikely that it will
already have acquired all the traits necessary to cope optimally with the novel environment. At the early stages of
colonization, its fundamental ecological niche will be
similar to that of the core population, resulting in extensive niche overlap between these populations. The new
habitat, therefore, will be of marginal quality with respect
to the requirements of the fundamental ecological niche
of the invading peripheral population [44]. The occupation of the new habitat by the peripheral population, and
its progressive adaptation to it, however, will reduce the
realized niche breadth of the peripheral population and
the degree of realized niche overlap between the peripheral
and core populations. A transient mismatch between the
fundamental vs. realized ecological niche of the core and
peripheral populations, and the occurrence of the peripheral population in habitat of lower quality, therefore, con-

stitute a signature of recent niche expansion. Later on, as
the process of adaptation by the peripheral population to
the new conditions carries on, its fundamental ecological
niche will progressively change to match the environmental envelope characterizing the new habitat, producing a
niche shift and a reduction in the extent of niche overlap
between the core and peripheral populations.
The ecological niche properties of the M molecular form
of An. gambiae that we recorded in populations from
Burkina Faso fit with this signature of niche expansion
and ecological divergence from the S form. The fundamental ecological niche of the two taxa inferred under the
hypervolume framework formalized by Hutchinson [59],
was rather similar: both forms need specific environmental requirements, whose occurrence is greatly influenced
by the presence and activity of humans, and niche overlap
is extensive even over the environmental gradient where
the two forms segregate the most.
On the other hand, the biogeographic pattern of occurrence and abundance showed that the degree of realized
niche overlap between the two molecular forms of An.
gambiae s.s. was proportionally less, in discordance with
expectations from ecological speciation theory which predicts, in taxa of similar age, an association between the
amount of ecological divergence and the degree of reproductive isolation [1,5]. According to this prediction, we
should have observed a higher degree of habitat segregation between the taxa of older ancestry – An. gambiae and
An. arabiensis, characterized by efficacious pre-zygotic and
post-zygotic mechanisms [8,13], than between the
younger molecular forms of An. gambiae, among which
reproductive isolation is at an earlier stage of development [20,22].
Departure from expectation might result from a combination of several factors. First, the association between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation is weaker
when post-zygotic isolation is the main isolating mechanism [5]; post-zygotic isolation is stronger between An.
gambiae and An. arabiensis than between the molecular
forms of An. gambiae [13,22]. Second, we have examined
only a subset of abiotic resources at a macro-geographic
scale, whereas other factors (e.g. predation, competition)
acting at other geographical scales might account for a different pattern of ecological differentiation among the
three taxa. Third, in the process of niche expansion, the M
molecular form of An. gambiae, which is presumably the
most recent, has invaded part of the adaptive landscape of
An. arabiensis. If chromosomal arrangements shared
between these two taxa [9,32] were independently
selected, genetic similarity might have resulted in ecological convergence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

But what makes a population occupy habitat of marginal
quality, and where does the process of niche expansion
find its driving force? Our results suggest that competition
between genetic variants is one of the possible mechanisms. Models of adaptive divergence across heterogeneous landscapes have demonstrated that competition can
lead to the appearance of clusters of adaptive phenotypes
at the extremes of an environmental cline [[79,80] and
references therein], and there is experimental evidence
that competition can lead to the expansion of niche width
[81]. In our study area, the spatial distribution of chromosomal variants with respect to environmental variables
and habitat quality was non-random. Instead, the same
karyotypes were spatially distributed in a symmetric pattern in both molecular forms in response to gross environmental gradients of climate, vegetation, and land cover.
This suggests two things. First, in agreement with a large
literature [9,10,32,82], the polymorphic chromosomal
inversions of An. gambiae constitute an adaptive system
under balancing selection, playing a role in the ecological
plasticity and adaptive potential of this species across a
diversity of environments. Second, that particular karyotypes provide a broadly similar benefit to both M and S
forms under the same environmental conditions. However, their particular ecological value appears to be conditioned on the different genetic backgrounds of the M and
S forms. When karyotypes 'typical' of one form in Burkina
Faso (for example, 02200 for M and 02000 for S) were carried by the other form (that is, 02200 in S and 02000 in
M), they were observed in habitat of more marginal quality (Figure 5A and 6B), suggesting that these rarer 'atypical'
karyotypes represent genotypes of overall lower fitness.
Assuming that 'typical' karyotypes have superior fitness in
suitable and optimal habitat, we propose that 'atypical'
karyotypes are able to emerge from competition with 'typical' karyotypes only in marginal habitats, where the fitness advantage of the more successful 'typical' karyotypes
becomes less (Figure 6). It is possible that 'atypical' karyotypes are those that initiate the process of niche expansion and shift. In the early steps of divergence, these
karyotypes are probably maladapted to the marginal conditions they are obliged to live in to escape competition
from the 'typical' karyotypes in the core of the adaptive
landscape (Figure 6). However, the 'atypical' karyotypes
may provide the raw material that evolution can build
upon to initiate a process of ecological divergence. Were it
not for an incomplete reproductive barrier between M and
S, 'atypical' karyotypes (e.g. 02000M in Figure 6) would
presumably go extinct once they have given rise to ecologically more successful karyotypes (e.g. 02200M in Figure
6), because of their lower overall fitness compared to
other karyotypes along the entire environmental gradient.
However, because of occasional hybridization between M
and S, 'admixed' karyotypes still occur in natural field

molecular forms
Hypothetical evolutionary path leading to adaptive ecological divergence of some chromosome-2 variants of
Anopheles gambiae molecular forms. The figure shows second-order polynomial 'species' response curves [58,69] fitting
the data set of karyotype frequencies (P < 0.01 in all cases). The response on the ordinate is a measure of relative abundance
that is taken as a proxy of fitness. Axis 1 in (A) and Axis 2 in (B) on the abscissa are the same ordination axes as in Figure 5.
They are interpreted to represent environmental gradients related to a major eco-geographical cline (Axis 1 – xeric conditions
at higher latitudes on the left, mesic conditions at lower latitudes on the right), and to general habitat quality (Axis 2 – increasing habitat quality from left to right). The curves visualize the optimum response (the point on the abscissa falling at the maximum of the curve), and the degree of tolerance (the width of the curve around the optimum) of each karyotype along the
environmental gradients. In (A), arrows point to a postulated sequence of chromosomal mutation and allele assortment events
leading to a habitat shift from a monomorphic standard karyotype (00000S) to a typical Cluster 2/M karyotype (02200M) via
typical Cluster 1/S (02000S) and then 'atypical' (02000M, 02100M) karyotypes. The letter "M" marks the appearance of ecologically adaptive genes in the independently segregating pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. The figure also shows that
02100S karyotypes share similar habitat optima and tolerance but lower fitness than 02000S karyotypes. In the face of competition with 02000S, therefore, 02100M and the 'atypical' 02000M karyotypes compete less against 02000S by occupying more
marginal habitats, particularly on the habitat quality gradient (Axis 2 in B), compared to 02100S. In (B) it is apparent the greater
degree of tolerance of M karyotypes, with optima shifted to habitat of overall lower quality relative to S. This evolutionary path
is not exclusive and it is taken as an example for illustrative purposes: other paths involving different sets of karyotypes are also
possible (not shown).

populations, occupying the same ecological role of their
ancestral 'atypical' analogs.
How might these hypotheses relate to the ecotypification
theory of speciation? The first observation is that chromosomal variants in An. gambiae populations are ubiquitous
and emerge frequently. The analysis of the distribution
and frequency of rare chromosomal inversions in this species agrees with a model of high chromosomal plasticity
driven by the frequent emergence of chromosomal rearrangements on the 2R arm [83]. In general, most of these
chromosomal variants do not capture enough adaptive
alleles to go beyond the early phases of establishment, or

they are otherwise selectively neutral and lost by drift.
Based on the distribution of karyotypes in relation to the
nature of habitat quality, we hypothesize that sometimes
the rearrangements provide a selective advantage, but not
enough to withstand the competition from genotypes
already present in the core of the population adaptive
landscape. These karyotypes are therefore confined to
more marginal environments where they can initiate a
process of niche expansion and niche shift. Yet there is a
paradox, due to the observation that the same chromosomal inversion variants are shared between molecular
forms of An. gambiae. This implies that while ecological
adaptation genes should be found inside inversions on

BMC Ecology 2009, 9:16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/16

the 2R chromosomal arm, they are unlikely to contain the
genes responsible for premating reproductive isolation
between M and S. Indeed, the genome regions currently
considered most likely to contain genes for reproductive
isolation are highly diverged pericentromeric regions of
chromosome X and 2L, termed "speciation islands"
[28,84]. The supposition is that paracentric chromosomal
inversions are not the sole mechanism by which ecotypification and speciation can take place. All genetic mechanisms by which recombination is suppressed, thereby
providing a means to protect the linkage of favourable
allele combinations, can play a role in this process –
including suppressed recombination regions near centromeres [85]. Thus, it can be proposed that when ecologically favourable mutations in the pericentromeric
"speciation islands" started to appear, the processes of
ecological divergence and speciation arrived at a turning
point. At this stage, the appearance of alleles controlling
reproductive isolation could protect the linkage of the
unlinked chromosomal regions (inversions and pericentromeric regions) harbouring ecologically-significant
allele combinations. Another mechanism that could
potentially foster this process would be any kind of selec-

tion against hybridization of the diverging ecotypes, such
as e.g. reinforcement in the 'broad sense' [86]. Figure 7
schematically summarizes the postulated evolutionary
steps of the proposed pattern of ecological and genetic
diversification of M and S using the path of Figure 6 as a
model, showing the dynamic interaction between ecological adaptation genes on different regions of the genome.
It must be stressed that this specific path is only one possible realization that is taken to exemplify the role of 'typical' and 'atypical' karyotypes in the process of ecological
niche expansion and the development of reproductive
isolation between M and S. It is largely premature to conclude that this evolutionary path was precisely that followed during M and S speciation; we use it here only as a
general model that we can use to visualize formally the
logic of our argument and generate testable predictions
against which future observations can be compared. A
summary of the main results, hypotheses, and conclusions inferred from this study is presented in Table 8.
The present pattern of distribution of the diverging evolutionarily significant units of An. gambiae, the molecular
forms M and S, agrees with the view that biogeographic

patterns during speciation are dynamic [4]. The two forms
are currently evolving reproductive isolation, and the
present data show that they are ecologically diverging.
Such ongoing speciation is happening under clinal sympatry, yet the very ecological processes underlying the initial steps of divergence presumably involve the
occupation of marginal habitats and may happen under
allopatry of the genetic variants responsible for the niche
shift.

Conclusion
Anopheles gambiae, the most significant vector for human
malaria, shows a remarkable capacity to thrive in a wide
range of environmental conditions, provided humans are
present. Genomic regions of suppressed recombination
appear to have a leading role in the adaptation of this species to novel environments and in the emergence of reproductive isolation. Ongoing speciation involving the two
molecular forms of An. gambiae is accompanied, and presumably driven, by a process of ecological divergence initiated by expansion of the original ecological niche of the
ancestral S form. Paracentric inversions on chromosomal
arm 2R capturing allele combinations of ecological adaptive value were likely instrumental to the initiation of this
process. The later appearance of ecologically significant
genes in unlinked chromosomal regions such as the speciation islands is postulated for the evolution of reproductive isolation. Overall, these results highlight the
phenomenal ecological and evolutionary flexibility of this
mosquito, as well as the extraordinary complexity of the
population structure and dynamics of this biological
model – a lesson not only for students of speciation, but
also for vector control.

indicate that An. arabiensis was found in locations with higher values
than average for that EGV. Negative values for EGVs quantified as "minimum distance from" (POPPL, ROAD, HYDRO) indicate "preference to
proximity". Higher specialization coefficients, regardless of sign, indicate
that Anopheles arabiensis was found occupying a narrower range of values of the EGV than available in the reference set. For visualization purposes, values ≥0.2 are outlined in red, values ≤ -0.2 are outlined in blue.
