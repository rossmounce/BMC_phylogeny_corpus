Abstract
Background: Aspartic proteases are known to play an important role in the biology of nematode
parasitism. This role is best characterised in blood-feeding nematodes, where they digest
haemoglobin, but they are also likely to play important roles in the biology of nematode parasites
that do not feed on blood. In the present work, we investigate the evolution and expression of
aspartic proteases in Strongyloides ratti, which permits a unique comparison between parasitic and
free-living adult forms within its life-cycle.
Results: We identified eight transcribed aspartic protease sequences and a further two genomic
sequences and compared these to homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematode
species. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a complex pattern of gene evolution, such that some
S. ratti sequences had a one-to-one correspondence with orthologues of C. elegans but that lineagespecific expansions have occurred for other aspartic proteases in these two nematodes. These
gene duplication events may have contributed to the adaptation of the two species to their different
lifestyles. Among the set of S. ratti aspartic proteases were two closely-related isoforms that
showed differential expression during different life stages: ASP-2A is highly expressed in parasitic
females while ASP-2B is predominantly found in free-living adults. Molecular modelling of the ASP2 isoforms reveals that their substrate specificities are likely to be very similar, but that ASP-2B is
more electrostatically negative over its entire molecular surface than ASP-2A. This characteristic
may be related to different pH values of the environments in which these two isoforms operate.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated that S. ratti provides a powerful model to explore the
genetic adaptations associated with parasitic versus free-living life-styles. We have discovered gene
duplication of aspartic protease genes in Strongyloides and identified a pair of paralogues
differentially expressed in either the parasitic or the free-living phase of the nematode life-cycle,
consistent with an adaptive role for aspartic proteases in the evolution of nematode parasitism.

Background
Adaptation of nematode taxa to a parasitic life-style represents an evolutionary challenge that is likely to be met, in
part, by gene duplication in a gene family and subsequent
acquisition of novel gene function among its paralogous
members. One group of genes that has received considerable interest in this respect are aspartic proteases. Aspartic
proteases are defined by having catalytic aspartic acid residues located in their active site clefts and include pepsins,
renins, cathepsins D and E and chymosins [1-3]. In parasitic nematodes, aspartic proteases have been associated
with digestion of host haemoglobin in the trichostrongylid Haemonchus contortus and in the hookworms Ancylostoma caninum and Necator americanus [4]. Moreover, the
aspartic proteases of A. caninum and N. americanus each
exhibit specificity in their ability to digest haemoglobin
from natural versus unnatural hosts, indicating evolutionary adaptation to their host species [4]. Consequently,
several aspartic proteases are currently being developed as
vaccines in trichostrongylids and hookworms, many of
which demonstrate an ability to reduce worm burden
and/or egg output [5,6]. Aspartic proteases have also been
shown to degrade skin macromolecules and aid skin penetration in hookworms, suggesting that their role in nematode parasitism is not limited to digestion of
haemoglobin [7]. Given this, the aspartic proteases may
play a role in the biology of nematode parasites that do
not feed on blood, such as Strongyloides stercoralis,
Onchocerca volvulus and Brugia malayi in which aspartic
proteases have previously been identified [7,8].
Nematodes of the genus Strongyloides infect a wide range
of mammalian species, including humans and livestock,
and infection occurs by skin penetration. Strongyloides
spp. is not blood-feeding and parasitism is believed to
have arisen separately in the lineages leading to Strongyloides and to the hookworms and trichostrongylids [9].
Strongyloides provides a useful model to study the evolution of genes associated with parasitism, since both parasitic and free-living adults are present in the life-cycle
(Figure 1). Thus, one might predict that genes, including
aspartic proteases, which retain distinct functions in freeliving and parasitic environments, are maintained within
the Strongyloides genome. Previously, and in support of
this prediction, we have presented preliminary evidence
that distinct aspartic proteases from S. ratti, a laboratory
model of Strongyloides infection, were differentially transcribed between free-living females and parasitic females
[10].
In the present study we have identified ten aspartic proteases in S. ratti using sequence data from a collection of
14,761 cDNA clones described in Thompson et al. [11]
and Evans et al. [10], by novel pyrosequencing of normalised cDNA using a 454-FLX sequencer and from an early

http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/sequencing/Strongyloides/. We used
comparative sequence analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction between these and other aspartic proteases,
including those belonging to the non-parasitic nematodes
Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, to identify separate
duplication events within different nematode lineages.
We identified a pair of paralogous aspartic proteases in S.
ratti (which we term ASP-2A and ASP-2B) that have arisen
as a result of a recent duplication event but for which ASP2A is highly expressed in parasitic females while ASP-2B is
highly expressed in free-living females, and we present a
molecular model that allows this pair of paralogous genes
to be placed in a structural context.

Results
Identification of aspartic protease sequences in S. ratti
BLASTx searches of 3,688 contigs from S. ratti EST
sequences (cDNA library) and 29,137 contigs from the
pyrosequencing against the Wormpep, UniprotKB/SwissProt and nr databases revealed hits against various aspartic protease proteins. Upon close inspection of the consensus sequence for each contig, eight transcripts of
aspartic protease were identified, which we termed ASP-1,
ASP-2A, ASP-2B, ASP-3, ASP-4, ASP-7, ASP-9, and ASP-10.
Two further putative asparatic protease genes, asp-8 and
asp-11, were identified within the draft genome sequence
for S. ratti (i.e. predicted genes for which there was no support from transcript evidence). 5' RACE was used to complete full length coding sequences for ASP-2A and ASP-2B,
while the full length for other transcripts were obtained
using the genome sequences for S. ratti, when necessary.
The only exceptions were ASP-3 and ASP-4 where the
present state of the genome sequence did not allow for
completion at the N-terminus. Both nucleotide and

amino-acid differences were observed across the length of
all 10 sequences, indicating these isoforms represented
distinct, paralogous loci rather than splice-site variants.
Orthology was determined by the phylogenetic analysis
and nomenclature was assigned to each gene, where possible, based on its orthology with the published C. elegans
aspartic proteases, ASP-1 to ASP-6 [12] and to uncharacterised C. elegans aspartic proteases. Due to the difficulty
in assigning orthologous S. ratti transcripts to C. elegans
ASP-5 and ASP-6 based on our phylogenetic analysis
(Cluster III discussion below), numbers 5 and 6 were not
used. The eight S. ratti aspartic protease genes with their
predicted amino acid sequences were submitted to GenBank (GenBank:FJ756439, GenBank:FJ756440, GenBank:FJ756441, GenBank:FJ756442, GenBank:FJ756443,
GenBank:FJ756444, GenBank:FJ756445, and GenBank:FJ756446). All 454 cDNA sequence data are available from NEBC Envgen catalogue http://nebc.nox.ac.uk/
data/envbase. A Muscle alignment of the predicted amino
acid sequences for each S. ratti aspartic protease is shown
in Figure 2a. Signal peptides of the pre-proenzymes were
determined and labelled in the alignment. It is known
that aspartic proteases undergo a post-translational modification whereby about 60 residues are cleaved from the
N-terminus of the proenzyme producing the mature protein and the predicted cleavage points of these proteins are
also marked in the alignment (Figure 2a). N-glycosylation
site, presupposed to be necessary for lysosomal targeting,
are also labelled, and as for C. elegans, the site is absent in
ASP-3 and ASP-4. Syntichaki et al. [13] have shown these
two aspartic proteases are involved in neurodegeneration
in C. elegans.
Phylogenetic analysis of aspartic proteases
Protein distance-based phylogenetic analysis of the
eukaryotic aspartic protease amino acid sequences
resulted in an unrooted tree with three clusters (Figure 3).
The C. elegans sequences for aspartic proteases were used
as reference for the cluster division and interpretation as
follows; Cluster I contained both ASP-3 and ASP-4; Cluster II C. elegans ASP-1; and Cluster III contained ASP-2,
ASP-5 and ASP-6 sequences. The tree could also be interpreted as two major groups, one containing ASP-1, ASP-3,
ASP-4, and the other ASP-2, ASP-5 and ASP-6. Two
sequences did not group with any other; Q8 MY59 from
B. malayi and A8WZ33, an uncharacterised transcript in C.
briggsae. There are also three uncharacterised transcript
sequences, two from C. briggsae (A8X733 and A8XQ82)
and one from C. elegans (Q18020) which forms a small
group. Interestingly, the tree topology can be correlated
with genomic position: in C. elegans, the ASP-1, ASP-2,
ASP-5 and ASP-6 are located on chromosome V, whilst
ASP-3 and ASP-4 are on chromosome X [12]. In the cases
of branches containing C. elegans ASP-3 and ASP-4, each
species is represented by a single sequence. This clear evo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

lutionary relationship allows for the naming of the corresponding S. ratti transcripts.
A similar pattern was observed for ASP-1, although this
gene is not well represented in terms of nematode species.
As expected, ASP-1 from S. ratii and S. stercoralis are very
similar, as shown by the tree. Remarkably, in the group
containing C. elegans ASP-1 and four other hypothetical C.
elegans proteins, C. briggsae is represented by ASP-1 alone.
This suggests that there have been a number of duplications in the ASP-1 lineage in C. elegans since its divergence
from C. briggsae. This scenario is supported by the fact that
three of the C. elegans hypothetical proteins are genomic
neighbours (Q8 MYN5, Q8 MYN6 and Q8 MYN7).
A different scenario was observed for the ASP-2, ASP-5
and ASP-6 C. elegans sequences, the latter two of which are
contained within a monophyletic group composed exclusively of Caenorhabditis sequences. This branches with a
group of six S. ratti sequences, also clearly sharing a recent
common origin. In a further branch are located two H.
contortus sequences [14] which also group together. This
suggests that at least three independent duplications have
occurred in this part of the protease family, one in the lineage containing C. elegans, another in the predecessor of
H. contortus, and a distinct set of events in the branch leading to S. ratti. Similar results were also obtained using
minimum evolution and maximum parsimony phylogenetic approaches (not shown). These results mean that the
naming of S. ratti sequences by orthology with their C. elegans counterparts breaks down here. Note that for other
species other than C. elegans, numbering of aspartic proteases does not appear to be related to evolutionary history, instead being based, for example, on the order in
which genes were discovered.
Analysis of the ASP-2A and ASP-2B protein sequences
A pair of paralogous S. ratti sequences, which we termed
ASP-2A and ASP-2B, exhibited 76% amino-acid similarity
to each other and shared a conspicuous characteristic with
C. elegans ASP-2: the presence of a cysteine rich insertion
(see Figure 2a) near the beginning of the sequence, which
consists of ~30-35 amino acids located between the two
putative catalytic residues [15]. Although these S. ratti
sequences do not form a monophyletic cluster with C. elegans ASP-2, we named them ASP-2A and ASP-2B in recognition of this shared cysteine rich insertion. Of those
genes represented in our phylogenetic analysis, the Cysrich insertion was present in: Q88NE0 and Q18020 of C.
elegans; A8XV46, A8X733 and A8XQ82 of C. briggsae;
Q9N9H4 of N. americanus; Q70JE2, Q25037 and
Q9U8G6 of H. contortus; and ASP-2A and ASP-2B of S.
ratti. Interestingly, the Cys-rich insertion has a quite sporadic distribution: Q18020, A8X733 and A8XQ82 form
the small isolated group mentioned above, while all the

other sequences grouped within Cluster III of the phylogeny presented in Figure 3. Alignment of these sequences
indicated that all Cys-rich insertions from these proteins
shared a common ancestor: all contained 6 cysteine residues. With the exception of orthologous pairs from C. elegans and C. briggsae (Q86NE0 and A8XV46), a very
recently duplicated pair from C. briggsae (A8XQ82 and
A8X733) and the two H. contortus sequences (Q25037
and Q9U8G6), sequence identity between insertions was
low at 21-39% (Figure 2b). An alignment also indicated
that Q88NE1 in C. elegans was identical to Q88NE0
except for the addition of ~200 residues at the N-terminal
(result not shown). However, it is unlikely that this longer
protein is actually expressed. First, protein domain analysis reveal the presence of a partial eukaryotic aspartic protease domain coded for by the extra N-terminal residues,
but structural analysis suggests that the N-terminal halfdomain would be unlikely to fold stably, since it lacks key
components of the protein core. Also, a BLASTn search
against the collection of C. elegans ESTs failed to reveal a
single sequence spanning the junction between the additional N-terminal region and the complete aspartic protease domain common to Q88NE1 and Q86NE0. For H.
contortus, Q9U8G6 and Q25037 share 98% sequence
identity and so are not likely to be true isoforms, but
instead duplicated entries within UniProt. By contrast, H.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

contortus Q25037 and Q70JE2 share 50% amino-acid
sequence identity, and so are likely to represent distinct,
paralogous loci.
Analysis of differential transcription of aspartic proteases
by rtPCR analysis
Transcription of seven aspartic protease genes across the
life cycle of S. ratti was measured by rtPCR (ASP-10 from
the pyrosequencing analysis and aspartic proteases
inferred by homology with the S. ratti genome, ASP-8 and
ASP-11, were excluded). Figure 4 shows the relative
expression of each gene between different life developmental stages. While transcription was observed for every
gene in all stages, the expression of each transcript was
variable between developmental stages. ASP-1 and ASP-3
were found to be the most constitutively transcribed in S.
ratti. In C. elegans, ASP-1 expression is lower in adults than
in larvae whereas C. elegans ASP-3 expression is relatively
constitutive through development http://www.worm
base.org. S. ratti ASP-4 transcription was markedly lower
in the immature L1 and L2 stages than in iL3s or in any of
the three adult stages, which is a similar pattern to that
seen for C. elegans ASP-4 [16]. S. ratti ASP-7 and ASP-9
exhibited lower overall abundance than for the other S.
ratti aspartic protease transcripts, and with levels somewhat elevated in the parasitic females (PAF) and the free

living males (FLM). Pronounced differences in transcription levels between developmental stages were observed
for the two S. ratti ASP-2 isoforms; with ASP-2A levels
highest in the parasitic females (PAF) and lowest in the
free living adults (FLF and FLM), whereas ASP-2B levels
were lowest in PAF when compared with FLF and FLM. By
contrast, C. elegans ASP-2 exhibits increasing expression
from embryo through to adult [16].
Molecular Modelling
A model of the ASP-2A structure lacking the Cys-rich
insertion was readily obtained, no doubt helped by the
small size of the insertions and deletions in ASP-2A compared to the templates. Using a multi-template approach
three insertions of 1, 3 and 4 residues were modelled
along with four small deletions of 1 or 2 residues (Figure
5). The model was stereochemically sound with no residues in Ramachandran-disallowed areas and 91% of residues in core regions of the Ramachandran plot. It had a
DOPE score, an effective measure of protein structure
quality in terms of residue contacts and solvent exposure,
of -36610. This compares favourably with DOPE scores of
-40670 and -39370 for the similarly sized main templates.
Support for the accuracy of the alignment used comes
from the observation that Cys residues 217 and 350, neither of which aligned with Cys residues in the templates,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

were found to be ideally positioned to form a novel disulphide bond (Figure 6).
The 30 residue Cys-rich insertion is far beyond the size
limit of around 10-12 residues up to which reasonably
accurate loop modelling is considered possible. Nevertheless, modelling was attempted using the predicted secondary structure (20 residues were predicted to adopt αhelical conformation; Figure 5) and predicted disulphide
bonding pattern as additional constraints. Unfortunately,
there was no agreement between the results of the three
disulphide bond predictors: each top prediction contained a different set of three predicted disulphide bonds.
However, since the first three Cys residues of the insertion
were predicted to lie within a single helix followed immediately by the fourth Cys residue, certain disulphides were
rendered sterically impossible if the secondary structure
prediction was assumed accurate. Models were therefore
made using the insertion disulphide connectivities of (12), (3-4), (5-6), the top prediction of DIANNA [17] and
(1-2), (3-6), (4-5), the top scoring result from the
Cysteine Separation Profile search algorithm at the PreCys
server [18]. However, despite extensive efforts no model
without obvious defects such as knots could be obtained
so further analyses were applied to the model lacking this
portion.

ASP-2A model in the vicinity of the ASP-2A-specific novel putative disulphide bond. The figure was produced using PyMOL
[49], as were Figures 8 and 9.

Of the 335 modelled residues of ASP-2A, 74 differ in ASP2B. Mapping of these on to the ASP-2 modelled structure
(Figure 7) shows that they contain more solvent-exposed
residues than buried ones so that the 3D structures of the
two isoforms may be assumed to be very similar. The differing residues are well dispersed over the molecular surface but, importantly, only three positions are predicted to
lie near to the substrate-binding cleft. These are Met15,
Thr79 and Ile136 in 2A and are replaced by Ile, Gln and
Leu respectively in ASP-2B. These are small to moderate
differences in size and physicochemical characteristics,
suggesting that substrate specificity will be very similar
between the proteins
While analysing the differences between ASP-2A and ASP2B, it was observed that among the 22 replacements
resulting in charge differences there was a marked preference for positive residues in ASP-2A to be replaced by neutral ones in ASP-2B, or neutral positions in ASP-2A to

match negatively-charged residues in ASP-2B. At these 22
positions ASP-2A contains 11 positively charged residues
and six negatively charged ones, compared to the figures
for ASP-2B of two and three, respectively. This results in a
net charge difference on the protein as a whole of -6 in
favour of ASP-2B. Electrostatic surface mapping of the
ASP-2A model shows that it, in common with other aspartic proteases including both templates (not shown) is
strongly negatively charged, on both faces of the molecule
but in particular at the substrate binding cleft. Comparison with ASP-2B (Figure 8) shows that the latter's additional negative charge is spread over several parts of the
molecular surface. Although we were unable to model the
Cys-rich insertion, sequence analysis shows that it follows
a similar trend towards more negative charge on ASP-2B
vs ASP-2A: of the three isoform sequence differences
resulting in charge changes, two are from neutral (ASP2A) to negative (ASP-2B) and the third from positive to
neutral.

Discussion
We found eight distinct asparatic protease genes transcribed by S. ratti. A key question is whether such diversity
within the asparatic protease family has arisen recently,
particularly within lineages leading to parasitic nematodes, or whether this diversity predated the evolution of
the nematode phylum and has been preserved since.
While based on a possibly incomplete sampling of S. ratti

aspartic proteases and a possibly incomplete annotation
of aspartic proteases in genome sequences, our phylogenetic analysis suggests three clusters of asparatic proteases.
Two of these (Clusters I and II in Figure 3) represent
anciently derived aspartic proteases and includes ASP-1,
ASP-3 and ASP-4 of C. elegans, corresponding orthologs
for all three of these genes from S. ratti and additional
orthologous genes in C. briggsae, Brugia malayi, Onchocerca

volvulus, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma caninum, Meloidogyne incognita and S. stercoralis. The remaining five S.
ratti transcripts form a monophyletic group within Cluster
III (at least within those sequences available to the phylogenic analysis). The diversity among these five S. ratti tran-

scripts has therefore arisen from a more recent set of
duplication events than those present in Clusters I and II.
Similarly within Cluster III, independent duplication
events in C. elegans and C. briggsae can be inferred, while
aspartic proteases from the strongylids N. americanus and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:611

H. contortus also group together. Thus, the evolution of
aspartic proteases in Cluster III appears more dynamic
than in Clusters I and II, involving the repeated duplication of asparatic proteases in different lineages.
Two of the S. ratti transcripts within Cluster III, ASP-2A
and ASP-2B, appear to have arisen from a relatively recent
duplication, share 76% amino acid similarity to each
other and exhibit a markedly different expression pattern
(Figure 4). Thus, ASP-2A is predominantly found in parasitic females and ASP-2B in free-living females, suggesting
that these paralogs may have different functions in parasitic versus free-living females. We investigated the structure-function relationship of S. ratti ASP-2A and ASP-2B
by homology modelling. Since only three of the ASP-2A/
ASP-2B sequence differences were located at the substrate
binding cleft, and those were relatively conservative
changes, it can be concluded that the substrate specificity
of the isoforms is likely to be very similar. One possible
explanation for the fixation of two copies of the gene with
similar specificity may lie with the analysis of their electrostatic properties. Although both are strongly negatively
charged at neutral pH, sequence differences consistently
led to extra negative change on isoform ASP-2B. It is possible that these electrostatic differences reflect differences
in the pH at which the two isoforms operate. Most intestinal proteases from C. elegans exhibit optimal activity at
pH 5, suggesting that the C. elegans intestinal lumen is
mildly acidic [19], which is consistent with the negatively
charged surface of S. ratti ASP-2A and ASP-2B. Little is
known about nematode digestion [20], but it is possible
that the pH of the intestinal lumen of S. ratti parasitic
adults is less acidic than that of free-living adults, perhaps
due to different requirements between digestion of microbiota by free-living stages versus host-derived nutrients by
parasitic stages. Accordingly, to maintain solubility and
activity, the free living-specific isoform ASP-2B, might
have adjusted its pI downwards. It also remains possible
that the two isoforms differ in their interaction with as-yet
unidentified elements of their different environments,
since inter-isoform differences are found throughout the
surface of the protein (Figure 7).
Notably, S. ratti ASP-2A and ASP-2B share a cysteine rich
insertion with each other and with ASP-2 of C. elegans
(Q86NE0), C. briggsae (A8XV46), Q9N9H4 of N. americanus and Q70JE2 and Q25037 of H. contortus. These aspartic proteases from N. americanus and H. contortus have
previously been implicated in parasitism, particularly the
digestion of haemoglobin [4,14,21]. Moreover, Q25037
of H. contortus is almost exclusively expressed by the
blood-feeding stages (late L4 and adults) of Haemonchus
contortus, and is localised in the lumen of the gut of the
adult parasite [14]. Since S. ratti does not feed on blood,
the role of ASP-2A in S. ratti parasitic females remains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

unclear, but may involve the digestion of other host macromolecules. The Cys-rich insertion, the similarity of
which between enzymes illustrates a single evolutionary
origin (Figure 2b), shows a rather sporadic distribution in
proteases from Cluster III and is also present in the group
of Q18020, A8X733 and A8XQ82 which do not reliably
fall within any of the three main clusters. Importantly, different phylogenetic methods, including calculation of differences between sequences by both pair-wise and
complete deletion methods, yield the same topology. The
absence of the expected close relationship between proteases sharing this prominent sequence feature indicates
that the insertion must have been present in the common
ancestor of them all, but lost several times during evolution. The repeated loss of this prominent feature is itself
concomitant with the repeated duplication of genes
within Cluster III. This impression of ongoing genetic flux
in the nematodes is in accord with previous analyses of
other phenomena such as gene duplication and diversification [22], gene movement between chromosomes [23]
and gene deletions and truncations [24].
Our results from S. ratti demonstrate that transcriptomic
and genomic sequence data can be combined to identify
distinct members of a gene family. Such data are increasingly becoming available for other parasitic nematodes,
particularly in light of concerted efforts by major sequencing centres and with the advent of new pyrosequencing
techniques [25]. There will therefore soon be the opportunity to perform comparative evolutionary analyses and to
examine the processes of gene gain and loss acting on
large numbers of gene families across multiple nematode
species. Doing so will provide fresh insights into the
genetic and evolutionary mechanisms associated with
parasitism. However, such comparative evolutionary
analyses will also bring considerable challenges. Although
we have used a number of bioinformatic methods to identify and align aspartic protease sequences, these methods
have required manual supervision to construct reliable
phylogenies. A more automated approach, suitable for
analysis of multiple gene families, will still require validation by a manually supervised approach. Our results also
highlight the inherent difficulties in imposing a consistent
nomenclature on duplicated members of gene families.
Ideally, one would wish the nomenclature to reflect the
evolutionary relationships between the orthologs, perhaps by associating parasitic nematode genes to their corresponding C. elegans ortholog. However, as is the case for
S. ratti aspartic proteases in Cluster III, gene duplications
in lineages leading to parasitic nematodes generate paralogs and so confound a nomenclature based on orthology
to a reference sequence genome. Finally, the type of bioinformatic and evolutionary analyses that we present here
can highlight genes, such as S. ratti ASP-2A, which may
have acquired a significant role during the evolution of

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:611

parasitism. As such, these analyses help guide and inform
- but are not a substitute for - more detailed molecular and
biochemical work to examine in greater depth the novel
functions acquired by such duplicated genes that aid a
parasitic life-style.

Conclusions
S. ratti provides a powerful model to explore the genetic
adaptations associated with the evolution of nematode
parasitism due to the presence of both parasitic and freeliving adults within its life-cycle. We have examined the
role of gene duplication in adaptation to the parasitic lifestyle by analysis of genes from the aspartic protease family
in Strongyloides and identified a pair of paralogues differentially expressed in either the parasitic or the free-living
phase of the nematode life-cycle, consistent with an
important role for aspartic proteases in the evolution of
nematode parasitism. While our findings should be tempered by the possible incompleteness of some databases
and their annotation, we consider that gene duplication,
accompanied by the acquisition of new function, is likely
to be more widely applicable to understanding the evolutionary adaptations and biology of nematode parasites.

Methods
Collection of S. ratti material
A laboratory line (LIV 4) of S. ratti was used for all analyses. This line was generated and maintained in female
Wistar rats (Charles River, UK) as described previously
[26,27]. For the collection of free living stages, faeces from
8-day infected rats was collected and cultured at 19°C
[26]. L1, L2 and iL3 stages were removed from the faeces
on days 9, 10 and 11 post infection (p.i.) using the methods described by Paterson and Viney [28], whereas free
living adult males and females were picked by pipette on
day 12 p.i. For the collection of parasitic females, 8-day
infected rats were starved overnight and then culled on
day 9 p.i. Parasitic females were removed from the small
intestines and counted as described by Evans et al. [10].
Worms from each stage were placed in 500 μl TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and
stored at -80°C. Total RNA was then extracted using TRIzol Plus extraction columns (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) following the manufacturer's
instructions. All animal work was conducted under
United Kingdom Home Office licence (PPL40/2933) and
in accordance with the University of Liverpool's ethical
review procedures.
Transcript sequence data from cDNA clones
Transcript sequence data was used from a S. ratti cDNA
library constructed from 14,761 cDNA clones selected
from five stages during parasitic and free-living development as described in Thompson et al. [11]. Expressed
sequence tags (ESTs), derived by Sanger sequencing, from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

these clones were assembled into 3,688 unique transcripts
or 'contigs', as described by Evans et al. [10].
Transcript sequence data from pyrosequencing
0.7 μg total RNA extracted from adult free living male and
female, and parasitic female worms was mixed to form 2.1
μg and then shipped in ethanol to Evrogen Technologies,
Moscow. The sample was subjected to SMART cDNA synthesis and amplification [29], followed by Duplex-Specific-Nuclease (DSN) normalisation [30] in order to
enrich for full length transcript sequences and equalise
transcript abundance. Upon return, 80 ng of normalised
sample was subjected to a further round of amplification
using the Advantage 2 Polymerase mix and 0.4 μM
SMART PCR primer (Clontech Laboratories, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting
product was purified using QIAquick PCR purification
columns (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) to a final concentration
of ~300 ng/μl prior to pyrosequencing sequencing. At
least 4 μg of normalised cDNA was submitted to the
Advanced Genomics Facility (AGF) at The University of
Liverpool where the sample was prepared using methods
essentially as described by Margulies et al. [31]. Briefly,
sample quality was first assessed using the Agilent bioanalyser and then the sample was nebulised into 300-500 bp
fragments, blunted and ligated to short adapters. Each
fragment was then fixed to DNA capture beads (one fragment one bead) and subjected to emulsion PCR
(emPCR). All fragments were amplified in parallel and
then placed into individual wells of a PicoTiterPlate where
they were sequenced also in parallel using the Genome
Sequencer FLX Instrument (Roche). Contig assembly was
carried out using the Roche Newbler assembly programme, software version 1.1.03.24.
Genome sequence data
Data from an early draft of S. ratti genome sequence was
used, generated by the Sanger Institute, UK. This consisted
of 437,784 shotgun reads comprising 281 Mb of total
sequence assembled into 9,792 contigs with a combined
length of 37 Mb http://www.sanger.ac.uk/sequencing/
Strongyloides.
Identification of aspartic protease transcripts within S.
ratti transcript sequence data
Similarity searches were conducted on the consensus
sequence of each contig built for the cDNA library and for
the results of pyrosequencing to assign putative identities.
For this, BLASTx [32] searches with a cut-off of e < 1 × 1010, against wormpep196 http://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/
wormbase[33], UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot http://www.uni
prot.org[34] and nr http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[35]
were carried out. The databases used were those available
during September 2008. Where incomplete protein
sequences were obtained, possible erroneous frame shifts

Page 12 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:611

were sought using the translate tool at the Expasy website
http://www.expasy.org/tools/dna.html and, where found,
manually corrected. Only transcripts that could be unambiguously generated in this way were considered for further analysis. In some cases, the 5' end of transcripts were
missing and here a BLASTn search with a cut-off of e < 1 ×
10-10 was carried out against the draft S. ratti genome.
Identification of aspartic proteases within S. ratti genome
sequence data
The protein sequence of the ASP-1 for C. elegans was used
to search against the nr database using a cut-off of e < 1 ×
10-10. A PSI-BLAST [32] profile was constructed over 4 iterations. This protein profile was then used to search against
the S. ratti genome draft by PSI-tBLASTn. The gene finder
program FGENESH [36] was used to look for possible
aspartic proteases in the genome. These approaches were
used in order to obtain any genomic sequence which may
encode for aspartic protease but not sampled by the cDNA
library or by the pyrosequencing method.
Phylogenetic analyses
The Pfam database http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[37] was
searched for the eukaryotic aspartic protease domain,
PF00026, and all sequences listed under nematode and
human branch of the tree were retrieved. Partial sequences
were once again removed, as well as redundant sequences
and those representing the human cathepsins E (not relevant for the present work). In addition, a rigorous inspection to remove duplicated entries in the database was also
performed. However, some entries were retained where it
was unclear whether they represented duplicated entries
or duplicated genes. Thus, for C. elegans and C. briggsae
aspartic proteases, the 6 well characterised aspartic proteases plus 12 (C. elegans) and 11 (C. briggsae) putative
proteins inferred from cDNA sequences were included in
the sequence analysis. We did not include C. briggsae entry
A8XDC1 which is clearly incomplete. Sequences A8XDB7,
A8XDC0 (ASP-5_ Cb) and A8WZH3 (ASP-4_Cb), were
included in the phylogenetic analysis although we note
there are some doubts regarding the accuracy of these
sequences: for example, the sequence of A8XDC0 may
contain a frame-shift towards the C-terminus. For H. contortus, two entries which has high identity between them
(Q25037 and Q9U8G6) were included in the sequence
analysis. Amino acid alignments were produced from a
total of 68 sequences, and 56 (excluding the human
sequences), including eight from S. ratti with transcript
evidence and 2 inferred by homology in the S. ratti
genome. Alignments were built using the MUSCLE program [38] and manipulated using the JALVIEW program
[39]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by calculation of a protein distance matrix followed by application
of the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA package
[40,41]: gapped regions were excluded in a complete fash-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/611

ion and percentage bootstrap values from 500 replicates
were derived.
5' sequencing by Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE-PCR)
Using the information given in the contig sequences, gene
specific primers were designed to amplify the 5' ends of
asp-2A and asp-2B by RACE-PCR (Additional File 1). 1st
strand cDNA was synthesised as described for pyrosequencing. For second strand synthesis, 0.2 μM SMART
PCR primer (Clontech Laboratories, France) was used
with 0.4 μM gene specific primer to amplify a 200 bp
product for both genes. Each product was purified using
QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Crawley,
UK) and 100 ng sent to MWG-Biotech, Germany for
sequencing.
Analysis of transcription abundance by realtime PCR
(rtPCR) analysis
1st strand cDNA was produced using total RNA from the
different S. ratti life stages following protocols previously
described [10]. Oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for
each aspartic protease gene were designed (Additional File
1) using the Primer Express™ program (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) to amplify a 60-90 bp insert with
an annealing temperature of 60°C. Primers specific for
the small ribosomal subunit S20 (rpl20) gene were also
designed and used as a reference for normalisation of the
data [10]. rtPCR analysis was performed on all samples
using protocols also previously described [10] and for
each life stage the relative abundance of each transcript
was calculated. Three technical replicates were performed
for each gene on all samples. Biological replication was
available for the L1, L2, parasitic females, free living
females and free living males (two replicates each) but not
for the iL3s.
Molecular Modelling
The profile-profile matching server HHPRED [42] was
used to select the most favourable templates for model
building of ASP-2A from the many available aspartic protease structures. It showed that pepsins were the most
closely related available structures followed by renins.
Complexed structures, of human pepsin in complex with
pepstatin (Protein Data Bank [PDB; [43]] code 1pso; [44])
and of mouse renin bound to the decapeptide inhibitor
CH-66 (PDB code 1smr; [45]) were chosen as the principal templates. The pepsin was 38% sequence identical to
ASP-2A, while for renin the figure was 34%. For the bulk
of the ASP-2A model structure both templates were simultaneously used, but they differed in the size of several loop
regions. In those places a single template was used based
on local sequence similarity with ASP-2A. For another
loop a lower-ranked structure, Candida albicans aspartic
proteinase 3 (PDB code 2h6t; [46]) was used to provide a

Page 13 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:611

loop of the same length as ASP-2A. For a further region the
structure of human renin (PDB code 1hrn; [47]) was used
to provide a template where a portion of the mouse renin
structure had not been localised in electron density maps.
The positions of insertions and deletions in ASP-2A with
respect to the templates were inspected and, where necessary, suitably manually repositioned. Templates were
superimposed using SSM [48] and inspected using
PyMOL [49]. Manual adjustments to the HHPREDderived sequence alignments of ASP-2A with templates
were made using JALVIEW [39].
Modelling was carried out with MODELLER 9v5 [50] initially for the ASP-2A sequence lacking the Cys-rich insertion. In the first models it became apparent that Cys217
and Cys350, neither aligning with Cys residues in any of
the templates, were suitably positioned to form a disulphide bridge. This bond was manually specified in a second modelling round during which ten models were
constructed. These derived from a 3Å coordinate randomisation procedure applied to the initial crude model
generated by MODELLER. This is an established method
for exploring conformational space. The stereochemical
quality of the models was assessed with PROCHECK [51]
and the single model without any residues in disallowed
regions of the Ramachandran plot was selected. Constraints on the structure of the Cys-rich insertion that
could help modelling were sought from two sources - predictions of disulphide bonding patterns (based on the reasonable assumption that the Cys residues in the insertion
form intramolecular disulphide bonds in the extracellular
environment) and predicted secondary structure. Disulphide bond predictions were obtained using DiANNA
[17], DISULFIND [52] and PreCys [18]. A secondary structure prediction from PSIPRED [53] was obtained at the
Meta server [54]. These constraints were incorporated into
modelling of the complete ASP-2A sequence using MODELLER.
