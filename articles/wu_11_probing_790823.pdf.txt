Abstract
Background: Our previous studies revealed that a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)
is associated with specific Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) strains. To achieve a better understanding of the
pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains,
selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays.
Results: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island
(PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially
included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were
hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many
polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilusassociated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences
(RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is
proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution.
Conclusions: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains
revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to
better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.

Background
Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe porcine infectious diseases, including arthritis, meningitis, and
pneumonia [1-3]. Virulent strains of SS2 can also be
transmitted to humans (especially abattoir workers and
pork handlers) by direct contact, causing meningitis,
permanent hearing loss, septic shock, and even death.
Two large-scale outbreaks of severe SS2 epidemics
occurred in China in 1998 and 2005, causing great economic losses in the swine industry. These two outbreaks

also posed serious public health risks from the newly
emerging streptococcal toxin shock syndrome (STSS),
which claimed 52 lives [4]. Over the past decade, considerable attention has been given to the study of virulence factors (e.g., CPS, MRP, EF, and suilysin) and the
pathogen-host interaction in this emerging pathogen.
However, comparative studies at the whole-genome
level had little done to decipher the evolutionary aspects
by which the virulence and environmental adaptation of
SS2 are shaped.
To shed light on the evolution of pathogenicity and
potential genomic polymorphisms of SS2, several virulent strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing
and comparative genomic studies. Comparative analysis
of the whole-genomic DNA sequence of the European
S. suis strain P1/7 (by the Sanger Institute) and two
representative highly virulent strains (98HAH12 and
05ZYH33) isolated from STSS patients during the two

epidemic outbreaks in China uncovered a candidate
pathogenicity island (PAI) named 89K, which has been
confirmed to undergo horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
by our recent work [5]. Further analysis based on PCR
amplification revealed that 89K exclusively present in
the epidemic strains in these two Chinese SS2 outbreaks
but not in other domestic clinical isolates or international virulent strains [6]. However, analysis of the
unfinished genomic sequence of SS2 strain 89/1591 (by
the DOE Joint Genome Institute) revealed that a partial
89K sequence (~30 kb) is present in this typical North
American virulent strain. Similarly, results from a
recently published work suggest that S. suis strain
BM407, which was isolated from a human meningitis
case in Vietnam in 2004, contains two regions with
extended similarity to 89K [7]. These findings led us to
hypothesize that the genome of SS2 would be highly
polymorphic among different strains.
In this study, we employed the comparative genome
re-sequencing (CGS) approach developed by Roche
NimbleGen Systems to investigate genomic diversity in
a collection of 18 SS2 strains, including isolates from
the two outbreaks in China, other virulent strains from
China (isolated before these outbreaks), virulent strains
from European countries, and several avirulent strains.
Although CGS cannot identify recently gained genes
due to technical limitations, the DNA microarray-based
comparative genome sequencing technique allows high
resolution detection of sequence polymorphisms based
on a reference genome [8,9]. Using this technology, we
identified a number of novel genetic polymorphisms in
SS2 strains and several candidate virulence factors that
may contribute to STSS. Our results provide new insight
into the virulence mechanisms and genome dynamics of
SS2, which will help to elucidate the evolution of SS2
strains and better monitor the incidence and spread of
epidemic strains.

Results
We used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic
variability of 18 SS2 isolates (Table 1), including five
strains (ZYH214, ZYH215, ZYH354-1, Habb, and
98T003) isolated from STSS patients during the two Chinese SS2 outbreaks, two strains (JR and JZD-1) isolated
from dead pigs during the 2005 outbreak in China, eight
virulent strains isolated from China before the 1998 outbreak (strains 606, 1940, and 1941) or from other countries (strains 607, SS2-N, S735, 8011, and S10), and three
avirulent strains (05HAS68, ZF, and T15). The complete
genome sequence of 05ZYH33 (GenBank accession number NC_009442), a highly virulent strain isolated from a
Chinese STSS patient during the Sichuan outbreak in
2005 [4], is available and was used as the common reference strain for each CGS analysis.

Phylogenetic profiling of the SS2 strains

A total of 299,469 29-mer probes were synthesized
according to the genome sequence of 05ZYH33 to map
the genomic variations of different SS2 strains. The
NimbleGen algorithms assign each probe a ‘1’or ‘0’ status based on the probe signal intensity ratio (reference/
test) to reflect the sequence similarity of the corresponding region. A phylogenetic tree was then drawn
based on the probe status of the entire probe set from
the various SS2 strains (Figure 1). Consequently, the SS2
strains analyzed could be clustered into three major
groups, the eight virulent strains isolated from the two
STSS outbreaks in China were grouped together, and
their genomes were highly similar to one another. The
virulent strains isolated from European, Japan, and
China before the two Chinese STSS outbreaks were
grouped together, except the Netherlands 8011 strain.
Considerable genome variation, however, exists among
members of this group. Strain 8011 formed a single
clade separated from the other virulent and avirulent
strains. The three avirulent strains were clustered into
the third group, and the two isolates from China
(05HAS68 and ZF) were more closely related to each
other than to the avirulent strain T15 isolated from the
Netherlands. The results of phylogenetic profiling
revealed that the virulent strains isolated from the two
STSS outbreaks in China are highly homologous, and
genomic polymorphisms were significant in SS2 populations. In general, the classification of these 18 SS2
strains based on genome similarity and variation, as

revealed by NimbleGen analysis, is in good agreement
with the epidemiological history and differential virulence of these strains.
Polymorphisms in the 89K PAI

In previous studies, the so-called 89K genomic island of
strain 05ZYH33 was considered a candidate PAI of virulent SS2 strains responsible for the two STSS outbreaks
in China and was unique to STSS-causing virulent isolates collected since 1998 [6]. The 89K island is ~89-kb
in length and composed of 80 predicted genes
(SSU05_0903~0982) in the genome of 05ZYH33 (additional file 1). Consistently, our CGS and PCR analysis
revealed that all eight virulent strains isolated from the
two Chinese outbreaks contain the entire 89K fragment,
whereas the international virulent strains SS2-N, S735,
S10, and 607, as well as one strain (1940) isolated in
China before the 1998 outbreak, completely lacks this
element (Figure 2). However, the 89K PAI displays a
considerable number of polymorphisms in the other SS2
strains (Figure 2, 3, &4). Two Chinese strains isolated
before the outbreaks, 606 and 1941, contain a portion
(Region II, SSU05_0917~0933) of the 89K fragment
(Figure 2 &3). A set of primers based on the sequence
of Region II was designed (additional file 2), and the
PCRs with primer pairs P2/P4, P3/P4, P5/P6, P7/P8, and
P7/P9 all generated products of the expected sizes, indicating that the virulent strains 606 and 1941 contain

Page 3 of 12

Region II (Figure 4C). However, a ~1.5-kb amplicon was
also obtained with primer pair P1/P17, suggesting that
Region II in strains 606 and 1941 is found at different
locations with respective to the 89K locus in the genome of 05ZYH33 (Figure 4C).
Virulent strain 8011 and avirulent strain T15, isolated in
the Netherlands, appeared to have a similar polymorphism pattern in the 89K island. Both contain Region IV
(SSU05_0936~0942 in strain 8011 and SSU05_09
38~0942 in strain T15) and Region VI (SSU05_09
61~0982) of the 89K element. This was evident from
the NimbleGen CGS analysis (Figure 2 &3) and confirmed by further PCR analysis (Figure 4D &4E). PCR
amplifications using primer pairs P10/P12, P11/P12, and
P13/P14 for strain 8011, P10/P12, P11/P12, and P13/
P14 for strain T15, and P15/P16 and P15/P17 for both
strains yielded specific products of the expected sizes.
The main difference between these two strains is the
sequence that connects Region IV with VI. A ~1.5-kb
fragment in strain 8011 (Figure 4D) and a 4.5-kb band
in T15 (Figure 4E) was obtained by PCR using primers
P13/P14, respectively. As in the case of strains 606 and
1941, Region IV and VI in strains 8011 and T15 also
reside at different locations than the 89K island in
05ZYH33 because a 1.5-kb PCR product was detected
by primer pair P1/P17 in both strains (Figure 4D &4E).
Avirulent strains 05HAS68 and ZF contain the first
three genes (SSU05_0903~0905) of the 3’-end of the
89K PAI (Figure 2 &3). Further, strains 05HAS68, ZF,
and 1941 appear to possess gene homologs to the
Tn5252-like transposon region (Region VI,
SSU05_0961~0982), though the sequences are less similar to that of the reference strain (Figure 3), which has
been confirmed by shotgun sequencing of 05HAS68
(unpublished data). Together, our data suggest that the
entire 89K island only exists in SS2 strains involved in
the two outbreaks in China, and portions of the 89K
element can be present in other SS2 strains. Additionally, the 89K sequence is highly polymorphic among different SS2 strains, and after thorough analysis, our
results indicate that Region III (SSU05_0934~0935),
Region V (SSU05_0943~0960), and the majority of
Region I (SSU05_0906~0916) are exclusively present in
STSS-causing SS2 strains.
Deletions and significantly variant genes

In addition to the variations of the 89K PAI, the entire
SS2 genome exhibits considerable diversity among different strains (Figure 2). Compared to the reference
05ZYH33 genome, the Chinese STSS-causing strains
contain no obvious deletions or significant gene variances, which is consistent with their epidemiology and
clinical presentation. For two strains (606 and 1941) isolated in China, but before the two STSS outbreaks, and

another two strains (8011 and S10) isolated in the Netherlands, there are no detectable deletions or significantly
variant genes, except for the 89K polymorphisms
described above. However, four major deletions were
identified in the other virulent and avirulent strains (Figure 2). As shown in Table 2, the virulent strain SS2-N
lacks all four regions of differences (RDs), while strains
607 and S735 lack RD1, RD3, and RD4. RD4 is also
absent in virulent strain 1940. Avirulent strain T15 is
devoid of RD1 and RD3, and strains 05HAS68 and ZF
lack RD3 and RD4. The four deletions were all characterized as having direct repeats and deviating GC content at their terminal sequences. Furthermore, RD3 and
RD4 contain mobile genetic elements, such as recombinase and integrase, suggesting that they were acquired
horizontally by strains with these regions present in

their genome. Nevertheless, none of these regions carries known or putative virulence factors.
Compared to the virulent strains, the three avirulent
strains 05HAS68, ZF, and T15 contain additional deletions. A total of 194 genes are absent or display significant sequence variation compared to the reference
strain (Figure 2). Among these 194 genes, 80 encode
hypothetical proteins, and the remaining 114 encode
proteins that are mainly involved in ABC-type transporters, phosphotransferase systems, transcription regulators, carbohydrate metabolism, co-factor biosynthesis,
restriction-modification systems, and cellular surface
structure. Strains 05HAS68 and ZF exhibit a similar
deletion profile, except for three genes (SSU05_02
16~0218) that are present only in ZF. Strains 05HAS68
and T15 exhibit 164 and 119 gene deletions or

significantly variant genes, respectively, including 88
genes shared by all three avirulent strains (additional file
3). The virulence-related epf gene cluster [10,11], which
encodes extracellular protein factor (EF; a putative virulence marker that widely exists in virulent strains) was
absent in the avirulent strains [12]. Consistent with previous research, this gene cluster is present in all of the
analyzed virulent strains. The orphan response regulator
RevS proved to be important for SS2 pathogenesis was
also absent in all three avirulent strains [13]. The roles
of other genes specifically absent in these avirulent
strains in virulence remain unknown. Some of them

may be candidate virulence-related genes, and future
research will focus on the possible role of these genes in
the molecular pathogenesis of SS2.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SS2 strains

Aside from the detected deletions and significantly variant
genes, 23 to 627 SNPs were identified in each of the virulent SS2 strains, but no SNPs were found in the avirulent
strains compared to the 05ZYH33 reference strain (Figure
5). Roche NimbleGen tiling CGS arrays are sensitive to
SNP detection only when the genomic divergence between
the tested and the reference strains is < 0.5%. Thus, the

lack of detected SNPs in the avirulent strains can be
ascribed to the large genomic variations between these
avirulent strains, which have been confirmed by shotgunsequencing of strain 05HAS68 (unpublished data). On the
whole, the identified SNPs in the STSS-causing virulent
strains are significantly less abundant than those in the
other virulent isolates. This result is consistent with the
phylogenetic profiling described above, as well as the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these strains. Analysis of these SNPs is ongoing and is beginning to provide
some explanation for the observed deletions and significantly variant genes.

Discussion
In this study, Roche NimbleGen tiling arrays were used
to detect the genomic diversity among epidemiologically
distinct SS2 strains. One significant finding is the identification of specific genes that are only present in the
STSS-causing strains involved in the two SS2 outbreaks
in China. Previous work suggests that the 89K PAI is
unique to SS2 strains involved in the STSS cases [6].
However, whole genome CGS analysis of 18 SS2 strains
allowed us to carefully examine this island and identify

specific regions that are present in the STSS-causing
strains but not in any other SS2 strains.
We found that portions of the 89K fragment, particularly Regions II, IV, and VI, also exist in some other
virulent and avirulent strains, albeit at different locations. Therefore, this finding cautions against the sole
use of PCR amplification to evaluate the absence of the
89K PAI. Importantly, we found that Regions III, V, and
part of I are exclusively present in the STSS-causing
strains. Recently published work suggests that SS2 strain
BM407, which was isolated from a human meningitis
case in Vietnam, contains two regions with extended
similarity to 89K but lacks most Region V genes [7].
These results indicate that genes within Region V likely
contribute to the high invasiveness of the STSS-causing
strains.
DNA sequencing analysis revealed that Region V
encodes several ABC-type transporters (SSU05_09
45~0949) and regulatory proteins, such as the SalK/R
two-component system (SSU05_0943/0944), which is
essential for full virulence of SS2 strains involved in the
outbreaks in China (though its precise regulatory function remains unclear) [14]. One of the key questions

arising from the two Chinese SS2 outbreaks is what bacterial factors contribute to the STSS that occurred in
many patients. Phenotypic analysis ruled out the implication of super-antigens in the pathogenesis of STSS
[15], and genome analysis has thus far failed to uncover
any homologues of M protein, suggesting that alternative virulence mechanisms might account for the
development of STSS. The ABC transport system

(SSU05_0945~0949) encoded by Region V belongs to a
large family of ABC transporters that export cell waste
products or toxins, surface components, proteins, and
other molecules involved in bacterial pathogenesis (e.g.,
hemolysin, heme-binding proteins, proteases, and peptide antibiotics) [16]. Therefore, participation of this
ABC transport system in the pathogenesis of STSS cannot be excluded and requires further investigation.

virulence genes, that are absent in the three avirulent isolates, which may account for the loss of virulence and provide new insight into the virulence mechanisms of SS2.
Among these absent gene products, PlcR is a major virulence regulator that was first described in the Gram-positive Bacillus group (including B. cereus, B. thuringiensis,
and B. anthracis) [17], which activates the expression of
toxins, hemolysins, phospholipases, proteases, bacteriocins,
transporters, cell wall biogenesis, two-component sensors,
and chemotaxis [18]. Until now, there were no reports
about the role of PlcR in the Streptococcus genus. However, homologues of PlcR are ubiquitous in S. pneumoniae,
S. thermophilus, and S. equi, indicating that this regulator
may be functional in these organisms and a candidate
virulence regulator in SS2.
In addition, lipase is important for bacteria to grow in
carbohydrate-restricted conditions, where lipids are the

sole carbon source, and help bacteria to stick to each
other or to specific host tissues [19]. It has been well
documented that lipase plays a key role in the colonization, dissemination, and adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus [20], Staphylococcus epidermidis [21], and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22]. Based on these observations, it was reasonable to assume that lipase
(SSU05_0325) is also related to the virulence of SS2
strains.
Sortases are responsible for the cleavage of many surface proteins characterized by a C-terminal LPXTG
motif and the linkage of the processed proteins to the
peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall of Gram-positive
bacteria. In the S. suis 05ZYH33 genome, sortase genes
are distributed into four clusters: srtA, srtBCD, srtE, and
srtF, respectively [23]. SrtA is involved in the localization of muramidase-released protein (MRP) and surface
antigen one (Sao) [23,24]. Disruption of srtA impairs the
colonizing potential in specific organs and attenuates

Wu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:219
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/219

the full virulence of S. suis [23,25]. Very recently, the
srtF cluster was proven to be essential for pilus biosynthesis in SS2 [26]. The srtBCD cluster
(SSU05_2096~2103) encodes nine proteins, including
three sortases, three pilus subunits, and three ancillary
proteins [23]. The srtBCD homologues in S. pneumoniae
mediate the assembly and surface topology of adhesive
pili, and deletion of the srtBCD cluster completely prevents pneumococcal pilus biogenesis [27]. Pili have
recently been recognized in Gram-positive pathogens as
important virulence factors involved in adhesion and
invasion [28,29], and they increase pathogenicity in animal models [30,31]. Furthermore, genetic evidence also
demonstrates that the pili of Gram-positive bacteria are
antigenic and protective of immunized animals
[28,29,32]. Given these facts, the absence of srtBCD
cluster from the avirulent strains tested in our study
strongly indicated that the pilus is important for SS2
pathogenesis and could be exploited as an immune target for SS2 infections.
For survival, bacteria have developed a variety of
highly sophisticated and sensitive signal transduction
pathways with which they adapt their gene expression
patterns to meet the challenges of their ever-changing
surroundings [33]. These mechanisms enable bacterial
cells to communicate with their hosts, external environment, and between one another, allowing them to establish specific responses or develop specialized structures
(e.g., biofilms) to ensure their survival, colonization, and
dissemination. In this study, six putative transcriptional
regulators and a response regulator (RevS; SSU05_2090)
in signal transduction pathways were absent from the
avirulent strains. RevS is an orphan response regulator
and plays a role in the pathogenesis of SS2 infections
[13]. The CtsR (SSU05_1976) regulator negatively regulates the expression of class III heat shock genes, which
are required for stress survival, including growth at high
temperature [34]. Although the other transcriptional
regulators remain to be studied, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that they may also be implicated in the
pathogenesis of SS2.
Intriguingly, nearly all of the genes (81 of 88) missing
in the three avirulent strains are also absent in SS2
strain 89/1591, based on the draft genome sequence of
89/1591 (additional file 3). Strain 89/1591 was isolated
from a diseased pig and shown to be virulent in an
experimental infection model [35,36]. It represents a
typical North American virulent strain that lacks three
virulence protein markers (MRP, EF, and suilysin). Here,
we found that 89/1591 also lacks the candidate virulence
genes that are described above, which are typically
found in the European and Chinese virulent strains.
Why is strain 89/1591 still virulent despite the lack of
the virulence genes described above? This dilemma may

Page 9 of 12

be explained by the divergent evolution of 89/1591. The
genome of 89/1591 is significantly different from the
sequenced genomes of Chinese strains 05ZYH33 and
98HAH12, as well as European strain P1/7, containing
deletions and insertions of hundreds of genes (data not
shown). Thus, it appears that strain 89/1591 has evolved
differently and acquired distinct sets of genes that contribute to its virulence, which accounts for its distinct
clinical presentation and epidemiology compared to the
European and Asian strains.
Collectively, our analysis indicates that the SS2 genome is highly polymorphic, which may reflect the organism’s host specificity and clinical manifestation and
provides information on the evolution of this important
pathogen. A recent comparative genomic analysis indicates that gene gain is the major evolutionary force of
streptococcal species, among which S. suis is the greatest
lineage [37]. It is apparent that during the course of
evolution, SS2 strains are under the highest level of
positive selection pressure and have acquired foreign
genes, mainly through the mechanism of HGT (e.g.,
conjugative transposons), to better adapt to host environments. The emergence of a new, highly virulent SS2
strain capable of causing STSS during the two outbreaks
in China is the latest example of such adaptive evolution. Moreover, massive genomic rearrangement is also
attributable to the evolutionary driving force of S. suis
strains, as evidenced by the shotgun sequencing of the
avirulent strain 05HAS68, which shows that large genomic rearrangements occurred between avirulent and
virulent SS2 strains (unpublished data).
Based on the results of the current study, we propose
a model of the microevolution of SS2 strains (Figure 6),
which provides a framework for future investigations.
Although the model remains to be confirmed, it is reasonable to assume that the common ancestor of SS2
underwent significant genomic rearrangements to form
avirulent and virulent populations for the colonization
and exploitation of novel niches. Thereafter, the avirulent and virulent lineages acquired divergent genes to
improve their abilities to survive and evolve independently into the currently prevailing strains.

Conclusions
In this work, significant genomic polymorphisms in SS2
populations were uncovered by the Roche NimbleGen
CGS technique followed by PCR analysis, despite the
fact that this DNA microarray-based method can only
detect known gene sequences. The virulent strains isolated in China during the two STSS outbreaks are highly
homologous, and the other virulent and avirulent strains
are significantly polymorphic, which is consistent with
the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these
strains. The 89K fragment, a candidate PAI in the

differences (RDs and 89 K) are indicated by gray boxes.

Chinese STSS-causing isolates, was found to be partially
included in the other virulent and avirulent strains. In
total, only 15 genes in the 89K PAI are unique to the
STSS-causing strains. The ABC-type export systems
encoded by these genes may represent an alternative
virulence mechanism for the catastrophic features of
toxic shock. In addition, a few presumptive virulence
genes present in the virulent but not avirulent lineage
were characterized. The presence of PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus proteins, the RevS response regulator,
the CtsR regulator, and other transcriptional regulators
may be important in the pathogenicity of SS2.
Our data also indicate that SS2 strains have highly
divergent genomes. During evolution, SS2 strains have
acquired many genes of foreign origin, mainly via
mobile genetic elements, to better adapt to host environments. Moreover, massive genomic rearrangement
appears to be another evolutional force in SS2 strains.
Based on the current study, we propose a model of the
microevolution of SS2 strains, which provides a framework for future investigations. This whole-genome comparative analysis has provided new insight into the
pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 and may contribute
to the development of potential therapies and novel preventive measures to control SS2 infections.

Methods
Bacterial strains, DNA extraction, and labeling

The S. suis strains used in this study are listed in Table
1. The virulent strains were isolated from diseased
patients or swine, and the avirulent strains were isolated
from healthy swine and were identified as avirulent in a
pig model [4,12,14]. Cells were cultured in Todd-Hewitt
broth (THB) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) medium.
Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAGEN Genomic-tip 100/G kit and labeled via random priming reactions. DNA (~1 μg) was mixed with 1 OD of 5’fluorescent dye-labeled random nonamer (Cy3 for the

SS2 strains analyzed and Cy5 for the 05ZYH33 reference
strain) (TriLink Biotechnologies) in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl,
6.25 mM MgCl2, and 0.0875% b-mercaptoethanol, denatured at 98°C for 5 min, chilled on ice, and incubated
with 100 units Klenow fragment (NEB) and dNTP mix
(6 mM each in TE) for 2 h at 37°C. Reactions were terminated with 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), precipitated with
isopropanol, and resuspended in water. A 50-fold amplification was typically achieved.
Mutation mapping microarray design

Mutation mapping microarrays were designed with
NimbleGen algorithms that select a 29-mer oligonucleotide every seven bases on each strand of the reference
genome sequence (GenBank Accession NC_009442). All
probes were synthesized in parallel on a two-array set
using a Digital Light Processor ™ (Texas Instruments,
Plano Texas) and photoprotected phosphoramidite
chemistry (i.e., maskless array synthesis) (NimbleGen
Systems, Madison WI) in a random probe layout
[38,39].
Microarray hybridization

Labeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in NimbleGen hybridization buffer for 16 h at 42°C using a
MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems, Inc. Salt
Lake City, Utah). Labeled genomic DNA (~5 μg) from
the 05ZYH33 reference strain and from each tested strain
were co-hybridized to each array. Arrays were washed
with NimbleGen wash buffer, spun dry in a high-speed
microarray centrifuge (TeleChem International, Inc.,
Sunnyvale, CA), and stored until they were scanned.
Analysis of mapping array data and design and
hybridization of re-sequencing microarrays

Microarrays were scanned at 5-μm resolution using a
Genepix ® 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union
City CA), and pixel intensities were extracted using

Wu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:219
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/219

NimbleScan™ v2.4 software (NimbleGen). Probes that
spanned potential mutations were identified by NimbleGen software. Probe sequences corresponding to all
possible candidate mutation sites were selected for resequencing. The strategy used to automatically generate
the sequencing arrays was similar to that described previously [9]. Briefly, eight probes were designed per base
position analyzed, i.e., four per genome strand. These
probes contain all possible alleles at a centrally located
position. The length, melting temperature, and mismatch position of each probe were optimized. When
target DNA is hybridized to these arrays, the perfectly
matched probe will hybridize more strongly than the
three corresponding mismatch probes for each strand.
This differential signal intensity between the perfect
match probe and mismatch probes allows the base to be
determined precisely. These re-sequencing arrays were
synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from
each tested SS2 strain, and scanned as above. Sequence
base assignments were made using a machine-learning
algorithm [40]. Putative mutation-containing DNA segments were PCR amplified and verified by capillary
sequencing. The microarray data was deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene
Expression Omnibus Database (GEO; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/), with the accession number of
GSE17868.
Phylogenetic profile analysis

According to NimbleGen algorithms, each probe was
assigned a binary profile (1 or 0) based on the probe signal intensity ratio (reference/test) to evaluate its presence/absence across different strains. The gene profiles
were then clustered, and the strains were grouped based
on the similarity of gene profiles. A maximum parsimony tree for SS2 strains was constructed using PHYLIP version 3.68 http://evolution.genetics.washington.
edu/phylip.html based on the results of a bootstrapping
test of strain phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree was
visualized using TREEVIEW.
