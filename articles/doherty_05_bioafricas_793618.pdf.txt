Abstract
Most Internet online resources for investigating HIV biology contain either bioinformatics tools,
protein information or sequence data. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive
online proteomics resource that integrates bioinformatics with the latest information on HIV-1
protein structure, gene expression, post-transcriptional/post-translational modification, functional
activity, and protein-macromolecule interactions. The BioAfrica HIV-1 Proteomics Resource http:/
/bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/proteomics/index.html is a website that contains detailed information about
the HIV-1 proteome and protease cleavage sites, as well as data-mining tools that can be used to
manipulate and query protein sequence data, a BLAST tool for initiating structural analyses of HIV1 proteins, and a proteomics tools directory. The Proteome section contains extensive data on
each of 19 HIV-1 proteins, including their functional properties, a sample analysis of HIV-1HXB2,
structural models and links to other online resources. The HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Sites section
provides information on the position, subtype variation and genetic evolution of Gag, Gag-Pol and
Nef cleavage sites. The HIV-1 Protein Data-mining Tool includes a set of 27 group M (subtypes A
through K) reference sequences that can be used to assess the influence of genetic variation on
immunological and functional domains of the protein. The BLAST Structure Tool identifies proteins
with similar, experimentally determined topologies, and the Tools Directory provides a
categorized list of websites and relevant software programs. This combined database and software
repository is designed to facilitate the capture, retrieval and analysis of HIV-1 protein data, and to
convert it into clinically useful information relating to the pathogenesis, transmission and
therapeutic response of different HIV-1 variants. The HIV-1 Proteomics Resource is readily
accessible through the BioAfrica website at: http://bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/proteomics/index.html

Background
Although the HIV-1 genome contains only 9 genes, it is
capable of generating more than 19 gene products. These

products can be divided into three major categories: structural and enzymatic (Gag, Pol, Env); immediate-early regulatory (Tat, Rev and Nef), and late regulatory (Vif, Vpu,

Page 1 of 14

Retrovirology 2005, 2:18

Vpr) proteins. Tat, Rev and Nef are synthesized from small
multiply-spliced mRNAs; Env, Vif, Vpu and Vpr are generated from singly-spliced mRNAs, the Gag and Gag-Pol
precursor polyproteins are synthesized from full-length
mRNA. The matrix (p17), capsid (p24) and nucleocapsid
(p7) proteins are produced by protease cleavage of Gag
and Gag-Pol, a fusion protein derived by ribosomal
frame-shifting. Cleavage of Nef generates two different
protein isoforms; one myristylated, the other non-myristylated. The viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase) are formed by protease
cleavage of Gag-Pol. Alternative splicing, together with cotranslational and post-translational modification, leads to
additional protein variability [1].
Phylogenetic analysis, on its own, provides little information about the conformational, immunological and functional properties of HIV-1 proteins, but instead, focuses
on the evolution and historical significance of sequence
variants. To understand the clinical significance of genetic
variation, sequence analysis needs to be combined with
methods that assess change in the structural and biological properties of HIV-1 proteins. At present, information
and tools for the systematic analysis of HIV-1 proteins are
limited, and are scattered across a wide-range of online
resources [2,3]. To facilitate studies of the biological consequences of genetic variation, we have developed an integrated, user-friendly proteomics resource that integrates
common approaches to HIV-1 protein analysis (Figure 1).
We are currently using this resource to better understand
the structure-function relationships underlying the emergence of antiretroviral drug resistance, and to examine the
process of immune escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
(CTLs).
We have categorized the Proteomics Resource into the following main subject headings (Figure 2 &3):
1. HIV Proteome – Information about structure and
sequence, as well as references and tutorials, for each of
the HIV-1 proteins (Figure 4);
2. HIV-1 Cleavage Sites – Information about the position
and sequence of HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef cleavage sites
(Figure 5);
3. HIV Protein Data Mining Tool – Application for detecting the characteristics of HIV-1 M group isolate (subtype
A to K) proteins using information available in public
databases and tools (Figure 6);
4. HIV Structure BLAST – Similarity search for analyzing
HIV protein sequences with corresponding structural data
(Figure 7);

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/18

5. Proteomics Online Tools – Directory of data resources
and tools available for both protein sequence and protein
structure analyses of HIV (Figure 8 &9).

The proteome link
In the HIV-1 Proteome section, each of the 19 HIV-1 proteins has a webpage that is divided into six parts: "general
overview", "genomic location", "domains/folds/motifs",
"protein-macromolecule interactions", "primary and secondary database entries", and "references and recommended readings" (Figure 4). The overview includes a
description of the protein, a list of known isoforms, a representative tertiary structure animated image (GIF format)
of the protein and its co-ordinates (PDB format), a link to
chime tutorials, if available, and information about cleavage sites, localization, and functional activity. The
genomic location section provides information on the
location of the sequence relative to the reference
sequence, HIV-1HXB2 [4], sequence data (fasta format),
and information about the length, molecular weight and
theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of the protein. The
domains/folds/motifs section contains information
about functional domains and predicted motifs (glycosylation, myristoylation, amidation, phosphorylation and
cell attachment sites) of HIV-1HXB2 [4], and provides structural predictions (secondary structure, transmembrane
regions, low complexity regions, and coiled-coil regions).
The section on protein-macromolecule interactions
includes information on protein complexes, protein-protein/DNA/RNA interactions, signal-transduction pathways, and potential interactions with other pathogens.
The section on primary and secondary databases contains
a list of database entries that are needed to retrieve information on protein structure, nucleotide/amino acid
sequence data, protein sequence annotation, proteins
with similar sequence and structure (such as Los Alamos
National Laboratories HIV Sequence Database and the
RCSB Protein Data Bank), as well as information on posttranslational modification and protein-protein interactions. A list of key reviews and publications, used in the
development of the BioAfrica HIV-1 Proteomics Resource,
is provided in the references and recommended readings
section. As an example, the proteome webpage for Tat,
describes how this protein up-regulates HIV-1 gene
expression by interacting with the long-terminal repeat
(LTR) of HIV-1, promoting the elongation phase of viral
transcription, allowing full-length HIV-1 mRNA transcripts to be produced [5,6] (Figure 10). The webpage also
gives information on the structural organization of tat
gene. The mRNA is derived from spliced exons encoded in
two different open reading frames. In HIV-1HXB2, these
reading frames are separated by a distance of 2334 nucleotides. Some HIV-1 isolates, including HIV-1HXB2, contain
an artifact of laboratory strains consisting of a premature
stop codon at position 8424 of exon 2. The presence of

this stop codon leads to the synthesis of a truncated form
of Tat that is 86, rather than 101 amino acids in length.
The protein has two different isoforms – one translated
from early-stage multiply spliced mRNA (p14); the other
from singly-spliced mRNA (p16) [7]. Important functional domains include the acidic, amphipathic region (1MEPVDPRLEPWKHPGSQPKTA-21; the hydrophobic residues are highlighted in bold, and polar residues are italicized) at the N-terminus of the protein; the cysteine-rich
disulphide bond region (22-CTNCYCKKCCFHCQVC37); the core, basic and glutamine-rich region (49-RKKRRQRRRAHQNSQTHQASLSKQ-72) that is important for
nuclear localization and TAR-binding activity, and the
RGD cell-attachment site that binds to cellular integrins.
In addition to being expressed in HIV-1-infected cells, Tat
is also released into the extracellular fluid where it acts as

a growth factor for the development of Kaposi's Sarcoma.
Additional information about Tat and its protein-protein
interactions can be found on the proteome page of the
BioAfrica website located at http://bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/
proteomics/TATprot.html.

Protease cleavage sites link
Post-translational cleavage of the Gag, Gag-Pol and Nef
precursor proteins occurs at the cell membrane during virion packaging, and is essential to the production of infectious viral particles. Drugs that inhibit this process, the
protease inhibitors (PIs), are the most potent antiretroviral agents currently available. Thus it is important to collect information, not only on the sequence of protease
enzymes from different HIV-1 subtypes, but also on the
natural polymorphisms and resistance mutations that

may effect their catalytic activities, drug responsiveness,
substrate specificities, and cleavage site characteristics.
Studies have shown that resistance mutations in the protease of subtype B are associated with impaired proteolytic
processing and decreased enzymatic activity, and that
compensatory mutations at Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage
sites can partially overcome these defects [8]. These findings suggest that variation at protease cleavage sites may
play an important role, not only in regulation of the viral
life cycle, but also in disease progression and response to
therapy.
The cleavage site section of the BioAfrica webpage is the
direct extension of a recent publication in the Journal of

Virology describing the location and variability of protease cleavage sites [9] (Figure 5). Together, these two
resources provide information on the structure, amino
acid composition, genetic variation and evolutionary history of protease cleavage sites, and on the natural selection
pressures exerted on these sites. The section also serves as
a baseline for understanding the impact of natural
polymorphisms and resistance mutations on the catalytic
efficiency of the protease enzyme, and on its ability to recognize and cleave individual Gag, Gag-Pol and Nef substrates. Such studies are important for understanding the
mechanisms underlying the emergence of PI-induced
drug resistance, and for designing alternative, optimized
therapies.

Protein data-mining tools link
The HIV-1 Protein Data-Mining Tool contains twelve
sequence analysis techniques for assessing protein
variability among different strains of HIV-1 (Figure 6).
These tools allow the user to manipulate, analyze and
compare published [9-12] and newly-acquired data in a
user-friendly, hands-on manner. The analysis is initiated
by selecting a particular subset of HIV-1 proteins, either
from the user's database, or from the representative dataset of group M viruses (subtypes A through K). Using this
dataset, the investigator can then perform a variety of protein-specific analyses. With a single click of the mouse,
users can download the amino acid sequence in fasta format; obtain sequence annotations from SwissProt [13] or
GenBank [14]; identify functional motifs using BLOCKS

[15], PROSITE [16] or ProDom [17]; perform similarity
searches using the BLAST program available at Genbank
[18], conduct structural comparisons using the BioAfrica
BLAST Structure program; determine amino acid composition, predict hydrophobicity and tertiary structure using
the Swiss-Model homology modelling server [19], and
obtain a list of potential protein-macromolecule interactions from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)
[20]. A representative analysis of HIV-1 Tat is shown in
Additional file 1. The selected dataset, consisting of eight
reference strains – four subtype B (HXB2-1983-France, RF1983-US, JRFL-1986-US, WEAU160-1990-US) and four
subtype C (92BR025-1992-Brazil, 96BW0502-1996-Botswana, TV002c12-1998-SouthAfrica, TV001c8.5-1998SouthAfrica) isolates – were analyzed using PROSITE

[16]. As shown in Additional file 1, all eight isolates had
identical amidation, cysteine-rich and myristylation
motifs at amino acid codons 47–50, 22–37 and 44–49,
respectively. Three (75%) of the B isolates contained a second myristylation site at codons 42–47, as did three
(75%) subtype C viruses. One (25%) of the C viruses carried an extra GNptGS myristylation motif at position 79–
84. In addition, all four (100%) C isolates contained a
novel myristylation motif, GSeeSK, at amino acid position
83–88, that was not present in four B viruses selected for
study. However, the most striking difference between the
two subtypes was the increased number of phosphorylation motifs in subtype C relative to B viruses. This
increase, which occurs in cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinase,
protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase II (CKII) phos-

phorylation sites, has been reported previously [21], but
the significance of these findings remain to be established.
The analysis also highlighted the atypical nature of the
HIV-1HXB2 isolate, which, in addition to a premature stop
codon, contained no cAMP/cGMP, PKC or CKII phosphorylation sites.

The blast structure tool link
The HIV-1 BLAST Structure Tool facilitates the analysis of
HIV-1 protein structure by allowing for rapid retrieval of
archived structural data stored in the public databases
(Figure 7). Users may input any HIV-1 amino acid
sequence and obtain a list of similar HIV protein
sequences for which structural data have been experimentally determined and deposited into the Protein Data

PDB, subsequent structural analyses can be performed
using the software programs and web-servers listed in the
Proteomics Tools Directory. For example, a query using an
amino acid sequence of HIV-1 Integrase protein from
NCBI (gi|15553624|gb|AAL01959.1) results in a list of 54
structural models (ie. PDB_ID|1K6Y) within the PDB.
Each of these structural models can be retrieved from the
PDB, and the most appropriate structural model could be
used for generating a homology model using the query
protein sequence.

The proteomics tools directory link
The HIV-1 Proteomics Tools Directory is divided into two
web pages. The initial webpage is a concise compilation of

some of the most commonly used protein-specific Internet resources (Figure 8). This "beginners" page displays a
short list of websites for each of the following twelve categories: "protein databases", "specialized viral-protein
databases", "motif and transcription factor databases",
"protein sequence similarity searches", "protein sequence
alignment", "protein sequence prediction tools", "protein
sequence analysis", "protein sequence manipulation",
"protein structure analysis", "molecular modelling tools",
"tutorials", and "downloads". In addition, the Proteomics
Tools Directory has an advanced web page for users who
are looking for alternative, or more specialized, protein
analysis tools (Figure 9). The advanced webpage displays
a list of more than 200 links to different websites and
web-servers. These data sources contain a variety of

Conclusion
The impending rollout of antiretroviral therapy to millions of HIV-1-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa provides a unique opportunity to monitor the efficacy of nonB treatment programs from their very inception, and to
obtain critical new information for the optimization of
treatment strategies that are safe, affordable and appropriate for the developing world. An integral part of this
massive humanitarian effort will be the collection of large
amounts of clinical and laboratory data, including genetic

information on viral subtype and resistance mutations, as
well as routine CD4+ T-cell counts and viral load measurements. The mere collection of this data, however, does
not ensure that it will be used to its maximum potential.
To achieve full benefit from this explosive source of new
information, the data will need to be appropriately collated, stored, analyzed and interpreted.
The rapidly emerging field of Bioinformatics has the
capacity to greatly enhance treatment (and vaccine) efforts
by serving as a bridge between Medical Informatics and
Experimental Science. By correlating genetic variation and
potential changes in protein structure with clinical risk
factors, disease presentation, and differential response to
treatment and vaccine candidates, it may be possible to

obtain valuable new insights that can be used to support
and guide rationale decision-making, both at the clinical
and public health levels. The HIV-1 Proteomics Resource,
described in this report, is an initial first step in the development of improved methods for extracting and analyzing genomics data, converting it into biologically useful
information related to the structure, function and physiology of HIV-1 proteins, and for assessing the role these proteins play in disease progression and response to therapy.
The Resource, developed at the Molecular Virology and
Bioinformatics Unit of the Africa Centre of Health and
Population Studies, is a centralized user-friendly database
that is easily accessed through the BioAfrica website at
