Abstract
Background: Two processes may contribute to the formation of global centers of biodiversity:
elevated local speciation rates (the center of origin hypothesis), and greater accumulation of species
formed elsewhere (the center of accumulation hypothesis). The relative importance of these
processes has long intrigued marine biogeographers but rarely has been tested.
Results: To examine how origin and accumulation affected the Greater Caribbean center of
diversity, we conducted a range-wide survey of mtDNA cytochrome b in the widespread Atlantic
reef damselfish Chromis multilineata (N = 183) that included 10 locations in all four tropical Atlantic
biogeographic provinces: the Greater Caribbean, Brazil, the mid-Atlantic ridge, and the tropical
eastern Atlantic. We analyzed this data and re-evaluated published genetic data from other reef fish
taxa (wrasses and parrotfishes) to resolve the origin and dispersal of mtDNA lineages. Parsimony
networks, mismatch distributions and phylogenetic analyses identify the Caribbean population of C.
multilineata as the oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the circum-Atlantic
radiation of this species. However, some Caribbean haplotypes in this species were derived from
Brazilian lineages, indicating that mtDNA diversity has not only originated but also accumulated in
the Greater Caribbean. Data from the wrasses and parrotfishes indicate an origin in the Greater
Caribbean in one case, Caribbean origin plus accumulation in another, and accumulation in the
remaining two.
Conclusion: Our analyses indicate that the Greater Caribbean marine biodiversity hotspot did
not arise through the action of a single mode of evolutionary change. Reef fish distributions at the
boundaries between Caribbean and Brazilian provinces (the SE Caribbean and NE Brazil,
respectively) indicate that the microevolutionary patterns we detected in C. multilineata and other
reef fishes translate into macroevolutionary processes and that origin and accumulation have acted
in concert to form the Greater Caribbean biodiversity hotspot.

Background
The extremely high biodiversity at the two global coral
reef hotspots – the Indo-Malay Archipelago (IMA, also

known as the Coral Triangle) in the Indo-Pacific, and the
Greater Caribbean (GC) region in the Atlantic – has long
intrigued marine biologists [1-8]. Two primary hypothePage 1 of 16

ses have been proposed to explain such richness and the
corresponding biodiversity gradients moving away from
those regions: the center of origin (CO) hypothesis, introduced by Darwin as "centers of creation" [9], proposes
that species originate in the center and disperse to the
periphery, and the high central diversity arises through insitu speciation [10]. According to Briggs, the most prominent contemporary supporter of this hypothesis, centers
of diversity "act as centers of evolutionary radiation and
supply species to other areas that are less effective in an
evolutionary sense" [10-12]. Evidence from recent phylogenetic [13] and species-distribution surveys [10,14] support the CO model for the IMA. In contrast, the center of
accumulation (CA) hypothesis proposes that diversity
centers accumulate species that originated elsewhere. The
IMA lies on the western boundary of the Pacific and westward flowing ocean currents could transport the pelagic
larvae of species originating anywhere in the Pacific to the
IMA [15,16]. A recent analysis of reef fish and coral distributions in the Indian and Pacific Oceans concluded that
deviations from a random species-richness pattern predicted by a mid-domain model are consistent with this
hypothesis [17].
Genetic surveys of sea urchins, marine gastropods and
cowries in the Indo-Pacific indicate that species formation
has occurred throughout the region [4,18,19], both inside
the center of diversity (supporting the CO hypothesis)
and outside the IMA (supporting the CA hypothesis).
Likewise, the reef fish genera Thalassoma and Halichoeres
display no clear pattern, as ancient and recent species
occur both in the IMA and elsewhere in the Pacific
[20,21]. These and other studies have led to the proposition that both origin and accumulation of species contribute to the high diversity of the IMA [5,6,19,21].
Patterns of genetic variation within widely distributed
species can offer clues that may indicate how origin and
accumulation contribute to a center of diversity [22].
There are four ways in which intra-specific genetic variation can contribute pertinent information: (i) Resolution
of the geographic locations of both phylogenetically
ancestral or basal DNA sequences (haplotypes) and recent
or derived haplotypes. Under a CO scenario, basal lineages should be found at the center of diversity. In contrast,
the restriction of ancestral haplotypes to peripheral populations would support the CA model. (ii) Patterns of variation in genetic diversity throughout the species range
could also be informative. Under the CO hypothesis,
higher haplotype and nucleotide diversities should occur
in the diversity centers, but away from the center under
the CA hypothesis. Note, however, that the value of such
evidence is limited because at equilibrium, the largest
population will have the highest diversity, regardless of
age. Further, (iii) mismatch distributions and population

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/157

genetic analyses may offer other useful clues about the
geography of origination and subsequent dispersal: in
old, widely distributed species, basal haplotypes (which
assume an interior position in parsimony networks) and
derived haplotypes (peripherally located in parsimony
networks) may occur in all populations. However, if the
species recently expanded its range the younger populations would be less variable, may exhibit star-like parsimony networks with a few very common haplotypes and
many rare haplotypes, and would have a Poisson-like mismatch distribution [23-25]. Finally, (iv) direction of
migration can also be informative: gene flow away from
the center to the periphery would support the CO hypothesis whereas the reverse flow would favor CA [26].
While attention has been focused on evolutionary mechanisms producing the Indo-Pacific center of diversity, the
CO and CA hypotheses have never been tested in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The tropical Atlantic is an appropriate
forum for such a test because geographically and oceanographically it is a much simpler system than the western
Pacific, and, due to its isolation from the Indo-Pacific,
allows independent tests of the proposed mechanisms of
diversity production. This area comprises four tropical
biogeographic provinces: the Greater Caribbean (the Caribbean itself, the Antilles, the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the
Bahamas and Bermuda); Brazil (the coastline and oceanic
islands south of the Equator to 28°S); the mid-Atlantic
ridge (Ascension and St. Helena islands), and the tropical
eastern Atlantic (from Cape Verde to Angola, including
Cape Verde and the Islands in the Gulf of Guinea) [27,28]
(Fig. 1). Geologically the mid-Atlantic ridge includes St.
Paul's rocks (off northeastern Brazil) as well as Ascension
and St. Helena. However, effects of geographic proximity
mandate that the shore fishes of St. Paul's are more closely
related to the Brazilian fauna [29].
The biogeographic barriers separating these provinces
include vast geographic and oceanic distances lacking
suitable habitat: the northeastern South American coast is
heavily influenced by freshwater outflow, and there is no
coral reef development in the 2,300 km wide area
between the Amazon's mouth and Trinidad & Tobago; the
eastern and western Atlantic, as well as the central Atlantic
islands, are separated from the other provinces by thousands of kilometers of deep open ocean [28,30]. Previous
mtDNA surveys of reef fishes and sea urchins have
revealed deep phylogenetic breaks among these four tropical biogeographic provinces [20,31,32], as well as the
existence of some species that can apparently transcend
some of the barriers through dispersal of pelagic larval
and juvenile stages [33-38].
Here we analyze patterns of genetic diversity based on
mtDNA sequences in a common, widespread Atlantic reef

fish – the brown chromis (Chromis multilineata) across all
four tropical Atlantic biogeographic provinces. The combination of this transatlantic distribution and the lack of
a marked genetic break between populations in the two
western Atlantic provinces (see Results) makes it a good
candidate to study the roles of origin versus accumulation
in explaining high species diversity in the Greater Caribbean. Additionally, we re-evaluated data from four species
groups, published in two previous studies of Atlantic reef
fishes [36,38] that reported genetic lineages shared by Brazil and the Caribbean. Our main objectives were: 1) to
search for signatures of origin vs. accumulation of genetic
diversity in the Greater Caribbean, which is the Atlantic
center of diversity for tropical reef organisms; and 2) to
assess how the barriers between major biogeographic
provinces influence the population structure of C. multilineata, a widely distributed reef fish with a relatively short
pelagic larval stage.

Results
An 802 bp segment from the cytochrome b gene was analyzed for 183 individuals obtained from ten locations
(Fig. 1) spanning the entire geographical range of Chromis
multilineata on both sides of the tropical Atlantic. A total
of 121 polymorphic sites distributed among 132 haplotypes were identified for those individuals. Mean nucleotide frequencies were A = 0.24, C = 0.35, G = 0.15, T =
0.26. The transition – transversion ratio was 8.8:1. Average pairwise distances between populations ranged from
0.01 to 1.8 mean nucleotide substitutions (d = 0.001% to
0.22% sequence divergence) within the western/central
Atlantic, and from 7.1 to 7.9 mean nucleotide substitutions (d = 0.88% to 0.98% sequence divergence) between
the eastern Atlantic and the other three provinces. Haplotype diversity (h) in C. multilineata was very high, with
unique haplotypes present in 71.8% of the individuals.
Populations in Caribbean, in Brazil and in the central
Atlantic each had slightly higher haplotype diversity (h =
0.92 – 1.0), than the tropical eastern Atlantic populations

(h = 0.81 – 0.92), although those differences are not statistically significant. Nucleotide diversity (π) was low in
all populations, but highest (although not significantly
higher) in the Caribbean (Table 1).
Within each of the four biogeographical provinces, pairwise population differentiation (ΦST) values are very close
to zero and not significant indicating extensive gene flow
among locations (Table 2). Significant population separations (ΦST = 0.033 – 0.21) were observed between Caribbean and South Atlantic (Brazil and Central Atlantic
Islands) populations, whereas no significant differences
were observed between the Brazilian and Central Atlantic
provinces. Interestingly, connections between the southern Caribbean locations (Panama and Grenada) and the
South Atlantic were stronger than those between St. Croix
(central Caribbean) and the South Atlantic (Table 2). All
comparisons between East and West/Central Atlantic populations were significant (ΦST = 0.621 – 0.740), reflecting
an evolutionary genetic partition (sequence divergence d
= 0.88% – 0.98%). AMOVA analysis (Table 3) shows that
divergence between the E Atlantic and the remaining
provinces accounted for 56.2% of the total molecular variance. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the ancestral
mtDNA lineages are located in the Caribbean (red
branches in Fig. 2, red circles in Fig. 3).
Demographic history was assessed through analysis of
pairwise mismatch distributions of all populations (Fig.
4). Caribbean populations have the wider mismatch distributions (13–15 mutations), followed by the Brazilian/
Central Atlantic populations (8–10 mutations), then the
eastern Atlantic populations (5–7 mutations). Pairwise

mismatch distributions (Fig. 5) were not significantly different from values expected under a model of population
expansion [39], except for the population at St. Paul's
Rocks. Fu's Fs and the Ramos-Onsins and Rozas's R2 also
yield a significant signal for population expansion at all
locations except St. Paul's Rocks (Table 1). The coalescence analysis revealed that mutational time (τ) values
were similar for western and central Atlantic populations
and lower for the eastern Atlantic. Population sizes greater
than zero before expansion (θ0) were only observed in the
Caribbean (Table 1), possibly indicating an older age for
this population.
Due to the lack of genetic differences among each of the
three Brazilian samples (Paraiba, Cabo Frio and St. Paul's
Rocks), among each of the three Caribbean samples (Panama, Grenada and St. Croix), between the two mid-Atlantic locations (Ascension and St. Helena), and between the
two eastern Atlantic locations (Cape Verde and Sao
Tome), data from each group were combined to calculate
bidirectional migration rates among the four provinces.
Our analysis shows much migration from both Brazil and
the Central Atlantic to the GC, but little in the reverse
direction, and virtually none between the western/central
Atlantic and eastern Atlantic (the value for this last comparison in Fig. 4 is effectively zero).
In addition to the Chromis multilineata analysis, we built
maximum parsimony networks (Fig. 6) using previously
published data from the reef fish genera Halichoeres [36]
and Sparisoma [38]. In Fig. 6a, the network of H. bivittatus
indicates migration from Brazil to the Caribbean. In Fig.
6b, individuals of H. radiatus from the Brazilian oceanic

islands are derived from the Caribbean group, indicating
migration in the reverse direction, with the Caribbean
becoming a center of origin. The two Sparisoma networks
(Fig. 6c and 6d) show that populations and species
restricted to the SE corner of the Caribbean are closely
related to the Brazilian form.

Discussion
Phylogeography of the brown Chromis
Previous genetic surveys of reef organisms in the tropical
Atlantic have produced a mosaic of outcomes in terms of
the levels of separation among different provinces, with
virtually every conceivable pattern being evident [40]. The
short-spined sea urchin (genus Tripneustes), the red lip
blenny (genus Ophioblennius), and some wrasses of the
genera Thalassoma and Halichoeres show deep genetic
breaks (d = 2.0% – 12.7% in mitochondrial DNA coding
regions) that correspond to the four major tropical Atlantic biogeographic provinces [20,31,32,41]. In the ocean
surgeonfish (Acanthurus bahianus), GC populations are
separated from those in Brazil and the central Atlantic by
an mtDNA sequence divergence of d = 2.4%, but no dif-

ference is observed between populations at Brazil and the
mid-Atlantic islands [34]. Other species show little differentiation throughout the tropical W Atlantic (doctorfish,
A. chirurgus; pygmy angelfish, genus Centropyge; goldspot
goby, Gnatholepis thompsoni [34,35,42]), or even throughout the entire tropical Atlantic (blackbar soldierfish,
Myripristis jacobus [37]). In contrast, at the lower end of the
spatial scale, some species of wrasses (genus Halichoeres)
and cleaner gobies (genus Elacatinus) show deep genetic
breaks and reciprocally monophyletic groups on a scale of
tens of km within the GC [36,43,44].
In C. multilineata, three levels of genetic diversity were
observed: First, the tropical eastern Atlantic populations
formed a monophyletic group, separated from all other
populations by at least seven diagnostic mutations. Second, there was a significant shift in haplotype frequencies
between the GC and the South Atlantic (Brazil + central
Atlantic islands) indicating population breaks between
the GC and those two provinces (Table 2). Third, there
was no detectable genetic difference between the Brazilian
and central Atlantic populations. The pattern that emerges

from most Atlantic phylogeography studies is that when
deep divergences are present, they generally correspond to
the major biogeographic provinces, although there are
notable instances of strong within-province differentiation (e.g.: gobies and wrasses within both the GC and Brazil [36,43,45]).
In the brown chromis and other reef organisms, the divergence between the eastern Atlantic and the remaining
populations (Table 2) may be explained by 1,700 km or
more (the shorter straight line distances between the eastern Atlantic and the western/central Atlantic populations
are ~1,700 km between St. Paul's Rocks and Cape Verde,
~2,300 km between St. Helena and Sao Tome and ~2,500
km between Ascension and Sao Tome) of unsuitable
open-ocean distances, combined with the general east to
west direction of prevailing currents at low latitudes.
While low but significant pairwise comparisons were
observed between the two provinces of the South Atlantic
(Brazil and the central Atlantic) and the Caribbean, separated by no more than 2,300 km, no difference was
observed between Brazil and the central Atlantic Islands,
separated by 2,200 km.

Low genetic structure, such as that seen in C multilineata
might be expected in organisms with a long pelagic larval
stage [34,37] and a similar signal has been observed in the
long-spined sea urchin, genus Diadema with a ~6 week larval stage [33] and the ocean surgeonfish, Acanthurus bahianus, which has a larval duration of ~60 days [34]. C.
multilineata, however, has a relatively short pelagic larval
stage averaging 27 days (33 days maximum [46]), which
is substantially less than the average time (48 days based
on average current velocity) to cross from Brazil to the
mid-Atlantic [47]. However, juvenile C. multilineata have
been observed in association with floating debris in Belize
(L. A. Rocha pers. obs.), and juvenile Chromis atrilobata (C.
multilineata's sister species in the eastern Pacific) have
been observed in open water under floating objects
[48,49]; D. R. Robertson pers. obs.). Thus, young C. multilineata juveniles survive in the open ocean long after
transforming from the larval stage, and relatively strong
tropical currents connecting the mid-Atlantic islands and
Brazil may transport juvenile Chromis between those locations [50,51]. Transport from the western and central
Atlantic to the eastern Atlantic evidently has been much
less frequent, probably due to larger distances involved in
direct transport from W to E Atlantic and smaller source

populations for dispersal from the tiny central Atlantic
islands (Ascension, St. Helena) to the eastern Atlantic.
The mismatch distribution analysis (Fig. 5), RamosOnsins and Rozas's R2 test for recent population expansion and Fu's Fs neutrality test (Table 1) indicate that all
populations have undergone a recent expansion, except
for that at the diminutive St. Paul's Rocks. This expansion
was probably caused by the ~10 fold increase in suitable
shallow reef habitat associated with the sea-level rise of
~130 m since the last glacial maximum [52]. St. Paul's
Rocks is an exception: because there is no shelf at that
island, which is a pillar rising vertically from deep water
[29], available habitat probably hasn't increased with sealevel rise. Thus the lack of an expansion signal may reflect
a relatively constant population size due to stability in
habitat availability. The lower number of pairwise differences, and haplotype and nucleotide diversities observed
at Cape Verde and Sao Tome in the eastern Atlantic, indicate a more recent expansion at those locations than in the
western and central Atlantic. In addition to lower sea-levels and corresponding reduced habitat available during

the last glacial period in the eastern Atlantic, water temperatures in that area were lowered more than in the western and central Atlantic by enhanced coastal upwelling
[53], a stress on tropical species that may have caused
strong fluctuations or reductions in population size.
Migration patterns among populations (Fig. 4) are consistent with the general direction of surface current flows
(Fig. 1): the highest rates are from the South Atlantic to
the Caribbean (coinciding with the flow of the North Brazil current) and from Brazil to the mid-Atlantic islands
(coinciding with the flow of the South Atlantic Gyre). In
accordance with the phylogenetic results, migration
between western and eastern Atlantic (a direction that
opposes major surface currents; Fig. 1) was effectively
zero.
The Greater Caribbean hotspot: center of origin and

accumulation, the short (i.e. relatively young) branches
are mostly in Brazil and the central Atlantic islands (in Fig.
2 ~75% of the short branches are blue, endemic to Brazil
and the two mid-Atlantic islands). However, the short
branches also include a few Caribbean haplotypes (~25%
of short branches in the mostly South Atlantic lineage in
Fig. 2), indicating that the lineages diversified in the South
Atlantic, and that individuals carrying those haplotypes
recently arrived in the Caribbean. This South to North pattern of dispersal is consistent with the pattern of oceanic
current flow (Fig. 1) and migration rates (Fig. 4), and indicates that the hotspot of diversity in the Caribbean has
acted recently as a CA.
Similarly to what we describe here for C. multilineata, the
Panamanian sample of the wrasse Halichoeres bivittatus
has one individual (among 23 sampled) with a haplotype
that is more similar to those found in Brazil than those in
other Caribbean locations (Fig. 6a), indicating the recent
arrival of a haplotype of South Atlantic origin [36]. Additionally, in the goby genus Gnatholepis, and the angelfish
genus Centropyge, the Atlantic species are recently derived
from much more diverse Indo-Pacific groups, and apparently only recently arrived in the GC from the Indian
Ocean via the South Atlantic [35,42,54], supporting accumulation of species at the GC hotspot.
The phylogeny of parrotfishes (genus Sparisoma) also supports accumulation at the Caribbean (Fig. 6c and 6d). The
parrotfish S. axillare is abundant and widely distributed
throughout the Brazilian coast, but known only from SE
Venezuela in the Caribbean, indicating that the population there is probably a result of recent dispersal from Brazil. Likewise, the parrotfish S. griseorubra is restricted to
the southern Caribbean (SE Venezuela) and its sister species is S. frondosum (endemic to Brazil), indicating that S.
griseorubra likely originated from ancient dispersal by the
ancestor of the S. frondosum/S. griseorubra lineage. The
splitting of S. frondosum and S. griseorubra alternatively
could be explained by sympatric speciation in the Caribbean (the groups with Brazilian affinities co-occur with
their Caribbean counterparts in the southern Caribbean)
followed by dispersal towards Brazil. However, speciation
with gene flow in reef fishes has only been inferred when
there are strong ecological gradients [36], or where the
fish are strictly associated with coral hosts [55]. As this is
not the case for Sparisoma, this alternative is less likely
than an allopatric split between Brazil and the Caribbean
after dispersal northwards by a Brazilian lineage.
Supporting origin at the Caribbean, almost all basal haplotypes of the C. multilineata tree are observed only in Caribbean individuals (Figs. 2 and 3), which indicates that
populations at the three other regions are derived from a
Caribbean ancestor. Moreover, the Caribbean samples

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/157

(either separately or in combination) have the widest mismatch distributions (spanning 13 to 15 mutations; Fig. 5)
indicating that this region hosts the oldest and most stable
population. We can also infer that, because all eastern
Atlantic haplotypes apparently have a single origin
(monophyly in Fig. 2), they most likely originated from a
single colonization event (Fig. 3) on the order of two hundred thousand years ago (based on our trans-isthmian
molecular clock estimate of 4.4%/Myr). The recent finding of Centropyge aurantonotus in the eastern Atlantic (previously known only from the western Atlantic, but
recently observed in low numbers in Sao Tome [56]) and
the general direction of trans-Atlantic range expansion in
the gold spot goby [35] support this rare west to east colonization route.
Lending further support to the CO hypothesis, populations of the wrasse H. radiatus in Brazilian oceanic islands
are much more closely related to Caribbean H. radiatus
than to populations of H. brasiliensis (its sister species) in
the adjacent coast line, indicating that these islands were
colonized by migrants of Caribbean origin (Fig. 6b). A
similar pattern of southward dispersal from the GC to the
offshore Brazilian islands has been observed in gobies of
the genus Bathygobius [45]. Colonization outward from
the Caribbean must be a rare event because it goes against
prevailing currents, but as our analysis indicates, it has
happened and can lead to the establishment of new populations, supporting the CO hypothesis.
Support for origin of diversity in the GC comes from other
recent phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses. A survey
of seven-spined gobies [57] shows that two peripheral
species of Elacatinus (E. figaro from Brazil and E. puncticulatus from the eastern Pacific) are older species whereas
the 10 newest (youngest) Elacatinus species are found only
in the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. That is, recent speciation that produced 83% of the species in this genus
occurred within the GC. Likewise, the diverse families
Chaenopsidae and Labrisomidae are represented in the
GC by 45 species each, but elsewhere in the Atlantic there
are only four and 11 Atlantic species in each of these families respectively [40,58,59]. Hamlets (genus Hypoplectrus)
include as many as a dozen or more closely related "species" and are restricted entirely to the GC [60]. Thus, speciation leading to considerable faunal enrichment most
likely occurred in situ within the GC in those four taxa.
Recent phylogenetic analyses of large reef fish groups also
provide useful information to this debate. Among wrasses
(Labridae), the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific Halichoeres
are for the most part monophyletic, indicating that they
diversified in situ and supporting CO in a recent time
scale, but at the same time their diverse group of ancestors
is composed of Indo-Pacific species [21,61] supporting

Page 11 of 16

CA deeper in time, on a scale of tens of millions of years.
Similarly to the wrasses, the Caribbean groupers of the
genera Epinephelus and Mycteroperca are monophyletic
groups derived from Indo-Pacific ancestors [62], supporting both ancient CA and more recent CO. The Caribbean
butterflyfishes are mostly a paraphyletic assemblage of
lineages derived from more diverse Indo-Pacific groups,
supporting CA [63]. Within the damselfishes, the Caribbean (and Atlantic) species Abudefduf saxatilis seems to be
a recent arrival from the Indo-Pacific (it is very closely
related to a group containing eight Indo-Pacific and one
eastern Pacific species), also supporting CA [64]. Even
though these large scale phylogenies are useful, most lack
peripheral (mostly Brazilian) endemics, making their
contribution to this debate limited. However they provide
an excellent framework that, with the addition of a few
key species, may become an important piece in the tropical biodiversity puzzle.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/157

serves to strengthen the biodiversity feedback between
hotspots and other areas, and contribute to the global
center biodiversity in the IMA. Finally, it remains to be
seen whether the principles of origin and accumulation
apply to terrestrial biodiversity, or whether these evolutionary mechanisms are restricted to high-dispersal
media, the exclusive domain of the world's oceans.

Methods
Sampling strategy
Chromis multilineata is a common reef fish that is widely
distributed on both sides of the tropical Atlantic, as well
as at the mid-Atlantic islands [68]. They have demersal
eggs that develop into pelagic larvae in about three days
[69,70]. Estimates of pelagic larval duration range from
24 to 33 days [46]. Adults can be locally very abundant
and are usually found in schools from a few to several
hundred individuals, swimming and feeding on plankton
above the reef [71].

Conclusion
Our data indicates that the Greater Caribbean is both a
center of origin and accumulation for genetic lineages
within species (e.g. Chromis multilineata and Halichoeres
bivittatus) and for sister species within genera (e.g. Sparisoma). Such bidirectional dispersal is also reflected in the
geographic distributions of tropical Atlantic fishes and
invertebrates: several species that are widely distributed in
the Brazilian coast are also recorded in the southeastern
corner of the Caribbean [30,65,66]. Likewise some widely
distributed Caribbean species also occur in northern Brazil, sometimes on only a few reefs south of the Amazon
outflow, evidence of recent southward dispersal [30,40].
We conclude, on the basis of multiple lines of evidence,
that the GC marine biodiversity hotspot did not arise
through the action of a single mode of microevolutionary
change. This diversity is the product of a more complex
and idiosyncratic process in different taxa, and it is clear
from the accumulating data that several mechanisms have
contributed. The hypotheses of center of origin and center
of accumulation are not mutually exclusive, and acting in
concert, as they have done in the GC, origin and accumulation can generate more diversity than either process acting alone.
In closing we note that the IMA is a much larger hotspot
than the GC, in terms of both geography and biodiversity.
The IMA hotspot is flanked on both sides by the numerous archipelagos of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, a feature nearly absent for the GC hotspot. Moreover, the GC
is marked by a turbulent history involving extinctions of
many reef-associated organisms in the past few million
years [67], a feature not yet detected at the IMA. We suggest that the larger size and greater stability of the IMA,
combined with its extensive halo of peripheral habitats,

A total of 183 specimens of Chromis multilineata were
obtained from 10 locations, which included at least two
locations within each of the four provinces (Table 1, Fig.
1). Specimens were collected with polespears while scuba
diving or snorkeling, between 1997 and 2002. Tissues
(muscle and/or gill) were stored in a saturated salt-DMSO
buffer (Amos and Hoelzel 1991). A recent phylogenetic
survey of damselfishes indicates that the eastern Pacific
species C. atrilobata is the sister of C. multilineata [64]. To
confirm this relationship we sequenced C. atrilobata from
Cocos Island (n = 3) and Panama (n = 3) and other species
of the genus in the Atlantic that were not included in the
phylogeny [64]: C. scotti from Florida (n = 2); C.
enchrysura from Florida (n = 2), C. limbata from the Azores
(n = 4) and C. lubbocki from Cape Verde (n = 3). The resulting tree (not shown) supports the conclusion that C. multilineata and C. atrilobata are sister species.
DNA Extraction and Sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN (Valencia CA) Dneasy extraction kits following the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted DNA was frozen in TE buffer
and archived at -20°C. Primer names indicate the DNA
strand (H = heavy and L = light strand) and the position
of the 3' end of the oligonucleotide primer relative to the
human mitochondrial DNA sequence. A segment of 802
base pairs of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene was amplified with the primers L14725 (5' GTG ACT TGA AAA ACC
ACC GTT G 3') and H15573 (5' AAT AGG AAG TAT CAT
TCG GGT TTG ATG 3') [72].

Thermal cycling in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) consisted of an initial denaturing step at 94°C for 1 min 20
sec, then 35 cycles of amplification (40 sec of denaturation at 94°C, 30 seconds of annealing at 52°C, and 55 sec

of extension at 72°C), and a final extension of 2 min 30
sec at 72°C. Each tube contained 15 μl of water, 2.5 μl of
MgCl2, Mg free buffer and DNTPs, 0.3 μl of each primer,
0.4 μl of Taq DNA polymerase and 1.5 μl of purified DNA.
Excess primers were removed through simultaneous incubation of PCR product with exonuclease I and shrimp
alkaline phosphatase (USB Corp., Cleveland OH).
Sequencing reactions with fluorescently-labeled dideoxy
terminators (BigDye) were performed according to manufacturer's recommendations, and analyzed with an ABI
377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA). All samples were sequenced in the forward
direction (with L14725 primer), but rare and questionable haplotypes were sequenced in both directions to
ensure accuracy of nucleotide designations. Representative haplotype sequences are deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers EU431997 – EU432046. Copies of the
complete data set are available from LAR.
Phylogenetic and Population Analyses
Sequences were aligned and edited with Sequencher version 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Population
structure and gene flow were assessed with an analysis of
molecular variance AMOVA [73] in the program Arlequin
version 3.0, which generated ΦST values (a molecular analog of FST that includes sequence divergence among haplotypes as well as haplotype frequency shifts; [74]). Genetic
variation is described with nucleotide diversity (π; equation 10.19 [75]) and haplotype diversity (h; equation 8.5
[75]) within each location.

The computer program MODELTEST version 3.06 [76]
was used to determine the substitution model that best
fits the data through a minimal theoretical information
criterion (AIC). The model chosen was TRN+Γ [77] with a
gamma distribution of 0.97 to estimate sequence divergences (d values) between haplotypes. Equal weighting of
all three codon positions was used. Relationships between
all haplotypes and closely related species were estimated
using a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis performed with
MrBayes 3.1 [78]. Preliminary runs were performed to
monitor the fluctuating value of the likelihoods of the
Bayesian trees, and all parameters appear to reach stability
before 250,000 generations. The Markov chain analysis
was run for 20 million generations. A burn-in period, in
which the initial 10,000 trees were discarded, was adopted
and the remaining tree samples were used to generate a
50% majority rule consensus tree. The posterior probability of each clade was then provided by the percentage of
trees identifying the clade [79]. In addition, the software
PAUP 4.0b10 [80] was used to conduct maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbor-joining analyses that were evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented with
PAUP* version 4.0b10 [80]. The minimum evolution cri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/157

terion was used by applying maximum likelihood distances estimated with the model chosen by Modeltest in
the neighbor-joining analysis. The resulting Bayesian, parsimony and neighbour joining trees were not significantly
different.
Departure from neutrality was tested using Fu's Fs [81]
and Ramos-Onsins and Rozas' R2 statistic [82]. The R2
measure is based on the difference between the number of
singleton mutations and the average number of nucleotide differences among sequences within a population
sample. Both Fs and R2 are powerful tests used to detect
recent population expansions under assumptions of neutrality [81,82]. Significance of R2 and Fs were evaluated by
comparing the observed value with a null distribution
generated by 10,000 replicates, using the empirical population sample size and observed number of segregating
sites implemented by DnaSP version 4.10.9 [83]. Moreover, in order to estimate the demographic parameters of
past population expansions we calculated mismatch distributions (or the distribution of the pairwise genetic distances) for all populations using DnaSP. Time and
magnitude of the inferred population expansion were
determined by calculating θ0, θ1 and τ, where θ0 = 2N0μ
(N0 = population size before expansion); θ1 = 2N1μ (N1 =
population size after expansion); and τ = 2μt (μ = mutation rate per site per generation; t = time in generations).
The mutation rate per lineage per year (λ) was estimated
by solving the formula λ = d/2T, where d is the genetic distance between C. multilineata and C. atrilobata, and T is the
time since divergence between the two species used. We
used a T of 3.5 million years (Myr), as that is the upper
limit age for the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama
[84]. The rate of 2.21%/Myr (within lineages) that we estimated is very similar to that obtained in a recent survey of
Chromis using a slightly different portion of the cyt b gene
(2.36%/Myr; [85]. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama
was used in several other studies to estimate mutation
rates in reef fishes (e.g.: [35,86-88]).
Migration rates between the major biogeographical provinces (Brazil, the Caribbean, central Atlantic islands and
eastern Atlantic islands) Nm (where N is effective female
population size and m is migration rate) were calculated
with the software MIGRATE version 1.7.6 [89], which uses
a maximum likelihood approach based on coalescence
theory [90]. Estimators of migration rates based on coalescence theory can detect asymmetries (directionality) in
migration rates and differences in population sizes, a considerable advantage when testing migration rates in the
context of evolutionary theory [91]. Most of the default
settings for MIGRATE were used on the first run, but the
number of trees sampled was increased to 10,000 for the
short chains and 100,000 for the long chains to avoid

local maxima on the likelihood surface. A trial run was
used to generate the input parameters; the average of
results of 10 runs (number of trees sampled was progressively increased from 10,000 to 300,000 for the short
chains and from 100,000 to 3,000,000 for the long
chains) is reported here. We also used the software IM to
estimate migration between populations of C. multilineata; IM uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach [92].
The results from the IM analysis are not shown because
they were completely compatible with the results from
MIGRATE.

References

In addition, we re-analyzed data from four groups of reef
fish species (the wrasse genus Halichoeres [36], and the
parrotfish genus Sparisoma [38]) to specifically assess predictions from the center of origin and center of accumulation hypotheses. To do so we constructed statistical
parsimony networks for those species as well as Chromis
multilineata using the computer program TCS version 1.21
[93] and analyzed the geographical distribution of
mtDNA haplotypes.
