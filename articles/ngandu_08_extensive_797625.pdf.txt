Abstract
Background: Positive selection pressure acting on protein-coding sequences is usually inferred
when the rate of nonsynonymous substitution is greater than the synonymous rate. However,
purifying selection acting directly on the nucleotide sequence can lower the synonymous
substitution rate. This could result in false inference of positive selection because when
synonymous changes at some sites are under purifying selection, the average synonymous rate is an
underestimate of the neutral rate of evolution. Even though HIV-1 coding sequences contain a
number of regions that function at the nucleotide level, and are thus likely to be affected by
purifying selection, studies of positive selection assume that synonymous substitutions can be used
to estimate the neutral rate of evolution.
Results: We modelled site-to-site variation in the synonymous substitution rate across coding
regions of the HIV-1 genome. Synonymous substitution rates were found to vary significantly within
and between genes. Surprisingly, regions of the genome that encode proteins in more than one
frame had significantly higher synonymous substitution rates than regions coding in a single frame.
We found evidence of strong purifying selection pressure affecting synonymous mutations in
fourteen regions with known functions. These included an exonic splicing enhancer, the revresponsive element, the poly-purine tract and a transcription factor binding site. A further five
highly conserved regions were located within known functional domains. We also found four
conserved regions located in env and vpu which have not been characterized previously.
Conclusion: We provide the coordinates of genomic regions with markedly lower synonymous
substitution rates, which are putatively under the influence of strong purifying selection pressure at
the nucleotide level as well as regions encoding proteins in more than one frame. These regions
should be excluded from studies of positive selection acting on HIV-1 coding regions.

Background
Several statistical models of codon evolution have been
developed and applied to protein-coding sequences
from viral and other pathogens [1-4]. The primary
application of these models has been the detection of
evidence of diversifying selection acting on protein
coding DNA sequences. Within maximum likelihood
or Bayesian frameworks these models can be used to
identify specific sites at which adaptive mutations have
occurred. In the context of virus infections this information can be especially useful for identifying immune
escape and drug resistance mutations [3, 5, 6].
Positive selection is frequently inferred by comparing the
rate of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to the rate of synonymous substitutions
per synonymous site (dS). The ratio of these two rates is
often represented by the symbol ω. Under the assumption that synonymous substitutions are neutral and that
the synonymous substitution rate therefore approximates the neutral rate of evolution, diversifying selection
can be inferred when ω is greater than one. Several
methods exist to determine whether there is evidence
that ω is greater than one at a subset of sites in a proteincoding gene (i.e. the gene is evolving under diversifying
selection) and to identify the sites within the gene at
which diversifying selection occurs [3, 4, 7-9].
In many of the situations in which this strategy is
applied, the assumption that synonymous substitutions
are fixed at a constant rate and provide a good estimate
of the neutral rate of evolution, may not hold.
Kosakovsky Pond & Muse reported that coding
sequences from a wide range of taxa, including HIV-1,
show strong evidence of variation in the rate of
synonymous substitution across coding regions [10].
There are two possible causes of synonymous rate
variation. If synonymous substitutions are indeed
neutral, variation in the mutation rate can cause the
synonymous substitution rate to vary. In such a case, it is
possible to include a varying synonymous substitution
rate in the codon models of evolution and inference of
positive selection from comparison of the local synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates remains
feasible. However, if the variation in synonymous
substitution rate is caused by selection acting to preserve
functions that are encoded at the nucleotide level, even a
comparison of local nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitution rates cannot be used to infer positive
selection because the synonymous substitution rate is
no longer a valid proxy for the neutral rate of evolution
and the standard approach of inferring the action of
diversifying selection when ω > 1 is not valid.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/160

Failure to model variation in synonymous substitution
rate will result in an overall underestimate of the neutral
rate of evolution. This undermines the validity of the
inference of selection, because nonsynonymous substitution rates are compared against a rate which is no
longer a good estimate of the neutral rate, and this is
likely to result in inference of diversifying selection at a
proportion of the sites that are actually evolving
neutrally. Indeed, as the number of taxa increases, we
expect an ever greater proportion of the neutral sites to
be classified as diversifying selection sites in this
scenario. Alternatively, if the synonymous substitution
rate variation is modeled and selection inferred when dN
is greater than the local dS rate then we expect a very
high probability of false inference of selection at codons
where the synonymous positions happen to be functionally important and conserved, and the nonsynonymous positions are neutral or experience less purifying
selection. Thus, in general, in a codon-based method,
analysis of selection is unreliable when there is purifying
selection acting to preserve functions at the nucleotide
level. An example where an elevated ω was attributable
to purifying selection acting on synonymous sites was
reported by Hurst & Pal [11].
Several examples of sequence motifs within proteincoding sequences that are expected to be under purifying
selection at the nucleotide level are known in HIV-1,
many of which are involved in regulating gene expression. Examples include the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR)
region, part of which also encodes the Nef protein [12,
13]. In addition to conserved RNA secondary structures,
the LTR contains several regulatory elements, some of
which directly interact with cellular transcription factors
(e.g. the Ets protein family) [14, 15]. The viral sequence
also has an intragenic nuclease hypersensitive region
involved in regulating gene expression (also referred to
as HS7) in the pol gene [16-18] and the rev-responsive
element (RRE) in the env gene which interacts with the
Rev protein to transport unspliced or partially spliced
RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the infected
cell [17, 19-21]. Some functionally important regions of
the RRE have previously been found to be conserved at
the nucleotide sequence level, presumably the result of
purifying selection pressure to preserve this function
[22]. The inhibitory sequence elements (INS) in gag and
the cis-repressive sequence (CRS) in pol are examples of
negative regulators of transcription [23-26]. If these
functional sites are important for viral viability, then we
expect them to be preserved by purifying selection.
While it represents a significant challenge for studies of
selection acting on the HIV-1 amino acid sequence, the

variability in the synonymous substitution rate may also
provide useful information about previously unknown
sequence motifs within the coding fraction of the HIV-1
genome that function at the nucleotide level. Although
some variability can be explained by a variable mutation
rate, the identification of regions of very high conservation that cannot be explained by selection acting on the
amino acid sequence or by known motifs that function
at the nucleotide level has the potential to highlight
novel functions encoded in the HIV-1 genome.
Here we use an existing model of codon sequence
evolution [10] to provide the first complete overview of
site-to-site variation in synonymous substitution rate
across the whole HIV-1 genome and identify selection
pressures likely to be driving this variation. This model
allows dN and dS to vary independently across sites,
ensuring that the estimated dS values reflect selection
pressure acting upon the nucleotide sequence and not at
the amino acid level. It is worthwhile to distinguish
between selective pressure acting at the nucleotide level,
affecting both synonymous and nonsynonymous
changes, and at the amino acid level, affecting nonsynonymous changes only. Unfortunately, quantifying
the relative contributions of nucleotide and amino acid
level effects on nonsynonymous changes is highly
sensitive to model assumptions. We therefore restricted
the analysis to synonymous changes and do not attempt
to quantify the nucleotide-level selective pressure on
nonsynonymous changes. We took into account recombination breakpoints in order to avoid biased estimates
that can result from fitting phylogenetic models that do
not take recombination into account [27, 28].
We report patterns of sequence conservation around
nucleotide sequence motifs with known functions and
identify additional conserved nucleotide elements that
do not fall within any currently characterized functional
motifs. Finally, we report the locations of all HIV-1
genome regions where we infer that purifying selection
acting directly on the nucleotide sequence is likely to
cause a substantial reduction in the synonymous
substitution rate. These are provided with respect to
the HXB2 reference strain, to enable other researchers to
mask these regions from their analyses of positive
selection acting on HIV-1 genes.

Methods
Sequence data
Nucleotide sequence alignments consisting of HIV-1
Group M subtype reference sequences were downloaded
from the Los Alamos database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov
for each gene of the HIV-1 genome [29]. Each alignment

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/160

had at least one sequence (total ranging from 32 to 37)
from each of the 11 non-recombinant HIV-1 group M
subtypes A1, A2, B, C, D, F1, F2, G, H, J and K [Genbank:

U51190, U52953, U88824, U88826]. All regions encoding amino acids in more than one frame were identified
and regions judged by eye to be unreliably aligned, i.e.,
positions 6544–6595, 6700–6715, 7318–7375 of the env
gene region, were excluded from the analysis. We used
the HIV-1 genome map and sequence annotations
available from the Los Alamos database to identify the
regions of the genome that encode proteins in a single
reading frame (see Table 1) [29].
We identified recombination breakpoints in each alignment using the GARD (Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection) algorithm implemented in the HyPhy
(Hypothesis testing using Phylogenies) package [30, 31].
Evidence of recombination was detected in all genes
except tat, vpr and vpu. GARD outputs both an alignment
showing the positions of recombination breakpoints and
separate tree topologies for each of the sequence
alignment segments bounded by these breakpoints.
Synonymous substitution rate estimation
Synonymous substitution rates were estimated using a
version of the MG94 codon substitution model [1, 10].
We used the Dual Model, which allows dS to vary
independently of dN and used three discrete categories
for each rate. We ran the selected models using a HyPhy
batch script for analysis of selection acting on recombining sequences which we developed previously [32]. This
method uses separate tree topologies for each partition
of the sequence alignment while keeping the rest of the
model parameters fixed across all partitions. We used
sliding window plots of mean dS values, calculated over
three adjacent codons, to identify regions with low
synonymous substitution rates.

We also analyzed an alignment of HIV-1 subtype C gag
sequences [Genbank: DQ792982-DQ793045] described
previously [33] to assess the impact of conservation
acting on synonymous substitutions on inference of
positive selection. We inferred positive selection using
model M2a of Yang and colleagues [34], taking
recombination into account [32].

Simulations
We used HyPhy to generate simulated data under a
neutral model with trees generated from the original
alignments (or the tree from the largest un-recombined
region for alignments where recombination was
detected). The same sequence alignments used as input
in the initial analysis were used and one hundred
simulated datasets were generated for each alignment.
Each simulated dataset was then analyzed using the Dual
Model as described above. For each gene the minimum
value of mean dS across all sliding windows of three
adjacent codons, in all of the one hundred simulated
datasets, was used as a conservative threshold to identify
windows of reduced dS in the observed data. This
stringent threshold and a less stringent one that included
95% of the values inferred from the simulated data are
shown in the sliding window plots.

Functional analysis of a novel nucleotide sequence
motif in env
JC53-bl and 293T cells were obtained from Dr George
Shaw (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) and
cultured as described previously [35]. M7-Luc cells (5.25.
EGFP.Luc.M7) were kindly provided by Dr Nathaniel
Landau through the AIDS Research and Reference
Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID. M7-Luc
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 2
mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 ug/ml gentamicin
(Sigma), supplemented with 10 μg/ml DEAE-Dextran for
infectivity assays. An infectious molecular clone, p81,
was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference
Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: p81A-4
(Cat#11440) from Dr. Bruce Chesebro. Mutations were
introduced into p81 using the Stratagene QuickChange
XL kit. Infectious viral particles were produced by
transfection of 293T cells using Fugene reagent (Roche
BioSciences), and transfection output was assessed by
determination of TCID50 in JC53-bl cells as described
previously [35]. Equivalent numbers of TCID50 were

used to infect M7-luc cells seeded into 96 well plates at a
density of 7.5 × 105 cells/ml followed by a washout
step12 hours post-infection. Replication was monitored by
measurement of p24 production using the Vironostica
HIV-1 antigen Microelisa system (Biomerieux) over 5 days.

Results
Consistent with previous reports [5, 10], we found
evidence of variation in synonymous substitution rates
within and across HIV-1 genes (Figure 1). For all genes
the Dual Model [10], which allows independent variation of dS and dN had a much better fit to the data than
a model with constant dN and dS (referred to as the
Constant model in Table 2) or than a model in which
only dN varied across sites (the Nonsynonymous model
in Table 2). The variance of dS gives an indication of the
extent of site-to-site synonymous rate heterogeneity

The Dual Model which allows dS to vary across sites has the lowest AIC
(best fit to the data) for all 8 genes.

within the different genomic regions (Table 3). There was
significant variation between genes (p-value = 2 × 10-7, from
Levene's test) with the least site-to-site variation in dS
observed in vpu and the most in vpr followed by nef and env
(Figure 2).
We found evidence of strong purifying selection acting
directly on the nucleotide sequence at twenty-three sites

across the HIV-1 genome (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6).
Fourteen of these regions (marked in black in Figures 3
and 4) coincided exactly with well characterized functional motifs while for another five (marked in green in
Figure 3), we were able to identify possible functions
based on the known functions of the sequence domains
in which they were situated. We could not, however, find
plausible explanations for high degrees of sequence
conservation observed within a twelve-nucleotide region
of the env gene and three other regions in vpu (marked in
red in Figure 4). Sequence logos illustrating the
conservation in each of these twenty-three significantly
conserved regions are shown in Figure 5 (for those with
known specific function) and Figure 6 (for those with
predicted and unknown functions).
The fourteen regions with known functions included one
region consisting of fifteen nucleotides following the gag
start codon, positions 793–807 of HXB2. This forms the
fourth stem loop (sl4, Figure 3a) of the dimerization/
encapsidation signal. The encapsidation signal is a four
stem-loop structure which stretches from the 5' LTR and
interacts with the nucleo-capsid protein, promoting
formation of genomic RNA and blocking the initiation
of transcription [14, 36, 37].

per gene. The values are from non-overlapping regions of
HIV-1 genes.

In the pol gene, we found two highly conserved regions
with known functions. One corresponded to the first
three nucleotides (HXB2 coordinate positions 4092–
4094) of the 260 nucleotide long cis-repressive sequence
(CRS; Figure 3b). The cis-repressive sequence inhibits
expression of structural protein mRNAs by preventing
their transportation from the nucleus – a process that is
reversed by the rev-responsive element (RRE) [24-26].
The other was found at the 3' end of the intragenic
nuclease hypersensitive domain (hs7 in Figure 3b). The
latter motif, located between positions 4926 and 4937
and labeled "ese" in Figure 3b, is also located within
HIV-1 exon 2 and the last six nucleotides, TGGAAA, of
this conserved region form a known exonic splicing
enhancer (ESE) of HIV mRNAs [38-42].
Two regions in vpr, a 3' splice acceptor site [41] and an
RNase-V1 cleavage site [43, 44] were also conserved
(labeled ssa3 and rnase respectively in Figure 3d) at
positions 5759–5777 and 5794–5805 respectively. An
additional two highly conserved regions were observed
within the tat gene, one containing an exonic splicing
silencer, ESS2 between nucleotide positions 5855 and
5863 and the other at the 3' splice acceptor site A4b
located at positions 5957 to 5968 (ess2 and ssa4b
respectively in Figure 4a) [41].

Three of the highly conserved regions with known
functions were in the env gene and included a ninenucleotide long motif from position 7834 to 7842
within the RRE. The approximately two hundred
nucleotides long RRE element within env, is known to
interact with the Rev protein and facilitates the transport
of late un-spliced and partially-spliced RNAs from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm [19-21]. Although the RRE is
associated with a long stretch of sequence that forms a
well characterized secondary structure with various
conserved domains [22], only the nine nucleotides that
bind Rev with highest affinity [21, 45] were sufficiently
conserved to be detected using our conservative threshold (Figure 4c). Also conserved within the env gene were
the two splice site regions at the end of the tat/rev exon,

the LTR and is known to associate with the 3' LTR,
serving as a primer for the initiation of HIV-1 plus strand
DNA replication [12, 48-50]. A previous detailed RT

the cleavage site of the PPT by RNAse H as well as the
start of integrase attachment region for the integration of
the viral genome into the genome of the host [48,

highly variable, one dominated by G-to-A mutations in a
sequence context consistent with APOBEC-induced
hypermutations when compared to the Group M
ancestral sequence [56] (see Additional file 1) and the
second had a high rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions (labeled "G-A" and "var" in Figure

In order to assess whether purifying selection is likely to
cause false inference of positive selection we used
standard methods to detect positive selection in a
subtype C gag coding sequence alignment described
previously [33]. Sites with ω significantly greater than
one, implying positive selection, overlapped significantly
with sites that had lower than average dS values (Fisher's
exact test odds ratio = 4.4; p-value = 0.006; Additional
file 3). This is consistent with a substantial proportion of
the positive selection signals resulting from conservation
of the synonymous sites rather than diversifying selection acting on the nonsynonymous sites.

Sequence motifs for the highly conserved regions

found to be under strong purifying selection in HIV-1 genes.
The range of coordinates on the HIV-1 genome for each
motif is given in column 2. Numbers above each logo
represent the degeneracy at each nucleotide site.

One of the novel regions, the twelve nucleotide long
motif in env, upstream of the RRE showed the highest
degree of conservation of any region in the env gene ('n1'
in Figure 4c; positions 7656–7667 of HXB2). Introduction of synonymous point mutations at positions 7, 9
and 12 in this nucleotide motif had no effect on virus
output from transfected 293T cells (see Additional file 2
(a)). No significant differences were observed between
the wild type and mutated viruses with respect to their
infectivity in M7-Luc cells (see Additional file 2(b)).
Although the effect of mutations within this region is
therefore not clear at present, future work making use of
more sensitive competitive replication assays will determine whether these changes have an impact on viral
fitness. Functional analyses of the three novel conserved
regions in vpu, with HXB2 coordinates 6101–6106,

This is the first study to provide a detailed analysis of
site-to-site variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions across the HIV-1 genome. In the past, site-to-site
variation in dS in HIV-1 has been investigated in a single
gene [5, 10] and in another study a single overall
synonymous substitution rate for the entire genome was
determined for comparison to other viral lineages [57].
We modeled site-to-site synonymous rate variation using
a similar approach to a previous study [10], in that case
only one HIV-1 gene, vif, was considered and sites that
encode proteins in multiple reading frames were
included. As a consequence, it was not clear whether
the observed site-to-site rate variation resulted from
variation in the synonymous rate or from selection
acting on nonsynonymous substitutions in another
reading frame. Here we focused primarily on regions of
the HIV genome that encode proteins in a single reading
frame and explored functions of nucleotide sequences
that have the largest influence on synonymous substitution rate variation.
Previous studies have demonstrated that recombination
causes false inference of positive selection. Since
recombination affects tree topologies used in fitting
phylogenetic models, it is also likely to cause biased
estimates of dS. The recent development of methods to
account for recombination in selection analyses [32]
permitted us to remove recombination as a source of
bias in our estimates of synonymous substitution rates.
In addition to the fourteen conserved regions with
known functions and the novel sites in env and vpu, five
conserved sites without previously reported specific
functions occurred within known functional domains.

These include three short (3–6 bp) motifs in the
inhibitory (INS) sequence regions of gag (HXB2 positions 898–903, 985–996 and 1309–1314, Figure 3a).
Previous in-vitro analyses have shown that short motifs
within the approximately two hundred bp long INS
regions, are responsible for the actual inhibition of
mRNA expression [23, 24, 26]. Although the three motifs
we find within this region have not been specifically
identified in-vitro, a computational study by Wolff et al
(2003) showed that the INS sequences have several short
functional motifs within them [26]. The conserved sites
we identified within INS1 and INS2 could serve the same
inhibitory function. Functional assays elucidating the
role of these sites in the inhibition of mRNA expression
could help to determine the precise mechanisms by
which inhibition occurs and whether these sites also play
a role. In another previous study which analyzed the
RNA secondary structure of the 5' region of HIV-1, these
two regions, labeled 'INS1' in Figure 3a, were found to
be involved in conserved Watson-Crick base-pairing [58]
The last two of the five conserved regions with
unidentified specific functions were within the pol HS7.
HS7 spans five hundred nucleotides, between positions
4481 and 4982 of the HIV-1 genome, and has an LTRlike regulatory function [16, 17]. Previous studies
revealed four domains towards the 3' end of this region
(PU box, GC-box, site-C and site-D) that bind to specific
transcription factors (TFs) and are also important for
viral infectivity [16, 17]. In these studies, the Oct-1, Oct2, PU.1, Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors were found to
bind to at least one of the four identified sites. The two
conserved regions we identified are outside these specific
identified functional domains, but one of them at
positions 4767–4790 (labeled "p1" in Figure 3b)
showed potential binding to Oct-1 using the MATCH
tool from the TRANSFAC database [59, 60]. Potential
association with a transcription factor was not observed
for the three nucleotides (positions 4864–4866) labeled
'p2' and its adjacent sites.
Knowledge of regions of the genome that function at the
nucleotide level is important for positive selection
analysis. Conserved synonymous sites can cause false
detection of positive selection and need to be either
excluded from analyses or modeled appropriately. The
danger is that some sites may be assumed to be evolving
adaptively simply as a result of the purifying selection
acting directly on the nucleotide sequence. We found
evidence of this in subtype C gag sequences where
positively selected sites significantly coincided with
significantly low dS (Additional file 3). In addition, a
study by Hurst & Pal (2001) also showed false detection
of positive selection caused by purifying selection
pressure acting on synonymous sites.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/160

In many selection, studies the synonymous rate is
assumed to be constant. However, negative selection
acting on synonymous sites can potentially reduce genewide estimates of the synonymous rates below the
neutral evolution rate. Comparison of site-specific
nonsynonymous substitution rates against this underestimate of the neutral rate is likely to cause a proportion
of the selectively neutral nonsynonymous sites to seem
as though they are evolving adaptively. We have,
however, used a very stringent cutoff to identify the
twenty three regions within the HIV genome that have
obviously reduced synonymous substitution rates. For a
more conservative analysis of selection, all the significantly conserved sites, i.e., including those conserved at
95% confidence (p-value < 0.05, listed in Table 3)
should be excluded from analyses along with sites that
encode proteins in multiple frames. Surprisingly, we
found that the rate of synonymous substitution, was
higher, on average, in overlapping gene regions that
encode proteins in more than one frame (p = 6 × 10-7
from Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1); however, lower
dS was observed within some genome regions that are
translated in multiple reading frames. Analysis of the
most diverse sequences within subtype B and C revealed
more highly conserved sites across the RRE and INS1
regions at the subtype level (Additional file 4). These
putatively functional domains could also be removed in
more conservative studies of selection acting on HIV
protein sequences.

Conclusion
We have analyzed sequence variation at the synonymous
sites of non-overlapping regions of HIV-1 genes. We
found substantial site-to-site variation in the rate of
synonymous substitution with evidence of purifying
selection pressure within functional domains such as the
Rev-responsive element. The majority of conserved sites
we identified are within functional regions that are well
documented in the literature; however, the total number
of sites that function at the nucleotide level is unknown
and it is therefore difficult to assess the fraction of the
known and novel functional sites that are detectable
using our method. In addition to identifying putatively
functional sites under purifying selection, these results
contribute to the robustness of analyses of positive
selection by identifying conserved synonymous sites that
can cause false positive inference of selection. The sites
presented in Table 3 and Figures 5 and 6 thus form a
resource for future studies of selection pressures acting
on HIV-1 genes.
