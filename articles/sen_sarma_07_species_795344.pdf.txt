Abstract
Background: Honey bees are known for several striking social behaviors, including a complex
pattern of behavioral maturation that gives rise to an age-related colony division of labor and a
symbolic dance language, by which successful foragers communicate the location of attractive food
sources to their nestmates. Our understanding of honey bees is mostly based on studies of the
Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, even though there are 9–10 other members of genus Apis,
showing interesting variations in social behavior relative to A. mellifera. To facilitate future in-depth
genomic and molecular level comparisons of behavior across the genus, we performed a
microarray analysis of brain gene expression for A. mellifera and three key species found in Asia, A.
cerana, A. florea and A. dorsata.
Results: For each species we compared brain gene expression patterns between foragers and
adult one-day-old bees on an A. mellifera cDNA microarray and calculated within-species gene
expression ratios to facilitate cross-species analysis. The number of cDNA spots showing
hybridization fluorescence intensities above the experimental threshold was reduced by an average
of 16% in the Asian species compared to A. mellifera, but an average of 71% of genes on the
microarray were available for analysis. Brain gene expression profiles between foragers and oneday-olds showed differences that are consistent with a previous study on A. mellifera and were
comparable across species. Although 1772 genes showed significant differences in expression
between foragers and one-day-olds, only 218 genes showed differences in forager/one-day-old
expression between species (p < 0.001). Principal Components Analysis revealed dominant
patterns of expression that clearly distinguished between the four species but did not reflect known
differences in behavior and ecology. There were species differences in brain expression profiles for
functionally related groups of genes.
Conclusion: We conclude that the A. mellifera cDNA microarray can be used effectively for crossspecies comparisons within the genus. Our results indicate that there is a widespread conservation
of the molecular processes in the honey bee brain underlying behavioral maturation. Species
differences in brain expression profiles for functionally related groups of genes provide possible
clues to the basis of behavioral variation in the genus.

Background
The western honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a highly social
insect that has emerged as one of the model organisms for
using genomics to study the mechanisms and evolution of
social behavior [1]. Honey bees are known for several
striking social behaviors [2,3]. For example, adult worker
honey bees display a complex pattern of behavioral maturation that involves working in the hive when young and
foraging when older; this gives rise to an age-related division of labor in honey bee colonies that is thought to be
one of the factors contributing to the spectacular ecological success of social insects [4]. Honey bees also are
known for their symbolic dance language, by which successful foragers communicate the location of attractive
food sources to their nestmates [3,5]. Behavioral maturation in adult honey bees is associated with coordinated
changes in expression of thousands of genes in the brain
[6-8], and a few genes have been identified that have
causal effects [9-11]. Molecular or neural components of
honey bee dance language have not yet been identified.
Our understanding of honey bees is mostly based on studies of A. mellifera, even though there are as many as 9–10
other members of genus Apis [12-14]. Apis is an ancient
lineage of bees that evolved in tropical Eurasia ca. 8–11
million years ago [12] some migrated north and west,
reaching Europe by the end of the Pleistocene epoch,
10,000 yr ago [15]. Phylogenetic analyses partition the
genus into three groups. The cavity nesters form a monophyletic group and consequently A. mellifera and A. cerana
are more closely related to one another than to dorsata and
florea [12-14]. A. dorsata and A. florea, two open-nesting
species, are in separate lineages, with florea part of the
most basal lineage in the genus [14].
Other Apis species display a rich combination of similarities and differences in behavior and ecology relative to A.
mellifera [13]. Studies are limited, but there is some evidence that workers in other Apis species also show patterns of behavioral maturation similar to A. mellifera [3];
in all species studied, young workers perform nest work
and older workers forage [16]. Conversely, comparative
studies of key members of the genus, A. mellifera, A. cerana, A. florea and A. dorsata, have revealed marked differences in dance language, habitat, nesting habit, body size
and worker "tempo" (Figure 1).
To facilitate future comparative studies of honey bee
behavior at the genomic and molecular level, we performed a microarray analysis comparing brain gene
expression of foragers with that of newly eclosed one-dayold adult bees ("one-day-olds") for A. mellifera, A. cerana,
A. florea and A. dorsata. A previous study demonstrates
that of the different age groups studied for A. mellifera,
one-day-olds form perhaps the most discrete and cohesive

group in terms of brain gene expression profiles [8]. In
addition, a significant amount of brain maturation occurs
between pupation and 4 weeks (foraging age) as evidenced by neuropil expansion and lengthening and
branching of dendrites of Kenyon cells of mushroom bodies [17]. Also among adult groups compared, the most
consistent differences in all parameters of brain maturation were seen between one-day-olds and foragers.
Genomic resources are currently very limited to a tiny fraction of the animal species available for study. Only one
species of honey bee, A. mellifera, has a custom-designed
microarray, made from an A. mellifera brain EST library
[18] and representing ~ 5500 genes or ~ 50% of the currently annotated genes in the A. mellifera genome [15]. We
show that this A. mellifera cDNA microarray can be used
effectively for cross-species comparison of behavioral
maturation within the genus. Brain gene expression profiles between foragers and one-day-olds showed differences that are consistent with a previous study on A.
mellifera [8] and were comparable across species. Species
differences in brain expression profiles for functionally
related groups of genes provide clues to the basis of
behavioral variation in the genus.

Results and discussion

be significantly regulated between foragers and one-dayolds in each of the species in the current study, 58 – 75%
also had been found to be significantly regulated between
foragers and one-day-olds in reference 8 (Table 1). The
higher number of genes significantly regulated between
foragers and one-day-olds in reference 8 compared to the
current study probably reflects a higher statistical power
due to increased replication in the former study [8]. Nevertheless, all four species performed comparably on the A.
mellifera cDNA microarrays and maintained consistent
patterns of brain gene expression differences. This demonstrates the utility of the array for carrying out comparisons
between Apis species.

Species differences in hybridization efficiency
A total of 4432 genes that represented 63% of the genes
present in the array passed through our stringent analysis
filters. This suggested the suitability of the array for interspecies comparisons. Only those spots which hybridized
above the mean threshold intensity for all species were
used (see Methods). The number of cDNA spots (genes)
hybridizing above threshold fluorescence intensity was
less for the three Asian species compared to A. mellifera (A.
mellifera 5595, A. cerana 5202, A. florea 4556, A. dorsata
4535). Performances of the four species on the microarrays were comparable and in keeping with known differences and estimated approximate evolutionary distance.
Thus A. cerana, sharing a monophyletic origin with A. mellifera [12-14], apparently displayed higher hybridization
efficiency compared to the more distantly related A. florea
and A. dorsata.
Similarities in age-dependent differences in brain gene
expression
We compared brain gene expression between foragers and
one-day-olds of each colony, within each species. That is,
the two samples hybridized on each array always
belonged to the same species. This was done to avoid
"false positives" that could arise due to interspecific differences in hybridization efficiency to the microarray
[19,20]. We calculated gene expression ratios of forager to
one-day-old brain expression levels for every gene and
each replicate pair of arrays (data not shown; mean ratios
available in an online repository [21]). Any difference
detected between species using this ratio cannot be attributed specifically to either foragers or one-day-olds.

To measure replicability across experiments, we compared
our data with a previous study [8]. Of the genes found to

Species differences in brain gene expression
1772 genes showed significant differences in brain gene
expression between foragers and one-day-olds (ANOVA,
F-test, p < 0.001) in any species. However, only 218 genes
showed significant difference in forager/one-day-old
ratios of brain gene expression (F/DO) between at least 2
species (p < 0.001). At this P value level the number
expected by chance alone would be 5.

A pair-wise comparison between species showed that the
comparison between A. florea and A. mellifera resulted in
the greatest number of genes (114) showing F/DO differences between any pair of species (Table 2). This is perhaps a reflection of the fact that of the 4 species compared,
A. florea and A. mellifera show the most extreme differences in behavior and ecology (Figure 1). A. florea and A.
mellifera also are among the most distantly related pairs of
species in Apis [14]. However, the comparison between A.
cerana and A. dorsata resulted in the fewest (18) number
of genes showing F/DO differences between any pair of
species (Table 2) and these two species also differ extensively in behavior and ecology. However, both cerana and

Data belonging to each species were analyzed separately to obtain genes significantly regulated between foragers and one-day-olds by an F test (p <
0.01), numbers in parentheses. The comparison set was obtained from Whitfield et al 2006 [8] and consisted of genes significantly regulated
between foragers and one-day-olds (p < 0.001). Only those genes that were present in the gene list of at least one species in the current study were
included in the comparison set. Intersects of pair-wise comparisons between the two datasets are given along with results of Chi-square tests.

dorsata are Asian species while mellifera is native to Africa
and Europe [22].
A Principal Component Analysis on the brain expression
profiles of all 218 genes that showed species differences at
p < 0.001 revealed that there were clear patterns of gene
expression that differentiated the 4 species from each
other (Figure 2). Principal Component 1 (PC1), which
accounts for 57.7% of the variance, describes the predominant brain expression pattern as follows: genes that were
upregulated or downregulated in forager brains compared
to one-day-olds in one species were also likely to be
upregulated or downregulated in forager brains compared
to one-day-olds in other species (Figure 2a). The major
inference that can be drawn from this result is that the
molecular processes underlying the maturation of a oneday-old bee to a forager are largely conserved between species. This is consistent with observations suggesting that
workers in other Apis species show the same basic pattern
of behavioral maturation that A. mellifera does [16].
PCs 2 and 3, which together accounted for 26.8% of the
variance, revealed species differences in brain gene expression that were strong enough to distinguish all the species
(Figure 2b and 2c). However, these differences do not
overlap with known ecological or physiological differences. For example, the differences do not reflect the fact
that two of the species (florea and dorsata) are open nesting while the other two are cavity nesting; or that all four
species differ in size with dorsata almost 2.5 fold larger
than florea [13].
PC 4 (Figure 2d) reflected a pattern in the data that indicates that a component of the variance in brain gene
expression is attributable solely to differences between A.
dorsata and the other species. There are indeed distinctive
features of dorsata biology relative to the other three species, including migratory habits, defensive behavior, and
its much larger size [13], but it is not known whether the
differences we detected are related to these aspects.
Functional classification of differentially expressed genes
To derive inferences (albeit highly speculative) related to
functional differences between the species that could
guide future studies, we analyzed the 218 genes for over-

representation in functional Gene Ontology [23] categories (GO, 588 Biological Process terms and 322 Molecular
Function terms spanning all levels). Available Drosophila
orthologs for 145 of the 218 genes were subjected to an
enrichment analysis [24] (Table 3).
The most significant enrichment among the categories
tested was genes implicated in "response to biotic stimulus" and "defense response" (Table 3). This finding is
intriguing because these categories encompass responses
by a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion,
enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a
stimulus caused or produced by another living organism.
Behavioral maturation from one-day-old to forager
involves changes in endocrine activity, metabolism, circadian clock activity, brain chemistry and brain structure
[25]. In addition, honey bees are highly social organisms
and thus highly responsive to their nestmates and conspecifics. One way that honey bees respond to changes in
their colony condition is by altering their rate of behavioral maturation [25]; this has only been studied in A. mellifera. Apis species differ among many other things,
including colony size, predator pressure, prevalence of
brood diseases and reproductive colony fission [13].
Therefore these groups of highly regulated genes might
reflect differences in behavioral maturation processes
brought about by differences in social cohesiveness and
colony integration. Along these lines, we note that two
genes from these two categories, honey bee orthologs of
Drosophila PebIII and Tctp, which have previously been
shown to be lower in foragers compared to one-day-olds
in A. mellifera, [8] showed a reversed and significantly
higher F/DO expression ratio in A. florea (the open nesting, dwarf species living in small colonies) compared to
the other three species (Figure 3).
A couple of other interesting groups of genes were those
involved in metabolic processes, e.g., carbohydrate and
amino acid metabolism. Similarly, most of the molecular
functional categories that emerged as significantly
enriched are also groups of genes that participate in metabolic processes, e.g., exo- and metallopeptidases, hydrolases, and genes coding for o-methyltransferases, and
carrier proteins (Table 3). This is interesting because one
of the most striking differences between the four species

colony attributes led Dyer and Seeley [16] to conclude
that open-nesting species (florea and dorsata) have a lower
overall level of activity than do the cavity-nesting species

(mellifera and cerana). It is reasonable to speculate that differences in colony activity levels are related to molecular
processes associated with worker metabolism. Our results

ral and ecological observations, and suggest that further
analyses of genes in these categories would be particularly
fruitful for understanding the ecology of genus Apis.

F/DO brain gene expression ratio

Another category of genes were those implicated in circadian processes. Finding that genes related to circadian
rhythms are overrepresented (albeit weakly) on the list of
genes showing significant species differences in brain
expression is notable from the perspective of honey bee
dance language. Brockmann and Robinson [26] discussed

possible functional connections between the circadian
system and the sun-compass system that is used by honey
bees to communicate directional information during
dance. The possibility of species differences in these systems is suggested by the fact that A. mellifera, cerana and
dorsata dance on vertical combs and transpose sun-compass based information to gravity-based information,
whereas A. florea dances on horizontal comb and does not
make this transposition.
A more detailed view of the molecular machinery that
might underlie species differences in Apis was obtained by
clustering the 145 orthologous genes that showed significant species differences in brain expression according to
their shared functional GO annotation [24]. Several
coherent groups of genes emerged from this analysis
(Table 4 and 5), in addition to clusters expected due to the
enrichment analysis described above (Table 3). Notable
among them were the categories of cell communication
and development. Genes involved in these processes
likely play important roles in brain maturation and sensory development and therefore might contribute to
behavioral differences among the species. For example,
the honey bee ortholog of Innexin 3 (Inx 3), a gene whose
protein product is important for cell-cell communication
[27], is known to be upregulated in young bees when they
are treated with the juvenile hormone analog methoprene
[8]. Such treatment also induces young bees to become
foragers [28]. Our brain transcriptome-wide expression
analysis of the four key species of honey bees have provided us with several candidate genes that can be used for
much needed comparative studies to uncover the molecular basis of interspecies differences in the genus.

Conclusion
This study is the first cross-species comparative study of
brain gene expression in honey bees. We used four species

of honey bees, three Asian and one European/Western
that are known to differ markedly in their nesting habit,
behavior and some physiological characters. We compared brain mRNA of foragers and one-day-old bees of
each species on each microarray in a replicated loop
design.
Performance results for the four species on the microarrays were comparable and in keeping with our current
understanding of Apis phylogeny [12-14]. A significant
fraction of genes in all four species followed expression
patterns consistent with a previous study comparing foragers and one-day-olds in A. mellifera from Europe [8].
218 genes were found to be expressed significantly differentially between at least two species. Principal Component Analysis revealed strong patterns in the data that
grouped the expression data into the four constituent species. Two main inferences could be drawn from the PCA
results. First, there appears to be a widespread conservation of the molecular processes in the brain underlying
adult honey bee behavioral maturation. Second, the overall pattern of differences did not reflect in an obvious way
known differences in behavior and ecology between the
four species [13,16]. However, an enrichment analysis for
Gene Ontology defined functional categories of genes
responsive to biotic stimulus, involved in defense
response, metabolism and circadian rhythms–that could
plausibly be involved in these ecological differences, as
well as in behavioral differences related to dance language.

Methods
Honey bee species
The four species of honey bees used for the experiment
were all collected from suburban areas of Bangalore, a city
in southern peninsular India. Three of these four species
are endemic to South Asia, i.e., Apis cerana (subspecies
indica, the South-Asian cavity nesting bee), A. dorsata
(Asian giant or rock honey bee) and A. florea (the Asian
dwarf honey bee). The fourth species is A. mellifera of Italian descent, introduced in India for commercial beekeeping purposes in the 1960s [29]. All collections of the
endemic species were carried out on natural colonies
except one colony of A. cerana (which was obtained from
a commercial beekeeper); A. mellifera samples were collected from full-frame hives purchased from a commercial
beekeeper.

Returning pollen foragers, easily identified by the brightly
colored pollen loads on their hind legs [28], were collected from three colonies of each species mostly during
peak foraging hours (10:00–14:00) in the month of
November, 2003. After collecting foragers, we transferred
pieces of brood comb to an incubator in the lab main-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/202

tained at 34°C. Freshly eclosed workers were collected
over the next 2–3 days within 0–12 h of emergence,
referred to as one-day-olds [10]. All samples were collected live and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Heads were removed (on dry ice) and stored at -80°C
until shipment. Heads were shipped on dry ice to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and stored upon
arrival at -80°C until further processing.
Brain dissections, total RNA extractions and microarray
hybridization
Brains were partially lyophilized as in Grozinger et al [30],
with the following changes: dissections were carried out in
an ethanol bath kept on dry ice and the subesophageal
ganglion was retained. Brains were rinsed post-dissection
in a fresh bath of ethanol on dry ice to ensure removal of
unwanted tissue debris and remnants of hypopharyngeal
glands. Pools of 15 brains were homogenized in 1 ml Trizol (Invitrogen) and vortexed with 200 μl chloroform.
The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for
2 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g (4°C). The aqueous phase was mixed with 100% ethanol and then transferred to a Qiagen RNeasy column. Subsequent steps for
extraction of total RNA were carried out as per kit instructions (Qiagen RNeasy kit for total RNA).

The four species used for the study differ markedly in their
brain sizes. Preliminary quantification studies showed
that RNA yields from brains differed between the smallest
and largest species by as much as 2 times. Therefore, after
quantification using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer
(ND-1000, Nanodrop Technologies) samples were
pooled depending on concentration to obtain uniform
yields across species (minimum pool size 30 brains, maximum pool size 60 brains). Total RNA was precipitated in
30 mM sodium acetate and 100% ethanol with 1 μg linear
acrylamide, by incubating overnight at -20°C and spinning at 12,000 g for 20 minutes. Pellet was washed in 70%
ethanol and air-dried. RNA was resuspended in appropriate volume of RNase-free water and 15 μg was added to 6
μg of dT18 primers and annealed at 70°C for 5 min.
Single-strand cDNA was synthesized using 400 U of ArrayScript (Ambion) in an ice cold reaction mixture of 10× 1st
Strand buffer, 20 U RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM
dNTP mix (total reaction volume 30 μl), incubated overnight at 42 °C. Reaction was inactivated by incubating at
70°C with 15 μl 0.1 N NaOH for 10 min and neutralized
with 15 μl 0.1 N HCl. cDNA was purified using the
Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) with modified
Tris-free buffers [31]and dried down in a SpeedVac. cDNA
was resuspended in freshly prepared sodium carbonate
buffer and dye coupled as per Whitfield et al 2003 [6],
with the exception that dye-coupled samples were pooled
only after purification on the Qiaquick PCR purification

columns. Four arrays directly compared foragers and day
olds of each colony within each species with dye-swap,
thus 12 arrays compared brain gene expression of the two
behavioral classes for each species (a total of 48 arrays
across the experiment, 1 array discarded due to technical
problems). Arrays were hybridized and scanned as
described in Whitfield et al 2002 [18], arrays were hybridized for 48 h.

standards and are available at ArrayExpress [32] under
accession number E-TABM-262. Data intensity calculations and normalization was carried out as described in
Whitfield et al [6], with the exception that the R package
MAANOVA was used for carrying out Lowess transformation and the subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA)
[33,34]. All other statistical analyses of the data were also
carried out in R. Before normalization, all genes that
showed 1.5 times higher expression in hypopharyngeal
gland tissue compared to brain tissue were discarded to
minimize possible contamination effects as in Whitfield
et al 2003 [6]. An initial analysis was performed on each

species data separately, applying an identical analysis filter. cDNAs with average expression intensity across all
arrays in a species set <300 or absent from >1 array were
excluded from the analysis. The species-specific data sets
were used to calculate hybridization efficiency and replicability. Finally, in order to enable a combined analysis of
all 47 microarrays, a common analysis filter was applied
to the data. cDNAs with average expression intensity
across all 47 arrays <300 or absent from >1 array were
excluded from the analysis. Subsequently, using available
genome sequence information [35], ESTs were matched
to the official predicted genes from the honey bee genome
project using a reverse BLAST procedure and duplicates
averaged/collapsed such that each EST represented 1 gene
[8]. There were ESTs that had no corresponding match in
the predicted gene database and those were retained as
such. This resulted in a total of 4432 genes that were used
for subsequent analysis. ANOVA was carried out on the
log2 transformed intensity values in the two dye channels
for all 4432 genes across all arrays. A derived data set was
generated using a mixed model with dye and sample (an
RNA pool of either foragers or one-day-olds) as fixed factors and array as the random factor [36]. The derived data
set was used to calculate ratios of forager to day-old brain
expression levels for every gene and each array. A second
ANOVA modeling sample (corresponding either to a colony or a species) as a factor was carried out. Finally an F
test and a post-hoc Tukey's test were carried out to find
gene expression ratios significantly different among the 4
species and between pairs of species, respectively. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) also was carried out
using the singular value decomposition (svd) function in
R. The data analyzed were the log2 transformed forager/
one-day-old ratios (F/DO) of expression data derived
from the two-step ANOVA for the 218 genes significantly
regulated between species at p < 0.001. Enrichment of
Gene Ontology (GO) [23] categories was statistically
tested through a hypergeometric test followed by the Benjamini Hochberg FDR correction using the microarray
analysis tool GOToolBox [24]. The input list was 145
known fly orthologs to the 218 genes. The functional clustering of the same genes was also carried out in GOToolBox using the WPGMA algorithm with a Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing. A minimum cluster size of
5 genes was applied.
