Abstract
Background: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted infections
globally and the leading cause of preventable blindness in the developing world. There are two
biovariants of C. trachomatis: 'trachoma', causing ocular and genital tract infections, and the invasive
'lymphogranuloma venereum' strains. Recently, a new variant of the genital tract C. trachomatis
emerged in Sweden. This variant escaped routine diagnostic tests because it carries a plasmid with
a deletion. Failure to detect this strain has meant it has spread rapidly across the country provoking
a worldwide alert. In addition to being a key diagnostic target, the plasmid has been linked to
chlamydial virulence. Analysis of chlamydial plasmids and their cognate chromosomes was
undertaken to provide insights into the evolutionary relationship between chromosome and
plasmid. This is essential knowledge if the plasmid is to be continued to be relied on as a key
diagnostic marker, and for an understanding of the evolution of Chlamydia trachomatis.
Results: The genomes of two new C. trachomatis strains were sequenced, together with plasmids
from six C. trachomatis isolates, including the new variant strain from Sweden. The plasmid from the
new Swedish variant has a 377 bp deletion in the first predicted coding sequence, abolishing the
site used for PCR detection, resulting in negative diagnosis. In addition, the variant plasmid has a 44

bp duplication downstream of the deletion. The region containing the second predicted coding
sequence is the most highly conserved region of the plasmids investigated. Phylogenetic analysis of
the plasmids and chromosomes are fully congruent. Moreover this analysis also shows that ocular
and genital strains diverged from a common C. trachomatis progenitor.
Conclusion: The evolutionary pathways of the chlamydial genome and plasmid imply that
inheritance of the plasmid is tightly linked with its cognate chromosome. These data suggest that
the plasmid is not a highly mobile genetic element and does not transfer readily between isolates.
Comparative analysis of the plasmid sequences has revealed the most conserved regions that
should be used to design future plasmid based nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid diagnostic
failures.

Background
Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of non
specific urethritis in the industrialised world, and the
major infectious cause of preventable blindness (trachoma) in the third world [1,2]. C. trachomatis can be
divided into at least 15 serovars or serotypes, distinguished by ompA sequencing [3], which are associated
with different disease pathologies [4]. Serotypes A, B, Ba
and C are generally associated with blinding trachoma
and serotypes D to K cause non-disseminating sexually
transmitted infections. These 12 serotypes are all naturally
restricted to infection of genital or ocular epithelial cells
and have not been observed to be invasive [5]. By contrast, serotypes L1, L2 and L3 cause a rare invasive and systemic sexually transmitted infection normally found in
the tropics, known as lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)
[6,7].
In October 2006 a new variant of C. trachomatis was
described in Sweden that evaded several of the then current commercial molecular diagnostic tests for detecting
the microorganism, which were based on the presence of
specific plasmid sequences [8]. A deletion of 377 bp of
plasmid DNA, in the region used for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), is responsible for the negative diagnoses [9]. All new variant strains of C. trachomatis belong
to serotype E [10]. Failure to detect the plasmid and hence
treat those infected with the new variant has led to a significant increase in cases, and in some Swedish counties
20 – 64% of current infections are caused by this strain of
C. trachomatis [10].
Strains of C. trachomatis have a highly conserved small
genome of approximately 1 Mb and harbour a plasmid of
approximately 7 kb [11]. Some plasmid-free isolates of C.
trachomatis have been described, but these are exceedingly
rare and the only viable clinical isolates described that are
plasmid free belong to serotypes L2, D and E [12-14]. The
C. trachomatis plasmids sequenced to date each contain
eight predicted coding sequences (CDSs), along with a set
of four 22 bp repeats which is understood to be the origin
of replication [15,16]. Characterization of plasmid func-

tions and of chlamydial genes in general has been greatly
impeded by the lack of a genetic system for studying C.
trachomatis [17] and so little is known about the function
of these CDSs beyond in silico predictions of function for
5 CDSs and the observation that the CDS previously designated ORF5 encodes a protein of 28 kDa (pgp3) when
expressed in Escherichia coli [18,19]. However, the role of
pgp3 in the chlamydial developmental cycle and the overall biological function of the plasmid remains unknown.
Since the study of C. trachomatis genes is hampered by the
lack of any molecular tools with which to manipulate
strains, the emergence of the new variant strain and naturally occurring mutants provides an opportunity to investigate the evolution of the plasmids and to determine
whether the evolutionary pathway of these plasmids
matches that of the chromosome. In this study the nature
and extent of chromosome and plasmid variation in C.
trachomatis has been investigated. To extend the current
dataset, two isolates of the previously unsequenced serotype B were completely sequenced, as were four plasmids
from Swedish strains belonging to serotypes E and F,
including that of the new variant strain. The plasmid is
useful as a target for diagnostic testing because it is relatively stable and hence more resistant to nuclease damage
than the genome, and present at up to ten copies per
genome [20]. Thus a detailed knowledge of the sequence
conservation and the stability of chlamydial plasmids will

be critically informative in determining whether the plasmid is a reliable target for future diagnostic tests.

Results and Discussion
Genome sequences of serotype A and B isolates of C.
trachomatis
The genomes of two serotype B ocular isolates of C. trachomatis were sequenced. These provide the first high quality
genome sequences of ocular isolates: B/TZ1A828/OT and
B/Jali20/OT (referred to as CTB and Jali20 respectively, for
ease of nomenclature), summarised in Table 1. Whole
genome comparisons showed that the genomes are highly
syntenic, and that there are no whole gene differences
between the strains. The pairwise mean nucleotide identity between orthologous genes is 99.8%. A comparison of
the genomes against that of C. trachomatis serotype A
strain A/HAR-13 (referred to as A/HAR-13) sequenced by
microarray [21] showed no insertions or deletions of predicted coding sequences (CDSs).

Previous microarray and sequencing studies have shown
that almost all sequence and gene variation distinguishing
serotypes of C. trachomatis from each other are restricted
to a region at the terminus of replication known as the
Plasticity Zone (PZ) [22-24]. It was demonstrated by
microarray and PCR analysis that a strain belonging to
serotype B lacked most of the genes found within this
region [22,23]. However, analysis of the serotype B isolates sequenced for this study showed that they possess
many of the CDSs found within the PZ (see additional file
1). These include cytotoxin gene fragments, remnants of a
much larger cytotoxin gene which is thought to have been
similar to those still found intact in C. muridarum [25]. In
a strain of C. trachomatis serotype D, a remnant of the cytotoxin gene is expressed, and is cytotoxic on HeLa cells
[26]. Consistent with previous analysis of the PZ, the
phospholipase D genes display high levels of disruption
in both serotype B strains [24]. The PZ also encompasses
the trpRBA operon, which has been found to be functional
only in genital isolates, and to carry mutations in ocular
strains [27]. This operon is non-functional in both the
strains presented here, with either the trpB (B/TZ1A828/
OT) or trpA (B/Jali20/OT) being disrupted (see additional
file 1).
Despite there being no whole gene differences between
the strains, analysis of the genomes identified several
pseudogene differences when they were compared to each
other and also with the genomes of other C. trachomatis
serotypes and biovariants A/HAR-13 and the serotype L2
strain L2/434/BU (see additional file 2). Eleven of the disrupted CDSs are common to both serotype B strains,
whereas only one of these is common also to A/HAR_13
and
L2/434/BU
(CTB_3211/JALI_3211/CTA_0350/
CTL0578). The equivalent putative membrane proteins
CTB_0571/JALI_0571 contain different inactivating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/239

mutations: a single base deletion causing a frameshift
after codon 333 (CTB), or a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) prematurely truncating the protein after
codon 177 (Jali20). Another example of a CDS with distinct inactivating mutations is the putative exported protein JALI_1341/CTA_0142. This CDS carries a frameshift
mutation in Jali20, and is truncated by a premature stop
codon leading to a loss of 60 amino acids from the C terminus in A/HAR-13.
Inclusion proteins are an important family of chlamydial
proteins, associated with virulence, which target the host
inclusion membrane. Consequently, the inactivation of
CDSs CTB_2231 and JALI_2231 encoding candidate
inclusion membrane proteins may have implications with
regard to how the cell interacts with the host. This CDS
has been disrupted by an identical SNP creating a stop
codon after codon 113 in both strains, with JALI_2231
having undergone a further single base insertion and deletion at other sites to create two additional frameshifts.
Another notable difference is the variation in the
sequence of the secF gene, which is present as a full length
gene in the serotype B strains, but is found as two separate
CDSs secD/secF in A/HAR-13 [21]. A further functional
loss is the operon comprising pyruvoyl-dependent
arginine decarboxylase and arginine/ornithine antiporter,
involved in pH homeostasis. The antiporter (CTB_3721/
JALI_3721/CTA_0406-7) is disrupted in the serotype A
and B strains, the decarboxylase (CTL0627) is disrupted in
L2/434/BU, whereas the operon is intact in the serotype D
strain D/UW-3/CX [24].
Set against a high level of sequence identity (generally in
excess of 99% identity at the nucleotide level), some predicted CDSs display higher levels of variation (see additional file 3). As has been noted before, these include
ompA, which is used to distinguish between serotypes [3],
tarp, encoding the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein [24], and hctB, encoding histone-like HC2 [28].
Phylogenetic analysis of C. trachomatis genomes
The first genome-scale, SNP-based phylogenetic analysis
of all six available C. trachomatis genomes was carried out,
covering serotypes A, B, D, L2 and L2b (Table 2). Comparative genome analysis identified 11,500 SNPs, of which
the large majority define splits between the three major
groups (Figure 1). Monophyly of LGV strains is supported
by 6200 SNPs, 1477 SNPs unite the three ocular strains
and 1377 are unique to the genital, serotype D strain.
These splits are also strongly supported in the results of
the phylogenetic analysis of the SNPs, using a general time
reversible model of evolution and four discrete gamma
distributed rate categories to account for among site rate
variation. Pairwise comparisons of the genomes by SNP
numbers also confirms this clustering (Table 3). Within
the ocular strains, the two serotype B isolates cluster

together, suggesting that serotypes are identifiable on the
basis of SNP phylogenies. These data are derived from the
genomes of six isolates (five serotypes), whilst the numbers are small they reflect the same patterns of genome
evolution observed using fragments of the genome [5]
and our data using complete genomes are strong enough
to support these associations, although further studies
would be beneficial to confirm these findings when the
technology will allow rapid easy purification of genomes
from these obligate intracellular pathogens.
Phylogenetic analysis of C. trachomatis plasmids
The plasmid sequences from the strains CTB and Jali20
were assembled from the genome shotgun. To investigate
the new variant strain which evaded diagnosis, isolates
from epithelial sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
from the city of Malmo in Sweden were included. Genital
tract isolates representing the new variant C. trachomatis
(strain Sweden2, serotype E) and three concurrently isolated strains (Sweden3, serotype E; Sweden4 and
Sweden5, both serotype F) were selected. To represent
plasmids from other chlamydial serotypes, plasmid
sequences were obtained from Genbank covering further
trachoma and LGV strains (Table 2).

Alignment of these 11 plasmid sequences showed that
there are 83 SNP locations, representing approximately
1.1% variation. Six of these occur in intergenic locations.
The SNPs and their effects on coding sequences are shown

in Figure 2. Each plasmid is unique and identifiable by the
presence of at least one SNP and/or indel (Figure 1B–D).
Only two SNPs, at positions 5,328 and 7,458 (using
pSW3 as the reference sequence), allow differentiation of
the chlamydial plasmids into LGV, trachoma and genital
tract groupings. Most of the SNPs are located within CDSs
and there is no significant clustering of SNPs within the
plasmid. Only one non-synonymous mutation occurs
within CDS2 which may suggest that this gene is under
strong selection. Analysis of the informative SNPs and
indels allowed phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships between the plasmids (Figure 1). The resulting
phylogenetic tree shows that the chlamydial plasmids segregate into tight groupings reflecting the phenotypes of
their host bacteria. The LGV plasmids are the most distantly related, with the STI and ocular strain plasmids having apparently diverged at a later time.
Comparative phylogenetics of complete genomes and
plasmids
A comparison of the phylogenies of the genomes and
plasmids is given in Figure 1. Of the serotype A, B, L2 and
L2b strains, for which both complete genome and plasmid sequence sets exist, and serotype D for which there
are independent complete genome and plasmid
sequences, the phylogenies mirror each other. The complete genomes and plasmids from the LGV strains cluster
tightly, as do those from the ocular strains, and the STI
strains branch from these and also cluster together.

The 377 bp deletion within pSW2 is situated within
CDS1, creating a frameshift which shortens the predicted
protein from 305 to 178 amino acids and removing a
primer binding site for the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). This region of the plasmid was
originally selected as the target for several commercial
diagnostic NAATS and the new variant strain became
established because infection by this strain went undetected and hence untreated [9]. Plasmid pL2 from strain L2/
434/BU contains a single nucleotide deletion within
CDS1 (position 910) [15,30] leading to a truncated CDS1
protein (260 amino acids). pCpnE1 also has a deletion
within CDS1, but the location is different to that within
pSW2 and the effect is to create two small putative CDSs,
which are unlikely to be functional.

Schematic of the location of SNPs and indels within
the chlamydial plasmids. The strain represented on the
outer circle is plasmid pCTA from strain A/HAR-13. The
positions of the CDSs are shown, with all CDSs transcribed
in a clockwise direction except CDS2. The concentric circles
represent (outer to inner): pLGV440, pUCH-1, pL2, pCTB,
pJALI, pCHL1, pSW2, pSW3, pSW4, pSW5. The red lines
indicate synonymous SNPs, the blue lines non-synonymous
SNPs and the grey lines intergenic SNPs. The green bars are
bases deleted in that plasmid, and the orange bars are regions
of insertion/duplication.

The observation of CDS1 as a region of the plasmid apparently prone to inactivation and therefore potentially dispensable may be explained by the possible functional
redundancy between the proteins encoded by CDS1 and
CDS2. These proteins have similar sizes (305 and 332
amino acids respectively), share 35% amino acid
sequence identity, and both match to the Pfam domain
PF00589 (CDS1 e-value of 0.003, CDS2 e-value of 4.9e39), suggesting some functional equivalence [29].

These data suggest that the chlamydial plasmids have not
been freely exchanged, but have remained closely linked
to their cognate host chromosome (Figure 1).
Analysis of the new variant plasmid
The plasmid with the most variation (pSW2) was found in
strain Sweden2. However, pSW2 still belongs to the genital tract lineage and therefore has not appeared as result of
a transfer event. The complete nucleotide sequence of
pSW2 comprises 7,169 bp, 333 bp smaller than the 7,502
bp plasmid (pSW3) from strain Sweden3. Sweden3 could
be hypothesised to be the potential progenitor strain of
Sweden2 because they have identical sequences of the
chromosomal ompA gene. The difference in size between
pSW2 and pSW3 is accounted for by a deletion of 377 bp
and a duplication of 44 bp at a different locus (Figure 3).
pSW2 is the smallest chlamydial plasmid described, some
200 bp smaller than the previously smallest known
chlamydial plasmid, pCpnE1 (7,369 bp), which is from
an equine strain of C. pneumoniae [29,18].

encoding CDS2 [32]. These two short 'antisense' transcripts are differentially expressed during the developmental cycle. This level of sequence conservation,
possibly tied to an essential function, suggests that the
region of the plasmid encompassing CDS2 would be a
good target for future screening.

CDS6, CDS7 and CDS8 also show high levels of amino
acid conservation. CDS6 (unknown function) is the smallest plasmid encoded protein and contains a single SNP. The
proteins encoded by CDS7 and CDS8 display homology to
proteins involved in the process of plasmid partitioning
[29], and have been shown to be active at cell division.
These proteins may play an important role for these relatively low copy number plasmids, ensuring that each
daughter cell acquires an equal number of plasmid copies.

Chlamydial isolate

Figure copy number in C. trachomatis
Plasmid 4
Plasmid copy number in C. trachomatis. Quadruplicate
samples of chromosomal DNA purified from EBs were analysed by qPCR to determine the plasmid/genome ratios (P/
G).
A second difference between the pSW2 and the other C.
trachomatis plasmids is a 44 bp perfect tandem duplication, located immediately upstream of both CDS2 and
CDS3, which are divergently transcribed. The transcription start points (tsp) for CDS2 and CDS3 (encoding a
homologue of DnaB, a protein involved in forming the
replication complex) have been mapped previously [31]
and are both located within this 44 bp section. The duplication of the tsp could potentially boost CDS2 expression.
Both the deletion in CDS1 and the 44 bp duplication are
unique to pSW2, and no intermediate plasmid carrying
either of the mutations separately has been identified.
This could indicate that these changes are related events,
and that potential up-regulation of CDS2 may compensate for the loss of a functional product from CDS1.
Candidate plasmid regions for improved diagnostic targets
When all C. trachomatis plasmid CDSs from the eleven
complete nucleotide sequences were compared, CDS2
was found to be the most highly conserved. Although
there are eleven SNPs within the coding sequence, only
one results in an amino acid change (Figure 2), suggestive
of a functional requirement. This SNP (Met-Leu, position
1,147), present in pSW2 and pSW3, is at the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein. A further constraint on variation within CDS2 is the presence of two short RNA
molecules (225 and 415 nucleotides), which are complementary to the 3' terminus of the primary transcript

The protein predicted to be encoded by CDS5, previously
designated ORF 5 (pgp3) has the largest number of nonsynonymous SNPs. There are 14 SNPs, evenly spread
throughout CDS, resulting in ten amino acid changes
(Figure 2). SNP 5,112 differentiates LGV plasmids from
the trachoma plasmids and SNP 5,114 is unique to the
blinding trachoma isolates (using pSW3 as the reference
sequence). The protein encoded by CDS5 (pgp3) has been
located to the cell surface and it has recently been suggested that the CDS5 product can be secreted from inside
the inclusion, to the cytoplasm of Chlamydia-infected cells
[33]. Thus the higher number of non-synonymous
changes in this CDS could result from immune selection
giving rise to more variation.
The area of the plasmid from the stop codon of CDS8 to
the start codon of CDS1 has the highest density of intergenic SNPs, as well as apparent deletions, making the
region the most susceptible to mutation within the C. trachomatis plasmids. Thus the area around the replication
origin is the most variable and is a poor region in which
to design diagnostic PCR primers.
Analysis of plasmid copy number
The sequencing of pSW5 revealed that this plasmid carries
one 22 bp repeat fewer than the others at the putative origin
of replication. To test whether this affects plasmid copy
number, DNA from several strains was subjected to quantitative PCR. The results showed that, where loss of the repeat
sequence had occurred, plasmid copy number was not
adversely affected, with plasmid/genome (P/G) ratios in the
range of 2–6 (Figure 4). Interestingly, it appears that genital
strains have a slightly lower plasmid copy number than the
others, and strain Jali20 has the highest P/G ratio.

Conclusion
The chromosomes and plasmids of C. trachomatis exhibit
extreme levels of sequence conservation and co-inheritance. This may be accounted for by the constraints

demanded by the obligate intracellular developmental
cycle, and the lack of a route for foreign DNA exchange.
Attempts to cure C. trachomatis of its plasmid using chemical agents have been unsuccessful [20], and viable plasmid-free isolates of C. trachomatis (plasmid extinction) are
exceedingly rare, with only three such isolates reported.
The plasmid is therefore not essential for chlamydial viability, but a recent study comparing the pathobiological
properties of a naturally occurring plasmid-free L2 isolate
with a plasmid-bearing strain suggested that the plasmid
may have a role in virulence [34]. Furthermore, studies
with plasmid cured C. muridarum showed that this strain
failed to cause disease within the infected mouse oviduct
[35].
A more detailed examination of the plasmids and genomes
of C. trachomatis was prompted by the appearance and
spread of a new variant strain in Sweden, carrying significant changes to its plasmid. Previous phylogenetic analyses
of chlamydial plasmids indicated that their evolutionary
lineage includes plasmids from other chlamydial species
[29]. Complete genome SNP analysis of the C. trachomatis
genomes and plasmids presented here indicates that the
plasmids from the lymphogranuloma biovars diverged
from the trachoma biovars first and this has been followed
by subsequent evolution of these plasmids following biological pathways of ocular or genital strains. The current
data set therefore provides no evidence that there has been
any exchange of plasmids between ocular, genital tract and
LGV serovar groupings. There is no accurate molecular
clock to measure the evolutionary rate within C. trachomatis, but as these are exclusively human pathogens it would
seem likely that these events have occurred within recent
human evolution. The discovery of the new variant C. trachomatis, undocumented before 2002, strongly suggests
either that the novel mutations within the plasmid are very
recent [10], or that this variant has become prominent due
to the reliance on a plasmid-based diagnostic test.
The cryptic plasmid is an important target for chlamydial
detection and knowledge of its structure and variation is
essential in designing accurate and sensitive new assays.
The data presented here indicate that the CDS2 region of
the plasmid is the most highly conserved part of the
sequence and thus the optimal choice for developing new
nucleic acid amplification tests. Each plasmid analysed
has a unique sequence, reflecting its associated serotype;
however the differences between some are very slight and
it is unlikely that a useful typing system could be developed based on the plasmid alone. Undoubtedly, the
changes in the new variant C. trachomatis plasmid give it a
distinctive signature which will allow its spread in new
populations to be followed. Even with these large differences between the new variant plasmid pSW2 and its
putative progenitor pSW3, it is clear that the chlamydial
plasmid remains closely associated with its cognate chro-

mosomal partner. The parallel evolution of the chlamydial plasmid and chromosome, and lack of horizontal
gene transfer, is consistent with the intracellular developmental cycle of this species.

Methods
Chlamydia and cell culture
The isolates and sources of Chlamydia trachomatis used in
this work are summarised in Table 2. Clinical samples of C.
trachomatis Sweden 3–5 were isolated in Malmo, Southern
Sweden in 2002, and Sweden 2 was obtained in 2006. They
were isolated in McCoy cell cultures by removing 100 μl of
eluate from the original swab and direct inoculation onto a
glass coverslip within a bijou containing Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) plus 0.03 M glucose, vancomycin at 10 μgml-1 and gentamicin 10 μgml-1. The inoculae
were centrifuged onto the cell cultures at 1,000 g for 1 hr at
room temperature. Following centrifugation the cell culture supernatant was removed and cycloheximide-containing medium added to the infected cells which were
incubated in 5% CO2 for 3 days. Viable C. trachomatis cells
were observed by phase contrast microscopy.

Strains of C. trachomatis Sweden 2–5 and B/Jali20/OT [36]
were negative when tested for mycoplasma contamination by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst no. 33258
staining and by using a VenorGem® Mycoplasma PCR
Detection Kit (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The McCoy cells
and BGMK cells (used for LGV isolates) were grown in
Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum. Infected monolayers
were detached with PBS containing 0.125% trypsin/
0.02% EDTA and elementary bodies (EBs) were harvested
in DMEM containing 10% FCS at 3,000 × g for 10 min.
The infected cell pellet was suspended in PBS:H2O (1:10)
and homogenised in a Dounce homogeniser to break
open cells and release the EBs. Cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 250 g for 5 min and the supernatant containing partially purified chlamydiae was mixed with an
equal volume of phosphate buffer containing 0.4 M
sucrose (2SP), prior to storage at -80°C.
Preparation of chlamydial DNA and quantitative PCR
Large scale preparations of each C. trachomatis isolate were
prepared and EBs were purified as described [37]. For the
non LGV strains confluent monolayers of cells in 75 cm2
flasks were infected by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 1 hr.
Chromosomal DNA was extracted from gradient purified
EBs using a Promega Wizard Genomic Purification kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The only modification was that purified EBs were incubated with proteinase K for 1 hr at 60°C prior to addition of the Nuclei lysis
solution. The quality of genomic and plasmid DNA recovered by this method was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. An accurate determination of plasmid and

genome copies for each DNA preparation was obtained by
performing 5'-exonuclease (TaqMan) assays [20]. The
primers and probes have been described previously and
were selected from conserved DNA sequence regions from
the databases: CDS2 from the plasmid and the chromosomal omcB gene.

Additional material
DNA sequencing and analysis
The genomes of C. trachomatis strains B/TZ1A828/OT [38]
and B/Jali20/OT [36] were sequenced to a depth of 8 ×
coverage derived from pUC18 (insert size 1.4–2.2 kb)
small insert libraries using dye terminator chemistry on
ABI3700 automated sequencers. End sequences from
larger insert plasmid (pMAQ1 9–12 kb 9–12 kb insert
size) libraries were used as a scaffold. Plasmid sequencing
was performed using custom primers (see additional file
4). Plasmid DNA was amplified using Platinum® Pfx DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen) and primer pairs 295r/460f
(product size 5 kb), 1200r/6761f (1.6 kb), 460f/3650r
(3.3 kb), 6470f/5820r (2.3 kb) and ctp6/1200r (3.5 kb).
All sequences were subject to sequencing, assembly, finishing and checking as described [39], with annotation
facilitated by the programs Artemis [40] and ACT [41].
Pseudogenes were curated manually, and the original
sequence data double checked, with truncations and
frameshifts determined through comparison with other
published C. trachomatis genomes. Plasmid CDSs with the
locus_tag XXXX_1 are referred to in the text as CDS1, etc.
The genome and plasmid sequence accession numbers are
listed in Table 2.
Phylogenetic analyses
Plasmid and genome DNA sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE v3.52 [42] and the progressive algorithm of
Mauve [43] respectively, using default parameters. Invariant sites were removed from the alignments, and an
appropriate model of evolution was identified using the
Akaike information criterion within Modeltest [44]. Maximum likelihood analysis of each alignment was carried
out in RAxML v7.0.0 [45] using this model (GTR+gamma
with 4 substitution rate categories).
