Abstract
Background: Since the end of 2009, H9N2 has emerged in Tunisia causing several epidemics in poultry industry
resulting in major economic losses. To monitor variations of Influenza viruses during the outbreaks, Tunisian H9N2
virus isolates were identified and genetically characterized.
Methods: The genomic RNA segments of Tunisian H9N2 strains were subjected to RT-PCR amplifications followed
by sequencing analysis.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that A/Ck/TUN/12/10 and A/Migratory Bird/TUN/51/10 viruses
represent multiple reassortant lineages, with genes coming from Middle East strains, and share the common
ancestor Qa/HK/G1/97 isolate which has contributed internal genes of H5N1 virus circulating in Asia. Some of the
internal genes seemed to have undergone broad reassortments with other influenza subtypes. Deduced amino
acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene showed the presence of additional glycosylation site and Leu at
position 234 indicating to binding preference to a (2, 6) sialic acid receptors, indicating their potential to directly
infect humans. The Hemagglutinin cleavage site motif sequence is 333 PARSSR*GLF341 which indicates the low
pathogenicity nature of the Tunisian H9N2 strains and the potential to acquire the basic amino acids required for
the highly pathogenic strains. Their neuraminidase protein (NA) carried substitutions in the hemadsorption (HB)
site, similar to those of other avian H9N2 viruses from Asia, Middle Eastern and human pandemic H2N2 and H3N2
that bind to a -2, 6 -linked receptors. Two avian virus-like aa at positions 661 (A) and 702 (K), similar to H5N1
strains, were identified in the polymerase (PB2) protein. Likewise, matrix (M) protein carried some substitutions
which are linked with increasing replication in mammals. In addition, H9N2 strain recently circulating carried new
polymorphism, “GSEV” PDZ ligand (PL) C-terminal motif in its non structural (NS) protein.
Two new aa substitutions (I) and (V), that haven’t been previously reported, were identified in the polymerase and matrix
proteins, respectively. Nucleoprotein and non-structural protein carried some substitutions similar to H5N1 strains.
Conclusion: Considering these new mutations, the molecular basis of tropism, host responses and enhanced
virulence will be defined and studied. Otherwise, Continuous monitoring of viral genetic changes throughout the
year is warranted to monitor variations of Influenza viruses in the field.

Background
Avian Influenza virus (AIV) is a member of the family
Orthomyxoviridae; containing negative sense single
stranded RNA [1]. Based on their pathogenecity, Two
types of AIV have been described, namely a highly
pathogenic type (HPAIV) that causes severe disease with

high mortality, and low pathogenic type (LPAIV) inducing asymptomatic or mild infection [2]. AIV subtypes,
namely H5, H7 and H9, currently endemic in poultry in
some regions of the world, have been shown to be capable of infecting humans [3,4].
By 1997, H9N2 viruses have been isolated in multiple
avian species including chickens, ducks, turkeys, quail,
geese and pigeons, throughout Asia, the Middle East,
Europe and Africa and for the first time from humans
in Hong Kong and China, in 1999 [5-7]. They could

emerge as human pathogens through reassortment in
intermediate hosts, such as pigs [6] and in avian species,
or through direct adaptation in human host [8]. These
viruses produce significant disease problems in poultry
resulting in great economic losses due to reduced egg
production or high mortality with co-infection with
other opportunistic pathogens such as infectious bronchitis viruses [9], Staphylococcus aureus, Avibacterium
paragallinarum, Escherichia coli, or immune suppression [10].
Two distinct lineages of H9N2 influenza viruses have
been defined, the North American lineage and the Eurasian lineages which consists of at least three sublineages
represented by their prototype strains: A/quail/Hong
Kong/G1/97 (G1-like), A/duck/HongKong/Y280/9
(Y280-like), A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94 (BJ94-like), and A/
chicken/Korea/38349-P96323/96 (Korean-like) [11,12].
The A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 is thought to be the
donor of 6 internal genes to the poultry and the human
H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997 [8].
In addition, some of these currently circulating H9N2
strains have acquired human-like receptor specificity
(a2, 6 sialic acids) [13] and there is concern about the
potential risk for these viruses to cross the species barriers and affect human health as the consequences of
genetic reassortments between mammalian and avian
influenza virus.
Since the end of 2009, H9N2 has emerged in Tunisia
causing several epidemics in poultry industry resulting
in major economic losses. It should be noted that

Tunisia was reportedly free from Avian Influenza infection [14].
In the present study, we report the isolation of two
Tunisian H9N2 influenza viruses that were identified,
and their genome sequences were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis characterization was performed in comparison to H9N2 sequences available in the Genbank
database.

Materials and methods
Fecal and tissue samples were collected from affected
commercial poultry and from migratory bird during the
initial outbreak. H9N2 avian influenza viruses were isolated and identified using classical laboratory methods
[15]. The isolates were propagated in specific-pathogen
free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs via the allontoic
route, and the eggs were incubated for 72-96 h at 37°C.
The collected allontoic fluids were subjected to hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests using
H9 monospecific polyclonal antisera obtained from F.A.
O. The genomic RNA segments of viruses were
extracted using viral Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using
SuperScript™ III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and appropriate upstream primers. cDNA
was amplified by PCR using described IA specific primers listed in Table 1. 5 μl of cDNA was added to the
PCR reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 2, 5 μl of 10×
PCR buffer, 2, 5 μl of 2, 5 mM dNTPs, 0, 5 μl Taq

Results
Phylogenetic analyses of surface genes of H9N2 viruses

To determine evolutionary relationships between Tunisian H9N2 isolates and those selected from the Genbank
(Table 2), phylogenetic analyses were carried out for 6
viral gene segments (i.e., the genes for hemagglutinin
(HA), neuraminidase (NA), polymerase (PB2), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M) and non structural (NS)) (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analyses based on the HA (Figure 1a)
and NA (Figure 1b) genes (nucleotides 125 to 1272 and
961 to 1370, respectively), revealed that current Tunisian (H9N2) viruses are closely related to each other
and shared closed relationship with the Middle Eastern
strains, especially A/Av/SA/91013406/06, A/Ck/Em/
R666/02, A/Ck/Du/338/01 and Ck/Pak/UL01/08. Percentage similarity scores, calculated from pairwaise
alignments, supported the phylogenetic results and
revealed a similarity score of more than 96% (Table 3).
Tree analyses showed that Middle Eastern strains are
grouped in G1 lineage and shared a common ancestor
with A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 isolates.
Phylogenetic analyses of internal genes

Four internal genes (PB2, NP, M and NS) of Tunisian
H9N2 strains showed more than 96% nucleotide identity
with those of the Middle Eastern strains isolated from
2001 and 2008 (Table 3).
The phylogenetic studies of the PB2 genes were analysed using the 540- base-long nucleotide sequence

(nucleotides 1591 to 2130) that codes the region of PB2
protein located between positions 530 and 710. Tree
analysis of the PB2 gene showed that Ck/TUN/12/10
and Migratory bird/TUN/51/10 isolates are related to
the Middle Eastern isolates (more than 97% similarity)
and fall into a single group within the G1-like lineage
(Figure 1c).
In the NP gene tree (Figure 1d), representative H9N2
viruses clustered into two distinct lineages, the G1-lineage including Middle Eastern, Qa/HK/G1/97, Asian
strains, and Dk/HK/Y283/97 H5N1 like lineage. Besides,
the H9N2 Tunisian isolates shared 97% to 98% similarity
with other isolates such as A/Av/SA/91013406/06, A/
Ck/Em/R666/02, A/Ck/Du/338/01 and showed a “sister
group” relationship with H6N1 viruses of more than
97%.
The matrix genes (Figure 1e) (regions of the overlapping reading frames of M1-M2, nucleotides 7 to 845) of
Ck/TUN/12/10 and MB/TUN/51/10 strains showed a
close relationship to those of Middle Eastern (95% to
98% similarity), and to other subtypes such as, Ck/
KHNC/100/04 H7N3 (96.93%), Dk/HK/Y283/97 H5N1
(95.74%), ph/HK/SSP44/02 H6N1 (95.23%) strains.
The NS gene (nucleotides 1591 to 2130) of Ck/TUN/
12/10 showed evidence of reassortment with other viral
subtypes. It was 95% and 92.9% similar to those of A/
gs/11/99 (H6N1) and CK/HK/8761/01 (H5N1), respectively (Figure 1f).
Molecular characteristics

To analyze the receptor binding site, the connecting
peptide and the Hemadsorption site of neuraminidase
specificity of the Tunisian isolates, we have compared

the HA amino acid sequences (deduced from the
nucleotide sequences) with those of representative
viruses from GenBank.
Hemagglutinin

The molecular determinants of pathogenecity and virulence of the HA protein are the HA1/HA2 connecting
peptide sequence, specific amino acids (aa) residues at
the receptor binding site (RBS), and the presence or
absence of glycosylation sites around the receptor binding site.
HA cleavage site motif sequence of the Tunisian isolates was 333 PARSSR* GLF341 which is similar to other
Asian H9N2 viruses including those from Hong Kong,
Japan, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, Dubai.
Residues at positions 110, 161, 163, 191, 198, 234, 235
and 236 are major components of the receptor binding
site of the HA molecule. Tunisian viruses showed conservation of residues P110, W161, T163, H191, A198 and
I235 in the receptor binding pocket. The left (aa residues
at position 234-239) and right (aa residues at position
148-152) edge of the binding pocket motif were: NGL/
QIGR and GTSKS, respectively.
The A/CK/TUN/12/10 H9N2 strain carried the amino
acid substitution (Q234L), a mutation that correlates
with a shift in affinity of the HA from avian type sialic
receptors to human type and from a preference for a
2..3. link to a 2..6. link between the sialic acid residues
and galactose, whereas A/Migratory Bird/TUN/51/10
having Glu Q at this position. But, both strains had Gly
(G) at position 228 at the RBS.
Analysis of HA protein sequences showed that Tunisian H9N2 isolates have many potential glycosylation

(NVT), 218-220 (NRT), 298-300 (NST), 305-307 (NIS)
(Table 4).
HB site of Neuraminidase

Analysis of the neuraminidase active and framework
sites of the NA protein revealed mutations in aa residues on 3 loops that interact directly with sialic acid; on
loops carring amino acids 367-370-372, the three Ser (S)
were substituted by KLA respectively, also D and Y substitution were found at residues 401, 406 respectively.
Otherwise, the framework site contains R371, A372, N402,
and E425 (Table 5).
Molecular characteristics of internal proteins

The current Tunisian strains displayed Glu (E) at position 627 of the PB2 protein; therefore, a change to Lys
could serve as a marker of the virulence phenotype. In
addition, two avian virus-like aa at positions 661 (A)
and 702 (K), similar to Ck/HK/8733/01 H5N1 strain isolated in 2001, were found (Table 5).
The nucleoprotein (NP) of Tunisian H9N2 strains
retained conserved G1-lineage defining residues: R422,
K430, T442, D455 and D480. However, Ser to Phe substitution at residue 402, found exclusively in Tunisian

strains, similar to H5N1 strain circulated in 1997. Other
aa specific for the nucleoprotein (NP) gene associated
with host range, were not studied (Table 5).
Alignment of the M2 protein of current Tunisian
H9N2 strains showed conserved G1 lineage defining Leu
residue at position 10. None of the Tunisian isolates
contained substitutions at amino acid positions 26, 27,
30, 31 or 34, suggesting the absence of resistance to M2
blockers antiviral drugs such as amantadine. However,
we have identified some substitutions at position 16
(Gly, G), 28 (Ile, I), related to the ion channel domain
and associated with host range. In addition, Ile, Val and
Pro substitutions were present in Tunisian H9N2 viruses
at residue 15 (V15I), 46 (L46V) and 54 (S54P) of M1
protein, respectively. Avian virus like aa such as: V115, T
121
and T 137 were also observed (Table 6).
Based on the analysis of the non structural protein
gene (NS), our recent isolates did not show the five
amino acid (80TIAS84) deletions, resulting in an NS1
protein of 230 amino acid in length and containing the
“GSEV” PDZ ligand (PL) C-terminal motif, and did not
harbor the mutation of Asp (D) to Glu (E) at position
92, required for high virulence. Besides, The RNA-binding domain exhibited amino acid residues P31, D34,
R35, R38, K41, G45, R46 and T49. However, the effector
domain carried the F103L, R184G and K217N

observed (Table 6).

Discussion
Infections of domestic poultry, especially chickens with
H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) have been
frequently reported in China, other Asian and North
American countries, since the late 1990s. They have
been grouped in different sublineages on the basis of
antigenic and genetic properties. Although, H9N2
viruses do not satisfy the criteria for highly pathogenic
avian influenza, they are unique among this category,
infecting a wide variety of species, including chickens
[21,22], quails [23], pigeons [24], turkeys [25], ducks
[25-27], geese, pigs [28], and humans. Several studies
have reported that G1- like H9N2 viruses can infect
humans and can replicate in human alveolar epithelial

cells and mouse respiratory system. Interestingly, they
could emerge as human pathogens though reassortement in intermediate hosts, such as pigs and avian species, or through direct adaptation to human.
Since late 2009, H9N2 influenza A viruses have
caused many outbreaks in Tunisian flocks. A second
wave of AI was reported during July-October 2010.
Here, we have provided the first comprehensive
genetic data for the H9N2 subtype viruses circulating
in Tunisian poultry flocks. Strains were collected from
two different governorates situated in the northeastern
part of Tunisia. Our findings revealed that H9N2 virus
infection is well established in some Tunisian endemic
areas. Therefore, understanding the genetic and the
biological characteristics of H9N2 virus isolated from
different species and regions can provide a comprehensive insight into the biology of H9N2, the ecology of
AI virus, and the ability of migratory birds to disseminate influenza viruses.

PL motif is referred as PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminal end of the NS1 protein,

The Blast analysis (NCBI) of the nucleotide sequences
of HA and NA genes showed that A/Ck/TUN/12/10
and A/Migratory Bird/TUN/51/10 were the most closely
related to the Middle Eastern isolates belonging to the
G1- like lineage in the H9N2 subtype (more than 96.5%
similarity).
The results of the phylogenetic analyses were basically
in agreement with the blast data, and confirmed that
our isolates fall, together with the Middle Eastern
strains, into a distinct cluster, related to the G1 lineage;
a finding that may indicate a common origin.
The internal PB2, NP, M, NS genes were also similar
to those of other Middle Eastern strains, which can be
traced back to the same G1- like lineage. In addition,
NP and NS genes seemed to have undergone broad
reassortments with H5N1, H7N3, H7N1, H6N1 influenza virus subtypes as described for previous isolated
strains [18,29,30]. This diversity reflects an increased
spread of such viruses through avian species’ migration.
It is difficult to explain whether and how these reassortments have occurred because of the lack of local and
regional epidemiological information.

NLS is referred to nuclear localization signal, not done.

Based on the deduced amino acid sequences, the
HA1-HA2 connecting peptides of the Tunisian avian
H9N2 isolates did not harbor multiple basic amino
acids: PARSSR/GL as found for recently isolated H9
viruses in Middle East [31] and Asia [32,33]. This might
indicate the LPAI nature of H9N2 strains, although the
motif for these viruses is similar to the RX-RYK-R
required for the highly pathogenic H5 and H7 subtypes
[34,35]. These genetic findings suggested that our H9N2
viruses may have the potential to acquire basic amino
acids in the HA connecting peptide sequence needed to
become highly pathogenic through the addition of single
basic amino acid at the -4 position.
Moreover, A/Migratory bird/TUN/51/10 possessed a
Glu (Q) at position 234 in the HA1 portion (H9 numbering; 226 in H3 numbering), whereas A/Ck/TUN/12/
10 showed a leu (L), a receptor binding site residue,
typical for human influenza virus displaying human
virus-like cell tropism through an association with a preferential binding of sialic acid (SA) to galactose in a 2, 6
linkage [9,36]. A leu (L) residue at position 234 in the
HA receptor binding site (RBS) was found to be

Tombari et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:467
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/467

important for the transmission of the H9N2 viruses in
ferrets [37]. In previous study, Wan suggested that
Q234L substitution, found in G1, Y280 and G9 lineages,
isolated in Hong Kong, allows H9N2 viruses to preferentially infect non ciliated cells and grow more efficiently in human airway epithelial cell cultures; thus,
increasing the infection severity in humans [12]. Our
findings suggested that A/Ck/TUN/12/10 may have segregated from the migratory A/Migratory bird/TUN/51/
10 strain acquiring an affinity for the human receptor
binding profile. These findings may be attributed to a
particular introduction of a new virus that has been circulating within poultry species.
Remarkably, residue at position 198 within the receptor binding pocket has been reported to influence the
affinity of virus binding to SA receptor; high affinity to
the human like receptor being with V at position 198,
intermediate with T and low with A [38]. It can be predicted that the Tunisian A/Ck/TUN/12/10 isolate has a
weaker affinity binding to human like receptor, but this
finding need to be further confirmed by experimental
studies.
Analysis of potential glycosylation site motif N-X-S/T
in the HA1 protein of Tunisian H9N2 isolates, revealed
some sites at positions 82, 105, 141, 298, 305. Additional
glycosylation site at position 168 was observed compared with representative reference strains. It has been
suggested that the alteration in the glycosylation pattern
influences the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to
poultry by altering their pathogenecity and antigenicity
and helps to the evasion from the host antibody
response [39-41].
The NA of the new Tunisian isolates carried substitutions in the HB site, similar to those of other avian
H9N2 viruses isolated in Asia and Middle Eastern during human pandemic H2N2 and H3N2 that bind to a
-2, 6 -linked receptors [42]. These viruses were showed
to be under a positive selection pressure, resulting in
compatible combinations of HA and NA [38].
Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the Tunisian H9N2 isolates displayed Glu (E) at position 627 of
the PB2 protein. Likewise, a single aa substitution in
PB2 protein (E627K) can dramatically alter the virulence
and enhance viral replication in mice [43] and other
mammals [44-46]. Two avian virus-like aa at positions
661 (A) and 702 (K), as seen in H5N1 strains, were
identified in the PB2 protein. These specific aa are
located in the functional domain responsible for interaction with other polymerase components [47].
The main function of the NP is encapsidation of the
viral genome to form a ribonucleoprotein particle for
transcription and packaging; it interacts with other viral
PB1, PB2, M1 and cellular proteins (Importin a, F-actin,
CRM1/exportin 1) for viral transcription and nuclear

Page 9 of 12

transportation controls [48]. The NP aa sequence of the
Tunisian isolates retained conserved G1-lineage defining
residues. Interestingly, a new mutation (S402F), which
has not been seen before, was detected in the NP protein. This mutation was previously found in the H5N1
subtype instead of Ser in all other H9N2 subtypes compared in this study (Table 5).
It has been reported that aa residues at positions 15,
115, 121, 137, 240 in virus matrix protein are linked
with increased replication in mammals or increased
pathogenecity in small animal models [49,50]; an Ile
substitution was present in Tunisian H9N2 viruses at aa
position 15 (V15I). No one contained substitutions at aa
positions 26, 27, 30, 31 or 34 within the transmembrane
domain of M2 protein, maintaining a genotype associated with sensitivity to adamantadine M2 blocker antiviral drugs [51]. It has been known that amantadine
binds to the ion channel region of the M2 protein and
prevents the release of viral RNA into cells [52]. Tunisian H9N2 strains harbor two human virus- like amino
acids at positions 16 (Gly, G) and 28 (Ile, I) which are
related to the ion channel domain and associated with
host range (49, 50), but the role of these substitutions
on increased replication efficiency in mammalian cells is
not yet known.
A Val substitution at position 46 was also detected for
the first time in our strains; however, all other H9N2
and other IA subtypes have leu at this position (Table
6). Interestingly, this substitution should be considered.
Recent studies have suggested that NS1 protein suppresses the host antiviral defenses at multiples levels
and correlation between NS1 and virulence has been
reported [53-55]. Molecular analysis showed that our
isolates contained an NS1 protein, with 230 aa in lengh,
typical of H9N2 viruses. A recent study has shown that
increasing the length of the 2009 H1N1 NS1 protein to
230 aa does not increase virus replication in human and
pig cells [56]. Other study showed that viruses containing NS1 truncations were found to induce more interferon than viruses with full- length NS1 proteins and
were correspondingly more attenuated in mice [57].
In the RNA- binding domain of NS1, A/Ck/TUN/12/
2010 isolate contained R38 and K41, which are shown
to be critical for RNA binding. as well amino acid residues P31, D34, R35, G45, R46, T49 and D55, which also
mediate NS1-dsRNA interaction. Residue 55 is located
within the third alpha- helix (residues 54-70) of the
dsRNA-binding domain (RBD (residues 1-73) of NS1
[58]. It is documented that variation of NS1-55 from
Asp (D) to gly (G) represents loss of changed aa which
may stabilize the coiled- coiled helical structure. In addition, our strains exhibited no differences in the second
nuclear localization sequences (NLS2) motif, or change
in the amino acid D at position 92. Some studies

Tombari et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:467
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/467

reported a mutation of asp (D) to Glu (E) to be related
to virulence of H5N1 in mammalian species and cytokine resistance [59]. Nevertheless, their effector domain
carried Leu at position 103 and Gly at residue 184. In
fact, F103L and M106I mutations are adaptive genetic
determinants of growth and virulence in both human
and avian NS1 genes in the mouse model [60]. Likewise,
it has been demonstrated that, in addition to its contribution to cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor
(CPSF) binding, Gly 184 strongly influence viral virulence by an unknown mechanism which does not
involve the INF system [61].
An Asp (N) was found at residue 217 only in Ck/
TUN/12/2010 strain that differs from the other H9N2
strains which have K at this position, but similar to
those of H5N1 strain CK/HK/8761/01 (Table 4). However, the biological significance of this substitution is
not yet known.
Also, Ck/TUN/12/2010 didn’t exhibit a five amino
(80TIAS84) deletion observed in 2001 in poultry in Hong
Kong and has, since, became the most common sequence
found in the HP viruses. Long et al, demonstrated that
viruses containing NS1 with 5 amino acid deletion
(80TIAS84) residues showed increased virulence in both
mouse and poultry [62] but the biological significance of
these deletions is not fully understood yet.
Fortunately, previous study, performed on large scale
sequence analysis of viruses isolated from different birds
and mammalian species, have identified that the C-terminal domain of NS1 functions as a species-specific virulence domain: the vast majority of avian influenza viruses
have an NS1 protein with a PDZ ligand (PL) C-terminal
ESEV domain, while typical human viruses have a conserved RSKV domain. NS1 proteins with C-terminal
ESEV, KSEV, and EPEV domains were shown to bind to
PDZ domains containing cellular proteins [63,64]. Soubies et al demonstrated that RSKV motif, which lacks a
PDZ- binding domain, replicated to higher titers than
ESEV in humans and ducks cells, suggesting the ability of
NS1 to interact with PDZ containing proteins does not
contribute to virulence in the host species [65]. Nevertheless, it has been showed that insertion of four C-terminal
aa, either ESEV, KSEV, or EPEV, into avirulent viruses
resulted in an increase in virus virulence and caused
severe disease in mice [52]. The H9N2 viruses recently
isolated in Tunisia, have a PL motif “GSEV” previously
found in Dubai strains during 2001-2003 (data not published); but the biological signification of this motif is
unknown. Interestingly, the E227G mutation in NS1
introduces an S70I mutation into nuclear export protein.

Conclusion
In the present study, we characterized two Tunisian
H9N2 strains isolated from disease outbreaks in

Page 10 of 12

commercial chicken and migratory bird from different
geographic areas. Our findings indicate that CK/TUN/
12/10 isolate has evolved and reassorted with other
influenza viruses and has acquired an affinity for the
human receptor binding profile. Otherwise, the biological significance of new detected substitutions founded in
some internal genes and the PDZ ligand polymorphism
of the NS protein should be tested.
Actually and face to the high mortality, we are preparing for an active program to develop and evaluate vaccines against H9N2 to control the further spread of the
disease in the industrial poultry production sectors.
Interestingly, continuous monitoring of viral genetic
changes throughout the years is warranted to monitor
variations of Influenza viruses in the field.
