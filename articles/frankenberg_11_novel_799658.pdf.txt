A novel MSMB-related microprotein in the
postovulatory egg coats of marsupials
Stephen Frankenberg*, Jane Fenelon, Bonnie Dopheide, Geoff Shaw and Marilyn B Renfree

Abstract
Background: Early marsupial conceptuses differ markedly from those of eutherian mammals, especially during
cleavage and early blastocyst stages of development. Additionally, in marsupials the zona pellucida is surrounded
by two acellular layers, the mucoid coat and shell, which are formed from secretions from the reproductive tract.
Results: We report the identification of a novel postovulatory coat component in marsupials, which we call
uterinesecreted microprotein (USM). USM belongs to a family of disulfide-rich microproteins of unconfirmed
function that is found throughout deuterostomes and in some protostomes, and includes b-microseminoprotein
(MSMB) and prostate-associated microseminoprotein (MSMP). We describe the evolution of this family in detail,
including USM-related sequences in other vertebrates. The orthologue of USM in the tammar wallaby, USM1, is
expressed by the endometrium with a dynamic temporal profile, possibly under the control of progesterone.
Conclusions: USM appears to have evolved in a mammalian ancestor specifically as a component of the
postovulatory coats. By analogy with the known properties of MSMB, it may have roles in regulating sperm
motility/survival or in the immune system. However, its C-terminal domain is greatly truncated compared with
MSMB, suggesting a divergent function.

Background
Marsupial conceptuses are surrounded by three extracellular investments (reviewed [1]). The innermost layer,
the zona pellucida, is deposited during oogenesis and
occurs in all mammals. After ovulation and fertilisation,
it becomes surrounded by a thick, translucent layer
mucoid coat that is deposited during passage through
the oviduct and traps non-fertilising sperm. By the time
the conceptus arrives in the uterus, the mucoid coat has
become surrounded by a thin, dense, shell coat derived
mainly from secretions in the utero-tubal junction and
the uterus [2-4]. During the period we define as “preliminary blastocyst expansion”, the mucoid coat narrows
as it becomes compressed between the expanding zona
pellucida and the outer shell coat. During “secondary
expansion”, the shell coat itself expands from an initial
diameter of about 200-300 μm up to ~17 mm, increasing its volume dramatically from 0.001 mm3 to > 0.250
mm3 [5]. The shell coat finally ruptures approximately
two-thirds of the way through pregnancy, or 3-8 days

before birth [6], under the influence of proteases
secreted by the endometrium [7], after which attachment occurs.
A previous study [2] made substantial progress in
identifying components of the postovulatory coats of the
brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the stripefaced dunnart (Sminthopsis macroura). The authors isolated individual protein components by electrophoresis
and sequenced their N-terminal regions. The short
sequences obtained (12-15 residues) for twelve excised
protein bands (seven from possum and five from dunnart) could not initially be identified due to insufficient
bioinformatic resources for these species at the time.
Since that study, one band was identified as similar to τcrystallin/enolase 1 and termed CP4 (coat protein 4) [8].
Genomes have now been sequenced from two marsupials - the South American grey short-tailed opossum
(Monodelphis domestica) [9], and more recently the
Australian tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) (in
press). With these new resources at hand, we re-examined the published protein sequences of Casey et al. [2]
and identified one of them from the brushtail possum.
We show that the gene encoding this protein, which we

call uterinesecreted microprotein (USM) is a paralogue
of MSMB (b-microseminoprotein; also called PSP94, binhibin and IgBF). MSMB is a disulfide-rich, low molecular weight protein that is a major component of seminal fluid and is strongly expressed in the prostate gland
as well as in other tissues, especially of the reproductive
system and in mucosal membranes. Its specific function
is not known, but it may have roles in inhibition of
sperm motility [10,11], suppression of immune response
against allogeneic sperm [12], toxin defence [13,14],
pituitary-gonadal axis signalling [15-17] and suppression
of prostate tumorigenesis [18-22]. Very little is known
of MSMP, which is similar to MSMB but more highly
conserved among species, apart from its expression in a
prostate cancer cell line [23]. USM is similar to both
MSMB and MSMP in its conserved sequence of disulfide bond-forming cysteine residues, but most of the
region homologous to the C-terminal domain of MSMB
is absent. In this study, we examine the evolution of
USM/MSMB/MSMP-related microproteins in vertebrates. We discuss how, as a component of the marsupial postovulatory coats, USM could provide important
clues for elucidating the roles of MSMB and other
related proteins, with possible applications in prostate
cancer, immunity and fertility control.

Results & Discussion
Identification of postovulatory coat proteins

Protein sequences from Casey et al [2] were used to
search GenBank databases using the tBLASTn algorithm
with low-stringency search parameters. The alignments
of sequences from Casey et al [2] with an expressed
sequence tag [GenBank accession EG617409] derived
from the reproductive tract of the brushtail possum is
shown in Figure 1. The major sequence from Band 5
(14 kDa) matched closely the translated possum EST,
while minor sequences from Bands 3 (22 kDa), 4 (17
kDa) and 5 also showed identity. We named this protein
uterine secreted microprotein (USM).
The translated sequence of the possum EST was used
to identify exons in the tammar wallaby (Macropus
eugenii) whole genome shotgun (WGS) database, which
revealed an apparent four-exon structure with an open
reading frame spanning Exons 2-4 (Figure 2). A second,
more divergent homologue was also identified bioinformatically. We refer to these genes respectively as tammar USM1 and USM2. Conserved exons in the
opossum genome were identified as a homologue of
USM.
Exon 1 of tammar USM1 was determined by 5’ RACE
and differed from that of the brushtail possum EST. In
the opossum genome, Exons 2-4 of the brushtail possum EST map to Chromosome 1 whereas the “first
exon” maps to Chromosome 8, immediately upstream of

the third exon of another gene, WASH1. To resolve this
discrepancy and to characterise fully the genomic locus
of tammar USM1, we isolated and sequenced a tammar
genomic BAC clone containing the gene. In a single
assembled 89.8-kb contig of BAC sequence [GenBank
accession JN251945], no sequence matching the “first
exon” of the brushtail possum EST was present in the
17.1 kb upstream of Exon 2, however Exon 1 as identified by 5’ RACE was located upstream of Exon 2, as
expected. USM2 was located downstream of USM1 in
the BAC sequence and in the same orientation. USM2
also contains exons homologous to Exons 1-4 (Figure
3). We conclude that the “first exon” of the brushtail
possum EST represents an anomaly or an artefact of
cDNA library construction. Downstream of USM2 and
in the same orientation as USM1 and USM2 in the BAC
sequence, we identified the first 8 exons of ELP3 (Figure
3), which also flanks USM in the opossum genome. This
confirmed that opossum USM is orthologous to the
tammar USM1/USM2 cluster. However, unlike in the
tammar, no duplicate of USM was found at this locus in
the opossum.

Figure 2 Sequence and translation of tammar USM1 and opossum USM aligned with brushtail possum EST. Note that the “first exon” in
the brushtail possum EST is excluded from this alignment, as it appears to be an artefact (see text). Sequences extend from the transcription
start site, determined for tammar USM1 by 5’ RACE, to the predicted polyadenylation signal. The signal peptide cleavage site is indicated by an
arrowhead.

A signal peptide cleavage site was predicted at the
same position in all three species (Figure 2 and additional file 1: Protein_alignment.pdf), strongly indicative
of a secretory protein and consistent with a role in the
extracellular postovulatory coats. In the brushtail possum, the predicted cleavage site also immediately precedes the major sequence from band 5 (compare Figure
1 and additional file 1: Protein_alignment.pdf), which
was obtained by N-terminal sequencing.
In eutherian sequence databases, the highest translated
sequence identity with the USM genes was found in
orthologues of MSMB and another related gene, MSMP
(also called PSMP). USM is not an orthologue of either
of these genes, however, as other genes corresponding
respectively to orthologues of MSMB and MSMP were
identified in both tammar and opossum genomes. Thus
USM is a novel mammalian gene that is absent in the
eutherian lineage.
The four-exon structure of marsupial USM genes is
similar to that of MSMB, including a predicted

translation initiation codon in the three 3’-most nucleotides of Exon 1 (Figure 4). USM and MSMB both differ
from MSMP, which is comprised of only three coding
exons, homologous to USM/MSMB Exons 2-4. Thus for
ease of comparison, the exons of MSMP are hereafter
referred to according to their homology with USM/
MSMB exons. The full coding region and splicing structure of tammar USM1 was confirmed by RT-PCR followed by cloning and sequencing (not shown).
The USM/MSMB/MSMP gene family

To examine the evolution of the MSMB/MSMP/USM
gene family, we performed low stringency tBLASTn
searches of GenBank databases and identified numerous
homologues in vertebrate genomes as well as in those of
lower deuterostomes, including Ciona spp. (Urochordata), Branchistoma lanceolatum (Cephalochordata) and
Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata), and of
protostomes, including those recently reported in the
phyla Mollusca and Rotifera [24]. (See additional file 2:
Sequence_sources.pdf for sources of all sequences used
in this study.) Most of the identified genes were previously unreported. Alignment of a large number of
translated sequences (not shown) suggested a complex
pattern of evolution with rapid sequence changes and
gene duplication events. As previously reported [23],
MSMP showed the strongest conservation among vertebrates. Because of the large number of amino acid substitutions, the phylogenetic relationship between family

members from distantly related species was not readily
resolved by standard bootstrapping methods, with the
exception of MSMP-like genes (not shown). Nevertheless, three broad sub-families appeared to be represented
among vertebrates: MSMP-like, MSMB-like and USMlike(see additional file 3: Tree.pdf).
Conserved synteny among MSMB/MSMP/USM family
members

To clarify the relationships among MSMB/MSMP/USM
family members, we examined their conservation of synteny with flanking genes. We focussed particularly on
MSMB-like and USM-like genes as they showed the
most sequence variability. The most informative syntenic groups are summarised in Figure 5.
In the opossum genome, USM flanks ARID5A while
14 tandem copies of MSMB flank FAM21C and
ANUBL1. In the chicken, 3 tandem copies of MSMB
also flank FAM21C and ANUBL1, which are located
near ARID5B (a paralogue of ARID5A) on chromosome
6, whereas no MSMB/USM-like gene is located near
ARID5A on chromosome 22. By contrast, USM-like
genes lie close to ARID5A in the lizard genome and
arid5a in the zebrafish genome. This suggests that the
same duplication event that generated ARID5A and
ARID5B also generated USM-like and MSMB-like genes,
respectively. This duplication event can be traced to
prior to the divergence of the teleost fish lineage (which
has also undergone its own genome duplication event
[25]) and is associated with the generation of other
paralogous pairs (ANTRX1/ANTRXL and others not
shown) that variably cluster with ARID5A/ARID5B in

vertebrate genomes (Figure 5). Both of these paralogous
syntenic groups variably contain a homologue of PPYR1,
with some lineages (such as lizard and zebrafish) containing a homologue in both syntenic groups.
USM homologues in other vertebrates

The presence of paralogous syntenic clusters conserved
throughout vertebrates allowed orthologues of USM to
be clearly identified. Among non-mammalian tetrapods,
the most similar sequence to USM found was from the
genome of the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis).
Multiple copies of USM-related genes in the lizard flank
ARID5A, as does opossum USM and a cluster of three
USM-like genes in the zebrafish genome (Figure 5).
These genes appear to be orthologous with respect to
their origin, thus we refer to the lizard genes as USMH1
to -7 (USM homologue 1 to 7) and the zebrafish genes
as usmh1 to -3 (USM homologue 1 to 3). They may not
have equivalent function to USM, however, as the lizard
and zebrafish genes have retained a complete Exon 4
encoding the C-terminal domain, in contrast to marsupial USM genes in which the open reading frame encoding this domain is greatly truncated. They also have four
coding exons (Figure 4), which is supported by transcript evidence (see additional file 2: Sequence_sources.
pdf). Published cDNA sequences from the Habu snake
(Trimeresurus flavoviridis) [26] are similar to the lizard
USMH genes. Like the lizard and zebrafish USMH
genes, the snake genes are more similar to each other
(not shown), suggesting that they also represent a lineage-specific expansion in copy number. These genes
encode small serum proteins, SSP1-5, which appear to

have a role in protection against the snake’s own venom
rather than in reproduction [13,14]. USMH-like
sequences were also found in cDNAs derived from
mixed tissues of the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). According to the NCBI UniGene EST expression
profiles, zebrafish usmh transcripts are found largely in
the reproductive tract and consist mostly of usmh2 and
usmh3 transcripts. Although it is possible that USMH
proteins in other vertebrates also contribute to postovulatory coats, this appears unlikely due to their apparent
additional expression in non-reproductive tract tissues.
Furthermore, no specifically USM-like sequences were
identified in the two sequenced avian genomes, chicken
(Gallus gallus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), in
which conservation of postovulatory coat proteins might
be expected. Thus it appears that a USMH gene evolved
a novel role in the postovulatory coats of a common
mammalian ancestor.
An apparent orthologue of USM is also present in the
genome of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus),
based on sequence similarity of Exons 1-3 and proximity
to an orthologue of Flj1008, which also flanks Arid5a on
mouse chromosome 1 (Figure 5). However platypus

Exon 4 could not be identified either manually or using
gene prediction software, thus it could not be determined whether it encodes the same C-terminal truncation as marsupial USM. Our failure to detect Exon 4
argues that it probably has a truncated open reading
frame and therefore platypus USM is likely to be functionally equivalent to marsupial USM rather than other
vertebrate USMH genes.
MSMB paralogues in birds and marsupials

Our phylogenetic analysis of avian MSMB homologues
revealed three distinct but previously unrecognised paralogous groups. The three chicken paralogues, which we
term avian MSMB1, MSMB2 and MSMB3, flank each
other on chromosome 6. Thus unlike in New World
monkeys [27], in which multiple copies of MSMB
appear to have arisen independently, avian MSMB paralogues are apparently conserved. Furthermore, each
avian MSMB paralogue shows high conservation in its
translated sequence with its respective orthologues. Previously characterised sequences from chicken and
ostrich (Struthio camelus) designated as MSMB [15,28]
correspond to MSMB1, while the gene currently

Frankenberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:373
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/373

annotated as MSMB by the NCBI “Gene” database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?term=msmb%20gallus
corresponds to MSMB2. A partial transcript of MSMB3
from chicken [GenBank accession DT655693] is annotated as being derived from reproductive tract ("testis,
ovary and oviduct”), while a full transcript from duck
(Anas platyrhynchos) [GenBank accession HO188240]
was derived from a screen for genes expressed in the
epithelium of the magnum (part of the reproductive
tract) and correlated with high egg hatchability [29].
Avian MSMB1-3 genes differ markedly from each
other in their degree of conservation. Translated
sequence identities of the MSMB paralogues of zebra
finch (order Passeriformes) were compared with their
respective orthologues from Anseriformes (duck) and/or
Galliformes (chicken, duck and turkey), the latter two
orders forming a monophyletic clade [30]. Conservation
is notably higher among MSMB3 orthologues (81-82%
amino acid identity) compared with MSMB1 (54-60%)
and MSMB2 (53-56%) (see additional file 4:
avian_MSMBs.pdf for table of sequence identities and
similarities). The pattern was similar when comparing
within Galliformes (chicken versus turkey): 83% amino
acid identity for MSMB1, 89% for MSMB2 and 98% for
MSMB3. Mouse Msmb is more similar to avian MSMB2
(32-36% amino acid identity) than either MSMB1 (2528%) or MSMB3 (23-25%). These data suggest that
avian MSMB3 has acquired a novel, specialised role in
birds distinct from that of other vertebrate MSMB
homologues. Considering the tissue source of the only
two known transcripts, this role is likely to be related to
reproduction. Ostrich MSMB1 was originally identified
in the pituitary gland [15], supportive of a previously
proposed role in the pituitary-gonadal axis [17,19,20],
although this role was later refuted [31,32].
In the opossum, we identified fourteen paralogues of
MSMB, which we termed MSMB1 to -14, flanking each
other on chromosome 1 (Figure 5). Similarly in the tammar, we identified at least ten presumed MSMB paralogues, although not all exons could be identified and
their synteny could not be confirmed. One tammar
homologue, designated MSMB1, is very similar to opossum MSMB1 and presumably orthologous to it. MSMB1
from tammar and opossum are strongly divergent from
the other MSMB homologues of both species and are
significantly longer within Exon 3 (not shown). Thus
only the MSMB paralogues that flank MSMB1 (presumably in tammar as well as opossum), but not MSMB1
itself, have undergone multiple duplications independently within each lineage.
The above conclusions in birds and marsupials are
supported by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 6). Significant
(> 70%) bootstrap values were obtained supporting
orthology of avian MSMB1, -2 and -3, respectively,

MSMB1 between opossum and tammar. No marsupial
homologues other than MSMB1 showed significant
bootstrap values between tammar and opossum, whereas
homologues from the same species tended to cluster
together within the phylogenetic tree, indicative of lineage-specific duplication events.
MSMB-like genes in protostomes

Protostomal MSMB-like genes were identified mostly
from the phylum Mollusca, including bivalves, gastropods and cephalopods, with one sequence from Rotifera.
Additional identified transcript sequences were from a
cDNA library derived from floral bulbs of Lewis’ monkeyflower (Mimulus lewisii), a flowering plant. These are
assumed to have arisen from contamination of the floral
buds by a terrestrial gastropod (a slug or a snail) (H.D.
Bradshaw, pers. comm.).
Phylogenetic analysis of all the protostomal MSMBlike translated sequences did not entirely reflect the species’ taxonomic relationship (Figure 7), suggesting that
not all the sequences are orthologous to each other.
Most notably, the similarity between a sequence from a
cephalopod, Euprymna scolopes, and the “Mimulus

residues due to a truncated reading frame in Exon 4
(Figure 8a). The disulfide bond pairings of cysteine residues has been partially determined [15] and then later
refined [33,34]. A recent crystallographic analysis of
human MSMB [35] showed that the N-terminal domain
consists of six b-strands (b1-6) arranged in a Greek key
motif, while the C-terminal domain consists of four bstrands (b7-10). Three disulfide bonds (6 cysteine residues) give rigidity within the N-terminal domain and
one disulfide bond (2 cysteine residues) gives rigidity
within the C-terminal domain. A fifth, single disulfide
bond between C37 and C73 links the N-terminal and Cterminal domains. In marsupial USM, the cysteine residue homologous to C37 (= C40 in tammar secreted
USM1) is conserved, despite the absence of C73. However, an additional cysteine residue (= C59 in the

lewisii“ (presumed terrestrial gastropod) sequence is
stronger (100% bootstrap) than between any other
sequence pairs, including between congeneric species
(92% for Loligo spp.; 25% for Mytilus spp.). This suggests
that the former sequences represent a gene that is subject to more evolutionary constraints, similarly to
MSMP in vertebrates. Indeed, the sequences from
Euprymna scolopes and “Mimulus lewisii“ appear to
share some features that are highly conserved in vertebrate MSMPs, such as a serine-alanine motif near the
C-terminus (not shown). Thus it is possible that these
two sequences represent distant orthologues of MSMP.
The California sea hare (Aplysia californica; Gastropoda) is the only mollusc currently with a WGS sequencing project. The sea hare MSMB-like sequence is
located on the same genomic scaffold (Scaffold 217 of
genome build Broad 2.0/aplCal1) as a member of the
KLHL (Kelch-like) gene family. KLHL genes also respectively occupy the syntenic groups that include MSMB or
USM/USMH in vertebrates (not shown). Together these
data suggest a divergence between the MSMP and
USM/MSMB lineages in a bilaterian common ancestor.

Figure 8 Predicted tertiary structure of tammar USM1
modelled on human MSMB. (a) The secreted forms of human
MSMB and tammar USM1 (predicted) are aligned with the Nterminal domain (above) and the C-terminal domain (below). The
ten cysteine residues in MSMB (highlighted in pink with positions
indicated) form five disulfide bonds as shown (blue lines). Cysteine
residues homologous to C64, C73 and C87 are absent in USM1 due
to its C-terminal truncation, leaving C40 in USM1 (homologous to
C37 in MSMB) unpaired. We suggest that an additional C-terminal
cysteine residue (C59), also conserved in brushtail possum and
opossum, instead forms a disulfide bond with C40. (b) The secreted
forms of human MSMB (monomer) and tammar USM1 modelled on
the crystal structure of human MSMB [35] (Protein Data Bank
accession code 3IX0) using ESyPred3D [65,66] and displayed as a
cartoon with b strands in rainbow colour using Jmol [67]. The
approximate positions of disulfide bonds are indicated by pink bars.
Predicted disulfide bonds in tammar USM are shown in
homologous positions. It is evident that C40 and C59, which lies
within the short, flexible C-terminal tail, are in close proximity and
likely to form a disulfide bond.

tammar secreted protein) is present within the short,
six-residue C-terminal domain of all marsupial USM
orthologues. Modelling of the tammar USM1 tertiary
structure showed that this cysteine residue would lie
very close to C37 and substitute for the missing C73
(Figure 8b).
The crystal structure of MSMB also revealed a
mechanism for dimerisation, whereby the b1 and b10
strands of one molecule lie end-to-end to form a
straight edge which lies antiparallel and in contact with
the b1 and b10 strands of a second molecule [35]. The
involvement of both b1 (N-terminal domain) and b10
(C-terminal domain) strands suggests that dimerisation
cannot occur in USM, which lacks sequence homologous to b10. This might be integral to a divergent role
for USM compared with MSMB and USMH. However,
the molecular masses of bands 3-5 in the original protein gel of [2] (Figure 1), which each contained USM
sequence, were estimated by the authors as 22, 17 and
14 kDa, respectively. Bands 3 and 5 are thus approximately three- and two-fold, respectively, the predicted
molecular mass of monomeric secreted USM (7 kDa). It
thus remains possible that USM can form multimers
despite its C-terminal truncation. It is noteworthy that
the immunoglobulin-binding property of MSMB may
depend on dissociation of dimers to monomers in
response to reducing conditions or low pH [35,36]
The precise role of USM in the marsupial postovulatory coats is an intriguing question considering the various roles that have been proposed for MSMB. While
MSMB was first identified almost three decades ago as a
component of human seminal plasma with FSH-inhibiting activity [16], there has been a recent resurgence in
interest due to a demonstrated genetic link with prostate
cancer susceptibility [37-40]. Perhaps more relevant to
the present context, MSMB has been shown to inhibit
sperm binding and the acrosome reaction [11,41], suggestive of a possible role in blocking polyspermy in
marsupials.

removal of pouch young (RPY)). Levels were higher during diapause than pre-diapause and the earliest post-diapause stages, although these differences were not
significant. By contrast, the second peak at around d1015 RPY was significantly higher than d4-d6 RPY and
d20-25 RPY. After d15 RPY there was a rapid reduction
in USM1 transcript levels, which coincides with shell
breakdown at around d18-19 RPY [7].
The dynamic temporal expression pattern of USM1

regulated by progesterone - indeed we identified a progesterone receptor binding site within the first intron

To elucidate distinctions in the roles of USM, MSMB

variety of tissues (Figure 9). USM1 expression was
detected solely within endometrium and not in other
tissues, including oviduct. This is consistent with a
highly specific role for USM1 as a component of the
postovulatory coats. MSMB expression was detected in
both pituitary gland and testis, while MSMP expression
was restricted to testis only. Expression of USM2 was
not detected in the tissues tested.

around day 8 (d8). Post-diapause stages are indicated by the days

reactivation. USM1 shows dynamic changes in expression during the
pregnant oestrous cycle. The large reduction in expression to basal
levels after d17 RPY correlates approximately with the period of
shell breakdown (d18-19 RPY) as indicated.

that was conserved in both tammar and opossum (not
shown). In the tammar, progesterone receptors are highest at around d5 RPY, together with oestrogen receptors,
coinciding with the progesterone and oestrogen pulses
that occur at this time [42]. Interestingly this is exactly
when USM1 is at its lowest level before increasing
again. USM1 expression is also low after d20 of pregnancy (Figure 10), at the time when progesterone concentrations in the corpus luteum [43], in the peripheral
circulation [44], and in the utero-ovarian circulation
[45] are highest, but progesterone receptor levels are
very low [42]. Thus, USM1 expression appears to follow
the profile of progesterone receptor levels rather than of
progesterone.
USM as a component of the marsupial postovulatory
coats

The mucoid layer is deposited during passage through
the oviduct whereas shell coat material is secreted from
endometrial glands within the uterus and the uterotubal
junction. The association of MSMB expression with
mucosal epithelia [46] suggests that USM might contribute to the mucin layer, however, the brushtail possum
protein bands isolated by Casey et al. [2] were derived
from a mixed pool of coats from early cleavage through
to late expansion conceptuses. Coats of the former
would be expected to include more mucoid coat while
the latter would include more shell coat. The much
greater volume of shell coat surrounding late-expansion
conceptuses [5] suggests that shell coat material would
predominate in any mixed pool of samples. Indeed,
expression in the endometrium but not the oviduct
revealed by our RT-PCR data is consistent with contribution to the shell coat rather than the mucin layer,
which forms first in the oviduct. Nevertheless, there
may be some overlap in the components of both layers,
with the physical differences between the shell and
mucin coat due to a subset of components that are specific to one or the other. Immunolocalisation studies
may clarify the relative contribution of USM to each
layer.
Many of the known properties of MSMB provide clues
as to possible role(s) of USM. In marsupials, intimate
contact between conceptus and maternal tissues occurs
only late in development, after shell breakdown approximately two-thirds of the way through pregnancy [47,48].
The binding of MSMB to immunoglobulins [12] suggests that USM, if it shares this property, may interact
with the maternal immune system to modulate its
action. The apparently synchronised down-regulation of
tammar USM1 with shell breakdown suggests that the
former may be a necessary step for subsequent successful implantation. Alternatively, USM1 down-regulation
might facilitate shell-breakdown itself.

Page 9 of 13

USM could also have an immune role in protection
against pathogens within the uterus. We have identified
a lysozyme as another component of the postovulatory
coats (unpublished data) that may have a similar role in
protection against bacteria. Such a role for USM would
be consistent with the association of MSMB secretion in
mucosal tissues [49]. In eutherians, degradation of
mucin on the endometrial surface is associated with a
window of receptivity to implantation (reviewed [50]).
Thus it is possible that similar events, including downregulation of USM expression, are associated with placental attachment after shell breakdown in marsupials.
Unlike MSMP, which is relatively well conserved,
MSMB is characterised by a rapid rate of evolution.
Mäkinen et al. [27] noted that among the multiple
copies of MSMB in New World monkeys, the second
intron is more highly conserved than the exons and
there is no bias towards substitutions in the third
nucleotide of codons, which normally preserve amino
acid identity. Thus it is possible that rapid change in the
primary structure of MSMB, excluding the signal peptide and the cysteine residues, is under positive selection. In another study [51], MSMB was identified in a
screen for prostate-expressed genes in primates with a
high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (d N/dS) - a conservative measure of positive
selection. USM is similarly highly divergent among the
three marsupial species examined and, like MSMB, its
divergence might be due to positive rather than neutral
selection. It was previously proposed that MSMB prevents immune attack against allogeneic sperm [12]. A
possible extension to this idea may be that the same
mechanism also serves to reject heterospecific sperm, as
MSMB has been shown to bind sperm and act as an
inhibitor of sperm motility and the acrosome reaction
[10,11,41]. Thus rapid evolution of USM (and MSMB)
could be implicated in speciation events by preventing
hybridisation with closely related species. A recent
report [24] showed that male longfin inshore squid
(Loligo pealeii) detect an MSMB-like protein, Loligo bMSP, in the capsule of eggs laid on the sea floor. Loligo
b-MSP triggers hostile behaviour in conspecific males
towards other male squid, demonstrating a possible role
in species recognition. It is not clear whether this
reflects only a secondary role for Loligo b-MSP in the
egg capsule, but the parallel with USM as a component
of the marsupial conceptus coats is intriguing, although
in marsupials internal fertilisation and development
rules out any role for USM in mate selection by males.
However, it remains possible that USM within the
reproductive tract helps to ensure fertilisation by only
con-specific sperm.
Some eutherians such as rabbit, horse and some carnivores (reviewed [52-54]) also possess various post-

Frankenberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:373
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/373

ovulatory conceptus coats, such as a mucoid coat, neozona and gloiolemma (rabbit) or a capsule (horse). It is
not known whether any components of marsupial and
eutherian mucoid coats are homologous, but our thorough searches in both rabbit and horse genome databases suggest that no orthologues of USM are present.
However, other components could be homologous. It
also cannot be excluded that MSMB or MSMP have
acquired an analogous role in the coats of some eutherians by convergent evolution. It is noteworthy that
MSMB expression has also been detected in human
endometrium [55].
Very few genes have been identified in marsupials that
are absent in eutherian genomes [9]. The identification
of USM is thus noteworthy and could be highly relevant
to understanding the differences in modes of reproduction between these two major mammalian groups. If
USM homologues in non-mammalian vertebrates have a
different role to marsupial USM, this would suggest that
the latter evolved in concert with mammalian viviparity
by supporting in utero development. Conversely, the
absence of USM in eutherians suggests the evolution of
alternate mechanisms supporting in utero development
that caused USM to be redundant, for presumably the
same reason that the shell coat became redundant.

Conclusions
Very few genes have been identified that are specific to
marsupials, one of the three major extant groups of
mammals. We have identified one such gene - USM and attributed to its product a role in the postovulatory
coats of the marsupial conceptus. Its likely importance
in reproduction has potential applications in fertility
control and its high sequence divergence may facilitate
species-specificity when targeting wild populations. We
have also provided the most comprehensive analysis to
date of the complex evolutionary relationships between
different members of the vertebrate USM-MSMBMSMP gene family. Despite more than 30 years since
the initial identification of MSMB, this gene family
remains poorly understood. It has attracted attention in
multiple, diverse fields of research, including immunity,
reproduction, sexual selection and cancer. Our results
provide valuable information that may help to elucidate
not only the evolution of viviparity and placental function in mammals, but also the roles of MSMB and
MSMP.
Methods
Animals and tissue sampling

Tammar samples were collected from animals shot on
Kangaroo Island, South Australia, or from captive animals from a colony maintained by the University of
Melbourne. Tissues from adult tammars were frozen in

Page 10 of 13

liquid nitrogen. All tissues were collected under appropriate permits. Experiments were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics
Committee and all animal handling and husbandry was
in accordance with the National Health and Medical
Research Council of Australia (2004) guidelines.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription

Total RNA was extracted using Tri Reagent (Ambion)
and DNase-treated using DNA-free (Ambion). Reverse
transcription was performed using the Transcriptor
High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) with oligo-dT
priming.
RT-PCR

The complete coding region of tammar USM1 cDNA
was amplified using the primers 5’-GGGGCACGAATGGGTGTTTATTC-3’ and 5’-CCTGAGACACAGAGGAACCAGAGGTACTG-3’ and TaKaRa ExTaq
polymerase according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The PCR product was cloned using the pGEM-T-Easy
kit (Promega) and sequenced using vector-specific primers. The transcription start site was identified by
nested 5’ RACE using the SMARTer RACE cDNA
Amplication Kit (ClonTech) and the reverse primers 5’CCTGAGACACAGAGGAACCAGAGGTACTG-3’ (first
PCR) and 5’-CAGACCAATCAGACGCTCC-3’ (nested
PCR). The purified 5’ RACE product was directly
sequenced using the nested reverse primer.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on cDNA from adult tissues was performed using the following primers. USM1
- 5’-GGGGCACGAATGGGTGTTTATTC and CCTGAGACACAGAGGAACCAGAGGTACTG; USM2 - 5’TGTTGGCAAGAAGGGTCAATGTCC-3’ and TTCC
TGAGAGGTACAGGTGTCAGTTATGC-3’; MSMB1 5’-GATTGCTGCTGGTCTCGTGACTACTG-3’ and
AGGATTTGGTGGGGTCTTCTTTATGC; MSMP - 5’GGTAGTGGTCAATGGAG TTGCTGATGC-3’ and
5’-ACTTCGGAGCCAGGATTCACCC-3’; GAPDH - 5’CCTACTCCCAATGTATCTGTTGTGG-3’ and 5’GGTGGAACTCCTTTTT TGACTGG-3’. Amplification
was performed using the following programme: 95°C for
1 minute; 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 15
seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds; 72°C for two minutes.
Quantitative RT-PCR

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using
the Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Agilent Technologies) and reactions run in triplicate on an Mx3000P
thermal cycler (Stratagene). The quantities of tammar
USM1 transcripts, using the primers 5’-GGGGCACGAATGGGTGTTTATTC-3’ and 5’-CCTGAGACACAGAGGAACCAGAGGTACTG-3’, were compared to the
housekeeping gene b-ACTIN, using the primers 5’-

TTGCTGACAGGATGCAGAAG-3’ and 5’-AAAGCCATG-CCAATCTCATC-3’. Amplification was performed using the following program: 95°C for 15
minutes; 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 30
seconds (which included the plate read) and 72°C for 30
seconds. This was followed by 95°C for 1 minute and a
dissociation curve of 55°C to 95°C, with a reading every
0.5°C over 30 seconds.
Plates were discarded if more than one of the negative
control triplicates was contaminated. Individual samples
of a triplicate were also discarded if they had irregular
melting curves or if the coefficient of variation was
greater than 0.05 for the triplicate. If more than one of
the triplicates was irregular the sample was repeated or
discarded. In addition, a calibrator sample (d4-5 PY stage
gravid endometrium) was also run across all plates to
control for inter-assay variation, and the efficiency of
each primer set was also determined. Analysis of the data
was based on a modification of the ‘efficiency-corrected
comparative quantification method’, which incorporates
both the individual efficiencies of each primer set and the
calibrator sample into the calculations [56]. This gave a
normalised relative quantity value for each sample, which
was then used for the subsequent analysis.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R (version
2.11.1) [57]. A Shapiro-Wilks test for normality was performed to check the assumption that the data had a
normal distribution. Since the distribution of the relative
expression values was skewed, the data were log transformed for analysis. Log transformed data was analysed
by one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons of
means compared using Tukey contrasts. For all analyses
a significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Data are presented as mean ± SEM after converting back to nontransformed normalised relative expression.
Bioinformatics

Sequence searches of Whole Genome Shotgun,
Expressed Sequence Tag and Nucleotide databases were
performed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website [58] using BLAST and
tBLASTn and modifying search parameters for stringency. Nucleotide and translated sequences were analysed using the MacVector sequence analysis software
package. Protein molecular masses were predicted using
MacVector’s Protein Analysis Toolbox. Signal peptide
cleavage sites were identified using the SignalP 3.0 webbased software [59] with default parameters.

was performed by the Australian Genome Research
Facility. The longest assembled contig (89, 803 nucleotides) was submitted to GenBank [accession JN251945].
Phylogenetic analysis

Translated sequences were aligned using ClustalW [60]
within the MacVector sequence analysis software package. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was produced using
Phylip (version 3.69) software [61] and running sequentially the programs protdist, neighbor and drawtree with
default parameters. The tree was displayed and edited
using Adobe Illustrator.
Promoter analysis

Promoter analysis was performed by aligning tammar
USM1 and opossum USM genomic sequences using
Mulan online software http://mulan.dcode.org/[62,63] in
‘TBA’ mode. Conserved candidate transcription factor
binding sites were identified using multiTF [63,64] from
the Mulan website, selecting the TRANSFAC professional V10.2 TFBS database for vertebrates, and selecting
the “optimised for function” option for matrix similarity.

refer for MSMP are defined for ease of comparison by their homology
with Exons 1-4 of human MSMB.
Additional file 3: Phylogenetic tree of microproteins from chordates
using an alignment of protein sequences. The unrooted tree was
constructed by aligning translated sequences homologous to Exons 3-4

significant bootstrap values using various methods (not shown), but
sequences generally cluster into the three groups highlighted.
Accordingly, the position of zebrafish usmh1 in the tree is unlikely to
reflect its true phylogeny, as predicted by its conserved synteny.
