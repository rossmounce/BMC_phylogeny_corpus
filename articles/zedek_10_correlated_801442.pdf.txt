Correlated evolution of LTR retrotransposons and
genome size in the genus eleocharis
František Zedek*, Jakub Šmerda, Petr Šmarda, Petr Bureš
Abstract
Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are considered to be an important source of genome size variation and
genetic and phenotypic plasticity in eukaryotes. Most of our knowledge about TEs comes from large genomic
projects and studies focused on model organisms. However, TE dynamics among related taxa from natural
populations and the role of TEs at the species or supra-species level, where genome size and karyotype evolution
are modulated in concert with polyploidy and chromosomal rearrangements, remain poorly understood. We
focused on the holokinetic genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae), which displays large variation in genome size and the
occurrence of polyploidy and agmatoploidy/symploidy. We analyzed and quantified the long terminal repeat (LTR)
retrotransposons Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy in relation to changes in both genome size and karyotype in Eleocharis.
We also examined how this relationship is reflected in the phylogeny of Eleocharis.
Results: Using flow cytometry, we measured the genome sizes of members of the genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae).
We found positive correlation between the independent phylogenetic contrasts of genome size and chromosome
number in Eleocharis. We analyzed PCR-amplified sequences of various reverse transcriptases of the LTR
retrotransposons Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy (762 sequences in total). Using real-time PCR and dot blot approaches,
we quantified the densities of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy within the genomes of the analyzed species. We detected
an increasing density of Ty1-copia elements in evolutionarily younger Eleocharis species and found a positive
correlation between Ty1-copia densities and C/n-values (an alternative measure of monoploid genome size) in the
genus phylogeny. In addition, our analysis of Ty1-copia sequences identified a novel retrotransposon family named
Helos1, which is responsible for the increasing density of Ty1-copia. The transition:transversion ratio of Helos1
sequences suggests that Helos1 recently transposed in later-diverging Eleocharis species.
Conclusions: Using several different approaches, we were able to distinguish between the roles of LTR
retrotransposons, polyploidy and agmatoploidy/symploidy in shaping Eleocharis genomes and karyotypes. Our
results confirm the occurrence of both polyploidy and agmatoploidy/symploidy in Eleocharis. Additionally, we
introduce a new player in the process of genome evolution in holokinetic plants: LTR retrotransposons.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) have been found in all
eukaryotic genomes investigated [1]. The most numerous group of TEs are long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, namely, the Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy
superfamilies, which have become extremely abundant
in plant genomes over time [2,3]. These LTR retrotransposons copy themselves through a process of
replicative transposition and are thus able to increase
the genome size of the host [4,5]. Retrotransposon

insertion in close proximity to or directly into genes
greatly affects gene expression and function [6-8].
Recombination between retrotransposons can cause
large chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, deletions and duplications [9,10].
Hence, retrotransposons are an important source of
genetic and phenotypic diversity in plants [2,11,12].
Potentially deleterious processes such as retrotransposition must be moderated so as not to have damaging
effects on the host. Therefore, LTR retrotransposons are
epigenetically silenced (i.e., methylated) in plant genomes [13] and have been under strong purifying selection pressure throughout much of evolutionary time

[14-16]. LTR retrotransposons are also actively removed
from the genomes of host species, although this process
is much slower than retrotransposon proliferation [10].
Retrotransposons also respond to various stress stimuli,
such as environmental changes and polyploid formation
[12,17-20]. Usually, only a limited number of LTR retrotransposon families successfully populate the genome.
For instance, only three families are responsible for doubling the genome size of Oryza australiensis within the
last three million years [21], and nearly 10% of the barley genome is occupied by BARE-1 copia-like elements
[22]. In addition, BARE-1 proliferation has been proposed as an evolutionary driving force in natural barley
populations [23,24].
Most studies of TE behavior have been restricted to
large genomic projects, which tend to be focused on
model organisms. Little is known about TE dynamics in
natural populations or among related taxa, and even less
is understood about the role of TEs at the species or
supra-species level, where they can modulate genome
size and karyotype evolution in concert with polyploidy
and chromosomal rearrangements.
An appropriate model group for evaluating the evolutionary dynamics of retrotransposons on the microevolutionary scale should exhibit reasonable monoploid
genome size variation within a particular taxon (section,
subgenus, genus or family). Among angiosperm species
in which both the ploidy level (or chromosome number)
and genome size are known [25], one of the largest contrasts is reported in the genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae).
E. acicularis (2n = 20; 2C = 0.50 pg) and E. palustris
(2n = 16; 2C = 11.05 pg) differ almost 22-fold in
somatic DNA quantity at approximately the same ploidy
level. This contrast is noticeable when compared with
the majority of species in the family Cyperaceae, which
exhibit smaller genomes.
The genus Eleocharis comprises more than 250 annual
or perennial species of marsh and wetland habitats [26].
The species samples included in our study were selected
to represent the genus phylogeny (all four subgenera:
Limnochloa, Zinserlingia, Scirpidium and Eleocharis).
Here we analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of the LTR
retrotransposons Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy in relation to
genome size and chromosome number (or size). In addition, we analyzed independent phylogenetic contrasts
and signals [27] to determine how this relationship is
reflected in the phylogeny of Eleocharis.

Results and Discussion
Phylogeny of analyzed species

We reconstructed the phylogeny of the analyzed
Eleocharis species. The neighbor-joining tree shown in
Figure 1 is based on concatenated alignments of consensus ITS sequences and partial sequences of the

Page 2 of 10

phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc) gene (see Methods and Additional file 1). The topology of the tree
agrees with previously published phylogenies of Eleocharis, with the subgenus Limnochloa at the base of the
tree, followed by the subgenera Zinserlingia and Scirpidium, and with the type subgenus (subgenus Eleocharis)
as the evolutionarily youngest taxon [26,28,29].
Correlated evolution of genome size and chromosome
number in Eleocharis

Genome size was measured using flow cytometry (see
Methods). For most of the analyzed species, genome
size is presented here for the first time (Table 1). The
somatic DNA quantities estimated for E. acicularis
(Table 1) differ significantly from those reported in the
Plant DNA C-values database (0.50 pg [25]). Therefore,
we sampled seven different populations and detected no
significant intraspecific variation (2C = 2.47; standard
deviation = 0.03 pg; N = 7). Eleocharis palustris ssp.
waltersii (2n = 38, 39) is widespread in Great Britain,
whereas E. palustris ssp. palustris (2n = 16) is quite rare
(see [30]). Thus, the value from the Plant DNA C-values
database (2C = 11.05 pg, [25]) refers to the former
rather than the latter, which is in accordance with our
observations (Table 1).
Compared with other Cyperaceae and most other
angiosperm genera, Eleocharis species vary greatly in
genome size (Table 1 [25]). The size of Eleocharis genomes (2C) range from 0.84 pg in E. cellulosa to 18 pg in
E. sterneri (Table 1), which is an almost 22-fold
difference.
We found that genome size (2C) is significantly correlated with chromosome number in the phylogeny of
Eleocharis (2n, Figure 1; R = 0.918, p < 0.01, N = 12),
suggesting that polyploidy plays an important role in
generating genome size variation between Eleocharis
species. This result is in strong contrast with the negative correlation found for the Cyperaceae genus Carex
[31], in which polyploidy is considered to be very rare
[32]. Such a negative correlation was also reported as a
general pattern in the phylogenetic lineage comprising
sister families Juncaceae and Cyperaceae [33]. The only
exception to the observed trend is E. quinqueflora,
which has a small genome (2C = 1.12 pg) and high
chromosome number (2n = 136). It is likely that a similar deviation also exists in species of the subgenus Limnochloa, which are predicted to have small genomes
based on the DNA content estimated for E. cellulosa
(2C = 0.84 pg) and which have chromosome numbers
ranging from 40 to 200 [34,35]. Nevertheless, the high
chromosome numbers observed in the basal clades Zinserlingia and Limnochloa resulted rather from agmatoploidy (chromosomal fission) than polyploidy [35],
similar to Carex (see discussion above). Thus, higher

and real-time PCR are indicated by circles. Genome size, C/n-value and chromosome number (2n) are indicated by squares.

polyploids appear to belong to the evolutionary youngest
subgenus of Eleocharis.
The contrast in genome size between basal and
younger clades of the genus Eleochris becomes more
apparent if chromosome size is taken into account
(Table 1). It has been suggested that symploidy (chromosomal fusion) is responsible for this pattern [32].
However, in addition to symploidy or agmatoploidy,
which are the widespread chromosomal rearrangements
generally thought to be responsible for dysploidy across

the holokinetic family Cyperaceae [33,34], transposable
element proliferation should also be considered (see
Background).
To distinguish between the roles of TEs and chromosomal rearrangements in chromosome size variation, we
examined the relationship between TE density (copy
number per pg of genomic DNA) and average chromosome size (C/n-value; [36]). The C/n-value is a speciesspecific parameter calculated by dividing the amount of
somatic DNA by the number of somatic chromosomes

1) Chromosome numbers were taken from previous studies ([68]: E. palustris, E. waltersii; [49]: E. sterneri because of sample identity; [69]: E. quinqueflora because
of population identity; [35]: E. interstincta). For the remaining samples, chromosome numbers were counted by O. Rotreklová and P. Bureš (unpublished data).

(2C/2n) (Table 1). If a change in C/n is only the result of
a rearrangement, the TE density in the whole genome
should remain unchanged. On the other hand, if TEs
are active players, their density should mirror the
changes in average chromosome size.
In the genus Eleocharis, the observed C /n -values
increase toward evolutionary younger taxa and show a
highly significant phylogenetic signal (Table 1 Figure
1). The small C/n in E. quinqueflora can be explained
by agmatoploidy, whereas the increase in chromosome
size in more recently diverged taxa (Figure 1; Table 1)
could result either from fusion or from the amplification of transposable elements, most likely LTR
retrotransposons.
To assess the contribution of LTR retrotransposons to
this C/n divergence, we analyzed and quantified partial
sequences from both LTR retrotransposon superfamilies.
We used previously described primers to isolate the
reverse transcriptase sequences of Ty1-copia and Ty3gypsy [37-39] from all analyzed species. PCR, cloning
and sequencing yielded 422 and 340 partial sequences of
the reverse transcriptase sequences of Ty1-copia and
Ty3-gypsy, respectively [GenBank: GU976288GU977049; Additional files 2, 3 and 4]. BLAST comparison confirmed their homology to previously described
copia-like or gypsy-like elements. To determine whether
species with larger C/n values carry more retrotransposon copies, we quantified the reverse transcriptase

sequences of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy in each species
using real-time PCR with the same pairs of primers (see
Methods). Because the real-time PCR approach analyzed
only a subset of retrotransposons, as defined by the specific primer pairs, dot blot quantification was also carried out in selected species to corroborate the real-time
PCR results.
Ty1-copia density correlates with C/n-value in the
phylogeny of Eleocharis

As expected, the TE densities obtained from the dot
blot quantification were higher (by one order of magnitude) than the densities estimated by quantitative PCR
(Table 1). The estimates of both methods were positively correlated only for Ty1-copia. However, the differences in Ty3-gypsy density between analyzed species
were very small and possibly below the resolution of
both approaches, especially the dot blot analysis.
The calculated densities of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy
differed by one order of magnitude in favor of Ty1-copia
(Table 1), suggesting that Ty1-copia is more successful
in populating Eleocharis genomes than Ty3-gypsy. In
addition, the density of Ty1-copia increases with evolutionarily younger taxa on the tree, whereas the density of
Ty3-gypsy remains unchanged (dot blot) or slightly
decreases (real-time PCR) (Figure 1). This pattern might
be explained by the higher amplification rate of Ty1copia (compared to Ty3-gypsy) in recently diverged

Zedek et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:265

species. If Ty3-gypsy remains inactive or nearly inactive
while Ty1-copia proliferates, the density of Ty3-gypsy
should be decreasing. A higher activity of Ty3-gypsy in
basal taxa might be another reason for the resulting pattern. A phylogenetic analysis of Ty3-gypsy reverse transcriptase sequences revealed that 18 out of 28 (64%)
sequences from E. quinqueflora formed a well-supported
species-specific clade (Additional file 5). Species-specific
and strongly supported (bootstrap values > 80%) clades
of Ty3-gypsy with at least five sequences were also
detected in E. cellulosa, E. interstincta and E. ovata
(Additional file 5). The presence of species-specific clades
suggests that these species underwent a burst of Ty3gypsy amplification after diverging from their common
ancestor. It is also possible that Ty3-gypsy is more efficiently removed from Eleocharis genomes than Ty1copia. However, the preferential removal of an entire retrotransposon superfamily is unlikely.
The increased Ty1-copia density in Eleocharis is
accompanied by an increase in C/n (Figure 1). The phylogenetic relationship between C/n and Ty1-copia density is significant (Table 2), implying that the larger
C/n-values in recently diverged species resulted from an
amplification of Ty1-copia elements. This correlation is
particularly apparent in species from the subseries Eleocharis, in which the doubling of C/n is mirrored by a
doubling of Ty1-copia densities as indicated by dot blot
analysis (Figure 1; Table 1).

Our observations suggest that the activities of the
Ty1-copia superfamily have a causal relationship with
the C/n-value variation observed in the genus Eleocharis.
The obtained Ty1-copia sequences (Additional file 6)
were analyzed for the presence of putative predominant
families, under the expectation that predominant
families in host genomes will also be overrepresented in
amplicons, resulting in a higher probability of being
cloned and sequenced (see below) [40,41]. The largest
identified Ty1-copia family accounted for 109 out of 422
(26%) sequences of high nucleotide similarity (average
divergence of less than 6%) and shared highly specific
amino acid motifs (Figure 2). Because we did not find
any similarity to previously described Ty1-copia families,
this family was named Helos1 [GenBank: GU976288GU976396]. Helos1 was found in 15 out of 16 analyzed

Zedek et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/265

species (with the exception of E. interstincta), indicating
an ancestral origin for Helos1. As a potential candidate
involved in genome size variation in the genus Eleocharis, the density of Helos1 was also quantified. The
highest densities of Helos1 were observed in species at
the top of the tree (Figure 1), and Helos1 density was
significantly correlated with C/n (Table 2). This pattern
was also observed for Ty1-copia as a whole, suggesting
that the higher densities of Ty1-copia found in evolutionarily younger species were caused, at least in part, by
Helos1 activity (Figure 1; Table 2).
Helos1 was recently transposed in species that diverged
later in evolutionary time

Retrotransposons are epigenetically silenced when they
are young (recently amplified) [16]. Deamination of
methylated cytosines leads to higher rates of transitions
to thymines and elevated transition:transversion (Ts:Tv)
ratios. Hence, recently transposed families/subfamilies
should exhibit higher Ts:Tv ratios [16,42]. Therefore, we
calculated the Ts:Tv ratio for Helos1 in the analyzed
species. We observed an increasing Ts:Tv ratio for
Helos1 in recently diverged species, with the lowest
value found in E. quinqueflora (approx. 1.2) and the
highest value found in E. mamillata (approx. 4.1). We
also detected a positive correlation between independent
phylogenetic contrasts [43-45] of Ts:Tv ratio and Helos1
density (Pearson correlation R = 0.619, p < 0.05). This
finding suggests that the higher density of Helos1 in
more recently diverging species is due to its recent
amplification.

Conclusions
As indicated by the positive correlation between genome
size and chromosome number, our results confirm previous assumptions [35] that polyploidy occurs in the
genus Eleocharis. However, the small genome sizes and
high chromosome counts observed in our study indicate
that agmatoploidy is the most important process determining chromosome number in the subgenera Limnochloa and Zinserlingia.
To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing
LTR retrotransposons in plants with holokinetic chromosomes. Our data strongly suggest that Ty1-copia/
Helos1 played an important role in the evolution of
both genome size and karyotype in the genus Eleocharis,
especially in the type subseries. In addition, the occurrence of both polyploidy events and Ty1-copia/Helos1
amplification is correlated with genome size in the phylogeny of the genus Eleocharis (Table 2). This relationship might help to explain why the evolutionarily
youngest clade, subseries Eleocharis (Figure 1), occurs
almost exclusively in temperate and boreal climatic

zones, whereas the majority of genus diversity is located
in tropical and subtropical zones [46].
As transposable elements, LTR retrotransposons have
the strong potential to generate genic and genomic variation on which natural selection can act to create new
species [12,47]. Although large genome rearrangements
and/or TE insertions into genic regions are usually deleterious rather than beneficial, TE-induced mutations
and alterations need not be adaptive to facilitate speciation. According to the epi-transposon hypothesis
recently proposed by Zeh et al. [48], the non-adaptive
impacts of TE activity can displace the population from
its adaptive peak on the fitness landscape. Subsequently,
a new peak is reached by natural selection, favoring beneficial non-transposon mutations [47,48]. Because species from the subseries Eleocharis are polyploid
[[35,49-51], this study], they carry duplicate or multiple
copies of all genes, and thus, the negative consequences
of TE activity can be balanced [52,53]. A greater number
of TEs within a genome increases the potential to produce fecund lineages with strong abilities to evolve and
adapt to various conditions [47,48]. A relationship
between the latitude and activity of the mariner transposable element has already been observed in populations
of Drosophila simulans [54]. The authors of that study
discussed the possibility that the invasion of new stressful habitats triggered the activity of mariner, which subsequently produced variation for natural selection. The
occurrence of polyploidy has also been shown to be
positively correlated with latitude in angiosperms
[55-58]. It is possible that the widespread distribution
and species richness of the subseries Eleocharis in temperate zones [46] was enhanced by transposable elements, which have larger operational genomic ranges
for creating variation for natural selection and subsequent radiation in polyploids.
The above hypothesis remains to be tested. Full-length
retrotransposons should be isolated and the position of
their insertions within Eleocharis genomes should be
determined. We believe that Eleocharis is a promising
model for studying TE dynamics and genome evolution
in a holokinetic system. The close taxonomical relationship between Cyperaceae and Poaceae could make these
studies easier, as has been shown for the species Luzula
nivea from the sister family Juncaceae [59].

Genome size measurements

Sequence analysis

Somatic DNA quantity (2C genome size) was estimated
using flow cytometry (CyFlow SL; PARTEC GmbH)
with the intercalating fluorochrome propidium iodide. A
two-step procedure was performed (Otto 1 and 2; for
more details, see reference [60]). Tomato (Lycopersicon
esculentum ’Stupické polní tyčkové rané’; 2C = 1.96 pg,
[61]) and pea (Pisum sativum ’Ctirad’; 2C = 9.09, [62])
were used as internal standards.

Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm,
as implemented in the MEGA 4.0 software package [65].
Coding sequences of the reverse transcriptase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc) genes were aligned at
the amino acid level. If the open reading frame was
destroyed due to indels, gaps were inserted to restore it.
ITS sequences were aligned at the nucleotide level. All
sequences were run through BLAST to check their
homologies to retroelements, ITS and the ppc genes.
Consensus sequences for ITS and ppc for each species
were prepared in BioEdit v7.0.9.0 [66]. The original
sequences used for consensus construction are available
on GenBank: ITS [GenBank: GU977050-GU977108] and
ppc [GenBank: GU977109-GU977187]. Neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree of the analyzed species, based on concatenated alignments of ITS and ppc sequences, were
constructed in MEGA 4.0 from nucleotide sequences
using the Tamura 3-parameter model and pairwise deletion option with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogeny of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy reverse transcriptase
sequences was inferred in the same way. MEGA 4.0 was
also used to compute the Ts:Tv ratios of Helos1.

DNA isolation

Plant tissue was ground into a fine powder in liquid
nitrogen, and total genomic DNA was extracted using
the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at
260 nm.
Amplification, cloning and sequencing

PCR was performed to amplify a conserved region of the
reverse transcriptase gene using degenerate primers for
Ty1-copia [37,38] and Ty3-gypsy [39], amplifying
approximately 260-bp and 430-bp fragments, respectively. Amplifications were conducted in a final volume
of 25 μl in the presence 50-200 ng of total genomic
DNA, 1 μM of each primer, 80 μM of each nucleotide
(dNTPs), 2 mM of MgCl2 and 2.5 U of PurpleTaq polymerase (TopBio) in the manufacturer’s 1× PCR buffer.
The following protocol was used to amplify both Ty1copia and Ty3-gypsy: an initial denaturation step at 94°C
for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 44°C
for 1 min and 72°C for 30 s and a final elongation step
at 72°C for 5 min.
The approximately 900-bp-long exon 8 of the ppc
gene was amplified with the primer pair ppc-1465F
(5’-TTTGGTCTCTCTYTTGTGCGTC-3’) and ppc2338R (5’-GRCGGAAATACTCAACAAAGCG-3’). ITS
sequences of approximately 700 bp were amplified with
the primer pair ITS1-UBZ (5’-GAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTG-3’) and ITS4-UBZ (5’-CCGCTTATTGATATGCTTAAACTC-3’). The cycling conditions were
the same for both ITS and ppc, with an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and a
final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. Amplicons were
run on a 1.2% agarose gel to verify their lengths. PCR
products were cloned into pCR®2.1 vectors and transformed into TOP10F’ competent cells (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Selection
of colonies for TEs was conducted as described previously [63,64]. Inserts of the desired length were evaluated using PCR with T7 and M13 primers. Sequencing
was conducted by Macrogen, Inc.

Real-time PCR

Real-time PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene 6000
thermocycler (Corbett Life Sciences). The primers for
Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy were the same as those
described above. New primers were designed for Helos1
and used to amplify the 144-bp fragment of reverse
transcriptase: Helos1-F (5’-ATGTAGAGGCTGGTAAGGA-3’), corresponding to amino acid motif
VEAGK, and Helos1-R (5’-ARCAGTGATCTGCATGAC-3’), corresponding to amino acid motif HADHC.
Purified recombinant plasmids containing these reverse
transcriptase fragments were used as external standards.
Because we used degenerate primers, plasmids carrying
reverse transcriptase sequences with different primer
binding sites were mixed together. The mix was linearized with the BamHI restriction enzyme before being
used for real-time PCR analysis. A 10-fold serial dilution
of the stock solution of plasmid DNA was prepared to
construct standard curves for absolute quantification.
Samples were diluted to a final concentration of
3.5 ng/μl. The 20-μl reaction mixture contained 2 μl of
plasmid DNA or diluted genomic DNA from the samples, 1 μM of each primer, 100 μM dNTPs, 3 mM of
MgCl2, 1× EvaGreen intercalating dye and 1 U of CombiTaq polymerase (TopBio) in 1× PCR buffer. All standards and samples were measured in duplicate. The
cycling conditions for Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy were the
same as those described above. The cycling conditions
used for Helos1 included an initial denaturation step at

Zedek et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/265

94°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s
and 72°C for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72°C for
5 min. Fluorescence measurements were conducted at
the end of each elongation step. A standard curve for
Ty1-copia quantification was generated, covering four
orders of magnitude, from 6.94 × 10 5 to 6.94 × 10 8
copies per reaction tube. The coefficient R2 and reaction
efficiency (E) were estimated to be 1.0 and 82%, respectively. The standard curve for the Helos1 analysis ranged
over six orders of magnitude, from 7.08 × 103 to 7.08 ×
108 copies per reaction tube, with R2 > 0.999 and E =
89%. The standard curve for Ty3-gypsy quantification
covered five orders of magnitude, from 1.35 × 10 4 to
1.35 × 108 copies per reaction tube, with R2 > 0.999 and
E = 89%. Quantification was followed by a melt curve
analysis to verify the reaction specificity. In all cases, a
single peak was observed, indicating a single product.
Dot blot hybridization

For the quantification of Ty1-copia and Helos1, genomic
DNA from each analyzed species was diluted to 100, 50,
25, 12.5 and 6.25 ng, except E. acicularis and E. ovata,
which were diluted to 200, 100, 50, 25 and 12.5 ng. In
the case of Ty3-gypsy quantification, all samples were
diluted to 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 ng. PCR products
prepared from the same plasmid mixes that were used
in real-time PCR quantification were used as standards.
These standards were diluted as follows: Ty1-copia:
3-fold dilution series from 3.27 × 10 10 to 1.35 × 10 8
copies per dot; Ty3-gypsy: 4-fold dilution series from
5.41 × 109 to 2.11 × 107 copies per dot; Helos1: 3-fold
dilution series from 3.33 × 109 to 4.11 × 107 copies per
dot. Except for E. cellulosa, all samples and standards
were measured in duplicate. PCR products were used as
probes, which were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (DIG High
Prime Labeling Kit, Roche). The genomic DNA samples
and PCR products were denatured for 5 minutes at 98°
C and subsequently immobilized on positively charged
nylon membranes. Hybridization was performed using a
DIG hybridization kit (Roche). The hybridization temperature was set to maintain 80-100% homology. Hybridization procedures, washing and detection were carried
out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Integrated densities used for the calculation of copy numbers were obtained using ImageJ software.
Independent phylogenetic contrasts

The presence of a phylogenetic signal and correlations
between studied traits were tested based on the comparison of phylogenetically independent contrasts [43,44].
Independent contrasts were calculated using the Analysis of Traits (AOT module) by David Ackerly, included
in the Phylocom 4.1 package [45]. All tested traits were

Page 8 of 10

considered to be continuous in the analyses. The original branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree were logtransformed prior to all analyses. The significance of
correlation coefficients was obtained using the table of
critical values for the Pearson correlation. Tests of the
phylogenetic signals were based on 999 randomizations.
