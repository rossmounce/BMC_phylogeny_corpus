Abstract
Background: Hox genes are critical for patterning the bilaterian anterior-posterior axis. The
evolution of their clustered genomic arrangement and ancestral function has been debated since
their discovery. As acoels appear to represent the sister group to the remaining Bilateria
(Nephrozoa), investigating Hox gene expression will provide an insight into the ancestral features
of the Hox genes in metazoan evolution.
Results: We describe the expression of anterior, central and posterior class Hox genes and the
ParaHox ortholog Cdx in the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura. Expression of all three Hox genes
begins contemporaneously after gastrulation and then resolves into staggered domains along the
anterior-posterior axis, suggesting that the spatial coordination of Hox gene expression was
present in the bilaterian ancestor. After early surface ectodermal expression, the anterior and
central class genes are expressed in small domains of putative neural precursor cells co-expressing
ClSoxB1, suggesting an evolutionary early function of Hox genes in patterning parts of the nervous
system. In contrast, the expression of the posterior Hox gene is found in all three germ layers in a
much broader posterior region of the embryo.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the ancestral set of Hox genes was involved in the anteriorposterior patterning of the nervous system of the last common bilaterian ancestor and were later
co-opted for patterning in diverse tissues in the bilaterian radiation. The lack of temporal
colinearity of Hox expression in acoels may be due to a loss of genomic clustering in this clade or,
alternatively, temporal colinearity may have arisen in conjunction with the expansion of the Hox
cluster in the Nephrozoa.

Background
Hox genes encode transcription factors that contain a
characteristic helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain - the
homeodomain. Hox genes regulate the expression of other
genes during development and their molecular characterization and expression patterns indicate that these genes
are involved in specifying regional identities along the

anterior posterior (A-P) axis in a diverse range of bilaterian animals [1,2]. Orthologs of the Hox genes are subdivided into anterior, central and posterior classes,
according to their suspected evolutionary ancestry and
their corresponding expression along the A-P axis. Surprisingly, in most, but not all, bilaterians whose genomes
have been sequenced, the Hox genes are organized in a

BMC Biology 2009, 7:65

contiguous cluster in which the order of genes along the
chromosome is reflected in their expression domains
along the A-P axis, a phenomenon called 'spatial colinearity' [3-7]. Additionally, in some cases the developmental
timing of expression of sequential Hox genes also corresponds to their relative positions in the genome - a phenomenon that has been described as 'temporal
colinearity' [8-10]. Both patterns suggest that spatial and
temporal colinearity might have been present in the
organism that possessed the ancestral Hox cluster [11].
Similar attention has been given to the ParaHox genes, a
group of genes that are also clustered in some animal
genomes (for example, Branchiostoma) and are thought to
be paralogs of the Hox genes [12]. Phylogenetic evidence
from bilaterian taxa suggests that each of the three known
ParaHox gene classes (Gsx, Xlox and Cdx) is more closely
related to a corresponding Hox class than to each other.
This suggests that the Hox cluster and ParaHox cluster
arose by the duplication of a single proto-Hox cluster
prior to the separation of the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages [12-14]. Organized clusters of Hox genes, composed
of anterior class (paralog groups Hox1, Hox2), Hox3, central class (Hox4 - 8) and posterior class (Hox9-15) genes,
are present in the annelid Capitella teleta [5], vertebrates
and cephalochordates [15,16], which suggests that Hox
genes were indeed organized in a cluster in the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. However, it is still unclear how this cluster evolved, how many
Hox genes were present in the 'core'-cluster of the ancestor
before its expansion or how these Hox genes are related to
their evolutionary sisters, the ParaHox genes [11,17-22].
Hox and Parahox Evolution - Insight from Cnidarians and
Acoels
The diversity of contexts in which Hox genes are utilized
in bilaterian development illustrates the need to examine
the deployment of these genes in broader evolutionary
lineages. For example, it is still not known whether these
genes were used to provide positional specific patterns of
differentiation to all cells or if they were used to pattern
specific compartments of organ systems such as the nervous system, axial mesoderm or the digestive tract. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine which tissue the
ancestral Hox genes were patterning, since bilaterian Hox
genes are involved in patterning different germ layers in
different lineages [23,24]. In vertebrates, the same Hox
genes are expressed in the neural tube and in paraxial mesoderm and have different anterior boundaries. This indicates that these genes were potentially co-opted
independently for their roles in different tissues somewhere in the vertebrate lineage [25,26].

Cnidarians play an important role in unraveling the evolutionary origins of the Hox and ParaHox clusters, since

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

they form the sister-group to the Bilateria [27] and do not
appear to possess all Hox classes found in protostomes
and deuterostomes. Recent investigations of the Hox gene
complement in cnidarians (for example, corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish) have led to dramatically different
interpretations of Hox/ParaHox gene evolution in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor [17,21,22,28,29]. One reason
for this is the difficulty in establishing clear orthology
assignments of cnidarian Hox and ParaHox genes to those
of the Bilateria. In addition, lineage specific gene duplications have complicated attempts at reconstructing Hox
gene evolution. Furthermore, studies of the expression
patterns in representatives of the two branches of the Cnidaria - the anthozoans and medusozoans - suggest that
their developmental function differs in both lineages
[22,28]. However, the emerging consensus is that the last
common cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor had one or two
anterior and one posterior class gene that are clear
orthologs to the bilaterian Hox genes and two ParaHox
genes, namely a Gsx and a proto-Xlox/Cdx gene [22,28].
Since the cnidarian Hox complement appears to be much
smaller than that of protostomes and deuterostomes, and
also shows intra-taxon variation in the gene expression
along the main body axes, bilaterian Hox cluster expansion remains unclear. Similarly, it is not clear when these
genes first became involved in axial patterning and which
structures first utilized Hox genes for their patterning. In
order to gain more insight into the nature of the early bilaterian Hox genes and their role in body patterning, we
investigated the expression patterns of the Hox gene complement in the acoels - a clade of relatively simple marine
worms that posses an orthogonal nervous system and one
mouth opening but lack an anus to the syncitial gut [3033]. Morphological analyses [34] and molecular phylogenies using different genes suggest that acoels form an early
branch in the Bilateria [35-41]. Phylogenomic studies had
difficulty in placing acoels in the animal tree of life
[27,42]. However, a recent phylogenomic study that uses
1487 genes places Acoela and Nemertodermatida - which
together form a clade called Acoelomorpha [43] - as the
sister group to all remaining Bilateria with high statistical
support [44]. Morphological similarities between the
stem cell system of acoels and platyhelminthes [36] are
thus either ancestral traits of their last common ancestor
or convergence [44].
Congruent with their phylogenetic position, acoels appear
to possess only a subset of the Hox genes found in protostomes and deuterostomes, namely one anterior, one central and one posterior class gene, as well as an ortholog of
the posterior ParaHox gene Cdx [45]. Nemertodermatida,
the sister group of acoels, seem to have a similar subset of
Hox genes belonging to the same three Hox classes [46]. A
homeodomain survey on nemertodermatids revealed

BMC Biology 2009, 7:65

that, in addition to the Cdx gene present in acoels, a fragment of an Xlox ortholog has also been recovered [46].
These data suggest that the acoelomorph Hox complement is close to the predictions that have been made
about the composition of the ancestral Hox cluster before
its expansion in the remaining Bilateria [13,20]. As cnidarians, the sister group to the Bilateria, have no central
class Hox gene, acoels are the pivotal group for reconstructing the origin and expansion of the central class
genes and the possible roles of Hox genes in the evolution
of bilaterian complexity.
We cloned orthologs of the three Hox gene classes and an
ortholog of the ParaHox gene Cdx from the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura and investigated the embryonic and
juvenile expression. We describe their deployment in relation to temporal and spatial collinear patterns and reconstruct their possible function in germ layer specification in
the stem species of the Bilateria by comparing them with
expression data from other bilaterian lineages.

Results
Gene orthology and composition of the acoel Hox genes
Gene orthology assignments of Hox genes are notoriously
difficult to analyse because of a lack of phylogenetic signal
contained in the 60 amino acids that compose the conserved homeodomain. The limited information results in
extremely low support values for the basal branches and a
high sensitivity of the tree topology to the methods and
outgroups used in the analysis [17,21,22,28,47]. The
inclusion of the cnidarian Hox and ParaHox gene
sequences has led to distinctly different hypotheses about
Hox and ParaHox gene evolution. Based on their phylogenetic position as a sister to protostomes and deuterostomes, acoels can provide an insight into the evolution of
the Hox and ParaHox genes. We performed phylogenetic
analyses of the Hox genes, using the homeodomain and
flanking regions, and analysed the Hox gene composition
of specific motifs that regulate the binding specificity of
Hox genes in other metazoans (Figure 1, Additional file 1:
Figure S1 and Table S1). Our primary goal was to establish
the gene orthology to acoel Hox genes and we found that
maximum likelihood (ML) analyses provided the most
stable results. Tree topology was tested by conducting ML
runs with and without cnidarian sequences (Figure 1,
Additional file 1: Figure S1).

The results from both ML analyses of the acoel Hox genes
were consistent with: one C. longifissura Hox gene grouping with the anterior (Hox1/labial); one with central
(Hox4/5); and one with posterior Hox classes (Figure 1,
Additional file 1: Figure S1). We have named these
ClantHox, ClcentHox, and ClpostHox, respectively. The Cdx
ortholog of C. longifissura ClCdx groups with the Cdx
ortholog of the acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis and other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

bilaterian Cdx orthologs (Figure 1, Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Orthology assignments are consistent in ML analyses,
with or without cnidarian sequences. However, the topology of the branching of the individual paralog groups differs dramatically between both analyses. As in previous
analyses, the basal branches receive no, or minor, support
[17,21,22,28,47]. In the analysis that includes several
hydrozoan and anthozoan Hox genes, the earliest branch
is formed by the ParaHox gene Gsx (Figure 1). The exclusion of these genes led to an early branch of the Hox1 class
genes (Additional file 1: Figure S1). These conflicting
results have also been discovered in previous Hox gene
analyses [22,28].
In neither analyses was the previously observed orthology
assignments of the ParaHox genes Gsx, Xlox and Cdx to the
Hox gene classes Hox1, Hox3 and postHox [12,19], respectively, have not been confirmed. If both gene clusters
arose by a duplication of a proto-Hox cluster, the ParaHox
genes would group as sisters to the corresponding Hox
ortholog. However, this is not the case, since ParaHox
genes either form separate branches (Gsx and Xlox in Figure 1) or their grouping with other Hox genes differs
between the analyses. The cnidarian Hox and ParaHox
orthologs form either the sister group to their bilaterian
orthologs or form separate branches (Cdx and postHox, see
Figure 1). In our analysis, the scyphozoan Hox gene which
was previously assigned to the posterior Hox class
(CheHox9-14B) groups with the even-skipped orthologs.
We, therefore, cannot confirm that this is gene is a true
Hox ortholog as has previously been stated [28]. The differences between these and previous analyses demonstrate the difficulties of Hox gene orthology assignment of
cnidarian sequences and leave the question of the early
origin of Hox and ParaHox genes unsolved. They do, however, indicate the significance of the cnidarian lineage for
reconstructing early Hox gene evolution.
As the phylogenetic analyses of the homeodomain alone
did not provide robust insight onto Hox gene orthology,
we also compared motifs in N- and C-terminal flanking
regions including the PBX-binding domain and its distance from the homeodomain in Hox and ParaHox
orthologs (Additional file 1: Table S1). These motifs have
been shown to play an important role in DNA-binding
specificity and protein-protein interaction of Hox genes
[23,48-51]. The PBX-motif is also present in non-Hox family genes (for example, in NK and LIM domain genes) [52]
and is thus plesiomorphic for Hox genes. However, its
presence, diagnostic motifs and distance (length of the
'linker') from the homeodomain has changed during the
evolution of metazoan Hox genes and can thus provide

phylogenetic information for the identification of Hox
family information [52-57].
Overall, the acoel Hox sequences fit the expected pattern
predicted in a previous study that analysed Hox gene structure [55]. The anterior Hox orthologs of Isodiametra pulchra,
Symsagittifera roscoffensis and Convolutriloba longifissura
contain a PBX-motif, which is a similar distance to the
homeodomain (28/37/38 amino acids) compared to
other bilaterian anterior class Hox genes (17-55 amino
acids; Additional file 1: Table S1). The N-motif of the
anterior Hox gene is similar to other bilaterian Hox1
orthologs (both share the Na-signature; see Additional file
1: Table S1). However, the C-motif of the anterior Hox
ortholog in acoels is shorter than in all other Hox genes,
with a stop-codon present close to the homeodomain
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
The central class ortholog of acoels contains a PBX-motif
that is close to the homeodomain (2 amino acids), as it is
in the bilaterian orthologs of Hox6/7 (5-8 amino acids),
but its C-motif has greater similarity to the bilaterian
Hox4/5 orthologs. The acoel central class ortholog also
shares similarities with the N-motif of bilaterian Hox2,
Hox3, central class, Gsx and Xlox genes (all have the Nb
motif). The posterior Hox ortholog of C. longifissura shares
the PBX binding domain of ambulacrarian (hemichordates + echinoderms) and cephalochordate posterior Hox
orthologs. The PBX-motif of posterior class Hox genes is
located close to the N-terminal of the homeodomain and
thus lacks the linker sequence found in the more anterior
class Hox genes [52]. The N-motif of acoel posterior Hox
genes also has posterior Hox specific residues (Nbx-motif;
Additional file 1: Table S1).
The cnidarian putative Hox and ParaHox orthologs also
share specific residues with their bilaterian orthologs. In
the cases of the cnidarian anterior Hox and ParaHox (Gsx)
orthologs, the motif pattern is conserved in relation to
that of the bilaterian orthologs. A PBX-motif is present in
the posterior Hox genes Che9-14A and Che9-14C of Clytia
and in the Nematostella Anthox1a, which is located directly
or close (a single amino acid) to the homeodomain which
is similar to the bilaterian posterior Hox class genes. This
supplies additional evidence that, contrary to previous
suggestions, these genes are indeed posterior Hox genes
[17,47]. The recently reported clear Xlox ortholog in the
hydrozoan Turritopsis dohrnii [21] does not exhibit either
the characteristic PBX binding domain or the similarities
in the N-motif of bilaterian Xlox genes. This could be due
to a secondary loss of these motifs in the hydrozoan lineage. However, an orthology of the gene with Xlox is not
supported in our phylogenetic analysis, where it groups
clearly with the previous described Xlox/Cdx ortholog
(NvHD065) of Nematostella (Figure 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

Although our phylogenetic analysis clearly assigns the
acoel Hox genes to the anterior, central and posterior class,
the internal grouping remains unclear. The lack of resolution and the lack of additional Hox genes in acoels cannot
exclude that possibility that the three Hox genes found in
acoels represent ancestral precursors of the bilaterian Hox
cluster as has been suggested [20]. For this reason, we
name the Hox genes according to their class (Clant-,
Clcent-, ClpostHox) and do not make premature assignments to a specific sub-class of an extended bilaterian Hox
complement. Our analysis suggests that a true anterior
and posterior gene has been present in the bilaterian-cnidarian ancestor and that the central class genes are a novelty of the Bilateria. A Hox3 ortholog has not been found
in cnidarians or acoels, so it appears to have evolved in the
lineage to the common ancestor of protostome-deuterostome.
Expression of Convolutriloba longifissura anterior class
Hox
The expression of the anterior class Hox gene in C. longifissura (ClantHox) starts after gastrulation when the embryo
is composed of approximately 250 cells. It is expressed in
two bilateral regions in the outermost cell layer in the animal hemisphere of the embryo (Figure 2a). Later, these
domains of about 10 cells sink below the outermost cell
layer (Figure 2b). Double in situ hybridizations with other
marker genes allow us to determine the region of
ClantHox expression. The acoel ortholog of Six3/6, ClSix3/
6 (Figure 2c, d) is expressed in the future anterior region
of the juvenile [58] anterior to ClantHox expression.
ClantHox expressing cells (Figure 2e) co-express the proneural gene ClSoxB1 which suggests that these cells are
neural with defined anterior-posterior boundaries (Figure
2i, j). Previous cell lineage experiments show that this
domain is largely generated from the second duet micromeres [59]. In the juvenile, ClantHox is expressed posterior to the statocyst, extending to the end of the body but
not at the posterior tip (Figure 2g, h). The strongest
expression is found in a bilateral area directly posterior to
the statocyst, which is likely to be comprised of descendants of cells expressing ClantHox during their early development (Figure 2c-f).
Expression of Convolutriloba longifissura central class
Hox
The expression of the C. longifissura central Hox class gene
ClcentHox is detected by in situ hybridization shortly after
gastrulation, about the same time as ClantHox (Figure 2a,
3a). Expression begins in the posterior part of the embryo
(Figure 3a) in ectodermal cells surrounding the site of the
closed blastopore (Figure 3b). During later development
the expression domain is internalized and expands anteriorly on both sides, forming bilateral bands (Figure 3c).

bilateral spots of cells in the area lateral to the future position of the mouth (Figure 3d, e). The expression pattern is
very similar to that of ClantHox at this stage (see Figure
2b). However, the anterior border of ClcentHox is more
posterior. Like ClantHox, these bilateral cell patches are
approximately the same size and are located below the
epidermal surface. The identity of these expressing cells
could not be determined because the cell types have not
been differentiated at this stage. However, an endodermal
fate can be excluded since the expression is not in the centre of the embryo, where the digestive syncytium will
develop. The location below the outermost cell layer suggests a mesodermal or neural fate. However, these ClcentHox-expressing cells appear to be in the area of ClSoxB1

expression (Figure 2f, 3) which is thought to be involved
in neural development in other animals [60]. This correlation with the expression patterns of 'neural' genes suggests that ClcentHox is expressed in neural precursor cells
rather than mesodermally derived musculature. The prehatched juvenile shows strong expression in two small
bilaterally paired domains that could be nerve cell bodies
contributing to the orthogonal nervous system (Figure 3fh).

the other two Hox genes that is shortly after gastrulation
(Figure 4a). Initially ClpostHox expression is detected in a
restricted area of about 30 cells in the posterior region of
the embryo, in the outermost cell layer. This domain
extends over the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo (Figure 4b), which gives rise to the posterior part of the juvenile. The anterior border of the ClpostHox expression
domain corresponds to the posterior border of the future
mouth and thus overlaps with the posterior ClcentHox
expressing domains. This expression of ClpostHox later
expands to cells in all three germ layers, including the epidermis. However, during further development, as cell differentiation begins (for example. when the statocyst
becomes visible), expression is down-regulated in the epidermis and endoderm (Figure 4c) and becomes restricted
to a smaller lateral area below the outer cell layer with a
weaker expression extending posteriorly (Figure 4d, e).
The expression of ClpostHox persists in the juvenile and is
found in four individual neural cells in a bilateral arrangement (Figure 4d-f). Expression in the hatchling is rather
diffuse. The expression of ClpostHox is similar to that of
the other two Hox orthologs (ClantHox, ClcentHox), suggesting that the gene is involved in neural patterning in
the posterior region of the juvenile, but it may also have
an early role in posterior patterning of all three germ layers.
Expression of the Convolutriloba longifissura ParaHox
gene Cdx
The expression pattern of ClCdx has been described previously [58,61] but here we focus on a detailed description
of the anterior expression associated with the acoel nervous system and its relationship to other Hox gene expression patterns. ClCdx is expressed in the commissure
posterior to the statocyst (Figure 5) and extends anteriorly
and ventrally, following the paths of nerve tracks. ClCdx is
also expressed in an area surrounding the eyes, which
form direct connections to the brain commissure. The
expression of ClCdx in the juvenile expands laterally to the
posterior end, with a posterior domain in the ventral ectoderm that will form the male gonopore [58].

Discussion
Phylogenetic analyses and evolution of Hox genes
Orthology assignments of Hox genes are notoriously difficult due to the short amino acid sequence of the homeodomain. Previous comparisons of the homeodomains of
ParaHox with that of the Hox genes of representative protostomes and deuterostomes revealed sequence similarities between the anterior, Hox3 and posterior Hox classes
with that of Gsx, Xlox and Cdx ParaHox classes, respectively
[12,19]. These findings led to the hypothesis of a early
duplication of a 'proto-Hox' cluster composed of three or
four proto-Hox genes which gave rise to two separate clusters of three/four Hox and three/four ParaHox genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

[11,12,19]. However, recent analyses that included homeodomain genes from cnidarians suggest a rather different
evolutionary origin of Hox and ParaHox genes in which a
single 'proto-Hox' gene gave rise to a Hox and paraHox
gene, forming an ancestral Hox1 and Gsx ortholog [22,28].
Tandem duplication events then led to the extension of
Hox and ParaHox gene complement we find in the Bilateria [22]. This tandem-duplication hypothesis rejects the
previously suggested duplication event of a 'proto-Hox'
cluster that contained three, or even four, Hox genes
(including a Hox3 ortholog) into a Hox and paraHox cluster and challenges the evolutionary relationship of posterior Hox to Cdx (posterior ParaHox) genes of Xlox to
paralog group 3 Hox genes.
No study has yet found a bona fide Hox3 ortholog in either
cnidarians or acoels and the recent report of an Xlox gene
in a hydrozoan [21] seems to be an ortholog of the homeodomain gene NvHD065 in Nematostella (Figure 1). The
finding of a clear Gsx ortholog in cnidarians [62] and Trichoplax [63], however, shows that either this ParaHox gene
was lost in the acoel lineage or has not yet been found in
the homeodomain gene surveys. Only whole genome
sequencing can determine how many Hox genes are actually present in acoels and nemertodermatids.
To gain further insight into the phylogenetic relationships
of acoel Hox genes we included both N- and C-terminus
flanking regions of the homeodomain in our phylogenetic analysis and investigated the presence of conserved
domains that have been shown to be responsible for the
binding specificity. As in previous phylogenetic analyses
of acoel Hox genes [5,45,64], the anterior class Hox
orthologs of acoels groups as the sister to all remaining
Hox1/labial genes, the central class Hox gene branches
with Hox4/5 and the posterior Hox with the posterior class
genes Hox9-14. At first glance, this suggests that a Hox6/7
gene has been present in the bilaterian ancestor and been
lost in the acoel lineage. However, it does not exclude a
tandem duplication event in which a proto central class
gene gave rise to Hox4/5 and Hox6/7 and after which the
one descendant (Hox6/7) deviated and became more in
sequence with it than its sister (Hox4/5). The Hox complement of more basal branching lineages, such as cnidarians, could potentially deliver additional insight for
reconstructing the Hox gene complement of the bilaterian
ancestor.
The findings of the surveys for Hox and ParaHox genes in
cnidarians suggest the presence of two Hox (anterior and
posterior) and two clustered [65]ParaHox genes (Gsx and
proto-Cdx/Xlox) in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. Together with the gene complement
in acoels, the results favour a two-gene model of the evolution of the Hox genes from a proto-Hox cluster followed

by several duplication events that gave rise to the central
class and expansion within each class to give rise to the
expanded Nephrozoan complement [13].
The Hox orthologs in Convolutriloba longifissura are
expressed in a spatially staggered pattern along the
anterior-posterior body axis
Our results show, that the Hox genes of C. longifissura are
expressed in a spatially staggered pattern along the anterior-posterior axis in later embryos and juveniles. As in
most described bilaterians (except for hexapods and some
polychaetes), orthologs of Hox1/labial are the most anteriorly-expressed genes of the Hox complement. In chordates
this anterior border corresponds to the hindbrain, while
in Drosophila this border corresponds to the tritocerebrum. Hox1/labial expression can be either restricted to a
ring-like domain throughout the entire ectoderm (as in
Saccoglossus [66]) or in a domain with a definite anterior
boundary in neuroectodermal and mesodermal tissue

that expands to the posterior end of the body (as in Branchiostoma [67] and vertebrates). In the protostomes investigated so far, Hox1/labial orthologs are expressed in a
restricted anterior region [5,68-70], starting in two bilateral domains (in the polychaetes Capitella, Nereis, Chaetopterus), which is similar to the pattern we describe for
ClantHox in C. longifissura. In the juvenile, the most anterior parts of the acoel nervous system anterior to the statocyst are free of ClantHox expression, which is similar to
the conditions found in protostomes and deuterostomes
(for example, Haliotis, Platynereis, Capitella, Saccoglossus,
Branchiostoma, Drosophila, Chaetopterous). In both protostomes and deuterostomes, the most anterior part of the
nervous system lacks any Hox gene expression but usually
expresses the gene Six3/6 [71], which is also the case in C.
longifissura (Figure 3).
Posterior to the bilaterally restricted patches of ClantHox
expression, similar domains of the central class Hox gene

(ClcentHox) are expressed in the acoel embryo. Behind
these ClcentHox expressing patches of cells, the expression
domain of the single posterior class Hox ortholog, ClpostHox begins and it extends to the posterior end of the
embryo. This indicates that the spatial colinearity of Hox
gene expression was present in the last common ancestor
of the Bilateria and that the system that regulates the spatial colinearity was maintained, despite the expansion of
the Hox cluster during bilaterian evolution.

Oikopleura) such as rapid development, short generation
time or the emergence of a rigid stereotyped cleavage pattern with precocious specification of cell fates [4] do not
appear to be applicable in acoels. Although acoel development displays a stereotyped cleavage programme, it is not
particularly rapid (occurs in 4-5 days) and the embryos
and adults show a high degree of regulative capacity [79].
Most adult acoels are long lived, capable of regeneration
and can even reproduce asexually.

The boundaries of expression of the three Hox genes in the
un-segmented body of the acoel do not correspond to any
overt morphological boundaries as is found in the segments of arthropods, annelids and in the vertebrae of
mice. However, the anterior border of the ClantHox
expression corresponds to the 'brain' commissure behind
the statocyst and the patch-like expression of ClcentHox
and ClpostHox seem to correspond to specific neural precursors in the orthogonal nervous system (Figure 2, 3, 4).
The mouth opening in acoels is formed late in development [72] and its position corresponds to the border just
anterior to the expression of the posterior Hox ortholog
(Figure 4).

Assuming the presence of an integrated Hox cluster in the
last common ancestor of these animals, it has been suggested that the concerted mechanism that controls the
temporal expression prevents the ancient cluster from its
evolutionary dispersion [10,18,80,81]. Recent evidence
shows, that the temporal and spatial patterning of Hox
expression is controlled by distinct mechanisms [82-84],
which might explain why spatial colinearity is maintained
even during cluster disintegration [77].

Expression of Hox orthologs in Convolutriloba
longifissura begins simultaneously after gastrulation and
shows no temporal colinearity
Our study of the early expression patterns of the Hox gene
complement of C. longifissura shows that all three Hox
genes are expressed almost simultaneously at a time after
gastrulation when the embryo is composed of about 250
cells (Figure 6). Our observations suggest that there is little temporal colinearity in this acoel species, although we
cannot exclude a slightly temporal staggered expression of
one or two cell cycles. We interpret our findings as a lack
of temporal colinearity of expression, unlike that present
in animals which have an intact, organized Hox cluster,
such as vertebrates [8], cephalochordates [67], the polychaete Capitella teleta [5], and some insects [73]. Those
examples in which the Hox cluster has been dispersed,
split or disorganized, such as in Drosophila ([74], C. elegans
[75], Ciona [76], Saccoglossus [66], Oikopleura [77] and
Strongylocentrotus [78], lack temporal colinearity of Hox
expression. Thus, temporal colinearity of Hox expression
seems to be associated with a functionally intact Hox cluster [10].

The lack of dramatic temporal staggering of the Hox gene
expression in acoels can be interpreted in two ways. Given
the consensus view of the presence of a complete Hox cluster with temporal and spatial colinearity at the base of the
Bilateria, the lack of temporal colinearity in acoels would
suggest that an ancestral Hox cluster has dispersed in the
acoel lineage. The reasons for a possible Hox cluster dispersion in acoels are not particularly clear. Explanations
used in other taxa (for example, Drosophila, nematodes,

Since the expression of the Hox genes in acoels are turned
on simultaneously, another explanation for the lack of
temporal colinearity could be that the elements that control a temporal staggered expression has evolved in the
nephrozoan lineage in combination with the expansion
of the cluster. The temporally staggered regulation of Hox
clusters would then be linked by the expansion of the
cluster to a larger number of genes and/or a larger
genomic region in the course of the Hox cluster evolution
of the protostome-deuterostome ancestor [85]. However,
a recent analysis using sequencing of bacterial artificial
chromosome libraries and fluorescent in situ hybridization in an acoel species suggests a dispersed cluster of Hox
genes [86].
The Hox gene expression in acoels is correlated with
neural development in an axial fashion
Our results suggest, that the Hox genes in the acoel C.
longifissura might play a major role in the axial patterning
of the nervous system. The simultaneous onset of the Hox
genes in the ectoderm followed by the internalization of
the expressing cells reflects the internal migration of putative neural precursor cells and is consistent with the
results of fate mapping that showed that the nervous system is formed by descendants of the first, second and
third duet ectodermal micromeres [59]. The co-expression
of ClantHox with the Convolutriloba ortholog of the bilaterian proneural gene SoxB1 [87] is consistent with the previously described patterns in other bilaterians and
suggests that ClantHox is responsible for the patterning
anterior subsets of the nervous system. The overlapping
expression of ClcentHox with ClSoxB1 also suggests a function of ClcentHox in the formation of neural precursor
cells in the mid-body region. In contrast, ClpostHox
expression is found in a broad posterior domain that
includes ectodermal, endodermal and, possibly, mesoderPage 11 of 17

Evolutionary scenario of Hox gene expression evolution in the Bilateria
Figure 6
Evolutionary scenario of Hox gene expression evolution in the Bilateria. The two gene model of Hox gene evolution
is hypothesized and its stepwise extension in the evolution of the Bilateria. The cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor possessed two
clear Hox genes which are expressed ambiguously in the taxon cnidaria. One major branch, the Anthozoa, express the anterior
ortholog in the pharynx and the posterior orthologs along the oral-aboral axis. The other major branch (Medusozoa) the posterior ortholog is expressed in the oral pole, while the anterior ortholog is expressed at both ends of the body. Based on the
data of Hox gene expression of the acoelomorph C. longifissura, the three Hox genes are expressed in a spatial staggered pattern
along the anterior-posterior axis. The expression is switched on simultaneously in the acoel, which excludes temporal colinearity. The spatial staggered expression however, is ancestral for the Bilateria lineage. The protostome Hox expression is represented by the annelid Capitella teleta [5], the deuterostome expression by the hemichordate Saccoglossus [71]. The acoel
expression shares the blastoporal expression of the central and posterior class orthologs in Saccoglossus, the anterior ortholog
is not expressed.

mal cells suggesting that it may be involved in patterning
more than just the nervous system. However, ClpostHox
expression in the juvenile seems to be more restricted to
cells that contribute to the nervous system.
The strong correlation of the acoel Hox gene expression
with the nervous system development supports the idea of
the ancestral role of Hox genes in the anterior-posterior
patterning and regionalization of the central nervous system. This has been hypothesized since the discovery of
Hox gene expression in protostomes (leech [88-91], C. elegans: [92]Drosophila: [93]) and deuterostomes [24,94,95].
Recent studies in the polychaete annelids Capitella [5],
Chaetopterus [69], nereids [70], the molluscs Haliotis
[68]Euprymna [96] and the deuterostomes Saccoglossus

[66], Branchiostoma [67]Ciona [97,98] and Oikopleura [77]
all found that Hox genes are expressed in neural tissue
[99]. As the nervous system plays such important part in
the body plan organization in bilaterians, the ancestral
Hox gene expression in the central nervous system may
have been co-opted for the more complex patterning of
additional tissues along the anterior-posterior axis, such
as paraxial mesoderm, paired appendages and genitalia
[100].
The staggered spatial expression of Hox genes in protostome and deuterostome centralized nervous systems, has
also been used to homologize neuroanatomical structures
(for example, the tritocerebrum of Drosophila with the
hindbrain of chordates) [101,102]. However, our results

Page 12 of 17

BMC Biology 2009, 7:65

from the acoel show that a similar staggered anterior-posterior expression of Hox genes was already present in the
nervous system of the last common bilaterian ancestor
with a much simpler neural organization. This indicates
that metazoan animals appeared to have a general molecular blueprint for axial organization that did not specify
the distinct morphological complexity of the final structures. Therefore, the homologization of more complex
brain structures between protostomes and deuterostomes
on the basis of Hox gene expression is inappropriate. This
interpretation is supported by broad comparative studies
utilizing the diversity of animal taxa, many of which lack
complex brains but possess a similar arrangement of Hox
expression, such as the hemichordate Saccoglossus
[66,103] and the annelid Capitella [5].
Early blastoporal expression suggests an early role of Hox
genes in ectodermal patterning of acoels
Two of the three Hox genes of C. longifissura - the central
and the posterior class Hox gene - are expressed at the site
of gastrulation. The early onset of ClcentHox at the area of
the former blastopore is similar to that found for Hox5 in
the hemichordate Saccoglossus [66] and Branchiostoma [67]
and for Hox4 and Hox5 in the polychaete Nereis [70] and
Chaetopterus [69]. It remains unclear how the specific cell
divisions and expression pattern correlates to the spatially
very restricted position of ClcentHox expression in two
bilateral clusters lateral to the position of the future
mouth during later development. Both ClcentHox and
ClpostHox are first expressed in the posterior ectoderm in
an overlapping manner, before becoming restricted to
neural cell fates when the staggered pattern of the expression is established at later stages of development. This
restriction is first observed in the expression pattern of
ClcentHox followed by the restriction of ClpostHox expression. However, the early expression of these two Hox
genes at the blastopore suggests a different function from
the later neural expression. A similar biphasic temporal
expression is also found in chick development, where the
early function of the Hox genes seems to be in axial specification of the gastrulating cells at the primitive streak
[104]. Perhaps the Hox genes are involved with chromatin
modification, which creates a 'memory' for the future
fates, even when the gene is no longer expressed [104]. A
similar mechanism could be present in the acoels, polychaetes and hemichordates and needs further investigations.
The expression of the ParaHox Cdx ortholog in C.
longifissura
The role of Cdx expression in acoels, in hindgut evolution
and the expression along the anterior-posterior axis in different germ layers have already been discussed [58,61].
The expression of ClCdx in the anterior brain-commissures and connectives that extend to the ventral fold and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

the anterior sensory cells is very similar to the expression
pattern found in the brain of the polychaete Capitella teleta
[105]. Interestingly, Cdx does not seem to be expressed in
the brain of nereid polychaetes [106,107] which indicates
intra-taxon variability. However, other bilaterians investigated also lack Cdx expression in the anterior neural structures but show Cdx expression in neural and endodermal
tissue [108]. Thus, it remains unclear how far the brain
expression in Capitella teleta reflects evolutionary ancestry
with the acoel neural expression.
The findings that, in several bilaterians, ParaHox genes are
expressed associated with the digestive system led to the
hypothesis that Gsx, Xlox and Cdx are responsible for the
AP patterning of a through gut in the hypothetical Urbilaterian [109]. However, this pattern is not consistent
throughout the Bilateria [reviewed in [105]]. The expression of Cdx in the posterior ectoderm in most bilaterian
lineages, which often forms the ectodermal hindgut,
seems to be highly conserved [110]. In the acoels and
nemertodermatids the posterior ectoderm forms the male
gonoduct of the adult, which is also composed of at least
a part of ectoderm. This suggests that the posterior ectodermal expression was co-opted for hindgut formation in
different animal lineages [58,111].
Our survey of Hox and ParaHox genes in the acoel C. longifissura did not reveal any ParaHox genes other than Cdx.
This could indicate a loss of additional paralogs or highly
divergent homeodomain sequences which could not be
recovered with our degenerate polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) approach. The fact that an ancestral epithelial
digestive system, as it is present in nemertodermatids and
cnidarians, has been reduced the to a syncytium in the
acoel lineage [33] could explain a loss of these genes from
the genome. Since the sister group Nemertodermatida
possesses an epithelial gut and an Xlox ortholog, expression studies of these genes in these worms may indicate
that there was an ancestral role of the other ParaHox genes
in bilaterian gut patterning.

Conclusion
Our results of the study of the embryonic expression patterns of the Hox genes in a representative of the likely earliest branch of the Bilateria, the acoelomorphs, show that
the small Hox gene complement is expressed in a staggered pattern along the anterior-posterior body axis (Figure 6). This suggests that the spatial expression was
regulated by an ancestral regulatory system in the last
common ancestor of all bilaterians. However, the simultaneous initiation of Hox gene expression in the acoel
shows a lack of the temporal colinearity that is present in
some bilaterian lineages, perhaps due to a breakdown of
genomic clustering. Our description of the biphasic
expression of the Hox genes in the embryo of the acoel C.

longifissura not only suggests a early function during gastrulation but that the later co-localization with pro-neural
genes indicates the ancestral role of the Hox genes in nervous system patterning which was co-opted for the patterning of other tissue layers and organ systems later in the
bilaterian evolution.

Methods
Material
Gravid adult acoels of the hermaphroditic species Convolutriloba longifissura were collected from the sea water
tables of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory (Oahu, Hawaii)
and reared in glass fingers bowls of filtered seawater in
constant light. Egg clusters composed of 25 - 70 zygotes
were harvested the morning after collection. The culture
of this and related Convolutriloba species has been
described elsewhere [112]. Embryos were staged and
grown in petri-dishes in 0.22 μm Millipore filtered seawater. Convolutriloba longifissura embryos develop directly to
juvenile adults with no larval phase, hatching 4 - 5 days
after ovoposition at 25°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/65

along with published sequences from the acoels Symsagittifera roscoffensis and Isodiametra pulchra. In addition to the
homeodomain, 5' and 3' flanking regions were incorporated in the alignment, including the PBX domain when
present (see Additional file 1: Table S1). The software
MUSCLE [114] was used for the alignment and corrected
manually. The best protein evolution model (RTRev) was
determined with the software Protest. Extended Hox class
genes [115] were used as outgroup. [The nexus files are
available on request at andreas.hejnol@sars.uib.no].
Fixation
Embryos of known developmental stages were fixed in
3.7% formaldehyde in seawater for 3 hours at 4°C.
Embryos were washed in PTw (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20)
with several changes for at least 2 hours to dissolve the red
pigment. After a 5-minute wash with distilled water to
remove salt, embryos and juveniles were dehydrated by
several washes in 100% methanol. Hatchlings and
embryos were stored in separate tubes at -20°C for several
months and rehydrated for whole mount in situ hybridizations.

Gene amplification
We used standard degenerate primers F: 5-GARYTNGARAARGARTT-3 (ELEKEF) and R: 5-CKNCKRTTYTGRAACCA-3 (WFQNRR) for Hox gene amplification from
Convolutriloba longifissura genomic DNA. The search was
extended with primers against specific Hox and ParaHox
genes
(F1cHOX
5-MGNACNMGNACNGCNTA-3,
F2cHOX 5-ACNGCNTAYACNMGNTTY-3, GsxF1 5'-ATG
YCG CGW TCW TTT YTS RTG GA-3', GsxF2 5'-TTT YTS
RTG GAT TCN YT-3', XloxF1 5-GAYGARAAYAARMGNACNMGNAC-3) and sequencing of 325 clones only led
to the three Hox and one ParaHox gene. ClSoxB1 fragments were amplified from cDNA of mixed embryonic
stages using the degenerate primers SoxBF1 5'GTNAARMGNCCNATGAAYGC-3', SoxBF2 5'-GGNCARMGNMGNAARATG-3',
SoxBR1
5'-TTNGKYTTNCKNCKNGG-3', SoxBR2 5'-TAYTTRTARTCNGGRTGYTC-3'.
Gene ends were recovered using RACE PCR (BD Smart
RACE kit, Clontech) in both 5' and 3' direction. For all
fragments pGEM-T-easy (Promega) was used as the cloning vector. The gene sequences are deposited in GeneBank
with the following accession numbers: ClSoxB1:
GQ487528, ClantHox GQ487529, ClcentHox GQ487530,
ClpostHox GQ487531.

Whole mount In situ hybridization
In vitro transcribed (Ambion Megascript T7 or SP6 kit)
DIG-labelled antisense in situ probes were made from
PCR amplified gene fragments (ClCdx 1155 bp, ClcentHox
855 bp, ClantHox 1006 bp, ClpostHox 900 bp, ClSoxB1
1450 bp). The whole mount in situ hybridization protocol
has been previously described and is available online
(http://www.natureprotocols.com/2008/09/18/
in_situ_protocol_for_embryos_a.php). Double in situ
hybridizations were carried out using both DIG-labelled
and fluorescein-labeled riboprobes. DIG-labelled riboprobes were detected colourimetrically with NBT/BCIP
substrates. After the first colour reaction, the alkalinephosphatase of the anti-DIG antibody was heat-inactivated by incubation for 30 minutes at 60°C, followed by
incubation with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2). Fluoresceinlabelled riboprobes were detected using only 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP). However, this precipitate is more diffuse than the product of the reaction using
nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/BCIP as a substrate.
Additional comparisons of the expression patterns of
both genes were made using NBT/BCIP simultaneously
for both probes.

To determine gene orthology of the ClSoxB1 gene, phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian inference was conducted
(mixed model option and 3,000,000 generations sampled
every 1000 generations and 4 chains). A maximum likelihood analysis using the software PhyML [113] with 3000
bootstraps was conducted in order to analyse the gene
orthology of the Hox genes amplified in this analysis,

Embryos were mounted in 70% glycerol and the expression patterns were documented using an Axiocam high
resolution camera on an Axioscope mot2 plus with Axiovision (Zeiss, Inc, VA, USA) software. The precipitate of
the NBT/BCIP reaction reflects infrared light and stacks of
expression patterns for three dimensional reconstructions
were imaged using NBT/BCIP IR reflection microscopy
with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope [116].

Histology
Embryos were embedded in glycol methacrylate (Technovit® 7100) after in situ hybridization according to the manufactures (Heraeus Kulzer, Germany) protocol, and
sectioned with a microtome with glass knives at the Pacific
Biosciences Research Center (University of Hawaii, Honolulu) microscopy facility or with a sliding microtome at
the Institute for Biology (Humboldt-University Berlin).
Sections were stained with haematoxylin or nile blue
using standard histological protocols.
Immunohistochemistry
To label the serotonergic nervous system we used an antibody against tyrosinated-tubulin (Sigma, USA) raised in
mouse in a concentration 1:200 using a standard neural
antibody staining protocol [117] and visualized using a
Cy3 labelled anti-mouse secondary anti-body (Jackson
Laboratories, USA).
