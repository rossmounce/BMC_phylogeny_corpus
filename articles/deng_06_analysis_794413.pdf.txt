Abstract
Background: Little is known about the genome sequences of lepidopteran insects, although this
group of insects has been studied extensively in the fields of endocrinology, development,
immunity, and pathogen-host interactions. In addition, cell lines derived from Spodoptera frugiperda
and other lepidopteran insects are routinely used for baculovirus foreign gene expression. This
study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project in cells from the
lepidopteran insect S. frugiperda, the fall armyworm.
Results: We have constructed an EST database using two cDNA libraries from the S. frugiperdaderived cell line, SF-21. The database consists of 2,367 ESTs which were assembled into 244 contigs
and 951 singlets for a total of 1,195 unique sequences.
Conclusion: S. frugiperda is an agriculturally important pest insect and genomic information will
be instrumental for establishing initial transcriptional profiling and gene function studies, and for
obtaining information about genes manipulated during infections by insect pathogens such as
baculoviruses.

Background
The nucleotide sequences from numerous animal
genomes have been derived and include examples from
both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. In addition,
determination of the genomic sequences of many more
organisms are in progress, yielding a broad picture of the
diversity and common pathways among differing organisms. Genome sequences for the insects Apis mellifera
(honeybee), Anopheles gambiae (mosquito), Drosophila
melanogaster (fruit fly), and Bombyx mori (silkworm) have
been reported [1-5], and additional insect genome

sequences including Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid),
Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens (mosquitoes), several Drosophila species, Nasonia vitripennis (parasitoid wasp), Rhodnius prolixus (insect vector for Trypanosoma cruzi), and
Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) are anticipated. In
addition, a number of EST databases derived from Lepidoptera are available (NCBI dbEST). The Lepidoptera
(moths and butterflies) are the second largest order of the
class Insecta. As such, they are a diverse group of insects
distributed worldwide and throughout different climates
ranging from that in Siberia to the tropics. Thus, it is

important to compare the genomes of a number of species
within the order and to that of other insects.
Lepidoptera are viewed as being among the most beautiful
insects, yet their larvae are major pests to economically
important crops and forests. Among the Lepidoptera, the
silkworm, B. mori, has been studied intensively, since it is
a commercially important insect. In addition, the Lepidoptera are valued as models to examine insect-plant and
insect-pathogen interactions. Their study and comparative
genomic analyses will render valuable tools for insect pest
management and the improvement of widely used lepidopteran pathogens, the baculoviruses, as foreign gene
expression vectors.
In this study, we report the establishment of an expressed
sequence tag (EST) database of 1,195 unique sequences
from the cell line IPLB-SF-21 (SF-21) [6], a cell line
derived from immature ovaries of pupae of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. This and other EST databases
can serve as the starting point from which other S. frugiperda genome clones can be surveyed or to explore gene
expression profiles using microarray assays. More importantly, these and additional ESTs can be the basis for comparative genomic analyses among Lepidoptera or other
genomes within the Insecta.

two ESTs, 10% had three ESTs, and 10% had greater than
10 ESTs (Fig. 1). The average length of the assembled contigs was 854 bases; longer than the average length of singlets (617 bases). The longest contig sequence, contig 138,
was 2,361 bases.
Highly redundant genes
A total of 14 contigs containing 307 ESTs were highly
redundant. This accounted for more than 13% of the total
high quality ESTs. The minimum number of ESTs that
made up these most highly redundant contigs was 13
(Table 1). Distribution of ESTs in each contig can be
accessed via the ESTMD database [9] using the contig
viewer search function. The best matched genes of 6 contigs, totaling 138 ESTs, are from S. frugiperda, verifying the
source of the cDNAs. Nearly half (6) of the highly redundant contigs, totaling 90 ESTs, had significant homology
to various ribosomal proteins, indicating high transcript
abundance of ribosomal protein genes, as expected. Four
contigs totaling 89 ESTs had matches similar to sequences
derived from mitochondrial cytochrome b or cytochrome
oxidase subunits (Table 1). The most redundant contig
was composed of 63 ESTs and had significant homology
to NADH dehydrogenase subunit -1 (ND-1) from S. frugiperda [10].

Results
General sequence survey
To start characterizing SF-21 sequences, two independent
directionally cloned cDNA libraries that had been previously constructed for use in yeast two-hybrid screens using
the plasmid vectors pB42AD and pYES2 (Invitrogen) were
utilized. Initially, about 200 clones were partially
sequenced from each library to assess library quality. Both
libraries yielded acceptable results. The library cloned in
pYES2 was selected for further sequencing. In all, a total of
3,365 cloned inserts were subjected to single-pass
sequencing from their 5' ends, 192 clones in the vector
pB42AD and 3,173 clones in the vector pYES2. The 3,365
sequences were trimmed of vector sequences, poly A/T
tails, low quality, adaptor, and contaminating bacterial
sequences, and screened for a minimum length of 200 bp.
This resulted in a total of 2,367 high quality ESTs with an
average length of 610 bases (156 sequences from pB42AD
and 2,211 sequences from pYES2). No attempt was made
to carry out sequencing to saturation. These ESTs were
assembled using the CAP3 [7] program and verified using
the Phrap [8] program. Both programs assemble overlapping ESTs to commence forming contigs. A total of 1,417
ESTs were assembled into 244 contigs, leaving 951
sequences as singlets. Contigs and singlets together
resulted in 1,195 unique sequences that putatively represent different transcripts. The number of ESTs in the 244
contigs varied from 2 to 63; 56% of contig sequences had

Comparative sequence analysis of S. frugiperda cDNA
data
We used the 1,195 unique ESTs to search non-redundant
protein databases using BLASTX (Table 2). A total of 724
sequences (60.6%) matched known proteins at a cut-off
expectation (E)-value of 10-5 or below. Eleven sequences
(0.9%) had hits with E-values at E < 10-150, 53 sequences
(4.4%) had hits with E-values between 10-150 and 10-100,
283 sequences (23.6%) had hits with E-values between
10-100 and 10-50, 237 sequences (19.8%) had hits with Evalues between 10-50 and 10-20, and 140 sequences (12%)
had hits with E-values between 10-20 and 10-5. The main
matched E-value, between 10-50 and 10-20, included 510
searched unique sequences, which was more than 70% of
the 724 matched sequences. The remainder of the unique
sequences (39.4%) had no meaningful matches (E > 10-5).

Given that Drosophila is the most thoroughly annotated
insect genome [11], we compared S. frugiperda unique
sequences with Drosophila genes using BLASTX. A total of
677 sequences had hits with Drosophila genes at E < 10-5,
that is, 56.7% of the 1,195 unique sequences (Table 2). A
subset of 53 unique sequences (4.4%) matched to Drosophila genes with the cut-off equal to E < 10-100. A total of
274 sequences (22.9%) had matches with Drosophila
genes between 10-100 and 10-50, 224 sequences (18.7%)
had matches between E-values of 10-50 and 10-20, and 116
sequences (9.7%) had matches between E-values of 10-20
and 10-5(Table 2).
We compared our unique sequences from the SF-21 cell
line with ESTs obtained from another S. frugiperda-derived
cell line, Sf9 [12], using BLASTN [13]. A total of 419
sequences (35%) matched the ESTs from Sf9 cells with an
E-value equal to 0 (Table 5). A total of 241 sequences
(20.2%) were similar but not exact matches with ESTs
from Sf9 with E-values > 0 and < 10-5. In addition, almost
half of our ESTs (535 sequences or 44.8%) had no significant match with the Sf9 ESTs. Therefore, 776 of our
sequences (65%) were not previously reported in the Sf9
EST project.
We also compared our sequences with about 4,000 S. frugiperda midgut-specific ESTs available in NCBI dbEST
database using BLASTN. Only 88 sequences (7.36%)
matched with E-value equal to 0 (Table 5). The remaining
sequences matched midgut ESTs to different extents: 19
sequences (1.59%) had E-values between 0 and 10-150, 20
sequences (1.67 %) had E-values of 10-150 and 10-100, 24
sequences (2.01%) had E-values of 10-100 and 10-50, 31
sequences (2.59%) had E-values of 10-50 and 10-20, and 76
sequences (6.36%) had E-values of 10-20 and 10-5. A total
of 937 sequences (78.4%) had no hits with the available
midgut ESTs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/264

In addition, we compared our unique sequences with
those of the silkworm B. mori. We used BLASTN to search
the all B. mori EST sequences available using a BLAST
search site [14], given that the genome sequence is not
fully annotated. A total of 492 from the 1,195 unique
sequences (41.17%) had hits with silkworm sequences at
E < 10-5 (Table 6). Of these, 133 unique ESTs (27% of the
492 sequences) had E-values between 10-100 and 10-50. A
total of 703 sequences (58.8%) had no matches with silkworm sequences.
Conserved S. frugiperda and Drosophila gene sequences
We found 11 highly conserved sequences between S. frugiperda and Drosophila genes based on BLASTX analyses.
All of the 11 sequences were from contigs, with one, contig 134, having an E-value of 10-154. Six sequences had
matches with their homologous Drosophila genes at an Evalue of 0.

We chose contig 134 for phylogenetic analysis given it was
the most conserved sequence between Spodoptera and Drosophila. The sequences from heat shock 70 cognate 4 proteins were aligned with CLUSTALW and only similar
sequences with complete coding sequences (CDS) were
included in the alignment as described in Methods. Alignments of the heat shock protein 70 cognate 4 (contig 134)
with similar ones in the Class Insecta (Fig. 2) showed that
the heat shock protein 70 cognate 4 of S. frugiperda
formed a single clade with Trichoplusia ni, Manduca sexta,
Bombyx mori, and Lonomia oblique, as expected since all
these organisms belong to the order Lepidoptera. This
clade shares a common ancestor with members of other
orders, Diptera, Orthoptera, and Hymenoptera, and with
insects in other clades (e.g., Ceratitis capitata,Chironomus
tentans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Locusta
migratoria, and Cotesia rubecula).
Functional classification of S. frugiperda ESTs
Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used to characterize
gene function annotation and classification [15]. GO
describes gene function using controlled vocabulary and
hierarchy including molecular function, biological processes, and cellular communication. In this report, we used
well annotated GO information of Drosophila melanogaster
to interpret the gene function of our ESTs. Each unique
sequence from S. frugiperda was assigned the same gene
function of the best BLASTX hit (E ≤ 10-5) with Drosophila
sequences based on the annotated GO of Drosophila [15].
This method has been successfully used to annotate bee
brain EST function [16].

The major GO categories for the unique sequences
included those outlining gene molecular function (Additional file 1- Table 7), biological processes (Additional file
2- Table 8), and cellular components (Additional file 3-

Table 9). The highest final child GO term for molecular
function was the hydrogen transporting two-sector
ATPase in the nucleotide binding category. The highest
final GO term for biological processes was protein biosynthesis, under the protein metabolism and biosynthesis
categories, which had 84 unique sequences accounting for
7% of the total unique sequences matched in this category. The largest number for a final GO term in cellular
components was cytosolic large ribosomal subunit under
both the ribosome and cytosol categories. Seventy-eight
unique sequences belonged to this GO term, which
accounted for 6.5% of the total unique sequences annotated for cellular components.
We found 13 unique sequences (1.1%) showing significant similarity with Drosophila signal transduction factors (Table 3). Among these, 6 sequences belonged to the
receptor binding category and the remaining 7 sequences
belonged to receptor and receptor signaling proteins.
Based on GO, we also found one sequence for an apoptosis-related gene, pyes2-ct_017_g10.p1ca, which showed

similarity to the Dros ophila Aac11 gene. Two additional
sequences, pb42ad-1_001_f09.pb42 primer and pyes2ct_010_g11.p1ca, showed significant similarity to Drosophila Gnbp3, a gene involved in defense and immunity.
Pathway analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification
KEGG has been widely used for pathway mapping [17].
Enzyme commission (EC) numbers were used to judge
which sequences pertained to a specific pathway. Twentynine unique sequences including 8 contigs and 21 singlets
accounted for 2.4% of unique sequences and matched
enzymes with an EC number. Within these 29 sequences,
11 unique sequences (1% of total) containing 4 contigs
and 7 singlets were mapped to KEGG biochemical pathways (Table 4). Genes involved in amino acid metabolism
had the highest mapping sequences (5) and 6 mappings.
Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism included 5
sequences and 8 mappings. Other genes included those
involved in nucleotide metabolism (2 sequences), translation (2 sequences), energy metabolism (1 sequence), lipid
metabolism (1 sequence), and metabolism of other

EST database
To efficiently manage and retrieve information in the ESTs
analyzed in this project, we developed an EST model database (ESTMD version 1) [9]. The EST model database is a
highly efficient, web-accessible, user-friendly relational
database. It provides several tools to search raw, cleaned,
and assembled EST sequences, genes and GO, as well as
pathway information. The user may input and submit
keywords or IDs to the server using the web interface. ESTs
and annotated function data are in the relational database

and results are sent back to the user in proper formats in
response to a query. It also provides a clear contig view
and BLAST searches, data submission, and download
pages. In both the GO and KEGG pathway search pages,
ESTMD allows users to search GO and pathways not only
by single gene name, symbol, or ID, but also by using a
file that contains a batch of sequence IDs or FlyBase IDs.
All the sequence function classification based on GO and
KEGG pathway in this study was done using ESTMD. The
file search provision in ESTMD allows users to obtain
information regarding the possible function of many ESTs
or genes at one time instead of searching them individually (Fig. 3).

sequences found in Drosophila. These sequences will be
useful for comparative genomics within and outside the
Lepidoptera, establishing microarrays, and as probes to
either clone or down-regulate genes of interest by RNA
interference in order to perform studies related to Spodoptera, other closely related Lepidoptera, or their pathogens.
This is one of two published annotated EST studies available for S. frugiperda. A prior report included a similar
scale project as that reported here with 5,937 ESTs of
which 1,855 were unique sequences obtained from a
clonally-derived cell line of SF-21, Sf9 [12]. The majority
of unique sequences in the previous study consisted of the
highly abundant ribosomal protein genes and these were
found to have low codon usage bias [12]. Our data provides 776 novel S. frugiperda sequences. A small percentage of our sequences (20.2%) had similarities, whether
these reflect cell line specific differences is not clear at this
time. Together these two studies and other available S. frugiperda ESTs constitute seminal work on the genome
sequence of S. frugiperda. The sequences reported in this

Discussion
Single-pass sequencing was performed on 3,365 cDNA
clones derived from two SF-21 cDNA libraries. Using this
sequence data, we have established an EST database comprised of 1,195 unique sequences from the SF-21 cell line,
derived from the lepidopteran insect S. frugiperda. A total
of 667 unique sequences (57%) had homology to

× 1012 colony forming units per ml. The average insert size
for both libraries was 1.5 kbp.

Many insects within the Lepidoptera, including the fall
armyworm S. frugiperda (family Noctuidae), are pests that
cause significant annual damage to a number of field
crops and tree foliage worldwide. Deciphering their
genomic sequences will aid in developing improved pest
control agents, such as baculoviruses and polydnaviruses/
parasitic wasps. Although these pathogens are being used
or sought as biological control agents, there remains
ample room for improvement of their entomopathogenic
properties.

EST sequencing
Initially, approximately 200 randomly selected clones
from each library were subjected to single-pass sequencing using 5' vector primers. DNA sequencing was performed by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). Although
both libraries yielded acceptable sequence quality, the
pYES2/CT library appeared to yield slightly longer
sequences; consequently, the remainder of the sequencing
was performed using clones from the pYES2/CT library.

Finally, molecular tools have been used in the study of
Lepidoptera or have been derived from Lepidoptera. The
transposable element piggyBac was discovered in the lepidopteran T. ni (cabbage looper) and has been used to create somatic and germline transformations in a number of
organisms including crickets, butterflies, Plasmodium falciparum, and more recently, mice [19-22]. Lepidoptera are
also amenable to down-regulation of genes by RNA interference and transgenic techniques [23]. Thus, knowledge
of the genomics of Lepidoptera will aid in their manipulation or use as molecular tools.

Conclusion
We have established an EST database from the S. frugiperda-derived cell line SF-21, containing 1,195 unique
sequences. Lepidoptera are among the most diverse
insects and as such, sequences and EST databases from
various genomes will be instrumental in assessing speciesspecific genes, phylogeny, and parallels within species of
the same order. In addition, comparative analyses with
available genomes of other insects including A. mellifera,
D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, and T. castaneum
will yield additional insights since these include members
of distinct orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera), providing a more accurate picture of the conserved
pathways and the order-specific gene elements in the
Insecta.

Methods
cDNA library construction
Two independently constructed cDNA libraries were used
for sequencing. For both libraries, mRNA isolated from
log phase SF-21 cells was used for cDNA synthesis, and the
libraries were directionally cloned into plasmid vectors.
One library was custom made by Clontech using the plasmid vector pB42AD. The pB42AD library had a titer of 3.6
× 1013 colony forming units per ml. The second library
was constructed using the SuperScript™ Plasmid System
(Invitrogen) and the plasmid vector pYES2/CT (Invitrogen) that had been modified by addition of a Sal I linker
at the Bam HI site. The pYES2/CT library had a titer of 1.2

Sequence processing
Sequence information was stored in chromatograph trace
files, and Phred [24] was used to perform Base-calling
[24]. Flanking vector and adaptor sequences were
trimmed using Cross-match [25] and Lucy [26], while low
quality bases (quality score < 20) were cleaned at both
sequence ends by using our custom program. RepeatMasker [27] was used to mask repeated sequences, and the
masked sequences were further screened to remove contaminating sequences from bacteria and viruses using
BLASTN [13]. High quality ESTs were assembled using
CAP 3 [7] and verified with Phrap [8], which perform similar tasks. After assembly, Consed [24] was used to assess
contig quality, and assembled ESTs were chosen for further analysis. Contigs flagged for possible miss-assembly
were manually edited in Consed and potential chimeric
ESTs or other suspect ESTs were removed from the pool of
traces.
Sequence annotation
High quality assembled ESTs were annotated using
BLASTX through NCBI and our local BLAST server. We
searched several databases including the NCBI nonredundant and Drosophila protein databases. The BLAST
results were automatically extracted and transferred into a
relational database. The sequences reported in this study
(2,367 ESTs) have been deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers [GenBank: DY792773 to DY795139].
Functional classification
Functional classification of unique sequences from S. frugiperda was based on GO [15]. Unique sequences, including contigs and non-overlapping singlets, were used to
search Drosophila predicted protein databases using
BLASTX. The Drosophila genes corresponding to the best
hits at a threshold of E-value ≤ 10-5 with known GO term
were assigned to the query "Spodoptera sequences". All the
matched GO information was stored in our local MySQL
database.

Pathway assignments
Pathway assignments were carried out according to KEGG
mapping [17]. EC numbers [28] were assigned to unique
sequences that had BLASTX scores with a cut off value of
E = 10-5 or less upon searching SWIR protein databases.
The sequences were mapped to KEGG biochemical pathways according to the EC distribution in the pathway
database.

MySQL 4.0 or higher version. The main tables were on
clones, ESTs, uniSequence, uniHit, FlyBase and FlyBaseDetails. The server-side programs were implemented by
Java technologies. Servlet and JavaServer Pages were used
to communicate between users and databases and to
implement a query. XML and XSLT technologies were
used to describe, generate, and express GO trees.

Authors' contributions
Phylogenetic analysis
Proteins were aligned with CLUSTALW using only CDS in
the alignment. The alignment was then used to generate
phylogenetic trees by the Neighbour-Joining method
using the MEGA version 2.1 program. The bootstrap values for the nodes were determined by analyzing 500 bootstrap replicate data sets to estimate the strength of the
groupings.
Database implementation
A web-based interface of the database was created using
HTML and JavaScript to evaluate the validation of the
input on the client side and to reduce the burden on the
server side. Apache 2.0 was used as the http web server,
while Tomcat 4.1 was the servlet container. Both of these
programs were developed and maintained on UNIX,
Linux, and Windows NT, ensuring that ESTMD was transplantable and platform-independent. ESTMD is currently
hosted on Red Hat 9, and it can be implemented in
