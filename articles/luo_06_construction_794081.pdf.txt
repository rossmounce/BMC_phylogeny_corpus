Abstract
Background: Sharks are members of the taxonomic class Chondrichthyes, the oldest living jawed vertebrates. Genomic
studies of this group, in comparison to representative species in other vertebrate taxa, will allow us to theorize about
the fundamental genetic, developmental, and functional characteristics in the common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates.
Aims: In order to obtain mapping and sequencing data for comparative genomics, we constructed a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) library for the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum.
Results: The BAC library consists of 313,344 clones with an average insert size of 144 kb, covering ~4.5 × 1010 bp and
thus providing an 11-fold coverage of the haploid genome. BAC end sequence analyses revealed, in addition to LINEs and
SINEs commonly found in other animal and plant genomes, two new groups of nurse shark-specific repetitive elements,
NSRE1 and NSRE2 that seem to be major components of the nurse shark genome. Screening the library with single-copy
or multi-copy gene probes showed 6–28 primary positive clones per probe of which 50–90% were true positives,
demonstrating that the BAC library is representative of the different regions of the nurse shark genome. Furthermore,
some BAC clones contained multiple genes, making physical mapping feasible.
Conclusion: We have constructed a deep-coverage, high-quality, large insert, and publicly available BAC library for a
cartilaginous fish. It will be very useful to the scientific community interested in shark genomic structure, comparative
genomics, and functional studies. We found two new groups of repetitive elements specific to the nurse shark genome,
which may contribute to the architecture and evolution of the nurse shark genome.

Background
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries are indispensable for many applications in genomic studies [1-3].
BAC-end sequences have been used to develop sequencetagged connector (STC) frameworks [4,5], to survey
genome structures [6], and for comparative analysis of
gene structure and synteny. Although the whole-genome
shotgun method has been used to produce genome draft
sequences [7], mapped BACs usually have been required
to provide a framework for sequence assembly and templates to complete the sequences of complex genomes
[3,5,8]. BACs and BAC-based maps have also been used in
sequencing of targeted genome regions [9], chromosomal
landing or positional cloning [10], genome function
investigation [11], and evolutionary and comparative
studies [12]. Through BAC sequencing, a full-length avian
androgen receptor gene was identified, which had not
been detected with conventional methods [13].
Sharks belong to the phylogenetic taxon comprising the
oldest jawed vertebrates, the cartilaginous fish, which
diverged from the common ancestor of all other jawed
vertebrates 460–520 million years ago [14]. Genomic and
genetic studies of this group, in comparison to representative species in other vertebrate taxa, will allow us to theorize about the fundamental genetic, developmental, and
functional characteristics in the common ancestor of all
jawed vertebrates. This ancient taxon is of particular interest to us since it is the oldest group of living animals having an adaptive immune system with underlying
molecules and mechanisms similar to those of mammals
[15]. While most sharks and other cartilaginous fish have
large genome sizes (~80% of species studied have larger
genome sizes than human, with some up to 5 times as
large), the nurse shark genome size is relatively small at 4
× 109 bp/haploid genome, only slightly larger than that of
humans (3.4 × 109). Thus, the nurse shark is a candidate
to become a model species in the biomedical and genomics fields. However, most of the shark genes and intergenic
regions are much larger than those of mammals, and thus
large-insert genomic libraries are essential to obtain sufficient genomic information. Previously, BAC libraries of
other cartilaginous fish (clearnose skate and horn
shark)were described by Miyake and Amemiya [1]. In this
paper we report the construction and characterization of a
publicly-available nurse shark BAC library and carry out a
preliminary genome survey.

Results and discussion
BAC library construction
We constructed a nurse shark BAC library, consisting of a
total of 313,344 clones that were deposited in 816 barcode-ordered 384-well microtiter plates. To complete this
large library, approximately 20 ligations were performed.
Since colonies with a diameter of <1.5 mm did not grow

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/106

well in the freezing media, only those colonies with a
diameter of >1.5 mm on selection-agar plates were picked.
Insert size distribution
To evaluate the quality of the BAC library, we first analyzed the insert sizes of 408 sampling BAC clones with Not
I (cutting GCGGCCGC sequence), which liberates the
inserts from the BAC vector (Figure 1). The 408 sampling
BAC clones were selected by picking one clone from A01
position of every other 384-well plate of the library and
arranged in the same order as the library plates. Of the 408
BAC clones, 6 did not yield detectable DNA. Of the
remaining 402 clones, only one had no insert, indicating
a negligible empty-vector rate (1/402). While most clones
produced only one Not I insert band, ~16% of the clones
produced more than one insert band due to the presence
of internal Not I sites. Eight such clones produced a single
or very few small insert bands with high DNA densities
disproportional to the DNA density of the vector band,
suggesting co-migration of multiple repetitive bands. In
fact, when these clones were digested with Swa I (cutting
ATTTAAAT sequence) that also liberates the inserts, they
generated single large-insert bands (e.g. 194 kb). These
clones may be of interest because they might contain large
repetitive and structurally distinctive regions with
extremely high GC content. The average insert size of the
402 clones is 144 kb, and thus the entire BAC library covers ~4.5 × 1010 bp (313,344 × 144,000 bp). The nurse
shark genome content was reported to be ~8 pg DNA per
cell [16], ~4 × 109 bp per haploid genome. Thus, our BAC
library covers ~11 haploid genome equivalents. Approximately 94% of clones contain inserts greater than 110 kb.
Although multiple ligations were used, no significant difference was observed between different library segments
corresponding to the different ligations except that one
segment of 14,976 clones, corresponding to the library
plates 628 to 666 (number 314 to 333 in Figure 1), has
very large inserts. This segment resulted from two parallel
ligations and has an average insert size of 209 kb.
BAC end sequence analysis
We sequenced the first 96 of the above 408 sampling
clones at both ends. One hundred seventy-seven BAC end
sequences (BES) were obtained with an average highquality base-pair (bp) number of 548 bp ([Genexcluding
[GenBank:CZ549372~CZ579549],
Bank:CZ549507] which is the vector sequence), covering
a total of ~100,000 bp. The average GC content of the BES
is 41%, ranging from 26–66%. Sequences from other
parts of the nurse shark genome (~300 kb) have an average of 42–45% GC content (YO, MFF; personal observation), which is consistent with this finding. It is worth
noting that the GC content was calculated in windows of
the BES lengths, and some smaller regions may contain
higher GC content. Indeed, we previously detected simple

repeats with a high GC content (70–80%) in a region of
the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I
gene [17]. Analysis of the BES also revealed 4 sequences
containing significantly long microsatellite repeats (simple sequence repeats, SSRs): [GenBank:CZ549546] (AG)9,
[GenBank:CZ549467] (AG)19, [GenBank:CZ549532]
(AT)9 and [GenBank:CZ549547] (AC)14. However, no significant tri-nucleotide or longer motifs of SSRs were found
in our BES. The CpG dinucleotide frequency was underrepresented (the observed value is only 1/4 of the
expected one) while the AA and TT dinucleotide frequencies were over-represented in this set of BES.
BlastN and BlastX searches of these BES against the 'nr'
database in GenBank and tBlastX and tBlastN searches
against an in-house collection of conserved domains of
non-LTR retroelements were carried out with an E-value of
below 1e-10. The Blast analysis results are classified in
Table 1 (BlastN results can be found in our web site [18]).
Nine BES share a significant similarity with various shark
genomic sequences; one [GenBank:CZ549423] is similar
to 18S ribosomal RNA; two showed hits to zebrafish and
Tetraodon genomic sequences that remain 'unclassified';

and one hundred and two showed 'No Hits'. Twenty-nine
and five BES contained LINEs and SINEs respectively,
indicating that these repetitive elements are major components of the nurse shark genome. Most of them hit regions
of published nurse shark genomic sequences, especially to
an intron of the LMP7-like pseudogene, and non-coding
sequences from genes in other shark species (RAG [19]
and HOX [20]), and the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of
a non-classical class I gene, UAA-NC1 [17] that contains a
retrotransposon. Most of the LINEs contain partial open
reading frames (ORFs) encoding reverse transcriptases
related to the CR1 family, first found in chicken [21]. The
high representation of CR1-like SINEs/LINEs is thus likely
to be a common feature of shark genomes. In the sandbar
shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), a total of 7 CR1-like SINE/
LINE elements were found in the 9.4 kb intergenic region
of RAG1 and RAG2 [22].
NSRE1 and NSRE2 analysis
The remaining 29 BES and one other [GenBank:CZ549472] that also contains a LINE element are of
interest. They hit only nurse shark BAC draft sequences
when searched against 'htgs' (high-throughput genomic

sequence) database in GenBank. When BlastN searches
were performed using the whole BES set as the database
and the BES as queries, they were categorized into two
groups designated as NSRE1 (nurse shark repetitive element 1) and NSRE2 (24 and 6 for NSRE1 and NSRE2
respectively, Figures 2 and 3). Searching against the 'nr'
database in GenBank revealed that 21 of 24 NSRE1
sequences hit the nurse shark UAA-NC1 cDNA ([GenBank:AF357922]) in the 5'UTR (nt positions 2–103), and
22 of 24 NSRE1 sequences hit the nurse shark LMP7 pseudogene, exon 4 ([GenBank:AF357928]) at nt positions
3274–3350 (see Additional file 1). The 698 bp-sequence
of GC_Ba0153A01.f [Genbank:CZ549510] hit the subject
regions in two query regions (nt positions 1–60 and 538–
635), showing two NSRE1 in one BES. Two BAC clones
(GC__Ba0143A01 and GC__Ba0109A01) hit the subject
regions at both ends. When the subject sequence [GenBank: AF357922] nt positions 2–103 region was used as a
query to search the 'htgs' database in GenBank, it only hit
all the 9 nurse shark BAC draft sequences then present in
the GenBank in multiple regions with an average of 7.2
hits/BAC, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 11
(data of Oct. 2, 2005). Searching the NSRE2 sequence
[GenBank:CZ549534] against the 'htgs' database in GenBank found an average of 3.4 hits/BAC on 8 of the 9 nurse
shark BAC draft sequences ranging from a minimum of 1
to a maximum of 5. These results indicate that NSRE1 and
NSRE2 are repetitive elements, and NSRE1 is more frequent in the nurse shark genome than NSRE2. BlastX
searches of both NSRE1 and NSRE2 did not detect any
protein matches. To further sample the representation
and organization of NSRE1 and NSRE2 elements in the
nurse shark genome including coding and non-coding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/106

regions, we sequenced the BAC clone GC_Ba0754I06. The
draft sequence of this clone revealed seventeen NSRE1
and six NSRE2 in a ~170 kb region dispersed among
SINEs/LINEs repetitive elements. All identified repetitive
elements are found most abundantly in regions outside of
the gene (e.g. fatty acid synthase FASN, Figure 4).
To confirm that these repetitive sequences were present in
a high copy number in the nurse shark genome and to test
for their existence in related animals, we did Southern
blotting and library screening using 'overgo' probes of
NSRE1 and NSRE2. Both the NSRE1 and NSRE2 probes
hybridized to the nurse shark genomic DNA, but not to
DNA from other elasmobranchs (sand tiger shark, little
skate, and lemon shark), Xenopus laevis, rat, human and
zebra finch (Figure 5 for NSRE1, data not shown for
NSRE2). Both the NSRE1 and NSRE2 hybridization signals are smear, indicating that these elements are highly
repetitive and dispersed in the nurse shark genome, consistent with our sequence analysis results above. From a
library screening of 36,864 clones, many colonies hybridized with different intensities (data not shown), perhaps
correlating with the copy numbers within the BAC clones.
Our data suggest that the expansion of NSRE1 and NSRE2
repetitive elements occurred after the divergence of nurse
shark from other shark lineages. However, we examined
only distantly related shark species in this study. Closely
related shark species, belonging to the same family (Orectolobiformes) as nurse shark (e.g. wobbegong shark, bamboo shark), must be examined for the presence/absence of
these repetitive elements. It is possible that different,
unique repetitive elements will be found in other shark
species.

NSRE2 analysis
NSRE2 analysis. NSRE2 full-length BES sequences were aligned using ClustalW. Shaded color correlates the degree of nucleotide conservation (e.g. black; identical in all sequence). Consensus sequences are shown under the alignment in lower cases.

BAC library screening with gene-specific probes
To further assess the quality and demonstrate the utility of
the BAC library, we screened the entire BAC library with
gene-specific probes. These probes are listed in Table 2.
With all single-copy gene probes except TAP1 (transporter
associated with antigen processing) and Ring3, we
obtained 6–28 positive clones (Table 2, library screening).
A similar number of positive clones was observed when
we used the Factor B probe, present in two tandem copies
in the nurse shark genome. We further confirmed the positive clones by colony hybridization (Table 2, colony
hybridization). Most of the gene probes except CD83 [23]
resulted in 8–19 true positives, consistent with the 11x
coverage calculated from the average insert size and total
number of clones. The low percentage (50%) of true positives from MHC class I and CD83 may be due to weakly
hybridizing false-positives, which appeared only after

long film exposures. In some cases, we observed multiple
weaker signals in the vicinity of the stronger signals in the
same double-spotting pattern, presumably due to carryover during filter production. In fact, the low percentage
(62%) of true positives for the TAP1 probe was most probably due to such carryover of positive clones into neighboring wells. Once we carefully selected putative positive
clones for TCR probes (i.e. only selected the strongest signals among the neighboring signals), the percentage of
true positives increased (see Table 2, 89–91% TCRs).
TAP1 and Ring3 are members of large gene families containing conserved domains, which might cross-hybridize
to other family members and thus result in higher number
of positive clones than expected. With the LMP7 probe, 19
positive clones seem to be low for a multi-copy gene,
however we have found at least 2 pseudogenes containing
only small fragments of the gene [17]. These results

ously, we constructed a genomic cosmid library with an
average insert size of ~40 kb. However, most cosmid
clones contain at most a single gene (data not shown). In
this study, we used several linked genes (TAP1, MHC class
I, class II, Factor B, LMP7, LMP2 [17,24], and Ring3
(unpublished data)) to quickly glean the number of genes

gle BAC clone, making physical mapping possible. Thus
far, our analysis has convincingly shown that the BAC
library is a useful tool (and perhaps the only way) to
obtain genetic information for this species.

We report in this paper a large insert, deep-coverage and
high-quality BAC library for a cartilaginous fish that will
be very useful to the scientific community for gene isolation, genetic analysis, and comparative genomics. We
found two new groups of repetitive elements, designated
as NSRE1 and NSRE2, which are specific to the nurse
shark genome. These repetitive elements may contribute
to the architecture and evolution of the nurse shark
genome. The BAC library, HDR filters and individual
clones are available to the public from the Arizona
Genomics Institute's BAC/EST Resource Center [18].

Methods
Isolation of high molecular weight DNA
Blood was obtained from the nurse shark individual "Yellow" using a Heparinized 18G 1 1/2" needle from the caudal vein. To obtain ~30 micrograms of DNA per 80-μl
agarose plug, approximately 4 × 106 erythrocytes were
embedded in 1% InCert agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME)
prepared in 1/2x PBS and molded in ~200 Plug Molds
(BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA). Twenty plugs were then submerged in 50 ml of cell lysis solution (1% lithium dodecyl
sulfate, 10 mM Tris, pH8.0, 100 mM EDTA, pH8.0) and
incubated overnight at 37°C with occasional swirling. The
cell lysis solution was replaced with 50 ml 20% NDS
(0.2% N-lauroylsarcosine, 2 mM Tris, pH9.0, 0.14M
EDTA, pH9.0), and DNA plugs were shaken gently at
room temperature for two hours, and then kept at 4°C
[25].
BAC vector preparation
We used a modified version of the BAC vector
pBeloBAC11, pIndigoBAC536Swa. A first modified version
of
pBeloBAC11
[GenBank:U51113],
pIndigoBAC536, was a gift from Dr. H. Shizuya of
Caltech. pIndigoBAC536 has the internal Eco R1 site of
pBeloBAC11 destroyed so that the unique Eco R1 site in
the multiple cloning sites can be used for cloning, and
also contains a random point mutation in the lacZ gene
that provides colonies with a darker blue-color on X-gal/
IPTG selection. We further inserted two Swa I sites (ATTTAAAT) near and internal to the two Not I sites of
pIndigoBAC536 (this new version is named
pIndigoBAC536Swa) to facilitate insert-size estimation of
clones from GC-rich organisms (Luo et al, unpublished
data). We then cloned this single-copy BAC vector
pIndigoBAC536Swa into the high-copy vector pGEM-4Z
(this composed high-copy plasmid is named pAGIBAC1)
to facilitate the preparation of the single-copy BAC vector
as we did for pIndigoBAC536 (the composed high-copy
pIndigoBAC536-pGEM-4Z
plasmid
is
named
pCUGIBAC1) [26]. pCUGIBAC1 is available through
Clemson University Genomics Institute [27] and
pAGIBAC1 is available through Arizona Genomics Institute [18]. The linearized and dephosphorylated single-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/106

copy BAC vector pIndigoBAC536Swa can be prepared
from the high-copy pAGIBAC1 according to our previously published method [28].
Generation and size selection of large DNA fragments for
BAC cloning
Large genomic DNA fragments for BAC cloning were prepared according to our previously published method [28].
The DNA-agarose plugs were washed thoroughly with TE
buffer (10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH8.0) and stored in
70% ethanol at -20°C. A desired number of DNA plugs
were transferred to TE buffer the day before use and kept
at 4°C overnight. The DNA plugs were test-digested with
various amount of Hin dIII (1–50U) for 20 minutes at
37°C to optimize partial digestion conditions and the
fragmented DNAs were separated on 1% agarose gels by
Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) (CHEF Mapper,
BIO-RAD) at 1–50 sec linear ramp, 6 volts/cm, 14°C in
0.5X TBE buffer for 18–20 hours. Bulk digestions were
then carried out using the conditions that produced the
most DNA fragments in the range of 100–400 kb. Fragmented DNAs were separated on a 1% CHEF gel in the
same conditions described above. DNA fractions ranging
from 150–250 kb and 250–350 kb were excised from the
gel and subjected to a second size selection on a 1% CHEF
gel at 4 sec constant time, 6 volts/cm, 14°C in 0.5X TBE
buffer for 18–20 hours. DNA fragments were electroeluted with dialysis tubing as described by Strong et al [29]
or with an Electro-eluter Model 422 (BIO-RAD) following
the manufacture's instructions. DNA concentrations were
determined on subsequent agarose gels.
Ligation and transformation
One hundred to two hundred nanograms of size-selected
DNA fragments were ligated with 20 nanograms of
dephosphorylated BAC vector in a 100 μl of volume at
16°C overnight. The ligation reactions were terminated at
65°C for 15 min, and the ligation products were desalted
in 0.1 M glucose : 1% agarose cones for 1.5 hours on ice
as described by Atrazhev and Elliott [30] and electroporated into the E. coli strain DH10B T1 phage resistant (FmcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80dlacZ ΔM15 ΔlacX74
deoR recA1 endA1 araD139 Δ(ara, leu) 7697 galU galK λrpsL nupG) electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Transformants were grown on LB plates supplemented with 12.5 mg/L chloramphenicol, 80 mg/L X-gal
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside or 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside)
and 100 mg/L IPTG (Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside or
Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) at 37°C overnight.
Library arraying and high density replica (HDR) filters
A total of 313,344 individual recombinant clones (white
color on X-gal plates) were picked robotically (Genetix,

Page 8 of 11

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:106

New Milton, UK) and arrayed into 816 barcode-ordered
384-well microtiter plates containing freezing media (10
g/L Bacto tryptone, 5 g/L Bacto yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl,
36 mM K2HPO4, 13.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.7 mM Na-citrate,
6.8 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4.4% glycerol, autoclaved and added
filter-sterilized MgSO4 solution to the final concentration
of 0.4 mM) supplemented with 12.5 mg/L of chloramphenicol. After an overnight incubation at 37°C, empty
wells were back-filled manually and duplicate copies were
replicated. The master library and the two copies were
then stored in -80°C freezers at different locations. The
whole BAC library was gridded onto 17 22.5 cm × 22.5 cm
Hybond N+ membrane filters (Amersham, Piscataway,
NJ) in high density, double spots, and 4 × 4 patterns with
Genetix Q-bots (Genetix). Each 22.5 cm × 22.5 cm filter
supports 18,432 clones in duplicate in 6 fields. The filters
were placed on LB media supplemented with 12.5 mg/L
of chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37°C.
The filters were then soaked in 0.5N NaOH/1.5M NaCl
for 7 min, in 1.5M NaCl/0.5M Tris-HCl (pH8) for 7 min,
air dried for 1–2 hours, soaked in 0.4N NaOH for 20 min,
in 20x SSPE for 7 min, and air-dried overnight.
DNA analysis of BAC clones
BAC DNAs were extracted with Tomtec Quadra 96 model
320 (Tomtec, Hamden, CT) in a 96-well format at AGI.
The 408 sampling BAC clones were selected by picking
one clone from A01 position of every other 384-well plate
of the library and arranged in the same order of the library
plates. Inserts were liberated by digesting with Not I or Swa
I and their sizes were determined on CHEF gels.
BAC end sequencing
BAC DNAs were sequenced at both ends using BigDye Terminator v.3 (Applied Biosystems, ABI, Foster City, CA)
according to manufacturer's instruction. The T7 primer (5'
TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG 3') was used as the "forward" primer and the BES_HR primer (5' CAC TCA TTA
GGC ACC CCA 3') was used as the "reverse" primer. Cycle
sequencing was performed using PTC-200 thermal cyclers
(MJ Research, Waltham, MA) in a 384-well format with
the following regime: 150 cycles of 10 sec at 95°C, 5 sec
at 55°C, and 2.5 min at 60°C. After the cycle-sequencing
step, the DNA was purified by magnetic beads, CleanSeq
(Agencourt, Beverly, MA) according to manufacturer's
instruction. Samples were eluted into 20 μl of water and
separated on ABI 3730xl DNA capillary sequencers with
default conditions. Sequence data was collected by data
collection software (Applied Biosystems), extracted using
sequence analysis software (Applied Biosystems) and
transferred to a UNIX workstation. Sequences were basecalled using the program Phred [31,32]; vector and lowquality (Phred value <16) sequences were removed by
CROSS_MATCH [31,32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/106

Bioinformatics analyses of sequences
Similarity searches against public GenBank and in-house
database were carried out using the Blast algorithm. Composition analyses as well as searches for inverted repeats
were done using the programs "composition" and "palindrome" respectively, both of which are included in the
package EMBOSS [33]. SSR were searched using the software "Sputnik" [34].
NSRE alignment
The nucleotide sequences of both NSRE1 and NSRE2 were
aligned using ClustalW. NSRE1 motifs were extracted
from BES and full-length BES sequences were aligned for
NSRE2.
Southern blotting for NSREs
Five μg genomic DNAs were digested with 80 units of
restriction enzyme Hin dIII for 6 hours at 37°C. DNA fragments were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane.
Overlapping oligonucleotide (overgo) hybridization was
performed according to Ross et al [35] with modifications. The NSRE1 and NSRE2 overgo probes were
designed from the sequence [GenBank:AF357922] nt
positions 2–103 region and sequence [GenBank:AF357928] nt position 4406–4529 region respectively. Primers used for NSRE1 are: 5' TCT CGG CCC GAA
ACG TCA GCT TTC 3' and 5' AGC ATC AGA GGA GCA
CGA AAG CTG 3'. Primers used for NSRE2 are: 5' TGC
TGT TCC TGC AAC CTT CGG GTA 3' and 5' AAT GCC
ACA ACG ACG CTA CCC GAA 3'. Each set of primers
overlaps by 8 base pairs. Probes were labeled with both
32P-dCTP and 32P-dATP using Klenow enzyme. Hybridization was carried out overnight in a solution containing
1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 1 mM EDTA pH8.0,
7% SDS, 0.5M sodium phosphate at 60°C. Membranes
were washed in 4x SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature,
followed by 1.5x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C. Membranes
were exposed to screens and scanned using the phosphor
imager.
BAC sequencing and assembly
The BAC clone GC_Ba0754I06 that covered 170 kb was
bidirectionally shotgun sequenced with an average redundancy of about 6, which was sufficient for assembly and
analysis of the entire sequence using previously established procedures [36]. The draft sequence was searched
using Blast2 for NSRE1 and NSRE2, BlastN and BlastX
against the 'nr' database in GenBank for SINEs/LINEs and
CR1-like SINEs/LINEs, respectively. During the BlastX
search, at least 27 exons were identified with significant
similarity to other species' fatty acid synthase (FASN)
exons (E-values of 3e-56 and 3e-46 to chicken [GenBank:AAB46389] and rat [GenBank:AAA41145], respectively).

BAC library screening
The seventeen HDR filters of the BAC library were prehybridized in high-stringency hybridization solution
(50% Formamide, 6x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5x Denhardt's solution) [37] supplemented with 100μg/ml of denatured
salmon sperm DNA for ~4 hours at 42°C. Probes (50 ng)
were radiolabeled using the random-priming method
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or by incorporating α32P-dCTP
in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [38]. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42°C and membranes
were washed at room temperature in pre-warmed (42°C)
2x SSC/1% SDS for 20 minutes, followed by washing in
0.2x SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 minutes at 65°C. Membranes
were exposed to X-ray film for various lengths of time to
obtain positive signals and the desired background. General protocols for high-density BAC library filter screening
and address determination of positive signals are publicly
available from our website [18]. Putative positive clones
were re-spotted on nylon membranes for colony hybridization to confirm true positives. For hybridization with
NSRE overgo probes, we performed in the same hybridization solution as described above for Southern Blotting.
Filters were washed in 4x SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by 0.75x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C, exposed
to screens, and scanned using the phosphor imager.
