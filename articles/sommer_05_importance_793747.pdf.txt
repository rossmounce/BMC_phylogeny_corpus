Abstract
Genetic studies have typically inferred the effects of human impact by documenting patterns of
genetic differentiation and levels of genetic diversity among potentially isolated populations using
selective neutral markers such as mitochondrial control region sequences, microsatellites or single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes within
and between populations can only be reflected by coding genes. In vertebrates, growing evidence
suggests that genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC). MHC variants influence many important biological traits, including immune
recognition, susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, individual odours, mating
preferences, kin recognition, cooperation and pregnancy outcome. These diverse functions and
characteristics place genes of the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and
significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. MHC variability is believed to be maintained by
pathogen-driven selection, mediated either through heterozygote advantage or frequencydependent selection. Up to now, most of our knowledge has derived from studies in humans or
from model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions. Empirical support for selective
mechanisms in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment is rare. In this review,
I first introduce general information about the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as
current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC
polymorphism. The evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding
markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of MHC
variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on the evidence derived from free-ranging animal
populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic
variability with respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.

Introduction
Many natural populations are threatened not only by a
dramatic reduction in total area of available habitat but
also by increasing habitat fragmentation and degradation
leading to declining population sizes and barriers to gene
flow if exchange of individuals between subpopulations is

restricted [1-3]. Small populations often suffer from
reduction of genetic diversity due to genetic drift and
inbreeding effects [4-6]. Negative effects such as increased
rates of allelic loss, fixation of deleterious alleles and
decreased average individual heterozygosity relative to the
overall population were observed by both, theoretical and

empirical studies [7,8]. The loss of genetic variation can
lead to short-term reduction of fitness components such
as survival, reproductive output, growth rates and to
impaired ability to adapt to long-term changes in the environment [7,9-13]. An increasing number of studies indicates that host genetic diversity plays an important role in
buffering populations against pathogens and widespread
epidemics [6,14-20]. Study of the genetic effects of population fragmentation is therefore of central importance for
conservation biology [21].
Genetic studies of wild animals often employ neutral
markers such as mitochondrial d-loop DNA (mtDNA),
microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNPs) to estimate the amount of variation present in
individuals and populations [22-24]. While these markers
are very informative for phylogenetic reconstructions and
population history (bottleneck effects), for molecular
clocks, to examine dispersal patterns of individuals (gene
flow) and to classify individuals by relatedness and paternity analyses [25-28], the variation at neutral loci cannot
provide direct information on selective processes involving the interaction of individuals with their environment
or on the capacity for future adaptive changes [29,30].
However, these are issues of particular relevance in evolutionary ecology and conservation [31,32]. In addition,
recent research in a variety of taxa and situations has
revealed that evolution often occurs on contemporary
timescales, often within decades (summarised in [32]). In
some cases, the time span between the separation of populations might even be too short to leave a signal at neutral loci so that differences between populations are only
detectable at genes under selection [33], such as those of
the highly variable major histocompatibility complex
(MHC). Contrary to neutral markers, MHC variability
reflects evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes
within and between populations and is very suitable to
investigate a wide range of open questions in evolutionary
ecology and conservation. The comparison with neutral
markers allows the construction of null hypotheses concerning the diversity at selectively relevant genes and conclusions on the relevance of MHC polymorphism. One
might argue that many recent studies report that individual heterozygosity at apparently neutral microsatellite
markers is correlated with key components of individual
fitness such as survival [34], fecundity [35], disease resistance [14,36] and lifetime reproductive success [37]. However, null results are likely to be underrepresented in the
literature because of publication bias in favour of significant correlations [38]. A recent review and meta-analysis
of both published and unpublished studies of the association between neutral marker heterozygosity and traits or
components of individual fitness reported that associations were common, yet typically weak [39]. A correlation
between individual heterozygosity at neutral genetic

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

markers and components of individual fitness can arise in
different ways, with the effects of inbreeding depression
due to a genome-wide reduction in genetic variability
(including fitness-relevant loci) and linkage disequilibrium to loci under selection being the most likely explanations [[6,38,40], see also [41]].
In this review, I first introduce general information about
the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The
evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of
MHC variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on
the evidence derived from free-ranging animal populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic variability with
respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC):
structure, function and selection mechanisms
Structure and function
The MHC consists of a group of closely linked genes that
constitute the most important genetic component of the
mammalian immune system [42]. The MHC encodes cellsurface glycoproteins that bind antigens derived from
pathogens or parasites and present them to T-lymphocytes which trigger the appropriate immune response.
Two major groups of MHC genes can be distinguished.
MHC class I genes play an essential role in the immune
defence against intracellular pathogens by binding peptides mainly derived from viral proteins and cancer
infected cells. They are expressed on the surface of all
nucleated somatic cells. In contrast, MHC class II genes
are predominantly involved in monitoring the extracellular environment by presenting peptides mainly derived
from parasites to the T-cells (e.g. bacteria, nematodes, cestodes) [43,44]. They are primarily expressed on antigenpresenting cells of the immune system, such as B cells and
macrophages. Within class II genes, most research in
mammals focuses on the second exon of DRB genes
because these loci code for parts of the functionally
important antigen binding sites (ABS) [45]. Alternatively,
the β-chain in general is used if loci assignment is not possible due to missing information (e.g. in teleost, [46,47]).
The class II region genes are closely linked in humans and
all other mammals examined, and variants at these genes
are generally in strong linkage equilibrium [48]. Thus, the
pattern observed for DRB loci should be a good indicator
of the genetic variation in other class II genes and even
some other less closely linked genes in the MHC [49-51].

Genes within the MHC involved in antigen presentation
constitute the most polymorphic loci known in vertebrates [52,53]. The variability of the MHC-molecules is
correlated with the diversity of the T-lymphocyte receptors
which in turn determine the disease and parasite resistance of an organism and thus may influence the longterm survival probability of populations [54-57]. The
antigen binding sites show high levels of variation not
only in the number of alleles but also in the extent of
sequence variation between alleles [58]. Under neutrality
theory, the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitution
(ds) is predicted to be larger (ds > dn) than the rate of nonsynonymous substitution (dn) because non-synonymous
substitutions change the amino acid composition and are
thereby likely to be deleterious [59,60]. However, several
studies demonstrate that the ABS display more non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions (dn > ds)
([61,62], reviewed by [19]). This cannot be explained by
a higher mutation rate in this specific region [58,61,62].
The emerging general view is that the determinant role in
shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity in MHC genes is
balancing selection [19,59,60,63]. Balancing selection
results not only in the maintenance of large numbers of
alleles in populations, but also in greatly enhanced persistence of allelic diversity over extremely long time periods relative to neutral genetic variation [64], an
observation termed 'trans-species evolution of polymorphism'
[42]. The subsequent alteration in ABS allows binding of
a diverse array of antigens [61,62,65].
Selection mechanisms
Two main types of balancing selection ('heterozygote
advantage hypothesis' and 'frequency-dependence selection')
have been suggested as important in retaining high levels
of genetic diversity at the MHC in humans and vertebrates
(reviewed by [19,64,66-68]).

In evaluating the evolutionary potential of 'heterozygote
advantage' mechanism [69] a clear distinction between
'dominance' (heterozygote advantage in a broad sense) and
'overdominance' (heterozygote superiority) is necessary.
The term 'dominance' refers to heterozygotes that are as
resistant as the most resistant homozygote (if the allele A
is associated with resistance, then the genotype AB is as
resistant as AA (AB = AA)). In this case the heterozygote
advantage could be due to masking of susceptible alleles.
Whereas there is some support for this selection mechanism among experimental infection studies using mainly
congenic mice it is clearly not sufficient to maintain high
MHC variability [68,70,71]. 'Overdominance' seems to be
the more efficient 'heterozygote advantage' mechanism promoting MHC diversity. In this case, heterozygotes are
expected to have higher fitness than either parental
homozygotes especially if confronted with multiple species or strains of pathogens or parasites (the genotype AB

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

has a higher fitness than AA (AB>AA) and BB (AB>BB)
[72]). The assumption is based on the theoretical background that heterozygous individuals should be able to
detect and present a wider range of pathogen-driven antigens due to a larger number of different MHC molecules,
hence increasing the relative fitness of MHC heterozygotes
compared with homozygotes [60,73]. Thereby, two different 'overdominance' models have been suggested: a) 'symmetric overdominance' or 'symmetric balancing selection' [74],
whereby all heterozygotes derive a similar selective advantage to homozygotes (= all heterozygous are selectively
equivalent), and b) 'divergent allele advantage' [75]. In the
later it is speculated that heterozygotes carrying more
divergent allelic sequences have a selective advantage relative to individuals carrying relatively similar alleles by
presenting a broader spectrum of antigens to the immune
system. To the best of my knowledge, the 'divergent allele
advantage'-hypothesis has never been applied in infectious
disease studies but to explain the persistence of highly
divergent MHC alleles over millions of years [75,76].
Richman and colleagues [77] used a theoretical model to
confirm Wakeland's contention that MHC alleles are
more divergent than expected under a model of balanced
genetic polymorphism assuming selective equivalence of
different alleles (but see [78-80]). Application of this
model to MHC class IIb gene sequence data of deer mice
(Peromyscus maniculatus) provided more support for the
'divergent allele advantage' model than for the 'symmetric
overdominance' model for the maintenance of MHC polymorphism [77]. Thereby it is important to note that the
analysis are based on assumptions of the coalescent models in which no gene conversion is allowed and therefore
conclusions should be taken with care if such a mutational process is suspected [19].
The second mechanism, 'frequency-dependent selection',
occurs when an allele or genotype is favoured at one frequency, but disadvantaged at another frequency
[73,81,82]. Host-parasite dynamics are considered as an
coevolutionary arms race. Pathogens adapt to infect the
most common host genotype, leaving rare genotypes least
infected [83]. If alleles are favoured when they are rare,
but selected against when they are common, a balanced
polymorphism results. Thus, the 'frequency-dependent selection' hypothesis is also described as 'rare-allele advantage
hypothesis', 'Red Queen hypothesis' or 'moving-target hypothesis' [84-87]. The hypothesis assumes the following details.
Rare (e.g. new) MHC alleles that are more resistant to parasites cause an advantage to the host, spread through the
population and become common. This increases selection
on parasites to evade recognition by these common alleles. As the parasite antigenicity changes, the relative fitness
of the common host genotypes decreases and provides a
selective advantage to other rare alleles. The time-lag
nature of these antagonistic coevolutionary responses

could lead to a cycling of fitness values of different alleles/
genotypes in both hosts and pathogens, and result in the
maintenance of high genetic diversity. As a consequence
of these processes, pathogen-driven selection varies over
time and may differ among habitats/environments within
the range of a species, such that one host MHC-allele is
favoured at a certain time in one environment and
selected against in another. This should lead to varying
spatiotemporal selection directions in space and time
('diversifying selection in space and time') [88,89,91]. So far,
only one study investigated variation in MHC frequencies
over time in a natural population to test the assumptions
of the frequency-dependent model. Westerdahl and colleagues [92] compared the temporal changes in allele frequencies of 23 class I alleles and 23 neutral microsatellites
of Great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) in nine
consecutive cohorts. The MHC alleles showed on average
slightly higher variation in temporal fluctuations compared to the microsatellite alleles. The frequency of two
specific class I alleles varied more between cohorts than
expected from random, whereas none of the neutral markers showed fluctuations exceeding the expectation from
stochastic variation. The authors suggested that the variation in MHC allele frequencies between cohorts is not a
result of demographic events, but rather an effect of selection favouring different MHC alleles in different years.
However, Westerdahl and colleagues [92] did not include
investigations of parasites or pathogens dynamics for
explaining this pattern.
In addition, reproductive mechanisms such as disassortative mating and maternal-foetal interactions have been
suggested as alternative or complementary mechanisms
maintaining MHC diversity (summarised by [68,87,9397]). MHC dissimilar mating preferences might act to
increase offspring heterozygosity ('good-genes as heterozygosity hypothesis' [98]), to provide offspring with a moving
target of MHC alleles as protection against pathogens
which rapidly adopt to the parental genotypes ('rare-allele
advantage hypothesis', 'Red Queen hypothesis', 'moving-target
hypotheses' [73,81,82,87], to avoid inbreeding or genetic
incompatibility ('genetic compatibility hypothesis' [99]) or to
achieve an optimal MHC diversity in offspring with
respect to parasite resistance ('allele counting hypothesis'
[46,47] but see [91]).
The actual cue used in MHC-based mate choice is thought
to be based on odour which allows to distinguish MHCidentity (summarised by [87,100-102]). Peptides/MHC
complexes that are not retained at the cell surface but
instead are released into the extracellular space might
appear in the urine and other body secretions and be used
for interindividual communication [103,104]. In mammals, the vomeronasal organ is essential in odour-based
social recognition by detecting pheromones and other

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

chemosignals that carry information about gender, sexual
and social status, dominance hierarchies, and individualities, but it has been difficult to define the molecular
nature of these chemosignals. Recent studies provided evidence that MHC class I peptides serve as chemosensory
signals in the vomeronasal organ by which individual
MHC genotype diversity can be used as a relatedness
marker and may influence social behaviour [105].
These diverse functions and characteristics place genes of
the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates [19,52,93].

Evolutionary forces acting on the genetic
diversity in coding and non-coding markers
The maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations in neutral parts of the genome under the non-selective evolutionary forces such as genetic drift and
inbreeding depend not only on the number of individuals
constituting a population, but also on the particular life
history, the dispersal patterns (gene flow) and the breeding system of the species under study [106,107]. In contrast, the ability of natural populations to maintain
genetic variation in functional genes depends on the selection pressures involved. Balancing selection is thought to
counteract the effects of genetic drift and to retard the rate
of fixation of alleles [58].
Evidence for selection maintaining high MHC diversity
despite restricted variability in non-coding markers
There is increasing evidence for high MHC diversity due to
balancing selection in species with otherwise restricted
diversity in non-coding markers. For example, the San
Nicolas Island fox (Urocyon littoralis dickeyi) is the most
monomorphic sexually reproducing animal population
yet reported with respect to variation in neutral genetic
markers. No variation has been discovered in supposedly
neutral hypervariable microsatellite loci and multilocus
fingerprints, for which the probability of genetic identity
is commonly <1 in several millions. Such low levels of
variation imply lower resistance to pathogens, reduced fitness, and problems in distinguishing kin from non-kin.
However, high MHC diversity is probably still maintained
in this population by balancing selection. It is assumed
that periodic selection has rescued genetic variation at the
MHC and, potentially other fitness-related genes ([108]
but see also [90]). Another example was found in Hawaiian honeycreepers (Vestiaria coccinea) [109]. Natural selection has maintained variation within the MHC while
mitochondrial d-loop sequences and cytochrome b
sequences were invariant and allozymes revealed low variability probably due to a genetic bottleneck. Moreover, in
fragmented Malagasy gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) populations, the number of DRB-alleles and the gene

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:16

diversity were still high [110] but microsatellite and mitochondrial marker showed very low levels of polymorphism [111]. In the same study area, also the introduced
black rat (Rattus rattus) revealed a similar pattern of
genetic polymorphism: high levels of variability in the
functional important MHC DRB marker [Sommer,
unpublished data] in contrast to low mitochondrial dloop variability (five haplotypes) [112].
These studies indicate that until a threshold level, genetic
variation at the MHC might persist due to balancing selection despite low levels of variability shown by neutral
markers. The results support the importance of balancing
selection as a mechanism to maintain variation in natural
populations and expose the difficulty of using neutral
markers as surrogates for variation in fitness-related loci
[108].
Processes leading to low variability in both coding and noncoding markers
The maintenance of polymorphism within populations is
dependent on the product of selection intensity, mutation
rate and effective population size [58,113,114]. Under
certain circumstances strength of selection acting on MHC
loci can be insufficient to maintain variation in small or
fragmented populations for a long period of time. The
effects of balancing selection and genetic drift on the
genetic diversity of coding MHC class II (DQA) variability,
neutral mitochondrial control region and microsatellite
marker were recently investigated in 14 island and two
mainland populations of the Australian bush rat, Rattus
fuscipes [115,116]. Both neutral marker sets revealed high
levels of genetic variability over-all but clear signs of
genetic drift such as little to no diversity in the small
island populations and extreme differentiation between
the populations. In the MHC, higher levels of heterozygosity were observed on two of the islands than would be
expected under neutrality, but genetic drift played a dominant role in the majority of island populations leading to
a decrease in the number of MHC alleles.

Similarly, historical events such as bottlenecks and
founder effects but also constraints of the mating system
can be reflected in low numbers of MHC alleles (for example in an Asian lion population (Panthera leo persica)
[117]; cheetahs (Aconyx jubatus) [118]; Malagasy giant
jumping rats (Hypgeomys antimena) [119-121]; Malagasy
western forest mouse (Macrotarsomys bastardi) [120]; common hamsters in the Netherlands (Cricetus cricetus) [122];
Scandinavian beavers (Castor fiber) [123]; Swedish moose
(Alces alces) [124,125]; musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) [126];
Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) [127]; island population of
desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) [128];
Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) [129]; South African bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus) [130]; Przewalski's

horses (Equus przewalskii) [55]; Northern elephant seals
(Mirounga angustirostris) [131], fin whales (Balaenoptera
physlaus] [132], sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) [132],
and black robins (Petroica traversi) [133]). Under these circumstances, the power of genetic drift has been stronger
than the power of selection. As predicted by theoretical
models [135], the reduced MHC polymorphism is usually
correlated with low genome-wide genetic variation [89].
For example, cheetahs (Aconyx jubatus) show low MHC
diversity, which correlates with a genome-wide loss of
diversity presumably due to a genetic bottleneck about
10,000 years ago [118]. Also Northern elephant seals
(Mirounga angustirostris) which were hunted near to
extinction in the 19th century lost most of the variability in
allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, mini- and microsatellite
loci and MHC class II loci [131,135].

Empirical support for the functional importance
of MHC variability in pathogen and parasite
resistance
Evidence for the functional importance of MHC variability
and selective mechanisms derived from studies in humans
or under experimental, laboratory conditions
While predictions of an association between MHC diversity and disease resistance are straightforward extensions
of MHC theory, up to now, most of the empirical evidence
has been derived from studies in humans or under experimental/laboratory conditions [19,67,136].

'MHC heterozygote advantage' [69] was indicated in
humans by a slower progression to AIDS after HIV infection [137] and in a more effective clearance of hepatitis B
viral infections [138]. In laboratory experiments, MHCheterozygous mice showed reduced pathogenicity during
bacterial and viral infection (streptococcus-induced
lesions [139], Salmonella, Lysteria [70], Salmonella enterica,
Theiler's virus [140]), an increased T-cell mediated immunity during lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) infection [69] and they had a faster clearance rate of parasitic
worms (Heligmosomoides polygyrus [141], Schistosoma mansoni [142]), than the average homozygote. Tumor incidence was lower and regression faster in heterozygous,
rous sarcoma virus (RSV) infected chicken (Gallus domestica [143]). MHC class IIB heterozygotes had an increased
survival rate in captive-raised fish, e.g. in Chinook salmon
(Oncorhynchus tsawytscha) infected with a haematopoietic
necrosis virus (HNV) [144] and in fluke-infected (Gyrodactilus turnbulli) Gila topminnows (Poeciliopis o.
occidentalis) [54].
The 'frequency-dependent selection hypothesis' [81,82] is
engaged by both mathematical models [73,145] and
some empirical studies that show correlations between
certain alleles and disease resistance in humans (e.g.
malaria [146], Epstein-Barr-virus [147], hepatitis B [148],

leprosy, tuberculosis [67], Heliobacter-infected gastric cancer [149]). In humans, a correlation was observed
between some MHC class II haplotypes and the clinical
severity of cestode infections (Echinococcus multilocularis)
[150]. Certain MHC alleles also played a role in resistance/susceptibility to a fungal disease (Cryptococcus neoformans [151]), infections with gastrointestinal nematodes
in lab mice (Trichinella spiralis [152,153], Nematospiroides
dubius [154], Trichuris muris [155]) and in straightbred
Scottish Blackface sheep (Ostertagia circumcincta
[156,157]). Associations between resistance and MHC
genotype was found in chicken suffering from infection
with Marek's disease (a tumour disease caused by a herpes
virus [158]). Experimental evidence for MHC-allele-specific resistance to Aeromonas salmonicida bacteria [57,159]
and to the infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) was
found in captive-raised Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
[160]).
Evidence for the functional importance of MHC variability
and selective mechanisms derived from studies in freeranging animal populations in their natural environment
Whereas studies carried out under experimental or laboratory conditions can be better standardised to account for
different parameters (e.g. in inbred congenic mice), they
do not provide sufficient information to evaluate the
ubiquity of pathogen-driven selective mechanisms acting
in free-ranging animal populations in their natural habitat. Doing MHC research in wild vertebrates allows to test
whether the results of studies on inbred congenic lab
strains will hold in animals with a more diverse genetic
background. Further, laboratory studies cannot reveal the
effects of conditionally advantageous or deleterious alleles which will be discovered only in the presence of natural stress, such as spatially and temporally changes in
climate, food availability, competition, and associated
levels of parasitism [18,161]. Predicting the evolutionary
potential of wild host populations in response to parasites
requires at least a minimal understanding of the genetic
basis for host resistance and heritability under field conditions, and the strength and mode of parasite-mediated
selection [162]. Few studies have attempted to test for an
association between MHC polymorphism and parasite
resistance in wild populations under natural conditions
[19]. Available information is summarised in Table 1.

Under field conditions, associations between MHC heterozygosity and resistance/susceptibility to parasite infections have only been found in the African striped mouse
(Rhabdomys pumilio [163]) and in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus [47,164]) which seem to possess up to six MHC class II loci. In the later, a modification
of a simple heterozygote advantage was identified as
within individual fish, intermediate, rather than maximal
allele numbers were associated with minimal parasite

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

load [47,164]. This is explained by the fact that MHCgenes are involved in the preservation of T-cells during
thymic selection. At some point, increasing the number of
MHC molecules expressed should cause a net loss of Tcells and therefore negatively affect the organism [165]
(but see also Borghans and colleagues [166] who used a
simulation approach which revealed that several hundred
alleles would be required to cause such a net loss of Tcells). Different allele numbers can be produced by both
heterozygosity at single loci and differences in MHC class
II gene duplication numbers across haplotypes [167]. At
the moment it is not clear whether or not this selection
pattern of intermediate, rather than maximal allele numbers is confined to species with a relatively flexible
genomic architecture such as sticklebacks and other teleosts with haplotype variation in their MHC locus duplication numbers, or whether it represents a more general
feature that has been overlooked in previous studies
[168]. In mammals, a flexible MHC genomic architecture,
namely the appearance of multiple MHC class II DRB loci
with variable loci numbers between individuals has been
described in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta [169]) and
in California sea lions (Zalophus californicus [170]). The
later possess up to eight different DRB loci in variable configurations among individuals but with low levels of
allelic variation per loci. Preliminary evidence suggested
an association between a certain MHC genotype and urogenital cancer. In contrary to sticklebacks, no relationship
between the total number of unique DRB genes and the
presence of cancer has been identified [171]. A possible
relationship between the number of MHC alleles and parasitic load in mammals was also investigated in hairyfooted gerbils (Gerbillurus paeba) which possess two functional DRB loci [172]. Here, individuals carrying three different MHC alleles had significantly higher faecal egg
count values than individuals with four alleles [172]. This
is in accord with the theoretical background which
assumes that animals containing more MHC alleles than
others should be able to recognise a larger spectrum of
pathogen-derived antigens and consequently be infected
by less parasite species and/or to be generally less intensively infected [69].
An association between certain MHC alleles and disease
resistance or susceptibility was found in a free-ranging
sheep population (Soay sheep, Ovis aries) where MHC
variants appear to play a major role in protection against
strongyle nematode invasion, the most prevalent gastrointestinal parasite found [56]. As expected by the
assumptions of the 'negative frequency-dependent selection'
('rare-allele advantage hypothesis', 'Red Queen hypothesis',
'moving-target hypotheses') [73,81,82], the most common
alleles OLADRB 205 and 257 (allele frequencies: 0.21–
0.24) were associated with decreased lamb or yearling survivorship, whereas the rarer OLADRB 263 allele (allele

frequency: 0.13) was associated with increased yearling
survival (Table 1). Further evidence for the importance of
certain MHC alleles and resistance or susceptibility to
helminths was revealed in a common European rodent
(yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis [173]), in the
two African rodent species mentioned before (Gerbillurus
paeba [172], Rhabdomys pumilio [163]), and in a primate
species (gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus [174])
(Table 1). Also in R. pumilio, it was the most common
allele Rhpu-DRB*1 (allele frequency: 0.22) which
occurred more frequently in infected individuals and in
individuals with high faecal egg count values (indicating
high parasite load) whereas the rare allele Rhpu-DRB*8
(allele frequency: 0.05) occurred more often in individuals with low FEC values (indicating low parasite load).
Also in M. murinus, the common allele Mimu-DRB*1
(allele frequency: 0.33) was more frequently found in
infected individuals and in individuals with a high
number of different nematode species infections and faecal egg count values (eggs/g faeces) (indicating high parasite load), the rarer alleles Mimu-DRB*6 and *10 (allele
frequencies: 0.11 and 0.06) were more prevalent in not
infected individuals, in individuals with low number of
different nematode species infections and faecal egg count
values (indicating low parasite load). These examples
demonstrate the frequency-dependence of selection
between parasites and hosts in the form of a rare allele
advantage in the host population.
Evaluating the relative importance of balancing selective
mechanisms
Right now there is still much debate whether 'heterozygote
advantage' or 'frequency dependent selection hypothesis' is
most important for balancing selection [89]. Most studies
investigating 'heterozygote advantage' compared the infectious disease outcomes of heterozygotes at a given MHC
loci, as a group, to the outcomes of homozygotes at the
same locus, as a group ('population heterozygote advantage'
[70,175], examples see above) probably always due to
restrictions in sample size. However, comparing the
average performance of all heterozygotes against homozygotes, instead of using allele specific tests for
'overdominance', can not distinguish whether the observed
advantage is due to 'dominance' or 'overdominance'. Grouping all homozygotes and all heterozygotes, respectively,
circumvent tests of the original hypothesis namely the
superiority of heterozygotes over either corresponding
homozygote [69] (see paragraph 'Selection mechanisms'
above) as this hypothesis is conditional on the alleles
involved (and should be more precisely termed 'allele-specific overdominance' [175]). However, a theoretical model
showed that under a very wide range of assumptions
about the relationship between homozygote and heterozygote infectious risk, 'allele-specific overdominance' might
be consistent with 'population heterozygote advantage', e.g. a

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

'population heterozygote advantage' might occur when the
diversity of resistant alleles is sufficiently high and the
diversity of susceptible alleles is sufficiently low [175]. But
also the opposite might be true. Because of confounding
effects of differences in frequencies of susceptible or resistant alleles, population level tests can, in a worse case, find
a heterozygote advantage even when every heterozygote is
at greater infection risk than either corresponding
homozygote in allele-specific analyses [175]. Direct estimates of the allele-specific effects of heterozygosity relative to the corresponding homozygotes are rare. The most
convincing experimental evidence for heterozygote
advantage through 'allele-specific overdominance' derived
from McClelland and colleagues [140] using co-infections
with multiple pathogens in MHC-congenic mice with
reciprocal resistance/susceptibility profiles (but the
authors did not test for fitness consequences). In humans,
the only studies that directly compare the outcomes of
heterozygotes to those of homozygotes for the same alleles derived from investigations of autoimmune but not
from infectious diseases (summarised by [70,175]).
As mentioned above allele-specific analyses were most
often impossible due to restrictions in sample size. In
humans, recently a new approach to circumvent this problem was proposed by classifying alleles to supertypes
based on shared binding motifs [176,177]. Though it is
clear that the highly polymorphic HLA genes play a crucial
role in the immune response, their great diversity is a
major obstacle in distinguishing HLA allele-specific effects
and complicates the attribution of specific alleles with the
outcome of diseases. Collecting samples of the size
needed for definitive results is often not feasible. The biological relevance of a classification scheme based on functional binding specificities is supported by a growing
body of evidence of cross-presentation of specific peptidebinding motifs by different HLA molecules. Trachtenberg
and colleagues [176] investigated the usefulness of grouping HLA alleles to supertypes by their overlapping peptide
binding specificities in explaining the association between
HLA polymorphism and HIV disease progression. Their
study indicated that HLA-supertypes are highly predictive
of viral load. Consistent with the rare-allele advantage
model the authors could show the advantage of a rare
HLA supertype in progression of HIV [176]. After more
intense studies of the implications and limits of supertypes in large human data sets, this classification
approach of common functional traits may also provide
tools for the MHC research in natural endangered populations, where high allelic diversity causes problems in
obtaining sufficiently large statistical sample sizes. Caution must be taken not to miss the effects of new, rare alleles by clustering alleles in functional types.

As outlined before, two different 'overdominance' models
have been suggested: a) 'symmetric overdominance' or 'symmetric balancing selection' [74], whereby all heterozygotes
derive a similar selective advantage to homozygotes (= all
heterozygous are selectively equivalent), and b) 'divergent
allele advantage' [75]. As almost all heterozygote advantage
studies were carried out on the population level, so far, no
effort has been made to differentiate between these two
'overdominance' models in infectious disease studies. However, the 'divergent allele advantage' hypothesis has recently
been considered in MHC-dependent mate choice studies
[121,178]. In the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys
pumilio) where associations between MHC heterozygosity
and resistance/susceptibility to parasite infections have
been found [163], no significant correlation between pairwise genetic distances of heterozygotes (a measurement
for allelic divergence) and infection rates (faecal egg
count: log-transformed number of eggs per gram faeces)
was found (Froeschke & Sommer, unpublished data).
Another point that need to be mentioned is that only a
few studies in natural populations indicating correlative
evidence for 'heterozygote advantage' combined MHC
research with estimates of genome-wide diversity by using
neutral markers and thus could rule out possible effects of
genome-wide heterosis [47,137].
With respect to the 'frequency dependent selection hypothesis',
evidence for pathogen-resistant/susceptible alleles/haplotypes is not equally available. So far, more alleles/haplotypes were found to be associated with susceptibility to
disease [67] (but see Table 1). This bias could be simply
due to over presentation of human studies, in which the
emphasis has been on finding disease-allele associations
[179]. But it is also in line with theoretical predictions of
host-parasite coevolution. Susceptibility is expected to be
more common, because fast evolution of the parasite is
assumed to fuel the arms race between them and their
hosts. For most pathogens it is valid to assume a higher
evolutionary potential compared to that of the host,
because generation times are usually much shorter or
effective population sizes of pathogen populations are
larger [18]. The human HLA-A11 allele, for example, confers resistance to infection with Epstein-Barr-virus only in
populations where the allele is rare. In populations with
high frequency of this allele, virus strains have fixed a
mutation that prevents presentation of immunodominant epitopes by HLA-A11 molecules [147]. Also certain
HLA alleles are associated with a slower progression of
HIV if they are rare and have no advantage if they are common (summarised by [176]). This shows that a fast-evolving pathogen is able to adapt to host defence.
Evaluating the relative importance of both balancing
selective mechanisms, so far, more evidence is available
for the importance of specific MHC-alleles in parasite

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/16

resistance or susceptibility. It is conceivable that a rare
allele may have a high fitness and at the same time a constant advantage for heterozygotes. Both hypotheses may
be in accord with each other and are not mutually exclusive. But as most studies deal with single viral, bacterial or
parasitic agents it was suggested that studies combining
two or more pathogens may increase the amount of evidence for heterozygote advantage [57,136,140] (but see
[173,174]). De Boer and colleagues [180] studied the
degree of MHC polymorphism arising when 'heterozygote
advantage' is the only selection pressure by using mathematical models. The simulations revealed that 'heterozygote advantage' on its own is not sufficient to explain the
high population diversity of the MHC. This would require
that the fitness contributions of all alleles would be unrealistically similar. 'Heterozygote advantage' in pathogen
resistance could, however, promote mating preferences
for MHC-dissimilarity, which in turn drive high allelic
diversity [52,68,70]. This could explain why MHC-heterozygous males have attributes important during sexual
selection such as an increased antler development and
body mass in white deer [181] and sexually attractive
odour in stickleback fish [46]. In contrast, a study on sexual selection in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) found that
females prefer males with larger spurs, and that this sexually selected trait is associated with a particular MHC
allele [182,183]. The overall view is emerging that
although 'heterozygote advantage' is clearly an important
selection pressure additional frequency-dependent selection pressure is required. A theoretical model by Hedrick
[89] indicated that the selective force from pathogens,
which vary in space and time ('diversifying selection in space
and time'), could maintain the genetic polymorphism in
MHC genes. Since evolving pathogens mainly evade presentation by the most common MHC alleles in the host
population, they provide a selective pressure for a large
variety of rare alleles. Host-parasite coevolution would be
sufficient to explain the large degree of MHC polymorphism [145].
In ongoing studies assessing the evolutionary genetic
details of vertebrate host-parasite relationships and evidence for frequency-dependent parasite-driven selection
four patterns ought to be evident: (1) parasitism reduces
host fitness, (2) MHC alleles differ in susceptibility, (3)
alleles frequencies change according to (2), and (4) in the
longer term dynamics should encompass frequencydependent allele frequency fluctuations [17]. Whereas (1)
and (2) indicate the potential for selection and have been
shown in recent studies in wildlife populations (e.g.
[184], this review), so far evidence for (3) and (4) is limited. Ongoing investigations of the parasite-driven selection mechanisms under natural conditions should focus
on temporal variation of pathogens, host fitness attributes

and allele frequencies to test whether allele frequencies
change accordingly in a cycling pattern.
Functional differences of amino acid variation in the
antigen binding sites
There is increasing evidence that pathogen escape from
MHC-dependent immune system recognition may
involve changes in only a few amino acids so that small
binding-motif differences can lead to large differences in
protection. Common mechanisms include changes in
pathogen antigens (epitopes) that prevent binding (1) to
the MHC-encoded cell surface glycoprotein or (2) to the
T-cell receptor. (3) A third mechanism is molecular mimicry of host proteins that prevent T-cell receptor binding
(T-cells that recognise host proteins are destroyed during
thymic selection). For instance, a one-amino-acid difference in the antigen-binding region of the DRB*1302
allele abrogates its protection to malaria (summarised by
[185,186]). In Malagasy mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), MHC-alleles associated with gastrointestinal nematode susceptibility (Mimu-DRB*1, *6 and *10) have
unique amino acid motifs in the antigen binding sites
(ABS) [174]. Mimu-DRB*1 associated with high parasite
load differs from all other alleles by three unique amino
acids, all of them located within the functional important
ABS (aspartic acid in position 70, glutamic acid in position 71, lysine in position 74). Two of these ABS are
mutated in Mimu-DRB*6 and *10 currently associated
with low parasite load: the allele Mimu-DRB*6 has a
unique motif at position 74 (glycine) and Mimu-DRB*10
at position 71 (methionine). In addition, only MimuDRB*6 and *10 possess the amino acid arginine located
next to the ABS in position 78 [174] (position numbers
after [62]). This indicates the functional differences of certain amino acids in the ABS and thus the influence of different amino acid compositions on parasite resistance.

So far, the molecular details of the interactions between
helminth parasites and the intestinal components of the
immune system are not as well understood as for viral or
bacterial infections. However, huge progress was made in
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms in
the immune regulation by gastrointestinal helminth parasites in recent years. The recognition of gastrointestinal
parasites and their antigens, and the initiation of the
immune response occur in specialised lymph nodes in the
epithelium of the gut wall, the so called Peyer's patches. In
these Peyer's patches all cell types necessary for antigen
presentation to CD4+ T-cells including MHC class II molecules are present. This activates a range of interacting
processes against the parasite culminating in an inflammatory reaction in the intestinal mucosa and different
effector mechanisms against the invading parasite (summarised in [186-191]).

Importance of MHC variability in conservation
Importance of adaptive genetic variability with respect to
human impact
Human impact (e.g. habitat fragmentation, degradation,
isolation, urbanisation, pollution) has diverse impacts on
the ecology and genetics of both, vertebrate and parasite
populations. It often causes a loss of genetic variation
leading to short-term reduction of fitness components,
and to an impaired ability to adapt to changing environments which in turn influences evolutionary outcomes
[5,6,12,18,192]. Habitat degradation and climatic conditions are also crucial parameters in terms of distribution,
transmission and developmental success of parasites and
pathogens [18,192,193]. Such changes may have significant implications for outbreak patterns of pest species, the
conservation of rare mammal species and their ecological
functions, as well as associated veterinary and medical
consequences for wildlife, lifestock and humans [194].
Rapid evolution (on the order of decades or shorter) has
been supported by numerous examples from host-parasite systems, and it is now clear that pathogens can cause
major shifts in the genetic composition of their hosts on
short timescales [18,162,195]. Detectable changes in
allele frequencies can occur between subsequent generations and can be a sensitive indicator for demographic
changes in some species [196].

The effects of pollution on the MHC was investigated in
the estuary killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) [33]. Populations experiencing strong differences in antigenic challenges (PCB-contaminated versus unpolluted site) show
significant differences in amino acid substitution patterns
in a highly variable MHC class II B locus. However,
whether MHC population profile differences represent
direct effects of chemical toxicants or parasite-mediated
selection need to be investigated [33]. The only study
including an environmental variable such as habitat fragmentation in the analysis of associations of MHC-constitution and parasite burden was carried out in a subdivided
mouse lemur population [174]. The work indicated that
variation in MHC-allele frequencies in the fragments were
linked to parasite load as certain alleles which differed in
a few amino acids in the ABS from other alleles (see
above) were associated to parasite resistance or susceptibility. Female mouse lemurs inhabiting the fragment with
the highest parasite load had a lower fat deposition in the
tail (important during the dry season) and therefore lower
survival rates than populations of the three other fragments. In addition, the population size declined dramatically in recent years [197]. However, to clearly separate
whether the higher parasite load in the respective fragment is due to the MHC-constitution of individuals
inhabiting this fragment or due to other ecological factors
associated with fragment size or degradation needs further
investigations [174]. Nevertheless, the study suggests that

the MHC-constitution might influence the long-term survival of small fragmented animal populations and indicates the functional importance of maintenance of MHC
variability in declining or fragmented animal
populations.
More studies in free ranging animal populations with
respect to human impact are needed to allow more general conclusions on the importance of adaptive genetic
variability in conservation. According to the theoretical
background, temporal and spatial variation in the parasitic fauna will cause shifts of selective advantage of certain MHC-alleles in different areas changing over time.
This should result in habitat- and climate-specific amino
acid substitution patterns in the functional important ABS
in relation to local pathogen-driven selective pressures. So
far, empirical evidence for 'diversifying selection in space and
time' is limited. Studies on the interaction between environmental conditions and the expression of genetic covariation (the so called genotype-environment interaction)
might be an important avenue for future work. Genotypeenvironment interactions have commonly been found in
live history traits when multiple environments were considered reflecting the fact that genes influencing a trait in
one environment may not be important in a different one
[198]. In this context, host and parasite movement among
habitat fragments could be crucial to both parasite persistence, and the spread and maintenance of resistance alleles
and thus to allow ongoing coevolutionary processes. The
role of metapopulation dynamics in maintaining the
diversity of host resistance genes can be a matter of con-

cern in conservation genetics aiming at the preservation of
both current patterns and ongoing processes. As contemporary evolution is influenced by complex interactions
among population size, genetic variation, strength of
selection, and gene flow, the overall goal in conservation
genetics – maintenance of short-term local adaptations
and preservation of long-term adaptive potential – might
be a challenging task [32].
Relevance of MHC polymorphism for individual fitness
and long-term persistence
Genetic variation at MHC loci is thought to be important
for resistance against pathogens, thereby increasing individual fitness and thus the long-term survival of endangered species [60,73]. Several studies have reported
decreased pathogen resistance among MHC homozygotes, or an increase in pathogen susceptibility in inbred
individuals in general. However, a direct link between
pathogen-mediated population decline and low MHC
variation has been difficult to demonstrate in natural populations [49]. Recent studies indicated that although
MHC allele numbers are low in many bottlenecked species most of them still indicate a high degree of divergence
between alleles. Table 2 summarises the number of functional important MHC class II DRB exon 2 alleles and
sequence diversity in some free-ranging vertebrate populations investigated in their natural habitat. The comparison indicates that also species with a low number of
different MHC alleles, such as the critically endangered
Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat (Hypogeomys antimena, 5 alleles) whose geographic range was recently restricted to less

than 20,000 ha, still have high levels of nucleotide and
amino acid divergence between MHC DRB-alleles while
mitochondrial d-loop sequences revealed very low variability [199-201]. A similar picture was revealed in the
Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalskii, 6 alleles [55]), in the
Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx, 3 alleles [129]) and in the
South African bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus, 6
alleles [130]) (Table 2). Considering the nonABS, the
ratio between non-synonymous (dn) and synonymous
(ds) substitutions was significantly smaller (dn < ds) than
unity in some species (Fig. 1) which indicates purifying
selection acting on these codons depending on their
respective function [202]. In contrary, comparisons of
non-synonymous (dn) and synonymous (ds) substitution
rates in parts coding for the functional important ABS
revealed a significantly higher rate of substitutions (dn >
ds) which change the amino acid constitution in the ABS
and thus increase the divergence between alleles in all
species irrespective of the number of MHC alleles still
present (Fig. 1).

The studies indicate that selection processes are able to
maintain MHC polymorphism also under unfavourable
conditions at least for a certain time which in turn might
suggest that levels of variability in species with low numbers of MHC alleles might be sufficient to prevent immediate pathogen-mediated population decline. However,
in such populations adaptive processes to changing conditions might be limited. An intriguing question is still
what happens if new pathogens arise which differ from
commonly encountered diseases by the respective populations. It is reasonable to assume that the maintenance
and even more renewal of variation in functional important parts of the MHC such as in the antigen binding sites,
either from mutation, recombination or immigration
from other populations is an important genetic component in the cascade leading to an appropriate immune
response, when combating new or coevolving virulent
pathogens. It was suggested that the extremely low genetic
variability in cheetahs (Aconyx jubatus) as a consequence
of inbreeding depression due to a substantial bottleneck

about 10,000 ago limits adaptation processes to temporary pathogens which might explain the high disease susceptibility nowadays [118,203]. As in other mainly
endangered species, the proposed association cannot be
tested as there are no genetically variable outbred cheetah
population to compare with [21]. Samples from preserved
bones or from museum specimens in the case of recently
presumed bottlenecks would be necessary to directly
assess historical levels of MHC variation and to evaluate
the relative role of demographic changes in determining
existing levels of genetic diversity at the MHC [127].
Concerning the role of MHC in conservation genetics, the
potential functional role of background genes (non-MHC
genes) in disease resistance should not be ignored.
Human studies indicate that background genes might also
play an important role in determining pathogen and parasite resistance, either by themselves or in a epistatic manner with MHC-genes (summarised by [179,204]. Many of
the regulatory genes show high polymorphism and, for
example, variation in the tumor necrosis factor gene promotor, cytokines such as interleucin receptor, γ-interferon
receptor vitamin and D receptor has been associated to
infectious diseases (summarised by [187,191,204].
Although evidence is accumulating that the MHC is one of
the main factors controlling resistance to diseases
[176,205] conservation genetics should focus on the preservation of both, MHC and genome-wide diversity.
Thereby, how much MHC diversity is required to ensure
long-term population viability remains a fundamental
question in conservation genetics [133] and can only be
investigated close follow-ups of the genetic and health status of declining populations.

Conclusion
The diverse functions and characteristics place genes of
the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. In contrary to neutral markers, MHC variability
reflects evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes
within and between populations and is very suitable to
investigate a wide range of open questions in evolutionary
ecology and conservation.
The selective effects from different pathogens appear to be
the major driving force in the maintenance of MHC variation. Evidence of balancing selection at MHC genes has
been found at different temporal scales. Selection in the
distant past has been documented as an excess of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, and as trans-species polymorphism. Selection in the recent past has been
determined by excess heterozygosity compared to neutral
theory expectations, differences in FST-values compared to
neutral theory, or excess linkage equilibrium. Selection in
the current generation has been identified by measuring

deviations from Hardy-Weinberg or random mating proportions, survival differences between homozygotes and
heterozygotes, and correlations of disease resistance with
MHC-allele or genotype [90]. Changes in certain amino
acids in the functional important MHC-coded antigen
binding sites and thus the amino acid compositions influence functional differences in pathogen and parasite
resistance. It is reasonable to assume that the maintenance
and even more renewal of variation in functional important parts of the MHC such as in the antigen binding sites,
either from mutation, recombination or immigration
from other populations is an important genetic component in the cascade leading to an appropriate immune
response, when combating new or coevolving virulent
pathogens and might be important in conservation genetics. Studies indicate the functional importance of MHC
variability in pathogen and parasite resistance not only in
humans or in model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions where most of our current knowledge
derived from, but also in wild animal populations investigated in their natural environment. Only field studies in
free-ranging animal populations can reveal the effects of
conditionally advantageous or deleterious alleles in the
presence of natural stress (e.g. spatially and temporally
changes in climate, food availability, and competition),
associated levels of parasitism, and thus the ubiquity of
pathogen-driven selective mechanisms and the importance of MHC diversity across taxa. The combination with
an experimental approach under standardized laboratory
conditions is needed to prove the causal relationships
behind correlations observed in the field.
Right now it is not quite clear whether 'heterozygote advantage' or 'frequency-dependent selection hypothesis' is most
important for balancing selection. Most studies investigating 'heterozygote advantage' compared the infectious disease outcomes of heterozygotes at a given MHC loci, as a
group, to the outcomes of homozygotes at the same locus,
as a group ('population heterozygote advantage'). Comparing
the average performance of all heterozygotes against
homozygotes, instead of using allele specific tests for 'overdominance' (= 'allele-specific overdominance') circumvent
tests of the original hypothesis namely the superiority of
heterozygotes over either corresponding homozygote as
this hypothesis is conditional on the alleles involved.
Allele-specific analyses were most often impossible due to
restrictions in sample size. In humans, recently a new
approach to circumvent this problem was proposed by
classifying alleles to supertypes based on shared binding
motifs [176,177]. After more intense studies of the implications and limits of supertypes in large human data sets,
this classification approach of common functional traits
may also provide tools for the MHC research in natural
endangered populations, where high allelic diversity
causes problems in obtaining sufficiently large statistical

sample sizes. Caution must be taken not to miss the
effects of new, rare alleles by clustering alleles in functional types. So far, more evidence is available for the
importance of specific MHC-alleles in parasite resistance
or susceptibility. It is conceivable that a rare allele may
have a high fitness and at the same time a constant advantage for heterozygotes thus both modes of balancing selection may act synergistically to enhance the maintenance
of polymorphism.
Ongoing investigations of the parasite-driven selection
mechanisms under natural conditions should focus on
temporal variation of pathogens, host fitness attributes
and allele frequencies to test whether allele frequencies
change accordingly in a cycling pattern. Assessing the
immunogenetic status of a population relative to another
experiencing different suites of antigenic challenges will
help to increase our knowledge on the importance of
adaptive genetic variability in free ranging animal
populations with respect to human impact and the role of
the MHC in evolutionary ecology and conservation.
