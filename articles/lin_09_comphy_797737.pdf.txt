Abstract
Background: With the increasing availability of whole genome sequences, it is becoming
more and more important to use complete genome sequences for inferring species
phylogenies. We developed a new tool ComPhy, 'Composite Distance Phylogeny', based on
a composite distance matrix calculated from the comparison of complete gene sets between
genome pairs to produce a prokaryotic phylogeny.
Results: The composite distance between two genomes is defined by three components:
Gene Dispersion Distance (GDD), Genome Breakpoint Distance (GBD) and Gene Content
Distance (GCD). GDD quantifies the dispersion of orthologous genes along the genomic
coordinates from one genome to another; GBD measures the shared breakpoints between
two genomes; GCD measures the level of shared orthologs between two genomes. The
phylogenetic tree is constructed from the composite distance matrix using a neighbor
joining method. We tested our method on 9 datasets from 398 completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes. We have achieved above 90% agreement in quartet topologies
between the tree created by our method and the tree from the Bergey's taxonomy. In
comparison to several other phylogenetic analysis methods, our method showed
consistently better performance.
Conclusion: ComPhy is a fast and robust tool for genome-wide inference of evolutionary
relationship among genomes. It can be downloaded from http://digbio.missouri.edu/

Background
The systematic classification of bacteria has been a longstanding problem because very limited morphological
features are available. For a long time researchers could
only group together similar bacteria for practical determinative needs [1]. Woese and collaborators initiated molecular phylogeny of prokaryotes by making use of the small
subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences [2]. The
ssu-rRNA trees [3] have been considered as the standard
Tree of Life by many biologists.
Attempts to explicate the phylogeny of prokaryotes based
on the ssu-rRNA have been by-and-large successful [3,4].
However, although such molecules have proved to be very
useful phylogenetic markers, mutational saturation is a
problem due to the restricted length and limited number
of mutation sites [5]. Another well-known problem is that
phylogenetic trees, constructed on single gene families
may show conflicts [6] due to a variety of causes, such as
LGT (Lateral Gene Transfer) [7], hybridization, lineagesorting, paralogous genes [8], and pseudogenes [9]. With
the increasing availability of whole genome sequences,
methods using vast amounts of phylogenetic information
contained in complete genome sequences are becoming
more and more important for inferring species phylogenies. Because phylogenetic information extracted from
whole genomes is based on the maximum genetic information, the resulting phylogenetic tree should be the best
reflection of the evolutionary history of the species,
assuming this history is tree-like [7,10]. Phylogenomics,
i.e. using entire genomes to infer a species tree, represents
the state of art for reconstructing phylogenies [11,12].
A relatively obvious approach to phylogenetic analysis of
whole genomes uses multiple sequence alignments with
certain evolutionary models [9,13]. However, the multiple sequence alignment strategy may not work for whole
genomes and the evolutionary models may not always be
applicable. Multiple sequence alignment could be misleading due to gene rearrangements, inversion, transposition and translocation at the genome level [7,8], unequal
lengths of sequences, LGT, etc. On the other hand, reliable
statistical evolution models are yet to be suggested for
complete genomes.
To address these issues, Sankoff and Blanchette [18]
defined an evolutionary edit distance as the number of
inversions, transpositions and deletions/insertions
required to change the gene order from one genome into
another. Similar distance measures using rearrangement,
recombination, breakpoint, comparative mapping and
gene order have been extensively studied for whole
genome phylogeny [14-21]. These approaches are computationally expensive, and in general do not produce cor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S5

rect results on events such as non-contiguous copies of a
gene on the genome or non-decisive gene order.
Gene content was proposed as distance measure in whole
genome phylogeny where "the similarity between two
species is defined as the number of genes they have in
common divided by their total number of genes" [22].
This idea was further extended to use lists of nucleotide
segment pairs in comparison instead of lists of genes [23].
Such method fails when the gene contents of organisms
are very similar, such as bacteria in closely related families, or chimerical genomes.
Overlapping gene information was also used to infer the
genome phylogenies [24]. Overlapping genes are defined
as pairs of adjacent genes of which the coding sequences
overlap partly or entirely. Although overlapping genes
have been shown to be a consistent and conserved feature
across all microbial genomes sequenced to date [25], the
limited amount of overlapping genes is usually not
enough for evaluating a large number of genomes.
Some other methods infer phylogenies based on protein
structural domain information [26-31], which considers
LGT. However, they assume some proteome evolution
models with lateral structural domain transfer events,
which may not be accurate. Also, the method readjusts the
protein structural domain graph each time when a LGT
event is introduced, the complexity of model testing
increases substantially when large number of lateral structural domain transfer events been assumed.
In this paper, we introduce a new tool 'ComPhy', which
utilizes a robust and much less complex strategy, called
'Gene Composite Distance'. It combines different aspects
of evolutionary relationships among genomes to produce
a phylogenetic tree from a given set of whole genome
sequences. We have applied this approach to 398 prokaryotic genomes, which were downloaded from NCBI [32].
More precisely, composite distance measure starts with an
all-against-all pairwise genome comparison using BLASTP
[33]. In the second step, a distance matrix is calculated
from three components, i.e., GDD (Gene Dispersion distance), GBD (Genome Breakpoint distance) and GCD
(Gene Content distance). This distance matrix is then fed
to a distance-based algorithm, Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
[34,35], using a third-party tool 'Phylip' [47] to produce a
phylogenetic tree. In our current study, we do not consider
LGT. Our goal is to have mathematically tractability and
to develop a generalized phylogenetic distance model and
a phylogenetic tree construction platform that can be easily applied to any species. Furthermore, using the completely sequenced genomes allows the construction of a
phylogeny less sensitive to inconsistencies, such as LGT,
unrecognized paralogy, and highly variable rates of evolu-

tion among different regions in a genome. The result phylogenetic trees are more representative of whole-genomes
than those from single-gene trees.

Methods
Taxon selection
398 single-chromosome prokaryotic genome protein
sequences were downloaded in the Fasta format from the
NCBI [32] ftp server in September 2007. The physical
gene location files of these genomes were also downloaded from NCBI in a tab-delimited format. We represent the species biological names as defined in Bergey's
code [1]. For example, a lineage in the Bergey's Manual of
Systematic Bacteriology or its online outline is abbreviated as B13.3.2.6.2 = Phylum BXIII (Firmicutes), Class III
(Bacilli), Order II (Lactobacillales), Family VI (Streptococcaceae), Genus II (Lactococcus). Table 1 shows the taxon
statistics of the 432 prokaryotic genomes, including 34
multi-chromosomal species that we do not consider in
this paper.

In order to test the performance of our method, 9 datasets
with different combinations of the whole 398 genomes
are formed for different purposes. Dataset 1 is formed by
52 randomly selected species from the Bergey's taxonomy

tree to test for robustness. We like to test the performance
of our method on this broad range of species. Dataset 2
has 53 species, half of them are randomly picked from
Archaea genomes (A in Bergey's code) and half are randomly picked from Baceteria genomes (B in Bergey's
code). These 53 species from two major clades have a clear
taxonomy structure with two clusters. Dataset 3 has 82
species, half of them are from Phylum B12 since half of
398 genomes are actually from B12 Phylum, and the other
half is randomly selected from all the other types of
genomes, i.e., half of them have a tight cluster and the
other half are diverse. Dataset 4 includes all the 398 single
chromosome genomes. Since many prokaryotes are from
Phylum B12 and Phylum B13, therefore, we form datasets
5 and 6 from all the 181 Phylum B12 genomes and 96
Phylum B13 genomes, respectively, to test for the effects
of the co-linearity of datasets on phylogeny construction.
Dataset 7 is a union of datasets 5 and 6, again with two
tight clusters of species. Dataset 8 has 165 prokaryotic species obtained from BPhyOG [24] in order to compare the
performance between our method and the overlapping
gene based phylogeny used by BPhyOG. Dataset 9, with
54 prokaryotic species was obtained from Deeds [31] for
comparing performance between our method and the
structural domain based phylogeny construction. Both
dataset 8 or 9 contain a subset of the 398 complete
prokaryotic data. We believe these 9 diverse datasets allow
us to test the robustness of our method comprehensively.

Identification of orthologs
The initial step in the phylogenetic analysis methods is to
determine which genes are to be compared between species. Since the ultimate goal is determining the distance
between every two genomes, intuitively we use pairwise
orthology for every pair of genomes. So far there is no
existing database containing the orthologous groups for
all the genomes that we are studying.

Here, we define orthologs by performing an all-against-all
BLAST between every pair of protein sequences for each
pair of species. The reciprocal best BLAST hits are used to
determine the list of orthologs between every pair of species. Additional filtering methods have also been applied
to refine the list of orthologs between the pair of genomes,
such as pairs of genes to be considered orthologs must satisfy BLAST hit with E-values below 10-3 and sequence
identity higher than 30%. The tests of variations of
ortholog definition will be shown in the Result and Discussion section. In ComPhy, we also give the users the
flexibility to apply their definitions of orthologs.
Composite distance phylogeny
This strategy is to compute a distance between any two
genomes X and Y based on the set of orthologs obtained
in the previous step. This new systematic composite dis-

tance measurement takes into account both similarities
and dissimilarities between every pair of genomes using
their entire gene sets. ComPhy utilizes this composite distance formulation to determine the phylogeny for given
genomes. The formulation will be discussed in three separated calculation steps, GDD, 'Gene Dispersion Distance', GBD, 'Genome Breakpoint Distance' and GCD,
'Gene Content Distance'.
GDD (Gene dispersion distance)
The first component, GDD, is to quantify the extent of dispersion of orthologs from one genome to another. Our
assumption is that the closer the two species in the evolutionary tree, the more similar the physical arrangements
of corresponding orthologs are. The dispersion of
orthologs from one genome to another can be seen as
how far orthologs move away from their physical locations during evolution due to events such as rearrangement, recombination, insertion and deletion. The further
the evolution distance of the two species, the more dispersed the orthologs between two species are. In other
words, the distance separations of pairs of orthologs are
more conserved between a pair of closely related
genomes. To simplify the problem, we consider only pairs
of orthologs that are right next to each other. The gene dispersion distance of an ortholog pair from genome A to
genome B can be then formulated as

∑ li,i +1
d GDD ( A, B) =
n2
where li, i+1 is the distance separation between the i-th
ortholog and the (i+1)-th ortholog of genome B in
genome A. For example, if orthologs bi and bi+1 are next to
each other on genome B, but their corresponding
orthologs ax and ay in genome A are l orthologs apart
(counting 1 ortholog separation as 1 distance unit), then
the distance between this ortholog pair is l. n is number of
orthologs between genomes A and B, which is the maximum dispersion distance. For normalization, one n is
needed to normalize the size of a genome or the total
number of orthologs (n). Another n is to normalize the
dispersion distance against the maximum distance
between two orthologs, which is n also. Thus, n2 is needed
for normalization. In fact, the normalization factors, such
as n, n2, and n3, have been tested to see performances. Our
study has shown that using n2 as the normalization factor,
in terms of range of dispersion distance and number of
shared orthologs, has the optimal results.
Note, the gene dispersions, from A to B and from B to A,
are not necessarily symmetric. We can define the dispersion distance measure in three different ways, namely, we
can use the average D(A, B) = [d(A, B) + d(B, A)]/2 or use
one of the two directions, either D(A, B) = d(A, B) or D(A,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S5

B) = d(B, A). Our study indicates that this directionality
does have some impact on the overall performance and
averaging over both directions produces better and more
consistent results. Thus, the dispersion distance between
genome A and B is defined as
D(A, B) = [d(A, B) + d(B, A)]/2
Figure 1 shows two different dispersions of orthologs
pairs between genome B and genome A, and between
genome B and genome C as a hypothetical example. To
calculate the distance between two genomes, we need to
calculate each distance separation of pair of neighboring
orthologs of one genome in another. In Figure 1, given
there are 13 orthologs, the distance separation for
orthologs pair of b1b2 is a4a11, so distance separation of
b1b2 is l b1b 2 = a11 - a4 = 7, and distance separation of b2b3 is

l b 2b3 = a11 - a5 = 6, etc. The total distance separations of all
ortholog pairs bibi+1 of genome B in A is

∑ lb ,b
i

i +1

= 66,

and hence, dGDD(B, A) = 66/132 = 0.391 for GDD from
genome B to A. Using same calculation, we can get
dGDD(A, B) = 47/132 = 0.278, dGDD(C, B) = 38/132 = 0.225
and dGDD(B, C) = 37/132 = 0.219. We then get D(A, B) =
0.34 and D(B, C) = 0.22. As a result, genome B is closer
related to genome C than to genome A. In other words,
the ortholog pair distance separations are more conserved
between B and C than between A and B.
We will also use a real example of three bacterial species,
Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2 (A1.1.1.1.3), Pyrobaculum
islandicum DSM 4185 (A1.1.1.1.3), and Thermus thermophilus HB27 (B4.1.2.1.1) as an example to show the
gene dispersion distance idea. By putting the dispersion
distances of ortholog pairs, between P. aerophilum and P.
islandicum and between P. aerophilum and T. thermophilus,
in different distance bins, Figure 2 demonstrates the conservation of the dispersion distance of ortholog pairs
between closely related species. P. aerophilum and P. islandicum, both belong to Thermoproteaceae family in Thermoprotei order, so in the figure the black bins show
uneven distribution of frequencies and most dispersion
distances are falling into the smallest distance bin. This
result agrees with the experimental finding that these two
species are highly similar in terms of contents of genes
and overall genome organization [48]. In contrast, T. thermophilus is a member of Thermaceae family in Deinococci
order, as a result the white bins show more evenly distributes of dispersion distances among distance bins.

Gene dispersions example between pairs of genomes. The horizontal dark lines represent hypothetical genomes A, B
and C. Each vertical box on the line is an ortholog and all orthologs are indexed according to their physical locations. The line
connecting two boxes from one genome to another represents corresponding orthologs between two genomes.

GBD (genome breakpoint distance)
This distance transformation is based on the concept of
breakpoints, where two sequence segments map consecutive intervals in one genome onto non-consecutive intervals in the other [18,40]. We simplified it by considering
a breakpoint as where two ortholog sets map consecutively in one genome but not in the other. In other words,
a breakpoint defined here is where the consecutive mapping of a set of orthologs between two genomes stops. Figure 3 gives a hypothetical example. There are two
separated sets of consecutive orthologous genes and they
are (a3b2, a4b3, a5b4, a6b5) and (a8b13, a9b12, a10b11), the
consecutive mapping between genome A and B stops at
positions a2a3, a6a7 and a10a11 in genome B. Therefore,
there would be three breakpoints between genome A and
genome B. Let XAB be the number of breakpoints between
genome A and genome B, and NAB be the total number of
orthologs between genome A and genome B. We then
define a breakpoint similarity between A and B as

D GBD ( A, B) = 1 −

X AB
N AB

Using Figure 3 as an example, there are 3 breakpoints and
there are 13 orthologs, and hence, DGBD(A, B) is 1–3/13 =
0.769.
GCD (gene content distance)
The last component of composite distance is calculated
using the idea of gene content [22] to show the similarity
between two genomes. Here, we define the distance as

D GCD ( X , Y ) = 1 /(

2*N c
)
N X +NY

where Nc is the number of orthologs between X genome
and Y genome, NX is the number of genes in genome X,
and NY is the number of genes in genome Y.

generalize the conservation of gene order into an accurate
and robust measurement.
Other genome distance measures
To compare with methods developed by other researchers, we also implemented several other distance measures
for phylogenetic analysis.
(1) Overlapping gene phylogenetic distance
Overlapping genes (OG) [24] are defined as pairs of adjacent genes of which the coding sequences overlap partly
or entirely. The distance between genomes i and j is
defined as:

Figure 2 of dispersion distance countsto P. aerophilum
to P. aerophilum and from T. thermophilus from P. islandicum
Histograms
Histogram of dispersion distance counts from P.
islandicum to P. aerophilum and from T. thermophilus
to P. aerophilum. We divide the range of dispersion distance between ortholog pairs into 10 bins on X-axis between
P. aerophilum and P. islandicum and between P. aerophilum and
T. thermophilus. The lower indexed bin contains shorter dispersion distance of ortholog pairs. The height of the bin represents the frequency of dispersion distance falling into the
bin. Using P. aerophilum as the target genome, a black bar represents the frequency of the dispersion distance between
genomes P. aerophilum and P. islandicum, and a white bar represents the frequency of dispersion distance between P. aerophilum and T. thermophilus.

Composite distance formulation
The composite distance used in this paper for genome distance calculation has three distance components
described above, where they represent three different
aspects of genomes. GDD describes conservation of relative physical separation distances of orthologs, where this
conservation can be thought as evolution timestamps.
GBD utilizes the ordering of genes between a pair of
genomes. Although it has some correlation with the first
component, GBD reflects more local synteny (such as
micro-synteny) instead of large-scale genome rearrangement characterized by GDD. GCD shows the level of similarity shared from genome composition without
considering gene locations. It acts as an adjustment for
different sizes of genomes, which could be thought as a
normalization factor. Preliminary experiments showed
that they are all very informative (Table 2). Therefore, the
composite distance is defined as following:

D(X, Y) = logDGDD + logDGBD + logDGCD
We apply logarithm to the formula for retaining precision
of computing and correcting the saturation effects in
sequence data [41]. By considering the three distances, we

D ij = 1 −

x ij + x ji
2*min( x i , x j )

where xi is the number of OG pairs in genome i and xij is
the number of OG pairs in genome i that have their
respective orthologs in genome j, and vice versa for other
subscripts.
(2) Structural domain phylogenetic distance
The structural domain based distance method [31] uses
the idea of Protein Domain Universe Graph (PDUG), a
graph in which a nonredundant set of all known protein
structural domains [42,43] are represented as nodes, and
the structural similarity between domains is used to
define edges between them. The distribution of edges per
node in the graph was shown markedly different from
random graph [44]. By combining with information of
probability of LGT events, a similarity distance between
species could be constructed. For example, degree distribution is calculated by comparing domain graph against
known PDUG as follows:
MaxkN 0

p N ( k) =

∑
s=k

⎛ s ⎞⎛ N ⎞⎛
N ⎞
⎟⎜1 −
⎟
⎜ ⎟⎜
k ⎠ ⎝ N0 ⎠ ⎝
N0 ⎠
⎝

s−k

where Maxk N 0 is the degree of the maximally connected
node in the underlying graph (such as PDUG) with N0
nodes and a species graph with N nodes.
LGT is modeled as the movement of a node from a proteome in which that node exists into a proteome in which
it does not. A transfer does not remove the node from the
“donor” organism, but it may replace (thus, “erase”) one
of the nodes in the acceptor organism to preserve the proteome size. The donor and acceptor organisms are chosen
randomly, and the transferred node is chosen randomly
from the set of nodes in the donor proteome that do not
exist in the acceptor proteome. The acceptor node that is
replaced is also chosen at random.

Identification of Breakpoints
Identification of Breakpoints. The horizontal lines represent hypothetical genomes A and B. Each vertical box on the line is
an ortholog and all orthologs are indexed according to their physical locations. The line connecting two boxes from one
genome to another represents corresponding orthologs between two genomes. The solid lines connecting orthologs belong to
some consecutive ortholog sets. The dotted lines connecting orthologs are orthologs pairs that are not in any consecutive
ortholog set.

(3) CCV/CV-based phylogenetic distance
Gao et al. [45] used all the string appearance frequencies
(strings of length k) to represent each genome, that is,
each whole genome can be regarded as a high-dimension
vector, where each vector component is the frequency of a
particular combination of nucleotides (A, T, C, G). Then
the pairwise distance between two genomes can be calculated as the Euclidean distance between the corresponding
two vectors. Wu et al. [46] extended this idea to use all the
string appearance frequencies to define a CCV-based phylogenetic distance. In this distance, strings of length from
1 to k are all employed.
Phylogenetic inference
All of methods mentioned above, including composite
distance method, were used to generate a distance matrix
between all pairs of genomes. Phylogenetic trees were
then generated using the Neighbor-Joining [34,35] algo-

rithm in Phylip (version 3.67) [47] (likelihood based
approaches will be applied in future studies).
Performance measurement
There is no official standard for prokaryotic taxonomy.
However, it is widely believed by microbiologists that the
classification scheme in Bergey's Manual of Systematic
Bacteriology [1] is the best approximation available. To
measure the performances of a distance method, we calculated the percentage of agreed quartet topologies between
the tree created by the method and the tree from the
Bergey's taxonomy. A quartet topology is a subtree structure of the subset of 4 taxa (called a quartet). Given a quartet of taxa, a, b, c, and d, there are 3 possible ways to
connect the taxa as terminals (Figure 4). Note that, the tree
from Bergey's taxonomy is not a binary tree; therefore, one
node may have more than two children. As a result, some
of the quartets do not have any of the three quartet topol-

ogies in Figure 4. We call a quartet is resolved if no more
than three of taxa share the same parents. To measure the
performance of our method, we will collect agreed quartets in which the quartets have the same topology between
the tree from Bergey's taxonomy and a binary phylogenetic tree. The accuracy is percentage of the agreed quartets.

Results and discussion
Variance of orthlog definition
To test the robustness of our ortholog definition, different
variations of E-value cut-offs and sequence identities have
been selected for performance evaluation. Our results
showed that E-value cut-offs lower than 10-3 do not have
significant effects on the results. This is probably because
the reciprocal Blast hit process would ensure the majority
of the homolog selections as long as E-values are small
enough. However, different selections of percentage identities have some impacts on the performance. A very high
percentage identity would be too stringent to obtain
enough number of orthologs, while a very low percentage
identity would have too many false positive ortholog
pairs. We used dataset 9 as representative dataset,
described in the Method section, for testing orthologs
selection with E-value below 10–3 and percentage identities of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Accuracies of 76%, 82%,
89% and 85% were obtained using GDD method, respectively. Therefore, we selected the E-value cut-off at 10–3
and percentage identity of 30% for the optimal ortholog
definition.
Comparison to single gene trees
Although attempts to explain the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on the ssu-rRNA have been quite successful
[3,4], a well-known problem associated with this type of
single-gene approach is that the evolutionary history of
any single gene may differ from the phylogenetic history
of the whole organism from which the corresponding
molecule was isolated. We were able to obtain single-gene
phylogenetic trees of 13 bacterial species [51] for compar-

ing with our method. Figure 5 shows three different trees
based on single-gene selection and one tree based on the
whole-genome gene sets using our method. Using the
accuracy measurement described in the Method section,
accuracies of 88%, 81% and 83% are obtained for tree (a),
(b) and (c), respectively, while tree (d) based on the
whole-genome gene sets has a significantly higher accuracy of 91%. As an example, in tree (b) and (c), Salinnibacter rubber, which is a member of Bacteroidetes (B20), is
placed outside its own phylum towards the protebacteria
phylum (B12). In tree (d), Rhodopirellula baltica is placed
closer to phyla Bacteroidetes (B20) and Chlorobi (B11),
which is correct [52]. Huerta-Cepas et al. [53] found
degrees of topological variations among single-gene phylogenies were much greater than previously thought. Their
conclusions, although based on eukaryotes, may be applicable to the whole tree of life, and are probably even more
important to the prokaryote phylogeny given more LGTs
in prokaryotes.
Composite distance as optimal distance measurement
We used 9 datasets, described in the Method section, for
performance evaluations. In comparison to several other
phylogenetic analysis methods, our composite distance
method showed consistently better performance (see
Tables 2 and 3). We have achieved above 90% accuracy
comparing to Bergey's taxonomy system for all the
selected datasets.

Table 2 shows the performance results of 7 different combinations of three composite distance components using
the 9 datasets based on performance evaluation method
described in the Method section. Table 3 compares the
performances of 5 different methods including our proposed method. The accuracy is defined as the percentage
of agreed quartets between the tree created by a distance
method and the tree from the Bergey's taxonomy system.
Due to the complexity of obtaining accurate LGT events
and protein structural models for all the species to apply
the Structural Domain method on the genome distance
calculation, we could not obtain the genome phylogeny
trees for all the 9 datasets except dataset 9, whose result
can be directly downloaded from [31].
Results from Tables 2 and 3 suggest the optimal distance
calculation is the composite distance, which combines the
advantages of GDD, GCD and GBD. We use dataset 9 by
Deeds [31] for detailed discussion. Dataset 9 consists of 8
Archaea (A2) species, 1 Bacteria Aquificae (B1) species, 1
Bacteria Thermotogae (B2) species, 2 Bacteria Cyanobacteria (B10) species, 21 Bacteria Proteobacteria (B12) species, 15 Bacteria Firmicutes (B13) species, 5 Bacteria
Actinobacteria (B14) species, and 1 Bacteria Fusobacteria
(B21) species. In this dataset, Thermotoga maritima
(B2.1.1.1.1), a rod-shaped bacterium belongs to the order

Thermotogales, contains 1,877 predicted coding regions,
but it has only about 110 genes that have orthologs in the
genomes of other thermophilic Eubacteria and Archaea.
Completion of its genome has revealed a high degree of
similarity with Archaea in terms of contents of genes and
overall genome organization, where almost one quarter of
the genome is Archaea in nature, instead of other bacterial
phylum. Conservation of gene order between T. maritima
and the Archaea species in many of the clustered regions
suggests that LGT may have occurred between thermophilic Eubacteria and Archaea [36]. When classifying
this species, our composite distance method moves T.
maritima closer to the Archaea clade on the tree, which
reflects this biological property. In contrast, other methods, such as CCV method and overlapping gene method,
put T. maritima closer to either the Proteobacteria (B12)
clade or the Firmicutes (B13) clade on the phylogenetic
tree. Out of these three methods that do not model LGT
events specifically, the composite distance method still
demonstrates good sensitivity of the proposed composite
distance method.
By comparing different trees generated from different distance measures, we found that GDD and GBD are more

sensitive on deeper-lever of the trees. However, GCD is
more accurate on higher levels, such as clades of the tree.
For example, the gene content method puts five species of
Diplococci (class) of Fiemicutes (B13) together with its
neighboring class Bacilli of Fiemicutes, while GDD misclassifies those five species as members of the Proteobactria (B12) clade. As we can see from Table 2, by combining
all three distance components together as the composite
distance measure, the advantages of individual components are also combined together to achieve the optimal
results. Other methods, such as structural domain
method, position Archaea at a higher level phylum than
Bacteria phylum on the phylogeny tree, which contradicts
the taxonomy where they are at the parallel levels on the
tree. In contrast, our composite distance method is consistent with the taxonomy. A possible reason could be the
consideration of LGT events, as the structural domain
method overly emphasizes the role of LGT genes from
Archaea to Bacteria. The overlapping gene method however, has problem of using limited information to estimate the distance. Overlapping genes are conserved, but
they represent a small number of genes in the genome and
hence, the statistical errors may be large. This is shown by
mis-classifying Pyrococcus furiosus (A2.6.1.1.3) into clade

of Bacilli (B13), instead of Archaea (A2) using the overlapping gene method.
It is interesting to note that GBD method by itself performed poorly for large-scale comparison of prokaryote
genomes, which is in accordance with the commonly held
view that breakpoint methods lead to reliable results only
if the genomes are sufficiently co-linear, such as in datasets 5 and 6.
Efficiency comparison
Besides comparing the accuracies of different distance
measures, we also consider computational efficiency.
Most whole-genome phylogeny construction methods,
including ours, require a process of defining orthologs
through time-consuming BLAST. Assuming there are m
genomes and each genome has roughly ~n orthologs,
then the complexity for reciprocal BLAST hits in ortholog
identifications would be O(m2n2). Excluding this process,
our method, which computes in linear time, takes much
less computing time than other methods, especially the
breakpoint distance measure [18]. Structural domain
method, in another way, considers LGT events. It approximates the genome distance by continuously readjusting
the protein structural domain graph when applying each
LGT event (see the Method section for more details), and
the running time could easily take up to hours if not days
for a large genome data set. The CCV method, although
not requiring a process of defining orthologs, considers
every possible string of length up to k for whole genome
sequences. This method requires even higher computational resources in terms of memory and CPU cycles.
Overall, the composite distance measure shows not only
the higher accuracy but also fast speed.
Further discussion
Given pairs of prokaryotic species, there could be situations where one genome is essentially a subset of another
much larger genome. For example, in our datasets this is
true of Buchnera aphidicola genome, which is essentially a
subset of the Escherichia coli genome, with approximately

14% the size of it [49]. Shared genome sequences could
make two different genomes seem to be more closely
related than they actually are. We have tried to model this
case by modifying the GCD formula since this method
uses all the genes in genome pair as normalization factor,
not just the orthologs. We used the smaller genome gene
set size instead of summing two genome gene set sizes for
normalization. This modified formula would consider the
similar segments of genome at most once. However, the
performance of this modified GCD formula decreased significantly from around 85% to 60% for most of the datasets. Given that the situation where one genome is part of
another genome is rare, it appears that considering this in
our distance calculation lost the generality of the method.
Although all our trees would be generated as binary trees,
or phylograms, with two leaf species for each node and
they are hard to compare to the taxonomy, which is usually not binary, we find our results are consistent with
most of the taxonomy in Bergey's system based on the percentage of agreed quartet topologies. Nevertheless, we still
mis-classify some species on the tree. For example,
Treponema pallidum in class Spirochaetes (B17.1) is placed
as a sib of the class phylum Diplococci (B14.1), which
does not agree with current classifications. This may be
because the genome T. pallidum has high number of LGTs,
which is as high as 32.6% [37]. It would be hard for the
current method to deal with such an extreme. Other cases,
such as chimerical genomes [37] or paralogous genes, are
not modeled in this study, but could have misleading
effects on our classifications. Chimeric genomes, which
could have happened due to LGT, would produce false
lineage for the interested genomes. Paralogous genes
would artificially shorten the distance between two
genomes if there are many paralogs. Future developments
of the tool would include events of LGT, gene copy
number, and conservation of overlapping genes, as well as
exclude genes with abnormal evolution rates. We can see
that ComPhy provides a framework for incorporating
more relevant biological aspects for distance measurement.

Conclusion

References

ComPhy, a stand-alone phylogeny construction tool, provides a robust and easy-to-use tool for biologists. It does
not require multiple sequence alignment and is fully automated. ComPhy implements a composite distance
method, which does not depend on any type of evolution
models in calculating the distance between two genomes
besides the protein sequences and gene physical locations. It allows users to infer phylogenies for any set of
genomes of interest to study their evolutionary relationships by either generating a phylogram tree or a Newick
format tree file for further study. Although the tool is built
for complete-genome gene sets phylogeny, users can provide pre-defined ortholog sets to build the phylogeny
according their criteria. The process takes less than a
minute from given protein sequence files and protein
location files to the outputs of trees for hundreds of species if excluding the BLASTP for generating orthologs.
Although in the current stage of the application, our
method works only for species with single chromosome,
we will extend ComPhy to study eukaryotic genomes with
improved methods working on multi-chromosomes. We
believe this is a timely development as the whole-genome
phylogeny becomes dominant with the arrival of more
complete genome sequences, especially from the metagenomic analyses of microbial communities [38,39].
