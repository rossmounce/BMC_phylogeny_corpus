Abstract
Background: Increasing evidence from DNA sequence data has revealed that phylogenies based
on different genes may drastically differ from each other. This may be due to either inter- or
intralineage processes, or to methodological or stochastic errors. Here we investigate a
spectacular case where two parts of the same gene (SlX1/Y1) show conflicting phylogenies within
Silene (Caryophyllaceae). SlX1 and SlY1 are sex-linked genes on the sex chromosomes of dioecious
members of Silene sect. Elisanthe.
Results: We sequenced the homologues of the SlX1/Y1 genes in several Sileneae species. We
demonstrate that different parts of the SlX1/Y1 region give different phylogenetic signals. The major
discrepancy is that Silene vulgaris and S. sect. Conoimorpha (S. conica and relatives) exchange
positions. To determine whether gene duplication followed by recombination (an intralineage
process) may explain the phylogenetic conflict in the Silene SlX1/Y1 gene, we use a novel
probabilistic, multiple primer-pair PCR approach. We did not find any evidence supporting gene
duplication/loss as explanation to the phylogenetic conflict.
Conclusion: The phylogenetic conflict in the Silene SlX1/Y1 gene cannot be explained by paralogy
or artefacts, such as in vitro recombination during PCR. The support for the conflict is strong
enough to exclude methodological or stochastic errors as likely sources. Instead, the phylogenetic
incongruence may have been caused by recombination of two divergent alleles following ancient
interspecific hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. These events probably took place several
million years ago. This example clearly demonstrates that different parts of the genome may have
different evolutionary histories and stresses the importance of using multiple genes in
reconstruction of taxonomic relationships.

Background
One of the challenges of evolutionary biology is phylogeny reconstruction. Modern techniques have facilitated
the use of DNA sequences as the primary source of phylo-

genetic data. Usually, only small fractions of the genome
are analyzed. In systematic research, such regions are
often assumed to reflect the organismal lineage ("species") phylogeny. In principle, however, the resulting phy-

logenies do not reflect the history of the species, but rather
the history of the individual DNA regions themselves (e.g.
[1]). These regions may have different evolutionary histories, which can lead to presence of several conflicting gene
phylogenies. Taken together, these phylogenies can give
clues to the organismal phylogeny (e.g. [2]). Incongruent
gene phylogenies may have different causes, e.g. introgression (e.g. [3,4]), homo- or polyploid hybridization (e.g.
[5,6]), mistaken orthology due to gene duplications and
losses [7], or incomplete lineage sorting of alleles [8]. In
fact, coalescence theory predicts that in some cases, the
most probable gene tree will not even reflect the species
tree [9,10], and this has also been shown in simulation
studies using coalescent models on concatenated data
[11].
In order to understand how gene phylogenies relate to
organismal phylogenies, it is important to obtain
sequence data from different parts of the genomes
[12,13]. Plant molecular phylogenetics has heavily utilized chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA)
data, whereas other parts of the nuclear genome, as well as
the mitochondrial genome, are much less utilized. To differentiate between different causes of gene tree discordances, the use of multiple, potentially unlinked low-copy
gene regions is desirable (e.g. [12-15]).

a)

If sampling of a multi-copy gene family is poor, paralogues may be misidentified as orthologues [7]. Paralogy
problems may, however, exist even if entire genome
sequences are at hand, if paralogues have gone extinct
haphazardly in different lineages [16]. To complicate matters even further, members of a multi-copy gene family,
and also alleles of the same gene, may recombine and
make phylogenetic analysis difficult [7]. Paradoxically,
this property has facilitated the use of nrDNA sequences,
since cistrons from this gene family often are present in
very large tandemly repeated numbers. These copies are
usually very similar due to the process of concerted evolution, operating by e.g. unequal crossing over and gene
conversion (e.g. [17,18]).
To distinguish intralineage processes such as gene duplications from interlineage processes (e.g. hybridization)
causing tree discordances, we are mainly interested in
gene copies at three different levels. We follow the terminology of [19] and use the term "inparalogues" for genes
resulting from duplications within terminal taxa/lineages
(Figure 1a). Duplications that occur along the internal
branches of the ingroup species tree will be referred to as
"recent outparalogues" (Figure 1c, cf. [19]). Genes that
have duplicated before the origin of the group of interest
will be referred to as "ancient outparalogues" (Figure 1b).

"Sequence copies" or "sequence variants" means any kind
of alleles, paralogues or orthologues that are similar
enough to be aligned with each other.
In organisms where complete genome sequences are not
available, paralogy determination has to be considered by
heuristic methods. A classical method to find paralogues
is to use Southern blot hybridization [20]. A drawback of
this method is that it only gives a number of bands able to
hybridize with the probe under specific conditions. It
does not reveal the actual sequences, which makes it
impossible to make any detailed assertions about the
homology status of the different bands detected.
Another way to examine paralogues is to use a phylogenetic approach to sort out the different copies of the gene.
This has been applied to genomes with complete
sequence data (e.g. [21]). To deal with genomes with
incomplete sequence information, Small & al. [15] suggested a combination of PCR-mediated sequencing,
Southern blots, and expression studies. They argue that
the sequence-based approach is the weakest and that especially Southern blots can be used to strengthen orthology
assessment. However, they did not consider using multiple PCR primer pairs to amplify several overlapping DNA
fragments instead of amplifying one single fragment.
While the combination of the approaches certainly is
powerful, we think that there is room for improvement of
the PCR-mediated approach. In principle, multiple PCR
primers could be used with essentially the same coverage
as constructed hybridization probes, but with the difference of being more sensitive and, most importantly, giving access to the actual sequences and thus to
sophisticated phylogenetic analyses. A major advantage
here is that gene trees derived from sequence data provide
a possibility to assess the detailed paralogy status (in- or
outparalogues of different relative ages) of multiple
sequence copies. A weakness of the PCR method, however, is that some sequence copies may be preferred in the
amplification (PCR bias, e.g. [22]). Using multiple primer
pairs along the sequence might alleviate this problem to
some extent, but if these primers were designed from a
single sequence, they will on average be biased towards
sequences that are similar to the template sequence. To
circumvent this problem, one can design primers placed
in more conserved parts of the sequence. Obviously, this
requires some knowledge of the sequence diversity
present. Although difficult to quantify exactly, PCR bias
will decrease and the possibility to find paralogues will
increase with the number of independent PCR primer
pairs used.
To assess the efficiency of a multiple PCR-primer method,
we use a probabilistic approach. Under the assumption

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/299

that different primer pairs are independent and that they
do not, on average, preferentially prefer some copies to
others, we can calculate the probability that all sequence
copies have been detected with these primer pairs.
In order to use nuclear genes in phylogenetic analyses
when entire genome sequence information is not at hand,
it is often necessary to develop protocols that are specific
for the plant group in question [14]. Popp & Oxelman
[13] developed a protocol to use RNA polymerase genes
in phylogenies, which has been successfully used in subsequent Sileneae (Caryophyllaceae) studies to reveal a
number of conflicting gene trees ([5,23], unpublished
data). Here, we test the utility of another low-copy nuclear
gene, SlX1/SlY1. SlY1 is a sex-linked gene described from
the Y chromosome of Silene latifolia Poir., a dioecious
member of Silene sect. Elisanthe (Fenzl ex Endl.) Ledeb.
[24]. SlX1 is a closely related gene, located on the X chromosome [24,25]. There are also homologues in the other
dioecious species in Elisanthe [26,27] and on the autosomes in non-dioecious taxa [26-29]. The region is hereafter called "XY1". An initial Southern blot study
suggested that there may be several paralogues of XY1
[24], but in later PCR-based studies, only a single XY1
copy has been found [28,29].
Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of XY1 sequences indicated that different parts of the gene give rise to conflicting
Silene phylogenies. These conflicts mainly involved the
relationships between a few distinct lineages: Silene sections Elisanthe and Conoimorpha and some of their relatives in Silene subgenus Behenantha (Otth) Endl. (=
subgenus Behen sensu e.g. [13]). The dioecious species in
sect. Elisanthe (S. latifolia, S. dioica (L.) Clairv., S. diclinis
(Lag.) Lainz, S. heuffelii Soó, S. marizii Samp.) are characterized by sexual dimorphism and sex chromosomes. Previous studies indicate a close relationship between the
dioecious species in Silene sect. Elisanthe and the members
of Silene sect. Conoimorpha Otth [30-34], The members of
the Conoimorpha group all have calyces with several (up to
60) prominent parallel nerves. Silene vulgaris (Moench)
Garcke represents a group of species having strongly
inflated calyces with reticulate nerves. They appear closely
related to the annual S. behen L. (with which it share some
morphological characteristics) and also to S. pendula L.
[30,33].
The aim of this study is to investigate the historical explanation to a case where different parts of a gene (XY1) give
rise to conflicting phylogenies within Silene. To investigate
whether gene duplication/loss may be a plausible explanation we present a novel probabilistic PCR approach to
determine the number of sequence variants present in an
organism.

Results
Number of sequence variants
In S. conica L., S. conoidea L. and S. pendula only one XY1
sequence variant was found (see Table 1 for voucher information). In S. acaulis L. two variants were found and in S.
nutans L. and S. vulgaris three variants were found (Table
2). Using our novel approach to calculate the posterior
probability that the actual number of sequence variants is
the observed number (achieved from different independent, partially overlapping PCR products, and using a discrete uniform distribution as prior), we found that for all
species except S. nutans, the posterior probability is > 0.99
that there are no more undetected variants (Table 2. See
Methods for explanation and formula). The divergence
between the variants within an individual was always less
than the divergence between sequences from different
species (Table 2). The entire alignment of the XY1 region
contained 6416 bp and 361 indel characters. The reduced
9-taxon alignment, where parts with large amounts of
missing data (due to long indels or unsequenced regions)
in many sequences were excluded, contained 4045 bp.

Conflicting phylogenetic signals in different parts of the
alignment
The GARD recombination detection screening suggested
several recombination breakpoints in the reduced 4045bp alignment, resulting in two larger non-recombinant
partitions in the alignment. The central part of the alignment was divided into a few short partitions by additional
recombination breakpoints. Different analysis settings
resulted in variation in the number and placement of
breakpoints. The positions of the outermost breakpoints,
however, differed only slightly: directly before exon 8 and
in the intron between exons 9 and 10 (Figure 2, Figure 3,
Table 3). The main differences between the partitions
(hereafter referred to as the 5' and 3' parts, respectively)
are that S. vulgaris and S. conica change places in the position closest to the dioecious species S. latifolia and S. dioica
(Figure 3).
Bayesian phylogenies
Applying Bayesian phylogenetic methods to the partitions
suggested by GARD on the full 6416 bp alignment with
more taxa (Figure 4) resulted in trees compatible to the

Neighbor-Joining trees from GARD. In the three cases (S.
acaulis, S. nutans, S. vulgaris) where there were more than
one sequence variant per individual, these were always
monophyletic within the species (inparalogues). Silene
conica and S. conoidea, representing sect. Conoimorpha,
grouped together with strong support (Figure 4). Also S.
dioica and S. latifolia constituted a well-supported group
(dioecious Elisanthe) in both partitions (Figure 4). Silene
noctiflora L., the type species of sect.Elisanthe [35], did not
form a monophyletic group with the dioecious species
(Figure 4).

In the 5' part of the alignment S. vulgaris grouped together
with S. noctiflora as a sister-group to the dioecious species
in sect. Elisanthe. This whole clade (II) was sister to a clade
with the Conoimorpha group and S. pendula (Figure 4a). In
the 3' part of the alignment, sect. Conoimorpha grouped
together with S. noctiflora as the closest relatives (VI) to the
dioecious Elisanthe. Silene vulgaris grouped with S. pendula
(Figure 4b).
The ages of the nodes including S. vulgaris and its closest
relatives were 5.1 million years in the 5' part (split with S.
noctiflora), and 5.0 million years in the 3' part for the split

Phylogenies based on different parts of the XY1 region
Phylogenies based on different parts of the XY1 region. Bayesian consensus chronograms for the 5' (a) and 3' parts (b)
of the 6416 bp XY1 alignment. The partitions in a) and b) represent non-recombinant parts that were suggested by GARD
from a reduced 9-sequence 4045 bp alignment of the XY1 gene. Values below branches are median ages in million years. Numbers above branches are posterior probabilities (PP)/maximum parsimony bootstrap (MPB) support values for the same alignment but with additional indel characters (values of PP < 0.70 and MPB < 60% are not shown). Hyphens (-) indicate nodes with
high posterior probabilities that were not present in the MPB trees. Note that the MBP trees are unrooted, and there is thus
only a single internal branch connecting the clades where the BEAST root (*) appears. Horizontal bars represent 95% HPD age
intervals. Roman numbers are used to label nodes. Note how the positions of the groups sect. Conoimorpha (C) and S. vulgaris
(V) change in the different partitions.

phylogeny in agreement with those obtained by the
nuclear ribosomal DNA region ITS [30-32] and the lowcopy nuclear genes RPA2, RPB2 and the RPD2a gene (Rautenberg & Oxelman, unpublished data). Also chloroplast
DNA rps16 [33] and a large chloroplast DNA data set [34]
show agreeing phylogenies. In contrast, the first 2.7 kbp of
the alignment gives an unexpected phylogeny, where S.
vulgaris is placed closely related to the dioecious Elisanthe
species. This deviating phylogenetic pattern was also
recently found in the RPD2b gene (Rautenberg & Oxelman, unpublished data). The results from the XY1 gene
agree with previous studies that have shown that S. noctiflora does not belong with the dioecious species in Silene
sect. Elisanthe [30-33,36].
Conflicts between separate phylogenies based on different
genes can be observed on several genomic levels: when
comparing phylogenies based on different genomes (e.g.
organellar vs. nuclear), different genes or different copies
of a gene (either alleles or paralogues), or even different
parts of one gene. These conflicting phylogenies can either
reflect complex phylogenetic patterns (e.g. [7,23]), or simply highlight errors and problems in lab procedures and/
or phylogenetic methods. We will here discuss possible
causes of the observed phylogenetic conflict.
Lab errors and artefacts
• Contamination or mix-up of extractions, PCR samples or
sequence reactions: The sequences are verified by multiple
accessions of the species, and multiple PCR and sequence
reactions. The data set also includes sequences made in
different laboratories from different source plants. Thus,
this possibility can be safely rejected.

• Recombination between paralogues or alleles during PCR:
Paralogous gene copies or alleles can recombine during
PCR (e.g. [37-39]). This process could create a pattern like
the observed one, if our sequencing reactions would have
been based on single PCR products of the entire gene.
However, our PCR products include several overlapping
fragments, 700–2500 bp long.
• Inconsistent alignment procedures in separate parts of the
alignment could also influence the accurateness of the
resulting phylogeny. This explanation is also unlikely,
because the included alignment appears unproblematic.
Two 700 bp parts of the alignment with much indel variation were excluded in the reduced alignment used in the
GARD analysis.
• Inappropriate phylogenetic methods or sampling errors:
Choosing the wrong phylogenetic method is a potential
cause of inconsistent phylogenies. In this study, we used
distance methods, Bayesian methods and parsimony
methods for phylogeny reconstruction. The same general

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/299

pattern was found with all methods. The different methods applied here have very different theories and potential
problems [40], and in addition, the bootstrap support values and the posterior probabilities are high. Therefore, we
argue that the observed pattern is not likely to have been
caused by inappropriate methodologies. The high support
values also make stochastic errors (i.e. unfortunate sampling of substitution patterns along the sequence alignment) an unlikely explanation.
Biological explanations
• Existence of paralogues: If a gene duplicates within a lineage, each of the resulting paralogues will have its own evolutionary fate. Difficulties in orthology determination can
seriously distort phylogenies and conclusions drawn from
them. Two processes are potentially serious when inferring organismal phylogenies from multi-copy sequences.
First, in vivo recombination between the gene copies may
give rise to mosaic sequences, which can give inconsistent
phylogenies, where different parts of the alignment will
reflect conflicting topologies. Second, there is a risk that
orthology is mistaken in the phylogenetic analysis if some
of the existing outparalogues are not detected, or if some
of the paralogues are lost in some lineages. The phylogeny
will then be influenced by which copy is lost (or not
detected) in which lineage [16]. On the other hand, inparalogues (gene copies that are monophyletic within an
individual) will not cause such problems (Figure 1a).
Ancient gene duplications (earlier than the divergence of
the studied organismal group) followed by haphazard
losses will lead to a pattern with some parts of the ingroup
grouping with the outgroup (i.e. the ingroup will appear
non-monophyletic, Figure 1b). This effect will, under the
assumption that the in- and outgroups are correctly circumscribed, indicate that there is a paralogy problem.
Thus, only recent outparalogues, i.e. genes that have
duplicated after the divergence of the ingroup, but before
the origin of the terminal taxa (leaves), are of serious concern for orthology/paralogy interpretation in our case
(Figure 1c).

Recombination between two or more paralogues could
certainly create a pattern like the one we observe. Results
from Southern blot hybridization experiments made by
Delichère & al. [24] suggest that there may be one or more
copies of SlX1/SlY1 on the chromosomes of S. latifolia. It
is unknown whether these extra copies are inparalogues,
recent outparalogues, or if their origins are more ancient
than the origin of Silene (ancient outparalogues). In S.
conica, the gene orthologous to SlX1/SlY1 seem to be single copy according to our results and those of Atanassov &
al. [29]. RT-PCR experiments by Nicolas & al. [27] also
revealed only one sequence in all dioecious species analyzed. The within-species sequence variation we observed
in S. vulgaris, S. acaulis and S. nutans is possibly caused by

Page 8 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:299

allele variation and/or recent gene duplication, resulting
in inparalogues. A natural explanation to the multiple
bands detected in some of the Southern blots experiments
[24] might therefore be ancient outparalogues that
diverged before the diversification of Silene, or other genes
with a similar sequence. However, an alternative explanation might be that they represent silent pseudogenes that
have diverged so much that our PCR experiments have
failed to target them. Although not an impossible explanation, we consider this to be unlikely, given the large
number of different PCR primer pairs used by us on taxa
representing various major lineages in Silene and given the
high posterior probabilities from the statistical calculations. Note however that relaxation of selective constraints in pseudogenes may result in elevated
substitution and indel rates, resulting in violation of the
assumption of non-biased targeting of the primers constructed from an alignment of apparently functional gene
sequences.
• Incomplete lineage sorting: In recently diverged lineages,
the alleles from the ancestral gene pool might not yet have
become sorted into the new lineages. One way to reject
incomplete lineage sorting as a possible cause of incongruence could be to compare the divergence times of the
conflicting nodes. Assuming that one of the trees does
reflect the organismal tree, lineage sorting can be rejected
if the divergence time of the organismal tree node is older
than in the deviating tree. If we consider the tree from the
3' part of XY1 to be the most likely organism tree (as is
supported by other data, see above), we cannot reject
incomplete lineage sorting because the ages are very similar (node IX versus node III, Figure 4) or considerably
younger (node VIII versus node V, Figure 4). However, the
95% HPD intervals for the relevant nodes overlap largely
(Figure 4), and we lack a robust hypothesis about dating
of splits in the species tree. It is therefore not possible
either to reject or corroborate incomplete lineage sorting
as the cause of the observed incongruence.
• Horizontal gene transfer: Recently, horizontal (or lateral)
gene transfer in plants has been reported (reviewed in
[41]). Most of these cases are mitochondrial genes that
seem to be transferred between isolated lineages, but two
examples of horizontal transfer of nuclear genes have also
been suggested [42,43]. Although we cannot rule out horizontal gene transfer completely, we do not have a reasonable explanation on the mechanisms and series of events
that could create the observed pattern.
• Hybridization also creates patterns where different parts
of the hybrid's genome reflect relationships with the different parental taxa. If the hybridization is a success, genes
or alleles with separate evolutionary histories will become
introduced into the offspring. Through repeated back-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/299

crossing with one of the parental lineages, only a minority
of the other lineage's genes will prevail ("introgression")
and the resulting pattern will mimic horizontal gene
transfer.
For a hybridization event to be a favourable explanation
when groups exchange positions between two trees, the
age of the split disagreeing with the species tree should be
younger than in the species tree [23]. If we assume that the
3' part of the XY1 alignment reflects the organism tree (as
is corroborated by other data), the hybridization explanation is not supported if the ages of nodes VIII and V are
taken at face value (Figure 4b). The 95% HPD intervals for
the nodes are broad, however, so hybridization cannot be
rejected. Nodes IX and III have very similar median ages,
making the discrimination between hybridization and
intralineage processes even more obscure. Denser taxon
sampling could possibly narrow the HPD intervals.
There are no morphological characters suggesting that
hybridization has taken place. On the other hand, this
putative event probably lies several million years back,
and given the rampant morphological homoplasy in
Silene in general, this is perhaps not surprising.
An enigmatic feature of the phylogenetic results is that the
lineages of S. vulgaris and the Conoimorpha group appear
to mutually switch positions in the trees. There is no reason to expect that recombination should take place at the
same sequence location in different lineages, either under
a paralogy or under a hybridization hypothesis. However,
the taxonomic sampling is sparse, and further sampling
might reveal that the phylogenetic positions are not mutually exchanged. The fact that GARD actually supports several recombination events may indicate sequential events,
rather than a reciprocal switch.
Lychnis flos-jovis appears within Silene in our trees (Figure
4). The phylogenetic status of Lychnis in relation to Silene
is not strongly supported [32], but recent studies (e.g.
[13]) have rather corroborated the sister-group relationship between the two. However, other data (e.g. [23,34])
also indicate complicated patterns that may involve reticulations. Here, we follow Oxelman & al's [32] generic classification of the tribe Sileneae, but the purpose of this
paper is not to draw any taxonomic conclusions.
A difficulty when working with organisms where the
entire genomic sequences are not known is to estimate
confidence in whether the number of sequence variants
(alleles, paralogues) detected does reflect all variation
within the organism. Joly & al. [44] used a binomial distribution to calculate the number of clones from a PCR
product that had to be sequenced to achieve a certain
probability of sampling all alleles in a tetraploid individ-

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:299

ual (given that the primer pair picks all variants). Since the
binomial distribution assumes the events of finding an
allele to be independent we argue that a Bayesian
approach is more appropriate. The methods appear to
give similar results, however. Our approach has the
advantage that the total number of sequence copies does
not need to be known. Also, replicating the number of
independent PCR primer pairs decreases the risk of PCR
bias.

Conclusion
There is a phylogenetic conflict in different parts of the
Silene SlX1/Y1 gene that cannot be explained by gene
duplications/losses or artefacts, such as in vitro recombination during PCR. This phylogenetic incongruence may
have been caused by recombination of two divergent alleles following horizontal gene transfer, interspecific
hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. Given our
results of the relative dating, we can reject neither of these
hypotheses. However, the fact that we recently discovered
a phylogenetic pattern similar to that from the first part of
the XY1 alignment also in the RPD2b gene (unpublished
data) can be interpreted as support for the hybridization/
introgression hypothesis.
Our novel probabilistic PCR approach, in combination
with phylogenetic methods, provides a useful way to discriminate between different paralogue types and to determine the number of outparalogues in a genome, when the
entire genomic sequence is not known.
This example clearly demonstrates that different parts of
the genome may tell us different stories and stresses the
importance of using multiple genes in reconstruction of
taxonomic relationships.

Methods
Taxa
Six specimens representing various phylogenetic lineages
in Sileneae (Table 1) were screened for XY1 sequences
using PCR outlined below. In addition, GenBank
sequences, including several representatives of Silene sect.
Elisanthe were used (Table 1). Taxa were chosen to mostly
include representatives from Silene subgenus Behenantha.
Lychnis flos-jovis (L.) Desr. and representatives from Silene
subgenus Silene were used as outgroups [13,31,33]. All
included taxa are diploid [45,46]. Genus names follow
the generic classification of Sileneae by Oxelman & al.
[32].
DNA isolation
Isolation of total genomic DNA was performed from herbarium specimens or fresh material using a modified Carlson/Yoon method [31]. Most DNA isolations were
purified by the GFX Purification Kit (Amersham Bio-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/299

sciences) and dissolved in EB buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH
8.5, QiaGen). Some were purified by the Ultra Silica Bead
Kit (ABgene).
Primers and PCR
Primers for the XY1 region were designed to amplify several partially overlapping fragments of XY1 (Figure 2). A
preliminary alignment with several Silene taxa (GenBank
accessions in Table 1 and 10 unpublished sequences with
similar sequence diversity as the sequences used in the
analyses) was used to get the initial primer sequences. The
primers were aimed to work on all of the XY1 variants.
Most primers were positioned in exons (Figure 2, Table 4).
Details on PCR conditions can be obtained from the first
author on request.
Specific primers
When the sequences were polymorphic due to indel polymorphisms, specific primers were designed, either directly
from the sequenced PCR products, or from cloned
sequences. These new primers were used in later PCR (in
a few cases) and for direct sequencing of the polymorphic
PCR products.
Sequencing
Purified PCR products were sent to Macrogen Inc. in
Seoul, South Korea for sequencing (using the BigDyeTM
terminator kit and run on ABI 3730XL). Some sequence
reactions were run on an ABI 3700 sequencer at Rudbeck
lab, Uppsala University, Sweden. Sequencing reactions
were in this case carried out using the BigDye 3.1 kit.

Cloning
In some taxa, cloning of PCR products was performed to
overcome problems with indel polymorphisms. The PCR
fragments were obtained by Taq (ABgene), and were
cloned using TOPO TA cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen), with half the recommended reaction volumes.
From each cloning reaction, 7–13 colonies were picked
for PCR using the universal primers M13F and M13R.
Purified PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen Inc.
using the universal primers T3 and T7promoter available
at Macrogen Inc. and otherwise as above. Mostly, the
cloned sequences were only used as a base for subsequent
primer design, but in some cases the actual sequences
were also used in the alignment. Single base polymorphisms that occurred only in single clones were considered as PCR artefacts and discarded from subsequent
analyses.
Assembly and alignment
The Staden package version 1.6.0 for Mac OS X [47] with
phred version 0.020425.c and phrap version 0.990319
[48] was used to assemble readings into contigs. In some
cases manual editing of the contigs was made. Base polymorphisms were coded using the NC-IUPAC ambiguity
codes.

The resulting contig sequences were aligned manually
using QuickAlign [49], using the criteria of Popp & Oxelman [13]. The sequences were trimmed to reduce the
number of taxa with long stretches of missing data in the
beginning and end. Parts of the introns between exons 8/
9 and 12/13 were very variable, with long indels in many
sequences.
Gap coding
Simple gap coding [50], as implemented in SeqState version 1.36, build 19.10.2007 [51], was applied to the complete alignment.
Determination of number of sequence copies
We used a Bayesian approach to calculate the probability
that we sampled all sequence copies. Let x be the number
of sequence variants in the genome. Each PCR primer pair
combination amplifies one or more sequence variants.
Assuming that there is no PCR bias, the probability of
sampling sequence copies will be analogous to the probability of drawing balls from a big bowl containing balls
with an unknown number of different colours (x).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/299

as

(1 / x) n
∑ x′≤ x obs (1 / x′)

n

, where xobs is the observed number of

colours. The number of ball draws (n) needed for the posterior probability of x = xobs to be larger than 0.95 is given
in Table 5. For the mathematical arguments, see Additional file 1. Thus, by representing PCR primer pair combinations with balls and using colours to represent
paralogues, we can obtain an estimate of whether it is
improbable that additional PCR primer pairs will detect
additional paralogues in the genome. Cases when one
primer pair results in two or more sequences will be interpreted as a draw that accidentally results in more than one
ball. Note that the assumptions are that the sequences of
the primer pairs are unbiased with respect to the population of sequence variants in the genome (no PCR bias).
We define this population by the preliminary alignment,
taken to represent the phylogenetic diversity in Silene.
Thus, we regard sequences outside of this population as
ancient outparalogues, i.e. they are not "balls". We regard
this procedure as sufficient to justify the assumption that
the ability of the primer pairs to amplify recent outparalogues will not, on average, be biased. Even if this assumption is overly simplistic and almost certainly violated, we
think that the PCR approach employed here, with the
probabilities given in Table 5, provides a useful framework for determination of the number of paralogues in a
genome, when the entire genomic sequence is not known.
Recombination detection
To screen for putative recombination breakpoints, GARD
(Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection) [52] was
used online [53]. Due to computational limitations, a
reduced alignment was analysed. In this reduced data set,
only nine sequences were analysed and parts of the alignment with much missing data (first 870 bp and last 200
bp) were excluded. The XY1 introns between exons 8/9
and 12/13 were very variable in length between taxa and
large parts (≈700 bp each) of these introns were also
excluded (Figure 2). We used the GARD detection method
using HKY85 nucleotide substitution bias model (as suggested by the model selection tool on the GARD web page

[53]), with Beta-Gamma rate variation and 5 rate classes.
We also tried 3–4 rate classes, and the General Discrete
Distribution, with similar results not affecting the conclusions.
Bayesian analysis
BEAST v1.4.7 [54] was used for Bayesian phylogenetic
inference and dating of divergence times. Input files for
BEAST were created with BEAUti v1.4.7 [54], using a
relaxed clock model [55], with a Yule prior and the nucleotide substitution models proposed by MrModeltest version 2.2 [56], using the Akaike information criterion. A
prior on the age of the root of the tree was set to 12.57 million years, with a normally distributed standard deviation
of 2.018 [23]. Two MCMC chains were run for 10 million
generations with trees and parameter values saved every
1000th generation. One of the chains had no constraints
on the monophyly of the included groups, in the other
chain three groups of interest were forced to be monophyletic: subgenus Silene, subgenus Behenantha (including
L. flos-jovis) and the dioecious species of section Elisanthe
(nested within subgenus Behenantha). There were no substantial differences between the two MCMC chains, except
for the age of subgenus Behenantha. For this group, the priors had a strong impact on the results, especially when the
monophyly constraints were in effect. The resulting log
files were checked in Tracer v1.4 [57], and the tree files
were summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.4.7 [54] into
one Maximum credibility tree with median node heights
(discarding the first 10% of the trees as "burn-in"). Trees
were visualized using FigTree 1.1.2 [58].
Parsimony analysis
Maximum parsimony analyses and maximum parsimony
bootstrap support measures were performed with PAUP*
v.4.0b10 for Unix [59] on the complete alignment with
gap coding, as well as the reduced data matrix, with the
data sets partitioned into the non-recombined 5' and 3'
parts from the GARD recombination detection procedure.
Maximum parsimony analyses were carried out using heuristic search with TBR branch swapping, multrees option
in effect, and 10 random addition sequences. For bootstrap support, 1000 replicates were performed, with the
multrees option off.
Sequence divergence
Distances between the sequences were calculated using
MEGA4 [60]. In addition to the pairwise distances
between all sequences (data not shown), mean distances
between sequence copies within an individual and mean
distances between sequences from different individuals/
taxa were also calculated. Divergence estimates are
Tamura-Nei distances with Γ = 0.6587 and ± standard
error (SE), based on 500 bootstrap replicates.
