Abstract
Ticks act as vectors of many pathogens of domestic animals and humans. Anaplasma phagocytophilum in Europe is
transmitted by the ixodid tick vector Ixodes ricinus. A. phagocytophilum causes a disease with diverse clinical signs in
various hosts. A great genetic diversity of the groESL operon of A. phagocytophilum has been found in ticks elsewhere.
In Slovenia, the variety of the groESL operon was conducted only on deer samples. In this study, the prevalence of
infected ticks was estimated and the diversity of A. phagocytophilum was evaluated. On 8 locations in Slovenia, 1924
and 5049 (6973) I. ricinus ticks were collected from vegetation in the years 2005 and 2006, respectively. All three feeding
stages of the tick’s life cycle were examined. The prevalence of ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum in the year 2005
and in the year 2006 was 0.31% and 0.63%, respectively, and it did not differ considerably between locations. The similarity among the sequences of groESL ranged from 95.6% to 99.8%. They clustered in two genetic lineages along with
A. phagocytophilum from Slovenian deer. One sequence formed a separate cluster. According to our study, the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in ticks is comparable to the findings in other studies in Europe, and it does not vary
considerably between locations and tick stages. According to groESL operon analysis, two genetic lineages have been
confirmed and one proposed. Further studies on other genes would be useful to obtain more information on genetic
diversity of A. phagocytophilum in ticks in Slovenia.
Findings
Ticks and tick-borne diseases affect animal and human
health worldwide. A vector of many diseases in Europe
and Slovenia is Ixodes ricinus [1]. It can be found in the
forest, in shrubby or wooded pastures and on surfaces
with low vegetation [2]. Ticks’ feeding cycle includes
three stages: larva, nymph and adult. I. ricinus feeds on
livestock, deer, dogs and a wide variety of other species,
including humans [2]. I. ricinus is a confirmed vector of
the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum [3]. The tick
becomes infected as it feeds on an infected host. Anaplasmae are transmitted from stage to stage as the tick
moults (trans-stadially), but not transovarially. No anaplasmae have been detected in unfed larvae so far [4].
A. phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic anaplasmosis, was formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent (HGE agent), Ehrlichia phagocytophila and
E. equi [5]. A. phagocytophilum causes a disease with
diverse clinical signs in various hosts from asymptomatic
to life-threatening [4]. No fatal infection in humans has
been documented in Europe so far. On the contrary, in

the USA, the fatality rate in humans is 1% [4]. Important reservoir hosts of the bacterium are small mammals
and deer. Humans, dogs, horses represent accidental
hosts [4]. The wild boar is suggested as a reservoir host
for a variant that infects humans [6]. The prevalence of
infected ticks in Europe ranges from 0.4% - 66.7% [7].
To describe the diversity of A. phagocytophilum, the
groESL operon is widely used as the 16 S rRNA gene is
too conservative [8]. It has been shown that, based on
this operon, anaplasmae among deer in Slovenia cluster
in two genetic lineages [9]. An immense diversity of
groESL sequences of A. phagocytophilum in ticks has
also been described in Germany [10]. The variants
matched to the sequences found in a German and a
Swedish horse and in a Slovenian patient [10]. In a previous study in Slovenia, the estimated prevalence of
infected ticks from one location was 3.2% [11]. The
ticks in the present study were being collected every
month for two years from several locations. The prevalence of ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum was estimated and the diversity of the groESL operon of
detected DNA of A. phagocytophilum was evaluated.
The study was performed in the years 2005 and 2006 at
8 locations in Slovenia. The criteria for selecting the locations were the tick-borne pathogens’ presence in human

patients or a higher altitude of the location compared to
others. Ticks were collected at forest edges by dragging a
flag with a surface of 1 m2 over 100 m of vegetation [1].
Every 2.5 m, the flag was examined for ticks. The species,
stage and sex of ticks were determined by a professional
entomologist. Ticks were decontaminated in 70% ethanol
and sterile double distilled water and pooled in groups of
30 larvae, 10 nymphs or 5 adults. Adult ticks were first
cut in half and a half of each adult tick was used for pooling. The remaining half of the dissected adult tick was
frozen and stored separately. Pools of ticks were stored at
-20°C until further analysis. The pooled samples were
used for DNA extraction. First, they were homogenized
using TissueLyser (Retsch for Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
DNA was extracted with BioSprint 15 DNA Blood Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). To assess the efficiency of DNA
extraction, tick mitochondrial 16 S rRNA was examined
[12]. For the initial screening of samples, primer pair
Ehr521 and Ehr790, specific for the 16 S rRNA of genus
Anaplasma sp. and Ehrlichia sp., was used [11]. All positive samples were additionally tested for the groESL
operon. A nested PCR would amplify a 1296-bp fragment
of groESL operon of A. phagocytophilum variants [8].
A. phagocytophilum, grown in a HL-60 cell culture, was
used as a PCR positive control. If a pool of adult ticks
was positive, the stored half of each dissected tick from a
pool was used for DNA extraction and further amplifications. All amplicons of groESL operon were further
analyzed by sequencing on both strands with the BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The
sequences were analyzed with computer programs of the
Lasergene 1999 software package (DNASTAR, Madison,
WI, USA) based on Clustal W algorithm [13]. The distance matrices were calculated using Kimura two-parameter method 1980 [14] and the Neighbor-joining
method [15] was used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree with TreeCon software (Yves Van de Peer,
Department of Biochemistry, University of Antwerp,
Antwerpen, Belgium). The stability of inferred topology
was assessed with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The prevalence of infection was calculated using the program PooledInfRate version 3.0 (a Microsoft® Excel Add-In,
developed by Brad Biggerstaff, CDC, Fort Collins, CO).
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). P values of 0.05 or less
were considered statistically significant.
On 8 locations in Slovenia, 1924 and 5049 (6973)
I. ricinus ticks were collected by flagging vegetation in
the years 2005 and 2006, respectively. Ticks were separated into pools: 252 pools in 2005 and 442 pools in 2006
(Table 1). At the location of Murska Šuma, other tick
species were collected, namely Dermacentor reticulatus

Page 2 of 5

and Haemaphysalis concinna. As A. phagocytophilum is
transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks [16], only I. ricinus was
examined.
The 16 S rRNA of Anaplasma sp. was detected in 26
pools of adult and nymphal stages of ticks (Table 1).
None of the pool of larvae were positive in the year
2005, and were not tested in the year 2006 as A. phagocytophilum is not transovarially transmitted in ticks
(Table 1). One adult tick from each pool was positive.
The prevalence of infection in the year 2005 and in the
year 2006 was 0.31% and 0.63%, respectively (Table 1).
No statistically significant differences were found
between the prevalences at various locations and in both
years (p > 0.05).
The sequences of 26 PCR amplicons of the groESL
operon matched A. phagocytophilum. The similarity varied from 95.6% to 99.8%. Twenty-five sequences of the
groESL operon clustered in two genetic lineages, A and B
(Figure 1). In the genetic lineage A, most of the
sequences gathered in two clusters, 1 and 2. Ten
sequences of the groESL operon were 100% identical to
each other and grouped together with a reference
sequence from a Slovenian dog [GenBank:EU381151] in
cluster 2. Three 100% identical sequences clustered
together with a sequence from a Slovenian patient [GenBank:AF033101] in cluster 1 of the same lineage. In the
lineage B, three sequences were 100% identical to each
other and were identical to a reference sequence from a
German tick [GenBank:AY281794] (Table 2). One
sequence (tick EU341) from a pool of nymphs showed
95.6% similarity to other sequences from Slovenian ticks
and 96% similarity with a reference sequence [GenBank:
AY281848] from a German tick and did not cluster in
any of the lineages A or B. Only the sequences that were
not 100% identical were included in the phylogenetic
study.
Ticks are the vectors of many disease-causing pathogens. I. ricinus, the vector of A. phagocytophilum, is distributed throughout Europe, including Slovenia [1].
Environmental factors, such as climate, vegetation type,
and abundance of appropriate hosts, influence the geographical distribution of pathogen vectors and, consequently, pathogens themselves [17]. In this study, ticks
were collected at 8 different locations in Slovenia in two
consecutive years. The overall prevalence of A. phagocytophilum infection in ticks in 2005 and 2006 was 0.31%
and 0.63%, respectively, which is in agreement with the
results from elsewhere in Europe [7]. In a previous
study in Slovenia, the estimated prevalence of infected
ticks was 3.2%, but this was most likely due to the fact
that only a small number of adult ticks was collected at
a single location in central Slovenia [11]. There are also
some reports of higher prevalence of infected ticks, but
the likely reasons are the geographical differences and

the presence of appropriate hosts [7], as well as different
screening methods used. The infection rate in Slovenia
did not differ considerably between the tick stages
(Table 1). In the year 2005, no larvae were found positive, which is in concordance with the fact that anaplasmae are not transovarially transmitted [4].
Only a few reports describe the diversity of A. phagocytophilum in infected ticks sampled from vegetation
[10]. The variety of groESL operon sequences has been
determined and some matched human and horse cases
of anaplasmosis [10]. In this study, a high diversity of
sequences of the groESL operon in ticks has been found.
As discussed in a previous study of deer sequences of
A. phagocytophilum [9], the sequences from the ticks in
Slovenia are also delineated in two genetic lineages
(Figure 1). The similarity between these sequences varied from 97.8% to 99.8%. In the lineage A (dog, human,
wild boar, tick, deer samples), the similarity ranged from
99.5% to 99.9%, and in the lineage B (tick and deer samples), it varied from 99.0% to 99.8%. Different genetic
lineages represent also differences in the amino acid
sequence of GroESL protein (an amino acid serine (lineage A) is substituting alanine (lineage B) at the position
242). It is suggested that the strains of A. phagocytophilum that possess a variant of the protein with the serine
might be pathogenic to humans [18].

Nymphs

A greater diversity of the groESL operon was found at
the nymphal stage of ticks. For this, many reasons are
possible. The groESL genetic variants other than those
that cause the disease in humans and dogs in Slovenia
might not be pathogenic to aforementioned hosts since
they have not been found in them yet [11,19]. It is
nevertheless possible that they circulate only among
small mammals and deer. However, the main reason
could be the number of collected ticks: more nymphs
than adult ticks were collected at all locations and, consequently, higher diversity was found.
In one pool of nymphs from Mozirje, a groESL
sequence showed only a 95.6% similarity with other
groESL operon sequences from the ticks in Slovenia. It
did not cluster within the lineages A and B. Moreover,
after the translation into amino acid sequence, no difference from the lineage B was found (alanine at the position 242). Probably, a novel genetic lineage of the
groESL operon of A. phagocytophilum was found. To
obtain more information about genetic diversity of
A. phagocytophilum in I. ricinus in Slovenia, additional
genetic markers, such as ankA and msp4, should be
analyzed.
I. ricinus nymphal and adult stages are responsible for
the transmission of the pathogen as A. phagocytophilum
was present in both stages. There was no significant

Smrdel et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:102
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/102

difference in the prevalences of A. phagocytophilum at
different locations and in both years. The prevalence of
infection in ticks did not differ considerably from the
reports from elsewhere in Europe. With this study, we
have confirmed that I. ricinus is a vector of a variant of
A. phagocytophilum that causes the disease in humans
and dogs. The sequencing of the groESL operon has
demonstrated a great diversity of A. phagocytophilum in
Slovenia. With phylogenetic analysis, two genetic lineages
have been confirmed and another has been proposed.
Further phylogenetic studies of several other genes, such
as ankA and msp4, might be useful to obtain more information about genetic diversity.
