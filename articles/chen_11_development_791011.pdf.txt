Development of a gene cloning system in a
fast-growing and moderately thermophilic
Streptomyces species and heterologous
expression of Streptomyces antibiotic
biosynthetic gene clusters
Weihua Chen and Zhongjun Qin*

Abstract
Background: Streptomyces species are a major source of antibiotics. They usually grow slowly at their optimal
temperature and fermentation of industrial strains in a large scale often takes a long time, consuming more energy
and materials than some other bacterial industrial strains (e.g., E. coli and Bacillus). Most thermophilic Streptomyces
species grow fast, but no gene cloning systems have been developed in such strains.
Results: We report here the isolation of 41 fast-growing (about twice the rate of S. coelicolor), moderately
thermophilic (growing at both 30°C and 50°C) Streptomyces strains, detection of one linear and three circular
plasmids in them, and sequencing of a 6996-bp plasmid, pTSC1, from one of them. pTSC1-derived pCWH1 could
replicate in both thermophilic and mesophilic Streptomyces strains. On the other hand, several Streptomyces
replicons function in thermophilic Streptomyces species. By examining ten well-sporulating strains, we found two
promising cloning hosts, 2C and 4F. A gene cloning system was established by using the two strains. The
actinorhodin and anthramycin biosynthetic gene clusters from mesophilic S. coelicolor A3(2) and thermophilic S.
refuineus were heterologously expressed in one of the hosts.
Conclusions: We have developed a gene cloning and expression system in a fast-growing and moderately
thermophilic Streptomyces species. Although just a few plasmids and one antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster from
mesophilic Streptomyces were successfully expressed in thermophilic Streptomyces species, we expect that by
utilizing thermophilic Streptomyces-specific promoters, more genes and especially antibiotic genes clusters of
mesophilic Streptomyces should be heterologously expressed.

Background
Streptomyces species are high G+C, Gram-positive bacteria that are a major source of natural products, producing about half of all known microbial antibiotics [1].
Members of this genus also have a complex life cycle, in
which uni-genomic spores geminate to produce a multigenomic substrate mycelium of branching hyphae which
gives rise to aerial hyphae and ultimately to spores [2].

Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is the genetically most studied Streptomyces species from the in vivo through in
vitro to in silico phases and is an excellent model for
studying antibiotic production and differentiation [3,4].
Mainly because of a strong restriction barrier to introduction of foreign double-stranded DNA by transformation from Escherichia coli into A3(2), the closely related
S. lividans, with no such barrier and cured of indigenous
plasmids (SLP2 and SLP3: [5]), has been used as a standard host for gene cloning and expression for several
decades [6]. However, compared with E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, S. coelicolor and S. lividans (also other species from the genus Streptomyces) grow slowly at their

optimal temperature (e.g., S. coelicolor M145 - a plasmid-free derivative of A3(2) - grows exponentially with
a doubling time of about 2.2 h on SMM medium at 28°
C, see ref [6]). It takes about 2-3 weeks for Streptomyces
strains to produce and accumulate antibiotics at a good
yield on an industrial scale.
Fast-growing, thermophilic Streptomyces strains have
been studied for a long time. Some earlier described
thermophilic Streptomyces species (e.g., S. thermophilis
and S. thermofuscus: [7,8]) were not classified as thermophilic streptomycetes [9,10]. Numerical classification
of thermophilic streptomycetes showed three major, five
minor and two single-member clusters [10]. Analysis of
the 16S rRNA genes and morphological and chemical
properties indicate their classification within the genus
Streptomyces [11,12]. Most thermophilic Streptomyces
species have growth temperature ranges from 28 to
55°C and so are only moderately thermophilic [11,12].
However, some thermophilic Streptomyces species can
grow up to 68°C [13]; the optimum growth temperature
of S. thermoautotrophicus is 65°C and no growth is
observed below 40°C, so it is a truly thermophilic strain
[14]. Growth of thermophilic Streptomyces strains is
rapid at high temperature [15]; for example, S. thermoviolaceus has a doubling time of 1 h at 50°C [16]. Thermophilic Streptomyces species produce thermostable
enzymes and antibiotics [15], such as xylanase [17],
alpha-amylase [18], granaticin [16] and anthramycin
[19]. Since thermophilic Streptomyces strains lack a
genetic manipulation system, mesophilic strains (e.g. S.
lividans) have been employed for expression of some
genes or antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters from thermophilic Streptomyces species [20-22].
We report here the development of a gene cloning system in a fast-growing (about twice the rate of S. coelicolor)
and moderately thermophilic (growing at both 30°C and
50°C) Streptomyces strain, and successful heterologous
expression of antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters from
both thermophilic and mesophilic Streptomyces species.

Results and Discussion
Isolation and identification of thermophilic Streptomyces
strains from various soil samples

To isolate thermophilic Streptomyces strains, various soil
samples from China were collected (see Methods). As
summarized in Table 1, 22, 11 and eight strains were isolated from samples of garden soil, weed compost and
swine manure, respectively. Thermophilic Streptomyces
species have been isolated from composts, soil and sewage [23], as well as lakes and hot-springs [13]. Our results
reinforce the idea of a widespread occurrence of these
organisms.
To determine if these strains should be classified in the
genus Streptomyces, 16S rRNA genes were amplified,

cloned and sequenced. The sequences displayed high
homology (97-99%) to those of known mesophilic Streptomyces and/or thermophilic Streptomyces species. A
phylogenetic tree was drawn by using a neighbor-joining
method [24]. The chosen 11 newly isolated strains have
distinct phenotypes when cultured on R2YE and MS
media, and the reference strains utilized for comparison
are well-classified Streptomyces species. As shown in
Figure 1, all 11 newly isolated strains (4F, T6C-1, T1A,
T6E-2. X4-3, T6-1-4, X3-3, 2C, T5A-1, T6A-2 and T6A3) resembled known thermophilic Streptomyces species
(e.g., S. thermocarboxydus, S. thermoviolaceus and
S. glaucescens). Moderately thermophilic Streptomyces
species form at least two distinct clades [12,23,25], containing strains related to S. megasporus and S. thermodiastaticus, respectively. The phylogenetic tree of the 11
newly isolated strains reveals more clades (e.g., T5A-1
and T6E-2; see Figure 1). These results indicate that
moderately thermophilic Streptomyces species are diverse
in natural habitats.
Like typical Streptomyces species, these newly isolated
strains produced spores on R2YE and MS media. Scanning electron microscopy showed that strains 4F and 2C
formed long chains of smooth-surfaced spores after
growth on MS medium at 42°C for 2 d (data not shown).
Thus strains 4F and 2C were classified in the genus
Streptomyces.
Characterization of the fast-growing and moderatelythermophilic Streptomyces strains 4F and 2C

As shown in Figure 2, strains 4F and 2C were able to
grow from 30 to 50°C, while two mesophilic Streptomyces
strains (S. coelicolor M145 and S. venezuelae ISP5230)
grew at 30°C and 37°C. 4F and 2C grew well at 45°C and
50°C but poorly at 55°C, while M145 and ISP5230 could
not grow at 45°C and 50°C (data not shown). Thus, 4F
and 2C were concluded to be moderately thermophilic
Streptomyces strains.
Strains 4F and 2C grew on MS medium at 37°C and
45°C faster than the mesophilic Streptomyces strains at
30°C and 37°C (Figure 2). To measure the growth rates of
4F and M145, equal numbers of spores were inoculated
into TSB liquid medium, and three mycelial samples
were harvested at various points during the time course.
Each sample was weighed, and the three values were averaged for a particular time point. As shown in Figure 3, 4F
rapidly accumulated biomass to a maximum at 45°C or
37°C within 16 h, then the growth curve fluctuated, and
the final biomass of strain 4F is higher for M145 (especially at 45°C). The oscillations shown at 37 and 45°C
resembling the “death/growth process” of S. coelicolor A3
(2) in liquid medium with a diluted inoculum [26]. The
doubling times of growth for 4F at 30, 37, 45 and 50°C
and M145 at 30°C and 37°C in each logarithmic phase

1.1 2.3, 2.2 and 2.4 h, respectively. Thus strain 4F grew at
45°C twice and at 37°C 1.6 times as fast as M145 at 30°C
in TSB medium.
Identification of one linear and three circular plasmids
among 41 strains, and sequencing of pTSC1

We detected three circular plasmids, 7-kb pTSC1, from
X4-3, 7.5-kb pTSC2 from X3-3, and 40-kb pTSC3 as well
as 16-kb linear pTSL1 from T6-1-4. The complete
nucleotide sequence of the circular pTSC1 consisted of
6996 bp (GenBank accession number GU271942), with
72% G+C, resembling that of a typical Streptomyces genome (e.g., 72.1% for S. coelicolor A3(2): [27]). Eight ORFs
(open reading frame) were predicted by “FramePlot 3.0
beta” [28]; seven of them resembled Streptomyces or
Mycobacterium genes (Additional file 1, Table S1). Notably, three genes resembled the transfer and spread genes
(tra and spd) of Streptomyces plasmids pIJ101 [29] and
pSNA1 [30].
Development of a gene cloning system in strains 2C
and 4F

Followed the standard protocols of preparation and transformation of Streptomyces protoplasts with slight modifications (see Methods), pTSC1-derived pCWH1 (see
Methods and Table 2) was introduced by transformation
into ten well-sporulating thermophilic Streptomyces
strains. Thiostrepton-resistant colonies were obtained for
strains 2C and 4F at frequencies of 1.3 × 103 and 2 × 101
per μg DNA, but no transformants arose for the other
eight strains. Many Streptomyces selection markers (e.g.,
tsr, apr, spec, hyg, erm and kan) could be used in strains

2C and 4F. No antibacterial activity (e.g., against Bacillus
subtilis, Escherichia coli or Staphyloccocus aureus) was
detected in the two strains (unpublished data). Thus, we
found two promising cloning hosts, 2C and 4F.
Since 2C and 4F were classified in the genus Streptomyces, several mesophilic Streptomyces vectors were
employed for transformation experiments. As shown in
Table 3, pIJ702 (a pIJ101 derivative, [31]), pZR51 (pFRL2,
[32]), pZR115 (pFP1, [33]) and pZR10 (pFP11, [33]) were
able to transform both 2C and 4F. No transformants were
obtained for SCP2 [34], SLP1[35], SAP1 [36] and pSHK1
[32] derivatives (pYQ40, pZR205, pHAQ61, and pGP9,
respectively). pCWH1 could also transform S. lividans
ZX7 [37] at high frequency (104/μg DNA). A Streptomyces
integrating plasmid, pSET152 [38], could be introduced by
conjugation from E. coli into many thermophilic Streptomyces strains (14 of 22 strains). Thus, pTSC1-derived
pCWH1 can replicate in both thermophilic and mesophilic Streptomyces strains. On the other hand, several Streptomyces replicons, including circular plasmids pIJ101,
pFP1 and pFP11 and linear plasmid pFRL2, were able to
propagate in the thermophilic Streptomyces strains 2C and
4F, but no transformants were obtained for circular plasmids SCP2 and SLP1 and linear plasmids SAP1 and
pSHK1.
Comparing the transformation frequencies of pIJ702
from different hosts in 2C and 4F, as shown in Table 3,
similar high frequencies of transformation (2.9 × 106 and
1.3 × 106) were obtained in 2C with pIJ702 from both 2C
itself and the largely restriction-free S. lividans ZX7. Low
frequencies of transformation (8 × 101 and 3 × 102) were
obtained in 4F with pIJ702 from 2C and ZX7, although a
high frequency (1.2 × 10 5 ) was obtained with plasmid
DNA from the strain itself. These results indicated that

strain 2C showed essentially no restriction barrier to the
introduction of foreign double-stranded DNA from other
Streptomyces species, whereas strain 4F had a strong
restriction barrier. The evaluation of restriction barriers
needs much more experimental data to be supported.
Heterologous expression of the actinorhodin biosynthetic
gene cluster of S. coelicolor A3(2) in strain 4F

Since several mesophilic Streptomyces plasmids functioned
in thermophilic Streptomyces, we chose a phage phiC31derived integrating plasmid pSET152 [38] which is inherited stably in other hosts to perform experiment on heterologous expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in
thermophilic Streptomyces strains. By using PCR with
eight primers from the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes
(sco5085-5092), we found that no bands for strains 4F and
2C were detected on agarose gel after electrophoresis of
the PCR products, indicating no such genes in the strains.
We cloned the complete actinorhodin biosynthetic gene

cluster from S. coelicolor A3(2) in an integrating plasmid
(see Methods), and the resulting plasmid, pCWH74, was
introduced by conjugation into eight newly isolated
strains, including 4F and 2C. PCR amplification experiments with eight paired primers from SCO5085 to
SCO5092 confirmed the presence of the actinorhodin
genes in the clones of 4F and 2C. Blue pigment was
observed for strain 4F on both R2YE and MS media at 30
and 37°C after growth for 1 d, but no blue pigment was
seen at 45°C. 2C with the actinorhodin gene cluster did
not produce visible blue pigment on R2YE or MS media.
To confirm that the blue pigment was actinorhodin, 4F
containing pCWH74 was cultured in R2YE liquid medium
lacking KH2PO4 and CaCl2 and the supernatant was treated with KOH and scanned at 640 nm [39]. The same pattern of absorption peaks was detected for 4F as for
S. coelicolor A3(2) (data not shown). Thus the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster from the mesophilic S. coelicolor A3(2) was heterologously expressed in strain 4F at

To quantitate the productivity of actinorhodin, equal
amounts of spores of M145 and 4F containing pCWH74
were inoculated into R2YE liquid medium lacking

KH2PO4 and CaCl2, and 1 ml culture was harvested in a
time-course. As shown in Figure 4, actinorhodin was
produced in 4F at both 30 and 37°C, earlier than in
M145 at 30°C. At 100 h, productivity of actinorhodin in
4F at 30°C was ~2.8 times higher than in M145 at 30°C.

Strains M145 and 4F grew better in TSB than in R2YE
liquid media (data no shown), but no actinorhodin was
detected when cultured in TSB medium at 30 and 37°C.
Growth curves of the two strains in R2 lacking KH2PO4
and CaCl 2 at 30°C showed that their biomass values
were similar from 20 to 120 hours (data not shown).
Thus, better growth of M145 and 4F in TSB medium
(Figure 3) did not correlate with delayed and less production of actinorhodin in R2YE medium (Figure 4).
Like in 4F, M145 produced more actinorhodin in
R2YE medium at 30°C than at 37°C, suggesting that

expression of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes
might be temperature-dependent. Temperature-dependent antibiotic gene clusters have been reported in
Streptomyces, for example, much higher productivity of
validamycin A produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus
was found at 37°C than at 30°C [40]. We infer that by
replacement of thermophilic-specific promoters, many
single genes and especially antibiotic genes clusters of
mesophilic Streptomyces should be heterologously
expressed in the fast-growing and thermophilic
Streptomyces.

Figure 4 Quantitation of actinorhodin production by M145 and
by 4F containing the cloned actinorhodin gene cluster in liquid
medium. About 1 × 106 spores of M145 and of 4F containing
pCWH74 were inoculated into 50 ml R2YE liquid medium (lacking
KH2PO4 and CaCl2) at 30 and 37°C. Samples of 1 ml culture were
harvested in a time-course and treated with KOH; absorption at
OD640 indicated actinorhodin production.

Heterologous expression of the anthramycin biosynthetic
gene cluster of the thermophilic S. refuineus subsp.
thermotolerans in strain 4F

Expression of the anthramycin biosynthetic genes of
S. refuineus subsp. thermotolerans could be detected at
high temperature (i.e. 47°C), but not at 30 or 37°C [22].
An integrating cosmid, 024COA-3, containing the whole
anthramycin biosynthetic gene cluster was introduced
by conjugation from E. coli into strain 4F. PCR amplification experiments confirmed the presence of the
anthramycin genes in the clone of 4F. After culturing in
AP1 medium at 30, 37 and 47°C for 24 h, mycelium was
extracted, dried and re-dissolved in MeOH. Thin-layer
chromatography, followed by a bio-assay by overlaying
with LB agar containing as indicator strain a Bacillus
sp., revealed a zone of growth inhibition on 4F at 47°C,
but no inhibition zone was found at 30 and 37°C (data
not shown). A spot on a TLC plate was further purified
for HPLC-MS analysis. As shown in Figure 5, an anthramycin-specific peak (ES+ = 316 Dalton, see ref [41])
was detected. Thus the anthramycin biosynthetic gene
cluster of the thermophilic S. refuineus subsp. thermotolerans was heterologously expressed in strain 4F. We
introduced the same cosmid 024COA-3 containing the
anthramycin gene cluster into strain 2C, but no transformants were obtained. To see if strain 2C might be a
better host than 4F, more antibiotic biosynthetic gene
clusters should be tested.

Conclusions
This study shows that by isolation of new strains and
testing several plasmids, a host-vector system in a fastgrowing and moderately thermophilic Streptomyces species could be developed. Two antibiotic biosynthetic gene
clusters from mesophilic and thermophilic Streptomyces
were heterlogously expressed in one strain. We expect

that by utilizing thermophilic Streptomyces-specific promoters, more genes and especially antibiotic genes clusters of mesophilic Streptomyces should be heterologously
expressed.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and general methods

Strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Plasmid
isolation, transformation of E. coli DH5a and PCR amplification followed Sambrook et al. [42]. Streptomyces culture, plasmid isolation and preparation of protoplasts and
transformation of Streptomyces lividans ZX7 followed
Kieser et al. [6]. Plasmid trans-conjugation from E. coli
ET12567/pUZ8002 into thermophilic Streptomyces
strains followed Bierman et al. [38]. KpnI-treated pTSC1
was cloned in pBluescript II SK to obtain pCWH100 and
was sequenced by primer-walking at Shanghai Invitrogen
Inc. Sequence comparisons were done with software
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. The complete
nucleotide sequence of pTSC1 was deposited in the GenBank database under no. GU271942.
Isolation and identification of thermophilic Streptomyces
strains

Samples of garden soil, weed compost and swine manure
were collected from Shanghai city, Hunan, Hubei and
Fujian provinces in the summers of 2005 and 2006.
The samples were dried at 100°C for 1 h and cultivated on
SC medium (starch 10 g, casein 0.3 g, KNO 3 2 g,
MgSO4.7H2O 0.05 g, FeSO4.7H2O 0.01 g, CaCO3 0.02 g,
agar 18 g, H2O to 1000 ml, pH7.2) [43] at 50°C for 3-5 d.
Thermophilic Streptomyces strains were cultured in TSB
(Oxoid tryptone soya broth powder, 30 g, H2O to 1000
ml) liquid medium at 45°C for 1 d and genomic DNA was
isolated followed the Kirby mix procedure [6]. 16S rRNA

genes were amplified by PCR with primers (5’-AGAG
TTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3’ and 5’-TCAGGCTACCTT
GTTACGACTT-3’). PCR conditions were: template DNA
denatured at 95°C for 5 min, then 95°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s,
72°C 2 min, for 35 cycles. PCR products were cloned in
pBluescript II SK and sequenced with its T7 and T3
primers.
Strains were inoculated on MS (mannitol 20 g, soya
flour 20 g, agar 20 g, H2O to 1000 ml, pH7) medium covered with cellophane disks. After 2 days incubation at
42°C, the cells were fixed with fresh 2% glutaraldehyde
(pH7.2) and 1% osmium tetroxide. Spores were examined
with a JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscopy (Jeol).
Isolation of plasmids from thermophilic Streptomyces
strains

Isolating plasmid from thermophilic Streptomyces strains
followed the protocol of Kieser [44] with sight modification. Strains were cultured in TSB liquid medium at 42°C
overnight and mycelium was harvested by spinning at
4000 rpm for 15 min. About 50 μl mycelium was suspended in 350 μl TES buffer (25 mM Tris-HCL pH8,
25 mM EDTA pH8, 0.3 M sucrose, 2 mg/ml lysozyme,
5 μg/ml pre-boiled RNase A) and incubated at 37°C for
30 min. 44 μl of 10% SDS was added and mixed immediately by rotating and then 4 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K
was added, followed by incubation for 60 min. 225 μl of
0.3 N NaOH/2% SDS was added and mixed immediately
by vortexing, incubated at 70°C for 15 min and then
cooled. 200 μl acid phenol/chloroform was added and
vortexed and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. The
supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube containing 55 μl un-buffered sodium acetate and 500 μl isopropanol was added. After mixing and centrifugation at
12000 rpm for 10 min and all liquid was removed using a
pipette. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml 70% ethanol, air dried and dissolved in 50 μl TE buffer.
Growth curve of thermophilic Streptomyces strains in
liquid culture

About 1.5 × 107 spores were inoculated into 50 ml TSB
liquid medium supplemented with 0.01% antifoam289
(Sigma A 5551) and cultured at 30, 37, 45 and 50°C. 1 ml
culture was harvested at each time-point and wet mycelium was harvested by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for
5 min. After drying for 10 min in a vacuum, the pellet was
weighed with a fine balance (min. 10 mg). Growth curves
were drawn with an average of three weighings at each
time-point.
Protoplast preparation and transformation of
thermophilic Streptomyces strains

Protoplast preparation, regeneration and transformation
of the thermophilic Streptomyces strains 2C and 4F

Page 8 of 10

followed standard Streptomyces protocols [6,45] with
slight modifications. About 1 × 109 spores were inoculated into 50-ml YEME liquid medium (yeast extract
powder 3 g, peptone 5 g, malt extract powder 3 g, glucose 10 g, with 25% sucrose, H2O to 1000 ml, pH7, supplemented with 0.5% glycine for 2C and 0.3% for 4F) at
45°C for ~7 h. Mycelium was harvested, washed once
with 10.3% sucrose, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme solution in P
buffer was added at 30°C (ca. 15 min for 2C and 30 min
for 4F) to make protoplasts. After transformation, regeneration of protoplasts was achieved on R2YE medium at
45°C for ca. 9 h, to be selected by antibiotics.
Construction of plasmids for transformation of
thermophilic Streptomyces strains

Plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 2. Sizes of
circular plasmids pTSC1, pTSC2 and pTSC3 and linear
plasmid pTSL1 from thermophilic Streptomyces strains
were measured by electrophoresis with known DNA markers (i.e. 1-kb supercoiled ladder and sequenced circular/
linear plasmids). pQC156 [46] containing Streptomyces
selection markers melC/tsr was cloned in an E.coli plasmid
pSP72. KpnI-treated pTSC1 was cloned in pQC156 to
obtain pCWH1. The mesophilic Streptomyces replicons,
including circular plasmids SCP2 [34], pFP1 and pFP11
[33], linear plasmids SAP1 [36], pFRL2 [32] and pSHK1
[32], and integrating plasmid SLP1 [35], were cloned in
pQC156 to yield pYQ40, pZR115, pZR10, pQC578,
pHAQ61, pZR51, pGP9 and pZR205, respectively. These
plasmids were introduced by protoplast transformation
into thermophilic Streptomyces strains.
Cloning and heterologous expression of the actinorhodin
gene cluster in thermophilic Streptomyces

pHAQ31 [47] contained an E.coli replication origin and
two cos sites of Supercos1 [48] and Streptomyces selection
markers melC/tsr genes [31]. pHAQ31-derived cosmid
N7-85 contained the whole actinorhodin biosynthetic
gene cluster (5510413-5543521 bp) from S. coelicolor A3
(2). A 3.4-kb XbaI/NheI fragment containing the phage
фC31 integrase gene of pSET152 was cloned in a XbaI site
of N7-85. The resulting plasmid, pCWH74, was introduced by conjugation from E. coli into thermophilic Streptomyces strains [38], which were cultured on R2YE
(sucrose 103 g, K2SO4 0.25 g, MgCl2.6H2O 10.12 g, glucose 10 g, Difco Casaminoacids 0.1 g, trace element solution 2 ml, Difco yeast extract 5 g, TES 5.73 g, agar 22 g,
H2O to 1000 ml, after autoclave and add 0.5% KH2PO4 5
ml, 5 M CaCl 2 .2H 2 O 4 ml, 20% L-proline 15 ml, 1N
NaOH 7 ml) and MS media at 30, 37 and 45°C to detect
blue actinorhodin pigment. To quantitate the production
of actinorhodin, about 1 × 10 6 spores of M145 and 4F
containing pCWH74 were inoculated into 50 ml R2YE
liquid medium (lacking KH2PO4 and CaCl2 ) at 30 and

Chen and Qin BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/243

37°C; 1 ml culture was harvested in a time-course and
treated with KOH, whereupon absorption at OD640 indicated actinorhodin production [39].
Heterologous expression of the anthramycin biosynthetic
gene cluster in thermophilic Streptomyces

An integrating cosmid, 024COA-3, containing the whole
anthramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (EU195114.1, 133150 bp) (kindly provided by Prof. Brian Bachmann) was
introduced by conjugation from E. coli into strain 4F [38].
Detection of anthramycin production followed Hu et al.
[41]. After culturing in AP1 (corn starch 10 g, 2% peptonized milk, yeast extract powder 30 g, H2O to 1000 ml,
pH7) medium at 47°C for 24 h, mycelium was extracted,
dried and re-dissolved in MeOH. Anthramycin was first
isolated on a HPLC column (Zorbax eclips 1.8 μm XDBC18) and then mass spectrometry was performed using
6520 Agilent Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS. Anthramycin was separated by using a Zorbax eclips 1.8 μm XDBC18 with a linear water-acetonitrile gradient containing
10 mM ammonium acetate (0.2 ml/min). The electrospray
needle of the mass spectrometer was at 4000 V, the voltage of the skimmer was set to 65 V, Oct RF Vpp750V,
collision ev 45 V, nebulizer pressure at 45 psig, and drying
gas N2 350°C 9 L/min.
