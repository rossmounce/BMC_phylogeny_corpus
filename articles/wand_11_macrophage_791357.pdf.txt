isolates of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and
B. oklahomensis

Abstract
Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a tropical disease of humans with a
variable and often fatal outcome. In murine models of infection, different strains exhibit varying degrees of
virulence. In contrast, two related species, B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis, are highly attenuated in mice. Our
aim was to determine whether virulence in mice is reflected in macrophage or wax moth larvae (Galleria
mellonella) infection models.
Results: B. pseudomallei strains 576 and K96243, which have low median lethal dose (MLD) values in mice, were
able to replicate and induce cellular damage in macrophages and caused rapid death of G. mellonella. In contrast,
B. pseudomallei strain 708a, which is attenuated in mice, showed reduced replication in macrophages, negligible
cellular damage and was avirulent in G. mellonella larvae. B. thailandensis isolates were less virulent than B.
pseudomallei in all of the models tested. However, we did record strain dependent differences. B. oklahomensis
isolates were the least virulent isolates. They showed minimal ability to replicate in macrophages, were unable to
evoke actin-based motility or to form multinucleated giant cells and were markedly attenuated in G. mellonella
compared to B. thailandensis.
Conclusions: We have shown that the alternative infection models tested here, namely macrophages and Galleria
mellonella, are able to distinguish between strains of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis and that
these differences reflect the observed virulence in murine infection models. Our results indicate that B.
oklahomensis is the least pathogenic of the species investigated. They also show a correlation between isolates of
B. thailandensis associated with human infection and virulence in macrophage and Galleria infection models.

Background
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular
pathogen responsible for melioidosis, an infectious
disease of humans prevalent in Southeast Asia and
Northern Australia [1]. Infections in humans may result
in a wide range of clinical symptoms and manifestations
[2,3] and in some individuals the bacterium is able to
persist with symptoms not shown until several years
after exposure [4].

B. pseudomallei has been shown to have a broad host
range with disease reported in animals ranging from
kangaroos to dolphins [5,6]. However, in the laboratory,
the mouse is the most commonly used infection model
[7]. Different strains of B. pseudomallei vary markedly
in their virulence in murine models of disease. When
given by the intraperitoneal (i.p) route, the most virulent
isolates have an infectious dose of less than 50 colony
forming units (cfu), whereas in the least virulent isolates
the infectious dose is over 5,000 cfu [7]. It is not clear
whether these differences in virulence in mice are associated with the various clinical outcomes observed in
humans.

Whilst murine models of infection are valuable for
understanding mechanisms of virulence, the behaviour
of B. pseudomallei in cell culture systems has been used
to characterise the intracellular lifestyle of the bacterium. B. pseudomallei has been shown to be taken up by
professional phagocytes including mouse macrophagelike cell lines such as J774 and RAW264 [8,9] and nonphagocytic cells including HeLa and A549 cells [8].
More recently, other members of the Burkholderia
genus including B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis
have been described as being closely related to B. pseudomallei [10,11]. Indeed, until recently, B. thailandensis
isolates were classified as B. pseudomallei [10]. There is
extensive chromosomal synteny between B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei, although some virulenceassociated genes which are present in B. pseudomallei
are absent in B. thailandensis [12]. Both B. pseudomallei
and B. thailandensis are able to invade and grow in a
range of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, forming
plaques or multinucleated giant cells [13,14]. However,
there is also evidence that the behaviour of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis differs in different cell lines.
In A549 and human dendritic cells, B. pseudomallei has
been shown to be more invasive than B. thailandensis,
but there were no reported differences in the growth
rate within cells. In contrast, in human macrophages,
differences in intracellular growth rates have been
reported [14]. Collectively, these findings have suggested
that B. thailandensis could be used as a model to study
certain aspects of the intracellular lifestyle of B. pseudomallei in cell culture systems [15]. The behaviour of
B. oklahomensis in cell culture models is not known.
The value of whole animal or plant infection models,
which use B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis in place
of B. pseudomallei, is much less clear. Isolates of B.
thailandensis and B. oklahomensis that have been tested
are considered to be highly attenuated or avirulent in
BALB/c mice, with lethal doses for most isolates in
excess of 107 cfu by the i.p. route [16]. However, using
intranasal challenge models, doses of greater than
10 4 cfu of B. thailandensis are reportedly able to kill
mice and replicate B. pseudomallei disease phenotypes,
although even in this model it is clear that B. thailandensis is much less virulent than B. pseudomallei [7].
There has been significant interest in the development
of alternative infection models which avoid the use of
mammals but also reflect the differences in virulence of
species and isolates seen in mice. The Caenorhabditis elegans [17] or tomato plant [18] infection models were not
able to distinguish between B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis, and in C. elegans, B. thailandensis was the
most virulent [17]. Galleria mellonella (wax moth) larvae
have previously been reported as susceptible to infection
with B. pseudomallei, and a single B. thailandensis strain

tested was reportedly less virulent [19]. This finding suggests that G. mellonella larvae may be a suitable host species for discerning differences in virulence.
Our aim was to determine whether differences in the
virulence of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and B.
oklahomensis isolates could be reliably determined in
macrophage and G. mellonella larvae infection models.

Results
B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis are
internalised with similar efficiencies into J774A.1
macrophages

For this study we have selected a range of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis isolates of
known ancestry. The properties of these isolates and
their virulence in murine models of disease is summarised in Table 1. The intracellular replication profiles
for each isolate were initially determined in a cell culture model using murine macrophages. This was performed using a modified intracellular replication assay
where 250 μg/ml kanamycin was used to kill extracellular bacteria, as validated below. Initially, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of kanamycin for each
strain was determined and found to be 16-128 μg/ml
(Table 1). All of the strains tested were unable to grow
in the presence of 250 μg/ml kanamycin in broth. Similarly, supernatants of J774A.1 cell cultures containing
250 μg/ml kanamycin and infected with any of the
strains did not contain viable bacteria when samples
were plated onto agar. To test for harmful effects of
kanamycin on eukaryotic cell lines, cell toxicity assays
(LDH assays) were carried out on culture supernatants
from uninfected J774A.1 cells that had been cultured in
the presence of 250 μg/ml kanamycin. There was no significant difference between the LDH levels of these culture supernatants compared to control supernatants
from J774A.1 cells cultured in the absence of kanamycin
(data not shown).
The first parameter that was assessed in the macrophage model was internalisation efficiencies of the Burkholderia strains. Bacteria released from J774A.1
macrophages lysed 2 hrs post infection were enumerated
on agar plates and compared to the input number.
There was no significant difference between the degree
of internalisation of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis or
B. oklahomensis into murine macrophages (Figure 1A).
High virulence isolates of B. pseudomallei grow more
rapidly in J774A.1 macrophages than low virulence
isolates, B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis

Next, intracellular replication was measured at 2, 4, 6, 8
and 12 hrs post infection. There was a significant difference between the numbers of intracellular B. pseudomallei strains 576 and K96243 at 12 hrs post infection

(P = 0.002; Figure 1B) and both were significantly higher
than numbers of intracellular B. pseudomallei strain
708a and any of the B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis
strains tested (P < 0.002, both). Bacterial numbers were
over 10-fold lower with any of the B. thailandensis or
B. oklahomensis strains tested (compare Figure 1B to
Figure 1C&1D). To test whether the low numbers of
intracellular bacteria observed with B. pseudomallei
708a, which is more sensitive to kanamycin, was a consequence of low levels of antibiotic crossing the eukaryotic cell membrane, J774A.1 cells were infected with B.
thailandensis DW503 (an amrAB-oprA efflux pump
mutant and therefore highly sensitive to kanamycin) and
intracellular bacterial numbers were compared to its
parental strain E264. The numbers of bacteria isolated
at each time point were not significantly different
between strains E264 and DW503 (data not shown).
Our results also showed variance between the patterns
of growth in macrophages of different isolates of B. thailandensis. The B. thailandensis strains previously isolated from cases of human disease, CDC272 and
CDC301, showed increased numbers at 12 hrs post
infection relative to B. thailandensis E264 (P < 0.004,
both; see insert in Figure 1C) and the two B. oklahomensis strains C6786 and E0147 (P < 0.009, both), but
not B. thailandensis strain Phuket (P > 0.05). To show
that these differences in bacterial numbers were due to
differences in intracellular replication and survival rather
than a difference in bacterial fitness, growth rates of
bacteria in antibiotic free media were compared. There
was no significant difference between any of the strains
tested (data not shown).
Cellular damage assessed by LDH release correlates with
virulence

The ability to cause cellular damage is often used as an
indicator of bacterial virulence. Cellular damage can be
measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
from dead or dying cells. J774A.1 macrophages were
challenged with bacteria and LDH levels in supernatants
were measured at 12 and 24 hrs post infection. At 12 hrs,
LDH levels were relatively low and there was no significant difference in the levels of LDH released from cells
infected with any of the bacteria tested (data not shown).
However, at 24 hrs, the levels of LDH in the supernatants
of cells infected with B. pseudomallei strains 576 or
K96243 was higher than the LDH levels in cell supernatants infected with other Burkholderia strains (P < 0.03,
both; Figure 2). Supernatants from cells infected with B.
thailandensis strains CDC272, CDC301 and Phuket contained elevated levels of LDH relative to uninfected controls, but supernatants from cells infected with B.
pseudomallei 708a, B. thailandensis E264 or either B.
oklahomensis strain contained negligible levels of LDH.

of Burkholderia as measured by LDH release. J774A.1
macrophages were infected with Burkholderia strains at an MOI of
10 as already described and culture supernatants were analysed at
24 hrs post infection. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
from damaged or lysed cells was measured as described in the
method section using a calorimetrical assay. Supernatants from
uninfected macrophages were used to obtain a background OD
490 nm value, which was subtracted from the sample
measurements. The error bars represent the standard error of the
mean derived from three independent experiments, each
performed in three technical replicates. ND = not detected.

B. thailandensis but not B. oklahomensis is able to cause
multinucleated giant cell formation

B. pseudomallei has previously been shown to form multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) upon invasion of macrophages [20]. Here, B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis
strains were tested for their ability to form MNGCs after
infecting J774A.1 macrophages. A cell was considered to
be a MNGC if there were 3 or more nuclei present. B. thailandensis was able to induce MNGC formation in a strain
dependent manner. B. thailandensis strains CDC272 and
CDC301 were most effective at causing MNGC formation
(Figure 3A). In contrast, B. thailandensis strain E264 was
poor at causing the formation of MNGCs and the B. oklahomensis strains tested did not appear to induce MNGC
formation beyond uninfected background levels. A representative confocal microscopy image of a MNGC formed
by B. thailandensis is shown in Figure 3B.
B. thailandensis but not B. oklahomensis exhibits actinbased motility in J774A.1 macrophages

Actin-based motility on infection of eukaryotic cells has
previously been demonstrated for B. pseudomallei [20,21]
and B. thailandensis strain E30 [22]. To determine
whether other B. thailandensis strains and B. oklahomensis are also able to migrate using actin-based motility,
J774A.1 macrophages were infected with strains that
expressed red fluorescent protein from plasmid pBHR4groS-RFP. In preliminary studies, we showed that the

infection. Cells were stained with Giemsa and the percentage of MNGCs was calculated relative to normal macrophages per field of view.

presence of the plasmid did not affect the growth of the
bacteria in LB broth or inside macrophages, and the plasmid was stably maintained for the course of the intracellular replication assay. At different time points post
infection, macrophages were stained with Phalloidin conjugated to FITC and analysed by confocal microscopy.
Both B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis were visualised in the cells. Actin tails were visible and associated
with B. thailandensis (Figure 3B) but were not visible in
B. oklahomensis infected cells (Figure 3C).
Infection of Galleria mellonella larvae with Burkholderia

Galleria mellonella (wax moth) larvae were challenged
with approximately 100 cfu of B. pseudomallei, B.

thailandensis or B. oklahomensis and survival was
recorded at 24 hrs post-challenge. B. pseudomallei
strains 576 or K96243 caused 100% mortality, but no
deaths were observed after challenge with B. pseudomallei 708a (Figure 4A). Challenge with B. oklahomensis
strains C6786 or E0147 also did not result in death of
the larvae at 24 hrs post infection. The B. thailandensis
strains showed different degrees of virulence in this
model. 100% mortality was recorded after challenge with
B. thailandensis CDC272 or CDC301. Challenge with
B. thailandensis Phuket or E264 resulted in mortality
of approximately 80% and 50% of larvae, respectively
(Figure 4A). At 20 hrs post challenge, just prior to the
onset of paralysis and death, larvae were sacrificed and

bacteria. After 24 hrs, all larvae infected with heat killed
bacteria were still alive, whereas those infected with live
bacteria had all died (data not shown).
At higher challenge doses of 10,000 cfu bacteria, all of
the strains caused 100% mortality of the cohort of larvae
at 24 hrs post injection, except B. pseudomallei 708a, B.
thailandensis DW503 and B. oklahomensis E0147. At
lower inocula of 10 cfu bacteria, all of the B. pseudomallei strains were able to kill G. mellonella by 72 hrs post
challenge, but no dead larvae were recorded up to 5
days after challenge with B. thailandensis or B.
oklahomensis.

strains in Galleria mellonella larvae. Groups of 10 insect larvae
were challenged with 100 cfu of different strains of Burkholderia as
described in the method section. A) Percentage of surviving larvae

the number of bacteria in the haemocoel was enumerated. For all of the strains tested, the bacterial numbers
at 20 hrs post infection were higher than the input
number (Figure 4B). Similar to the cell culture model,
B. pseudomallei strains 576 and K96243 and B. thailandensis strains CDC272, CDC301 and Phuket showed
increased bacterial numbers relative to B. pseudomallei
708a, B. thailandensis E264 and both B. oklahomensis
strains. To show that live bacteria are needed for killing of
G. mellonella, B. thailandensis CDC272 or CDC301 were
inactivated by heating to 80°C for 1 hour and then injected
into G. mellonella larvae at the same concentration as live

Discussion
In this study, we set out to identify inexpensive alternative infection models that would reflect the virulence of
B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis or B. oklahomensis in
mice and the association of these isolates with human
disease. We have chosen B. pseudomallei isolates with
different degree of virulence in mice, with strain 576
representing one of the most virulent isolates tested to
date, and 708a one of the least [7]. B. thailandensis and
B. oklahomensis are not normally considered to be
human pathogens. However, occasional cases of disease
do occur. We have included clinical isolates of B. thailandensis in our study alongside B. thailandensis isolates
that have not been associated with disease (E264 and
Phuket), as well as clinical isolates of B. oklahomensis.
In general, our results confirm that cell culture or
Galleria infection models can be used to discriminate B.
pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis isolates and these results parallel those found in mice.
With the exception of strain 708a and compared with B.
thailandensis and B. oklahomensis isolates, the B. pseudomallei isolates we tested grew more rapidly in macrophages, caused a greater degree of cellular damage and
caused greater mortality of G. mellonella larvae. The B.
oklahomensis isolates we tested were the least virulent
in all of these models. Our finding that we are able to
distinguish between B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis isolates on the basis of their virulence in G. mellonella indicates that this model has a greater utility for
the identification of virulence factors than the C. elegans
[17] or tomato plant [18] infection models.
There were some important differences in the relative
virulence of isolates within each species in our models
which are not reflected in mouse virulence data. In our
macrophage and G. mellonella models, B. pseudomallei
708a was highly attenuated, to a level similar to that of
the least virulent B. thailandensis isolates and both of
the B. oklahomensis isolates. However, B. pseudomallei
708a is reported to be significantly more virulent than
any B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis isolates
in mice [7,16,23]. B. pseudomallei 708a is a naturally

Wand et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/11

occurring gentamicin sensitive isolate that, when compared to B. pseudomallei K96243, contains a 131-kb
deletion within chromosome I [23]. This deletion
removes the amrAB-oprA operon providing aminoglycoside resistance, which explains the low MIC of kanamycin for this strain (Table 1). The deletion also results in
loss of genes coding for the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, clusters encoding cobalamin and malleobactin iron uptake systems, and a putative type-1
fimbrial gene cluster [23]. Transcriptome data obtained
from B. pseudomallei K96243 at day three after intranasal infection of BALB/c mice showed that genes
involved in iron acquisition, including the malleobactin
operon, were induced in vivo compared to bacteria
grown in vitro in LB broth (C. Müller, unpublished
data). The same genes are also upregulated under low
iron conditions [24,25], which suggests that B. pseudomallei encounters iron limited conditions in the mouse
model of infection. The absence of these siderophore
systems in strain 708a might also partly explain the
observed intracellular replication defect in macrophages
(Figure 1B). Overall, and bearing in mind the genome
plasticity of B. pseudomallei [26], we cannot be certain
that the B. pseudomallei 708a isolate we have used in
our study was genetically similar to the isolate previously tested in mice. It would therefore be valuable to
re-test the B. pseudomallei 708a isolate we have used
for virulence in mice.
We also identified differences in the virulence of B.
thailandensis isolates, which were consistent between
our macrophage growth, macrophage killing and G. mellonella models, but not with previously reported data on
virulence in mice or hamsters. In our models, CDC301
and CDC272 were the most virulent isolates, whereas
CDC301, E264 and Phuket were most virulent in mouse
and hamster infection models [16]. A recent study
revealed that both CDC strains belong to the same
sequence type and are part of a distinct phylogenetic subgroup of B. thailandensis isolates that is separate from
strains isolated in Thailand [27]. Moreover, a strain
belonging to the same subgroup as the CDC strains was
shown to have an increased ability to replicate in macrophages compared to strain E264, in agreement with our
data presented in Figure 1C. The same study [27]
revealed that CDC301 encodes a gene cluster with 94%
nucleotide similarity to the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis cluster of B. pseudomallei, which has been
shown to play a role in virulence in mice and in hamsters
[28,29]. However, our observation that strain CDC272,
which does not express the Bp-like capsular polysaccharide, is as virulent as strain CDC301 in the G. mellonella
model suggests that the capsular polysaccharide cluster is
not required for virulence in insects. Overall, our results
show that human clinical isolates of B. thailandensis are

Page 7 of 11

more virulent in macrophage and G. mellonella models,
and the proposal that clinical B. thailandensis isolates
from the USA are less virulent than SE Asian isolates
[16] is not borne out by our data. At this time it is not
clear whether murine, hamster, macrophage or G. mellonella models reflect virulence of these isolates in humans.
Our finding that the B. oklahomensis isolates have low
virulence in macrophage or G. mellonella models is consistent with the report that these isolates exhibit low virulence in murine or hamster models [16]. Our work also
identifies some possible reasons for this. Although we
were able to visualise RFP-labelled B. oklahomensis cells
in macrophages, we did not observe actin tail formation,
suggesting that the bacteria would not be able to spread
from cell to cell in the same way as B. thailandensis or B.
pseudomallei [20-22]. MNGCs also failed to form in cells
infected with B. oklahomensis, though this may simply
reflect the inability of the bacteria to grow in J774A.1
macrophages. Actin-based motility in B. pseudomallei is
dependent on BimA, which nucleates actin polymerisation [30]. Our analysis of the B. oklahomensis shotgun
genome sequences [Genebank accession numbers
NZ_ABBG01000000 and NZ_ABBF01000000] indicated
the presence of a BimA-like protein with 46% overall
identity to its orthologue in B. thailandensis E264
(BTH_II0875), and 40% identity to the B. pseudomallei
K96243 protein (BPSS1492). The last 160 amino acids of
the BimA orthologues were found to be highly conserved
between all species, whereas the N-terminus exhibited
considerable variation. The B. oklahomensis BimA proteins contain B. mallei-like signal peptide and prolinerich domains and a B. thailandensis-like central acid
domain, but seem to lack a WASP homology domain-2
[22]. Therefore, it is not clear if B. oklahomensis BimA is
functional in promoting actin polymerisation. Intracellular replication and endosomal escape of B. pseudomallei
depends on the type III secretion system TTSS-3 [21],
which is also present in B. thailandensis [31]. Our analysis of the B. oklahomensis genomes revealed the presence
of a TTSS3 gene cluster, with homologies of the encoded
proteins ranging from 45% to 98% compared to the B.
pseudomallei K96243 orthologues. However, two genes,
BPSS1553 (bprP) and BPSS1554 (bprQ), which have
recently been identified as ToxR and ToxS-like regulators
encoded directly downstream of the TTSS in B. pseudomallei [32], are also found in B. thailandensis but are
absent in the B. oklahomensis strains. BprP activates the
expression of TTSS genes, and a bprP mutant in B. pseudomallei does not secrete TTSS effector proteins and is
unable to kill macrophages [32]. The absence of this activator in B. oklahomensis might therefore explain the low
virulence of this species.
In this study we have not tested Burkholderia mallei,
another species closely related to B. pseudomallei, for

Wand et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/11

virulence in cell culture or Galleria models. It is known
that B. mallei is able to infect and grow in macrophages
[33] and to kill G. mellonella larvae [19]. However, the
pathogenesis of B. mallei infection in G. mellonella may
be quite different from the pathogenesis of B. thailandensis or B. pseudomallei infection we report here.
Whereas we recorded larval death by 24 hrs post challenge with typical B. pseudomallei isolates, larval deaths
occurred over the period 24 - 144 hrs post challenge
with B. mallei [19]. This might be explained by the
restricted host range of the obligate intracellular bacterium B. mallei compared to B. pseudomallei with its
much more versatile genome [34].

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that murine macrophage cell
culture or Galleria infection models can be used to discriminate B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis isolates on the basis of their virulence. In
general, our results support the proposal that the virulence of isolates in these models reflects virulence in
murine models of disease. However, some important
exceptions merit further investigation which is not within
the scope of this study. Our finding that virulence of
three B. pseudomallei isolates with high, intermediate
and low virulence in mice is reflected in their virulence
in cell culture or Galleria infection models indicates the
potential value of these models for the identification of
virulence-associated genes. Our findings support the proposal that B. oklahomensis isolates are of low virulence
and indicate that these isolates are defective in growth in
macrophages and in actin-based motility within cells.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

The Burkholderia strains used in this study are summarised in Table 1. All strains were grown in LB broth
with aeration or on LB agar plates at 37°C unless otherwise stated. When appropriate, antibiotics (SigmaAldrich) were used at the following concentrations,
unless otherwise stated: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml; and gentamicin, 50 μg/ml.
Cell lines

J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell lines were maintained
at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone),
1% L-glutamine (250 mM) (Hyclone) and 1% Penicillin/
Streptomycin solution (Hyclone).
Construction of fluorescent reporter plasmids

The construction of the red fluorescent reporter plasmid
used for confocal-laser scanning microscopy was performed in several steps. Firstly, a multiple cloning site

Page 8 of 11

(MCS) was introduced into the commercially available,
mobilisable broad host range vector pBHR1 (MoBiTec;
KmR, CmR) by excising a 1.6-kb BstBI fragment containing a MCS within the lacZ gene and the chloramphenicol resistance gene from plasmid pBBR-MCS1 [35] and
cloning it into the 4.5-kb fragment that resulted from
cutting pBHR1 with BstBI. The resulting plasmids
pBHR-MCS1 and pBHR-MCS2 contained the lacZ-cat
insert in different orientations; only pBHR-MCS1
was used further. Next, a transcriptional terminator
sequence encoded by rrnB was PCR amplified using
primers rrnB-KpnI-fw (5’-TAAGGTACCCGGGG
ATCCTCTAGAGTCG-3’) and rrnB-KpnI-rv (5’CGCGGTACCAAGAGTTTGTAGAAACGCAAA-3’),
which both included KpnI-site overhangs, and plasmid
pSCrhaB1 [36] as a template. The 472-bp PCR fragment
was digested with KpnI and cloned into pBHR-MCS1.
The correct orientation of the rrnB insert in the resulting plasmid pBHR1-MR was confirmed by PCR using
primers rrnB-fw (5’-TCAGAAGTGAAACGCCGTAG3’) and cat1-rv (5’-ACGTGGCCAATATGGACAAC-3’).
Next, a synthetic gene encoding a variant of the far-red
fluorescent protein TurboFP635 (scientific name
Katushka) was obtained from Source BioScience (formerly Geneservice). The variant turboFP635 sequence
had been adapted to the codon bias of B. pseudomallei
and was preceded by a SpeI site and followed by an
EcoRV site. The 810-bp turboFP635 gene was cut from
the cloning vector and cloned into EcoRV/SpeI restricted
pBHR1-MR, resulting in plasmid pBHR1-RFP. Finally, a
443-bp fragment spanning the upstream region of the
groES gene on chromosome I of B. pseudomallei strain
K96243 (BPSL2698) was PCR amplified using primers
groESprom-fw (5’-CTTGAGCTCGAACGTCGATTCGGACGCAT-3’) and groESprom-rv (5’-GCGGACTAGTATTCACTCCTCTCTTTGATT-3’), which included
SacI and SpeI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR
product was cloned into pBHR1-RFP via its SacI/SpeI
sites, resulting in plasmid pBHR1-groS-RFP (Km R ,
Cm R ). For use in intracellular replication assays, the
kanamycin resistance cassette of plasmid pBHR1 and
the derivatives described had to be eliminated by the
following method. Firstly, unmethylated pBHR1 plasmid
DNA isolated from a dcm - /dam - E. coli strain C2925
(New England Biolabs) was cut with StuI/PpuMI, which
resulted in a 1.2-kb fragment encompassing the kanamycin resistance cassette and a 4.1-kb plasmid backbone
fragment. The 4.1-kb fragment was treated with T4
DNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and re-ligated overnight at
15°C resulting in plasmid pBHR4 (CmR). Finally, a 1-kb
fragment representing the cat gene of plasmid pBHR4
was replaced by a 3.2-kb fragment of plasmid pBHR1groS-RFP, which encompassed the RFP gene linked to

Wand et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/11

the groES promoter, the rrnB terminator and the cat
gene, via BstBI restriction as described for the construction of pBHR-MCS1&2. This resulted in plasmid
pBHR4-groS-RFP (CmR).
Macrophage uptake and intracellular survival assays

Burkholderia uptake and survival were quantified utilising
a modified kanamycin protection assay. An overnight culture of bacteria was pelleted and resuspended at 1 × 106
cells/ml in Leibovitz L-15 medium supplemented with
L-glutamine and L-Amino acids (Gibco). The bacterial
suspensions were then added onto J774A.1 murine macrophages that had been seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well
plates, thereby resulting in a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 10:1. The monolayers were incubated at 37°C for
2 hrs to allow bacterial internalisation to occur. Cells were
washed with PBS and L-15 medium containing 250 μg/ml
kanamycin was added to suppress the growth of extracellular bacteria. At appropriate time points, cells were
washed with warm PBS and lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 in
PBS for 5 mins. The lysis mixture was diluted and appropriate dilutions plated out on LB agar plates which were
then incubated overnight at 37°C to allow bacteria to
grow. All experiments were performed in triplicate with
three technical replicates each.
Cytotoxicity Assay (LDH assay)

Culture supernatants were harvested from infected
J774A.1 macrophage monolayers at various time points
as described above. The LDH assay was carried out
using a CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega).
Results were analysed using a Biorad Model 680 plate
reader at OD 490 nm. Supernatants from uninfected
macrophages were used as a control and the observed
OD 490 nm readings were subtracted from the sample
readings in order to correct for the background. All
experiments were performed in triplicate with three
technical replicates each.
Multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation

J774A.1 macrophages were infected as already described.
At appropriate time points, cells were washed with PBS
and acid ethanol treated (5% acetic acid (v/v), 5% dH2O
and 90% Ethanol (v/v)) for 30 mins at room temperature. Cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and
stained with Giemsa solution (0.1% w/v) for 30 mins at
room temperature. After washing with dH2O, cells were
allowed to dry before being visualised under a light
microscope. At least 10 fields per view at 10 × magnification were analysed for the percentage of MNGCs,
where a cell was considered a MNGC if 3 or more
nuclei were present.

Confocal microscopy

J774A.1 macrophages grown on glass coverslips placed
at the bottom of 24-well plates were infected with Burkholderia strains transformed with plasmid pBHR4groS-RFP at an MOI of 10 as already described. At
appropriate time points, cells were washed three times
with warm PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 mins at room temperature. Cells were washed three
times with PBS for 5 mins each before permealising the
cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 mins at
room temperature. After three more washes in PBS, filamentous actin was stained with 1 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin
conjugate solution (Sigma) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. After several washes in PBS to remove
unbound phalloidin conjugate, coverslips were mounted
onto microscopy slides using Vectashield mounting
medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Samples were analysed using a ZEISS LSM510 Meta confocal-laser scanning microscope.
Galleria mellonella killing assays

Wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) were purchased
from Livefood UK Ltd (Rooks Bridge, Somerset, UK)
and were maintained on wood chips in the dark at 15°C
until used. Bacteria from overnight cultures were
adjusted to a known concentration in PBS and a
Hamilton syringe was used to inject 10 μl aliquots of
this suspension into G. mellonella larvae. Injections
were performed into the haemocoel of 10 larvae per
bacterial strain via the foremost left proleg. Control larvae were either injected with 10 μl of PBS in order to
measure any potential lethal effects of the injection process, or not injected to measure the effects of the incubation procedure. After injection, larvae were incubated
statically at 37°C inside petridishes and the number of
dead larvae was scored periodically. Larvae were considered dead when they displayed no movement in
response to gentle prodding with a pipette tip. To determine intracellular bacterial numbers, infected larvae
were placed on ice for 20 mins before the bottom 2 mm
of each larva was aseptically removed and the haemocoel was drained into a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
tube on ice. This was then serially diluted in LB medium and appropriate dilutions were plated out onto LB
agar plates supplemented with gentamicin, which were
incubated overnight at 37°C to allow bacteria to grow.
All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Statistical analysis

Differences between mean values were tested for significance by performing unpaired, two-tailed Student’s
t-tests using the GraphPad Prism software version
5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA).
