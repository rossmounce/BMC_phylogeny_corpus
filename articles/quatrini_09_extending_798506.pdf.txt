Abstract
Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans gains energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron and various reduced
inorganic sulfur compounds at very acidic pH. Although an initial model for the electron pathways involved in iron
oxidation has been developed, much less is known about the sulfur oxidation in this microorganism. In addition,
what has been reported for both iron and sulfur oxidation has been derived from different A. ferrooxidans strains,
some of which have not been phylogenetically characterized and some have been shown to be mixed cultures. It
is necessary to provide models of iron and sulfur oxidation pathways within one strain of A. ferrooxidans in order
to comprehend the full metabolic potential of the pangenome of the genus.
Results: Bioinformatic-based metabolic reconstruction supported by microarray transcript profiling and
quantitative RT-PCR analysis predicts the involvement of a number of novel genes involved in iron and sulfur
oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC23270. These include for iron oxidation: cup (copper oxidase-like), ctaABT
(heme biogenesis and insertion), nuoI and nuoK (NADH complex subunits), sdrA1 (a NADH complex accessory
protein) and atpB and atpE (ATP synthetase F0 subunits). The following new genes are predicted to be involved
in reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation: a gene cluster (rhd, tusA, dsrE, hdrC, hdrB, hdrA, orf2, hdrC, hdrB)
encoding three sulfurtransferases and a heterodisulfide reductase complex, sat potentially encoding an ATP
sulfurylase and sdrA2 (an accessory NADH complex subunit). Two different regulatory components are predicted
to be involved in the regulation of alternate electron transfer pathways: 1) a gene cluster (ctaRUS) that contains
a predicted iron responsive regulator of the Rrf2 family that is hypothesized to regulate cytochrome aa3 oxidase
biogenesis and 2) a two component sensor-regulator of the RegB-RegA family that may respond to the redox
state of the quinone pool.
Conclusion: Bioinformatic analysis coupled with gene transcript profiling extends our understanding of the iron
and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation pathways in A. ferrooxidans and suggests mechanisms for their
regulation. The models provide unified and coherent descriptions of these processes within the type strain,
eliminating previous ambiguity caused by models built from analyses of multiple and divergent strains of this
microorganism.

Background
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic γ-proteobacterium that uses energy and electrons derived from the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II))
and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) for carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation and other anabolic
processes. It is a member of a consortium of microorganisms used for industrial copper recovery (bioleaching or
biomining) and gold recovery (biooxidation) and contributes to the geobiochemical recycling of metals and
nutrients in pristine and contaminated acid-rich environments.
When A. ferrooxidans requires reducing power it is confronted by a particularly challenging bioenergetic problem because the standard reduction half-potential of the
Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple (+0.77 V at pH 2, the pH of the
medium) is much more positive than that of the NAD(P)/
NAD(P)H couple (-0.32 V at the cytoplasmic pH 7). This
means that electrons have to be "pushed uphill" from
Fe(II) to NAD(P) against the redox potential gradient
(uphill pathway). The energy to accomplish this was proposed to come from the proton motive force that naturally occurs across the periplasmic membrane of A.
ferrooxidans (outside = pH 2, inside = pH 7). It was further

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/394

suggested that protons, entering the cell through a membrane associated ATP synthetase, could be consumed during the reduction of oxygen to water (2e- + 1/2 O2 + 2H+
→ H2O) in which electrons for this reaction come from
the oxidation of Fe(II) in a pathway that is thermodynamically favorable (downhill pathway). These ideas were first
promulgated based upon theoretical considerations by
Ingledew [1] but the model has been extended more
recently and major parts of it are now supported by experimental evidence (reviewed in [2]).
According to the model (see Figure 1), components
involved in the downhill electron pathway from Fe(II) to
oxygen include: an outer membrane high molecularweight cytochrome c encoded by cyc2, a gene of unknown
function (ORF1), a periplasmic soluble blue copper protein rusticyanin encoded by rus, a periplasmic membranebound dihemic cytochrome c4 encoded by cyc1 and a terminal cytochrome oxidase of the aa3-type encoded by the
coxBACD gene cluster [3-6]. In A. ferrooxidans ATCC 33020
these genes are cotranscribed in an eight gene transcriptional unit, termed the rus operon that is upregulated in
Fe(II)-grown cells [5,7]. Gene context analysis of the
recently annotated genomic sequence of A. ferrooxidans

Figure 1
Model of Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270
Model of Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. The flow of electrons is shown from the oxidation of Fe+2 by
Cyc2 to reduce oxygen via the aa3 complex (downhill pathway) or to reduce NAD+ via bc1/quinone pool/NADH complex
(uphill pathway). The downhill pathway can consume protons entering via the ATPase complex helping to drive ATP synthesis
or via the bc1/quinone pool/NADH complex that drives the flow of electrons in the uphill pathway. The switch point between
the downhill and uphill flow is suggested to be at the level of rusticyanin (Rus). Abbreviations used can be found in the text.

type strain ATCC 23270 demonstrates that the rus operon
is similarly organized in this strain [8].
The uphill components include: a cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase), the
quinone pool and a NADH1 dehydrogenase complex
(hereafter abbreviated to NADH complex) functioning in
reverse [9-11]. Genetic and biophysical evidence obtained
for A. ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 and ATCC 33020 support
this view [11-13]. In these two strains, the genes encoding
the bc1 complex have been shown to be part of a five-gene
operon, termed the petI operon, mainly transcribed in
Fe(II) conditions and organized as following: a diheme
cytochrome c4 (cycA1), a short-chain dehydrogenase
(sdrA1) of unknown function, a cytochrome b (petA1), an
iron-sulfur protein Rieske (petB1), and a cytochrome c1
(petC1) [2,12,13]. Based on the cotranscription of the
diheme cytochrome c4 gene (cycA1) with those encoding
the bc1 complex, it was proposed that electrons from the
diheme cytochrome c4 take a thermodynamically uphill
pathway via the bc1 complex to a NADH complex driven
energetically by proton motive force [2,12-14] (see Figure
1). Adjacent to the petI operon, is a three gene (resBC and
a hypothetical gene) operon in which ResBC are predicted
to be chaperones involved in heme insertion in c-type
cytochromes, possibly those involved in the maturation
of the c1 cytochrome of the bc1 complex [12]. The petI
operon is similarly organized and transcribed in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 [14] supporting this model.
The bifurcation in the flow of electrons from Fe(II) to
reduce either NAD (uphill) or O2 (downhill) has been
proposed to occur at the level of rusticyanin, a small periplasmic blue copper protein [2,13,14] (see Figure 1). By
adjusting the flow of electrons at this branch point, it was
suggested that A. ferrooxidans could balance its requirements for NADH and ATP [9].
The components involved in both the uphill and downhill electron flow have been shown to form a Fe-oxidizing/O2-reducing supercomplex spanning both inner and
outer membranes in an unnamed strain of A. ferrooxidans
[15] supporting previous models. The supercomplex has
also been suggested to include a copper containing protein (ORF1) physically associated with the periplasmic
Cyc1 that is proposed to be involved in downhill electron
flow. In addition, in vitro reconstitution of the iron oxidation system of the A. ferrooxidans type strain with rusticyanin, aa3-type cytochrome oxidase, the cytochromes c
Cyc2 and Cyc1 has been reported recently [16].
Despite progress in understanding iron oxidation in the
Acidithiobacillus genus, several lacunae in our knowledge
persist, such as the identification of components involved
in the proposed connection between the bc1/quinone

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/394

complex and the NADH complex, the identification of the
chaperones used for cofactor insertion into the relevant
redox proteins, and the mechanisms and components regulating the electron flux via the downhill pathway to O2
versus the uphill pathway to the NADH complex.
Reduced inorganic sulfur oxidation is widespread in
prokaryotes (reviewed in [17,18]. However, in contrast to
iron that occurs in only two oxidation states, sulfur exists
in multiple states from -2 to +6, complicating identification of intermediates and relevant enzymes in sulfur oxidation. Also, some sulfur compounds can be oxidized
abiotically adding further difficulties in resolving enzymatic steps from chemical changes. Despite these difficulties, several biological pathways for RISCs oxidation have
been identified including the phylogenetically widespread sulfur oxidizing (sox) gene pathway (reviewed in
[17]) and the archaeal type sulfur oxygenase reductase
(sor) gene system (reviewed in [19]). However, neither sox,
nor sor have been detected in the genome of A. ferrooxidans
[2,8], raising the question as to how this organism oxidizes RISCs.
Much of our knowledge of RISCs oxidation in A. ferrooxidans comes from enzyme assays performed many years
ago on different strains, some of which await phylogenetic
characterization or, in some cases, have not yet even been
isolated as pure cultures [2]. Those that have been characterized form genetically diverse clusters with at least three
phylogenetic groups [20-23]. This raises the possibility
that current models of RISCs oxidation reflect a patchwork assemblage of predicted pathways and activities that
may not exist in toto in any one A. ferrooxidans strains and
perhaps more accurately reflect the pangenomic capacity
of the genus Acidithiobacillus for RISCs oxidation.
Thus the current investigation was prompted by the need
to generate a more comprehensive picture of iron and sulfur bioenergetics by searching for missing steps and predicting novel enzymatic and electron transfer components
and to provide a coherent picture of these processes in one
strain of A. ferrooxidans (type strain, ATCC 23270), facilitating the recognition of species variation in bioenergetic
pathways.

Results and Discussion
General Features of the Transcriptional Profiles
RNA, isolated from mid-log A. ferrooxidans grown in either
sulfur (S0) or ferrous iron (Fe(II)) medium, was used to
probe gene expression using microarrays displaying
unique oligonucleotides representing about 3000 predicted genes of the A. ferrooxidans type strain genome.
Using statistical criteria described previously [14], a 1.5
log ratio of median cut-off (corresponding to genes
induced more than 2.8 fold) was selected as indicating

differential gene expression in the two growth conditions
(Table 1[7,24,25], Table 2[24-29] and Additional file
1[7,24-26,29]). The expression patterns observed with the
microarrays were validated for some relevant genes by
real-time quantitative PCR (Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]). One
hundred and ninety four genes presented a differential
expression profile, of which 110 were upregulated (up to
38 fold) while 84 were downregulated (up to 10 fold) in
iron compared to sulfur medium. Genes exhibiting differential expression were grouped by hierarchical clustering
and were found to be mostly associated with unknown
functions, energy metabolism, cell envelope and central
intermediary processes (Additional file 1[7,24-26,29]).
Extending the current model of Fe(II) oxidation
The rus operon was induced in Fe(II)-grown cells (Table
1[7,24,25] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]) supporting the
current model of the involvement of Cyc2, rusticyanin,
Cyc1 and cytochrome oxidase in the oxidation of Fe(II)
and the downhill electron transfer chain terminating in
the reduction of oxygen to water (Figure 1).

Embedded in the rus gene operon, is a hypothetical gene
of unknown function (ORF1, AFE_3151). Its genetic linkage and congruent transcriptional activity suggest that it is
involved in Fe(II) oxidation (Table 1[7,24,25] and Table
3[7,24-26,28,29]). In agreement with these data, highest
expression of ORF1 was detected in iron-compared to sulfur-grown ATCC 33020 cells [7]. ORF1 exhibits weak similarity to the putative type-3 multicopper oxidase from
Halorubrum lacusprofundi (30% similarity, e-value: 8e-05)
and to the predicted outer membrane type 3 multicopper
oxidase protein Pan1 from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (32%
similarity; e-value: 3e-04). It also exhibits weak similarity
to rusticyanin including conservation of three out of its
four critical copper binding residues. In addition, EPR
analysis suggests that ORF1 contains copper [30]. We propose the name Cup (cupredoxin-like) for ORF1. A possible function for Cup is to deliver copper either to aa3
cytochrome oxidase or to rusticyanin. The well documented proteins Sco and Cox1 that are involved in copper
delivery to copper-containing proteins in other organisms
[31] have been not detected in A. ferrooxidans [8] and Cup
may have assumed their role. Given its similarity to rusticyanin, an alternate hypothesis is that Cup is involved in
electron transfer perhaps between Cyc2 and Cyc1 bypassing rusticyanin. Two arguments in favor of this hypothesis
are: 1) Cup has been shown experimentally to be physically associated with Cyc1 and not with rusticyanin [15],
and 2) Cup is bound to the outer membrane likely facing
the periplasm [Amouric, Yarzabal and Bonnefoy, unpublished results]. Cup could provide an alternative route for
electron flow during iron oxidation and an additional
point for its regulation.

Immediately downstream of the rus operon is a cluster of
six genes, upregulated in iron (Table 1[7,24,25] and Table
3[7,24-26,28,29]), that are predicted to be involved in
cytochrome aa3 oxidase biogenesis (ctaABT) and ironresponsive regulation of cytochrome aa3 oxidase biogenesis (ctaRUS): ctaA (AFE_3144) encoding an integral
membrane protein with 7 out of 8 His located in transmembrane regions similar to heme A synthase CtaA ([32]
and references therein), ctaB (AFE_3143) encoding a
heme O synthase and ctaT (AFE_3142) encoding an integral membrane protein belonging to the major facilitator
family transporter that could be involved in the exportation of heme A to cytochrome oxidase [33] (Figure 1);
ctaR (AFE_3141) predicted to encode an iron responsive
regulator [34] of the Rrf2 family that in T. denitrificans is
clustered with cbb3 cytochrome oxidase biogenesis genes
(data not shown), ctaU (AFE_3139) encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function and ctaS (AFE_3138)
encoding a predicted Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily member of unknown function. Immediately
downstream but transcribed in the other direction, are
two genes regBA (AFE_3136-3137), also upregulated in
iron (Table 1[7,24,25] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]), that
are predicted to encode a sensor/regulator two-component signal transduction system of the RegB/RegA family
with similarity to RegBA of Rhodobacter capsulatus. RegA
directly controls synthesis of cytochrome cbb3 and ubiquinol oxidases that function as terminal electron acceptors
in a branched respiratory chain [35]. Given the sequence
similarity of the predicted A. ferrooxidans RegA with that of
R. capsulatus, the conservation of the quinone binding site
in the membrane spanning domain and of the redox
active cysteine in the cytoplasmic transmitter domain of
RegB, we propose that it is also involved in redox sensing.
Because of the regBA juxtaposition to genes predicted to
encode cytochrome aa3 oxidase biogenesis, this cytochrome oxidase is a likely candidate for the target of
RegBA regulation in A. ferrooxidans. However, in R. capsulatus, RegBA also regulates other genes involved in respiratory electron components such as cytochromes c2, c(y)
and the cytochrome bc1 complex, so that the actual RegBA
target(s) in A. ferrooxidans requires experimental evaluation. RegBA of R. capsulatus have been shown to respond
to the status of the aerobic respiratory chain, most likely
the ubiquinone pool in the membrane [36] and, if this
also proves to be the case in A. ferrooxidans, RegBA could
help in making regulatory changes to balance electron
equivalents between uphill and downhill electron flow,
perhaps by adjusting the proportion of cytochrome Cyc1
and cytochrome oxidase aa3 (downhill electron flow) to
the cytochrome CycA1 and the cytochrome bc1 complex
(uphill electron flow). Alternately, RegBA could play a
role in switching between iron and sulfur oxidation or
between aerobic and anaerobic oxidation. It is clear that
the discovery of the predicted iron and redox responsive

Gene expression values (log2 ratio of median) for all genes/operons alluded in the revised model of Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270.
Genes with a log2 ratio of median larger than |1.5| (corresponding to genes induced more than 2.8 fold) are considered differentially expressed
(indicated with *) and genes p-value <0,005 are considered significant. Gene ID is that of Genbank genome annotation NC 011761. The reference
and the strain in which the level of the gene product has been shown to be higher in Fe(II) than in S0 conditions are indicated in the last column. ND:
not determined.

regulators CtaRUS and RegAB will now allow the experimental biologist to focus on important regulatory
switches that are most likely to be involved in cellular
decisions related to energy metabolism.
The petI operon was also induced in Fe(II) medium (Table
1[7,24,25] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]) supporting the
current model for the role of the bc1 complex in the uphill
flow of electrons during iron oxidation (Figure 1).
Embedded within the petI operon is sdrA1 (AFE_3108)
whose function remains unknown. SdrA1 has the characteristic NAD(P) binding site at its N-terminus (TGAGEGIG) of Ndu9 which is a subunit of the NADH complex
involved in this complex assembly and stability in a variety of eukaryotes [37]. However, SdrA1 exhibits the conserved catalytic residues (N125, S147, Y166, K170)
involved in electron input into the NADH complex or
electron transfer within the complex, suggesting that this
protein could function as an oxidoreductase [38,39]
(Additional file 2). SdrA1 has been predicted to be situated in the cytoplasm in A. ferrooxidans with a possible
hydrophobic region embedded in the inner membrane
[12] and we hypothesize that it transfers electrons from
the quinone pool to the NADH complex (Figure 1).

Whereas most of the predicted genes encoding the subunits of the NADH complex (AFE_2630-2617) are equally
expressed in Fe(II) and S0 growth conditions, nuoI
(AFE_2622) and nuoK (AFE_2620) are upregulated in
Fe(II) medium (Table 1[7,24,25]). The nuoI encodes a
ferredoxin located in the cytoplasmic arm of the NADH
complex and is involved in the intramolecular electron
transfer between FMN and quinone, whereas nuoK
encodes a membrane subunit thought to be involved in
quinone reduction [40] and in proton translocation [41].
Given the predicted locations of NuoI and NuoK in the
hinge region of the NADH complex [42] and the upregulation of nuoI, nuoK and sdrA1 in Fe(II) growth conditions,
we suggest that they interact to facilitate uphill electron
flow from quinone to the NADH complex (Figure 1).
Whereas most of the genes predicted to encode the ATP
synthetase complex were similarly expressed in Fe(II) and
in S0 grown cells, membrane embedded F0 subunits A and
C, encoded by atpB (AFE_3209) and atpE (AFE_3208)
respectively, were upregulated in Fe(II) growth conditions
(Table 1[7,24,25]). These subunits are involved in proton
translocation across the membrane [43] and their upregulation could allow more protons to pass through the ATP
synthetase complex during Fe(II) oxidation, provided an
increase in ATP synthesis. However, the resulting increase

Gene expression values (log2 ratio of median) for all genes/operons alluded in the revised model of sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270.
Genes with a log2 ratio of median larger than |1.5| (corresponding to genes induced more than 2.8 fold) are considered differentially expressed
(indicated with *) and genes p-value <0,005 are considered significant. Gene ID is that of Genbank genome annotation NC 011761. The reference

of intracellular protons requires a concomitant increase in
intracellular electrons for their neutralization, so as not to
compromise the internal pH of the cell. These electrons
could come from the downhill pathway during Fe(II) oxidation as shown in Figure 1.
The organization and regulation of the components of
Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans appear to be unique to
this organism, although Thiobacillus prosperus strain V6
possesses a transcriptional unit upregulated in iron conditions with some similarity to the rus operon [44]. However, the T. prosperus operon lacks the cyc1 and the rus
genes encoding cytochrome c4 and rusticyanin, respectively. The latter is located downstream from the cluster, is
monocistonic and is expressed in iron and sulfur growth
conditions [44], suggesting different regulatory mechanisms compared to A. ferrooxidans. In Leptospirillum group
II, the electron transfer chain involved in Fe(II) oxidation
contains two cytochromes c and a cbb3 cytochrome oxidase [45-47] but no blue copper protein such as rusticyanin. In the archaea Ferroplasma acidarmanus a blue copper

protein (sulfocyanin) has been suggested to transfer the
electrons from Fe(II) to a cbb3-type terminal oxidase [48].
While the genes encoding four blue copper proteins (two
sulfocyanin-like and two rusticyanin-like) have been
identified in Metallosphaera sedula [49], none of them
respond to the presence of iron in the medium [50]. However, foxA (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and soxNL
(cytochrome b and [2Fe-2S] Rieske) -cbsAB (cytochromes
b) clusters have been predicted to be important for Fe(II)
oxidation in M. sedula. Genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II (foxAB) and CbsA-like cytochrome
b (foxC) have been also proposed to be involved in iron
oxidation in Sulfolobus metallicus [51]. It appears therefore
that different pathways for ferrous iron oxidation have
evolved in prokaryotes.

inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs)

sulfide quinone reductase from NASF-1 strain [26,52],
doxDA (AFE_0044) encoding thiosulfate quinone oxidoreductase from ATCC23270 [53] and from the
CCM4253 strain [54], tetH (AFE_0029) encoding
tetrathionate hydrolase from ATCC23270 [27], cydAB
(AFE_0955-0954) encoding a bd oxidase and cyoABCD
(AFE_0631-0634) encoding a bo3 oxidase from
ATCC19859 [11] (See Figure 2). All these genes are upregulated in sulfur-containing media relatively to Fe(II)
(Table 2[24-29] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]). This is also
the case for the petII operon (AFE_2727-2732) encoding a
second bc1 complex, a cytochrome c4, SdrA2 and a high
potential iron-sulfur protein, Hip, as already reported for
ATCC19859 [11], ATCC33020 [13] and ATCC23270 [14]
strains (Table 2[24-29] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]). This
second bc1 complex has been proposed to function
directly transferring electrons from sulfur to oxygen (Figure 2), and possibly in the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of sulfur and formate described by Pronk et al. [55].
In that case, the bc1 complex receives the electrons from
the quinol pool and transfers them to the membranebound cytochrome c4 CycA2 and/or to the periplasmic
high potential iron-sulfur protein Hip that subsequently
gives the electrons to the terminal oxidase [2,13,14] (Figure 2). SdrA2, like SdrA1 (see above), may promote electron flow from the quinone pool to the NADH complex
(Figure 2). These findings support earlier models of the
branched electron transfer flow during S0 oxidation
[2,11,13,14] (Figure 2). However, this model is far from
being complete and several outstanding questions remain
unanswered, including the identification of the enzymes
that oxidize sulfur and sulfite.
Sulfur
Seven genes, potentially encoding a heterodisulfide
reductase complex HdrABC (AFE_2586 and AFE_25552550) were highly upregulated in cells grown in sulfur
medium (Table 2[24-29] and Table 3[7,24-26,28,29]).
This complex catalyzes the reversible reduction of the
disulfide bond X-S-S-X coupled with energy conservation
in methanogenic archaea ([56] and references therein)
and sulfate reducing archaea and bacteria [57]. This complex in A. ferrooxidans is predicted to have three different
cytoplasmic HdrB subunits (AFE_2586, 2554 and 2550)
with the cysteine-rich domain which binds the unusual
type [4Fe-4S] cluster [58], involved in disulfide reduction
[56,59]. In addition, genes potentially encoding the ferredoxin-like and the flavoprotein subunits, HdrC
(AFE_2555 and 2551) and HdrA (AFE_2553) are present
in the same locus. The flavoprotein HdrA subunit exhibits
a possible N-terminal membrane spanning region, a conserved FAD binding site (GXGXXGX16–19(D/E)), and the
conserved four cysteine cluster (CXGXRDX6–8CSX2CC)
that binds a Fe-S center, typical of the cytoplasmic ironsulfur flavoprotein type enzyme.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/394

Three genes encoding for sulfur metabolism accessory
proteins, placed immediately upstream of the heterodisulfide reductase complex, are similarly upregulated
(Table 2[24-29]). These encode a cytoplasmic rhodanaserelated sulfurtransferase (AFE_2558, COG0607) [60], a
cytoplasmic SirA-like disulfide bond formation regulator
(AFE_2557, pfam01206, COG0425, IPR001455) and an
inner membrane located peroxiredoxin of the DrsE superfamily (AFE_2556, COG2210 and 2044). The rhodanase
AFE_2558 is 48% similar to the Sud protein from
Wolinella succinogenes which binds and transfers
polysulfide sulfur to the polysulfide reductase located in
the cytoplasmic membrane [61,62]. In turn, the SirA-like
protein AFE_2557 is 54% similar to the TusA protein from
Vibrio fischeri and other bacteria which belong to a complex sulfur-relay system that facilitates specific sulfur flow/
trafficking from various pathways [63-65]. Finally, DsrE
family proteins such as that predicted to be encoded by
AFE_2556 are small proteins recently shown to be
involved in sulfur transfer reactions during sulfur oxidation [66].
Significant sequence similarity and conserved gene organization of the A. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase
complex and accessory proteins is restricted only to
Aquifex aeolicus and known acidophilic sulfur oxidizing
microorganisms Hydrogenobaculum sp. Y04AAS1, Hydrogenivirga sp. 128-5-R1-1, Metallosphaera sedula [50], Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, S. tokodaii and S. solfataricus (Figure
3), associating the whole gene cluster with sulfur oxidation. In methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea, HdrA
receives the electrons from the hydrogenase and transfers
them through HdrC to the heterodisulfide reductase catalytic site located in HdrB. Accompanying the reduction of
heterodisulfide, protons are extruded across the membrane creating a proton motive force. We hypothesize that
in A. ferrooxidans and the sulfur oxidizers referred above,
the Hdr complex, driven by the naturally existing proton
gradient, could be working in reverse and oxidizing
disulfide intermediaries (from sulfur oxidation) to sulfite
and delivering the collected electrons to the membrane
quinol pool (Figure 2). In addition, the three accessory
sulfurtransferases are likely involved in the transfer of the
proposed sulfane sulfur [67,68] to the heterodisulfide
reductase (Figure 2).
The predicted A. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase
complex has additional features that are consistent with
its proposed role in RISCs oxidation. Sulfur oxidation in a
variety of different A. ferrooxidans strains has been shown
to require glutathione [67,68] and requires a neutral pH
optimum [67], suggesting a cytoplasmic activity in agreement with the predicted localization of the heterodisulfide reductase catalytic site (Figure 2). Second, nonheme iron and labile sulfur have been shown to be

Figureof sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270
Model 2
Model of sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. Reduced inorganic sulfur compound (RISC) oxidation pathways are predicted to involve various enzymes, enzyme complexes and a number of electron carriers located in different cellular compartments: in the outer membrane facing the periplasm (tetrathionate reductase, TetH), in the periplasm (high potential
iron-sulfur protein, HiPIP), attached to the cytoplasmic membrane on the periplasmic side (cytochrome c, CycA2), in the cytoplasmic membrane (sulfide quinone reductase (SQR), thiosulfate quinone reductase (TQR), bc1 complex, NADH complex I, bd
and bo3 terminal oxidases) and in the cytoplasm (heterodisulfide reductase (HDR), and ATP sulfurylase (SAT)). Insoluble sulfur
is first converted to sulfane sulfate (GSSH) which is then transferred to the heterodisulfide reductase (HDR) through a cascade
of sulfur transferases (DsrE, TusA and Rhd). Electrons coming from sulfide (H2S), thiosulfate (S2O32-) or sulfane sulfate (GSSH)
are transferred via the quinol pool (QH2) either (1) directly to terminal oxidases bd or bo3, or indirectly throught a bc1 complex and a cytochrome c(CycA2) or a high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) probably to the aa3 oxidase where O2 reduction takes place or (2) to NADH complex I to generate reducing power.

present in a sulfur oxidizing enzyme preparation of A. ferrooxidans [67] and iron-sulfur clusters are predicted to be
present in the A. ferrooxidans HdrB and C subunits. Third,
sulfur oxidation has been shown to be inhibited by
HQNO in A. ferrooxidans [69], in agreement with the proposal that the quinone pool is the physiological electron
acceptor (Figure 2). Fourth, the actual substrate of the sulfur oxidizing enzyme in A. ferrooxidans is thought not to
be elemental sulfur, which has poor water solubility and
cannot enter the cell, but rather sulfane sulfur of GSnH
species (n>1) and most likely GSSH [67,68]. Sulfane sulfate would thus provide the necessary disulfide bond X-SS-X to serve as a substrate for the predicted catalytic activ-

ity of the A. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase (Figure
2). Conserved within the heterodisufide reductase gene
cluster, between hdrA and hdrC2, is a putative gene of
unknown function (AFE_2552) whose product is predicted to reside in the cytoplasm (Figure 2). Given its conserved gene context, we propose that it is also involved in
RISCs oxidation and it is now pinpointed for experimental investigation.
Sulfite
Another step in the sulfur oxidation model that awaits
genetic characterization is sulfite oxidation. Being metastable and considered short-lived in mine waste environ-

ments, one possibility is that sulfite rapidly oxidizes nonenzymically to sulfate, thiosulfate or glutathione S-sulfonate in the presence of Fe(III) [70,71] or sulfur [72].
However, the involvement of a protein catalyzing this
reaction is more likely since a sulfite oxidase activity was
purified from three different strains of A. ferrooxidans,
namely TM [73], ATCC13661 [74] and AP19-3 [75,76]
Genes coding for known periplasmic enzymes involved in
the direct oxidation of sulfite during sulfur dissimilatory
metabolism (sorAB or soxCD [77]) have not been detected
in the A. ferrooxidans genome. In our model (Figure 2),
sulfite is hypothesized to be produced in the cytoplasm by
heterodisulfide reductase. Therefore, subsequent oxidation of sulfite is likely to occur in this cellular location and
therefore would not be expected to proceed via the classical periplasmic Sor or Sox. One possibility for the cytoplasmic activity is that sulfite is converted to adenosine-5'phosphosulfate (APS) via the well characterized APS
reductase complex encoded by aprBA [78-80]. However,
the genome contains no candidates with significant similarity to aprBA, although it does have a predicted sat

(AFE_0539) which, in other microorganisms, encodes an
ATP sulfurylase responsible for the second step in this
pathway. The A. ferrooxidans Sat shares 44% identity and
60% similarity with both domains of the bifunctional
SAT/APS kinase from Aquifex aeolicus that catalyzes the
production of ATP and sulfate from APS and pyrophosphate [81,82]. If Sat is indeed catalyzing APS to sulfate
(Figure 2), an enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of sulfite to
APS is required. This missing function could be accomplished by the conserved hypothetical gene embedded in
the hdr locus of sulfur oxidizers (Figure 3). The concordance of gene occurrence and organization between A.
aeolicus, Hydrogenobaculum sp. Y04AAS1 the Sulfolobales
and A. ferrooxidans including 1) the hdr locus with a gene
of unknown function 2) sat and 3) a lack of aprBA,
strongly suggests that these microorganisms have a novel
sulfur oxidation pathway.
Our data agree with the model proposed for S0 oxidation
in M. sedula, including a heterodisulfide reductase (hdr), a
tetrathionate hydrolase (tetH), a terminal oxidase complex based on both quinol oxidase (soxCL) and aa3-type

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:394

cytochrome oxidase (soxAB) components [50]. In S. metallicus, a gene (sor), encoding sulfur oxygenase reductase,
which is absent in A. ferrooxidans, is the dominant transcript in sulfur-grown cells and is therefore proposed to be
involved in sulfur oxidation [51]. In conclusion, the
RISCs oxidation pathways of acidophiles are not only different from those of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizers [17,18]
but also appear to be different among the acidophilic sulfur-oxidizers including between members of the Acidithiobacillus genus [83]. In that sense, the conservation of the
hdr locus in different acidophilic sulfur oxidizers, archaea
and eubacteria, is noteworthy and merits further investigation.
Additional Discussion
Genomic and transcriptomic (microarrays and real-time
quantitative PCR) studies of iron and sulfur energetic
metabolism of A. ferrooxidans, not only confirm previous
data, but elaborate on the complexity of these pathways.
Both iron and RISCs respiratory chains are branched and
redundant [2,11,13,14] (Figures 1 and 2). This provides
A. ferrooxidans with a flexible respiratory system that may
allow it to adapt efficiently to environmental changes by
modulating gene expression according to the growth conditions (substrate, oxygen concentration, growth phase,
etc.). Another way to adapt efficiently to a change in the
growth conditions is by modifying the association of
complexes as suggested recently for iron respiration in A.
ferrooxidans [15]. In the case of the cytochrome c oxidase
complex of Dictyostelium discoideum, the oxygen concentration induces a switch between two interchangeable
subunit isoforms of the cytochrome c oxidase [84-86].
This switch has been shown to be due to transcriptional
regulation and also to different stabilities of the two subunits toward oxygen [86].

Both iron and RISCs oxidation pathways involve outer
membrane, periplasmic and inner membrane components (Figures 1 and 2). According to our hypothesis, several super-complexes spanning the outer and/or the inner
membranes are expected to conduct either the electrons to
the oxygen, or the sulfane-sulfur to the catalytic side of the
herodisulfide reductase, from pyrite (FeS2), which is a natural substrate of A. ferrooxidans. While such a super-complex has been isolated recently for iron oxidation [15], no
biochemical data are available until now to substantiate
the existence of a sulfane-sulfur transfer supramolecular
structure. While a sulfurtransferase complex encoded by
the hdr locus is likely to be involved in the transfer of the
proposed sulfane sulfur to the heterodisulfide reductase
from the inner membrane to the cytoplasm (Figure 2),
expression data suggests no obvious upregulated outer
membrane protein as proposed by Rohwerder and Sand
[68] to allow it to cross the cell wall. We propose also the
existence of a cytoplasmic super-complex catalyzing both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/394

the oxidation of sulfane-sulfur to sulfite and of sulfite to
APS, preventing the accumulation of sulfite in the cytoplasm (Figure 2). While the existence of such a complex
has not been demonstrated in A. ferrooxidans, a thiosulfate-oxidizing system oxidizing hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, sulfur and sulfite directly to sulfate without the
presence of free intermediates has been evidenced in Paracoccus versutus and Paracoccus pantotrophus ([17,87] and
references therein). Moreover, the methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea heterodisulfide reductase forms a
tight complex with the hydrogenase, which catalyzes its
reduction with H2 ([56,57] and references therein). Such
supramolecular structures will allow (1) stabilization of
the different components (2) electron, or sulfane sulfur,
channeling leading to more efficient transfer, and (3) diffusion avoidance preventing toxic compound leakage.

Conclusion
• Bioinformatic analysis coupled with gene transcript
profiling extends our understanding of the iron and
reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation pathways in A. ferrooxidans.
• Novel genes predicted to be involved in iron oxidation (Figure 1) include those potentially encoding: i)
heme biosynthesis and insertion into the terminal
electron acceptor cytochrome aa3 oxidase used in the
downhill flow of electrons from Fe(II) to reduce oxygen to water, ii) subunits of the Fo ATP synthetase that
may be an adaptation to extremely low pHs encountered during iron oxidation, iii) a copper-containing
protein that may be involved in electron transfer or in
copper insertion, iv) two subunits and one predicted
accessory protein of the NADH complex that may promote the flow of electrons from the quinone pool to
the NADH complex during uphill electron flow and v)
two potential regulators of alternate electron pathways
predicted to respond to iron and the status of the quinone pool respectively.
• Novel genes predicted to be involved in RISCs oxidation (Figure 2) include those potentially encoding: i)
three sulfurtransferases, ii) a heterodisulfide reductase
complex, iii) an ATP sulfurylase and iv) a NADH complex accessory protein that may promote uphill electron flow from the quinone pool to the NADH
complex during RISCs oxidation.
• The models (Figures 1 and 2) provide unified and
coherent descriptions of iron and RISCs oxidation and
suggests mechanisms for their regulation within the
type strain, eliminating previous confusion caused by
models built from analyses of multiple and divergent
strains of this microorganism.

• The identification of differentially expressed genes of
unknown function predicted to be involved in iron
and RISCs oxidation direct the experimental biologist
to future research.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
A. ferrooxidans type strain ATCC 23270 was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. A. ferrooxidans was
grown at 30°C under oxic conditions with 200 rpm agitation in (i) Fe(II)-medium (62 mM FeSO4-7H2O in basal
salts solution ((NH4)2SO4: 0.4 g. L-1, K2HPO4: 0.4 g. L-1,
MgSO4-7H2O: 0.4 g. L-1 adjusted to pH 1.6 with H2SO4 or
(ii) S0-medium (1% (w/v) elemental sulfur in basal salts
solution ((NH4)2SO4: 0.4 g. L-1, K2HPO4: 0.4 g. L-1,
MgSO4-7H2O: 0.4 g. L-1 adjusted to pH 3.5 with H2SO4).
When reaching mid-logarithmic phase cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and washed with basal salt
solution (pH adjusted). To remove iron traces or sulfur
particles before further treatment several cycles of washing
and 1 minute low speed spin-centrifugations were performed. Clean cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until used for RNA extraction.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted using a modified acid-phenol
extraction method [88], including a preliminary TRIZOL®
reagent (Invitrogen) extraction step. This RNA was used
directly for cDNA synthesis and labeling. For real-time
PCR, RNAs were additionally purified with the High Pure
RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Biosystem) and treated
twice with DNAse I (Roche Applied Biosystem). The lack
of DNA contamination was checked by PCR on each RNA
sample.
Microarray production
A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 oligonucleotide microarrays
were designed and produced in-house. Internal 50-mers
targeting each of the 3037 putative ORFs predicted in the
genomic sequence of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (TIGR
release September 2003; 2.98 Mb) were selected using the
Oligoarray software (Version 1.0), synthesized by MWG
Biotech and spotted in duplicate on Gamma Amino Propyl Silane Corning UltraGAPS slides, according to the
manufacturer's instructions, with a ChipWriterProarrayer
(Bio-Rad, 1000 Alfred Nobel Drive Hercules, CA) at the
Marseille-Nice Genopole (France). A special set of control
oligonucleotides (negative, positive, tiled and antisense
sequences) was included to evaluate probe specificity and
adjust the hybridization conditions. 50-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the CDS of the gfp gene from
Aequorea sp. (L29345), the rad9 gene form Saccharomyces
cereviciae (M26049) and the idi2 gene from human
(AK303669) were used as negative controls. The array
design and spotting protocol were deposited in ArrayEx-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/394

press database [89] under the accession codes A-MEXP1478 and A-MEXP-1479.
Microarray experimental design
This experiment consisted of 8 independent hybridizations using total RNA obtained from 2 different iron(FeIIA and FeIIB) and 2 different sulfur-replicate cultures
(S°A and S°B). Each RNA sample was labeled once with
each dye (e.g. S0 A_Cy®5 and S0 A_Cy®3) and hybridized
against a reciprocally labeled cDNA sample (e.g.
FeIIA_Cy®3 and FeIIA_Cy®5). The cDNAs obtained for
each biological replicate (e.i. A or B) were cohybridized
against two different types of microarrays obtained in different spotting campaigns (Oligoarray v.1 or Oligoarray
v.2). More details of the experimental design are available
in the ArrayExpress database under the accession code EMEXP-1990.
Labeling and hybridization
The ChipShot™ Labeling Clean-Up System (PromegaCorning) was used to generate fluorescently labeled cDNA
via direct incorporation of Cy®3 and Cy®5-labeled nucleotides (Amersham Biosciences). The reverse transcription
reaction was performed in the presence of 5 μg total RNA
and random hexamers according to manufacturer's recommendations. Two independent cDNA preparations
were labeled once with each dye (reverse dye labeling) to
account for sampling differences, biases in dye coupling
or emission efficiency of Cy®-dyes. Labeled cDNA was
purified from contaminating fluorescent dNTPs and
degraded RNA using the ChipShot Labeling Clean-Up System (Promega-Corning). Dye incorporation efficiency
was determined by absorbance readings at 260, 550 and
650 nm and the frequency of incorporation (FOI, pmol of
dye incorporated per ng of cDNA) was calculated according to Promega's instructions. Optimally labeled samples
were combined, vacuum-dried and resuspended to a final
volume of 40–50 μL in Corning Pronto! Universal
Hybridization Buffer. The combined denatured target
cDNA samples (95°C for 5 min) were hybridized to the
spotted slides for 14 h at 42°C in the Corning hybridization chamber. Following hybridization, slides were
washed in serial dilutions of Corning Wash Buffers as recommended by the manufacturer and dried by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 2 min.
Image acquisition and data analysis
Microarrays were scanned for the Cy®3 and Cy®5 fluorescent signals using the ScanArray 5000 Microarray Analysis
System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.). Scans stored as
16-bit TIFF (Tagged Information File Format) image files
and then analyzed with the image quantification software
package GenePix Pro 6.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Saturated and low-quality spots (spots smaller than 60 μm or
bigger than 160 μm in diameter, sub-circular in shape

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:394

and/or exhibiting uneven fluorescence distribution) were
flagged and filtered out. Local background was subtracted
from the recorded spot intensities and median values for
each spot were Log transformed (log2) and normalized by
average intensity of each slide to account for any difference in total intensity between the scanned images using
the Acuity microarray analysis software (Version 4.0, Axon
Instrument Inc.). The processed Fe(II) and S0 signal intensities for each spot were used for calculating the expression ratio Fe(II)/S0. Twenty four replicate ratio values per
gene, resulting from direct and reverse labeling, replicate
spots and replicate experiments, were used for further statistical analysis of the data. The statistical significance of
differential expression in Fe(II) or S0 grown cells, was
assessed using Acuity package. The raw data, as well as the
processed (filtered and Median normalized) data, for all
hybridizations was submitted to the ArrayExpress database and is available under the accession code E-MEXP1990. A 1.5 fold deviations from the 1:1 hybridization
ratio was taken as indicative of differential gene expression in the two growth conditions analyzed. Hierarchical
cluster analysis (Pearson correlation, average linkage) was
performed using Genesis software suit [90]. Functional
annotations were retrieved from Valdés et al. [8].
Real-time quantitative PCR
The relative abundances of a set of differentially expressed
genes and a set of invariant genes, according to the microarray results obtained, were determined in Fe(II)- and S0grown cells by real-time PCR. Specific primers for the
genes of interest amplifying average products of 300 bp
with about 50 GC% and about 55°C Tm were designed
(Additional file 3). Equal amounts of A. ferrooxidans DNAseI-treated total RNA were retro-transcribed from these
primers with the Superscript II™ RNase (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) at 42°C for 50 min, and then treated at
70°C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. The real-time
PCR quantifications were performed on the cDNA
obtained, using the Light-Cycler instrument and the LightCycler Fast Start DNA master (plus) SYBR Green I PCR kit
(Roche Applied Biosystems) with external standards as
described in Roche Molecular Biochemicals technical note
no. LC 11/2000. The real-time PCR experiments were performed twice, with both independent total RNA and
cDNA preparations by the comparative threshold cycle
method. The calculated threshold cycle (Ct) for each gene
was normalized to Ct of the rrs gene.
Bioinformatic analysis
The sequence and annotation of the complete A. ferrooxidans strain ATCC 23270 genome was retrieved from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ (CP001219). Functional assignments
for hypothetical and predicted genes of interest were performed manually on a gene-by-gene basis. Amino acid
sequences for these genes were used to query the follow-
