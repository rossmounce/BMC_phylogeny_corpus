Abstract
Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is the prototype representative of the pestivirus
genus in the Flaviviridae family. It has been shown that the initiation of translation of BVDV RNA
occurs by an internal ribosome entry mechanism mediated by the 5' untranslated region of the viral
RNA [1]. The 5' and 3' boundaries of the IRES of the cytopathic BVDV NADL have been mapped
and it has been suggested that the IRES extends into the coding of the BVDV polyprotein [2]. A
putative pseudoknot structure has been recognized in the BVDV 5'UTR in close proximity to the
AUG start codon. A pseudoknot structure is characteristic for flavivirus IRESes and in the case of
the closely related classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and the more distantly related Hepatitis C
virus (HCV) pseudoknot function in translation has been demonstrated.
Results: To characterize the BVDV IRESes in detail, we studied the BVDV translational initiation
by transfection of dicistronic expression plasmids into mammalian cells. A region coding for the
amino terminus of the BVDV SD-1 polyprotein contributes considerably to efficient initiation of
translation. The translation efficiency mediated by the IRES of BVDV strains NADL and SD-1
approximates the poliovirus type I IRES directed translation in BHK cells. Compared to the
poliovirus IRES increased expression levels are mediated by the BVDV IRES of strain SD-1 in
murine cell lines, while lower levels are observed in human cell lines. Site directed mutagenesis
revealed that a RNA pseudoknot upstream of the initiator AUG is an important structural element
for IRES function. Mutants with impaired ability to base pair in stem I or II lost their translational
activity. In mutants with repaired base pairing either in stem 1 or in stem 2 full translational activity
was restored. Thus, the BVDV IRES translation is dependent on the pseudoknot integrity. These
features of the pestivirus IRES are reminiscent of those of the classical swine fever virus, a
pestivirus, and the hepatitis C viruses, another genus of the Flaviviridae.
Conclusion: The IRES of the non-cytopathic BVDV SD-1 strain displays features known from
other pestivirus IRESes. The predicted pseudoknot in the 5'UTR of BVDV SD-1 virus represents
an important structural element in BVDV translation.

Introduction
The pestiviruses like bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV),
classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus
(BDV) are the causative agents of economically important
diseases of cattle, pigs and sheep. Due to similarities in
genome organization and structure of the 5 'UTRs pestiviruses are distantly related to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Pestiviruses and hepatitis C virus are small, enveloped viruses
containing single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genomes 10–
12 kb in length. The mRNA contains one long open reading frame coding for a polyprotein. The coding region is
preceded by a highly-structured 5' UTR of 300–400 nt in
length harboring multiple AUGs which are not used for
initiation of translation. Previous investigations showed
that translation initiation in BVDV, CSFV and HCV occurs
by an internal ribosomal entry mechanism [1-8]. The
HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been investigated in detail and the delimitation of the IRES, as well
as structural pecularities, have been reported [9]. Unlike
the prototype IRES elements of poliovirus or EMCV, the
HCV IRES is relatively short encompassing about 300
nucleotides. Interestingly, the region immediately downstream of the initiator AUG has been found to increase
translational efficiency suggesting that the IRES extends
into the coding region, a feature not found in the IRES of
picornaviruses [10,11]. Remarkably, the HCV IRES as well
as the CSFV IRES contain a functional RNA pseudoknot
structure upstream of the polyprotein initiation site that is
indispensable for internal initiation of translation [3,1214]. In contrast to the popular HCV IRES, less is known
about the BVDV IRES. Hybrid arrest translation experiments, Poole et al. [1] suggested that the initiation of
translation is mediated by a part of the 385 nt long 5' UTR.
Dicistronic transfection experiments demonstrated that
the IRES of the BVDV-NADL strain 5' UTR functions in
BHK and CV1 cells. The 5' border has been mapped and
the requirement of defined regions in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR have been investigated [1,2]. As a 21%
reduction was observed when deleting coding sequences
of the polyprotein in these experiments the IRES seems to
extend into the BVDV NADL coding region [2]. However,
the exact dimension of contributing coding sequences as
well as the importance of the putative pseudoknot region
upstream of the initiator AUG has not yet been addressed.
To characterize the BVDV IRES in detail, we studied the
translational initiation of BVDV strains NADL (cytopathic) and SD-1 (non-cytopathic) after transfection of
dicistronic expression plasmids into BHK cells containing
wild-type and mutagenized BVDV-sequences[15,16]. We
show that the BVDV IRES irrespectively of the pathogenic
properties of the individual strains is a strong ribosomal
entry site. We provide evidence that the BVDV strain SD-1
IRES translational efficiency is increased by BVDV N-terminal non-coding region and contains a RNA pseudoknot
structure that is indispensable for IRES function. These

features exhibit remarkable similarity to the IRES of HCV
and are not common with the IRESes of picornaviruses
represented by the cardioviruses or enteroviruses, emphasizing that BVDV SD-1 IRES matches well into this distinct
group of internal ribosomal landing pads.

Results
Strength of BVDV strains SD-1 and NADL IRES in BHK cells
Transfection of dicistronic vectors is a means to identify
sequences responsible for cap-independent, internal initiation of translation. If the region in question is an IRES,
translation of the second cistron may occur via internal
entry of ribosomes in contrast to re-initiation which is
possible only under very specific conditions. To exclude
re-initiation, stable stem-loops may be included in the
UTR preceding the first cistron to inhibit the scanning of
43S ribosomal complex that entered via the cap-structure.
We have stably transfected into BHK cells expression plasmids pSBCSNADLLUC and pSBCSSD1LUC which carry
the genes for the secreted form of the alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and the firefly luciferase as reporters and
the complete BVDV 5'UTR (NADL strain or SD-1-strain,
respectively) as intercistronic region. For evaluation of the
BVDV IRES strength pSBCSdeltapoLUC and pSBC-SEAPPolio-LUC were chosen which are similar dicistronic
devoid of any IRES or containing the poliovirus type IRES
which is a strong mediator of internal initiation of translation [17]. In these and following experiments Northern
Blot analyses revealed that the dicistronic mRNAs are of
the expected length and no degradation products were
observed which may result from endonucleolytic RNA
cleavage or transcription by a cryptic promoter (data not
shown). In addition, steady state mRNA levels were determined by phosphorimager quantification to account for
differences due to variance in mRNA stability. Values
shown are average values achieved from several experiments. Luciferase expression levels suggest that the 5'UTRs of both BVDV strains mediate efficient translation of
a second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA (Fig. 1, construct 1
and 2) irrespective of the cytopathic potential of the individual strains. In BHK cells the translation efficiency
mediated by the BVDV-5'UTRs is approximately fivefold
lower compared to the poliovirus type I IRES directed
translation (compare constructs 1 and 2 with 4). To differentiate further cap-independent, internal initiation of
translation from re-initiation of ribosomes after they completed translation of the first cistron pSBCSSD169L was
constructed. pSBCSSD169L is a derivative of plasmid
pSBCSSD1LUC and exhibits a stable hairpin-structure
into the 5' UTR upstream of the first open reading frame.
The calculated stability of the stem-loop of ∆G = -73 kcal/
mol should be sufficient to interfere with cap-mediated,
and ribosomal scanning-dependent translation [18]. The
hairpin structure reduced SEAP translation 20 fold without affecting translation of the downstream luciferase cis-

tron (Fig. 1, construct 3 and 2). Thus, internal initiation
rather than re-initiation accounts for cistron 2 translation.
Taken together the data show that both BVDV 5' UTRs represent IRES elements of medium strength and that differences of the individual strains in e.g. cytopathic or growth
properties are not correlated to variances in efficiency of
the initiation of translation in our test system.
Deletion mutagenesis of BVDV SD-1 5' UTR
The borders of the IRES element of pathogenic BVDV
strain NADL have been determined previously [1,2]. To
delineate the IRES boundaries in the related, IRES of nonpathogenic BVDV SD-1, a series of dicistronic plasmids
carrying SD-1 5'UTRs with sequential deletions in the 5'
and 3' direction were transfected into BHK cells (Fig. 2).
Luciferase translation decreased twofold in the construct
devoid of the 5' terminal 61 bases and dropped dramatically in all further 5'-3' deleted mutants (Fig. 2. constructs
2–5). Similar low levels of luciferase expression were
found in all experiments with 5' UTRs carrying deletions
extending from the initiator AUG in the upstream direction (Fig. 2, constructs 6–8). The data demonstrate that
bases 61–385 of the BVDV 5' UTR are essential for efficient translation and that the 5' terminus of the UTR contributes only marginally to translation efficiency. The
region encompasses about 80% of the 385 nt BVDV 5'

non-coding region suggesting that long range RNA interactions may be involved in internal landing of ribosomes.
The 5' terminus of the BVDV SD-1 5' UTR contributes only
marginally to translation efficiency suggesting that
domain I (stem loops A and B) [19,20] are dispensable. In
contrast, stem-loops II and III (C and D) are required for
the initiation process (Fig. 3). The data are in agreement
with results from investigations of the BVDV strain NADL
IRES published earlier [2].
The BVDV coding region contributes to translation
efficiency mediated by the BVDV SD-1 IRES
The involvement of coding sequences immediately downstream of the 5'UTR has been documented for initiation
of translation of pestivirus RNA (BVDV NADL strain,
CSFV) and also HCV [2,10,14,21,22]. A role for coding
regions was excluded in cardiovirus IRES mediated translation [11], but has been reported previously for the IRES
element of hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus [23]. To
investigate whether the SD-1 IRES extends into the BVDV
coding region mono- and dicistronic expression plasmids
were stably transfected into BHK cells carrying the complete BVDV SD-1 5' UTR, or the UTR extended by either 27
or 75 bases into the contiguous protein coding region
were constructed (Fig. 4). The coding sequences of the
BVDV Npro were in-frame with the downstream luciferase

reporter and resulted in N-terminal extension of the luciferase protein by 9 and 25 amino acids, respectively. First,
to determine the effect on the luciferase reporter of these
added amino acid residues, monocistronic expression
plasmids 4, 5 and 6 were compared. Construct 4 is firefly
luciferase expression vector, while expression plasmids 5
and 6 additionally harbored 9 and 25 codon in-frame
fusion to the original firefly luciferase cDNA. Analysis of
the stability of the luciferase mRNA revealed no differences among these constructs (data not shown). Protein
expression, as measured by luciferase activity, also
appeared only slightly affected by the addition of either 9
or 25 amino acids derived from the BVDV Npro protein in
these monocistronic constructs (Fig. 4) N-terminal fusion
of luciferase with 9 amino acids of the BVDV capsid N-terminus resulted in 1.2 fold increased activity, presumably
due to an increase in luciferase stability [24], inclusion of
25 amino acids of Npro reduced luciferase activity 1.4 fold.
These alterations in activity of luciferase-fusions in the
monocistronic constructs was taken into account to calculate the final enhancement of BVDV coding sequences out
of the data a for luciferase translation in the dicistronic
constructs of Fig. 4. Thus, in the dicistronic constructs 1, 2

and 3 the addition of 27 or 75 nucleotides of BVDV aminoterminal coding region resulted in an 3 fold or 4.8 fold
increase in translation efficiency. Inversion of the 25 residue NPro sequence in construct 3 resulted in a 16 fold
decrease of second cistron translation compared to construct 3 (data not shown). The results demonstrate that
the BVDV IRES expands into the BVDV coding region and
that sequences immediately downstream of the BVDV initiator AUG contribute to the efficiency of internal initiation in pestivirus BVDV strain SD-1. Taken together with
previous observations with BVDV NADL, CSFV and HCV,
one may speculate that coding region involvement is
unique if compared to other viral and cellular IRES elements, but is a 'common' feature in related pestiviruses
and hepaciviruses.
The importance of both stems of the pseudoknot structure
Based on the predicted RNA secondary structural models
in HCV and pestiviruses Le et al. searched for tertiary interactions and identified a pseudoknot region immediately
upstream of the initiator AUG in HCV and in pestiviruses
[25]. Subsequently, the physical presence of the predicted
pseudoknot structure in HCV was demonstrated by bio-

The domain denomination by Deng and Brock makes use of

chemical analysis, and evidence for the functional role of
the pseudoknot in HCV internal ribosome entry was provided by mutagenesis experiments for HCV and CSFV
[3,12,13]. In contrast to HCV in all pestiviruses stem 1 of
the pseudoknot is bipartite and carries an intervening
loop between stem 1a and stem 1b. The length of the stem
1 a and b in BVDV are 6 and 7 bp, respectively. To investigate whether the proposed pseudoknot structure in the
BVDV 5' UTR is part of the BVDV translational strategy, we
determined reporter gene expression after transfection of
dicistronic plasmids carrying mutations in the putative
pseudoknot structure (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Mutants M1 and M2
carry contiguous substitutions in bases 341–344 (upper
strand) and 367–370 (lower strand) of stem 2, respectively, and interfere with formation of pseudoknot stem 2
(Fig. 5). Mutants M5 and M4 exhibit non-contiguous substitutions in the left (stem 1a) or right (stem 1b). M6 addionally carries substitution in the central portion (around
the 'bubble') of stem I. Mutations M4, M5, M6 impair the

formation of stem 1. Luciferase expression levels revealed
that all mutations which perturb the structure of stem 1 or
stem 2 dramatically reduced the ability of the 5' UTR to
mediate internal initiation of translation. All pseudoknot
mutants disrupting parts of the stem structure were translationally inactive, irrespectively of the strand of the stem
in which the mutation was introduced (Fig. 6). In mutant
M7 disrupting base changes of mutant M6 were repaired
by introducing complementary bases in the opposite
strand (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the repaired stem resembles
the sequence found in genotype 2 BVDV 5'UTR (see Fig.
7). The compensatory mutant not only restored IRES
activity, but slightly enhanced translation efficiency,
thereby demonstrating that intact pseudoknot tertiary
structure is of importance for IRES mediated translation.
To confirm the importance of stem 2 integrity pseudoknot
mutant M8 was constructed which restored base pairing
and compensated for mutations inserted into stem 2 in
mutant M1. Again, translational activity, which dropped
down to 1% of the wt SD-1 IRES in mutant M1, could be
restored in compensatory mutant M2 to 78% of wt level.
In summary, the results from mutational analysis of stem
1 and stem 2 of the putative pseudoknot indicate the relevance of this region of tertiary structure for BVDV translation.
Strength of the BVDV strain SD-1 IRES in cell lines of
human and murine origin
To evaluate the translational efficiencies in cell lines of
different origin, we transfected dicistronic expression vectors containing the SD-1 5'UTR or the poliovirus IRES into
cell lines of mouse and human origin [see additional file
1]. In some experiments a vector containing the SD-1 IRES
extended by 9 amino acids of the coding region was also
used. Furthermore, control vectors devoid of an IRES in
the intercistronic region or carrying the inhibitory stemloop in the 5'UTR of the dicistronic mRNA were included
into the experiments. The cell lines were derived from different tissues and include cancer cells like glioma and neuroblastoma (brain), myeloma, erythroleukemia (blood),
hepatoma (liver), carcinoma (cervix) and a kidney cell
line often used for transient protein production. Interestingly, in all murine cell lines investigated the BVDV SD-1
IRES exhibited higher expression levels than the poliovirus IRES. In human cell lines – with the exception of a cervix carcinoma cell line – the poliovirus IRES mediated
higher luciferase expression than the SD-1 5'UTR. Interestingly, in HeLa cervix carcinoma the SD-1 5' UTR mediated
2.4 fold higher second cistron expression than the poliovirus IRES. Including the extension into the coding region
into the SD-1 IRES resulted in 1.5–3 fold increase in translational efficiencies irrespective whether the cell line is of
human or mouse origin. As expected, second cistron
expression was blocked, when the expression vector contained an intercistronic region devoid of IRES activity.

Luc (Eff): Luciferase values exhibited by the moncistronic constructs were taken into account to calculate the effect of the
inclusion of coding region on IRES mediated translation. The AUG context at position +4 (G) and +5 (A) of the wild-type luciferase construct and its fusion mutants is identical and optimal and should not give rise altered translational efficiency [60]. The
data shown are average values derived from four independent experiments. Addition of 9 or 25 codons of the BVDV aminoterminus (black box) to the SD-1 5' UTR results in 3 to 4.8 fold increase of translation efficiency when the effects of N-terminal
extension of luciferase in monocistronic constructs on luciferase stability/activity were considered.

Incorporation of an inhibitory stem-loop in front of cistron 1, abolished cistron 1 expression as expected, but
also effected cistron 2 expression slightly but to a certain
extent. Taken together, SD-1 IRES meditates higher
expression levels in cell lines of murine origin compared
to the poliovirus type I IRES, which may have its molecular basis in the equipment of the cell with specific factors
necessary for translation mediated by the individual IRES.

Discussion
Translation of the BVDV RNA strain NADL occurs via
internal initiation of translation [1,2]. We confirmed and
extended these data by transfection experiments with
dicistronic plasmids using the strain NADL and SD-1 5'UTRs as intergenic regions. Insertion of an inhibitory
stem-loop structure in the 5' UTR of the dicistronic mRNA
lead to severe reduction of cistron 1 translation, but had
no effect on BVDV5' UTR mediated translation of cistron
2. The insensitivity of downstream cistron translation to
the inhibition of scanning dependent translation is a

strong indicator of an internal ribosomal entry versus a reinitiation of ribosomes after translation of an upstream
open reading frame.
A central part of our study included the determination of
the borders of the BVDV IRES of the non-cytopathic SD-1
strain. The BVDV 5' UTR is 385 nucleotides in length. We
found, that the BVDV IRES encompasses about 80% of the
5' UTR. The 5' proximal 20% of the BVDV leader contributes only marginally to SD-1 IRES function, which is in
agreement with results from deletion analysis of the
NADL 5' UTR and hybrid arrest translation experiments
performed earlier [1,2] However, deletions further downstream or deletions in the opposite, upstream direction
starting from the authentic translational initiation site
severely inhibited BVDV IRES function. The results indicate that an overall higher order structure formed by stemloop regions II (C) and III (D) (Fig. 3, [19,20]) as well as
the region between region III and the initiator AUG which
contribute to the pseudoknot structure are important and

must be preserved to guarantee IRES function. Our results
from experiments with the strain SD-1 5'UTR are in agreement with earlier investigation of the related strain NADL
IRES. Previous mapping experiments using an incomplete
BVDV leader missing the 5' proximal 28 nt have demonstrated that partial removal of domain III (D) by deletion
of bases 173–236 resulted in a 3 fold decrease in IRES
mediated translation in transfected BHK cells [1]. In vitro
experiments using hybrid arrest translation identified a
region 154–261 within the domain III (D) structure to be
important for BVDV protein synthesis [1]. Fine mapping
of the BVDV NADL IRES revealed that stem-loops Ia and
Ib were dispensable for efficient translation and the hairpin end of IIIb and stem-loop IIIe were only partially
required. In contrast, deletions in domains II, IIIa, IIIc and
IIId caused nearly 10 fold decrease in BVDV NADL IRES in
vivo activity, stressing the importance of these regions for

translation [2]. The results concerning the 5' UTR boundaries of the BVDV IRES parallel the results reported for the
mutational analysis of the closely related HCV 5'
UTR[4,5,26] and pestiviral CSFV IRES [3] which indicate
that the HCV and CSFV IRESes include almost the entire
5' non-coding region emphasizing the close relationship
of HCV, CSFV and BVDV 5' UTR in structure and function.
Remarkably, the efficiency of translational initiation from
pestivirus and HCV IRESes and also HAV is influenced
profoundly by the nature of the 5' proximal coding
region, which suggested an IRES extension into the coding
region [10,14,21-23,27]. While the 'IRES extension' into
the coding regions has been mapped in detail for HAV,
HCV and CSFV [10,14,23], the coding region requirement
has not been investigated in detail in BVDV. Chon and coworkers included a 515 nt ORF region as extension into

their investigation of the BVDV NADL IRES 3'delimitation. Deletion of the long coding region reduced IRES
activity to 79%, which supported the idea that the NADL
IRES extends into the coding region and that Npro coding
region contributes to IRES efficiency, however only marginally [2]. A remarkable result of our investigation was
achieved when we extended the BVDV SD-1 IRES in our
experiments by short coding regions following the start
AUG of the polyprotein. To circumvent problems that
may be related with stable secondary structures immediately downstream of the AUG initiation codon, firefly
luciferase was used as a reporter gene in the translation of
the second cistron [28]. As expected for the related BVDV
strain the IRES mediated translation was enhanced by the
polyprotein coding region. However, in contrast to the
low enhancement in case of the NADL-NPro addition

reported earlier [2] we found a 3 to 4.8 fold enhancement
of translation efficiency after addition of 27 or 75 nt of the
Npro coding region to the 5'UTR. Additional support for
the importance of the sequences immediately downstream of the initiating AUG is provided by the comparison of the 5' terminal coding region of various BVDV
isolates. Due to the high mutation rates of RNA a considerable variation in the wobble position of the BVDV
sequences is expected [29]. However, the alignment of
nucleic acids and protein sequences of 3 BVDV genotype I
isolates (NADL, SD-1, Osloss) and one genotype 2 isolate
(2–890) indicates low variation in the wobble position in
the N-terminal coding sequence. 13 out of 16 codons are
totally conserved with respect to nucleic acids sequence in
the first 16 codons of the BVDV polyprotein (data not
shown). This fairly conserved region is followed by an

area of high divergence, only 2 out of the following 16
codons remain the same in all four pestivirus strains.
Interestingly, a similar conservation scheme is observed in
primary structure alignments of CSFV strains (Brescia and
Alfort), where 14 out of the 16 aminoterminal codons
were conserved within these two strains while divergence
appeared after codon 15 (data not shown). This notion
correlates with the findings that 17 codons of the N-terminal region are required for CSFV IRES translational
enhancement [14], while shortening to 12 codons
resulted only in 66% of translational efficiency. Theses
findings suggest a strong selective pressure on preservation of the nucleic acid sequence suggesting an importance of the region for internal initiation of translation
rather than a constraint for amino acid preservation.
Support for our notion that the 5' proximal NPro region is
important for translational initiation came from experiments mapping the 40 S binding segment in BVDV RNA.
Similar to HCV, the BVDV IRES is able to bind 40S ribosomal subunits directly without the need of initiation factors. The BVDV RNA generates toeprints (primer
extension inhibition) that indicate interaction at position
U361 of the pseudoknot in the 5' UTR and positions 10–
12, +15 to +17 and +19 with respect to the initiator AUG
in the NPro coding region [30]. Interestingly, similar to

the situation in CSFV the interaction seems to be very sensitive to secondary structures immediately downstream to
the initiator AUG, which resembles the situation in
prokaryotic systems [14,28,31]. Myers et al. argued that
absence structural constraints, rather than binding of a
cellular factor is responsible for NPro augmentation or
BVDV translation[31]. The importance of BVDV N-terminal coding region in viral replication was demonstrated in
DI particles where 'subgenomic' RNAs with internal inframe deletions derived from mutant BVDV viruses are
observed. Interestingly, the N-terminal 28 amino acids of
the NPro coding region were retained in 11 of the mutant
viruses. In an attempt to construct BVDV replicons constructs failed with reporter genes directly fused to the
BVDV 5' UTR but mutants could be rescued when 12 to 84
nucleotides of NPro N-terminal sequences were added [3234].
The BVDV SD-1 coding region contributes moderately but
distinctly to enhance initiation of translation. Presently, it
is not clear whether a low degree of secondary structure, a
cellular protein that binds to the proximal region downstream of the AUG codon, or other factors contribute to
the effect observed in our investigation. The contribution
of coding region to translational initiation represents a
complex issue, reflected by the fact that some researchers

observed the effect in HCV and pestiviruses
[2,10,14,21,22,27] and others did not [4,5,26,28]. In
HCV and pestivirus translation 40 S ribosomes bind
directly to the viral RNA without the need of additional
factors [30,35,36]. Due to the absence of an RNA helicase
(as present in picornavirus initiation of translation), the
40S ribosomal subunit binding is impaired by stem-loop
structures in the vicinity of the initiator AUG in HCV and
pestivirus translation [14,28,31]. As mutants with less stable secondary structure in the AUG proximal coding
region give rise to an increase of translation, 40 S binding
seems to be sensitive to stem-loops downstream of the
initiator. Thus, a low degree of secondary structure largely,
but not exclusively, contributes to coding region enhancement of translation. Interestingly, in a recent report Kim et
al. identified the cellular RNA binding protein NSAP1 that
modulates HCV IRES-mediated translation. NSAP1 binds
to the run of A residues in the region of low secondary
structure in the HCV N-terminus, identified as part of the
coding region which augments HCV IRES mediated translation. In a series of experiments they showed that the cellular protein is crucial for increase of the translational
efficiency of the HCV IRES [37]. The involvement of coding region in IRES mediated translation of viral RNAs has
been demonstrated recently in two other cases, which corroborate the importance of coding regions in internal initiation of translation. Garlapati et al. showed that in
Giardiavirus (GLV), a double-stranded RNA plant virus of
the totiviridae family, the IRES extends to both sides of the
AUG initiator codon [38]. Interestingly, a stable stemloop in the vicinity downstream of the initiator AUG does
not interfere with GLV translation. Surprisingly, Herbetreau and co-workers found, the HIV-2 RNA contains a
new type of IRES which is located within the coding
region [39].
Another interesting result of our investigation was the
finding that a pseudoknot structure postulated by computational RNA folding actually is involved in BVDV IRES
function. From the genetic data presented we conclude
that the putative pseudoknot in the BVDV SD-1 5'UTR is
an important element for IRES function. Strikingly, alterations in the termini of each half (1a, 1b) or the center of
stem 1 as well as mutation of 4 consecutive bases in each
strand in the centre of stem 2 abrogated IRES function.
However, IRES function could be reconstituted through
construction of mutants (M7, M8) compensating the
nucleotide exchanges in the secondary structure of stem 1
or 2 (mutants M6, M1). This strongly suggests tertiary
structure requirements in IRES function. Pseudoknot
structures play a role in ribosomal frameshifting, cleavage
in group introns and hepatitis delta virus, protein recognition for translational regulation and autoregulation [40].
The involvement of a pseudoknot in the internal initiation of translation was shown previously for the HCV

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/124

IRES [12,13] by biochemical and genetic methods to
prove the presence and the function of the pseudoknot. A
potential pseudoknot was computed in BVDV 5' UTRs by
thermodynamical, phylogenetic and statistical methods.
Thermodynamic calculations based on different programs
(EFFOLD, SEGFOLD, RNAKNOT) showed that this tertiary structure represents a highly conserved feature among
different pestiviruses and HCV [13,25,41-43]. Previously,
Rijnbrand et al (1997) and Fletcher and Jackson (2002)
provided genetic evidence for pseudoknot involvement in
CSFV RNA translation [3,44]. Rijnbrand et al. showed that
mutants that lost the ability to base pair in stem II of the
pseudoknot were translationally inactive in mammalian
cells and translation to wild-type level could be restored
by the introduction of compensatory base changes in stem
II. Fletcher and Jackson confirmed the previous findings
and extended their analysis to pseudoknot stem 1a and
the loop structure between the two stems of the pseudoknot. They demonstrated the importance of stem 1 integrity and showed that the length of the loop between the
two stems and clustered A residues were crucial for CSFV
IRES activity.
Due to differences in primary structure and immunological properties, BVDV strains are divided into two genotypes. Genotype 1 encompasses the classical BVDV
isoloates (NADL, SD-1, Osloss) while genotype 2 refers to
later described isolates (e.g. 2–890) [45,46]. Interestingly,
the primary structure of the pseudoknot stems is conserved within the BVDV genotype 1, but base substitutions were observed in comparison to the pseudoknot
stems of the BVDV genotype 2 (Fig. 7). BVDV pseudoknot
primary structure of genotype 1 and the genotype 2 differ
in 13 out of 23 nts in stem 1 and 2 nts in stem 2. Interestingly, mutations in the opposite strand for stem 1 compensate for alterations of the complementary strand in
genotype 2, and the G-A change at pos. 352 and C-A
change at pos. 359 in BVDV2 increase the stability and the
length of stem 2. This appearance of a natural compensation of primary structure divergence in order to conserve
the respective higher order structure strongly argues for
the importance of the pseudoknot for both genotypes.
Presently, the role of the pseudoknot in BVDV translational initiation is not known. It is tempting to speculate
that it supports IRES basal region III in binding of 40 S
ribosome or acts in concert with other IRES domains in
AUG positioning, as has been suggested recently for the
HCV IRES based on modelling data [47-49].
Taken together, the BVDV SD-1 IRES shares features previously reported for the BVDV NADL, CSFV and HCV
IRESes. The most prominent characteristics are the IRES
length of about 330–380 nucleotides, the involvement of
a pseudoknot structure, the participation of coding
sequences in translation efficiency and a direct ribosome

binding and initiation mechanism without the requirement of additional factors [30]. Due to the differences to
type I and type II IRES elements, hepacivirus HCV and
pestiviruses IRESes represent a distinct group of viral IRES
elements, denominated type III or, more recently, HP
IRESes [50]. Interestingly, a subset of viruses within the
picornavirus family has been identified recently, which
resembles the hepacivirus and pestivirus IRES elements
and which may join this interesting group in the future
[50].

pST7-1568A13 [16] harbors the 5' UTR and a part of the
coding region of the BVDV strain SD-1 genome. pT7 5'p20
encodes the 5' UTR and a portion of the coding region of
BVDV strain NADL[15]. pmβActin (Stratagene) harbors
the cDNA of the mouse β-actin gene.
pSVSBXLUC is a eukaryotic expression vector harboring
the SV40 early promoter, single cloning sites for SacII,
BamHI, XhoI, NcoI, a firefly luciferase cDNA and the luciferase polyadenylation signal. The luciferase translational
start codon is the AUG of the NcoI site.

Conclusion
Translational efficiency of the IRES of the non-cytopathic
BVDV SD-1 is increased by the non-coding region immediately downstream of the AUG initiator codon and is
higher in murine cell lines compared to cell lines of
human origin. The putative pseudoknot found in the IRES
of the non-cytopathic BVDV SD-1 strains represents an
important structural element in translation of the viral
RNA. Since the BVDV pseudoknot region is crucial for
polyprotein translation, it may represent a feasible target
for blocking viral replication, e.g. by RNA interference as
it has been demonstrated for HCV [51].

Methods
Cells and cell culture
BHK21 (ATCC CCL10), HeLa (ATCC CCL2), HEK 293
(ATCC CRL1573), AS-30D rat hepatoma (DSM ACC208),
SNB19 human glioma (DSM ACC325), LN405 human
glioma (DSM ACC189) cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml ampicillin. For cultivation of C6
rat glioma (a kind gift of Bernd Hamprecht, Univ. Tuebingen) antibiotics were omitted. Sp2/0 mouse myeloma (a
gift of Uli Weidle, Roche Diagnostics), HepG2 cells
(ATCC HB8065) as well as K562 human erythroleukemia
(DSM ACC10) were propagated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For HGBM1 human glioma
(via H. Weich derived from Dr. Megyasi, Harvard Medical
School) cultivation in a 1:1 mixture of RPMI/DME and
10% FCS was applied. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma
(CCL 121) were cultivated in MEM with Earle's BSS and
essential amino acids and 10% FBS and. If not otherwise
indicated cell lines originated from ATCC or DSMZ (German collection of micro organisms and cell culture).
Plasmids and plasmid construction
Recombinant DNA technologies were performed by
standard procedures [52].

The construction of pSBCSEAPpoLUC and pSBCSdeltapoL is described elsewhere [17]. pAG60 [53] and
pSV2PAC [54] mediate G418 and puromycin resistance to
mammalian cells, respectively.

pSBC2SEAP is derived from pSBC2 [17] and harbors the
SEAP coding region under control of the SV40 early promoter.
Fragments containing the complete 5' UTRs of BVDV
strain NADL and SD-1 were generated by PCR from plasmids pT7 5'p20 [15]and pST7-1568A13 [16]. The 5' primers were designed to supply missing nucleotides in the
extreme 5' part of the untranslated region. To facilitate
cloning, the 5' primers carried a BamHI and HindIII site,
while the 3' primers were equipped with a NcoI site. For
construction of pSBCNADL-A and pSBCNADL-AUG 3'
primers were used which carried the respective mutations
in the central part of the oligonucleotide. The PCR fragments were cut with BamHI and NcoI and cloned into
BamHI/NcoI linearized pSVSBXLUC. The resulting monocistronic
plasmids
pSVNADLLUC,
pSVSD1LUC
pSVSD1ALUC and pSVSD1AUGLUC were cleaved with
HindIII and the fragment containing the 5'UTR, luciferase
cDNA and luciferase pA was inserted into HindIII linearized pSBC2SEAP to give rise to the dicistronic plasmids
pSBCNADLL, pSBCSSD1LUC, pSBCNADL-A and pSBCNADL-AUG, respectively.
pSBCS69ASSSD1L is derived from pSBCSSD1LUC by
insertion of NotI terminated, 'stemloop' oligonucleotides
69 nt in length into the single Not I site 5' to the SEAP start
codon.
For the construction of dicistronic deletion mutants
monocistronic plasmids carrying the deleted forms of the
SD1–5' UTR were constructed by digestion of monocistronic pSVSD1LUC with NcoI and PstI, PmlI or AflII
(deletion at the 3' end of the leader), polishing of the ends
with T4DNA ligase or Klenow and religation. The respective dicistronic plasmids were constructed by ligation of
HindIII fragments derived of the monocistronic plasmids
and carrying the mutated BVDV-5'UTR, the luciferase
cDNA and pA into HindIII linearised pSBC2SEAP as
described above. 5' deleted leader mutants pSSD1H236L
and pSSD1H169L were derived from partial digestion of
dicistronic plasmid pSBCSSD1LUC with HindIII followed

by cleavage with PmlI or AflII and religation of the long
fragment.
pSSD1B61L: StuI/BamHI cleaved pSVSD1LUC was religated after end polishing and the BamHI/HindIII fragment carrying the deleted BVDV-5'UTR and the luciferase
cDNA was ligated into HindIII cleaved pSBC2SEAP after
fill in of overlapping ends.
pSD1B101L: The 285 bp NheI filled in/NcoI fragment was
ligated into BamHI filled in/NcoI digested pSVSBXLUC.
The 5' BVDV-UTR-Luciferase fragment was isolated from
the resulting plasmid after BamHI/HindIII digestion and
end polishing and was ligated into HindIII filled in
pSBC2SEAP.
pSVSBX9LUC and pSVSBX25LUC: Oligonucleotides with
overlapping NcoI sites coding for the terminal 9 and 25
amino acids of the p20 protein were ligated to NcoI
digested pSVSBXLUC.
pSBCSSD1-25LUC and pSBCSSD1-9LUC: The 5'UTR luciferase HindIII fragment of pSVSBX9LUC or
pSVSBX25LUC was cloned into HindIII linearised
pSBC2SEAP.
Pseudoknot mutants: Oligonucleotides carrying mutations in the pseudoknot as shown in Fig. 5 and PstI or
NcoI ends substituted for the 48 bp PstI/NcoI fragment of
pSVSBX9LUC. The HindIII fragments carrying mutated
5'UTRs and the luciferase cDNA were cloned into HindIII
linearised pSBC2SEAP.
The integrity of plasmids derived from PCR cloning and
oligonucleotide cloning was confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing using the Sequenase sequencing kit
(USB).
Enzymes
Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase
were purchased from New England Biolabs and Roche
Diagnostics.
Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on 380B or 394 synthesizers (Applied Biosystems) and purified by OPC affinity chromatography (Perkin Elmer).
Transfection
Plasmids were co-transfected as supercoiled DNAs either
using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described
[55] or lipofectamine. Transient expression experiments
were analysed 2 d after gene transfer. For stable transfection of BHK cells, depending on the co-transferred selection marker, selection with either 700 µg/ml G418 or 5

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/124

µg/ml puromycin was applied 48 h after transfection. In
the case of G418 selection cells were split 1:3. Clones arising 8–12 d after selection were counted and pooled.
Reporter gene assays
The colorimetric SEAP assay was performed as described
in [56], the more sensitive luminometric SEAP determination was done as recommended by the supplier (Phosphalight, Tropix). Luciferase activity was determined after
repeated thawing and freezing of cells according to the
protocol of de Wet et al. [57] as 'flash type' assay in a
Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold, Germany). The 'glow type'
assay (LucLite, Canberra-Packard) was used for processing
large number of samples in microtiter format in a Microlumat LB96 P (Berthold, Germany).

Parallel measurements guaranteed reliability of the individual assay types. SEAP or luciferase productivities were
calculated in light units/106 cells a day. To account for differences in mRNA levels due to variation in mRNA stability, these values were adjusted to the specific mRNA levels
using the data obtained for steady state mRNA concentration (see following chapter). The final translation efficiency of each cistron is given in%, the values of the
dicistronic construct carrying wild-type SD1 5' UTR are
arbitrarily set to 100%. Results represent average values
from multiple, independent transfection series.
RNA analysis
polyA+ RNA was isolated from 106 cells using the mRNA
DIRECT kit (Dynal, Norway) employing oligo dT-conjugated magnetic beads, separated on formaldehyde gels
and blotted onto nylon membranes (Biodyne) according
to standard procedures [52]. RNAs were hybridized with
32P labeled luciferase (or SEAP) cDNA and washing of the
blots was performed under high-stringency conditions.
Probing for reporter gene specific mRNA was followed by
rehybridization with 32P labeled mouse β-actin cDNA to
equalize differences in mRNA extraction. Radioactive signals of both hybridizations were analyzed and quantitated using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics).
Sequence alignment
Nucleotide and protein sequences were aligned using the
pileup option of the GCG program package and published primary structures of BVDV NADL [15], SD-1 [16],
Osloss [58], 2–890 [45], CP7 [59].
