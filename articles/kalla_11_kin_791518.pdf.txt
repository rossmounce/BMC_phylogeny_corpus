Kin discrimination and possible cryptic species in
the social amoeba Polysphondylium violaceum
Sara E Kalla*, David C Queller, Andrea Lasagni, Joan E Strassmann

Abstract
Background: The genetic diversity of many protists is unknown. The differences that result from this diversity can
be important in interactions among individuals. The social amoeba Polysphondylium violaceum, which is a member
of the Dictyostelia, has a social stage where individual amoebae aggregate together to form a multicellular fruiting
body with dead stalk cells and live spores. Individuals can either cooperate with amoebae from the same clone, or
sort to form clonal fruiting bodies. In this study we look at genetic diversity in P. violaceum and at how this
diversity impacts social behavior.
Results: The phylogeny of the ribosomal DNA sequence (17S to 5.8S region) shows that P. violaceum is made up
of at least two groups. Mating compatibility is more common between clones from the same phylogenetic group,
though matings between clones from different phylogenetic groups sometimes occurred. P. violaceum clones are
more likely to form clonal fruiting bodies when they are mixed with clones from a different group than when they
are mixed with a clone of the same group.
Conclusion: Both the phylogenetic and mating analyses suggest the possibility of cryptic species in P. violaceum.
The level of divergence found within P. violaceum is comparable to the divergence between sibling species in
other dictyostelids. Both major groups A/B and C/D/E/F show kin discrimination, which elevates relatedness within
fruiting bodies but not to the level of clonality. The diminished cooperation in mixes between groups suggests
that the level of genetic variation between individuals influences the extent of their cooperation.

Background
Identifying cryptic species is important; morphological
similarity may mask great differences in physiology,
ecology, and behavior [1]. For example, Oreaster reticulatus starfish preferentially prey on only one of two
sympatric cryptic species of Caribbean fire sponges
(Tedania ignis and T. klausi) [2]. Sympatric cryptic species of African weakly electric fishes (Campylomormyrus
tamandua and C. numenius) exhibit different patterns
of electric organ discharge that these fishes use for both
electrolocation and communication [3]. In these cases,
identifying the species has led to a greater understanding of the variation in these traits. In African weakly
electric fishes, this variation in communication affects
interactions between individuals such as mate recognition and mate choice.

Social behavior can be doubly impacted by cryptic
speciation. In addition to differences in behavior
between the two species, social interactions are dependent on the relationship between the interactors. If the
interactors come from different species, then the individuals should be much less likely to perform altruistic
acts. For example, in the two parapatric wood ant cryptic species Formica lugubris and F. paralugubris, workers exhibit discrimination against brood from the other
sibling species when the workers are returning exposed
brood to the nest [4]. However, the two species do not
always discriminate against brood that is from the same
species but from a different nest [4].
Dictyostelids, or social amoebae, have a complex life
cycle that includes social behavior and altruism at a certain stage in their life history (Figure 1). They are unicellular haploid eukaryotes that live in soil and consume
bacteria. When their food source is depleted, they aggregate together into a mound of cells, which then proceeds along one of two different forms of development.

Figure 1 Life cycle of Polysphondylium violaceum. Most of its life, this haploid social amoeba undergoes the vegetative cycle, preying upon
bacteria in the soil, and periodically dividing mitotically. When food is scarce, either the sexual cycle or the social cycle begins. Under the social
cycle, amoebae aggregate to glorin by the thousands, and form a motile slug, which moves towards light. Ultimately the slug forms a fruiting
body in which some of the cells die to lift the remaining cells up to a better place for sporulation and dispersal. Under the sexual cycle,
amoebae aggregate to glorin and sex pheromones, and two cells of opposite mating types fuse, and then begin consuming the other attracted
cells. Before they are consumed, some of the prey cells form a cellulose wall around the entire group. When cannibalism is complete, the giant
diploid cell is a hardy macrocyst, which eventually undergoes recombination and meiosis, and hatches hundreds of recombinants. Not drawn to
scale. Image credit: David Brown and Joan Strassmann, under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0 license.

In the sexual cycle, two cells of compatible mating types
fuse to form a giant cell where the nuclei fuse and
undergo meiotic recombination [5,6] (Figure 1). The
giant cell engulfs surrounding cells and eventually
encysts. In nature haploid, recombined daughter cells
eventually hatch from the cysts, though this is not easily
achieved in the laboratory [7]. In the social stage, the
aggregation organizes into one or more multicellular
slugs. These slugs then develop into fruiting bodies.
During fruiting body formation, some of the cells die to

form a stalk and other cells form hardy spores at the
top of the stalk. Because stalk cells die, they should be
expected to preferentially form fruiting bodies with
identical or closely related clones and discriminate
against individuals and non-kin by sorting from them
and forming independent, clonal, fruiting bodies.
There have been several studies of the diversity of
individual species of dictyostelids [5,8-11], but overall
there has been little study on the diversity within any
one species. It has been suggested that Polysphondylium

Kalla et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/31

violaceum is a cryptic species complex composed of at
least two separate morphologically identical species
[5,11]. Clark examined 49 clones of P. violaceum collected in Massachusetts for macrocyst formation. Clark
observed two different groups within P. violaceum that
each formed macrocysts when individuals from the
same group were paired [11]. She did not further characterize the two putative species, and the clones are not
available for further study.
Kin discrimination has been observed in D. discoideum, D. giganteum, and D. purpureum [12-14], but no
such work has been done with P. violaceum. It differs
from the previously studied species in its branching
fruiting body with many small clumps of spores [15],
and it is basal to group 4 dictyostelids [16]. It is not
phylogenetically close to most other species that were
also called Polysphondylium because they were classified
on the basis of their branched fruiting bodies, and not
phylogenetics [13].
We examined cryptic speciation and kin recognition in
P. violaceum. We used both DNA sequence data and
mating data to look at both the population structure of
P. violaceum and how this structure relates to cooperation in the social stage. We sequenced ribosomal DNA
of 90 clones of P. violaceum and constructed a gene tree
to examine population structure. We also performed
mating experiments to understand patterns of potential
gene flow. We tested for cooperation and discrimination
by performing 13 mixes of cells from pairs of clones,
that were then allowed to develop into the social stage,
so sorting could be investigated.

Methods
A. Collection of clones

We collected 80 clones from undisturbed areas of the
Houston Arboretum and Nature Center, Houston, TX
(27 clones); Brazos Bend State Park, Needville, TX
(1 clone); Mountain Lake Biological Station, Mountain
Lake, VA (16 clones); Linville Falls, NC (1 clone);
Urbana, IL (22 clones); and Heidelberg, Germany
(9 clones) (see additional file 1 for details). P. violaceum
is a cosmopolitan species, found throughout the world
including the Americas [17-19], Europe [20,21], Asia
[22-24], and Australia [25].
To ensure that each sample had only one genotype, we
clonally isolated P. violaceum from soil samples. We cultured them on hay infused agar plates (1 L hay infused
H2O (15 g hay left in 1.5 L H2O overnight, then filtered),
1.5 g KH2PO4, 0.62 g Na2HPO4, 15 g agar, autoclaved)
with Klebsiella aerogenes as a food source. We then
replated them so that individual cells grew into discrete
colonies. We harvested one colony from each sample to
ensure the clones were clonal. Additional file 1 has a
complete list of the clones. We obtained five clones from

Page 3 of 11

South Africa (RSA clones) from J. Landolt and acquired
the clone P6 and four clones from Wisconsin (WS
clones) from the Dictybase stock center (P6 depositor: P.
Schaap, WS clones depositor: G. Erdos, [26]). Initially, we
used the morphology of fruiting bodies to identify clones
as Polysphondylium violaceum. P. violaceum has a unique
fruiting body structure, with each stalk supporting multiple whorls of spore containing sori (3-5 sori per whorl) at
regularly spaced intervals and a solitary sori at the end.
The sori range in color from lavender to violet (for a
complete description, see [15]).
B. Genetic analysis

To look at the relationships between wild clones of
P. violaceum, we sequenced a ~2500 bp region that
included the 17S, internal transcribed spacer 1, and 5.8S
RNA (17S-5.8S) of each clone. The 17S rDNA sequence
has already been used to look at the phylogeny of the
entire group of dictyostelids [16,27] as well as the population structure within D. purpureum [9] and D. giganteum [7]. This sequence has enough resolution to
distinguish between sister species in the dictyostelids
[16,27], and prior work with this sequence gives us
information on the level of divergence among species
accepted as different. We used the sequences to construct a gene tree of all wild clones. The sequences of
the primers we used are listed in Table 1. These primers
were previously used for phylogenetics in D. purpureum
and D. giganteum [8,9].
We harvested DNA by collecting 5-10 fruiting bodies
into 150 Î¼l of a 5% Chelex solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA), then added proteinase K to a concentration
of 1.25 mg/ml and incubated this solution at 56Â°C for
four hours then 98Â°C for 30 minutes.
We amplified this region with a polymerase chain reaction using Invitrogenâs Platinum taq polymerase and
0.5 Î¼M of each primer, using chelexed DNA as template.
PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial

denaturation at 94Â°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1
min denaturation at 94Â°C, 1 min annealing at 50Â°C, 1 min
elongation at 72Â°C, followed by a final elongation at 72Â°C
for 10 min. We sequenced all PCR products in both directions using Big Dye Terminators (Applied Biosciences,
Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed with an ABI Prism
automated sequencer (Applied Biosciences, Foster City,
CA, USA). We edited chromatograms and aligned contigs
using the programs SeqMan (DNASTAR, Madison, WI,
USA) and BioEdit (Hall, http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Sequences have been deposited in Genbank [HQ732139-HQ732228].
We followed procedures previously used in our group
for phylogenetic analyses [9]. We included as outgroups
D. purpureum and D. citrinum which are two group 4
dictyostelids (Genbank: D. purpureum DQ340386.1, D.
citrinum DQ340385.1). We aligned sequences using
ClustalW [28]. We developed a gene tree using Bayesian
inference (Mr. Bayes, [29]). To determine the optimal
nucleotide substitution model, we used Akaike information criteria (AIC) [30] and Bayesian information criteria
(BIC) [31], as implemented in ModelGenerator [32].
A Generalized Time Reversible Model with a gamma distribution of mutations (GTR + Î) was found to be the
best model according to both AIC and BIC (data not
shown). We used Mr. Bayes [29] to construct a gene tree
and to estimate posterior probabilities for each node with
parameters estimated based on the model recommended
by ModelGenerator [32], the GTR + Î model. The program ran four Metropolis-Coupled Markov chains for
1,600,000 generations following a burn-in period of
400,000 generations with sampling every 100 generations
and beginning with a random tree. We looked at the
average standard deviation of split frequencies to check
convergence. By the 10,000 sampled tree, the average
standard deviation of split frequencies had stabilized at
~0.011, and did not decrease in the following 6,000
sampled trees. We also checked convergence with Are
We There Yet? (AWTY, http://ceb.scs.fsu.edu/awty) [33].
We used the âcompareâ option to compare the posterior
probabilities of clades from independent runs checking
to make sure that the posterior probabilities of the splits
are the same for both independent runs. Nodes with posterior probabilities of less than 0.80 were collapsed.
We also generated a Maximum Likelihood tree using
Garli [34]. We generated 500 bootstrap replicates. We
used consense to generate a consensus tree with bootstrap support. Seqboot, dnaml, and consense are all part
of the Phylip package [35].
C. Macrocyst formation experiments

When dictyostelid cells aggregate in response to starvation, there are two developmental pathways that the cells
can take - the social, fruiting body stage or the sexual

Page 4 of 11

macrocyst stage as shown in Figure 1. Macrocyst formation is favored when cells are cultured in the dark, under
liquid, and without phosphate [6]. During macrocyst
development, amoebae are attracted to the cAMP produced by the diploid fusion of two cells of different mating types. The attracted amoebae wall themselves in and
are gradually consumed by the sexual cell which forms a
giant cell that divides many times before germination
when they release hundreds of recombined amoebae [6].
Clones of the opposite sex and same species form macrocysts under appropriate conditions, though it is extremely
difficult to get these macrocysts to hatch in the laboratory. This means that macrocyst formation is only a partial test for true sexual compatibility.
To test for macrocyst formation, we incubated each
clone both by itself and with each other clone tested
under conditions favorable for macrocyst formation. We
tested clones for macrocyst formation by plating spores
on phosphate-free lactose peptone agar (1 g lactose, 1 g
bactopeptone, 15 g agar, 1 l diH2O) with K. aerogenes as
a food source. We then flooded these plates with Bonnerâs standard salt solution (5.4 mM CaCl2, 10 mM KCl,
5.1 mM NaCl), wrapped them in aluminum foil, and
incubated in the dark for 3-5 days. After 5-7 days, we
scored macrocysts as either present or absent for each
treatment. When checked at later times (2-3 checks
within 3-5 weeks) no additional macrocysts had formed.
In mixes where no macrocysts had formed, cells usually
reached aggregation stage and stopped or the cells simply
died. In a few cases, cells made fruiting bodies or spores.
For most mixes, the clones were divided into sets and all
combinations of clones were mixed within that set. The
sets were then replicated twice. If both clones were in
two different sets, then that particular mix was performed 4 times (for example, QSvi9 and QSvi29).
D. Testing kin discrimination

To test for kin discrimination, we performed 13 reciprocal pairwise mixes. For each mix, we fluorescently
labeled two clones, and mixed each clone with unlabeled
cells of the same clone and unlabeled cells of the other
clone. We performed both the reciprocal mixes, to control for any effects of labeling, and mixes within the
same clone to ensure that the cells were healthy. We
allowed these four mixes to starve, aggregate and form
fruiting bodies. We followed the same protocol as [13].
Cells of each clone were grown up to log phase, split
into two groups, one of which was labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CellTracker TM, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). These cells were then mixed
together in the following fashion: labeled cells of the first
clone mixed with unlabeled cells of the first clone,
labeled cells of the second clone mixed with unlabeled
cells of the second clone, labeled cells of the first clone

Kalla et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/31

mixed with unlabeled cells of the second clone, and
labeled cells of the second clone mixed with unlabeled
cells of the first. Additionally, we plated out the
labeled and unlabeled cells of each clone alone as controls. We collected individual fruiting bodies from each
treatment and counted the number of fluorescently
labeled spores and the number of unlabeled spores to
determine the proportion of each clone present in the
fruiting body.
E. Statistics

To evaluate the extent of sorting in each fruiting body
we calculated the average relatedness of the spores in
each fruiting body assuming that each clone was completely related to itself (r = 1) and completely unrelated
to the other clone (r = 0). Relatedness of the overall
fruiting body is calculated as the proportion of labeled
cells or spores squared plus the proportion of unlabeled
cells or spores squared (r = p2+q2); that is, p of the cells
are related by p to the other cells, and q of the cells are
related by q. We calculated relatedness individually for
each fruiting body and then averaged over all fruiting
bodies. We measured sorting as a significantly higher
relatedness in the experimental fruiting bodies than in
control fruiting bodies.
Because the data were not normally distributed, we
used Resampling Stats for Excel (Resampling Stats Inc.,
Arlington, VA, USA) to create a test. We calculated the
test statistic [F = Variance (experimental)/Variance
(control)] as the ratio of the average variance of the two
experimental treatments divided by the average variance
of the two control treatments. We sampled without
replacement the dataset of the proportion of fluorescent
spores of each individual fruiting body across the four
treatments (two experimental and two control) 5000
times to determine the probability that a variance ratio
as high as this observed ratio could be obtained by
chance [13].
To test for geographic population structure, we ran an
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) using Arlequin 3.11 [36] and used resampling (1023 permutations)
to obtain significance values.

Results
Sequence analysis and phylogeny

We sequenced approximately 2500 bp of the 17S to 5.8S
ribosomal DNA for 90 clones of P. violaceum. Out of
the 90 clones sequenced, we identified 67 unique haplotypes. We aligned these sequences and used the two
species D. citrinum and D. purpureum as outgroups.
The resultant Bayesian gene tree is shown in Figure 2
with the support values from both the Bayesian gene
tree and the maximum likelihood gene tree shown on
the tree in Figure 2i.

We find that the P. violaceum is split into six major
groups, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F on the phylogeny
(Figure 2). Groups C, D, E, and F made up one of the
basal branches of the phylogeny while the group A and
group B made up the other two branches. The phylogeny shows some evidence for geographic population
structure. Group A is comprised of all of the clones
from Germany. All of the clones in group D were from
Houston, TX, however Houston clones belonged to
other groups as well. Most of the clones in groups C
and E were from the same location (South Africa and
Mountain Lake, VA respectively), however these locations also had clones that belonged to other groups. Not
all phylogenetic divisions came from geographic structure. Clones in group B came from 6 of the 8 locations
that we sampled.
Using a shorter sequence to enable the use of
D. laterosorum as an outgroup results in a tree that is
similar to the tree resulting from the full length
sequence (Additional file 2). Groups A and B still form
a branch together. The node with groups C, D, E and F
has been collapsed to a polytomy. All but one of the
haplotypes in group C cluster as a group still. All but
2 haplotypes in group E cluster as a groups still. Group
D remains unchanged. Group F has been collapsed
entirely, and the groups C, D and E no longer show any
relationship with one another.
To see if population structure was due to geographic
distance, we calculated the Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) using the 17S to 5.8S sequence. Like
Fst, the AMOVA is a measure of the population variance, however the AMOVA also incorporates the
degree of difference (mutations) between alleles [37].
The AMOVA showed that 7.75% of the genetic variation observed was between geographically delimited
populations, and the variance was significant (p <
0.00001).
To look at the level of divergence between the phylogenetic groups, we used the 17S sequence to calculate
pairwise distances (base substitutions per site) between
all of the clones. We used MEGA4 to calculate the distances using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
method [38,39]. Using just the 17S sequence, we calculated the average pairwise distance between clones of
P. violaceum and D. laterosorum (clone AE4). These distances ranged from 0.013 to 0.019 (data not shown).
Between the two major groups (A/B and C/D/E/F), pairwise distances ranged from 0.010 to 0.021 (data not
shown). Within these two major groups, distances ranged from 0.000 to 0.010. Within each of the six groups,
the maximum pairwise distances ranged from 0.000
(groups B, C, and F) to 0.010 (group E). Within groups,
all clones had a minimum pairwise distance of 0.000.
The average pairwise distances between some clones are

analogous to the average pairwise distances between
clones of P. violaceum and D. laterosorum, which are
clearly different species. This suggests that P. violaceum
has species level diversity.
Macrocyst matings

To further look at speciation in P. violaceum, we also
examined macrocyst formation (Table 2). No individuals
from group A had any successful matings, either with
other members of group A or members of other groups.
In group B, we observed two different mating types: we
had two clones of one mating type and 23 clones of the
other mating type. With one exception, all matings
between clones of compatible mating types resulted in
macrocyst formation. In the other groups C, D, E, and
F, the mating types were not as clear because of triads
of clones where all three clones would mate with each
other in pairwise combinations, leading to uncertainty
about the number of sexes and whether clones might be
bisexual. Groups D and E both had two clearly defined
mating types, and each clone made the sexual form
called a macrocyst when paired with a member of the
same group but opposite mating type. One clone from
group E also mated with group C, though group C did
not mate at all within itself, perhaps because our sample
did not include compatible sexes. Clones from group F
mated between themselves as well as with clones from
other groups. We performed multiple replicates of each
set of mixes. While most mixes were consistent between
replicates, some mixes (16 out of 835 mixes) formed
macrocysts only in some of the replicates. In these
cases, the result (macrocyst formation or no macrocyst
formation) that was found in the majority of replicates
was used, to rule out the possibility of contamination or
occasional selfing.
Overall, we saw complete mating within group B (all
clones of mating type A mated with all of mating type
B), and a high degree of mating within the other major
clade of groups C, D, E, and F, with a few matings

The letters refer to the phylogenetic groups from Figure 2. A total of 835
unique mixes were attempted between two clones. In each category, matings
are listed as successful mixes/attempted mixes. Each mix between any two
individuals was performed at least twice. When these gave conflicting results,
another replicate mix was performed and the majority result was counted.

between two major clades. Between the groups C, D, E,
and F there was some mating between the different
groups though matings were not consistent enough to
be able to assign mating types to clones and thus diagnose the thoroughness of mating success.
We are hesitant to categorize the rate of successful
matings between because of the variation in mating
types throughout the dictyostelids. D. discoideum has at
least two different mating types, with a bisexual mating
type in addition [40]. In D. rosarium, at least three mating types are present [41]. Group B of P. violaceum had
two well-defined mating types, and all clones mated
when paired with a member of the opposite mating type
of Group B. However, we were unable to identify the
number of mating types within the other groups of
P. violaceum. Because of this, we are not confident in
estimating the number of matings that could occur
based on mating types and this is necessary to compare
the rates of observed matings to the possible matings.
Kin discrimination

We looked at the influence of phylogenetic relationships
between individuals on cooperation. To do this, we
related genetic distance to the degree of sorting between
clones. Both distantly related clones and clones from
different species should be less likely to cooperate in
forming fruiting bodies. All but three pairwise mixes
showed significant sorting in comparison to controls
(Figure 3, Resampling stats). These three mixes were all
between members of group B (Figure 3). While the rest
of the mixes were all statistically significant from the
controls, some of the mixes between groups C-F
showed incomplete sorting (relatedness < 1). The average relatedness of the pairwise mixes was 0.8 (0.05 std
error).

Discussion
Our data suggest that P. violaceum might contain cryptic species. There are 6 groups (A, B, C, D, E, and F)
with the most basal split being between the groups A/B
and C/D/E/F. Though the genetic distances between
these two main groups are relatively small (0.010-0.021),
they are larger than the differences between accepted
species in the dictyostelids using the same part of the
17S sequence, for example between D. citrinum
(OH494) and D. dimigraformum (AR5b), 0.009; D. clavatum (TNS-C-189) and D. longosporum (TNS-C-109),
0.003; D. mucoroides (TNS-C-114) and D. sphaerocephalum (GR11), 0.001 or between D. brunneum (WS700)
and D. giganteum (WS589) 0.004 [9]). The 17S to 5.8S
sequence is relatively conserved compared to other
genes in a wide variety of organisms (for example
[42-44]). This sequence has enough resolution to distinguish between sister taxa in the dictyostelids [16,27].

Figure 3 Box and whisker plot of relatedness of individual clones in fruiting bodies. Relatedness is calculated as the proportion of labeled
cells squared plus the proportion of unlabeled cells squared (r = p2+q2), which assumes r = 1 to clonemates and r = 0 to non-clonemates.
Relatedness was calculated for each fruiting body individually. Relatedness varies from 0.5 (complete mixing) to 1 (sorting). Groups refer to the
six lettered groups on the phylogenetic tree. Resampling stats were used to compare the relatedness of the control mix (labeled and unlabeled
cells of the same clone) to the experimental (labeled and unlabeled cells from different clones). Error bars are standard error of the mean. * the
control mix relatedness is lower than the experimental p < 0.001. See methods for details.

Furthermore, the variation between geographical
populations accounts for less than 10% of the total variation. Many haplotypes are found in more than one
geographic population. In addition, group B is cosmopolitan, with individuals from almost every geographic
location belonging to this group. This suggests that the
population structure in P. violaceum is not due to geographic constraints alone. The major differences that we
see in the 17S seem for the most part consistent with
species-level differences, with the species often occurring in the same areas.
By and large, the division between the two groups was
reinforced by our mating experiments. Like Clark [5,11],
we found two groups of non-interbreeding individuals;
however, we observed a few instances of mating between
the groups. This leaves open the possibility for some
gene exchange between different groups should those
macrocysts actually be able to germinate. Unlike the
model organism, D. discoideum, P. violaceum reported

germination rates have been upwards of 50% [45]. Examining the germination of our between-group macrocysts,
which would require prolonged ageing of macrocysts
[45], would be a fruitful line of research for the future.
The split between the two groups is also apparent
when looking at cooperation during fruiting body formation. We have found that only clones from group B
exhibit strong mixing and cooperation with other group
B clones in forming the fruiting body. When the clones
were from different phylogenetic groups sorting was
more complete. Both the phylogenetic diversity and the
behavioral changes suggest that there may be at least
two different morphologically identical sister species in
P. violaceum. Both lines of evidence are consistent with
the same division and the variation that we observed in
phylogenetic structure affects the behavior that we
observe in the social stage.
Relatedness allows altruism to be beneficial if the
altruistic acts are directed towards relatives. Because

Kalla et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/31

clones from two different species are not related, there
should be selection for species discrimination. Because
we are unsure of the exact nature of the relationship
between individual clones, we use the term kin discrimination rather than species discrimination. In D. discoideum, the further the genetic distance between clones,
the greater the propensity for kin discrimination to occur
[12]. In our study, a few clones cooperated with each
other to form chimeric fruiting bodies, but most clones
tested sorted out to form mostly clonal fruiting bodies.
All the clones that cooperate with each other were in the
same group (B). This fits with the idea of kin selection,
with only closely related clones cooperating, though we
do not have information on exact values for the other
half of kin selection: the relative costs and benefits of
cooperation. Benefits of larger groups are likely to
include lower proportions of cells destined for stalk relative to spore, and ability to move greater distances, while
costs center on becoming a sterile stalk cell.
Previous studies on kin discrimination in the dictyostelids have given differing results depending on the species
used. Kin discrimination has also been investigated in Dictyostelium discoideum, D. purpureum and D. giganteum.
Clones of D. discoideum exhibit kin discrimination with
more distantly related clones sorting more than clones
that are more closely related [12]. D. purpureum shows
kin discrimination as well [13]. In D. giganteum, some
genetically distinct clones exhibit kin discrimination while
others do not [14]. The question of whether D. giganteum
is one species worldwide with varying levels of kin discrimination or multiple cryptic species has not been resolved,
but North American clones show no differentiation [8].
Our results show that P. violaceum exhibits kin discrimination; like the other dictyostelids, clones from different
cryptic groups within P. violaceum sort to form clonal
fruiting bodies while closely related clones sometimes
cooperate to form chimeric fruiting bodies.
Most of the dictyostelids have been identified and distinguished on the basis of morphology. An exception is
recent work on Polysphondylium pallidum and its sister
species P. album [46] as well as D. ibericum [47].
Romeralo, Baldauf, and Cavender [47] used morphology
to identify a new species, and molecular phylogenetics
to place that species within the dictyostelids. Kawakami
and Hagiwara [46] use a combination of mating type
and morphological characters to redefine these two species. They show that there are three groups, one that
matches the P. pallidum type specimen and mates with
P. pallidum strains, one that matches the P. album type
specimen and mates with P. album strains, and one that
matches neither exactly and mates with neither. The
relationship of the third group to P. pallidum and

Page 9 of 11

P. album remains unclear. These recent studies make it
clear that relying on morphology alone to dictate species
boundaries is not sufficient, and mating type analysis
and molecular work is needed to correctly identify species boundaries and the relationships between species.
Improperly identifying cryptic species also affects biodiversity metrics as well as estimates of geographical distributions. By identifying all members of a cryptic
species complex as the same species, biodiversity is
underestimated and geographic distributions are overestimated. In the identification of protists this can be
especially difficult because of a lack of distinguishing
morphological characteristics [48]. The difficulty of correctly identifying cryptic species has contributed to
debate on protist biogeography. Finlay [49] suggests that
there is something fundamentally different about microorganisms, including protists, such as higher rates of
migration and lower rates of speciation that causes
them to be more cosmopolitan than larger organisms.
Foissner [50] suggests that more endemic species are
present in part because of molecularly distinct but morphologically similar species that are endemic but are
classified as a single cosmopolitan species.

Conclusion
Molecular sequence data has identified many cryptic protist species. Most of the cases involve apparently cosmopolitan species that are actually comprised of
geographically restricted cryptic species [50]. However,
this is not always the case. Aspergillus fumigatus is composed of several cryptic species, but rather than being
geographically isolated species, at least one species is
globally distributed [51]. Similarly, phylogenetic analyses
divide the desert truffle Terfezia boudieri into 3 morphologically identical groups [52]. All collections were made
in a roughly 50 km 2 region of the Negev desert. While
these 3 species are endemic, they do have overlapping
ranges, and there is the possibility that all 3 might have
the same range. In addition, the ectomycorrhizal fungus,
Tricholoma scalpturatum shows two distinct groups [53].
Roughly half of the genetic variance was found within
populations and half of it was found to be between populations. At short ranges, populations were sometimes
structured, but both groups were represented over the
entire sampling range (France to Sweden). These previous studies suggest that cryptic species are not always
endemic subgroups of a cosmopolitan morphotype. If
P. violaceum is in fact composed of two morphologically
indistinguishable species that are globally distributed,
they support Foissnerâs [50] idea that while globally distributed cosmopolitan species exist, morphologically
identical endemic species are also present.
