Abstract
Background:The origin of microbial ORFans, ORFs having no detectable homology to other
ORFs in the databases, is one of the unexplained puzzles of the post-genomic era. Several
hypothesis on the origin of ORFans have been suggested in the last few years, most of which based
on selected, relatively small, subsets of ORFans. One of the hypotheses for the origin of ORFans is
that they have been acquired thru lateral transfer from viruses. Here we carry out a
comprehensive, genome-wide study on the origins of ORFans to quantify the strength of current
evidence supporting this hypothesis.
Results:We performed similarity searches by querying all current ORFans against the public virus
protein database. Surprisingly, we found that only 2.8% of all microbial ORFans have detectable
homologs in viruses, while the percentage of non-ORFans with detectable homologs in viruses is
7.9%, a significantly higher figure. This suggests that the current evidence for the origin of ORFans
from lateral transfer from viruses is at best weak. However, an analysis of individual genomes
revealed a number of organisms with much higher percentages, many of them belonging to the
Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria. We provide evidence suggesting that the current virus
database may be biased towards those viruses attacking Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria.
Conclusion:We conclude that as more viral genomes are sequenced, more microbial ORFans will
find homologs in viruses, but this trend may vary much for individual genomes. Thus, lateral transfer
from viruses alone is unlikely to explain the origin of the majority of ORFans in the majority of
prokaryotes and consequently, other, not necessarily exclusive, mechanisms are likely to better
explain the origin of the increasing number of ORFans.

Background
ORFans are defined as ORFs (Open Reading Frames) having no sequence homologs in other genomes [1]. ORFans
with homologs in the same genome are called paralogous
ORFans, and those without any homolog whatsoever are
called singleton ORFans. In addition, orthologous
ORFans are defined as those ORFs with homologs only

within very closely related microbial genomes [2]. Nearly
all the fully sequenced genomes have a significant
number of ORFans, although the percentages in different
species vary much. Previous studies in our group [3], and
subsequently repeated by others [4] have shown that as
more genomes are being sequenced, the number of
ORFans continues to grow. Despite their abundance, very

few ORFans have been experimentally characterized [5-7],
and thus, most ORFans in the database are annotated as
hypothetical proteins of unknown function.
Since we coined the term "ORFan" in 1999 [1], accumulating evidence has demonstrated that most ORFans correspond to real, functional proteins, and not to errors in
the ORFs annotation [5,7-10]. A survey of ORFans whose
three dimensional structure has been determined [11]
suggested that ORFans are already being studied by a
number of groups. In addition, base compositional analysis and Ka/Ks tests on ORFans conserved in closely
related species (orthologous ORFans) have shown that at
least some of them are real, functional, proteins, although
many may have lower GC content and appear to evolve
faster than widely conserved genes [9,12-14].
Because of the lack of homology to other proteins, the origin of ORFans entails an evolutionary puzzle. Recently, a
number of hypothesis regarding their origins have been
proposed. The observation of the different sequence characterization and phylogenetic distribution of poorly conserved ORFans suggested that they may correspond to
laterally transferred genes (LTGs) [12]. This presumption
was extended recently in a study of Gamma-proteobacteria which proposed that ORFans are likely to be LTGs
from viruses [9]. The most direct evidence that can support the hypothesis that ORFans originate from viruses is
to find homologs to these ORFans within the virus
sequence database. Daubin and Ochman BLASTed
selected ORFans from Escherichia coli MG1655 genome
against sequenced bacteriophage genomes and found that
only ~9% of the ORFans have homologs in phages [9].
This was an unexpectedly low percentage to give strong
support to the hypothesis, but the authors explained that
the low number may be due to the very limited sampling
of virus sequences [9,15,16]. In the past year, this hypothesis and explanation have further been developed [1721].
However, the supporting evidence for this hypothesis and
its subsequent explanation of low sampling was based on
observations from various types of ORFans (restricted in
different depths of phylogeny) within Gamma-proteobacteria only [9]. Here, we carry out a genome-wide study
aimed at quantifying the strength of this hypothesis,
focusing only on singleton, paralogous and very narrowly
defined orthologous ORFans. Our datasets include the
277 microbial genomes and the 1456 viral genomes available on November, 2005.

Results
ORFan collections and the three categories of ORFans
Our collection of ORFans from 277 genomes included the
three types of ORFans: singleton ORFans (ORFs with no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/63

homology to any other protein), paralogous ORFans
(ORFs with homology to proteins of the same genome
only) and orthologous ORFans (ORFs with homologs in
closely related organisms only). Identifying the first two
types of ORFans is straightforward using BLASTP (see
Methods). However, to automatically collect orthologous
ORFans, an operational definition of "closely related
organisms" is needed [22]. To this end, we developed a
novel method to define two featured values for each
microbial ORF. The first is the "H value", which is simply
the number of genomes (including the residing genome)
that contain at least one homolog of this ORF. The values
of H are integers in the range from 1 to N, where N is the
number of genomes considered (277 here). So an ORF
with H = 1 corresponds to either a singleton ORFan (the
only BLASTP hit is to itself) or to a paralagous ORFan
(more than one BLASTP hit, but all within the residing
genome). The second value we define is the "U value",
which is a measure of the "uniqueness" of the ORF, and is
a normalized sum of the ORFs homologs, weighed by the
overall genomic distance between the residing genome
and the genomes of the ORF's homologs (see Methods).
The values of U range between 0.0 to a theoretical maximum 1.0. Thus, ORFs with H > 1 and very small U correspond to ORFans having homologs in closely related
genomes only.
However, choosing a cutoff value of U to define orthologous ORFans is not straightforward. Based on observation, we (rather arbitrarily) set the U value cutoff at 0.1.
For example, using this threshold, we consider the hypothetical protein SA2483 (gi: 15928277) from Staphylococcus aureus strain N315 as an orthologous ORFan, with U =
0.099 and H = 5. SA2483 has homologs in four other
genomes, all within the Staphylococcus genus: S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, and two S. aureus strains: Mu50 and
COL. Another example of an orthologous ORFan is hypothetical protein b1407 (gi: 16129368) from Escherichia
coli strain K12, with U = 0.092 and H = 7. It has highly
similar homologs in E. coli O157H7 strain EDL933 and E.
coli O157H7, and in two Shigella genus genomes: S.
flexneri 2a srtain 2457T and S. flexneri 2a srtain 301. In
addition, its C terminus is about 40% identical to a paralogous ORFan in E. coli strain K12 and to ORFans in other
Escherichia and Shigella genus genomes.
Figure 1 shows the histogram of U values for all 818,906
ORFs in the 277 genomes. The histogram shows a peak
value at 0.64, and a long left tail, the end of which corresponds to our definition ORFans (orthologous ORFans at
0.0 < U <= 0.1 and singleton and paralogous ORFans at U
= 0.0). In total, we collected 110,186 ORFans (13.4% of
all ORFs in the 277 genomes) of which 64,324 (7.8%) are
singleton ORFans, 10,419 (1.3%) are paralogous ORFans
and 35,443 (4.3%) are orthologous ORFans (also see

U-value 1
U-value histogram for all the 818,906 ORFs in 277 prokaryote genomes. The U-value is a measure of the "conservation"
of each ORF (see Methods); U = 0 means the ORF is unique
to one single organism, i.e. a singleton or paralogous ORFan.
9.1% of all ORFs have U = 0. The left tail 0.0 < U <= 0.1
(4.3% of all ORFs) corresponds to orthologous ORFans,
ORFs with homologs only in closely related organisms.
Notice the uneven distribution of U, with its long left tail and
the very high peak at U = 0.

Additional file 1). These ORFan percentages are similar to
those previously reported using 60 [3], 122 [4] and 127
genomes [12]. In summary, using the U and H measures
we can automatically and objectively compile our collection of the three types of ORFans.
Percentage of microbial ORFs having viral homologs
For each proteome in our 277 genome database, we performed a BLASTP search against the public virus proteins
database and computed two percentages: ORFans-VH%,
the percentage of ORFans having homologs in viruses and
non-ORFans-VH%, the percentage of non-ORFans having
homologs in viruses. Figure 2 shows for each genome the
computed ORFans-VH% and non-ORFans-VH%. The
genomes are taxonomically clustered, so that closely
related genomes appear close to each other in the figure.
The figure shows that ORFans-VH% varies much (range:
0~63.8%) in different microbial genomes, while nonORFans-VH% varies much less (range: 4.1%~18.2%).

One way to quantify the strength of the hypothesis that
the origin of ORFans is viral is to compare the value of

ORFans-VH% with that of non-ORFans-VH%. A significantly higher ORFans-VH% would suggest that viral transfer is more common among ORFans than among nonORFans (which corresponds to the overall detectable
baseline of transfer). Surprisingly, we found that out of
the 277 genomes studied, only 22 (7.9%) had ORFansVH% > non-ORFans-VH%. Eighteen of these 22 genomes
are members of Firmicutes, and 4 belong to Gamma-proteobacteria. The highest value of ORFans-VH% is 64% in
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315 (with 154 of its 240
ORFans having homologs in viruses; see Fig. 2 and Additional file 1). The highest number for non-ORFans-VH%
is 18% (also for S. pyogenes MGAS315). On the other
hand, 44 (15.9%) genomes have ORFans-VH% = 0 and
non-ORFans-VH% significantly lower than that of the rest
of the genomes (Wilcoxon nonparametric p-value 9.1e05). These low percentages are not a result of very low
numbers; most of these genomes have more than 100
ORFans, comprising between 3% and 29% of all ORFs in
the genome. Taking all the genomes together we found
that only 2.8% of all ORFans have viral homologs while
the percentage for all non-ORFans is 7.9% (p-value 2.2e16). These findings suggest that the evidence based on current homology to viruses is very weak in general.
Significant differences are also observed when comparing
the non-ORFans-VH% versus the ORFans-VH% values of
various groups (see inset of Fig. 2). Firmicutes (66
genomes) and Gamma-proteobateria (63 genomes) have
significant higher percentages than the other 148
genomes ("Others"). The values for non-ORFans-VH%
and ORFans-VH% are: Firmicutes: 10.0% and 9.0%,
Gamma-proteobacteria: 8.5% and 2.7%, Others (148
genomes): 6.6% and 0.8%; (see Fig. 2 inset). These differences are statistically significant (p-values for ORFansVH%: firm vs. others: 7.8e-13, gamma vs. others: 6.6e-08,
firm vs. gamma: 7.8e-03; and p-values for non-ORFansVH%: firm vs. others: 2.2e-16, gamma vs. others: 5.8e-05,
firm vs. gamma: 1.3e-05). These figures show that Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria have the highest
number of homologs in viruses (both ORFans and nonORFans), and that for genomes in the "Others" group, the
number of ORFans with virus homologs is negligible
(ORFans-VH% = 0.8%).
To check whether the above numbers are a result of stochastic effects caused by short ORFs, we changed the cutoffs defining ORFans (ORF length longer than 300 bp or
E value less than 1e-10; see Methods). All the above observations remained significant (Additional file 1). In addition, to check whether the percentages may be skewed for
genomes with very few total ORFans, we recomputed the
percentages after removing the genomes with less than
100 ORFans and the above observations also remained
significant (data not shown).

Percentage of microbial ORFs having homologs in viruses for 277 prokaryote genomes. The y-axis shows each of the 277
genomes, grouped according to NCBI's taxonomy classification. For each genome, two percentages are shown: red corresponds to ORFans-VH% (percentage of ORFans having homologs in viruses) and blue corresponds to non-ORFans-VH% (percentage of non-ORFans having homologs in viruses). The major 24 clade names are shown, with the number of organisms in
each clade shown in parenthesis. The 24 phylogenetic clades are alternately marked by grey and no background colors. For the
species names and taxonomies, please refer to Additional file 1. The inset shows the average percentage values of ORFansVH% and non-ORFans-VH% in various groups. "Total" corresponds to the averages in all 277 genomes taken together,
"Non_Firm_Gamma (Others)" corresponds to the averages in the 148, non-Firmicutes, non-Gamma-proteobacteria genomes
and "Firm" corresponds to the 66 Firmicutes in the database. The remaining groups in the inset correspond to the major clades
(with at least 10 genomes). The figure clearly shows that except for some Firmicutes, ORFans-VH% is much smaller than nonORFans-VH%, suggesting that the current evidence from homology supporting the hypothesis that the origin of ORFans is viral
is weak at best.

Discussion
The abundance of ORFans observed today in the genetic
material has become one of the unexpected surprises in
the post-genomic era. Their functions and origins remain
unresolved puzzles. One of the hypotheses regarding the
origin of ORFans, derived from a limited analysis in
Gamma-proteobacteria only, suggests that microbial
ORFans are of viral origin, transmitted by phages [9]. In
this paper, we carried out a genome-wide study to attempt
to quantify the strength of the currently available evidence
that supports this hypothesis.
By searching strictly defined ORFans from 277 microbial
genomes against the public viral protein database, we
found viral homologs for only 2.8% of the ORFans. This
suggests that transfer from viruses can today account for
only a tiny fraction of the ORFans. Furthermore, negative
support to the hypothesis is obtained when comparing
the percentage of ORFans with viral homologs (2.8%)
with that of non-ORFans (7.9%), because this suggests
that transfer from viruses is significantly less frequent for
ORFans than for non-ORFans. Out of the 277 genomes,
we found only 22 genomes with a percentage of ORFans
having viral homologs higher than that of non-ORFans.
Eighteen of these genomes belong to the Firmicutes and
the other 4 belong to Gamma-proteobacteria. These findings partially explain Daubin and Ochman's hypothesis
which was mainly based on analysis of one of these clades
but show that the strength of the current evidence for viral
origin for ORFans in general is very weak at best.
Nevertheless, the weak evidence of homology to viral proteins does not necessarily imply that the hypothesis is
wrong. As Daubin and Ochman argued, the low percentages observed today may be due to the current extremely
low sampling of virus sequences [9]; while the current
database contains ~103 viral genomes, it is estimated that
the virus population size in the ocean alone is ~4 Ã 1030
[23], and more importantly, that the phage diversity is
~108 [24]. Thus, due to this huge diversity, it is plausible
that a significant fraction of the ORFs without detectable
viral homologs today may have originated from not yet
sequenced or extinct viruses.
In addition, the significantly higher percentage of microbial ORFs with viral homologs in Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria may indicate that the current virus database is biased to contain more viruses attacking these two
clades. To test this, we first computed the host distribution
of the viral genomes by parsing the Genbank format files
of the phage genomes in our database and manually
checked the related literature to determine what specific
host each phage infects and what taxonomical group each
microbial host belongs to. Of the 1456 viruses in our database, 280 are phages. We found that 109 phages target

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/63

Gamma-proteobacteria, 102 target Firmicutes and 69 target "Others". We also computed the number of viral
genomes containing homologs in each of the three
prokaryotic genome groups. Then, for each group, we
divided this number by the number of genomes in the
group. We found that Gamma-proteobacteria and Firmicutes have higher average ratios (4.84 and 4.68, respectively) than the "Others" group (2.53), and a statistical
test considering the number of viral genomes containing
homologs for the individual genomes in each group
showed the differences are statistically significant (all
pairwise p-values << 0.01). These two results suggest that
the current viral databases are indeed biased towards
viruses attacking these two clades. Furthermore, because
the overall percentage of ORFs (ORFans and nonORFans) with viral hits in Gamma-proteobacteria is lower
than that of Firmicutes (see above), but both our host
count and computed average ratios for Gamma-proteobacteria and Firmicutes are approximately the same, it
seems that the current database contains a further bias
towards Firmicutes in general.
Thus, we can only claim that the evidence today is weak in
general, and future sampling of the viral genomes may
provide stronger evidence. With more viruses sampled, at
least for some prokaryote genomes, the percentage of
ORFans with homologs in viruses can become very high.
Thus, for some clades, further viral sampling will likely
provide stronger evidence for the viral origins of ORFans.
However, it is questionable whether a full sampling of
viral genomes will provide homologs to 100% of the
ORFans or only to a fraction of them.
In addition, even better sampling of viral genomes may
not allow explaining the presence of ORFans in some of
the microbial genomes. We have found 44 genomes with
no viral homologs for any of their ORFans, and with a percentage of non-ORFans with virus homologs significantly
lower than the rest of the genomes. This suggests that they
may correspond to genomes immune to viral attack, as is
the case for obligate species; indeed, 21 of the 44 genomes
are classified as pathogens or symbionts according to the
organism info page at [25]. Because their hosts are a natural barrier to prevent attack from phages, lateral transfer is
rare or non-existent among obligate symbionts and pathogens [26,27] (and references therein). Consequently, it is
to be expected that they show lower percentages of
(ORFan and non-ORFan) viral homologs. Thus, unless
the ORFans in these genomes were acquired from viruses
before the organisms became host-dependent, their origin
is not likely to be from viral lateral transfer, but rather
from alternative, yet unknown, mechanisms.
Independently of the amount of viral genome sequences
sampled, many ORFans may remain without viral

homologs. This could still be compatible with the possibility of ORFans having viral origins, if it is assumed that
ORFans have experienced rapid evolution [9,12,28] after
being transferred from viruses. Their sequences may have
diverged to the extent that no homology to viral proteins
is detectable, and some of them may have even acquired
novel functions or three-dimensional structures [11].
Although this is a plausible explanation of the origins of
some of the ORFans, further genome-wide studies may be
required to quantify the strength of the evidence for this
hypothesis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/63

For each pair of genomes A and B, we calculated a similarity value of two genomes A and B as:

SIM( A , B) =

NumberOfORFsInAHavingHomologsInB
TotalORFsInA

Notice that SIM(A, B) â  SIM(B, A). Notice also that similar
measures have been used by others (e.g. [33,34]).
For each ORF, g, we calculated the value Hg as the number
of genomes having at least one homolog of g, and Ug, a
measure of the "uniqueness" of g as:

Conclusion
We conclude that the evidence for viral lateral transfer as
the origin of microbial ORFans in general, is currently
weak, and even negative. With better viral sampling the
evidence will likely become stronger, but only for some of
the clades, and only for a fraction of the ORFans. Even if
lateral transfer from viruses turns out to be the main origin of microbial ORFans, one is still left with the need to
explain the origin of the also abundant viral ORFans. In
our viral genome database, 27% of the ORFs have no
homologs (i.e. are viral ORFans) and only 20% of the
ORFs have homologs in prokaryotes. Interestingly, by
analyzing the functions of the viral homologs using COGs
[29], we found that the percentage of ORFans' viral
homologs that correspond to poorly characterized COGs
(no COGs hits or hits to "Function unknown" or "General
function prediction only") is much larger than that of the
non-ORFans (87.2% vs. 49.5%). In any case, other alternative mechanisms may be required to explain the origin
of ORFans, including among others, duplication followed
by rapid divergence [12,30] or lateral transfer from nonviral organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced
or which have since disappeared. Most likely, as is the case
in so many cases in evolutionary biology, the origin of
ORFans will turn out to be non-exclusive [31], and may
include other yet-unknown mechanisms. Operating separately or in conjunction, these mechanisms may entail a
more complete explanation of the puzzle of the origins of
microbial and viral ORFans.

Methods
Building the ORFan dataset
We downloaded the 277 microbial genomes available at
the NCBI [32] on Nov. 03, 2005. We carried out all vs. all
(820,768 ORFs) BLASTP searches (masking the low complexity region in the query) to identify homologs for each
ORF. 1,862 short ORFs composed mainly of low complexity regions were excluded from our database. Here we
considered two proteins to be homologous if the BLASTP
score was <1e-3 (for alignment lengths <80 we used 1e-5
instead) [2].

where each Bi corresponds to a genome having a homolog

ORFs with H = 1 and one BLASTP hit were classified as singleton ORFans; ORFs with H = 1 and more than 1 BLASTP
hits were classified as paralogous ORFans; ORFs with H >
1 and U <= 0.1 were classified as orthologous ORFans.
Finding the virus homologs
We downloaded the Refseq release 13 (Sept. 2005) virus
database from NCBI [35], containing 43,566 viral proteins cross referenced to 1456 NCBI taxonomical species.
The 72 viral species in Refseq which do not encode proteins were not included in our analysis. We carried out
BLASTP searches using each microbial protein as query
against this dataset (masking with the low complexity filter). Homologs were defined as above.
Statistical analysis
All two sample tests used are Wilcoxon nonparametric
tests and are conducted by using R language [36].
