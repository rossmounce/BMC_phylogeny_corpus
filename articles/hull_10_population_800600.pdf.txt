The intraspecific evolutionary relationships of a
polymorphic raptor, Buteo jamaicensis harlani

Abstract
Background: Phenotypic and molecular genetic data often provide conflicting patterns of intraspecific
relationships confounding phylogenetic inference, particularly among birds where a variety of environmental
factors may influence plumage characters. Among diurnal raptors, the taxonomic relationship of Buteo jamaicensis
harlani to other B. jamaicensis subspecies has been long debated because of the polytypic nature of the plumage
characteristics used in subspecies or species designations.
Results: To address the evolutionary relationships within this group, we used data from 17 nuclear microsatellite
loci, 430 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region, and 829 base pairs of the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r)
to investigate molecular genetic differentiation among three B. jamaicensis subspecies (B. j. borealis, B. j. calurus,
B. j. harlani). Bayesian clustering analyses of nuclear microsatellite loci showed no significant differences between
B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis. Differences observed between B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis in mitochondrial and
microsatellite data were equivalent to those found between morphologically similar subspecies, B. j. borealis and
B. j. calurus, and estimates of migration rates among all three subspecies were high. No consistent differences were
observed in Mc1r data between B. j. harlani and other B. jamaicensis subspecies or between light and dark color
morphs within B. j. calurus, suggesting that Mc1r does not play a significant role in B. jamaicensis melanism.
Conclusions: These data suggest recent interbreeding and gene flow between B. j. harlani and the other
B. jamaicensis subspecies examined, providing no support for the historical designation of B. j. harlani as a distinct
species.

Background
The criteria necessary to recognize and define distinct
species have been frequently debated [1-3]. One of the
primary difficulties in species designation is that the
process of speciation requires an extended period of
time during which various attributes of species-level distinction are attained [2]. Depending on the length of
time since divergence, only some fraction of phenotypic
and molecular characters may have become fixed
between incipient species. Therefore, different characters
and associated species concepts may provide conflicting
inference in the determination of species status [e.g.,
[4,5]]. For example, the relative influence of genetic drift
versus natural selection, relative sizes of populations

California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA

sampled, and age of barriers to reproduction (if any) of
the species involved will affect the degree to which characters become diagnostic, thus influencing phylogenetic
inference. One manifestation of this phenomenon occurs
during the comparison of phenotypic and molecular
genetic data where conflicting patterns of divergence are
detected [see [4,6]]. Attempts to accurately define evolutionary relationships are further confounded if expression of the phenotypic trait examined is influenced by
environmental factors apart from any genomic control
and therefore does not faithfully reflect evolutionary
relationships.
Understanding the relationship between phenotypic
and molecular genetic data sets may be particularly
informative in studies of avian taxonomy where plumage characteristics have been historically used to designate subspecies as well as species [7]. Many species

and subspecies designations based upon phenotype
alone have not been supported by molecular genetic
phylogenies [e.g.,[8,9]]. In fact, among avian researchers,
the value of designating subspecies rank is subject to
ongoing debate often as vigorous as the debate over
species concepts [6,10]. Inconsistencies at both
hierarchical levels are associated with the difficulty in
understanding the underlying genetic and/or environmental basis of phenotypic characters, and consequently, interpreting phenotypic patterns alone may
mislead evolutionary inference [6,10]. Phenotypic
characters associated with melanin-based plumage may
be particularly susceptible to misinterpretation in an
evolutionary context due to environmental and temporal influences. Expression of melanin-based characters
can vary with body condition [11,12], oxidative stress
induced by environmental factors [13], and temporally
within individuals [14].
Among diurnal raptors, phenotypic differences have
fueled a long-standing controversy concerning intraspecific relationships (i.e., subspecies designations) within
the North American raptor Buteo jamaicensis (red-tailed
hawks). This controversy has been motivated primarily
by the presence of substantial variation in plumage characteristics of B. j. harlani, of which almost all individuals
display melanistic plumage. By contrast, the majority of
B. j. calurus are not melanistic, and melanistic plumage
has not been documented in either B. j. alascensis or
B. j. borealis [15,16]. Other melanin-based plumage
characters, such as tail pattern and coloration and throat
coloration, show extreme variation within B. j. harlani
but overlap to some degree with plumage characters
observed in other B. jamaicensis subspecies [17]. The
phenotypic variation within B. j. harlani has been cited
as evidence to consider it as either a distinct species,
B. harlani [18], or as a subspecies within B. jamaicensis
[19-21]. Whether observed plumage differences within
B. jamaicensis reflect long-standing evolutionarily distinct lineages or are a consequence of environmental,
temporal, or physiological factors, particularly within the
range of B. j. harlani, remains undetermined.
Previous research has examined the phylogeographic
relationships of B. j. calurus and B. j. borealis across nine
breeding populations and ten migration sites [22]. This
earlier analysis of microsatellite data in B. jamaicensis
indicated low levels of genetic differentiation among
breeding sites within recognized subspecies. Fine-scale
population substructure was identified between central
California and Intermountain West populations of
B. j. calurus (FST = 0.011 - 0.018) [22]; no other significant within-subspecies differentiation was identified.
Significant differentiation was also identified between
B. j. borealis and B. j. calurus, supporting historical
subspecies designations (FST = 0.036 - 0.039) [22,23].

Building upon this previous work, we used molecular
genetic data from the mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes to investigate the taxonomic relationship of
B. j. harlani to two common and widespread subspecies
geographically adjacent to B. j. harlani; B. j. borealis
and B. j. calurus. Specifically, we investigated whether
B. j. harlani is distinct at the species level by comparing
our results with the levels of differentiation previously
documented among subspecies of B. jamaicensis. If
B. j. harlani represents a distinct species, it should at a
minimum conform to criteria proposed for assessing
status as a subspecies, or an “evolutionary significant
unit,” [24-26]. These include reciprocal monophyly at
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and significant partitions
at nuclear loci, relative to the other named subspecies.
The results of our analyses help to resolve a long-standing taxonomic challenge and provide insight into the
role of plumage variation in species designations.

Methods
Sample collection

We collected whole blood and feathers during the
breeding season (May through June) from young in
nests and adults on breeding territories of three putative
B. jamaicensis subspecies; 178 B. j. calurus, 69 B. j. borealis,
and 24 B. j. harlani (Table 1). Additionally, we collected
samples from 21 melanistic individuals, presumably
B. j. calurus, during autumn migration. We drew approximately 0.2 mL of blood from the medial metatarsal vein

and plucked two feathers from the breast. We received
approval for our methodology from the U.C. Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number
12260). We stored blood samples in 1.5 mL of Longmire’s
lysis buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM
NaCl, 0.5% SDS) at ambient temperature in the field and at
-80°C once delivered to the laboratory and we stored feathers in envelopes in cool and dry conditions. We extracted
genomic DNA from 25 μL of blood/buffer solution or a
single feather calamus using Qiagen DNeasy kits (Qiagen
Inc.); we stored DNA at -80°C following extraction.
Microsatellite data collection and analysis

We genotyped each individual at 17 microsatellite loci
(BswA110w, BswA204w, BswA302w, BswA303w,
BswA312w, BswA317w, BswB111aw, BswB220w,
BswB221w, BswD122w, BswD127w, BswD210w,
BswD220w, BswD234w, BswD310w, BswD313w,
BswD327w) in six multiplex reactions following previously
developed methods [27]. We separated PCR products
using a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and
scored products using STRAND version 2.3.89 [28].
Because of the limited genetic differentiation previously documented among breeding populations within
B. j. calurus and B. j. borealis [23] and the focus of our
study on the taxonomic status of B. j. harlani in relation
to other subspecies, we treated subspecies as our unit of
analysis for the majority of the population genetic analyses. We tested for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in all loci using GENEPOP version 3.4 [29]
and we tested each pair of loci in each putative subspecies (B. j. calurus, B. j. borealis, and B. j. harlani) for
genotypic disequilibrium in GENEPOP. After we
assessed significance of pairwise tests using a sequential
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons [30], we
tested for the presence of null alleles and scoring error
in MICROCHECKER [31]. Previous research has indicated that the rate of scoring error for this set of microsatellites is 0.8% [23].
We used the program CONVERT version 1.31 [32] to
determine the number of private alleles in each presumed
subspecies. We used MICROSATELLITE TOOLKIT [33]
to calculate observed and expected heterozygosity of the
total sample and within each subspecies as well as the
average number of alleles per locus. Allelic richness,
weighted by sample size, was estimated for each subspecies using FSTAT version 2.9.3.2 [34].
We determined pairwise estimates of variance in allele
frequency (θST) for all subspecies pairs in ARLEQUIN
version 3.11 [35] and we used a sequential Bonferroni
correction for multiple tests to determine significance of
θST values [30]. We analyzed the relationships between
sampling localities with greater than 20 individuals by
averaging allele frequency differences among sampling

sites [36]. We used the resulting divergence matrices
with both neighbor-joining and UPGMA algorithms to
make a clustering tree in the program PHYLIP [37] and
assessed node support using 10,000 bootstrap replicates.
In order to further test for a distinction between subspecies and investigate the possibility of cryptic population differentiation beyond subspecies groupings, we
implemented a Bayesian clustering analysis in STRUCTURE version 2.1 [38]. The unit of analysis was the
individual and the algorithm implemented in Structure
probabilistically grouped individuals together into the
most likely number of populations without regard to
presumed subspecies. This approach allowed us to
determine the most likely number of population groups
(K) without a priori information about subspecies or
region of origin. We used the population admixture
model with a flat prior and assumed allele frequencies
were correlated. We allowed the program to run with a
500,000 iteration burn-in and a run length of 1,000,000
iterations and used this parameter set to explore K = 1
through K = 5 and averaged log Pr(X|K) estimates
across 10 runs for each value of K. We determined the
most likely number of populations by selecting the set
of K values where the log Pr(X|K) estimation was maximized and then selecting the minimum value for K that
did not sacrifice explanatory power [39,40]. We grouped
individuals into clusters based upon the highest proportion of ancestry to each inferred cluster.
Mitochondrial data collection

We sequenced a 430 base pair segment of domain I of
the mitochondrial control region using primers 16065F
[41] and H15454 [42]. We prepared PCR products for
sequencing with 0.5 μL exonuclease I and 1 μL shrimp
alkaline phosphatase per 25 μL PCR and delivered PCR
products to the UC Davis Sequencing Facility using primers 14965F and H15414 [43]. We aligned sequences
by eye using SEQUENCHER version 4.7 (Gene Codes
Corporation).
Phylogeographic analyses of mtDNA sequence

We conducted phylogenetic analyses of control region
sequences in PAUP* version 4.0b8 [44], using maximum
parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and distance (minimum evolution, ME). We used MODELTEST version 3.06 [45] to determine the minimum
parameter nucleotide substitution model that best fit the
mtDNA sequence data under the Akaike Information
Criterion [46]. In each analysis, we conducted heuristic
tree searches, with 20 and 100 random additions of taxa
for maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses, respectively, each followed by tree bisection-reconnection
topological rearrangements. We applied midpoint rooting, employing the close-neighbor interchange algorithm

Hull et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:224
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/224

for finding the tree, beginning with an initial neighborjoining tree. We assessed the robustness of nodes using
tree reconstructions of bootstrap-resampled data sets for
1,000 replicates under distance and parsimony criteria,
and 200 replicates for ML criteria.
We calculated the number of variable sites, number of
haplotypes, haplotype diversity, and nucleotide diversity
in DNAsp [47]. Due to the low levels of divergence
within subspecies previously documented [22], we calculated pairwise estimates of variance in haplotype frequency (FST) between each presumed subspecies using
haplotype frequencies in ARLEQUIN version 3.11 and
we assessed significance using 10,000 permutations. We
used a sequential Bonferroni correction for multiple
tests to determine significance of FST values [30].
Estimation of polarity in gene flow

To provide a coarse estimate of gene exchange among
subspecies, we calculated the number of migrants per
generation (Nem) for nuclear microsatellite and number of female migrants per generation (N f m) for
mtDNA among populations using MIGRATE version
2.0.6 [48-50]. To test for asymmetry in gene flow, we
estimated full models, θ (4Neμ or Nfμ, composite measure of effective population size and mutation rate),
and all pairwise migration parameters individually
from the data and compared them to a restricted
island model for which θ was averaged and pairwise
migration parameters were symmetrical between
populations.
We ran MIGRATE using maximum likelihood search
parameters; ten short chains (1,000 used trees out of
20,000 sampled), five long chains (10,000 used trees out
200,000 sampled), and five adaptively heated chains
(start temperatures: 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12; swapping interval = 1). We ran full models three times to ensure the
convergence of parameter estimates; we ran restricted
models once. We evaluated the alternative model for
goodness-of-fit given the data using a log-likelihood
ratio test. The resulting statistic from the log-likelihood
ratio test is equivalent to a c 2 distribution with the
degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters estimated in the two models [50].
Melanocortin 1 receptor sequencing

To determine if differences in the coding region of
melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) gene are associated with
subspecies or color variation in B. jamaicensis, we
sequenced Mc1r from 23 individuals (17 B. j. calurus;
6 B. j. harlani) using primers MSHR9 and MSHR72
[51]. We amplified an 829 bp fragment from the 945 bp
avian Mc1r coding region, excluding 56 bases from the
5’ end and 54 bases from the 3’ end of exon 1. We used
the following polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Page 4 of 12

conditions for a 15 μL total reaction: 1.5 μl 10× reaction
buffer, 0.3 μL of dNTPs (10 μM), 0.5 μL each primer
(10 μM), 0.1 μL Taq polymerase, and 20 ng DNA. We
used the following PCR cycling parameters: 94°C for
3:00, (94°C for 0:30, 61°C for 0:45, 72°C for 1:00) × 40
cycles, 72°C for 10:00, 15°C forever. We performed cycle
sequencing for both strands with Big Dye v. 2 using the
amplification primers and two additional internal
primers (intF 5’-AGCAACCTGGCAGAGACACT-3’ and
intR 5’-TGTAGAGCACCAGCATGAGG-3’; 4 μM) following standard sequencing protocols. We sequenced all
PCR products on an ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and edited the
sequences in the program Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene
Codes Corporation). We identified all heterozygous sites
by visual inspection of chromatogram peaks and confirmed each site using sequences from both strands.

Results
Microsatellite data

None of the 17 microsatellite loci significantly differed
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations and we
detected no evidence of linkage disequilibrium. We
found no evidence of null alleles. Observed heterozygosity, average number of alleles, private alleles, and
allelic richness for each sampling site are summarized
in Table 2.
Strong bootstrap support (99.8%) in the UPGMA tree
(Figure 1) indicated a distinction between all B. j. calurus
samples and the combined sample of B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani. No other nodes were supported by bootstrap analysis. Neighbor joining tree topology (not
shown) was identical to that observed in the UPGMA tree.
This result is consistent with previous UPGMA clustering
that supported a distinction between B. j. borealis and
B. j. calurus for all breeding and migration sites [22].
Pairwise θ ST values for 17 microsatellite loci among
subspecies are summarized in Table 3. We observed
significant differentiation between B. j. calurus and both
B. j. borealis and B. j. harlani. However, we did not
detect significant differences in variance in allele frequency between B. j. borealis and B. j. harlani. A sample
of 21 melanistic individuals trapped in migration in central California, presumably B. j. calurus, was significantly
different than both B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis individuals, but genetically indistinct from B. j. calurus
individuals.
Bayesian clustering analysis of breeding individuals without regard to subspecies or region of origin revealed a
maximum log Pr(X|K) for K = 2 reflecting two distinct
population clusters. One cluster corresponded to a
group composed of B. j. calurus individuals while the
second group was comprised of both B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani. As an additional test for the existence of

a distinct B. j. harlani cluster we also examined population
clustering for K = 3. We continued to find a distinct
B. j. borealis/harlani cluster while the B. j. calurus cluster
was further subdivided into a central California cluster
and an intermountain desert cluster, consistent with the
findings of Hull et al. 2008 [22]. Finally, we performed a
separate run including only B. j. borealis and B. j. harlani
samples to test whether any fine-scale structure could be
identified. For this subset of the data, the maximum log Pr
(X|K) occurred at K = 1, but was very similar to the value
at K = 2. For K = 2, no pattern of cluster ancestry was
apparent between B. j. borealis and B. j. harlani; a Yates
corrected c2 test also showed no difference in the proportion of ancestry (c21 = 1.52, P = 0.22).

Mitochondrial data

We collected control region sequence data for 198
individuals from presumptive populations of B. j. borealis
(n = 52), B. j. calurus (n = 122), and B. j. harlani (n = 24)
and observed 29 haplotypes (GenBank accession
numbers HM454161 - HM454189). Of these haplotypes,
eight were unique to B. j. borealis and five unique to
B. j. calurus; we did not identify any unique haplotypes in
B. j. harlani. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were
generally lower in B. j. calurus than in either B. j. borealis
or B. j. harlani which were relatively similar to each
other (Table 2). Distribution and frequency of control
region haplotypes among sampling sites is shown in
Figure 2. Pairwise FST comparisons among subspecies

from sites 5-9 within the breeding range of B. j. borealis; samples from site 10 within the breeding range of B. j. harlani; and we collected the
pooled samples from site 11 from migrants of unknown breeding origin, all samples from site 11 appeared phenotypically similar to typical or
melanistic B. j. calurus. Sampling areas are shown with associated frequencies of mitochondrial control region haplotypes.

Analysis of mtDNA sequence data suggested that the
best model fit to the data under the hierarchical likelihood ratio criterion was the HKY+I (0.90) +G (Γ = 0.85)

(AIC) criterion the best fit model was the K81uf+I(0.90)
+G(Γ = 0.85) [53] model with an invariant site parameter
(TrN+I). The log likelihood score for the HKY+I (0.90)
+G (Γ = 0.85 model (-lnL = 769.17) was similar to that
for the K81uf+I(0.90) +G(Γ = 0.85) model (-ln L 768.02,
AIC = 1550.05). For the HKY+I model, we estimated
the transition to transversion ratio at 14.42.
All gene tree reconstruction methods showed results
similar to the among-haplotype relationships shown in
the ME tree (Figure 3): haplotypes did not form monophyletic clades with respect to subspecies, and node
support was weak. Both ME and ML analyses gave marginal bootstrap support in few cases with no support
greater than 59% (data for ME analysis only given in
Figure 3).
We observed asymmetrical gene flow among all subspecies and across both marker types. The full model (all
parameters allowed to vary independently) had significantly higher likelihoods than the restricted island model
(equal inter-group migration rate and equal θ across
populations; microsatellite: LnL restricted = -1078.32,
LnL full = -801.21, P < 0.0001; mtDNA: LnL restricted =
-527.48, LnL full = 6.20, P < 0.0001). N e m and θ (4N e μ)
values calculated in MIGRATE from microsatellite genotypes and mtDNA ranged from 2.56 -5.60 migrants per
generation among subspecies, with θ ranging from 1.031
- 1.62 (Figure 4A), and <0.01 to 70.49 female migrants
per generation among subspecies, with θ ranging from
0.004 - 0.007 (Figure 4B). The bias in the variances and
the means indicate that, on average over generations,
gene flow has been greater from B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani to B. j. calurus than B. j. calurus to the other
two subspecies (Figure 4A, B). While gene flow estimates
between B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis appear more symmetrical (overlapping confidence intervals) when based
on microsatellite loci (Figure 4A), estimates based on
mtDNA suggest significantly greater levels of gene flow

from B. j. borealis to B. j. harlani than vice versa (Figure
4B). These estimates provide a rough estimation of the
rate of gene exchange among subspecies and should
not be viewed as precise measures. Rather, these
results should be considered in the context of whether
B. j. harlani is sufficiently isolated from other B. jamaicensis
subspecies to be considered a full species.
Mc1r results

We sequenced 829 base pairs corresponding to 276 out
of 314 amino acids in the avian Mc1r, excluding 19
amino acids in the N-terminus domain and 17 amino
acids in the C-terminus domain (GenBank accession
numbers HM454190 - HM454192). We found that six
internal nucleotides were absent relative to the Gallus
gallus Mc1r. We found three synonymous substitutions
within conserved transmembrane regions I and III, but
no non-synonymous substitutions in the 829 bp of
Mc1r sequenced from the 23 B. jamaicensis individuals
sampled (Table 5). None of the three synonymous substitutions were consistently associated with rufous,
dark, light, partial albino, or B. j. harlani color morphs.
These data suggest that the Mc1r locus in B. jamaicensis is not responsible for breast color variation or the
variable melanin-based plumage patterns observed in
B. j. harlani.

Discussion
Differentiation and genetic diversity

Our results build upon previous phylogeographic work
and show limited genetic differentiation among the
B. jamaicensis subspecies examined. The data suggest
that all three B. jamaicensis subspecies are quite similar
genetically, and that B. j. harlani shows closer evolutionary affinities to B. j. borealis than to B. j. calurus. The
close relationship and limited differentiation between
B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis is supported by lack of
significant θST and significant albeit shallow FST estimates (0.004 and 0.059 respectively), high levels of estimated of gene flow based on both marker classes,
UPGMA microsatellite groupings, Bayesian support in
the microsatellite data for a single B. j. harlani/borealis
population cluster, and absence of unique B. j. harlani
mitochondrial haplotypes. These results indicate both
historical and contemporary gene exchange between B.
j. borealis and B. j. harlani. Conversely, θ ST and F ST
estimates between B. j. calurus and the other two subspecies were significant for both marker types. Significant divergence has been observed among other North
American raptor populations and subspecies. Eastern
and western subspecies of B. lineatus (red-shouldered
hawk) displayed significant divergence in microsatellite
and mitochondrial data sets, and eastern and western
populations of Accipiter striatus (sharp-shinned hawk)

were found to be significantly diverged in the absence of
any described subspecies [54,55]. Both studies employed
the same set of microsatellite and/or mitochondrial markers as used here.
Estimates of rates of gene flow among subspecies based
upon mitochondrial and microsatellite data indicate a
high level of gene flow among all three B. jamaicensis
subspecies examined. Both mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets indicate that over time a higher level
of gene flow has occurred from B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani to B. j. calurus than from B. j. calurus to
the other subspecies. Estimates of gene flow between
B. j. borealis and B. j. harlani appear symmetrical when
considering the microsatellite data; however, the
mitochondrial estimates indicate greater gene flow from
B. j. borealis to B. j. harlani. This pattern suggests that
while rates of male migration between B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani may be equivalent, female B. j. borealis
migration rates exceed those of B. j. harlani, a result consistent with a northern Midwest source for Yukon and
Alaskan populations of B. jamaicensis.
The three recognized subspecies of B. jamaicensis
examined here also displayed similar intra-subspecific
levels of genetic diversity. Our sample of B. j. harlani
showed equivalent levels of observed heterozygosity,
allelic richness, nucleotide diversity and haplotype

diversity to B. j. calurus and B. j. borealis. We did not
find any unique B. j. harlani mitochondrial haplotypes
and only identified five private microsatellite alleles; the
absence of unique haplotypes and presence of few
unique microsatellite alleles is also suggestive of
contemporaneous gene exchange among populations
representing the sampled subspecies.
Our analysis of melanistic individuals sampled in
California during autumn migration indicated that they
were genetically indistinguishable from B. j. calurus.
Additionally, our analysis of sequence data from the
melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) showed no differences
between melanistic and non-melanistic individuals, or
between B. j. harlani and any B. j. borealis or calurus.
This suggests that the Mc1r gene does not play the
same role in B. jamaicensis melanism as in some other
avian species [51,56].
Evolutionary interpretation of genetic data

The genetic data described here do not support the
historical designation of B. j. harlani as a distinct species
[18,57]. The lack of significant differentiation between
B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis in the microsatellite data
suggests that gene exchange between the two subspecies
occurs at a relatively high level, and the lack of reciprocal monophyly among haplotypes is inconsistent with

other studies, Bayesian analyses were able to identify
fine-scale population structure between western North
American populations of both B. j. calurus and
B. swainsoni (Swainson’s hawk) employing the same set
of microsatellite markers used here [22,43]. The population divergences recovered in these examples corresponded to θ ST values of ~0.01 in both cases. In the
case of B. j. calurus, within-subspecies genetic structure
in western populations included fine-scale substructure
between central California and the Intermountain West
populations and was associated with significant morphological (overall size) differentiation. The morphological
differentiation observed between these populations of a
well described subspecies (B. j. calurus) indicates that
variation in morphology alone may not accurately reflect
speciation events. Given these previous findings using
the same marker set, the data set used here is sensitive
enough to detect species-level differentiation between
B. j. harlani and other B. jamaicensis subspecies if it
were present.

differences expected at the species level. Furthermore,
the absence of field evidence demonstrating assortative
mating among B. j. harlani individuals relative to
B. j. calurus or B. j. borealis and the apparent interbreeding with neighboring subspecies [19,58,59] also
supports recognition of B. j. harlani as a member of
B. jamaicensis, and not a distinct species. In fact, under
some criteria, the pattern observed between B. j. borealis
and B. j. harlani is inconsistent with differentiation
expected among subspecies or “evolutionary significant
units” [24-26]. Given the observed levels of differentiation based on traditional and Bayesian analyses of population structure and results of the MIGRATE analyses, it
is possible that B. j. harlani represents a post-Pleistocene northern extension of B. j. borealis populations;
however additional study is required to test this
hypothesis.
The failure to detect microsatellite differentiation
between B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis is not associated
with lack of sensitivity in the genetic tools employed. In

Relevance of phenotype

In addition to a high incidence of melanism, B. j. harlani
are highly variable in plumage particularly in tail pattern,
extent of white below chin, spotting on back, and extent
of melanism throughout body feathers [15,16,60].
The extent of variation makes description of definitive
B. j. harlani characters difficult and no diagnostic set of
B. j. harlani plumage characters has yet been accepted
[60]. Whether the variable plumage characteristics within
B. j. harlani also occur within other subspecies is also
debated. A breeding individual observed in central California displayed many of the typical B. j. harlani plumage
characters and many juvenile hawks observed during
autumn migration in California have plumage characteristics that have been suggested as belonging to B. j. harlani
[AC Hull, pers. comm.; WC Clark pers. comm.], yet these
migrant juveniles were found to be genetically similar to
the breeding populations of B. j. calurus from central
California and the Great Basin [22], not B. j. borealis or
harlani. To provide a more thorough understanding of
how plumage variation in B. jamaicensis is correlated with
nominate subspecies, additional field research is necessary
to more completely categorize the range of plumage variation throughout B. jamaicensis and describe the geographic bounds of observed variation. Additional surveys
and sampling of individuals from the Yukon, British
Columbia, and prairie region would be particularly helpful
in resolving the relationship between phenotype, environment, and population structure.
The mechanisms influencing plumage patterns in
B. j. harlani require further investigation. Potential
mechanisms include: 1) a B. j. harlani-specific gene or
gene-complex, or 2) particular environmental, temporal,

Hull et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:224
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/224

or physiological conditions within the B. j. harlani range
interacting with the standard B. jamaicensis genotype
without involvement of a unique B. j. harlani genotype.
In light of recent research that has begun to reveal the
role of environmental conditions, including temperature
and oxidative stress, on melanin-based plumage
[11-13,61], a controlled study of B. j. harlani plumage
characters would be a fruitful avenue of future research.
More broadly, the underlying factors responsible for
the base melanistic plumage in B. j. harlani, and more
generally, melanism in B. jamaicensis require additional
study. Our data suggest that the Mc1r locus does not
play a similar role as in other avian species previously
examined [51,56,62]. The gene or genes responsible for
melanism in B. jamaicensis remain to be identified.

Conclusions
These genetic data indicate low levels of differentiation
among three recognized subspecies of B. jamaicensis
examined, particularly between B. j. borealis and
B. j. harlani. In light of previous population genetic
structure investigations of species within the genus
Buteo, our findings are inconsistent with the historical
designation of B. j. harlani as a separate species. Rather,
the mtDNA data are consistent with contemporary subspecies nomenclature and data from both marker classes
suggest that gene flow is occurring at a relatively high
level among these subspecies. Additional research is
necessary to fully describe the geographical variation in
plumage observed in B. jamaicensis and to determine
the underlying mechanisms responsible for the variation
seen in B. j. harlani.
