A general co-expression network-based approach
to gene expression analysis: comparison and
applications
Jianhua Ruan1*, Angela K Dean1, Weixiong Zhang2,3*

Abstract
Background: Co-expression network-based approaches have become popular in analyzing microarray data, such
as for detecting functional gene modules. However, co-expression networks are often constructed by ad hoc
methods, and network-based analyses have not been shown to outperform the conventional cluster analyses,
partially due to the lack of an unbiased evaluation metric.
Results: Here, we develop a general co-expression network-based approach for analyzing both genes and samples
in microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction method, a
parameter-free module discovery algorithm and a novel reference network-based metric for module evaluation. We
report some interesting topological properties of rank-based co-expression networks that are very different from
that of value-based networks in the literature. Using a large set of synthetic and real microarray data, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over several popular existing algorithms. Applications of
our approach to yeast, Arabidopsis and human cancer microarray data reveal many interesting modules, including
a fatal subtype of lymphoma and a gene module regulating yeast telomere integrity, which were missed by the
existing methods.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that our novel approach is very effective in discovering the modular structures in
microarray data, both for genes and for samples. As the method is essentially parameter-free, it may be applied to
large data sets where the number of clusters is difficult to estimate. The method is also very general and can be
applied to other types of data. A MATLAB implementation of our algorithm can be downloaded from http://cs.utsa.

Background
The vast amount of available high-throughput gene
expression data has provided excellent opportunities for
studying gene functions on a global scale. Since genes
on the same pathways or in the same functional complex often exhibit similar expression patterns under
diverse temporal and physiological conditions, one common practice in microarray data analysis is to cluster
genes according to their expression similarities. The
clusters can then be analyzed in several ways, such as
promoter analysis or gene ontology analysis [1]. Since

clustering procedures are often subjective, and usually
ignore the detailed relationships among genes, the biological insight obtained from clustering results is often
limited. Alternatively, many studies have attempted to
construct gene regulatory networks from microarray
data using methods such as linear models [2], Bayesian
networks [3] and Boolean networks [4]. These
approaches, however, are successful only on rare cases
where the system is well constrained and the training
data is sufficiently large.
Recently, as a tradeoff between the crude cluster analysis and detailed network modeling, gene co-expression
networks have become a rapidly developing area of
study and many interesting results have been obtained
[5-20]. A gene co-expression network is an undirected
graph, where the graph nodes correspond to genes, and

edges between genes represent significant co-expression
relationships [10,18]. Compared to regulatory networks,
a gene co-expression network does not attempt to distinguish direct gene interactions from indirect ones; on
the other hand, a gene co-expression network contains
gene neighborhood relations that are usually overlooked
in cluster analysis [21]. gives an interesting geometric
interpretation of gene co-expression networks and connects co-expression network analysis to traditional
microarray data analysis techniques. Databases of gene
co-expression networks for several model organisms
have been constructed from large numbers of microarray data sets [22,23].
One of the most important applications of gene coexpression networks is to identify functional gene modules, which often manifest themselves as dense subnetworks. While earlier studies attempted to apply
clustering algorithms directly to the adjacency matrices
of networks in order to partition network nodes into
groups [10,14], later studies have relied on graph partitioning algorithms or special purpose algorithms for
identifying subnetworks of certain properties
[5-7,11,17,18,20]. These studies have provided many
interesting biological results; however, none of them has
demonstrated that the network-based methods for
detecting functional modules can significantly outperform the conventional cluster analysis, partially due to
the lack of an unbiased metric for quantitatively evaluating the functional significance of gene modules. In principle, nearly all the previous gene co-expression network
construction methods fall into two categories: those that
utilize the similarity values (value-based) [5-16,24], and
those that utilize the rank-transformed similarities
(rank-based) [17,18,20]. In the value-based (rank-based)
method, two genes are connected if the (rank-transformed) similarity between their expression profiles is
above a certain threshold, which can be chosen in an ad
hoc manner or semi-automatically. Similarities may be
measured by Pearson correlation coefficient or other
metrics. Some researchers proposed to use conditional
correlations to partially remove indirect links [24].
Thresholds are usually chosen using an ad hoc methods
[16], or by controlling statistical significance of similarities [10,19]. A semi-automatic method has also been
proposed based the topological difference between real
and random co-expression networks [8]. In addition,
several methods have been proposed to adjust raw similarity values based on neighborhood information such as
shortest path connections or topological overlaps, which
usually result in weighted gene co-expression networks
[6,16]. Most of the existing studies used the value-based
method, while the relative advantages and disadvantages
of the rank-based or the value-based network construction methods have not been rigorously examined.

A number of studies have analyzed the topological
properties of gene co-expression networks [10-13,18,25],
and have shown that gene co-expression networks have
the well-known small-world and scale-free properties,
similar to many other biological networks and realworld networks [26,27]. On the other hand, these studies have also reported that gene co-expression networks differ from other types of biological networks in
several important aspects, such as the characteristic
node degree and hierarchical organization. However,
most of the conclusions were drawn from value-based
co-expression networks. In fact, we will show that the
rank-based network has all the common topological
properties of the other biological networks, and is significantly different from the value-based network.
In this work, we propose a general co-expression network-based approach for analyzing microarray data, for
both genes and samples. Our approach consists of a
method for rank-based network construction, a parameter-free graph partitioning algorithm for module discovery and a novel reference network-based metric for
module evaluation. We compare our approach with the
existing methods, and show several real applications of
our approach.
We first introduce a simple rank-based method to
construct co-expression networks, and compare the
topologies of value-based and rank-based gene coexpression networks. We find that the rank-based network significantly differs from the value-based network
in several important aspects, and we argue that the former is able to better capture the global topology of the
underlying biological system, including both strongly
and weakly co-expressed modules, while the latter is
dominated by the most strongly co-expressed modules.
Second, we introduce an efficient graph partitioning
algorithm, Qcut, to identify relatively dense modules,
also known as communities, in the rank-based networks.
Compared to other graph partitioning algorithms, Qcut
is parameter free, as it uses an objective function called
modularity to automatically determine the optimal partitioning and the number of partitions [28]. We have
recently shown that the method can be used to discover
natural communities from social networks and to predict protein complexes from protein-protein interaction
networks [28], while its effectiveness in finding intrinsic
modular structures from gene expression data has not
been thoroughly studied.
Third, we propose a novel metric for comparing different module detection algorithms in terms of the overall functional significance of the gene modules being
identified. We introduce the concept of a reference network, which can be obtained from other information
sources, such as protein-protein interaction networks or
ChIP-chip data. This metric is then used to quantify the

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/8

performance of a gene module detection algorithm by
the agreement between the modules identified from the
co-expression network and the modular structure of the
reference network. It is important to note this metric is
not biased by the number of modules and the module
size distribution.
We assessed our approach for finding gene modules
on a large set of synthetic microarray data with known
modular structures as well as several real data sets. On
synthetic data, our method correctly predicted the number of modules, and performed significantly better than
several popular clustering algorithms and one of the
best graph partitioning algorithms, the Markov Clustering algorithm [29]. On real data, we evaluated the performance of our method using both a popular (but in
our opinion biased) metric based on gene ontology
enrichment scores, and the aforementioned reference
network-based metric. We show that our method can
significantly outperform the existing algorithms according to all the metrics used.
We also applied our method to construct and analyze
a sample co-expression network using microarray data
of normal and cancerous T and B cells including diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [30]. Remarkably, our
method almost perfectly separated the different cell
types into their own subnetworks without any prior
knowledge. We also re-discovered the two known subtypes of DLBCL, where one subtype has a much lower
survival rate than the other.
Finally, we report several interesting results that may
worth further investigation. In yeast, we identified many
gene modules that are both strongly co-expressed and
co-regulated; among them, a small module where majority genes have no known functions may be involved in
telomere maintenance. In the sample co-expression network, we discovered a tumor cell module that seems to
be a new subtype of DLBCL that is associated with the
lowest survival rate among all DLBCL patients.

Results and Discussion
Co-expression network construction and topological
analysis
Constructing co-expression networks

Most of the existing co-expression analyses construct
value-based networks. We believe that the value-based
methods are significantly limited by their use of a
homogeneous threshold for all the genes in the network.
In reality, genes in different functional pathways may be
regulated by different mechanisms, and therefore may
exhibit different patterns of co-expression. In particular,
genes in one functional pathway may be strongly
mutually co-expressed, while genes in another functional
pathway may be only weakly co-expressed. As a result, if
we choose a stringent global threshold, many genes in

Page 3 of 21

the weakly co-expressed pathway may be disconnected.
On the other hand, if we attempt to connect the weakly
co-expressed genes into the network, the threshold may
become so low that the genes in the strongly coexpressed pathway may have many links to genes in
other pathways, making further analysis difficult. For
example, as shown in Figure 1, to construct a co-expression network for the 3000 yeast genes that we will see in
the next subsection, if we allow only 10% of the genes to
have no connections, most genes will have more than
300 connections, while if we reduce the median degree
to 10, more than one third of the genes will have no
connection at all.
To deal with this problem, we propose a simple rankbased method to construct co-expression networks. We
first calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (or
some other similarity measure) between every pair of
genes. For each gene gi, we rank all other genes by their
similarity to g i . We then connect every gene to the d
genes that are most similar to it. Compared to the
value-based method, the rank-based method essentially
uses different local similarity threshold for different
genes. It is important to mention that even with a fixed
d, the number of connections for different genes is not
constant. This is because of the asymmetric nature of
the ranking. In other words, the rank of gene i with
respect to gene j is not necessarily equal to the rank of
gene j with respect to gene i. Therefore, although gene i
has only d genes on its top-d list, other genes that are
not on i’s list may list i as one of their top-d genes. The
mean degree is between d and 2d, the minimum degree
is d, and the maximum degree can be as large as n - 1,
with n being the number of genes in the network.
The rank-based method may appear to be limited by a
similar drawback of the value-based method - the former uses a global rank threshold and the latter uses a
global value threshold for all genes. However, as we discussed above, in the rank-based network, different genes
can have different number of connections, even though
all genes have the same rank threshold, because of the
asymmetric nature of ranking. More importantly, our
objective is not to identify all co-expressed genes for
each gene, but to construct a sparse network such that
the modular structure of the system can be successfully
identified. To achieve this, a good co-expression network needs to have the following two properties: (i)
there are very few false-positive connections, and (ii)
nodes within modules are well connected into a single
component, while connections between modules are
sparse. A value-based network can hardly provide the
two properties simultaneously, for reasons given above.
In contrast, the key idea in our rank-based method is
that by using a uniform small value of d, we ensure that
(i) the network only contains highly reliable edges, and

(ii) each module of the network is (almost) fully connected into a single component, both theoretically and
empirically (see below). As in most clustering algorithms, we assume that gene expressions in different
modules are generated by different distributions, while
gene expressions in the same module are generated by a
common (unknown) distribution. Therefore, the rankbased sub-network of genes from the same module is a
nearest neighbor graph constructed on a set of random
geometric points. Theoretically, it is known that a nearest neighbor graph on random geometric points has a
high probability to be connected even with a very small
number of neighbors (d) [31]. To empirically test this as
well as to find the range of d for typical microarray
data, we randomly generated a data set with 1000 genes
and various dimensions (conditions) using Gaussian distribution. We then constructed a rank-based co-expression network using different values of d and measured
the number of disconnected components in the resulting network. Remarkably, we find that for data of
dimension > 10, a nearest neighbor graph with 1000
nodes is almost always fully connected with d = 2 neighbors. Even for data of smaller dimensions, the graph can
be connected with at most 4 neighbors (Figure 2). The

results do not vary significantly when the number of
genes or the type of distribution is changed. In the next
subsection, we also show that the yeast gene co-expression network is connected with d = 2. In practice we
find a value of d between 3 and 5 is sufficient for most
cases. This simple network construction method can
also be combined with other strategies that were developed for value-based networks. For example, the raw
similarity values can be refined by considering local
neighborhood or shortest path information before rank
transformation [16]; when selecting edges according to
ranks, a threshold based on raw similarity values may be
imposed simultaneously to ensure confidence in the
edges being created. Ideally, methods can also be developed to automatically select the optimal d, as in [8].
The rank-based method can also be applied to construct
networks of other entities, as long as a similarity measure can be defined. One example is to construct a network of samples from microarray data, where the nodes
are samples and the similarity between two samples can
be measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient
between their gene expression profiles. Later we will
show an application of a sample co-expression network
where each sample is a cell type.

Topology of yeast co-expression networks

Previous studies have analyzed the topologies of various
networks, including biological and social networks, and
suggested three common topological properties: scalefree, small-world, and hierarchically modular
[26,27,32-34]. Although debate exists [35,36], it is generally believed that these properties may be related to the
robustness and stability of the underlying systems
[26,27,32-34]. For example, a small-world network has a
small diameter and a large clustering coefficient (see
Methods), which is believed to be related to an efficient
and controlled flow of information [26,34]. In a scalefree network, the probability for a node to have k edges
follows a power-law distribution, i.e. P(k) = c × k-g. The
implication of the scale-free property is that a few nodes
in the network are highly connected, acting as hubs,
while most nodes have low degrees. Scale-free networks
are believed to be robust to random failures, but vulnerable to deliberate attacks [27,32]. In comparison, in a
random network (specifically, an Erdos-Renyi random
network [26]), connections are spread almost uniformly
across all nodes [26,34]. Furthermore, although a random network may also have a small diameter, it usually
has a near zero clustering coefficient [26,34]. Several
studies have analyzed the value-based gene co-expression networks, and reported some interesting but controversial results [11-13,25]. Here we analyze the

topologies of both the rank-based and the value-based
networks, and compare with previous results.
We obtained a set of yeast gene expression data measured in 173 different time points under various stress
conditions [37], and selected 3000 genes that showed
the highest variations. We constructed four gene coexpression networks using the rank-based method with
d = 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. For each rank-based network, we constructed two random networks as follows.
First, we randomly permuted the expression data of
each gene independently, and constructed a rank-based
network using the permuted data. Second, we randomly
rewired the connections in a true rank-based network,
but preserved the degree for every node [34]. For comparison, we also constructed four value-based networks,
using the Pearson correlation coefficient as a similarity
measure. The thresholds were chosen such that the
average degrees are 10, 30, 50, and 100, respectively, in
the resulting networks. Similar to the rank-based networks, we obtained two random networks for each true
value-based network, one constructed from randomly
permuted data and the other by randomly rewiring the
true network.
Table 1 lists some statistics of these networks. In the
rank-based networks, almost all genes are linked to the
largest component with d as small as 2. Furthermore,
compared to both the randomly rewired networks and

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8

number of high degree nodes than the rank-based
networks.
To quantify the difference between the degree distributions of the value-based and rank-based networks, we
fitted a power-law function for the degree distribution
of each network to determine its g parameter. The
values of g in the rank-based networks are consistently
between two and three. This is typical in many biological networks such as PPI networks and metabolic networks, as well as in real-world social and technology
networks [26,34]. In comparison, the g values in the
value-based networks are below one (Figure 3b). Theoretically, it is known that a scale-free network with g < 2
has no finite mean degree when its size grows to infinity, and is dominated by nodes with large degrees [26].
Therefore, small values of g for co-expression networks
were reported in several previous studies as a significant
difference between the co-expression networks and
other biological networks [15,17]. Our results suggest
that this difference may simply be an artifact of the network construction method. Consider that genes in some
modules are strongly co-expressed with one another,
while genes in some other modules are weakly coexpressed. Using the value-based method, when the
similarity cutoff is gradually decreased, the genes within
the strongly co-expressed modules will be first connected, up to a point that they are almost completely
connected, before any gene in the weakly co-expressed
modules can be connected to their within-module partners. As a result, the co-expression network will have

the networks constructed from randomly permuted data,
the true rank-based co-expression networks have slightly
larger average path lengths and diameters, but much larger clustering coefficients, indicating that the rank-based
co-expression networks have the small-world property.
In contrast, the true value-based co-expression networks
contain many singletons. For example, with a Pearson
correlation coefficient threshold of 0.69, about 900
genes are singletons, even though the average node
degree is much higher than in the rank-based networks.
Furthermore, although the value-based networks have
high clustering coefficients, their randomly rewired
counterparts have almost similarly high clustering coefficients. This observation suggests that the high clustering
coefficient of the value-based networks is partially
because their non-singleton nodes are almost completely
connected, in which case the structure cannot be
destroyed by any random rewiring.
Figure 3(a) and 3(b) shows the degree distributions of
these networks. As indicated by a linear relationship in
the log-log plot, the rank-based networks constructed
from the real data exhibit a power-law degree distribution for all the d values considered. This suggests that
an overall scale-free topology is a fairly robust feature of
the co-expression networks. In contrast, the networks
constructed from randomly permuted gene expression
data contain significantly fewer high-degree nodes, and
exhibit exponential degree distributions. The valuebased networks appear to follow power-law degree distributions as well; however, they have a much larger

many genes with large degrees, resulting in a small slope
in the log-log plot. In contrast, with the rank-based
method, genes in both strongly and weakly co-expressed
modules can be connected, as essentially a different
similarity threshold is used for each gene. Therefore,
rank-based networks can usually capture the topology of
both strongly and weakly co-expressed modules, while
value-based networks are often dominated by the
strongly co-expressed modules.
Moreover, previous studies have reported that gene
co-expression networks lack the hierarchically modular
property [11,12]. This property is characterized by a
reciprocal relationship between a node’s degree and its
clustering coefficient [33]. Again, we have found that
this claim only applies to the value-based networks. As
shown in Figure 3(c), there is a clear reciprocal relationship between the node degree and node clustering coefficient in the rank-based networks, when compared to
the value-based networks. This suggests that gene coexpression network can also have hierarchical structures.
Together, these experiments show that the rank-based
co-expression networks have all the common topological
properties of many other biological networks, while the
value-based networks seem to differ significantly.
Although these do not necessarily prove that rank-based
networks are biologically more meaningful than valuebased networks, the former seems to be able to capture
the underlying topological structures better.

subnetwork, must contain more intra-community edges
than would be expected by chance if the connections
were random. With this motivation, we developed an
algorithm to optimize an objective function called modularity, which is precisely defined as the percentage of
intra-community edges minus the random expectation
(see Methods). The algorithm, named Qcut, has been
shown to be effective in finding statistically significant
and practically interesting graph partitions in many synthetic networks, social networks, and biological networks, without any user-tunable parameters, and has
outperformed the existing algorithms based on similar
motivations [28].
We evaluate the performance of Qcut on gene coexpression networks in several ways. We first use synthetic microarray data where the true modular structure
is known, so that we can directly measure the accuracy.
We then use two real microarray data sets to evaluate
the overall biological significance of the identified gene
modules, with two different metrics. The first metric is
a commonly used approach based on the enrichment of
specific Gene Ontology terms in the modules, which
may be biased by the number of modules and module
sizes. The second is a new metric that we introduced
based on the idea of reference networks, which can be
obtained from a variety of sources, such as gene annotations or protein-protein interaction networks (See
methods).

Module discovery and analysis in gene co-expression
networks

Evaluation using synthetic microarray data

Gene co-expression networks with thousands of nodes
are difficult to visualize and comprehend. A useful strategy for analyzing such a network is to partition it into
subnetworks, where the nodes within each subnetwork
are relatively densely connected to one another but have
fewer connections to the other subnetworks. In gene coexpression networks, such subnetworks can be considered as candidates of functional modules, as genes
within each subnetwork are mutually co-expressed,
while co-expression between genes in different subnetworks are sparse. Many graph partitioning algorithms
have been developed in computer science [38]. Similar
to clustering, one major difficulty in graph partitioning
is to determine the number of partitions. Some methods
do not require this to be explicitly determined in
advance, but require other parameters, which are also
difficult to obtain. For example, MCL, one of the best
graph partitioning algorithms, requires an inflation parameter, and setting the parameter to different values may
result in very different results [29].
To address this difficulty, we introduce an algorithm
that we have developed recently for identifying “communities” in arbitrary networks [28]. The main motivation
for the algorithm is that each “community”, or a

To objectively evaluate the accuracy of the modules
detected by Qcut, we tested it on a large collection of
synthetic gene expression data. The data sets, available
at http://www.biostat.pitt.edu/bioinfo/publication.htm,
were used to evaluate many clustering algorithms in a
previous study [39]. Each data set contains simulated
expression data of approximately 600 genes under 50
conditions. Each gene was pre-assigned to one of fifteen
clusters, and the genes in the same cluster had their
expression profiles generated from a common log normal distribution. Gaussian noises were then added to
the data set to simulate experimental noises. A higher
level of Gaussian noise generally makes the data more
difficult to cluster. Since the correct clusters are known,
we used a well-known metric called the adjusted Rand
Index to measure the accuracy of Qcut (see Methods)
[40].
We first compared the accuracy of Qcut on co-expression networks constructed by three methods: valuebased, rank-based, and CLR [19]. We used Euclidean
distance as the basis to measure the dissimilarity
between two genes. For the value-based method, we
normalized the distance to be between 0 and 1, and
constructed a series of co-expression networks for each
data set using different threshold values. As shown in

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/8

Figure 4(a), the threshold that results in the best clustering accuracy varies for different data set. For more noisy
data set a larger threshold value is needed, which suggests that choosing a right threshold is critical for the
value-based method. The CLR method, in contrast, by
converting the raw distances to z-scores, effectively
removed such dependency and the best clustering accuracy is achieved at the same z-score equal to 2, corresponding to a p-value 0.05, for all data sets (Figure 4b).
Interestingly, for the rank-based method, the clustering
accuracy is almost invariant for rank cutoffs between 2
and 8 (Figure 4c). Figure 4(d) shows the best accuracy
that can be achieved on the three types of networks. As
can be seen, the rank-based networks clearly have the
highest accuracy for intermediate levels of noises (SD =
0.4 or 0.8). For data with lower noises, all three methods
resulted in perfect accuracy, and for data set with the
highest level of noise (SD = 1.2), all three methods converges to about the same accuracy. Next we compared
the clustering accuracy of Qcut on rank-based networks
with several widely-used clustering algorithms including
k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering [1], and tight
clustering [39], applied directly to the gene expression
data without deriving co-expression networks. In this
test, Qcut was applied to rank-based co-expression networks constructed using d values equal to 4. In addition,
we also tested one of the best graph partitioning algorithms called the Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL)
[29], which is applied to rank-based networks as well.
Since the results of MCL depend heavily on the choice
of an inflation parameter (I), we applied MCL to the
rank-based networks constructed with d fixed at 4, but
varied I from 1.3 to 1.7, with an increment of 0.1, and
took the best clustering accuracy resulted from these
parameters. We used the MATLAB (the MathWorks
Inc.) implementation of the k-means and hierarchical
clustering algorithms. k-means clustering was run with k
equal to 15, and was repeated 50 times for each data set
to obtain the best results. The hierarchical clustering
was performed using average linkage, and the final cluster tree was cut at an appropriate depth to generate 15
clusters. The accuracies of tight clustering were directly
obtained from the original study that was done on the
same data set [39]. Our evaluation results show that,
even without any parameter tuning, Qcut outperformed
the competing algorithms in identifying the true modular structures embedded within the synthetic microarray
data. As shown in Figure 5, the clustering accuracy of
Qcut is clearly better than that of the hierarchical clustering and tight clustering. The accuracy of Qcut is similar to k-means, except for the data sets of the highest
level of noise. The synthetic data set with the highest
level of noise may represent an extreme case in practice,
as many of the clusters in this data set are not

Page 9 of 21

distinguishable visually (Figure S1 in Additional File 1).
However, k-means achieved this accuracy with the number of clusters given explicitly, while Qcut did not have
this information at all. In these synthetic data sets, the
number of clusters is the single most important parameter and k-means is expected to work well when that
is known. We tried to combine k-means with several
popular methods to automatically determine the number
of clusters, including the gap statistic [41], Silhouette
[42], and the Dunn’s Index [43]. Our results suggest
that if the values of k are automatically determined, kmeans performs much poorer than our method, especially for data sets with SD ≥ 0.4 (Figure 5). The results
of MCL are two-fold. On one hand, when an appropriate inflation parameter is chosen (I = 1.5 in this experiment), MCL has an accuracy similar to that of Qcut,
except for the data set with the highest noises, indicating a superior performance of graph-based algorithms in
general. On the other hand, the accuracy of MCL
depends on the choice of the inflation parameter, and
may be much lower than that of clustering algorithms if
a suboptimal inflation parameter is used (data not
shown).
Functional modules in a yeast gene co-expression network

To evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real
biological data, we applied Qcut to cluster the four
rank-based yeast co-expression networks constructed in
the previous subsection. The best numbers of clusters
suggested by Qcut for the four networks are 24, 20, 12
and 12, respectively. As shown on synthetic data, when
the number of clusters is known, the clustering algorithms that explicitly use this information, such as kmeans, perform better than those without this information, such as the hierarchical clustering. Therefore, here
we compared the performance of Qcut to k-means and
two other popular clustering algorithms, namely selforganizing maps (SOM) [44] and spectral clustering
[45], both of which require the number of clusters to be
given. Applying the value-based method to the yeast
data set, as we showed in Figure 1, the network either
contains too many singletons, or are too densely connected to be partitioned by Qcut (or any other graph
algorithms). Therefore, we did not evaluate its accuracy
on the real data set. Interestingly CLR had similar behavior as the value-based method on the yeast data set,
indicating that it is partially value-based.
We used the SOM implementation in the microarray
software suite TM4 from TIGR, and implemented our
own version of spectral clustering. K-means, SOM and
spectral clustering were applied directly to the expression data, using Pearson correlation coefficient as the
similarity metric. We obtained 24, 20, 12 and 9 clusters
using each of the three competing algorithms. To test if
the competing algorithms may give a better result with

a function of the distance cutoffs. (b) Clustering accuracy on CLR co-expression networks, as a function of the Z-score cutoffs. (c) Clustering

a different setting of the number of clusters, we also
applied the spectral clustering with the number of clusters k equal to 5, 6, ..., 25. SOM was executed on 4 × 6,
4 × 5, 3 × 4, and 3 × 3 grids to produce the desired
number of clusters. Because Qcut identified 12 clusters
on both the d = 4 and d = 5 networks, we compared
the 12 clusters identified from the d = 5 network by
Qcut with the 9 clusters identified by the competing
algorithms to avoid redundant comparison. Another reason for this comparison is that Qcut often produces a
few small clusters, while the clusters of the competing
algorithms are relatively uniform in size. Therefore, the
“effective” number of clusters is smaller for Qcut than
for other algorithms, so we used this comparison to
compensate for the differences in cluster sizes.
To validate the biological significance of the clusters,
we first counted the number of Gene Ontology (GO)
terms enriched in the clusters and the percentage of
clusters that had at least one enriched GO term, at various significance levels. As shown in Figure 6, the clusters identified by Qcut contain more enriched GO terms
than the competing algorithms for most of the p-value
cutoffs (Figure 6(a)-(d)). Furthermore, the percentage of
clusters containing at least one enriched GO term is
also higher for Qcut than for the other algorithms (Figure 6(e)-(h)).
Second, as the above measurement may be biased by
the number of clusters or the cluster size distributions,
we compared these algorithms using a novel metric

based on three reference networks that capture different
functional interactions between genes: a co-annotation
network based on GO terms of biological processes, a
co-regulation network based on ChIP-chip data, and a
PPI network (see Methods). While the PPI network has
unweighted edges, the GO-based and ChIP-based reference networks have weighted edges. We discretized the
GO-based and ChIP-based reference networks using a
series of weight cutoffs. We then scored the gene modules identified by each algorithm using these reference
networks (see Methods). As shown in Figure 7 and Figure S2 in Additional File 1, the gene modules identified
by Qcut always had the highest score, using all three
types of reference networks. The spectral clustering
algorithm performed better than the other clustering
algorithms. As Qcut and the spectral clustering algorithm share some similar spirit in capturing the topology
embedded in a data matrix, this result seems to suggest
that topological features are important for achieving
good clustering results on gene expression data. We also
randomly shuffed the gene modules identified by Qcut
while preserving the sizes of the modules, and scored
the random clusters using the reference networks. The
scores for the random modules are very close to zero in
all cases (Figure 7 and Figure S2 in Additional File 1),
indicating that the results obtained by
Qcut and the clustering algorithms are not due to chance

The modules in the d = 2 co-expression network have
the worst scores according to all three reference

networks (Figure 7 and Figure S2 in Additional File 1),
indicating that the d = 2 network might be too sparse
to capture all functional relationships. The d = 4 coexpression network has the highest scores according to
all three reference networks, while the networks with d
= 3 or 5 give slightly worse results. As stated above, to
test if the competing algorithms may give a better result
with a different setting of the number of clusters, we
applied the spectral clustering, which has a better accuracy than the other two algorithms, with the number of
clusters k equal to 5, 6, ..., 25. We scored the gene modules using the GO-based reference network at a weight
cutoff of 0.8. As shown in Figure S3 in Additional File
1, the best module score achieved by spectral clustering
is 0.323 (at k = 13), which is significantly lower than the
module score by Qcut (Q = 0.384). This shows that our
evaluation results have not been biased by the number
of clusters.
In addition, we combined k-means with gap-statistic
[41], which estimated the optimal number of clusters to
be 6. We also tested SOTA [46], a hierarchical version
of SOM that can automatically determine the number
of clusters. SOTA returned 11 clusters, a number similar to our optimal number. However, only 6 of the 11
clusters had significantly enriched functions, and the
most significant function had a p-value 10-49, as compared to 10-106 in our method (Table 2 and Table S1 in
Additional File 1).

most significantly enriched GO biological process terms
and the transcription factors whose targets are significantly enriched in the module (see Methods). As shown,
most modules contain highly coherent functional terms,
and are co-regulated by common transcription factors.
For example, the majority of genes in module 12 are
involved in protein biosynthesis (p = 10-85), and can be
bound by FHL1 (p = 10-105) and RAP1 (p = 10-48), both
of which are known to be involved in rRNA processing
and regulating ribosomal proteins [47]. Module 9 is significantly enriched with genes that are involved in generation of precursor metabolites and energy (p = 10-33),
and can be bound by HAP4 (p = 10-16), a TF regulating
carbohydrate metabolism [47]. Module 2 contains
almost two-thirds of the ribosome biogenesis genes (p =
10 -106 ), but no TFs were found to bind to this set of
genes specifically. Module 11 is enriched with genes that
can be bound by eight different TFs. Interestingly, all
eight TFs are known cell-cycle regulators [47]. Several
small modules correspond to specific functional groups.
For example, 17 of the 22 genes in module 10 are
involved in Ty element transposition (p = 10-29). Half of
the 18 genes in module 3 are related to chromatin
assembly or disassembly (p = 10 -13 ); six of them are
regulated by transcription factors HIR1/2/3, which are
known to be involved in the transcription of histone
genes [47]. Modules 5 and 7 contain both a large fraction of genes with unknown functions and groups of
genes with significantly enriched common functions or
common TFs. It is possible that these uncharacterized

genes also have the functions that are enriched in the
module.
We also found a very interesting small module that
may deserve further investigation. Among the 25 genes
in module 4, four genes have a common function in telomere maintenance (p = 10-7). While the majority (16)
of the remaining genes encode hypothetic proteins and
have unknown functions (p = 10-6), a careful inspection
showed that all four characterized genes and five of the
16 uncharacterized ones are located near telomeric
regions [47]. Moreover, a significant number of genes in
this module are regulated by four common transcription
factors: GAT3 (p = 10-21), YAP5 (p = 10-17), PDR1 (p =
10-11 ), and MSN4 (p = 10 -11 ) (Figure 8 and Table 2).
Our results suggest that these uncharacterized genes as
well as the four transcription factors are very likely to
be involved in the function or maintenance of telomere,
which has not been reported in the literature.
Functional modules in an Arabidopsis gene co-expression
network

To test our method on high organisms, we applied it to
a set of Arabidopsis gene expression data downloaded
from the AtGenExpress database http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/plantphys/AFGN/atgenex.htm. We studied the
cold stress response, for which the dataset contains the
expression of 22 k Arabidopsis genes in the root and
shoot tissues in six time points following cold stress
treatment and under the normal condition. We selected
2545 genes that are up-or down-regulated by at least
five-folds in at least one of the six time points in either
tissue. We then constructed a co-expression network by
connecting each gene to its top three correlated genes
(i.e. d = 3), resulting in 5838 co-expression links in total.
Our clustering algorithm partitioned the network into
19 modules, with a Q value of 0.81, indicating a strong
modular structure. Similar to the previous experiment,
we first examined the GO terms enriched in the clusters

Page 14 of 21

at various significance levels, and compared them with
the results of the k-means algorithm with k = 19. As
shown in Figure 9(a) and 9(b), the modules identified by
our method contain significantly more enriched GO
terms than that identified by k-means, and GO terms
are enriched in more modules in our method than in kmeans. Furthermore, our method achieved significantly
higher module scores in the GO-based reference networks than the k-means algorithm (Fig 9(c)). Table S2
in Additional File 1 lists the most enriched functional
categories for each module. Several modules are
enriched with functions that are known to be related to
cold stress responses, e.g. modules 7 (photosynthesis, p
= 10-16), 11 (circadian rhythm, p = 10-5), 14 (response
to heat, p = 10-15), 15 (antiporter activity, p = 10-6) and
18 (lipid binding, p = 10-8). Due to the scarcity of functional annotations in Arabidopsis, the enrichment pvalues as well as the module scores of the gene modules
are less significant in Arabidopsis than in yeast, which is
to be expected.
Cancer subtype classification from sample co-expression
networks

In this subsection, we show that our co-expression network analysis method can also be applied to identify
sample modules. Conceptually, there is no difference in
constructing and analyzing gene or sample co-expression networks: in the latter we treat each sample as a
network node, and connect two samples when their
expression profiles are similar according to some similarity measure. In practice, however, sample co-expression networks are usually smaller than gene coexpression networks, but the edges in sample co-expression networks may be computed from very high-dimensional data, since each sample is described by thousands
of genes. It is therefore interesting to see whether the
same network construction and module detection methods can be applied here without much tuning of the

from a TF to a gene represents a protein-DNA interaction. All other edges represent co-expression relationships.

parameter, i.e. the value of d. As an application of our
approach, we applied our method towards an automatic
classification of tumor cells.
An accurate classification of tumor cells is crucial for
effective therapy [48]. Traditionally, tumors have been
classified by their morphologic appearance, which is,
unfortunately, often very subjective. Furthermore,
tumors with similar histological features may respond
very differently to chemotherapy [30]. To address this
problem, a promising alternative or complementary
strategy is to classify tumors based on their genetic profiles, i.e. the activity of hundreds or thousands of genes
that are involved in the disease. Most of the existing
tumor classification approaches are based on supervised
learning, such as support vector machines or decision
trees, which aimed at identifying genetic features to distinguish two or more known tumor (sub-)types [49,50].
Here, we ask whether it is possible to automatically
classify tumor samples in the absence of training data
that provide known tumor (sub-)types or even the number of distinct (sub-)types. This unsupervised learning
approach has a few advantages over supervised learning
methods. First, the existing tumor classifications are
based on histological features, which may be unreliable
themselves. Second, using unsupervised learning, we
may be able to discover novel tumor sub-types that
have not been characterized by histological features previously. On the other hand, it is crucial to confirm

whether the automatically discovered tumor (sub-)types
are biologically meaningful and indeed provide useful
information for understanding the disease mechanism
or for improving its treatment.
In this study, we chose to focus on lymphoma, a
family of tumors involving cells of the immune system.
We obtained a data set containing the expression data
of 4026 genes for 96 samples belonging to nine cell
types, including three different types of tumors, namely,
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCB), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL),
as well as normal B and T cells at different stages of cell
differentiation [30]. We constructed a rank-based network of the samples using Pearson correlation coefficient as the similarity measure and the value of d at 5.
Edges with a Pearson correlation coefficient < 0.2 were
removed to reduce false connections.
Applying Qcut to the network, we identified eight
modules. Remarkably, without any prior knowledge
about the number of cell types in the samples, our algorithm automatically separated different cell types into
different modules, with a few exceptions (Figure 10 and
Table S3 in Additional File 1). Furthermore, the results
are almost invariant when we varied d between 3 and 7,
indicating a very stable modular structure among the
samples. As shown in Figure 10, blood T cells and activated blood B cells are perfectly classified into their own
modules. CLL and resting B cells are grouped into a

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/8

single module, which is not surprising since the CLL has
a very low proliferation rate, similar to resting B cells
[30]. The two germinal centre B (GCB) cell samples are
grouped with the FL cells and are far away from the
activated B cells, which confirms the hypotheses that
GCB represents a distinct stage of B cell differentiation,
and that the FL arises from this stage of B-cell differentiation [30]. The transformed cell line module also contains three DLBCL cells. A closer inspection showed
that two of the DLBCB samples in this module (OCILy1 and OCI-Ly3) are laboratory-cultivated cell lines
rather than samples from real patients (Figure 10),
which may be the reason that they are grouped with the
transferred cell lines. The Lymph node/tonsil cells are
grouped with DLBCL as in previous studies [30].
Interestingly, the majority of the DLBCB samples are
grouped into three modules (DLBCL-1, 2, and 3). It is
well known that not all DLBCL tumors are equal: 40%
of patients respond well to chemotherapy and have prolonged survival, while the others have a much shorter
survival time after treatment [30]. Previous studies have
suggested that DLBCL tumors can be categorized into
two subtypes: GCB-like DLBCL and activated B-like
DLBCL [30]. The GCB-like DLBCL shares gene signatures that distinguished germinal centre B cells from B
cells in other stages, while the activated B-like DLBCL
shared many gene signatures with normal lymph node
and tonsil. On average, GCB-like DLBCL patients have
a much higher survival rate than activated B-like
DLBCL patients after comparable chemotherapy [30]. In
our sample co-expression network, the GCB cells connect to DLBCL-1 cells while the tonsil and lymph node
cells fall in the DLBCL-2 modules, suggesting that the
two modules may correspond to the two well-known
DLBCL subtypes. Indeed, the median survival durations
for the patients in the DLBCL-1 and DLBCL-2 modules
are 71 and 22 months, respectively. Furthermore, 11 out
of 15 (73%) patients in the DLBCL-1 module lived more
than five years after treatment, while only 2 out of 13
(15%) patients in the DLBCL-2 module survived that
long. Even more interestingly, however, the DLBCL-3
module, which is apart from GCB and Tonsil/Lymph
nodes, has the lowest survival rate overall. The median
survival durations for this module is 12 months, and
only and 1 out of 10 (10%) patients in this module survived more than five years after treatment. The lack of
GCB-like or activated B-like signatures and the lower
survival rate seems to suggest DLBCL-3 to be a separate
subtype.

Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a general co-expression network-based approach for the analysis of high-throughput gene expression data. We introduced a simple rank-

Page 16 of 21

based method to construct gene or sample co-expression networks, and an algorithm called Qcut to identify
modules from the co-expression networks. We also
introduced a novel metric to evaluate the functional significance of gene modules based on reference networks.
On synthetic data, we showed that our method can
automatically discover the embedded modular structures
and that our method significantly outperformed a number of competing algorithms. We applied our method to
two real data sets, and showed that it can produce statistically more significant gene functional modules than
conventional clustering methods such as k-means and
self-organizing maps, evaluated by a number of criteria.
Furthermore, our test on a sample co-expression network showed excellent results in separating different
types or subtypes of tumor cells. All these were achieved
without knowing the number of modules in advance.
We reported several interesting biological results,
including some testable biological hypotheses. We
showed that the rank-based co-expression networks
have all the common topological properties that exist in
other biological networks, challenging the previous
results on the topology of gene co-expression networks.
We discovered an interesting gene module in yeast suggesting that some uncharacterized genes and transcriptional regulators may be involved in maintaining
telomere integrity. We also identified a module of
tumor cells which seems to correspond to a new subtype that has not been identified before.
Although we have only demonstrated our method on
gene expression data, it can be applied to other types of
experimental data as well. The rank-based network construction method can be used to capture the relationships among other entities. The efficiency of our
module detection method and its parameter-free feature
make it well suited for identifying intrinsic structures in
large-scale network data. Another advantage of our
method is its flexibility in integrating different types of
information. For example, co-expression networks and
transcriptional regulatory networks can be easily integrated; the modules in those integrated networks will
then represent co-expressed and co-regulated genes, as
well as their regulators. Similarly, we would expect
other types of information, such as protein-protein
interaction, phylogeny and phenotypes, to be integrated
to produce more biologically insightful results.

Methods
Network topological analysis

The topological properties of networks were analyzed
using MATLAB (the MathWorks Inc.). For each network the number of nodes and number of edges was
simply counted. A singleton is a node with zero connection. The average degree 〈k〉 was calculated as the

average number of connections per node. The clustering
coefficient of a network C was calculated as the average
clustering coefficient of all of its non-singleton nodes
using the formula: C i = 2n i /k i (k i - 1), where n i is the
number of observed links connecting the ki neighbors of
node i and ki (ki - 1)/2 is the total number of possible
links. The average path length (〈l〉) was calculated as the
average shortest path, or the smallest number of edges
needed to connect two nodes, between any two reachable nodes in the network. The diameter was defined as
the longest path length between any two reachable
nodes in the network. Node degree distributions were
plotted with the degree (k) on the x-axis and the number of nodes with this degree f(k) on the y-axis. Clustering coefficient against node degree C(k) distributions
were plotted with the degree (k) on the x-axis and the
average clustering coefficient 〈C〉 for all nodes with
degree k on the y-axis.
Module detection

Our module detection algorithm, Qcut, optimizes a
modularity function Q to automatically determine the
most appropriate number of modules in a network. The
algorithm can handle networks of several thousands of
nodes in a few minutes, much faster than most existing

algorithms, and at the same time can often achieve better quality. We have extensively tested the algorithm on
many synthetic networks and real-world networks with
known community structures, as well as several real
applications such as PPI networks and scientific collaboration networks. The results from these analyses show
that our method is very efficient and effective. The
detailed analysis and evaluation of the algorithm can be
found in [28]. Here we briefly describe the key ideas in
the algorithm.
The modularity function [51], Q, is defined as:
k

Q( k ) 

 (e

ii

 a i2 ),

(1)

i 1

where Γk is a clustering that partitions the nodes in a
graph into k groups, e ii is the fraction of edges with
both nodes within cluster i, and a i is the fraction of
edges with one or both nodes in cluster i. Intuitively,
the Q function measures the percentage of edges fully
contained within the clusters, subtracted by what one
would expect if the edges were randomly placed. The
value of Q is between -1 and 1; a larger Q value means
stronger modular structures. If a partition gives no more

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/8

Page 18 of 21

within-cluster edges than expected by chance, Q ≤ 0.
For a trivial partitioning with a single cluster, Q = 0. It
has been observed that most real-world networks have
Q > 0.3 [26]. The Q function can also be extended to
weighted networks straightforwardly by generalizing eii
and ai to edge weights, instead of number of edges.
Since the optimization of Q is NP-hard [52,53], we
developed a heuristic procedure to achieve this goal.
Given the adjacency matrix of a network G, we apply a
standard spectral clustering algorithm [45] to search for
the best 2-, 3, or 4-way partitioning that gives the highest Q value. This is recursively applied to partition each
subnetwork until the overall Q value of the network
does not increase. To further optimize Q, an efficient
greedy search procedure is then repeatedly applied to
look for the following possible operations: merging two
modules, moving a node from one module to a different
module, or further splitting a module. The procedure
terminates when no operations can improve Q.
Module evaluation
Comparing to known modular structures

To compare the modules identified by an algorithm to
the true modules, we computed the adjusted Rand
Index [40]. Given a set of objects S = s1, s2, ..., sn, let X
= {X1, X2, ..., XM } and Y = {Y1, Y2, ..., YN } represent the
true and predicted partitions of the objects, where each
object appears in X and Y exactly once. Let nij be the
number of common objects between Xi and Yj. Also let
ni• = ∑jnij = |Xi| be the size of Xi, and nj• = ∑i nij = |Yj|
be the size of Yj. The adjusted Rand Index can be computed by:

Statistical enrichment of GO terms and transcription factor
targets

To assess the functional significance of gene modules,
we first compute the enrichment of GO terms for the
genes within each module. The statistical significance of
GO term enrichment is measured by a cumulative
hypergeometric test [54]. The p-values are adjusted by
Bonferroni corrections for the multiple testing problem
[54]. The search of enriched GO terms is performed
with a computer program GO::TermFinder [55].
To compare different results with approximately the
same number of modules, we count the number of GO
terms enriched in the modules at a given significance
level. Furthermore, to rule out the possibility that a single module may contain a very large number of enriched
GO terms and therefore dominate the contribution from

other modules, we also compute the percentage of modules that have at least one enriched GO term at a given
significance level. It is worth noting that two sets of
results cannot be compared by this method if they differ
significantly in numbers of modules or modules size distributions, which may strongly affect the number of
enriched GO terms. The results of the comparison may
also depend on what p-value threshold is used.
The enrichment of transcription factor targets was
determined similarly as in computing the enrichment of
GO terms, and the binding data were from the largescale ChIP-chip assay of 203 yeast transcription factors
(TFs) under rich media conditions [56]. We only consider a binding as real if its p-value is less than 0.001,
according to the original authors [56].
Reference network-based module evaluation

We propose a novel method for assessing the functional
significance of gene modules. The basic idea is to introduce a functional reference network (discussed later),
and compare the gene modules in a co-expression network with the structures of the reference networks. In
such a reference network, genes are linked by edges that
represent certain functional relationships between them,
where the edges may be weighted according to the reliability or significance of the relationships. This network
can be expected to have some modular structures as
well. Since our purpose is to identify functional modules
within a co-expression network, we would prefer a good
partitioning of the gene co-expression network to represent a good partitioning of the reference network as
well; i.e., genes within the same co-expression module
should be connected by many high weight edges in the
reference network, while genes in different co-expression modules should share less functions or be connected with low weight edges in the reference network.
To quantify this, we force the reference network to be
partitioned exactly the same way as the co-expression
network, i.e., the group memberships of the nodes in
the reference network are the same as that of the coexpression network. We then score the gene modules by
the modularity of the reference network using Equation
(1). The modularity score is between -1 and 1, with one
meaning the co-expression network modules perfectly
agree with the modular structure of the reference network. Since this measure is not biased by the number of
modules or the module size distributions, it can be
applied to compare arbitrary clustering results.
A reference network can be obtained from a variety of
sources. First, available biological networks, such as PPI
networks and genetic interaction networks, can be used
as reference networks directly. A reference network can
also be derived from other attributes of genes. In general, two genes can be connected if they possess some
common attributes, given that the common attributes

Ruan et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/8

Page 19 of 21

are related to co-expression. For example, co-expressed
genes may participate in the same biological process or
be regulated by a common TF. These types of information can be represented by a matrix, where each row is
a gene, and each column is an attribute. To construct a
reference network from the matrix, genes are treated as
nodes, and an edge is drawn between two genes if they
share at least one common attribute. Edges are weighted
by some similarity measure of genes’ attributes. To measure the similarity, we use a well-known function in
machine learning that takes into account the significance of attributes [57]. For example, the Gene Ontology term GO:0009987 (cellular process), which is very
close to the root of the Gene Ontology graph and has a
large number of genes associated, is less informative and
should be weighted less than the term GO:0045911
(positive regulation of DNA recombination).
Denote a gene-attribute matrix by A = (aij), where aij
= 1 if gene i has attribute j, or 0 otherwise. A is transformed into a weighted matrix W = (wij), where wij = aij
× idfj. The weighting factor idfj, called the inverse document frequency (IDF) [57], is defined by idfj = log(n/∑i
aij), where n is the number of genes. With this transformation, the attributes that occur in many genes receive
low weights in W. The edge weight between two genes
is then measured by the cosine of their weighted attribute vectors:
S ij  cos(w i. , w j. ) 

 k w ik w jk
2
2
 k w ik  k w jk

,

(3)

where w i . and w j . are the i-th and j-th rows of W,
respectively. As expected, many genes may be connected
with very low weights if they share some non-specific
functions. We apply a weight cutoff to remove such
edges. We have found, however, that the result is almost
not affected by the use of different cutoff values, as
shown in Results and Discussion.
We use three types of reference networks to evaluate
clusters. The first is a network constructed from Gene
Ontology biological process terms [58], with each term
as an attribute. The ontology and annotation files for
yeast and Arabidopsis genes are downloaded from
http://www.geneontology.org/. To construct a reference
network, we first convert the original annotation files to
include complete annotations, i.e., if a gene is associated
with a certain term, we also add all ancestors of the
term into the gene’s attribute list due to term inheritance. If two terms are associated with exactly the same
set of genes, we remove one to avoid double counting.
We also remove GO terms that are associated with
more than 500 or less than 5 genes. The procedure
results in 1034 and 438 GO terms for yeast and

Arabidopsis, respectively. The second is a PPI network
for budding yeast, downloaded from the BioGRID database [59]. We combined all physical interactions
obtained from yeast two-hybrid or affinity purificationmass spectrometry experiments. The third network is a
co-regulation network derived from the ChIP-chip data
of 203 yeast transcription factors (TFs) under rich
media conditions [56]. We treat each TF as an attribute,
and construct a network with the procedure described
above. We only consider a binding as real if its p-value
is less than 0.001, according to the original authors [56].
