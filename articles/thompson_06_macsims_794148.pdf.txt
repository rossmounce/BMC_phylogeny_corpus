Abstract
Background: In the post-genomic era, systems-level studies are being performed that seek to
explain complex biological systems by integrating diverse resources from fields such as genomics,
proteomics or transcriptomics. New information management systems are now needed for the
collection, validation and analysis of the vast amount of heterogeneous data available. Multiple
alignments of complete sequences provide an ideal environment for the integration of this
information in the context of the protein family.
Results: MACSIMS is a multiple alignment-based information management program that combines
the advantages of both knowledge-based and ab initio sequence analysis methods. Structural and
functional information is retrieved automatically from the public databases. In the multiple
alignment, homologous regions are identified and the retrieved data is evaluated and propagated
from known to unknown sequences with these reliable regions. In a large-scale evaluation, the
specificity of the propagated sequence features is estimated to be >99%, i.e. very few false positive
predictions are made. MACSIMS is then used to characterise mutations in a test set of 100 proteins
that are known to be involved in human genetic diseases. The number of sequence features
associated with these proteins was increased by 60%, compared to the features available in the
public databases. An XML format output file allows automatic parsing of the MACSIM results, while
a graphical display using the JalView program allows manual analysis.
Conclusion: MACSIMS is a new information management system that incorporates detailed
analyses of protein families at the structural, functional and evolutionary levels. MACSIMS thus
provides a unique environment that facilitates knowledge extraction and the presentation of the
most pertinent information to the biologist. A web server and the source code are available at
http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/MACSIMS/.

Background
Systems biology is an emerging discipline whose goal is to
integrate different levels of information in order to gain a
deeper understanding of how biological systems function
[1]. By studying the various parts of a biological system
(e.g., gene and protein networks, metabolic pathways,
organelles, cells or organisms) and the relationships and
interactions between them, it is hoped that eventually an
understandable model of the whole system can be developed. Such systems-level studies have been made possible
thanks to the new information resources that are being
created from the raw data produced by different high
throughput technologies in fields such as transcriptomics,
proteomics, or interactomics. Effective analyses in systems
biology require the computational power to analyze these
comprehensive and massive datasets, and the capacity to
integrate heterogeneous data into a usable knowledge format [2]. To address this problem, information management systems are now being developed in a number of
areas for the integration of biological data resources with
analytical tools using computational, bioinformatic and
mathematical methods and the presentation of the results
in an intuitive, user-friendly format for the biologist. For
example, MARS (microarray analysis, retrieval, and storage system) [3] provides a comprehensive suite for storing, retrieving, and analyzing microarray data. MOLE
(mining, organizing, and logging experiments) [4] has
been developed to help protein scientists manage the
large amounts of laboratory data being generated due to
the acceleration in proteome research. GIMS (Genome
Information Management System) [5] is an object database that integrates genomic data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae with data on the transcriptome, protein-protein
interactions, metabolic pathways and annotations, such
as gene ontology terms and identifiers. GeneNotes [6]
allows users to collect and manage diverse biological
information about genes/ESTs. AutoFACT [7] combines
information from various databases and assigns functional definitions to gene sequences.
In the context of the new systems-level biology, more
detailed analyses are now needed that describe gene function at different levels, such as specific residue interactions, the biochemical function, the role of the gene
product in complexes and pathways and the implications
for the development and activities of the organism. To
achieve this, such diverse information as 3D structures,
protein interactions and modifications, or mutations and
their associated phenotypes must be assembled, classified
and made available to the biologist. Multiple alignments
of molecular sequences represent an ideal basis for the
reliable integration of all this information [8]. By placing
the sequence in the framework of the overall family and
by analysing the variation/conservation at different positions, multiple alignments can be used to identify impor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/318

tant structural or functional motifs that have been
conserved through evolution, and to highlight particular
non-conserved features resulting from specific events or
perturbations. For example, in protein secondary structure
prediction, the use of aligned sequences allows better
application of the propensities of particular residues for
particular secondary structures and improved identification of patterns of hydrophobicity [9]. Furthermore, the
reliability of numerous ab initio predictions has been
improved by calculation of a consensus prediction over all
the sequences in a multiple alignment, e.g. for the characterization of membrane proteins [10], sub-cellular localization [11] or post-transcriptional modifications [12].
Recent advances in multiple sequence alignment methods
[e.g. [13-16]] have led to significant improvements in
alignment efficiency and accuracy, and it is now possible
to construct rapid, reliable alignments of large sets of
complete sequences. These new multiple alignments provide the basis for most state-of-the-art systems for protein
characterization [e.g. [17-22]]. Thanks to the increasing
adoption of common data standards and exchange formats, a number of systems have also been described
recently that allow the integration and visualization of
other information in the context of a family of proteins
e.g. Pfaat [23], the Bio-dictionary [24], MyHits [25]or
SRS3D [26].
We have developed MACSIMS, a new multiple alignmentbased information management system that combines
knowledge-based methods with complementary ab initio
sequence based predictions for protein family analysis.
MACSIMS takes advantage of the recently developed Multiple Alignment Ontology (MAO) [27], to integrate different types of data in the framework of the multiple
alignment. A wide range of information, from taxonomic
data and functional descriptions to individual sequence
features, such as structural domains and active site residues, is mined from the public databases using the SRS
Sequence Retrieval System [28]. A number of new algorithms have been developed for reliable data validation,
consensus predictions and rational propagation of information from the known to the unknown sequences. The
goal of the present paper is to demonstrate the accuracy
and reliability of these algorithms, and to introduce some
potential applications of this powerful information management system.
The information collected from the public databases contains not only high quality, experimentally validated data,
but also less reliable data from high-throughput experimental technologies and computational predictions. In
MACSIMS, the mined data is first validated by comparing
the information retrieved for each sequence. At the same
time, any local alignment errors are detected and the well-

aligned homologous regions in the alignment are identified using the LEON algorithm [29]. The consistent information is then propagated from the known to the
unknown proteins only within these safe regions. MACSIMS thus provides a reliable environment for a rational
transfer of information, which is robust to errors in the
input data and to alignment errors. The reliability of the
MACSIMS data management system is demonstrated
using a large-scale test set of 83 automatic alignments
based on the BAliBASE [30] benchmark database. For
each of the alignments, a number of sequence features
predicted by MACSIMS, such as domains or active site
motifs, were compared to the known sequence features
retrieved from the public databases. The specificity in
these tests was shown to be above 99%, and the sensitivity
was 91%. Two applications of MACSIMS are demonstrated. The first example addresses the problem of target
identification in a high-throughput structural proteomics
project, while the second example concerns the structural
and functional characterisation of mutations known to be
involved in human genetic diseases.
The total information content of the MACSIMS, including
the mined data and the MACSIMS propagated or predicted information, is stored in an XML format file that is
suitable for automatic, high-throughput projects. The
source of all the information is also recorded in the XML
file, so that an expert user can trace the origins of the new
data. A web server is available for visual analyses, incorporating

http://
www.jalview.org/[31,32]. JalView is a platform-independent program that is capable of displaying and editing large
sequence sets, and allows multiple integrated views of the
alignment and associated sequence features. This graphical presentation provides a valuable workbench for

Construction of the test set
A test set of multiple alignments was constructed based on
the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database [30]. BaliBASE is designed for the evaluation and comparison of
multiple sequence alignment algorithms and provides a
large number of high quality, manually refined, reference
alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. For
each of the 83 multiple alignments in the reference set 1,
a single PDB [27] sequence was selected from the
sequences in the alignment, and the corresponding fulllength sequence was extracted from the Swiss-Prot database [34]. All the sequences in a BAliBASE reference alignment share the same structural fold, so we selected the
first sequence in the alignment as a representative
sequence. For each of these initial query sequences, a
BlastP search [35] was performed in the Uniprot and PDB
databases. Next, a subset of sequences was selected from
the sequences detected by BlastP with an Expect<10. The
sample subset contained all the PDB sequences detected,
together with a set of representative Uniprot sequences,
built by dividing the sequences into 40 subgroups
depending on the log of the BlastP expect values, and
selecting one sequence from each subgroup. Sequences
from the Swiss-Prot database were preferred because they
are generally more extensively annotated than the SpTrembl sequences. Finally, the sequence subsets were
aligned using the PipeAlign system [8]. The result is a test
set of 83 automatically-constructed multiple alignments,
containing a total of 10250 full-length sequences from the
public sequence and structure databases. The distribution
of the number of sequences per alignment is shown in Figure 1.
Algorithm overview
The algorithm incorporated in MACSIMS is composed of
a number of integrated processes: (i) data retrieval and ab
initio predictions, (ii) identification of homologous
regions, (iii) data validation and propagation and (iv)
data storage and presentation. The processing pipeline is
outlined in Figure 2 and is described in detail below.
Data retrieval and ab initio prediction
For each sequence in the multiple alignment, data is
mined from the public sequence databases, using the SRS
Sequence Retrieval System [28]. In order to retrieve information efficiently, a customized SRS database containing
all the sequences in the alignment is created on-the-fly
and this custom database is then indexed to the public
database. If the sequence name in the alignment corresponds to a valid Uniprot [34] accession number, various
sequence entry fields are retrieved first from Uniprot,

bases, together with the propagated and predicted information is stored in an XML format output file, based on
the MAO multiple alignment ontology. The DTD for the
MACSIMS XML format is available at http://www-bio3digbmc.u-strasbg.fr/macsim.dtd.
Identification of homologous regions
The reliable 'core blocks' in the multiple alignment are
identified using the RASCAL algorithm [42], which combines a number of complementary sequence analysis
algorithms in order to identify conserved, well aligned
sequence segments. Briefly, the multiple alignment is first
divided into sub-families using the Secator [43] sequence
clustering program. Conserved blocks for each sub-family
are then determined using the mean distance (MD) column scores implemented in the NorMD alignment objective function [44]. These subfamily core blocks are
represented by profiles and are compared to each other in
a pairwise fashion to identify sequence segments conserved between sub-families. Taking advantage of the
transitive nature of homologous relationships, information from intermediate sequences is used to help define
the conserved core blocks for more divergent sequences.
Finally core blocks are chained into regions using the
method developed in LEON [29]. These regions are characterized by their phylogenetic distribution, defined as the
most specific taxon that is common to all sequences in the
region.

including the organism name and NCBI TAXID, the function definition, GO definitions and the EC number, and
the sequence feature table containing details of known
domains, secondary structure elements (SSEs), functional
or modified sites, etc. Pfam [36] domains and Prosite [37]
patterns associated with each sequence are also retrieved
via the InterPro database [38], although Prosite entries
with a 'false' status are ignored. If the sequence name corresponds to a PDB [33] accession number, the function
definition and the organism are retrieved from the TITLE
and SOURCE fields respectively. The SSEs are also
retrieved from the HELIX and SHEET fields. If the
sequence name does not correspond to a valid database
accession number, the sequence is kept in the alignment,
although no data is mined. A number of different prediction programs are then run for each sequence: (i) the SEG
algorithm [39] is used to identify low complexity segments, (ii) the GES hydrophobicity property [40] is used
to predict potential transmembrane helices, (iii) coiled
coil segments are predicted using the NCOILS program
[41]. The information extracted from the sequence data-

Data validation and propagation
The purpose of this step is to reliably transfer information
from annotated sequences to unknown ones. However, in
order to avoid propagating false information, the data has
to be pre-processed to validate the data mined in step 1.

The mined data is first classified into a number of different sequence feature types, e.g. domain, SSE, active site or
modified residue. (The full list of feature types is available
on the MACSIMS web server help pages). A sequence feature is defined by its type, its start and end position within
the sequence and an annotation text or 'name' that further
characterises the feature. For example, the HMG_box
domain of SSRP1_MOUSE [Swiss-Prot:Q08943] is
defined as type = PFAM, start_residue = 547, end_residue
= 615, name = 'PF00505 HMG_box'. We then use a series
of decision rules to identify inaccurate or uncertain
sequence features, as shown in Figure 3. Data from a 'reliable' source, such as Uniprot or PDB SSEs or PFAM
domains is automatically assumed to be correct. Data
from resources containing predicted information is validated only if it is located within a core block region and it
is in agreement with the majority of the sequence features
of this type (i.e. the sequence feature that has the maximal
occurrence at this position in the alignment is assumed to
be the correct one). Unique predictions within a core

criteria as shown in Figure 4 and Table 1. Thus, a feature
is propagated from an annotated sequence to an
unknown target sequence, if the following conditions are
met. (i) For single residue sites, the site must be located
within a core block that is present in both the annotated
and the target sequence. Also, the residue in the annotated
sequence corresponding to the site and the aligned residue in the target sequence must be identical. (ii) For SSEs,
at least 70% of the element must be covered by core
blocks shared by the annotated and the target sequence.
(iii) For domains, at least 40% of the domain must be covered by core blocks shared by the annotated and the target
sequence. The threshold values used for these conditions
were determined by manual inspection of the MACSIMS
results using the original BAliBASE reference alignments.
The values were chosen to maximize the specificity of the
MACSIMS propagation i.e. a cutoff was selected that
removed all false positive predictions in this initial training set. Sequence features that do not satisfy these conditions are stored and presented to the user, but are not
propagated to any other sequences.

included in the propagation step described below.
Once the unreliable features have been identified, the
remaining features are propagated between the sequences
in the alignment, depending on a number of pre-defined

Data storage and presentation
The final output after the propagation step is an XML format file containing the complete MACSIMS knowledge
base. The sequence features that are generated by MACSIMS are annotated as either Predicted or Propagated features. In the case of propagated features, the source
sequence name is included in the annotation. The XML
format provides an appropriate format for automatic parsing of the results that facilitates integration in highthroughput systems. The XML format also provides the
possibility to include a reliability score for each sequence

of MACSIMS in order to allow expert users to further validate borderline features using other tools. Files are also
generated for input to the JalView applet (see Figure 2).
JalView is a Java application for editing and viewing
sequence alignments. It has facilities for assessing alignment quality, visualizing residue property conservation,
and constructing and viewing sequence clusters through
tree and principal components based algorithms.

Results
MACSIMS is a new information management system that
combines data from a number of different resources with
computational methods for data validation and analysis.
The structural and functional information retrieved from
various public databases is first validated in the context of
the MACS. The validated information is then used to characterise the unknown proteins. Thus, MACSIMS provides
detailed annotations ranging from the location of active
sites and the definition of structural or functional
domains to the description of the protein function at the
molecular or cellular levels. In an initial large-scale test; a
set of well characterised proteins is used to evaluate the
specificity and sensitivity of MACSIMS. Then, in a second
test, MACSIMS is used to structurally and functionally
characterise mutations known to be involved in human
genetic diseases. The results of the analyses are represented in a format designed specifically for high-throughput computational processing. The results can also be
examined manually by the biologist using a user-friendly,
web-based interface.
Benchmarking with a large test set of well characterised
protein families
In order to evaluate the quality of the data management
algorithms incorporated in MACSIMS, we used a largescale test set based on the BAliBASE benchmark alignment
database. Version 3 of BAliBASE contains representative
test cases that cover most of the protein fold space,
divided into 5 reference sets representing many of the
problems encountered when aligning real families of proteins. The protein families in BAliBASE are well characterised and the known information can be used to validate
the predictions made by MACSIMS. However, the reference alignments in this database are based on 3D structure superpositions and have been manually refined to
correct any misalignments. In order to provide realistic
test cases for MACSIMS, we therefore selected an initial set
of 83 query sequences that were used to construct automatic multiple alignments containing full-length
sequences (see Methods). These test alignments are thus
representative of typical results that would be obtained in
an automatic protein annotation pipeline. Information
was collected from the public databases for all sequences
in each alignment. The 83 alignments contained a total of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/318

10250 sequences, with 8045 PDB sequences and 2205
Uniprot sequences. After the data retrieval step, the MACSIMS alignments contained 9799 functional definitions
and 4069 GO (Gene Ontology) crossreferences. Taxonomic data included 8714 organism names and 17322
taxon entries. A total of 150772 sequence features were
retrieved from the databases, including 8020 Interpro
entries and 121858 secondary structure elements (SSEs).
The consensus prediction algorithms contributed a further 2535 predicted features (903 low complexity segments, 937 transmembrane helices, 695 coiled coils).
During the data validation process, 84 of the mined features were identified as potential errors and were excluded
from the propagation step. An additional 261791
sequence features were generated by propagation of the
validated features. The ab initio prediction algorithms used
in MACSIMS are standard methods that have been
described elsewhere. Therefore, the results we present here
concern only the feature validation and propagation
steps.
The sensitivity and specificity of this process were measured in a test designed to illustrate the behavior of MACSIMS for different kinds of sequence features, i.e Pfam
domains, Prosite motifs, SSEs and functional sites from
the Uniprot feature table. The protocol used in the test is
as follows:
1. For all 83 test alignments, the feature retrieval and validation steps were repeated as described above, resulting
in 150772 sequence features.
2. The retrieved sequence features were removed from the
query sequence and any other sequences sharing >90%
residue identity with the query. A total of 15697 features
were removed, of which 2283 belonged to the query
sequence. This leaves a total of 135075 sequence features
in the remaining sequences (sharing <90% identity with
the query) in the alignment.
3. Finally, the propagation step was performed as before.
The features propagated by MACSIMS to the query
sequences were then evaluated by comparison to the 2283
excluded query features. A propagated feature that overlapped an excluded feature with the same name was considered as a true positive (TP), while a propagated feature
that overlapped an excluded feature with a different name
was considered as a false positive (FP). Only one FP feature was observed: for the sequence [Swiss-Prot:P01843]
(corresponding to [PDB:1JNH_A]), the Uniprot feature
table indicates a strand at position 9–29, whereas MACSIMS has propagated a strand-helix-strand configuration
in this segment. The MACSIMS propagation is in fact in
agreement with the annotation of 1JNH_A in the PDB

Percent identity indicates the maximum similarity of the sequences in the alignment with the query. 'Query features' is the number of sequence
features for the query available in the public databases. 'Homolog features' is the number of features found in the other sequences in the alignment
that correspond to a feature in the query. True (or false) positives indicate the number of features propagated by MACSIMS that match (or
mismatch) with known query features. 'New features' is the number of features predicted by MACSIMS that are not currently found in the public
databases.

database, indicating a potential error in the Uniprot feature table entry. The specificity (FP rate) is difficult to estimate accurately as the total number of true features for the
query sequences is unknown. The public databases contained 2283 features related to the query sequences, but
this does not necessarily represent the complete set of possible features. If we consider only the propagated features
that contradict known information, only one FP was
detected as described above and the specificity is estimated to be over 99%. MACSIMS correctly predicted 76%
of the 2283 original query sequence features. Two main
reasons for this relatively low sensitivity (TP rate) were
identified. First, some of the excluded features did not
exist in any of the homologous sequences in the multiple
alignment. Second, local alignment errors occurred that
resulted in misaligned sequence features. As no core
blocks were defined for these segments, the sequence features could not be propagated. If these sequence features
are omitted from the analysis, the sensitivity of MACSIMS
for the propagation of correctly aligned sequence features
is 91%.
The same protocol was repeated in another test, where the
same features were removed from sequences sharing more
than 50% identity with the query. Even for this difficult
test case, in which only distantly related sequences are
used in the feature propagation step, the specificity of
MACSIMS remains >99% with only one propagated feature in disagreement with the known annotations. The
sensitivity of MACSIMS is only slightly lower, with 86% of
the features correctly aligned in the multiple alignment
being successfully propagated. Details for the different
kinds of features are shown in Table 2. For each type, the
number of known features associated with the query
sequences is indicated. The complete set of features

retrieved for the other sequences in the alignment is used
as a basis for propagation. The number of features in this
complete set that correspond to known query features is
indicated in the table as 'homolog features'. For example,
the 83 queries contained 360 known functional sites in
the UniProt database, but only 305 of these features was
also found in one of the other sequences in the alignment.
The known features are then compared to the features
propagated by MACSIMS and the number of true positives
and false positives are calculated. For the Pfam domains
and the Prosite motifs which are available for all the
sequences in the Uniprot database, most of the known
query features are successfully recovered by MACSIMS. In
contrast, the propagation of SSEs and Uniprot functional
sites, which are available only for experimentally validated sequences, is less effective.
In these tests, MACSIMS predicted a total of 1060 new features for the query sequences that did not overlap any of
the excluded features. Some of these propagations were
verified manually by reference to text annotations or literature references. For example, the active site of the query
protein THIO2_ANASP [Swiss-Prot:P20857] was propagated from sequence P80028, which shares 24% residue
identity. The site has been described as essential for the
catalysis of redox reactions [45]. As a second example, for
the query sequence LDH1_PLAFD [Swiss-Prot:Q27743],
the L-lactate dehydrogenase active site (PS00064) was
identified as a new feature. This site is described as a
known false negative in the Prosite database. The MACSIMS alignments for all the tests are available for viewing
on the web at http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/MACSIMS/

Large scale application of MACSIMS
MACSIMS has been integrated in a high-throughput structural proteomics project (SPINE), where it was used for
target selection and characterization [46]. It is also being
used in the MS2PH (Structural Mutation to Human
Pathologies Phenotype) project, in order to analyse proteins involved in human genetic diseases and to identify
mutations that cause structural or functional perturbations. This application illustrates the data integration
potential of MACSIMS by characterizing mutations in
terms of their evolutionary conservation, their position in
the 3D structure, and their role in functional sites. For an
initial test set of 100 proteins with well characterized
mutations, a BlastP search was performed in the Uniprot
and PDB databases and a MACS was constructed of the
100 top scoring sequences using the PipeAlign system. For
the 100 query proteins, a total of 2377 sequence features
were mined directly from the public databases. MACSIMS
propagated an additional 1424 features from homologous sequences in the MACS, representing a 60% increase
in the number of features identified. A further 300 features, including low complexity segments, coiled coil segment and transmembrane helices were predicted by ab
initio methods. The initial data set of 100 proteins and the
MACSIMS alignments for all these tests are available for
viewing on the web at http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/MACSIMS/
MS2PH_tests/.

An example MS2PH alignment of the sulfatase protein
family is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5A shows a schematic
overview of the complete alignment produced by JalView,
in which the regions calculated by MACSIMS are coloured
according to their phylogenetic distribution. The metazoa-specific region identified in the alignment corresponds to a 7 kDa chain (component C) of the
arylsulfatase A precursor, which is linked to component B
by disulfide bonds. The positions of known point mutations in three human sequences are also indicated: arylNsulfatase
E
precursor
[Swiss-Prot:P51690],
acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase precursor (P34059) and
arylsulfatase A precursor [Swiss-Prot:P15289]. Figure 5B
shows a detailed view of the alignment of the N-terminal
metal-binding domain, highlighting the mutations in this
zone and the relative positions of the predicted Prosite
motifs. The two motifs, sulfatase 1 and 2 are consistently
predicted in a number of different sequences and are
propagated to the unannotated sequences in the alignment. However, the ADH short motif is not propagated by
MACSIMS because it is only present in one sequence and
may correspond to a false positive prediction in the
Prosite database. Figure 5C corresponds to the same alignment zone, showing the position of the mutations in relation to SSEs and important functional sites. For example,
the C79Y mutation in the GALNS gene (alignment column 622), which occurs at the catalytic site, leads to seri-

ous damage in GALNS activity and a severe phenotype
[47].

Discussion
MACSIMS can be used to integrate information from different domains, such as genetics, structural biology, proteomics or interactomics experiments, in the context of a
multiple alignment of a protein family. Input alignments
can be obtained by any of the new automatic programs,
such as PipeAlign [14], MAFFT [13], MUSCLE [15] or
ProbCons [16], or manually constructed. For those
sequences in the alignment with Swissprot or TrEMBL
accession numbers, information is automatically mined
from public databases. The major advantage of MACSIMS
is that the mined information can be cross-validated
within the alignment, in order to differentiate between
reliable, consistent information and spurious predictions.
The validated data then provides the basis for the accurate
propagation of information from known to unknown
sequences.
An important factor in the design of MACSIMS was its
potential application in automatic, high-throughput systems. It was therefore crucial that the data propagation
system should be reliable and should clearly identify the
source of all inferences. The data collected by MACSIMS
will inevitably contain a number of errors, either from
high throughput experimental techniques or from computational prediction methods. These errors in the input
data can be handled in two different ways, either by leaving the noisy instances in and using a robust algorithm
that is not biased by the noise, or by filtering the data
before use. In the second approach, instances that are suspected of being noisy according to certain evaluation criteria are discarded. We chose the second approach
because our datasets are generally not large enough to permit robust statistical inferences. A non-parametric decision tree was implemented that identifies and removes
suspicious predictions, resulting in a smaller but cleaner
data set for propagation.
Another important issue is the level of similarity required
in order to transfer information between different proteins. The automatic annotation of proteins based on the
transfer of function descriptions from the most closely
related homolog has lead to a number of errors in highthroughput genome annotation projects. Some common
causes of questionable predictions are: i) non-critical use
of annotations from existing database entries; ii) taking
into account only the annotation of the closest homolog;
iii) insufficient masking of low complexity segments in
protein sequences, resulting in spurious database hits iv)
ignoring multi-domain organization of the query or target
proteins [48]. In MACSIMS, we have addressed this problem by applying a recently developed method to identify

the well-aligned, homologous regions in the alignment.
Information is then propagated only within these safe
regions. As a corollary, the sensitivity of the MACSIMS
propagation algorithm will depend on the quality of the
input alignment. If core blocks are not identified due to
errors in the alignment, no propagation can occur.
Although significant progress has been made recently in
the quality of automatic multiple alignments, errors do
still occur when aligning large sets of complex proteins.
Nevertheless, in the large scale tests using automatically
constructed alignments, we have shown that the sequence
annotations are significantly increased compared to the
available database information, leading to a more complete knowledge base for subsequent analyses. Even in the
extreme case of protein families with no known homologs
in the public annotated databases, MACSIMS can provide
useful information, such as the clustering of the sequences
into sub-families and the identification of conserved
regions within sub-families or in the full alignment. Also,
the predictions of transmembrane regions, coiled coil segments and low complexity regions may give some clues as
to the potential role of the protein family.
The SRS system is currently used in the data retrieval step
as it provides a single interface for most general biological
databases, and allows a fast access because of on-the-fly
database for sequences in alignment. Information is
retrieved from the Uniprot sequence and PDB 3D structure databases. Uniprot provides links to domain information, including the Interpro database of protein
families, domains and functional sites, as well as to experimental information related to structure, function, mutations and disease. In the future, other data resources will
be incorporated, such as the NCBI sequence resources and
the interaction and mutation databases. An alternative
data retrieval system will be implemented that will
include a remote access facility to these new resources.
Another abundant data source that could be exploited is
the scientific literature, thanks to the development of new
methods and tools for literature-mining [49].
The MACSIMS system is currently available as an interactive web server. A web service using the SOAP http://
www.w3.org/TR/soap/ protocol is planned for the near
future. All the information collected or generated by
MACSIMS is stored in XML format files that provide a
structured format for automatic data parsing by computers. However, all the information is also easily accessible
for manual analysis by biologists, via new enhancements
to the JalView editor. JalView provides a simple-to-use,
graphical interface suitable for non expert users that offers
an interactive environment for in-depth protein family
analysis.

Conclusion
MACSIMS is a new system for the management of all the
information related to a protein family. Structural and
functional information is automatically retrieved from
the public databases. The advantage of MACSIMS is that
the raw data can be validated in the context of the multiple alignment and information can be propagated from
known to unknown proteins. MACSIMS thus provides a
unique environment that facilitates knowledge extraction
and the presentation of the most pertinent information to
the biologist.
Work is now in progress to incorporate MACSIMS in the
PipeAlign protein family analysis WWW server. The new
version of this server will allow automatic processing of
proteins, from database searches for homologous
sequences and construction of a high-quality, validated
MACS to information and management using MACSIMS.
MACSIMS will also be integrated in a new system, Ordalie
(Ordered Alignment Information Explorer) that will
allow detailed residue conservation analysis at the complete family or the sub-family level, in order to characterize sub-family specific residues and differentially
conserved motifs. We are also investigating the application of recent developments in ontology-based methods
for reasoning and inference that will facilitate intelligent
knowledge extraction and decision support for structural,
functional or evolutionary analyses.

Availability and requirements
MACSIMS consists of a suite of programs, all written in
ANSI C. The programs were installed and tested on a DEC
Alpha 6100 computer running OSF Unix. MACSIMS uses
the SRS system (version 7.1.3.2) and the Uniprot, PDB
and Interpro databases, which are updated weekly. A Web
server is available at http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/MACSIMS
that runs the complete suite of programs for a given multiple alignment. A UNIX shell script is also provided for
users wishing to run the system locally. In this case, the
SRS system must be installed for data retrieval. SRS runs
on Unix/Linux systems and requires at least 100 Mb of
RAM plus enough disk space to hold the databases. The
Secator program http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/
~wicker/programs.html is also needed for sequence clustering and the NCOILS program http://www.russell.emblheidelberg.de/coils/coils.tar.gz is required for the prediction of coiled coil segments. MACSIMS takes multiple
alignments in any of the most widely used formats,
including MSF, FASTA or ClustalW formats as input. For
successful data retrieval, the sequence names should correspond to Uniprot accession numbers and the sequences
should be full length. MACSIMS outputs an alignment in
XML format, that can also be converted into the input format required by the JalView program.
