Abstract
Background: Unigene sequences constitute a rich source of functionally relevant microsatellites. The present study
was undertaken to mine the microsatellites in the available unigene sequences of sugarcane for understanding
their constitution in the expressed genic component of its complex polyploid/aneuploid genome, assessing their
functional significance in silico, determining the extent of allelic diversity at the microsatellite loci and for
evaluating their utility in large-scale genotyping applications in sugarcane.
Results: The average frequency of perfect microsatellite was 1/10.9 kb, while it was 1/44.3 kb for the long and
hypervariable class I repeats. GC-rich trinucleotides coding for alanine and the GA-rich dinucleotides were the most
abundant microsatellite classes. Out of 15,594 unigenes mined in the study, 767 contained microsatellite repeats
and for 672 of these putative functions were determined in silico. The microsatellite repeats were found in the
functional domains of proteins encoded by 364 unigenes. Its significance was assessed by establishing the
structure-function relationship for the beta-amylase and protein kinase encoding unigenes having repeats in the
catalytic domains. A total of 726 allelic variants (7.42 alleles per locus) with different repeat lengths were captured
precisely for a set of 47 fluorescent dye labeled primers in 36 sugarcane genotypes and five cereal species using
the automated fragment analysis system, which suggested the utility of designed primers for rapid, large-scale and
high-throughput genotyping applications in sugarcane. Pair-wise similarity ranging from 0.33 to 0.84 with an
average of 0.40 revealed a broad genetic base of the Indian varieties in respect of functionally relevant regions of
the large and complex sugarcane genome.
Conclusion: Microsatellite repeats were present in 4.92% of sugarcane unigenes, for most (87.6%) of which
functions were determined in silico. High level of allelic diversity in repeats including those present in the
functional domains of proteins encoded by the unigenes demonstrated their use in assay of useful variation in the
genic component of complex polyploid sugarcane genome.

Background
Sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) is a complex polyploid
belonging to the family Poaceae of the tribe Andropogoneae. It is an important commercial sugar producing
crop and a source of approximately 50% of the world’s
sugar and alcohol. The polyploid/aneuploid nature with
variation in chromosome number has been largely
responsible for its genetic and taxonomic complexity
[1]. Characterization of such large genomes is
greatly facilitated by the use of molecular markers.

Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers
are being preferred because of their co-dominant inheritance, reproducibility, multi-allelic nature, chromosomespecific location and wide genomic distribution. These
markers are amenable to high throughput genotyping
due to multiplexing and efficient resolution of amplicons by automated fragment analysis [2,3].
In sugarcane, Cordeiro et al. (2000) [2] and Parida
et al. (2009a) [4] developed a large number of microsatellite markers from the genomic sequences. Pinto et al.
(2004; 2006) [5,6] and more recently Oliveira et al.
(2009) [7] also designed such markers from the sugarcane ESTs, which were used for constructing high resolution functional genetic linkage map of Saccharum

spp. [8]. However, information on a limited number of
these genic microsatellite markers is available in the
public domain. Recently, the EST sequences have been
assembled into unigenes [9], which is expected to provide non-redundant, locus specific and novel gene-based
functional markers for sugarcane having a large genome
not amenable to complete sequencing. The unigene
sequences of sugarcane have not yet been analyzed for
their microsatellite constitution and compared with the
other small genome members of the grass family.
In India, systematic breeding of sugarcane has resulted
in the development of a number of varieties with high
productivity and stress tolerance by inter-specific hybridization [10]. However, the genetic base of modern
Indian sugarcane cultivars is considered narrow due to
use of a limited number of parental species clones in
cross hybridization and repeated intercrossing of hybrids
[11]. Understanding the extent of natural variation at
molecular level is essential to develop new strategies for
sugarcane improvement. Earlier, molecular markers
such as RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic
DNA), AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism), and maize and sugarcane genomic microsatellites
have been used for this purpose [4,12-15]. No effort has
yet been made to understand the genetic diversity of
Indian sugarcane cultivars based on functionally relevant
genic regions of its complex genome.
The present study was undertaken to mine the available unigene sequences of sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) to
understand the microsatellite structure and distribution
in the expressed genic component of the genome, assess
their functional significance in silico, design primers
from the flanking regions of the identified microsatellites, assess the efficiency of a set of fluorescent dye
labeled primers in genotyping using automated fragment
analysis system and determine functional diversity
among different species, related genera and Indian varieties of sugarcane.

Results
Frequency, distribution and organization of
microsatellites in sugarcane unigenes

The type, frequency and relative distribution of the
microsatellites in the unigene sequences of sugarcane
are given in Table 1. The perfect microsatellite (excluding the mononucleotides) frequency in the unigenes of
sugarcane was one in every 10.9 kb and the proportion
of microsatellite carrying unigenes was 3.7% (584 out of
15,582). When 1,871 (12%) mononucleotide microsatellites were included, the proportion of unigenes carrying
microsatellites increased to 17.4%. The mononucleotides
in sugarcane showed a strong bias (84.6%) towards A/T
repeat, with the majority (89%) being 9 to 30 bases long
and the remaining (11%) extending up to 69 bases (T69).

A total of 841 perfect microsatellites were identified in
584 unigene sequences of sugarcane. One hundred
sixty-seven (28.6%) of these unigenes contained multiple
microsatellites (that accounted for 424 microsatellites)
which were interrupted by more than 100 nucleotides
and the remaining 417 (71.4%) unigenes had a single
microsatellite each. In addition to the perfect microsatellites, we identified 183 compound microsatellites, of
which 74.9% were interrupting types and the rest being
non-interrupting types (Table 1). The trinucleotide
repeat motifs were the most prevalent (73.1%) class of
microsatellites followed by dinucleotide (23.8%), tetranucleotide (1.8%), pentanucleotide (0.83%) and hexanucleotide (0.47%) repeat motifs (Table 1). The GC rich repeat
motifs GCA/GCC/GCG/GCT (23%) coding for alanine
were most abundant followed by arginine (AGA/AGG/
CGA/CGC/CGG/CGT, 22%) and glycine (GGA/GGC/
GGT, 11%) (see Additional file 1). Among the dinucleotide repeats, the most and least frequent motifs were
GA and CG, which accounted for 21% and 1.4% of all
the microsatellites, respectively (see Additional file 2).
Out of 841 perfect microsatellites identified in sugarcane, 587 (69.8%) were found in the ORFs and the
remaining were present either in the 3’UTRs (102,
12.1%) or in the 5’UTRs (152, 18.1%). The trinucleotide
repeat motifs were significantly more frequent (about
86%) in the ORFs. In contrast, the GA-rich dinucleotide
repeat motifs were more in the 5’ (49%) and 3’ (32%)
UTRs. The density of longer motif containing perfect
class I microsatellites was one in every 44.3 kb
sequences, which accounted for 24.6% (207) of the total
841 microsatellites identified (Table 1, Figure 1).
Development of unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS)
markers and evaluation of their polymorphic potential

The primer pairs could be designed for 810 perfect
microsatellites that was 96.3% of the total microsatellites
(841) identified in the present investigation. The primer
sequences flanking all the perfect UGMS including 207
class I microsatellites with their Tm values and product
sizes are given in the Additional file 3. Besides, the primer sequences for 151 compound class I UGMS were
designed and provided in the Additional file 4. To validate the UGMS markers, 176 primer-pairs designed
from different microsatellite containing unigenes were
used in PCR amplification (see Additional file 3). One
hundred sixty seven (94.9%) of these produced clear and
reproducible amplicons, whereas remaining nine (5.1%)
did not give amplification in the S. officinarum from
which sequence the primers were designed. To verify
that the primers did amplify the expected microsatellite
repeat-motifs, the amplified products obtained with 19
of the primers in all the Saccharum species and related
genera as well as cereals were sequenced and the

presence of the target microsatellite motifs as well the
flanking sequences was observed in all the cases (see
Additional file 5).
In silico polymorphism analysis was confined to
Saccharum officinarum and five cereal species namely,
rice, wheat, maize, Sorghum and barley for which unigene sequences were available in the database. The polymorphism based on variation in microsatellite repeat
length was observed for a maximum of 163 primers
(46.6%) between sugarcane and barley followed by 161
(42.5%) between sugarcane and wheat and least (92,
17.8%) between sugarcane and Sorghum (see Additional
file 6). The actual level of polymorphism detected by
automated fragment analysis using 47 fluorescent dye
labeled primers was much higher than that based on in
silico analysis although the trend was maintained. S. officinarum had maximum polymorphism with barley
(92.7%) followed by wheat (90.6%), rice (85.8%), maize
(67.7%) and Sorghum (61.4%). Forty-three (91.5%) of the
47 primers detected polymorphism (mean PIC of 0.85)

species, related genera, tropical and sub-tropical Indian
sugarcane varieties and five cereal species (Table 2).
This included 21 (95.5%, mean PIC of 0.81) amplifying
dinucleotide repeats, 16 (84.2%, PIC of 0.73) trinucleotide repeats, two (100%, PIC of 0.87) tetranucleotide
repeats, two (100%, PIC of 0.86) pentanucleotide repeats
and two (100%, PIC of 0.83) amplifying hexanucleotide
repeats. All the 38 (100%, mean PIC of 0.82) primers
that targeted amplification of class I repeats and five
(55.6%, PIC of 0.55) of the nine that targeted class II
repeats showed polymorphism among Saccharum species, genera, varieties and cereal species. The microsatellites in the 5’ and 3’UTR sequences showed higher
potential for polymorphism (15 out of 16, 94%, mean
PIC of 0.83) as compared to that from the coding
regions (28 out of 31, 90%, mean PIC of 0.77).
Due to high polyploidy and heterozygosity of the Saccharum genome, most (28, 65.1%) of the primers amplified two to three different loci (each locus being
designated as an UGMS marker) yielding a total of 60
loci with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 2
to 22 and the allele size varying from 82 to 408 bp
across sugarcane species, genera and varieties (Figure 2)
as well as five cereal species. The remaining 15 (34.9%)
primers gave single locus amplification (Table 2) with 1
to 23 alleles each. Overall, the 43 polymorphic primers
amplified an average of 7.42 alleles per UGMS marker
locus with a total of 722 alleles across 74 loci. Forty-two
(73 UGMS marker loci with 720 alleles, 97.7% polymorphic, mean PIC of 0.81) of the 43 informative primers revealed polymorphism between sugarcane species
and related genera, whereas 37 (66 UGMS marker loci
with 678 alleles, 86% polymorphic, PIC of 0.74) primers
detected polymorphism among the Indian commercial
sugarcane varieties (Figure 3). Twenty-six (34.7%) of the
75 UGMS marker loci showed heterozygosity in different genotypes used. Maximum heterozygous loci was
detected in five sugarcane species (14, 18.7%) followed
by commercial varieties (9, 12%) and minimum (4, 5.3%)
in the three related genera and five cereal species.
Molecular basis of UGMS polymorphism and its functional
significance

Comparison of fragment size (bp) of variant alleles
amplified at 75 polymorphic UGMS loci with changes in
number of repeats among Saccharum complex, varieties
and five cereal species revealed purely step-wise allelic
distribution for 51 (68%) loci, while remaining 24 (32%)
loci showed mixed type of allele size distribution (Figure
2). To elucidate the distribution pattern of UGMS alleles
showing fragment length polymorphism, 10 amplified
size variant alleles each of two microsatellite primers
namely, UGSuM2 and UGSuM27 showing both stepwise and mixed type of allele distribution were

Page 7 of 19

sequenced. High quality sequence alignment revealed
that the size variant alleles showing step-wise distribution contained the expected microsatellite repeat
sequences with conserved primer binding sites, but corresponded exactly to the step-wise multiples of the
number of repeat units. The size variation of sequenced
alleles was explained by differences in the number of
repeat units. Mixed type of allele distribution resulted
from both variation in the number of repeat-units and
insertions/deletions in the sequences flanking the
UGMS repeats. For instance, UGSuM2 (Figure 4A) and
UGSuM27 (Figure 4B) showing both step-wise and
mixed type allele size distribution had the expected
(AT)n and (GGC)n UGMS motifs, respectively with varying number of repeat-units in different sugarcane species, genera, varieties and cereals along with a small
stretch of nucleotide insertion/deletion in the flanking
regions of target microsatellites.
In order to assess the functional significance of the
UGMS, gene ontology classification of 767 unigenes carrying perfect and compound microsatellites was carried
out. Six hundred seventy-two (87.6%) of these (see
Additional files 3 and 4) could be functionally annotated
and were shown to encode enzymes for sugar metabolism (39%), structural proteins (26%), transcription and
translation factors (18%), signal transduction pathway
proteins (8%), cell growth and development factors (5%)
and disease resistance proteins (4%) (see Additional file
7). Three hundred sixty-four (54.2%) of 672 unigenes
contained microsatellite repeats in 89 different functional domains of proteins encoded by these unigenes
(see Additional file 8) which included cytochrome b/c
oxidase, chlorophyll A/B binding, FAD and ubiquitin
binding, sucrose synthase, alpha-amylase, acetyl COA,
aldehyde dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
lipase, S-adenosylmethionine, leucine rich repeat (LRR),
ferritin, protein kinase, chitinase, basic leucine zipper
(bZIP), zinc finger, TATA box, Myb and WRKY DNA
binding domains (Figure 5). Fifteen primers designed
from 15 different unigenes targeting such functional
domains (see Additional file 9) that gave single locus
amplification and step-wise allele distribution (Table 2)
were selected for validation. All of these primers gave
fragment length polymorphism among Saccharum complex, varieties and five cereals based on variation in the
number of UGMS repeat-units within the functional
domains.
One of these primers (UGSuM26) showing polymorphism targeted the amylase catalytic domain of b-amylase
(Figure 6). To understand the possible biological significance of the variable UGMS repeat in the amylase
domain, the structure predicted from the aminoacid
sequences of the functional domain was analyzed in
silico. It revealed variation in the active binding site

involved in formation of the Ca2+ ligand complexes due
to the presence of variable number of repeats encoding
Leucine-Serine aminoacid residues (Figure 6). This
would most likely alter the function of amylase gene in
respect of carbohydrate metabolism in sugarcane. Similarly, the expansion/contraction of microsatellite motifs
(AG)n encoding Arginine-Glutamine aminoacid residues
was observed in the protein kinase functional domain of
another sugarcane unigene which was amplified by the
primer UGSuM17. In silico analysis suggested a novel
secondary protein structure and catalytic domain binding site in the variant form that was different from the
native form which contained (AG) 18 microsatellite
repeats (see Additional file 10).
Assessment of functional genetic diversity

The pair-wise similarity among 36 genotypes belonging
to Saccharum species, related genera and 28 tropical

and sub-tropical Indian varieties of sugarcane based on
43 fluorescent dye labeled polymorphic primers revealed
a broad range from 0.12 to 0.91 with an average of 0.32
similarity index. The similarity among the sugarcane
species varied from 0.24 (IJ-76-3-1-9 and 1151) to 0.88
(IJ-76-3-1-9 and IM-76-256) with an average of 0.36.
Among the species, S. officinarum showed maximum
similarity (0.88) with S. robustum followed by S. barberi
with S. sinense (similarity of 0.82). S. spontaneum was
most divergent from the rest of the Saccharum species.
The similarity of the three genera of sugarcane,
namely, Erianthus, Narenga and Sclerostachya with the
sugarcane species varied from 0.22 to 0.90. Erianthus
had the least similarity with the Saccharum species.
Similarity among the 28 Indian tropical and sub-tropical
sugarcane varieties varied from 0.33 (Bo 91 and Co
8021) to 0.84 (Co 8371 and Co 8021) with an average of
0.40. The pair-wise similarity between the sugarcane

variation in a representative set of 14 commercial Indian tropical and sub-tropical sugarcane varieties. Fourteen alleles were amplified by a class I
UGMS marker (UGSuM17) designed from the unigene encoding Abcisic acid inducible protein kinase that contained (AG)18 repeat-motif. The
amplicons generated by the fluorescent dye labeled primers were resolved in MegaBACE automated DNA sequencer and analyzed in Fragment

species and varieties varied from 0.20 to 0.78 with average of 0.35, while between the three related genera and
varieties, it ranged from 0.13 to 0.80 with an average of
0.24. The average similarity between the sub-tropical
and tropical varieties (0.40) was slightly lower than the
average pair-wise similarity measures within the
sub-tropical (0.47) and tropical varietal groups (0.43).
The genetic relationship among the Saccharum species, related genera, and tropical and sub-tropical varieties is depicted in Figure 7. The UGMS markers clearly
discriminated all the 36 genotypes from each other and
resulted in a definitive grouping among different genera
and species of Saccharum with high bootstrap values
(81 to 100) that corresponded well with their known
pedigree relationships. All the clones of five Saccharum
species were included in the major cluster I in which S.
officinarum and S. robustum clones were sub-clustered
(Ia) with 98% occurrence in boot strap analysis; S. barberi and S. sinense clones grouped together in a separate
sub-cluster (Ib) with 100% occurrence and S. spontaneum grouped distinctly from these sub-clusters with
92% occurrence. The three related genera of Saccharum
being highly divergent from the Saccharum species and
varieties, grouped in a separate cluster (III) with 98%
occurrence.

All the tropical and sub-tropical varieties were
included in a distinct and separate cluster (II) with
seven distinct sub-clusters (Figure 7) with high (88)
bootstrap value. The tropical variety Co 62175 grouped
in a major sub-cluster IIa with its tropical male parent
Co 419 (similarity 0.71) with a bootstrap value of 99%.
In this sub-cluster (IIa), the other tropical varieties
namely, Co 8021, Co 8371, Co 7704 and Co 6304 were
also grouped together with average similarity of 0.77
(supported by 93% occurrences in bootstrap) possibly
because of their common ancestry involving Co 419.
The two sub-tropical varieties, Co 8347 and Co 87263,
and three other sub-tropical varieties, CoPant 84211, Co
89003 and Co 7717, in spite of having a common ancestor Co 775, were included in two distantly placed major
sub-clusters; IIb and IIg, respectively. It could be due to
inclusion of two diverse sub-tropical varieties, Co 87268
and CoLk 8102 having common parent Black Cheribon
within the sub-cluster IIb. Similarly, the clustering of
two tropical varieties namely, CoC 671 and Co 87025 in
the sub-cluster IIc with average similarity of 0.69 (supported by 100% occurrences) and five tropical varieties,
Co 7219, Co 740, Co 86010, Co 86032 and Co 85002
together in another separate large sub-cluster (IIf)
with average similarity of 0.64 (supported by 92%

common distant progenitor parent Black Cheribon. The
grouping of sub-tropical varieties namely, Co 1148, CoS
8436 and CoPant 84212 in cluster IId with an average
similarity of 0.70 (88% occurrences in bootstrap) was
clearly influenced by a common ancestry involving Co
1148. The sub-tropical varieties, CoJ 64, Co 1158 and
CoS 88230 included in the cluster IIe had common progenitor parent PoJ 2878 that could have influenced their
clustering with a high bootstrap value (94.3%).

Discussion
Unigene resources representing the transcriptome of an
organism provide opportunities to understand the
sequence organization in the genic regions of complex
polylploids and allow design of sequence based robust
markers for various genotyping applications. Considering the availability of a large unigene database of sugarcane in public domain, this resource was studied for the
presence and functional relevance of different microsatellite repeats. The frequency of microsatellites in sugarcane unigenes (1/10.9 kb) was lower than that obtained
in rice, Sorghum, barley and maize (1/3.6 kb, 1/5.9 kb,

1/8.9 kb and 1/9 kb, respectively) but similar to wheat
(1/10.6 kb). In polyploids, extensive loss of duplicated
genes and chromosomal rearrangement after polyploidization possibly have resulted in shortening and loss of
microsatellite repeat-motifs from the genic coding
sequences leading to dosage compensation, developmental stability and functional plasticity [16,17]. It would be
of interest to explore the mechanism that restricts
repeat expansion in genic regions of wheat and sugarcane leading to lower microsatellite frequency in these
species.
The observed frequency of the mononucleotides (12%)
in sugarcane was much less than that reported earlier
[18] in the unigenes of maize (75.8%), wheat (71%), barley (42.4%) and rice (41.6%), but similar to Sorghum
(13%). This suggested a lack of correspondence with
genome size and ploidy. The presence of longer (69
bases or more) A/T mononucleotide repeat-motifs in
sugarcane is comparable to earlier observations on the
nature and the frequency of such repeats in the genomic
and EST sequences of cereals [19]. The abundance of
trinucleotide microsatellite motifs in the sugarcane unigenes is consistent with the earlier observations based

microsatellite carrying unigenes. Multiple sequence alignment of the four size variant alleles showing step-wise distribution in the amylase
catalytic domain amplified from sugarcane species, genera, varieties and five cereals using primer (UGSuM26) for b-amylase unigene. Variation in

on EST sequences of sugarcane [3,5] and unigene
sequences of cereals [18]. The limited expansion of nontriplet microsatellites in the unigenes of sugarcane could
be due to selection against frameshift mutations in the
coding regions resulting from length changes in non-triplet repeats. We observed that more than 50% of the
identified trinucleotide repeat motifs in sugarcane were
GC-rich, possibly due to their high GC content [3,5]
and consequent usage bias in the coding sequences [20].
The abundance of GC-rich trinucleotide repeat motifs
coding for small and hydrophilic aminoacid alanine and
GA-rich dinucleotide motifs in sugarcane coding
sequences parallels their abundance in cereal exons [18].
The GA-rich dinucleotide UGMS motifs were observed
particularly in the 5’ and 3’ (32%) UTRs with balanced
(46 to 52%) GC content and therefore would support
better amplification as polymorphic markers [21].
The unigenes being longer in higher quality sequences
offer advantages over the EST sequence resources for
the development of microsatellite markers. In the present study, 961 (810 perfect and 151 compound) primerpairs were designed from the 767 different unigene
sequences carrying microsatellite repeats in the expressed
component of the sugarcane genome. The primers
designed from the unigene sequences flanking the

microsatellite motifs were highly efficient with amplification success rate of 94.9% that suggested the utility of the
unigene database in designing sequence based robust
genic markers. The paucity of usable and robust sequence
based markers in sugarcane has been a major limitation in
genetic analysis in this important sugar crop. The UGMS
markers developed by us have been placed in the public
domain and thus would be immediately useful in various
genotyping applications in sugarcane.
For most (87.6%) of the unigene sequences from which
the primers were designed, putative functions have been
predicted. For instance, about 39% and 4% of the primers
were from sequences related to sugar metabolic enzymes
and disease resistance, respectively. Interestingly, 54% of
the microsatellite repeats were present in various functional domains of proteins encoded by the unigenes. Correlation between fragment length polymorphism due to
variable number of UGMS repeat-units in the functional
domains and alteration of the predicted protein structure
and active ligand binding sites suggested functional relevance of the genic microsatellites. The evolutionary and
adaptive advantages of such variable microsatellite repeats
affecting the structure and function of the encoded proteins to generate favorable alleles for relaxation of environmental stress impact under the action of high natural

selection pressure through modulation of mutation/
recombination in these loci have been reported in many
eukaryotes [22]. For instance, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
the expansion and contraction of microsatellite repeats in
the coding regions of protein kinase genes have provided
greater adaptability to various abiotic and biotic stresses
[22]. Sugarcane is a tropical crop. However, varieties
adapted to subtropical condition have been developed in
India. Variation in microsatellites in the coding regions of
these two groups was evident. For example, the tropical
sugarcane varieties Co7219 and Co740 contained (AG)18
microsatellite repeats whereas varieties Co89003 and
Co7717 adapted to sub-tropical condition showed

contraction of AG repeats to (AG)10 leading to alteration
of protein structure and possibly function. Understanding
the adaptive significance of such variation is of relevance
that needs further experimentation. Designing of genic
microsatellite markers targeting functional domains in
solanaceous crops like tomato and pepper [23] was
reported. Association of such markers with many traits
including diseases like neuronal disorders [22] and cancers
[24] in humans based on expansion/contraction of
repeated tracts of microsatellites encoding aminoacid residues in the functional domains of proteins that changes
their secondary structure and function has been demonstrated. The information generated in this study thus

would allow selection of candidate gene-based markers for
rapidly establishing marker-trait linkages in sugarcane.
The efficiency of sugarcane UGMS markers to detect
polymorphism within Saccharum complex and among
five cereals was evaluated in silico that was further

validated experimentally. In silico polymorphism based
on variation in length of the UGMS repeat among S. officinarum and each of five cereal species could be due to
divergent microsatellite evolution in these lineages [25].
The actual level of polymorphism detected by automated

Parida et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:251
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/251

fragment analysis using fluorescent dye labeled primers
was much higher than that based on in silico analysis.
The expected relationship in evolution was reflected by
actual polymorphism observed between sugarcane and
cereals. With the use of automated fragment analysis system, all the allelic variants could be captured efficiently
in a set of 36 sugarcane genotypes and five cereal species,
thereby providing a platform for rapid, automated and
large-scale genotyping of sugarcane. Further, the allele
size information generated would enable multiplexing of
the UGMS markers, thus making them useful in various
high-throughput genotyping applications. The observed
polymorphism (97.7%) among the members of the Saccharum species and related genera is higher than that
estimated earlier using the fluorescent dye labeled sugarcane genomic (90%, [2]) and EST derived microsatellite
markers (81%, [3]). The higher potential of UGMS markers particularly the longer class I di- and tetra-nucleotide repeat-motifs to detect polymorphism as compared
to the class I trinucleotide and class II motifs reflected
correspondence between the type and length of repeats,
and the level of polymorphism as observed earlier in
sugarcane [4] and rice [21,26]. Higher polymorphic
potential of UGMS markers derived from the UTRs than
that from the conserved coding sequences, which are
constrained by purifying selection [25,27] suggested the
utility of unigenes having such repeat-motifs as a source
of polymorphic microsatellite markers.
The level of inter-varietal polymorphism (86%, mean
PIC of 0.74) detected by the fluorescent dye labeled primers was higher than the level reported previously with
the labeled sugarcane EST derived (38%, PIC of 0.23,
[3]) microsatellite markers. The discrepancies could be
due to use of different sets of markers and genotypes.
However, genotyping using the automated fragment
analysis system in this study revealed comparable level
of polymorphism with the genic and genomic microsatellite markers in sugarcane. It suggested that the genic
microsatellite markers developed in this study would be
highly informative and useful in sugarcane genetics,
genomics and breeding.
Unigene sequences usually have advantages of unique
identity and position in the transcribed regions of the
genome. If this is the case then primers designed from
the unigene sequences flanking the microsatellite repeats
should amplify unique single locus. In contrast, in the
present study, multiple loci and thus amplification of
multiple sequences of the same gene was observed for
28 (65.1%) of the 43 primers designed from different
microsatellite carrying unigenes. This is possibly due to
poor representation of unigene sequences in the database that was scanned for microsatellite repeats. Alternatively, all the copies of a microsatellite carrying gene
that are PCR amplified might not be transcribed due to

Page 15 of 19

dosage compensation leading to silencing of all but one
copy in the large polyploid sugarcane genome [16,28].
In spite of high polyploidy and heterozygosity of the
sugarcane genome, 15 (34.9%) of the 43 polymorphic
UGMS primers amplified a single discrete locus with
step-wise allele distribution and showed fragment length
polymorphism across the members of Saccharum complex and varieties in an automated fragment analysis
system. This could be due to polyploidization followed
by selective gene loss [29,16,28] resulting in retention of
a single copy during evolution of Saccharum. Gene
ontology analysis of these 14 unigenes showed correspondence with the genes coding for basic metabolic
process of energy generation, degradation of cellular
building blocks, DNA recombination and repair proteins
which played a vital role in plant biology and thus
remained as single copy without alteration.
Distribution pattern of size variant alleles amplified at
UGMS loci showed higher proportionate (68%) distribution of alleles showing step-wise mutation than that of
mixed allele distribution (32%). High-quality sequence
alignment of the size variant alleles showing both stepwise and mixed distributions confirmed the presence of
variable number of repeat-units in different amplified
alleles and additional insertions/deletions in the flanking
regions of microsatellite repeat-motifs, which contributed to the UGMS fragment length polymorphism
observed in the Saccharum complex, varieties and cereal
species. Such complex pattern of allele distribution and
fragment length polymorphism at microsatellite loci due
to variation in the copy number of microsatellite repeats
and insertions/deletions in the flanking sequences of
microsatellite motifs have been observed earlier in species like maize with a large genome size [30].
It is important to evaluate molecular diversity existing
among the members of the Saccharum species and
related genera, since major varietal improvement in
sugarcane was through inter-specific hybridization. Use
of S. spontaneum and Erianthus is vital since they carry
many traits of agricultural importance including tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses [14]. Identification of
true inter-specific and inter-generic hybrids is crucial for
successful transfer of the target traits. Besides, monitoring of introgression is required to verify the transfer of
the target genomic regions from the wild relatives to the
cultivated genetic backgrounds. 97.7% of markers
revealed inter-specific and inter-generic polymorphism
and thus would enable precise identification of interspecific and inter-generic hybrids, and also provide
opportunities to assess transfer of genic regions to desirable genetic backgrounds, thereby offering advantages
over the random markers such as RAPD and AFLP.
Evaluation of molecular diversity in a set of 28 commercial Indian tropical and sub-tropical sugarcane varieties

Parida et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:251
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/251

using unigene based genic microsatellite markers revealed
a wider range (0.33 to 0.84 with an average of 0.40) of
genetic similarity than the level detected previously with
RAPD (0.59 to 0.81 with average of 0.71, [12]), maize
microsatellite (0.40 to 0.73 with average of 0.64, [13]),
sugarcane genomic microsatellite (0.39 to 0.82 with average of 0.53, [4]) and AFLP (0.52 to 0.83 with average of
0.62, [14]) markers. Hence, high efficiency of UGMS markers in assaying functional diversity in the transcribed
component of the sugarcane genome makes them valuable
for understanding diversity pattern, and variety identification. The commercial Indian sugarcane varieties used in
this study were bred for either tropical or subtropical
agro-climatic conditions with differential contribution of
S. spontaneum, the most variable Saccharum species [14].
The random markers assaying genetic variation largely in
different non-genic genomic regions that contribute to
large genome size [31] would be of little relevance to phenotypic selection exercised during variety development. In
contrast, the genic microsatellite markers assaying variation in the transcribed non-repetitive regions of the genome might be directly related to the phenotypic variation
[25]. Our results thus suggested that the genetic base of
the Indian sugarcane varieties is not very narrow particularly in the genic regions of the genome, which is most
likely due to selection for wider adaptability of these varieties. The adaptive environment as well as parentage of
these varieties corresponded well with the clustering pattern obtained using a small set of these markers, that
further suggested the usefulness of the designed markers
in realistic assessment of genetic diversity.

Conclusion
The present study identified microsatellites in sugarcane
unigenes and assessed their functional relevance. A total
of 961 primer-pairs were designed targeting 767 different
unigenes carrying microsatellite repeats in the expressed
component of the sugarcane genome, which would
extend the accessibility of such microsatellite markers to
researchers for many genetic studies in sugarcane. Precise
allele sizing in automated fragment analysis system has
encouraging implications to various high-throughput
genotyping applications in sugarcane. Assessment of
functional genetic diversity revealed that the genetic base
of the Indian sugarcane varieties is not narrow.
Methods
Mining of microsatellites in the unigenes of sugarcane
and assessment of their functional relevance

Fifteen thousand five hundred ninty-four sugarcane
(Saccharum sp.) unigenes (Build 13.0, 19th Feb’ 2008)
comprising of 9.17 million base sequences were acquired
in FASTA format from the recent NCBI FTP UniGene
repository database of S. officinarum [32] in batches and

Page 16 of 19

searched for microsatellites using a perl scripting language based program MISA (MIcroSAtellite) [33] considering complementary sequence of repeat-motifs (like
AG, GA, TC and CT) in the same class [18]. The identified microsatellites were characterized as perfect (monomers to hexamers repeated up to 100 times without any
interruption), compound (non-interrupting) with at least
two different repeat-motifs without any interruption,
compound (interrupting) with a maximum of 100
nucleotides interposing two microsatellite repeat-motifs,
class I (≥20 nucleotides) and class II (12 to 20 nucleotides) types. The microsatellite (excluding monomers)
containing unigenes were used in a batch module for
designing forward and reverse primers employing the
microsatellite primer discovery tool of BatchPrimer3
[34]. All default options except for the optimum and
maximum primer sizes of 22 and 24 nucleotides, respectively, were used. The putative functions for these unigenes were determined using NCBI BLASTX search tool
[35] as against the nr-protein database. The BLASTX
output was annotated into four functional categories viz,
exact, putative, unknown and hypothetical, and then
extracted to Excel sheets. Different structural components namely, coding and untranslated regions (5’UTRs
and 3’UTRs) in the unigene sequences was determined
using the software tools FGENESH [36] and UTRScan
[37], respectively. The aminoacid sequences encoded by
the predicted coding nucleotide regions of the microsatellite carrying unigenes were analyzed using the software Pfam [38] to determine the presence of functional
domain/protein family within the UGMS. The aminoacid sequences of the functional domain carrying microsatellites was analyzed further using the I-TASSER
automated web server [39,40] for prediction of three
dimensional protein structure and active binding sites
with ligands. Five different protein models and active
binding sites were predicted at significant cut-off confidence (C ≥ -1.5) and binding site (BS ≥ 0.5) scores. The
high quality protein model of correct topology and
protein-ligand complex active binding sites was identified based on high C- and BS- scores.
Evaluation of polymorphic potential

To assess the amplification success rate of microsatellite
markers designed from sugarcane unigenes, 176 primers
were used to amplify one genotype of S. officinarum.
Forty-seven, including thirty-eight class I and nine class
II markers of these, labeled with 6-carboxyflourescein
(6-FAM) dye phosphoramidites, were used to genotype
one accession each belonging to five Saccharum species
and three related genera, and twenty-eight commercial
Indian tropical and sub-tropical sugarcane varieties
(Table 3) for evaluating their polymorphic potential and
assessment of genetic diversity. Five cereal species

Parida et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:251
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/251

namely, rice, wheat, maize, Sorghum and barley were
included in the experiment for comparison. Standard
PCR constituents and cycling conditions except for
annealing temperature, which varied from 55°C to 64°C
depending on the primers, were used for PCR amplification. The amplified products were purified, mixed with
3.75 μl of MegaBACE formamide loading buffer and
0.25 μl of internal-lane MegaBACE™ET 550-R ROX size
standard, denatured, cooled and resolved in automated
MegaBACE 1000 DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway NJ, USA). The electropherogram
containing trace files were analyzed and automated
allele calling was carried out using the Binning Peak
Post Processor tool of MegaBACE™Fragment Profiler
Software Version 1.2 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway NJ, USA). The actual allele size (bp) was determined and fragment length polymorphism among the
sugarcane genotypes and cereal species was identified.
The average peak height and peak quality of alleles generated for all the UGMS loci were graphed and alleles
exhibiting average peak height and quality of ≥ 1500
and ≥ 6.0 fluorescence units [41,42] respectively were
considered for sizing and base-pair estimation. Allele
binning was performed for individual UGMS loci for
precise and accurate allele size determination and discrimination of homozygous and heterozygous allele types
[42,43] for each genotype.
Variation in the fragment size (bp) of amplified alleles
at each polymorphic UGMS marker locus was compared
with changes in the number of microsatellite repeatunits at that target locus, and the occurrence of “stepwise” and “mixed” type of allele size distribution was
inferred. When the allele size differences strictly corresponded to the variation in the number of repeat-units,
it was considered as stepwise distribution. A mixed
allele distribution was assumed when the allele size differences could partly be explained by the stepwise
model. Multiple amplicons obtained by a primer-pair
with peaks ≥ 1500 fluorescence units showing ≥ 100 bp
allele size differences were binned into different loci. To
confirm that the primers amplified the target microsatellite repeat motifs in different species and genera, the
amplified products were purified using Micropon PCR
purification kits (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and
sequenced two times in both forward and reverse directions using a capillary-based Automated DNA Sequencer (MegaBACE 1000, Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway NJ, USA). The trace files were base called,
checked for quality and assembled into contigs [44].
The high quality sequences thus obtained were used for
interspecies comparison using CLUSTALW multiple
sequence alignment tool employing BIOEDIT software
[45]. Ten size variant amplicons each of three microsatellite markers (UGSuM2, UGSuM26 and UGSuM27)

Page 17 of 19

showing both step-wise and mixed type of allele size distribution in sugarcane species, genera, varieties and cereals were eluted, purified, cloned in pGEM-T Easy
Vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced as described
above.
Assessment of functional genetic diversity

The polymorphic information content (PIC) was calculated using the formula, PIC = 1- ∑Pij2 [46], where Pij is
the frequency of the j th allele for i th locus summed
across all alleles for the locus. Cluster analysis among
the 36 genotypes of Saccharum species, varieties and
related genera was based on Nei and Li similarity coefficient [47] using the un-weighted pair group method
(UPGMA) in PowerMarker Version 3.0 [48,49] software.
The confidence limits of UPGMA based dendrogram
was determined by 1000 bootstrap replicates and bootstrap of 50% majority rule consensus unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed.
