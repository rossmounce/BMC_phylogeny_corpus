Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection increases the risk of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Small
interfering RNA (siRNA) can be a potential new tool for HBV therapy. Given the high heterogeneity of HBV strains
and the sensitivity towards sequences changes of siRNA, finding a potent siRNA inhibitor against the conservative
site on the HBV genome is essential to ensure a therapeutic application.
Results: Forty short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmids were constructed to target conserved regions
among nine HBV genotypes. HBV 1.3-fold genome plasmids carrying various genotypes were co-transfected with
shRNA plasmids into either Huh7 cells or mice. The levels of various viral markers were examined to assess the
anti-HBV efficacy of siRNA. Four (B245, B376, B1581 and B1789) were found with the ability to potently inhibit HBV
RNA, DNA, surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg) and core antigen (HBcAg) expression in HBV genotypes A,
B, C, D and I (a newly identified genotype) in Huh7 cells and in mice. No unusual cytotoxicity or off-target effects
were noted.
Conclusions: Such siRNA suggests an alternate way of inhibiting various HBV genotypes in vitro and in vivo,
promising advances in the treatment of HBV.

Background
Worldwide, there are over 350 million people persistently infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1]. Chronic
HBV infections may have serious consequences, including acute hepatitis, as well as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2]. Together,
these are responsible for over 1 million deaths worldwide each year [3]. Current treatments for HBV infections are not only expensive and have significant side
effects, but also only induce a partial response [4-6].
In eukaryotic cells, RNA interference (RNAi), a type of
double-stranded (ds) RNA, initiates and directs
sequence-specific, post-transcriptional silencing of
homologous genes [7,8]. It has been demonstrated in
previous studies that expression and replication of HBV
can be suppressed by siRNA or shRNA with clinical
implications [9-11]. However, the wide heterogeneity of
HBV sequences may render RNAi inhibitors ineffective.

To explore this further, 40 shRNA expression plasmids
were constructed to target the sites that were conserved
among HBV genotypes A through I. Their anti-HBV
efficacy was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Results
Screening for effective and broad anti-HBV shRNA

The shRNA plasmids co-transfected with two HBV 1.35
plasmids (N10 and Y1021) exhibited varying levels of
extracellular HBsAg expression (Table 1). Of the forty
shRNA plasmids, four plasmids (B245, B376, B1581 and
B1789, Figure 1) were selected as candidates for further
research based on their remarkable inhibitory ability and
also relatively lower off-target probability (off-target
score of above 30). The sequence conservation among
the A to I genotypes for B245, B376, B1581 and B1789
were 95.1% (95%CI: 92.2~97.2), 88.7% (95%CI:
84.7~91.9), 97.3% (95%CI: 94.8~98.7), and 97.6% (95%
CI: 95.2~98.9), respectively (Table 2). The data also
shows that the target sequences of B245, B1581 and
B1789 were more conserved than the target sequence of
B376 (p < 0.05) in genotype B and C (Table 2).

Adverse side-effects evaluation for selected shRNA
plasmids

ShRNA inhibit gene expression of HBV strains with
different genotypes in vitro

The B245, B376, B1581, and B1789 plasmids were transfected into Huh7 cells to determine cytotoxicity by the
WST-8 assay. No significant siRNA-induced cytotoxicity
was observed for these siRNA when compared to an
empty pSUPER vector (p = 0.66, data not shown). The
mRNA levels of four major interferon stimulated genes
(STAT1, OAS1, GBP1 and MX1) in transfected cells
were measured by quantitative realtime PCR with
GAPDH mRNA acting as a control. As shown in Figure
2, between values 1 and 2, logarithmic increases for the
IFN-stimulatable mRNAs were only observed in the
IFN-treated cells, but not observed in any of the shRNA
treated cells vs. untreated cells. From this, it can be concluded that an IFN response is not activated by these
anti-HBV siRNAs.

The levels of cytoplasmic HBV pg/pc RNA (3.5 kb) and
HBV DNA in cultured supernatants were determined by
realtime RT-PCR/PCR and presented in Figure 3. The
pg/pc RNA level of five HBV strains with different genotypes were reduced by 58%~93% in B245(69%~93%),
B376(59%~91%), B1581(67%~90%) and B1789(58%~88%)
treatments, while the HBV DNA level observed in supernatants was decreased by 77%~99% in these shRNA plasmid treatments (B245: 83%~99%, B376: 79%~99%,
B1581:88%~98%, B1789: 77%~99%).
In addition, the extracellular and intracellular antigen
levels in Huh7 cells that were co-transfected with HBV and
shRNA plasmids were also determined (Figure 4). In the
shRNA-treated Huh7 cells, the average extracellular HBsAg
expression level of all five HBV strains decreased by 1.66 ±

0.36 logs. The average intracellular HBsAg expression level
decreased by 1.47 ± 0.33 logs, while the extracellular
HBeAg levels decreased by 1.04 ± 0.23 logs, and the intracellular HBcAg levels by 1.71 ± 0.49 logs. The effect of the
siRNA treatment on HBeAg levels was weaker than that on
the HBsAg or HBcAg levels (P < 0.001, Figure 5).

Discussion
Activated RNAi pathway can silence HBV replication
and expression [13,14]. However, in most previous studies, the activity of RNAi against HBV is often evaluated
with only one HBV strain [15-18]. Nine HBV genotypes
(including a newly identified genotype “I”), designated as
the letters A through I, have been recognized with an
accompanying sequence divergence of >8% over the
entire genome [19-21]. The influence of genotypes on
HBV replication efficacy and antigen expression level
had been proved to be various and that may further
associate with clinical outcomes and antiviral treatments
responses [22]. Hence, RNAi designed for one genotype
may not necessarily be effective against another genotype. Given the high heterogeneity of HBV strains and
the sensitivity of siRNA to the sequence changes,
designing siRNA targets against the conservative site on
HBV genome is essential to ensure activity across all
genotypes [23].

Cytoplasmic RNAs, from Huh7 cells treated with or without IFNa-2a
or transfected with either pSUPER vector or shRNA plasmids, were
analysed by realtime RT-PCR for IFN stimulated genes STAT1, OAS1,
GBP1 and MX1. The values on the figure, plotted as “Relative gene
expression level” on the y-axis, were calculated as the mRNA levels
of ISGs divided by the GAPDH (control) mRNA level. Student t test
was used to assess the difference between shRNA plasmids
(including empty pSUPER vector) of transfected cells and nontransfected cells (mock). No significant difference was observed.

used to evaluate the effect of shRNA over nine days
(Figure 6). All HBV plasmids expressed detectable
HBsAg and HBeAg in mice sera (Figure 6). As compared
to the control mice (HBV+L1254), B245 and B376 treatments reduced HBsAg expression by over 99% in all five
HBV genotypes. Furthermore, B1581 and B1789 treatments suppressed HBsAg by over 99% in mice infected
with HBV genotypes A, B, C and D. In a novel W29
strain representing genotype I however, B1581 and
B1789 treatments only reduced HBsAg expression by
about 90%. With regards to serum HBeAg for genotypes
A, B, C, D and I, B245, B376, B1581 and B1789 treatments suppressed HBeAg by 96%~99%, 79%~99%,
94%~99%, and 89%~99%, respectively. The overview of
the results shows that B245 is the most potent agent.

In shRNA expression systems, two different promoters
are predominantly used: U6 and H1, both driven by
human polymerase III (poly III). Compared to Pol II
promoters, Pol III promoters generally possess a greater
capacity to synthesize RNA transcripts of a higher yield
and rarely induce interferon responses [17,24]. However,
a previous study noted that U6 Pol III-expressed
shRNAs may cause serious toxicity in vivo by saturating
the endogenous miR pathway [25]. In this report, we
constructed 40 shRNA plasmids (Table 1) with various
targets, using a human H1 Pol III promoter. The target
sequences of the final four selected shRNA plasmids
demonstrated high sequence conservation among A to I
genotypes and significant inhibition activity, in both
Huh7 cells and mice, against the expressions of HBV
RNA, DNA and antigens in genotypes A, B, C, D and I.
The inhibitory efficacy of these shRNAs (B245, B376,

B1581 and B1789) however, varies significantly against
the various genotypes for different viral markers in different models (Figure 3, 4, 5 and 6). Such differences in
efficiency may be due to differences in the mRNA’s secondary structure or the target site accessibility [26].
B245 was the most effective of the four candidates.
It should be noted that both the cell-transfection
model and hydrodynamic injection model more closely
resemble an acute model of a HBV infection. This is a
potential limitation in this study, as most individuals
who need anti-HBV therapy are chronically infected.
Compared to the HBV transgenic mouse models and
stably transfected cell lines, the former are more flexible
and convenient in evaluating the efficacy of shRNAs as
a way to inhibit various HBV strains. Nevertheless, the
effective shRNA candidates should be studied further in
different models.

methodology for anti-HBV therapy [33]. In the present
study, and supported by other studies [13,34,35], using
RNAi as an inhibitor for HBV effectively reduces viral
antigen levels, including HBsAg. It can be speculated that
RNAi-treatments may offer complementary effects for
current anti-HBV therapy. However, the final application
of RNAi-based anti-HBV drugs depends on the development of effective and safe RNAi delivery systems.

Conclusions
In summary, four candidate shRNA plasmids significantly inhibited HBV genotypes A, B, C, D and I in
vitro and in vivo. A potential avenue of investigation
would be a combination strategy of various siRNA in a
single transcript to improve efficacy and also prevent or
at least delay the rise of viral escape mutants.

Figure 5 Comparing the RNAi-induced silencing effect on
different viral markers. Data were displayed the average antigen
level of the 4 siRNAs reduced for five HBV strains. “Ex” = Extracellular
and “In” = Intracellular. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess
the difference. An asterisk represents a statistical difference of P <
0.01 in comparison with the other markers (Ex HBeAg vs. Others P <
0.001, Ex HBsAg vs. In HBsAg P = 0.05, Ex HBsAg vs. In HBcAg P =
0.82, In HBsAg vs. In HBcAg P = 0.10.)

Because HBV contains overlapping open reading
frames (ORFs) and all four HBV transcripts overlap in
their 3′ terminals, a single siRNA targeting multiple
areas could be designed to maximize inhibitory potency
[23]. The siRNAs targeting C ORF, such as
B2389~B2397, presented in Table 1, show activity only
against the 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA, but are unlikely to
show any activity against the other three transcripts
(Figure 1). Meanwhile, all four siRNAs demonstrated
more silencing activity with regards to HBsAg expression than HBeAg expression for various genotypes in
the cell cultures and mice. The targets on both however
were the same in the HBV transcripts for the two proteins (Figure 4 and Figure 5), which was also observed
in a previous study [23]. HBcAg, a viral capsid correlated with viral replication [27,28], was silenced as effectively as HBsAg, but HBeAg was not (Figure 4).
The registered agents currently available for the treatment of HBV infections, such as interferon and nucleoside analogues, can dramatically decrease HBV DNA
levels and induce particular HBeAg loss, but will rarely
cause HBsAg loss in chronic hepatitis B patients [29-32].
RNA interference, on the other hand, can theoretically be
directed to cleave any target RNA, providing a novel

Methods
HBV Plasmids

Five HBV 1.35-fold genome plasmids - N10 (genotype Ae,
AY707087), C4371 (genotype Ba, GU357842), Y1021
(genotype C1, GU357845), Y10 (genotype D1, GU357846)
and W29 (genotype I1, GU357844) were used for transfection and hydrodynamic injection. The constructions and
molecular and phenotypic characteristics are described in
our previous report [36].
Bioinformatics Analysis

To define the conservative sites on HBV genomes
amongst the various genotypes, all available complete
genome sequences of HBV, as of April 2009, were
downloaded from GenBank. Multiple alignment was
done with ClustalX2 under default settings (Gap Opening:10, Gap Extension: 0.2, Delay Divergent Sequences
(%): 30, DNA Transition Weight: 0.5, Use Negative
Matrix: Off). The most representative and informative
sequence in terms of phylogeny were collected as a
dataset and the most similar sequences were removed
using all pairwise distance scan. A total of 327 HBV
genomes including A-I genotypes and nearly all reported
subtypes were remained in the final dataset. The genotypes and subtypes of six HBV genomes isolated in the
study were submitted to phylogenetic analysis using
MEGA 4.0 software (data not shown). Forty sites with
conservative sequences were selected and the shRNA
plasmids were constructed (Table 1). The designed
siRNA were evaluated for potential off-target effects by
the online SOS program http://rnai.cs.unm.edu/offTarget. The sequences and positions of the forty designed
shRNA targets are shown in Table 1.
ShRNA Plasmids

ShRNA plasmids were cloned downstream of the human
H1 promoter in the vector pSUPER [37]. The target

sites for siRNA were chosen based on conservative sites
among the major HBV genotypes and subtypes. An
shRNA plasmid targeting the firefly luciferase gene was
used as a control (L1254: TGG CTA CAT TCT GGA
GAC ATA).
Cell Culture and In Vitro Transfection

The plasmids used for in vitro transfection were purified
with PlasmidSelect Xtra Starter Kit (GE Health, Sweden)
and the concentrations were determined by the UVspectrophotometric method. To determine the ability of
siRNA to inhibit HBV gene expression in cell cultures,
Huh7 cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of HBV plasmids, 1 μg of shRNA plasmids and 0.4 μg of a
pcDNA3.1-SEAP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. They were then harvested four days
later. The pcDNA3.1-SEAP plasmid is a reporter plasmid expressing secreted alkaline phosphatase and used
for transfection efficiency standardization by estimating
SEAP enzymatic activity (Pierce; Kunming, China) in
the culture supernatant.

Measurement of HBV RNA and DNA

For detection of the cytoplasmic HBV RNA, total RNA
was extracted from cells using Tripure Isolation Reagent
(Roche Applied Science, Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Potential residual DNA
contamination of RNA preparations were excluded by
DNase I digestion. Ten nanograms of RNA were analysed by AccessQuick realtime RT-PCR System (Promega, USA) on a CFX96 instrument (Bio-Rad, USA).
The HBV pg/pc (pregenomic/preCore) RNA level was
detected by primers PGP (-CACCTCTGCCTAATCATC, nt1826-nt1843) and BC1 (GGAAAGAAGTCAGAAGGCAA, nt1974-nt1955) [43] using probe CP2
(HEX-ATGTTCATGTCCTACTGTTCAAGCC-BHQ2).
The transcript copy number was normalized to those of
GAPDH.
For the HBV DNA assay, 100 μL of supernatant was
pre-heated at 50°C for 20 minutes and then treated with
1 U DNase I for 2 hours to eliminate residual plasmids.
The reaction was terminated by EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mM. The mixture was then incubated
at 70°C for 10 min and the HBV DNA was extracted
using QIAamp DNA blood kits (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). HBV DNA quantification assays were performed using a commercial real-time PCR kit (Kehua,
Shanghai, China).

Possible adverse effects of shRNA on cells were evaluated using morphology criterion, growth rate assessment, and by noting the cytotoxicity profile of
transfected cells. Cytotoxicity was determined through
a WST-8 assay (Cell Counting Kit-8, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) [38,39]. The number of viable cells was
then determined by absorbance measured at 450 nm
on an automated plate reader. The potential off-target
effects of siRNA were evaluated by monitoring
the IFN response. Huh7 cells were transfected with
1 μg of shRNA plasmids. Non-transfected cells treated
or untreated with 500 IU of IFNa-2a (Anfulong,
Huadali Company, China) for 24 h served as a positive
control [40]. Expression profile of four major interferon-stimulated (STAT1, OAS1, GBP1 and MX1)
were analyzed by a quantitative RT-realtime PCR using
the previously reported primers while the GAPDH
level served as a control[41].

HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAg levels were determined by
chemiluminescence using commercial assay kits (Wantai,
Beijing, China). The relative level of each antigen was
expressed as an S/CO (signal/cutoff) value, on a linear
range from 1 to 1000 for all three assays. The lower
detection limit was 10 pg/mL for the HBsAg and HBeAg
assays, and 50 pg/ml for the HBcAg assay. In regards to
the intracelluar HBV antigen assay, the transfected cells
were treated with a suitable lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES,
1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg 2 Cl, 0.4%
n-Dodecyl b-D- maltoside, n-Dodecyl b-D-maltoside, and
10% Glycerol) at room temperature for 30 minutes and
the supernatants were separated through centrifugation
and used for immunoassay.

Mice Experiments

Statistical Evaluation

To evaluate the anti-viral effects of siRNA in vivo, an
HBV hydrodynamic injection was conducted in BALB/c
mice. Briefly, 50 μg of purified HBV plasmid and 10 μg
shRNA plasmids were diluted to 2 mL with physiological saline and then injected into the tail vein within 510 s. Mice sera were assayed every day for HBsAg and
HBeAg from Day 0 to Day 9. For each group, five mice
aging from 4-6 weeks were used [42]. All animals
received humane care and the study protocol complied
with the institution’s ethics guidelines.

Statistical analyses were performed using independent
Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA,). Differences were considered to be statistically significant for p values ≤ 0.05.
