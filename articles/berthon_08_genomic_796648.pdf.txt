Abstract
Background: Comparative analysis of genomes is valuable to explore evolution of genomes,
deduce gene functions, or predict functional linking between proteins. Here, we have systematically
analyzed the genomic environment of all known DNA replication genes in 27 archaeal genomes to
infer new connections for DNA replication proteins from conserved genomic associations.
Results: Two distinct sets of DNA replication genes frequently co-localize in archaeal genomes:
the first includes the genes for PCNA, the small subunit of the DNA primase (PriS), and Gins15;
the second comprises the genes for MCM and Gins23. Other genomic associations of genes
encoding proteins involved in informational processes that may be functionally relevant at the
cellular level have also been noted; in particular, the association between the genes for PCNA,
transcription factor S, and NudF. Surprisingly, a conserved cluster of genes coding for proteins
involved in translation or ribosome biogenesis (S27E, L44E, aIF-2 alpha, Nop10) is almost
systematically contiguous to the group of genes coding for PCNA, PriS, and Gins15. The functional
relevance of this cluster encoding proteins conserved in Archaea and Eukarya is strongly supported
by statistical analysis. Interestingly, the gene encoding the S27E protein, also known as
metallopanstimulin 1 (MPS-1) in human, is overexpressed in multiple cancer cell lines.
Conclusion: Our genome context analysis suggests specific functional interactions for proteins
involved in DNA replication between each other or with proteins involved in DNA repair or
transcription. Furthermore, it suggests a previously unrecognized regulatory network coupling
DNA replication and translation in Archaea that may also exist in Eukarya.

Background

Alignment of prokaryotic genomes revealed that synteny is
globally weak, indicating that bacterial and archaeal chromosomes experience continuous remodeling [1-3]. A few operons encoding physically interacting proteins involved in
fundamental processes have been preserved between Archaea

and Bacteria in the course of evolution (for example, operons
encoding ribosomal proteins, RNA polymerase subunits, or
ATP synthase subunits) [1-3]. Most gene strings are only conserved in closely related genomes or exhibit a patchy distribution among genomes in one large group of organisms (for
example, in Archaea). Therefore, gene associations that are

conserved between distantly related organisms should confer
some selective advantage. The co-localization of a particular
group of genes may optimize their co-regulation at the transcriptional level [4,5] or facilitate the assembly of their products in large protein complexes [6]. A corollary of this
statement is that characterization of evolutionarily conserved
gene clusters can be used to infer functional linkage of proteins (that is, physical interaction or participation in a common structural complex, metabolic pathway, or biological
process). Various comparative genomics methods that exploit
gene context are commonly used. These approaches analyze
protein and domain fusion or gene neighborhood (groups of
genes found in putative operons or divergently transcribed
gene pairs) to predict functions for, and interactions between,
the encoded proteins (reviewed in [2,7-10]). A dramatic
example of a discovery based on genome context analysis is
the identification in Archaea and Bacteria of proteins associated with the specific DNA repeats known as CRISPR [11].
These cas proteins (for CRISPR associated proteins), which
were first proposed to be members of a putative DNA repair
system [12], are probable actors in a nucleic-acid based
'immunity' system [13]. Comparative analysis of genomes has
been especially helpful in Archaea for functional prediction of
uncharacterized proteins in the absence of genetic studies
(reviewed in [14,15]). For instance, this strategy has allowed
the computational prediction and subsequent experimental
confirmation of the archaeal exosome [16,17] and of novel
proteins associated with the Mre11/Rad50 complex [18,19].

subset of genes encoding DNA replication proteins often colocalize, that is, these genes are arranged in operon-like structures (contiguous or adjacent genes in the same transcriptional orientation) that are preserved between distant
lineages (as for the majority of the cases discussed here), or
they lie in a common chromosomal region less than 5 kilobases away from each other. Some of these associations are
conserved between distant lineages, indicating that they
reflect a functional and possibly a physical interaction
between the gene products. In particular, we identified two
conserved genomic associations of DNA replication genes
that suggest a functional connection between the PCNA, the
DNA primase and the MCM helicase via the GINS complex.
We also observed that the gene for PCNA is linked to the gene
coding for the transcription factor S (TFS) in 12 out of the 27
analyzed genomes, as well as to a gene encoding the ADPribose pyrophosphatase NudF in 8 genomes, pointing toward
the existence of cross-talk between DNA replication, DNA
repair, and transcription. In addition, we noticed that the
gene encoding the initiator protein Cdc6 is usually adjacent to
a predicted origin of replication, sometimes together with or
close to the gene coding for the small subunit of DNA
polymerase (Pol)D (DP1) in euryarchaeal genomes, suggesting that PolD may be recruited by Cdc6 at the origin of replication. Moreover, some proteins without clear functional
assignments (an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding
(OB)-fold containing protein, a recently described new
GTPase, DnaG) are encoded by genes that co-localize with
DNA replication genes, suggesting that they may be involved
in DNA transaction processes. Surprisingly, our analysis also
reveals a widely conserved clustering of a particular set of
genes coding for DNA replication proteins (Gins15, PCNA
and/or the DNA primase small subunit (PriS)) with a special
set of genes encoding proteins related to the ribosome (L44E,
S27E, aIF-2 alpha, Nop10). This cluster is strongly supported
by a statistical analysis based on the actual distribution of
gene clusters in the set of genomes analyzed in this study, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized regulatory
network coupling DNA replication and translation in
Archaea.

Many putative DNA replication proteins have been identified
in archaeal genomes by similarities with their eukaryotic
counterparts known experimentally to be involved in DNA
replication (for a review, see [20]). Most of these proteins
have now been purified from one or more Archaea and characterized to various extents in vitro (reviewed in [20]). Several examples of physical and/or functional interactions
between archaeal DNA replication proteins have now
emerged from biochemical studies (reviewed in [20]), supporting the idea that these proteins are indeed working
together at the replication fork. A few clusters of genes encoding DNA replication proteins have been previously reported
in Pyrococcus and Sulfolobus genomes [21-24]; in one case,
the gene association correlates with protein physical interaction [24]. This suggests that systematic identification of clusters of genes encoding DNA replication proteins in the
expanding collection of archaeal genomes could identify gene
associations connecting genome organization to functional
interactions of proteins that could be relevant in vivo. More
importantly, comparative genomic analyses could be used to
determine the most significant interactions, that is, those that
appear to be recurrent in the genomes of evolutionarily
diverse Archaea.
Here, we have performed a systematic genome context analysis of genes encoding DNA replication proteins in 27 completely sequenced archaeal genomes. Our results show that a

Systematic identification of DNA replication genes in
archaeal genomes
We have performed an exhaustive search of all known putative DNA replication genes in the 27 archaeal genomes available at the NCBI [25] as of 10 April 2006. These genomes
include 5 genomes of Crenarchaea and 22 genomes of Euryarchaea, and are distributed among 13 different archaeal orders
(Figure 1). Our list of DNA replication genes includes all genes
coding for archaeal proteins or subunits of complexes corresponding to eukaryotic homologs known to be involved in
DNA replication: the initiation factor Cdc6 (Orc1); PolB; the
helicase MCM; the sliding clamp PCNA; the clamp-loader
replication factor C (RFC); the DNA primase; the single-

Phylogeny of the Archaea whose genomes have been analyzed in this study

hypothesis that it likely represents a fast-evolving euryarchaeal lineage [34].

stranded binding protein RPA (or SSB in Crenarchaea); the
DNA ligase; the RNase HII; the flap endonuclease FEN-1; and
the two Gins subunits (Gins15 and Gins23). We have added to
this list PolD (absent from hyperthermophilic Crenarchaea),
since its genes are located close to the replication origin in
Thermococcales [22] and because this enzyme is essential for
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 survival according to recent
genetic data [26]. We have also included in our list the DNA
topoisomerase VI (Topo VI) since this enzyme is the only
DNA topoisomerase known in Archaea that can relax positive
superturns, an essential function for DNA replication [27].
First, the 27 archaeal genomes available at the NCBI were
searched to retrieve the entries of all the annotated DNA replication proteins (see Materials and methods) encoded by
these genomes. Then, systematic BLASTP searches were carried out with several seeds for each protein in order to verify
the annotations and to look for missing proteins (see Materials and methods); Additional data file 1 provides a table list-

ing all putative DNA replication proteins identified and used
in our analysis.
DNA replication proteins are encoded by a set of genes that is
present in all archaeal genomes (sometimes with several paralogues), with the exception of PolD, which is absent in
hyperthermophilic Crenarchaea; Gins23, which has only
been detected in Crenarchaea and Thermococcales; RPA,
which is absent in hyperthermophilic Crenarchaea; and the
crenarchaeal SSB, which is currently restricted to Crenarchaea and Thermoplasmatales. We noticed a few interesting
instances of missing DNA replication genes. In particular, we
and others failed to detect a RPA or a SSB homolog in Pyrobaculum aerophilum [28,29] and this study) and a Cdc6/Orc1
homolog in Methanopyrus kandleri ([30,31] and this study).
On the other hand, we retrieved a Cdc6-like homolog that is
related to the putative origin initiator protein of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [32] in the genome of Methanococcus

maripaludis. Moreover, we detected only one primase gene in
Nanoarchaeum equitans; alignment of the amino acid
sequence of N. equitans primase with other members of the
archaeo-eukaryotic primase superfamily shows that it corresponds to the fusion of the amino-terminal region of the small
subunit with the carboxy-terminal region of the large subunit
[33]. Thus, the primase of N. equitans could be an interesting
model to study the mechanism of action of this protein in
vitro. Finally, the genome of Methanococcoides burtonii does
not harbor any identifiable gene encoding the small non-catalytic subunit of PolD (DP1), whilst the gene encoding the
large catalytic subunit (DP2) is present. It would be of particular interest to get insight into the functional properties of the
M. burtonii PolD to unravel whether or not a core version of
PolD exhibits the expected features, given that the interaction
between the two subunits has been shown to be essential for
full enzymatic activities of the canonical form [21].

bacteriales; the primase genes are fused in N. equitans as previously mentioned (Additional data file 2). The genes
encoding the three subunits of the heterotrimeric RPA found
in Thermococcales (RPA41, RPA32, and RPA14) are clustered
in the four completely sequenced genomes presently known,
whereas the genes encoding RPA homologs present in other
euryarchaeal genomes never associate. Finally, the genes
encoding the two Gins proteins in Crenarchaea and Thermococcales are never adjacent. The tendency for genes encoding
different subunits of DNA replication factors to co-localize is,
therefore, very different from one gene to the other, a first
indication that the observed gene associations are not
random.

Genes encoding subunits of heteromultimeric DNA
replication proteins rarely associate
Several DNA replication factors are formed by the association
of two or more different protein subunits (that is, these DNA
replication factors are heteromultimeric proteins), including
RFC (RFC-s and RFC-l), primase (PriS and PriL), the PolD
holoenzyme (DP1 and DP2), and Topo VI (A and B subunits).
We did not detect any obvious trend of association for the
genes encoding different subunits of heteromultimeric proteins among archaeal genomes, except for the genes encoding
the Topo VI subunits and the genes for the RFC subunits. The
genes encoding the two subunits of Topo VI are contiguous in
all Archaea, except for N. equitans, Methanococcales,
Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Methanopyrus kandleri,
whereas the genes encoding the large and small subunits of
RFC co-localize in Crenarchaea, Thermococcales, Methanobacteriales and M. kandleri (see Additional data file 2 for
illustrations). Interestingly, the genes encoding the two subunits of Topo VI are contiguous to the genes encoding the two
subunits of DNA gyrase (of bacterial origin) in all halophilic
Archaea and in Methanosarcinales, suggesting a co-regulation of the two type II DNA topoisomerases that was selected
after the transfer of the bacterial enzyme into its archaeal
host. The genes encoding the two subunits of PolD are adjacent in Thermococcales only, and those for the two subunits
of DNA primase co-localize in Thermococcales and Methano-

In the course of this work, we noticed that co-localization of
DNA replication genes - encoding different subunits of heteromultimeric proteins (see above) or encoding different proteins (see below) - are more frequent in some genomes than
in others. They are especially rare in N. equitans since all the
gene strings that are conserved in all other archaeal genomes
are disrupted in this archaeon. It is likely that these disruptions are due to extensive genome rearrangements that
occurred in this species because N. equitans is a parasitic
organism that has adapted to its lifestyle by extensive genome
reduction, including the split of several genes [15,34]. At the
other end of the spectrum, we observed that the clustering of
DNA replication genes occurs very frequently in Thermococcales. Indeed, all genes encoding different subunits of heteromultimeric DNA replication proteins are contiguous in this
lineage, except those encoding the two subunits of the
archaeal GINS complex.

Conserved gene clusters suggest functional linkage
between PCNA, DNA primase, GINS, and MCM
Since DNA replication proteins should interact physically
and/or functionally in the replication factory, one can expect
that genes encoding different DNA replication proteins sometimes co-localize in archaeal genomes, as a blueprint for these
interactions. Such DNA replication islands were previously
observed in the vicinity of the Pyrococcus abyssi chromosomal replication origin (oriC), where the gene encoding
Cdc6 lies together with those encoding DP1, DP2, RFC-s, and
RFC-l [22]; and at the cdc6-2 locus in Sulfolobus solfataricus,
where the genes encoding RFC-s, RFC-l, Cdc6-2, Gins23, and

genes that recurrently associate with a particular set of genes in archaeal genomes (for a detailed picture of the genome context of all DNA replication
genes examined in this study see Additional data file 2). (a) The gene encoding Gins15 is linked to the gene coding for PCNA and to the gene for the small

and/or to the gene for the beta subunit of the initiation factor aIF-2 in several archaeal genomes. Orthologous genes are indicated in the same color. Each

MCM are situated [23,24]. We have detected several new
DNA replication islands in our analysis. The association of the
genes encoding PCNA, PriS, and Gins15 (hereafter called the
PPsG cluster), previously observed by others [14,24], is the
most conserved clustering. The full PPsG cluster is not conserved across the entire archaeal domain since the three corresponding genes are adjacent only in crenarchaeal genomes,
but the gene encoding Gins15 is contiguous to either the gene
for PCNA or the gene for PriS in most euryarchaeal genomes,
strongly suggesting that Gins15, PCNA, and PriS functionally
associate (Figure 2a). Hence, the genes encoding Gins15 and
PCNA are direct neighbors in the four Thermococcales, in two
Methanococcales, and in two Methanobacteriales, whereas
the genes encoding Gins15 and PriS are adjacent in Methanosarcinales (four species) and in halophilic Archaea (three
species). Interestingly, while the gene encoding PCNA is an
immediate neighbor of PriS in the PPsG cluster, it co-localizes
with the gene encoding the other primase subunit, PriL, in the
four Methanosarcinales, in A. fulgidus, Haloarcula marismortui, and Halobacterium salinarum (Figure 2b). In summary, the gene encoding Gins15 is associated with the genes
encoding PriS and PCNA (Crenarchaea) or contiguous to one
of these two genes (Euryarchaea), whilst the gene coding for
PCNA is linked either to the gene encoding PriS (Crenarchaea) or to the gene coding for PriL (Euryarchaea) (Figure
2a,b). This suggests that PCNA could interact with the two
primase subunits, whereas Gins15 could interact directly with
PCNA and PriS. Finally, the gene encoding Gins23, which has
been detected only in Crenarchaea and Thermococcales,
neighbors the gene encoding MCM in all these Archaea,
except in P. aerophilum (Figure 2c).

A specific link between PCNA and DNA primase

Altogether, these observations suggest the existence of a core
of DNA replication factors, including the PCNA clamp, the
DNA primase, the GINS complex, and the helicase MCM, that
should be tightly associated with the replication factory during the elongation step of DNA replication. Bell and colleagues [24] have demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis in
yeast and immunoprecipitation that the two Sulfolobus Gins
proteins indeed form a complex that interacts with MCM and
the two subunits of the DNA primase. They have suggested
that this complex could provide a mechanism to couple the
progression of the MCM helicase on the leading strand with
priming events on the lagging strand [24]. Our genome context analysis further suggests that PCNA could interact with
the GINS complex (via Gins15) and with each of the two subunits of the DNA primase. However, no interaction between
PCNA and any of the Gins subunits has been detected by Bell
and colleagues [24]. Similarly, no interaction between PCNA
and the DNA primase has ever been reported in Archaea,
despite the recurrent association of their genes in archaeal
genomes. But, it should be noted that the gene for PCNA and
the gene for PriS are probably co-transcribed [35], thus
strengthening our predictions.

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R71

Berthon et al. R71.6

We noticed that the gene encoding PCNA is often associated
with one or two of the genes coding for the subunits of the
DNA primase. This linking is especially conserved since it
occurs both in the PPsG cluster and in additional contexts.
Hence, the gene for PCNA is adjacent to the gene encoding the
large subunit of the DNA primase in A. fulgidus, M. hungatei,
H. salinarum, H. marismortui, and Methanosarcinales (Figure 2b). Besides the likely association of these two factors at
the replication fork, an interesting hypothesis is that it could
also reflect the involvement of the archaeal primase in DNA
repair, since the PCNA clamp is an accessory factor of many
DNA repair proteins. It has been previously suggested that
archaeal DNA primase may be involved in DNA repair processes as a translesion DNA polymerase, since most archaeal
genomes lack genes encoding DNA polymerases of the X or Y
families, which are the major translesion DNA polymerases in
bacteria or eukaryotes [36]. The DNA primases from Pyrococcus furiosus and S. solfataricus are indeed able to synthesize DNA strands in vitro (reviewed in [36]) and a translesion
synthesis activity has been recently detected in fractions containing the DNA primase in partially purified P. furiosus cell
extracts [37]. Finally, the catalytic site of the archaeal primase
exhibits some structural similarities with the repair DNA
polymerase of the X family (reviewed in [36]). Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate that PCNA contacts the DNA primase
during DNA repair transactions and that the genomic association highlighted in this work is functionally relevant.

Interactions between DNA replication and DNA repair
In the course of this analysis, we detected many genomic
associations of DNA replication genes with genes coding for
archaeal homologs of DNA repair/recombination proteins
from Eukarya (XPF, RadA, RadB, Mre11, Rad50) or from Bacteria (PolX, RecJ, Endo III, Endo IV, Endo V, UvrABC). We
also found associations between genes for DNA replication
proteins and specific archaeal proteins that have been characterized biochemically and predicted to be involved in the
repair of stalled replication forks by recombination/repair
(the helicase Hel308a/Hjm, a RecQ analogue; the nuclease/
helicase Hef; and the Holliday junction resolvase Hjc). All
these observations suggest that several DNA replication proteins are also involved in base excision repair, in nucleotide
excision repair, or in the repair of stalled replication forks.
They are described and discussed in Additional data file 3.

Functional connection of DNA replication,
transcription, and DNA repair processes via the TFS
and NudF proteins?
We observed an unexpected conserved association between
the genes coding for PCNA and TFS. These two genes are
neighbors in both crenarchaeal (P. aerophilum, Aeropyrum
pernix) and euryarchaeal genomes (Thermococcales, Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales) (Figure 2b). In P. aerophilum and A. pernix, the gene coding for TFS is located just
upstream of the PPsG cluster, whereas it forms a cluster with

the genes coding for PCNA and Gins15 in Thermococcales and
Methanobacteriales, and with those encoding PCNA and PriL
in Methanosarcinales (Figure 2b).

workers [2] (the NudF protein is mentioned by the name
'MutT-like' in this article), who proposed a physical interaction between the two proteins using structural modeling data.
The genes encoding NudF and TFS co-localize with those
encoding PCNA and PriL in Methanosarcinales, and with
those encoding PCNA and Gins15 in Methanobacteriales (Figure 2b). Remarkably, in M. kandleri, which does not contain
any TFS homolog, the gene for NudF co-localizes with the
PCNA gene (Figure 2b). All these observations suggest that,
together with TFS, NudF could be associated at the replication forks with the core of proteins previously identified
through the PPsG cluster. The role of NudF could be to hydrolyze damaged nucleotides, in order to prevent their incorporation by DNA or RNA polymerases. However, considering
that NudF is an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase [42], an attractive alternative hypothesis is that NudF participates in a network of activities that regulate DNA replication/repair via
ADP-ribosylation. In eukaryotes, several DNA replication factors, such as PCNA, primase and DNA polymerases, are
indeed poly-ADP-ribosylated in response to DNA damage in
order to prevent transcription or replication of damaged DNA
[43]. Moreover, transient inhibition of DNA replication following DNA damage has been noticed in P. abyssi [44]. In
Archaea, poly-ADP-ribosylation like reactions have been
reported in S. solfataricus, and the chromosomal protein
Sso7d, which is restricted to Sulfolobales, has been identified
as a putative substrate [45]. Interestingly, Sso7d has been
recently shown to promote the repair of thymine dimers in
vitro after photoinduction [46]. If some archaeal proteins
involved in DNA replication or transcription are also inhibited by ADP-ribosylation following DNA damage (something
that has to be tested), the role of NudF could be, once DNA
damage has been repaired, to facilitate replication and/or
transcription restart by metabolizing the free ADP-ribose
released during degradation of ADP-ribose polymers.

In summary, the gene for PCNA is linked to the gene coding
for TFS in 12 out of the 27 analyzed genomes. Although, this
gene pairing is not supported by statistical analyses since two
genes clusters are frequently conserved across genomes
(Additional data file 4), it cannot be a chance occurrence (see
below in the Statistical analyses section). Furthermore, it is
remarkable that these two genes are associated in both crenarchaeal and euryarchaeal genomes representing four different orders. In our opinion, this conservation pattern
indicates that this gene pairing is not coincidental, pointing
towards the existence of cross-talk between replication and
transcription processes and indicating that TFS and PCNA
may be part of this connection. The archaeal protein TFS is
homologous to the carboxy-terminal domain of the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS and to one of the small subunits
of the three eukaryotic RNA polymerases [38]. TFS is also a
functional analogue of the bacterial GreA/GreB proteins.
When an RNA polymerase is blocked by a DNA lesion, all
these proteins can activate an intrinsic 3' to 5' RNase activity
of the RNA polymerase, allowing degradation of the mRNA
and re-initiation of transcription [39]. It has been shown in
vitro that misincorporation of non-templated nucleotide is
reduced in the presence of archaeal TFS and that TFS helps
the elongation complex to bypass a variety of obstacles in
front of transcription forks [39]. One possibility, suggested by
our genome context analysis, is that TFS recruits DNA repair
proteins via PCNA when a DNA replication fork encounters a
transcription fork blocked by a DNA lesion. In agreement
with a direct role of TFS in controlling genome stability, M.
kandleri, which is the only archaeon lacking TFS, exhibits a
high frequency of gene rearrangement (fusion, splitting) and
gene capture, whereas its RNA polymerase has evolved more
rapidly than other archaeal RNA polymerases [40].
Interestingly, the gene coding for TFS co-localizes in several
euryarchaeal genomes with a gene encoding a protein belonging to the Nudix phosphohydrolase superfamily (Nudix
stands for Nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety,
X). Nudix proteins, which are found in the three domains of
life, hydrolyze a wide range of organic pyrophosphates,
including nucleoside di- and triphosphates, dinucleoside
polyphosphate, and nucleotide sugars; some superfamily
members have the ability to degrade damaged nucleotides
(reviewed in [41]). We noticed that the Nudix hydrolase
encoded by the gene that is arranged in tandem with the gene
coding for TFS has been characterized as an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase in M. jannaschii [42]. Therefore, we suggest that
every Nudix gene that is linked to a TFS gene in archaeal
genomes likely encodes a protein with a similar function
(hereafter called NudF protein according to the nomenclature
found in [41]). The clustering between the genes encoding
TFS and NudF was previously noticed by Dandekar and co-

Genomic contexts of the cdc6 gene suggest specific
interactions at the replication origin
Besides the DNA replication genes that belong to the PPsG
cluster, the gene that co-localizes more frequently with other
DNA replication genes is cdc6. Our analysis suggests a loose
connection between the initiator protein Cdc6 and the clamp
loader RFC, the helicase MCM and DNA polymerases (either
B or D), respectively. Hence, the gene encoding Cdc6 is
located in the vicinity of the genes encoding RFC-s1 and RFCl in P. aerophilum; RFC-s in H. salinarum; MCM and DP2 in
M. maripaludis; and DP1 in H. salinarum, H. marismortui,
Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (Additional data file 2). Remarkably, all
these proteins should be recruited at the replication origin for
the initiation of DNA replication. In addition, the genes that
are located in the vicinity of the cdc6 gene in the genomes of
P. aerophilum, Halobacteria and methanogens correspond to
those that form the replication islands of Pyrococcus or Sulfolobus (Additional data file 2). Since the gene encoding Cdc6
is frequently associated with a predicted replication origin

Replication
Replication origin is adjacent to cdc6, and close to gene for DP1 in several euryarchaeal genomes. Orthologous genes are indicated in the same color. Each
gene is denoted by the name of the protein it encodes (see the key at the bottom). The origins of replication (oriC) are shown as bubble-shaped replication
intermediate sketches; solid lines are used when the origin has been identified experimentally, and broken lines are used when the origin has been
predicted with in silico analyses. Species or cell lineages that have the same genomic environment are listed and the number of corresponding genomes is
given in parentheses. White arrows correspond to additional functionally unrelated genes. Genes are not shown to scale.

[22,23,47], co-localization of the cdc6 gene with various DNA
replication genes in the vicinity of oriC could help the recruitment of DNA replication proteins to build new DNA replication factories at the origin of replication. Among the various
gene associations of cdc6 with other DNA replication genes,
the most recurrent is the linkage with the gene encoding the
small subunit of PolD. First noticed in M. thermautotrophicus, P. furiosus and P. horikoshii [48], this association turns
out to be conserved in all Thermococcales, Halobacteriales,
and Methanosarcinales (Figure 3), suggesting that PolD may
be recruited by Cdc6 to oriC via its small subunit DP1. Interestingly, we recently noticed the presence of an origin recognition box (ORB) and mini-ORB repeats in the gene encoding
the DP1 subunit of the four Thermococcales [49]. This suggests that the small subunit of PolD indeed plays a specific
role, which remains to be explored in the initiation of DNA
replication in Euryarchaeota.

Identification of new putative DNA replication
proteins
We hoped that genome context analysis could help to identify
new putative DNA replication proteins in archaeal genomes
via the recurrent association of uncharacterized open reading
frames to genes encoding already known DNA replication
proteins. As previously observed by others [50], and further

confirmed by the present analysis, most euryarchaeal
genomes (that is, Methanosarcinales, Thermoplasmatales,
Halobacteriales, A. fulgidus, M. maripaludis, and M. hungatei) harbor a gene that encodes an OB fold-containing protein without assigned function that is distantly related to the
RPA32 subunit of Thermococcales (COG3390). Interestingly,
in most euryarchaeal genomes, the gene belonging to
COG3390 is arranged in tandem with a gene encoding a
RPA41 homolog (which nearly always contains a Zn-finger
domain) suggesting that the two gene products functionally
associate ([50] and this study; Additional data file 2). Two
copies of this RPA41-COG3390 encoding gene cluster are
present in Methanosarcinales and Halobacteriales, indicating
that the association of the two genes was maintained in both
copies after a duplication event that probably occurred before
the divergence of these two archaeal lineages. It is tempting to
speculate that this RPA32-related protein is a novel singlestranded binding protein that cooperates with RPA in DNA
transactions in some euryarchaea.
Another interesting candidate is a protein that we previously
identified as PACE12 in a list of proteins from Archaea conserved in Eukarya [51]. Interestingly, the gene encoding
PACE12 is located just upstream of the PPsG DNA replication
cluster in all Sulfolobales and of the genes encoding MCM and

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/4/R71

Genome Biology 2008,

Gins23 in the three Pyrococcus species (Figure 2a,c). This
suggests that PACE12 could be involved in the network connecting these two clusters. Furthermore, the gene encoding
the protein PACE12 co-localizes with the gene encoding DP2
in all Thermoplasmatales (they are both transcribed in the
same direction), strengthening the link between PACE12 and
DNA replication (Additional data file 2). The PACE12 protein
has now been identified as the prototype of a new family of
GTPases, the GPN-loop GTPases [52]. Three paralogues of
PACE12 are present in eukaryotes and all of them are essential in yeast [53]. One of the human homologs, the protein
XAB1 (or MBDin), has been shown to be a partner of two proteins: XPA involved in nucleotide excision repair [54] and
MBD2, a component of the MeCP1 large protein complex that
represses transcription of densely methylated genes [55].
Such observations, together with our genomic context analysis, strengthens the idea that these GTPases are involved in
informational mechanisms at the DNA level, possibly related
to DNA replication/repair and conserved from Archaea to
human.

attention given that Nop10 is involved in this process [57,58].
However, the association of genes coding for S27E, L44E,
aIF-2 alpha, and Nop10 is so highly conserved that a link
between these four proteins is to be expected. For instance,
they could participate in a mechanism coupling ribosome biogenesis to translation, but establishing a functional connection would require further evidence. In euryarchaeal
genomes, the gene encoding Nop10 is almost always associated with an additional gene coding for a putative ATPase
with no orthologues in crenarchaea and N. equitans
(COG2047). Therefore, this protein may interact with Nop10,
maybe as a regulator given its predicted function.

Finally, our analysis suggests that the archaeal homologs of
the bacterial primase DnaG may be involved in DNA replication/repair in Archaea since the gene encoding DnaG is adjacent to the gene encoding PolB3 in the three crenarchaeal
lineages investigated and is located in the vicinity of a gene
encoding a RPA in almost all Methanosarcinales (Additional
data file 2). Furthermore, the gene encoding the archaeal
DnaG is located beside the gene encoding PACE12 in Picrophilus torridus. The archaeal DnaG-like protein associates
with archaeal exosome components in S. solfataricus [17] and
in M. thermautotrophicus [56]. It is usually assumed, therefore, that this protein is not involved in archaeal DNA replication, in agreement with the presence in all Archaea of a
eukaryotic-like primase. Our observation nevertheless suggests that DnaG could have diverse roles, one of them being
associated with DNA replication or possibly DNA repair.

Association of DNA replication genes with translation
genes
Surprisingly, we found that the DNA replication genes of the
PPsG cluster (in crenarchaeal genomes) or its subsets (in euryarchaeal genomes) are frequently contiguous to a set of
genes encoding proteins involved in translation. This association forms a supercluster grouping in the same orientation
as the genes of the PPsG cluster and a highly conserved cluster of four genes encoding, in order, the ribosomal proteins
L44E and S27E, the alpha subunit of the initiation factor aIF2, and the protein Nop10 (involved in rRNA processing)
(hereafter called the LSIN cluster). The complete LSIN cluster is conserved in all Crenarchaea and nearly all Euryarchaea
(Figure 4). Surprisingly, despite the nearly systematic conservation of the LSIN cluster in all archaeal lineages, we did not
find any publication reporting a direct link between S27E,
L44E, aIF-2, and Nop10. A genetic study in yeast pointing
toward a role of S27E in rRNA maturation attracted our

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R71

Berthon et al. R71.9

The genes of the PPsG and LSIN clusters are always organized
in the same order and all transcribed in the same direction
(Figure 4). This PPsG-LSIN supercluster is complete in all
Crenarchaea and nearly complete in Methanobacteriales
(with only the gene encoding PriS missing), Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales (with only the gene encoding
PCNA missing). Subsets of the PPsG-LSIN supercluster, still
consisting of an association between DNA replication and
translation protein-encoding genes, are present in M. kandleri (G-LSIN), in Methanococcales (PG-LS) and A. fulgidus
(G-LS). Interestingly, the genes encoding L44E and S27E (LS
cluster) are located close to the gene encoding PolB in Thermococcales, whereas the gene encoding Nop10 (N) is close to
the gene encoding MCM in N. equitans, indicating that the
translation proteins encoded by the genes of the LSIN cluster
are somehow linked to DNA replication (Additional data file
2).
The archaeal translation initiation factor IF-2 is composed of
three subunits, but the three corresponding genes are never
adjacent in archaeal genomes. Since the gene encoding the
alpha subunit belongs to a conserved operon structure grouping genes encoding DNA replication and translation proteins
(Figure 4), we examined the surroundings of the genes encoding the beta and gamma subunits to detect any recurrent gene
pairing. Interestingly, the gene for the beta subunit is also
associated with DNA replication genes in archaeal genomes
since it is adjacent to the gene encoding the replicative helicase MCM (M. kandleri, M. thermautotrophicum) or forms a
cluster together with the genes encoding MCM and Gins23 in
the four Thermococcales (Figure 2c). In contrast, the gene
coding for the gamma subunit is not linked to DNA replication genes (data not shown). The association of the gene
coding for the beta subunit of the initiation factor aIF-2 is not
supported by our numerical analysis (Additional data file 4),
indicating that this gene pairing may not be significant,
although our numerical analysis clearly shows that this association cannot be considered as a chance occurrence (see
below). Furthermore, we believe that the presence of DNA
replication genes in the vicinity of two of the genes encoding
the subunits of the initiation factor aIF-2 is noteworthy. In
eukaryotes, eIF-2 is a major target for protein synthesis regulation since its phosphorylation inhibits translation at the ini-

of the alpha subunit of eIF-2 leads to apoptosis in stress conditions [59]. A recent in vitro study has reported that aIF-2
alpha is phosphorylated in a similar fashion to eIF-2 alpha,
suggesting the existence of a phosphorylation pathway in the

regulation of protein synthesis in Archaea [60]. Our genome
context analysis suggests that aIF-2 may associate with both
MCM and the gene products of the PPsG cluster via its beta
and alpha subunits, respectively (Figures 2c and 4). Given the
homology between the translational processes in Archaea and

Genome Biology 2008,

eukaryotes, we speculate that a/eIF-2 could be involved in a
mechanism that couples the rate of protein synthesis to the
regulation of replication, possibly at the elongation step.
Some of the partners of aIF-2 in this process may be among
the proteins that are encoded by the genes that associate with
the gene coding for aIF-2α in the PPsG-LSIN supercluster.

the former since it might be logical to couple ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication to maintain the balance between
the amount of DNA and proteins in the cell at different times
of the cell cycle. This hypothesis was first proposed by Du and
Stillman [66], who reported in yeast that ORC (origin recognition complex) and MCM associate in a complex with proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis, suggesting potential
links between cell proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and
DNA replication. Actually, mounting evidence in eukaryotes
points toward a link between ribosome biogenesis and the cell
cycle (reviewed in [67]). The existence of a coupling between
DNA replication and translation could also possibly explain
why the MCM protein of the archaeon P. abyssi binds preferentially to the ribosomal operon in stationary phase [49].
Thus, unsuspected links between DNA replication and ribosome biogenesis are emerging piecemeal from biochemical
and genetic studies in Archaea and eukaryotes.

In the course of performing literature mining regarding these
proteins, we focused our attention on S27E since this protein
exhibits various extra-ribosomal functions. In human, the
gene for this ribosomal protein was originally isolated in a
screen for growth factor-induced genes and its product called
metallopanstimulin (MPS-1) because it was identified as a
metalloprotein expressed in a wide spectrum of proliferating
tissues [61]. S27E (MPS-1) is considered as an oncogene and
a potential target for cancer therapy because it is highly
expressed in actively proliferating cells and cancer cell lines
and seems to play a role in progression towards malignancy
[62]. Wang and co-workers [62] have recently shown that
inactivation of MPS-1 inhibits growth and tumorigenesis and
leads to an increase of spontaneous apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. These authors stressed that understanding the
mechanism of action of S27E in tumorigenesis "is of paramount interest in the target design for medical intervention in
malignant tumor formation" [62]. Interestingly, eukaryotic
S27E binds single-stranded as well as double-stranded DNA,
with specific binding to the cyclic-AMP responsive element
sequence [63]. Several data obtained in eukaryotes indeed
suggest that, in addition to its role in the ribosome, S27E may
deal with RNA or DNA transaction processes. Hence, S27A
mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana (S27A is homologous to
archaeal S27E) are impaired in the elimination of damaged
transcripts after a genotoxic stress, suggesting that S27A is
involved in mRNA turnover [64]. Of note, computational
analysis showed that S27A from A. thaliana exhibits a motif
in common with transcriptions factors known to have roles in
DNA repair [64]. Thus, S27E may deal with translation as
well as ribosome biogenesis, transcription, and DNA repair.

Statistical analysis of genome context supports the
cluster of DNA replication and translation genes
In order to evaluate the statistical significance of the various
genes associations that we have detected in this analysis, we
first determined the probability of finding by chance groups
of two, three, and so on contiguous genes in a set of 26 randomly shuffled genomes (starting from the genome of S. acidocaldarius whose size (2,329 genes) is close to the average
size of archaeal genomes). As intuitively expected, we determined that the probability of finding that two neighboring
genes in S. acidocaldarius are still neighbors in any of the 26
randomized S. acidocaldarius genomes is very low (Additional data file 4). For instance, the probabilities of finding
that two neighboring genes are still neighbors in two or three
randomized genomes is 0.23% and 0.04%, respectively.

Two main hypotheses can be put forward to explain the
genomic association of genes encoding proteins involved in
DNA replication and genes coding for proteins involved in
translation. First, replication proteins encoded by the PPsG
cluster or the translation proteins encoded by the LSIN cluster could have evolved a completely new function, thus harboring two different activities, one in translation and another
in replication (moonlighting proteins; for a recent review see
[65]); the same property (for example, nucleic acid binding
ability) could be used to interact with RNA in a ribosome context and to deal with DNA in a chromosome background. The
proteins of the LSIN-PPsG cluster might, therefore, be
involved in both translation and DNA replication, independently of any connection between these two processes. A second hypothesis is that the PPsG-LSIN cluster reflects some
specific regulatory network coupling DNA replication and
translation. The latter hypothesis is more appealing to us than

Accordingly, if two or more genes are located close to each
other in the genomes of more than two different species, this
cannot be by chance. Two alternatives can be proposed to
explain why co-localization of some genes are conserved in
several species: these genes were adjacent in the genome of
the ancestor of these species and have not yet been separated
by chromosome recombination; or there is a selection pressure that favors organisms in which these genes are associated, either by maintaining an association already present in
the ancestor of the two genomes or favoring their recurrent
association. The distribution of gene clusters in present-day
genomes should be the result of a combination of these two
alternatives. One can reason that gene clusters maintained
only by chance (genes not yet separated by recombination)
disappear, on average, more rapidly in the course of evolution
than those maintained by selection pressure. In that case,
clusters under positive selection pressure should be essentially those present in the highest number of genomes. To perform a quantitative analysis that could be amenable to
statistical analysis, we first determined the distribution pattern of gene clusters in our dataset of 27 genomes (see Materials and methods). As shown in Figure 5, we observed that
nearly all two-gene clusters (red bar) are present in more than
two genomes (up to 27), with a very broad distribution, indicating that genes pairs have been significantly conserved during the evolution of archaeal genomes. In contrast, clusters of
three or more genes are much less conserved (most of them
being present in from one to four genomes for triplets (green
bar) and in one to three genomes for longer clusters). We then
calculated a prevalence index based on presence-absence for
all gene clusters analyzed, and determined the cumulative
index frequency curves for clusters of the same size (see Additional data file 4 for a diagram of curves obtained with clusters of two genes and for clusters of more than two genes). In
a traditional statistical approach (one-tailed test), one would
consider that a cluster is significant (under positive selection
pressure) if its index frequency is located in the portion of the
curve corresponding to the 5% less frequent clusters (that is,
the very few clusters present in the highest number of
genomes), thus strongly deviating from the average of the distribution. The index frequency will hereafter be called the frequency score of this particular cluster. This approach is
conservative since it implies that only 5% of the gene clusters
in the complete dataset are the result of functional constraints. However, even within a 5% threshold, we found that
13 of the 32 clusters tested in our statistical analysis were supported. These include the supercluster LSIN-PPsG grouping
DNA replication and translation genes and most clusters
derived from this supercluster (including the PPsG cluster;
Additional data file 4). The supercluster LSIN-PPsG itself is
highly significant since its frequency score is 2%.

genomes of both Euryarchaea and Crenarchaea (so is probably biologically relevant (see below)), its frequency score is
not significant (33%). However, this is also the case for gene
associations whose biological relevance has been validated
experimentally. For instance, the frequency score of the cluster of genes coding for MCM and Gins23 is not significant
(55%) despite the functional relevance of this cluster, as indicated by the work of Bell and colleagues [24]. This again
emphasizes that clusters with frequency scores above the 5%
threshold are a mixture of clusters maintained only by chance
and clusters under selection pressure; there is no easy way to
discriminate between them. The best approximation is to
consider that clusters under selection pressure are those conserved in genomes from species belonging to different
archaeal orders; even more constrained are those conserved
across different phyla.

Many potentially interesting gene clusters detected in our
analysis (in particular most two-gene clusters) are not statistically supported by a 5% standard threshold. For instance,
although the cluster between TFS and PCNA is present in 10

Conclusion

We have identified, through our genome context analysis of
archaeal DNA replication genes, several conserved gene associations that have escaped previous global screening, and
from which new functional connections have been inferred.
Most of these gene clusters are conserved in distantly related
archaeal genomes, indicating that these clusterings are not
merely coincidental but probably functionally relevant, and
that they should be under selection pressure to optimize functional interactions between the encoded proteins (for
instance, via transcriptional co-regulation) and/or to facilitate the formation of specific protein sub-complexes. In particular, we predict that the PCNA clamp, the DNA primase,
and the helicase MCM are functionally connected via the
GINS complex in the replication factory and that Cdc6 may
interact with DP1 at oriC for the initiation of DNA replication.
We also speculate the existence of cross-talk between DNA
replication, DNA repair, and transcription in which PCNA,
TFS, and the ADP-pyrophosphatase NudF may be involved.
Moreover, we suggest that three proteins without clear functional assignations (an OB-fold containing protein, a recently
described new GTPase, DnaG) may take part in informational
processes at the DNA level.
Finally, and unexpectedly, we discovered that the genes coding for a particular set of proteins (Gins15, PCNA and/or PriS)
are almost systematically arranged in an operon-like structure with a conserved cluster of genes coding for ribosomerelated proteins (S27E, L44E, aIF-2α, and Nop10), suggesting the existence of a functional coupling between DNA replication and translation in Archaea. The biological relevance of
this association is strongly supported by a statistical analysis
of the gene cluster distribution in the 27 archaeal genomes of
our dataset. Most of the genes belonging to this particular
cluster have eukaryotic homologs but are absent from bacteria; thus, we anticipate that DNA replication and translation
may be co-regulated by a mechanism conserved from Archaea
to human. The nature of these connections remains to be

address this fundamental issue.

turned out to be of valuable importance to identify the
archaeal Gins homologs that escaped PSI-BLAST searches. A
window encompassing the target gene, the five upstream and
five downstream flanking genes was considered during all the
genomic environment analysis process. The protein encoded
by the genes enclosed in the delimited genomic region were
identified using Genome guts [71], assigned to a COG using
COG guess, and BLASTP searches against the non-redundant
archaeal proteins database were carried out at the NCBI so as
to validate their annotation. The surroundings of DNA replication genes that are located on extrachromosomic elements
were not inspected since the LBMGE genomes database does
not contain archaeal plasmid sequences.

Materials and methods
Identification of DNA replication genes in archaeal
genomes
A list of 12 factors - corresponding to both monomeric and
heteromultimeric proteins - likely to be involved in DNA replication was drawn up. This list contains: the initiation factor
Cdc6/Orc1; PolB1, PolB2, and PolB3; the small and large subunits of PolD (DP1 and DP2); the helicase MCM; the sliding
clamp PCNA; the small and large subunits of the clamploader RFC (RFC-s and RFC-l); the small and large subunits
of the DNA primase (PriS and PriL); the single-stranded
binding protein (RPA or SSB); DNA ligase; the two subunits
of Topo VI (Topo VIA and Topo VIB); RNase HII; the flap
endonuclease FEN-1; and the two Gins subunits (Gins15 and
Gins23) of the GINS complex. The accession numbers of
these proteins or protein subunits were retrieved from 27
complete archaeal genomes (A. pernix; P. aerophilum; the
three Sulfolobales, S. acidocaldarius, S. solfataricus, and S.
tokodaii; N. equitans; A. fulgidus; the three Halobacteriales
H. marismortui, H. salinarum, and Natronomonas
pharaonis; the two Methanobacteriales M. thermautotrophicus and M. stadtmanae; the two Methanococcales M. jannaschii and M. maripaludis; M. kandleri; the four
Methanosarcinales M. burtonii, Methanosarcina acetivorans, M. barkeri, and M. mazei; Methanospirillum hungatei;
the four Thermococcales P. abyssi, P. furiosus, P. horikoshii,
and Thermococcus kodakaraensis; and the three Thermoplasmatales Picrophilus torridus, Thermoplasma acidophilum, and T. volcanium) by means of BLASTP or PSIBLAST [68] performed at the NCBI [25] using P. abyssi and
S. solfataricus homologs and, if available, sequences of biochemically characterized proteins as references. All the proteins of the above list were assigned to clusters of orthologous
groups (COGs) [69,70] using the COG guess tool from the
LBMGE Genomics ToolBox [71] in order to confirm their
annotation. Complete archaeal genomes were searched using
BLASTP for each class of proteins with various seeds as bait
in order to look for misannotated proteins or to uncover overlooked homologs. Finally, BLASTN searches were achieved at
the NCBI against the non-redundant archaeal nucleotide
sequences database to identify missing open reading frames
using closest relative homolog as a query.

Genome context analysis of DNA replication genes
The genomic context of DNA replication genes were visualized with Genomapper. All genomic contexts were scrutinized
manually since the conserved cluster of genes encoding
PCNA, PriS and Gins15 was not detected with an automated
tool such as STRING [72], likely because sequence similarities are weak between Gins protein family members [24]. In
addition, evolutionarily conserved gene neighborhoods

Statistical analyses
Gene cluster conservation in randomized genomes
We chose the S. acidocaldarius genome, whose 2,329 genes
approximate the average gene content in completely
sequenced archaeal genomes, as reference. We generated 26
random genomes as follows: all genes of the S. acidocaldarius
genome were position-exchanged for another gene chosen
randomly from the genome; starting with gene number one
and then sequentially applying the same process to all other
genes. We then counted the number of times clusters of two
to nine genes, present in the genome of S. acidocaldarius,
remained together in the 26 randomized genomes. For all
clusters we calculated a prevalence index based on their presence and absence. That is, every time a gene cluster was
indeed present in a randomized genome the prevalence gene
index gained one point, otherwise it lost one point. This
approach allowed us to calculate the probabilities of having
gene clusters by chance only (data not shown). These probabilities were lower than 0.01%, except for clusters of two or
three genes in two genomes (see text).

Gene cluster conservation in complete archaeal genomes
To establish if the conservation of the gene clusters characterized in this work was statistically significant, we decided to
determine the global gene cluster conservation among the 27
archaeal genomes we used for genome context analysis. A
genome was chosen randomly, and from this genome a gene
was taken randomly. This gene was then BLAST searched (Evalue 0.01) against all other 26 genomes. The same BLAST
search (E-value 0.01) was performed for its two neighboring
genes (the first upstream and the first downstream). Every
time the gene appeared with at least one of the same flanking
genes in another genome, the prevalence gene index gained
one point, otherwise the index lost one point. The whole operation was repeated 10,000 times. We repeated the same process for gene clusters of three to nine genes. We thus ended up
with 10,000 prevalence indexes for each size of gene cluster,
from which we constructed frequency distributions (examples of these distributions can be found in Additional data file
4). At the same time we determined the prevalence indexes of
32 representative clusters containing DNA replication genes
and/or translation genes (indexes are shown in Additional

data file 4). We then performed a one-tailed test to settle the
significance of our clusters; we simply located the prevalence
indexes of our 32 clusters in the frequency distributions (frequency score). The indexes were considered statistically supported when they were present in the 5% or less area of the
right part of the distributions (examples can be found in
Additional data file 4); this area of the distributions contains
those very few clusters highly conserved in archaeal genomes.
