Systematic discovery of unannotated genes in
11 yeast species using a database of orthologous
genomic segments
Seán S ÓhÉigeartaigh, David Armisén, Kevin P Byrne and Kenneth H Wolfe*

Abstract
Background: In standard BLAST searches, no information other than the sequences of the query and the database
entries is considered. However, in situations where two genes from different species have only borderline similarity
in a BLAST search, the discovery that the genes are located within a region of conserved gene order (synteny) can
provide additional evidence that they are orthologs. Thus, for interpreting borderline search results, it would be
useful to know whether the syntenic context of a database hit is similar to that of the query. This principle has
often been used in investigations of particular genes or genomic regions, but to our knowledge it has never been
implemented systematically.
Results: We made use of the synteny information contained in the Yeast Gene Order Browser database for 11
yeast species to carry out a systematic search for protein-coding genes that were overlooked in the original
annotations of one or more yeast genomes but which are syntenic with their orthologs. Such genes tend to have
been overlooked because they are short, highly divergent, or contain introns. The key features of our software called SearchDOGS - are that the database entries are classified into sets of genomic segments that are already
known to be orthologous, and that very weak BLAST hits are retained for further analysis if their genomic location
is similar to that of the query. Using SearchDOGS we identified 595 additional protein-coding genes among the 11
yeast species, including two new genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found additional genes for the mating
pheromone a-factor in six species including Kluyveromyces lactis.
Conclusions: SearchDOGS has proven highly successful for identifying overlooked genes in the yeast genomes.
We anticipate that our approach can be adapted for study of further groups of species, such as bacterial genomes.
More generally, the concept of doing sequence similarity searches against databases to which external information
has been added may prove useful in other settings.

Background
Yeast species have many features that make them an
attractive model system for eukaryotic comparative
genomics. These features include a high level of synteny
conservation and small genome sizes (9-21 Mb) due to
a low content of repetitive DNA and few introns [1,2].
We previously developed an online tool - the Yeast
Gene Order Browser (YGOB) - for comparing local
gene order relationships among species in genera such
as Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Lachancea [3].
YGOB now contains genomic data from 11 species

(Figure 1). Among these species, some form a clade of
descendants from an ancestral whole-genome duplication (WGD) that changed the basal chromosome number from 8 to 16 [4], whereas others diverged before the
WGD occurred. We are unsure what depth of evolutionary time is represented by the species in YGOB, but
when measured in terms of average protein sequence
divergence this group of yeasts is approximately as
diverse as the whole phylum Chordata [5].
YGOB contains ‘pillars’ of homology assignments
across the 11 species. Each pillar can contain up to one
gene from each non-WGD species and up to two genes
from each post-WGD species [3]. The genes in a pillar
are therefore orthologs or (in the case of a post-WGD

species retaining two genes) paralogs resulting from the
WGD. The pillars have undergone several years of manual editing to make them as accurate as possible. YGOB
also contains an ‘Ancestral Genome’, which is the
inferred gene content and gene order of the extinct
ancestor that existed immediately prior to WGD [6].
The gene annotations in YGOB are derived from the
original authors’ annotations of the genome sequence
of each species. In some cases we have ‘switched off’
genes in the original annotation that we believe to be
spurious, but until now we have not added any genes
to the original annotation sets (or to the current Saccharomyces Genome Database [7] annotation for S.
cerevisiae). However, while using YGOB we noticed
many instances in which a particular gene appears to
be missing in a particular species, in a genomic region
that otherwise shows conserved synteny among all the
species. Such loci appear as gaps in the YGOB display.
For the post-WGD species it is quite common for one
of the two paralogs formed by WGD to have been
deleted, but it is more surprising to find genes that are
completely absent (zero copies) in either a non-WGD
or a post-WGD species.
Upon further examination we found that many of
these apparently zero-copy loci are artifacts. When we
examine the relevant DNA region, we find bona fide
genes that were not annotated or were mistakenly
labeled as pseudogenes, even in the case of highly
curated genomes. This is particularly a problem with
short genes of less than 100 codons, highly diverged
genes, and genes containing introns. In some cases, all
genes <100 codons were excluded entirely from the original curators’ annotations due to the difficulty in telling
these apart from spurious ORFs [8,9]. However, current
estimates according to the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (SGD) [10] are that the S. cerevisiae nuclear
genome contains 131 verified ORFs of <100 codons and

Page 2 of 12

even among these, 28 contain introns. Detecting these
‘missing genes’ is important for many reasons, but our
particular interest in this topic is that it would allow the
correct identification of genuine lineage-specific gene
gains and losses which may have evolutionary
significance.
The primary reason why short genes are difficult to
annotate is that they do not generate sufficiently strong
hits (low E-values) in BLAST searches [11]. For instance
the amino acid sequence of ribosomal protein L41 is
nearly identical among all the species in YGOB, but
because this protein is only 25 residues long the
BLASTP E-value between any two Rpl41 sequences is
only of the order of e-07 to e-06. Many annotation pipelines would regard such a hit as insignificant, because Evalues of this magnitude are often obtained purely by
chance when longer query sequences are used. More
generally, any gene whose predicted protein product
cannot generate a significantly strong BLAST score
against its orthologs will tend to remain unannotated.
Weak BLAST scores can be caused by very rapid
sequence divergence [12,13], or a high content of repetitive sequence that is masked by sequence-filter software
[14], as well as by short sequence length.
In this manuscript we describe SearchDOGS, a piece
of software that works in conjunction with BLAST [11]
to identify unannotated genes. It is particularly designed
to find genes that generate only weak BLAST hits, but
whose syntenic context indicates that they are genuine
orthologs to known genes. The major feature of SearchDOGS is that the genomes in the nucleotide sequence
database used in the BLAST search have been pre-processed to subdivide them into sets of genomic regions
that are already known to be orthologous. DOGS is an
acronym for Database of Orthologous Genomic Segments. The BLAST results can then be post-processed
to identify cases, even with very high E-values, where (i)
the query protein hits genomic regions from multiple
species in the database, and these regions are orthologous; or (ii) the syntenic context of the query protein is
known, and it matches that of one or more of the database entries it hits.
SearchDOGS was initially developed as a standalone
tool for displaying the syntenic contexts of the genomic
hits obtained in a TBLASTN search using a single protein query. We then adapted it to carry out an automated and systematic search for unannotated genes in
the genomes of all 11 yeast species in YGOB. Because
the detection of a small or highly-diverged gene in one
species may in turn make it possible to detect further
orthologs of this gene in other species when the first
gene is used as a query, we re-ran successive iterations
of SearchDOGS on the yeast genomes until the program
failed to find any more new genes.

Results
Orthologous genomic segments

The key concept behind SearchDOGS is that the
nucleotide database that is searched by BLAST is organized into sets of sequences called Orthologous Genomic Segments (OGSs). We split up each of the 11 yeast
genome sequences (Figure 1) used in YGOB into overlapping segments. Each segment consists of two adjacent
annotated genes and the intergenic sequence between
them (Figure 2). A BLAST nucleotide database (’DOGS’)
containing all the segments from all 11 species was then
constructed. Separately, we mapped the two genes contained on each segment to the Ancestral yeast genome,
which represents the gene order that existed just prior
to the WGD event [15]. For each interval between two
adjacent genes in the Ancestral genome, we were then
able to identify genomic segments in the 11 modern
species that are orthologous to this interval. A segment
in a modern species can be orthologous to several consecutive intervals of the Ancestral genome due to gene
deletions (Figure 2). Segments that are orthologous to
the same Ancestral interval constitute an OGS group.
SearchDOGS was initially developed as a standalone
program with a web interface http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/
searchDOGS, designed to search a single query protein
against the DOGS database using TBLASTN (Figure
3A). Genomic segments hit in the search are identified
in terms of their OGS groups. A typical protein query
will hit the genomic segments that contain the annotated coding sequences of its orthologs in different species, which will constitute an OGS group. The BLAST

Figure 2 Definition of orthologous genomic segments. The
genome sequences of species 1 and 2 are subdivided into
overlapping regions, each containing two annotated genes and the
intergenic DNA between them. The segments from species 1 and 2
in this example are classified into three orthologous genomic
segment (OGS) groups, as indicated by coloring. Letters A-G
represent genes in the Ancestral genome, some of which are
retained in species 1 and 2.

HSPs (high-scoring pair alignments) of these hits will
occur within the parts of the genomic segment that are
already annotated as protein-coding, rather than the
intergenic DNA between them. However, if in a particular species an ortholog of the query protein exists but
has not been annotated, the DNA coding for it will have
been annotated as intergenic DNA but the genomic segment containing this DNA will be part of the same
OGS group as the orthologs in other species. For example, in Figure 2, if gene D exists in species 2 but has not
been annotated, a TBLASTN search using gene D from
another species as a query will hit an apparently noncoding region of segment 2 from species 2, as well as
hitting coding regions of segments 2 and 3 from species
1. These three segments will all be in the same OGS
group. So, by highlighting TBLASTN hits that occur in
regions of database entries that are supposedly noncoding, we can identify possible unannotated orthologs of
the query. We can consider even very weak hits between
the query and noncoding regions of database entries,
because we can reject any database hits that are not in
the relevant OGS group.
As an example of results from the standalone SearchDOGS application, we found orthologs of the small (70
codons) L. kluyveri gene SAKL0B06622g in eight other
yeast species in which it had not previously been annotated: S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, C. glabrata, Z. rouxii, K.
lactis, A. gossypii, L. thermotolerans and L. waltii, with E
values ranging between 4e-08 and 0.049 (Figure 3A, B).
In each of these noncoding regions an intact open reading frame was found, ranging in length from 61-88
codons, and showing significant amino acid sequence
conservation (Figure 3C). When used as a BLASTP
query the S. cerevisiae ORF, which we named
YBL026W-A, hits SAKL0B06622g with an E value of 6e04, and hits the other ORFs with E values ranging from
4e-21 to 0.009. These ORFs have been added to the
YGOB database as new genes. Analysis of expressed
sequence tag data [16] confirms expression of the newly
identified S. cerevisiae YBL026W-A on the correct strand
(Figure 3D). Prior to this study SAKL0B06622g appeared
to be a species-specific gene in L. kluyveri, with no
homologs annotated in the ten other YGOB species.
These discoveries mean that orthologs of the gene are
now known to exist, at a conserved location, in 9 of the
11 yeast species. We have not been able to find
orthologs in the remaining two species (V. polyspora,
N. castellii).
Automation and cycling

As we began to use the standalone SearchDOGS program, it became clear that due to the large number of
hits and prospective genes being identified it would be
necessary to automate the program to run over entire

genomes. The automated version of SearchDOGS uses a
modification of the original approach for increased
speed and a slight increase in accuracy of synteny identification. The intergenic sequence between the two
annotated genes in each genomic segment is used as a
BLASTX query against a small database consisting only
of the protein sequences of the genes that are syntenic
with the query genomic segment. If a syntenic gene is
hit, the region is retained for further processing. We
retain all BLASTX hits with an E-value lower than 10, a
very liberal cutoff.
We then test whether an intact gene structure with a
protein sequence showing homology to the syntenic
proteins can be identified within the intergenic region of
the genomic segment. We use the program GetORF
from the EMBOSS package [17] to generate a list of
open reading frames located in the intergenic region.
We use the protein translation of each ORF in the list
as a BLASTP query against the syntenic YGOB pillar,
and retain ORFs that hit the expected pillar. As well as
this verification of synteny conservation we also require
several other criteria to be met before an ORF is proposed as a genuine gene (Additional file 1: Figure S1),
such as a comparison of the length of the HSP generated using the protein translation of the ORF as a
BLASTP query against the syntenic pillar relative to the
median length of the genes in that pillar. Finally, all proposed new genes are inspected by eye, considering their
BLASTP results and a T-COFFEE multiple sequence
alignment with other proteins in the pillar, for manual
acceptance or rejection.
We ran a total of six cycles of the automated SearchDOGS program. In each cycle, genes discovered in the
previous cycle were added to the query set. We also
made modifications to the program between the cycles,
to extend the range of situations it could deal with. The
modifications included steps to automatically annotate
intron-containing genes (see Methods), and modification
of the synteny filter to allow unannotated genes to be
detected in regions of genomes that have undergone
rearrangement relative to other species. We also developed a method for dealing with pseudogenes. Pseudogenes are relatively rare in yeast genomes, but a few
dozen have been described in S. cerevisiae and it is likely
that similar numbers exist in other species [18,19]. In
addition, there are many degenerated fragments of
mobile elements such as Ty retroelements in yeast genomes. These pseudogenes are detected by SearchDOGS
but it is not possible to annotate a corresponding intact
gene. To prevent these loci being rediscovered in each
cycle, we flagged them as pseudogene-containing regions
and excluded them from the results of subsequent
SearchDOGS runs.

Automated SearchDOGS results

After six cycles of SearchDOGS we reached the point
where no additional candidate genes were detected. The
cumulative results of the six cycles are summarized in
Table 1.
We added 595 new genes to the YGOB database,
which can be viewed at http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/ygob (version 5: January 2011). A complete list of new genes is
available at http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/searchDOGS. Of
these, the largest proportion (43%) were in S. bayanus,
which is still relatively poorly studied and annotated
[13,20]. However, new genes were discovered in every
species included. We were surprised to find two new
genes in S. cerevisiae and 17 new genes in A. gossypii,
given that these genomes have already been annotated
to a very high standard [10,21]. The two new genes in S.
cerevisiae are YBL026W-A (Figure 3) and Scer_YGOB_Anc_7.495. The latter gene, located between YJR107W
and YJR108W, contains a frameshift in the ‘reference’ S.
cerevisiae genome sequence of strain S288c, but not in
alternative sequences of S288c obtained by Liti et al [22]
and Miura et al [16], nor in sequences from other S. cerevisiae strains. In A. gossypii our results are supported
by a recent resequencing and reannotation project that
independently identified 15 of the 17 genes we discovered using SearchDOGS (Dietrich, F.S. et al, unpublished data. GenBank:AE016819, GenBank:AE016899AE016904). During the course of the study we also
identified a large number of genes across all species that
were in need of modification or removal, due to errors
such as a failure to annotate an intron, or partition of a
single gene into multiple fragments due to frameshifts
(Table 1). For some loci we found that a new gene
could only be annotated in a particular species if apparent sequencing errors were overcome. We took a pragmatic approach to these loci: if a gene appeared to be
intact except for one frameshift site or one internal stop
codon, we annotated it and assumed that the problem
was a sequencing error; if a gene contained more than
one such site, we assumed that it is a pseudogene.
The list of new genes identified using SearchDOGS is
heavily enriched for short genes: 64% of them are <200
codons long, and 38% are <100 codons. Most of them
have yet to be assigned probable functions. By comparison, in the YGOB genome annotations of S. cerevisiae
and C. glabrata, 16-17% of genes are <200 codons, and
3% are <100 codons. The large number of short genes
discovered by SearchDOGS indicates not only that our
approach is highly effective at detecting short genes, but
also that a significant proportion of short genes have
remained undiscovered to date.
For each new gene that we added, we calculated the
ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide

the same YGOB pillar using PAML [23]. In all cases we
found that the ratio was less than 1, indicating natural
selection to preserve the amino acid sequence of the
encoded protein.
Examples of genes discovered by SearchDOGS
Highly divergent genes

The S. cerevisiae gene NTC20, coding for a protein
required for pre-mRNA splicing, originally had orthologs annotated in all species except A. gossypii. SearchDOGS found a syntenic ortholog in A. gossypii, but the
protein sequence divergence between it and the S. cerevisiae ortholog is so large that they do not hit one
another in a BLASTP search (E > 10), which is probably
the reason that the gene was overlooked in the original
A. gossypii annotation [24] even though it is relatively
long (171 codons). SearchDOGS initially found a hit to
this genomic region in A. gossypii by using the Z. rouxii
ortholog (ZYRO0A13266g) as a BLAST query. The A.
gossypii ORF is confirmed as an NTC20 ortholog
because it hits six other proteins from the NTC20
YGOB pillar when used as a BLASTP query. All six of
these hits have very high E-values (ranging from 0.11 to
8.5), and the other four proteins in the pillar must have
E-values greater than 10. NTC20 is an exceptionally
divergent gene: none of the 11 NTC20 orthologs in the
YGOB pillar is able to detect all the other members of
the pillar with a BLASTP E-value below 10.
We also found new orthologs of S. cerevisiae REC107,
an intron-containing gene that is involved in the early
stages of meiotic recombination. At the start of this
study orthologs were only known in the other postWGD species and in A. gossypii. SearchDOGS identified

divergent orthologs of REC107 in all the other nonWGD species (Z. rouxii, K. lactis, L. kluyveri, L. thermotolerans, L. waltii), with BLASTP E-values to the S. cerevisiae protein ranging from 5e-19 to 6e-11.
Genes for a-factor

MFA genes coding for the a-factor mating pheromone
in budding yeasts are known to be difficult to identify
due to their short size (32-38 residues), high sequence
divergence and an apparently high rate of gene duplication or transposition [25]. Using a combination of
SearchDOGS and standard TBLASTN searches we identified ten unannotated MFA genes: three in N. castellii,
two in K. lactis and L. kluyveri, and one each in Z.
rouxii, L. waltii, and L. thermotolerans. A previous study
by Ongay-Larios et al. [26] identified and knocked out
one of the K. lactis MFA genes but did not notice the
second gene.
An analysis of MFA gene locations reveals a complex
history of gene duplication and relocation (Figure 4).
For example N. castellii has five MFA genes, two of
which are a pair formed by WGD and located at a site
that is conserved with most other post-WGD species
and Z. rouxii (Site 1 in Figure 4), but the other three N.
castellii genes are at locations that are not shared with
any other species. Among the 11 species, all but three of
the ten separate genomic sites where MFA genes are
currently located represent new sites to which MFA
moved in the time since the WGD occurred (Figure 4).
Discovery of new divergent ohnolog pairs in S. cerevisiae

In three instances, the discovery of orthologs of S. cerevisiae genes in non-WGD species led us to realize that a
pair of S. cerevisiae genes are ohnologs (paralogs produced by the WGD). The first pair is the S. cerevisiae
genes HOR7 and DDR2 (59 and 61 codons, respectively).

We initially discovered that HOR7 has unannotated syntenic orthologs in the non-WGD species K. lactis,
L. kluyveri and L. waltii, and then found that these nonWGD genes were also syntenic with, and had weak
similarity to, S. cerevisiae DDR2. There is no direct
BLASTP hit between the two S. cerevisiae proteins. The
second pair is similar: S. cerevisiae YDR524C-B (66
codons) and YCL048W-A (79 codons) were found to be
an ohnolog pair, because they are both syntenic with,
and have weak similarity to, a newly discovered gene in
each of L. kluyveri, L. thermotolerans and L. waltii. PSIBLAST searches show that these four small S. cerevisiae
proteins are members of a single family, but their precise function is ill-defined. HOR7 and DDR2 are known
to be upregulated in response to stress. HOR7 is responsive to hyperosmolarity [27] and DDR2 is a member of a
family of multistress-responsive genes [28]. Both HOR7
and YDR524C-B are expressed across a range of conditions, although whereas HOR7 is upregulated in
response to heat shock, YDR524C-B is downregulated.
Both DDR2 and YCL048W-A have low expression in
rich media but are upregulated in response to ethanol
or heat shock [29,30].
The third pair of newly-recognized ohnologs are S.
cerevisiae ABC1 and YBR230W-A [31], a small gene previously identified by McCutcheon and Eddy [31]. SearchDOGS identified that YBR230W-A (which was originally
‘switched off’ in YGOB’s S. cerevisiae annotation) and
ABC1 hit the same genes in non-WGD species. ABC1
and YBR230W-A have an unusual history because they
no longer retain any homologous sequence. After WGD,

the two ohnologs retained only different, non-overlapping
parts of the original gene. Consequently, ABC1 and
YBR230W-A cannot be aligned to one another, but they
both align to parts of a longer gene in non-WGD species
that is orthologous to both of them (Figure 5). S. cerevisiae ABC1 (501 codons) is a large single-exon gene that
corresponds to exon 2 of its orthologs in non-WGD species. YBR230W-A (66 codons) shows high similarity to
exon 1 of the gene in non-WGD species (Figure 5), and
is conserved within the genus Saccharomyces [31]. It
appears that after WGD, one S. cerevisiae gene (ABC1)
lost exon 1 and the other (YBR230W-A) lost exon 2 in a
reciprocal fashion. Thus, these two genes that show no
sequence similarity to each other share a common
ancestor.
The origin of ABC1 and YBR230W-A by fission of an
ancestral gene raises a puzzle about the origin of
ABC1’s mitochondrial import signal. S. cerevisiae Abc1
is a mitochondrial protein that is involved in activation
of the cytochrome bc1 complex and is required for
coenzyme Q biosynthesis [32-34]. It is imported into the
mitochondrion by means of a signal sequence at its
amino terminus. Ybr230w-a and the proteins from nonWGD species are also predicted bioinformatically to be
targeted to mitochondria [35-38]. Since ABC1 did not
retain the 5’ end of the ancestral gene, it must have
gained a new signal sequence upstream of the former
exon 2. It is interesting to note that the N. castellii
ortholog of ABC1 also appears to have lost exon 1, but
there is no evidence that exon 1 exists in the form
of a separate gene in that species. The function of

Figure 5 Alignment of Abc1, Ybr230w-a and orthologous proteins. Only the N-terminal region of Abc1 is shown, and the positions of
introns are marked by <I>. The alignment was made using MUSCLE as implemented in Seaview [47]. The YBR230W-A genes in the
Saccharomyces species (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii and S. carlsbergenesis) align to the first exon of the two-exon ABC1
gene in V. polyspora, Z. rouxii, A. gossypii, L. kluyveri, L. thermotolerans and L. waltii whereas ABC1 of S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus and N. castellii align
only to the second exon.

YBR230W-A is unknown, but transcriptome data indicates that both ABC1 and YBR230W-A are expressed
[29], and that expression of YBR230W-A is upregulated
under heatshock conditions [30].

Discussion
The principle underlying SearchDOGS is one that is
familiar and intuitive - that orthologous genes should be
located in orthologous genomic regions. For the yeast
species considered here, this principle turns out to be
useful for gene discovery, because their genomes have
undergone relatively little gene order change while accumulating extensive gene sequence divergence [39]. The
idea that two orthologous genes can diverge so much in
sequence that they fail to hit each other in a BLAST
search is somewhat unsettling, and we were surprised
when we encountered the first examples of this phenomenon [12]. We can now quantify the phenomenon
more precisely as follows. In our YGOB database there
are 5108 pillars that contain at least two genes. Among
these, 135 pillars (2.6%) contain at least two genes that
do not hit each other at all, despite being orthologous
(BLASTP search, E > 10, Blosum62 matrix, merging hits
seen both with and without the SEG low-complexity filter). The orthology of these genes has been confirmed
via hits to a third sequence in the same pillar, or via
longer chains of hits [40].
Most annotation pipelines will only annotate a putative gene if it has significant similarity to another gene
in a database, or if it has an ORF above a certain length
threshold. Therefore it is not surprising that short,

intron-containing, and highly-divergent genes tend to
have been overlooked by the annotation process. SearchDOGS provides a method for finding these genes. In the
near future it will probably also become possible to
detect them using high-throughput transcription data
such as RNA-seq [41], but at the moment we have
many genome sequences from species whose transcriptomes remain unstudied. Also, RNA-seq data establishes
that a locus is transcribed, but does not identify its
orthologs in other species.
Although the principle behind our method is simple,
to our knowledge SearchDOGS is the first attempt to
apply this principle in a systematic and automated way.
As well as the obvious advantage of speed, the automated approach has the additional advantage of robustness because it often finds multiple lines of evidence for
the existence of the same gene. For example a Z. rouxii
ortholog of YPR036W-A was detected in the intergenic
region between ZYRO0G17248g and ZYRO0G17270g
when it hit the S. cerevisiae protein in a search, but the
same intergenic region also hit the orthologs of
YPR036W-A from V. polyspora, N. castellii, and A. gossypii. In this way, searches using different members of
the same pillar can back each other up, lending confidence to the predictions.
The only substantial problem we encountered using
SearchDOGS was the difficulty of differentiating pseudogenes from unannotated but genuine genes. This is a
particular problem for sequences that contain large
ORFs but are nevertheless truncated relative to their
orthologs in other species. Without experimental

ÓhÉigeartaigh et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:377
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/377

verification it will be difficult to distinguish between a
functional gene that is shorter than its orthologs and a
truncated pseudogene. Furthermore, the sequenced
strain of a species may contain null alleles at some loci.
These are loci at which the population is polymorphic
with a mixture of functional and nonfunctional alleles.
For instance, the CRS5 gene contains an in-frame stop
codon in S. cerevisiae strain S288c but not in other
strains [42]. Without information from other strains it is
impossible to distinguish between a null allele and a
pseudogene that is fixed in the population.
One limitation of SearchDOGS is that, to find an
unannotated gene, it must use a gene currently annotated in another species as a query. Therefore it cannot
find completely novel genes that are not annotated in
any species. We tried to overcome this limitation by
using TBLASTX searches (six-frame translations of a
query DNA sequence compared to six-frame translations of the database) after the six cycles of automated
TBLASTN/BLASTX searches were finished. However,
this approach generated a very large number of spurious
hits (attributable to translations of sequences such as
retrotransposon LTRs and RNA-coding genes), and we
did not find any genuine additional genes in the 11
yeast species using it.

Conclusions
We have successfully used SearchDOGS to identify a large
number of genes previously overlooked in the genomes
included in YGOB. The principle of using local gene order
information to inform searches for unannotated genes is
completely generic so in principle the SearchDOGS
method could be applied to many groups of organisms,
although in its current implementation - without sophisticated gene structure modeling - it is best suited to species
with few or no introns. The broad requirements for a
SearchDOGS approach to be viable are as follows:
(i) The species must already be reasonably well
annotated. SearchDOGS will find missing genes, but
if the majority of genes in a species are missing
SearchDOGS will have difficulty pinpointing the
locations of new genes relative to those already
identified.
(ii) The species in the dataset must not be too rearranged. SearchDOGS can only make predictions in
regions of the genome where it can establish local
synteny relationships.
(iii) A pillar structure (i.e., homology assignments for
the genes) must exist or be generated. In our implementation we classified the genomic segments from
each yeast species into orthologous groups (OGSs)
by mapping them onto an Ancestral yeast gene
order that we had previously determined [15]. For

Page 9 of 12

SearchDOGS to be applied to other systems, the
user would need to nominate one genome as a reference onto which the OGS groups would be mapped.
Based on these requirements, we anticipate that
SearchDOGS may prove useful in the future for finding
unannotated genes in bacterial genomes, but it may be
less useful in genomes with many introns and large noncoding regions, such as mammals, or in species that lack
close relatives with well-annotated genomes.

Methods
Database and search method

The DOGS database was constructed using the genome
sequence and gene annotations in the YGOB browser,
data release 4 (May 2010) [3], which includes 11 species
(Table 2). The Ancestral yeast gene order is from Gordon et al. [6]. For the standalone version of SearchDOGS we constructed a single nucleotide database
containing all the genomic segments. This database can
be searched using either TBLASTN or TBLASTX. For
the early automated cycles of the program, the amino
acid sequence of each protein in the YGOB database
was used as a TBLASTN query against syntenic genomic segments. To reduce computation time we constructed a specific small database for use with each
pillar’s queries, containing only the genomic segments
that are syntenic to it. The TBLASTN searches used
cutoffs of E < 10 and 100 results listed, with the lowcomplexity SEG filter turned off. Hits to noncoding
regions syntenic with the query protein were retained.
As subsequent iterations of SearchDOGS were run,
modifications were made to improve the initial syntenydetermining method, and to improve speed by using
BLASTX instead of TBLASTN. The final method for
establishing synteny is as follows: For each genomic segment the pillars containing the flanking genes are
retrieved. This information is used to map the intergenic
region against the other species in YGOB. If no rearrangement has occurred between a given species and the
species of the query, all the genes in that species between
the flanking pillars are retrieved, making up a database
against which the intergenic region of the genomic segment is searched (BLASTX) (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
Otherwise we ‘step out’ from one flanking pillar towards
the other, retaining each gene until we reach a gene for
which pillar information shows that synteny with the
intergenic sequence has been lost, or up to a maximum
of 10 genes from the pillar (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
Intron and frameshift prediction

Open reading frames within the regions of interest identified by SearchDOGS are obtained using GetORF with
default parameters [17] except that the minimum ORF

size is 60 nucleotides (start to stop). The set of ORFs generated by GetORF are subjected to a first step of analysis
using BLASTP, as described in the Results. This step identifies coding regions that are free of frameshifts and consist
of a single exon (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Next, results
are subjected to a second step of analysis designed to identify genes containing frameshifts or introns. In this step we
look for pillars of genes that map to the intergenic region
of the genomic fragment in which a BLAST hit has been
found. If a potential ORF within the intergenic region contains a single frameshift that can be corrected to translate
to a protein similar to other genes in the homologous pillar, it is considered real and is corrected. The location of
the frameshift is an estimate, and therefore the ORF is
flagged for manual verification.
We anticipate that a newly discovered gene might contain an intron if one or more of the genes in the YGOB
pillar that hits it contains an annotated intron. In the
case of pillars of genes containing introns, TBLASTN is
used to search the protein sequence of each of the exons
of the genes in these pillars against the intergenic region
of the fragment to define potential exons within the fragment. If two or more potential ORFs have the same
order as the exons of any genes in the syntenic pillar,
and if the lengths of the ORFs are within 10 amino acids
of the lengths of the exons in the pillar, an intron is predicted and we search for splice sites (GT-AG) associated
with the boundaries of the intron. No frameshifts are
allowed when an intron is predicted. If the TBLASTN
hits do not include start and stop codons, an enlargement
of the coding region of up to 40 amino acids is allowed
until start and stop codons are reached. The final protein
length is tested against the median protein length of the
homologous pillar for a measure of prediction confidence.
Exons smaller than 20 codons are difficult to identify by
BLAST, so if a pillar that generates a hit contains a small
exon, only the larger exon(s) are usually detected in a
TBLASTN search, and therefore the hit is flagged for
manual annotation.

New genes identified using SearchDOGS were added
to the YGOB database and given temporary names containing the tag ‘YGOB’ such as Zrou_YGOB_Anc_5.606
to indicate a Z. rouxii ortholog of the gene at ancestral
position Anc_5.606 [15]. We will communicate lists of
these loci to the relevant databases so that permanent
names can be assigned to them.
Criteria for rejection of hits

A BLASTX hit between a genomic segment and a protein from an orthologous YGOB pillar could be rejected,
either automatically (Additional file 1: Figure S1) or
after manual inspection. The most common reasons
why hits between a genomic segment and an orthologous protein were rejected were:
- Segments did not contain an intact ORF, due to
multiple stop codons and/or frameshifts. These were
classed as pseudogenes.
- BLAST relationship was not reciprocal: the intergenic sequence of a genomic segment had a BLASTX
hit to a protein in an orthologous YGOB pillar, but
when the translated ORF from the genomic segment is
used as a BLASTP query it failed to hit any of the proteins in the same pillar.
- The length of the HSP generated by the BLASTP
search was not sufficiently long compared to the median
length of the genes in the corresponding YGOB pillar.
- The translated ORF showed too little sequence similarity to existing genes in the pillar in a subjective
inspection of a T-coffee alignment [43], and were therefore considered unlikely to be real.
- Segments syntenic to intron-containing pillars, for
which we were unable to construct a convincing gene
model.
