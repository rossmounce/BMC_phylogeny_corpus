Unresolved orthology and peculiar coding
sequence properties of lamprey genes: the
KCNA gene family as test case
Huan Qiu1,3, Falk Hildebrand1,4, Shigehiro Kuraku1,2* and Axel Meyer1,2

Abstract
Background: In understanding the evolutionary process of vertebrates, cyclostomes (hagfishes and lamprey)
occupy crucial positions. Resolving molecular phylogenetic relationships of cyclostome genes with gnathostomes
(jawed vertebrates) genes is indispensable in deciphering both the species tree and gene trees. However,
molecular phylogenetic analyses, especially those including lamprey genes, have produced highly discordant
results between gene families. To efficiently scrutinize this problem using partial genome assemblies of early
vertebrates, we focused on the potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related (KCNA) family, whose members are
mostly single-exon.
Results: Seven sea lamprey KCNA genes as well as six elephant shark genes were identified, and their orthologies
to bony vertebrate subgroups were assessed. In contrast to robustly supported orthology of the elephant shark
genes to gnathostome subgroups, clear orthology of any sea lamprey gene could not be established. Notably, sea
lamprey KCNA sequences displayed unique codon usage pattern and amino acid composition, probably associated
with exceptionally high GC-content in their coding regions. This lamprey-specific property of coding sequences
was also observed generally for genes outside this gene family.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that secondary modifications of sequence properties unique to the lamprey
lineage may be one of the factors preventing robust orthology assessments of lamprey genes, which deserves
further genome-wide validation. The lamprey lineage-specific alteration of protein-coding sequence properties
needs to be taken into consideration in tackling the key questions about early vertebrate evolution.

Background
For a complete understanding of the evolution of vertebrates, jawless fishes (cyclostomes; hagfishes and lampreys) occupy crucial positions as the most earlybranching lineages, which diverged more than 500 million years ago from the gnathostome (jawed vertebrate)
lineage [1]. Their phylogenetic relationships with
gnathostomes serve as a crucial scaffold on which one
can map phenotypic and genotypic changes [2,3]. More
importantly, genome expansions, known as ‘two-round
whole genome duplications (2R-WGDs)’, took place
around the divergences of these lineages [4,5].

It has recently been shown that the 2R-WGDs
occurred in the stem lineage leading to vertebrates after
the splits of the cephalochordate and urochordate
lineages [6] before the chondrichthyan lineage branched
off [7]. Recently, a scenario in which both WGDs
occurred before the cyclostome-gnathostome split was
suggested [4]. However, there are many gene families
that do not conform to the expected tree topology in
phylogeny reconstructions. Often phylogenetic studies
recover basal divergences and exclusive groupings of
lamprey sequences with long branches (Figure 1A; see
refs [8-14] for examples). This feature, observed commonly among different gene families, has also been
interpreted as in support of lamprey lineage-specific
genome duplication [15]. It would appear that methodological biases add to the difficulty in reconstructing the
molecular phylogenies, originating from possible

Figure 1 Alternative tree toplogies supporting different
timings of two-round whole genome duplications (2R-WGDs).
As an example, for a gene family with three gnathostome paralogs
and three lamprey paralogs, gene trees (top) and species trees with
timings of gene duplications (bottom) are shown. Gene duplications
that gave rise to multiple gnathostome paralogs are indicated with
grey diamond (top) and grey arrows (bottom), and those in the
lamprey lineage are indicated with black diamond (top) and black
arrows (bottom). Even though a recent large-scale phylogenetic
analysis supported the scenario in B [4], analyses on single gene
families often result in the tree topology similar to that in A. C was
previously supported [49]. Abbreviations: Gna., gnathostome gene;

peculiar features of lamprey sequences, which might be
preventing proper reconstructions of gene family trees.
To reveal possible peculiar features of lamprey proteincoding sequences, we focused on the potassium voltagegated channel, shaker-related subfamily (KCNA) [16].
Members of this gene family are mostly single-exon
genes. Thus, they are particularly ideal candidate genes
for this type of analysis involving partial genome
sequences that are available for the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and the elephant shark (Callorhinchus
milii). In tetrapods, the KCNA family comprises eight
genes, six of which form two tri-gene clusters that were
established by tandem duplications followed by a chromosomal duplication (Figure 2) [17]. This chromosomal
duplication is thought to be part of the 2R-WGDs [17]. It
is of interest to assess orthology of lamprey genes based
on the available genome assembly in this already established evolutionary framework of the KCNA gene family.
In this study, we identified KCNA genes from partial
genome sequences of the sea lamprey and the elephant
shark, and investigated their phylogeny and sequence
properties. We observed exclusive clustering of lamprey
sequences with long branches as in Figure 1A. The supported tree topology did not fit any of possible scenarios
supported by the evolutionary pattern of the KCNA
gene family documented previously. Notably, our analyses on KCNA and other genes revealed peculiar codon
usage bias and amino acid composition unique to the
sea lamprey.

Figure 2 Proposed scenario for the evolution of KCNA genes
and clusters in vertebrates. Names of genes are indicated inside
or below boxes showing KCNA genes. In the human genome, there
are eight KCNA genes, six of which form two tri-gene clusters
(KCNA6-1-5 and KCNA3-2-10). The human KCNA clusters are
positioned on chromosomes 1 (KCNA6-1-5) and 12 (3-2-10). Except
for KCNA7, which has one intron, all vertebrate KCNA genes
identified so far are intronless. The status with a single tri-gene
cluster is hypothetical.

Results
Identification of sea lamprey and elephant shark KCNA
genes

Seven full-length or nearly full-length KCNA proteincoding sequences were identified in the sea lamprey
(Petromyzon marinus) whole genome assembly. We also
identified six in the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii),
one in Ciona savignyi and one in purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). For Ciona intestinalis, in
addition to one previously reported KCNA homolog
(XP_002125274.1), one more KCNA protein sequence
was found in Genbank (Additional file 1, Figure S1).
Apart from the seven aforementioned KCNA genes, six
and three fragments of KCNA genes (encoding < 150
amino acids peptides) were also discovered in the sea
lamprey and elephant shark genome, respectively (data
not shown). These remain partial probably because of
incomplete genome sequencing, and they were therefore
excluded from the subsequent analyses. Our search in
NCBI dbEST, an expressed sequence tag (EST) archive,
identified no sequences encoding KCNA proteins for
species in Petromyzontiformes (lampreys), Myxiniformes
(hagfishes) and Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis: an overview

Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the maximumlikelihood (ML) method and Bayesian inference for 32
KCNA sequences, including all of the newly identified

Qiu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:325
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/325

putative KCNA sequences mentioned above (Additional
file 1, Figure S1). We used human homologs of closely
related potassium channel subfamilies as an outgroup.
The sea lamprey PmKCNAb gene was not included
because it was partial and thus largely reduced the number of aligned sites available for tree construction.
Although the best tree topologies produced by these
two methods differed to some extent, all the identified
sequences appeared to be genuine KCNA homologs as
they formed a cluster with already reported KCNA
genes with high statistical support [bootstrap probability
(BP): 89; posterior probability (PP): 1.00; Additional file
2, Figure S2].
The tree focusing on the vertebrate KCNA genes was
reconstructed with the ML (Figure 3) and Bayesian
inference methods (Additional file 3, Figure S3). This
analysis included six sea lamprey KCNA genes and
complete or nearly complete sets of KCNA sequences
of three tetrapods (human, chicken and frog), one
non-teleost actinopterygian fish (Florida gar), and one
cartilaginous fish (elephant shark), and employed sea
urchin and sea squirt homologs as an outgroup (Figure
3). The sea lamprey PmKCNAν was excluded because
of its extremely divergent sequence among the deuterostome KCNA genes (Additional file 2, Figure S2).
Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference supported
tree topologies similar to that of a previous study, in
terms of relationships between gnathostome KCNA
subgroups [17]. In this tree, monophylies of all individual gnathostome KCNA subgroups (KCNA1-7 and 10)
were strongly supported (BP: 67-99; PP: 0.91-1.00).
However, instead of grouping KCNA5 and -10, which
was suggested by the previously proposed evolutionary
history of the KCNA clusters [17], a sister group relationship between KCNA10 and KCNA1-6 was supported by the ML tree (Figure 3). This might be due
to the accelerated evolution of KCNA10 after the split
between KCNA5 and -10 [17] and shorter alignment
[203 amino acid sites (aa)] used in this analysis than in
the previous one (364 aa) [17].
All elephant shark KCNA genes were relatively
robustly placed in the phylogenetic trees (Figure 3), in
accordance with its phylogenetic position in the species tree. In contrast, none of the sea lamprey KCNA
genes was unambiguously assigned to any of the jawed
vertebrate KCNA subgroups (Figure 3). Although sister
relationships between PmKCNAa/b and KCNA10 as
well as between PmKCNAδ/ε/ζ and KCNA4 were
recovered by both methods, statistical support for
these relationships were not high (BP: 11~59; PP:
0.39~0.97). Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference methods with different models, e.g, JTT+Γ4, JTT
+I+Γ 4 +F and LG+I+Γ 4 , LG+I+Γ 4 +F produced similar
results (data not shown).

Timings of gene duplications in the KCNA gene family

The timing of KCNA cluster duplication relative to the
WGDs was investigated by comparing the probabilities
of scenario I and II (Figure 4), and probabilistic counts
of gene duplications (see Methods). Of the seven sea
lamprey KCNA genes, three (PmKCNAa, -b and -ν) had
higher probabilities for scenario II than for scenario I.
One gene (PmKCNAζ) produced comparable probabilities between scenario I and II, and the remaining three
genes (PmKCNAg, -δ and -ε) had higher probabilities for
scenario I (Table 1). This approach did not provide
unequivocal support for either of scenario I or II. Probabilistic counts of gene duplications (see Methods)
resulted in Nbef ranged from 2.9 to 6.8 and Naft from 0.2
to 4.0. Except for PmKCNAg, Nbef showed higher values
than Naft for all the sea lamprey KCNA genes surveyed
(Table 1).
Amino acid composition of KCNA genes

To scrutinize sources of ambiguity in lamprey gene phylogeny, amino acid compositions in KCNA genes were
investigated using correspondence analysis (CA) to identify factors underlying the cross-species variances among
the data (Figure 5A). CA summarizes multi-dimensional
variables among a dataset into a lower number of variables and thereby facilitates the identification of major
sources of variations that explain most of the variance
among the data. Through this approach, we identified
two major axes that account for 66.9% and 22.8% of
total variance of amino acid composition in reliably
aligned regions, respectively. Sea lamprey resided far
from the jawed vertebrates along both axes (Figure 5A).
Two compact clusters were observed within gnathostomes, with the first being exclusively composed of
mammals and the other of non-mammalian gnathostomes (Figure 5A). An analysis based on the full length
of KCNA sequences with the same set of species produced similar results (data not shown).
We performed the CA of amino acid compositions in
genome-wide sequences data of 15 vertebrate species (Figure 5B; see Methods for details of the dataset for the sea
lamprey). The identified first two axes accounted for
63.3% and 21.6% of total variance, respectively. Whereas
teleost fishes were located with tetrapods along the first
axis (CA1), mammals and chicken were distinguishable
from the other vertebrates along the second axis (CA2)
(Figure 5B). Contrary to the elephant shark signature that
was similar to those of osteichthyes, the sea lamprey was
located at an extremely distant position away from the
cluster of other species along both axes (Figure 5B). GCcontent has been shown to be the major determinant of
amino acid composition and codon usage bias, for example, in bacteria [18] and nematodes [19,20]. Thus, we
plotted the first factor of CA of amino acid composition

(CA1) against the average GC-content of third positions in
protein-coding regions (GC3) of the corresponding coding
nucleotide sequence data (Figure 5C). A strong correlation
was observed between these two factors (Figure 5C).
Synonymous codon usage of KCNA genes

We also focused on possible peculiarity in nucleotide
sequences of the lamprey. The overall codon usage bias
of each sea lamprey gene was estimated with Effective
number of codons index (ENc) [21] as measure (see
Methods). The higher ENc values represent greater
degree of deviation from the assumption of unbiased

codon usage. While sea lamprey genes showed a broad
range of ENc, most genes had GC 3 that ranged from
50% to 90% (Figure 6A). The plot of ENc and GC 3
showed that the distribution of ENc values was close to
the expected values, if no translational selection (or
other biases) are acting upon the sequence (Figure 6A).
In the factor map crossing the first two axes (accounting
for 31% and 7% of total variance, respectively) of withingroup correspondence analysis (WCA) of codon usage
[22,23], lamprey genes generally displayed a uniform
pattern of codon usage (Figure 6B). The first factor of
the within-group correspondence analysis (CA1) was

strongly correlated with GC 3 values of sea lamprey
genes (Figure 6C). No correlation was observed between
the second factor of WCA and GC3 (data not shown).
In all of the above plots, the seven sea lamprey KCNA
genes were broadly scattered within the distribution of
all genes, indicating that there were no special features
unique to the KCNA gene family.
To compare codon usage biases across species, the
ENc was calculated using the available sea lamprey coding sequence dataset as well as 14 other representative
vertebrates (see Methods). The lowest value of ENc
(indicating the most pronounced codon usage bias) was
observed for sea lamprey (ENc: 42.41), followed by stickleback (ENc: 48.62) and Tetraodon nigroviridis (ENc:
49.11). The ENc values were highly correlated with genome-wide average coding nucleotide GC levels (Figure
6D). The genome-wide GC3 is also strongly correlated
with average coding GC levels across the species studied
(R 2 = = = 96.4%, data not shown). To compare the
codon usage pattern of the sea lamprey with those of
other vertebrate species, correspondence analysis of

codon usage was performed. In the factorial map of the
WCA of codon usage, with the first two axes accounting
for 84% and 8% of total variance respectively, the sea
lamprey was clearly located apart from other vertebrates
along the first axis, but not second axis (Figure 6E). A
strong correlation was found between the first factor of
CA and GC 3 values in all vertebrates surveyed here
(Figure 6F). Correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (CA-RSCU) generated similar
results to WCA (data not shown). Furthermore, the
overall codon usage in the available sea lamprey coding
sequence dataset and genome-wide coding nucleotide
sequences for other species were tabulated (Figure 7).
Sea lamprey displayed a similar pattern of preference in
codon usage to those of other species. However, for
most amino acids it showed either the highest or the
lowest frequencies for the preferred and non-preferred
codons. Overall, the sea lamprey tends to have higher
frequencies for GC-rich codons and lower frequencies
for GC-poor ones compared to other species (Figure 7).

Discussion
Gene repertoires in early vertebrates

Although the genome assemblies for sea lamprey and
elephant shark are incomplete, the numbers of KCNA
genes identified in the present study (seven for the sea
lamprey and six for the elephant shark) are close to the
number of KCNA paralogs in bony vertebrates (eight in
non-teleost fishes). Previously, Grus and Zhang assessed
the coverage of the available sea lamprey genome
assembly, and suggested that at least one exon per
multi-exon gene should be identifiable in the current
lamprey genome assembly [24]. However, the possibility
of missing a KCNA gene cannot be ruled out given the
single-exon nature of members of this gene family.
Since the elephant shark genome was so far sequenced

only with 1.4-fold coverage, more genes, such as KCNA4
and -7, may still remain to be discovered.
Timing of whole genome duplications

We observed the ambiguity of the phylogenetic positions of the sea lamprey KCNA genes in conventional
best tree searches (Figure 3) as well as in the likelihoodbased tree topology tests that resulted in multiple tree
topologies with similar likelihood values (Additional file
4, Table S1). In terms of the timing of the duplication
of two KCNA clusters, phylogeny-based probabilistic
analysis did not provide strong evidence, although probabilistic counts of individual gene duplications slightly
favored the scenario with the cluster duplication before
the cyclostome-gnathostome split (Table 1). The currently available sea lamprey genome assembly does not
contain any intact KCNA gene cluster, probably because
of its fragmental nature. If lampreys possess two intact
KCNA tri-gene clusters, that would be robust support
for the cluster duplication before the split between
cyclostomes and gnathostomes. Addition of more
sequences for different cyclostome lineages (e.g., southern hemisphere lampreys or hagfish) might also provide
more evidence.
Unique characters of sea lamprey genes: genome-wide
phenomena?

We detected a peculiar amino acid composition in the
sea lamprey KCNA genes (Figure 5A). Notably, this
trend is not confined to the KCNA gene family: the
peculiar protein-coding sequence properties, namely

GC3, codon usage and amino acid composition seem to
be genome-wide features (Figures 5B, 6D-E and 7).
In bacteria [18,25,26] and nematodes [20], the global
GC-content is the major factor governing variations in
amino acid composition of their genes. Based on our
analysis, this appears to apply to vertebrates including
the sea lamprey as well: the relative positions of species
along the first factor of the correspondence analysis
(CA) of amino acid composition were strongly correlated with their GC3 values rather than the evolutionary
distances among them (Figure 5C). Other factors than
GC-content apparently seem to contribute to the difference in amino acid compositions, since the first factor
of the CA only accounted for ~63% of the total variance
in amino acid composition (Figure 5B).
Sea lamprey genes show a strong correlation between
codon usage bias, measured by ENc, and GC 3 (Figure
6A), and its distribution suggests only weak selection on
the codon usage in the sea lamprey genome (see
Results). In contrast, GC3 only accounted for ~1/3 of
total variance of codon usage pattern among sea lamprey genes (see Results), indicating that the codon usage
patterns of sea lamprey genes are further affected by
other factors. Variation of codon usage bias between
vertebrate species was also mainly due to the GC-content as indicated by a strong correlation between ENc
and GC 3 and between the first factor of the CA of
codon usage pattern and GC 3 (Figure 6D and 6F).
Above all, the sea lamprey exhibited an exceptionally
high degree of codon usage bias among the vertebrates
analyzed in the present study as it displayed the most

Qiu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:325
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/325

extreme GC3 by far (Figure 6D). It is unknown whether
the deviated amino acid composition and codon usage
bias in the sea lamprey represents an ancient feature of
the common vertebrate ancestor or is a derived feature
acquired uniquely in the lamprey lineage. To address
this question, it will be necessary to collect data from
other lamprey species (e.g., southern hemisphere lampreys) and hagfishes.
What is the biological significance of GC partitioning
between coding and non-coding regions?

The peculiarity of the codon usage in the sea lamprey
relative to that of other vertebrates draws a parallel in
its variation among Drosophila species. An exceptionally
low level of codon usage bias was observed in Drosophila willistoni compared to eleven other Drosophila
species, which is related to the exceptionally low coding
GC-content in this species [27]. Based on the estimate
of the divergence time between D. willistoni and the
melanogster/obscura groups, this change is estimated to
have occurred within 45-30 million years [28]. In this
case, changes in population size, mutational bias and
tRNA abundance have been proposed as causal factors
(discussed in [27]). These factors might also be associated with the peculiar codon usage in the sea lamprey.
One possible discrepancy in these biases between the
sea lamprey and other vertebrates is the inherent nature
of GC 3 . In vertebrates other than the lamprey, GC 3 ,
mentioned above as a source of biases in codon usage
and amino acid composition (Figures 5C and 6D), is
correlated with global genomic GC-content [29-32]. In
lampreys, however, genomic sequences generally exhibit
moderate GC-content of 40-50% [33], while GC-content
in protein-coding regions, measured by GC3 (or GC4), is
extremely high (70-90%) [34]. Similarly, genomic supercontigs containing sea lamprey KCNA genes identified
in the present study had 41~51% of genomic GC-content (excluding repetitive elements), while GC3 of the
KCNA genes ranged from 60 to 95%. The intra-genomic
partitioning in GC-content between protein-coding and
non-coding regions, seen also in the aforementioned
Drosophila species, has not been reported before for any
other vertebrate than the sea lamprey.
In principle, an employment of amino acid sequences
in phylogenetic analyses is thought to buffer against the
unfavorable effect caused by lineage-specific changes in
GC-content and codon usage. However, our findings
suggest that comparative sequence analyses with conventional methods involving lampreys at the amino acid
level as well as at the nucleotide level can be misleading.
The lineage-specific sequence properties that would
affect most lamprey genes can cause the typically, but
possibly incorrectly, recovered tree topology where lamprey sequences cluster at the basal branch of a

Page 8 of 11

vertebrate gene tree (Figure 1A). To accommodate the
lineage-specific alteration of amino acid substitution models, we employed a phylogenetic tree inference method
allowing a ‘non-homogeneous’ model [35,36]. This
attempt resulted in a tree topology with more inconsistent
relationships even inside gnathostome KCNA subgroups
and did not lead to improvement for this particular gene
family (data not shown). The possible causation between
the lamprey lineage-specific sequence properties and their
ambiguous phylogenetic positions should be verified with
more sampling of gene families based on complete genomic sequences for this group of species.

Conclusions
Our molecular phylogenetic analysis on the KCNA gene
family resulted in low resolution of lamprey gene phylogeny. We identified lamprey’s deviated amino acid composition and codon usage pattern from those of jawed
vertebrates. It is possible that these are associated with
the exceptionally high GC-content in protein-coding
regions and frequently observed ambiguous molecular
phylogeny of lamprey genes.
Methods
Sequences

Protein-coding nucleotide and amino acid sequences of
human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), dog
(Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis domestica),
platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus
gallus), anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), western clawed
frog (Xenopus tropicalis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu
(Takifugu rubripes), green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon
nigroviridis), medaka (Oryzias latipes) and three spine
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were downloaded
from Ensembl version 53 [37] via BioMart. Nucleotide
and amino acid sequences of the sea lamprey were
downloaded from NCBI as GenBank flat files, and their
protein-coding nucleotide sequences were extracted.
Sequences that are derived from mitochondrial DNA or
shorter than 100 amino acids were discarded. Partial
genome assembly of the elephant shark was downloaded
from http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/. Proteincoding sequences and their deduced amino acid
sequences for this species were obtained by gene prediction using Genscan [38] with the organism setting ‘Vertebrate’. Repetitive elements in the elephant shark
genome were identified using RepeatModeler http://
www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html.
KCNA sequence set

Sea lamprey genome assembly (PMAR3.0) was downloaded from the Genome Institute at Washington
University ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Other_Vertebrates/Petromyzon_marinus/. We performed

tBlastn using human KCNA protein sequences as
queries against the sea lamprey genome assembly. All
genomic segments with similarity (sequence alignment ≥
25 amino acids, identity ≥ 30%) to the queries were
retrieved and subjected to gene prediction with GeneWise [39] to extract coding nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of KCNA and closely related genes outside
the KCNA subfamily. To search KCNA genes of other
species, amino acid sequences of human KCNA genes
were used as queries to run Blastp searches against
Ensembl peptides as well as the NCBI GenPept database. All hits with similarity (sequence alignment ≥ 25
amino acids, identity ≥ 30%) to human KCNA
sequences were retrieved. To remove closely related
homologs outside KCNA, all retrieved sequences were
subjected to Blastp searches against human Ensembl
peptide database (version 53), and only those with best
hit to a KCNA were retained.

lamprey sequence, there were 45 possible tree topologies
(Figure 4B). Probabilities of the tree topologies were calculated using CONSEL [45].
Probabilistic counts of gene duplications before (Nbef)
and after (Naft) the cyclostome-gnathostome split were
performed as in a previous study [4]. For each sea lamprey KCNA gene, we divided all of the 45 possible tree
topologies into three groups supporting scenarios I or/
and II (see Figure 4A for details of scenario I and II).
First, 21 tree topologies support scenario I in which the
tri-gene cluster duplication occurred after the cyclostome-gnathostome split. Second, 18 tree topologies support scenario II in which the tri-gene cluster duplication
occurred before the cyclostome-gnathostome split. Third,
six tree topologies in which sea lamprey genes grouped
with KCNA4 or -7 could not statistically distinguish
between scenario I or II, In the third case, we assumed
that scenario I and II are equally possible (Figure 4B).

Molecular phylogenetics

Correspondence analysis of amino acid composition

Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using
MAFFT [40] with poorly aligned regions manually
removed. The best models of amino acid substitutions
were selected using ProtTest verstion 2.4 [41]. The LG
+Γ4 model was selected as most suitable to the dataset
for Figure S3, while the JTT+I+Γ4 was selected with the
dataset for Figure 3. Maximum-likelihood trees were
inferred using PhyML version 2.4.4 [42] under the
selected substitution model. Support values for individual nodes were estimated with 1000 bootstrap
replicates. Bayesian inference was performed using
MrBayes.3.1.2 [43] under the selected model with four
million generations (Additional file 2, Figure S2) and
two million generations (Additional file 3, Figure S3) of
two parallel runs. Consensus trees were generated after
‘burn-in’ for 25% sampled trees.
Phylogenetic positions of individual sea lamprey genes
were further investigated by likelihood-based statistical
tests under the assumed framework of gnathostome
KCNA phylogeny documented previously (Figure 4)
([17]; also see Figure 2). The analysis was performed
using Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [44] under the JTT+I+Γ4 model
by inputting all possible tree topologies for relevant taxa
in the ‘user-defined tree’ mode. For each tree, relationships within individual gnathostome KCNA subgroups
were constrained according to the generally accepted
species phylogeny. Relationships among KCNA4, -7 and
-1/2/3/5/6/10 were constrained according to the previously supported phylogenetic scenario [17]. All three
possible relationships between KCNA1/2, 3/6 and 5/10
were regarded as equally likely. Under these conditions,
we statistically analyzed positions of all seven sea lamprey KCNA genes individually by adding each of them
to the gnathostome KCNA gene set. For each sea

To investigate the amino acid composition, protein
sequences for each species were concatenated, and frequencies of each amino acid were calculated. A correspondence analysis of amino acid composition was
performed using the ‘dudi.coa’ function implemented in
the ADE-4 package [46] under the R statistical computing environment. Only the longest peptide sequence per
gene was used in this analysis. For the sea lamprey, to
avoid biases in amino acid composition measurements
caused by biased sampling of protein families, such as
the abundant variable lymphocyte receptors [47], we
removed identical or highly homologous sequences that
show ≥ 60% similarity at the amino acid sequence level.
Our final sequence set for the sea lamprey contained
173 genes (Additional file 5, Table S2). For the elephant
shark, we used predicted peptide sequences mentioned
above. To remove false positive gene predictions, all
predicted peptide sequences were used as queries to run
Blastp against protein sequences of human, chicken,
western clawed frog, zebrafish, medaka and fugu, and
only sequences with significant similarity (e-value ≤ 1e20) were retained. The resulting sequences were further
used as queries to run tBlastn against a repetitive element library built for this species (see above). All
sequences with significant similarity (e-value ≤ 1e-20) to
any repetitive element were discarded.
Amino acid composition of alignable regions of vertebrate KCNA proteins sequences was analyzed based on
the aforementioned procedure. Partial KCNA sequences
(containing < 70% of alignable region in length) were
excluded. As variable regions account for substantial
parts of KCNA proteins, a separate analysis was performed using the full-length protein sequences of the
same set of KCNA genes.

Synonymous codon usage analysis

Effective number of codons index (ENc) [21] and base
compositions were calculated using codonW http://
codonw.sourceforge.net/. Synonymous codon usage was
investigated by within-group correspondence analysis
(WCA) of codon counts [22,23] and by correspondence
analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (CARSCU). The latter is the most widely used method for
codon usage analysis, whereas the former has been
recently demonstrated to produce more unbiased results
because it takes into account both amino acid composition and codon degeneracy information [48]. For each
species, protein-coding sequences were concatenated
and frequencies of 59 synonymous codons were calculated. Correspondence analyses were performed using
the ‘dudi.coa’ and ‘within’ functions in the ADE-4 package [46]. If a given gene had multiple alternative splicing
variants, only the one with the longest coding sequence
was used. Heat maps of relative synonymous codon
usage were generated using CIMMiner http://discover.
nci.nih.gov/cimminer.
