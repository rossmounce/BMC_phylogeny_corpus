Abstract
Background: Pinus pinaster is an economically and ecologically important species that is becoming a woody
gymnosperm model. Its enormous genome size makes whole-genome sequencing approaches are hard to apply.
Therefore, the expressed portion of the genome has to be characterised and the results and annotations have to
be stored in dedicated databases.
Description: EuroPineDB is the largest sequence collection available for a single pine species, Pinus pinaster
(maritime pine), since it comprises 951 641 raw sequence reads obtained from non-normalised cDNA libraries and
high-throughput sequencing from adult (xylem, phloem, roots, stem, needles, cones, strobili) and embryonic
(germinated embryos, buds, callus) maritime pine tissues. Using open-source tools, sequences were optimally preprocessed, assembled, and extensively annotated (GO, EC and KEGG terms, descriptions, SNPs, SSRs, ORFs and
InterPro codes). As a result, a 10.5× P. pinaster genome was covered and assembled in 55 322 UniGenes. A total of
32 919 (59.5%) of P. pinaster UniGenes were annotated with at least one description, revealing at least 18 466
different genes. The complete database, which is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and expandable, is freely
available at: http://www.scbi.uma.es/pindb/. It can be retrieved by gene libraries, pine species, annotations,
UniGenes and microarrays (i.e., the sequences are distributed in two-colour microarrays; this is the only conifer
database that provides this information) and will be periodically updated. Small assemblies can be viewed using a
dedicated visualisation tool that connects them with SNPs. Any sequence or annotation set shown on-screen can
be downloaded. Retrieval mechanisms for sequences and gene annotations are provided.
Conclusions: The EuroPineDB with its integrated information can be used to reveal new knowledge, offers an
easy-to-use collection of information to directly support experimental work (including microarray hybridisation),
and provides deeper knowledge on the maritime pine transcriptome.

1 Background
Conifers (Coniferales), the most important group of
gymnosperms, represent 650 species, some of which are
the largest, tallest, and oldest non-clonal terrestrial
organisms on Earth. They are of immense ecological
importance, dominating many terrestrial landscapes and
representing the largest terrestrial carbon sink. Currently
present in a large number of ecosystems, they have
evolved very efficient physiological adaptation systems.

Given that trees are the great majority of conifers, they
provide a different perspective on plant genome biology
and evolution taking into account that conifers are separated from angiosperms by more than 300 million years
of independent evolution. Studies on the conifer genome
are revealing unique information which cannot be
inferred from currently sequenced angiosperm genomes
(such as poplar, Eucaliptus, Arabidopsis or rice): around
30% of conifer genes have little or no sequence similarity to plant genes of known function [1,2]. Unfortunately, conifer genomics is hindered by the very large
genome (e.g. the pine genome is approximately 160
times larger than Arabidopsis and seven times larger

than the human genome; in fact, it is larger than any
other genome sequenced to date) that is replete with
highly repetitive, non-coding sequences [3].
Conifers include the economically and ecologically
important species of spruces (Picea sp) and pines
(Pinus), Pinus being the largest extant genus with
approximately 115 species. The importance of pines is
due to the fact that: (i) their timber and paper pulp are
used for the construction of buildings and furniture; (ii)
they are used in reforestation due to their rapid growth
and drought tolerance as compared to other tree species; (iii) they help stabilise sandy soils and indirectly act
as an atmospheric CO 2 sink, helping to reduce global
warming; (iv) some pine nuts are widely used in Mediterranean cuisine. Consequently, the genus Pinus is
becoming a woody gymnosperm model. The main pine
model species in Europe are Pinus pinaster and Pinus
sylvestris, whereas Pinus taeda and Pinus contorta are
the equivalent in North America. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate and increase our knowledge of the
content of the pine genome as this would allow the
exploitation of natural genetic resources and the use of
new forest reproductive material appropriate to adapt
these trees to a changing climate.
The application of genome-based science is playing an
important role in understanding the genome content and
structure of different organisms. Since whole-genome
sequencing approaches are hard to apply to large genomes
such as the pine genome, scientists have focused on the
expressed portion of the genome using dedicated technologies. For example, the sequencing of clones obtained by
suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) [4-6] provides
gene-enriched sequences that are specific to a particular
condition. However, the dominant approach to characterising the transcriptionally active portions of pine genomes
has been expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [7,8] due to the
absence of non-coding DNA (mainly introns and intergenic regions). Classic ESTs are subject to artefacts during
cDNA library construction and are highly error prone during sequencing procedures. As a result, erroneous clustering and assembling occur during reconstruction of
putative transcripts and may ultimately lead to inaccurate
gene annotation [9]. However, next-generation sequencing
technologies have removed many drawbacks and timeconsuming steps involved in classic ESTs and have facilitated transcriptome sequencing of many species at a fraction of the total time and cost previously required [10].
ESTs have also driven the development of pine microarrays [11-14], although there is no easy way to relate the
data printed on these microarrays to the corresponding
pine sequences.
Sequencing projects should store, organise, and
retrieve sequences by means of user-friendly databases.
Since many sequences in EST databases are reported to

Page 2 of 11

be highly contaminated or incorrectly pre-processed [9],
there is a need for more reliable pre-processing, clustering, assembly and annotation pipelines to yield reliable
information. ConiferEST [15] (now part of ConiferGDB
http://www.conifergdb.org/coniferEST.php) was the first
attempt to rationalise pine sequences by more precise
pre-processing dedicated to Pinus taeda traces only.
The DFCI Pine Gene Index http://compbio.dfci.harvard.
edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=pine, a subset of the discontinued TGI Gene Indices [16], is a non-redundant
database of all putative Pinus genes. This is a very large
compilation of pine sequences, but only GO and KEGG
annotations are available and no separation by species is
provided, P. taeda is highly over-represented, and its
interface only allows limited interaction. ForestTreeDB
was created to centralise large-scale ESTs from diverse
tissues of conifer and poplar trees [1], but it is no longer
available. The TreeGenes database http://dendrome.
ucdavis.edu/treegenes/ is composed of a wide range of
forest tree species [17]. This effort to combine and
inter-relate a great variety of different information
should be acknowledged, even though EST pre-processing is not optimal. TreeSNPs [18] and PineSAP [19]
are databases exclusively devoted to single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in Picea and Pinus species,
respectively. Recently, Parchman and co-workers [2]
described the first high-throughput analysis of a pine
species, but no database was created for this. It should
be noted that none of the above databases are linked to
the pine microarrays described in literature.
Our group has been working on pine genomics for
many years (e.g., EMBL accession numbers AM982822AM983454, BX248593-BX255804, BX682240-BX683073,
BX784033-BX784385, EC428477-EC428747, FM945441FM945999 or FN256437-FN257130) and wish to provide
high-quality sequences and annotations of pine genomes
by means of EuroPineDB. Taking advantage of next-generation sequencing methods, recently released pre-processors [20], reliable sequence annotators [21], and the
bioinformatics infrastructure of the University of Málaga
(Spain), EuroPineDB was designed to gather the most
reliable re-pre-processed, assembled, and annotated P.
pinaster sequences using different technologies. Retrieval
systems based on sequence similarity, description
matches or microarray positions are also included, as
well as browsing by species, experimental process, and
annotation. As a new feature, many of its sequences
have been printed on a microarray for expression analysis [22] and can be freely browsed.

2 Construction and content
2.1 Pine sequences

Although EuroPineDB is mainly devoted to the P. pinaster (maritime pine) genome, several sequences from

Fernández-Pozo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:366
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/366

two other species (P. sylvestris and P. pinea) are also
included since their sequences were printed in a pine
microarray (see below).
2.1.1 Gene libraries

Different gene libraries, all of which were constructed
using different tissues and different strategies (described
in Table 1) were included. All libraries were sequenced
using Sanger’s dideoxynucleotide method except for the
sequences generated from Pp-454, which were obtained
with a GS-FLX pyrosequencer using Titanium technology. Pp-454 was the main contributor to the database (55
431 UniGenes and 844 737 curated reads). Frequency
distributions of reads and contigs are shown in Figure 1.
2.1.2 EMBL sequences

Gene library reads were completed with 13 206
sequences from the EMBL v. 102 database including the
plant EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) and plant STD
(Standard) sets for sequences whose ‘source organism’
field contained P. pinaster, P. sylvestris or P. pinea, provided that the sequence was not already included as a
member of one of the gene libraries, and discarding any
organellar sequence or sequences whose length was
below 100 bp. The idea was to gather all sequence data
on the three species, including their annotations. With
P. pinaster as the main contributor (12 673 out of 13
206 EMBL entries), EMBL entries only provided 5667
different UniGenes.
2.1.3 Microarray

Before EuroPineDB was constructed – based on the
existing putative UniGenes http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/

Page 3 of 11

SAM/COMPLETE/index.php?ID=gemini – an ESTbased microarray was designed containing 3456 spots
printed twice with clones taken from the Pin, Gemini
and CK16 gene libraries only (Table 2) [22]. Spots were
distributed on the chip into 16 blocks of 16 × 14 dots.
The microarray also included some full-length cDNA
sequences of genes related to nitrogen metabolism, such
as aspartate aminotransferase, asparagine synthetase, Lasparaginase, glutamine synthetase a and b, NADP+ isocitrate dehydrogenase and ornithine aminotransferase,
which can be found in the EMBL v102 set. The inclusion of microarray information in EuroPineDB facilitates
accessing the most complete information on each
sequence printed on it. In the near future, microarrays
implemented with sequences contained in EuroPineDB
will be also included.
2.2 Database architecture

The EuroPineDB was built using Ruby On Rails 2.0
http://rubyonrails.org/, a web development framework
that uses a model-view-controller pattern to maintain
strict separation between the web interface (views) code,
database tables (models), and all methods that handle
interactions between views and database (controllers). It
also maintains different environments for each development phase (development, production and testing). This
enabled EuroPineDB to be developed and tested in a
redundant Oracle RAC (Real Application Cluster) database. Bulk imports, updates, and database managements
were automated by means of Ruby scripts.

reads used for EuroPineDB. As expected, Sanger reads were
longer than 454 reads in length. B, Contig size distribution within
EuroPineDB.

An automated pipeline that combines all the tools
described here is executed on every EuroPineDB update.
An update incorporates new pine sequence retrieval
from dbEST and EMBL databases, new user reads, and
the re-execution of bioinformatics tools with every new
UniGene.
2.3 Pre-processing and assembling entries

Most problems for automated sequence assembly
resulted from chimerical clones in the plasmid libraries,
bacterial DNA contamination, low-quality sequences,
and low-complexity repeats. Since ESTs in databases are
commonly inaccurately pre-processed, any data
sequence contained in EuroPineDB whose quality values
(QV) for each nucleotide are available was pre-processed
using SeqTrim http://www.scbi.uma.es/seqtrim with
parameter customisation for each type of library [20].
High-quality pre-processed EST and SSH sequences
guarantee that only non-chimerical, good-quality
sequences (i.e., reads devoid of vectors, adaptors, polyA/T tails, contaminants, and potential cloning artefacts)
are included in the database, while sequences consisting
of cloning vectors (AC BX676903) or containing poly-A
(AC BX676940) were removed. The better the quality of
the trimmed sequences, the more reliable the final
assembly. It should be noted that 52.5% of nucleotides

Page 4 of 11

from the Pp-454 gene library were discarded due to low
quality. The EMBL v. 102 subset included in EuroPineDB was also pre-processed with SeqTrim in order to
remove uninformative, contaminant or erroneous
sequences, even though these sequences lack a QV.
Curated sequences, i.e. those longer than 100 bp for
Sanger’s reads and 60 bp for 454 reads that exceed SeqTrim pre-processing, were assembled to produce putative pine transcriptional units (UniGenes) as contigs and
singletons. Sanger’s reads were de novo assembled with
a web version of CAP3 [http://www.scbi.uma.es/cap3,
[23]] since it has been described as a highly reliable
sequence assembler for establishing UniGenes [24] with
these types of reads. CAP3 assembly was conducted
with default parameters using 85% as the cut-off for
overlap percent identity to deal with the sequence variation due to the high heterozygosity of pine genes and
genome heterogeneity between samples (Table 1). The
454 reads were de novo assembled with a web version of
MIRA3 [http://www.scbi.uma.es/mira, [25]] using 454
settings for ESTs, which enormously reduces the number of misassembled contigs; moreover, this assembly
contains 99.94% of curated reads and provides as few as
471 singletons (0.06%). Each library sequence set (Table
1) was assembled separately to obtain specific UniGene
assemblies for every gene library and every pine species
(Table 2); P. pinaster comprehensive assembly was also
performed with MIRA3 with mixed 454-Sanger settings.
A collection of all UniGenes is available for every
assembly and the distribution of contig lengths is shown
in Figure 1, where the longest reads correspond to Sanger reads and the mean length of GS-FLX Titanium
reads are below the expected mean length due to the
extremely high number of low quality nucleotides
(52.5%, Table 2). SSH libraries account for the small
shoulder on 200 bp in Figure 1A for Sanger reads.
2.4 Annotation

The annotation of pine sequences is especially challenging since, phylogenetically, pine is distantly related to
angiosperm plant models, for which significantly more
data and tools are already available [26]. EuroPineDB
contains detailed and reliable annotations on UniGenes.
This was achieved by combining the results of several
annotation processes (described below). The redundant
bioinformatics approach makes the curation and annotation processes highly reliable. During every EuroPineDB
update, new sequences and new contigs will be re-annotated to provide the correct link and annotation as
knowledge increases. Each sequence and UniGene has a
specific page to display its annotation together with the
E value associated with it to enable the empirical assessment of annotation quality. The current version of

EuroPineDB includes annotations for 59.5% of pine
UniGenes.
2.4.1 Putative description

A sequence description is a user-friendly manner to
offer information about putative functions. Every Sanger
sequence in EuroPineDB is given a definition from up
to four different sources, with the advantage that inconsistent descriptions are evidence of misannotation.
Descriptions were obtained from: (i) the original
description, if the sequence has one in the EMBL; (ii)
the user definition, provided by the sequence owner
when downloading sequences; (iii) the description
retrieved by Blast2GO (see below); and (iv) the PGI definition obtained by the best hit in a low stringency
BLAST (E < 10-3). Each UniGene contains only the definition provided by Blast2GO (see below).
2.4.2 GO terms, EC keys, KEGG maps, and interpro codes

Every UniGene sequence was annotated using Blast2GO
[21] using the best 10 sequences providing hits of at
least 150 nt with a threshold E-value of 10-10 against the
non-redundant GeneBank in order to remove spurious
annotations. In addition, GO terms with experimental
evidence codes were the most preferred, while computational evidence codes and codes inferred by curator
were half-weighted for the final annotation; GO terms
without biological evidence data or inferred from electronic annotation were discarded. This provided annotations with a high degree of confidence for UniGenes
using an E-value for evidence codes of 10 -6 . A Ruby

script was designed to assign the corresponding metabolic pathway (a KEGG map) to each EC key provided
by Blast2GO. InterPro codes obtained from Blast2GO
were included to add other high-valued annotations
(such as functional sites, protein families or conserved
domains) since it is an integrated documentation
resource [27]. Entries without annotations are candidates for re-annotation with every database update.
2.4.3 SSRs, SNPs and ORFs

Plant cDNAs contain a high frequency of polymorphisms whose main sources are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and single sequence repeats (SSRs).
They serve to build molecular markers that form an
essential starting point for association studies and other
genome scan applications such as comparative genomics. SNPs and SSRs can also be used as templates to
design primers that amplify specific genomic DNA in
diverse populations [28]. SSRs have been assessed with
MREPS (http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/mreps/ [29]). SNPs have
been calculated with an adapted version of AlignMiner
[28]. The tentative (complete or incomplete) ORFs were
inferred from the results of Full-Lengther [30].

3 Utility and discussion
Molecular sequence databases are fundamental
resources for modern bioscientists. The development
of such a genomic resource for Pinus pinaster should
facilitate basic and applied research on the genetics
and evolution of this species, its role in maintaining

Fernández-Pozo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:366
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/366

forest health and ecosystem function, and the genetic
traits that are desirable for the paper pulp and wood
industry.
3.1 Web interface

EuroPineDB has been designed with a user-friendly
interface (Figure 2) that can be browsed anonymously,
although an authentication process has been considered
to grant sequence owners the necessary permissions to
browse their sequences privately, or browse through
other authorised-while-private unpublished data. It has
five top tabs and a menu on the left that enable database mining from different entry points. Two types of
search tabs have also been implemented to perform
queries and to retrieve and browse the resulting

Page 6 of 11

sequences. Information on tool versions and database
releases used for obtaining the last update is shown on
the right of the home page.
There is an option to download files containing UniGene sequences or sequences displayed on a page in
FASTA format (including their QV when available),
which facilitates further analyses by laboratories. Crosslinks to the EMBL database are always provided by
means of the accession numbers.
3.1.1 Navigation tabs

By means of the ‘Gene Libraries’ tab, the user can see
gene libraries, UniGenes and annotations for every gene
library included in EuroPineDB. Each one contains a
short description and some characteristics, including the
statistical distribution of the relevant GO terms. The

Figure 2 An example of microarray page in EuroPineDB Web. The upper part contains general information about the microarray as well as
some statistical representation of the GO term distribution. The lower part is a representation of all sequences printed in a selected block. The
colour codes are defined at the bottom of the Web page (not shown) and in the text.

UniGene dataset consists of a consensus sequence of
each contig and the singletons (see above).
Gene library clones are stored in 96-well and/or 384well plates in the laboratory. Navigation using the ‘96Well plates’ and ‘384-Well plates’ tabs displays the plate
organisation of the libraries. Users can download the
sequences of all clones in a plate or browse the plate in
which red clones are useless sequences, green clones are
those that have successfully passed SeqTrim pre-processing, and black ones are printed controls.
Currently, only one microarray (Pinarray1) has been
designed with EuroPineDB sequences [22]. The ‘Microarray’ tab displays general and statistical information
about Pinarray1 (Figure 2), whose printed sequences
and annotations can be downloaded. Each microarray
block organisation is displayed in the lower part of the
page. Coordinates refer to a single sequence. The colours green, red and black have the same meaning as in
the plates (see above). The graphic representation offers
the possibility of retrieving information from specific
clones after analysis of any experimental result using
this microarray.
Sequences in EuroPineDB have been assembled by
gene library and pine species, and can be accessed using
the ‘Assemblies’ tab. Each assembly can be inspected in
detail, showing a paged list of UniGenes and a summary
description. The detailed view of every UniGene

includes the aligned sequences, their orientation, the
contig alignment (as a simple-text), a description for the
consensus sequence, and the putative description of
each included Sanger sequence.
Clicking on the name of a clone provides access to all the
information about it (e.g. EMBL accession number,
sequence length, the plate(s) in which it can be found,
annotations, original and pre-processed sequences, gene
library source, etc). From the sequence entry, users can
return to any previously described browsing page (Figure 3).
At the home page, a menu on the left enables filtered
browsing by microarray, pine species, or annotation. Filtered browsing only displays entries sharing the same
selected annotation. Each item in the list opens a new
page with the EuroPineDB entries that share this specific annotation. For example, based on nitrogen metabolism (KEGG 00910), it is possible to know how many
sequences are present in the database, since by clicking
on 00910 every enzyme from this pathway can be seen,
as well as the entries that are annotated as being one of
these enzymes. As an additional example, all UniGenes
involved in photosynthesis (GO:0015979) that belong to
a particular library or pine species can be identified by
means of GO term filtering.

similarity. A text search engine has been implemented.
It can look for words in annotations (i.e. descriptions
for sequences, GOs, ECs and InterPro) or for specific
codes (i.e. accession numbers or EuroPineDB identifiers). Search results can be restricted to different database subsets (displayed on the Web page as
checkboxes), and they are then grouped by common
characteristics and displayed in tabs which show/hide
the list of elements that match the request. Results are
also linked to their respective description pages.
A low-stringent (E < 10-3) BLAST-based search engine
enables users to look for EuroPineDB entries similar to
their amino acid or nucleotide sequence. The type of
sequence (amino acid or nucleotides) is automatically
detected, and either BLASTN or BLASTX will be used
from the latest BLAST+ version [31]. BLAST searches
may be conducted against different subsets of EuroPineDB: by species (P. pinaster, P. sylvestris and/or P.
pinea, which can be chosen and combined as desired);
and by single sequence or UniGenes. BLAST executions
are queued and the results are accessible for up to 1
month with a custom URL that is sent to the user.
3.2 EuroPineDB is a large maritime pine sequence
collection

EuroPineDB is mainly devoted to P. pinaster since its
877 523 curated reads (99.7% of total reads) have produced approximately 5.24 × 108 nt in 55 332 UniGenes
(Table 2), 24 937 being > 500 bp. Assuming that a similar number of genes occur in P. pinaster as in Arabidopsis thaliana (25 000, which is close to the number of
UniGenes > 500 bp) and a similar average transcript
length (2000 nt), average transcriptome coverage was
estimated at 10.5×. This amount of data and the high
coverage represent a substantial sequence resource for
P. pinaster that will contribute significantly to its genomic analysis and make EuroPineDB one of the largest
sequence collections available for a pine species. Further
evidence of the high coverage is that the number of P.
pinaster UniGenes is slightly lower than the number of
UniGenes in the Pp-454 library (55 431, Table 2). This
indicates that UniGenes from the other gene libraries,
which are also longer in size (Figure 1), have served to
gather together apparently independent contigs from the
454 sequencing, and that most ESTs revealed by capillary (Sanger) analyses of cDNA libraries (Table 1) were
also encountered in the 454-sequenced pooled RNA.
3.3 EuroPineDB sequences include a low occurrence of
repetitive and retrotransposon-like sequences

The percentage of retrotransposon-like sequences in
EuroPineDB is quite low (127 [0.0001%] reads and 20
[0.0003%] UniGenes), in contrast with the 6.2% found in
P. contorta, indicating that mRNA isolation for cDNA

Page 8 of 11

synthesis in all gene libraries guarantees the best
approach for gene discovery, instead of using total RNA.
The reduced amount of repetitive DNA found in the
coding sequences and the relatively long reads obtained
by the sequencing procedures have enabled an accurate
de novo assembly and a reliable UniGene collection of
maritime pine. A relative high proportion of reads (876
839 out of 877 523, 99.92%) was assembled into reliable
contigs (containing less than 9% mismatches), which is
in agreement with other high-coverage assemblies [32].
3.4 EuroPineDB shed light on pine transcriptome

Since estimating the number of genes and the level of
transcript coverage represented in an EST collection is
an important issue for transcriptome sequencing projects, functional information of EuroPineDB UniGenes
was included by means of the widely-used Blast2GO
annotator [21]. A wide range of GO terms was assigned
to EuroPineDB UniGenes indicating that a wide diversity of transcripts is represented in the database (results
not shown). Therefore, 32 919 (59.5%) out of 55 332
UniGenes of P. pinaster were annotated and corresponded to at least 18 466 different genes (which is the
number of unique UniProt hits). Assuming that UniGenes inferred from contigs longer than 500 bp are a
reliable view of a transcriptome and observing that the
number of P. pinaster UniGenes longer than 500 bp (20
928, including annotated and unannotated UniGenes) is
slightly greater than the number of different UniGenes
regarding unique UniProt hits (18 466), it can be
inferred that much of the P. pinaster genes have been
identified with the gene libraries described in Table 1,
since both numbers (18 466 and 20 928) are close to
the 25 000 genes that are supposed to form the A. thaliana genome.
The 59.5% of annotated maritime pine UniGenes is
consistent with the 63.6% (20 928 out of 32 919 UniGenes) obtained when considering only UniGenes
longer than 500 bp. Both percentages are only slightly
lower than the 65% annotated in Eucawood [33] and the
67.8% in Melogen [34], but clearly more than the 32%
of annotated sequences of P. contorta [2]. In total, 935
(1.7%) UniGenes were annotated with another pine
sequence and 16 113 (29.1%) were annotated with a
conifer (mainly Picea), which reflects the paucity of
information on conifers in databases. This is further
highlighted by the fact that the 12 057 (31%) annotated
pine genes are qualified as “unknown” proteins, even
though most of these unknown proteins correspond to
non-annotated full-length transcripts from Picea glauca
[35]. The predicted putative ORF could perhaps provide
further support to any future functional annotation. The
40.5% of unannotated UniGenes may then correspond
to one or more of the following possibilities: (i) putative

Fernández-Pozo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:366
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/366

new pine genes that do not have an orthologue; (ii) noncoding RNAs (including pseudogenes, antisense transcripts, structured RNAs, microRNAs, etc) that have
recently been found in abundance when deep transcriptome analysis is performed [36,37]; (iii) short sequences
from the UTR part that are difficult to match, even
though 36.4% (11 991) of annotated UniGenes are
shorter than 500 bp; and (iv) artefactual assemblies that
do not correspond to valid protein-coding sequences, as
occurs in 15% of entries in the human gene catalogue
[38].
Each UniGene also includes information about putative SSRs and SNPs, since the development of SSR and
SNP markers in pine species could serve to dissect complex traits given that linkage disequilibrium is low or
declines rapidly within the length of an average-sized
gene [39]. A total of 4740 SSRs have been found in
EuroPineDB for P. pinaster; tri-nucleotide repeats were
found to be the most common SSRs in EuroPineDB
(55.7%), with tetra-nucleotide (12.6%) and di-nucleotide
(10.5%) repeats being present at much smaller frequencies. This contrasts with P. contorta in which di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant. A total of 44 185
SNPs were also identified. Most SSRs and SNPs (3546
[74.8%] and 41 152 [93.1%], respectively) occur in UniGenes with a putative ORF (2966 and 10 756, respectively), and 1% occurs in start/end codons. These
numbers are difficult to compare to other conifers
because of the different algorithms used for detection
[2,18,39]. Due to the enormous size of the pine genome,
ORF-based SSRs and SNPs are advantageous since they
will reduce the mapping efforts required for the development of high-density maps and association studies.
The development of SSR/SNP molecular markers, as
well as the ORF predictions contained in EuroPineDB,
will facilitate comparative genomics with other wellknown conifers like P. taeda, P. contorta, P. glauca and
P. sitchensis, and will be very useful to scientists interested in different aspects of pine genomics. In contrast
to other plant databases, the SSRs and SNPs included in
EuroPineDB are downloadable and can be used within
any research project.
3.5 EuroPineDB differential features

EuroPineDB is a dynamic structure since its content is
re-assembled and re-annotated when new sequences are
added. It is designed to include new tables that display
other pine genomic features in the near future. Its purpose is to make UniGenes and their annotations available to the scientific community involved in pine
genomics by means of a flexible interface for developing
queries. Although overlaps exist with the content of the
Pine Gene Index (PGI) [16] and TreeGenes [17], each

Page 9 of 11

database offers distinct analytical approaches, enabling
EuroPineDB to contain sequence relationships that cannot be found elsewhere. Moreover, EuroPineDB only
includes sequences that have passed stringent quality filtering and only reliable annotations are assigned. Such a
procedure provides a high level of confidence in the
putative function and characteristics of P. pinaster UniGenes. Whereas the final aim of TreeGenes is to compare the different Pinaceae species, EuroPineDB, like
ConiferEST [15], is more focused on deep information
about a single species. In contrast to PGI and to ConiferEST, EuroPineDB differentiates pine species, contains
the highest number of ESTs for a single conifer species,
and provides insights on every gene library used to seed
the database. ConiferEST attempted to provide reliable
P. taeda EST pre-processing, anticipating the finding
that at least 4.8% of ESTs in dbEST are contaminated
by vectors, linkers, E. coli DNA and mitochondrial
sequences [9]. TreeGenes does not fully pre-process
chromatograms, since it was started using the high-quality sequence provided by PHRED; this has been
described as a suboptimal strategy since it over-trims in
relation to terminal structures, representing a loss of
directional, positional and structural information on
cDNA termini [20]. Since Pine Gene Index 7.0 extracted
the sequences directly from databases, it contains
untrimmed terminus parts, which has a detrimental
impact on many downstream EST applications, thereby
compromising the reliability of their resulting tentative
contigs.
Early pre-processing of some gene libraries considered in EuroPineDB [40] have proven to be incorrectly
processed and annotated (e.g. accession numbers
BX252344, BX255382, BX252627, BX252630 or
BX251344), and this is mainly due to using the nowoutdated StackPack [41] workflows based on PHRED
and PHRAP algorithms. EuroPineDB was pre-processed with SeqTrim [20] and assembled using CAP3
[23] and MIRA3 [25]. The use of SeqTrim was advantageous in obtaining reliable trimmed sequences,
which is preferable to tailor-made scripts for every
kind of sequence. An example of this improvement is
indicated by the fact that EMBL v. 102 provided 12
673 out of 13 206 sequence entries (Table 2) devoid of
any class of contaminant/artefactual sequences.
Although this percentage could be considered too high
for the EMBL database, it is clearly under the 4.8%
reported for ESTs [9] because EMBL sequences have a
more detailed curation process than ESTs. The use of
SeqTrim is also devoid of the original reads of contaminating sequences from several bacteria and fungi genomes. Since contigs established with MIRA3 are highly
reliable (the maximal mismatch percent in a contig is

Fernández-Pozo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:366
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/366

below 9%), EuroPineDB assemblies for P. pinaster
would provide highly reliable UniGenes that would
reflect a realistic set of pine genes.

4 Conclusion
EuroPineDB can be browsed intuitively (Figures 2 and 3)
using several tabs, and data can be retrieved by text
terms or sequence similarity using a stand-alone BLAST
implementation. As a new feature, location information
on sequences in microarrays is provided (Figure 2). UniGenes and its annotations can be browsed and downloaded (Figure 3) by pine species as well as by gene
library, thus providing scientists with a comprehensive
source of information on genomics and transcriptomics
of P. pinaster. All this, together with the detailed
sequence information and annotation, user-friendly
Web-interface (Figure 2), regular updates, as well as
connection to printed microarrays, make EuroPineDB
extremely valuable to researchers using pine as a model
organism, since its annotations and UniGenes cannot be
found elsewhere. Finally, the current EuroPineDB
assembly could also be used to design a new generation
of pine microarrays comprising more UniGenes that
would cover more transcriptome elements. Any scientists wishing to incorporate their sequences in EuroPineDB should contact the administrator to upload the
data and obtain a private user account.
