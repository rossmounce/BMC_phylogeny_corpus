Abstract
Background: Recent phylogenomic analyses have revolutionized our view of eukaryote evolution by revealing
unexpected relationships between and within the eukaryotic supergroups. However, for several groups of
uncultivable protists, only the ribosomal RNA genes and a handful of proteins are available, often leading to
unresolved evolutionary relationships. A striking example concerns the supergroup Rhizaria, which comprises
several groups of uncultivable free-living protists such as radiolarians, foraminiferans and gromiids, as well as the
parasitic plasmodiophorids and haplosporids. Thus far, the relationships within this supergroup have been inferred
almost exclusively from rRNA, actin, and polyubiquitin genes, and remain poorly resolved. To address this, we have
generated large Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) datasets for 5 species of Rhizaria belonging to 3 important groups:
Acantharea (Astrolonche sp., Phyllostaurus sp.), Phytomyxea (Spongospora subterranea, Plasmodiophora brassicae) and
Gromiida (Gromia sphaerica).
Results: 167 genes were selected for phylogenetic analyses based on the representation of at least one rhizarian
species for each gene. Concatenation of these genes produced a supermatrix composed of 36,735 amino acid
positions, including 10 rhizarians, 9 stramenopiles, and 9 alveolates. Phylogenomic analyses of this large dataset
revealed a strongly supported clade grouping Foraminifera and Acantharea. The position of this clade within
Rhizaria was sensitive to the method employed and the taxon sampling: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
analyses using empirical model of evolution favoured an early divergence, whereas the CAT model and ML
analyses with fast-evolving sites or the foraminiferan species Reticulomyxa filosa removed suggested a derived
position, closely related to Gromia and Phytomyxea. In contrast to what has been previously reported, our analyses
also uncovered the presence of the rhizarian-specific polyubiquitin insertion in Acantharea. Finally, this work reveals
another possible rhizarian signature in the 60S ribosomal protein L10a.
Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the evolution of Rhizaria based on phylogenomic analyses of
ESTs from three groups of previously under-sampled protists. It was enabled through the application of a recently
developed method of transcriptome analysis, requiring very small amount of starting material. Our study illustrates
the potential of this method to elucidate the early evolution of eukaryotes by providing large amount of data for
uncultivable free-living and parasitic protists.

Background
Over the last few years, the phylogenomic approach was
successful in untangling several aspects of the early evolution of eukaryotes. Most eukaryotic diversity has been

assigned to one of few supergroups [1] and new relationships between these large assemblages have
emerged. For example, the unexpected close evolutionary affinity of Rhizaria to two of the “chromalveolate”
groups, stramenopiles and alveolates (the SAR group, or
Harosa in [2]), was recovered in several phylogenomic
analyses [3-6]. Even orphan lineages that have been very
challenging to place within the eukaryotic tree, such as
the telonemids and centrohelids, or the breviate amoebae, have recently been shown to be related to

haptophytes and centrohelids or to Amoebozoa, respectively [7-9]. However, several question marks remain,
notably concerning the placement of the root [10], the
monophyly of some supergroups [11], and the relationships within and between the supergroups, especially
where uncultivated protists dominate.
The supergroup Rhizaria, composed of several phyla
that are difficult to maintain in laboratory cultures, is a
good example of the persisting uncertainties for the relationships between the major members of this assemblage.
Although a few rhizarians can be isolated and cultivated
[12], the majority is known only from environmental
sequences [13] or single-specimens extractions [14,15].
Consequently, rhizarians are represented in sequence
databases almost entirely by ribosomal rDNA [16]. A few
protein sequences of actin, a-tubulin, b-tubulin, RNA
polymerase II, and polyubiquitin are available for selected
taxonomic groups [17-20] but for other lineages, such as
radiolarians, only the actin-coding gene has been
sequenced, which is in sharp contrast to the great diversity of the group and its ecological importance. Recently,
five small rhizarian cDNA libraries have been sequenced
(3 Cercozoa and 2 Foraminifera), partially filling the gap
in comparison to other supergroups, and one genome
project (Bigelowiella natans) is in progress (http://www.
jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/50026.html).
According to the current consensus, Rhizaria are composed of three highly diverse and possibly monophyletic
phyla, Cercozoa, Foraminifera, and Radiolaria (including
Acantharea, Polycystinea and Taxopodida, but excluding
Phaeodarea that were shown to branch among Cercozoa
[21]). The Rhizaria comprise also the parasitic Phytomyxea and Haplosporidia, as well as various marine
filose and reticulose protists, including Gromiida and
Filoreta, sometimes considered members of Cercozoa
[22,23]. The relationships between these groups are
uncertain, due to the lack of resolution observed in the
SSU and LSU rDNA as well as the few available protein
trees. The most controversial is the position of Foraminifera, whose fast evolving SSU rDNA sequences branch
either close to Haplosporidia and Gromiida [19,24] or as
sister group to Radiolaria [13,25,26]. The weakly supported grouping of Foraminifera and Radiolaria observed
in some SSU and LSU rDNA trees led to the creation of
the infrakingdom Retaria [26,27]. Another source of
information came from the insertions of one or two
amino acids at the monomer junctions in the highly
conserved protein polyubiquitin. These insertions have
been found in Cercozoa and Foraminifera but not in all
other eukaryotes studied to date, including radiolarians
[17,23]. It has been argued that the ancestor of polycystine and acantharean Radiolaria could have lost the
insertion, but the lack of insertion could also be

explained by contamination of DNA samples by nonrhizarian protists [23].
To test the Retaria hypothesis and to shed light on the
relationships between most of the deeply branching rhizarian groups, a protocol was developed to prepare
cDNA libraries suitable for 454 sequencing from a handful of cells collected from environmental samples. We
obtained and analyzed more than 670,000 ESTs from 2
marine acantharean Radiolaria (Astrolonche sp. and Phyllostaurus sp.), 2 parasitic Phytomyxea (Plasmodiophora
brassicae and Spongospora subterranea) and Gromia
sphaerica, a giant marine testate protist that is capable of
producing macroscopic bilaterian-like traces [28]. Phylogenetic analyses of 167 genes support the Retaria hypothesis and suggest that this group may be most closely
related to Phytomyxea and Gromia. Moreover, our study
confirms the presence of polyubiquitin insertion in some
Acantharea and reveals another possible rhizarian-specific
signature in one of the ribosomal proteins.

Results
Dataset construction

The phytomyxean P. brassicae and S. subterranea are
parasites of the plant genera Brassica and Solanum,
respectively, and the in vitro callus samples were prepared according to an unpublished protocol (Bulman et
al. submitted). Consequently, an unknown amount of
plant contamination was expected in the phytomyxean
ESTs. An initial blast examination showed that many of
the phytomyxid-callus contigs had high similarity to
plant sequences and were thus possibly derived from
the host cells. We took advantage of the large amount
of data available for Brassica and Solanum to filter out
these plant sequences and simplify data searching for
constructing the single-gene alignments (see Methods).
A total of 167 gene alignments with at least one rhizarian species represented in each were constructed for
phylogenetic analyses. Based on recently published
results suggesting close evolutionary affinities between
Rhizaria, stramenopiles and alveolates, forming the socalled SAR group [3,5,6], representatives for these 3
groups were included. The full dataset comprised 10
rhizarians, 9 stramenopiles, and 9 alveolates. In order to
reduce the risks of artifacts, 11 green plant taxa were
chosen to root our phylogenies because 1) of the availability of complete genomes for many lineages, thus
considerably reducing the amount of missing data in the
outgroup; 2) they have evolved more slowly comparatively to most of the SAR species; and 3) their relative
evolutionary proximity to the SAR group in the tree of
eukaryotes [4]. However, an alternative outgroup, haptophytes, was also tested as it was proposed to be more
closely related to the SAR group (data not shown) [7].

We did not select it for the final analyses because only
medium-sized EST datasets are available for a limited
number of species, except for one complete genome
(Emiliana huxleyi), and the intra-Rhizaria relationships
remained identical to the trees rooted using the green
plants (see below). Each single-gene dataset was thoroughly tested by bootstrapped maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses for deep paralogy or suspicious relationships possibly indicative of lateral gene transfer (LGT)
or contamination. The acanthareans are known to harbor zooxanthellae symbionts and polycystine radiolarians are hosts of prasinophytes, dinoflagellates and other
alveolates [29]. Accordingly, non-acantharean sequences
were expected to be found. Out of the 167 selected
genes, we could identify 1 sequence related to haptophytes in Astrolonche and Phyllostaurus, 2 sequences of
dinoflagellate origin in Astrolonche, 5 and 2 sequences
of general plant affinity in Astrolonche and Phyllostaurus, respectively, and, surprisingly, 25 sequences in
Astrolonche and 21 sequences in Phyllostaurus clearly
belonging to streptophytes (angiosperms). It is not clear
to us why streptophyte sequences were present in our
acantharean dataset, but one possible explanation could
be that the samples were contaminated with a small
amount of pollen. All these contaminant sequences were
removed from our alignments. The curated protein
alignments were concatenated into a supermatrix
amounting to 36,735 unambiguously aligned amino acid
positions (global percentage of missing data: 40%; see
Additional file 1 for details) that was subjected to phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses of the supermatrix

We analyzed our concatenated alignment using probabilistic methods of tree reconstruction with (i) empirical site-homogeneous models of sequence evolution in
ML (LG model) and Bayesian (WAG model) frameworks and (ii) site-heterogeneous mixture model in a
Bayesian framework (CAT model). Figures 1 and 2
depict the relationships inferred from these analyses.
The “LG” and “WAG” trees received maximal bootstrap
support proportions (BP) and posterior probabilities
(PP), respectively, for nearly all nodes (Figure 1). As
expected, the 3 major groups included in this study, i.e.
rhizarians, stramenopiles and alveolates, were strongly
recovered, and the relationships between and within
them corresponded to previously published trees [4,6,7].
All 3 analyses robustly supported the monophyly of the
four rhizarian phyla: Foraminifera, Acantharea, Phytomyxea and Cercozoa. Notably, Foraminifera were placed
as a sister group to Acantharea with 100% BP ("LG” and
“CAT”) and 1.0 PP ("WAG” and “CAT”). The branching
order within Rhizaria was identical and highly supported
in the “LG” and WAG” trees, with the Foraminifera +

Page 3 of 18

Acantharea clade being sister to Cercozoa and a group
composed of Phytomyxea and Gromia (Figure 1). On
the other hand, the site-heterogeneous CAT model
inferred a different topology that received low to high
PP and BP, recovering the Foraminifera + Acantharea
group in an internal position, sister to Gromia (0.93 PP;
90% BP) and more closely related to Phytomyxea (0.51
PP; 50% BP) to the exclusion of Cercozoa (Figure 2).
Because the discrepancies between the “LG” and “CAT”
topologies are an indication that some relationships may
be artifactual, we estimated the fit of these 2 models
based on a cross-validation test (see Methods). The
“CAT” model was found to much better fit the data
than the “LG” model with a score averaged over 10
replicates of 1547 ± 71 (all replicates favoured the
“CAT” model), indicating that the topology in Figure 1
is likely the results of biases not correctly handled by
the site-homogeneous models (LG and WAG).
To better evaluate these differences, a topology comparison analysis using the approximately unbiased (AU)
test was performed [30]. Both trees in figure 1 (P =
0.916) and in figure 2 (P = 0.084) were not rejected at
the 5% significance level. This test was based on the
comparison of trees obtained with 2 non-nested models,
“LG” (Figure 1) and “CAT” (Figure 2), using the “LG”
empirical matrix. Hence, if the topology in Figure 2 had
been rejected, it would not have been very informative
because the “CAT” model could still have inferred the
true tree. In the present case, however, the LG-based
AU test kept the “CAT” tree among the trees possibly
correctly describing the relationships within Rhizaria,
thus strengthening the branching pattern showed in
Figure 2. In addition, a topology with Acantharea alone
in a sister position to the rest of Rhizaria was also tested
in order to estimate the likelihood of the basal branching of Radiolaria seen in some SSU trees (see [16] for a
discussion). This topology was strongly rejected (P =
7e-09), further supporting the association of Foraminifera and Radiolaria.
Evaluating the branching order within Rhizaria

In our trees, both foraminiferans and acanthareans
appeared as fast-evolving taxa. This raised a concern
about their potentially erroneous grouping due to the
long branch attraction (LBA) artifact [31] that would
affect not only the position of these diverging lineages
but also the relationships among all rhizarian groups.
To evaluate for the possibility of LBA, we first conducted a fast-evolving taxa removal experience in which,
in turn, the most diverging foraminiferan representative
Reticulomyxa filosa (Figure 3), both foraminiferan
species (Figure 4), and the acanthareans (Figure 5)
were discarded. The removal of R. filosa had no
impact on the sister relationship of foraminiferans and

To assess the robustness of the ForaminiferaAcantharea clade and to further investigate the two
competing topologies for intra-Rhizaria relationships
(Figure 1 and 2), we then conducted a site removal analysis in which the fastest-evolving sites were progressively removed from the original alignment. The
rationale behind this analysis is that fast-evolving sites
are more likely to be saturated and not correctly interpreted as convergence by tree reconstruction methods,
thus strongly influencing the potential artifactual grouping of highly diverging lineages [32]. Specifically, we
tested 14 shorter alignments ranging from 35,230 aa to
14,281 aa and reconstructed phylogenetic trees with LG
and CAT models at each step to determine the support
value for several nodes of interest (Figure 6). First, the
highly supported association between Foraminifera and
Acantharea was not affected by the removal of fast-evolving sites, with almost no decrease in bootstrap values
even for the smallest number of positions remaining in
the alignment. This result provides additional evidence
that the grouping of Foraminifera and Acantharea is not
caused by artifacts of tree reconstruction. Second, we

acanthareans: both groups remained monophyletic with
maximum support. However, this slightly different taxon
sampling largely affected the branching order among the
rhizarian groups. The “LG” model robustly placed Gromia as the most closely related lineage to the Foraminifera + Acantharea group (93% BP), and Phytomyxea
were recovered as sister to this assemblage with 87% BP
(Figure 3A). The “CAT” model inferred the same topology (Figure 3B), which also corresponded to the full tree
inferred with this model (Figure 2) but, interestingly, the
support values increased from 0.92 to 1.0 PP and from
0.51 to 0.92 PP for the node joining Foraminifera +
Acantharea + Gromia and the node uniting Phytomyxea
to this group, respectively. Similarly, when Foraminifera
were removed altogether, both models again recovered
the “CAT” topology (Figure 2) with high BP and PP
values, exactly as in absence of Reticulomyxa only (Figure 3). Finally, discarding Acantharea led in both “LG”
and “CAT” analyses to the basal position of Foraminifera (98% BP; 0.73 PP) and the sister position of Gromia
to Phytomyxea (100% BP; 0.9 PP), as observed in the
complete “LG” tree (Figure 5 and Figure 1).

Number of removed sites

Figure 6 Site removal analysis. Figures (A) and (B) illustrate the bipartitions that were sought in the pool of trees generated by bootstrapped
ML reconstructions, corresponding to the “LG” (blue) and “CAT” (red) relationships, respectively. The monitored relationships are indicated as
followed: star: Foraminifera-Acantharea grouping; square: Gromia sister to Phytomyxea; diamond: basal position of the Foraminifera-Acantharea
clade within Rhizaria; cross: Gromia sister to the Foraminifera-Acantharea clade; circle: basal position of Cercozoa to the rest of rhizarian lineages.
(C) Dependence of the bootstrap support values (BP) for the monitored relationships on the number of removed fast-evolving sites, marked for
each of the 14 shorter alignments. The blue and red lines correspond to the BP of nodes found in the “LG” and “CAT” trees, respectively. The
black line corresponds to the BP for the Foraminifera-Acantharea grouping. The vertical dashed line shows the step (13’379 positions removed)
where the supports for the sister position of Retaria reached a minimum and the support for the sister position of Cercozoa a maximum.
Numbers next to the marks are PP obtained with the “CAT” model (PhyloBayes), resulting from the pooling of all trees after burnin of 2
independent chains and corresponding to the bifurcations found. At removal steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 only one PP value is shown next to the cross
mark, indicating that the CAT model could not infer the position of Phytomyxea within Rhizaria (multifurcation). The y-axis represents the BP and
the x-axis the length of the alignments after the removal of sites.

monitored the bootstrap supports for the sister position
of Gromia with respect to Phytomyxea, the basal position of the Foraminifera-Acantharea clade (as observed
in the “LG” tree, Figure 1), as well as the alternatives:
the sister grouping of Gromia to the ForaminiferaAcantharea group, and the basal position of Cercozoa
(as observed in the “CAT” tree, Figure 2). Interestingly,
as the fast-evolving sites were removed, the bootstrap
values for the phylogenetic relationships obtained in the
LG-based analysis of the complete dataset decreased
(Figure 6, blue line) and, at the same time, the branching order supported by the CAT-based reconstruction
gained statistical significance (Figure 6, red line). When
13’379 fast-evolving positions were removed, the LGbased analysis converged with high support (94% BP;
0.99 PP) towards the topology that was weakly suggested
by the CAT-based analysis of the complete dataset for
the association of Phytomyxea, Gromia, Foraminifera
and Acantharea, before diverging likely due to lack of
phylogenetic signal in the shortest alignments. The position of Gromia remained more ambiguous throughout
the removal process and, although the support for the
association with Phytomyxea rapidly decreased to below
50% BP, its sisterhood to the Foraminifera-Acantharea
clade suggested by the “CAT” model did not gain
significance.
Actin phylogeny

Although our multigene analysis represents the broadest rhizarian sampling to date, three important rhizarian groups, Haplosporidia, Filoreta, and Polycystinea,
are still missing. Therefore, we performed a separate
phylogenetic analysis based on actin, the only proteincoding gene sequenced in all rhizarian groups. ML
and Bayesian analyses of our alignment (317 amino
acid positions), containing 73 rhizarians and 6 stramenopiles as outgroup, indicated that the acantharean
Astrolonche possesses 2 actin paralogues branching as
sister groups to 2 of the actin paralogues present in
Foraminifera (Figure 7). The only actin sequence
found in Phyllostaurus grouped with Astrolonche as
sister to the foraminiferal paralogue 2. Sister to this
clade were two previously obtained actin sequences of
the polycystinean radiolarians Thalassicolla pellucida
and Collozoum inerme, and their grouping with
Acantharea and Foraminifera was strongly supported
in Bayesian inferences (0.99 and 1.0 with PhyloBayes
and MrBayes, respectively) but not supported in ML
(31% BP). However, the relationships between these 3
groups remained unresolved, leaving open the question of a possible radiolarian monophyly. For both
paralogues, Haplosporidia appeared as sister to the
Foraminifera + Radiolaria clade, albeit without much
support.

Rhizarian signatures

In addition to the multigene and actin analyses, we
screened our newly generated data for the presence of
molecular signatures characteristic of Rhizaria. First,
polyubiquitin sequences were searched for the 1 or 2
amino acid insertion previously described at the monomer-monomer junction in all Rhizaria except in Radiolaria [17,22]. We found threonine (T) in 4 sequences of
Astrolonche and one sequence of Phyllostaurus and alanine (A) in 6 sequences of Phyllostaurus (Figure 8A).
The presence of 2 different amino acids in Phyllostaurus
was surprising, but this is not exceptional as it has
already been observed in Lotharella amoeboformis
(AY099125) where both A and S insertions have been
found [17]. A serine (S) was also found in the Gromia
sphaerica sequence, which was identical to the available
polyubiquitin of Gromia oviformis (AY571670). In addition, a new polyubiquitin sequence amplified from the
phagomyxid Maullinia ectocarpii was included.
Interestingly, we identified a new insertion of 2 and 4
amino acids in the 60S ribosomal protein L10a, a characteristic also apparently unique to Rhizaria. A phenylalanine (F), an asparagine (N), and a serine (S) followed
by a lysine (K) were inserted at position 104 in G.
sphaerica, R. filosa, B. natans, and Paracercomonas sp.,
respectively (Figure 8B). In G. sphaerica, the sequence
contained 2 additional inserted amino acids, i.e. a valine
(V) and a glycine (G). Unfortunately, this gene was not
present in the acantharean dataset and several attempts
to amplify it by PCR failed. Blast searches against GenBank-nr and dbEST revealed no other known rpl10a
gene containing this insertion.

Discussion
This study provides the first robust evidence for a relationship between Foraminifera and Acantharea, a member of
Radiolaria. This result is rather surprising, taking into
account the considerable differences in morphology, composition of the skeleton, and lifestyle between these
groups. Radiolarians have intracellular celestite (SrSO4) (in
Acantharea) or siliceous (in Polycystinea) skeleton consisting of strontium sulphate and are holoplanktonic. In contrast, the foraminiferal skeleton (when present) is
extracellular, agglutinated or calcareous, and the majority
of foraminiferans are benthic. Pseudopodia morphology is
also markedly different: radiolarians possess stiff, ray-like
pseudopodia called axopodia, while foraminifers are
defined by the presence of fine, anastomosing granuloreticulopodia. Still, there are also common cell characteristics
shared between these 2 groups, the importance of which
must be re-evaluated in view of our data. For example, the
network of fine reticulopodia observed in some radiolarians exhibits bidirectional streaming, and is used for capturing prey and locomotion in a similar manner as the

foraminiferal granuloreticulopodia [29]. Further studies of
proteins involved in pseudopodial formation in both
groups are needed to examine these properties at the
molecular level. In that respect, it is interesting to note
that our acantharean ESTs contained an unusual betatubulin strongly resembling the highly diverging type 2
sequences reported in Foraminifera by [33], as well as a
less diverging isoform weakly grouping with a new foraminiferan beta-tubulin type (here named “type 3”) found in
R. filosa cDNA library (Additional file 2).
The clustering of Foraminifera and Acantharea
observed in our analyses partially confirms the Retaria
hypothesis [26]. Although multigene data for the 2 other
main groups of Radiolaria, Polycystinea and Taxopodida,
are still unavailable, we predict that they will also group
with Foraminifera. This relationship is suggested by the
phylogenetic position of three fast-evolving sequences of
polycystinean actin as sister to foraminiferan actin paralogue 2 [19] as well as by the grouping of Foraminifera
with environmental clones assigned to Polycystinea and
Sticholonche in an analysis of combined SSU and LSU
rDNA [25,34]. However, the branching order of these
groups was uncertain and Foraminifera may in fact
branch within the radiolarian clade, suggesting that
Radiolaria (Radiozoa) could be paraphyletic [25,34,35].
The next challenge will be testing whether this surprising pattern arises due to an artifact of LBA, and testing
the monophyly of radiolarians.
Further effort is also required to resolve the relationships among the rhizarian groups. Thus far, all phylogenetic studies of this supergroup have recovered
Radiolaria alone, or together with Foraminifera as the
most basal clade [16]. The latter topology was supported
by our LG and WAG-based tree reconstructions (Figure
1), but not by the Bayesian inference with the CAT
model (Figure 2). Instead, this method suggested that
Retaria are closely related to Gromia and Phytomyxea, to
the exclusion of Cercozoa. Although this association
received only low support with the full dataset, it was
strengthen by the experiments with the foraminiferans or
the fast-evolving sites removed, as well as by the AU and
cross-validation tests. The removal of R. filosa was particularly informative in indicating that this species alone
could have attracted Retaria at the base of Rhizaria in the
“LG” tree, due to its high rate of evolution. Indeed, when
it was not included, the topology suggested by the “CAT”
model was robustly recovered. Acanthareans, on the
other hand, seemed to be less prone to LBA as they consistently branched in a derived position when both foraminiferans were removed. The fast-evolving sites removal
analysis also convincingly supported the grouping of
Retaria, Gromia, and Phytomyxea, and was in agreement
with the properties of the CAT model; it has been shown
that this model infers homoplasies better than empirical

Page 13 of 18

models (such as the LG model used in the RAxML analyses) [36]. Therefore, it might be interpreted that for our
complete dataset, the CAT model detected and correctly
interpreted more of the saturated positions that were
misleading in the RAxML analysis. Within this group,
the position of Gromia could not be inferred with
precision as it branched either as sister to Retaria or Phytomyxea. However, the grouping of Gromia with Phytomyxea was recovered only when Acantharea were absent
or R. filosa was included in the analyses with the “LG”
model. Moreover, the better fitted CAT model robustly
placed Gromia in a sister position to Retaria. Interestingly, the association of Foraminifera, Acantharea, Gromia and Phytomyxea has never been described, although
SSU and actin trees showed generally unsupported relationships between some but not all lineages [37,38]. In
addition, other lineages, such as Haplosporidia or Filoreta
also belong to this group and will likely be crucial for
resolving the internal branching order.
Finally, our study clarifies the question whether
acanthareans and polycystines truly lack the rhizarianspecific polyubiquitin insertion, as previously reported
[22]. To explain the apparent absence of the insertion in
these two groups, it has been proposed that it was lost in
radiolarians, or was acquired after their divergence [22].
In our EST data, both acantharean species feature polyubiquitin sequences with the insertion, suggesting that the
sequences presented in [22] were not of acantharean origin, but perhaps originated from unidentified symbionts.

Conclusions
Our multigene analysis elucidates the relationship
between two important rhizarian phyla, Foraminifera
and Radiolaria (Acantharea), which has been a matter of
recent controversy. Because Acantharea do not fully
represent the radiolarian diversity and genomic data for
other important groups (Polycystinea and Taxopodida)
is still missing, we cannot rule out the possibility that
Radiolaria are paraphyletic. Nevertheless, our study
strongly indicates that a basal position of Radiolaria
with respect to the rest of Rhizaria is highly unlikely.
Instead, our analysis suggests a novel grouping including
Foraminifera, Radiolaria, Gromia and Phytomyxea.
Within this group, Gromia might be most closely
related to Foraminifera and Radiolaria, but its specific
phylogenetic position will depend on other important
lineages such as Haplosporidia or Filoreta.

Acanthareans were collected during May-June 2008 at
the outlet of the Villefranche Bay, Mediterranean sea
(43°41’N; 7°18’48E). Plankton samples were taken using
a plankton net (mesh diameter 20 μm) drawn vertically
from the depth of 200 to 0 m. Concentrated samples
were immediately brought to the lab and processed. Living acanthareans were picked from the plankton with
needles, washed with filtered seawater and placed in
RNAlater solution (Ambion). The solution was allowed
to penetrate into the cells for 24 hours at 4°C, after
which the samples were kept frozen until further processing. In total about 300 cells of Phyllostaurus and 50
cells of Astrolonche were collected and used for library
preparation.
The 2 phytomyxean samples were prepared from in
vitro grown callus consisting of S. subterranea infected
Solanum tuberosum cells and P. brassicae infected Brassica rapa cells, respectively. Full details of the generation, growth and characterization of these callus lines
will be detailed elsewhere (Bulman et al. submitted).
Briefly, sections of S. subterranea or P. brassicae root
galls were surface sterilized and placed on MS media.
Segments of white/green multiplying cells were transferred to new media as they proliferated. Fresh green
callus cells were harvested and transferred into RNAlater (Qiagen).
Preparation of cDNA libraries for 454 sequencing

The G. sphaerica cDNA library was prepared from
approximately half of an individual, as described in [39],
with minor modifications (described below) that ensured
enrichment of the data with protein-coding sequences.
Briefly, the methodology involves cDNA synthesis and
amplification using SMARTer cDNA synthesis kit
(TaKaRa BIO/Clontech, Mountain View, CA), normalization using Trimmer kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russian
Federation), fragmentation by sonication, end-polishing,
ligation of adaptors, and amplification of the 454-ready
sample. The design of the adaptors ensures that the
sequencing proceeds only from the cDNA breaks introduced by sonication, rather than from original termini,
which helps to reduce the amount of adaptor-derived
sequences in the resulting data.
For acanthareans, we originally prepared the libraries
from 100 Phyllostaurus and 20 Astrolonche cells using
the same protocol without normalization, but after Sanger-sequencing 24 randomly picked clones per species
we found that the libraries consisted predominantly of
non-coding sequences, most likely representing 3’-UTRs
of the original transcripts. To enrich our libraries with
the coding regions, we amplified the SMARTer kitsynthesied cDNA with a long primer (5’-AGTGGACTATCCATGAACGCAAAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3’) at a concentration of 0.1 μM, instead of using

the one included in the kit, which resulted in preferential amplification of the longest cDNA fragments due to
mild PCR-suppression effect [40]. Moreover, after fragmentation and adaptor ligation, only the 5’-ends of the
original cDNAs were amplified and subjected to sequencing, by using the primer annealing to the ligated
sequencing adaptor [39] and the primer matching
to the unique sequence of the template-switch oligonucleotide used during the cDNA synthesis (5’GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGCCGCGCAGGTACGTATCAACGCAGAGTACGCGG-3’). The libraries were
sequenced using 454 GS-FLX. The latest version of the
cDNA preparation protocol, adapted for the latest 454
version (Titanium), is available on Matzlab website [41].
For the 2 phytomyxean species, cDNA libraries were
constructed by Vertis Biotechnology AG (Germany)
according to their Random-Primed (RPD) cDNA protocol. Frozen cells were ground under liquid nitrogen and
total RNA isolated from the cell powder using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Poly(A)+ RNA was
prepared from total RNA. First-strand cDNA synthesis
was primed with an N6 randomized primer and secondstrand cDNA was synthesized according to the classical
Gubler-Hoffman protocol [42]. Double stranded DNA
(dsDNA) was blunted and 454 adapters A and B ligated
at the 5’ and 3’ ends. dsDNA carrying both adapter A
and adapter B attached to its ends was selected and
amplified with PCR using a proof reading enzyme
(24 cycles). For 454 sequencing the cDNA in the size
range of 250 - 600 bp was eluted from a preparative
agarose gel.
Contig assembly and sequence alignment

All newly generated reads were assembled into contigs
using the Newbler assembler with default parameters,
generating the following number of contigs larger than
100 bp: G. sphaerica, 24,433; Astrolonche sp., 6426;
Phyllostaurus sp., 5056; P. brassicae, 27,333; S. subterranea, 14,531. To filter plant sequences out of the phytomyxean datasets, the phytomyxid-callus contigs were
compared to plant cDNA sequences using the BLAT
tool [43] and those with very high similarity were discarded (e-value threshold < 1e-50). The 27,333 P. brassicae contigs (containing B. rapa) were compared against
2,529,141 Brassicaceae ESTs (NCBI as of 25 March
2009, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and resulted in
24,166 contigs showing nearly identical hits. The 14,531
S. subterranea contigs (containing S. tuberosum) were
compared to 1,000,784 Solanaceae ESTs (NCBI as of 25
March 2009, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), giving 8,282
contigs with a nearly identical hit. Manual inspection
(using blastn) of a subset of the filtered sequences confirmed that these were indeed likely to originate from
the plant host cells. The remaining 3,167 P. brassicae

Burki et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:377
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/377

contigs with low or no hit against the Brassicaceae ESTs
and the 6,249 S. subterranea contigs with low or no hit
against the Solanaceae ESTs were used in subsequent
screenings.
Blast searches against databases containing the 5 species above and taxa downloaded from GenBank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and JGI (http://genome.jgi-psf.
org/) were performed to retrieve the genes of interest
(see Table S1 for the list of species). These genes corresponded in part to genes that we used in previous
phylogenomic studies [3,4,7], but also to 55 genes
representing additional members of large protein
families that were not previously included in our alignment, such as more minichromosome maintenance
proteins (MCM) or more proteasome subunits, but
also several new ribosomal proteins and proteins for
which a broad sampling was available (see Additional
file 3 for a list of the newly added genes). In total, 202
single-gene alignments were constructed, automatically
aligned with Mafft [44], using Gblocks [45] to remove
ambiguously aligned positions (with half of the gapped
positions allowed, the minimum number of sequences
for a conserved and a flank position set to 50% of the
number of taxa plus one, the maximum of contiguous
non-conserved positions set to 12, and the minimum
length of a block set to 5) and followed by manual
adjustment when needed with BioEdit [46]. The
orthology and possible contamination in each gene was
tested by ML reconstructions with 100 bootstrap replicates using RAxML 7.2.2 (LG substitution matrix) [47],
and visual check of the resulting individual trees. Out
of the complete set of 202 genes, 23 showed evidence
for deep paralogy and were therefore discarded. In
addition, we also excluded 12 extra genes as they did
not contain any species of Rhizaria. Our final dataset
contained 167 genes, which represented 36,735 amino
acid positions after concatenation, and 39 species
belonging to Rhizaria, stramenopiles, alveolates and
green plants (outgroup). The single-gene and concatenated alignments are available at http://www.fabienburki.com. A table listing all genes and a detailed view
of the missing data repartition for each taxa can be
found in Additional file 1. The 167 trees constructed
from the final selection of genes are available in Additional file 4. Since many of the Phytomyxea contigs
were short due to the relatively small number of contigs that were obtained from the phytomyxid parasites,
35 genes were chosen as targets for further sequence
acquisition. PCR primers were designed based on the
short contigs and longer DNA sequences were
obtained by RT-PCR or 3’RACE using the callus RNA
as template (as in [48]). Scafos 1.2.5 [49] was used for
performing the concatenation process of the singlegenes.

The actin and beta-tubulin alignments were built by
retrieving from GenBank sequences belonging to all rhizarian (actin) or eukaryotic (beta-tubulin) groups, and
adding to them the sequences identified in the datasets
generated in this study. 72 rhizarian and 6 stramenopiles
(outgroup) sequences were included in the actin tree;
119 eukaryotes were analyzed for the beta-tubulin tree.
We also searched our datasets for the 1 or 2 amino
acids insertion at the monomer-monomer junctions carried in most rhizarian species. Finally, the construction
of the single-gene alignments revealed a rhizarian specific insertion of 2 amino acids in the 60S ribosomal
protain L10a.
Phylogenetic analyses

ML analyses were performed using RAxML 7.2.2 [47] in
combination with the LG amino acid replacement
matrix [50]. The best ML tree was determined with the
PROTGAMMA + F implementation in multiple inferences using 10 randomized parsimony starting trees.
Statistical support was evaluated with 100 bootstrap
replicates. Bayesian analysis using the WAG + G + F
model (4 gamma categories) was done with the parallel
version of MrBayes 3.1.2 [51]. The inference consisted
of 1,000,000 generations with sampling every 100 generations, starting from a random starting tree and using
4 Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMCMC). 2 separate runs were performed to confirm the convergence of the chains. The average standard deviation of split frequencies was used to assess
the convergence of the 2 runs. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated from the majority rule consensus of the tree sampled after the initial burnin period as
determined by checking the convergence of likelihood
values across MCMCMC generations (corresponding to
50’000 generations). PhyloBayes 3.1 [52] was run using
the site-heterogeneous mixture CAT model with the
rates-across-sites heterogeneity handled by a Dirichlet
process (ratecat). 2 independent Markov chains with a
total length of 19’000 cycles were performed, discarding
the first 2’000 points as burnin, and calculating the posterior consensus on the remaining trees. Convergence
between the 2 chains was ascertained by examining the
difference in frequency for all their bipartitions (< 0.1 in
all analyses). Bootstrap CAT proportions were obtained
after 5000 cycles with a conservative burnin of 1000 on
100 pseudo-replicates generated with Seqboot (Phylip
package [53]). Manual verification of 10 replicates
showed that the burnin is generally between 500-700
cycles. For each replicate, trees were collected after the
initial burnin period and a consensus tree was computed
by readpb (PhyloBayes package). Consense (Phylip package [53]) was then used to calculate the bootstrap support based on these 100 consensus trees. Due to limited

Burki et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:377
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/377

size of single-genes for parameter estimation under nonparametric models such as CAT, the PhyloBayes-based
actin and beta-tubulin phylogenies were ran under the
LG model.
The site-removal analysis was performed using PAML
[54] to identify the fast-evolving sites, as implemented
in the AIR package [55]. Because the topology chosen to
estimate the site-wise rates strongly influences the
results [32], rates were calculated for the 105 possible
different topologies describing the evolutionary relationships of the 5 rhizarian lineages, and sorted according to
the mean of the rates estimated on all topologies. 5% to
90% (10% intervals between 10% and 50%, 5% intervals
between 55% and 90%) of the fastest evolving sites were
then removed (percentage of the total rate distribution),
and bootstrapped ML analyses were run with each of
these 14 shorter alignments. PhyloSort [56] was used to
search the pseudo-replicate trees for the relationships of
interest. Phylobayes analyses with the CAT model were
also done on each reduced alignment.
The statistical model comparison was done using the
cross-validation (CV) method available in PhyloBayes
3.1 [52]. A learning and a test sets were generated by
randomly splitting (no replacement) the original alignment into 10 replicates made of 90% and 10% of the original sites, respectively. Each of the learning and test
alignments amounted to 33,062 and 3673 positions,
respectively. A MCMC run was performed for each
replicate under a fixed topology (either the “CAT” or
“LG” tree) for a total of 5000 cycles ("CAT”) or 1500
cycles ("LG”). Due to technical reasons associated with
this test in PhyloBayes, a discrete gamma distribution
with 4 categories was used for modelling the rate heterogeneity across site (i.e. dgam instead of ratecat). This
slightly different model should not affect the conclusions
given the big difference between CAT and LG. The
lower number of cycles under “LG” was due to a much
greater computational time per cycle as compared to
when the “CAT” model was used. The first 500 and 150
points were discarded as burnin for the “CAT” and
“LG” runs, respectively, and the remaining points used
to compute the cross-validation log-likelihood.
Topology comparisons were conducted using the
approximately unbiased (AU) test [30]. For each tested
tree, site likelihoods were calculated using RAxML 7.2.2
with the LG model and the AU test was performed
using CONSEL [57].
