Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) subspecies vary widely in both pathogenicity and
host specificity, but the genetic features contributing to this diversity remain unclear.
Results: A comparative genomic approach was used to identify large sequence polymorphisms
among M. avium subspecies obtained from a variety of host animals. DNA microarrays were used
as a platform for comparing mycobacterial isolates with the sequenced bovine isolate M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) K-10. Open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as present or
divergent based on the relative fluorescent intensities of the experimental samples compared to
MAP K-10 DNA. Multiple large polymorphic regions were found in the genomes of MAP isolates
obtained from sheep. One of these clusters encodes glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis enzymes which
have not previously been identified in MAP. M. avium subsp. silvaticum isolates were observed to
have a hybridization profile very similar to yet distinguishable from M. avium subsp. avium. Isolates
obtained from cattle (n = 5), birds (n = 4), goats (n = 3), bison (n = 3), and humans (n = 9) were
indistinguishable from cattle isolate MAP K-10.
Conclusion: Genome diversity in M. avium subspecies appears to be mediated by large sequence
polymorphisms that are commonly associated with mobile genetic elements. Subspecies and host
adapted isolates of M. avium were distinguishable by the presence or absence of specific
polymorphisms.

Background
Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) subspecies represent a
closely related group of mycobacteria that are commonly
found in the environment; some of which are frequently
associated with infections of birds and ruminants. The M.
avium subspecies are distinguished from each other by
nucleic acid hybridization [1,2] along with growth charac-

teristics [3]. M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is
the causative agent of Johne's disease, a chronic and economically significant infection primarily of ruminant animals characterized by a prolonged subclinical phase
leading eventually to a severe gastroenteritis which results
in malnutrition and ultimately death. Much remains to be
elucidated regarding the pathogenesis and population

genetics of MAP. Specifically, it remains unclear what
MAP virulence factors are important for both infection
and persistence, and despite observed phenotypic and
genetic differences between MAP isolates obtained from
sheep and cattle, the biological basis for host specificity
remains unclear.
Previous work in our laboratory has utilized DNA microarrays to compare the genome content of members of the
M. avium complex (MAC) which includes MAP, M. avium
subspecies avium (MAA), M. avium subspecies silvaticum
(MAS), M. avium subspecies hominissuis (MAH) and M.
intracellulare [4]. These findings revealed that non-MAP
MAC isolates do not contain several large regions of
genomic DNA that are present in MAP K-10. Extensive
genomic conservation was observed for the MAP isolates
examined in the study, most of which were obtained from
cattle [4]. Recently, Marsh and coworkers have described
the presence of several large sequence polymorphisms
among sheep and cattle isolates of MAP [5,6], while Semret et al have reported on the presence of polymorphic
regions that are shared between MAA and MAP sheep isolates [7]. The biological consequence of these large
sequence polymorphisms has not yet been determined.
In the work presented here, we have utilized a DNA
microarray constructed with oligonucleotides representing all of the predicted coding and intergenic regions from
the MAP K-10 genome as well as the remaining novel coding sequences from the MAH 104 [8] genome to examine
the genome content of M. avium subspecies obtained
from a variety of host animals. We hypothesize that genes
found to be polymorphic among M. avium subspecies isolated from different hosts will serve as ideal targets for
future studies designed to elucidate the biological basis of
host specificity and pathogenicity.

Results
Validation of microarray sensitivity and specificity
The reference isolate MAP K-10 was compared to the
sequenced MAH isolate 104 in order to evaluate the performance of the oligonucleotide microarray as a platform
for comparative genomic hybridizations. The hybridizations and data analyses were performed as described in
the Materials and Methods, and the resulting intensity
ratios for each oligonucleotide probe were matched to the
BLASTn score of the probe when searched against the
complete genomes of MAP K-10 and MAH 104. Probe
sequences with an E-value of greater than 1 × 10-5 were
identified as not present in the reference genome. The distribution of log transformed hybridization intensity ratios
(MAH 104/MAP K-10) is presented in Figure 1. A majority
of the probes (75%) were observed to have ratios falling
between -0.5 and 0.5, as would be expected for the
genomes of these closely related mycobacteria. The distri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/135

bution of MAP K-10 specific probes peaked below a log
ratio of -1.0, with a majority of the probes having ratios
lower than this. Mirroring this trend, the MAH 104 specific probes peaked above a log ratio of 1.0 with most of
the probes observed to have ratios greater than this. Only
five of the MAP K-10 specific probes had positive log
ratios, while only three of the MAH 104 specific probes
had negative log ratios. In both cases, the log ratios of
these outlying probes fell within the range of -0.5 to 0.5.
Based on these reference hybridizations, we predict that
probes on the MAP K-10 microarray with log ratios greater
than 1.2 can be identified as absent from the MAP K-10
genome, while probes with log ratios less than -1.2 are
missing from the test isolates relative to MAP K-10. Utilizing these cutoffs, both the false positive and false negative
rates are less than 1%.
Sheep genomotype
A similar genomic profile was observed for MAP sheep
isolates 397, 467, 7565, and 9040. These sheep isolates
were distinguished from the other MAP isolates examined
in this study by the presence of four clusters of ORFs
homologous to sequences found in the MAH 104 genome
but absent in MAP K-10. Additionally, these isolates are
missing three clusters of ORFs that are present in the other
MAP isolates examined. The sheep isolate 9040 also
appears to be a member of this genomotype, although the
observed differences in hybridization intensity compared
to MAP K-10 are not as pronounced as the other isolates
(Figure 2).

Consistent with previous findings, we identified several
regions that were present in MAP sheep isolates and MAH,
but not in MAP cattle isolates. These included the MAH
104 ORFs MAH1834-1858 (Figure 2). This region was
partially identified as the 197 bp sequence PIG-RDA 20
(AY266301) and was mapped to a 197 Kbp segment of
the MAH 104 genome by Dohmann and coworkers [9]
and was subsequently described by Semret and coworkers
as LSPA4-II [7] (Table 1). This region contains a copy of
the IS1311 insertion sequence (MAH1844) and within
the MAH 104 genome is flanked by an additional copy of
IS1311 (MAH1833). Another previously described LSP
included ORFs MAH4893 through MAH4910 (Table 1).
This region was partially identified as the 233 bp sequence
PIG-RDA10 (AY266300), mapped to a 16 Kbp segment of
the MAH 104 genome [9] and the full sequence was later
identified as LSPA18 [7].
Several new or only partially described LSPs common to
MAP sheep and MAH isolates were identified in the
present study. One of the genomic regions included ORFs
MAH2772 – 2791 (Figure 2 and Table 1). This gene cluster
was partially identified as the 548 bp sequence PIG-RDA
30 (AY266302) and was mapped to a 27 Kbp region on

the MAH 104 genome [9]. This cluster of genes encodes
several proteins that may contribute to pathogenesis.
MAH2777 is predicted to encode a cytochrome P450
enzyme. Members of this enzyme family have been implicated in basic cellular processes as well as virulence
(reviewed in [10]). MAH2782 is homologous to an arylsulfatase characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and like
other sulfatases may modulate mycobacterial interactions
with host cells (reviewed in [11]). This gene cluster is also

characterized by the presence of several genes encoding
putative proteins involved in lipid and energy metabolism. Seven of the identified genes encode proteins with
no predicted function.
Another novel LSP found in MAP sheep and MAH isolates
but absent from MAP cattle isolates was comprised of
ORFs MAH3041 – 3052 (3,399,659 – 3,411,697) which
are predicted to encode proteins involved in the biosyn-

thesis of glycopeptidolipids [12,13] (Table 1). Sequencing
of this region in the sheep isolate MAP 397 revealed the
presence of additional ORFs (hyp, hlpA, gdhgA and gtfC)
with homology to glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis genes
immediately downstream of MAH3052 (gtfB in Figure 3).
These additional ORFs were not homologous to any MAH
104 sequences (and thus were not detected by the microarray analysis) but rather were homologous to MAA
TMC724 (ATCC 25291), a serovar 2 isolate of MAA. A
direct comparison of the glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis
gene clusters from MAP 397 and MAA TMC724 (accession
number AF125999) revealed that they are approximately
99% identical with the exception of a deletion at the 5'
end of mtfA as well as the absence of the insertion
sequence IS2534 from the MAP 397 locus (Figure 3).
Despite the presence of these genes, no glycopeptidolipids
have been observed to be produced by sheep isolates of
MAP under standard in vitro culture conditions (T. Eckstein, personal communication); therefore, the practical
contribution of glycopeptidolipids to the pathogenesis of
MAP sheep isolates remains unclear at this point.
A putative transcriptional regular labeled as MAH315 in
MAH 104 was identified by microarray hybridization as
present in MAP sheep isolates. This ORF was subsequently
confirmed as present in the MAP 397 genome by sequencing. The protein encoded by MAH315 has homology to
the GntR-family of transcriptional regulators which are
widely distributed across bacterial species and regulate a
variety of cellular processes [14,15].
A second subset of LSPs were characterized as being
present in all MAP isolates with the exception of the sheep
genomotype. Several of these MAP sheep isolate deletions
have already been described. The deletion encompassing
MAP1485c – 1491 was previously identified by Marsh
and coworkers as S strain deletion #1 and by Semret and
coworkers as LSPA20 [5,7] (Table 2). An additional deletion in the sheep genomotype included the cluster of
ORFs between MAP1728c and MAP1744 (Table 2). This
deletion was partially identified by Marsh and coworkers
as RDA3 [6], and later fully described as S deletion #2 [5].
MAP2325 was identified as being absent from Australian
sheep isolates of MAP [5]. This ORF was not identified as
missing from the MAP sheep isolates examined in this
study, and subsequent sequencing of this region in MAP
397 confirmed the presence of an ORF with 100% identity
to MAP2325. Although further examination of this observation is warranted, this discrepancy may represent a geographic difference between MAP isolates recovered from
sheep in Australia and the United States.
A novel LSP comprised of the ORFs MAP1432 – 1438c
was identified in the present study as absent from sheep
MAP isolates (Table 2). This gene cluster is predicted to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/135

encode four energy metabolism enzymes as well as a
lipase (MAP1438c). MAP1432 encodes a hypothetical
protein with homology to the REP13E12 family of repetitive elements that were originally described in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and have been shown to be targets of
phage integration [16]. MAP2656 was initially identified
as absent via microarray analysis but sequencing of MAP
397 identified a homologue with 100% identity. This represents the only observed discrepancy between the microarray and sequencing results.
Avium-silvaticum genomotype
The genome profile of MAP sheep isolate 5001 was unlike
the other isolates obtained from sheep that were examined in this study. This isolate grouped together with four
independent laboratory stocks of what has historically
been referred to as M. avium strain 18 [17-22] as well as
five isolates of MAS (Figure 2). Additionally, two isolates
of MAA (ATCC25291 and ATCC35719) were observed to
have genomic profiles similar to this group. The hybridization pattern of these isolates is collectively referred to
here as the avium-silvaticum genomotype.

Similar to the MAP sheep isolates, the avium-silvaticum
genomotype isolates contained LSPs that are absent from
MAP cattle isolates but present in MAH 104. They possessed the MAH3041-3052 and MAH4893-4910 gene
clusters also found in MAP sheep isolates; however, they
did not possess the MAH1834-1858 or MAH2772-2791
clusters of MAH 104 ORFs (Figure 2 and Table 1). These
isolates contained additional LSPs homologous to the
MAH 104 genome. A cluster of MAH 104 ORFs including
MAH4657-4665 (5,122,587–5,131,447) was present in
the avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates. The ORFs in
this LSP are predicted to encode proteins that function as
transcriptional regulators and dehydrogenases, while several have no known function. A second LSP with homology to the MAH 104 genome included ORFs MAH47044709 (5,173,587–5,179,816) (Table 1). With the exception of two ORFs predicted to encode components of a
restriction modification system, the remaining coding
sequences present in this LSP have no predicted function.
Several LSPs comprised of MAP K-10 ORFs were absent
from the avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates (Figure
2). In many cases, the avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates were distinguished from each other by these LSPs.
Isolates 6007 and 6049 lack a cluster of ORFs between
MAP0746 and MAP0766c (Figure 2 and Table 2). This LSP
was present in all of the other isolates examined and verified in selected isolates by PCR (Table 3). Included within
this LSP are nine ORFs homologous to mammalian cell
entry gene clusters [23,24]. The other ORFs in this cluster
encoded degradation enzymes or had no predicted function. The avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates were also

missing ORFs MAP1376-1381, which were also absent in
the hominissuis genomotype isolates 5835cc and 5836cc
described below (Table 2). The absence of this region was
verified by PCR with primers designed for representative
ORFs (Table 3). The MAS isolates 6007, 6049, 6058, and
ATCC49884 were distinguished from all the other isolates
examined by the absence of ORFs MAP1424c-1464 (Table
2). This LSP includes a gene cluster that was identified as
absent from the sheep genomotype (MAP1432-1438c). A
large number of the ORFs included in this region (n = 16)
are predicted to be involved in lipid metabolism. Notably,
just as the smaller sheep isolate LSP was flanked by a
REP13E12 family repetitive element (MAP1432), the
larger MAS LSP is also flanked by a REP13E12 element
(MAP1465) in MAP K-10. The isolates 5001, 6006, 6058,

and ATCC49884 lack the ORF clusters MAP2372-2375c
and MAP3063-3079c (Table 2). These LSPs were present
in all of the other isolates examined and contain ORFs primarily encoding proteins with no predicted functions,
although MAP3069-3071 encode proteins that are predicted to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis.
MAH2829-2830 were identified as present only in isolates
ATCC35719, ATCC25291, and 6071 as well as the strain
18 isolates.
All of the avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates were also
observed to have greater amounts of probe hybridized to
the oligonucleotide target representing MAP3814c relative to MAP K-10 (Figure 2). This ORF is 31% identical to
transposase sequences and may represent part of an insertion sequence that is present in multiple copies within
MAS and MAA genomes. The MAP K-10 ORFs immediately downstream of MAP3814c (MAP3815-3818) are
missing in both the avium-silvaticum and hominissuis
genomotype isolates based on the microarray hybridization results. Notably, ORFs MAP3815-3817 lack homology to any other sequences deposited in Genbank. This
appears to provide an additional example of mycobacterial genome diversity mediated by a mobile genetic element.
The avium-silvaticum genomotype isolates could be further separated into two subgroups based on their genomic
hybridization profiles. One group included the isolate
5001 and the isolates originally identified as MAS, while
the other consisted of the MAA and strain 18 isolates,
which the exception of isolate 6071. While both groups of
isolates displayed very similar hybridization profiles, they
could be distinguished by the polymorphic regions
MAP1424c-1464 and MAH2829-2830. The consistent
genomic profile amongst the strain 18 isolates obtained
from independent laboratories suggests that these isolates
have not experienced significant genomic polymorphisms
despite several decades of laboratory use. Additionally,
these results indicate that the microarray platform used in
this study provides reproducible results when comparing
isolates.
Hominissuis genomotype
Three of the MAP isolates examined (7265, 7301, and
9034) had hybridization profiles similar to MAH 104 and
are collectively referred to as the hominissuis genomotype. Also included with these isolates were two mycobacterial isolates (5835cc and 5836cc) from a duck, which
were distinguished from each other upon culture by pigmentation. This group is characterized by the absence of
several genes and LSPs that are present in MAP, as well as
the presence of additional LSPs not found in MAP. Many
of these LSPs are shared with the MAS and MAA isolates
examined in this study. The sequenced MAP K-10 and

Page 8 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:135

MAH 104 genomes have been previously compared with
both bioinformatic and experimental approaches, including DNA microarrays [4,25-28]. The LSP that includes
ORFs MAP1230-1237c appears to be a distinguishing factor of the hominissuis genotype as these ORFs were absent
from this genomotype but present in all of the other isolates examined in this study (Table 1). This LSP corresponds to the region previously identified by Tizard and
coworkers as a low-GC genetic island present only in MAP
and MAS [29]. Isolates 5835cc and 5836cc were distinguished from the other hominissuis genomotype isolates
by several polymorphic regions. MAP0072c-0076 is
absent from both isolates and includes several genes that
are predicted to encode membrane proteins, while the
deletion of MAP2523c-2532 includes several enzymes
involved in energy metabolism (Figure 2). The hybridization profiles of the remaining hominissuis genomotype
isolates closely mirrored MAH 104.
Cattle genomotype
The remaining MAP isolates examined in this study displayed hybridization profiles similar to the sequenced cattle isolate MAP K-10 and are collectively referred to as the
cattle genomotype. The distinguishing feature of this
genomotype is the large variety of host species represented. This group includes isolates obtained from cattle
(n = 5), birds (n = 4), goats (n = 3), bison (n = 3), humans
(n = 9), a cat, and an armadillo (Figure 2). Relative to the
MAP K-10 genome, no LSPs were observed in any of the
cattle genomotype isolates.

virulence, and transcriptional regulation. The regions containing homologues to ORFs in the MAH 104 genome (n
= 73) encoded proteins involved in glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis, transcriptional regulation, virulence, and
metabolism. These polymorphic regions also contained a
number of proteins with unknown function. The remaining sheep (5001 and 9034) and cattle (7265 and 7301)
MAP isolates had genomic profiles similar to MAH or
MAS.
The identification of a glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis
operon in sheep isolates of MAP raises several interesting
possibilities. Considering the absence of glycopeptidolipids in cattle isolates of MAP, it may contribute to the phenotypic differences observed between the two isolate
types, although the production of glycopeptidolipids by
sheep MAP isolates has not yet been experimentally verified. Glycopeptidolipids from MAA have been identified
as Toll-like receptor 2 agonists that are capable of activating macrophages [30]. Sequencing of this region indicates
that the sheep isolate glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis cluster is most similar to a serovar 2 isolate of MAA (ATCC
25291) rather than the sequenced serovar 1 isolate MAH
104. ATCC 25291 was examined as part of this study,
however, since no sequence data from this isolate was
present on the microarray, the presence or absence of
these genes was not detected by hybridization. These
results suggest that additional insights into the pathogenicity and evolutionary history of MAP sheep isolates
may be gained by a closer examination of MAA serovar 2
genomes.

Discussion
The use of specific genetic markers has allowed MAP isolates to be separated into two general populations: a relatively homogenous group comprised of primarily bovine
isolates and a more heterogeneous group that includes
isolates from small ruminants and other mammals. The
goal of the present study was to identify variations in total
genome content between M. avium subspecies isolated
from several different host animals in order to determine
which genes may contribute to host specificity and pathogenesis. The isolates obtained from goat (n = 3), bison (n
= 3), bird (n = 4), armadillo (n = 1), cat (n = 1), and
human (n = 10) hosts did not contain any large polymorphic regions when compared with the MAP K-10 cattle
isolate. Five of the seven cattle isolates examined similarly
did not contain any large polymorphisms. The remaining
isolates (n = 7) grouped into three distinct genomotypes.
Four of the six sheep isolates examined (397, 467, 7565
and 9040) shared large polymorphisms that included the
absence of ORFs present in the MAP K-10 genome as well
as the presence of ORFs that are also found in the MAH
104 genome. The ORFs included in the missing regions (n
= 32) are predicted to encode proteins involved in a variety of functions including lipid and energy metabolism,

This study provides some of the first molecular evidence
that distinguishes MAS from other M. avium subspecies.
The MAS and MAA isolates examined in this study were
observed to have very similar genomic hybridization profiles, but could be distinguished by several large sequence
polymorphisms. Specifically, the silvaticum and avium
subspecies could generally be separated from each other
by the presence or absence of the polymorphic regions
MAP1424c-1465 and MAH2829-2830. Isolate 5001 was
grouped together with the classical MAS wood pigeon isolates. This isolate was originally isolated from a sheep that
appeared to be suffering from Johne's Disease. It is noteworthy that in a previous study by Burrells and coworkers
MAS was also cultured from sheep that were diagnosed
with Johne's Disease [31]. The silvaticum genomotype
isolates share some distinguishing genome features with
the MAP sheep isolates, including all or part of three LSPs.
It is unclear whether the recovery of MAS isolates from
diseased animals is due to the increased susceptibility of
sheep to MAS infections or if the inherent difficulties of
culturing sheep MAP isolates in vitro results in the isolation of secondary opportunistic pathogens. Regardless,

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:135

the association of MAS with infections resembling Johne's
Disease warrants additional study.
The LSPs observed in the mycobacterial isolates were
often closely associated with mobile genetic elements and
a reduction in the proportion of GC-base pairs relative to
the MAP genome average of 69.3% (Figure 4). A majority
of the LSPs contain or are flanked by insertion sequences,
phage remnants, or REP-family elements, which themselves have been predicted to be sites of phage integration.
Considering the paucity of recombination observed
amongst mycobacteria, it is not surprising that much of
the sequence diversity amongst this closely related group
of mycobacteria appears to be localized to loci that are
highly mobile and hotspots for recombination.
It is notable that two of the LSPs include mce gene clusters.
The mce genes were originally described in M. tuberculosis
as facilitating mycobacterial cell entry [32] and subsequent genome sequencing identified four mce genes clusters in the M. tuberculosis genome (mce1, mce2, mce3, and
mce4) [33]. Deletion of the mce gene clusters in M. tuberculosis resulted in the attenuation of virulence in mouse
models [34,35]. Recent work has suggested that the mce
gene clusters may function as ATP-binding cassette transport systems [36] with cholesterol subsequently identified
as one potential substrate [37]. A phylogenetic analysis of
the mce-like genes from a variety of microbes further supports the predicted function of these gene clusters as ABC
type transporters [38]. Analysis of the MAP genome
sequence has identified eight mce gene clusters [39]. The
two mce gene clusters identified as polymorphic in the isolates examined in this study (MAP0757-0765 and
MAP2189-2194) were annotated by Casali and Riley as
mce5 and are predicted to have arisen from a recent gene
duplication event [38]. The MAP2189-2194 mce5 cluster
was absent from most hominissuis and avium-silvaticum
genomotype isolates, while the MAP0757-0765 cluster
was only absent from MAS isolates 6007 and 6049.
While the LSPs that distinguish cattle and sheep MAP isolates represent a potential source of species specificity, the
lack of LSPs amongst the cattle genomotype isolates suggests that other mechanisms may also have an influence.
Alternatively, the variety of species from which the cattle
genomotype isolates were recovered may represent transient or "pass through" infections by the more environmentally prevalent cattle type isolates. From a human
health perspective, all of the human MAP isolates examined in this study appear to be highly similar to the prototypical bovine isolates. While the source and route of MAP
infections in humans remains controversial, it appears
that both cattle and humans are susceptible to infection
by MAP isolates with similar genotypes. The diversity of
SSR genotypes that displayed similar hybridization pat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/135

terns suggests that additional insights into host specificity
may be gained by future studies designed to examine
small nucleotide changes.
The microarrays used in this study are not sensitive
enough to detect small genetic changes such as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Alternate approaches
such as directed sequencing are required to elucidate these
types of genetic differences which may also result in significant biological effects. Additionally, only sequences
present on the microarray can be detected via hybridization, thus novel sequences that may be present in other
mycobacterial genomes will not be observed. This limitation was partially addressed by sequencing portions of the
MAP sheep isolate 397 genome. Genome sequencing and
subtractive genomic approaches are warranted in future
studies to identify additional sequences not represented
on the MAP microarray used in this study.

Conclusion
This study has identified several polymorphic regions
within the genomes of M. avium subspecies obtained from
a variety of host animals. Many of the subspecies are distinguished from each other by both host specificity as well
as large sequence polymorphisms, which suggests that
genes encoded within these regions influence the host
range of the mycobacteria. The lack of genetic diversity
and widespread distribution of cattle genomotype isolates
of MAP suggest that this subspecies is either capable of
infecting a variety of host species or alternatively is widespread in the environment and therefore comes into transient contact with a large number of hosts. Future
experiments will be designed to elucidate the functions of
the genes contained within the large sequence polymorphisms. Insights into the variable pathogenicity and host
specificity of the closely related M. avium subspecies are
likely contained within these regions.

Methods
SSR Genotyping
PCR amplification of two of the most discriminatory short
sequence repeat (SSR) loci – mononucleotide G and trinucleotide GGT repeats [40] was carried out as described
(2, 30) using primer sets (i) 5'-TCA GAC TGT GCG GTA
TGG AA-3' and 5'-GTG TTC GGC AAA GTC GTT GT-3',
and (ii) 5'-AGA TGT CGA CCA TCC TGA CC-3' and 5'AAG TAG GCG TAA CCC CGT TC-3', respectively. The
PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and sequenced by
using standard dye terminator chemistry, and the
sequences were analyzed on an automated DNA
sequencer (3700 DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The alleles were assigned a number congruent to the number of G and GGT residues.

Microarray Design
The software program ArrayOligoSelector [42] was used to
identify 70 mer oligonucleotides specific for every predicted open reading frame (ORF) in the MAP K-10
genome [39]. One 70 mer was designed for each MAP K10 ORF with a total length of less than 4000 bp, while
longer ORFs were split in half and one 70 mer was
designed for each half. One 70 mer was also designed for

every MAP intergenic region greater than 500 bp. Additionally, an automated annotation of the unannotated
MAH 104 genome sequence (downloaded on 03/25/05)
was performed using the methods described by McHardy
and coworkers [43] and one 70 mer was designed for
every predicted ORF that was less then 30% identical to
MAP K-10 sequences as determined by BLAST analysis
[44]. The annotated MAH 104 ORFs were numbered

sequentially starting at the origin of replication, although
for reference the nucleotide start and stop positions for
each ORF or cluster are also reported. The arbitrarily
assigned ORF designations were subsequently matched to
the ORF designations used when the completed MAH 104
genome sequence was deposited in Genbank (accession
number NC_008595) [see Additional file 1]. A detailed
description of this microarray platform has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus under the
accession number GPL3433.
Bacterial growth and DNA extraction
Mycobacteria were cultured and DNA extracted as previously described [45] or as follows. Bacteria were grown in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth (pH 6.0) supplemented with
oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (Becton Dickinson
Microbiology, Sparks, MD), and 0.05% Tween 80. Cultures of MAP were further supplemented with ferric mycobactin J (2 mg/liter; Allied Monitor Inc., Fayette, MO).
Genomic DNA was extracted from MAP isolates (Table 4)
with Genomic-tip 100/G anion-exchange columns (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) as previously described [46] with the
following modification: D-cycloserine was not added as
part of the extraction procedure. For the purposes of this
study, Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis is used to
designate Mycobacterium avium isolates cultured from
non-avian sources, while Mycobacterium avium subsp.
avium is used for isolates originating from birds [8].
Microarray hybridization and data analysis
Microarray hybridization and preliminary data filtering
was performed as described in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database entries (see below). The software program Cluster 3.0 [47] was used to filter out ORFs
that were lacking values for greater than 80% of the MAP
isolates examined and median center the results for each
isolate. Hierarchical clustering of the results was performed and visualized with Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView
[48] or MultiExperiment Viewer [49]. Putative large
sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) were identified by a visual examination of the hybridization results and selected
LSPs were subsequently confirmed by genome sequencing
and/or PCR. All microarray data has been deposited in the
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database as series
number GSE7622 which includes sample accession numbers GSM172202 – GSM172344.
Genome sequencing
Purified genomic DNA from MAP isolate 397 was prepared as described above for microarray hybridizations.
Initial shotgun genome sequencing was performed by 454
Life Sciences (Branford, CT). Additional sequences were
generated by directly sequencing PCR products and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/135

genomic DNA using an ABI3100 capillary sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). Sequence data was generated as
part of a genome sequencing project and will be published upon completion (M. Paustian, unpublished data).
