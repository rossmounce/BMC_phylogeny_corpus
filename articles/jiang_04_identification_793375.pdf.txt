Conclusions: The distribution of introns in the phylogenetic tree suggests that Myb domains
originally were compact in size; introns were inserted and the splicing sites conserved during
evolution. Conserved motifs identified in the carboxy-terminal regions are specific for Myb genes,
and the identified Myb gene subgroups may reflect functional conservation.

Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription
controls many important biological processes in a cell or
organism. The process of transcription recruits a number of
different transcription factors, which can be activators,
repressors, or both [1]. Genome-wide comparisons have

revealed the diversity in the regulation of transcription during evolution. With the completion of Arabidopsis genome
sequencing, 5% of its genome was found to encode more than
1,500 transcription factors [2]. On the basis of sequence similarities, transcription factors have been classified into

Results: This study analyzed 130 Myb genes from Arabidopsis and 85 from rice. The collected Myb
proteins were clustered into subgroups based on sequence similarity and phylogeny. Interestingly,
the exon-intron structure differed between subgroups, but was conserved in the same subgroup.
Moreover, the Myb domains contained a significant excess of phase 1 and 2 introns, as well as an
excess of nonsymmetric exons. Conserved motifs were detected in carboxy-terminal coding
regions of Myb genes within subgroups. In contrast, no common regulatory motifs were identified
in the noncoding regions. Additionally, some Myb genes with similar functions were clustered in
the same subgroups.

refereed research

Background: Myb proteins contain a conserved DNA-binding domain composed of one to four
repeat motifs (referred to as R0R1R2R3); each repeat is approximately 50 amino acids in length,
with regularly spaced tryptophan residues. Although the Myb proteins comprise one of the largest
families of transcription factors in plants, little is known about the functions of most Myb genes.
Here we use computational techniques to classify Myb genes on the basis of sequence similarity
and gene structure, and to identify possible functional relationships among subgroups of Myb genes
from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).

families. In plants, Myb factors comprise one of the largest of
these families.
Myb proteins are defined by a highly conserved DNA-binding
domain (termed the Myb domain) composed of one to four
helix-turn-helix motifs, which exist as tandem repeats
(referred to as R0R1R2R3) in a single Myb protein. Each
repeat is about 50 amino acids long, with regularly spaced
tryptophan residues, and forms three α-helices The third αhelix has a recognition role during DNA binding [3]. The
three-dimensional structure of the Myb domain in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) shows that the DNA recognition α-helix
interacts with the DNA major groove. Moreover, previous
research indicated that five amino-acid residues in the helixturn-helix motif bind directly to the major groove [4]. It
should be noted that sequences outside the Myb domain are
highly divergent.
The first Myb gene found was the v-Myb oncogene from the
avian myeloblastosis virus [5]. Subsequently, members of the
Myb gene family were identified in diverse plants and animals
[6,7]. Previous research showed that animal genomes encode
relatively few Myb genes [7]. In contrast, flowering plants
contain large numbers of Myb genes with very diverse structures and functions [6]. To date, the precise functions of most
plant Myb genes are unknown, although some well studied
examples suggest important roles for Myb genes in regulation
of secondary metabolism, cellular morphogenesis, pathogen
resistance, and responses to growth regulators and stress
[6,8].
With the completion of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa L.
ssp. indica) genome sequencing [9], the entire complement of
Myb genes can be identified and described. However, a great
deal of experimental work is required to determine the specific biological function of each gene. In Arabidopsis, R2R3
Myb gene-expression levels were determined in more than 20
different growth conditions; the results indicated that Myb
genes were specifically expressed in different tissues and

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/7/R46

physiological conditions [10]. To obtain further functional
information on Arabidopsis Myb genes, a process of reverse
genetics was applied to isolate insertion mutants. In all, 47
insertion mutants were detected in 36 distinct Myb genes by
screening a total of 73 genes. However, none of the insertions
gave rise to morphological phenotypes visible in soil-grown
plants [11]. The redundancy of Myb genes may diminish the
efficiency of the molecular approach by complementation of
function. No similar research has been done in rice Myb
genes. Here, we have used phylogenetic and computational
methods to classify Myb genes in subgroups. The resulting
subgroup classification and putative functional conserved
motif identification may be useful for research on agronomic
traits in rice, which is the most important crop for human
consumption, and an important model for other cereal grains.

Results and discussion
Expansion of Myb genes in Arabidopsis and rice
The Myb gene family has broadly expanded in plants during
evolution. The amplification of the Myb gene family occurred
before the divergence of monocots and dicots [12]. In our
study, 130 Myb genes were found in the Arabidopsis genome
and 85 in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica. The large size of this
gene family was also confirmed in Zea mays and sorghum
[12]. Although most plant Myb genes contain only two
repeats, there have been three-repeat Mybs reported in Arabidopsis [1], maize [13] and other plants [12]. To date, only
three-repeat Myb genes have been detected in animals, and it
has been proposed that two-repeat Myb genes died out in the
animal lineage [12]. The broad presence of three-repeat Myb
genes in diverse species indicates the antiquity of these genes.
Using homology search in the GenBank non-redundant database, two three-repeat Myb proteins (accession numbers
NP_913483 and BAC79618.) were identified in Oryza sativa
L. ssp. japonica. However, no three-repeat Mybs were
detected in rice (indica) in our study. This could be due to the
incompleteness of the Oryza indica dataset.

Phylogeny, subgroup designations, and carboxy-terminal motifs in Myb proteins from Arabidopsis and rice. The phylogenetic tree on the left represents 130
Myb genes from Arabidopsis, 85 from rice, and 43 from other plants, which are clustered into 42 subgroups (triangles) and seven singletons (lines). The 19
gray subgroups contain conserved carboxy-terminal motifs. The arrow indicates a large cluster of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic
pathway or ABA response. The scale bar under the tree respresents 0.2 substitutions. Some 'landmark' Myb proteins are listed in parentheses for
functional reference. The uncompressed tree with full taxa names is available as Additional data file 7. Comparison of the subgroup designations used in
this study with that in [1] is described in Additional data file 1. The four blocks (A-D) in the center of the diagram indicate the distribution of the four
major splicing patterns in the Myb R2R3 domains; see text for details. The motifs on the right were detected using MEME and drawn to scale. The Myb R2
and R3 repeats are indicated. The black boxes indicate the extension motifs following the R3 repeat. The gray boxes represent the motifs identified in the
previous report [1], and the white boxes are the motifs newly discovered here. The thin lines indicate coding regions lacking a detectable motif, with a

Intron-exon structure of Myb genes
Intron-exon structure of Myb genes. (a) Locations of introns 1 and 2 splice sites in R2R3 domains. Six representative Myb R2R3 domain sequences are
shown. The extent of the R2 and R3 repeats is indicated at bottom of the alignment. The triangles indicate the positions of the splice sites, and the
numbers above the triangles indicate the phases of introns. Subgroup G13 represents the major splicing pattern; that is, 77 (of 130) Myb genes in
Arabidopsis, and 45 (of 85) Myb genes in rice have this splicing pattern. The shaded W residues indicate the regularly spaced tryptophan residues. The
representative sequences of the six subgroups are: G13, At1g57560; G12, At2g32460; G16, At4g32730; N08, Scaffold479_5; N19, At2g39880; N21,
At2g25230. The table at the right of the alignment lists the number of Myb genes with each splicing pattern and the total number of Myb genes in
Arabidopsis and rice. Note that 22 Arabidopsis and 18 rice genes have the typical G13 splicing pattern, except that they lack either intron 1 or intron 2.
Additionally, six Arabidopsis and 12 rice genes have no introns within the R2R3 domain. Finally, two Arabidopsis and four rice Myb genes have other atypical
splicing patterns (data not shown). (b,c) The conserved exon-intron structure of all member genes in subgroups G13 and N21. Boxes and lines indicate

microRNA (noncoding RNA) miR159 [15]. The sequence is 21
nucleotides long and located in the 3' untranslated region (3'
UTR) of all five genes. MicroRNAs are proposed to act as regulators of gene expression through interactions with complementary mRNA sequences. Importantly, these five
Arabidopsis Mybs are located in subgroup G12 (Figure 1).
This clustering provides additional evidence for the reliability
of the subgroup designations in our analysis.

Conserved gene structure within each subgroup
supports the subgroup designations
The phylogenetic topology and subgroup structures are based
on sequence comparisons of the complete predicted Myb
genes. To test the reliability of the subgroup designations
using independent criteria, we investigated the exon-intron
structure of Myb genes subgroup by subgroup. A majority of
Arabidopsis (59%) and rice (53%) Myb genes have a conserved splicing pattern of three exons and two introns in

R2R3 domains (represented by subgroup G13; Figure 2a).
Either or both of the two introns are absent in 19% of Arabidopsis Myb genes and 12% of rice Myb genes. Variable splicing patterns different from G13 were detected in 22% of
Arabidopsis and 35% of rice Myb genes, respectively (data
not shown). Strikingly, the exon-intron structure is conserved
within each subgroup, but varies between subgroups (Figures
2b,c). This supports the subgroup designations from the independent criterion of splicing pattern.
Interestingly, the Myb gene splicing patterns constitute four
major blocks in the Myb gene phylogeny (Figure 1). Block A
lacks both introns 1 and 2. There are three splicing patterns in
block B: subgroup G15 lacks both introns; subgroup G17 lacks
only intron 2; and the remaining genes have altered splicing
sites when compared to subgroup G13. Myb genes in block C
have the major splicing pattern (81.2%) typified by G13, with
some individual genes lacking intron 1 (9.4%), intron 2 (4.7%)

Most plant Myb genes are thought to encode transcription
factors that activate or repress target gene expression either
independently or together with cofactors. The topology of
Myb phylogeny (Figure 1) indicates that some Myb genes in
the same subgroup have the same function and that some
Myb genes with similar functions are located in the same subgroup. For example, two Myb orthologs, snapdragon PHAN
gene and maize rs2 gene, are located in subgroup G18, and
both are involved in organ development: PHAN has been
shown to regulate the development of the proximo-distal axis
and dorso-ventral asymmetry of lateral organs such as leaves,
bracts and petal lobes [23], while the rs2 gene controls the
development of maize lateral organ primordia by repressing
expression of knox (knotted1-like homeobox) genes that are
required for the normal initiation and development of lateral
organs [24]. In another example, the Arabidopsis genes GL1
and WER located in subgroup G07 are both involved in epidermal cell development: GL1 activates the GLABRA2 homeobox gene for trichome (hair cell) development in some parts
of the leaf and in the stem [25,26], while WER controls the
formation of the root epidermis by regulating expression of
the GLABRA2 gene [27].

Similar results are observed for Myb genes involved in the
phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway (Figure 1, subgroups
N08, N09, N14): C1 [28], Pl, TT2 [29], AN2 [30], p1 [31], p2
[32], FaMyb1 [33], PAP1 and PAP2 [34]. These genes all
encode a transcription factor that activates enzymes for phenylpropanoid synthesis, except that the FaMyb1 transcription factor suppresses anthocyanin and flavonol
accumulation [33]. In addition, the functional conservation
among some Myb genes during evolution could be observed
in the cell-cycle protein CDC5 (Figure 1, G19). The CDC5 protein performs an essential function in cell-cycle control at G2/
M, and also participates in pre-mRNA splicing [35].

deposited research

Although the splicing sites are conserved, the sizes of both
introns vary greatly for different Myb genes. Approximately
85% of introns 1 and 2 of Myb genes is shorter than 300 bp in
Arabidopsis and rice. Detailed information about the distribution of intron sizes of Myb genes is available in Additional
data file 2. It is worth noting that the size of intron 2 of maize
p1 and p2 orthologs is very large, around 5 kb. This intronsize information may be helpful for aligning expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) with genomic sequences.

Topology of Myb gene phylogeny may reflect functional
conservation

reports

According to the intron-early theory [16], an excess of phase
0 introns and symmetric exons may facilitate exon shuffling
by avoiding interruptions of the ORF, and thus could accelerate the rate of recombinational fusion and exchange of protein domains. Our results suggest that ancient Myb genes had
a compact size without introns. During evolution, under some
unknown mechanisms, introns were inserted into Myb
domains and resulted in the observed splicing patterns. One
splicing pattern remained unchanged in the subsequent gene
amplification, resulting in the major splicing pattern typified
by G13. Consistent with this, transposition of introns occurs
very infrequently during evolution [17]. This intron-gain
model is consistent with previous results showing that
numerous introns have been inserted into plants and retained
in the genome [18]. A similar approach to gene classification
using intron/exon structure has been applied in the kinesin
family [19] and the bHLH family [20], and the results support
a similar evolutionary pattern.

The GenBank accession number is AF466202 (located
84795..85689, 12 March 2002 version). These results are
consistent with a previous proposal that some transposable
elements could insert into the genome as intronic sequences,
a mechanism that has been proposed for the insertion of
nuclear introns [22].

reviews

In addition to splice-site locations, we also examined the
position of splicing with respect to the open reading frame
(ORF) - the intron phase. The splicing of each intron is designated as occurring in one of three phases: in phase 0, splicing
occurs after the third nucleotide of the first codon; in phase 1,
splicing occurs after the first nucleotide of the single codon;
and in phase 2, splicing occurs after the second nucleotide.
Figure 2a shows not only the conserved locations in the Mybdomain protein sequences but also the conserved phases of
introns within the same subgroup. Moreover, there is a significant excess of phase 1 and 2 introns as well as an excess of
nonsymmetric exons in Myb genes. Symmetric exons are
exons that are flanked by introns of the same phase.

or both introns (1.9%), or having minor splicing patterns
(2.8%). In contrast, 58.2% of Myb genes in block D retain the
typical splicing sites, and the rest lack only intron 1 (G02, G05
and half of the genes in G06).

The extent of the Myb R1, R2 and R3 repeats is based on similarity to the previously-published consensus Myb repeat
sequences [36]. We used computational methods to identify
additional conserved sequences downstream of the Myb
repeats. A total of 18 motifs were identified in the carboxyterminal regions, with each motif ranging in size from 9 to 32
amino acids (Figure 1). An exceptionally large domain (91 residues) was found in subgroup G19, gene CDC5, which is a con-

A 10-base direct repeat (5'-TGATTTTGAC-3') flanks this fragment. Interestingly, no Ac elements were found inserted in its
adjacent 3.2-kb intronic region, but frequent Ac insertion
occurred in other regions. This could be due to a particular
chromatin structure refractory to Ac insertion in this region
[21]. BLAST search detected this fragment (94% identity over

Alias indicates the corresponding motifs identified by Stracke et al. [1]. E-value was calculated by MEME. Consensus sequences follow the criteria of
Joshi et al. [44]: a single capital letter is given if the relative frequency of a single residue at a certain position is greater than 50% and greater than
twice that of the second most frequent residue. When no single residue satisfied these criteria, a pair of residues was assigned as capital letters in

relative frequency of a residue is greater than 40%. Otherwise, x is given.

served Myb paralog that originated prior to Myb-family
amplification [12]. In addition, Myb genes maize C1, Pl and
AtMyb123 (TT2) in subgroup N08 have a nine-amino-acid
motif previously reported [1,37]. This motif has a high e-value
(4.5e-008), so it was excluded from our analysis. Three other
motifs identified by Stracke et al. [1] were excluded from our
analysis because of their high e-values (see Additional data
file 3).
Interestingly, three short fragments directly following the
Myb R3 repeat are highly conserved in some subgroups (Figure 1, black boxes). We designated these extension motifs, E1,
E2 and E3. Subgroups with an extension motif contain few or
zero motifs in their carboxy-terminal coding regions when
compared to those subgroups without extension motifs. One
exception is subgroup G03, which contains motif E1 and two
other carboxy-terminal motifs - 1 and 2 (Figure 1). In subgroup G08, a short conserved segment following E1 is termed
E2. The three extension motifs are relatively small, ranging
from 8 to 13 residues, but they are much more conserved than
other motifs (Table 1). In the group of three extension motifs,
28 (of 33) sites are occupied by a single residue in more than

50% of the Myb proteins, and this value is greater than twice
the relative frequency of the second most frequent residue.
To test the reliability of the motif predictions, the similarity
scores were calculated over the motif plus its flanking regions.
The similarity plots produced much higher scores in the motif
region than in the flanking regions (Figure 3a), thus supporting the identified motifs. Similar results were observed in the
nonsynonymous (dN) substitution analysis, which is a typical
way of examining the degree of functional constraints on proteins using evolutionary comparisons [37]. The results indicated that motif regions were less frequently subject to
substitution than flanking regions. The distribution of dN values showed that most dN values are equal to or less than 0.6
in motif regions, and greater than 1 in flanking regions (Figure 3, Table 2). Interestingly, there are seven other motifs
identified by Stracke et al. [1] that had a high dN value and did
not pass this test (see Additional data file 3). The presence of
carboxy-terminal motifs could reflect either the long-term
conservation of critical sequences from antiquity or more
recent gene duplications. The low dN values in the motif
regions compared with the flanking regions suggest that the
motifs are ancient sequences which have been conserved over

We wished to determine whether the detected motifs are specifically present in Myb genes, but are absent in non-Myb
genes. Therefore, we used protein motif sequences as query
sequences and performed Blastp searches in the Swiss-Prot
database. For the motifs with size equal to or less than 15
amino acids, the homologous hits with 85% of the query motif
length are all Myb domain containing proteins. For the motifs
with size greater than 15 amino acids, the corresponding
homologous hits with 70% of the query motif length contain
Myb domains. The search result is described in Additional
data file 4.

After comparing these two search results, we found that not
all carboxy-terminal motifs detected homologous ESTs. This
could be due to the low levels of expression of some Myb
genes so that their EST sequences are not yet available. In
some cases, these ESTs did not contain Myb domains; however, because the carboxy-terminal motifs are located downstream some distance from the Myb domains, the returned

Specificity of motifs to Myb genes

We obtained similar results in EST searches. When translated
into proteins, all the 14 ESTs detected from an extension
motif search also contain a Myb domain. Interestingly, we
detected more ESTs from E1 than from the other extension
motifs. Most probably this is due to the presence of E1 in more
Myb genes than other motifs (Figure 1). The search result is
described in Additional data file 5.

noncoding regions. This could be due to the fact that the Myb
genes clustered in each subgroup are probably not orthologs
or paralogs. In contrast, within the subgroup N14 (Figure 1)
containing the maize p1 and p2 genes, and orthologs/paralogs from sorghum and rice, a highly conserved scheme of
TATA-box, transcription start site sequences, and 5' UTR CAbox were found (data not shown). Otherwise, no significant
regulatory elements were detected in noncoding regions of
other Myb genes. However, it should be noted that segments
of intron sequence closer to flanking exons are significantly
more conserved than interior intron sequence. It has been
reported that this level of intron sequence conservation may
have a functional role in gene regulation [38]. Our results
suggest that it will be difficult to directly identify regulatory
motifs in noncoding regions using only existing computational techniques. The chance of identification of regulatory
elements will be increased in orthologs/paralogs. Possibly,
the identification of co-regulated genes using microarray
analysis will assist in the identification of common regulatory
elements.

Conclusions

Amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal indicate the upstream and
downstream flanking regions, respectively. The upstream flanking
regions of extension motifs E1, E2 and E3 are the carboxy-terminal
ending fragments of the Myb R3 repeat, which is highly conserved.
Therefore, their amino-terminal dN values are low. dN values for the
carboxy-terminal motifs M6 and M11 could not be calculated because
of their close proximity to the carboxyl terminus.

ESTs are probably too short to reach the Myb domains. However, alignment of ESTs with known Myb genes showed high
identity not only in the motif sequence but also for considerable lengths in the flanking regions. This suggests that such
ESTs are very likely from Myb genes.
Interestingly, we checked each carboxy-terminal motif in the
258 Myb proteins and found they are subgroup specific. For
example, motif 1 from subgroup G03 was not detected in
other subgroups.

The expansion of Myb genes in plants makes it one of the largest families of transcription factors known to date. However,
the specific roles of Myb genes in regulating plant traits are
still unclear. Here, we used overall sequence similarity to
cluster Myb genes from Arabidopsis and rice into 42 subgroups. The subgroup designations were well supported by
sequence similarity and exon-intron structure. In one subgroup, significant complementarity to a specific miRNA was
also observed. Furthermore, we found that the splicing sites
and the phase of introns are conserved in Myb domains
within the same subgroup, but differ between subgroups. The
phylogenetic topology of splicing patterns suggested that Myb
domains may originally have been compact in size, and that
introns were inserted and remained in place during evolution. Computational searches were used to identify conserved
carboxy-terminal motifs present in the different subgroups.
These motifs appear to be specific characteristics of the Myb
subgroups. In contrast to the carboxy-terminal motifs
specifically present in Myb genes, no conserved regulatory
elements were identified in the noncoding regions.

Materials and methods
Identification of regulatory elements in noncoding
regions
In addition to the carboxy-terminal motifs detected in the
predicted Myb proteins, we wanted to test whether any conserved DNA sequence motifs could be identified among the
Myb gene subgroups. We applied motif-searching tools to
detect conserved regulatory elements in the promoter region
plus 5' UTR of the Myb genes and in intron regions. In contrast to the carboxy-terminal coding regions, no conserved
DNA sequence motifs were identified in the Myb gene

Myb proteins used in the analysis
At the initiation of our project, the international rice genome
sequencing project was not finished. Two finished rice
genomes - one by Monsanto, the other by Syngenta (Oryza
sativa L. ssp. japonica) - were not available to the public.
Only the rice (indica) genome sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute was publicly available. The sequence-quality
assessments through sequence-tagged site (STS) markers,
UniGene clusters and nonredundant cDNAs showed that 92%
of the functional sequences that encode genes, and their

Motif analysis: similarity scores and nonsynonymous
(dN) substitution
To confirm the reliability of the 38 motif candidates identified
by MEME, we used PlotSimilarity from GCG package from
Genetics Computer Group, Inc. to calculate the similarity
score of each motif plus its 10-residue flanking fragments
(protein sequences). There were 33 motifs with values above
the average score in the motif region and below the average
score in the flanking regions, and these were tested further
using the dN values. The program YN00 from PAML package
[43] was applied to analyze the conservation of each motif
plus its flanking regions (coding DNA sequences). The frequency of synonymous substitution is too high to detect the
conservation. Therefore, nonsynonymous substitution value
was calculated. Low dN values indicate conservation whereas
high dN values indicate divergence. We detected 18 motifs
with dN <0.5 in the motif region and >1 in flanking regions;
these 18 motifs included 3 extension and 15 carboxy-terminal
motifs.

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R46

information

Originally, MEME identified 38 motif candidates with e-value
<= 1e-10. Then five motifs were removed in the similarity
score test. Later, 15 motifs were discarded in the nonsynonymous substitution test. This result suggests that the similarity
score test is not sufficiently powerful to determine the reliability of motif candidates, and may be safely ignored in the
future.

interactions

For phylogenetic analysis, the above 258 Myb proteins (130
Arabidopsis, 85 rice and 43 from various other plants) with
complete R2R3 domains were included. The sequences were
aligned by ClustalX (version 1.81). The phylogenetic tree was
constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA
version 2.0 [41], with the setting of pairwise gap deletion and
Poisson distance. Bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) was performed to evaluate the degree of support for a particular
grouping in the neighbor-joining analysis. To enable the identification of motifs in the carboxy-terminal regions within
each subgroup, we did not employ complete gap deletion as
this may tend to exclude the contribution of carboxy-terminal
residues because of their high divergence. The p-distance represents the simplest sort of genetic distance calculation and
can be highly biased, so it was not used. In addition, attempts
to use only the carboxy-terminal regions in construction of

Within each subgroup, motifs were detected using MEME
[42] with the following parameter settings: the distribution of
motifs: zero or one per sequence; maximum number of motifs
to find: 16; minimum width of motif: 6; maximum width of
motif: 117, in order to identify long R2R3 domains; minimum
number of sites for each motif: the number of sequences, i.e.,
the motif must be present in all members within the same
subgroup. Other options used the default values. Only motifs
with e-value <= 1e-10 were kept for further analysis.

Motif identification

deposited research

To collect reference information on Myb gene functions, we
used Blastp search against the nonredundant dataset in GenBank. The search yielded 43 plant Myb proteins with complete R2R3 domains; for most of these, some experimental
information regarding functions or expression patterns was
deposited by individual researchers.

Three trees were constructed with the above settings, then
taxa were classified into subgroups based on the topology of
the phylogeny. Tree I used the 43 landmark Myb proteins
with 130 Arabidopsis Myb proteins. The clustering result is
consistent with the previous report [1]; that is, the taxa that
were clustered as subgroups in Stracke et al.'s findings [1] are
located within a subgroup in tree I. Tree II replaced the 130
Arabidopsis Myb proteins in tree I with 85 rice Myb proteins.
Tree III used the total 258 Myb proteins. We found that the
clustering result of Myb proteins from Arabidopsis, rice and
the landmark Myb proteins was consistent among all three
trees. Therefore, we used tree III as the representative in this
study.

reports

The complement of Arabidopsis proteins from GenBank were
used to identify Myb proteins with complete R2R3 domains.
The same methods as above were applied. We obtained 130
typical Myb proteins containing complete R2R3 domains
(one R0R1R2R3 Myb, five R1R2R3 proteins, 124 R2R3 protein) and 11 partial Myb proteins. The results are consistent
with previous findings [1].

Therefore, we used the complete Myb proteins in clustering.

reviews

Rice genome sequences (scaffold dataset) were obtained from
Beijing Genomics Institute [39]. FGeneSH has been used successfully to predict genes in rice [9], and GenScan was used
together with it to predict genes by taking rice genomic
sequences as input. The two prediction results were combined as the complement of rice proteins. We performed
Blastp and HMMER [40] searches to identify Myb genes from
this rice protein dataset. For Blastp, we used a set of Myb
R2R3 domains as query sequences. For HMMER, we used the
Myb profile from Pfam. We parsed and combined the results
of both searches, and obtained the final complement of rice
Myb proteins with manual inspection of each sequence to
confirm the identification of bona fide Myb genes. In the end,
85 typical Myb genes with complete R2R3 domains (one
R0R1R2R3 and 84 R2R3) and 28 partial Myb genes were
detected in the rice genome. Partial Myb genes contain a segment similar to one or a partial Myb repeat. The sequences of
rice Myb genes are listed in Additional data file 6.

Specificity of motifs
To test whether the carboxy-terminal motifs are specific to
Myb genes, motif sequences were used to perform homology
search in Swiss-Prot database and EST data set from GenBank. The latter can also provide information on the expression pattern of Myb genes. Low complexity was turned off for
optimal short sequence search in both homology searches. In
addition, in EST search, for motifs less than 15 residues 10
downstream residues were appended, and this elongated
sequence was used as query sequence to perform EST search.
The corresponding Myb R2 repeats were used in a tblastn
EST search as an internal positive control.
