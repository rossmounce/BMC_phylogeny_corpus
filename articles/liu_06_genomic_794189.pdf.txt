Abstract
Background: Approximately 11 Mb of finished high quality genomic sequences were sampled
from cattle, dog and human to estimate genomic divergences and their regional variation among
these lineages.
Results: Optimal three-way multi-species global sequence alignments for 84 cattle clones or loci
(each >50 kb of genomic sequence) were constructed using the human and dog genome assemblies
as references. Genomic divergences and substitution rates were examined for each clone and for
various sequence classes under different functional constraints. Analysis of these alignments
revealed that the overall genomic divergences are relatively constant (0.32–0.37 change/site) for
pairwise comparisons among cattle, dog and human; however substitution rates vary across
genomic regions and among different sequence classes. A neutral mutation rate (2.0–2.2 × 10(-9)
change/site/year) was derived from ancestral repetitive sequences, whereas the substitution rate in
coding sequences (1.1 × 10(-9) change/site/year) was approximately half of the overall rate (1.9–
2.0 × 10(-9) change/site/year). Relative rate tests also indicated that cattle have a significantly faster
rate of substitution as compared to dog and that this difference is about 6%.
Conclusion: This analysis provides a large-scale and unbiased assessment of genomic divergences
and regional variation of substitution rates among cattle, dog and human. It is expected that these
data will serve as a baseline for future mammalian molecular evolution studies.

Background
Many mammalian species have long served our human
society by providing food, materials, and labor, providing
companionship as pets, and serving as model organisms
for biological studies. Besides the seven mammals
(human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, macaque, dog and cattle) whose genomic sequence data are already available,

16 eutherian mammals have been proposed for low-coverage genome sequencing efforts [1]. Comparative
genomics has been proven to be a powerful strategy to
identify important evolutionary changes among these
mammalian species [2]. Evolutionary changes, which
have shaped the mammalian genomes, include both
small-scale (point mutations, microsatellite slippage,

insertions/deletions) as well as large-scale events (transpositions, genomic rearrangements and segmental duplications). Knowledge of mutation rates is critical for
building evolutionary timescale, discovering conserved
noncoding functional elements, identifying evolutionary
processes like positive selection, and understanding heritable diseases [3].
Earlier studies on mammalian evolution were limited by
the lack of large-scale genomic sequence data and were
dependent upon PCR cross-amplification of limited numbers of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Therefore, these
sampled sequences were often limited to closely related
species and had a bias towards conserved unique regions.
This also resulted in repetitive sequences being excluded
from genomic divergence calculations in these earlier
studies. As the remnants of transposition events, repetitive
sequences are one of the most predominant features of
mammalian genomes (for example, 40–50% of the
human genome are repeats) [4,5]. Repeats have been
shown to play an important role in mammalian genome
evolution [6,7]. Depending on their time of origin,
repeats can be divided into ancestral repeats (AR: arrived
before a speciation event, and thus shared by both species) and lineage-specific repeats (arrived after a speciation event). Recently it has been shown that virtually all
ancient repeats evolve neutrally [8]. As one class of nonfunctional neutral sequences, ancient repeats have been
used to estimate neutral mutation rates [9-11]. Several
recent studies have indicated that neutral mutation rates
(not substitution rates which are the combined effects of
mutation and selection) in mammals have been relatively
constant [12], except for the discrepant results from
rodents, which were shown to mutate as much as 2-fold
faster than other mammals [9,11].
With the availability of the human, mouse, rat and chimpanzee genome assemblies, whole genome-wide comparisons and analyses have been generated using primates
and rodents (such as human vs. non-human primates,
mouse, and rat) [4,5,9,13-15]. Targeted comparative
sequencing efforts (the ENCODE – ENCyclopedia Of
DNA Elements Project) also have generated megabases of
high-quality genomic sequence for dozens of mammalian
species [2,16,17]. Recent studies also have measured
mutation rates [18], their regional variation [19,20] and
their covariation with other genomic events in human,
mouse and rat[11,21]. A local alignment algorithm, blastz
[22], has been used to align human, mouse and rat
genomes [9,14,21]. On the other hand, a global alignment algorithm, mlagan, has been used to generate multiple alignments in the "greater CFTR region" [23]. A
comparison of results derived from local versus global
alignment algorithms would be of interest.

With the dog draft assembly (July 2004, canFam1)[24],
the cattle draft assembly (March 2005, bosTau2)[25] and
cattle BAC library resources [26] now available, a largescale genomic comparison was initiated to assess the
nature and pattern of genomic variation among other
mammalian orders; i.e. artiodactyls (Cattle, Bos taurus)
and carnivores (Dog, Canis familiaris) as compared to primates (Human, Homo sapiens). To avoid any potential
genome assembly artifacts, the project began with highquality finished genomic sequences from cattle BAC
clones, rather than the cattle draft assembly. The threeway multi-species global alignments (ranging in alignment length from 67 to 491 kb) were generated from the
orthologous sequences of cattle, dog and human using an
optimized global alignment algorithm to provide a platform for analyzing genomic variation. The lineage, which
led to the last common ancestor (LCA) of cattle and dog,
was estimated to have diverged from human approximately 92 million years ago (mya) followed by the estimated separation of cattle and dog 83 million years ago
[27,28]. The overall objective of this study was to assess
patterns of single-nucleotide mutations across genomic
regions and among different sequence classes in the mammalian lineages.

Results
Orthologous sequences and alignment validation
A total of 84 ortholog trios were identified though a
sequence similarity search, which included 10.5 Mb of
cattle sequences, 9.3 Mb of dog sequences and 11.1 Mb of
human sequences. The putative ortholog trios were further confirmed by reciprocal blast [29]. These ortholog
trios were placed to all human chromosomes (chr) except
for chr 9, 15, 19 and Y (see Additional file 1 Table S3).

Two strategies were implemented to align these orthologous sequences using the global alignment algorithm –
mlagan: 1) optimizing the alignment parameters and 2)
applying a post-alignment filter. In order to establish the
optimal parameters to treat indels in global alignment, 5
random sets of pairwise sequence alignments were analyzed between cattle-dog, cattle-human and dog-human.
Using the software lagan [23], a series of gap opening and
extension penalties were tested for their impact on the frequency of single nucleotide and insertion/deletion events
(see Additional file 1 Fig. S1). The following tests were
performed to select the optimal alignment parameters
that minimized sequence divergence and the number of
indels. First, the natures of the sequences underlying
insertion/deletions were analyzed. Alignment parameters
(gap opening penalty of -1,000 and gap extension penalty
of -10) were favored because insertion/deletions were
effectively treated as a single event. Second, the overall
estimates of sequence divergence (Table 1) were compared with earlier phylogenetic studies using conserved

Orthologous sequences were globally aligned with mlagan (Methods). A suboptimal alignment was defined as any alignment which exceeded 3 standard deviations of the mean K2 divergence (window size 2 kb, slide 100 bp).
These regions were not included in the analysis. Coding sequence was restricted only to well-annotated human genes (NCBI RefSeq database). UTR regions included 5'- and 3'-UTRs. Repetitive sequences were detected using
RepeatMasker (version 3.0.8). Unique noncoding (i.e. not annotated) regions excluded both exonic and repetitive regions. Due to the higher mutation rate of CpG dinucleotides, substitutions without CpG dinucleotides
(Overall-CG, Repetitive-CG) were considered in each alignment.
* Substitution rate calculations assume branch times of the cattle, dog and human lineages from the LCA of cattle and dog of 83, 83 and 101 mya, respectively [27,28].
†: If suboptimal alignments were included in the analysis, the overall branch length increases to 0.1707 ± 0.0003, 0.1567 ± 0.0003 and 0.2069 ± 0.0004, respectively (Methods).

coding regions [12,30] or the greater CFTR region aligned by blastz [2]. The estimated
overall sequence divergences in our analyses (cattle-dog: 0.3228 ± 0.0005, cattle-human:
0.3717 ± 0.0007, and dog-human: 0.3583 ± 0.0006 change/site) were generally comparable to previous studies [2,10,12,30]. Third, 73,728 randomly selected cattle BAC end
sequences (BES) from CHORI-240 [31] were mapped onto the human genome assembly
Build35 [32]. Similar results were observed when alignments of BAC end sequences were
compared with our optimal global alignments. The variation distribution pattern of these
BES alignments (400–500 bp) (G.E. Liu et al, unpublished results) was remarkably similar
to the distribution observed for non-overlapping 500-bp windows generated from optimal global alignments (see Additional file 1 Fig. S5B).
Despite the optimization of alignment parameters, suboptimal or ectopic alignments
occasionally occurred. Suboptimal alignments were defined as those alignments that
exceeded 3 standard deviations of the mean pairwise K2 divergences in a sliding window
analysis (See Methods), which were removed using a post-alignment filter. Although such
suboptimal alignments composed less than 5% of aligned bases, these alignments were
not considered in our analysis to avoid overestimation of genomic divergence.
A total of 84 three-way multiple sequence alignments were generated with a combined
alignment length of 15 Mb, consisting of 5.5 Mb of aligned bases and 1,794 non-overlapping windows of 3 kb (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1 Fig. S5A). The cattle-dog-human multiple alignment lengths ranged from 66,960 to 491,059 bp with a mean and standard
deviation of 184,608 ± 79,744 bp. All individual alignments and patterns of single-nucleotide variation were manually inspected and are available online [33].
Branch lengths in various sequence classes
Comparative genomic analyses were performed on these 84 three-way multi-species global alignments. The branch lengths and substitution rates of cattle, dog and human are

shown in Table 1. The average overall branch lengths were 0.1681 ± 0.0003, 0.1547 ±
0.0003, and 0.2036 ± 0.0003 change/site for cattle, dog and human, respectively. Similar
degrees of branch lengths were reported in previous studies [12,30]. The genomic divergence between cattle and dog was the smallest with a value of 0.3228 ± 0.0005 change/
site. The dog-human evolutionary divergence was 0.3583 ± 0.0006 change/site, which was
less than the cattle-human divergence of 0.3717 ± 0.0006 change/site. As expected, these
results confirm that artiodactyls and carnivores are the closest relatives, with primates
being the most distant. Mutations at CpG dinucleotides occur frequently due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines [34]. To remove any variation caused by differences in levels of methylation, substitution rates were estimated after removing CpG
dinucleotides (Overall-CG, Repetitive-CG). The overall branch lengths decreased 5.1%
(cattle), 6.2% (dog) and 4.8% (human) after removing CpG dinucleotides from all
sequences within alignments (Table 1, Overall-CG). Alignments were further sorted into
four sequence classes based on NCBI RefSeq [35] and RepeatMasker coordinates using the
software MaM [36]. The total 5.5 Mb aligned sequences included 133 kb, 115 kb, 4.0 Mb
and 1.2 Mb aligned bases from coding, UTR, unique noncoding (i.e. not annotated), and
repetitive regions, respectively. Coding regions of 193 well-annotated RefSeq genes
excluded both 3' and 5' UTR. Branch lengths in coding regions (cattle 0.0644 ± 0.0010,
dog 0.0647 ± 0.0010, and human 0.0595 ± 0.0009 change/site) were only half of the overall branch length, reflecting that they are under strong purifying selection. The branch
lengths in UTR regions (cattle 0.1676 ± 0.0003, dog 0.1538 ± 0.0003, and human 0.2021
± 0.0004 change/site) were significantly larger than the coding branch lengths (t-test, for
each species p <0.0001). The branch lengths in unique noncoding portions (cattle 0.1676
± 0.0003, dog 0.1538 ± 0.0003, and human 0.2021 ± 0.0004 change/site) were slightly
less than the overall branch lengths. In contrast, the aligned repetitive portions possessed
the longest branch lengths (cattle 0.1830 ± 0.0006, dog 0.1668 ± 0.0006, and human
0.2221 ± 0.0007 change/site). These branch lengths decreased 4.4% (cattle), 5.2% (dog)
and 4.1% (human) when CpG dinucleotide sites were excluded, suggesting higher substi-

tution rates of CpG sites (Table 1, Repetitive-CG). The differences were significant between the branch lengths in
unique noncoding vs. repetitive portions before and after
removing CpG dinucleotides from repetitive elements
(one-way ANOVA, cattle P = 0.0006, dog P = 0.0116, and
human P <0.0001) for all 83 autosomal alignments.

autosomal alignments containing 1761 windows; the
unique noncoding regions comprised 83 autosomal
alignments containing 1290 windows; and the repetitive
regions comprised 83 autosomal alignments containing
347 windows. All tests were statistically significant at P
<0.0001.

Regional variation of substitution rates
Substitution rates were calculated from the LCA of cattle
and dog assuming branch times of 83, 83 and 101 million
years for cattle, dog and human lineages, respectively
[27,28]. A dramatic variation of substitution rates was
observed between and within chromosomes according to
the human placement. Table S4 (see Additional file 1)
summarizes the substitution rates of AR for each individual clone or locus on each chromosome. Chromosome X
accumulated fewer substitutions than autosomal chromosomes (cattle 1.771 ± 0.045, dog 1.680 ± 0.043, and
human 2.083 ± 0.049 × 10-9 change/site/year), supporting
the existence of a higher mutation rate in the male than in
the female germline [34]. Among autosomal chromosomes, HSA10 (Human chromosome 10), showed higher
substitution rates (cattle 2.372 ± 0.057, dog 2.417 ±
0.058, and human 2.583 ± 0.059 × 10-9 change/site/year)
compared to rates in chromosome 11 (cattle 2.151 ±
0.028, dog 1.916 ± 0.025, and human 2.022 ± 0.025 × 109 change/site/year). Substitution rates for HSA10 and
HSA16 were significantly higher, while those for HSA14,
HSA12 and HSA7 were significantly lower when compared to the average substitution rates in repetitive regions
(t-test, all P <0.0001, see Additional file 1 Table S4).

The relationships of overall substitution rate, branch
length, K2 divergence, indel rate per 10 kb, SINE% and
LINE% on GC% were complex and were best fit by a
quadratic function [9,11,21,37] (Fig. 2). It is worth noting
that branch lengths (i.e. substitution rates after normalized by the divergence times) were well correlated among
species – almost as well as the GC% distribution (see
Additional file 1 Fig. S2), although branch lengths and
substitution rates did not seem to correlate with GC%
(Fig. 2). A positive coefficient for GC% but a negative
coefficient for the square of GC% was obtained in all
quadratic fit functions. The K2 divergences tended to
increase over the GC% interval below 45%, whereas the
plots tended to decrease above a GC% of 45%. However,
all substitution rate and branch length fitting curves were
relatively flat. This is consistent with an earlier observation of the discrepancy of rate estimation by the simple
parametric model vs. the complicated rate model and
maximum likelihood method at the high GC% isochores
[38]. The quadratic fits for substitution rate on GC% had
r2 values of 5.6%, 13.0% and 4.2% for cattle, dog, and
human, respectively. The quadratic fits for K2 divergence
on GC% had r2 values of 12.6%, 8.1% and 9.0% for cattledog, cattle-human and dog-human comparisons, respectively. Correspondingly, the quadratic fits for indel on
GC% had r2 values of 19.8%, 7.8% and 14.6%, respectively. The dramatic differences between SINE and LINE
distribution relative to GC% agreed with the previous
observations of their differential insertion bias and retention behaviors [4,9,14].

Similarly, substitution rates varied significantly among
individual clones or loci within one chromosome (see
Additional file 1 Fig. S2, Table S4). For example, contig
01.01 (mapped to HSA7:30,585,342-30,707,957 and
CFA14:46,029,765-46,135,257) showed high substitution rates (cattle 2.371 ± 0.080, dog 1.788 ± 0.065, and
human 2.020 ± 0.068 × 10-9 change/site/year), while contig 33.39 (mapped to HSA7:114,308,522-114,473,710
and CFA14:56,758,901-56,922,307) demonstrated low
substitution rates (cattle 1.998 ± 0.081, dog 2.092 ±
0.083, and human 2.264 ± 0.086 × 10-9 change/site/year),
even though both belonged to the same chromosomes
(HSA7 and CFA14).
Histograms of substitution rates in non-overlapping 3-kb
sliding windows for overall (A) and repetitive (B)
sequences (with and without CpG sites) are shown in Fig.
1. ANOVA tests were performed on variation in branch
lengths of 3-kb nonoverlapping windows between and
within autosomal chromosomes for each species. These
included 6 types of sequences: Overall, Overall-CG,
Unique noncoding, Unique noncoding-CG, Repetitive,
and Repetitive-CG. The overall sequence comprised 83

Loci with lower overall divergences were inspected for the
presence of underlying RefSeq genes. As expected, many
protein coding genes were under functional constraints.
These constraints such as those on the FOXP2, MET and
SCAP2 genes within the great CFTR region may explain
the low overall divergences observed within that part of
HSA7 [2]. When loci with high overall divergences were
examined, it is interesting to note that a few protein coding genes were also detected. These included CSMD2 [39]
(contig 38.45, HSA1:33,820,824-33,883,038), FDFT1
[40,41] and CTSB (contig 03.03, HSA8:1169808611762835) [40,42,43]. These loci retained higher substitution rates even if only the AR regions were considered
(see Additional file 1 TableS4).

The differences of substitution rates between cattle and
dog
The overall substitution rates were estimated to be 2.026
± 0.003, 1.864 ± 0.003, and 2.016 ± 0.003 × 10-9 change/
site/year for cattle, dog and human, respectively (Table 1).
Indeed, estimates of neutral mutation rates using ancient
repeats (cattle 2.205 ± 0.007, dog 2.010 ± 0.007, and
human 2.199 ± 0.007 × 10-9 change/site/year) were comparable to previous studies (2.1–3.7 × 10-9 change/site/
year) [11], agreeing almost perfectly with the estimates
from the human-mouse comparisons (i.e. 2.2 × 10-9 and
4.5 × 10-9 change/site/year in the human and mouse lineages) [9]. In all cases in Fig. 1 (Overall, Overall-CG, repetitive and repetitive-CG), the distributions of dog
substitution rates (green) were shifted slightly to the left
of those of cattle rates (blue), consistent with the faster
rate of substitution in the cattle branch compared with the
dog branch.

Relative rate tests were performed on a single merged
alignment and on each of the 84 multiple alignments
using Tajima's method [44,45]. Differences in mutation
counts were assessed using the χ2 test based on the
assumption that mutation would not show a species preference. When using human as an outgroup, cattle had
faster rates of substitution as compared to dog. Although
the difference was relatively small (6%), it was significant
by the χ2 test (P <0.0001) when the merged alignment was
tested. Almost two-thirds (54 out of 84) of the individual
alignment rate tests supported that cattle had faster rates,
while 11 of these rate tests supported that dog had faster
rates (including 5 from the greater CFTR region). The
remaining 19 out of 84 tests supported the molecular
clock hypothesis for the cattle and dog lineages (including
3 from the greater CFTR region).

Discussion
One of the fundamental challenges in large-scale comparative genomic analysis is to build biologically meaningful
multiple sequence alignments [18,46]. A variety of biological events are known to create insertion/deletions including lineage-specific amplification of tandem repeats,
homology-mediated genomic deletions and transposition
events [34]. Local alignment algorithms, combined with
the removal and reinsertion strategy of repeat elements,
have been shown to reduce the number of gaps in DNA
alignments and increase sensitivity [22,47]. This is particularly important for aligning the species like rodents
which have high genome-wide substitution rates. However, the aligned ancient repeats may be enriched for those
in more slowly changing regions, while the fast changing
repeats may be too divergent for detection and alignment
[21]. On the other hand, global alignment algorithms
seem appropriate for species with low substitution rates
like cattle, dog and human. Comparative gene mapping

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/140

and chromosome painting studies have indicated that a
remarkably slow rate of chromosomal change exists
within several mammalian orders. Artiodactyls and carnivores are more conserved relative to humans than rodents
[48-53]. In terms of genomic divergence, previous data [2]
also suggests that cattle and dog are more conserved relative to human. But global alignment algorithms assume
colinearity between sequences and do not specifically
handle synteny breaking events like transpositions, rearrangements (such as microinversions) or duplications
[54]. For example, global alignment algorithms may be
ineffective to treat lineage-specific repeats which are
closely matched such as young SINEs and LINEs, creating
suboptimal alignments [21]. These suboptimal alignments may lead to less accurate estimates of sequence
divergence. Therefore, in this study, alignment parameters
were optimized and a post-alignment filter was applied to
overcome the above limitation of the global alignment
algorithm. The post-alignment filter effectively removed
the suboptimal alignments from the mlagan output. Such
suboptimal alignments appeared abnormal because they
had extreme fluctuations in genomic divergences compared to their flanking sequences and were always associated with multiple gaps. Similar genomic divergence
results obtained in the current study compared to earlier
reports [10,12,30], confirm that our sequence datasets
were representative and our alignment strategies were successful.
Our orthologous sequence datasets, comprised of 10.5
Mb of cattle sequences, 9.3 Mb of dog sequences and 11.1
Mb of human sequences, were placed on all human chromosomes except for chr 9, 15, 19 and Y (see Additional
file 1 Table S3). As a control for sample bias and rate variation among these genomic regions, we mapped randomly selected cattle BAC end sequences onto the human
genome assembly Build35 (73,728 BES from CHORI-240
[31]). A comparison of these BES alignments to our largescale genomic alignments showed comparable results
(G.E. Liu et al, unpublished results). Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that these datasets are sufficiently representative and robust to draw sound conclusions
regarding rates and properties of mammalian genomic
mutation.
However, our estimates were consistently larger than
those in an earlier study of the greater CFTR region [2] and
revealed significant rate differences between the cattle and
dog lineages. Reanalysis of the alignments in that study
(116 kb cattle, 122 kb dog, and 332 kb human sequences,
68 kb aligned bases) indicated that the dog-human divergence (0.3335 ± 0.0046 change/site) was significantly
higher than the cattle-human divergence (0.3237 ±
0.0045 change/site) (Relative rate test, p <0.001). Comparable divergences were derived from our AR regions (369

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:140

kb cattle, 369 kb dog, and 485 kb human sequences, 157
kb aligned bases) from the same region (dog-human:
0.3856 ± 0.0035 change/site and cattle-human: 0.3870 ±
0.0035 change/site). In our study, no significant rate difference was detected between cattle and dog (Relative rate
test, p = 0.251). One possible explanation is that the global alignment algorithm mlagan was used to create multiple alignments in the current study while pair-wise
alignments were constructed by the local alignment algorithm – blastz in the earlier study. As discussed above,
local alignment algorithms are known to be less efficient
in identifying fast changing ancient repeats, which may be
too divergent to detect and align. This could lead to the
underestimation of the genomic divergences. On the
other hand, use of a global alignment algorithm can
recover the fast changing orthologous ancient repeats by
taking into consideration the conservation of nearby
unique flanking sequences. Discrepancies in the significance of rate variation between the small and large datasets also further highlight the importance of a large-scale
sampling strategy.
As expected, different sequence classes were under different purifying selection pressures. Coding regions were
under the strongest functional constraints with substitution rates at only half that of the overall substitution rates.
It is interesting to note that substitution rates in unique
noncoding portions were slightly less than overall substitution rates suggesting they may be under weak negative
selection due to unidentified functional regions, regulatory domains, or unknown genes. Significantly higher
substitution rates in repetitive elements before or after
removing CpG dinucleotides indicate that CpG content is
only partially the reason for high substitution rates. In
addition, other factors like increased rates of gene conversion, relaxed purifying selection and unequal crossover
among repeats may contribute to our observations.
The quadratic relationships between substitution rate,
branch length, K2 divergence, indel rate per 10 kb and
GC% were derived to explain regional variation. These
results suggest that fluctuations in GC% predict an appreciable amount of the regional variation that was observed
in mutation and indel rates, but leave the majority of the
variation unexplained. Additional causes beyond GC%,
including CpG content, recombination and other as of yet
unknown factors are needed to explain the variation
among mutation rates. Significant variation in mutation
rates across genomic regions and among sequence classes
strongly demonstrates that future studies of genomic variation should include multiple regions from different
chromosomes. Another important observation is that
regional variation in mutation rate is correlated among
cattle, dog and human lineages over time. Regional correlations of mutation rates have been demonstrated and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/140

quantified genome-wide in human-chimpanzee, humanmouse and human-rat comparisons [9,14,20].
It is also interesting to note that a handful of protein coding genes were detected within a few cattle BAC clones
with high neutral mutation rates. Several possible nonexclusive explanations for this phenomenon exist. For
instance, the sequences compared may not have been
orthologous. Within one gene family, paralogous genes
could be confused with orthologous genes. Gene conversion may have occurred, which could considerably
increase the genomic divergence [55]. In addition, high
mutation rates or relaxed purifying selection could have
occurred due to gene duplication [56,57]. These possibilities warrant further investigation. However, these rare
events would not likely significantly change our estimates
of mutation rates.
Measurement of the neutral mutation rate is crucial for
validating molecular clock and neutral evolution theories
[58,59]. The neutral mutation rate has been approximately estimated from neutral or close to neutral nonfunctional sites such as introns, pseudo-genes, unique
noncoding intergenic regions, four-fold degenerate sites
(4D sites) in coding regions (i.e. third codon position)
and shared ancestral repeats. One way to identify regions
under positive selection is to focus on DNA segments with
significantly higher mutation rates [56]. Genomic regions
that are changing significantly slower than the neutral rate
because of purifying selection contain potentially conserved noncoding functional elements [11,21].
Estimates of the neutral mutation rates in this study,
which are in agreement with many previous reports
[2,12,30], show that mutation rates in the cattle and dog
lineages are slower as compared with those in rodents.
However, our estimates around 2.0–2.2 × 10-9 change/
site/year are in the lower end of the reported range (2.1–
3.7 × 10-9 change/site/year) [11]. These differences could
result from the usage of 4D sites in the earlier studies, as
nucleotides in coding regions may not be an ideal dataset
because of codon usage bias and potential weak selection
[34]. Regions that harbored large, low copy repeat
sequences were excluded in this study to unambiguously
determine the orthologous relationship. Such segmental
duplicated regions may significantly inflate estimates of
divergence due to non-orthologous sequence relationships [46,60] or gene conversion [55].
The dataset presented here, though much large than those
used previously [2,12], is still a small part (0.4%) of the
cattle, dog and human genomes. It is also worth noting
that a number of the common assumptions made about
neutral mutation, genetic drift, generation-time and population size, can affect these estimates [34,61], and rate

calculations could be confounded by incorrect estimates
of species divergence times. More comprehensive genome
sequences and polymorphism data will be required to further clarify the important role of mutation rates in mammalian evolution. Further study of the molecular
mechanisms behind mutation will be essential to understand the causes of mutation rate variation. Additional
analyses will become feasible as the bovine genome
approaches the finishing stage.
Additional note
After the completion of this study, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the domestic dog genome reported
similar genomic divergence estimates between dog and
human [10].

Conclusion
The unique features of this study include 1) optimal multiple (not pairwise) alignments were carefully constructed
using a global (not local) alignment algorithm; 2) the
scale was considerably larger as compared to earlier
reports using small datasets of protein coding sequences
or targeted genomic regions and 3) Our results were statistically significant and unbiased as supported by the mapping results of genome-wide randomly selected cattle BAC
end sequences.
Therefore, this analysis provides a large-scale and unbiased assessment of genome divergences and regional variations of substitution rates among cattle, dog and
human. Cattle had faster average rates of substitution as
compared to dog and the difference was 6%. The global
molecular clock needs to be adjusted to fit rates among
mammalian species. These data will serve as a valuable
baseline for future molecular evolution studies, especially
in cattle and other livestock like sheep and pig.

Methods
The comparative analyses performed in the current study
were similar to those previously published [46]. However,
several improvements to the previous analyses were 1) the
use of three-way multiple sequence alignments instead of
comparison of several pairwise alignments; 2) the application of REV rate matrices and ML methods using the
PAML package [62] in addition to the simple K2 calculation; and 3) the optimization of alignment parameters
and filter thresholds to deal with larger sequence divergences.
Orthologous sequences
Large finished genomic sequences were retrieved from cattle BAC libraries (CH240 and RP42) from GenBank. Cattle sequence segments longer than 50 kb in length were
then extracted and masked for common repeat elements
[63,64]. Orthologous dog and human sequences were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/140

identified by sequence similarity searches [65] of cattle
sequence queried against a formatted version of the
assembled dog (canFam1, July 2004) and human (hg17,
May 2004) genomes [32] using the following options
(blastall -p blastn -U T -e 1e-05 -q -2 -r 1 -W 11 -G 3 -E 1 b 25). Overlapping sequences within a species were
excluded based on the genome assembly coordinates and
sequence identity. We excluded any accession located
within a known duplicated region of the human genome
[60], because duplicated regions of the genome complicate identification of orthologous segments and confound
genomic divergence estimates [18,46]. Because the assembly of the dog genome is based on only seven-fold "shotgun" sequence coverage, our analysis was limited to
genomic sequences completely finished and containing
no gaps or internal ambiguous bases. A total of 84 cattle
clones and subclones (see Additional file 1 Table S3) met
these criteria: 69 were generated by Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center [66]; 12 were
generated in National Institutes of Health Intramural
Sequencing Center [67] as a part of a targeted comparative
sequencing effort (the ENCODE – ENCyclopedia Of DNA
Elements Project) [2,16,17]; and the remaining 3 were
generated at the University of Oklahoma, Advanced
Center for Genome Technology [68]. A complete list of all
accessions, their consensus assemblies, their map locations with respect to the genomes of dog and human and
their sequence attributes are provided (see Additional file
1 Table S3).
Genomic sequence alignment
Orthologous sequences were extracted using parasight visualization software (J.A. Bailey, unpublished results) [69].
The mlagan algorithm [23] was used to construct all threeway multiple sequence global alignments. A subset of gap
opening and gap extension penalties was chosen to minimize the frequency of both single-nucleotide substitution
and insertion/deletion events in order to provide the most
biologically meaningful optimal global alignment (See
Results and Discussion). For equally parsimonious gap
parameters, selected parameters (gap opening penalty of 1,000 and gap extension penalty of -10) were used so that
known "young" transposition events were treated as a single insertion/deletion event. A total of 84 three-way multiple alignments for cattle, dog, and human (total
alignment lengths ~15.5 Mb) were constructed with mlagan using ~10 Mb of genomic sequence from each species.
All alignments were manually inspected for extreme fluctuations in genomic divergence. A suboptimal alignment
was defined as any alignment which exceeded 3 standard
deviations of the mean pairwise genomic divergence
(window size 2 kb, slide 100 bp). These regions were considered separately in the analysis (Table 1). A total of 89
such subalignments were classified as suboptimal for cattle (732 kb), dog (619 kb), and human (822 kb). Only a

small fraction (<5%) of all aligned bases was classified as
suboptimal.

Genomic divergence estimates
The branch lengths were calculated by maximum likelihood using version 3.15 of the PAML package, which
allows base frequency change, all bases exchangeability
and rate heterogeneity across sites (Table 1) [62]. The
most general reversible substitution model (REV) was
used (model = 7), rate variation among sites was allowed
(fix_alpha = 0 and ncatG = 5), no molecular clock was
assumed (clock = 0), unrooted trees were used, and ambiguity characters were discarded (cleandata = 1). Kimura's
two-parameter (K2) method, which corrects for multiple
events and transversion/transition mutational biases [70],
was used to estimate genomic divergences in pairwise
comparisons. Genomic divergences or branch lengths
were always reported as the means ± their standard deviations. Insertion/deletion events were not factored into
these calculations [71]. Coding, UTR, unique noncoding
and repetitive regions from the sequence alignments were
extracted using MaM (Multiple Alignment Manipulator)
[36,72]. Repeat coordinates were identified using the slow
option of RepeatMasker v3.0.5 with an updated RepBase
library for cattle. Five major classes of repeats were considered in this analysis (LINEs, SINEs, LTR, DNA Transposons, and others). In order to eliminate the possibility
that more divergent or novel common repeats may not
have been effectively masked by RepeatMasker, intraspecific sequence-similarity searches were performed. Exon
definition was limited to well-annoted human genes
(NCBI RefSeq) [35,73]. Among these, a total of 1,909
exons corresponding to 193 genes were analyzed. The
coding regions were extracted from exonic sequences
between CDS start and end sites. The UTR regions contained both 5'-UTR (between transcription start and CDS
start sites) and 3'- UTR (between transcription end and
CDS end sites). Unique noncoding regions excluded both
exonic and repetitive regions. Non-overlapping sliding
window analyses (3-kp in Fig. 1, Additional file 1 FigS5A
and 500-bp in Fig. S5B) were performed using align_slider
(J.A. Bailey, unpublished results). Substitution rates were
calculated from the LCA of cattle and dog using branch
length/time assuming branch times of the cattle, dog and
human lineages of 83, 83 and 101 mya, respectively
[27,28]. All alignment attributes were maintained within
a MySQL database which facilitated cross-referencing with
various properties of the genomic sequence. Tajima's relative rate tests were performed on multiple alignments
using MEGA3 [45]. ANOVA was performed to test variation in branch lengths of whole alignments or 3-kb nonoverlapping windows between and within autosomal
chromosomes in cattle, dog, and human. Quadratic
regression fits were implemented using the SigmaPlot
software package.
