Abstract
Background: The efficacy of treatment in hemianopic patients to restore missing vision is
controversial. So far, successful techniques require laborious stimulus presentation or restrict
improvements to selected visual field areas. Due to the large number of brain-damaged patients
suffering from visual field defects, there is a need for an efficient automated treatment of the total
visual field.
Methods: A customized treatment was developed for the reaction perimeter, permitting a timesaving adaptive-stimulus presentation under conditions of maximum attention. Twenty hemianopic
patients, without visual neglect, were treated twice weekly for an average of 8.2 months starting
24.2 months after the insult. Each treatment session averaged 45 min in duration.
Results: In 17 out of 20 patients a significant and stable increase of the visual field size (average
11.3° ± 8.1) was observed as well as improvement of the detection rate in the defective visual field
(average 18.6% ± 13.5). A two-factor cluster analysis demonstrated that binocular treatment was
in general more effective in augmenting the visual detection rate than monocular. Four out of five
patients with a visual field increase larger than 10° suffered from hemorrhage, whereas all seven
patients with an increase of 5° or less suffered from infarction. Most patients reported that visual
field restoration correlated with improvement of visual-related activities of daily living.
Conclusion: Rehabilitation treatment with the Lubeck Reaction Perimeter is a new and efficient
method to restore part of the visual field in hemianopia. Since successful transfer of treatment
effects to the occluded eye is achieved under monocular treatment conditions, it is hypothesized
that the damaged visual cortex itself is the structure in which recovery takes place.

Background
There are only a few known treatment approaches to
restore loss of vision due to a cerebrovascular accident
(CVA or stroke) of the posterior part of the brain. Impairment of visual function, among which corresponding visual field loss in both eyes (homonymous hemianopia) is

the most common type, will result in legal blindness so
that one has difficulties to read, orientate oneself, ambulate or drive a vehicle.

In some of these patients, there may be spontaneous
recovery of vision loss, usually within the first weeks or
months after the incident [1].
After early recovery in the first few months, few studies
describe attempts to treat homonymous hemianopia. Zihl
and von Cramon [2,3] report that the repetitive presentation of threshold stimuli in the transition zone between
the intact and defective visual field (VF), or the saccadic
localization of targets presented within the anopic field
may result in increased VF up to 27° (a) and 48° (b) of
visual angle, respectively. In a replication study, however,
Balliet et al. [4] observed an average increase of less than
1 degree as a consequence of the same treatment.
Recent evidence in favor of treatment effects, derives from
an attempt to reduce VF defects in patients with post-chiasmatic and optic nerve injuries by using a personal computer monitor for stimulation [5]. The authors claim that
sequential suprathreshold stimulus presentations in 150
training sessions within the defective VF resulted in an
average increase of detection rate of 29% in post-chiasmatic and 74% in optic nerve patients, when diagnosed
with static perimetry. According to conventional static
perimetry testing used as a secondary outcome measure,
however, the group of post-chiasmatic patients did not
show any training effect (0.43° ± 0.34). Support for the
recovery hypothesis is also given by earlier studies in primates, demonstrating that after discrete striate cortex ablations, a decrease of the scotoma size was obtained by
visual discrimination testing as a training method or by
saccadic eye movement training [6-9].

Methods
To evaluate whether restoration of VF in patients with
homonymous hemianopia is possible, and if so, to
improve the efficacy of treatment, the Lubeck Reaction
Perimeter (LRP) (fig. 1) was designed [10,11].
The Lubeck Reaction Perimeter
The basic construction of the perimeter is a hemisphere
with an inner radius of 70 cm. This size has been selected
to guarantee a minimum of accommodation strain for the
patient. Background luminance of the inner hemisphere
surface is equal to 0.014 cd/m2. At the pole of the hemisphere, a red LED serves as a fixation element. 1740 green
LEDs (∅ = 30', dominant wavelength λ = 571 nm, maximum luminance L = 3200 cd/m2) are used as light stimulus elements. They are distributed homogeneously at a
distance of 3° within the inner hemisphere on isoazimuth- and isoelevation-lines. Luminance values of LEDs
may be modified in steps of 0.2 logarithmic units. Two
loudspeakers for auditory stimulation are situated below
the hemisphere. A personal computer uses a special software permitting a) assessment of the VF size by random

presentation of stimuli, and b) treatment by sequential
and repetitive stimulation of LEDs in order to focus the
patient's selective attention to stimulated areas. Patients
must respond to the detection of any lit LED by pressing a
reaction-time key. Each visual stimulus is announced by a
random (500 – 2000 ms) auditory warning stimulus (f =
1000 Hz) to raise attention before visual stimulation.
Reaction times have to fall into a time window of 150 –
900 ms after the visual stimulus. In the assessment mode
a variety of fixed LED arrays with different stimulus densities and distributions can be tested. These software
options allow for fast and comprehensive surveys of the
size of the VFs and assessment times between 5 and 45
minutes, including automated breaks every 3 – 5 minutes
to prevent fatigue. All locations and reaction times are
stored; median, arithmetic mean, standard deviation and
type and number of errors are calculated. The reaction
time distribution within the VF is presented in different
colors on a PC monitor and may be printed.

Treatment
Since most of the studies on brain plasticity research
assume that selective attention plays a key role for VF
recovery treatment, special efforts were undertaken to
ensure a high level of attention whenever visual stimuli
were presented. To perform a most active role during treatment, the patient must respond immediately by pushing
a button ("simple-reaction-time paradigm") whenever a
light stimulus was perceived. Simple reaction times (SRTs)
measured the performance level. There is a close relationship between SRT prolongation and threshold augmentation, a characteristic feature of defective visual fields [12].
While fixating on the central LED, 100 ms flashes were
shown in a pre-selected area of the patient's VF (i.e. "treatment area"). Fixation was controlled by monitoring eye
movements with a low luminance sensitive video camera,
sessions with improper fixation being rejected. Measurements demonstrated an accuracy to detect eye shifts of 1°
amplitude. The treatment area always included areas of
intact VF. Stimulation started within the intact VF and successively moved into the anopic VF area. Chance
responses were very unlikely due to the small time window of allowed SRTs after the random auditory warning
signal. In the case of no or delayed (901 – 1400 ms)
response, a low frequency (f = 500 Hz) tone was given as
a negative feedback signal to increase the patient's attention. When the patient failed to respond to two successive
stimuli, the next stimulus began 12° back, where perception had been successful. This procedure was repeated
three times before stimulating on the next iso-elevation or
iso-azimuth line (fig. 2).

The advantage of this adaptive treatment algorithm is that
stimulation is automatically adjusted to the current VF
border and is concentrated on the transition zone
between the intact and defective VF. Within a typical 45
minutes treatment session, about 500 stimuli were presented in the treatment area.
Measurement of visual field size
To calculate improvement in kinetic perimetry (Goldmann-type Tubingen perimeter) due to treatment, the difference of the damaged kinetic VF before and after
treatment was calculated. Each time the VF size was
obtained by measuring the VF extension along each 15°
meridian including the 90° and 270°meridian (vertical)
and calculating the average. The change of detection rate
(static perimetry) within the damaged VF due to treatment, as measured with the LRP was obtained by calculating the difference before and after treatment. At any time
the detection rate was calculated as the percentage of correct responses within the whole hemifield. Within an
intact hemifield 350 responses were possible. If for example a patient gave 100 correct responses before his treatment, his detection rate at that time would be 100:350 =

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

28.6%. If for example he performed 130 correct responses
when tested after treatment, his detection rate would be
130:350 = 37.1%. The improvement due to treatment in
that case would be 37.1% - 28.6% = 8.5%.
Patients
Patients were included in the study who met the following
criteria: no ocular or oculomotor pathologies, no fixation
instabilities, a corrected visual acuity of ≥ 0.67, no permanent attentional deficits (neglect), no major motor deficits, no pronounced memory, speech or intellectual
deficits. Line bisection tests and behavioural testing were
performed to exclude neglect. Investigational approval
was given by the University of Luebeck Medical Ethics
Committee. Twenty right-handed patients with homonymous hemianopic visual defects resulting from cerebral
lesions were selected on the basis of regular patient availability and motivation to participate in a long-time study
of approximately one year. Lesions included infarction (n
= 11), hemorrhage (n = 7) and closed head trauma with
post-traumatic subdural hematomas (n = 2). Lesion sites
and size were documented by computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Before treatment, all patients received careful neurological and ophthalmological evaluation. The average age was 53.5 years
(range: 21 – 80). Nine patients were female and eleven
were male. Nine patients suffered from additional paresis
mostly of the brachio-facial type which, however, permitted them to climb the stairs to the third-floor of our institute building. Before and after perimetry treatment, vital
eye parameters (intraocular pressure, fundus and optic
nerve papilla) and basic visual functions such as acuity,
binocular fusion, stereopsis, central und peripheral form
and color vision, incremental thresholds, critical flicker
fusion frequency (CFF), were measured. In some selected
patients only brightness perception, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and the patient's ability to localize visual and
auditory stimuli in space were investigated. Assessment of
vital eye parameters and visual subfunctions was performed at least at base line and at the end of treatment in
most patients, however; the assessment was performed
after several post-treatment intervals (ranging from six
months to more than ten years).

VF evaluations were performed with manual-kinetic perimetry with the Tubingen Perimeter and automatic static
perimetry with the LRP. Patients were asked to perform
"exercise" perimetry measurements to familiarize themselves with the measuring procedures and to obtain stable
pre-training VFs and to establish a stable perceptual criterion when a stimulus is evaluated as seen and must be
responded to. Both types of measurements were done at
least three times: at baseline, at the end of treatment and
after an interval of six months up to more than ten years.
Besides measuring the treatment outcome and stability of

treatment effects ourselves by using two types of perimetry
(automatic static and kinetic) and other functions, in
some of the out-of-town patients conventional threshold
perimetry was performed by the patient's ophthalmologists, not involved in this study.
The interval between lesion and onset of treatment ranged
from 1 to 105 months (average: 24.2 ± 26.4 months); in
only three patients (# 3, 4, 17) it was shorter than six
months. In eight patients no spontaneous VF recovery had
been observed; in twelve patients spontaneous improvements of VF size had occurred before treatment. See fig. 3.
Within an average time of 8.2 months (range: 2 – 27) a
mean number of 73.0 ± 31.8 (range: 34 – 169) treatment
sessions (approximately two per week) were performed by
each patient. Treatment was executed with both eyes open
in 13 patients, while 7 randomly selected patients were
treated with one eye patched to test for interocular transfer
of treatment effects to evaluate the cortical effects of treat-

ment. The majority (n = 13) of patients were treated binocularly since that type of treatment was reported to be
less exhausting with respect to maintaining fixation and
keeping attention than monocular training.
To keep the patient's motivation at a high level and complete therapy, each patient was informed about his respective daily treatment performance at the end of each
treatment session. In addition, patients were asked from
time to time, or reported themselves spontaneously,
whether they experienced treatment-related improvements of visual functions, such as VF size, acuity and
behavior, e.g. reading or bumping into obstacles/activities
of daily living (ADL).
No control group was included within the study since 1)
in the majority of patients the stability of pre-treatment VF
size was guaranteed by comparing the results of external
perimetry (usually several years old) with our own pretreatment results 2) control of spontaneous recovery in

patients with fresh lesions (< six months; n = 3) was critically investigated by treating only one part of the defective
field at a time and comparing the changes in the treated
and non-treated VF part (within-patient control). Of the
patients (#3, 4, 17) with fresh lesions, no VF improvement was observed in the non-treated VF area. 4) motivation has proved to be a very important parameter in the
patient's will to participate in a long-term study, coming
several times a week over a nine-month period to our
institute, to perform a very demanding and sometimes
frustrating treatment. Beyond ethical objections against a
sham treatment, it would have been very unlikely that our
patients could have been permanently motivated to participate in such a long-time therapy study from which the
did not perceive any improvements over the months, even
if a visual handicap such as hemianopia represents a serious motivation to perform therapy

Results
The outcome of sensori-motor treatment, using the selfadaptive stimulus algorithm of the LRP, was measured
with manual-kinetic and/or automated static perimetry.
Due to time restrictions before treatment, in twelve
patients only both types of perimetry testing could be performed. In the majority of patients, treatment had been
effective, resulting in a distinct increase of their VF size
and stimulus detection rate within the former anopic VF
area. An example of treatment efficacy in a patient suffering from a bilateral occipital lesion and a consecutive VF
defect in both hemifields is given in fig. 4.
Kinetic perimetry outcome
In 17 of 20 treated patients, VF size was assessed by manual-kinetic perimetry. Of these 17 patients, 15 demonstrated an average VF increase of 11.3° ± 8.1 (range 2 to
+30°) for both eyes averaged (fig. 3). There were only two
patients of 17 who demonstrated a slight reduction (-2°,
– 3°) of their kinetically measured VF after treatment. In
one of them (#5), however, the detection rate in static perimetry in his damaged right VF after treatment had
increased by 5%. The other patient (#18) was the only
patient who had permanent fixation difficulties during
treatment. Suffering from a right hemisphere hemorrhage
of the middle cerebral artery, she never maintained precise fixation when stimuli were presented in her treatment
area though she was able to fixate properly during randomized VF assessment. Including those two patients with
minor VF losses, the average increase of the whole group
of 17 patients due to treatment was 9.6° ± 8.8 (fig. 3). Out
of the 15 patients demonstrating VF increase, the VF
enlargement ranged a) in seven patients below 10° b) in
six patients between 11 and 20°, and c) in two patients
between 21 and 30° (fig. 5 upper part).

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

Static perimetry outcome
Static perimetry was used in 15 out of 20 patients to evaluate the outcome of LRP treatment. Due to time constraints before treatment, in the remaining five VF size
before and after treatment was measured only by kinetic
perimetry. The average improvement of detection rate for
both eyes within the defective VF was 18.6 % ± 13.5
(range: -5.5 to + 46 %). Since the average detection rate is
based on a normal VF size which is given a detection rate
of 100%, an increase of the detection rate of 18.6 % indicates an increase of usable VF area by 18.6 %, nearly onefifth of a normal VF. In only two patients the detection
rate decreased during treatment by -2.5% and by -5.5 % (#
8, 10). In both patients, however, kinetic perimetry demonstrated a slight (#8: +2°), or a moderate (#10: +14°)
increase of VF size. Out of the 13 patients demonstrating
an increase of detection rate, the average binocular
increase ranged a) below 10% in two patients, b) between
10 and 20% in four patients, and c) between 20 and 46%
in seven patients (fig. 5 lower part).
Stato-kinetic dissociation
When comparing changes in static and kinetic perimetry
due to VF treatment in individual patients who had been
investigated with both types of perimetry (n = 12), three
patient clusters can be distinguished: patients who
showed similar changes in both types of perimetry (cluster A consisting of two patients # 2, 11), patients in whom
changes in static perimetry were larger than in kinetic perimetry (cluster B) containing seven patients #3, 5, 7, 12 –
14, 20, and patients in whom changes in static perimetry
were smaller than in kinetic perimetry (cluster C) three
patients # 6, 8, 10).

In cluster A, changes in static perimetry average 11.5%
(range +6 to +17%), changes in kinetic perimetry average
12.25° (range +5 to +19,5°). In cluster B average change
in static perimetry equals 20.8% (range +5 to +32.5%)
whereas the average change in kinetic perimetry is much
smaller: 5° (range -3.0 to +13.0°). In cluster C the average
change in static perimetry equals 3.5% (range -5.5% to
+18.5%), whereas the average change in kinetic perimetry
equals 15.3° (range +2 to 30°). No significant correlation,
however, was found between the degree of change demonstrated by static and by dynamic perimetry when the
data of all patients were pooled into one group.
Stability of VF increase after the end of treatment
In 15 of 20 patients, VF size (kinetic perimetry) and detection rate (static perimetry) were investigated at least six
months after the end of treatment; 13 demonstrated no
decrease of VF size and detection rate. In one infarction
patient (# 5) who had demonstrated an ambiguous treatment outcome, detection rate had further increased
(+4%) during the follow-up interval of twelve months,

whereas the kinetically measured VF size had again
decreased by 2° after a 3° reduction during treatment. In
another patient (#6) within one year after the treatment,
a second hemorrhage of her right middle cerebral artery
had occurred which completely reversed her treatmentinduced VF improvement of 30°. It finally resulted in a
nearly complete hemianopia of her left VF, whereas the
result of the first insult had been only a quadrantanopia.
Several months of treating that second defect, however,
was much less effective than treating the initial one.
In one patient (#20) suffering from a bilateral lesion of
the posterior cerebral artery, stability of treatment effects
have been demonstrated for more than ten years. Fig. 6
shows the results of the first 5 years and 7 months after
CVA for a selected area and a zenith angle of Θ = 50°.
When first measured by kinetic perimetry, the VF border
(for the detection of white light) in the upper right VF
quadrant ran close to the horizontal meridian (Θ = 0°), in
the left VF even far below the horizontal (Θ = 180°)
meridian within the lower left VF quadrant. After some
spontaneous recovery of the whole VF, treatment of the
upper right quadrant (phase I = 89 sessions, starting one
month after CVA) resulted in an increase of only the
treated quadrant. The course of incremental threshold T
curves for Θ = 50° over the whole period of 67 months
(fig.6 large image) demonstrates a VF border shift ∆Φ of
approx. four degrees and a general decrease of T within 9
months (fig. 6 large image from CVA to 10). Within
another 66 months, the VF border was step-by-step shifted
into the anopic quadrant (towards Φ = 40° at 67) and T
was gradually lowered. In parallel to that VF border shift
and decrease of the incremental threshold, the magnitude
of perceived subjective brightness of test stimuli – when
comparing to a foveal comparison stimulus CS of equal
size and luminance – within the restituted VF increased.
After a post traumatic interval PTI of total 67 months, as
demonstrated in fig. 6 small image, the course of the
100% subjective brightness curve in the upper right quadrant (67 months PTI) was located far in the former anopic
VF area. Its location increased with increasing eccentricity
(= zenith angle Θ) demonstrating a maximum at Θ = 40°.
With increasing Θ the difference between the VF border
for detection of light (fig. 6 small image b) and perceived
100% brightness (s) first increases (0 ≤ Θ ≤ 20°) then
decreases gradually again towards 2° at Φ = 40°. At this
position (Φ = 40°), close to the VF border, patient #20
thus perceived a stimulus as bright (= 100%) as at the
foveal VF position. At that time, seventy-six months after
CVA, the VF border for the detection of form (curve f in
fig. 6 small image) ran far in the former anopic VF at a distance ∆Φ of about 5 to 10° within the VF for brightness
detection (curve b in fig. 6). And visual acuity had recovered from 0,1 to 0,7.

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

In fig. 7 the course of reaction times RT, thresholds T and
(subjective) perceived brightness estimations S of patient
# 20 after treatment (10 months after CVA as in fig. 5 = 11
months after insult) are shown for an eccentricity = zenith
angle of θ = 50° as a function of the distance (∆Φ) from
the anopic VF border, to especially demonstrate the close
relationship between particular visual parameters. As a
consequence of treatment, at θ = 50° the VF border
(kinetic perimetry) had between displaced into the anopic
area by ∆Φ = 8° and T had been lowered between within
an area of 15° width [3 < Φ ≤ 18°] up to a factor of 16. As
demonstrated in fig. 6, T increases from intact to anopic
VF, from approx. T = 1 at the horizontal meridian (Φ = 0°,
Θ = 50°) to T = 1,000 at Φ = 18 °, Θ = 50° (VF border as
determined by measurements of T, detection rate > 50%).
As can been seen from fig. 7, with approaching the anopic
VF from ∆Φ = 15° to 0°, RT increases exponentially: from
320 ms to 470 ms, whereas the magnitude of perceived
brightness S decreases from 100% to 61%. Simultaneously the quality and size of the perceived stimuli change
from clear to diffuse ("like the moon behind clouds") and
small to large, when a stimulus is presented at ∆Φ = 0. The
function RT = f (S) can be a approximated by a linear function (r = -0.8): with increasing brightness by 25%, reaction time decreases by approx. 40 ms.
This example may demonstrate that more than four years
after the end of the initial treatment (phase I), the VF size
for brightness and form detection, as measured with
kinetic perimetry, had increased considerably, compared
to the end of spontaneous recovery and beginning of the
treatment, one month after CVA. Within the restituted VF,
the quality of vision, as indicated by low thresholds, good
form and brightness perception was stable for another
seven years (total follow up interval was 13 years).
Group differences of treatment outcome
Monocular versus binocular treatment
In seven randomly selected patients treatment was performed with only one eye open to test for transfer of treatment effects to the occluded eye. In six of those seven
patients (# 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 19) treated monocularly,
treatment resulted in VF enlargement (kinetic perimetry)
in the treated as well as in the non-treated eye. In only one
patient kinetic perimetry did not reveal a positive treatment effect (# 5). For the whole group of patients treated
monocularly, the occluded eye showed about the same
improvement from treatment as the open eye did: a
+6.2% ± 16.4 increase of detection rate and 8.9° ± 11.9
increase of VF size in the occluded and a +6.6% ± 12.5
increase in detection rate as well as a 7.8° ± 6.8 increase of
VF size in the open eye.

A two factor cluster analysis was performed to test for the
influence of the type of treatment ocularity (monocular

Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation 2007, 4:31

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

binocularly, whereas in cluster 3 with the lowest increase
there were only patients (n = 5) who had performed the
treatment monocularly. Though monocular treatment is
apparently effective in raising the detection rate, binocular
treatment has three to four times the effect of monocular
treatment. Out of the eight patients of fig. 5 upper part
demonstrating an increase of detection rate above 10%,
seven had performed the treatment with both eyes open,
whereas the four patients with the smallest improvements
were treated monocularly.
When the above two factor cluster analysis was applied to
change of VF size in degrees of visual angle obtained by
kinetic perimetry, results were less obvious. In this case 2
clusters were obtained. Cluster 1 demonstrating an average VF size increase of 15.69° ± 9.30 contains three
monocularly and five binocularly treated patients whereas
cluster 2 showing an average VF size increase of 4.28° ±
4.62 includes 4 monocularly and five binocularly treated
patients.
Nature of lesion
As mentioned in section 4.1, a two factor cluster analysis
with the factors 1) ocularity of treatment and 2) type of
the lesion had been performed to search for factors influencing the degree of treatment outcome in different
patients. In eleven patients VF defects had been caused by
infarction, in nine patients by hemorrhage (n = 7) or
closed brain trauma with post-traumatic subdural
hematomas (n = 2). Within the cluster analysis treatment
efficacy was analyzed with respect to the nature of the
lesion (factor 2), comparing treatment outcome in
patients with infarction and hemorrhage. The group of
patients suffering from hemorrhage included both
patients with subdural hematomas.

versus binocular; factor 1) and of the type of the lesion
(infarction versus hemorrhage; factor 2) on the LRP treatment outcome. When static perimetry was used as an outcome measure cluster analysis demonstrated three
clusters. The average change of detection rate equals
19.625 % ± 3.64 (cluster 1), 28.08 % ± 10.17 (cluster 2)
and 6.30 % ± 13.34 (cluster 3). Within the two clusters
demonstrating the highest increase of detection rate due
to treatment there were only patients (n = 6 in cluster 2
and n = 4 in cluster 1) who had performed the treatment

When change of the VF size in kinetic perimetry was used
as a treatment outcome variable, the cluster analysis demonstrated two clusters differing significantly in the degree
of treatment outcome. In cluster 1 the average VF enlargement equals 15.69° ± 9.30, in cluster 2 the average VF
increase equals 4.28° ± 4.62. Cluster 1 contains only
patients (n = 8) who suffered from hemorrhage, cluster 2)
consist only of patients (n = 9) in whom VF loss had been
caused by infarction.
When using change of detection rate in static perimetry as
a treatment outcome variable, cluster analysis resulted in
three clusters. The average treatment effect in those clusters equals as follows. Cluster 1: 19.625 % ± 3.64, cluster
2: 28.08 % ± 10.17, cluster 3: 6.30 %. Cluster 2 demonstrating the maximum treatment effect contains only
patients (n = 6) in whom the VF defects was caused by infarction. Cluster 1 with the second highest treatment efficacy consists only of patients (n = 4) with lesions due to

hemorrhage. Cluster 3 with the lowest gain contains four
patients with infarctions and one with hemorrhage. In
contrast to clusters 1 and 2 in which all patients performed the treatment with both eyes open, cluster 3 contains only patients who performed the treatment
monocularly.
When comparing both outcome measures of change of
VFsize in a) degrees of visual angle and b) percentage of
detection rate, results are controversial. In kinetic perimetry patients suffering from hemorrhages (cluster 1 kin)
demonstrate the highest gain, whereas in static perimetry
patients with infarctions (cluster 2 stat) profit the most
from treatment.
Unfortunately the influence of the lesion type and ocularity of treatment variables cannot be separated, since in
kinetic perimetry both clusters contain some patients of
any type of treatment ocularity.
Transfer of treatment effects to other visual functions than
VF change and to performance of activities of daily living
Visual acuity
Out of the 20 patients, in 13 (# 1–7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 19, 20)
central visual acuity of both eyes had been reduced due to
CVA, in seven acuity had remained unchanged. Out of
those 13 patients, spontaneous recovery of acuity had
occurred before VF treatment in eight (# 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13,
15, 20), in two patients (#2, 10) acuity even had worsened
some time after CVA, and in three patients no report was
given. After VF treatment, partial or complete restoration
of visual acuity was measured in ten (# 1–7, 11, 19, 20) of
those 13 patients who had suffered from acuity reduction
due to CVA, whereas in three of them (# 10, 13, 15) no
change was found.
Form and color vision
Impairment of central visual acuity due to CVA (in 13
patients) was always associated with a reduction of form
(shape) perception in the the fovea and within any possible residual VF of the affected hemifield (s). In three
patients (# 14, 16, 18) form recognition was reduced after
CVA without a decrease of foveal acuity.

In eight patients CVA had resulted in impairment (# 5, 6,
16, 18–20) or complete loss (#7, 15) of color vision,
either foveally or within the affected hemifield(s). Loss of
acuity, form or color perception in the affected residual –
not completely anopic – VF, caused by cerebral defects, is
termed "amblyopia". In only two (# 16, 18) of the eight
color amblyopic patients, color amblyopia was not associated with a reduction of central visual acuity, but
occurred together with form amblyopia.

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

After VF treatment in ten patients (# 1–3, 7, 10, 14, 16,
18–20) form perception was improved moderately by an
average of 16% [range 10 to 28] as demonstrated by either
increasing the detection rate to presentation of oriented
lines or/and enhancing the area size within the amblyopic
VF where different forms could be discriminated from
each other. This improvement of form perception was
observed though no specific form treatment had been performed by that time. Out of eight patients suffering from
color amblyopia due to CVA, in five cases (#7,16, 18–20)
a moderate increase [average 15%; range 7 to 23%] of
color perception ability had resulted, too, as the consequence of VF treatment, without any color treatment. The
changes were observed when comparing the patient's performance on either the Farnsworth- Munsell 100-hue discrimination test or the size of the color amblyopic VF to
color stimuli of equal size, form and luminance before
and after VF treatment. In each of those five patients, the
ability to discriminate forms had increased, too, as a consequence of pure VF treatment, indicating some kind of
stimulus "generalization" effect.
Activities of daily living
The ability to perform visual related activities of daily living (ADL) such as reading, avoiding obstacles, orienting
in space, walking, riding a bike, manipulating with things
in the house or garden and working was evaluated by
semi-structured pre- and post-treatment interviews and by
the patient's spontaneous communications during treatment, whenever distinct improvements were made.
Patients were asked to answer whether their performance
had improved or worsened or was unchanged after treatment. Fourteen patients reported improvement of at least
five out of the above seven activities, two did not perceive
improvements (#8, 15); and four (#2, 11, 13, 17) were
not sure. Patients who reported not to have noticed
improvements, actually did not demonstrate any
improvement when investigating their acuity, form or
color discrimination ability. Three out of the four patients
not being sure about ADL improvements (#11, 13, 17)
did not suffer from acuity, form and color deficits after
CVA and did not show any changes after VF treatment.
Obviously an increase of those functions is more likely to
be detected by the patients than gradual VF enlargements
or their own behavioral changes: all but one (#9) patient
demonstrated improvement of at least one out three functions tested (visual acuity, form or color perception).

Discussion
The aim of the present investigation was to introduce a
new and efficient automated treatment device and technique to restore VFs after cerebrovascular accidents not
suffering from supplementary attention deficits (neglect).

to cortical lesions, an average of two sessions per week

visually guided ADL. These effects were clearly distinguished from spontaneous recovery since the average
interval between the lesion and the beginning of therapy
was 24.2 months. Only in three patients the interval had
been shorter than six months. By comparing size and
detection rate in treated and untreated VF areas it was
demonstrated that in all cases visual recovery was limited
to those parts of the defective VF which had been subjected to visual stimulation. This is in accordance with our
early observations when a manual threshold stimulation
technique had been used [13-15] for treatment.

during a period of little more than eight months of ambulatory treatment with the LRP were sufficient to enlarge
VFs by an average of 11.3° ± 8.1 and enhance the detection rate within the defective VF area by 18.6% ± 13.5. Out
of twelve patients who had been subjected to both static
and kinetic perimetry, in ten stato-kinetic dissociation
occurred as a result of treatment, mostly (n = 7) in favor
of demonstrating better results in static perimetry outcome. In addition, acuity, form and color perception
increased moderately in the majority of the patients who
had suffered from a reduction of these functions besides
hemianopia due to CVA. Generalization of improvement
occurred, though no specific treatment besides superthreshold monochromatic stimulation with small circular
LEDs had been performed. Fourteen out of 20 patients
reported transfer of treatment effects to improvements of

Comparison with earlier studies
The success of the current study, using suprathreshold
stimulation in a SRT paradigm to enlarge VFs in hemianopic patients, confirms in part the outcome of earlier studies, using repetitive threshold stimulation or saccadic
localization techniques [2,3]. Zihl and von Cramon [2]
demonstrated an average VF increase of 10.2° in twelve
patients with lesions of the post-geniculate visual pathways obtained within 9 – 37 sessions of repetitively measuring contrast thresholds in an area close to the anopic
part of the VF. When using saccadic treatment procedures
Zihl and von Cramon [3] in 21 of 55 patients demonstrated VF increases between 6 and 48° which, however,
were never observed along the whole anopic field border
(as in our patients) but were instead restricted to particular regions. In a replication study by Balliet et al. [4] with
twelve patients suffering from hemianopia or quadrantanopia, an average of 36 sessions of threshold or saccadic
training failed to reproduce the treatment effects seen by
Zihl and von Cramon. They had, however, used much
smaller stimuli (6' in diameter instead of 69') than in the
original investigations. Confirmation of the treatability of
VF defects in patients with cerebral insults, however, was
derived from studies using a PC monitor for stimulation
[5,16]. Eighty to 300 training sessions resulted in an
increase of the stimulus detection rate by 41.6% in nine of
eleven patients [16]. The authors, however, made no statements on the corresponding changes of actual VF size.
Within a recent study [5] 150 sessions each in 19 patients
with post-chiasmatic lesions resulted in an average
increase of the detection rate of 19.6%. The VF size after
treatment as obtained by conventional static computer
perimetry, however, showed an increase of only 0.43°.
Though the data of both computer treatment studies
[5,16] support the hypothesis that visual perception in
hemianopic patients may be improved by treatment, their
method of calculating improvements of detection rates
has to be regarded with caution. There are two reasons: 1)
their data refer to a relative small segment of the total VF
which is covered by the monitor (30° × 25°), and 2) their
data are calculated as "change over baseline" in which
baseline values (before treatment) were taken as 100%.
Due to this definition, in a patient who for example had

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation 2007, 4:31

detected two stimuli within the monitor area before treatment, a post-treatment detection of four stimuli would
result in an increase of 100%. In contrast, according to our
method of calculation a detection rate or improvement of
100% equals to the complete hemifield. Based on this calculation method we found an increase of detection rate
(binocular average) due to treatment by 18.6% and a
kinetic enlargement by 11.3° (binocular average). When
averaging the normal temporal half-field of one eye and
the ipsilateral half-field of the other eye, the normal average VF eccentricity equals to 68.5°. An increase of 11.3°
by treatment thus corresponds to an average VF increase
by 16.4%. Thus, the static and kinetic improvements
found in the current investigation are similar, whereas
those of Kasten et al. [5] differ considerably from each
other: in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions their
increase of detection rate equals to 19.6%, contrasted by a
change of VF border position of only 0.43°.
In the most recent study [17] using software and a PC
monitor for stimulation, 17 hemianopic patients performed visual restoration training during a six-month
period. To evaluate the treatment effect, the size of the VF
defect before and after treatment was quantified with the
help of a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. In none of the
patients, however, an explicit homonymous change of the
absolute field defect border was observed.
In addition to studies aiming at recovery of VFs in patients
suffering from cerebral lesions, few studies were dedicated
to the training of compensatory techniques in those
patients. Besides the aspired improvements of visual
search efficacy, as a side-effect Kerkhoff et al. [18]
reported, that after saccadic and visual exploration training, one third of their patients demonstrated an increase
in VF size of 5 – 7°. Reading training had a similar effect:
In 34% of hemianopic patients who participated in reading training, an average VF enlargement of 5.4° was
obtained after 15–24 training sessions, besides enhancements of reading speed and accuracy [19]. In contrast,
Pommerenke and Markowitsch [20] did not find any significant VF enlargement after saccadic localization training.
Stato-kinetic dissociation
When measuring VF in hemianopic patients, different
methods may result in different size and shape. This effect
is known as stato-kinetic dissociation or "Riddoch phenomenon" [21] and is regarded as a type of amblyopia
and – during spontaneous recovery – as a positive prognostic indicator of ongoing improvement, and moreover
was regarded to have topodiagnostic value, of occipital
lesions, in times before CT or MRI imaging [21] Usually
moving stimuli are detected more easily and kinetic perimery results in large VFs. On the other hand, too slow

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

movements (< 3–4°/s) of test stimuli may not be detected
[22]. In rare cases the inverse effect of stato-kinetic dissociation was observed: stationary stimuli were detected
more easily than moving [23,24]. This inverse effect in
some cases is related to lesions in the occipito-temporal
region of patients, an area known as V4 which from studies in primates [i.e. [25]] is regarded as sensitive for
"motion perception".
In all our patients pre- and post-treatment kinetic perimetry was performed by the same very experienced investigator (author FS) at appropriate stimulus velocities of 3–4°
allowing for prompt reaction. Before treatment no statokinetic dissociation was observed after the end of spontaneous recovery (eleven of twelve patients in whom both
types had been performed). Within the other patient (# 3
with a PTI < 6 months) who was investigated since one
month after CVA, kinetic and static VFs also did not differ
from each other during spontaneous recovery.
Differences between kinetic and static perimetry occurred
only as a consequence of treatment. In only three (patient
# 6, 8, 10; cluster C) of them increases in kinetic perimetry
were larger than in static (corresponding to the typical
Riddoch phenomenon), in seven patients (cluster B) treatment-induced changes were more pronounced in static
perimetry. In two of the patients of cluster C (with posterior cerbral artery lesions) actually only kinetic perimetry
did show improvements, whereas static perimetry did
show a slight VF size reduction instead. The only patient
(# 6) of cluster C suffering from a hemorrhage of the middle cerbral artery, however, regained 30° of her kinetic VF,
but only 18.5% of her VF measured by static perimetry.
Restoration of movement perception is believed to eventually involve phylogenetic older and extrastriate pathways and may occur even if only small neuron
populations did survive the insult ([1] and see discussion
below). During spontaneous recovery in hemianopia,
many authors report a certain sequence: recovery of 1.
movement perception, 2. perception of white light, and 3.
color perception.
The largest cluster B – showing the inverse Riddoch phenomenon – mainly contains patients suffering from infarctions of the posterior cerebral artery. The higher degree
of restoration in detecting static stimuli in this majority of
patients may as well result from the special LRP treatment
technique which uses only static stimuli. Differences in
the amount and type of restoration in individual patients,
may in general reflect a variability of activation of cortical
and eventually subcortical areas and has to be the subject
of further investigations (see discussion below).

Potential structures and mechanisms involved in recovery
All lesions of our patients were of cortical origin. If cortical
structures were involved in the recovery process, too,
monocular treatment should also result in VF improvement of the eye occluded during the treatment, since the
majority of visual cortex neurons can be activated by stimulation of both eyes. In fact, in six of seven patients who
had received monocular LRP treatment, the VF size
increased to similar degrees for both, the treated and
occluded eyes. In addition our data demonstrate that
treatment is more effective under binocular viewing conditions. When treatment was performed with both eyes
open the change of detection rate was three to four times
higher (clusters 2: 28.08% and 1: 19.625%) than under
monocular treatment conditions (cluster 3: 6.30%). Most
of visual cortex neurons respond stronger when stimulated binocularly. This supports the hypothesis that binocular cortical areas are engaged in the process of
restoration, if they were not the only structures responsible for recovery. A similar observation has been made by
Zihl and von Cramon [2] who found improvements of the
same magnitude for the treated and the occluded eye. The
recovery of visual cortex neurons is the most likely explanation, too, of pronounced improvements of cortical
VEPs observed by some authors [26,27] in hemianopic
patients after treatment. Further support of the visual cortex being the potential location of recovery, is also given
by early animal findings of Cowey [7]. In contrast to a
training-induced decrease of the scotoma size after a partial lesion of the visual cortex in monkeys [6,8], no recovery with practice was found when the lesion was located
in the retina [7]. Restoration of function, however,
strongly depends upon preservation of a certain amount
of cortical tissue [28]. Recently Tegenthoff et al. [29] demonstrated the efficacy of their PC-based visual stimulation
therapy in partially rehabilitating visual functions in
patients with post-traumatic cortical blindness. These
patients are generally believed to suffer from permanent
blindness [30]. The authors interpreted their positive therapy outcome as a sign of a high degree of neuronal plasticity of the visual cortex. Axonal sprouting over a period
of several months [31] and functional reorganization of
existing cortical synaptic connections, as seen within the
somatosensory system, are believed to be potential candidates for the physiological repair mechanisms of visual
recovery after repetitive light stimulation. Eysel and coworkers [32,33] demonstrated that: 1. focal lesions in cat
visual cortex induced a short-latency spontaneous
enlargement of receptive fields at the border of the lesion
and a shift of retinotopy from the region lost by the lesion
to surviving cells adjacent to it, and 2. approximately one
hour of visual training of those neurons may result in a
temporary expansion of the receptive field towards the
stimulated side of the receptive field. As a possible mechanism underlying the training effect, the authors suggest

http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/4/1/31

that formerly sub-threshold geniculo-cortical synapses
became suprathreshold due to a mechanism such as long
term potentiation LTP.
In accordance with those findings it is possible that reactivation of surviving neurons within that part of the damaged visual cortex itself (representing the transition zone
from intact vision to anopia) is the mechanism underlying treatment-induced recovery phenomena in hemianopic patients [5]. In many of our patients of an earlier
investigation and as is i.e. demonstrated in patient # 20
(fig. 6), VF recovery was not restricted to the extent of the
transition zone with a gradual decrease of contrast [34].
The final VF gain due to treatment was a multiple of the
size of the initial transition zone. This may indicate that
numerous initially "silent" neurons outside the transition
zone must have been activated by repetitive light stimulation. In addition to primary visual cortex, other structures
may be involved in the process of visual restoration, as is
demonstrated by a recent report on spontaneous recovery
in a patient suffering from bilateral occipital lobe damage.
Despite MRI and PET scans still indicated cortical hypermetabolism, the patient's VF in one hemisphere had
recoverd [35]. An increase of regional cerebral blood flow
rCBF, however, was seen in the pulvinar thalami and the
lateral geniculate nucleus [36]. As has been discussed
before by several authors in the context of "blindsight",
these structures belonging to the extra-striate visual system, may contribute to visual restoration. Further information with respect to the role of subcortical nuclei is
expected from our ongoing investigations with the help of
functional imaging including fMRI.
The importance of attention in recovery
In patients with severe damage to visual cortical areas V1
and V2 resulting in a very small remaining VF, fMRI measurements during visual stimulation revealed diminished
activation in the striate cortex but increased activation in
extrastriate areas of the frontal eye fields, supplementary
eye fields and superior parietal cortex, never seen in control subjects [37]. These structures are believed to be part
of a network that is related to eye movements as well as
spatial attention during visual perception. Independent of
the side of residual V1 activation, significant activation of
frontal cortical areas was found only within the right hemisphere. When visual functions had recovered completely,
fMRI data reveal that activation of the primary visual cortex was re-enhanced (comparable to improvement of cortical VEPs) whereas extrastriate activation had
disappeared. These data are in accordance with our
hypothesis that the lesioned cortex itself is one of the
important locations where recovery takes place and in
addition points towards the role of structures related to
attention.

The importance of attention for visual recovery during visual stimulation treatment has been stressed by other
authors before [2,5,29]. Focusing attention and stimulation on the intact VF or focusing attention on the anopic
VF without visual stimulation [38] do not have an effect
on VF size. The same is true for visual stimulation during
every day life. In 1917 Poppelreuter [22] already commented, that after the initial phase of spontaneous recovery, further improvement can only be acquired by
systematic treatment. Successful treatment has to combine attentional and stimulus-related aspects. In the
present study in which the majority of patients did profit
from therapy, special efforts were undertaken to prevent
fatigue and to keep global attention at a high level only
when necessary. Spatial attention was selectively attracted
to the stimulated VF areas by successively displacing stimulus positions to adjacent LEDs so that the very next stimulus location could be anticipated.
Transfer of treatment effects on activities of daily living
The aim of enlarging hemianopic VFs by treatment is to
improve the patient's daily performance in manipulating
things, visually orienting, walking around, driving or
reading. In only two studies so far the effects of visual
treatment on daily living have been investigated. Within
the study of Zihl and von Cramon [3] as in ours, only
some of the patients noticed their treatment induced VF
enlargement. Unlike in our study, these reports depended
on the eccentricity of the VF border. In the study of Kasten
et al. [5], out of 30 patients with post-chiasmatic and optic
nerve lesions, treated in front of a computer monitor and
responding to a questionnaire eighteen (60%) had experienced subjective improvement of vision due to treatment, a percentage close to the 70% in the present study
using a reaction perimeter for treatment. Since treatmentinduced restoration of VF is attended by improvement of
a variety of functions such as visual acuity, incremental
threshold and to some extent of form and color vision (of
which the change of the latter two functions point to a certain degreee of generalization) VF increase in this study is
interpreted as a result of sensory perceptual improvements rather than of changes of detection and response
criteria by patients.

influence from structures of the attentional network.
Compared to other methods, such as repetitive threshold
measurements, saccadic localization or PC training, the
treatment performed with the Lubeck Reaction Perimeter
provides an efficient, automated technique to obtain a stable partial recovery of visual field areas, which results in
better visual performance in everyday life of brainlesioned patients.

In conclusion, visual field treatment in hemianopic
patients, using a specially-designed automated-treatment
perimeter, resulted in distinct and sustained recovery of
part of the visual field in the majority of patients. This
treatment was most effective when performed under binocular viewing conditions. Most of the patients reported
improvements of visual acuity, form perception and a successful transfer of visual field increase to amelerioration of
visually guided activities of daily living. The damaged cortex itself appears to be the most likely structure of visual
field recovery. This may, however, require facilitatory
