Abstract
Background: At least three species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) cause tick-borne Lyme
disease. Previous work including the genome analysis of B. burgdorferi B31 and B. garinii PBi
suggested a highly variable plasmid part. The frequent occurrence of duplicated sequence stretches,
the observed plasmid redundancy, as well as the mainly unknown function and variability of plasmid
encoded genes rendered the relationships between plasmids within and between species largely
unresolvable.
Results: To gain further insight into Borreliae genome properties we completed the plasmid
sequences of B. garinii PBi, added the genome of a further species, B. afzelii PKo, to our analysis, and
compared for both species the genomes of pathogenic and apathogenic strains.
The core of all Bbsl genomes consists of the chromosome and two plasmids collinear between all
species. We also found additional groups of plasmids, which share large parts of their sequences.
This makes it very likely that these plasmids are relatively stable and share common ancestors
before the diversification of Borrelia species.
The analysis of the differences between B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo genomes of low and high
passages revealed that the loss of infectivity is accompanied in both species by a loss of similar
genetic material. Whereas B. garinii PBi suffered only from the break-off of a plasmid end, B. afzelii
PKo lost more material, probably an entire plasmid. In both cases the vls gene locus encoding for
variable surface proteins is affected.
Conclusion: The complete genome sequences of a B. garinii and a B. afzelii strain facilitate further
comparative studies within the genus Borrellia. Our study shows that loss of infectivity can be
traced back to only one single event in B. garinii PBi: the loss of the vls cassettes possibly due to
error prone gene conversion. Similar albeit extended losses in B. afzelii PKo support the hypothesis
that infectivity of Borrelia species depends heavily on the evasion from the host response.

Background
Infections with Borrelia species cause thousands of human
disease cases per year [1]. The major causative agents of
this disease are three species of the Borrelia burgdorferi
sensu lato complex (Bbsl), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B.
garinii, and B. afzelii [2-4]. As was shown previously using
phylogenetic tree reconstructions [5,6]B. garinii and B.
afzelii are more closely related than either of them to B.
burgdorferi sensu strictu, which branches at the basis of the
three-species tree. Borreliae are obligatorily bound to host
organisms for survival. During their life cycle they switch
from the invertebrate host tick (Ixodes spec.) to various
vertebrate hosts via a tick bite. The range of vertebrates
and invertebrates used as hosts is thought to be mediated
by factors encoded mainly on a large number of different
plasmids found in Borreliae genomes. A further characteristic of the plasmids is their wealth of paralogous genes.
During passage plasmids can be lost due to the lack of
selection pressure as was shown recently [7]. This loss can
be accompanied by the inability of Borreliae to prosper in
the host. Furthermore, it is thought that Borreliae plasmids
are not stable and are frequently rearranged leading to differing plasmid content within a species [8,9]. To some
extent the chromosome is also involved in fission/fusion
events. It was shown that the right end of the chromosome of B. burgdorferi strains is variable due to its ability
to catch plasmid material [10]. The high variability of Borreliae genomes has so far hindered a concise description of
the genome properties of Borreliae based on plasmid size
estimates and hybridizations alone.
Comparative genomics aims at the description of related
organisms based on their common and discernible
genetic material [11-13]. Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of the relationship between genotype and phenotype, if clear-cut phenotypic differences are described for
the species in question. In case of prokaryotes a genome
comparison can e.g. discern common genomic backbones
from otherwise acquired genetic material [14].
To date the complete genome of B. burgdorferi sensu
stricto (B31) is known [15]. It exhibits a wealth of circular
as well as linear plasmids, some of which are nearly identical [8]. In a more recent study we reported on the
genome of a B. garinii strain [16]. This comparative
genomics approach showed clearly that three genomic
elements, the chromosome and plasmids cp26 and lp54,
are common to both Borrelia species and, more strikingly,
collinear. At the same time we were able to show that
some plasmids are confined to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto,
since no trace of these plasmids including their coding
capacity could be found in the whole genome shotgun
sequencing (WGSS) data of B. garinii PBi. Yet, at this time
it was not possible to give a clear picture of the plasmid
content of B. garinii PBi, since plasmidal sequences were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/211

distributed over 36 sequence contigs that did not represent entire plasmids.
In this study we determine the complete sequences of the
B. garinii PBi plasmids and the whole genomic sequence
of a third species, B. afzelii PKo [GenBank: CP000397,
GenBank: CP000398, GenBank: CP000399, GenBank:
CP000400, GenBank: CP000401, GenBank: CP000402,
GenBank: CP000403, GenBank: CP000404, GenBank:
CP000405, GenBank: CP000406]. Furthermore, we
wanted to shed light onto the requirements for pathogenicity in these species. For this purpose, sequences from
pathogenic low passage and from high passage strains,
which have lost their pathogenicity, were combined to
yield the entire genome sequences of these two Borrelia
strains.

Results
Chromosome and plasmid sequences
As we had previously shown by the genome analysis of an
early (12th) passage of B. garinii PBi [16] a coverage as low
as 3× is sufficient as a basis for genome analysis of Bbsl
species. Extending this approach we applied low coverage
WGSS to a late (300th) passage of B. garinii PBi as well as
to early (8th) and late (70th) passages of B. afzelii PKo. The
resulting sequences were assembled species-wise to give a
coverage of around 6 for each genome (Table 1). Of the B.
garinii genome we sequenced equal amounts of clones
from high and low passage strains; of the B. afzelii genome
only one third of all sequences were derived from the low
passage strain. Employing additional gap closure procedures, we obtained nearly gap free genomic sequences.
Contigs or parts thereof consisting only of low passage
DNA derived clones were considered to have been lost
during cultivation.
Collinearity and indels of the Bbsl chromosomes
Both B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo genomes have collinear chromosomes of comparable sizes (Table 1) with
only minor insertions and deletions. Pairwise alignments
using stretcher revealed that most indel positions in B.
garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo are shared compared to B.
burgdorferi B31 (Table 2) indicating a closer relationship
between these two species than to B. burgdorferi B31. Most
indels are small, but we also observed three regions
exceeding 500 bp in B. afzelii. One of these differences
between the chromosomes of Bbsl species is attributable
to differing sequences at the origin of replication in the
middle of the chromosome. The second affects the bmp
locus at position 394,080 of the B. burgdorferi chromosome. We previously noticed that this locus is incompletely duplicated in B. garinii PBi compared to B.
burgdorferi B31 [16]. Now, with a third sequence at hand
we see that this locus seems to be instable in all species. In
B. afzelii PKo this locus is incompletely triplicated. Most

interestingly, the duplication events observed produce
only functional copies of bmpA. All other duplicated bmp
genes are rendered truncated during the duplication event
(Fig 1). The third large indel affects a further outer membrane protein gene (lmp1), thus contributing to the diversity of the protein orthologs and possibly to the variations
in the host pathogen interaction.
Striking differences in the plasmid content
The Bbsl plasmid fraction varies significantly between different species. Whereas the B. garinii PBi plasmids comprise only 29 % of the genome, the B. afzelii PKo plasmids

add up to 36 % (Table 1). Yet, this is still well below the
plasmid content of B. burgdorferii sensu stricto (47 %) [8].
Assemblies of the respective reads yielded 11 plasmids for
the B. garinii PBi genome and at least 16 for the B. afzelii
PKo genome (Table 3). Circular plasmids can be defined
as finished once no gap remains in the sequence and the
ring is closed. Using this criterion, we were able to define
three circular plasmids in B. garinii PBi. In B. afzelii PKo
we detected two circular plasmid types. On of these types
comprises a group of eight very similar plasmids resembling the situation in B. burgdorferi B31. We were not able
to completely resolve this group of eight plasmids since

they are highly similar, if not identical, over long sequence
stretches. This renders impossible the correct assignment
of a considerable number of clones to a specific plasmid
and PCR approaches to close gaps between plasmid segments. Only one plasmid with a size of over 30 kb could
be entirely finished. Yet, the extraordinarily high identity
of the group members to each other led us to the conclusion that all members of this group are circular.
We tested using PCR approaches, whether any of the
remaining sequence contigs could be only part of another
plasmid. Using this method, we closed 15 gaps between
segments with unambiguous sequences. The remaining
segments could not be linked together, since no or no
unique PCR products could be produced with any of the
combinations of ends possible. We sequenced several of
the PCR products from primer combinations, which gave
rise to more than one PCR product. Sequences derived
from all these products were either of low sequence quality indicating PCR product mixtures or located elsewhere
in the genome. Thus, since we were not able to find addi-

tional links between the sequence segments described
here, we conclude that most of the described segments are
indeed individual plasmids of these species and are supposed to be linear. The plasmid size range extends from 6
to over 60 kb (Table 3). Plasmid names were chosen
according to size and to their circular (cp) or linear (lp)
nature. The sequence reads of the small fragments in the
range of 6 to 15 kb in both species were only found in low
passage strains (see below).
The strain of B. garinii we present here has the fewest
number of plasmids of all Borrelia species analysed so far.
Including the indispensable cp26 and lp54 orthologs,
there are three circular and eight linear plasmids. Conversely, the B. afzelii PKo genome comprises nine circular
and seven linear plasmids.
Plasmid homologies between Borrelia species
We wondered whether we would be able to detect additional relationships between plasmids of different species
besides the clearly homologous plasmids cp26 and lp54.

In a first step we examined the relationships within a species. Most prominent in this respect are the B. burgdorferi
B31 circular plasmids in the range of 30 kb, which are
highly similar to each other with only minor sequence differences over large parts of the plasmids. We observed a
homologous group of plasmids also in B. afzelii PKo,
where we found 8 circular plasmids with a size of 30 kb.
This group may even include further plasmids, since we
were not able to assemble this group fully. Furthermore,
despite the length differences between the two circular
plasmids cp29 and cp31 the B. garinii PBi plasmids constitute a similarity group as shown by tupleplot analysis
[see Additional file 1]. A three-species comparison
revealed that all these circular plasmids belong to the
same group and originated from a common ancestor.
Most strikingly and despite their high sequence diversity,
which renders an interspecies alignment difficult, these
plasmids exhibit a conserved collinearity [see Additional
file 1]. Intriguingly, these plasmids are amplified and
diversified (i.e. they exhibit polymorphisms to each
other) in all species albeit with differing copy numbers.
The most remarkable distinguishing feature within this
group of plasmids is the length difference observed in B.
garinii PBi. An all-to-all comparison of the other plasmids
showed that there are additional plasmid groups with a
common ancestor although with slightly different lengths
and minor unique sequence portions (Table 4 and Additional file 1).
To classify these plasmids we had to relax the criteria,
according to which plasmids are grouped together. Thus,
the minimal requirement for a group is to have detectable
similarities (using tupleplot, see materials and methods)
over a significant part of their sequence length irrespective
of rearrangements. As is listed in Table 4 we can define six
different groups according to their common presence in
all Bbsl species. Group VI is the least well defined group
since the similar sequence stretches are divided up in B.
burgdorferi between three different plasmids. All other
groups contain plasmids, of which the similar DNA
sequences seem to be stably inherited within individual
plasmids.
The relatedness between the plasmid content of B. afzelii
PKo and B. garinii PBi is notable. Their plasmids within
the same groups are more related to each other concerning
size, shared similarity and extent of rearrangements than
to the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto counterparts. Conversely,
the otherwise highly amplified group III plasmids have
undergone a reduction in the B. garinii PBi genome,
whereas some other group specific plasmids were amplified (groups IV and VI).

Low passage versus high passage strains – genomic
differences
As mentioned above we did not use a uniformly grown
culture for the construction of whole genome shotgun
libraries. Instead, we used low and high passage strains of
the same isolate. The major difference between low and
high passage is the loss of infectivity during repeated passages [9,17,18]. These strains should have accumulated
only minor numbers of single base differences due to the
short time of separation. Indeed, single nucleotide
exchanges on the chromosomes were very rare. We found
only 26 such events in B. garinii PBi and even less in B.
afzelii PKo (4). We think that loss of infectivity is accompanied by larger changes in the genome of the strains, i.e.
loss of whole parts of the genetic material.

In case of B. garinii PBi we found all plasmids represented
in both the low passage as well as the high passage culture.
This is in good agreement with previous findings, where
no plasmid differences could be detected in low and high
passage strains of B. garinii PBi [9]. Yet, a small fragment
of 6 kb was not detectable in the high passage strain shotgun data. An analysis of the gene content revealed, that
nearly all of the 6 kb segment is occupied by cassettes of
the vls gene cluster. This cluster was previously mapped to
a 28 kb linear plasmid in B. garinii [19]. Yet, this fragment
could not be assigned to one of the other plasmids despite
testing all combinations possible using specific primers
for all linear plasmid ends. It is very unlikely that we
missed an entire plasmid with our shotgun cloning
approach. Thus, this failure may be due to the repetitive
nature of the vls locus and/or its frequent cassette switchings [20,21], which makes the generation of matching
unique primers impossible. Using different primers on
this fragment we were able to amplify several DNA species
of different lengths from the low passage strain (Fig. 2).
Amplification in the high passage strain yielded a product
only for the leftmost primer pair. All PCR products were
sequenced and were confirmed to be derived from the correct genome position. This indicates that most of the vls
cassettes and the vls gene itself was lost during passaging.
A Southern blot analysis confirmed that the entire vls
locus is missing in the high passage strain [see Additional
file 1].
The genomic losses of B. afzelii PKo are more severe than
those of B. garinii PBi. In B. afzelii, three segments with the
cumulated size of 30 kb seem to be missing in the high
passage strain. Previous results suggested the loss of a 31
kb and a 6 kb plasmid from the high passage strain of B.
afzelii PKo [9]. Despite our inability to connect these segments via PCR it is very likely that these segments constitute two linear plasmids in B. afzelii PKo, The assembly of
the plasmids consists almost entirely of low passage strain
DNA material. Sequence reads of two clones derived from

the high passage strain suggest that this loss is not
achieved as a sudden event but progresses gradually
within the culture. One of the segments (8 kb) contains a
part of the vls gene cluster. Moreover, we found additional
reads with similarities to vls gene and cassette fragments
solely in the low passage shotgun data (adding up to 4
kb). Again, we were not able to connect all these reads to
other plasmid contigs using PCR approaches. We therefore conclude that the vls cluster is missing from the high
passage strain of B. afzelii PKo. Previous Pulsed Field Gel
experiments indicated the loss of a 6 kb and a 31 kb linear
plasmid from the high passage strain. Thus, the 8 kb and
the 15 kb fragment together with the vls cluster should
form this 31 kb linear plasmid, the 6 kb fragment is therefore one entire linear plasmid. Interestingly, the fragments
of vls genes we sequenced do not properly align with the
previously published sequence of the entire 8 kb vls locus
of B. afzelii [21]. This finding demonstrates that this locus
is highly polymorphic due to casette switching and
homologous recombination.

Discussion
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato chromosome differences
The chromosomes of Bbsl species harbour only minor differences between them. This includes right arm extensions, which may be derived from linear plasmids and
three major indels. Interestingly, two of these indels affect
outer membrane proteins, thus contributing to the surface
diversity between the species. This is most clearly seen at
the bmp locus, where the copy number varies and the
duplicated genes deviate slightly from the original
sequence (Fig. 1). Since these differences are fixed in the
respective genomes, it is likely that this diversity may contribute to subtle variations in the host range and initial
success to invade the host.

Homologous plasmid groups in Borrelia species
The analysis of the B. burgdorferi plasmids [8] showed a
wealth of similar regions of differing sizes residing on several plasmids. Our previous genome analysis of B. garinii
PBi resulted in the assembly of the plasmid compartment
in 37 segments, which in comparison to the B. burgdorferi
plasmids revealed both common and unique sequences
[16]. Yet, due the fragmented data set it was impossible to
directly compare the entire plasmids. This work now
presents the nearly gap-free sequence of the plasmids not
only from B. garinii PBi but also from B. afzelii PKo.

All species contain three seemingly invariable and indispensable parts, the chromosome, a cp26 like circular plasmid, and an lp54 like linear plasmid. They are relatively
well conserved and collinear. All other plasmids cannot
directly be aligned between species due to a low sequence
similarity. Furthermore, comparisons of genes on amino
acid level can obscure real relationships between plasmids
due to unclear orthology. Yet, tupleplot analysis revealed
a striking overall similarity of long stretches of some plasmids with others within and between species. Therefore,
despite high sequence and length variability, as well as
broken collinearity, we can describe groups of plasmids
apparently derived from a common ancestor (Table 4).
The most prominent group consists of circular plasmids
in the size range of 30 kb, which are highly amplified in
B. burgdorferi B31 and B. afzelii PKo but not B. garinii PBi.
The two B. garinii counterparts to this group are more
diverse in size and sequence than in the other species indicating an accelerated evolution towards a higher diversification and possible secondary reduction of this group.
The plasmids of this group encode outer membrane factors, erp proteins, which are thought to be involved in
host range definition [22]. Since B. garinii PBi therefore is

able to produce only two different erp proteins, the host
range of this species is potentially reduced compared to
the other two species. Groups IV and V share large parts of
their sequences between species albeit with some intraplasmid rearrangements. The weakest homology shows
group VI where similar plasmid segments are dispersed
over different plasmids in B. burgdorferi B31. Intriguingly,
intra-plasmid divergence and shuffling seems to be
favoured over inter- plasmid rearrangements. This finding
indicates that the Borrelia genome is more stable and less
prone to recombinations than previously thought [8].
Unique plasmids (i.e. with less than 50 % sequence similarity to any other plasmid) occur in all three species.
These may contribute to the disease variations or adapta-

tion to different environments. A previous study relying
on Southern blots using probes derived from B. burgdorferi
B31 plasmids showed relationships between the probes
and plasmids of different strains and species [23]. Only
one probe was used per plasmid restricting conclusions
on homologies between plasmids to only the probe specific regions. Yet, in most cases this study is in agreement
with our findings if possible cross-hybridisations with
small similar regions are taken into account. The most
prominent difference is within group VI. Our results indicate homology of lp25 to lp21-2 and lp22, whereas
Palmer et al. detected homology to a 30 kb linear plasmid.
We therefore conclude that the 6 kb fragment harbouring
th vls gene cluster is most likely connected to one of these

plasmids. This is also in good agreement to previous findings, where the vls cluster of B. garinii was located on a 28
kb linear plasmid [19].

process of plasmid loss. In this scenario the vls cluster is
lost first as in B. garinii PBi, and in a second step the non
essential remainder of the plasmid is lost successively.

From all sequence information, we can define three evolutionary trends: i) in B. garinii some plasmids (group IV
and VI) were duplicated and diversified at the expense of
plasmids from group III that are highly amplified in other
species ii) unique plasmids in each species were either
acquired by horizontal transfer [24] or diversification of
existing plasmids. iii) plasmids of B. afzelii PKo and B.
garinii PBi are more similar to each other than to those of
B. burgdorferi B31 as it is especially pronounced in group
VI. This is in good agreement with phylogenetic tree
reconstructions using different genes [5,6] and implies
that at least these defined plasmid groups evolved without
horizontal gene transfer.

Interestingly, in the tick vector the vls locus seems to be
silent [26] and thus is stable in this host. This can explain,
why the accidental loss does not occur in nature.

Together, the three way comparison presented here provides a concise description of the plasmids of Bbsl and
offers new insights into their evolutionary origin.
Loss of genetic material and infectivity during passage
Borrelia species can lose their infectivity, when passaged
several times without selection pressure for infectivity.
This loss is accompanied by loss of genetic material
[18,25]. It is not possible to estimate the extent of this loss
based solely on PFGE or PCR, especially if the whole
genomic sequence is not known. We therefore sequenced
and analysed low and high passage strains of B. garinii as
well as of B. afzelii together to be able to describe all
sequence differences and to determine the cause of lost
pathogenicity.

Surprisingly, not a whole plasmid but only a part of a plasmid was lost during passage in B. garinii PBi. The remaining part of the plasmid was either retained by chance or is
essential. The lost part consists of vls gene cassettes whose
frequent exchange is involved in the escape of B. burgdorferi from the host response [19,20]. Thus, this selective
loss may be caused by the failure to correctly repair the
locus after recombination. Absence of selection pressure
then allows this clone with the truncated plasmid to prosper in the culture. In order for the entire culture to lose the
locus, cassette switching errors must be frequent or the
mutated clone has a substantial growth advantage.
In B. afzelii PKo an entire plasmid is missing in the high
passage strain. This plasmid also contained the vls genes as
could be concluded from the presence of a few vls cassette
derived reads. Loss of entire plasmids could occur if the
plasmids are not correctly divided up between the daughter cells during division. Yet, we found that two sequences
in the assembly of the fragments (Table 3) are derived
from the high passage strain DNA indicating a two step

Thus, loss of infectivity is accompanied in both species by
the loss of the vls locus. While this loss seems to be the
sole reason for the loss of infectivity in B. garinii PBi, the
influence of the additional material lost in B. afzelii PKo
on infectivity remains to be determined. Yet, we believe
that this additional loss occurred only by coincidence due
to the non essential nature of the remaining parts of the
plasmid. This leaves the vls locus as the prominent but
fragile cause for the successful thriving of Borrelia species
in their respective vertebrate hosts.

Conclusion
Comparative sequencing is a valuable tool to discern species specific and common genetic material. Our analysis
of genomes from B. garinii and B. afzelii strains together
with the previously described B. burgdorferi B31 genome
shows that more plasmids are indispensable for B. burgdorferi sensu lato than previously thought. In Borreliae lack
of selection can lead to the loss of genetic material accompanied by a phenotype change. A base by base analysis of
these losses as we made it here can not only reveal genes
important for the phenotype change upon their loss but
also gives clues about underlying mechanisms for the
losses. Further studies on additional low and high passage
strains should reveal whether the loss of the vls cassette is
the major or even single causative event which leads to
loss of infectivity.

Methods
The B. garinii strain PBi (OspA serotype 4) is a CSF isolate
from a German patient with neuroborreliosis. Passage 12
is still infectious for gerbils, but infectivity was lost
between passage 30 and 60 [27]. B. afzelii strain PKo was
originally isolated from human skin [28], the early passage is still infectious as can be demonstrated with gerbils.
Early (8th subculture) and late (70th subculture) passages
of B. afzelii PKo and a late passage of B. garinii PBi (300th)
were grown in MVP-medium as described [29].
DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Bufferset
(Quiagen GmbH, Hilden) and Genomic tip 500/6 and
100/6 (Quiagen, GmbH, Hilden). Genomic libraries with
a target insert size of 1.5 kb using total DNA were constructed as described previously [16]. From all libraries
sufficient clones were sequenced from both ends to give a
sequence coverage of at least 5× per species (see Table 1).

All sequences were checked for similarity to chromosomal
or cp26 and lp54 sequences of B. burgdorferi using BLAST
[30] and assembled separately as described previously
[16]. All other plasmid sequences were assembled
together and manually checked for assembly errors. In the
case of the multiple copies of cp30 in B. afzelii we used
polymorphism and read pair information to generate
unambiguously assembled contigs. This enabled us to
define at least 8 different plasmids according to the placement of the contigs on a common backbone. Since we did
not know, which contigs related to linear plasmids form a
natural unit, we performed a PCR based analysis of possible connections between all segments. We tested all possible combinations of segment ends to determine
combinations that produced PCR products when using
whole genomic DNA as a template. Resulting PCR products were sequenced and used to close gaps in the plasmid
assemblies. No further unambiguous PCR products were
obtained linking the ends of the contigs. Thus, the
obtained sequences represent either a full set of linear
plasmids or, as may be the case for the smaller segments,
missing links due to the inability to design unique primer
pairs.

Additional material

Initial gene finding was performed using GeneMarkS
[31,32]. Annotation was done using the GenColors system [33].

The alignments between the Borreliae collinear chromosomes [see Additional file 1] were generated using the program stretcher, which is part of the EMBOSS package [34].
The similarity plot program tupleplot [35] with default
settings was used for a systematic comparison of plasmids
of all species to each other.
