Abstract
Background: Cell specific gene expression is largely regulated by different combinations of
transcription factors that bind cis-elements in the upstream promoter sequence. However,
experimental detection of cis-elements is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. This provides a
motivation for developing bioinformatic methods to identify cis-elements that could prioritize
future experimental studies. Here, we use motif discovery algorithms to predict transcription
factor binding sites involved in regulating the differences between murine rod and cone
photoreceptor populations.
Results: To identify highly conserved motifs enriched in promoters that drive expression in either
rod or cone photoreceptors, we assembled a set of murine rod-specific, cone-specific, and nonphotoreceptor background promoter sequences. These sets were used as input to a newly devised
motif discovery algorithm called Iterative Alignment/Modular Motif Selection (IAMMS). Using
IAMMS, we predicted 34 motifs that may contribute to rod-specific (19 motifs) or cone-specific (15
motifs) expression patterns. Of these, 16 rod- and 12 cone-specific motifs were found in clusters
near the transcription start site. New findings include the observation that cone promoters tend
to contain TATA boxes, while rod promoters tend to be TATA-less (exempting Rho and Cnga1).
Additionally, we identify putative sites for IL-6 effectors (in rods) and RXR family members (in
cones) that can explain experimental data showing changes to cell-fate by activating these signaling
pathways during rod/cone development. Two of the predicted motifs (NRE and ROP2) have been
confirmed experimentally to be involved in cell-specific expression patterns. We provide a full
database of predictions as additional data that may contain further valuable information. IAMMS
predictions are compared with existing motif discovery algorithms, DME and BioProspector. We
find that over 60% of IAMMS predictions are confirmed by at least one other motif discovery
algorithm.
Conclusion: We predict novel, putative cis-elements enriched in the promoter of rod-specific or
cone-specific genes. These are candidate binding sites for transcription factors involved in
maintaining functional differences between rod and cone photoreceptor populations.

Background
Experimental identification of DNA sequence motifs that
bind specific transcription factors (cis-elements) and regulate gene expression are expensive, time-consuming, and
difficult. This makes bioinformatic methods for identifying cis-elements an important tool for prioritizing future
experimental studies of transcriptional regulation. Rod
and cone photoreceptors each specialize in a unique function by the expression of distinct genes that perform analogous roles in each cell's light transduction pathway.
Bioinformatic motif identification techniques have been
used to successfully identify potential targets of 3 photoreceptor-specific transcription factors (NRL, CRX, NR2E3)
using their known binding specificity [1]. Experimental
evidence suggests that at least 9 additional transcription
factors are involved in regulation of either rod- or conespecific expression [2]. However, binding motifs for many
of these transcription factors are presently unknown. In
this study, we use de novo motif discovery methods to
identify motifs that may be important for gene expression
differences between rod and cone photoreceptors.
The most commonly used de novo method is phylogenetic
footprinting, based on the assumption that functional
sequence changes more slowly through evolution compared to the surrounding sequence. The advantage of phylogenetic footprinting is its specificity: significant
conservation across many species strongly suggests that a
sequence is functional. However, phylogenetic footprinting suffers from a high incidence of false negative errors
[3-6]. Alternative approaches seek to identify motifs that
are over-represented compared to a set of unrelated background sequences [7,8]. To increase the accuracy of predictions, recent over-representation motif discovery
implementations incorporate additional biological information [9-11], such as the position of motifs relative to
the transcription start site (for reviews see: [12,13]). Here,
we use a combination of over-representation, positionbased filtering, and phylogenetic analysis to select and
analyze motifs that may be involved in rod and cone-specific expression patterns.
Our motif discovery implementation, called iterative
alignment/modular motif selection (IAMMS), selects
motifs based on three biological assumptions. First, we
assume that promoters of functionally linked genes will
share similar regulatory motifs. The second assumption is
that functional motifs are concentrated near the transcrip-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/407

tion start site [14]. Third, we assume that occurrences of a
given motif cluster near a characteristic distance from the
transcription start site [14]. To implement the last two
assumptions, we applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm because the algorithm chooses the mode and variance of a distribution based on the underlying data. This
approach advances position-based filtering over previous
implementations that model motif position dependence
by a static distribution given by the empirical frequency of
all motifs relative to the transcription start site in bacteria
[12]. We implement this approach on a set of murine rodspecific, cone-specific, and background promoter
sequences derived from biochemical [15-21] and microarray [2,22] studies.
IAMMS identified 34 motifs enriched in the promoter of
either rod or cone photoreceptors, most of which are not
similar to any previously known motifs. To increase our
confidence in these predictions, results obtained using
IAMMS were compared to those of existing motif discovery algorithms, DME and BioProspector. We chose BioProspector because it improves on the well-studied Gibbs
sampling algorithm by representing background
sequences as a third-order Markov model [8,13]. DME
was chosen because it is based on the well-regarded maximum likelihood algorithm [7]. This comparison revealed
that over 60% of our predictions were also confirmed by
at least one additional algorithm. We provide extensive
discussion of these predictions in the context of the biochemical literature.

Results
Application of IAMMS to Rod and Cone-specific
Promoters
Input to IAMMS consisted of the upstream region of 11
rod-specific, 12 cone-specific, and 84 non-photoreceptor
genes (see table 1 for a list of rod/cone-specific genes, and
additional file 1 for background genes). The flowchart of
the IAMMS algorithm is shown in figure 1 (see methods
for details). The first step involved an iterative alignment
procedure conducted on all rod, cone, and non-photoreceptor promoters. This step resulted in a dataset of 71,195
conserved motifs between 8 and 150 bp in length. Each
entry of the dataset contains nucleotide sequences, the
location of motif occurrences with respect to the transcription start site, strand, and promoter from which each
occurrence originated. To illustrate the composition of the
dataset, we plotted motif length against the number of

occurrences of each motif in photoreceptor promoters
(figure 2; background occurrences are not shown). The
color map represents the number of motifs with each
length/frequency combination. As may be expected, motif
size has an inverse relationship with the number of occurrences.
Analysis showed that the majority of motifs identified
after the first step were repeat sequences. The motifs
occurring most frequently (> 25 occurrences) were primarily simple repeats. All longer motifs (> 19 bp) were highly
similar to microsatellites and interspersed repeats, as
revealed by comparison to a database of known repeats
(RepBase). Repeat sequences were filtered out at step 2.
After repeat filtering, the remaining motifs, those inside
and immediately above the marked box in figure 2, were
evaluated for potential enrichment in rod or cone photoreceptors (step 3). Since we are interested in motifs that
occur in the promoters of only one photoreceptor cell
type, motifs that have occurrences in both rod and cone
promoters were classified as ambiguous and were
excluded from consideration during this step. To evaluate
enrichment of a motif compared to background, we
assume a binomial distribution of kr rod specific (or kc
cone-specific) promoters drawn from the total number of
promoters that contain occurrences. A Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing (E-value) is applied to
the resulting p-value, as described in the Statistical annotation section of methods. The top scoring motifs identified
during this step were subjected to phylogenetic analysis
(step 6) and compared to known motifs using the Transcriptional Element Search System (TESS; step 7).
Figure 3 shows representative examples of top-scoring
cone- and rod-enriched motifs identified during step 3,
after being subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and compared to TESS. The cone-enriched motif is 13 bp in length,
contains 5 occurrences in cone-specific promoters and
none in rods (non-photoreceptor occurrences are not
shown). The cross species conservation scores (CSCS) for
each occurrence is shown in the last column. Four occurrences have a negative CSCS. A negative CSCS means that
the predicted occurrence is more conserved than surrounding sequences of the same length (see Methods for
details). Comparison with known photoreceptor-specific
motifs indicated that this sequence is similar to the preferred binding site for the Retnoid X Receptor (RXR).
Involvement of RXR in cone-specific expression is well
established [2], but binding sites for this transcription factor in cone photoreceptor promoters have not yet been
identified, making this prediction valuable for planning
experimental studies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/407

The rod-enriched motif (figure 3B) is 12 bp in length and
contains 6 occurrences in rod promoters. Cross-species
conservation shows that Pde6a, Gnb1, and Nr2e3 occurrences are phylogenetically conserved (a cross-species
alignment is not available for the region containing the
Pde6g occurrence, and thus no score is reported). According to TESS, this motif is similar to a c-Myb binding site.
The prediction that c-Myb may have a function unique to
one type of photoreceptor is consistent with publicly
available microarray data (see Methods). We found that cMyb is between 2.6 and 7.6 fold enriched in cones compared to rod photoreceptors.
After step 3, IAMMS identified a total of 6 motifs (3 rodand 3 cone-enriched) with E < 2.5. Since no position filtering was applied to identify these motifs, we refer to
them as position independent. All position independent
rod- and cone-enriched motifs, sorted based on E-value,
are shown on the top of figure 4. The highest scoring rod
prediction at the top of figure 4 contains two 5 bp invariant core regions separated by two ambiguous positions
(CCTTTNNGCCCT; rod-enriched position independent,
row 1). The position variance of this prediction is remarkably small (Â± 45) considering that no position-based
selection was applied to identify this sequence. The top
scoring cone motif contains a core region 5 bp in width
(aGGGTTca). It occurs in 8/12 cone promoter sequences
with no discernable bias in position. Detailed information on the position and phylogenetic conservation of
each occurrence is available as additional data (files 1, 2)
online.
Those motifs classified as ambiguous during step 3 were
subjected to position-based clustering (step 4). As
described previously, we acted under the hypothesis that
occurrences of a motif near the transcription start site, and
those occurring in clusters around a preferred position,
are more likely to be functional. One example of clusters
selected by the hierarchical clustering algorithm is shown
in figure 5A. This particular motif contains 55 occurrences, plotted as triangles based on their 1-dimensional
position relative to the transcription start site. These
occurrences are broken into clusters by the algorithm,
denoted by blue ovals. A cone-enriched cluster just
upstream of the transcription start site is shown in pink.
This cluster contains 5/12 occurrences from cone-specific
promoters, and only 4/84 occurrences in non-photoreceptor promoter regions.
After motifs were broken into position-dependant clusters, we used the same statistical procedure described
above to select those clusters enriched in rod or cone promoters (IAMMS, step 5). Figure 5BâC plots the ratio
between cell-specific and total occurrences (vertical axis)
against the total number of promoters with at least one

occurrence (horizontal axis). Points are colored based on
the number of motifs with a given combination, in a similar manner to figure 2. The cone-enriched cluster
cAGAAG shown in figure 5A is one of the motifs represented by the point marked in figure 5C. This point lies
just inside the gray region representing a statistical threshold of p = 0.005 that was used to classify motifs as
enriched in rod (or cone) specific promoter sequences. A
motif corresponding to the known cone-specific cis-element ROP2 is also represented by a point in the gray
region of figure 5C. Figure 5B shows the same representation as figure 5C for rod-specific motifs. A previously characterized rod-specific motif, NRE, is represented by a
point that lies just inside the gray region (marked in figure
5A), indicating the biological relevance of motifs represented in this region.
A detailed view of the NRE-like motif identified after step
5 is shown in the left panel of figure 6. The predicted motif
contains a core region (aTGCTGa). The occurrence in the
Rho promoter at -88 bp (occurrences are enumerated
below the logo in figure 6) has already been validated
experimentally [23]. Two sample cross-species phyloge-

netic alignments are shown below the functional alignment in figure 6 (Pde6b and Rho). In this case, these
occurrences are very highly conserved relative to the surrounding sequence.
Another known transcription factor binding site detected
in this study corresponds to the recently discovered conespecific sequence ROP2, shown in the right panel of figure
6. This prediction contains an occurrence in the Opn1mw
promoter that was recently discovered to be required for
cone-specific expression [24]. Previously unknown occurrences of ROP2 were predicted in the promoter of
Opn1sw,Smug1, and Cnga3. The newly-discovered occurrence in the Opn1sw promoter shows remarkable position-conservation relative to the transcription start site
when compared with the known Opn1mw occurrence: -94
and -97 bp, respectively, a difference of only 3 bp. Selected
phylogenetic alignments (figure 6, right panel, bottom)
show that the occurrences in the Cnga3 and Opn1mw promoters are highly conserved through evolution. In addition to increasing confidence in predictions, the ROP2
detection also provides exciting new targets for a cis-element that is pertinent for cone-specificity.

The 12 highest scoring (E-value) rod- and cone-enriched
position dependent predictions are shown on the bottom
of figure 4. The example given in figure 5A (cAGAAG) can
be found among cone-enriched motifs in row 7. Among
the high scoring motifs, 6 rod and 3 cone predictions are
similar to known motifs whose specific binding positions
(with the exception of NRE) are not known, including
four putative initiator (INR-like) elements, NRE, an IL-6
effector, an RXR binding site, ROP2, a putative TATA-like
motif, and an Engrailed homeodomain binding site.
Phylgoenetic conservation is relatively high for several of
the elements, including two conservation scores less than
-1 for cone-enriched predictions (TATA-like: -1.08 and
En2: -1.35). As we show in the next section, many of these
motifs are corroborated by motifs predicted by DME and/
or BioProspector.

is likely to contain functional motifs. The circle shows the
region containing the motif sample in Fig. 3A. Longer motifs
(> 20 bp) are longer simple or interspersed repeats.

Comparison with DME and BioProspector
To increase confidence in our predictions, we compared
motifs discovered using IAMMS to those discovered using
existing de novo motif discovery algorithms, DME and BioProspector. For both of these algorithms, a smaller section
of the upstream region was employed (500 bp of
upstream sequence and 100 bp of UTR) for a more similar
comparison to IAMMS position clustering implementation. In order to return useful results, promoter regions
needed to be repeat masked prior to analysis. Since the
rod- and cone-specific sets are too small to be compared
directly against each other, cone promoters were compared against the combined set of background and rod
promoters to evaluate cone-enrichment. The same
approach was used to identify rod-enriched predictions.

The top 10 motifs for each motif length between 6 and 10
bp (DME) or 6 and 12 bp (BioProspector) were compared

tor in cone sequences. Compared to BioProspector, the
rate of agreement between IAMMS and DME in rods and
cones is similar (47% in cones, 57% in rods). We conclude that although they use different underlying algorithms, results obtained using DME are more similar to
IAMMS compared with BioProspector.
Overall, of 40 rod- and cone-specific predictions, 25 (over
60%) are confirmed by either DME or BioProspector and
11 (nearly 30%) were confirmed by both. Major predictions, including the ROP2 binding site, Initiator, TATAlike, and IL-6 (discussed in detail below) were corroborated by at least one motif discovery algorithm. The initiator-like and TATA-like predictions were identified by all
3 algorithms, increasing our confidence in these predictions.

Discussion
In this article, we use a combination of motif discovery
algorithms to identify putative cis-elements that may be
responsible for differences in gene expression between
rod and cone photoreceptors. We identified 34 conserved
motifs highly enriched in either rod or cone photoreceptor genes. Our predictions can be divided into three distinct groups:
1. Completely new motifs that bare no resemblance to
known transcription factor binding sites. This first group
contains 20 motifs, most of which are confirmed by at
least two discovery algorithms, or have a high degree of
phylogenetic conservation.

Predicted rod (left) and cone (right) enriched motifs. Notations are the same as figure 3. Cross-species alignments for Pde6b,
Rho (left), Cnga3, and Opn1mw (right) occurrences are shown on the bottom. All occurrences are highly conserved across species (CSCS -1.66, -1.87, -0.93, and -1.79). The rod-specific prediction is similar to the known rod-motif NRE. The cone-specific
motif contains a previously known binding site (ROP2) for which it predicts additional occurrences. Non-photoreceptor occurrences have been removed for simplicity (See additional files 1 and 2).

2. Motifs similar to cis-elements with known photoreceptor function. This second group contains 5 motifs, including motifs that have been characterized by previous
experimental studies (NRE, ROP2) as well as motifs
whose putative binding sites are unknown (RXR, En2, and
IL-6 effectors). It is notable that all these motifs were
derived without using any specific a priori knowledge.
3. Motifs similar to known cis-elements whose involvement in photoreceptor function has not yet been established. This final group includes the TATA-like and
Initiator-like sequences enriched in cone and rod promoters, respectively (see below for more details).
RXR and En2 binding motifs in promoters of cone-specific
genes
Previous microarray studies suggest that at least 4 transcription factors (RXRÎ³, En2, Sall3, and Prdm1) are more
active in cone photoreceptors than rods [2]. The role of
RXR is supported by additional biochemical studies

which demonstrate that RXRÎ³ plays a vital role in patterning cone photoreceptors in response to signaling by thyroid hormone receptor Î²2 [25,26]. The RXR prediction is
shown in figure 4, position independent, row 3. Functional RXR cis-elements often contain a degenerate repeat
of the invariant core in close proximity [27]. Therefore, we
examined the promoter sequences surrounding predicted
RXR sites for degenerate variations of the putative core
selected by IAMMS. Out of 5 sites, 4 contain an additional
occurrence of G(N [0â2])TCA within 4 bp of the recognized site (see the image in additional file 3 online). This
is very unlikely to occur by chance (p~3.7 Ã 10-4), further
increasing our confidence that the predicted motif binds
RXR-family transcription factors.
The En2-like motif is shown in figure 4 cone-enriched
position dependent row 9. The prediction includes the
central portion of the optimal En2 homeodomain transcription factor consensus (TAATTA) detected by in vitro
selection experiments [28,29]. While a corresponding

motif was detected only by IAMMS (figure 7, last coneenriched row), occurrences of the Engrailed-like prediction are highly conserved through evolution (-1.35) suggesting that the motif is functional. A similar prediction
(cone position dependent, row 10) contains many of the
same occurrences, but shifts the core by ~2 bp and adds an
additional A to the 3' end. Like the first prediction, it is
also highly conserved through evolution, centered in the
same region, and cone-specific. Moreover, this second
prediction was also detected by DME (figure 7, coneenriched, 3rd row from bottom). If validated experimentally, occurrences of this AATT motif will be the first
reported promoter binding sites for En2.
We were unable to find binding sites for Sall3 or Prdm1 in
the experimental literature. Some of the unidentified
motifs predicted in this study (group 1) may correspond
to binding sties for these transcription factors. Future
experimental studies will be required to discover any correspondence between these transcription factors and
motifs predicted in this study.
IL-6 Binding Motif in Promoters of Rod-Specific Genes
One of the rod-specific predictions, detected by both
IAMMS and BioProspector, is similar to an IL-6 effector
(figure 7, row marked IL-6). This is interesting in the context of recent findings that in rodents, signaling by IL-6
family members CNTF and LIF can block the formation of
rod photoeceptors during development [30,31]. According to the literature, peak IL-6 effector activity is obtained
by the invariant core (CTGGGAA) and another degenerate
occurrence (CTGGAA) appearing nearby [32]. Our prediction corresponds to the first invariant core (CTGGGA). To
determine if a degenerate occurrence appeared nearby, we
took rod-enriched IL-6-like predictions andsearched
nearby promoter sequence to find if any elements similar
to the core were present. We found that 4 rod-specific promoter sequences, including Pde6b, Gnat1, Pde6d, and Rho
contain an exact copy of either the degenerate sequence or
the high-affinity core binding sequence within 50 bp of a
predicted occurrence (see the image in additional file 4, as
well as additional files 1 and 2 for more IL-6 like predictions). It is interesting that in chick, where artificial IL-6
stimulation increases the number of rod photoreceptors
[33], only one orthologous promoter (of all those in table
1) contains both the invariant core and a degenerate consensus within 50 bp of one another. The correspondence
between empirical evidence and occurrences of IL-6-like
motifs lends support for the biological relevance of the IL6 prediction.

The high-affinity core and a degenerate occurrence missing only the final A (i.e. CTGGA, also within 50 bp) was
found in the Nrl promoter. This predicted site is likely to
be significant considering the important role Nrl plays in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/407

rod photoreceptor differentiation [2]. This observation
suggests that one possible mechanism for IL-6 regulation
of rod-differentiation involves suppression of the Nrl gene
product.
Differences in the Core Promoter of Rod and ConeSpecific Genes
One of the most striking findings of this study is differences in the core promoter region of rod-and cone-specific
genes. We predicted several rod-enriched motifs centered
on the transcription start site that are similar to characterized initiator consensus sequences, but no enrichment of
degenerate initiator-like sequences were found specific to
cones. Conversely, a TATA-like motif was detected in
almost all cone promoters near the appropriate position
upstream of the transcription start site, whereas it was
absent from rod promoters.

Figure 4 depicts 4 unique, rod-enriched motifs whose
mean position lies near the transcription start with relatively low position variance. Three of these motifs are similar to portions of experimentally-validated initiators
(INR-like), including the motifs in row 4 (aGGTCC) [34],
row 6 (TCTGAG) [35], and row 11 (GCACAG) [36]. The
fourth motif (ACAGTGa), in row 2, is also attributed to
the initiator-like group because its antisense mismatches
the accepted initiator consensus (YYANWYY) at only one
position. More details of the TCTGAG motif are shown in
the left panel of figure 8. We detected occurrences of this
motif near the transcription start site in 5 rod promoters.
The Pde6a, Cnga1, and Sag occurrences are on the -1
strand, and are consequently highly similar to the pyridine rich initiator consensus (YYANWYY). The proximity of
the 4 motifs to the annotated transcription start site, their
phylogenetic conservation, as well as similarity to portions of experimentally characterized initiators suggests
that these motifs may function as degenerate initiator
sequences in rod-specific promoters.
In cone promoters we found a different core promoter element, ATAA, a motif similar to the central portion of a
TATA box (see Figure 4 and Figure 7). One such prediction
is depicted in the right panel of figure 8. Occurrences of
this particular motif are found in 4 cone promoters,
Arr3,Gnat2,Gnb3, and Pde6c (figure 8, right panel). These
occurrences are located between 20 and 45 bp upstream
of the transcription start site, close to the typical position
of a TATA-box [37], supporting the idea that it is, indeed,
a degenerate variation on the TATA consensus. A high
degree of phylogenetic conservation of this motif and corroboration by both DME and BioProspector further support the biological relevance of this prediction.
Many of the ATAA occurrences contain an additional T on
the beginning of the motif, making them even closer to

the classic TATA-consensus. We conducted a search for
TATA-like sequences in the core promoter of rod and cone
genes. It is interesting that the sequence TATAA (or its
antisense) appears in 7 cone promoters (Opn1mw,
Opn1sw, Cngb3, Arr3, Pde6c, Smug1, and Cnga3) between 180 to +60 relative to the transcription start site. Conversely, this sequence is only found in two (Rho and
Cnga1) out of 11 rod promoters. The enrichment of the
TATAA sequence in cones, although not as pronounced as
ATAA, lends further support to the idea that the cone promoters studied here are initiated by a TATA box. It is notable that except for Elovl2 and Pde6h, an occurrence of
either sATAAgw or TATAA is present near the transcription
start site in all cone-specific promoters.
Experimental evidence supports the biological relevance
of the ATAA prediction, regardless of whether it is, indeed,
a degenerate TATA-box. A recent experimental study
deleted two occurrences of TATA-like motifs from the Arr3
promoter [38] and observed that the previously cone-specific promoter drove transgene expression in rods as well.
In light of our predictions, we suggest that a TATA or

TATA-like motif in the core promoter plays a central role
in the differences between rod and cone expression patterns.
Limitations
The fact that the number of genes specifically expressed in
either rod or cone photoreceptors is rather small makes
the application of de novo motif discovery approaches that
heavily rely on statistical analysis difficult. Because of this
consideration, we took two independent approaches
designed to increase the accuracy of our results. First, we
employed a large number of non-photoreceptor genes as
a negative control, and evaluated enrichment of motifs in
either rod or cone promoters relative to this large dataset.
Second, we applied 3 motif discovery software packages
that use different algorithms to identify motifs. While we
do not filter motifs that are identified by only one algorithm from our final database, we do provide a table of
overlaps (figure 7) as additional information that can be
used to evaluate predictions. Together, these two
approaches should minimize both false positive and false
negative errors.

In the present study, we selected promoters based on
ENSEMBL annotated transcription start sites. However,
recent reports suggest that two separate ambiguities exist
in transcription start site annotations. One, the so-called
"borad" class of transcription start sites, represents inherent local variation over 50â100 bp [37,39]. This complication should not have a major impact on the quality of
our predictions. Since hierarchical clustering automatically chooses the mode and variance of a motifs' position
distribution relative to the transcription start site separately for each motif, IAMMS should turn up the same predictions with some additional position variance.

function. Our most important predictions include specific
sites for RXR and Engrailed family members (enriched in
cone promoters) and IL-6 effectors (enriched in rod promoters). We predict differences in the core promoter
between rod and cone phototransduction genes. While
rod promoters are enriched in putative initiator-like
motifs and are TATA-less, cone promoters are enriched in
TATA-like motifs. To simplify access to our findings, we
provide an on-line database containing detailed information about the exact position of the motifs with the respect
to the transcription start and their phylogenetic conservation (additional files 1, 2).

A second ambiguity is the recent observation that a majority of genes are driven by two or more alternative promoter sequences [37,39]. To determine the relevance of
this finding for our study, we searched the database of
transcription start sites (DBTSS) for genes used in this
study, and found only 3 genes (Nr2e3, Gngt2, and Pde6h)
that contain potential alternate transcription start sites far
from the ENSEMBL annotation, and 4 additional genes
(Pde6d, Pde6b, Gnb3, and Elovl2) that contain alternate
transcription start sites within 200 bp [40]. However, in
all of these cases the alternate transcripts were identified
in non-retinal tissue, and therefore the alternate start sites
do not pertain to our present application. In addition, 8/
23 promoters that we selected for analysis are validated
experimentally (Arr3 [38,41], Pde6c[42], Opn1mw
[24,43], Pde6a[44], Gnat2[45], Sag [46,47], Rho[23], and
Nrl[48]). Those considerations expressed above give us
confidence in the promoter regions selected for this study.

Methods

This study did not detect motifs corresponding to two
transcription factors known to be enriched in rod-photoreceptors compared to cones, including Mef2c [22] and
NR2E3 [49]. One of the causes of this omission could
potentially be the multiple severe constraints in our selection criteria that were introduced to maximally reduce the
rate of false positive predictions. In the case of NR2E3,
another potential reason may be that NR2E3 may not
bind DNA directly in vivo. Rather, recent findings suggest
that NR2E3 regulates expression indirectly by interactions
with CRX [50]. If there is no NR2E3 binding directly to
DNA, it is not surprising that we do not identify a motif
for this transcription factor.

Conclusion
Using a panel of three motif discovery algorithms
(IAMMS, DME, and BioProspector), we predict 34 putative cis-elements that may be vital for maintaining either
rod or cone gene expression patterns. Our predictions
include many previously unknown motifs, known cis-elements involved in maintaining the differences between
rod and cone expression patterns, as well as binding sites
for transcription factors with no known photoreceptor

Building photoreceptor-specific list
Genes in the photoreceptor-specific list (table 1) were
selected as follows. Cone genes (except Cnga3) were
selected using microarray data from NRL or NR2E3-knockout mouse retina that are known to produce a rod-deficient
phenotype [2,15]. We included Cnga3 which was found to
be cone-specific by experimental studies [21]. Rod genes
Sag [17], Pde6d [20], Nrl [18], Nr2e3 [19], and Gnb1 [15]
were previously observed to be expressed in rod but not
cone photoreceptors by biochemical studies [16-21]. The
remaining rod genes (Rho, Pde6a, Pde6g, Pde6b, Gnat1, and
Cnga1) were selected based on microarray data comparing
FACS sorted rods to a model of cone-photoreceptors [22].
The latter involves FACS sorting cells expressing GFP by the
NRL promoter in NRL knockout mice, and is demonstrated
to be a good model for cone photoreceptors [51]. To pick
the rod genes we obtained, raw CEL files for 4 normal and
4 NRL knockout animals were obtained using the Gene
Expression Omnibus website. The data were MAS5 normalized and averaged using the bioconductor package [52]. We
selected genes involved in the phototransduction pathway
that were significantly down-regulated in the Nrl knockout
samples (p < 0.02; Student's t-test).

For each gene in table 1, 2 kb of sequence upstream of the
annotated transcription start site and the entire 5' UTR of
the mouse was obtained from ENSEMBL (Mouse v.36, Aug.
2005). Two genes (Nrl and Gngt2) contained two annotated transcription start sites within 1000 bp of each other,
and each promoter contained a UTR. In both cases, the promoter closer to the translation start site was chosen. This
choice effectively included the region immediately
upstream of each transcription start site; for Nrl, this choice
corresponded to an experimental study [48].
Selecting background promoter set
We constructed a background sequence set from genes that
are not expressed in either rods or cones, but are expressed
in most tissues, in a tissue independent manner. To construct this background set, we first identified all genes that
are not expressed in adult rod or cone photoreceptors. To

Page 12 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:407

do this, we used the MAS5 normalized FACS sorted microarray data obtained in the previous section. From this data,
we obtained a list of REFSEQ IDs where all probes associated with each REFSEQ ID was marked absent by the
Affymetrix perfect match/mismatch designation.
To evaluate tissue specificity, microarray data from the
mouse gene-atlas [53] was obtained from NCBI's Gene
Expression Omnibus (GSE1133) using R's Bioconductor
plugin [52] and GEOquery [54] packages. Average expression of each gene in each tissue was calculated, and probe
sets were converted to REFSEQ IDs. Next, we calculated the
ratio of maximum expression to the sum of expression in
all tissues. This tissue-specificity ratio ranged between 0.02
(nearly equal expression between all tissues) and 0.98
(highly specific to one tissue). For the background set, we
selected all REFSEQ IDs for genes with a ratio less than 0.03
that are also absent from both adult rod and cone photoreceptors (n= 84). For all of these genes, 2 kb of upstream
sequence and the entire 5' UTR was obtained using
ENSEMBL's BioMart.
IAMMS procedure
The flowchart of IAMMS is depicted in figure 1. The input
for the algorithm consists of 3 sets of promoter sequences,
including 11 rod-specific sequences, 12 cone-specific
sequences, and an additional set of background sequences
that do not drive expression in photoreceptors. All promoters were passed through an iterative alignment procedure
(step 1) that returns a motif for each sequence â¥ 8 bp in
length that appears more than once in photoreceptor promoters. The resulting database of potential motifs was
scanned for sequences similar to a known simple or interspersed repeat sequence (step 2). Motifs were evaluated for
cell-specificity using a binomial model of enrichment (statistical annotation, step 3) to create predictions for cell-specific motifs. Ambiguous motifs were filtered to extract sets
of position-enriched occurrences using an agglomerative
clustering procedure (step 4). Position-enriched clusters
were subsequently analyzed using statistical annotation
(step 5) to create a set of position-specific predictions. Both
position-enriched and non-enriched predictions were subsequently analyzed by phylogenetic analysis (step 6) and
were compared to known cis-elements (step 7).
Step 1: Iterative alignment
All sequences â¥ 8 bp in length that appear more than once
in rod and cone photoreceptor promoters were identified
using the BLAST implementation distributed by Washington University [55]. We used scoring parameters that were
observed to return short, nearly exact matches: +2 for a
match, -3 for a mismatch, and a threshold bit score of 16.
Gaps were allowed, but using the default score of -20 gaps
rarely appeared (impossible in any sequence pair less than
28 bp match of flanking surrounding a gap). After comple-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/407

tion, we separated pairwise alignments into a database of
individual sequences. We filtered this database, so that each
sequence occurs exactly once. This database contains each
sequence â¥ 8 bp in length that occurs at least twice in the
photoreceptor promoter set. Next, we constructed a multiple alignment for each sequence returned in the pairwise
alignment. In the second iteration, we scanned all promoter sequences (rod, cone, and 84 background promoters) using each sequence identified in the previous
database. BLAST was run using the same match and mismatch parameters as the first iteration, but the threshold bit
score was changed for each sequence. To calculate the
threshold bit score, we multiplied the sequence length by
1.4 (we also tried a variety of constants between 1.3 and
1.7). The output of this step is a series of multiple alignments â one alignment for each sequence occurring twice
in photoreceptor promoters.
Step 2: Masking Longer Sequences to RepBase
Longer sequences were evaluated to examine potential similarities to known repeats. BLAST was used to compare each
sequence â¥ 20 bp in length to all mouse repeats represented
in RepBase [56] v.11.07. A scoring scheme of +2 (match), 3 (mismatch), and 20 (threshold) was used.
Step 3: Statistical Annotation & Bonferroni Correction
Let kr and kc be the number of rod- and cone-specific promoters that contain at least one occurrence in a motif with
n occurrences. We take the p-value of cell-specific enrichment to be the binomial probability of selecting a list that
contains n sequences, of which kr or kc are mapped to rodor cone-specific promoters. The probability of selecting one
rod/cone-specific promoter is the number of rod or cone
promoters divided by the total number of promoters (11/
107 = 0.103 for rods).

Due to overlap between different motif core regions, we
observed underdispersion relative to the binomial model
described above. We corrected the p-value by Z-score normalizing across all groups with a given number of occurrences using an empirically derived mean and standard
deviation. To perform the Bonferroni correction, we multiplied the corrected p-value by the total number of
sequences considered for cell-specific expression, not
counting motifs with less than 4 occurrences in photoreceptor promoters or similar to repeat sequences longer than
20 bp (38,779). For the sake of simplicity our calculations
do not take into account dependence between motifs with
highly similar core regions, and are therefore highly conservative. This Bonferroni corrected expected false positive
rate is referred to as the E-value. We select all motifs with an
enrichment E-value less than 2.5 in one photoreceptor cell
type, and also require that no occurrences are found in the
alternate photoreceptor cell type.

Step 4: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Single link hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed on the distance to the transcription start site for
each motif. Motifs are broken into the minimum number
of clusters when the mean inter-cluster variance reaches 1%
of the total variance. To ensure that the data contains an
underlying structure that can be described by clusters, only
motifs with an agglomerative coefficient greater than or
equal to 0.7 were analyzed using agglomerative clustering.
All computations were performed using the R-cluster package [57] (v.2.3.0). Samples of clusters selected by this procedure are shown in figure 5A. In addition to single link,
Euclidean and Ward's algorithms in the R-cluster package
were tested, though all results are reported on single-link
results.
Steps 5: Statistical Annotation
Each position enriched cluster with occurrences in the first
400 bp upstream of the transcription start site was analyzed
for rod/cone specificity using the statistical annotation procedure described in step 3.
Step 6: Phylogenetic Analysis
To compare the conservation of a putative mouse cis-element to other predictions, we applied a recently described
model [58] involving a comparison between the actual
number of substitutions in the predicted cis-element to the
expected rate of conservation between all species in the
alignment. First, alignments corresponding to promoters of
interest were extracted from existing whole-genome alignments using the UCSC genome browser [59] (mm8 version). Raw alignments corresponding to each mouse
promoter were obtained as different regions known as
alignment blocks. We defined the cross-species conservation score (CSCS) as the Z-score of the calculated substitutions in our sequence of interest, relative to all surrounding
windows (the same size as our comparison sequence) in
the same local alignment block. To calculate the mean and
standard deviation, we used a sliding window (the same
size as the prediction) locally, in the alignment block. Negative results mean less than the average number of mutations are found in the window (i.e. the sequence is
conserved); positive values mean that there are more differences. Sequences corresponding to gaps where no alignment is available between the mouse sequence and other
species were not included in the analysis. References to
these scores were left blank in the figures and additional
data files.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/407

option. Log-likelihood score filtering was used for both
string and weight matrix functions. The minimum log-likelihood ratio was set to 12 for string scoring and 10 for
weight matrix scoring. Matches were visually inspected, and
deemed to be similar only if nearly identical in the invariant core region. TESS missed several regulatory sequences
available in the experimental literature, many of which
have special relevance to a photoreceptor system. These
similarities were annotated by hand and are included in figures 4 and 7.
Comparison between predictions
Predictions highly similar in the core region, but differing
in ambiguous peripheral positions, (for example, see figure
7, rows 8â10 and row 7 antisense) were grouped prior to
the creation of figure 4 and counting predictions for the
text. Sequences were grouped according to the methods
described in [14]. A single vector was created by concatenating column vectors from the position-weight-matrix representation of a motif. The maximum Pearson coefficient
over each possible alignment between two separate motifs
(including sense-antisense) was subsequently calculated.
When comparing motifs with a different length, the smaller
motif was compared against the larger to emphasize similarities in the invariant core region. During this step, overhangs were filled in with P(A) = P(T) = P(C) = P(G) = 0.25.
Motifs were considered highly-similar if the Pearson coefficient was greater than 0.85.
DME/BioProsprector procedure
The same promoters used for IAMMS were repeat masked
[61] using the following settings: wublast algorithm, DNA
source set to mouse, and default sensitivity. After masking,
sequences were chopped to include only 500 bp of
upstream sequence and 100 bp of UTR, when available.
Each software program was run with default settings, except
that the number of motifs to return was set to 10, and the
motif size was varied between 6 and 10 (for DME), or 6 and
12 (for BioProspector). When identifying cone-specific
motifs, cone promoters were compared against the combined set of rod-specific and background promoters (and
vice-versa). Results for each run were added into the same
table and sorted by the score given by each program. Output motifs were compared to predictions made by IAMMS
using the method described in [14], and repeated above
(see Comparison between predictions in Methods section).
