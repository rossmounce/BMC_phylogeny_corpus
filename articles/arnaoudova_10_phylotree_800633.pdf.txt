Background
We have developed software called Phylotree as a toolkit
for running experiments to study gene cophylogenies
for genome evolution using distance-based methods. In
particular, the toolkit has been instrumental in conducting processing-heavy experiments with the new “difference of means” statistical method. Phylotree was used to
run experiments using simulated data as well as biological sequences of well known host and parasite species,
and is distributed with data and configuration files
allowing these experiments to be reproduced.
Materials and methods
Phylotree is organized as a collection of scripts. A single
run takes as inputs two input alignments in Nexus format, and consists of a number of bootstrap iterations,
comprising the following steps: 1) produce modified
sequence alignments by bootstrapping the original alignments; 2) sample trees from the posterior distributions
for each of the original and modified alignments using
MCMC-based software (MrBayes or BEAST); 3) compute distances among the tree distributions, for example
as an average of the pairwise distances between trees in
the samples; and 4) check similarity criteria based on
these distances. A full experiment consists of one or
more runs with different parameters, tree distance
methods, and input alignments.
Results and conclusion
Phylotree supports a number of distance methods for
phylogeny trees, including path-difference, matrix tree
distance, Robinson-Foulds distance and tree space

geodesic distance. Additional distance methods may be
used by supplying programs that take as input Newickformat tree files, and output distances in a simple textbased format. Phylotree can be run in two different
modes: interactive (the user is prompted for experiment-specific parameters: number of bootstrap iterations, link files to be used, configuration files for the
MCMC software, etc.), and command-line (parameters
are specified on the command line or in a configuration
file). Whichever mode is used, a configuration file is
generated that allows the experiment to be easily
reproduced.
The Phylotree package is open-source, and is distributed together with source code for the included third
party software. It includes tools, documentation, and
guidelines for easy installation and building of the
executables on different platforms. The software is available from http://csurs.csr.uky.edu/phylotree/ .
