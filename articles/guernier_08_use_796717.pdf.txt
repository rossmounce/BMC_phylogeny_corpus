Abstract
Background: French Guiana has the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden among all French departments, with a
strong increase in the TB incidence over the last few years. It is now uncertain how best to explain this incidence.
The objective of this study was to compare three different methods evaluating the extent of recent TB
transmission in French Guiana.
Methods: We conducted a population-based molecular epidemiology study of tuberculosis in French Guiana
based on culture-positive TB strains (1996 to 2003, n = 344) to define molecular relatedness between isolates,
i.e. potential transmission events. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by comparing two methods: a "clustergraph" method based on spoligotyping results, and a minimum spanning tree method based on both spoligotyping
and variable number of tandem DNA repeats (VNTR). Furthermore, three indices attempting to reflect the
extent of recent TB transmission (RTIn, RTIn-1 and TMI) were compared.
Results: Molecular analyses showed a total amount of 120 different spoligotyping patterns and 273 clinical
isolates (79.4%) that were grouped in 49 clusters. The comparison of spoligotypes from French Guiana with an
international spoligotype database (SpolDB4) showed that the majority of isolates belonged to major clades of M.
tuberculosis (Haarlem, 22.6%; Latin American-Mediterranean, 23.3%; and T, 32.6%). Indices designed to quantify
transmission of tuberculosis gave the following values: RTIn = 0.794, RTIn-1 = 0.651, and TMI = 0.146.
Conclusion: Our data showed a high number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clusters, suggesting a high level of
recent TB transmission, nonetheless an estimation of transmission rate taking into account cluster size and
mutation rate of genetic markers showed a low ongoing transmission rate (14.6%). Our results indicate an
endemic mode of TB transmission in French Guiana, with both resurgence of old spatially restricted genotypes,
and a significant importation of new TB genotypes by migration of TB infected persons from neighgouring highincidence countries.

Background
The resurgence of human tuberculosis (TB) in many
industrialized countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s
[1] has focused critical attention on a disease that was
thought to be under control, and as such, has been
neglected for too long. Effective prevention and control of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, must
be based on a clear understanding of how the disease is
transmitted, how infection becomes established, and how
infection progresses to clinical disease. This has motivated
investigations on TB transmission among persons at
higher risk, such as the homeless [2,3] or HIV-infected
persons [4,5]. Furthermore, the improvement of molecular techniques to characterize Mycobacterium strains, especially M. tuberculosis, and the concomitant accumulation
of epidemiological data over large spatial scales has
increased the possibility to trace transmission routes of
Mycobacterium outbreaks (e.g. M. leprae in [6]). The identification of M. tuberculosis strains can be used to identify
patients which have some apparently identical genotypes,
thus potentially associated to a same source of contamination [7] and designated as «clustered cases» [8,9]. The
existence of genetic clusters is thought to be indicative of
recent TB transmission [10,11], in opposition to cases
arising either from imports or from reactivation of latent
infection. Featuring epidemiological links between
patients allow inferences about the level of ongoing TB
transmission, thus the level of epidemicity/endemicity of
the infection in a defined geographical area, and underline some potential risk factors associated to the disease
[12]. For example, when an unusual number of TB cases
occurs over time, it is possible to do early molecular analyses to determine whether this cluster of cases represents
temporal coincidence, or a genetic cluster due to a local
chain of transmission. If fingerprinting demonstrates different strains, the cases are not due to transmission, and
there is no need for further epidemiological evaluation.
The underlined hypothesis of the use of molecular information for the evaluation of ongoing transmission is that
mutations are slower than transmission rate [13], which is
not true for all genetic markers. A large number of molecular methods are available for the characterization of
infra-specific M. tuberculosis strains. Nonetheless the
choice of a method strongly affects the results, as low
mutation rates tend to less discriminate the genetic differences, whereas high mutation rates tend to increase the
number of clusters considered [14]. This article investigates the genotypic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains isolated in French Guiana over the 1996–2003 period,
characterized by two molecular methods, and attempts to
determine potential transmission between infected persons. We used a recent method proposed by Tanaka &
Francis [14] to visualise molecular epidemiological data,
i.e. cluster-graphs, which also provides a framework for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/46

evaluating ongoing transmission. We also compared the
method used to previous indices attempting to reflect the
extent of recent TB transmission.

Methods
Clinical isolates
French Guiana is a French overseas department of 32,432
sq mi. It is located on the north-east of South America,
between Suriname and Brazil. The region has the highest
TB rates among all French departments, with an average
annual incidence of 63.1 TB cases per 100,000 population
estimated during the period 1996–2003 [15]. Among all
TB cases identified from January 1, 1996 to December 31,
2003, 345 were confirmed by isolation and cell culture of
M. tuberculosis by the Mycobacterium Laboratory of the
Institut Pasteur de la Guyane (IPG). A total of 344 clinical
isolates of M. tuberculosis were isolated from patients with
culture-positive TB, representing 342 patients (two
patients only were contaminated twice, by two different
strains). The three missing cases (0,86%) correspond to
contaminated cultures. After a prior explanation of the
recommended investigations for the diagnostic purposes
by a physician, patients were asked to provide oral consent and the pathological specimens were obtained from
suspected tuberculosis patients residing in French Guiana.
The cultures were performed using Löwenstein-Jensen
slants at 37°C at the Pasteur Institute of French Guiana.
Positive cultures (where no identification was attached)
were sent to the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe which
has been serving as a regional reference laboratory for
tuberculosis and mycobacterial for the Caribbean since
1994. The cultures were duly identified as M. tuberculosis
complex using classical biochemical tests and the AccuProbe test (GenProbe Inc., San Diego, CA) and subjected
to drug-susceptibility testing using the proportional
method. The bacteriological results were communicated
to the physicians and/or hospital services responsible for
patient care and treatment, through the Pasteur Institute
of French Guiana. DNA-based molecular typing was also
performed (see below).
Molecular typing
Molecular typing was performed using spoligotyping and
VNTRs analyses. It was previously suggested that a combined spoligotyping-5 VNTR loci genotyping scheme may
have a discriminatory power close to that of IS6110 RFLP,
the historical "golden standard" in tuberculosis genotyping [16]. Hence, for ease and resources reasons, we
choosed this scheme, which was less expensive in time
and money than the combined spoligotyping-12 VNTR
loci scheme, i.e. MIRUs [17]. Recent improvement in
VNTR typing now recommended a new "universal" 15 or
even 24 VNTR loci genotyping scheme for M. tuberculosis
[18].

The bacterial DNA was prepared by the classical cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide method (CTAB) [19] and
used for spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing)
and Variable Number of DNA Tandem Repeats (VNTRs)
analyses. Spoligotyping was performed using a homemade membrane with 43 covalently bound oligonucleotides and PCR was achieved using primers designated
DRa and DRb, with DRa biotinylated 5' to amplify the
whole DR region as described previously [20]. As spoligotyping used alone is known to overestimate the number of
epidemiological links (depending on the settings, but by
around 30%), it was suggested to be used in association
with another rapid fingerprinting technique [21]. Hence,
the isolates clustered by spoligotyping (and only those
first-clustered isolates) were further subtyped using
VNTRs as described previously [22] in order to provide a
second independent indicator of clonality. The number of
copies for each exact tandem repeat (ETR) was documented as a five-digit numbers representing allele profiles
ETR-A to ETR-E [23].
Strains matching
Spoligotype patterns are designated as 43-character-long
strings consisting of black and white squares, indicating
respectively the presence or the absence of an individual
spacer. The totality of the 344 isolates was entered in this
binary format as Excel (Microsoft, Cupertino, CA) spreadsheets. The spoligotype designations (shared types or ST,
defined as an identical spoligotype found in ≥ 2 individual patient isolates) were attributed by comparing the patterns obtained with those included in an international
spoligotyping database held at the Pasteur Institute of
Guadeloupe, designated as spolDB4 [24]. At the time of
the matching analysis, the updated spolDB4 version contained 31,642 patterns distributed into 2,393 shared types
in 114 countries (an online version of this database is
now available at http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr:8081/
SITVITDemo/). Patterns referenced only once are designated as true orphans (in opposition to pseudo-orphans,
i.e. isolates found to be unique in this study but for whom
a counterpart exists in the database) and are not labelled
with an ST number. Major phylogenetic clades were
assigned to STs according to signatures provided in
SpolDB4 (the reader is referred to the original paper [24]
for a detailed description). These included specific signatures for various M. tuberculosis sub-species (M. bovis, M.
microti, M. caprae, M. pinipedii, M. africanum), as well as
rules defining major lineages/sub-lineages for M. tuberculosis stricto sensu. The latter included the Central-Asian
(CAS) clade and 2 sub-lineages; the East-African-Indian
(EAI) clade and 9 sub-lineages; the Haarlem (H) clade and
3 sub-lineages; the Latin-American-Mediterranean (LAM)
clade and 12 presumed sub-lineages; the "Manu" family
and 3 sub-lineages; the S clade; the IS6110-low banding X
clade and 3 sub-lineages; and an ill-defined T clade with 5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/46

sub-lineages. The T clade corresponds to Principal Genetic
Groups (PGG) 2 and 3, and remains defined by default
(no specific signature sequences). M. tuberculosis families
are phylogeographically-specific, as generally indicated by
their names.
Phylogeography and cluster-graphs
Data were analysed by grouping isolates into clusters of
identical genotypes and by organizing all genotypes
present in the overall sample according to genetic relationships, i.e. by constructing a phylogeny. We used and
compared two methods for inferring potential phylogenetic relationships: (1) a classification based on spoligotyping results, which we call a "cluster-graph" and which
is based on parsimony principles, and (2) a minimum
spanning tree (MST) method which is based on a spoligotyping and VNTR combined distance matrix, computed
using the BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Sint
Marten-Latems, Belgium).

A cluster-graph is a new graphic illustration developed by
Tanaka and Francis [14] for representing and analysing
clonal pathogenic genotypes. The graphic tree is drawn
with genotypes at internal nodes, edges reflecting direct
evolutionary relationships between them, and the size of
the circle at the nodes being proportional to cluster sizes.
The first step is to form clusters of g distinct genotypes (g
nodes), then to connect all vertices whose genotypes are
separated by a single mutation step [14]. In our study,
connections between genotypes separated by more than
one mutation step were visualized within concentric successive circles which illustrated the increased number of
mutation events gained from inside to outside. The Figure
1 illustrates the difference between cluster-graph published by Tanaka and Francis, and the adaptation that we
made in the present exercise. The "BioLayout" software
was used to draw the networks (cluster-graph) representing genotype similarities, similarly as what can be done
for proteins considering their amino-acid content [25,26].
The cluster-graph method could not be applied to the
combined spoligotyping-VNTR data, as the manual inference of tree edges between genotypes needs to be supported by the number of mutations events between
different genotypes. The VNTR analyses giving occurrence
of ETR-A to E do not give any information about the
genetic distance between different VNTR patterns. VNTR
analyses were included on the construction of the minimum spanning tree method, in order to provide further
discrimination between strains for isolates with identical
spoligotyping results, Distance matrices are calculated
and the obtained groupings can be used to build a dendrogram.

which is indicative of the rate of recent TB transmission.
Thus, a result of 0.5 indicates that 50% of the isolates of a
data set were probably related to a recent transmission
event.

Estimation of transmission
Three indices of outbreak severity were calculated and
compared. The two first ones are referred to as recent
transmission indices (RTI) because they are intended to
reflect the extent of recent transmission of tuberculosis
[14]. The first index is RTIn = nc/n [10], where n is the total
number of cases in the sample and nc is the total number
of cases in cluster (size two or greater). The second one is
RTIn-1 = (nc - c)/n [11], where c is the number of genotypes
represented by at least two cases; i.e. one case per cluster,
which is supposed to be due to reactivation of a previous
TB case, is taken off. These have been referred to as the "n
method" and the "n-1 method" respectively [27,28]. The
underlined idea is that a more genetically homogeneous
data set would represent a more severe extent of disease
transmission, i.e. an "outbreak". The third index is the
transmission mutation index (TMI) [14].

TMI = μ

(n − g +ν 1)
ν1

where μ is an independent estimate of the mutation rate
of the genetic marker, and v1 is the number of single-step
mutation events inferred from the data [14]. We used a
mutation rate for spoligotypes of 0.039 events per year
computed from previous estimates in the literature
[14,29]. All three indices are expressed as a ratio from 0 to
1, which can also be expressed in percentage. It must be
interpreted in terms of "percent of isolates in cluster",

Molecular typing results
The spoligotyping was performed as a first-line screening
method on 344 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from
patients living in French Guiana, followed by VNTR performed on 273 clustered isolates. Among the 344 typed
isolates, spoligotyping generated 49 clustered patterns
totalling 273 isolates (with 2 to 48 patients per cluster),
25 true orphan patterns, and 46 pseudo-orphans, i.e. patterns already found in SpolDB4 but present as single in
this study, with a total amount of 120 different patterns.
Analysis of the frequency of major spoligotypes with
SpolDB4 allowed a differentiation between ubiquitous
types present in all the continents and types more specific
to French Guiana. Several types were endemic in French
Guiana (i.e. ST 66, 76, 94, 1084, 1340, 1526 and 25
orphan isolates), representing 25.8% of the shared-types,
and 12.2% of the total isolates. Ubiquitous types represent 40.8% of the 120 individual patterns, i.e. 70.6% of
the isolates.

Among the 49 clusters, we found 34 minor spoligotypes
(including two to four isolates), and 15 major spoligotypes (five or more isolates). ST 66, 72, 385, 958, 1337,
1339, 1340, 1486, 1762, 1763, and 1935 are over-represented in French Guiana, i.e. they represents more than
50% of total number of isolates associated to these STs
within the international spoligotype database SpolDB4.
When spoligotypes were subtyped by VNTRs-excluding 14
isolates for which at least one VNTR failed – the number
of cases per cluster decreased whereas the number of clusters slightly increased (52 clusters). Moreover, 17 spoligotype clusters on 49 were non-polymorphic for VNTR, i.e.
all cases of a same spoligotype cluster shared the same
VNTR profile. The main results of the molecular typing
analysis are summarized on Table 1 and Figure 2. If we
examine VNTR results of the five largest spoligotype clusters (including ten to forty-eight isolates), they were subdivided in 21 clusters (including two to twenty-four
isolates) and 14 individual patterns (see Table 2 for
details).
Phylogeographic analysis
Isolates of the T family predominated in our study (32.6%
of all isolates, 31.7% of all STs). The second major clade
was the LAM family (23.3% of all isolates, 27.5% of all
STs) followed by the Haarlem family (22.6% of all isolates, 10% of all STs), the EAI family (12.2% of all isolates,
20% of all STs) and finally the X family (5.8% of all isolates, 6.7% of all STs). Other families (M. africanum, BeiPage 4 of 11

illustrates the complete cluster-graph, with all the 120 different spoligotypes censused in French Guiana through
1996 to 2003. The different clades are represented with
different colours, and the size of nodes is proportional to
the corresponding cluster size, i.e. the number of isolates
per cluster. The cluster-graph reveals the likely ancestral
genotype of each clade. Some edges were missing to construct the complete cluster-graph and were added, unless

they were not censused in French Guiana during our survey (29 spoligotypes added, for example ST 119, putative
ancestor of the X superfamily). In comparison, Figure 4
represents the minimum spanning tree produced using
the BioNumerics software. Combined numerical analysis
of spoligotyping and VNTR data for all 344 isolates underlined at least three well-defined branches (called A, C, D)
emerging from a central cluster called B. When considering each branch in detail, it can be shown that identified
subgroups are most of the time not phylogenetically
informative, i.e. isolates present in a branch are not family
specific, except for branch D which is homogeneously
constituted by LAM genotypes. Branch A contains genotypes from T, Haarlem, Beijing, LAM and X families;
branch B shows genotypes from Haarlem, T, S and X families; and branch C contains genotypes from Haarlem,
EAI, LAM, likely Haarlem and M. africanum.
Estimation of transmission
Applying the indices previously described to our French
Guiana data set gives the following values: RTIn = 0.794,
RTIn-1 = 0.651, and TMI = 0.146, with n = 344 isolates, nc
= 273 isolates in cluster, c = 49 clusters, g = 120 spoligotypes and v1 = 82 edges involving a 1-step change. The
number v1 is equal to the number of genotypes g in the
data set minus the number of connected components,
which is calculated using the cluster-graph (Figure 3). The
RTI values here are very high compared to the same statistic computed on spoligotypes data (TMI), which means a
lower recent transmission rate evaluated with TMI
method. This difference is further explained in the discussion.

Molecular typing results
Our genotypic results seems to show a low level of TB
transmission as evidence through: (1) a high diversity of
spoligotypes (120 individual patterns for 344 isolates),
(2) a low mean cluster size (Table 1; Figure 2A) in spite of
the high level of clustering (79.4% of isolates included in
clusters; Table 1), and (3) a high degree of unique STs
(59.2%), i.e. ST that cannot be related to a recent event of
transmission. Moreover, the biggest clusters (48 and 39
isolates respectively; see Figure 2A) concern ubiquitous
spoligotypes 50 and 53, widely spread on all the five con-

tinents (spreading index SI equal to 20.95 and 28.09
respectively [30]), and for which interpretation in terms of
recent transmission remains difficult. However, we
should keep in mind the suboptimal choice of the spoligotyping-VNTR genotyping scheme, which provided only
a slight or no improvement compared to spoligotyping
only. However, for practical reasons, and given the time
frame covered (1996–2003), a full MIRU12 retrospective
characterization of our sample could not be performed.

Cluster-graph and minimum spanning tree
Comparison between two clustering methods underlined
major differences. The manual, parsimony-based, clustergraph method provides more coherent results, even if, in
this study, we did not consider VNTRs to build the graph.
The cluster-graph construction takes into account spoligotype evolution mechanisms, i.e. successive loss of one to
many consecutive spacers by a deletion mechanism [31]
whereas the algorithm used by BioNumerics takes into

putative ancestors of X clade and EAI clade, respectively).

Minimum spanning tree. It was constructed using the 1-Jaccard index and combining numerical analysis based on both spoligotyping and VNTR results. Options were chosen on BioNumerics software to allow the construction of hypothetical genotypes (which have not been censused in French Guiana), materialised on the tree as white circles. The four major branches are
called A, B, C and D. Branch D is homogeneously constituted by LAM genotypes. Branch A contains genotypes from T, Haarlem, Beijing, LAM and X families; branch B contains genotypes from Haarlem, T, S and X families; branch C shows genotypes
from Haarlem, EAI, LAM, likely Haarlem and M. africanum.

account the maximal similarity between spoligotypes
when considering the occurrence of the 43 spacers with
respect to chronology from 1 to 43. However such similarities do not systematically correspond to existing evolutionary mechanisms. Besides, it is well known that MST
provides a distance-based analysis that may not be considered as a true phylogenetic tree. One example is spoligotypes 4, 2 and 1, which were phylogenetically related to
branch A of the MST (Figure 4), based on identical
absence of contiguous spacers 1 to 24, as illustrated in Figure 5. In fact, those genotypes are from different families,
i.e. Haarlem (classification rule: absence of spacer 31 and

spacers 33–36), LAM (absence of spacers 21–24 and spacers 33–36) and Beijing clades (absence of spacers 1–34)
respectively [32]. Finally, minimum spanning trees are
more effective in case of exhaustive recruitments, in a very
circumscribed and closed human community, which is
not really the case in the present study.
Phylogeography from spoligotyping
Our results are coherent with migration and colonization
history of human populations in French Guiana. The
Haarlem clade (23% of our strains) is considered to be a
clade of European descent [33-35] and related spoligo-

belonging to the LAM clade (Latin-American and Mediterranean) might be best explained by population flows with
neighbouring Latin-American countries, in particular Brazil, or by historical Lusitanian or Spanish settling. Concerning the EAI clade (East-African Indian; 12% of STs),
the absence of many likely-ancestral STs was noticeable
(e.g. ST 236, the putative EAI ancestor, and 7 out of 10
absent STs on the one-mutation circle illustrated in Figure
3), whereas distant genotypes were censused, presumably
indicating a more recent expansion. The genotypes
present in French Guiana might have been introduced by
successive arrivals of Hakka settlers from Taiwan, Singapour, Hong-Kong, Vietnam and continental China since
1820

guyanefr2.htm, and more recently, by settlers from the
Lao-Hmong community which arrived in French Guyana
in 1977 [36]. But there are obvious limitations to what
can be achieved by spoligotyping, and the dominance of
T strains in the current study (33%) may (at best) demonstrate one of these. The T clade indeed remains an illdefined ubiquist family of M. tuberculosis found all over
the world [33,34], thus providing few phylogeographical
information.

frame of the present study (396 strains from 1994 to 2003
in [22] as compared to 344 isolates from 1996 to 2003 in
the present study). Comparing RTI and TMI indices, we
obtained a lower ongoing transmission rate with TMI
method. The three methods are based on the same hypothesis about the potential epidemiological link between
patients sharing the same M. tuberculosis strains. But the
major weakness with RTI methods is their failure to
account for strains diversity and mutation. The relationship between sample size n and the number of observed
genotypes g is complex and depends on sampling, mutation, and population history, which were not integrated in
previous RTI indices. In addition to being useful in visualizing data, cluster-graphs provide information about the
abundance of particular genotypes in the sample, as well
as partial information about possible evolutionary relationships, and can then be used as a way of understanding
indices measuring the severity of outbreaks. The TMI
result is the only one to be coherent with genotyping
results described above (high genotypic diversity, small
clusters, many orphans) which supposed a low level of
recent TB transmission. The concomitant hypothesis is an
endemic mode of TB transmission in French Guiana, with
little local contamination occurring from person to person, but an overall persistence of the disease due to the
large number of imported cases from countries with high
TB incidence rates.

Recent TB transmission in French Guiana
The calculated TMI indicates a recent transmission rate of
14.6% on the 1996–2003 period, instead of 79.4% and
65.1% of recent TB transmission calculated with RTIn and
RTIn-1 methods respectively. In a previous study [22], the
rate of recent transmission was calculated to be 49.3% in
French Guiana, using the RTIn-1 method based on the
combined spoligotyping and VNTRs genotyping. The difference between our RTIn-1 result and the previous study
is probably due to a different sampling and a smaller time

New "transmission mutation index" method
There are at least two biases that can occur when calculating TMI, and that may conduct to strictly opposite conclusions. The first possible bias is the emphasis of a single
epidemic picture, whereas there are several parallel epidemics. For example, when considering two genotypes g1
and g2 differing by one single mutation step, the two isolates will be associated in the cluster-graph and thus
related to a same epidemic, unless they potentially
acquired the related genotypes independently by conver-

gence, due to homoplasia. The infinite allele model,
which underlies the TMI method, does not take into
account such possibility, which can definitely occur.
The second possible bias is exactly the opposite, i.e. the
emphasis of several epidemics, whereas there is only one.
A sample is, by nature, incomplete. Thus, when isolates
included in a cluster-graph are sampled from a population, some cases might be missing, which will induce a
possible under-estimation of a cluster size, and/or overestimation of the number of different clusters. If one intermediate genotype is missing between two isolates, we will
detect two epidemics unless there is a single transmission
event.
A third bias can also be discussed here, considering the
hypothesis we made that, when person A contaminates
person B, their TB strains may differ at maximum by one
mutation event. In fact, this hypothesis is likely to be true
for spoligotypes, which have a low mutation rate. So, the
possible bias due to points 1 and 2 are believed to be
greater than this last one.
We must also notice that, because genotyping requires the
availability of a viable isolate of M. tuberculosis, the population for which genotyping is performed must be a subset
of all cases with positive cultures. In this study, 342 of 345
confirmed cases were spoligotyped. In turn, cases with
positive cultures must be a subset of all cases (culture positive, negative, or not done). A previous study on the Ilede-Cayenne, French Guiana, showed that 61.7% of identified cases were confirmed by isolation and cellule culture of M. tuberculosis [15]. This must be taken into
account when interpreting our results.
Last but not least, one should also pinpoint that no true
analysis of patient demographical and medical data could
be performed within the frame of this study. This is no
doubt a strong limitation, since it is well known that
molecular epidemiology performs well when collaboration between conventional and molecular epidemiology
is achieved. The main reason relates to the difficulty to
provide adequate human resources that would work for
such a long period on the epidemiology of tuberculosis;
however, even if a careful case-by-case analysis of the
patient file data could not be assessed within the frame of
the study, we fully assume that our results are a mirror of
the epidemic situation of tuberculosis in French Guiana.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/46

associated to low local transmission of the disease, with
both resurgence of old spatially restricted genotypes
(endemic to French Guiana), and an importation of new
TB genotypes by migration of TB infected people from
high-incidence countries. Endemic genotypes might also
be due, to a lower extent, to local mutation events. Those
results highlight the need for specific strategies of TB control in this region, considering those new epidemiological
hypotheses.
This study also suggested that our methods choice in order
to get a clear picture of the TB snapshot in a high prevalence setting such as French Guiana was indeed suboptimal. Genotyping of pathogens is a fast moving field that
also requires long-term experience and stability of methods to provide golden standards in molecular characterization. A decade of IS6110-RFLP predominance, has now
been efficiently challenged by the power of the Multi
Locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) approach, which has proven
to be useful for many pathogens. Meanwhile, the spoligotyping approach, once thought to be not discriminative
enough, has revealed to be an excellent long-term choice
in TB genotyping, not only because it is cheap and robust,
but also because the underlying role of the DR (a member
of the CRISPR family of repeats) is now better understood
[37], and because updated databases are regularly maintained. An ultimate player in this game, i.e. SNP genotyping, could become the most useful tool during the next
decade [38,39]. However, for the time-being, there is no
emerging consensus on what is the best genotyping
scheme to understand TB transmission based on molecular characterization of clinical isolates.

spoligotyping data to derive a TMI index provides more
sensitive results than previous RTI indices in order to
measure the severity of outbreaks. It allowed us to show
an endemic mode of TB transmission in French Guiana
