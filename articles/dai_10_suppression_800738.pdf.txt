Abstract
Background: Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) represent a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria which
are implicated in a large range of infections in humans and animals. Although subgroups of different ExPEC
pathotypes, including uropathogenic, newborn meningitis causing, and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) share a
number of virulence features, there still might be factors specifically contributing to the pathogenesis of a certain
subset of strains or a distinct pathotype. Thus, we made use of suppression subtractive hybridization and
compared APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:K1:H5; sequence type complex 95) with human uropathogenic E. coli strain
CFT073 (O6:K2:H5; sequence type complex 73) to identify factors which may complete the currently existing model
of APEC pathogenicity and further elucidate the position of this avian pathoype within the whole ExPEC group.
Results: Twenty-eight different genomic loci were identified, which are present in IMT5155 but not in CFT073. One
of these loci contained a gene encoding a putative autotransporter adhesin. The open reading frame of the gene
spans a 3,498 bp region leading to a putative 124-kDa adhesive protein. A specific antibody was raised against this
protein and expression of the adhesin was shown under laboratory conditions. Adherence and adherence
inhibition assays demonstrated a role for the corresponding protein in adhesion to DF-1 chicken fibroblasts.
Sequence analyses revealed that the flanking regions of the chromosomally located gene contained sequences of
mobile genetic elements, indicating a probable spread among different strains by horizontal gene transfer. In
accordance with this hypothesis, the adhesin was found to be present not only in different phylogenetic groups of
extraintestinal pathogenic but also of commensal E. coli strains, yielding a significant association with strains of
avian origin.
Conclusions: We identified a chromosomally located autotransporter gene in a highly virulent APEC strain which
confers increased adherence of a non-fimbriated E. coli K-12 strain to a chicken fibroblast cell line. Even though
flanked by mobile genetic elements and three different genetic regions upstream of the gene, most probably
indicating horizontal gene transfer events, the adhesin gene was significantly linked with strains of avian origin.
Due to the nucleotide sequence similarity of 98% to a recently published adhesin-related gene, located on plasmid
pAPEC-O1-ColBM, the name aatA (APEC autotransporter adhesin A) was adopted from that study.
Our data substantiate that AatA might not only be of relevance in APEC pathogenicity but also in facilitating their
reservoir life style in the chicken intestine, which might pave the way for future intestinal preventive strategies.

Background
Escherichia coli typically colonize the mammalian and
avian gastrointestinal tract and other mucosal surfaces.
While many of these strains are commensal, certain
pathogenic strains have the ability to cause severe diseases [1]. Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are
a group of strains that are implicated in a large range of
infections in humans and animals, such as neonatal
meningitis, urinary tract infection, intra abdominal
infection, pneumonia, osteomyelitis and septicaemia
[2-4]. Among the typical extraintestinal infections
caused by ExPEC in humans are urinary tract infections
(UTIs), which are a major public health concern in
developed countries costing healthcare systems billions
of dollars annually [5]. Similarly, systemic infection
caused by avian ExPEC isolates (avian pathogenic E.
coli, APEC) is an economically devastating disease to
poultry industries [3]. APEC enter and colonize the
avian respiratory tract by inhalation of fecal dust leading
to localized infections such as airsacculitis and pneumonia. In certain cases, they spread into various internal
organs typically causing pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, salpingitis and other extraintestinal diseases. Systemic infection of poultry is characterized in its acute
form by septicemia, commonly resulting in sudden
death [3,6].
Previous studies showed that certain subsets of ExPEC
strains isolated from different host organisms show high
rates of similarity [7-9], envisioning their zoonotic
potential, which makes their intensive study even more
important.
In general, single ExPEC pathotypes show a high
diversity due to differences in the set of virulence genes
in their genomes as well as different phylogenetic backgrounds [4]. Thus, unique virulence profiles shared by
different human and animal ExPEC pathotypes only
rarely exist [7,8].
Although a high number of virulence factors has
already been identified, the molecular basis of APEC
pathogenesis is not yet fully understood [10,11]. Furthermore, with respect to the unavailability of vaccines eliciting an immune response towards all strains belonging
to the highly diverse APEC group, it would be of special
importance to identify such virulence factors, which
could at the same time, serve as good vaccine candidates. Adhesins, e. g., are known to represent well established targets for the development of vaccines against a
number of infectious diseases [12]. Among these bacterial proteins with adhesive properties are autotransporter
adhesins, forming a large and diverse family. However,
in principal, all members of this family share conserved
structural features, that is (i) a secretion signal for the
sec pathway in the N-terminus, (ii) a conserved C-

Page 2 of 17

terminal translocation domain inserting into the outer
membrane of the bacterial cell, and (iii) a variable internal functional passenger domain, which is translocated
to the bacterial surface [13]. This process is also known
as type V secretion pathway which can involve two proteins, namely a transport and a secreted protein or, as it
is the case for autotransporter adhesins, only one protein with dual function [14]. More than 700 members of
the autotransporter family are known [15] exhibiting
very diverse functions conferred by their surfaceexposed passenger domains. They can be involved in
proteolysis, cytotoxicity, serum resistance, cell-to-cell
spread, autoaggregation, biofilm formation, invasion, and
adhesion [13].
Our work focuses on APEC strain IMT5155 and its
natural interaction with the chicken host, particularly
concentrating on the identification of novel adhesins,
conferring the primary and most vital step in the pathogen-host interaction [16]. To further unravel factors
possibly involved in APEC pathogenicity, Suppression
Subtractive Hybridization was applied to the genome of
APEC strain IMT5155 and human UPEC strain
CFT073, both allocated to different multilocus sequence
type complexes, leading to the identification of the putative APEC autotransporter adhesin gene aatA. A 98%
identical gene was also found in strain APEC_O1 by Li
and co-authors only recently [17]. The respective gene
aatA and its localization in the IMT5155 genome was
analyzed and compared with similar loci present in
sequenced E. coli genomes. To verify the functional role
of the putative adhesin in vitro adhesion assays were
performed using DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells. In addition, a representative collection of ExPEC and commensal E. coli strains from different hosts and phylogenetic
groups was screened for the presence of the adhesin
gene to determine whether it is associated with specific
pathotypes or phylogenetic groups.

Results
Identification of genes present in APEC strain IMT5155
but absent in human UPEC strain CFT073

The aim of the work presented here was to identify new
potential virulence genes specific for avian pathogenic
E. coli (APEC) strains, which might be important in the
pathogenesis of systemic infections in poultry and helpful in delineating this pathotype from other ExPEC
pathotypes. By applying Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) to APEC strain IMT5155 and human
ExPEC strain CFT073, 96 clones were obtained from
the not yet sequenced APEC strain IMT5155 which
were not present in the archetypical UPEC strain
CFT073. These 96 clones were amplified by PCR and
cloned into plasmid pCR2.1. To explore the specificity

of these gene fragments for APEC strain IMT5155, PCR
amplicons were transferred to a nylon membrane and
southern hybridization analysis was performed with
labelled genomic DNA of UPEC strain CFT073 and K12 strain MG1655, respectively. Among the 96 clones,
34 contained an insert neither hybridizing with the
labelled genomic DNA of CFT073 nor with that of K-12
strain MG1655. Thus, a total of 34 DNA fragments supposed to be specific for IMT5155 were sequenced [GenBank: AM230450 to AM230483]. Subsequent BLAST
analyses revealed that 28 DNA fragments, ranging from
100 bp to 1000 bp in size, were indeed absent from the
genome of CFT073 and K-12 strain MG1655 and were
regarded as specific for APEC strain IMT5155 in the
experimental approach. Sequences of the identified loci
and their corresponding products, respectively, show
similarities to bacteriophages; EntS/YbdA MFS transporter proteins, conjugal transfer proteins; restriction modification enzymes and different biosynthesis enzymes, e.g.
a polysialic acid biosynthesis protein, a poly-alpha-2,8
sialosyl sialyltransferase, a phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a dTDP-rhamnosyl transferase and a glycosyltransferase. Nine of the identified fragments were
similar to sequences encoding proteins of unknown
function.
One of the SSH fragments (namely B11, with a size of
225 bp, GeneBank AM230456.1) was of special interest
to us, as its potential product showed sequence similarity to proteins of the family of bacterial autotransporter
adhesins, including a putative adhesin gene located on
pAPEC-O1-ColBM plasmid, which at the time of our
analysis, was not described in detail. Our further analyses focused on this gene. A 6,154 bp sequence of
IMT5155 containing the open reading frame and the
flanking regions of the gene was submitted to GenBank
[GU550065]. According to the nucleotide sequence
similarity of 98% to the previously described adhesin
gene aatA (APEC autotransporter adhesin A), which is
located on plasmid pAPEC-O1-ColBM [18], we adopted
the name and focussed our further study on a detailed
characterization of IMT5155 AatA.
Sequence analysis of the autotransporter adhesin gene
aatA

To determine the complete sequence of aatA and its
flanking region we generated a cosmid library of APEC
strain IMT5155. This library was screened by PCR using
three different oligonucleotide pairs (4031 to 4036, see
Additional file 1: Table S1). After identification of the E.
coli clone containing a cosmid with the aatA sequence,
the cosmid DNA was isolated and sequenced. Double
strand sequence information was obtained for the complete predicted open reading frame (ORF; Figure 1A) of
aatA (3,498 bp) and 2,656 additional nucleotides of the

Page 3 of 17

surrounding region. MegaBlastN analyses revealed a 98%
sequence identity of this ORF with a coding sequence
from E. coli APEC_O1 (Acc. No. NC_009837.1; locus
pAPEC-O1-ColBM [18]). In addition, homologues were
also found in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (NC_012947.1;
locus ECBD_0123) and E. coli strain B_REL606
(NC_012967.1; locus ECB_03531) showing a 99% identity
to aatA. The coverage for the 98 to 99% identical region
was 100% in BL21, B_REL606, and APEC_O1, respectively.
Figure 1A gives an overview of the genomic locus of
IMT5155 containing the aatA ORF. Figure 2 shows the
comparison of the 6,154 bp genome regions of the strains
containing aatA. The schematic view of the genome loci
reflects similarities and differences among the sequenced
E. coli strains harbouring aatA. As illustrated in this figure,
the ORF of the adhesin gene is conserved among
IMT5155, APEC_O1, BL21, and B_REL606, whereas the
surrounding regions differ, except for BL21 and B_REL606
which show 100% identity in this region. Further analysis
of the sequences up- and downstream of aatA showed
that in the strains mentioned above the 5′ as well as the 3′
flanking regions encode mobile elements (Figure 2).
Among these are sequences similar to insertion sequence
IS2 and IS91 in the 5′ flanking region of aatA and genes
coding for insertion sequences IS1, IS30 and IS629 in the
3′ flanking region, respectively. The presence of genes
encoding transposases in all four strains suggests that
aatA has been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
Sequence analyses also revealed that aatA is likely to be
a single gene locus and not part of an operon. This is in
accordance with data of other autotransporter adhesins
[13,19]. Promoter prediction analysis with 200 bp
upstream of the ATG showed two possible transcriptional start sites at position -59 (p = 0.97) and -86 (p =
0.97) relative to the ATG of the aatA ORF in IMT5155.
This 200 bp region is almost identical in APEC_O1
(except one bp exchange and one nucleotide deletion).
The most likely transcriptional start site is predicted at
position -85 (p = 0.97) relative to the ATG of the aatA
ORF. The 200 bp region upstream of aatA in strains
BL21 and B_REL606 shows only 70% identity to the
respective region in APEC strain IMT5155. A possible
transcriptional start site was predicted at position -54
(p = 1.0) relative to the ATG. Expression analyses in later
studies showed that the promoter of the IMT5155 aatA
lies within the 100 bp upstream of the ORF (see below).
aatA is plasmid-encoded in APEC_O1 but not in APEC
strain IMT5155

Although APEC strains APEC_O1 and IMT5155, both
assigned to multi locus sequence type complex (STC)
95, are closely related the surrounding regions of aatA
significantly differ in these strains. The genome
sequence of APEC_O1 reveals that the aatA homolog in

open reading frame (ORF) of aatA is indicated as grey arrow. Black bars indicate PCR fragments amplified using oligonucleotides marked as black
arrows. The size of each fragment and the ORF are given in brackets. B: Scheme of the predicted protein AatA. The 3,498 bp ORF results in
the 124-kDa APEC autotransporter adhesin A. Sequence analyses revealed the given domain structure. At the N-terminus a signal peptide (SP) is
predicted which probably enables the sec machinery to secrete AatA across the cytoplasmic membrane. The autotransporter repeat (ATr) is
found in many AT adhesins and proteins, which are predicted as AT adhesins. The alignment below the protein structure shows conserved
amino acid (aa) residues within one AT repeat. C-terminal of the AT repeat lies the predicted functional passenger domain found in AT adhesins
(PD). The AT-adhesin-typical translocation domain (TD) resides at the C-terminus of the protein. C: Scheme of fusion protein AatAF. Using
oligonucleotides B11-for and B11-rev the 1,222 bp fragment aatA_1222, comprising the region for the AT repeat and the functional PD was
amplified by PCR and cloned into pET32a(+) for expression. The 64-kDa fusion protein AatAF contains an enterokinase recognition site (EK), an S
tag, a thrombin site (T), a His6 tag and a thioredoxin tag (Trx) fused to the N-terminus of the adhesin peptide to enhance protein solubility and
to simplify protein purification.

this strain is located on the 174,241 bp pAPEC-O1ColBM plasmid, downstream of the eitABCD operon
[18]. Sequence analysis of the IMT5155 ColV plasmid
p1ColV 5155 (about 181 kb) as well as of the second
IMT5155 plasmid p2 5155 (4.6 kb) (U. Böhnke and
C. Ewers, unpublished data) showed that aatA is not
plasmid-located in IMT5155.
aatA encodes a protein with features of an
autotransporter

BLASTX analyses with the IMT5155 aatA ORF revealed
that the potential AatA protein comprises a signal

peptide at the N-terminus as predicted with the SignalP
3.0 Server; an autotransporter repeat conserved among
autotransporter adhesins from different bacterial species;
a passenger domain and a C-terminal translocation
domain (Figure 1B and Table 1). According to these
data, aatA likely encodes an adhesin of the autotransporter family.
Thus, the relation of this protein to other autotransporter family members was further investigated. ClustalW http://align.genome.jp/ analyses were performed
with 24 protein sequences from already known adhesins
of the autotransporter family including proteins from

Figure 2 Comparison of the genome regions surrounding aatA of IMT5155, APEC_O1, B_REL606 and BL21. In total we sequenced 6,154
bp of the strain IMT5155 including the aatA gene, 1,072 bp upstream and 1,584 bp downstream of aatA. Our sequence was compared with the
comparable 6,154 bp genome regions of the sequenced strains harbouring aatA homologs: APEC_O1, B_REL606 and BL21. Open reading frames
(ORFs) are shown as arrows. White arrows represent known genes, predicted ORFs are shown in grey and insertion sequences or an ORF

Yersinia enterocolitica, Moraxella catarrhalis, Helicobacter pylori, Xylella fastidiosa, Salmonella Typhimurium,
Bordetella pertussis and the newly identified E. coli
IMT5155 adhesin AatA (Figure 3). Protein sequences
were obtained from the NCBI database and the respective Accession numbers are given in Figure 3. The
results presented as phylogenetic tree (N-J tree) show
that AatA clusters within one group together with
AIDA-I (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence), TibA
(toxigenic invasion locus B protein A) and Ag43 (antigen 43) from E. coli, which are closely related to ShdA
(similar to the C-terminal region of AIDA; IcsA) from
Salmonella and Pertactin from Bordetella. We also
investigated the 24 adhesins including only their last
256 amino acid residues according to the smallest protein HadA to circumvent false results due to different
protein lengths. The results were comparable to those of
the analyses of the complete protein sequences.

Similarly, comparing only the C-termini, AIDA-I clusters in one phylogenetic branch with AatA, thus the Cterminus of AatA seems to be most related to that of
AIDA-I (Figure 3B). The amino acid residue alignment
of the C-termini of AIDA-I and AatA revealed a number of identical residues as shown in Figure 3C. Comparing only the C-terminus one has to keep in mind
that this part contains the transmembrane domain to
span the bacterial membrane, thus it is likely to be the
most conserved part among all autotransporter adhesins.
We also examined the amino acid differences of the
conserved AatA proteins in E. coli IMT5155, APEC_O1
and BL21 and B_REL606, respectively. The AatA of the
latter two strains are 100% identical. In total, 19 amino
acid substitutions were found in the C-terminus containing the transmembrane domain; 3 variable positions
lie within the passenger domain and 13 differences
in amino acid sequence were found in the N-termini of
the AatA proteins (Figure 4). Interestingly, the

Figure 4 Comparison of the AatA proteins of IMT5155, APEC_O1, BL21, and B_REL606. AatA amino acid sequences were compared using
MegAlign (Lasergene 6, DNASTAR, WI, USA). Proteins are depicted as schemes indicating specific protein domains as predicted (SP: signal
peptide; ATr: autotransporter repeat region; PD: passenger domain; TD: transmembrane domain). Amino acid differences are shown as lines. Red
lines indicate differences to the IMT5155-AatA amino acid sequence. The total number of amino acid substitutions is given for each protein
domain below the protein schemes.

transmembrane domains of BL21 and IMT5155 are
100% identical and the 19 C-terminal amino acid differences occur in APEC_O1 compared to these two strains.
Also the majority of amino acid substitutions within the
N-terminus (10 of 13) occur in APEC_O1 in contrast to
the almost identical AatA proteins from BL21 and
IMT5155 (only 3 substitutions). Taken together, the
adhesins of the two APEC strains differ more than the
AatA proteins of IMT5155 and the non-pathogenic
BL21 strain. It is notable that most differences are present in the C-terminus which forms a pore through the
membrane and is thus functionally conserved whereas
the passenger domains are known to be variable among
the autotransporter adhesin family members.
aatA is expressed in APEC IMT5155

To determine whether aatA is transcribed in wild-type
strain IMT5155 under laboratory conditions, its expression was studied by quantitative real-time PCR including
aatA-negative UPEC strain CFT073 and aatA-positive
strains BL21 and APEC_O1. Expression of aatA was
detectable in all aatA-positive strains after growth in
LB. Interestingly, our analysis revealed different transcriptional levels of aatA in IMT5155, APEC_O1 and
BL21 when compared to the constitutively expressed
housekeeping gene gyrB. In detail, we observed an
increased transcription of aatA in APEC_O1 (2.71 ±
0.33 fold change), while BL21 showed a considerable
lower transcription level of this gene (0.16 ± 0.33 fold
change) as compared with the transcription level determined for aatA in IMT5155. As expected no specific
transcription was detected for aatA in CFT073 (fold
change < 0.0001).
AatA triggers antibody production in rabbits

To investigate if the aatA transcript in IMT5155 is
indeed translated into the expected AatA protein, a specific antibody against AatA was raised.

For the production of specific AatA antibodies we
cloned the internal part of aatA (1,222 bp from position
1,375 bp to 2,596 bp within the ORF) into expression
vector pET32a(+) under the control of the IPTG-inducible T7 promoter (see Figure 1). The resulting construct
led to the expression of a 64-kDa fusion protein in E.
coli BL21 designated AatAF (see Figure 1C for overview). Figure 5 shows a coomassie stained SDS-PAGE,
demonstrating that AatAF was well expressed in E. coli
BL21 after induction with IPTG (compare lane 1 and 2)
and successfully purified using the HisTrap column
(lane 3). The purified protein was then used to produce
specific AatA antibodies as described in methods.
To confirm that the produced antibody is specific and
able to recognize not only the fusion protein AatAF but
also the native wild-type protein AatA, total protein
extract of the strain BL21(pET32a:aatAF) prior and after
induction of the IPTG-inducible promoter as well as the
purified fusion protein AatAF and total protein extracts
of strains IMT5155, APEC_O1, CFT073 and MG1655
were separated on an SDS gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. As shown in Figure 6
incubation with anti-AatA indeed led to the detection of
protein bands of the expected size for AatAF in the
total extract of BL21(pET32a:aatAF) and wild-type AatA
protein in APEC strains IMT5155 and APEC_O1,
respectively. As expected, no signal was observed for
CFT073 and MG1655, which have no aatA homolog in
their genomes. Taken together our data show that AatA
is suitable for the production of specific antibodies.
Furthermore, this antibody recognizes wild-type AatA
protein, demonstrating that APEC strains IMT5155 and
APEC_O1 express a protein of the expected size, thus
the gene in their genomes is likely to encode a functional adhesin. Surprisingly, no band of the expected
size for AatA was detectable in strain BL21, which
might be due to several reasons, including the lower
transcription of the gene in this strain probably due to

cells. Furthermore, our data show that the aatA promoter lies within the 100 bp upstream of the gene.
AatA is involved in adhesion of APEC strain IMT5155

Expression of AatA in the fim negative E. coli strain
AAEC189 leads to enhanced adhesion abilities

Based on sequence analyses it was assumed that also the
chromosomal aatA variant encodes a protein with adhesive function. To verify this, adhesion assays were performed using the chicken embryo fibroblast cell line
DF-1. For this, aatA was expressed under control of its
native promoter in E. coli strain AAEC189. AAEC189 is
an MG1655 strain in which the fim operon is deleted
leading to a reduced adhesion in in vitro assays [20].
AAEC189(pUC18:aatA +P ) and the control strain
AAEC189(pUC18) were incubated with DF-1 cells for 3
h. As shown in Figure 7A, the aatA containing strain
displayed a 1.9 fold increase in adherence as compared
to the adhesion of the negative control (P = 0.009). This
suggests that AatA mediates adhesion of E. coli cells to
chicken cells. To prove that AatA is indeed expressed,
total extracts of AAEC189(pUC18) and AAEC189
(pUC18:aatA +P ) were analyzed by immunoblot with
anti-AatA antibody. As shown in Figure 6 (lane 4) a specific protein band appears for strain AAEC189(pUC18:
aatA +P ), which has the expected size of AatA. Taken
together, our data demonstrate that AAEC189(pUC18:
aatA+P) expresses AatA wild-type protein, which leads
to enhanced adhesion of AAEC189. Thus, we can
assume a role of AatA in adhesion of E. coli to chicken

In order to investigate the role of AatA in adhesion of the
wild-type APEC strain IMT5155 we have chosen an
adhesion inhibition approach using specific anti-AatA
antibody for pre-treatment of bacteria prior to incubation
with DF-1 cells. Bacteria pre-treated with pre-immune
serum served as control. As shown in Figure 7B the antiAatA antibody slightly reduced E. coli IMT5155 adherence to DF-1 cells, which indicates that AatA might play
a role in adhesion of IMT5155 to eukaryotic cells. However, the difference is rather low. This observation is
probably due to the number of other adhesins present in
IMT5155, which are not blocked by the anti-AatA antibody and thus are still able to mediate adhesion.
In a second complementary adhesion inhibition
approach DF-1 cells were pre-incubated with purified
and refolded AatAF protein and with BSA as negative
control, respectively, prior to the adhesion assay. Bacterial cells, which adhered to the pre-treated DF-1 cells,
were harvested and the number of adherent bacteria
was determined. As shown in Figure 7C, the incubation
of DF-1 cells with AatAF led to a reduction in adhesion
of IMT5155 as compared to cells pre-incubated with
BSA. As described above, IMT5155 expresses AatA
under the growth conditions used for adhesion assays.
In conclusion, our results indicate that AatA plays a
role in adhesion of IMT5155 to chicken cells.
Distribution of aatA among 779 ExPEC isolates with
regard to pathotype, host, and ECOR group

Out of a total of 779 E. coli tested, 186 isolates (23.9%)
were found to be positive for aatA (Table 2). Turning
our attention to APEC strains, we found that 32.7% of
336 isolates harboured aatA (P < 0.001), while the gene
was less frequently observed among UPEC (4.7%) and
other ExPEC (9.1%) isolates and completely absent in
NMEC strains. Interestingly, a high percentage (28.9%)
of commensal strains, in particular of avian sources
(56.3%; P < 0.001) was positive for aatA. Taking a closer
look at the association of the host and the presence of
aatA in ExPEC strains, we observed that 38.4% (n =
168) of avian strains harboured the gene, accounting for
90.3% of all 186 aatA positive strains. Essentially minor
percentages of aatA-positive strains were recovered
from companion animals (3.2%) and humans (5.1%),
while among various non-avian hosts, only pigs and cattle also infrequently possessed aatA (other animals:
16.7%). Statistical analyses confirmed a positive correlation of aatA-possessing strains to birds and a negative
correlation to strains from humans and companion animals (both P < 0.0001).

Figure 6 Expression of AatA in different E. coli strains. The purified fusion protein (lane 1) and total protein extract of BL21(pET32a:aatAF)
(lanes 2 and 3), expressing AatAF under the control of the IPTG-inducible promoter, AAEC189(pUC18:aatA+P) expressing aatA under the control
of the native promoter and AAEC189(pUC18) (lanes 4 and 5), APEC_O1 (lane 6), IMT5155 (lane7), CFT073 (lane 8) and MG1655 (lane 9) were
separated on an SDS gel and blotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was then incubated with anti-AatA antibody.

Although aatA was detected in strains of all major phylogenetic groups, the highest percentage of positive
strains was observed in ECOR group D (39.1%; P <
0.001) and in descending order in groups B1 (27.0%), A
(22.6), and B2 (17.2%) (Table 2). The frequent presence
of aatA-positive strains within ECOR group D is even
more remarkable if we merely consider avian strains,
whether pathogenic or not. Among 438 strains from
birds, 57.6% (49 out of 85) group D strains were aatApositive, while a lower percentage was calculated for
groups A (29.7%; 41/138), B1 (39.5%; 30/76), and B2
(34.3%; 48/140).
To get an idea about the distribution of the three different aatA “variants” as determined by the variable
flanking regions observed by sequencing and in silico
analyses, a set of 148 aatA-positive strains were analysed
by three PCRs using primers specifically binding to the
internal part of aatA and to the respective flanking
genes fecI (IMT5155; variant 1), ykgN (BL21; variant 2),
and eitD (APEC_O1; variant 3), the latter one likely
reflecting a plasmid localization of aatA in the respective positive strains. Most of the strains tested

harboured aatA-flanking variant 1 (21.6%) and variant 2
(18.2%), both putatively resembling a chromosomal location of aatA in these strains. On the contrary, the
APEC_O1 episomal variant 3 was only observed in 6.8%
of the strains. More than 50% of the strains were negative for all three variants tested, indicating the presence
of yet other regions flanking the aatA gene, which
remain to be determined.

Discussion
The pathogenesis of E. coli is a multifactorial process
depending on a variety of pathogenicity factors. A vast
amount of already known and still unknown virulence
determinants defines the virulence of a certain strain
and thus the strength of the disease symptoms induced
in the corresponding host organism. Although recent
studies revealed considerable intersection between
ExPEC pathotypes in general, the set of virulence genes
present in pathogenic strains can differ considerably in
terms of number and combination of genes [7,8,21].
Thus, the identification and characterization of additional virulence associated factors would still improve

our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
pathogenicity and virulence of a certain group of E. coli
strains.
Making use of two clinical strains, namely IMT5155
and CFT073, which differ with respect to host (avian
versus human), pathotype (APEC vs. UPEC), O-type
(O2 vs. O6), and multilocus sequence type (STC95 vs.
STC73) in an SSH approach we identified an E. coli
adhesin of the autotransporter family. The method of
SSH enabled us to determine genes of the so far not
sequenced APEC strain IMT5155 representing a well
studied prototype strain isolated from a chicken in a
German poultry flock which had experienced a severe
outbreak of systemic E. coli infection [10,16]. At the
beginning of our studies, no sequence information was
available for any APEC strain. Thus, SSH promised to
be a useful tool to achieve sequence information about
specific genes present in the avian pathogen but not in
the human UTI strain albeit both being ExPEC strains.
Indeed SSH has successfully been used in the past in
many aspects, including the identification of virulence
genes [22-25].
Among 28 DNA fragments that were specific for
IMT5155 in our SSH approach, a 225 bp fragment,
which showed similarity to putative adhesins, attracted
our attention. Although in the run of our experiments a
98% identical adhesin gene as well as the functional role
of its product in vitro and in vivo have been published
by Li and colleagues [17], we still considered it important to complete our data as we observed some essential
differences to the mentioned study.
Adhesins are involved in the first step of infection,
allowing the primary and intimate contact of the pathogen with its host cell, initiating a pathogenic cascade.
Their localization at the bacterial surface and their supposed function for enhanced gut colonization in terms
of an intestinal reservoir make adhesins attractive candidates for vaccine developmental strategies [16].
APEC strain IMT5155 harbours the fim genes for the
type 1 fimbriae, csg genes for curli fibers and the temperature-sensitive haemagglutinin (tsh) gene [16]. It is
interesting that IMT5155 lacks P, F1C, S and Dr fimbriae, known to be specifically involved in UPEC pathogenesis [16,26,27]. Thus, other, so far unidentified
adhesins might play a role in IMT5155 pathogenesis.
Indeed, we recently identified the yqi gene cluster
encoding a fimbrial type of adhesin, called EA/I, that
has been shown to confer an adhesive phenotype to a
fim negative K-12 strain [16]. Our data presented here
show that autotransporter adhesin AatA might also play
a certain role in the pathogenesis of APEC infections. In
fact, few autotransporter type adhesins have been shown
to be involved in APEC virulence to date. In 1994, Tsh
which confers agglutination of chicken erythrocytes, was

identified in APEC strain c7122 [28]. Later, Dozois and
co-workers showed that Tsh probably contributes to the
development of air sac lesions in birds [19]. Furthermore, it turned out that the vacuolating autotransporter
toxin Vat, identified in APEC strain Ec222 for the first
time, was involved in the development of cellulitis in
broiler chickens [29]. Comparable to Tsh and Vat, AatA
of APEC IMT5155 comprises all structural motifs characteristic for members of the family of autotransporter
proteins: a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which
would be recognized by the Sec secretion machinery; an
autotransporter repeat, a passenger domain and a Cterminal translocation domain were predicted.
Adherence inhibition assay with a fusion protein containing the central part of the AatA protein confirmed
the adhesive properties of AatA. This central part comprises the passenger domain, which is the secreted and
surface-exposed protein part and thus the protein
domain with supposed virulence function. While the
translocation domain is highly conserved, the passenger
domain demonstrates considerable sequence variation
[12] making it a good candidate to gain specific antibodies against AatA.
By quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot assays
we could show that IMT5155 and APEC_O1 wildtype
aatA are expressed under lab conditions, which stands
in contrast to what Li et al. (2010) stated for APEC_O1
in their recent publication [17]. These contradictory

observations might in part be explained by different procedures used for antibody production, which could have
led to a better detection of the AatA wild-type protein
in our study. The failure to detect the very similar
BL21-AatA protein with our antibody could be due to
the low transcript level as indicated by qPCR experiments. Lower transcription might in turn have occurred
due to sequence changes in the promoter regions in
front of the IMT5155 and BL21 aatA ORFs, which in
fact show only 70% identity. Adhesion assays with the
fim negative strain AAEC189 expressing the IMT5155
AatA confirmed not only the adhesive properties for
AatA but also the functionality of the predicted native
promoter region. In addition, adhesion inhibition assays
indicated a role for AatA as adhesin for IMT5155,
which substantiates the findings of Li et al. [17] and
indicates that the location of aatA, either on a plasmid
or on the chromosome, does not seem to have any
influence on the function of the adhesin, which has to
be further investigated in the future.
The ability of bacteria to adhere to a diverse range of
surfaces including different host tissues and abiotic elements is essential for colonization, survival and persistence [30,31]. This is demonstrated by the enormous
number of different adhesins known so far. It is
assumed that a bacterial cell has such a huge set of
diverse adhesive proteins to be able to adhere to different tissues and surfaces [15,31]. Indeed the results of

Dai et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/236

our adhesion inhibition assays supported this idea as
blocking of IMT5155 and of DF-1 cells did not have a
relevant effect on the adhesion property, showing that
other adhesins are still effectively mediating adhesion.
An involvement of AatA in adhesion does not necessarily predict its vital importance for the virulence of a
strain in vivo. However virulence, in particular with
regard to ExPEC strains, is often a result of the interplay of several factors, with adhesion-related factors
representing one of the most essential groups. Here, a
number of adhesins are involved making it difficult to
assess the contribution of one single adhesin to disease
symptoms. However, for the 98% identical AatA of
APEC_O1 its contribution to full virulence in chicken
was shown [17].
One simple view is that one adhesin specifically mediates the adhesion to one specific receptor on the eukaryotic cell. This assumption led to the question if AatA
isolated from APEC IMT5155, which enters the chicken
via the respiratory tract, specifically recognizes proteins
of the avian trachea and lung tissue. Interestingly,
deduced from the amino acid sequence, AatA clustered
together with Pertactin from B. pertussis, an adhesin
which mediates binding to the lung epithelium of mammals (Figure 3; [32,33]). As this is just a presumptive
sequence-based finding, the identification of the host tissue receptor and its interaction with AatA has to be
explored in future studies.
A number of publications claim that autotransporter
adhesins are of special interest as they constitute an
essential component of vaccines used in the medical
area [12]. Pertactin from Bordetella pertussis was the
first autotransporter adhesin used as a vaccine [34]. Also
for Hap from H. influenzae elicitation of specific antibody titres was shown in mice [35]. Indeed, new classes
of these drugs are needed because of the increasing incidence of pathogenic organisms resistant to conventional
antimicrobial agents; and it is believed that strains with
genotypic resistance to the anti-adhesion agents will
spread much slower than strains resistant to conventional drugs, such as antimicrobial substances [36].
Here, we show that specific antibodies can be produced
against AatA. Furthermore, we performed prevalence
studies to verify if AatA fulfils criteria to serve as vaccine component from an epidemiological point of view.
In contrast to the previously described novel adhesin
gene yqi, initially identified in APEC strain IMT5155
[16], aatA was significantly associated with avian isolates, in that more than 90% of all positively tested
strains were APEC and avian commensal strains, respectively, which is in accordance with the findings of Li et
al. [17]. Envisioning an intestinal prevention strategy
that aims to combat pathogenic strains from colonizing
the proposed intestinal reservoir, the frequent presence

Page 12 of 17

of aatA in avian commensal strains would basically contradict this idea, as the biological function of the physiological microbiota, including that of non-pathogenic E.
coli strains, should not be diminished by such a vaccine.
However, a high percentage of aatA positive strains was
allocated to phylogenetic groups B2 and D. Avian commensal strains belonging to these groups have recently
been shown to harbour an essential set of virulence
genes and to be pathogenic for chickens [37]. Thus,
they represent pathogenic strains residing in the chicken
intestine rather than fulfilling the criteria of non-pathogenic strains. In conclusion, AatA might not only be
relevant to the adhesion of the upper respiratory tract of
birds and subsequent pathogenic processes but seems to
promote intestinal colonization, thereby contributing to
the maintenance and transmission of pathogenic strains.
A similar situation could be imagined for aatA positive
E. coli strain B_REL606 that has been isolated from the
human gut, but to our knowledge has not undergone
further characterization in terms of potential extraintestinal virulence so far.
Li and colleagues found a significant association of
aatA with isolates assigned to phylogenetic group D
with 70% of APEC strains from this phylogenetic group
being aatA-positive, and more than half of all aatApositive strains belonging to phylogenetic group D [17].
We observed a similar situation among our strain collection, while a distinction between different aatA-flanking region variants revealed that variant 1 (IMT5155)
was more frequently observed in group B2 and D strains
and variant 2 (BL21/B_REL606) in group A and D
strains, while, although only rarely detected, the presumed episomal aatA variant 3 (APEC_O1) was linked
with group B2 strains. Further large-scale analysis will
have to rule out, whether the distribution of different
aatA-flanking variants may be influenced by the phylogenetic background of the strains or by selective forces
driven by environmental conditions, e.g. given in a certain host compartment.
The overall wide distribution of this supposed virulence associated gene in a large range of ExPEC and
commensal isolates is indicative for a horizontal transfer
of aatA. It is well established that virulence factors are
often located on mobile elements, such as plasmids or
pathogenicity islands and are thus often subjected to
horizontal gene transfer [4]. Sequence analyses of aatA
and the flanking regions revealed a potential of mobility
for the adhesin gene. In all completely sequenced E. coli
genomes, where an aatA sequence was detected, the
gene locus was enclosed by transposable elements.
Furthermore, episomally located aatA variants might be
transferred in the context of the whole plasmid, presuming the presence of functional transfer and mobility
elements.

Dai et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/236

In addition, possible sequence variations among aatA
genes of strains allocated to different phylogenetic
groups might be reflected functionally, which has for
example been shown for the genes of the fim cluster
[38]. Since aatA was retained in isolates of different
phylogenetic groups, the discrete function of the protein
in the respective strains, whether they commensally
colonize the intestine or invade other internal organs of
poultry and cause severe systemic infections, remains
unsolved to date and should be subjected to thorough
investigations in the future.
Many autotransporter adhesins are known to be relevant not only for adhesion but also for biofilm formation, invasion, aggregation and toxicity [13]. Adhesins
related to AatA, such as Hap, Ag43, AIDA and TibA,
for example, contribute to bacterial aggregation by intercellular passenger domain interactions [39]. Most trimeric autotransporter adhesins also seem to confer
serum resistance by binding to components of the complement system [40]. Although IMT5155 does not produce a biofilm under normal lab conditions, it remains
to be determined if in vivo conditions might probably
trigger this phenotype, enabling to investigate a possible
role of AatA in this process. Although Li et al. suggested that AatA is not involved in autoaggregation or
biofilm formation [17], it did not become evident
whether they tested the wild-type and mutant strain,
observing no difference, or whether the wild-type strain
APEC_O1, comparable to IMT5155, did not show these
phenotypes in general.

Conclusion
A chromosomal variant of the autotransporter adhesin
gene aatA, which has recently been described in the
plasmid pAPEC-O1-ColBM of APEC_O1 [17] was identified in APEC strain IMT5155. The gene product conferred adhesion of a fim-negative K-12 strain to DF-1
cells and its passenger domain was able to trigger
immune responses in rabbits. Prevalence studies clearly
hinted towards a special importance of this adhesin in
avian pathogenic E. coli strains, whether outbreak or socalled reservoir strains, while an essential functional role
for other animal and human ExPEC strains cannot be
inferred from the present data. Different flanking
regions as well as mobility elements indicate a high frequency of horizontal gene transfer of aatA, the driving
forces which have yet to be determined.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

For Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) we
used APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:K1:H5) [10] and human
UPEC strain CFT073 (O6:K2:H5) [41]. IMT5155 was
isolated in 2000 from the internal organs of a laying hen

Page 13 of 17

in Germany with clinical symptoms of septicemia. It has
been included in large-scale phylogenetic analysis and
was grouped into one of the most dominant lineages,
namely phylogenetic group B2 and multi locus sequence
type (ST) 140 of ST complex 95 complex [10,37,42].
Chicken infection studies using a systemic infection
model [43] showed that APEC strain IMT5155 as well
as UPEC strain CFT073 cause severe symptoms of systemic infection in 5-week-old SPF chickens and can be
isolated from all internal organs in comparable numbers
(C. Ewers, unpublished data). Non-pathogenic E. coli K12 strain was used as control strain in SSH analysis.
To determine the distribution of the putative adhesin
gene aatA among ExPEC and commensal E. coli strains,
a strain collection (n = 779) available at the Institute of
Microbiology and Epizootics, Freie Universität Berlin (n
= 691), and at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University (n = 88) was screened. The
strain set included 336 APEC, 149 UPEC, 25 newborn
meningitis-causing E. coli (NMEC), and 44 pathogenic
strains from diverse extraintestinal locations, referred to
as “other ExPEC”. The majority of ExPEC strains originated from birds (n = 336), companion animals (n =
90), and humans (n = 89). In addition, a total of 225
commensal strains from humans (n = 89), birds (n =
103), and from non-avian animal sources (n = 33) were
included.
E. coli DH5a was used for cloning procedures, BL21
(DE3)pLysS was included in protein expression analysis
[44] and the fim negative E. coli strain AAEC189 [20]
was used for adhesion assay experiments. All E. coli
strains were grown at 37°C in LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml LB), where necessary.
Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)

SSH was carried out between APEC strain IMT5155 and
UPEC strain CFT073 using Clontech PCR-Select™ Bacterial Genome Subtraction Kit (Clontech, Heidelberg,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s manual.
Briefly, genomic DNA (1.5-2.0 μg/subtraction) of
IMT5155 and CFT073 served as tester and driver DNA,
respectively. The extracted genomic DNA of tester and
driver was digested with restriction enzyme RsaI. Tester
DNA was subdivided into two portions, which were
then ligated with Adaptor 1 and Adaptor 2R, respectively, provided with the kit. After that, two hybridizations were performed. First, an excess of driver DNA
was added to each adaptor-ligated tester sample. The
samples were then heat-denatured and allowed to
anneal. During the second hybridization, the two primary hybridization samples were mixed together without denaturing. Thus, the new hybrids were doublestrand tester molecules with different ends. Freshly
denatured driver DNA was added to further enrich the

Dai et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/236

tester-specific sequences. The entire population of molecules was then subjected to PCR to amplify the desired
tester-specific sequences using the primer corresponding
to the T7 promoter sequence located in the adaptors.
Only tester-specific sequences with two different adaptors are amplified exponentially. A second PCR amplification was performed using nested primers to further
reduce any background PCR products and enrich for
tester-specific sequences. The resulting PCR products
which were assumed to represent tester-specific DNA
were cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 using the TOPO-TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Southern blot

Southern blot was performed using Roche® DIG DNA
Labelling and Detection Kit (Roche, Shanghai, China) to
prove whether the DNA fragments cloned into plasmid
pCR2.1 were present in the genome of CFT073 and
MG1655 or not. First, the genomic DNA of the strains
CFT073 and MG1655 was labelled by random primed
labelling with digoxigenin according to the manufacturers manual. PCR products of the subtractive clones
were transferred onto two identical positively charged
nylon membranes. Hybridizations were performed using
the labelled genomic DNA of the strains CFT073 and
MG1655, respectively. Chemiluminescent substrate reactions were carried out using the antidigoxigenin-AP Fab
fragments and visualized with the CSPD ready to use
(Roche, Shanghai, China).

within the aatA ORF and respective amplicon sizes are

control, while CFT073 served as a negative control for
all PCRs. To determine the genomic localization variants
of aatA homologs in different strains, oligonucleotides
aatA-FP and fecI-RP, eitD-RP and ykgN-RP were used
in PCR experiments, respectively (Additional file 1:

Genomic DNA was used as template and 0.5 μl were
added to a 25 μl reaction mixture containing the following: 0.5 μl of each primer pair in a 10 pmol concentration, 0.5 μl of a 10 mM desoxynucleoside triphosphate
mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany), 2.5 μl of 10x PCR buffer, 2 μl of 50 mM magnesium chloride and 1 unit of Taq-Polymerase
(Rapidozym GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The samples
were subjected to 25 cycles of amplification in a thermal
cycler (GeneAmp PCR system, Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany) with an annealing temperature
predicted by the respective oligonucleotides calculating
an extension time of 1 min per 1 kb. Amplification products were analysed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (Biodeal, Markkleeberg, Germany), stained with
ethidium bromide and photographed on exposure to
UV.
ECOR typing of the strain collection

Subgroups of single isolates were determined by a triplex-PCR as described previously [46].

Cosmid library

DNA sequence analysis

The cosmid library from APEC strain IMT5155 was created using the SuperCos 1 Cosmid Vector Kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) following the vendor’s
recommendations.

Sequencing of PCR fragments and cosmid clones was
performed on an ABI PRISM 377 XL DNA Sequencer
(Perkin-Elmer, Massachusetts, USA). Sequences were
analysed using online programs (BLASTN and BLASTX)
in GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. To
sequence aatA, the cosmid region of the IMT5155
library containing aatA was commercially sequenced
(LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) and obtained
sequences were analysed using the alignment tool of the
BioNumerics software (V.4.601; Applied Maths, Belgium). Promoter prediction analyses were carried out
with prediction program tools, available at http://www.
cbs.dtu.dk/services/Promoter/.

DNA extraction

Genomic DNA and cosmid DNA was isolated using
standard protocols [45]. Plasmid DNA was isolated
using the High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). PCR products were purified using the
High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit, and DNA
extraction from agarose gels was performed using the
Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Protein sequence analysis
PCR detection of aatA and flanking region variants in E.
coli

The screening for aatA in a collection of 779 E. coli
strains was performed by standard PCRs targeting three
regions of the entire gene (amplicons A, B, and C). Oligonucleotide sequences (4031 to 4036) are listed in

For phylogenetic analyses of autotransporter proteins,
ClustalW analyses were performed using http://align.
genome.jp/. Protein sequences were obtained from the
NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein.
Pylogenetic N-J trees were obtained using complete or
partial protein sequences, respectively.

Expression and purification of the putative adhesin AatA

Using oligonucleotides B11-for and B11-rev (Additional
file 1: Table S1; Figure 1), the central fragment (1,222
bp) of the putative adhesin gene was amplified by PCR
adding BamHI and XhoI recognition sites. The obtained
PCR fragment was digested with these two enzymes followed by ligation into BamHI/XhoI-digested pET32a(+)
vector (Novagen, Shanghai, China). The resulting plasmid pET32a:aatA_1222, which allows the expression of
a fusion protein controlled by an IPTG-inducible promoter was transformed into competent E. coli BL21
(DE3)pLysS cells by heat shock transformation. The
expression of AatAF was induced by adding IPTG with
a final concentration of 1 mM to the culture. Protein
purification was performed using a HisTrap HP column
(GE Healthcare, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Purified AatAF protein was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 500 ml of dialysis buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) followed by a concentration step using Amicon Ultra-4 filter (10 000-Da
cutoff; Millipore). The final protein concentration was
determined by the Bradford method using SmartSpec3000 (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China) [47]. Expression
and purity of the fusion protein was determined by
SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols [45]. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Ausubel
et al. (1996) using anti-AatA antibody (see below).
Antibody production

The anti-AatA antibody was produced in New Zealand
White rabbits as follows: 300 μg highly purified fusion
protein solved in PBS were mixed with an equal volume
of adjuvant ISA 206 (SEPPIC S.A., Puteaux, France) and
subcutaneously injected into the back of the rabbits at
seven different sites. Immunization was repeated thrice
at 2-week intervals. Ten days after the final immunization blood was collected by cardiac puncture under
terminal anaesthesia, and serum samples were prepared
and frozen at -20°C.
Quantitative real-time PCR

Overnight cultures of E. coli were diluted to an OD600 =
0.1 in fresh LB. Bacteria were grown to the logarithmic
phase (OD 600 = 0.8), harvested, and cell pellets were
resuspended in Trizol (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Total RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturer’s protocol followed by digestion of the
genomic DNA using RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega,
Mannheim, Germany). cDNA synthesis was then performed using random hexamere-primers and the
MMLV reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA aliquots corresponding to 150
ng of total RNA were semi-quantitatively analyzed using
sense (aatA RT-F) and antisense oligonucleotides (aatA

RT-R) of the target gene aatA and analyzed by real-time
PCR (Applied Biosystems StepOne) with the SYBR®
Green method. The relative gene expression of aatA
was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping
gene gyrB, which was amplified using primers 4057 and
2521 (Additional file 1: Table S1), via the ΔΔCt method.
PCR efficiency (> 90%) for each of the gene was checked
via standard dilution curves.
Immunoblot

For immunoblot experiments, overnight cultures of
E. coli were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB. The bacteria
were grown to the logarithmic phase, harvested, resuspended in protein denaturation buffer and boiled for 10
min [48]. Total protein extracts were loaded on 10%
SDS gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Shanghai,
China) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (TE77,
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a buffer containing
39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris base, 20% methanol, and
0.037% SDS. Serum raised against the passenger domain
of AatA was used as primary antibody and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin as
secondary antibody. Tetra methyl benzidine was used as
the substrate to visualize protein bands.
Adherence assay

For adhesion studies, the IMT5155 aatA ORF and the
99 bp upstream containing the putative native aatA promoter were amplified and cloned into pMD18T
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China) vector using oligonucleotides
WSH18F and WSH16R adding the restriction enzyme
recognition sites BamHI and HindIII. The obtained construct pMD18T:aatA+P was transformed into E. coli
DH5a by electroporation. Plasmids pMD18T:aatA+P
and pUC18 were digested with restriction enzymes
BamHI and HindIII and the aatA+P fragment was
ligated into pUC18. The empty vector pUC18 and plasmid construct pUC18:aatA were transformed into
AAEC189 resulting in AAEC189(pUC18) and AAEC189
(pUC18:aatA+P), respectively.
Chicken embryo fibroblast DF-1 cells were seeded
with about 1 × 105 cells per well in 24 well tissue culture trays (TPP, Shanghai, China). Cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere
and incubated for 36 h prior to adherence assays. Semiconfluent monolayers were washed and incubated with
DMEM without fetal bovine serum. E. coli strains used
for infection of the DF-1 cells were grown to logarithmic phase and harvested by centrifugation. After washing in PBS (pH 7.4), bacteria were resuspended in
DMEM without fetal bovine serum. Bacteria were then
inoculated into wells containing monolayers of DF-1

Dai et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/236

cells to a final MOI of 100. Infected monolayers were
incubated for 3 h at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere to
allow the bacteria to adhere to the cells. After 3 h incubation, the DF-1 cell layers were washed three times
with PBS. Cells were incubated with 1% Triton X-100
and bacterial cells were diluted in PBS and plated on LB
agar plates in dilution series. After incubation at 37°C
over night numbers of colonies were determined.
Results were expressed as the average number of bacteria adhering to DF-1 cells. Negative control wells containing only DF-1 cells were used in all experiments.
For adherence inhibition experiments, the purified
protein AatAF was refolded and 50 μg were added to
each well containing a DF-1 cell monolayer. As a control experiment DF-1 cells were incubated with 50 μg
bovine serum albumin (BSA) per well. After 1 h incubation at 37°C, DF-1 cell monolayers were washed with
PBS and bacterial cells of strain IMT5155 were added
with an MOI of 100. Adherence assays were done as
described above.
To analyse the effect of anti-AatA to the adherence of
IMT5155, bacteria were pre-treated with specific antiAatA antibody and pre-immume serum for 1 h at 37°C.
Pre-treated bacteria were used to infect DF-1 monolayers as described above. The assay was performed
three times in duplicates.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis for in vitro cell culture experiments
were carried out using the software SPSS (Version 17.0;
SPSS Inc., IL, USA) by carrying out the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-Test and the students t-test at the
95% significance level (p < 0.05).
Significance of associations between aatA and pathotypes, host and ECOR groups, respectively, was determined by applying a c2 test, using PASW Statistics 18
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-values p < 0.001 were
considered significant.
