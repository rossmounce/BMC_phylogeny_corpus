Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons are commonly occurring eukaryotic transposable elements
(TEs). Among these, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are the most abundant TEs and
can comprise 50–90% of the genome in higher plants. By comparing the orthologous chromosomal
regions of closely related species, the effects of TEs on the evolution of plant genomes can be
studied in detail.
Results: Here, we compared the composition and organization of TEs within five orthologous
chromosomal regions among three grass species: maize, sorghum, and rice. We identified a total
of 132 full or fragmented LTR retrotransposons in these regions. As a percentage of the total
cumulative sequence in each species, LTR retrotransposons occupy 45.1% of the maize, 21.1% of
the rice, and 3.7% of the sorghum regions. The most common elements in the maize
retrotransposon-rich regions are the copia-like retrotransposons with 39% and the gypsy-like
retrotransposons with 37%. Using the contiguous sequence of the orthologous regions, we
detected 108 retrotransposons with intact target duplication sites and both LTR termini. Here, we
show that 74% of these elements inserted into their host genome less than 1 million years ago and
that many retroelements expanded in size by the insertion of other sequences. These inserts were
predominantly other retroelements, however, several of them were also fragmented genes.
Unforeseen was the finding of intact genes embedded within LTR retrotransposons.
Conclusion: Although the abundance of retroelements between maize and rice is consistent with
their different genome sizes of 2,364 and 389 Mb respectively, the content of retrotransposons in
sorghum (790 Mb) is surprisingly low. In all three species, retrotransposition is a very recent activity
relative to their speciation. While it was known that genes re-insert into non-orthologous positions
of plant genomes, they appear to re-insert also within retrotransposons, potentially providing an
important role for retrotransposons in the evolution of gene function.

Background
Retrotransposons replicate intracellularly through reverse
transcription of their RNA and integration of the resulting

cDNA into another locus of the host genome. Two main
groups of retrotransposons are recognized: the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that have long terminal

repeats at both ends; and the non-LTR retrotransposons
that are lacking terminal repeats but contain a polyadenylate sequence at their 3' termini. LTR retrotransposons
are the most abundant components of eukaryotic
genomes. The two major classes are Ty1-copia and the Ty3gypsy elements. Both Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy elements
contain two major genes, gag and pol. These genes produce
polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved into functional peptides by an element-encoded protease. The gag
gene encodes structural proteins important for the packaging of retrotransposonal RNA, while the pol gene encodes
enzymes essential for the retrotransposon life cycle [1].
While mammalian genomes largely have the non-LTR retrotransposons, such as Alu repeats with more than 1 million copies comprising roughly 10% of the human
genome [2], plants contain mainly LTR retrotransposons.
Moreover, it appears that while mammalian genomes vary
within a narrow range in their genome sizes, plant
genomes vary extensively in part due to the differential
amplification of LTR retrotransposons in different species.
For instance, rice is about six times smaller than maize
and its content of class I elements, excluding non-LTR retrotransposons, is about 18% while in the maize genome
it represents 55% [3]. It also has been suggested that
genome size can decrease due to deletion of class I elements [4]. The ubiquity of LTR retrotransposons in plant
genomes is also illustrated by the nesting effect [5], where
a young element inserts into an older element, originally
described for the adh1 locus in maize [6].
Mobile elements have shaped both genes and entire
genomes [7]. They usually insert into intergenic regions
and are silenced to prevent additional rounds of amplification. Nevertheless, it would be simplistic to assume that
they do not play a functional role. Contrary to the previously anticipated lack of functionality of TEs, it appears
that they are indeed part of the transcriptome of different
plant species [8], which correlates well with the fact that a
subset of retroelements is hypomethylated [3]. It also has
been shown that specific retrotransposon families are
found in centromeric regions and possibly play a role in
centromere function [9]. Furthermore, TEs have been
reported to affect gene expression. Recently, Tos17, a
copia-like retrotransposon, was found to become active in
rice tissue, but silenced when plants were regenerated
[10]. Because new insertion events in regenerated plants
become heritable, they have been mapped to the genome
and found to function in gene inactivation [11].
Accumulation of completely sequenced genomes provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the contribution of TEs to gene structure and gene function. In
Caenorhabditis elegans the majority of LTR retrotransposons are located in or near genes [12]. Computational

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/62

analyses of the sequenced human genome indicate that
retrotransposon sequences are located in the coding
regions of at least 4% of the genes [13], and in the promoter regions of at least 25% of the genes [14]. In the Drosophila melanogaster genome, 2% of the genes
(approximately 300 genes) are spatially associated with
an LTR retrotransposon sequence (i.e., an LTR retrotransposon sequence is in or within 1,000 bp from a gene)
[15].
Genomic structure and gene expression can be affected by
DNA rearrangements, such as deletions or translocations,
caused by retrotransposition. Given such range of activities and rapid amplification it has been suggested to apply
a different substitution rate of 1.3 × 10-8 mutations per site
per year for plant LTR retrotransposons when compared
to plant genes [4]. Therefore, previous estimates of retrotransposon insertions will have to be re-evaluated
[5,16,17]. Furthermore, in previous studies, the analysis
of the retrotransposon content has been confined to single chromosomal regions consisting mostly of single BAC
clones [6,18-20].
To better understand how transposable elements have
influenced the evolution of chromosomal regions of common ancestry in plants we have examined the content of
TEs and their times of insertion within five chromosomal
intervals across three grass species: maize, sorghum, and
rice (Fig. 1). Each region of tetraploid maize is represented
by two homoeologous sequences depicting the wholegenome duplication (WGD) event. The orthology (common ancestry) of the studied regions was established from
the structural alignment of orthologous genes [21]. Consistent with previous reports, we found that retrotransposons contribute to an increase in genome size in all
three taxa; however, the intensity, spatiality, and directionality are considerably different among the grasses. An
unexpected finding of intact genes within LTR retrotransposons highlights the possibility of their involvement in
genomic rearrangements resulting in gene non-collinearity among related taxa.

Results
Comparisons of LTR retrotransposons in five orthologous
regions of the maize, sorghum, and rice genomes
We selected a total of 30 genomic clones covering five
chromosomal regions of common ancestry from the sorghum, rice, and maize genomes (Table 1). Each maize
chromosomal region was represented by two homoeologous sequences as the products of WGD (Fig. 1). Within
the five regions we identified a total of 132 LTR retrotransposons (Table 2). The LTR retrotransposons comprise
45.1%, 21.1%, and 3.7% of the genomic sequences of
maize, rice, and sorghum, respectively. Unlike maize that
contains LTR retrotransposons in all studied regions, the

Five orthologous regions analyzed
Five orthologous regions analyzed. Each maize region is represented by two homoeologous sequences depicting the
whole-genome duplication event. Both rice and sorghum
have one chromosomal sequence aligned. Each number on
top of the line is the chromosome number. However, the
chromosome number for sorghum is unknown. Blue, green,
and purple lines represent rice, maize, and sorghum, respectively. A more detailed annotation of these regions with
sequence coordinates have been published previously [31].

orp1/orp2, r1/b1, and tbp1/tbp2 regions of sorghum and c1/
p1, tb1/tb2 regions of rice lack LTR retrotransposons. The
number of LTR insertions per studied region is between 7
to 20 in maize, 0 to 6 in rice, and 0 to 2 in sorghum. In
contrast to rice and sorghum a total of 7 solo LTRs have
been identified in the maize regions. These solo LTRs are
the remnants of full LTRs after recombination.
The cumulative length of the five pairs of homoeologous
regions in maize is 2,554 kb, within which we identified
120 LTR retrotransposons. Therefore, on average, there is
one LTR retrotransposon every 21.3 kb of genomic
sequence. The two major classes of those are copia-like
LTR retrotransposons with 39.0% and gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons with 36.9% (Table 3). The most abundant
LTR retrotransposon families in these regions are Huck, Ji,
and Opie accounting for 24.8%, 21.5%, and 14.3%, of the
LTR retrotransposons, respectively. The average size of
intact Huck, Ji, and Opie retrotransposon is 14.7 kb, 9.4
kb, and 9.0 kb, respectively. These three LTR retrotransposons, occupying 698.7 kb, represent 27.4% of the 2,554
kb genomic sequence of maize. Similar estimates were
obtained from randomly sheared DNA end-sequences
[22]. Because the chromosomal regions analyzed in this
study were selected according to their known genetic
markers, one could expect lower retrotransposon density
than in any other genomic region. On the contrary, it
appears that retrotransposons are not clustered in any

Nested LTR retrotransposons
The first genomic regions of the maize genome that have
been sequenced contain both nested LTR retrotransposons as well as single retrotransposons [23,24]. The
same pattern extends to the maize regions studied here. In
two of the sorghum regions we identified three LTR retrotransposons, two of which were nested within the c1/pl1
region (Table 2). In rice only three of the five studied
regions contained LTR retrotransposons and none of
them appeared to be nested. This finding differs from earlier studies of other rice regions [25], indicating that
within the rice genome there are islands of various intensities of transposition activity. Out of 132 LTR retrotransposons identified in the studied regions, 36 are nested
within another LTR retrotransposon (Table 2). The maize
orp1 region contains the largest number of LTR retrotransposons and also holds a three-layer nested LTR-retrotransposon structure (Fig. 2). Apparently, these nested
structures are the primary source of gene density reduction
in chromosomal regions. Although an LTR retrotransposon can insert into another member of the same family (Ji
inserted into Ji), most insertions are heterogeneous (Opie
into Ji or Cinful into Opie). Events causing chromosomal
reduction, contemporaneous to chromosomal expansion,
are deletions of LTR retrotransposons as exemplified by
the Ji solo LTR nested in a Prem-1 element within the
maize tb2 region of chromosome 5S.
LTR-retrotransposon insertion times
Integration of an LTR retrotransposon requires duplication of the LTR sequence. Therefore, the two LTRs of an
inserted element are identical at the time of insertion. As
time passes, nucleotide substitutions cause sequence
divergence between the two LTRs. If the substitution rate
is known, then the date of insertion can be estimated from
the amount of divergence between the two LTRs [16]. In a
recent study of the rice genome, Ma and Bennetzen [4]
showed that the average level of nucleotide substitution in
intergenic regions (1.18%) is about 2-fold higher than
that of synonymous substitution in coding regions of
genes (0.58%). Therefore, we applied a substitution rate
of 1.3 × 10-8 mutations per site per year as described previously [26] and calculated the time of insertion of the
LTR retrotransposons identified within the studied segments [see Additional file 1]. Although among nested retrotransposons the insertion time of an internal LTR
retrotransposon should be younger than the recipient
one, there appeared to be a few exceptions in the maize
regions. However, when we calculated 95% confidence
intervals for the time estimates of LTR insertions using the
MEGA2 program [27], the estimates for the LTR retrotransposons that are embedded in other LTR retrotrans-

posons exhibit overlapping intervals with the recipient
elements [see Additional file 1]. Therefore, we cannot be
certain whether there are exceptions to the general pattern
of a younger LTR retrotransposon inserting to an older
LTR retrotransposon.
The orp1/2 regions contain most of the older LTR retrotransposons. Among these are the Ji-1 from the maize orp2
region (~2.5 mya), the Dagul (~3.8 mya) from rice, and
also the oldest LTR retrotransposon within the studied
segments, the Prem-1 from maize orp1 region (~4.6 mya).
The Ji-5 and Fasu from the r1 region, the Prem-1 and Ji in
the c1 region, and the Yemi in the tb1 region (all from
maize) are the most recently inserted LTR retrotransposons. All LTR retrotransposons identified within the c1/
p1 and tbp1/2 regions inserted less than 2 mya. All the LTR
retrotransposons identified in the rice and sorghum fragments inserted within the last one million years. About

Contribution of LTR retrotransposons to gene order in the
maize genome
In most cases, we found that retrotransposons were interspersed between genic sequences; however in 2 of the 10
maize regions (the orp2 and tbp1) we detected a total of 11
predicted genes or gene fragments that were embedded
within LTR retrotransposons. These accounted for 15% of
all putative genes in these regions. To further investigate
the nature of these insertions, we looked at these two
regions in more detail.

First we analyzed the orp2 region where we found one
intact and four fragmented genes nested in a Ji-3 retrotransposon (Fig. 3). To reconstruct the history of insertion
events, the nucleotide sequence of this Ji-3 retrotranspo-

son was aligned with the full-length consensus sequence
of a Ji element that was obtained from multiple sequence
alignments of all Ji elements identified in the studied
regions with additional sequences identified from database searches (see Methods). Based on this alignment, the
Ji-3 retrotransposon has a length of 7,834 nucleotides
after exclusion of inserted sequences between the target
duplication sites (TDS) and arrived at this location about
2.5 mya. The polyprotein-coding region is truncated at
position 42,907 (Fig. 3), where a complex set of sequences
of different origins is inserted. This set contains a Milt element (at position 47,971) that arrived in its location
about 0.385 mya, an Opie retrotransposon (ending at
position 114,559) that inserted 0.308 mya, and, more
importantly, it also includes five non-TE related genes of
which one is intact. With these multiple insertions the Ji3 element expanded by a total of 66,588 nucleotides.
While insertion of retrotransposons into other retrotrans-

posons is well documented from other regions of maize as
well as other plant genomes, finding an intact gene
embedded in a retroelement was unexpected. In contrary,
the only example of the insertion of non-TE related genes
into a retrotransposon are gene fragments embedded in a
huck retrotransposon within the 9002 locus of the maize
inbred line Mo17 that are unlikely to be functional [28].
Here, the intact gene found within the Ji-3 element
belongs to a group of genes known to be important for
seed development, also called the Fie2 (fertilization-independent endosperm-like) gene [29]. The four fragmented
genes embedded within the Ji-3 retrotransposon are
encoded by the opposite DNA strand compared to the
Fie2 gene and are copies of the Ve-2 gene (verticillium wilt
resistance-like) (Ve-2c, d, e, f) belonging to a group of disease resistance genes [30]. Interestingly, two intact copies
of the Ve-2 gene reside in the upstream region outside of

homologs from the rice genome uncovered a pattern of
sequence fragmentation in the maize Ve-2 genes, indicative of independent truncations of all Ve-2 maize genes
during or after their amplification. However, the lack of
sufficient overlapping sequence homologies prevented us
from performing phylogenetic analyses. The external position of two of the Ve-2 genes (Ve-2a, b) leads to the
hypothesis that the Ve-2 genes internal to the Ji-3 element

fragments in non-collinear chromosomal positions might
be a more common theme as previously suggested [28].
For the intact Fie2 gene phylogenetic analysis [21] and
expression data [29] are already available. There are two
Fie genes in the maize genome that reside in homoeologous regions on chromosome 4 and 10 [31]. The ortholo-

Genes nested in LTR retrotransposons at the orp2 locus on maize chromosome 10S
Figure 3
Genes nested in LTR retrotransposons at the orp2 locus on maize chromosome 10S. Some of the screened contigs permitted
the analysis of more complex retrotransposon blocks like the region around orange pericarp 2 (orp2) locus on maize chromosome 10S. This region contains nested as well as non-nested LTR retrotransposons. Five genes are nested within Ji-3 retrotransposon of the orp2 region. Arrows provide the polarity of genes. Genes and elements are directly labeled in the figure.
Position of insertions and truncations are given in nucleotide positions as they relate to the entire BAC sequence.

gous regions in rice and sorghum each contain a tandem
duplication of the Fie gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the
Fie genes revealed that the two maize genes represent the
two ancestral paralogs, indicating a deletion of two paralogous copies after the hybridization of the two maize progenitors [21]. Furthermore, the two tandem genes in rice
and the Fie1 gene on maize chromosome 4 do not reside
within a retrotransposon. Therefore, the Fie2 gene on the
maize chromosome 10 must have been inserted from a
close location in this genomic region into the Ji-3 element, but unlike the Ve-2 genes as intact gene. In addition, it is interesting to note the difference in expression of
the two Fie genes in maize. The Fie2 gene, nested in an LTR
retrotransposon, is expressed in the embryo sac before
pollination, while the non-nested Fie1 gene on chromosome 4 is expressed exclusively in the endosperm of developing kernels at ~6 days after pollination [29]. It is
unknown whether this difference in gene expression is
based on the regulatory elements of the LTR retrotransposon flanking the Fie2 gene, but it has been suggested that
LTR retrotransposons located in or near genes might alter

gene expression and, therefore, contribute significantly to
gene evolution [32].
The other region with a complex of predicted genes nested
within LTR retrotransposons was the tbp1 region (Fig. 4).
For further analysis, we selected the two copies of the
intact auxin-related genes. To assess their abundance
within the genome we searched the collection of maize
GSSs, representing a high proportion of the maize genic
regions, and found evidence for additional copies of these
genes in other regions of the maize genome. Because these
GSSs do not cover complete gene sequences, we only
selected the two genes within the retroelement for comparison with homologs of the fully sequenced rice
genome. Homologous genes are also found in many nonorthologous regions of the rice genome [31]. We estimated that the Huck-2 element arrived at this location
(nested in an Opie element) about 0.2 mya, while the Opie
element inserted in this region about 1.7 mya (Fig. 4).

tional file 2] revealed that the two maize genes were duplicated long before (> 50 mya) the insertion of the LTR
retrotransposons, indicating that both genes existed in different positions of the maize genome and moved to this
location recently.

Discussion
Contribution of LTR retrotransposons to plant genome
evolution
Rice diverged from maize and sorghum about 50 mya [33]
and sorghum diverged from maize about 12 mya [21].
After speciation, regions descending from ancestral chromosomes largely stayed intact for a long time as exemplified by retention of collinearity among these taxa [31].
Our results indicate that all three genomes independently
experienced relatively recent LTR activity and their intensities varied among the different grass species. Compared
to maize, rice has a relatively small genome with about
389 Mb. Although we did not find solo LTR retrotransposons in our studied rice regions, it has been reported
that out of 1,219 LTR retrotransposons, 822 appeared to
be fragmented elements [34]. The high rate of LTR retrotransposon deletions in rice may be one of the reasons
that some rice regions may appear to have fewer nested
LTR retrotransposons than the maize genome. Recently, it
has also been suggested that the size of the rice genome

decreased due to the higher proportion of solo LTRs versus intact retrotransposons [34]. The contraction coupled
with the lack of expansion due to the lack of nesting could
explain the differential retrotransposon density between
maize and rice. Therefore, genome size differences in
plants result from several mechanisms. If low density of
retrotransposons in the orthologous regions of sorghum
holds up on a genome-wide level, other mechanisms for
the expansion of sorghum versus rice might still be uncovered. One interesting feature of retroelements is that they
provide sites for additional insertions, which could have
accelerated the expansion of the maize genome relative to
rice.
Association of LTR retrotransposons and functional genes
Given the abundance of retrotransposition events, the
question arose as to how they might influence the expression of genes. Indeed, retrotransposons are involved in
generating mutations through insertions near or within
genes and affect their expression, usually in a negative
fashion by decreasing or abolishing transcription of a
gene or by detrimental alterations in transcript processing
and/or stability. Retrotransposons inserted in or near
plant genes have been reported in maize, rice, lettuce,
wheat, tomato, tobacco, potato, and bell pepper [5]. Here,
we have found that the predicted gene RNAP II in the

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:62

maize orp1 region is only 415 bp away from the Milt-1 retrotransposon. Similarly to plant genomes retrotransposons seem to be important modulators of animal
genomes as well. Approximately 2% of the genes (~300
genes) in the Drosophila melanogaster genome are associated with an LTR retrotransposon sequence [15]. In
another case, the gene Peg10 is critical for mouse parthenogenetic development and provides the first direct evidence of an essential role of an evolutionarily conserved
retrotransposon-derived gene in mammalian development [35].
Gene movement within the maize genome
While numerous studies showed that LTR retrotransposons could arrive near or within genes, our finding of
intact genes located inside LTR retrotransposons was
unanticipated. Previous comparative studies already
showed that non-collinear genes have moved to other
locations within the same genome [31]. One of the possible mechanisms of gene movement appears to be based
on the action of helitrons [36,37]. In such a case it is
hypothesized that the replication of a sequence containing a gene is initiated by the action of a helicase similarly
to the initiation of replication of single-stranded bacteriophage. This mode of replication is also referred to as rolling circle (RC) replication because the product is a singlestranded circular DNA. As a consequence one can expect
that the donor site would stay intact and the extrachromosomal circular DNA gets integrated at another site by illegitimate recombination. However so far, helitron
sequences appear to contain only gene fragments and not
intact genes [37]. In case of the Fie2 gene, there is no
donor site present in the rest of the genome. We have
searched maize inbred lines for a haplotype progenitor
that would contain a putative donor site for the Fie2 gene.
However, when we compared about 40 different inbred
lines, there was no line where the Fie2 gene site differed
from inbred B73 (data not shown). Since a previous analysis of haplotype variability of the z1C1 locus suggested
four major haplotypes among the core inbred lines, we
would have expected that, if it exists, we would have
found a second haplotype of the fie2 locus among the
inbreds analyzed. Although we cannot be certain if the
original site of the Fie2 gene was deleted after it moved
into the retrotransposon or if the gene was excised and
then re-inserted into the retrotransposon, its translocation
mechanism appears to differ from the examples of helitron-based gene movements. Even with the retention of
sequences at a donor site that contain genes, new gene
copies do not have to arise from an RC-based amplification. For instance, gene insertions of copies of storage protein genes occurred during the last 5 million years in six
different locations of the maize genome, relative to the
rice genome by a mechanism that differs from helitrons
[38]. Disease resistance genes are another example of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/62

recent insertions of gene copies into new chromosomal
positions [39,40]. Whatever the mechanism for copying
or excising genes might be, insertion into the genome
requires a chromosome break. Perhaps retroelements are
more prone to chromosome breakage, which would be
consistent with the apparent layers of nested retroelements. Therefore, it would be conceivable that besides layered retroelements other sequences could insert within
retroelements by illegitimate recombination.
Here we present a few interesting examples of intact genes
inserted into an LTR retrotransposon, one of which is the
Fie2 gene in the maize orp2 region (Fig. 2). Based on the
conserved alignment of the tandem genes in the orthologous segments of sorghum and rice, and on the phylogenetic analysis showing that the two maize Fie genes
represent the ancestral paralogs, we can conclude that the
maize Fie2 gene itself or a copy of it must have translocated from its original orthologous position and ultimately arrived within the Ji-3 retrotransposon.
Furthermore, the Fie2 gene is expressed in a specific pattern that differs from the Fie1 gene on the other homoeologous chromosomal region of maize. The duplication of
the two Fie genes resulting from WGD in the progenitor of
maize possibly led to four gene copies that were disadvantageous. It appears that a large percentage of duplicated
genes in the maize genome lost their second copy [3]. The
WGD possibly increased transposition and chromosomal
breakages leading to the relocation of genes. The final
positioning of the Fie2 gene within the LTR retrotransposon might have been advantageous in affecting the differential expression of the Fie2. Interesting is that the
movement of the Fie2 gene has likely occurred over a very
short distance on the same chromosome because it is
located very close to its orthologous position.
Another possibility for the embedded genes is that processed gene transcripts of the embedded genes were copackaged into the viral particles allowing the integration
of the gene sequence into the body of the element by
jumping templates via reverse transcription during the
replicative process. This is less likely the case for short distance movement because integration of the composite element is likely to occur at an unlinked location. However,
the second example described here, the auxin-related
genes on chromosome 1 could have been derived from
such a mechanism. If processed transcripts were co-packaged into viral particles, one would expect that those
genes would be intronless. While the Fie2 gene on chromosome 10 contains its introns, the auxin-related genes
on chromosome 1 do not have introns.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we are providing here a new feature of how
LTR retrotransposons are not merely parasitic in nature

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:62

but have adapted to be elements in the genome that can
rapidly rearrange the organization and possibly affect regulation of genes in response to the "challenge", as proposed by McClintock in 1984 [41]. As we show in this
study, LTR retrotransposons contain intact gene copies
that are much older than the time of the retroelement
insertion within a genomic region. Such genes must have
existed in another location of the genome prior to the LTR
insertion. The sequences containing these genes were
either copied or deleted from their original (orthologous)
positions and then inserted into retroelements. Because
retroelements do not excise from their position, but are
copied and inserted into new genomic positions, they also
could potentially place acquired gene copies throughout
the genome, causing a disruption in gene order after speciation of ancestral chromosomes. If this were to be the
case, one would expect that genes carried by retrotransposition would loose their introns from reverse transcription
of processed transcripts as suggested for the auxin-related
genes in tbp1 region of maize chromosome 1L. Therefore,
it is possible that the frequent gene movements in grass
genomes reported recently [31] could be explained in part
by such a mechanism. This would resemble the proposed
movement of gene fragments by mutator-related DNA
transposable elements [42]. Furthermore, the short
lifespan of LTR retrotransposons might explain why many
sequences containing non-collinear genes might have lost
the sequence motifs associated with retroelements from
their flanking regions. In addition, nesting of genes in LTR
retrotransposons might also result in the differentiation of
the expression of duplicated genes. These findings support
further studies to uncover the full extent of the effect of
retrotransposons on the structural and functional evolution of genes and genomes.

Methods
BAC sequencing
We chose 18 maize BAC sequences from inbred line B73
and 6 sorghum BAC sequences from Sorghum bicolor cv.
Btx623 [21]. We used maize genetic markers to identify
orthologous clones from the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv.
Nipponbare genome [31]. A data set comprising genomic
sequences of five chromosomal segments from two
homoeologous regions of the maize genome (resulting
from WGD), one from sorghum and one from rice, have
been previously aligned based on collinear genetic markers (Fig. 1). The data set consists of 2,554 kb of maize, 681
kb of sorghum, and 798 kb of rice compound sequences.
The detailed information and accession numbers are
listed in Table 1. The two previous reports have focused
on the gene content of those regions. Here, we are using
the same data set to examine the entire content of retrotransposable elements.

LTR retrotransposon searches
LTR retrotransposons in plants are characterized by long
terminal repeats (LTRs) that vary in size from a few hundred base pairs to several kilobases, and are generally terminated by the dinucleotides 5'-TG...CA-3' [5].

Step 1: Database mining – BAC sequences (Table 1) were
searched against the nucleotide database of National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the repeat
database that was recently established from all maize
genomic sequences [3], and The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR) repeat database, which also includes
repetitive sequences from other plant species [43] using
BLAST [44]. The cut-off values of e-20 or less were used to
select putative LTR retrotransposons. After comparing
these three different blast results, we assembled a comprehensive list of LTR retrotransposons from all chromosomal regions.
Step 2: LTR searching – LTR_STRUC software was used to
search the BAC sequences for full length and intact LTR
retrotransposons [45]. The algorithm of LTR_STRUC program is based on important structural features, such as primary-binding site (PBS), polypurine tract (PPT), and the
presence of canonical dinucleotides at the ends of each
LTR (typically TG and CA).
Step 3: LTR matching – We extracted a collection of both
5' and 3' LTRs and used them as queries to search against
original BAC sequences by using BLAST 2 Sequences [46].
We carefully checked the search results and sorted out all
the possible LTR retrotransposons according to the estimated sizes of different types of LTR retrotransposons [22]
for further sequence alignment. We also evaluated the
structural characteristics of LTR retrotransposons, such as
the presence of gag and pol genes.
Step 4: Sequence alignment – First we aligned all LTRs of
the same class using ClustalX [47] and then performed
phylogenetic clustering through maximum parsimony
and maximum likelihood analyses using PAUP* 4.0b10
[48] to identify the probable paired LTRs. The paired LTRs
were aligned again to recheck their accuracy. In addition,
when pairs of LTRs were identified, internal structural
characteristics such as PBS and PPT were examined.
LTR retrotransposon insertion dates
Both LTRs of each identified LTR retrotransposon were
aligned using ClustalX [47]. The distance estimations
between pairs of LTR retrotransposons and their standard
errors were based on the Kimura two-parameter (K2P)
model as implemented in the MEGA-2 program [27].
Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the mean
distance and the SE as estimated from K2P and thus they
are symmetrical. In calculations of insertion times of LTR

retrotransposons we used a mutational rate for intergenic
regions of 1.3 × 10-8 substitutions/site/year as described
recently [26].

Estimation of the time of gene duplication
For genes of interest, gene homologs from the rice and
Arabidopsis thaliana genomes were identified by homology
searches using BLAST [44]. Alignment of coding
sequences performed by ClustalX [47] was visually
reviewed. Phylogenetic analyses, including parsimony
and maximum likelihood methods, were performed using
PAUP* 4.0b10 [48]. To estimate the relative time of gene
duplication we assumed that rice and maize diverged
about 50 mya [49].
