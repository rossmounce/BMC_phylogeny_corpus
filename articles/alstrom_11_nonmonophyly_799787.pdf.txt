Non-monophyly and intricate morphological
evolution within the avian family Cettiidae
revealed by multilocus analysis of a taxonomically
densely sampled dataset

Abstract
Background: The avian family Cettiidae, including the genera Cettia, Urosphena, Tesia, Abroscopus and Tickellia and
Orthotomus cucullatus, has recently been proposed based on analysis of a small number of loci and species. The
close relationship of most of these taxa was unexpected, and called for a comprehensive study based on multiple
loci and dense taxon sampling. In the present study, we infer the relationships of all except one of the species in
this family using one mitochondrial and three nuclear loci. We use traditional gene tree methods (Bayesian
inference, maximum likelihood bootstrapping, parsimony bootstrapping), as well as a recently developed Bayesian
species tree approach (*BEAST) that accounts for lineage sorting processes that might produce discordance
between gene trees. We also analyse mitochondrial DNA for a larger sample, comprising multiple individuals and a
large number of subspecies of polytypic species.
Results: There are many topological incongruences among the single-locus trees, although none of these is
strongly supported. The multi-locus tree inferred using concatenated sequences and the species tree agree well
with each other, and are overall well resolved and well supported by the data. The main discrepancy between
these trees concerns the most basal split. Both methods infer the genus Cettia to be highly non-monophyletic, as
it is scattered across the entire family tree. Deep intraspecific divergences are revealed, and one or two species and
one subspecies are inferred to be non-monophyletic (differences between methods).
Conclusions: The molecular phylogeny presented here is strongly inconsistent with the traditional, morphologybased classification. The remarkably high degree of non-monophyly in the genus Cettia is likely to be one of
the most extraordinary examples of misconceived relationships in an avian genus. The phylogeny suggests
instances of parallel evolution, as well as highly unequal rates of morphological divergence in different lineages.
This complex morphological evolution apparently misled earlier taxonomists. These results underscore the wellknown but still often neglected problem of basing classifications on overall morphological similarity. Based on
the molecular data, a revised taxonomy is proposed. Although the traditional and species tree methods inferred
much the same tree in the present study, the assumption by species tree methods that all species are
monophyletic is a limitation in these methods, as some currently recognized species might have more complex
histories.

Background
In a study of large-scale relationships within the avian
superfamily Sylvioidea, Alström et al. [1] found, based
on mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear myoglobin
intron 2 sequence data, that two species of Cettia and
one species each of Urosphena, Tesia, Abroscopus and
Tickellia, and Orthotomus cucullatus formed a clade,
well separated from a broad selection of other passerines. They proposed the family name Cettiidae for this
group. This clade (limited to one species each of Cettia,
Abroscopus and Tickellia) was corroborated by Johansson et al. [2] based on myoglobin, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and ß-fibrinogen introns. Irestedt et al. [3]
concluded, based on all of the previously used loci, but
with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase
(GAPDH) intron instead of ß-fibrinogen, that Hemitesia
was also part of this clade. Two of the above studies
[1,3] indicated that the genus Cettia is non-monophyletic. Most of these findings were entirely unexpected
based on the traditional, morphology-based classification, although Cettia and Urosphena have long been
considered closely related, and some species have been
moved back and forth between these genera (cf. e.g.
[4-12]).
Altogether, nearly 95 taxa are recognised in Cettiidae,
separated into 25-29 species [7,9,12,13]. Two of the species have been described in the last 25 years, namely
Cettia carolinae Rozendaal, 1987 [14] and Cettia haddeni LeCroy and Barker, 2006 [15]. The genus Cettia
has often been divided into subgenera, although there
has been poor agreement between authors regarding the
inclusiveness of these subgenera (e.g. [4,7]). As has
already been indicated above, the generic allocation of
some taxa has varied over time. At the species level, the
taxonomy of several taxa has been disputed. Cettia
diphone has variously been treated as a single species, or
split into C. diphone sensu stricto and C. canturians,
generally without providing any justification for either
standpoint (cf. [4-7,9-13,16]). Furthermore, Cettia seebohmi has often been treated as a subspecies of C.
diphone sensu lato (e.g. [4,7,11]), although some authors
considered C. seebohmi to be a separate species, based
on unpublished differences in song and lack of the pronounced sexual size dimorphism of C. diphone/C. canturians [5,10,12]. The latter position was later supported
based on vocalizations and mitochondrial DNA [17].
Alström et al. [18] suggested, based on a study of morphology, vocalizations and mitochondrial DNA, that
Cettia acanthizoides was better treated as two species,
C. acanthizoides sensu stricto and C. brunnescens. Olsson et al. [19] proposed, based on analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, that some of the subspecies of
Cettia flavolivacea be moved to C. vulcania. Bairlein et

Page 2 of 16

al. [13] treated Orthotomus cucullatus heterolaemus as a
distinct species.
The species in the genera Cettia and Urosphena are
nondescript, brown above and paler below, usually with
a brownish, greyish or yellowish wash to the underparts,
and have medium-length (Cettia) or short (Urosphena)
tails (e.g. [13,16]). The various species of Cettia are generally more easily separable by voice than by external
features [13,16]. Oligura, Hemitesia and Tesia are extremely short-tailed, and the two former and one of the
Tesia species are comparatively colourful, with green
and yellow colours [13,16]. Abroscopus, Tickellia and
Orthotomus cucullatus are even more brightly coloured,
with green, yellow and often bright rufous hues, and
have medium-length tails [13]. All species in Cettiidae
are sexually monomorphic, although some Cettia show
pronounced sexual size dimorphism, and in most species juveniles resemble adults [13,16]. All Cettiidae have
10 rectrices (or eight, in the extremely short-tailed
Tesia), unlike nearly all other passerines, which have 12
[1,3]. Illustrations of representatives of the different
“morphotypes” are shown in the last figure in the paper.
Most species in Cettiidae occur in southern and eastern
Asia, but Hemitesia is restricted to the Albertine Rift in
East Africa, one Cettia extends its range to Europe and
North Africa, and several species occur on Pacific islands.
The majority are either sedentary or altitudinal migrants,
but the most northerly breeding species are medium-distance migrants. Most species inhabit bushy areas, bamboo or forest undergrowth in mountains and foothills,
although a few Cettia breed to above the tree limit or
close to sea-level. All are insectivorous. [13,16]
The results of some recent studies [1-3] emphasize the
need for a comprehensive analysis of Cettiidae based on
a denser taxon sampling and multiple loci. In the present study, we infer the relationships of all except one
of the species in the family using one mitochondrial
gene and three nuclear introns (only mitochondrial data
for three species). We use traditional gene tree methods
(Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood bootstrapping,
parsimony bootstrapping), as well as a recently developed Bayesian species tree approach (*BEAST; [20]) that
accounts for lineage sorting processes that might produce discordance between gene trees. We also analyse
mitochondrial DNA for a larger sample, comprising
multiple individuals and a large number of subspecies of
polytypic species. A revised classification is proposed
based on our results.

bp of cytb. No unexpected stop codons, indels or distinct double peaks in the chromatograms that would
indicate the presence of nuclear pseudogenes were
found in the coding cytb sequences. The aligned ODC
sequences comprised 732 characters, of which 173
(24%) were parsimony-informative; myo 727 characters,
120 (16.5%) parsimony-informative; GAPDH 386 characters, 86 (22%) parsimony-informative; and cytb including all sequences 1078 characters, 391 (36%) parsimonyinformative. The complete dataset contained 2923 characters, of which 769 (26%) were parsimony-informative.
Model selection

In the analysis using MrBayes we selected models a
priori. For the *BEAST analysis we used the same
selected models and additionally a variety of models
which are *BEAST-specific, such as the relaxed clock
model. To establish how well each model fit the data,
we calculated Bayes Factors (BF; [21,22]) using the harmonic mean as an approximation of the marginal likelihood of a model. The results from the BF analyses are
given in Table 1 and Table 2. According to these comparisons, the partitioned MrBayes analysis of the concatenated data has a significantly higher marginal
likelihood than the unpartitioned analysis of the same
data. In all pairwise comparisons of the *BEAST analyses, the relaxed clock models scored higher than the
strict clock models (all else being equal), showing evidence under all substitution models of violation of a
strict molecular clock. The *BEAST analysis with the
highest likelihood according to the BF comparison was
the model in which all subspecies of a species were predefined as belonging to the same species, all loci had
independent substitution models, and a relaxed clock
prior was applied ("jModelTest relaxed”). Of the
*BEAST analyses in which the individuals classified as
the same subspecies were grouped a priori but were not
predefined as belonging to the same species, the analysis
with the locus-specific models and a relaxed clock prior
("Subspecies jModelTest relaxed”) had the highest BF,
although it was not strongly different from the analysis
with a strict clock.

Although there is much incongruence among the trees,
no conflicting nodes are strongly supported.
The partitioned, mixed-model MrBayes analysis of the
concatenated data including all sequences is shown in
Figure 1, and a tree including a smaller number of subspecies/individuals, with the results from single-locus
analyses indicated, is shown in Figure 2. Two main
clades (A and B) are inferred, although clade A is not
unanimously strongly supported (PP 1.00, ML 77%, MP
51%). Clade A contains 12 of the 16 species of Cettia
(clade E), the monotypic genus Tickellia, Orthotomus
cucullatus and the three species of Abroscopus. Clade B
comprises the remaining four species of Cettia, the four
species of Tesia, the two species of Urosphena and the
monotypic genera Oligura and Hemitesia. In clade A, all
four genera are monophyletic, with Cettia (clade E)
being divided into a mostly continental Asian clade (H)
and a mainly Pacific islands clade (I). Clade B is split
into two main clades, one (F) comprising three species
of Cettia, Oligura and Tesia, and the other (G) containing one species of Cettia, Urosphena and Hemitesia.
C. vulcania and C. diphone are suggested to be nonmonophyletic, although the support for this is weak.
Moreover, the monophyly of C. flavolivacea is poorly
supported, and one of its subspecies, intricata, is
inferred to be non-monophyletic. Monophyly is unsupported for a few subspecies of some other species. Deep
intraspecific divergences are revealed within C. flavolivacea, C. fortipes and C. cetti.
The topology of the tree estimated from the unpartitioned, single-model data differs in several minor aspects
from the one in Figure 1 (Additional file 5), although no
incongruence has PP ≥ 0.95 in both analyses. Likewise,
the tree resulting from the partitioned, mixed-model
analysis containing only taxa for which all loci are available (Additional file 6) differs slightly from the tree in
Figure 1. Notably, in the absence of the three Pacific
islands species for which only cytb is available (highlighted in red in Figure 1), Cettia carolinae and C.
parens form a strongly supported clade (PP 1.00), as do
Cettia diphone borealis and C. seebohmi (PP 1.00).
*BEAST analyses

MrBayes analyses

The single-locus analyses resulted in variously well
resolved and well supported trees (cytb most resolved,
GAPDH least resolved; Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4).

The tree based on the “Subspecies jModelTest relaxed”
model is shown in Figure 3. Although this is slightly
inferior to the “jModelTest relaxed” tree according to
the BF analysis (Table 2), there are no topological conflicts with PP ≥ 0.95 in both trees. Furthermore, the former tree contains more information, as the subspecies
are shown. The differences between these two trees are
indicated in Figure 3. The tree resulting from the analysis containing only taxa for which all loci are available
("Full jModelTest relaxed"; Additional file 7) is identical
to the tree in Figure 3 with respect to relationships

Calculated for *BEAST analyses under different models. “GTR” refers to analyses where cytb was analysed under the GTR+Γ+I model and the other sequences
under the HKY model; “jModelTest” refers to analyses under the models selected by jModelTest; “strict” refers to a strict molecular clock; and “relaxed” refers to
an uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock. All analyses included all available sequences, i.e. also individuals for which only cytb was available.

(except for the excluded species), although relative
branch lengths and some support values vary (latter
both higher and lower).
The topology of the *BEAST tree agrees well with the
MrBayes tree, with two exceptions: (1) *BEAST does not
infer the basal split between clades A and B, and instead
identifies clade F as sister to clade A, although with low
statistical support. This is the case in all *BEAST analyses
with a relaxed clock model, whereas all *BEAST analyses
using a strict clock model recover clade B, although with
rather low support (PP mean 0.80 ± 0.06; not shown). (2)
Both C. flavolivacea and C. vulcania are monophyletic.
Indels

Several indels in the nuclear introns support certain
clades (Figure 1). It is also noteworthy that some indels
are homoplasious (as remarked in footnotes). Interestingly, this concerns a deletion of eight base pairs in the
GAPDH alignment, which is found in clade J and also
in Cettia cetti and C. fortipes fortipes from west Myanmar (indicated by 2 in Figure 1), and a deletion of four
base pairs in the ODC alignment in both clade H and
Tickellia hodgsoni (indicated by 3 in Figure 1).

Discussion
Model selection and comparison of methods

With respect to the MrBayes analyses including all
sequences, Bayes Factors strongly favour the partitioned,
mixed-model analysis over the unpartitioned, singlemodel analysis. It could be argued that mixed-model
analyses are inherently superior to single-model analyses
of concatenated data (e.g. [23,24]), especially in cases
where different loci have markedly different phylogenetic signal. In the present study, the mitochondrial cytb

is considerably more informative than the three nuclear
loci, and in the single-model analysis of the concatenated data cytb obviously influences the topology more
than the nuclear loci (cf. e.g. the C. flavolivacea-C. vulcania and C. fortipes clades in Figures 1 and 2 and
Additional File 2). In contrast, the partitioned, mixedmodel analysis produces a more balanced estimate of
the relationships.
As concatenation has been shown in simulations to be
statistically inconsistent and to positively select the
wrong species tree under certain circumstances (e.g.
[25-28]), species tree approaches, such as *BEAST,
might be expected to provide a better estimate of the
phylogeny of Cettiidae than concatenation. The superiority of *BEAST over concatenation in estimating the
species tree topology has been demonstrated using
simulated data [20]. However, in the present study there
are no strongly supported incongruences between different single-locus analyses and, as expected, good agreement exists between the trees reconstructed via the
species tree approach and concatenation. The conflicts
between the topology estimates of the concatenated
MrBayes analysis and the *BEAST are restricted to
nearby branches. We could not detect any signs of the
latter method receiving additional signal from the likelihood function of gene trees given a species tree (cf.
[27,29-32]). It should be noted, however, that nearly half
the species in the present study include only one individual, thereby not taking full advantage of the multispecies coalescent model of *BEAST.
Interspecific relationships

The extremely high degree of non-monophyly in the
genus Cettia suggested by our data is strongly

Figure 1 Tree of Cettiidae based on concatenated sequences - all taxa, partitioned analysis. Majority rule (50%) consensus tree, based on
concatenated nuclear ODC, myoglobin and GAPDH and mitochondrial cytochrome b, inferred by Bayesian inference (BI), analysed in four
partitions. All available sequences (including all subspecies) were included. Generic affinity according to traditional taxonomy [12] is indicated by
different colour shadings. Labelled bars denote clades discussed in text. The three species for which only cytochrome b is available are in red.
Posterior probabilities, and maximum likelihood (ML) and parsimony (MP) bootstrap values are indicated at the nodes, in this order; an asterisk
represents posterior probability (PP) 1.00 or bootstrap 100%, and nodes with PP < 0.95 and/or conflicts between BI, ML and MP are in grey. The
outgroups (Alauda arvensis and Mirafra javanica in Alaudidae and Orthotomus sepium, O. sutorius and Prinia familiaris in Cisticolidae) have been
pruned from the tree. Numbers on internal branches refer to indels. 1Also in Cettia cetti and C. fortipes fortipes W Myanmar. 2Same position as
number 4. 3Also in Tickellia hodgsoni. 4Also in Cettia major. 5According to MP, C. vulcania vulcania and C. vulcania oreophila form a trichotomy
with C. flavolivacea intricata Sichuan/C. flavolivacea oblita (54%), and these are sisters to C. vulcania flaviventris (98%). 6According to MP, C. fortipes
pallida is sister to the other C. fortipes subspecies (74%). According to ML, C. fortipes davidiana Vietnam and C. fortipes robustipes are sisters (62%),
and these are sisters to C. fortipes davidiana Sichuan/Hong Kong (65%); according to MP, these relationships receive 71% and 100% support,
respectively.

Figure 3 Phylogeny of Cettiidae based on species tree analysis. Majority rule (50%) consensus tree, based on nuclear ODC, myoglobin and
GAPDH and mitochondrial cytochrome b, inferred by *BEAST. All available sequences were included; individuals traditionally classified as the
same subspecies were grouped a priori, but were not predefined as belonging to the same species; all loci had independent substitution
models; and a relaxed clock prior was applied ("Subspecies jModelTest relaxed”). Generic affinity according to traditional taxonomy [12] is
indicated by different colour shadings. Labelled bars denote clades discussed in text. The three species for which only cytochrome b is available
are in red. Values in parentheses after names are the number of individuals included. Posterior probabilities (PPs) are indicated at the nodes; *
means PP 1.00; PPs < 0.95 are in grey font; PPs in parentheses are from an analysis where subspecies of a species were predefined as being
conspecific, all else being equal ("jModelTest relaxed”), when PPs deviate by > 0.10.

supported. This level of non-monophyly was completely
unexpected, and is likely to be one of the most remarkable examples of misinterpreted relationships in an
avian genus.
Overall, the tree is well supported. However, the relationships among the most basal nodes are somewhat
uncertain. The split into clades A and B is not strongly
supported in all of the analyses. The inclusion of

Abroscopus (clade D) in clade A is strongly supported in
all Bayesian analyses, but less well supported in the ML
and unsupported in the MP bootstraps, and is only
inferred by one of the single-locus analyses (ODC). The
somewhat ambiguous results, in combination with the
aberrant morphology of the species in Abroscopus compared to the other taxa in Cettiidae (cf. [13] and Figure
4), suggest that more data are needed to corroborate

Alström et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:352
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/352

clade A. Clade B is well supported by the concatenation
analyses (except for modest MP bootstrap support, 67%)
and is inferred by three single-locus analyses (one with
PP ≥ 0.95). However, it is not recovered in most of the
species tree analyses, although support for the alternative
topologies is poor. More data are needed to evaluate this.
The inclusion of Orthotomus cucullatus and the
monotypic genus Tickellia in clade C is unexpected
from a morphological point of view (cf. [13] and Figure
4). However, this is strongly supported in all analyses,
including three single-locus analyses as well as by two
apparently synapomorphic deletions, one in the ODC
and one in the GAPDH alignments.
Clades H and I are strongly supported in the species
tree and concatenation analyses; clade H is inferred,
with strong support, in two and clade I in one of the
single-locus analyses. Within clade H, the relative positions of clades J-L are uncertain, as both the topology
and support vary among the analyses (cf. Figures 1, 2
and 3).
Clade M has very low PP in both the species tree and
concatenation analyses including all taxa (0.52 and 0.85,
respectively), and low bootstrap support. However, for
three of the five species in this clade, only cytb is available. In contrast, in analyses comprising only species for
which all loci are available, C. carolinae and C. parens
form a clade with PP 0.82 in *BEAST and 1.00 in
MrBayes. A close relationship between C. parens and C.
ruficapilla has previously been assumed based on morphological similarity, and these two have been placed in
their own genus, Vitia, whereas C. annae has been
placed in the monotypic genus Psamathia (e.g. [4]).
Orenstein & Pratt [33] concluded, based on song and
morphological characteristics, that these three species
were closely related to C. diphone (including C. seebohmi, which was at the time considered conspecific
with C. diphone; C. carolinae and C. haddeni had not
yet been described). Using cytb sequence data for a
small number of Cettia and one Urosphena species,
LeCroy and Barker [15] inferred a close relationship
among C. haddeni, C. ruficapilla, C. parens and C.
annae (C. carolinae was not included). Clade M makes
sense also from a biogeographical perspective, as the
species in this clade, together with C. seebohmi, are the
only members of Cettiidae occurring on southwest Pacific islands [13,16]. This has been suggested previously
[[15,33]; latter excluding the two species not described
at the time]. Also in agreement with the distributional
pattern, the three easternmost species, C. haddeni, C.
parens and C. ruficapilla, form a clade (PP 0.95 in
MrBayes and 0.72 in *BEAST), although the relationships among these are uncertain.
Clades F and G are well supported in species tree and
concatenation analyses. The relationships within clade G

Page 8 of 16

are robust, although within clade F they are highly
uncertain, except for the sister relationships between
Oligura castaneocoronata and Cettia brunnifrons and
between Tesia everetti and T. superciliaris, which are
both well supported. Irestedt et al. [3] found the monotypic genus Hemitesia to be sister to Urosphena squameiceps, although they did not include Cettia pallidipes
in their analysis. The only missing species in Cettiidae,
Urosphena subulata, is most likely to be closely related
to the two other Urosphena, which it closely resembles
in morphology and vocalizations [8,13,16].
Intraspecific relationships

Olsson et al. [19] concluded, based on congruence of
cytb and myoglobin gene trees, that Cettia vulcania is
nested within C. flavolivacea. This is contradicted by
the present study, which comprises a larger number of
loci and samples (including all of the samples from Olsson et al. [19]). In contrast to the previous study, C. flavolivacea is here inferred to be monophyletic in both
the *BEAST and MrBayes analyses, whereas C. vulcania
is non-monophyletic in the MrBayes tree. However,
neither of these relationships is strongly supported by
the data. Moreover, all eight samples of C. flavolivacea
have a three base pairs deletion in the ODC alignment
that is not shared with any other taxon, further supporting the monophyly of C. flavolivacea. In contrast, the
parsimony bootstrap strongly supports the non-monophyly of C. flavolivacea found by Olsson et al. [19]. This
is in agreement with, and presumably heavily influenced
by, the cytb data.
The MrBayes tree infers deep divergences between
two main C. flavolivacea clades. In this tree, as well as
in the cytb tree, Sichuan and Yunnan intricata are in
different, rather deeply divergent clades, the former
together with Vietnamese oblita and the latter with
Himalayan flavolivacea and west Myanmar weberi. In
contrast, the *BEAST tree infers only marginal differences between the four C. flavolivacea subspecies. The
monophyly of C. flavolivacea intricata in the *BEAST
phylogeny is illusory, as this taxon was constrained to
be monophyletic in this analysis, as *BEAST requires all
predefined taxa to be monophyletic. This is a limitation
and drawback of *BEAST (as it is also for two other
multispecies coalescent methods, BEST and STEM, as
remarked by Leaché & Rannala [34]). A promising solution to the problem of specifying species delimitation a
priori has recently been suggested [35]. The single-locus
nuclear trees offer no solution, as they are poorly
resolved/supported. In conclusion, more data, including
unsampled subspecies, are needed to resolve the relationships in the C. flavolivacea-C. vulcania complex.
With respect to Cettia fortipes, the trees resulting
from the *BEAST and concatenation analyses differ

markedly from the cytb tree. The parsimony bootstrap
of the concatenated data supports the same topology as
the cytb tree, presumably heavily influenced by the cytb
data. Single-locus analyses of the nuclear loci are inconclusive. More data are needed to resolve these
relationships.
In the multilocus and cytb trees, Cettia diphone is
separated into two divergent clades, one comprising the
Japanese subspecies cantans and Chinese canturians (N)
and the other representing the northern subspecies borealis (O). In both multilocus BI trees including all taxa,
borealis is sister to C. seebohmi, although with low support. In the MrBayes analysis excluding the three species
for which only cytb is available, this relationship receives
PP 1.00 (no comparable *BEAST analysis was performed). This topology is not supported in the ML and
MP bootstrap analyses. More data are required, including sequences of the missing subspecies.
The samples of Cettia cetti are separated into two
rather divergent, well-supported clades, representing
western and eastern populations, respectively.
Unexpected relationships due to complex morphological
evolution

Cettiidae comprises a mixture of taxa that had not been
considered closely related before the advent of DNA
sequence analyses. Alström et al. [1] showed, based on
cytb and myoglobin sequence data, that two species of
Cettia, and one species each of Urosphena, Tesia, Abroscopus and Tickellia and Orthotomus cucullatus formed a
clade, well separated from a broad selection of other
passerines. Hemitesia was later shown to be part of this
clade [3]. Morphological support of this unexpected
group was provided by the fact that all of these taxa
have 10 rectrices (eight in the extremely short-tailed
Tesia), in contrast to 12 in most other passerine birds
[1,3]. The present study corroborates these results, and
reiterates the complex morphological evolution within
this group (cf. Figure 4), which has misled earlier taxonomists (e.g. [4-13,16]). The rather colourful and strikingly patterned Tickellia, Orthotomus cucullatus,
Abroscopus (notably A. schisticeps and A. albogularis),
Oligura, Hemitesia and one, especially, of the four species of Tesia are scattered across the phylogeny among
the dull and nondescript Cettia and Urosphena (three
species of Tesia are also rather dull in coloration).
Moreover, species with extremely short tails appear on
three separate branches. This suggests instances of parallel evolution, as well as cases of both highly conserved
morphological evolution and strong morphological
divergence. A detailed investigation of this is beyond the
scope of this paper.
In the case of Cettia warblers, the overall resemblance
in plumage and structure has been taken as evidence of

Page 10 of 16

close relationship among the different species without
any cladistic analysis of these characters. The present
study strongly underscores the well-known but still
often neglected problem of defining groups based on
overall morphological similarity (although also molecular characters have been suggested to be essentially
“phenetic"; e.g. [36], and comments in [37]).
Taxonomic implications - genus level

Based on morphological characteristics, the traditional
genus Cettia has been divided into three subgenera: Cettia (containing C. cetti), Urosphena (containing the three
current Urosphena and C. pallidipes), and Horeites
(remaining mainland Asian species and C. seebohmi); C.
ruficapilla and C. parens were placed in Vitia and C.
annae in Psamathia, although it was noted that these
genera were closely related to Cettia [4]. Watson et al.
[7] recognised the subgenera Cettia and Horeites (latter
including Vitia and Psamathia), but treated Urosphena
as a separate genus. Except for the monotypic subgenus
Cettia and the subgenus Urosphena (including also
Hemitesia), none of these taxa is supported in the present study.
The generic affiliation of several of the species in clade
B has varied over the years. The monotypic genus Oligura has frequently been synonymised with Tesia (e.g.
[4,5,8,10,11]), although the present study strongly supports a closer relationship with at least one species of
Cettia (C. brunnifrons) than with Tesia. Moreover, Tesia
everetti and Cettia pallidipes had been placed in Urosphena (e.g. [7]), until King [8] suggested, based on
structural, behavioural and song characteristics, that the
former should be moved to Tesia and the latter to Cettia. The transfer of T. everetti from Urosphena to Tesia
and the removal of C. pallidipes from Urosphena are
corroborated by our data, although the latter’s position
in Cettia is not supported. The genus Urosphena has
been subsumed in Cettia (e.g. [4,6,38], which, based on
the current circumscription of Cettia, is not supported
by the molecular data.
Orthotomus cucullatus has been shown to belong in
Cettiidae [1,39], and this is strongly supported here. It is
also shown here for the first time that the type species
of Orthotomus, i.e. O. sepium, is closely related to
Orthotomus sutorius (in the family Cisticolidae; [1,39]),
and hence not a close relative of O. cucullatus. This
calls for a change of generic affiliation of O. cucullatus
(see below).
Taxonomic implications - species level

Olsson et al. [19] recommended, based on cytb and
myoglobin sequence data, that the name Cettia flavolivacea be restricted to the subspecies flavolivacea and
weberi, whereas the subspecies intricata and oblita be

Alström et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:352
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/352

placed in C. vulcania. This proposal is contradicted by
some of the data in the present study, although the conflict between different analyses precludes a firm taxonomic view. Kennerley & Pearson [16] disputed the
findings by Olsson et al. [19] based on plumage characteristics. A more comprehensive study, based on a larger
number of loci and including the single missing subspecies of C. flavolivacea and the five missing subspecies of
C. vulcania, as well as morphology and vocalizations, is
warranted.
The treatment of C. vulcania as conspecific with C.
fortipes [4,40] or as forming a superspecies with C. fortipes [7] has previously been rejected [19]. The present
study corroborates the rejection of both treatments.
Based on morphological and vocal differences [16] or
without providing any justification [5,9], C. diphone is
often split into two allopatric species, C. diphone sensu
stricto in Japan, South Korea and on Sakhalin Island
(Russia), and C. canturians in continental East Asia. The
present study supports a division into two distinct clades
(N and O), which might even be non-sisters. However,
these clades do not conform to the proposed circumscription of the two species, as our single sample of the
subspecies canturians is in the C. diphone sensu stricto
clade (N), i.e. in a different clade compared to its putative closest relative, the subspecies borealis (clade O). A
more comprehensive sampling will be needed, in combination with a thorough analysis of vocalizations, to evaluate the taxonomy of the Cettia diphone complex.
Cettia seebohmi has often been treated as a subspecies
of C. diphone sensu lato (e.g. [4,7,11]), although it has
also been considered to be a separate species based on
alleged differences in song and lack of the pronounced
sexual size dimorphism of C. diphone/C. canturians
[10,12]. Hamao et al. [17] compared songs and cytb
sequences of C. seebohmi, C. diphone borealis and C.
diphone cantans, and concluded that C. seebohmi was
sufficiently distinct to be recognised as a separate species. The present study lends further support to this
conclusion.
This study suggests that Cettia fortipes might be better
treated as three different species, and that Cettia cetti
might be treated as two species. Detailed studies of
these complexes, including vocalizations, are needed.
Revised classification

The traditional classification (e.g. [6,7,9,12,13]) is
obviously at odds with the results of the present study,
and needs to be revised. We propose a revised taxonomy that is shown in Figure 4 and Table 3 (cf. also
Table 4, with authors and type species). The recognition
of Tickellia (comprising T. hodgsoni) and Phyllergates
(comprising P. cucullatus) as monotypic genera rather

Page 11 of 16

than including them in Horornis acknowledges their
unique morphology in relation to Horornis. The same
applies (even more) to the genus Abroscopus, and also
takes into account the fact that its exact position in the
tree is considered somewhat uncertain.
Although Phyllergates cucullatus has been known to
belong in Cettiidae for some time [1,39], the type species of Orthotomus, i.e. O. sepium, has not previously
been included in a phylogenetic analysis. Accordingly, it
is only now that it is confirmed that the genus name
Orthotomus does not apply to the clade to which cucullatus belongs. As only a minority of the species in the
genus Orthotomus have been studied phylogenetically, it
is possible that more species will be included in
Phyllergates.
The circumscription of Cettia, as proposed here, is not
entirely satisfactory, as this clade is not inferred by
*BEAST, is not strongly supported in all of the concatenation analyses, and is only recovered in one singlelocus analysis (though supported by a unique deletion in
the myo alignment). Inclusion of Tesia in Cettia might
have been more appropriate based on the molecular
data, although we tentatively prefer to treat Tesia as a
separate genus, acknowledging that it is a morphologically well-defined group of long standing. An alternative
would be to recognise a monotypic genus Cettia
(including cetti), propose a new generic name for major,
and place brunnifrons and castaneocoronata in Oligura.
The genus Urosphena, as defined here, is morphologically and vocally heterogeneous (cf. [8,13,16]), although
it is well supported by the molecular data. An alternative would be to restrict Urosphena to the morphologically and vocally well defined group comprising U.
squameiceps, U. whiteheadi and U. subulata ([8,13,16];
latter not included in present study), and either place
both U. neumanni and U. pallidipes in the genus Hemitesia or recognise a monotypic genus Hemitesia (comprising U. neumanni) and propose a new generic name
for U. pallidipes.
Future studies are needed to evaluate the taxonomy of
several of the species that have been shown here to have
pronounced intraspecific genetic divergence.

Conclusions
The molecular phylogeny presented here is highly
inconsistent with the traditional, morphology-based classification. There are probably few equally striking examples in an avian genus of mismatch between deductions
made on morphological evidence and insights resulting
from molecular analysis. The phylogeny suggests that
morphological evolution within Cettiidae has been
extremely complex, with examples of highly conserved
phenotypes as well as dramatic morphological

unexpected intricacy has evidently misguided earlier taxonomists. A revised taxonomy is proposed.

Methods
Study group

Species level taxonomy follows Dickinson [12], except
for the recognition of Cettia brunnescens as a separate
species from C. acanthizoides [18]. In total, 48 taxa in
the family Cettiidae (sensu Alström et al. [1]) were
included. This comprises all recognised species, except
the Timor and Babar Islands (Indonesia) endemic Urosphena subulata, as well as large number of subspecies
(Additional file 8), in total more than 50% of all recognised taxa (cf. [7,9,12,13]). For most taxa, multiple
sequences were available, in total 94 ingroup sequences

Alström et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:352
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/352

(Additional file 8). As outgroups in the MrBayes, maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses (see below),
three species belonging to the family Cisticolidae
(Orthotomus sutorius, O. sepium, Prinia familiaris) were
chosen, as this family is closely related to Cettiidae [1,2],
and two representatives from the slightly more distantly
related Alaudidae (Alauda arvensis, Mirafra javanica)
[1,2].
DNA extraction and sequencing

DNA was extracted from blood, feathers or muscle
using QIA Quick DNEasy Kit (Qiagen, Inc) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction, but with 30 μl 0.1% DTT
added to the initial incubation step of the extraction of
feathers. We sequenced four loci: the main part of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and part of the flanking tRNA-Thr (hereafter cytb); the nuclear ornithine
decarboxylase introns 6 and 7 and exons 7 and parts of
6 and 8 (ODC); the entire nuclear myoglobin intron 2
(myo), and the nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase intron 11 (GAPDH). Amplification and
sequencing of cytb and myo followed the protocols
described in Olsson et al. [41], of ODC Allen & Omland
[42], and of GAPDH Fjeldså et al. [43]. Cytb was amplified as one fragment to decrease the risk of amplifying
nuclear pseudocopies (e.g. [44]). All new sequences have
been deposited in GenBank (Additional file 8).
Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were aligned using MegAlign 4.03 in the
DNASTAR package (DNAstar Inc.); some manual
adjustment was necessary for the non-coding sequences.
Gene trees were estimated by Bayesian inference (BI)
using MrBayes 3.1.2 [45,46] according to the following:
(1) all loci were analysed separately (single-locus analyses); (2) sequences were also concatenated, all loci
together. In the multilocus analyses, the data were either
(a) partitioned by locus, using rate multipliers to allow
different rates for the different partitions [47,48], or (b)
unpartitioned, using the same model for the entire dataset. Moreover, partitioned multilocus analyses were also
run including(a) all available sequences, i.e. also samples
for which only one or two loci were available (with the
missing sequences represented by? in the matrix), and
(b) only those samples for which all four loci were
available.
Appropriate substitution models were determined
based on the Bayesian Information Criterion [49] calculated by jModelTest version 0.1.1 [50]. For ODC, posterior probabilities (PPs) were calculated under the general
time-reversible (GTR) model [51-53], assuming rate variation across sites according to a discrete gamma distribution with four rate categories (Γ; [54]); for the three
other loci the HKY model [55] was selected, for the cytb

Page 13 of 16

data also an estimated proportion of invariant sites (I;
[56]). For the unpartitioned dataset, the GTR+Γ+I
model was selected. Default priors in MrBayes were
used. Four incrementally heated Metropolis-coupled
MCMC chains with temperature 0.1 or 0.2 were run for
10-50 × 106 generations and sampled every 1000 generations. Convergence to the stationary distribution of
the single chains was inspected using a minimum
threshold for the effective sample size. The joint likelihood and other parameter values reported large effective
sample sizes (> 200, generally > 1000), and were
inspected in Tracer 1.5.0 [57]. The first 25% of the generations were discarded as “burn-in”, well after stationarity of chain likelihood values had been established,
and the posterior probabilities were calculated from the
remaining samples. Good mixing of the MCMC and
reproducibility was established by multiple runs from
independent starting points. Each analysis was run at
least twice, and the topologies and posterior probabilities were compared by eye and by the difference of
mean estimates of independent runs within the expected
range (±3* Monte Carlo Standard Error [58]).
Integrative species tree estimation was performed
using *BEAST [20], where gene trees and species trees
are estimated simultaneously. *BEAST uses a multilocus
species estimation by the multispecies coalescent for
estimating the species tree, and hence can incorporate
multilocus data from multiple individuals. Species delimitation has to be defined a priori in *BEAST. We followed the default settings and recommendations of
*BEAST to set up the models. Nevertheless, we ran analyses under a panel of different models: (1) different
substitution models which were either (a) a GTR+Γ+I
model for the cytb sequences and HKY for the other
sequences (referred to as “GTR”), or (b) the same substitution models per partition as in the MrBayes analysis
(referred to as “jModelTest”); (2) these models were
combined with either of two clock models, (a) being a
strict molecular clock (referred to as “strict”), or (b) a
uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock [59]
(referred to as “relaxed”). A piecewise linear population
size model with a constant root was used as a prior for
the multispecies coalescent and a birth-death model [60]
as prior on divergence times. All analyses were run
including (a) all available sequences, and (b) only individuals for which all loci were available.
To establish how well each model fit the data, we calculated Bayes Factors (BF; [21,22]) in Tracer 1.5.0 [57]
using the harmonic mean as an approximation of the
marginal likelihood of a model.
Maximum likelihood bootstrapping (1000 replicates)
was performed on the complete dataset in RAxML 7.2.8
[61,62] at the CIPRES Science Gateway [63], using the
GTRCAT algorithm for the bootstrapping phase, and

Alström et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:352

GTRGAMMA for the final tree inference (as per
default); the dataset was partitioned as in the Bayesian
analyses. Parsimony bootstrapping was performed in
PAUP* [64] on the complete dataset: heuristic search
strategy, 1000 replicates, starting trees obtained by stepwise addition (random addition sequence, 10 replicates),
TBR branch swapping, MulTrees option not in effect
(only one tree saved per replicate).
Alignments and trees have been deposited in TreeBASE (http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html;
