Abstract
Background: Among the members of the genus Bordetella B. petrii is unique, since it is the only species isolated
from the environment, while the pathogenic Bordetellae are obligately associated with host organisms. Another
feature distinguishing B. petrii from the other sequenced Bordetellae is the presence of a large number of mobile
genetic elements including several large genomic regions with typical characteristics of genomic islands collectively
known as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). These elements mainly encode accessory metabolic factors
enabling this bacterium to grow on a large repertoire of aromatic compounds.
Results: During in vitro culture of Bordetella petrii colony variants appear frequently. We show that this variability
can be attributed to the presence of a large number of metastable mobile genetic elements on its chromosome.
In fact, the genome sequence of B. petrii revealed the presence of at least seven large genomic islands mostly
encoding accessory metabolic functions involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds and detoxification of
heavy metals. Four of these islands (termed GI1 to GI3 and GI6) are highly related to ICEclc of Pseudomonas
knackmussii sp. strain B13. Here we present first data about the molecular characterization of these islands. We
defined the exact borders of each island and we show that during standard culture of the bacteria these islands
get excised from the chromosome. For all but one of these islands (GI5) we could detect circular intermediates.
For the clc-like elements GI1 to GI3 of B. petrii we provide evidence that tandem insertion of these islands which
all encode highly related integrases and attachment sites may also lead to incorporation of genomic DNA which
originally was not part of the island and to the formation of huge composite islands. By integration of a tetracycline
resistance cassette into GI3 we found this island to be rather unstable and to be lost from the bacterial population
within about 100 consecutive generations. Furthermore, we show that GI3 is self transmissible and by conjugation
can be transferred to B. bronchiseptica thus proving it to be an active integrative and conjugative element
Conclusion: The results show that phenotypic variation of B. petrii is correlated with the presence of genomic
islands. Tandem integration of related islands may contribute to island evolution by the acquisition of genes
originally belonging to the bacterial core genome. In conclusion, B. petrii appears to be the first member of the
genus in which horizontal gene transfer events have massively shaped its genome structure.

Background
The enormous impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
on the evolution of bacterial species has only been recognized during the past years [1]. Among the mobile genetic
elements involved in HGT genomic islands are of particular relevance since they can comprise large genomic
regions encoding accessory factors required by the bacteria to thrive in specific environments. For example, many
virulence related factors of pathogenic bacteria are
encoded on so-called pathogenicity islands, while metabolic islands frequently encode factors required for
detoxification of poisonous compounds or for the utilization of specific carbon sources such as aromatic compounds [2,3].
The genus Bordetella harbours several important pathogens infecting humans and various animals. While B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are etiological agents of
whooping cough in man, B. bronchiseptica and B. avium
can cause respiratory infections in various mammalian
species and birds, respectively [4]. B. petrii was the first
Bordetella species isolated from the environment, while all
other Bordetella species so far could only be found in obligate association with host organisms [5]. Phylogenetically, B. petrii appears to be closely related to a common
ancestor of the pathogenic Bordetellae and links the genus
with other environmental bacteria of the genera Achromobacter and Alcaligenes [5,6]. B. petrii was repeatedly isolated from contaminated soil [7,8]. However, recently,
several isolates from clinical specimens associated with
bone degenerative disease or cystic fibrosis were found to
be closely related to B. petrii, although the underlying etiology is not clear in any of the cases [9-11]. The pathogenic Bordetellae encode a multitude of virulence factors
including several toxins and adhesins [4]. The evolutionary origin of these factors is unclear, since in contrast to
many virulence genes of other pathogens they are not
located on mobile genetic elements such as pathogenicity
islands or prophages. In fact, so far only few presumptive
horizontal gene transfer events are known among the
pathogenic members of the genus, e.g. a 66 kb island
encoding iron transport genes that presumably has been
exchanged between B. pertussis and B. holmesii, a pathogenic species mainly found in immunocompromised
individuals [12]. A prevalent feature in the evolution of
virulence in this genus is reductive genome evolution,
since strains specialized on particular host organisms such
as the exclusive human pathogen B. pertussis have presumably evolved from a B. bronchiseptica-like ancestor. Specialization to a single host was accompanied by a massive
genome size reduction. In agreement with this assumption, B. pertussis harbors numerous pseudogenes and virtually all B. pertussis genes have counterparts in B.
bronchiseptica [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/141

In contrast to B. bronchiseptica, B. petrii has a highly mosaic
genome harbouring numerous mobile elements including genomic islands, prophages and insertion elements.
These mobile elements comprise about 22% of the entire
genome [14]. Most of the seven putative genomic islands
found in B. petrii exhibit typical features of such islands
such as a low GC content, the presence of integrase genes,
conjugal transfer functions, and integration at tRNA loci
(Figure 1). There are four elements (GI1–GI3, GI6) which
strongly resemble the ICEclc of Pseudomonas knackmussii
sp. train B13, a self transmissible element encoding factors for the degradation of chloroaromatic compounds
[14-16]. The Bordetella islands exhibit a high similarity
with the ICEclc in particular in a core region comprising a
highly similar integrase and genes involved in conjugal
transfer [14]. Like the ICEclc the B. petrii elements are characterized by the insertion into tRNAGly genes and by direct
repeats formed at the insertion site [14]. The B. petrii
islands encode factors required for degradation of a variety of aromatic compounds, or multi drug efflux pumps
and iron transport functions [14].
The remaining genomic islands, GI4, GI5, and GI7,
encode type IV secretion systems probably involved in
conjugal transfer [14]. GI4 has very pronounced similarities with Tn4371 of Ralstonia oxalatica and other bacteria
including Achromobacter georgiopolitanum and encodes
metabolic functions involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds [17]. GI5 and GI7 encode a phage P4
related integrase and genes involved in metabolism of
aromatic compounds or in detoxification of heavy metals.
Finally, there is a region on the B. petrii genome (termed
GI in [14]) which is characterized by a low GC content,
but does not have other characteristic features of a
genomic island thus possibly being a remnant of a former
mobile element. GI encodes metabolic functions for the
degradation of phthalate and protocatechuate [14].
In the present study we characterize these putative
genomic islands and show that most of them are in fact
active, at least in terms of excision from the chromosome.
We show that these elements are responsible for the
genomic instability of B. petrii observed during long term
growth in vitro.

Results and discussion
Long term survival of B. petrii in river water and
appearance of phenotypic variants
B. petrii was the first Bordetella species isolated from the
environment, i.e. from a river sediment. The analysis of its
survival capacity in river water revealed a high survival rate
and nearly no decay in viability during a period of 38
weeks, while under the same experimental conditions viability of a B. bronchiseptica strain declined rapidly and no
viable bacteria could be detected in the water samples

A schematic presentation of the genomic islands described for B. petrii by bioinformatic analysis is shown [14]
Figure 1
A schematic presentation of the genomic islands described for B. petrii by bioinformatic analysis is shown [14].
Direct repeats (DR) flanking the islands and their sequence position in the B. petrii genome are indicated. Direct repeats with
identical or nearly identical DNA sequence are shown in the same colour (see also Figure 4). The approximate location of several characteristic genes such as the parA, ssb and topB genes found on all clc-like elements, integrases (int), or some relevant
metabolic functions encoded by the islands are shown. In case tRNA genes are associated with the islands these are shown
with an arrow indicating their transcriptional polarity. Finally, the approximate sizes of the predicted islands are indicated.
after about three weeks (data not shown). The short survival time of B. bronchiseptica is somewhat surprising,
since in a previous study it was shown to persist for more
than 20 weeks in lake water [18]. A possible explanation
for this may be that different B. bronchiseptica strains were
used in these studies. However, the direct comparison of
B. bronchiseptica and B. petrii demonstrates that B. petrii
has a much more pronounced capacity to survive in river
water for a prolonged time period which is in agreement
with its original isolation from river sediment. Interestingly, after about 20 days of the survival experiment stable
phenotypic variants of B. petrii with differing colony morphology regarding colour and colony size appeared when
the bacteria were plated on LB agar plates (data not
shown). In this study, three of these variants (named f, g,
k) were further characterized. All of these variants showed
virtually identical growth characteristics at 37°C in liquid
LB medium, while two of them (f, k) showed a markedly
impaired growth capacity at 15°C as compared to the wild
type strain and to variant g (data not shown).

phenotypic variants of B. petrii is in fact correlated with
the various genomic islands, we started to characterize the
three variants described above by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Figure 2 shows that after BcuI digestion each of
the three variants lack three large bands as compared to
the wild type, but they have an identical restriction pattern
among each other. To identify those regions of the variants lacking as compared to the wild type we performed
hybridization studies with a B. petrii DNA-whole genome
microarray. The results presented in Table 1 show that in
all three variants the same genes are missing and that the
deleted regions correspond to the clc-like elements GI1,
GI3, and GI6 and to the island GI5. This shows that during in vitro culture these four elements have been lost in
the three variants. It is surprising that all three variants
exhibit identical genomic variation, since, as mentioned
above, they have different growth characteristics at 15°C
and colony morphology. Therefore, additional mutation(s) must have occurred which did not involve large
deletions detectable by the array experiments.

Genome rearrangements involving the genomic islands of
B. petrii
In a previous study we have reported about the spontaneous loss of a huge part comprising more than 500 Kb of
the genome of B. petrii during in vitro culture correlating
with the presence of several genomic islands (GI1–GI3)
[14]. To investigate whether the frequent appearance of

The comparison of the deleted genes of the variants with
those which according to the annotation are encoded on
the GIs revealed a perfect congruence of the predicted
island borders and the microarray data in the case of GI3,
while the extent of the deletions and therefore the sizes of
these elements differed from the bioinformatic prediction
in the case of GI1, GI5 and GI6 [14]. According to these

site (attP) on the circular element [2,19]. To determine the
exact borders of the GIs and to detect circular intermediates occurring after excision of the elements we used a
PCR based approach. For the detection of excised circular
intermediates of the various GIs, a series of oligonucleotide primers was designed from the presumable ends of
the respective elements which are supposed to join during
circularization. In the case of the adjacent elements GI1,
GI2 and GI3 we considered that also various combinations might occur by common excision events of these
adjacent islands (Figure 3). The direct repeats flanking the
various clc-like elements of B. petrii are shown in Figure 4.

data, GI1 appears to comprise additional 12 genes
(Bpet1267–1287), GI5 additional 9 genes (Bpet3771–
3779), and GI6 appears to lack one gene (Bpet4316)
(Table 1). These data were further corroborated by a series
of Southern blot experiments with probes specific for the
respective genes, the results of which matched perfectly
with the microarray data (data not shown).
Definition of the borders of the genomic islands of B. petrii
Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are known to
be self transmissible genomic islands and their excision is
mediated by the recombination between the left and right
end repeats leading to a circular intermediate and the integration by the recombination between the attachment site
on the chromosome (attB) and the conserved attachment

Table 2 shows the results of this analysis. In the case of
GI1 no product could be amplified when using the primer
pair GI1–1/GI1–2 which should provide a product, when
the excision involves the direct repeat sequences directly
upstream (sequence position 1,084,006) and downstream (sequence position 1,339,485) of the island.
Instead, a product was obtained when the primer pair
GI1–2/GI1–3 was used which can yield a product only
when ring formation involved an alternative downstream
repeat sequence (sequence position 1,350,146). This
alternative downstream repeat sequence has three mismatches as compared to the upstream repeat and has
probably been generated by the integration of GI2, since
GI2 at the downstream end is flanked by a second nearly
identical copy of this direct repeat (Figure 4). These data
indicate that the size of GI1 is in fact larger than previously suggested and confirm the microarray data of the
spontaneous variants which indicated that the genes
Bpet1276–1287 are excised together with GI1 (termed
GI1* in Figure 3). The genomic region comprising
Bpet1276–Bpet1287 has a high GC content of about 67%
which is typical for the B. petrii core genome. The respective genes encode hypothetical proteins, two transcriptional regulators and in addition the tRNAGly gene which
was likely the original insertion point of GI1. The alternative direct repeat sequence flanking the adjacent GI2 may
now be the preferred target of the GI1 integrase and may
allow the element to incorporate this region of the
genome thereby leading to an extension of the primordial
GI1. Thus, tandem integration of genomic islands may

Schematic
Schematic presentation of the genomic region comprising the genomic islands GI1, GI2 and GI3. The GIs are
shown as a red lines, their flanking direct repeat regions (DR) by red boxes (dark and light red for identical or nearly identical
sequences, respectively) (see also Figure 4). The sequence position of the direct repeats and the approximate size of the islands
are shown below the elements. The position of tRNA genes is indicated. Some relevant or characteristic genes encoded by the
islands are shown above the elements. The bars below the elements show the expected dimensions of the element after excision from the genome.

lead to acquisition and transfer of additional genetic
material of the host genome and thereby may contribute
to evolution of GIs.
For GI2 we obtained a PCR product demonstrating the
involvement of the direct repeats directly flanking the
island at sequence positions 1,350,146 and 1,493,541.
Since GI2 is not directly associated with a tRNA gene it
appears likely that it has integrated in the left repeat of GI3
at sequence position 1,493,541, which was generated by
the previous insertion of GI3 in the respective tRNA gene
(tRNA-11). For GI3 we obtained the expected data which
also correspond to the microarray results described above.
Moreover, we obtained evidence that the clc-like elements
GI1–GI3 can excise together in different combinations:
GI2–GI3 and GI1–GI2–GI3. Therefore, these islands
appear to be able to excise independently from each other,
but also in various combinations thereby potentially
forming composed transmissible elements. In the case of
the fourth clc-like element, GI6, the microarray data
revealed the presence of the Bpet4316 gene in the chromosome even after excision of the element. This is surprising, since the direct repeat sequence which should be the

target for the GI6 integrase lies beyond this gene. Thus, the
Bpet4316 gene should be located within the excised
region. Curiously, the PCR experiments aiming in the
detection of circular intermediates showed that the
Bpet4316 gene is also part of the circular excised form of
this element. This suggests a duplication of the Bpet4316
gene during excision by an unknown mechanism.
In the case of GI4 and GI7 we obtained PCR products providing evidence for excised circular intermediates which
perfectly match the previous bioinformatical predictions
based on the detailed sequence analysis about the size of
these islands. In contrast, in case of GI5 we were not able
to detect a circular intermediate neither with the originally
predicted borders nor with the additional genes suggested
by the microarray experiments (Bpet3771–3779),
although the microarray data of the phenotypic variants f,
g, and k definitely revealed the deletion of this element
from their genomes.
As shown above, we were able to detect circular intermediates of most genomic islands by PCR amplification,
although the microarray experiments with the phenotypic

variants clearly demonstrated the deletion events. Possible explanations for this fact could be that the excised
islands are diluted during growth of the bacteria since they
cannot replicate. Moreover, the experimental protocols
for the two methods are different and PCR amplification
is much more sensitive as compared to cy3/cy5 labeling
by Klenow polymerisation.
Stability of genomic island GI3
The frequent appearance of phenotypic variants involving
the genomic islands present in the B. petrii genome and
the detection of circular intermediates of these islands
under standard growth conditions indicates that these

genomic islands are rather unstable and active at least in
terms of excision. To assess the stability of one of these
islands (GI3) by homologous recombination we integrated a tetracycline resistance cassette in GI3 between the
genes Bpet1523 and Bpet1524 coding for a putative transposase and a glycosyltransferase, respectively. Under
standard growth conditions, the resulting strain B. petrii
GI3::tetR did not show any change in its maximum specific
growth rate as compared to the wild type (data not
shown). This strain was then used for growth experiments
without selective pressure in which the bacteria were cultivated for about 150 consecutive generations. Exponentially growing B. petrii has a generation time of about 90

min (data not shown). Figure 5 shows the time course of
loss of GI3::tetR determined by differential counting of tetracycline resistant and sensitive bacteria plated out on the
respective agar plates. GI3 was stably present in the B.
petrii population for about 40 generations, then the proportion of tetracycline resistant bacteria declined steadily
and virtually no tetracycline resistant bacteria were found
in the population after about 100 generations. Lack of the
entire GI3 was confirmed by Southern blotting in representatives of these bacteria (data not shown). Although
we cannot exclude a destabilizing effect of the tetracycline
cassette on the island, it is likely that GI3 is highly unstable and gets lost with a high incidence when no selective
pressure for its persistence is present.
Transfer of genomic island GI3 to Bordetella
bronchiseptica
In the case of the ICEclc self transmission to a variety of βand γ-Proteobacteria was observed [20]. Since the clc-like
element GI3 is active at least in terms of excision from the
chromosome, we investigated its capacity to transfer itself
to another host. Therefore, the above described B. petrii
GI3::tetR strain carrying a tetracycline resistance gene in
GI3 was used for conjugation experiments with B. bronchiseptica. As a recipient B. bronchiseptica PS2 was used
which carries a TnphoA insertion in the genome conferring
kanamycin resistance [21]. Transconjugants were selected
by their resistance against kanamycin and tetracycline.
Two transconjugants were isolated and further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis after restriction of
the genomic DNA with BcuI. Both strains showed two
additional bands of the same size, which is in agreement

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/141

with the fact that the only BcuI restriction site in GI3::tetR
is located in the tetracycline gene cassette (Figure 2). To
identify the integration site of GI3::tetR in PS2 we used a
PCR based approach. Since clc-like elements are known to
preferentially integrate in genes coding for tRNAGly we
designed oligonucleotides to amplify the four tRNAGly
genes present in B. bronchiseptica. For three out of the four
tRNA genes we obtained PCR products of the expected
size. Only in the case of the BBt45 gene no PCR product
was obtained suggesting the integration of GI3::tetR in this
tRNA gene (data not shown). To identifiy the exact insertion site we used primers GI3-2 and GI3-1 from the two
ends of GI3::tetR and designed additional primers
(tRNA45-1 and tRNA45-2) from the neighbouring
sequences of the BBt45 gene. As expected, using the
primer pairs GI3-2/tRNA45-1 and GI3-1/tRNA45-2 we
obtained two PCR products of 625 bp and 647 bp, respectively. Sequence analysis of these products confirms the
integration of GI3::tetR in the BBt45 gene and reveals the
duplication of the last 18 bp of the tRNAGly gene and an
inverted repeat sequence in the direct neighbourhood.
The duplicated sequence is identical with the direct
repeats in B. petrii flanking GI1 on both sides and GI3 on
the right side (Figure 6). Similarily, the inverted repeat
sequence in the proximity of the integration site in B.
bronchiseptica resembles inverted repeat sequences associated with the integration sites of ICE-GI3 of B. petrii and
ICEclc in Pseudomonas knackmussii sp. strain B13 [22]. The
fact that GI3 can actively excise and reintegrate into the
genome of a recipient strain proves this island to be a
functional integrative and conjugative element and therefore it should be renamed ICE-GI3.

The data presented here underline the previous notion of
a highly mosaic genome of B. petrii. By microarray analysis of spontaneous phenotypic variants of B. petrii and by
direct detection of excised circular intermediates of the B.
petrii GIs we show that all of them are active at least in
terms of excision. We provide evidence that the adjacent
integration of highly related elements may enable these
elements to pick up additional genomic material placed
between the integration sites thereby leading to an
increase in the size of the islands. Moreover, the adjacent
placement of islands encoding highly similar integrases
and attachment sites may also lead to the formation of
novel huge composite islands. For ICE-GI3 we show that
without selective pressure this island is lost from the bacterial population. Moreover, we show that this island is
self transmissible and can be transferred to another Bordetella species, B. bronchiseptica. Therefore, the evolution of
B. petrii involved massive horiztonal gene transfer, while
in the classical pathogenic Bordetella species only very few
examples of HGT have been reported, e.g. the horizontal
transfer of insertion elements, the acquisition of an

(below). Above the respective DNA sequences a schematic presentation of the integration regions is shown. In B. petrii GI1–
GI3 is integrated in a tRNAGly gene (tRNA11) leading to an 18 bp duplication of the 3'-end of the tRNA (red boxes). On the
left side of the integration side an inverted repeat (IR) is indicated. Upstream of the IR a gene encoding a tRNACys is located. In
B. bronchiseptica GI3::tetR is once more integrated in a gene encoding a tRNAGly (tRNA45) leading to a 18 bp duplication of its
3'-end. Much alike in B. petrii the direct repeat sequence is followed by an inverted repeat (IR). Below the schematic presentations of the integration regions the respective DNA sequences of the integration sites are shown. The start points of the tRNA
genes are indicated by horizontal arrows indicating transcriptional polarity of the genes followed by a bar marked with a star
which indicates the end of the tRNA gene. Vertical arrows indicate the integration sites of the GIs in the tRNA genes. Related
inverted repeat sequences (IR) present in both species are boxed. In the case of B. bronchiseptica the sequence position indicated is taken from the genome sequence of strain RB50 [13].

genomic region encoding an iron uptake system in B. holmesii and, possibly, the inactivation of the genes encoding
adenylate cyclase toxin in a specific B. bronchiseptica lineage by a horizontally acquired gene cluster encoding peptide transport genes [12,23,24]. This may indicate that
their unique habitat due to an obligate host association
has dramatically limited the impact on horizontal gene
transfer for the pathogenic Bordetellae once they had
acquired their capacity to infect and to persist exclusively
in vertebrate hosts.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
In this study B. petrii DSM12804, the type strain of the
species [5], B. bronchiseptica BB7866 [25], and B. bronchiseptica PS2, carrying a TnphoA insertion in the genome,

conferring kanamycine resistance [21], were used. B. petrii
was routinely grown in LB broth, while B. bronchiseptica
strains were cultured on BG-agar plates or in SS-liquid
medium, as previously described [26]. If necessary, antibiotics were added to the culture media in the following
concentrations: tetracycline, 12.5 μg/ml; kanamycine, 50
μg/ml. Conjugation experiments were carried out by filter
mating as described previously [26]. The long time survival experiments were carried out as described by Preston
and Wardlaw [18]. For this purpose sterile filtered river
water from the river Main was inoculated with bacteria B.
bronchiseptica BB7866 and B. petrii (2,000 CFU/ml),
respectively, and incubated at 37°C. Samples were taken
at different time intervals up to 263 days after inoculation
and bacterial number was counted by plating out serial
dilutions of the bacteria.

Molecular genetic tools
DNA manipulations including cloning, restriction analysis, DNA-sequence analysis, preparation of genomic DNA,
Southern blots were carried out according to standard
procedures. In all cases, chromosomal DNA used for PCR
reactions or for whole genome hybridization analyses was
purified from bacterial cultures inoculated from single
colonies on agar plates. Pulsed field electrophoresis was
carried out with the BioRad CHEF-DRII system as
described previously [5].
B. petrii DNA microarray specifications and hybridization
conditions
Sixty-mer oligonucleotides sequences were designed as
described
previously
using
OligoArray2.0[27].
Lyophilised 5'-aminated oligonucleotides (Sigma
Aldrich) were then resuspended in SciSPOT AM 1× buffer
at 20 μM final concentration before being spotted on
aldehyde coated Nexterion slides AL (Schott) using
QArray2 (Genetix) spotter. Slides were then incubated at
room temperature in a humidity chamber (> 90% relative
humidity) and then in an oven at 120°C during 1 hour.
Slide surface was then blocked twice for 2 min in 0.2%
SDS solution, then twice for 2 min in RNase-DNase free
water. The slides were then incubated at room temperature during 15 min in 125 mM NaBH4 prepared extemporally in a 3:1 (vol/vol) PBS:Ethanol mixture. The slides
were then rinsed twice for 2 min in 0.2% SDS, then twice
for 2 min in RNase-DNase free water and dried before
hybridisation.
Genomic DNA extraction and labelling
Genomic DNA used for the microarray experiments was
prepared by using the Genomic-tip 100/G anion exchange
columns (Qiagen), following the manufactor's recommendation. 20 μg of the genomic DNA was digested with
MboI restriction enzyme (2 U/μg, Fermentas) at 37°C for
2 hours and complete restriction was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragmented genomic DNA
was purified with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1). Aliqouts of 2 μg of genomic DNA were labelled
using the Amersham Nick Translation Kit N5500 (GE
Healthcare) in the presence of 91.3 μM dATP, 91.3 μM
dGTP, 91.3 μM dTTP, 26.1 μM dCTP, and 33 μM Cy3dCTP or Cy5-dCTP. Cy-labelled dCTP was obtained from
Perkin-Elmer. After incubation at 15°C in the dark for 4
hours, the labelled genomic DNA was purified using the
QIAquick Spin PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
Microarray hybridisation and data analysis
Genomic DNA from the reference strain B. petrii DSM
12804 was hybridised against each B. petrii variant (g, k, f)
in a dye-swap experimental design. Labeled genomic DNA
was resuspended in 480 μl of hybridisation buffer containing 40% deionised formamide, 5× Denhardt's solu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/141

tion, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM Na
pyrophosphate, and 5× SSC, denatured at 95°C for 3 min
and hybridised to the B. petrii microarray for at least 12
hours at 52°C. After hybridisation the microarrays were
washed for 5–8 min at 42°C with wash buffer (2× SSC,
0.2% SDS), in 0.5× SSC for 10 min and in 0.05× SSC for
5 min at room temperature. A last rinse was carried out in
0.01× SSC for 30 sec before the microarrays were dried by
centrifugation for 5 min at 200 g. The arrays were scanned
using an Innoscan 700 (Innopsys) microarray scanner,
and analyzed with ImaGene 8.0.0 (BioDiscovery). Normalisation of the data was carried out with R Project for
Statistical Computing http://www.r-project.org. The following genome typing analysis was performed with the
program GACK http://falkow.stanford.edu/whatwedo/
software.
Determination of circular intermediates of the genomic
islands by PCR
To detect circular intermediates in the case of the B. petrii
islands oligonucleotides were designed such that in PCR
reactions amplification products can only be obtained
when the elements are circularised. The PCR primers used
for the detection of circular intermediates of the various
genomic islands are shown in Table 3. The expected products of these PCR reactions are listed in Table 2. In case of
successful amplification the PCR products were
sequenced to confirm the specificity of the amplification.
Construction of a B. petrii strain harbouring a tetracycline
resistance gene in GI3
The insertion of a tetracycline resistance cassette in the
genomic island GI3 was performed by homologous
recombination using a tetracycline resistance cassette
derived from the cloning vector pBR322 flanked by B.
petrii derived sequences. Briefly, for this purpose two DNA
fragments derived from the intergenic region of the B.
petrii genes Bpet1523 and Bpet1524 encoded on GI3 were
amplified using the PCR primer pairs Tet1/Tet2 and Tet3/
Tet4 (Table 3) which harboured restriction sites for NotI
and BcuI (Tet1/Tet2) and for EcoRI and XhoI (Tet3/Tet4),
thereby providing suitable ends for ligation with the tetracycline gene cassette. The tetracycline gene was ligated
with the amplified DNA fragments and cloned into pBluescript KS cut with NotI and XhoI. The plasmid harbouring
the tetracycline cassette was then purified and electroporated into B. petrii according to standard procedures using
a Micropulser (BioRad, Germany). Bacteria were then
plated on LB agar plates containing tetracycline to select
for integration of the tetracycline cassette into the
genome. Resulting clones were checked by Southern blotting and PCR analysis for proper integration of the resistance cassette at the desired position on GI3. The resulting
strain B. petrii GI3::tetR was used for conjugation experiments and for the analysis of island stability. These exper-

iments were carried out as described previously [28].
Briefly, overnight cultures (15 h, 37°C) of the strain were
diluted 1:100 in 30 ml of LB broth. Bacteria were incubated at 37°C and samples were taken during the late lag,
mid-log, early stationary, and late stationary phases. The
identification of spontaneously arising tetracycline sensitive clones was performed by plating out serial dilutions
on LB agar plates with and without tetracycline.
