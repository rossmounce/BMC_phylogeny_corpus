Abstract
Background: Pichia pastoris is a well established yeast host for heterologous protein expression,
however, the physiological and genetic information about this yeast remains scanty. The lack of a
published genome sequence renders DNA arrays unavailable, thereby hampering more global
investigations of P. pastoris from the beginning. Here, we examine the suitability of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae DNA microarrays for heterologous hybridisation with P. pastoris cDNA.
Results: We could show that it is possible to obtain new and valuable information about
transcriptomic regulation in P. pastoris by probing S. cerevisiae DNA microarrays. The number of
positive signals was about 66 % as compared to homologous S. cerevisiae hybridisation, and both
the signal intensities and gene regulations correlated with high significance between data obtained
from P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae samples. The differential gene expression patterns upon shift from
glycerol to methanol as carbon source were investigated in more detail. Downregulation of TCA
cycle genes and a decrease of genes related to ribonucleotide and ribosome synthesis were among
the major effects identified.
Conclusions: We could successfully demonstrate that heterologous microarray hybridisations
allow deep insights into the transcriptomic regulation processes of P. pastoris. The observed
downregulation of TCA cycle and ribosomal synthesis genes correlates to a significantly lower
specific growth rate during the methanol feed phase.

Background
The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is well established
as expression host for heterologous proteins (reviewed by
[1] and [2]). However, despite the high technological
impact of P. pastoris, the physiological and genetic information is still rather scarce. The genome sequence has not

been published, and in fact less than 100 complete gene
sequences have been deposited with GenBank by the time
of writing. Consequently, as for most other non-model
species, no DNA microarrays are being manufactured.
Hence, one of the most powerful tools for the

investigation of changes in expression patterns is not
available for this yeast species.
To circumvent this problem, heterologous hybridisation
to commercially available DNA microarrays might be conceivable. In fact, the successful non-homologous probing
to microarrays has been reported recently. These studies
cover a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria [3],
a yeast [4], but also plants [5] and metazoan organisms
[6-9]. The highest number of cross-hybridisation experiments has been performed with human microarrays.
Chismar et al. [10] report, for instance, that heterologous
probing of human cDNA arrays allows to gain useful
information about gene expression in various primates.
Moody et al. [11] compared, furthermore, the reproducibility of species-specific and cross-species hybridisations
by evaluation of microarray hybridisations of porcine and
human samples to human cDNA arrays. They reported
that results generated by heterologous hybridisation were
as reproducible as by homologous hybridisation, and the
correlation between data derived from porcine and
human hybridisations was strong. As judged from EST
sequences of the porcine genome, the authors propose,
that stretches of at least 100 bp with high similarity to the
human homologue are sufficient for hybridisation. Renn
et al. [9] compared the performance of cDNA microarrays
from an African cichlid fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) for the
heterologous hybridisation with cDNAs from eight different fish species, some of them closely related (other cichlids) and others more distantly related (among them
Atlantic salmon and guppy). They conclude that significant results are obtained even with distantly related species, however, the number of positive spots declines with
the phylogenetic distance, as strikingly does the degree of
measured regulation.
While yeasts share many morphological and physiological similarities, they represent a very heterogeneous group
of fungal organisms, and a high degree of gene sequence
similarity cannot be assumed a priori. When cDNA of the
non-conventional yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii was
probed by cross-hybridisation to Saccharomyces cerevisiae
GeneFilters, only 155 ORFs out of the Z. rouxii genome
could be reproducibly detected [4]. Anyhow, 86 genes out
of these showed altered expression patterns between nonstressed and salinity-stressed Z. rouxii cells and 38 genes
behaved differently than the S. cerevisiae homologues,
indicating that the information gained is limited but nevertheless useful. As judged from 26S ribosomal DNA
sequences, Z. rouxii is assumed to be more closely related
to S. cerevisiae than P. pastoris, but still, all three belong to
the hemiascomycetes [12].
As there are not many genes characterised for P. pastoris,
there is no simple way to assess the degree of gene

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/17

sequence similarity between P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae.
However, in many of the few genes sequenced, stretches
of high similarity (score >75% over a length of at least 250
bp and more) can be identified. Most of the known genes
belong to the carbon and energy metabolism or contribute to amino acid or protein synthesis. Another group of
P. pastoris genes with known sequence belongs to pathways specific for methylotrophic yeasts. For these genes
there are no homologues present in S. cerevisiae. Evidently, this respective fraction of the P. pastoris genome
would
remain
unevaluated
by
heterologous
hybridisation.
The main aims of this work are to verify whether a heterologous DNA array approach allows to obtain useful
information for P. pastoris, and to identify genes that are
specifically regulated upon a shift from glycerol to methanol as carbon and energy source. This shift is of particular
interest since one of the specific features of methylotrophic yeasts is the tightly regulated methanol metabolism, which has been utilised for the construction of
strong and tightly controlled expression vectors. The
methanol induced promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1
(AOX1) gene, which is repressed by many carbon sources
such as glucose, glycerol or ethanol, is widely used for heterologous gene expression in P. pastoris. Accordingly,
methanol is often used as the carbon source that induces
the production of heterologous proteins. In addition to
heterologous protein induction, the shift of the carbon
source to methanol causes major structural and physiological changes within the cell. The enzymes for methanol
metabolism are synthesised de novo and some of them
are translocated into peroxisomes. Strikingly, peroxisomes can fill most of the cellular volume and AOX1
alone can account for up to 35% of the total soluble protein [13]. Additionally, heterologous protein production
and environmental conditions like low fermentation pH
have been proven to exert stress in recombinant P. pastoris
[14]. Hence, for a first study of the transcriptomic regulations of recombinant P. pastoris, we used a strain expressing human trypsinogen under control of the AOX1
promoter, under conditions that strongly influence the
physiology of the host cells, as previously described
[15,16]. A series of microarray hybridisations was performed as depicted in table 1, first to qualify the feasibility
of cross-species hybridisation, and secondly to analyse the
effects of the substrate change in fed-batch fermentations.

Results and discussion
1. Qualification of heterologous hybridisation
Before analysing differential gene expression data, it was
our intention to verify whether the heterologous hybridisation of S. cerevisiae DNA microarrays with P. pastoris
cDNA results in significant data. Obviously, the intensity
of a signal will depend both on the amount of the specific

respective gene of S. cerevisiae. Therefore, we compared
the signals obtained from four microarrays hybridised
with P. pastoris cDNA with four microarrays hybridised
with S. cerevisiae cDNA (as a control), obtained from
shake flask cultures.
To estimate the overall potential to obtain data, and the
degree of loss of information, the total number of genes
giving significant values, and those determined to be
under a given threshold were compared (table 2). In aver-

age, 66 % of all genes present on the microarray were
either only weakly transcribed, not similar enough to produce a significant signal or not present at all in P. pastoris.
In contrast, by hybridisation with S. cerevisiae cDNA about
46 % of all genes remained undetected.
We analysed those genes of P. pastoris for which sequences
were deposited in the GeneBank database for sequence
similarities to the S. cerevisiae genome, and determined
the number of significant spots on 6 microarrays. 66 % of
the signals derived from genes with high similarity (score

> 75 % along stretches longer than at least 250 bp) were
significant, while of the moderately to weakly similar
genes only 28 % of the signals were significant. This indicates that a high sequence similarity of a sub-sequence
within a gene is sufficient for efficient hybridisation. Considering that the signal intensity will depend on sequence
similarity and length, but also on mRNA abundance, it
becomes obvious, however, that a distinct minimum
threshold of similarity cannot be defined.

It was expected that the number of positive spots would
be lower for heterologous hybridisation as compared to
homologous hybridisation, but the relatively high
number of significant values obtained in our experiment
is very promising to achieve useful and new information
from this technique. Nevertheless, we sought statistical
evidence for the biological significance of hybridisation
signals obtained with P. pastoris cDNA.

ples (yellow experiment) were evaluated, showing very
high correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.98, for S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris respectively (table 3 and Fig. 1A). The
correlation of data from identical samples on different
microarrays is somewhat lower (r = 0.86 – 0.92), due to
different relative intensities on different chips.
Since usually the data of two samples on one microarray
are to be compared, it was important to evaluate the
reproducibility, expressed as the standard deviations of
both values of each spot on microarrays hybridised with
identical samples. Fig. 1B displays the standard deviations
plotted against the mean relative intensities of all significant spots of such a P. pastoris experiment, showing that
the standard deviations do not vary over a wide range of
signal intensities, which is in concordance with the results
of Moody et al. [11]. 96 % of the signals have a relative
standard deviation (s. d. divided by mean) below 0.2.
Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between the
signal intensities obtained from P. pastoris cDNA with that
from S. cerevisiae cDNA (cells grown under the same conditions). A highly significant correlation (r = 0.72) was

observed (Fig 1C). Considering expectable differences in
gene expression, different sequence similarities and the
fact that signals from two microarrays were compared,
such a high correlation is remarkable and suggests that the
data obtained are biologically meaningful. The results
obtained are in line with the data published by Moody et
al. [11] who showed a strong correlation between porcine
and human samples on human microarrays. Our data
also support Renn et al. [9] who demonstrated that both
the number of significant spots and signal correlation of
different fish samples on A. burtoni microarrays depended
on the phylogenetic distances between sample species and
test species.
To evaluate the significance level for up- and downregulation, the signals from yellow experiments were plotted
one against the other (Fig. 1A). These values should obviously fall in the unregulated range. A threshold regulation
factor of 1.5 (illustrated by the dotted lines) includes 99.1
% of all significant spots as not significantly different,
which means that such a threshold would yield false positives for less than 1 % of the significant genes.

Finally, the global regulation pattern of P. pastoris and S.
cerevisiae between pH 5.0 and 3.5 was compared by correlating all genes downregulated under acidic conditions
(Fig. 1D). The correlation is highly significant (p < 0.01)
with a correlation coefficient r = 0.51. Clearly, different
gene regulation, as well as different degrees of sequence
similarities contribute to a reduction of this correlation.
Interestingly, the average fold signal change of regulated
genes is lower for P. pastoris than for S. cerevisiae (correlation slope = 0.8). A similar observation was made for
more distantly related fish species [9].
2. Analysis of gene regulation in P. pastoris
As an example for differential gene expression in this
study, the level of transcripts during the methanol
induction phase of a lab scale fermentation was compared
to that during the glycerol feeding phase, both at pH 5.0,
and at pH 3.0. Figure 2 shows the development of
biomass over time along with the pH and indications of
feed changes, and furthermore depicts the time points
when the analysed samples were taken.

Of all genes that gave significant signals, we report those
that showed significant differences upon the shift from
glycerol to methanol under at least one condition (pH),
and that have a defined function in S. cerevisiae.
Unsurprisingly, genes involved in the core carbon metabolism show a significantly different expression during
methanol and glycerol metabolism (table 4). Almost no

differences between the samples obtained at pH 5.0 and
3.0 were found. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase was significantly upregulated at least in one sample, whereas fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase
were found to be downregulated on methanol. Transketolase expression was enhanced while the transaldolase
transcript level was relatively reduced. Of these enzymes,
fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase and transketolase (among
others) are needed for biomass synthesis on methanol.
Some genes related to ATP production were found to be
downregulated which appears plausible as the rate of
energy consumption is lower at the significantly lower
specific growth rate when methanol is the carbon source.
The beta subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase was significantly downregulated at pH 5.0, further indicating that
methanol metabolism decreases the TCA cycle flux. The
upregulation of pyruvate decarboxylase under at least one
condition comes somewhat unexpected, because an
increase of the flux to ethanol production appears questionable for cells growing on methanol.
Table 5 displays a list of ribosomal genes that are essentially all downregulated on methanol. Considering the
decreased specific growth rate, a decrease of total RNA is
generally expected due to a decreased overall protein synthesis. Interestingly, four histone genes that gave significant signals were not regulated at pH 5.0, but induced at
pH 3.0.

Only a few amino acid biosynthesis genes appeared to be
regulated (table 6), indicating that amino acid synthesis is
turned on, both on glycerol and methanol, as mineral
media were used throughout the experiment. A major
exception was the significant regulation of the proteins
involved in methionine metabolism. While the homologues to MET3, MET16 and MET17 were upregulated on
methanol, the homologues to MET6, SAM1, SAM2 and
SAH1 were downregulated. As shown in figure 3, the first
group of enzymes catalyses the reduction and fixation of
sulphur, while the second group drives the cycle responsible for methyl group donation. The reduction of this pathway in cells grown on methanol would imply a decrease
of the flux from the C1-pool to methionine by MET6 (5methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
S-methyltransferase), which catalyses the transport of activated methyl
groups from 5-methyl-THF to homocysteine. These
methyl groups are then passed on via S-adenosyl-methionine by a variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent
methyl transferases, many of them being involved in
ribosomal subunit biogenesis, rRNA and tRNA-processing, mRNA capping and nuclear export – once again
stressing the lower demand for protein synthesis rate
upon growth on methanol.
Other significantly regulated groups of genes (table 7)
belong to the thiamine biosynthesis, all being upregulated, and the so-called snooze genes related to the stationary phase. Two of these genes, SNZ1 and SNZ2, were
differently regulated at pH 5 and pH 3, being repressed on
methanol at pH 5 and induced at pH 3, while SNZ3 was
repressed at pH 5, but did not yield a significant value at
pH 3. However, the reported high sequence similarity of
the S. cerevisiae SNZ genes will not enable a reliable differentiation of their regulation on microarrays. For S. cerevi-

siae it is reported that the highly homologous products of
the SNZ gene family are involved in vitamin B6 (pyridoxal) synthesis [17]. Zeidler et al. [18] postulated that
pyridoxal is a precursor of thiamine in yeast. Accordingly,
the SNZ genes have been reported to be induced both by
thiamine and pyridoxal depletion [17]. However, with the
data obtained in our experiment we cannot interpret the
differential behaviour of the SNZ and THI genes, since
among the genes utilising thiamine-pyrophosphat (TPP)
as cofactor, transketolase (TKL1) and pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC1, PDC5) are upregulated while PDB1
(pyruvate dehydrogenase beta-subunit) and presumably
also α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (belonging to the
TCA cyle) and DHAS (belonging to the methanol utilisation pathway) are downregulated.
Thioredoxin-related genes appeared to be regulated upon
shift from glycerol to methanol, too (table 7). Those being
downregulated at least in one sample (IMP cyclohydrolase, ribonucleotide reductase, and thioredoxin reductase)
are involved in ribonucleotide synthesis, again indicating
a decreased demand of RNA precursors. Thioredoxin peroxidase, on the other hand, which is involved in the regulation of cell redox homeostasis and response to oxidative
stress by reducing H2O2 and peroxide radicals, tended to
be upregulated. This was expected due to the higher
amount of oxidative stress during methanol utilisation.
To verify the data obtained with microarrays with an independent method, a northern blot analysis of the total RNA
samples from the culture grown at pH 5.0 was performed,
using the respective P. pastoris homologous sequences to
produce the probes (Fig. 4). The actin mRNA level was
unchanged whereas the human trypsinogen mRNA level
(as a positive control) was strongly induced on methanol,

both as expected. MET17 and SAH1 exemplify
differentially regulated genes identified by the microarray
experiment (table 6). The data from the northern blot
confirmed the results derived by microarray analysis, further underlining the reliability of the method.
Surprisingly, only minor differences in transcriptional regulation were observed between cultures grown at pH 5.0
and pH 3.0. Of course it has to be considered that not the
direct effects of a shift in external pH was observed. Still,
one could expect a different set of genes to be significantly
regulated upon a shift to methanol metabolism at the different pH values. At pH 3.0 a decreased yield in biomass
was detected as compared to cultures at pH 5.0, which is
consistent with the observation of Hohenblum et al. [16]
stating that low fermentation pH decreases the viability of

P. pastoris. In order to compare the general behaviour of P.
pastoris at different external pH to that of S. cerevisiae, we
measured the intracellular pH (pHi) of the cells. The cells
of the culture at pH 5.0 showed a pHi of 7.1 at the end of
the glycerol phase, and of 7.2 the end of the methanol
phase, whereas the pHi of both samples of the cultures at
pH 3.0 was 7.3. Thus, no changes of the pHi were observed
between cultures grown at the chosen pH values, which is
in contrast to the behaviour of S. cerevisiae, where the pHi
appears to be more dependent on the external pH [19,20].

Conclusions
We could successfully demonstrate that it is possible to
obtain new and valuable information about transcriptomic regulation in P. pastoris by probing S. cerevisiae DNA
microarrays.

Northern blot analysis of selected genes
Northern blot analysis of selected genes. Exemplarily, the RNA of the pH 5.0 experiment was analysed for the expression of four genes. Actin and human trypsinogen were used as controls for an unregulated, and a methanol induced gene,
respectively. MET17 (O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase) and SAH1 (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase) were chosen as
strongly down- or upregulated genes, as determined before (table 6).

Specific regulation upon a shift from glycerol mineral
medium to methanol mineral medium under conditions
similar to a production process were analysed. As major
effects we recognised a downregulation of TCA cycle
genes, and a transcriptional decrease of genes related to
ribonucleotide and ribosome synthesis. Furthermore, the
supply of activated methyl groups via adenosyl methionine was reduced, indicating a decreased ribosome and
tRNA synthesis, which is not surprising since the specific
growth rate is significantly decreased during the methanol
feed phase in comparison to the glycerol feed phase. Correspondingly, a downregulation of the energy metabolism
upon methanol induction appears reasonable.
Only a few genes were differentially regulated when comparing expression differences between growth on glycerol
and growth on methanol of a culture grown at pH 5.0 to
one at pH 3.0. Among the few genes found are the SNZ
genes and the histone genes, but a plausible hypothesis
for the differential pH dependent regulation was not
found. Interestingly, also the intracellular pH did not
change between the different external conditions, indicating a major difference in pH regulation between P. pastoris
and S. cerevisiae.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/17

For the yellow experiment the samples were taken in
exponential phase after 5 h of growth (OD660 for S.
cerevisiae: 0.89, P. pastoris: 1.2).
To assess differentially regulated genes the respective cultures were divided after 5 h of growth. One half was incubated as before, whereas the other half was supplemented
with 250 mM acetic acid. Samples were collected after
shaking for 1.5 h at 28°C. The pH of the untreated culture
was 5. The pH of the acid treated culture was 3.5.
3. Fermentation of P. pastoris
Fed batch fermentations were performed with a MBR mini
bioreactor with a final working volume of 2 l, essentially
as described by Hohenblum et al. [16].

The media were as follows
PTM1 trace salts stock solution contained per litre
6.0 g CuSO4• 5H2O, 0.08 g NaI, 3.0 g MnSO4• H2O, 0.2 g
Na2MoO4• 2H2O, 0.02 g H3BO3, 0.5 g CoCl2, 20.0 g
ZnCl2, 65.0 g FeSO4• 7H2O, 0.2 g biotin and 5.0 ml H2SO4
(95 %-98 %). All chemicals for PTM1 trace salts stock solution were from Riedel-de Haën, except for biotin (Sigma),
and H2SO4 (Merck Eurolab).

Materials and Methods
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased
from Merck Eurolab, and all enzymes for DNA manipulation were purchased from MBI Fermentas.
1. Strains
The expression strain used in this study was P. pastoris
strain X33 (Invitrogen), a wild type strain which can grow
on minimal media without supplements. The identity of
the strain in use was verified by partial 26S ribosomal
DNA sequencing (data not shown). The selection mechanism was based on the Zeocin™ resistance of the transformation vector. Transformation of the strain was carried
out with a plasmid derived from pPICZαB (Invitrogen),
containing the gene for human trypsinogen 1 [21]. pPICZαB utilises the AOX1 promoter of P. pastoris and the αfactor leader sequence of S. cerevisiae for product secretion. The selected strain was of the methanol utilisation
positive (mut+) phenotype, which means that it is fully
capable to metabolise methanol as the sole carbon source.

As a control strain we used S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-5D
(MATa, ura3) [22].
2. Shake flask cultivation of P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae
Shake flask cultures were performed at 28°C in YPD
medium (2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract).

The cells were inoculated to an OD660 of 0.3 from a preculture grown over night.

Batch medium contained per litre
23.7 ml H3PO4 (85 %), 0.6 g CaSO4• 2H2O, 9.5 g K2SO4,
7.8 g MgSO4• 7H2O, 2.6 g KOH, 40 g glycerol, 4.4 ml
PTM1 trace salts stock solution.
Glycerol fed-batch solution contained per litre
632 g glycerol (100 %) and 12 ml PTM1 trace salts stock
solution
Methanol fed-batch solution contained per litre
988 ml methanol (100 %) and 12 ml PTM1 trace salts
stock solution

The dissolved oxygen was controlled at DO = 30 % with
the stirrer speed (600 – 1200 rpm). Aeration rate was 100
l h-1 air, which was supplemented with oxygen (up to 25
%) after the begin of the fed batch. The temperature was
25°C, and the pH was controlled with NH3 (25 %).
Before starting the fermentation, the pH of 1.2 l batch
medium was set to 5.0 with NH3 (25 %). The batch phase
of approximately 32 h was followed by a 4 h fed batch
with glycerol medium (feed rate 15.6 ml h-1), leading to a
dry biomass concentration of approximately 40 g l-1.
Then, the feed with methanol medium was started with a
feed rate of 6.4 ml h-1. The fermentation was terminated
14 h after the methanol feed start. The pH was 5.0 during
batch, and either kept at 5.0 throughout the fermentation,
or decreased to 3.0 at the beginning of the glycerol fed

Microbial Cell Factories 2004, 3:17

batch. The final dry biomass concentration was 51.4 g l-1
at pH 5.0, and 46.7 g l-1 at pH 3.0.
Samples were taken at the end of the glycerol fed batch
phase and at the end of the methanol fed batch phase,
respectively, as depicted in figure 2.
4. mRNA preparation
The cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 × the volume of
TRI-reagent (Sigma) and frozen.

The samples were thawed on ice and after addition of acid
washed glass beads the cells were homogenised in a
Ribolyser (Hybaid Ltd.) for 2 × 20 sec, in between cooling
on ice. After addition of chloroform, the samples were
centrifuged and the total RNA was precipitated from the
aqueous phase adding isopropanol. The pellet was
washed 2 × with 70% ethanol, dried and re-suspended in
RNAse free water. mRNA was isolated using the MicroPoly(A)Purist mRNA purification Kit (Ambion) according
to the manufacturers protocol.
5. Synthesis and labelling of cDNA
5 µg of mRNA and 0.5 µg of oligo dT primer were mixed
in 7 µl of water, incubated for 5 min at 70°C and subsequently at 42°C for about 3 min. The following
components were added to 5 µl of said reaction mixture:
4 µl reaction buffer (5 x) for SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 2 µl dTTP (2 mM), 2 µl dATP,
dGTP, dCTP (5 mM), 2 µl DTT (100 mM), 2.5 µl RNasin
(40 U, Promega) and 2 µl FluoriLink Cy3-dUTP (1 mM)
or 2 µl FluoriLink Cy5-dUTP (1 mM, Amersham Biosciences) respectively, and 1 µl SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 U, Invitrogen) to result in a total of 19.5 µl.
The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 42°C. After addition
of further 200 U SuperScript II reverse transcriptase the
mixture was incubated for another 1 h at 42°C. 7 µl of 0.5
M NaOH/50 mM EDTA were added and the mixture was
incubated at 70°C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was
neutralised by addition of 10 µl Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (1 M).
The labelled cDNA of the two corresponding samples
were pooled and purified with Qiaquick purification columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
6. Chip hybridisation and set-up of microarrays
The cDNA microarrays used for this study were Hyper
Gene Yeast Chips from Hitachi Software Engineering
Europe AG. According to the manufacturer, about 0.1 to
0.3 ng of PCR amplified cDNA (approximately 200 bp to
8000 bp) were spotted onto a poly-L-lysine coated glass
slide and fixed by baking, succinic anhydride blocking
and heat denaturation.

Labelled cDNA was resuspended in about 70 µl of 5 ×
SSC/0.05% SDS, heat denatured at 95°C for 3 min and

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/17

cooled on ice. SDS crystals appearing were dissolved by
short and slight warming and the mixture was gently
applied to a Yeast Chip according to the scheme presented
in table 1. The spotted area was covered with a cover glass
and the chips were placed in an airtight container with a
humidified atmosphere at 60°C for 16 h.
The cover glasses were removed in 2 × SSC/0.1% SDS and
the chips were washed consecutively for 5–10 min each in
2 × SSC/0.1% SDS, 0.5 × SSC/0.1% SDS, and 0.2 × SSC/
0.1% SDS at RT. The chips were centrifuged at 600 rpm for
3 min in order to dry them. The washing conditions were
chosen according to the manufacturer's manual. We have
tested less stringent washing conditions which led to
higher background without increasing the number of positive signals.
7. Data acquisition and processing
Images were scanned at a resolution of 50 µm with a
G2565AA Microarray scanner (Agilent) and were
imported into the GenePix Pro 4.1 (Axon Instruments)
microarray analysis software. GenePix Pro 4.1 was used
for the quantification of the spot intensities. Each appearing gene spot was averaged. The data set was then
imported into GeneSpring 6.1 (Silicon Genetics) for further normalisation and data analysis.

All of the values of each channel on each chip were
divided by their respective median for normalisation.
Subsequently, the median intensity of all 84 TE spots
(spotted with buffer, no DNA) deduced from each value,
and all spot values less then the standard deviation of said
84 threshold values were considered to be not significant
and were set to the value of the standard deviation. To
determine induction or repression of gene activity, the
normalised signals on each spot were compared, and all
genes showing a signal difference exceeding the threshold
(2 fold for S. cerevisiae, and 1.5 fold for P. pastoris, see
results) on both parallel independent microarrays were
judged as significantly regulated.
8. Statistical evaluation of microarray data
After normalisation and background deduction, pairwise
correlations of all significant values were calculated using
Pearson's correlation coefficient. To evaluate the variability of data derived from both dyes on one chip, the standard deviations of all significant spots hybridised with two
identical samples were plotted against the respective
normalised mean intensity value. To judge the correlation
of gene regulation between S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris, the
regulation factors of all of genes that were significantly
downregulated in S. cerevisiae upon a difference of pH 5.0
to 3.5, were correlated to the respective P. pastoris regulation factor upon the same media difference, using the
Pearson's correlation coefficient.

Microbial Cell Factories 2004, 3:17

The significance of all correlations against randomly distributed values were evaluated by a t-test, applying a significance level p < 0.01. To exclude an effect of data
clustering (as the majority of the values are rather low) on
correlation, Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated as well. As these differed only slightly from Pearson's coefficients, they are not shown.
Linear regression analysis was performed with the regulation intensities of P. pastoris against S. cerevisiae in order to
compare the average fold change observed for both yeasts.
9. Determination of the intracellular pH (pHi)
The pHi was determined as described by Valli et al. [19].
Essentially, samples were centrifuged and resuspended in
McIlvaine buffer [23] at pH 3.0, containing 20 µM
carboxy SNARF-4F AM (Molecular Probes). Loaded cells
were analysed on a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) with a 488 nm argon-ion laser.
104 cells were measured per analysis, using PBS as the
sheath fluid. Carboxy SNARF-4F fluorescence emission
was measured through a 585/21 BP filter (FL2) and a 670
LP filter (FL3). Threshold settings were adjusted so that
cell debris were excluded from data acquisition. The ratio
of the two fluorescence intensities is a measure for the
internal pH. Calibration was performed with
amphotericin B (Sigma) perforated cells as described in
Valli et al. [19].
10. Northern blot analysis
Northern blot analysis was essentially performed as
described by Sambrook et al. [24]. In short, total RNA prepared as described above was fractionated on a denaturing
formaldehyde containing gel, capillary blotted onto a
nylon membrane (Nytran Supercharge, Schleicher &
Schuell) and fixed by baking. The membrane was stained
with methylene blue (0.04% in 0.5 M NaOAc, pH 5.2) for
quality control and to ensure that equal amounts of RNA
had been loaded.

The probes were PCR amplified from genomic P. pastoris
DNA using the following primers: actin: gttccagccttctacgtttctattca and acggagtactttctttctggtggag; SAH: agctgaacttgattttggacgac
and
acttgaggcttgatgttgctgac;
Met17:
tgcatcaatggtcacggtaaca and tggtgagtagagtagtaaggagcaatga.
The probe for human trypsinogen was prepared as
described in [15]. The probes were DIG labelled using the
PCR DIG Labeling Mix (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Pre-hybridisation and hybridisation were performed in
high SDS hybridisation buffer at 42°C.
The blots were washed twice at RT with 2 × SSC/0.1 % SDS
and two times at 68°C with 0.5 × SSC/0.1 % SDS. Staining

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/17

of the blots was performed using anti-Digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase Fab Fragments (Roche) and the CDP
Star chemiluminescent reagent (Tropix) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The images were taken with a
Lumi imager F1 (Boehringer Mannheim).
