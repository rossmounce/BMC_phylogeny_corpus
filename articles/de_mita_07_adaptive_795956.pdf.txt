Abstract
Background: The NODULATION RECEPTOR KINASE (NORK) gene encodes a Leucine-Rich Repeat
(LRR)-containing receptor-like protein and controls the infection by symbiotic rhizobia and
endomycorrhizal fungi in Legumes. The occurrence of numerous amino acid changes driven by
directional selection has been reported in this gene, using a limited number of messenger RNA
sequences, but the functional reason of these changes remains obscure. The Medicago genus, where
changes in rhizobial associations have been previously examined, is a good model to test whether
the evolution of NORK is influenced by rhizobial interactions.
Results: We sequenced a region of 3610 nucleotides (encoding a 392 amino acid-long region of
the NORK protein) in 32 Medicago species. We confirm that positive selection in NORK has
occurred within the Medicago genus and find that the amino acid positions targeted by selection
occur in sites outside of solvent-exposed regions in LRRs, and other sites in the N-terminal region
of the protein. We tested if branches of the Medicago phylogeny where changes of rhizobial
symbionts occurred displayed accelerated rates of amino acid substitutions. Only one branch out
of five tested, leading to M. noeana, displays such a pattern. Among other branches, the most likely
for having undergone positive selection is not associated with documented shift of rhizobial
specificity.
Conclusion: Adaptive changes in the sequence of the NORK receptor have involved the LRRs,
but targeted different sites than in most previous studies of LRR proteins evolution. The fact that
positive selection in NORK tends not to be associated to changes in rhizobial specificity indicates
that this gene was probably not involved in evolving rhizobial preferences. Other explanations (e.g.
coevolutionary arms race) must be tested to explain the adaptive evolution of NORK.

Background
Many plants allow intracellular accommodation of symbiotic microorganisms in order to improve nutrient

uptake. The most ubiquitous example is vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) which are specific organs contributed by plant roots and fungi [1]. VAM are probably as

old as the common ancestor of all land plants [2] and
most of them are described as generalist (i.e. many distantly related fungi can associate with a given plant). In
contrast, only plants of the Fabaceae family (legumes),
plus the Ulmaceae Parasponia, harbor nitrogen-fixing bacteria in specific root organs (nodules). A polyphyletic
group of symbiotic bacteria collectively named rhizobia
are able to trigger nodule organogenesis [3]. The legumerhizobium symbiosis is characterized by host-symbiont
specificity controlled by stringent partner recognition. As
a result, only a limited range of bacteria can nodulate a
given legume species. Despite their differences in levels of
specificity, VAM and rhizobial symbioses exhibit the same
identical host cellular responses at early stages of the interaction. It is possible that VAM have served as a pre-adaptation to the rhizobial symbiosis [4]. The specificity in
legume-rhizobium symbiosis is mediated by signaling
molecules released by both partners, among which rhizobial Nod factors are thought to be the most important [5].
Recently, VAM fungi have also been shown to release signaling molecules as well [6]. There is mounting evidence
that the same genes are activated during the establishment
of both rhizobial and fungal symbioses [7].
The gene NORK (NODULATION RECEPTOR KINASE) of
Medicago truncatula [8] controls a common signaling pathway required for some of the earliest stages of Nod factor
signaling, but also mycorrhizal signaling. NORK encodes
a transmembrane protein with structural analogy to receptor kinases involved in signaling or disease resistance. Its
extracellular region contains a large N-terminal which has
not yet been functionally characterized. The C-terminal
region of the extracellular domain (closer to the transmembrane domain in the predicted primary structure)
contains three Leucine-Rich Repeats (LRRs) which are
motifs involved in ligand binding. LRRs appear in many
proteins involved in disease resistance or cellular signaling. LRRs are expected to conform as aligned β sheets in
which solvent-exposed (non-Leucine) residues control
ligand specificity [9].
Current hypotheses regarding its functional role propose
that NORK is involved in a complex Nod factor receptor
[10] or that it plays an intermediary part and connects the
activity of Nod factor (and mycorrhizal) receptors to subsequent steps [11]. However, no functional experiments
testing these hypotheses have been reported yet. We previously examined patterns of within- and between-species
nucleotide variation in NORK and found footprints of
positive selection in the phylogeny of six legume species
from five different genera but no evidence of positive
selection in the polymorphism of Medicago truncatula
[12]. The finding of positive selection was based on messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences spanning the entire coding region of the gene but available for only a few species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/210

Signatures of positive selection were clearly located in the
region encoding the LRRs. Even if NORK is a key component of the Nod factor signaling pathway, it is not obvious
that the legume-rhizobium symbiosis is the only explanation for the selective pressures found in that gene. We
aimed to investigate whether NORK evolution can be
linked specifically to the evolution of rhizobial symbiosis,
focusing on shifts in host specificity.
The Medicago genus is the only available fine-scale case
study of the patterns of rhizobia specificity [13]. Most
Medicago species are associated to two sister species, Sinorhizobium medicae and S. meliloti. However, basal species
are associated to more specific, Near-East strains (making
the identification of the ancestral state impossible). Two
non-basal Medicago species (M. noeana and M. rigiduloides) seem to have reverted to this preference for NearEast strains. Two sister species M. laciniata and M. sauvagei
are associated to the specific group of S. meliloti bv. medicaginis [14], and M. monspeliaca is associated to another
group. This pattern suggests several important transitions
of symbiotic preference along the Medicago phylogeny.
Here we present a detailed analysis of the evolution of
NORK using an intensive sampling of species from the
genus Medicago and focusing on the LRR region. Species
included in our sample were selected to encompass evolutionary transitions that occurred during the evolution of
the genus Medicago. We examined a region of 3610 nucleotides coding for the extracellular domain of NORK. We
sequenced 32 Medicago species and used 6 mRNA
sequences from other genera. A widely used indicator of
selective constraint is the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates [15]. This parameter is
referred to as ω and can be estimated from aligned coding
sequence data using a maximum-likelihood method [16]
which allows testing various hypotheses. The data exhibit
strong evidence that NORK has undergone positive selection in the history of the Medicago genus. We present an
estimation of the proportion of sites under selection and
their position in the gene. We test whether branches of the
Medicago phylogeny which are associated to changes in
rhizobial preferences exhibit evidence of positive selection. We find that there is no obvious such influence
whereas at least one branch associated to no known transition in symbiotic specificity has almost certainly undergone positive selection.

Results
Sequence data
A region of 3610 nucleotides was sequenced in 32 Medicago species (pairwise identity: minimum 0.908, maximum 0.996, mean 0.942). Positions of exons were
determined by homology with M. truncatula. A proteincoding region of 1178 nucleotides was extracted and

aligned with mRNA sequences of 6 species from other
genera (pairwise identity: minimum 0.811, maximum
0.996, mean 0.932). This alignment was translated in an
alignment of 392 amino acids (pairwise identity: minimum 0.730, maximum 0.997, mean 0.900). The NORK
protein has undergone a few insertion and deletion
events. They are restricted to a short track of the extracellular domain (not in the LRRs). Within Medicago (and
using mRNA sequences of Lotus and Sesbania as outgroups) we observe two short deletions (positions 200
and 221, numbered with respect to the M. truncatula protein sequence CAD10809) and one short insertion (two
residues between 240 and 241). Outside Medicago there
are only two additional short insertion/deletion events: a
two-residue insertion at positions 214–215 common to
all Medicago and a single amino acid insertion/deletion at
position 373 (the only insertion occurring outside the
200–241 range). Hence NORK has undergone relatively
few rearrangement events within the Hologalegina clade
[17].
Significant excess of non-synonymous substitutions in
NORK between Medicago species
The phylogenetic relationships between Medicago species
have been examined in a previous study using a nuclear
locus [18]. The analyses described below have been performed using the branching order (the topology) found in
this study. The unrooted phylogeny we used is displayed
in Figure 1A. At first, only between-site variation of selective constraints was considered. We fitted two models of
site variation of ω, the non-synonymous to synonymous
rate ratio (Table 1). The comparison of these models
allows detecting positive selection [19]. The model M8A is
the null model and doesn't allow positive selection. Variation in the strength of purifying selection among sites is
modeled by a Beta distribution controlled by two parameters (p and q), and an additional category fixed to ω = 1
is implemented. In M8 this last ω value is allowed to vary
beyond one, while all other features are the same. We find
that the maximum likelihood estimate of ω in M8 is 2.37
(more than twice more non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions, therefore reflecting positive selection). The frequency of these sites under positive selection
is 0.10 (close to 38 amino acid sites). There is a large and
unambiguously significant gap in likelihood between
M8A and M8 (likelihood ratio = 54.44, P < 10-12), strongly
supporting the finding of signatures of positive selection
in NORK.
Identification of candidate sites targeted by positive
selection
The amount of data at each site of an alignment is considered to be insufficient to allow an independent estimation
of ω for individual sites. The so-called Bayes empirical
Bayes procedure [20] overcomes this problem by using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/210

the parameters of the M8 model as a prior distribution of

ω. The Bayes empirical Bayes procedure allows estimating
(i) the probability that a given site belongs to each ω category in the model and (ii) a per-site prediction of ω along
with a confidence interval. Sites displaying a high probability (> 0.95) of belonging to the free ω category of model
M8 (ω = 2.37) are candidate targets of positive selection.
Our analysis suggests nine candidate sites with probability
> 0.95: 214 (R), 228 (F), 275 (H), 284 (R), 421 (A), 444
(M), 445 (L), 466 (S) and 468 (W). Site numbering and
amino acids given are these of M. truncatula (GenBank:
CAD10809).
Among site variation of ω is represented in Figure 2. The
nine candidate sites, and more broadly sites with high predicted ω values, are scattered in the extracellular domain
of NORK (including in the LRRs motifs). The solventexposed β sheets of the LRR motifs, which are predicted to
control ligand specificity [9], have not undergone positive
selection. Interestingly, the C-terminal ends of the three
LRRs harbor five of the nine candidate sites, and these
sites are at comparable distances from the end of the β
sheets. Assuming the spatial structure of other LRR proteins [21], these five candidate sites may be at spatially
nearby positions. The four other sites occur in the large Nterminal region of the extracellular domain of NORK
which consists of a currently undetermined structural
domain.
Positive selection did not occur preferentially in branches
where shifts in rhizobial specificity took place
We tested whether positive selection occurred specifically
in the branches where changes in rhizobial preference
occurred. We used the test designed by Yang [22] for
detecting positive selection in particular branches of a
phylogeny. The branches numbered 1–5 correspond to
changes in rhizobial specificity (Figure 1A). The branch 6
is selected a posteriori because of its unexpected length in
the phylogeny of NORK, comparing with branch lengths
of previous phylogenies of the genus (Figure 1B). This
length is defined as nucleotide substitutions per codon
and not in non-synonymous substitutions, and therefore
there is no a priori knowledge of any excess of non-synonymous substitutions in this branch (this is a prerequisite
to the application of the test). To our knowledge, branch
6 is not correlated to any known change in phenotype in
Medicago species. The null model for this test assumes no
variation of ω between both sites and branches (all
branches evolve under a same ω0). The addition of one
additional ω1, different from the background ω0, is tested
separately in all six chosen branches. For branches 1, 2
and 3, ω appears not to be significantly different from
other branches (Table 2). Branch 2 is of length 0 (see Figure 1B) and therefore the test is meaningless for this
branch. In contrast, ω is significantly higher in branches 4

and 6 and significantly smaller in branch 5. It is very
unlikely that any non-synonymous substitution occurred
in this last branch (ω ≈ 0). For branches 4 and 6, however,
ω is not significantly greater than one (Table 2, see Methods).
Most branches where changes in rhizobial specificity
occurred don't display any increase in the rate of non-synonymous substitutions. The only one that shows such
increase is the branch leading to M. noeana (branch 4).
Conversely, at least one other branch (branch 6) displays
an even larger increase (ω1 = 1.90 for branch 6 to be compared to ω1 = 1.13 for M. noeana). Branch 6 is not associated with the pattern of rhizobial specificity in extant
species. These results indicate that positive selection in
NORK is very unlikely to be connected to changes in
rhizobial specificity in the Medicago genus.

Discussion
We have examined the pattern of nucleotide divergence in
the coding sequence of NORK between species of the
genus Medicago. We found signatures of positive selection
suggesting episodes of molecular adaptation of NORK in
the history of this genus, but with no evidence of correlation with shifts of rhizobial specificity. Below we first
examine one methodological issue that might put into
question the finding of positive selection, and then discuss its possible interpretations.
Are our results robust to tree misspecification?
We used a phylogeny of Medicago species previously published, and determined using a different locus than the
one used for testing positive selection. The phylogeny
built from NORK sequences (not shown) is indeed
severely conflicting with the one we used. Using a tree
inconsistent with the data may restrain the validity of the
test for positive selection [23]. To confirm our finding of
positive selection, we evaluated the robustness of our
results to several tree topologies (including the phylogeny
reconstructed with amino acid sequences, which by definition tends to minimize the number of non-synonymous changes). Overall we find that the evidence for
positive selection is not as strong but still highly significant [see Additional file 1]. The estimated number of candidate sites tends to drop, but the estimated ωs is still close
to 2 and the positions of candidate sites are qualitatively
conserved (at last five of the nine candidate sites are conserved, two in the N-terminal region and one in each
LRR).
Positions of candidate sites in the protein
No candidate site has been identified in the solventexposed β sheets of the LRRs. This result contrasts with
many previous studies of LRR-containing resistance gene
families where positive selection mostly targeted these

solvent-exposed sites (e. g. [24,25]). However, Caicedo
and Shaal [26] noted that a majority of sites under positive selection fell outside of solvent-exposed regions in a
study of positive selection in a LRR resistance gene of a
Solanum,. Therefore the operating mode of positive selection in the evolution of LRRs might vary between genes,
presumably resulting from different spatial interactions
between LRR proteins and their ligand or ligands.
Four of the nine candidate sites are in the N-terminal
region of NORK which consists of a currently undetermined structural domain. Resistance proteins containing
LRRs often include TIR and NBS domains at a similar
position. Their role in determining ligand specificity [27]
as well as the presence of positively selected sites in these
domains [24,25] have been demonstrated. It is therefore
possible that the unknown N-terminal domain of NORK
has a role in controlling interactions with other proteins.
The position of sites where positive selection occurred
might be relevant for the inference of the spatial structure
of NORK.
NORK does not seem to control partner choice between
Sinorhizobium strains in Medicago
The occurrence of positive selection in NORK being demonstrated, we sought for a hypothesis to explain it. The
product of this gene is involved in both rhizobial and
endomycorrhizal symbioses [8]. Furthermore, NORK may
have additional roles. It is possible that it intervenes also
in the control of root hair growth [28]. In this context it is
difficult to infer which selective constraints have driven
the numerous amino acid substitutions we detected. A
phylogeny of the genus Medicago was previously reconstructed using internal and external spacers of the nuclear
ribosomal DNA [18]. This phylogeny allowed to identify
five putative events of changes in rhizobial specificity
within the genus Medicago [13].

Here we tested whether amino acid substitutions of
NORK have played a role in these changes of specificity,
by testing whether more substitutions occurred in

branches where these changes occurred. The branches corresponding to the association with a large range of Sinorhizobium meliloti and medicae strains (branch 2), and to
specializations to limited ranges of strains (branches 1
and 3) show very small and non-significant variations of
ω. M. noeana and M. rigiduloides are closely related (but
not sister) species which seem to have both reverted to an
ancestral state. However their branches exhibit contrasted
pattern of non-synonymous and synonymous evolution.
The branch 4 (leading to M. noeana) has an ω of 1.13 significantly larger than in the rest of the tree but not significantly larger than one. The branch 5 (leading to M.
rigiduloides) has a significantly lower, virtually null ω. The
result for branch 4 is ambiguous because it is not possible
to positively discriminate between positive selection and
relaxed purifying constraints, since ω is not significantly
greater than one. Furthermore, the statistical properties of
branch-specific ω, such as sampling errors, as well as their
behavior with varying branch length, have been poorly
described. Even if positive selection indeed occurred in
the branch leading to M. noeana, it must have occurred
also in other branches not connected to changes in rhizobial specificity. First, because our initial study having
detected positive selection did not use this species [12].
Second, because the branch 6 is an even more likely candidate than branch 4 (albeit not significant either). Therefore it is obvious from the results described in Table 2 that
there is no general increase in ω in branches associated to
changes in rhizobial specificity. Evolving preferences
between several groups of Sinorhizobium are not a good
candidate for explaining the high rates of amino acid
replacements in NORK in Medicago.
Alternative explanations
The exact role of NORK in Nod factor signaling is currently unclear [7,10,11], as well as the way it is involved
in its other putative functions (mycorrhizal signaling and
control of root hair growth). It is not excluded that the
NORK protein interacts directly with Nod factors, putative
mycorrhizal signaling molecules, or any kind of ligand. It
is therefore difficult to formulate any precise hypothesis

for explaining positive selection in NORK. Below we only
enumerate a few general hypotheses.

crucial selective pressures at least in the Medicago genus,
but raise questions relative to their origin.

The hypothesis tested in this article is that NORK evolution has been driven by changes of rhizobial specificity
(i.e. acquisition of a new partner, or co-speciation of partners). This form of evolution can be detected because
former states are conserved in unchanged descendants of
ancestral species. Another possibility is a coevolutionary
arms race between Medicago and Sinorhizobium, a process
where both partners evolve in response to each other's
innovations [29]. This may not be easily detectable
because the changes don't occur at speciations and the
ancestral states do not persist. This suggestion assumes
that NORK interacts directly with a rhizobial product, and
that the symbiosis generates antagonist-like pressures of
selection (through conflicts of interest or episodic parasitism).

Methods

As a putative receptor for vesicular arbuscular endomycorrhizae (VAM) signaling, NORK might as well be under
selective pressures caused by the interaction with mycorrhizal fungi. At first glance, VAM are not expected to be
able to require molecular adaptation because of a typical
absence of specificity (any change would disrupt the interaction). However hidden specificity caused by specific life
history [30], and also possible conflicts of interest in VAM,
can be taken on consideration as potential sources of
selective pressure.
Genes can be recruited as resistance genes while having an
initial different function (e.g. [31]). As a regulator of common plant symbioses, NORK may be used as an entry
route for parasites using nodule/VAM development pathway to infect root tissues. In that case, this gene is likely to
behave as a resistance gene. There is some clue that the
Lotus japonicus homologue of NORK is required for parasitic infection by root parasites [32] but this result has not
been confirmed in Medicago.
Eventually, functional studies of protein interactions in
which NORKis involved will help identifying the putative
selective pressures it undergoes and consequently narrow
down these hypotheses.

Conclusion
We confirm the occurrence of positive selection in the
symbiotic gene NORK. We show that positive selection
was probably not induced by changes in rhizobial specificity during the evolution of the Medicago genus. Positions
of amino acid sites exhibiting an excess of substitutions
indicate that selection did not target solvent-exposed residues of the LRRs, but other sites, inside and outside the
LRRs. These results confirm that NORK has undergone

Taxa included in the analysis
We used the mRNA sequences of NORK orthologs in six
non-Medicago legume species available in the GenBank
database: Astragalus sinicus, Lotus japonicus (SYMRK),
Melilotus alba, Pisum sativum, Sesbania rotata and Vicia hirsuta (AY946203, AJ430101, AJ498991, AJ438375,
AY751547 and AJ428990, respectively). We selected 32
Medicago species for sequencing. Some of them can be
considered as models: M. sativa and its relatives M. coerulea and M. falcata are important crops. M. truncatula is a
model in several respects. M. noeana, M. laciniata and M.
monspeliaca possess specific rhizobial symbionts that are
not associated with other species. We sampled species to
represent different symbiotic groups defined on the basis
of rhizobial specificity documented in the genus Medicago
[18]. The material used in this study is listed in Additional
file 2, along with the accession numbers of sequences that
have been produced.
Sequencing procedure
One or two genotypes were selected for each Medicago species [see Additional file 1]. Total DNA was extracted from
100 mg of frozen leaves according to DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen) with the following modification: 1% of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 40,000) was added to buffer AP1.
A region of NORK located in the extracellular domain of
the protein was amplified and sequenced. Sequence and
genic localization of primers are displayed in Additional
file 3. For all species, amplification and sequencing were
performed as previously reported [12]. For species exhibiting a signal of sequence heterozygosity, sequence data
were obtained after cloning. In this case, PCR amplifications were performed using a proofreading DNA polymerase (Expand High Fidelity PCR System, Roche). The PCR
products were cloned using the pGEMT-easy cloning kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. One
positive clone per individual was sequenced in both directions with universal SP6 and T7 primers using a fluorescent sequencing system (BigDye Terminator version 3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applera) and analyzed on an ABI
PRISM 3100 semi automated sequencer (Applera).
Sequences were assembled and aligned using programs of
the Staden package release 1.6.0 beta 4 [33].
Tests of positive selection
Coding sequences were analyzed with the codeml software from the PAML package version 3.15 [34] under a
family of codon substitution models allowing for variation in the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio
(ω) among sites [19] or among branches [22]. We used
subsequent modifications of some of these models to

ensure adequate hypothesis testing [35,36]. We performed three different tests. The first one compares two
models allowing for variation of ω between sites but not
between branches (M8A and M8) and allows for testing
for the presence of sites under positive selection. The second one compares a fixed-ω (M1ω) model to a two-ω
(M2ω) model where ω is allowed to vary in a given predefined branch. We used branches 1–5 in Figure 1A which
correspond to putative ancestral changes in rhizobial specificity, and branch 6 which was noticed for having an
unexpected length. This test only allows verifying that the
two ω are different. The third test compared any two-ω
model (where ω varies in one given branch) to a version
where ω in the tested branch is constrained to one
(M2ωA). This test allowed testing whether ω in branches
4 and 6 was significantly greater than one. The statistical
tests of M8 vs. M8A, M2ω vs. M1ω and M2ω vs. M1ωA
were all performed with likelihood ratio tests with one
degree of freedom (each couple of models differs by one
free parameter).
