Abstract
Background: Correct identification of individual Hox proteins is an essential basis for their study
in diverse research fields. Common methods to classify Hox proteins focus on the homeodomain
that characterise homeobox transcription factors. Classification is hampered by the high
conservation of this short domain. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is a widely used but timeconsuming classification method.
Results: We have developed an automated procedure, HoxPred, that classifies Hox proteins in
their groups of homology. The method relies on a discriminant analysis that classifies Hox proteins
according to their scores for a combination of protein generalised profiles. 54 generalised profiles
dedicated to each Hox homology group were produced de novo from a curated dataset of
vertebrate Hox proteins. Several classification methods were investigated to select the most
accurate discriminant functions. These functions were then incorporated into the HoxPred
program.
Conclusion: HoxPred shows a mean accuracy of 97%. Predictions on the recently-sequenced
stickleback fish proteome identified 44 Hox proteins, including HoxC1a only found so far in
zebrafish. Using the Uniprot databank, we demonstrate that HoxPred can efficiently contribute to
large-scale automatic annotation of Hox proteins into their paralogous groups. As orthologous
group predictions show a higher risk of misclassification, they should be corroborated by additional
supporting evidence. HoxPred is accessible via SOAP and Web interface http://cege.vub.ac.be/
hoxpred/. Complete datasets, results and source code are available at the same site.

Background
Hox transcription factors are extensively investigated in
diverse fields of molecular and evolutionary biology. This
protein family is best known for its crucial role in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of animal embryos [1] and
in tetrapod limb development [2]. Hox genes actually
belong to the family of homeobox transcription factors

characterised by a 60 amino acids region called homeodomain [3].
Besides, the genomic organisation of Hox genes in clusters
is common to most animals. An ancestral Hox gene cluster, supposed to have arisen from tandem duplications in
early eukaryotes, has been retained in bilaterians. Hox
genes have diverged but the order of each gene along the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/247

cluster has been conserved. It is thus possible to assign a
given Hox gene by homology to one of the genes along
the cluster. Hox genes thus fall into one of the 14 known
Paralogous Groups (PG). The ancestral cluster has been
duplicated early in the vertebrate lineage (reviewed in
[4,5]). Mammals Hox genes are organised in four clusters
(Figure 1A) whereas teleost Hox genes (Figure 1B) are generally arranged on 7 clusters, due to an additional duplication specific to teleost fishes [6,7]. Lineage-specific gene
loss has subsequently occurred, leading to diverse presence/absence combinations of Hox genes (reviewed in
[8]). Cluster duplication have generated paralogues genes
that can be grouped in the previously defined PG, for
instance HoxA1, HoxB1, HoxC1 and HoxD1 genes belong
to PG1. However, each Hox gene of a vertebrate PG is different and will be referred in this study as Orthologous
Group (OG) (e.g. mouse and human HoxA1 belong to
HoxA1 OG).
The correct identification of individual Hox proteins is an
essential basis for their study in evolutionary and developmental research fields. Common methods to classify Hox
proteins in their group of homology rely on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis. These methods commonly focus on the homeodomain. Classification of Hox
proteins is thus hampered by the high conservation of this
short domain. Since phylogenetic tree reconstruction is
time-consuming, it is not suitable to classify the growing
number of Hox sequences. The goal of this work is thus to
design an automated procedure that classifies Hox proteins in their groups of homology.
The PROSITE motif databank [9] uses generalised profiles
that constitute a scoring system to detect a given motif in
new sequences. A generalised profile is a motif descriptor
equivalent to a linear hidden Markov model [10].
Although the homeodomain is represented in PROSITE,
Hox-specific profiles allowing the precise identification of
PG and OG groups have never been defined.

Hox clusters organisation in vertebrates
Figure 1
Hox clusters organisation in vertebrates. (A) mouse.
Hox genes are named following the nomenclature of [32]:
The four clusters are assigned to the letters A to D. Hox
genes have been numbered 1–14 on each cluster, as gene
order is conserved among clusters. (B) zebrafish. The duplicated clusters are specified with a lowercase letter (e.g. Aa,
Ab).

Here, we build Hox generalised profiles dedicated to each
PG and OG. These profiles are based on the homeodomain, as the Hox content of an organism is often surveyed
by PCR in this region. By using discriminant analysis, we
tackle the classification of Hox proteins in their groups of
homology, on the basis of their scores for a combination
of generalised profiles. Several classification methods are
investigated to select the most accurate discriminant functions. These functions are optimised and evaluated on a
curated dataset of vertebrate Hox proteins and finally
incorporated into the HoxPred program. By applying this
program on the Uniprot databank and on two teleost fish
proteomes, we demonstrate that HoxPred can efficiently
contribute to large-scale annotation of Hox proteins.

Results
Evaluation of the Hox-specific generalised profiles
We first evaluated whether Hox-specific profiles can be
used to classify Hox sequences in their correct PG and OG.
The HOX curated dataset (Table 1) was subdivided to produce 14 PG multiple alignments. A profile was then built
out of each alignment. We similarly grouped the HOX set
into 40 OG to build the corresponding alignments and
profiles.

Classically, the last step of a generalised profile construction is the normalization step that allows the computation of an E-value associated to each profile match [11]. A
theoretical cut-off value that separates spurious matches
from significant ones is then defined for the calibrated
profile. We performed this calibration step for the Hoxspecific profiles (Additional files 2). We observed that the
theoretical cut-off value is not appropriate to distinguish
proteins of a defined PG from other homeoboxes due the
high level of residues conservation in the homeodomain.
To evaluate whether each Hox protein can be discriminated by its dedicated profile, we determined the accuracy
of each PG and OG profiles in LOO. As an illustration, a
PG9-LOO profile is built at each iteration step from the
PG9 sequences of the training set, excluding one Hox9
sequence. This PG9-LOO profile is used to score a testing
set comprising the excluded Hox9 sequence as positive
reference and the non-PG9 sequences of the training set as
negative reference. The accuracy of the PG9-LOO profile is
calculated for each observed score. The cut-off value of the
PG9-LOO profile can thus be defined as the score maximising the accuracy. The PG9 profile mean accuracy is the
average of the best accuracies determined at each PG9 iteration.
We tested the effect of the substitution matrices used to
build the profiles by comparing the results obtained with
3 BLOSUM matrices. Figure 2 summarises the results for
the evaluation of all Hox-specific profiles built with

For Hox PG prediction, we performed a training with the
all-groups classification (Table 2, Figure 3A). The error rate
decreases as variables are incorporated and reach its lowest value (0.17%) for 5–14 variables. The error rates on
the permuted set are stable at 22% of errors, which corre-

Discriminant analysis based on generalised profile scores
We applied discriminant analysis with a view to predict
Hox PG and OG, on the basis of multiple scores obtained
with our previously produced Hox-specific profiles. As
profile thresholds are not taken into account in the discriminant analysis, we used Hox-specific profiles without
defining cut-off values. Each evaluation was performed in
LOO within a forward stepwise variable selection to prevent the risk of over-fitting and to define the optimal subset of profiles. We compared the results obtained with 4
classification methods (2-groups, all-groups, anterior/posterior and PG-groups) to select the most accurate method to
predict each Hox group. To conduct the discriminant
analyses, the prior probabilities were set to a very high
value (>99%) for the control (CTL) group and to 0,0001
for each Hox class.





























It is thus possible to distinguish the PG of vertebrate Hox
proteins with a reasonable confidence by using PG-specific profiles. Differentiating the OG on the basis of a single profile is, however, not suitable since the proportions
of false predictions are excessively high for some groups.
We therefore evaluated whether combining information
of several profiles could improve the discrimination
between highly similar sequences. As discriminant analysis proved efficient to combine information of positionspecific scoring matrices (PSSM) to classify genes on the
basis of putative regulatory elements [12], we applied this
method on the Hox classification problem. The major
novelties of this approach are the use of generalised profiles technology instead of PSSM and the application of
discriminant analysis to classify protein sequences.

Variable selection
Figure 3 displays results of the variable selection with LDA
method on the real or permuted dataset. At each iteration
of this analysis, a prediction function was built with an
increasing number of variables and the error rate was calculated. The error rates are plotted as a function of the
number of selected variables.




BLOSUM100. The accuracy for PG profiles (Figure 2A) is
very high except for PG3, PG6 and PG7 where the mean
value is nevertheless always above 80%. Figure 2B shows
that the mean accuracy for OG profiles is very variable,
even between OG belonging to the same PG. Most profiles
have mean accuracy values lower than 80% and the dispersion values are quite high. Results obtained with
BLOSUM65 and BLOSUM80 always showed lower or
equal accuracy values (data not shown).

sponds to a random classification in the CTL class that
exhibits the highest prior probability.
We applied the 4 classification methods for the training of
Hox OG prediction. For each method, a variable selection
step is performed to define the optimal subset of ordered
variables, as illustrated for the all-groups classification in
figure 3B. The error rate first decreases rapidly until 13 variables are incorporated, and then slightly oscillate around
3.5% of errors. The optimal discrimination is obtained
with 3% of errors (20 variables) for this type of classification. A random classification (permutated dataset) returns
error rates of 50% when all sequences of the training set
are predicted as CTL. It is interesting to observe the
increase of the error rate when more than 20 variables are
incorporated. This effect strongly suggests a situation of
over-fitting since training is performed with more variables (20–40 profiles) than elements in each class (less
than 20 sequences, Table 1).

Two CTL sequences corresponding to the homeobox
HM1_CHICK and HMSA_SALSA, were identified respectively as PG1 and PG7 in our analysis. By querying
HM1_CHICK with BLASTP [13] against the chick proteome at Ensembl, HM1_CHICK matches an Ensembl
gene prediction located near the chick HoxD cluster and
highly similar to HoxD1 genes of mammals. Even though
HMSA_SALSA is not annotated as Hox, this salmon
sequence has been previously considered as HoxA7 [14].
It is thus reasonable to consider these two sequences as
true Hox genes correctly classified by the discriminant
function but misannotated in the original database.
For OG predictions, we tested the 4 classification methods
and selected the method that best predicts all OG within
a given PG. In order to compare the performance of the 4
methods, we calculated the accuracy of each OG prediction with each method in LOO. Within each PG, accuracies of OG predictions were displayed on a radar plot so
that each classification method is represented as a polygon, as illustrated for PG3 in Figure 4. The most effective
method is thus represented as the polygon having the
larger surface. Table 4 summarizes the surface of each polygon for the 13 PG.

Contrary to PG predictions, no single classification
method is adequate to accurately predict all OG. Table 5
summarizes the selected optimal methods to predict OG
within each PG. Among several suitable functions within
a PG, the anterior/posterior classification method was
favoured to ensure a restricted number of functions to
manipulate. For Hox sequences of the posterior groups
(9–13), the OG sequences of PG10–13 are predicted with
a higher confidence by posterior method. Although PG9
belongs to the posterior group, its optimal method is PGgroups. For anterior groups (1–8), anterior classification
is the most accurate to predict OG sequences of PG1, PG3,
PG5, PG6 and PG8. Classification of sequences in OG
belonging to PG2 and PG7, however, shows better results
with the 2-groups method. Last, PG4 is the only PG exhibiting greater accuracy with the all-groups classification.
Single-profile technique versus discriminant analysis
To determine whether combining profiles yields more
accurate PG and OG predictions, we compared the accuracy in LOO of both single-profile technique and optimal
discriminant functions. As discriminant analysis classifies
all PG with 100% accuracy, we favoured this method over

single-profile technique. Similarly, the mean accuracy for
OG predictions is significantly higher for the discriminant
analysis (97%) than for the single profile technique
(81%). Figure 5 plots the accuracy obtained with singleprofile technique and discriminant analysis as a function
of the 40 OG. With the discriminant functions, all OG are
predicted with accuracy higher than 80%. We noted only
three OG (HoxA3, HoxA4 and HoxA13) where single-profile method is slightly more accurate. The few OG misclassifications observed are nevertheless confined to the
correct PG. PG2 predictions appear to be the less accurate,
mainly because mouse HoxA2 and HoxB2 homeodomain
sequences are identical. In PG3, the amphibian
B3_PLEWA is misclassified as A3 with a posterior probability of 0.5 while the proper identification as B3 has a
probability of 0.46. Likewise for PG9, the divergent fish
sequence D9a_ORYLA is predicted as C9 with posterior
probabilities of 0.5 and 0.49 for D9, the correct OG for

this protein. Conversely, misclassifications with a posterior probability of 1 are observed for the A4_MOUSE and
shark D13_HETFR sequences that are predicted as D4 and
A13, respectively. A4_MOUSE actually differs from
D4_MOUSE by only one residue and its vector of scores,
used to train discriminant analysis, is much more similar
to D4 group than A4 group.
In summary, the discriminant analysis provides a very
stringent function that classifies sequences in PG on the
basis of all PG profiles. A set of optimal functions predicts
OG with a high accuracy, on the basis of carefully defined
subsets of OG profiles.
HoxPred
The optimal discriminant functions were incorporated in
a program called HoxPred. To fully exploit the potential of
this program, the sequences submitted should contain

first extracted the homeobox sequences to reduce the
number of sequences to be analyzed with HoxPred. UniprotKB was thus first filtered with the homeobox Prosite
Profile PS50071 and the resulting 7155 Trembl sequences
and 1131 Swissprot sequences were then submitted to
HoxPred (Additional file 3). Except the misannotated
HM1_CHICK and HMSA_SALSA already mentioned
above, no additional false positive was detected since
non-Hox homeobox are correctly classified as CTL. Some
misclassifications are nevertheless noticeable, such as PG2
predictions or sequences identical to A4_MOUSE that are
all predicted as D4. We especially noticed the
HXD3_CHICK prediction as PG3/A3. While PG prediction is correct, the OG classification seems erroneous.
Multiple alignment of full-length PG3 sequences reveal
that HXD3_CHICK is more similar to A3 than D3, which
argues in favour of a misannotation of HXD3_CHICK.

The Uniprot databank comprises many short fragments
(<60 residues) produced by PCR surveys. As profile scoring-system is length-dependent, input protein fragments
for HoxPred should be at least as long as the profile (60
residues) and span the homeodomain. Despite this limitation, we observed that 98% of the complete set of 64
amphibian PCR fragments (39 residues) [15] is correctly
classified as regards to PG (Additional file 4). PG predictions seem thus quite robust to short fragments. Also,
69% of these sequences were correctly classified in OG.

sequence is scored by the 14 PG profiles. These scores then
serve as input for the PG discriminant function. Unless
the sequence is predicted as CTL, the program adjusts the
OG analysis to the optimal classification method for the
predicted PG. The output is a XML-formatted file that
reports the PG and OG predictions and their associated
posterior probabilities. This program is available as a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server.

Interesting results are obtained with non-vertebrate
sequences (Additional file 3). Indeed, positive predictions
encompass sequences of more distant deuterostomes and
protostomes. For non-vertebrate organisms, only PG prediction is meaningful as Hox genes are organised in a single cluster. Based on phylogenetic reconstructions,

Each value is the surface of the polygon that represents one classification method on a radar plot. The polygon is quadrilateral for PG containing 4
OG and triangular for PG containing 3 OG. For PG containing 2 OG, the value is the product of the 2 OG accuracies, for a given classification
method.

bilaterian Hox genes can be classified into four groups:
Anterior (PG1–2), Group 3 (PG3), Central (PG4–8) and
Posterior (PG9–14), according to their position in the
cluster and site of expression along the anteroposterior
axis [16]. Preliminary analyses show that HoxPred predictions are consistent with the commonly accepted Hox
homology relationships between vertebrate and more distant organisms [17] into these 4 groups.

Fishing Hox out of the Gasterosteus aculeatus proteome
In order to assess the potential of HoxPred for genomescale analyses, we applied HoxPred to the proteomes of
two closely related fishes: Oryzia latipes (medaka) and Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback). Proteomes were retrieved
from Ensembl v40, filtered with the homeobox Prosite
Profile PS50071 and then submitted to HoxPred. HoxPred predictions were then sorted by chromosome to
highlight the Hox clusters organisation.

For the medaka, HoxPred predictions are located on 7
chromosomes (Additional file 5, Figure 6A), which corroborates the 7 clusters organisation reported in [8].
Among the 48 Hox proteins reported in [8], 5 are absent
from the Ensembl gene predictions (HoxA7a, HoxC6a,
HoxB7a, HoxB8a and HoxD11b) likely due to gaps in the
genome assembly. HoxPred correctly predicts all 43
remaining Hox proteins with respect to PG and only 2 OG
predictions were erroneous. Indeed, the HoxD11 prediction located on the HoxCa cluster and the HoxA2 prediction located on the HoxBa cluster are misclassified and
respectively correspond to HoxCa11 and HoxB2a (Additional file 5).
In stickleback, HoxPred returns 45 predictions, which
encompass the 10 stickleback Hox genes previously identified in [18]. Predictions are consistent with a 7 clusters
organisation, except one Hox lying external to the 7 clusters (Additional file 5, Figure 6B). The homeodomain
sequence of this additional protein, predicted as PG13/
B13, is identical to the HoxB13a homeodomain. For the
44 remaining Hox proteins, HoxPred predictions were
validated by comparing them with the order of the corre-

sponding genes on the genome assembly. All Hox PG are
correctly predicted. For OG predictions, HoxB2a and
HoxC11a are respectively misclassified as A2 and D11, as
observed in medaka. Besides, genome assembly allows us
to locate a PG1/B1 prediction on the HoxCa cluster, at the
position of a potential HoxC1a. Phylogenetic reconstructions (Additional file 6) have confirmed that this protein
is a HoxC1a.
Actually, Hox organisation in medaka and stickleback are
highly similar with 40 OG in common. Among the five
Hox genes not found in the current medaka assembly but
reported in [8], HoxA7a and HoxC6a genes are present in
stickleback, but not HoxB7a, HoxB8a and HoxD11b.
Gaps in the stickleback genome assembly or fused gene
predictions in Ensembl may explain the absence of HoxPred predictions for these OG.

Discussion
Classifying Hox proteins in their groups of homology is a
time-consuming and complex task due to the highly conserved homeodomain. The goal of this project was to
develop an automated classification program that is
appropriate to classify the growing number of Hox
sequences. This program, HoxPred, relies on a method
that combines Hox-specific protein generalised profiles
and discriminant analysis to distinguish Hox PG and OG,
despite the high similarity between their homeodomain
sequences. Applied on a curated dataset of vertebrate Hox
proteins, HoxPred predicts all PG correctly and shows a
mean accuracy of 97% for OG predictions.
We first have shown that the single-profile technique
yields relatively good results for PG but global accuracy is
not sufficient for OG predictions. Generalised profiles can
be manually edited with a view to increase their discriminative power by modifying scores of diagnostic residues at
specific positions of the motif [11]. Defining diagnostic
residues specific to each group of homology is problematic in the case of Hox multigenic family [15]. As more
divergent Hox sequences become available, diagnostic

residues could be altered and it would require to individually re-edit up to 54 profiles manually. Consequently, we
opted for a global and automated approach, which combines profiles and discriminant analysis. Discriminant
analysis evaluation revealed a significant increase of accuracy for both PG and OG predictions compared to singleprofile technique. In addition, discriminant functions
avoid the need for profile thresholds. The combination of
profiles thus provides better information to distinguish
both Hox PG and OG. Restricting the number of profiles
is nevertheless essential to avoid risk of over-fitting.
As the evaluation was performed in LOO, the usage of a
non-redundant set of training sequences was mandatory.
Additional and divergent sequences would be valuable to
allow HoxPred to predict OG HoxA14, HoxD14, HoxC11,
HoxD10 and HoxB10. Indeed, these groups are represented by only one non-redundant sequence that cannot
be analysed in LOO. We tested both LDA and QDA methods and observed that LDA gave better results than QDA.
As previously suggested [12], this situation may be
explained by the small size of the training set. Moreover,
we tested more sophisticated SVM methods and obtained
classifications of lower accuracy, especially for OG (not
shown). To avoid misclassifications, we deliberately chose
a very high prior probability (99%) for the CTL groups.
Permutation tests clearly showed that predictions are randomly classified in the CTL group rather than in another
group. Although this choice of prior probability could
have had a cost in terms of sensitivity, we did not observe
false negatives due to misclassifications of OG sequences
in the CTL group. Rather, we observed that misclassifications are restricted to the same PG. Though often informative, posterior probabilities returned by the discriminant
function should be interpreted with care since we
observed some misclassifications with a probability of 1.
An automated homeobox classification method, PGnome, had previously been proposed [19]. It relies on
the determination of phylogenetically characteristic residues of Hox proteins in a guide tree. In order to compare
the performance of HoxPred and P-Gnome on Hox proteins classification, P-Gnome was applied to our HOX
dataset. With P-Gnome, only 27.2% of the HOX dataset is
correctly classified as regards to PG and 11.6% as regards
to OG (versus 100% and 96% respectively for HoxPred in
LOO). As the combination of characteristic residues
employed by P-Gnome does not take into account the variability brought by newly sequenced Hox proteins, we first
updated its training dataset and re-evaluate its performance. When trained with a bayesian phylogenetic tree constructed on our HOX dataset, P-Gnome correctly classifies
74.4% the HOX dataset in PG and 36% in OG. The quality
of the predictions was lower with a parsimony phyloge-

netic tree. HoxPred therefore performs significantly better
than this alternative automated method.
We demonstrated that HoxPred is appropriate to decipher
Hox proteins from whole genomes by applying it on two
telost fishes. Predictions were largely correct even though
teleost Hox sequences are known to be divergent consequently to additional duplication of their Hox clusters.
We characterized the Hox content of the recently
sequenced stickleback genome, based on Ensembl automatic annotation. No stickleback sequences were used to
construct the profiles for HoxPred. We identified 44 proteins belonging to 7 clusters and suggest that stickleback
comprises a HoxC1a gene, only found so far in zebrafish.
A PG13/B13 prediction outside of the clusters raises questions about the origin of the corresponding gene. As its
homeodomain is identical to HoxB13a, it could result
from a lineage-specific duplication of HoxB13a, further
displaced. Since the Ensembl gene prediction spans over a
gap in the assembly, more accurate predictions could be
achieved as the genome sequence is completed.
By applying HoxPred to Swissprot, we reassigned 2 proteins annotated as homeobox (HM1_CHICK and
HMSA_SALSA) to true Hox. HoxPred also detected a misannotation of HXD3_CHICK sequence that actually
belongs to HoxA3 group.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/247

of homology. Classification is thus hampered in species
where Hox gene clusters are desintegrated, such as in urochordates [21]. The application field of HoxPred could be
extended to bilaterians and more distant eumetazoa, and
could bring interesting insights for taxa where phylogenybased Hox classifications are indecisive.

Methods
Hox homeodomains training set
Vertebrate Hox protein sequences were collected from
phylogenetic studies in the literature (Additional files 1)
and the SwissProt Hox list release 49.7 [22,23] at [24].
Additional mammal sequences were retrieved from
Ensembl v40 with BioMart [25]. The 853 sequences of this
initial dataset were grouped by OG and aligned with ClustalX [26]. For each OG sequence, the homeodomain was
extracted. This homeodomain dataset was manually
curated by excluding partial, misannotated and lowerquality sequences. To avoid over-representation of subfamilies, we removed identical homeodomains among
each OG. The resulting dataset (HOX) comprises 250
non-redundant Hox homeodomains. A group of 250 random sequences (RANDOM) was generated by RSAT [27]
to display the same lengths as the 250 full-length
sequences of the HOX dataset. The third group (HOMEOBOX) comprises 618 vertebrate proteins from Swissprot
50.9, which match the homeobox motif Prosite:PS50071
[28] but are not annotated as Hox.

Conclusion
HoxPred correctly discriminates Hox sequences from
non-Hox homeoboxes, including the closely related paraHox proteins. This study indicates that HoxPred can efficiently contribute to a better annotation of Hox in
vertebrates. HoxPred is particularly appropriate for automatic classification of Hox proteins into their paralogous
groups. As orthologous group predictions show a higher
risk of misclassification, they should be corroborated by
additional supporting evidence. The computational time
for HoxPred (5 min on a PowerMac G5 2.5 GHz for 250
sequences) and its availability as a SOAP server allow its
integration in a workflow for large-scale Hox annotation.
The Hox content of many organisms is often analysed by
PCR surveys that produce very short sequence fragments.
We showed that HoxPred could help identifying PG in
PCR surveys. Besides, the application of HoxPred on a
wide range of organisms revealed that non-vertebrate Hox
proteins also matched vertebrate Hox-specific profiles.
Classification of Hox proteins is particularly challenging
for invertebrates and is being actively debated for evodevo model species such as those belonging to cnidarians
[20]. Cnidarian sequences have been described as highly
divergent Hox sequences, difficult to relate to the different
bilaterian Hox groups. The order of the genes on Hox clusters is valuable information for the classification in groups

Generalised profiles
Profiles construction
Generalised profiles [10] were constructed with the
PFTOOLS package, as described in [11]. Two types of profiles, hereafter referred to as 'PG profiles' and 'OG profiles', were developed. Sequences of HOX dataset were
first grouped into PG and OG and aligned with ClustalX.
Each sequence of the 14 PG and 40 OG alignments was
weighted by using the pfw program of the PFTOOLS package (number of shuffles per sequence = 2000). The
weighted alignments were converted into profiles with the
program pfmake in semi-global alignment mode. We
tested the BLOSUM65, BLOSUM80 and BLOSUM100
[29] substitution matrices to construct the profiles. The
program pfsearch performed the alignments of the profiles against protein sequences. This program was set to
return for each sequence a unique score assigned to the
optimal alignment.
Leave-one-out evaluation
Given the small number of non-redundant Hox homeodomains (often less than 5 by OG) (Table 1), we could
not consider dividing them into smaller subsets. To evaluate the accuracy of the profiles, we thus applied a leaveone-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure [30]. Each
multiple alignment, excluding one sequence, serves as

training set to construct the profile. This profile is then
searched against the testing set that comprises the
excluded sequence, the remainders of the HOX dataset
and the RANDOM dataset. The procedure is repeated for
all sequences of the multiple alignment. The geometric
accuracy is the statistic used to evaluate the performance

and profiles to a specific PG. Even if the number of profiles is reduced in the two latter methods, we performed
the variable selection step to limit the risk of over-fitting.

Discriminant analysis
We tested both the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to classify
the sequences in Hox PG and OG according to their scores
for the different Hox PG and OG generalised profiles. Discriminant analysis was performed with the statistical
package R [31]. We optimized the discriminant functions
and evaluated the predictive performance of LDA and
QDA as described in [12]. Briefly, a variable selection step
was performed within a forward stepwise procedure so as
to select the subset of ordered variables that are the most
discriminating. The predictive power of discriminant
functions was evaluated with a LOO procedure. The labels
of the training dataset were permuted to evaluate the rate
of correct predictions that the discriminant functions
returns by chance. For each discriminant function, 100
independent permutation tests were performed.

of the profiles. Accuracy =

Four classification methods
We defined four classification methods and systematically
compared the results obtained with these methods to
select the most accurate for each Hox group. A classification method is specified by the score matrix used to train
the discriminant analysis. Each protein sequence of the
training dataset is represented in the matrix by a profile
score vector, which length equals the number of profiles
to be used as variables in the discriminant analysis. Table
2 summarises the training dataset and profiles that were
used to constitute the score matrix of each classification
method.

First, the all-groups classification method consists of a single prediction function that directly assigns an element to
a Hox class (PG or OG) or to the control (CTL) class. The
second method aims at classifying the elements in 2
groups: the correct group versus the not correct group (e.g.
HoxA9 versus notA9). This 2-groups method produces one
prediction function for each Hox group. The third classification method restricts the analysis either to sequences of
PG1–8 referred to as anterior or PG9–13 referred to as posterior. Last, the PG-groups method restricts the training set
