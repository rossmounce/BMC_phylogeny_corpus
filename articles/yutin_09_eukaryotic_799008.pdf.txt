Abstract
Background: The Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) comprise an apparently
monophyletic class of viruses that infect a broad variety of eukaryotic hosts. Recent progress in
isolation of new viruses and genome sequencing resulted in a substantial expansion of the NCLDV
diversity, resulting in additional opportunities for comparative genomic analysis, and a demand for
a comprehensive classification of viral genes.
Results: A comprehensive comparison of the protein sequences encoded in the genomes of 45
NCLDV belonging to 6 families was performed in order to delineate cluster of orthologous viral
genes. Using previously developed computational methods for orthology identification, 1445
Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Groups (NCVOGs) were identified of which 177 are
represented in more than one NCLDV family. The NCVOGs were manually curated and annotated
and can be used as a computational platform for functional annotation and evolutionary analysis of
new NCLDV genomes. A maximum-likelihood reconstruction of the NCLDV evolution yielded a
set of 47 conserved genes that were probably present in the genome of the common ancestor of
this class of eukaryotic viruses. This reconstructed ancestral gene set is robust to the parameters
of the reconstruction procedure and so is likely to accurately reflect the gene core of the ancestral
NCLDV, indicating that this virus encoded a complex machinery of replication, expression and
morphogenesis that made it relatively independent from host cell functions.
Conclusions: The NCVOGs are a flexible and expandable platform for genome analysis and
functional annotation of newly characterized NCLDV. Evolutionary reconstructions employing
NCVOGs point to complex ancestral viruses.

Introduction
Viruses span approximately 3 orders of magnitude (~103
to ~106 nucleotides) in genome size and show tremendous diversity of virion architecture, size and complexity
[1-3]. Highly diverse viruses share homologous "hallmark

genes" encoding some of the key proteins involved in
genome replication and virion structure formation [4].
However, no gene is common to all viruses, so there is no
evidence of a monophyletic origin of all viruses, at least,
not within the traditional concept of monophyly. Never-

theless, large groups of viruses infecting diverse hosts do
appear to be monophyletic as indicated by the conservation of sets of genes encoding proteins responsible for
most of the functions essential for virus reproduction.
One of the most expansive, apparently monophyletic
divisions of viruses consists of at least 6 families of eukaryotic viruses with large DNA genomes including Poxviridae, an expansive viral family that includes major
pathogens of humans and other mammals. These viruses
infect animals and diverse unicellular eukaryotes, and replicate either exclusively in the cytoplasm of the host cells,
or possess both cytoplasmic and nuclear stages in their life
cycle (Table 1). These viral families have been collectively
designated Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses
(NCLDV) [5,6].

The NCLDV share some of the virus hallmark genes [4]
with other large DNA viruses such as herpesviruses and
baculoviruses. Examples of such shared hallmark genes
include the B-family DNA polymerases, DNA primases,
and Superfamily 2 helicases related to herpesvirus originbinding protein UL9. However, most of the NCLDV share
a considerable number of additional genes to the exclusion of other large DNA viruses of eukaryotes. Cases in
point include the Superfamily 3 helicase (typically, fused
with primase in NCLDV), the packaging ATPase, the
disulfide oxidoreductase involved in virion morphogenesis, and more. The existence of these signature NCLDV
genes, despite the notable connectivity of the virus world,
justifies the classification of the NCLDV as distinct, monophyletic class of viruses [5,6].

Generally, the NCLDV do not show strong dependence on
the host replication or transcription systems for completing their replication [7]. This relative independence of the
viruses from the host cells is consistent with the fact that
all these viruses encode several conserved proteins that
mediate most of the processes essential for viral reproduction. These key proteins include DNA polymerases, helicases, and DNA clamps responsible for DNA replication,
Holliday junction resolvases and topoisomerases
involved in genome DNA manipulation and processing,
transcription factors that function in transcription initiation and elongation, ATPase pumps for DNA packaging,
and chaperones involved in the capsid assembly [5,6].
Although only 9 genes were found to be conserved in all
NCLDV (with sequenced genomes), a considerable
number of additional genes are shared by diverse viruses
from multiple families. An evolutionary reconstruction
using a parsimony approach mapped approximately 40
genes to the putative common ancestor of the NCLDV [6].
Thus, it appears that the ancestral NCLDV already was a
complex virus that generally resembled the extant members of this group and was capable of relatively independent reproduction in the cytoplasm of the host cells, the
exact identity of the host notwithstanding [6,8].

In the last few years, the NCLDV attracted much new
attention owing, primarily, to the discovery and genome
sequencing of the giant Mimivirus that was isolated from
Acanthamoeba. At ~1.2 Mb, the Mimivirus and the closely
related Mamavirus possess by far the largest genomes of
all known viruses [9-13]. These viruses encompass the full
complement of conserved NCLDV genes but also possess
numerous genes homologous to genes of cellular organisms including several encoding translation system components. The unexpected discovery of these genes in the
mimivirus led to speculation on the origin of the giant
viruses from a putative "fourth domain of cellular life" by
genome degradation [14]. However, comparison of the
mimivirus gene repertoire with those of other NCLDV
combined with phylogenetic analysis of both conserved
NCLDV genes and the homologs of host genes encoded
by the mimivirus indicate that the Mimivirus is a bona
fide NCLDV and appears to be related to phycodnaviruses
and iridoviruses [6]. The homologs of genes of cellular
organisms, in all likelihood, were acquired in the course
of evolution of the mimivirus lineage, probably, from a
variety of distinct cellular sources; the same process of
horizontal acquisition of cellular genes occurred, on a
smaller scale, in all other families of the NCLDV [6,8,1518].

Very recently, another giant virus, named Marseillevirus,
was isolated from Acanthamoeba. Genome analysis of
Marseillevirus indicated that it represents a putative novel
family of NCLDV that appears to be distantly related to iridoviruses and ascoviruses [19]. In addition, comparativegenomic analysis revealed probable gene exchange
between Marseillevirus and Mimiviruses, emphasizing the
role of amoeba as a "melting pot" of NCLDV evolution.
An interesting new perspective on the NCLDV emerged
from the rapid progress of metagenomic studies. It turns
out that the DNA samples from the Global Ocean Survey
contain numerous sequences homologous to genes of all
known NCLDV families, except for Poxviridae and Ascoviridae, and possibly, representatives of new families as well
[19-23]. Thus, there seems to exist a considerable unexplored diversity of NCLDV that most likely infect various
unicellular eukaryotes but, possibly, also marine invertebrates [24].
As the number of available viral genomes quickly grows,
both challenges and the potential of comparative and evolutionary genomics of the NCLDV increase. A pre-requisite of an informative comparative-genomic study of any
group of organisms is an accurate delineation of the sets
of orthologous genes, that is, genes that evolved from the
same gene in the genome of the last common ancestor of
the compared genomes [25,26]. Accurate identification of
clusters of orthologous (COGs) is essential both for functional annotation of uncharacterized genes and for evolutionary reconstructions. The COG analysis has been
initially applied in a comprehensive manner, to all then
available genomes of archaea, bacteria and unicellular
eukaryotes [27,28], but subsequently, with the exponential growth of the collections of sequenced genomes, it
became more realistic to derive COGs for compact taxa
such as archaea or cyanobacteria [29,30]. The NCLDV,
with their large (on the virus scale) genomes consisting of
genes with different degrees of evolutionary conservation,
are in need of and amenable to the same approach. Here
we describe the construction of clusters of orthologous
genes for the NCLDV which we abbreviate as NCVOGs
(Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Genes) which
we intend as a platform for the functional and evolutionary analysis of new NCLDV genomes. We also report some
patterns of evolution of the NCLDV that can be inferred
from a preliminary analysis of the NCVOGs.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/223

All clusters were manually edited and annotated using the
results of RPS-BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches for the constituent proteins. Of the 11,468 (predicted) proteins
encoded in the 45 NCLDV genomes, 9,261 were included
into 1,445 clusters of probable orthologs (NCVOGs). The
overwhelming majority of the NCVOGs (1,268) are family-specific (that is, include proteins from viruses of only
one family) whereas the remaining 177 NCVOGs
included proteins from two or more NCLDV families (Figure 1). The distribution of the NCVOGs by the number of
viral species showed a qualitatively similar pattern where
the most abundant class included two species (thanks to
closely related pairs of viruses with very large genomes
such as the mimivirus and the mamavirus) and additional
peaks corresponded to large viral families such as Poxviridae or Phycodnaviridae with 6 (selected) representatives
(Figure 2).
Many of the NCVOGs include multiple paralogs from the
same virus that were recognized by the clustering procedure and assigned to the same cluster. As expected, paralogs were most common and numerous in viruses with
the largest genomes, namely, mimiviruses and phycodnaviruses (Figures 3, 4). In the same vein, the mimiviruses
and the phycodnaviruses made the dominant contribution to the 1,268 family-specific NCVOGs (Figure 5).
The 177 multifamily NCVOGs were annotated with
respect to the known or predicted functions and assigned
to several broad functional classes (Figure 6 and Additional File 1). Notably, the widespread NCVOGs consist
of genes that encode proteins involved in key functions of
viral replication and morphogenesis as is typical of viral
hallmark genes (Additional File 1). It is also of note that
among the 177 widespread NCVOGs there are virtually
none without an assigned function (at least in general

Results and Discussion
Clusters of orthologous genes for the NCLDV (NCVOGs)
In this works, we analyzed the annotated proteins
encoded in 45 NCLDV proteomes from 6 viral families
(Tables 1 and Additional file 1). These viral proteins were
partitioned into clusters of likely orthologs using a modified COG procedure (Ref. [30]; see Methods for details).

terms; Additional File 1). Thus, transfer of functional
information from experimentally characterized viral
genes to uncharacterized orthologs in other viruses yields
a fairly complete compendium of the core NCLDV functions.
Phylogenies of the core proteins of the NCLDV
As the number of genomes of cellular life available for
comparative analysis increases, the set of universal genes,
which comprised a small fraction of the genes even in the
original COG analysis [28], continues to shrink [31,32];
in large part, this is a consequence of non-orthologous
displacement whereby the same indispensable function is
mediated by unrelated genes in different life forms [33].
Non-orthologous gene displacement as well as lineagespecific gene loss seem to be important in the evolution of
the NCLDV as well, the result being that only a few genes
are conserved in all viruses of this class. In the present
analysis, only 5 NCVOGs included proteins from all 45
analyzed viruses, namely, the major capsid protein
(orthologs of vaccinia virus D13 protein), primase-helicase (VV D5), Family B DNA polymerase (VV E9), packaging ATPase (VV A32), and transcription factor (VV A2).
Given the previous conclusions on the origin of the
NCLDV from a single ancestral virus [5,6], we sought to
reconstruct the phylogeny of the NCLDV by analyzing the
phylogenetic trees of these highly universal proteins as
well as additional highly conserved proteins. The capsid
protein is not suitable for reconstructing NCLDV phylogeny: the sequences of the capsid protein ortholog in poxviruses (VV D13) are extremely divergent, resulting in low
information content of the alignment, and other viruses
encode multiple paralogs of the capsid protein). The
remaining 4 conserved proteins yielded phylogenetic trees

with somewhat conflicting topologies (Additional File 2).
Assuming that the conflicts were caused by tree construction artifacts rather than genuinely different histories of
different core gene of the NCLDV, we employed the consensus tree approach (see Methods for details) to reconstruct the putative NCLDV phylogeny using 10 trees of
genes that are represented in all or nearly all of the
NCLDV. Specifically, the phylogenies of the following 10
conserved genes contributed to the consensus tree: Superfamily II helicase, A2L-like transcription factor, RNA
polymerase A subunit, RNA polymerase B subunit, mRNA
capping enzyme, A32-like packaging ATPase, small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, Myristylated envelope
protein, primase-helicase, and DNA polymerase (See
Additional File 2).
In the best supported consensus tree topology, the
recently discovered Marseillevirus clustered with iridoand ascoviruses (the latter were confidently placed inside
the Iridoviridae), albeit with a low confidence; mimiviruses clustered with phycodnaviruses; and poxviruses
grouped with asfarviruses (Figure 7). Of the 10 trees that
contributed to the consensus tree, 5 displayed the same
topology, at the level of major branches (viral families), as
the consensus tree and 3 were compatible with the consensus topology (Approximately Unbiased (AU) test [34]
p-value > 0.05). The trees of the DNA polymerase and primase-helicase showed significant differences (p < 0.05)
from the consensus (see Additional File 2) according to
the AU test. In the DNA polymerase tree, phycodnaviruses
confidently grouped with the Irido-Marseillevirus branch,
in contrast to the phycodna-mimi clade in the consensus
tree. The primase-helicase tree was the "worst" in terms of
conformity to the consensus, with the unusual but

strongly supported Mimi-Irido-Marseille clade and moderately supported joining of asfarviruses to that branch
(compare the trees in Figure 7 and Additional File 2).
Given the propagation of mimiviruses and Marseillevirus
in the host (Acanthamoeba) [19], the recent isolation of
an asfarvirus from a dinoflagellate [35], and indications
from metagenomics that iridoviruses might infect marine
unicellular eukaryotes as well [21,23], horizontal
exchange of these essential genes among viruses from different families cannot be ruled out. Further investigation
of this intriguing possibility requires deeper genomic sampling of NCLDV and a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis (see also below).
We further constructed a different type of tree for the
NCLDV, one that was based on the comparison of gene
repertoires, more specifically, the patterns of representation of viruses in NCVOGs, also known as phyletic pat-

terns [36]. The trees were produced from the 15 × 1445
matrix of subfamily-level phyletic patterns using the
neighbor-joining tree reconstruction method and 4 different methods for distance calculation (see Methods for
details and Additional File 3). The topologies of these
gene content trees were generally compatible with that of
the consensus tree (Figure 3), indicating that the evolution of the gene repertoire of the NCLDV, largely, mirrored the evolution of the conserved core genes. However,
there was one notable exception to this congruence: in 3
of the 4 gene content trees, Marseillevirus clustered with
the Mimiviridae. This similarity of gene repertoires, most
probably, stems from the reproduction of these viruses in
the same host (Acanthamoeba) where the viruses repeatedly exchanged genes during their evolution [19].

Conserved genes and reconstruction of the evolution of the
NCLDV gene repertoire
We employed the consensus tree of the NCLDV (Figure 7)
to reconstruct the core gene repertoires of ancestral viruses
and gene loss and gain events during the evolution of the
NCLDV using the maximum-likelihood approach developed by Csuros and Miklos [37]. Using a likelihood cutoff of 0.9, we found that 47 genes mapped to the common
ancestor of the NCLDV and reconstructed progressively
increasing gene repertoires for other ancestral viruses (Figure 8, Additional Files 4 and 5). The ancestral gene repertoires were relatively insensitive to the likelihood cut-off
(Figure 9), an observation that seems to support the reliability of the reconstruction. Undoubtedly, these are conservative reconstructions because it is not feasible to
assign to ancestral forms genes that survived in only one
of the progeny lineages let alone those that were lost in all

extant lineages. Nevertheless, the reconstructed gene repertoire suggests that the common ancestor of all known
NCLDV possessed all the core functions characteristic of
this class of viruses. These functions include the basal
machineries for replication, transcription and transcript
processing (such as the capping and decapping enzymes),
enzymes required for DNA precursor synthesis (thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase), the two major virion
proteins, the central enzymes of virion morphogenesis
(protease and disulfide oxidoreductase), and even some
proteins implicated in virus-cell interaction such as a
RING-finger ubiquitin ligase subunit (see Additional File
4). A caveat is that some of these genes might have spread
among the NCLDV via extensive between-virus gene
transfer.
Some of the core functions are prone to non-orthologous
displacement among the NCLDV, sometimes showing
complex evolutionary patterns. A case in point is the DNA
ligase that is an essential activity for DNA replication. The
previous reconstruction of the ancestral NCLDV gene repertoire tentatively identified the ATP-dependent ligase as
an ancestral NCLDV gene [5,6]. However, entomopoxviruses, mimiviruses, and some of the iridoviruses lack the
ATP-dependent ligase and instead encode a distinct NADdependent ligase (of apparent bacterial origin) (see Additional Files 1 and 4). Furthermore, some poxviruses, such

as Molluscum Contagiosum virus [38], encode no ligase
at all, apparently, as a result of lineage-specific gene loss;
in such cases, this essential replication function is probably supplied by a host ligase. The present maximum-likelihood reconstruction mapped both ligases to the
ancestral NCLDV genome. However, phylogenetic analysis of the ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent ligases
yielded an unexpected result: the NAD-dependent ligases
of the NCLDV formed an unequivocally supported clade
whereas the ATP-dependent showed different phylogenetic affinities [39]. The conclusion, perhaps, a counterintuitive one is that the NAD-dependent ligase, of
bacteriophage or bacterial origin, is the ancestral NCLDV
gene that was repeatedly displaced by ATP-dependent
ligases in different viral lineages [39]. These findings
reveal inherent limitations of reconstructions of ancestral
gene repertoires based on patterns of gene presenceabsence.
Owing to non-orthologous displacement, some of genes
encoding (nearly) essential functions might not have
made it to the reconstructed ancestral gene repertoire. An
interesting potential case of such missing function is that
of phospholipase that is likely to be required for NCLDV
morphogenesis as well as for the escape of the virus from
the host phagosomes. A large subset of the NCLDV
including mimiviruses, Marseillevirus, and some phycod-

following 10 (nearly) universal NCVOGs: Superfamily II helicase (NCVOG0076), A2L-like transcription factor (NCVOG0262),
RNA polymerase α subunit (NCVOG0274), RNA polymerase β subunit (NCVOG0271), mRNA capping enzyme, A32-like

(NCVOG0211), primase-helicase (NCVOG0023), and DNA polymerase (NCVOG0038) (See Additional File 2). The branch
lengths and ELW values (shown as percentage points) are from a tree that was constructed from a concatenated alignment of
4 universal proteins (primase-helicase, DNA polymerase, packaging ATPase, and A2L-like transcription factor).

naviruses and iridovirsues encode a patatin-family phospholipase (Additional File 1) that has been implicated in
the pathogen-host interaction of intracellular bacterial
parasites such as Legionella [40]. In poxviruses, this phospholipase is missing but there are one or two paralogous
genes encoding a distinct enzyme of the phospholipase D
family which is part of the virus envelope [41] and is
involved in the formation of virus-specific vesicles in
infected cells [42]. It seems plausible that the ancestral
NCLDV encoded the patatin-like phospholipase that was
subsequently displaced by the unrelated phospholipase

D-like enzyme in poxviruses. Similar patterns of nonorthologous gene displacement are likely to involve additional NCLDV genes, emphasizing the inevitable conservative character of the evolutionary reconstruction.
The results of the evolutionary reconstruction indicate
that the common ancestor of the NCLDV already was a
bona fide virus of this class and, in particular, possessed
the same degree of independence of the host cell functions as the extant NCLDV. The NCLDV infect diverse
eukaryotes including a wide range of unicellular forms,

and moreover, remarkable diversity of the hosts is seen
even within some of the NCLDV branches; the relationship between irido-ascoviruses infecting animals and Marseillevirus that reproduces in Acanthamoeba is a case in
point (Figures 3 and 4). Thus, it appears most likely that
this full-fledged ancestral NCLDV evolved at an early stage
of eukaryotic evolution, prior to the divergence of the
eukaryotic supergroups, and that the radiation of the
branches of the NCLDV was a very early event as well. It is
tempting to speculate that this initial radiation of the
NCLDV occurred as a "Big Bang-like" event concomitantly
with eukaryogenesis [4], a model similar to that recently
elaborated for a completely different group of eukaryotic
viruses, the picorna-like superfamily of RNA viruses [43].

The actual genome size and complexity of the ancestral
NCLDV is a wide-open question. Clearly, the 47 genes
mapped to the ancestral genome in the present reconstruction comprise only the core of most highly conserved, essential viral genes involved in key functions.
Given that the ancestral NCLDVs undoubtedly reproduced in unicellular eukaryotes, and this type of host supports the propagation of extant giant viruses, such as the
mimiviruses [13,24], it cannot be ruled out that already at
an early stage of evolution the ancestral NCLDV genome
grew highly complex. Thus, the common ancestor of all
extant NCLDV even might have been a giant virus.

Conclusions
The goal of this work was to classify the genes from the
growing collection of the NCLDV genomes into clusters of

probable orthologs and in-paralogs in order to facilitate
annotation of newly sequenced viral genomes and analysis of viral evolution. It is our hope that the curated set of
NCVOGs will serve these purposes, in particular, with
respect to new giant viruses that undoubtedly will be isolated from unicellular eukaryotes in the nearest future.
The comparative analysis of the NCLDV genes showed
that only 177 of the 1445 NCVOGs include representatives from more than one virus family. An even smaller set
of 47 conserved genes was mapped to the common ancestor of the NCLDV by the maximum-likelihood reconstruction. This reconstructed ancestral gene set is robust to the
parameters of the reconstruction procedure and does not
dramatically differ from the ancestral gene set reconstructed previously on a smaller collection of viral
genomes and using a simpler, parsimony method [6]. In
particular, the inclusion of representatives of two additional virus families, the Ascoviridae and the putative new
family represented by the Marseillevirus, did not result in
an erosion of the reconstructed ancestral gene set. However, detailed phylogenetic analysis can lead to some revisions of the ancestral gene set as illustrated by the case of
ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent DNA ligases. These
caveats notwithstanding, it seems that the reconstruction

reflects the gene core of the ancestral NCLDV with a reasonable accuracy and indicates that this virus encoded a
complex machinery of replication, expression and morphogenesis that made it relatively independent from host
cell functions.

Methods
Construction of the NCVOGs
For the construction of the NCVOGs, we used 45 annotated protein sets of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA
viruses (NCLDV) (see Additional File 6; 5 closely related
Orthopoxviruses were not included).

The conceptual proteomes of Marseillevirus and Mamavirus were obtained by translation of the respective genomic
nucleotide sequences using the GeneMark software [44].
Other proteomes were downloaded from GenBank http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The complete data set consisted
of 11,219 protein sequences. The procedure of NCVOG
construction involved the following steps.
1) Ankyrin repeat-containing proteins were the most
abundant proteins in the data set (~400 proteins, or 3.5%
of the data set). Owing to the low sequence complexity of

these proteins, they produced large number of false-positive hits during similarity searches. These proteins were
removed from the data set prior to clustering.
2) All-against-all BLASTP [45] search and initial clustering
was performed using a modified COG construction algorithm [30]. At this step, 7,804 proteins were grouped into
1,571 clusters.
3) Multiple alignments of the initial cluster members were
constructed using the MUSCLE program [46]. The alignments were used to construct position-specific scoring
matrices (PSSM) for a PSI-BLAST search against the
NCLDV protein dataset. Hits with e-values below 0.01
were reviewed, and clusters were merged when appropriate.
4) Clusters were further manually checked and edited
using BLASTCLUST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/
ToolBox/C_DOC/lxr/source/doc/blast/blastclust.html
and RPS-BLAST [47]. As a result of these refinement procedures, 1,445 NCVOGs consisting of 9,261 proteins were
obtained.
5) The NCVOGs were manually annotated on the basis of
RPS-BLAST and PSI-BLAST hits of cluster members.
The NCVOGs are available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/
wolf/COGs/NCVOG/.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree construction
The sequences for phylogenetic analysis were aligned
using MUSCLE [46]. Poorly conserved positions and positions including gaps in more than one-third of the
sequences were removed prior to tree computation.

Maximum Likelihood trees (ML) were constructed using
TreeFinder [48], with the estimated site rates heterogeneity and the WAG (Whelan and Goldman) substitution
model [49]. The Expected-Likelihood Weights (ELW) of
1,000 local rearrangements were used as confidence values of TreeFinder tree branches. Phylogenetic tree topologies were compared using the Approximately Unbiased
(AU) test [34].
Consensus trees
Relationships between viral families
At the first step, relationships between the 6 NCLDV families (Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, Irido- and Ascoviridae, Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Marseillevirus) were resolved
by analysis of the 49 NCVOGs that included representatives of at least 4 of the 6 families (49 clusters; Additional
File 1). For these NCVOGs, ML trees were built from protein sequence alignments. Only 10 out of 49 NCVOGs
produced alignments and trees deemed suitable for fur-

ther analysis; the rest were discarded for one of the following reasons: there were too few (less than two)
representatives from one or more families; there were too
few (less than 100) conserved positions; one or more viral
families appeared non-monophyletic. All 105 possible
topologies corresponding to the relationships between 6
viral families were compared to the topologies of the 10
trees of individual conserved genes using the TOPD software [50]. The consensus topology (Figure 7) was supported by 5 of the 10 NCVOGs (HelicaseII, A2L-like
transcription factor (Pox_VLTF3), RNA polymerase A,
RNA polymerase B, mRNA capping enzyme) and was
accordingly chosen as the family-level consensus topology.
Relationships between species
At the second step, topologies inside Irido-, Phycodna-,
and Poxviridae were resolved as follows. NCVOGs with
high representation of family members (19 NCVOGs for
Iridoviridae, 12 for Phycodnaviridae and 43 for Poxviridae) were used to build ML trees from protein sequence
alignments. Two to four orthologs from other NCLDV
families or cellular homologs were used as the outgroup
for Iridoviridae and Phycodnaviridae; Poxviridae trees
were rooted between Chordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae. After discarding poorly conserved families (less
than 100 conserved positions) 17, 6 and 42 trees
remained for Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Poxviridae, respectively. The topology most compatible with the
rest of the family-specific trees was identified using the
Bootsplit method [51] and used as the consensus.
Full consensus tree
The topologies obtained at the first and second steps were
combined in a consensus tree. A concatenated alignment
of four proteins present in all 45 species
(D5_helicase_primase, DNApol_B, Pox_A32_pfam04665
and Pox_VLTF3) was used to calculate branch lengths and
ELW values for the consensus tree using TreeFinder [48].
Neighbor-Joining gene content trees from phyletic
patterns
Gene content trees for 15 NCLDV subfamilies were constructed as follows. Original 45 × 1445 binary presence/
absence matrix (genome-level phyletic patterns) was converted into the 15 × 1445 subfamily-level presence/
absence matrix by applying the logical OR operation
within a subfamily (i.e. a subfamily registers a presence of
an NCVOG if at least one genome of this subfamily has a
protein from this NCVOG). For each pair of subfamilies
the number of NCVOGs present in each of them (N1 and
N2) as well as the number of NCVOGs present in both
(NU) were computed. Then a gene content similarity
measure (s) was calculated as either s = NU/min(N1, N2) or
s = NU/sqrt(N1 × N2) and converted to a distance measure

(d) as either d = 1-s or d = -ln(s). Neighbor-joining trees
were constructed from the distance matrices using the
NEIGHBOR program of Phylip 3.66 [52]. Bootstrap values were obtained by 100 resamplings of the subfamilylevel phyletic patterns.
Reconstruction of gene gain and loss events during the
evolution of NCLDVs
Reconstruction of gene content evolution in the history of
the NCLDV was performed using Count software http://
www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/gene_content/
count.html[37,53]. The software infers gene gain, loss and
duplication rates on the branches of the species tree from
the 45 × 1445 matrix of genome-level phyletic patterns
using the likelihood maximization based on a phylogenetic birth-and-death model. The consensus tree (Figure
3) was used as the guide topology; the model assumed the
Poisson family size distribution at the tree root and uniform gain, loss and duplication rates. Inferred model
parameters include probabilities for each NCVOG to be
present in each of the ancestral nodes. The sum of these
probabilities gives a relatively robust estimate of the
ancestral genome size, whereas the specific list of the
ancestral NCVOGs is a subject to much uncertainty
because it might include multiple low-confidence families. Here we chose to report high-confidence (p > 0.9)
genes as the likely candidates for the ancestral gene set.
