Abstract
Background: Influenza A virus poses a continuous threat to global public health. Design of novel universal drugs
and vaccine requires a careful analysis of different strains of Influenza A viral genome from diverse hosts and
subtypes. We performed a systematic in silico analysis of Influenza A viral segments of all available Influenza A viral
strains and subtypes and grouped them based on host, subtype, and years isolated, and through multiple
sequence alignments we extrapolated conserved regions, motifs, and accessible regions for functional mapping
and annotation.
Results: Across all species and strains 87 highly conserved regions
(conservation percentage > = 90%) and 19 functional motifs (conservation percentage = 100%) were found in PB2,
PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS segments. The conservation percentage of these segments ranged between 94 - 98% in
human strains (the most conserved), 85 - 93% in swine strains (the most variable), and 91 - 94% in avian strains.
The most conserved segment was different in each host (PB1 for human strains, NS for avian strains, and M for
swine strains). Target accessibility prediction yielded 324 accessible regions, with a single stranded probability > 0.5,
of which 78 coincided with conserved regions. Some of the interesting annotations in these regions included sites
for protein-protein interactions, the RNA binding groove, and the proton ion channel.
Conclusions: The influenza virus has evolved to adapt to its host through variations in the GC content and
conservation percentage of the conserved regions. Nineteen universal conserved functional motifs were
discovered, of which some were accessible regions with interesting biological functions. These regions will serve as
a foundation for universal drug targets as well as universal vaccine design.

Background
The influenza A virus is a major threat to world health
and economy. The polymerase of this RNA virus lacks
proof reading activity [1], which gives rise to considerable
viral variability culminating in the 3 different types A, B
and C, in addition to many subtypes based on variations
in the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA)
surface proteins [2]. The influenza genome consists of
8 RNA segments and encodes 10 proteins including the
internal structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP),
and the two matrix proteins (M1 & M2) [3,4].

The surface proteins neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) have been studied extensively and the
antigenic variations in the these surface glycoproteins
are used to subtype influenza A. Additionally, three of
the influenza polypeptides are associated with RNA
polymerase activity (PA, PB1, PB2). The RNA binding
non-structural protein (NS) contributes to viral pathogenicity and plays a central role in the prevention of
interferon mediated antiviral response [3,4].
Genetic reassortment of the Influenza A virus within different hosts (including avian and swine), and antigenic
shifts and drifts in the HA and NA proteins, are the cause
of widespread pandemics in immunologically unfamiliar
populations. These have resulted in serious outbreaks and
pandemics, such as those of 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009
[5]. This change in genetic and antigenic composition, presents an ever-present challenge for the development of
influenza vaccines and antiviral medications.

Bioinformatics has played a major role in several
aspect of virology research; these include predicting viral
RNA structure [6], the structural and functional analysis
of viral proteins [7], and immunoinformatics to predict
epitopes and reverse vaccinology [8]. Such studies have
assisted the development of biomarkers for the diagnosis, staging, and prognosis [9] of viruses (for a review
see [10]). Additionally, computer-aided drug designs
have led to the identification and validation of drugs
[11] for many major viruses, such as HIV, influenza and
HCV [12], helping the world face the challenges of such
major viral diseases with a huge medical care burden
[13,14]. Molecular modelling studies have in addition
provided mechanistic explanations for such questions
like drug modes of action, virus-receptor interaction,
and virus-host interactions. In these lines of research,
conserved regions found in viruses, extrapolated from
multiple sequence alignments of different strains, were
essential in functional prediction through the identification of epitopes and motifs [15-17].
Several studies have addressed different aspects of the
influenza virus, its evolution, structure, and function
analysis, to delineate the molecular mechanisms of
pathogenicity and continuous resistance to immune
response. Several previous studies performed phylogenic
analysis and addressed the evolution of one or more
Influenza A viral segments [18]. Additionally, methodical analysis of the whole genome has identified cooccurrence of mutation networks and other properties,
such as relative codon usage (rscu) and codon usage
patterns (cup), as features of Influenza evolution [19].
Motif prediction in the HA influenza genes and proteins
has been previously conducted [17].
Our study is a comprehensive systematic comparative
nucleotide genomic analysis that complements prior
analyses and utilizes complete influenza viral segments
isolated from different hosts such as humans, avians,
swine, and a fourth group for all other hosts, that
belong to different HA and NA subtypes, and from different geographic regions and years. The main theme of
the current study is genome conservation among different strains. This is achieved by the utilization of all
available complete segment sequences from the NCBI’s
Influenza Virus Resource database in order to achieve a
reasonable comparative analysis between the main three
hosts: human, swine, and avian, to highlight regions that
could serve as targets for universal drug and vaccine
design. The need for high sequence conservation as a
prerequisite of efficient siRNA design for the Influenza
A virus has been highlighted previously [20]. The identification of conserved regions in the influenza M gene
has been previously reported [21].
In the current study, meta-analysis of the Influenza A
viral genome segments from different hosts, different

Page 2 of 10

subtypes, and different geographic regions is performed.
Genomic conserved regions across all diverse strains
and hosts are extracted by multiple sequence alignments
and the conservation percentage is calculated. An analysis of inter- and intra- host strains segmental genomic
variability of Influenza A viral segments for human,
avian, and swine hosts, and the GC percentage of the
segments in the different hosts, is also conducted. Completely conserved genomic functional motifs are identified and analysed through functional annotation. This
work will not only provide understanding of the natural
selection of the Influenza A virus, but will serve as a
foundation for gene therapy, and novel Influenza A universal drug and vaccine design to target highly conserved regions with crucial functions. Moreover, the
bioinformatics sequence analysis workflow that is presented and applied could be used for research into the
understanding of the evolution of viruses and the design
of universal drug targets.

Results & Discussion
Preprocessing and alignment of Influenza sequences.
More than twenty-two thousand complete segment
sequences of the Influenza A virus were downloaded
from the NCBI’s Influenza Virus Resource [22]. The
sequences downloaded for each segment from the NCBI
website for six out of the eight positive-sense RNA influenza segments are illustrated in Table 1. Sequences of
swine, avian, and human strains were grouped based on
the host; and avian and human strains were sub-classified
based on the variations in hemagglutinin proteins (illustrated in the sequence grouping in the material section).
The entire nucleotide sequences, in addition to each core
coding sequence for each segment (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M,
NS, HA, and NA), were compared. The MUSCLE 3.6
program [23] was used for sequential alignment of
human and swine strains, and this was followed by avian
strains sequence alignment. (The multiple sequence
alignment files of all hosts for each of the studied segments are available in additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.)
This enabled a comparison between human, swine,
and avian strains and a conservation profile of these studied segments is illustrated in figures 1 and 2. Conserved nucleotide regions in each of the studied
segments were extracted using the Bioedit program; and
the consensus sequences derived from the alignments of
Influenza A viral segments were calculated.
Inter- and Intra- host strains conservation and variability

Our approach in grouping the sequences according to
species infected/ host isolated from enabled an analysis
of inter- and intra- species conservation and variability.

of the influenza segments using the Plotcon and Infoalign tools results shows that swine strains are the most
variable (similarity plots illustrated in figures 1 and 2).
This result was expected, since the swine strains
can mix with both avian and human influenza strains.

The human strains are the most conserved except
in segment PB2, where the avian is more conserved.
The conservation percentage of the segments ranged
between 94 - 98% in human strains (the most conserved), 91 - 94% in avian strains and 85 - 93% in swine

strains (the most variable). On the other hand, intra-segmental comparisons reveal that the PB1 segment is the
most conserved in human strains (98.1%), followed by
PB2, NP, PA, NS, and finally the M segment. For the
avian host strains, the NS and M segments show the
most conservation (94.5%), followed by the PB1, NP,
PA, and finally the PB2 segment. In the swine strains
the M segment shows the most conservation followed
by the segments NP, PB2, PA, and finally PB1.
Identification of 87 conserved regions in the influenza
genome

Conserved regions were extracted by entropy calculation;
these were regions with at least 21 nucleotides in length
and a maximum of 2 mismatches. We identified several
conserved regions in the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS
segments. This approach has not identified any conserved
regions present in HA and NA segments. Additional file
7 represents each segment and the position and size

(length) of the conserved region. The mapping and position of each conserved region to each influenza genome
segment is illustrated in figure 3. We found 13 conserved
regions in segment 1, 25 conserved regions in segment 2,
18 conserved regions in segment 3, 14 conserved regions
in segment 5, 8 conserved regions in segment 7, and 9
conserved regions in segment 8. We have correlated the
biological functions of these conserved regions in the
Influenza A virus life cycle through the annotation of
conserved regions and motifs for functional motif identification (discussed below). Logo bars of the conserved
regions are shown in additional file 8. These logo bars
are useful visualization tools that signify conservation of
each position in the conserved regions. The logo bars are
ordered sequentially by segment and conserved region.
GC Percentage

The GC percent in the different Influenza A virus segments and in the different hosts are illustrated in Table 2.

* The second number is the GC %.
The conservation percentage for each species is shown and was calculated
using Infoalign from EMBOSS.

The average GC percent in PB2 was 44%, 42% in PB1, 44%
in PA, 47% in NP, 48% in M, and 43% in NS. The GC percent was highest in avian strains, followed by human
strains, which may reflect the adaptation of influenza virus
to the warmer host temperature of avians as compared to
swine and humans.
Identification of functional motifs and annotation of
conserved regions and motifs

In our analysis, sixor more nucleotide blocks that are
conserved completely (100%) in different Influenza a
viral strains, and across multiple hosts, were identified
as motifs. Our identified motifs are tabulated in Table 3.
The perfect conservation of these motifs suggests biological significance and a potential critical role in the
influenza viral life cycle.

The evolutionary conserved motifs found in four of the eight influenza segments, whose criteria are at least 6 consecutive nucleotides that are 100% conserved
in all the studied strains and the location of each motif on H5N1 Refseq. Sequences and length are shown.

We found 4 motifs in the PB2 segment; motif 2
(GAAACG) is repeated twice in the H5N1 reference
sequence; and motifs 2, 3, and 4 were previously identified as a conserved region involved in RNA packaging
[24]. Interestingly, motif 3 also partially overlaps the
nuclear localization signal (NLS). In segment PB1, four
motifs were found; motif 1 (ATGATG) is repeated five
times and motif 3 (GAGATC) is repeated twice on the
H5N1 reference sequence. In PA, two motifs were identified that overlap with RNA packaging annotations [24].
Segment M contains six motifs; motif 4 is the longest
(CTCACCGTGCCCAGTGA). In segment NS, three
motifs were found; and motif 3 (AATGGA) is repeated
three times on the H5N1 reference sequence.
Functional annotation of the conserved regions and
motifs was also performed by mapping of the regions
and motifs on the 3D structure. Structural mapping of
these conserved regions on the available influenza
domains from PDB revealed many interesting functions,
explaining their selection for conservation.
Three of the functional motifs in PB2 lie in conserved
region 12 and are expressed mostly on the surface of the
PB2 protein. In segment PA two functional motifs, with

genomic sequences (GAGGAGUG, UGAUUA), are
mapped to conserved region 18. They are mostly accessible
on the surface amino acids of the domain which interact
with the PB2 protein [25]. In the M2 protein, four functional
motifs with genome sequences (GGCCCCCUC, AAGACAAGACC, UGUCACCU, CUCACCGUGCCCAGUGA)
are mapped to conserved region 1, which encompasses the
proton ion channel as illustrated in figure 4a [26].
Analysis of many conserved regions in PB2 and PA
revealed that they are mostly on the surface and are
involved in protein-protein interactions. The same
applies to the NP protein. Interestingly, conserved
regions 5, 6, and 7 together form the RNA binding
groove (ElHefnawi et. al., submitted).
There are three large conserved regions (Cr2, Cr6,
Cr9) found on the NS1 protein [27] (PDB id: 3F5T)
that is expressed by segment 8 of the virus genome
(represented in figure 4b). They lie mainly on the surface of the protein and may play an important roles in
the binding of different molecules and ligands that contribute to the promiscuity of the NS1 in its immune
counterattack mechanisms. Clefts found in these conserved regions could bind to different immune system

including Swiss Prot and PDB sum were used for annotation.

components (Figure 4c). Cr6 contains four functional
motifs with sequences of (AGGTAGA, AGGATGTCAA
and three motifs of the sequence AATGGA). The
immune system interception functions of the NS1 protein are quite similar to those of the NS5A protein of
Hepatitis C virus that was shown previously to have different immune system counterattack mechanisms [28].
This is an interesting property of many viruses that
deserves further analysis.
Predictions of accessible target regions and mapping to
conserved regions

We have also assessed accessible regions and mapped them
to conserved regions to infer their potential use as drug
targets. Understanding accessible regions is a critical factor;
for example, at least half of the siRNA target region needs
to be accessible preferentially in the terminal ends. Therefore, the accessibility of the segments was calculated using

the SFOLD server. We located 324 regions on six segments
and mapped them to conserved regions (Figure 3). In PB2,
ten accessible regions mapped to conserved regions, in
PB1, 24; in PA, 16; in NP, 14; in M, 7; and in NS, 7. The
accessible regions, which overlap with functional motifs,
are presented in figure 3 and additional file 9.

Conclusions
This in silico study analyzed Influenza A virus genome
segments available in the Influenza A virus resource at
NCBI and grouped them according to host, strain, and
year to determine conserved regions across all species studied. The higher variability in the influenza sequences isolated from swine host suggests greater hazards in future
pandemics. The higher GC percentage of Influenza
sequences infecting avian hosts indicates adaptation to the
higher host temperature. The evolution of the influenza
virus is driven by adaptation mechanisms to its host.

Identification of highly-conserved functional motifs and
accessible regions of all sequences was obtained. Eightyseven conserved regions, nineteen functional motifs, and
many potentially accessible regions were identified. These
data on the Influenza A virus segments were utilized in
the optimal design of universal therapeutic small interfering RNA molecules. The complete workflow including the
siRNA design and selection figure will be presented in the
next publication(ElHefnawi, submitted) and can help in
other future drug and vaccine design.

Methods

Page 8 of 10

The above categorization of the sequences facilitated
the management of the data, allowed the identification
of diversity in the sequences based on the host and year
isolated, and helped in the determination of conservations amongst strains. This categorization allowed us to
conduct comparative mutational analysis in all segments
followed by the calculation of conservation percentage.
Such subtype classification according to the immunological nature of strains, and identification of the similarity
of structural proteins across strains, combined with subcategorization at the nucleotide level, will facilitate drug
design as siRNA data mining.

Collection of sequences

Complete sequences for all segments of Influenza A
virus were downloaded in groups using the advanced
database search at the NCBI’s Influenza Virus Resource
[22]. We utilized both the entire nucleotide sequences,
in addition to coding sequences for single segments
encoding the following proteins; segments PB2, PB1,
PA, NP, M, NS, HA, and NA. We utilized approximately
30,000 influenza sequences for the eight segments. The
number of sequences utilized from each segment is
represented in Table 1.
Grouping of sequences

To facilitate the analysis process we divided each segment based on the infected host as follows:
(A) Swine strain sequences
(B) Avian strain sequences were sub divided into the
following groups:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)

H9 and Mixed strains
H8, H7
H6
H4, H3
H1, H2
H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16

(C) Human strain sequences were divided into the
following groups:
1) H9, H7, H5
2) H1 strains were further subdivided, based on the
year of isolation, into the following two subcategories;
H1 strains isolated between 1918 and 2000, and H1
strains isolated between 2001 and 2007.
3) H2
4) H3 strains were further subdivided based on year
of isolation into the following three subcategories;
H3 isolated between 1968 and 1998, between 1999
and 2002, and between 2003 and 2007.
D) Miscellaneous: all other strains infecting species
other than avian, human and swine.

Alignment and conservation analysis
Multiple Sequence Alignments of whole Influenza segments

The program MUSCLE version 3.6 [23] was used to
align primary sequence groups. The resulting aligned
sequences were aligned by profile-profile alignment
using the same MUSCLE 3.6 program.
First the alignments were performed by aligning
strains isolated from the same host, as discussed above,
where avian strains were aligned separately from human
and swine strains. Second, human and swine strain
sequences were aligned, and the resulting file was
aligned with the avian sequence file, and then all other
host strains. This order was followed because human
and swine strains are generally more homologous than
avian strains. For similar reasons, the avian strains were
added before the other host species. Based on phylogenetic distances, such an order in the alignment
sequences enhances conservation finding and facilitates
the management of diversity in sequences.
Emboss Analysis

The BIOPERL [29] modules were used for automating the
analysis of the alignments using different tools from
EMBOSS like GeeCee [30], Logobar [31], Infoalign [30],
Cons [30] and Plotcon [30]. Scripts were written for each of
these tools and run under the Biolinux operating environment [32]. These scripts are available upon request. The consensus sequence for each segment was calculated using the
Cons tool from EMBOSS [30] and submitted to Genbank.
Inter- and intra- host genomic conservation analysis

Conservation and variability across the eight IAV segments in the different hosts was studied by plotting the
conservation of the alignments using the Plotcon tool
from EMBOSS [30]. Additionally, the Infoalign tool
from EMBOSS was used to calculate the conservation
percentage of the segments in the different hosts in
order to study inter-species and intra-host variability
[30] (Table 2). The GC % for each segment was also calculated using the GeeCee tool from EMBOSS as shown
in Table 2.

Conserved region identification

Conserved nucleotide regions were extracted using the
Bioedit program [33].

nucleotides. The results are tabulated in additional file 9
and the regions that map to conserved regions are highlighted in figure 3.

I- Entropy calculation

Mining for conserved sequences among the aligned
sequences was performed by determining the entropy of
regions with at least 21 nucleotides in length with a
maximum of 2 mismatches. Therefore, we defined an
area as conserved if 19 identical continuous nucleotides
were detected in all strains with an additional 2-nucleotide mismatch (total 21 nucleotides).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Multiple sequence alignments of the PB2 segment.
The Sequence collection, grouping, ordering, and alignment were all
performed as elaborated in the methods section, and conserved regions
and functional motifs of PB2 extracted from the alignment. Also, Logo
bars of the conserved regions, the conservation percent of each
conserved region, and average GC% were all carried out as elaborated in
methods. Separation of the alignments into the four main host
categories (human, swine, avian, and others) was conducted to facilitate
comparative host analysis as elaborated in figures 1 and 2. The same
applies to additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

II-Conservation mapping

Entropy calculation was followed by checking the number of mismatches in each of our identified conserved
regions. The conserved regions were mapped to the 8
segments on the influenza virus as illustrated in figure 3
and additional file 7.
Logo bars for all conserved regions were generated
using the logo bar tool (additional file 8). The conservation percent of every conserved region was calculated
using Infoalign from EMBOSS [30] and tabulated in
additional file 7.

Additional file 2: Multiple sequence alignments of the PB1 segment.
Additional file 3: Multiple sequence alignments of the PA segment.
Additional file 4: Multiple sequence alignments of the NP segment.
Additional file 5: Multiple sequence alignments of the M segment.
Additional file 6: Multiple sequence alignments of the NS segment.
Additional file 7: Conserved regions in the Influenza A viral
segments. The position, length, conservation percent of each conserved
region is shown.
Additional file 8: Logobars of conserved regions. Eighty-seven
logobars of conserved regions are shown sequentially. The columns with
full information bits are the conserved ones, and those with partial
information bits are variable.

Functional motifs identification and annotation of
conserved regions and motifs

One-hundred-percent conserved motifs of a minimum
length of 6 bp in all IAV segments were extracted using
the BIOEDIT program [33]. The motifs were mapped to
the H5N1 reference genome, and to the conserved regions
(Table 3). Also, the H5N1 avian flu reference sequence
was checked for other occurrences of these motifs. The
perfect conservation of these motifs suggests biological
significance and a potential role in the Influenza life cycle.
Functional annotation of the conserved regions and
functional motifs was performed after mapping them on
the PDB 3D protein files of their segments, and using
annotations available for these proteins from the PDB
SUM server [34]. After downloading the relevant structure files we highlighted the conserved regions on the
structure to show their positions and configuration.
Then we used the annotation knowledge gained from
the PDBsum for linking the regions with their correlated
functions. The annotation at the genome level was performed using Rfam in order to search for conserved
regions in RNA structures with specific annotations.
Genomic accessibility forRNAi-based therapeutic design

The SFOLD tool was used to calculate the target accessibility of the Influenza segments using the consensus
sequence for each segment calculated from the multiple
sequence alignment [35]. A region was considered
accessible if at least the average single stranded probability using Sfold was greater than 0.5 for 9 consecutive

Additional file 9: Accessible regions and their mappings to
conserved regions. All accessible regions that were generated using
SFOLD (as elaborated in the methods) were tabulated in sheet 1, and
their mapping on the conserved regions is tabulated in sheet 2.
