At last, a Pennsylvanian stem-stonefly
(Plecoptera) discovered

Abstract
Background: Stem-relatives of many winged insect orders have been identified among Pennsylvanian fossils
(Carboniferous Period). Owing to their presumed ‘basal’ position in insect phylogeny, stoneflies were expected to
occur at this period. However, no relative has ever been designated convincingly.
Results: In this paper, we report specimens belonging to a new fossil insect species collected from the Tupo
Formation (Pennsylvanian; China). The wing venation of Gulou carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. exhibits character states
diagnostic of the order Plecoptera, but lack character states shared by unequivocal representatives of the order.
Derived from this identification, the delimitation of the fossil species is ascertained based on comparison of several
extant stonefly species. This comparative analysis allowed a trait present in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov., but rarely
occurring in extant species, to be documented and highlighted as atavistic. Affinities of taxa formerly proposed as
putative stem-stoneflies are reconsidered in the light of the new discovery.
Conclusions: Gulou carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is considered the only genuine Plecoptera reported from the
Pennsylvanian. Continuing efforts on the systematics of Pennsylvanian winged insects indicate a fauna more
diverse than previously appreciated. It suggests that insects already had a long, yet undocumented, history by this
time.

Background
Investigating the early evolution of winged insects (Pterygota) is a thrilling, yet challenging, endeavour. The earlier entomofaunas are documented based on only a few
localities of the Pennsylvanian (Carboniferous Period; c.
320 Ma [1,2]). These entomofaunas differ substantially
from extant ones in the relative abundance of major
taxa, among other aspects. The main components are
extinct (e.g., Palaeodictyopteroidea), and stem relatives
of not-so-diverse groups such as Orthoptera (i.e. grasshoppers, crickets & wetas), Odonata (i.e. dragonflies &
damselflies), Grylloblattida (or -odea; i.e. ice- or rockcrawlers), and Dictyoptera (cockroaches, termites &
mantises, and stem-relatives) [1,3]. In addition, several
groups (e.g., ‘paoliids’) are yet of uncertain affinities at
the ordinal level [4]. Recently, a stem-Amphiesmenoptera/Antliophora (caddisflies, butterflies & moths/true

flies, scorpionflies, fleas) [5] and a stem-Coleoptera (beetles; [6]), were identified. The relative low number of
known Pennsylvanian holometabolous insects contrasts
sharply with the extant mega-diversity of these groups
[1].
Provided the reported occurrences and phylogenetic
hypotheses [7,8], stem-Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps)
and stem-Plecoptera (stoneflies) should occur in Pennsylvanian samples. However, no bona fide fossils have
ever been documented.
The oldest entomofauna from China, namely the
‘Qilianshan entomofauna’, was discovered at the locality
of Xiaheyan Village (Zhongwei City, Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, China). Recent investigations on
this Pennsylvanian material recovered the expected
Palaeodictyopteroidea [9], stem-Orthoptera [9-11], stemOdonata [12,13], stem-Grylloblattida [14,15], and stemDictyoptera [16,17]. Based on new specimens from this
locality, we report a new species, comparatively uncommon and tiny. According to following comparative analysis, it is concluded that this is the earliest stonefly

Type genus: Gulou Béthoux, Cui, Kondratieff, Stark

Diagnosis: By monotypy, see that of the type genus.
Remark: The type-species of the type-genus, Gulou
carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is easily distinguished
from all known stonefly taxa. In particular, in forewings, no other stonefly taxon lacks the ra-rp specialized cross-vein and possesses a branched MP (and
see species-level diagnosis, and Discussion section;
[18-21]). Therefore it cannot be assigned to any
known family and genus, and the erection of new
ones is well-granted. It appears unnecessary to erect
taxa of super-familial and infra-ordinal ranks at this
time.

Ordinal assignment

For W. Hennig, “the smaller the number of derived
characters common to fossils and recent species, the
more doubtful is the assignment of fossils to the stemgroup of the Plecoptera” [22]. Indeed ordinal assignment
of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is not immediately
apparent. A discussion of the affinities of G. carpenteri
gen. et sp. nov. with respect to stem-Grylloblattida,

Page 5 of 12

then to Plecoptera is presented for clarification. Only a
few diagnostic characters have been established for the
stem-Grylloblattida (also referred to as Protoperlaria
and Paraplecoptera; see below). Among these characters,
in forewing, ‘CuA divided into two main stems near the
wing base, with the posterior stem (CuA2) simple’ [23].
This character is absent in G. carpenteri gen. et sp.
nov., in which CuA is distally branched (Figures 1, 2).
Another character referred to stem-grylloblattids is the
forewing ‘arculus’ [23], herein interpreted as a strong
cross-vein [24]. Such an arculus was observed in 15 specimens, including CNU-NX1-143, 144, 141, 140, 146
(Figures 1A, C, D, 2A, G, H, respectively). However the
arculus is also a trait consistently occurring in stonefly
forewings [24]. Prothoracic winglet-like lobes have been
reported in most Palaeozoic stem-grylloblattids [21], but
are absent in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. (Figures 1A,
B, D, 2G). However, the polarity of this character is not
evident: (1) if the possession of winglet-like lobes is a
symplesiomorphy shared by stem-grylloblattids and a
number of other Pennsylvanian lineages such as Palaeodictyopteroidea, its lack in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov.
excludes relationships with stem-grylloblattids; (2) if the
possession of winglet-like lobes is a secondary, derived
condition in stem-grylloblattids [25], its lack in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is inconclusive, because the species could equally be interpreted as a very ‘basal’ stemGrylloblattida. However there is no evident ground for
this option. Instead the presence of an arculus, of ScP
reaching RA, of a simple MA, and of a broad MP/CuA
and CuA/CuP areas in forewings (Figures 1, 2), clearly
indicate affinity with the Plecoptera (ScP reaches the
anterior wing margin in some Antarctoperlaria only
[18], but according to current phylogenetic schemes
[26,27], it must be considered as an apomorphy within
Plecoptera). In addition the basal area between M, CuA,
and the arculus is free of cross-veins (Figures 1A, 2H),
unlike in Grylloblattida possessing an arculus [3], but as
in all Plecoptera [3,18]. Hind wings provide additional
support to this ‘Plecoptera hypothesis’. The occurrence
of a hind wing arculus (Figure 1A, D, E) is shared by
Plecoptera [18,19] and extant Dictyoptera [24,28], but is
absent in Grylloblattida [29]. Although systellognathan
Plecoptera possess a branched CuA, representatives of
the clade Antarctoperlaria and Euholognatha have this
vein simple [18,19], indicating that it is the ancestral
condition in Plecoptera, shared with G. carpenteri gen.
et sp. nov. In contrast most Grylloblattida (and Dictyoptera [24,28,30]) have CuA branched. Finally the
character ‘ScP reaching RA’ is a plecopteran feature [18]
present in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. and absent in
Grylloblattida [29]. Another character of interest is the
number of tarsal segments, known to equate three in
Plecoptera ([1,31]). However, the preservation of the

Béthoux et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/248

available material of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. does
not allow a conclusive statement on this character (Figure 2C-F), although a tarsus with more than four segments is very unlikely. In contrast stem-Grylloblattida
possess the plesiomorphic condition, viz. a 5-segmented
tarsus [32].
Comparison with the few genuine Permian stem-Plecoptera, which are likely to be plesiotypic with respect
to their extant relatives, provides additional support to
our hypothesis: Palaeoperla exacta Sharov, 1961 and
Perlopsis filicornis Martynov, 1940 [20,21], both known
from forewings only, share with G. carpenteri gen. et
sp. nov. a very basal origin of RP, an area between RA
and RP narrow for a long distance, and CuA with a few
and very distal branches. These similarities strongly suggest that G. carpenteri is a stem-Plecoptera. The confirming character states of the above are, in forewing:
ScP reaching RA; occurrence of an arculus; area
between M and CuA, basal of the arculus, free of crossveins; MA simple; CuA with a few distal branches;
broad MP/CuA and CuA/CuP areas (Figures 1, 2); and
in hind wing: ScP reaching RA; occurrence of an arculus; CuA simple (Figure 1A, D).
Gulou carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. exhibits several plesiomorphies with respect to other Plecoptera (fossil or
extant), notably its branched MP in forewing (simple in
other stoneflies). It must be noticed however that a
branched MP was observed as a rare trait in three of
the four surveyed extant species (Figure 3). It can be
interpreted as an atavism that reinforces the ‘Plecoptera
hypothesis’. The hind wing of G. carpenteri gen. et sp.
nov. is also plesiomorphic in that RP does not fuse with
MA (Figure 1D, E), unlike in other Plecoptera [18].
Finally the abundance of cross-veins in both fore- and
hind wing, contrasting with the few generally occurring
in stoneflies [18,19,21], and the lack of specialized ra-rp
cross-vein, are also plesiomorphic conditions observed
in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. (Figures 1, 2). The
combination of character states exhibited by G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is therefore unique, and supports
the establishment of a new family, genus and species.
Gulou carpenteri species delimitation

Fossil specimens listed above are assigned to this single
species. The observed variation is limited to wing size
and aspect ratio, and traits of wing venation. Size variation falls within the range intra-specific variation as
observed in the surveyed extant stoneflies: males are
consistently smaller than females (up to 75% of female
wing length; Figure 3). In addition differences in size
and aspect ratio have been amplified by sediment deformation (obvious in Figure 2A), earlier reported for the
locality [10,15,16]. Owing to its size, the holotype specimen CNU-NX1-143 is probably a female. Variation in

Page 6 of 12

venation is limited to the number of RP, MP, and CuA
branches. The number of RP branches varies from six to
eight. Although count of RP branches can be complicated in species of the genus Pteronarcys (Pteronarcyidae) by the occurrence of apical ‘veinlets’ that could
either be cross-veins or actual main vein branches (Figure 3I, M, O-P, blue dots and numbers), observation of
Acroneuria (Perlidae) material provides a conclusive
clue (cross-veins are almost completely absent in the
apical area; Figure 3A-H): a variation of four to seven
branches was observed in the Nearctic A. abnormis
(Newman) and A. carolinensis (Banks), indicating that
variation observed among fossil specimens appears
limited.
The number of MP branches ranges from two to three
among specimens of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. (Figures 1, 2), but a similar range was observed in three of
the surveyed extant stoneflies species (Figure 3, red
dots), often at the intra-individual level (Figure 3B-C,
3I-J, K-L, O-P; albeit a two-branched MP is a rare feature in each case). Regardless, the fossil specimen
assigned to G. carpenteri and reproduced in Figure 2A
exhibits a three- and two-branched MP in the right and
left forewings, respectively.
Regarding branches of CuA, the range of variation is
difficult to determine in G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov.
because of terminal ‘veinlets’ that could either be a
cross-vein or an actual CuA branch. However, it is
mostly restricted to two to three, rarely four, which is
minimal in regard of variability observed in other traits,
and in extant material.
Only a few specimens of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov.
were available for study and it is not unlikely that intraspecific variability in this species is under-estimated.
Rare connection of the anterior branch of CuA with MP
(variable trait in A. carolinensis; arrows on Figure 3E-H),
and connection of MA with RP (variable trait in P. californica; arrows on Figure 3I-J) could be observed in G.
carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. if more material is
discovered.

Discussion
Gulou carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is assigned to a Pennsylvanian stem-Plecoptera. This species is therefore the
earliest representative of this lineage, previously documented as early as the Lower Permian [33-35]. It allows
a reconsideration of the long-lasting hypothesis of close
relationships of Plecoptera with stem-Grylloblattida.
Indeed taxon names such as ‘Protoperlaria’, erected by
R. J. Tillyard [36], in reference to the holotype of the
type-species of the Permian family Lemmatophoridae,
are indicative of these presumed affinities. Eighty years
later, a photograph of the very same specimen is reproduced by D. Grimaldi and M. S. Engel [1], who indicate

that the corresponding species and some others “were
primitive relatives of modern stoneflies”. According to
the taxon name itself, ‘Protoperlaria’ is perceived as the
stem-group from which emerged Plecoptera and is
therefore paraphyletic.
Sharov’s ‘Paraplecoptera’ [37,38] is another taxon
name for a similar ‘wastebasket group’ from which Plecoptera presumably diverged [39]. Basically, J. KukalováPeck followed this option [40]. And according to its
composition, Storozhenko’s ‘Grylloblattida’ is similar to
the Protoperlaria and Paraplecoptera [23,29]. However,
apart from superficial similarity and symplesiomorphies,
ground for this hypothesis is limited. Literature of the
20 th century was aptly summarized by W. Hennig:
“Sharov’s Paraplecoptera are very probably an ‘invalid
stem-group’ [...]. It is not clear whether they include any
species that actually belong to the stem-group of the
Plecoptera” [22].
Among recent accounts, a paraphyletic Grylloblattida
including Plecoptera has been proposed [2]. According
to A. P. Rasnitsyn, one of the authors of this collegial
contribution, Grylloblattida and Plecoptera, in addition
to Dermaptera (earwigs) and Embioptera (webspinners),
form a Perlidea superorder [32]. Elsewhere (Figure one
in [2]; and Figure 4A), Grylloblattida is represented as
paraphyletic, ‘giving birth’ to Plecoptera, Dermaptera,
and Embioptera. It tends to indicate that the taxa ‘Grylloblattida’ and ‘Perlidea’ are synonyms then. In the same
collegial contribution S. Y. Storozhenko [23] stated that
synapomorphies of the order Grylloblattida are “absent
because of paraphyletic state of the order in respect to
other perlideans [ = stoneflies]”. But (1) this author provided no indication about the specific grylloblattid taxon
that gave rise to the Plecoptera, and (2) it is unclear
how paraphyly can prevent a taxon from possessing
apomorphies shared with its ‘side-descendants’. Additionally, in the same contribution, A. P. Rasnitsyn dealt
with the synapomorphies of Perlidea and stated that
“grylloblattideans might take an ancestral state in
respect to Gryllidea and so might have no synapomorphies on their own” [32]. In summary ‘Grylloblattida’ is
paraphyletic at an uncertain super-ordinal level and possesses no apomorphy that could have allowed Plecoptera
to be assigned to this group.
More recently D. S. Aristov and A. P. Rasnitsyn [25]
suggested that the Permian family Tillyardembiidae is
sister-group related to Plecoptera, forming a clade
whose sister-group is the Pennsylvanian family Spanioderidae. This clade would belong to a paraphyletic order
Eoblattida excluding Grylloblattida, both taxa belonging
to a large superorder Perlidea (Figure 4B). In other
words, Plecoptera would have no direct connection with
Grylloblattida, and Eoblattida would no longer include
orthopterans.

Figure 4 Recent phylogenetic hypotheses on the position of
Plecoptera with respect to fossil taxa (tentative ‘cladisticinspired’ representations). A, According to various authors [2]; B,
According to D. S. Aristov and A. P. Rasnitsyn [25].

D. S. Aristov and A. P. Rasnitsyn [25] excluded the
Tillyardembiidae from the Grylloblattida, and consider
the family to be more closely related to Plecoptera and
Spanioderidae instead. The rationale of these authors is
not supported due to numerous inconsistencies. For
example they stated that “Tillyardembiidae are similar to
Spanioderidae in having [...] [a] late forking of M” (p.
260), but their Figure thirteen illustrates a Spanioderidae
with “M forks as basal as basal third of wing”, a trait
stated as limited to Grylloblattida and thus excluding
the Tillyardembiidae from this taxon (p. 259). In other
words, the Tillyardembiidae are excluded from Grylloblattida and are considered more closely related to Spanioderidae based on this trait absent in the
Grylloblattida. The statement “RS [RP] runs only moderately close to R [RA]” is one of “most of the [...] characters [...] shared with Tillyardembiidae [and
Spaniodearidae]” is obviously contradicted by “Tillyardembiidae differs from Spanioderidae in having RS [RP]
well distant from R [RA]” (p. 260). It is also stated that
“Tillyardembiidae are similar to Spanioderidae in having

Béthoux et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/248

[...] CuA with a backward comb”. However this trait
occurs in a large number of Grylloblattida [21,29], but
also in many ‘Eoblattida’ other than Spanioderidae,
according to the recent account by A. P. Rasnitsyn and
D. S. Aristov [41] (p. 13): “The type genus Eoblatta
Handlirsch, 1906 [...] is the unquestionable centre surrounded with the similar and putatively closely related
taxa including Stenoneura Brongniart, 1893, Anegertus
Handlirsch, 1911, [...], and others. All of them share [...]
[a] CuA [...] forming a backward comb”).
D. S. Aristov and A. P. Rasnitsyn [25] also argue that
“M and MP de-sclerotized in vicinity of the fork is
known for the Palaeozoic stoneflies” and that it constitutes a similarity between Tillyardembiidae and stoneflies
(p. 262). However this ‘weak sclerotization’ of the stem of
M and of MP is present in grylloblattids also [23]. In
addition, in stoneflies, this ‘desclerotization’ is indeed a
fold running in the area between R and M, crossing MA
(e.g. in Pteronarcyidae, Perlidae) or not (e.g. in Gripopterygidae), and that can cross branches of RP distally (e.g. in
Pteronarcyidae); only in a few cases (e.g. in Taeniopterygidae) this fold does run close to the stem of M and abut
on MA (i.e. never approximates MP) [42] (Figure 3).
Therefore the ‘stonefly r-m fold’ and the ‘grylloblattid
desclerotized M & MP’ (present in the Tillyardembiidae)
have different locations. In addition a similar fold, located
along M (or MP), occurs in many neopteran insects,
including Neuroptera (lacewings, owlflies, and antlions)
[42]. Therefore this character is not conclusive on relationships of Plecoptera with Tillyardembiidae and Grylloblattida. Unfortunately this character could not be
observed on the available material of G. carpenteri gen.
et sp. nov. The only trait that is objectively shared
between Spanioderidae (and a number of other stemOrthoptera), Tillyardembiidae, G. carpenteri gen. et sp.
nov., and Plecoptera is ‘ScP reaching RA’. However, several stem-Orthoptera (or ‘Eoblattida’), as well as all
Palaeozoic and most extant saltatorian Orthoptera, lack
this trait [43-47], suggesting that it could have been
acquired independently from total-Plecoptera by a lineage of stem-Orthoptera including the Spanioderidae.
Regarding this character, an alternative point of view
is provided by A. P. Rasnitsyn and D. S. Aristov [41], in
a contribution in which “Structure of the order is
Eoblattida discussed [sic]” (p. 13): “Cheliphlebia has SC
[ScP] entering R [RA] (like in all above [eoblattidan]
assemblages, a plesiomorphy after Aristov & Rasnistyn,
2010 [2009])” (original square brackets replaced by
brackets). If so the only character shared by the ‘assemblage’ composed of Spanioderidae, Tillyardembiidae, G.
carpenteri gen. et sp. nov., and Plecoptera would be a
plesiomorphy.
Therefore, according to the intricate systematic treatments by D. S. Aristov and A. P. Rasnitsyn [25], and A.

Page 9 of 12

P. Rasnitsyn and D. S. Aristov [41], (1) Plecoptera and
G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. could equally be a sistergroup related to Grylloblattida, the former clade being
characterized by the apomorphy ‘ScP reaching anterior
wing margin’, and (2) Spanioderidae and Tillyardembiidae could equally be related to any other ‘eoblattid
assemblage’.
Finally, the contribution by D. S. Aristov and A. P.
Rasnitsyn [25] rests on the debated assumption that a
posterior stem of the median system, termed M5, occurs
in the insect wing venation groundplan. It has been
demonstrated that the various ‘M5 structures’ are not
homologous [18,24,30]. Assuming close relationships of
Spanioderidae with Plecoptera is unfounded, the former
family being composed of stem-Orthoptera provided
with a common stem M + CuA, a branched CuP, and a
fusion of CuA (diverging from M + CuA; i.e. the presumed ‘M5’) with a branch of CuP [48]. Occurrence of
these traits is not demonstrated for Tillyardembiidae,
and they do not occur in Plecoptera (the arculus, i.e. the
presumed ‘M5’, is a cross-vein) [18].
Notice that Plecoptera be sister-group related to the
Tillyardembiidae and the Spanioderidae is not evident
from A. P. Rasnitsyn and D. S. Aristov [41]. These
authors stated (p. 17) that “Tillyardembiidae [...] is
hypothesised to be a dwarf offshoot of [the spanioderid]
line, a Permian relict.” The Plecoptera (or Perlaria) are
not mentioned by these authors [41].
Close relationships of Tillyardembiidae and Spanioderidae with Plecoptera are even more dubious once the
wing morphology of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. and
genuine Permian stoneflies is considered. These Palaeozoic Plecoptera have a CuA with a few distal branches
[20,21], while CuA is richly branched in Tillyardembiidae and Spanioderidae [25,48]; the Tillyardembiidae do
not have the narrow RA/RP areas [25], a trait diagnostic
of Palaeozoic (and nearly all) stoneflies [18-21]; set
alone the problematic M5 /arculus/CuA interpretation,
the Spanioderidae do not have the broad MP/CuA and
CuA/CuP areas diagnostic of all Plecoptera [18-21]. Provided the antiquity of G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. it is
hardly arguable that the Permian Tillyardembiidae constitute a Permian relict of a more basal member of Plecoptera that would have crossed the whole
Pennsylvanian without leaving a record. Regarding Spanioderidae, it simply has to be considered as a stemOrthoptera [48], unrelated to Plecoptera.
In summary we consider that the suggestion of affinities of Spanioderidae with Plecoptera [25] is not
grounded. The position of Tillyardembiidae is considered as uncertain. There is no clear synapomorphy supporting the view that Plecoptera actually arose from the
known Protoperlaria, Paraplecoptera, stem-Grylloblattida, or ‘Eoblattida’. Provided the new record, the

Béthoux et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/248

argument of ‘historical precedence’ no longer holds: G.
carpenteri gen. et sp nov. is as old as the oldest stemGrylloblattida [15]. We conclude that Plecoptera was a
distinct lineage as early as the Pennsylvanian, and that
known Palaeozoic stem-Grylloblattida might be, at best,
remote relatives of Plecoptera.

Conclusions
Apart from a few Permian genuine Plecoptera [20,21],
G. carpenteri gen. et sp. nov. is the only compelling
Palaeozoic stem-Plecoptera, and is the earliest one.
Although wing morphology of this species allows some
plesiomorphic character states to be outlined for crownPlecoptera, it provides no conclusive evidence on relationships of this group with other recognized major
insect lineages.
Hennig’s supposition is supported: “it seems most
likely that the Plecoptera arose before the lower Upper
Carboniferous” [22]. Indeed continuing identifications of
Pennsylvanian stem-relatives of modern groups is beginning to indicate that Pennsylvanian entomofaunas as
more diverse than previously appreciated. Many major
splits among insect lineages appear to have taken place
earlier, during the Mississippian, or even earlier. Unfortunately, no fossil insects are known from this period.
As a consequence connecting groundplans of major
lineages is difficult to achieve yet. Also, the hypothesis
of an early flight-related radiation [49] can hardly be
tested, because relative dominance of flight and flightless species shortly after the time of appearance of the
trait are unknown. We concur to the view that prospection of favourable Mississippian (or older) localities
must become a priority [50].
Methods
To comply with regulations of the International Code of
Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), we have deposited
paper copies of the above article at the American
Museum of Natural History (NYC), the National
Museum of Natural History (Washington), the Natural
History Museum (London), the Brigham Young University (Provo), and the Colorado State University (Fort
Collins), and sent copies to various colleagues.
Wing venation homologies, and abbreviations

We follow the serial insect wing venation groundplan
[51,52]. The corresponding wing venation nomenclature
is repeated for convenience: ScP, posterior Subcosta;
RA, anterior Radius; RP, posterior Radius; M, Media;
MA, anterior Media; MP, posterior Media; Cu, Cubitus;
CuA, anterior Cubitus; CuP, posterior Cubitus; AA:
anterior analis. The strong and oblique cross-vein occurring between M and CuA near the wing base is referred
to as the ‘arculus’ (indicated as ‘arc’ on illustrations).

Page 10 of 12

Alternative interpretations of the arculus are considered
in the Discussion section. On figures, right and left
forewings are indicated as RFW and LFW respectively,
and right and left hind wings as RHW and LHW; head,
prothorax, antennae, coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and
tarsus are referred to as ‘h’, ‘p’, ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘tr’, ‘f’, ‘tb’ and
‘tar’. Width of hind wings was measured opposite the
end of CuP.
Fossil material

All specimens were collected from the Pennsylvanian
strata near Xiaheyan village (Zhongwei City, Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, China). Specimens are housed
in the Key Lab of Insect Evolution and Environmental
Changes, College of Life Science, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China (CNU; Dong Ren, Curator). All
fossils were examined using a Leica MZ12.5 dissecting
microscope and illustrated with the aid of a drawing
tube. All photographs were taken using a digital camera
Canon EOS 450D coupled to a MP-E 65 mm macro
lens, and are ‘dry-ethanol composites’ (i.e. they are a
combination of photographs of a specimen both dry and
immersed in ethanol). All photographs were processed
using Adobe Photoshop. Photographs indicated as lightmirrored are the product of an optical effect aiming to
revert the polarity of an imprint.
Extant material

Specimens belonging to recent species were prepared to
appreciate intra-specific variability in wing venation.
Selected species are Acroneuria abnormis (Newman) (12
♀, 7 ♂), Acroneuria carolinensis (Banks) (4 ♀, 5 ♂)
(both Perlidae), Pteronarcys californica Newport(6 ♀, 5
♂), and Pteronarcys princeps Banks (2 ♀, 2 ♂; 1 ♀ with
left wings only; 1 ♂ with apex of RFW damaged) (both
Pteronarcyidae). Wings were cut off and mounted in
white Euparal medium (Asco Laboratories, Manchester,
UK). Photographs were taken using a digital camera
Canon EOS 450D coupled with a Canon 50 mm macro
lens, and were processed using Abobe Photoshop
(including manual dusting off).
