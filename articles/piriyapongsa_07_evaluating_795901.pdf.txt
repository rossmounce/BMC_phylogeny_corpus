Abstract
Background: Transposable element (TE) sequences, once thought to be merely selfish or parasitic members of the genomic
community, have been shown to contribute a wide variety of functional sequences to their host genomes. Analysis of complete
genome sequences have turned up numerous cases where TE sequences have been incorporated as exons into mRNAs, and it
is widely assumed that such 'exonized' TEs encode protein sequences. However, the extent to which TE-derived sequences
actually encode proteins is unknown and a matter of some controversy. We have tried to address this outstanding issue from
two perspectives: i-by evaluating ascertainment biases related to the search methods used to uncover TE-derived protein coding
sequences (CDS) and ii-through a probabilistic codon-frequency based analysis of the protein coding potential of TE-derived
exons.
Results: We compared the ability of three classes of sequence similarity search methods to detect TE-derived sequences among
data sets of experimentally characterized proteins: 1-a profile-based hidden Markov model (HMM) approach, 2-BLAST methods
and 3-RepeatMasker. Profile based methods are more sensitive and more selective than the other methods evaluated. However,
the application of profile-based search methods to the detection of TE-derived sequences among well-curated experimentally
characterized protein data sets did not turn up many more cases than had been previously detected and nowhere near as many
cases as recent genome-wide searches have. We observed that the different search methods used were complementary in the
sense that they yielded largely non-overlapping sets of hits and differed in their ability to recover known cases of TE-derived
CDS. The probabilistic analysis of TE-derived exon sequences indicates that these sequences have low protein coding potential
on average. In particular, non-autonomous TEs that do not encode protein sequences, such as Alu elements, are frequently
exonized but unlikely to encode protein sequences.
Conclusion: The exaptation of the numerous TE sequences found in exons as bona fide protein coding sequences may prove
to be far less common than has been suggested by the analysis of complete genomes. We hypothesize that many exonized TE
sequences actually function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, rather than coding sequences, which may act
through a variety of double stranded RNA related regulatory pathways. Indeed, their relatively high copy numbers and similarity
to sequences dispersed throughout the genome suggests that exonized TE sequences could serve as master regulators with a
wide scope of regulatory influence.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences capable
of moving (transposing) among locations in the genomes
of their host organisms. When TEs transpose they often
replicate themselves and they can accumulate to very high
copy numbers. For instance, at least 47% of the human
genome is made up of TE-derived sequences [1]. For many
years, TEs were thought to be genomic parasites that did
not contribute functionally relevant sequences to the
genomes in which they reside [2,3]. However, as of late it
has become increasingly apparent that TEs can have profound effects on the structure, function and evolution of
their host genomes [4-7].
One way that TEs have contributed to the function and
evolution of their host genomes is through the donation
of regulatory sequences that control the expression of
nearby genes. This phenomenon was originally noticed
through the elucidation of individual cases where host
genes were found to be regulated by TE-derived sequences
[8,9]. Later, genome-scale analyses confirmed that TEderived sequences have contributed diverse and abundant
regulatory sequences to host genomes [10,11].
TEs can also contribute to host genomes by providing protein coding sequences. This process is initiated when a
new or existing TE sequence becomes captured as an exon
(exonized) in a host gene mRNA sequence. The exonization of TE sequences appears to be quite common in
eukaryotic genomes. An early high-throughput analysis of
the human transcriptome by Nekrutenko and Li revealed
that 4% of human protein coding regions contained TE
sequences [12]. However, the extent to which exonized TE
sequences actually contribute bona fide protein coding
sequences has been called into question. It is simply not
clear whether the presence of a TE sequence in a spliced
exon, i.e. as part of an mRNA, indicates that it will ultimately be translated into a functioning protein.
Two reports in particular have challenged the figure of 4%
of human proteins with TE-derived coding sequences. In
both of these studies, more conservative approaches to the
identification of TE-derived protein coding sequences
were taken. Specifically, these studies employed the analysis of coding sequences taken exclusively from proteins
that had been experimentally characterized, either
through elucidation of their 3D structures or via direct
peptide sequencing methods. Thus, only the best characterized protein coding sequences were studied and gene
predictions, or models, based on the mapping of
expressed sequences to genomes were not considered.
This approach was first taken by Pavlicek et al. who surveyed a dataset of 781 non-redundant human proteins
with 3D structures for the presence of TE-derived coding
sequences [13]. They were not able to find a single reliable

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

case of a TE-derived protein coding sequence in these
data. Considering these results together with the previous
work of Nekrutenko and Li [12], the authors concluded
that while many alternative transcripts may include TE
sequences, these are rarely if ever incorporated into the
mRNA sequences that are destined to be translated into
proteins. Pavlicek et al. found it particularly unlikely that
non-coding TEs, such as Alu elements, could evolve to
encode proteins after being incorporated into host
mRNAs.
Gotea and Makalowski conducted a similar, if further
reaching, study by looking for TE-derived sequences in the
coding regions of human proteins taken from the Protein
Data Bank [14] (3,764) and from the SwissProt [15] collection of directly sequenced human peptides (1,765)
[16]. Evaluation of these sequences with the RepeatMasker program [17] uncovered 24 cases of TE-derived protein coding sequences. However, many of these had
relatively low sequence similarity scores that were close
the RepeatMasker threshold for false-positives. After further evaluation of these cases using a variety of comparative sequence analysis techniques, the authors settled on a
figure of 0.1% for the percentage of actual protein coding
sequences with TE-derived exons. Incidentally, this figure
is in line with the initial analysis of the human genome
sequence, which found 47 cases of human protein coding
regions with TE-derived sequences, corresponding to
~0.16% of all human genes given the total human gene
number count of ~30,000 used at that time [1].
While there can be little doubt that these two aforementioned studies used appropriately conservative datasets to
search for TE-derived protein coding sequences, it may
also be the case that the primary detection methods they
employed are insufficiently sensitive since they rely on
DNA-DNA sequence comparisons. For instance, RepeatMasker, which is the most widely used program for the
detection of TE sequences, uses pairwise comparisons of
genomic DNA sequences with DNA consensus sequences
that represent TE families. Protein sequence based similarity searches are more sensitive than DNA based searches,
and profile searches that take advantage of information
on site-specific variation along protein domains are
proven to be the most sensitive approach for detecting
sequence homology [18-20].
The increased sensitivity of protein and profile based
searches is underscored by two recent studies that uncovered many more putative cases of TE-derived protein coding sequences. Roy Britten compared human protein
coding sequences to the Repbase library of consensus TE
sequences [21,22] using both RepeatMasker and a protein
sequence based approach that used six-frame translations
of Repbase sequences. Use of the protein (translated)

sequence search method resulted in a more than two-fold
increase, from 814 to 1,950, in the number of genes found
to have TE-derived protein coding sequences [23]. An
even more sensitive profile based search method was used
by Zdobnov et al. to search for TE-derived protein coding
sequences in four vertebrate genomes [24]. These authors
compiled a set of known protein domains that are characteristic of TEs, and profiles of these domains were then
used in hidden Markov model (HMM) searches of the
protein sequences. This analysis resulted in the discovery
of 1,000 vertebrate genes containing protein coding
sequences that are related to TEs. However, neither the
Britten nor the Zdobnov et al. studies confined their
searches to experimentally characterized protein coding
sequences as did the studies of Pavlicek et al. and Gotea
and Makalowski, both of which resulted in far smaller
estimates for the fraction of genes with TE-derived protein
coding sequences.
Clearly, the extent to which TEs contribute protein coding
sequences to vertebrate genomes is not a settled matter.
Relatively insensitive searches of conservative data sets
lead to low estimates for the fraction of TE-derived protein
coding sequences, while more sensitive searches of less
conservative data sets yield higher fractions. The aims of
this study are i-to evaluate the ascertainment biases
related to different sequence similarity search methods
and ii-to try and better understand the potential of TEs to
contribute protein coding sequences to vertebrate
genomes. To these ends, we searched conservative, experimentally characterized, protein coding sequence data sets
for TE-derived sequences using sensitive profile based
search methods. We also compared the results of profile
based search methods with more traditional pairwise

DNA and protein based search methods. Known cases of
experimentally characterized proteins with TE-related
sequences were used as positive controls to assess the sensitivity of the different sequence similarity search techniques. Finally, we used probabilistic gene prediction
methods as well as an analysis of relative nucleotide (GC)
frequencies across codon positions to evaluate the protein
coding probability of TE-derived exon sequences.

Results and Discussion
Searching for TE-associated proteins
We used a number of approaches to detect molecular
domestication events, specifically exaptation of host (cellular) CDS from TE sequences, by searching for the presence of TE-related sequences in functionally well
characterized host protein sequences and CDS. A total of
41,492 PDB entries and 21,050 Swiss-Prot directly
sequenced proteins were taken to represent functionally
well characterized proteins (genes) since they have been
experimentally determined. Viral proteins were excluded
from these data sets in order to avoid the overlap among
protein domains shared between viral and retrotransposon-encoded proteins resulting in final data sets of 39,252
PDB and 20,732 Swiss-Prot entries. Using the combined
automatic and manual search procedure described in the
Methods section, we identified 124 TE-related Pfam protein domains (See Additional file 1). We then searched for
the presence of these TE-related domains among the
experimentally characterized PDB and Swiss-Prot data sets
using profile-based similarity search methods (HMM profiles) as described in the Methods section. The numbers
(percentages) of protein sequences found to possess TErelated domains, based on a series of increasingly stringent HMM search cut-off criteria, are shown in Table 1

Table 1: Detection of TE-encoded sequences in PDB proteins. The number of PDB entries found with TE protein fragments (from
autonomous TEs) by different search programs is shown. The percentage of total PDB entries is shown in the parenthesis. The square
bracket indicates the number and the percentage of protein entries associated with sequences derived from TEs including the nonautonomous ones.

and Table 2 for the PDB and Swiss-Prot data sets respectively.
To compare the sensitivity of the HMM profile-based
search method with more standard sequence-againstsequence similarity search methods, we used the BLAST
and RepeatMasker programs to search for TE-derived
sequences among host proteins and their corresponding
CDS. To this end, we built CDS databases corresponding
to the PDB and Swiss-Prot protein data sets, which contain 34,795 and 38,754 CDS sequences, respectively.
These CDS data sets correspond to 30,486 PDB and
12,860 Swiss-Prot proteins. The difference in the number
of proteins versus CDS can be attributed to the fact that a
number of protein sequences lack the matching CDS
because they are synthetic, mutated, or chimeric proteins.
In addition, some protein entries may be related to more
than one CDS sequence, while some CDS may match with
several PDB entries due to the redundancy of protein
chains. For use as query sequences in BLAST searches, we
created three TE sequence libraries from data provided in
Repbase: 5,611 TE sequences (for all TEs in all taxa), 1,423
TE-encoded proteins and 1,349 TE CDS sequences. The
specific combinations of BLAST program, query set and
data base set used in each search is shown in Table 3. The
numbers (percentages) of sequences found with TErelated domains, based on a series of increasingly stringent E-value cut-offs, are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for
the PDB and Swiss-Prot data sets respectively. Finally, the
RepeatMasker program was used to search for TE-related
sequences among the PDB and Swiss-Prot CDS data sets
(see numbers and percentages of hits in Table 1 and Table
2).

Considering the results of the three different classes of
search strategies â HMMER, BLAST and RepeatMasker â
together yields some unexpected results. Not surprisingly,
however, RepeatMasker proved to be the least sensitive
strategy to search for TE-related host protein coding
sequences. Using the fairly liberal default cut-off value,
which returns a number of hits with marginal reliability,
RepeatMasker yields a lower number of hits than all but
the most conservative searches with the other methods
(Table 1 and Table 2). This is consistent with the fact that
RepeatMasker relies on DNA-DNA sequence comparison.
To compare the results of the HMMER versus BLAST
search strategies, we plotted the percentage of hits against
the E-value threshold used (Figure 1A and 1B). Together
with Tables 1 and 2, these plots show the relative numbers
(percentages) of hits retrieved using each method.
TBLASTX searches, where CDS are translated in all six
reading frames and are searched against nucleotide databases that are translated in six frames, gave the highest
number of hits across all but the most liberal E-value cutoffs. This is consistent with previous results, showing that
translated BLAST searches yield far more TE-host protein
similarity than BLASTN or RepeatMasker searches [23].
The profile-based HMMER searches, which are expected to
be the most sensitive, did return the highest number of
hits at liberal E-values, but after two rounds of decreasing
E-values, HMMER dropped off to yield the fewest number
of hits across all the methods (Table 1, Table 2 and Figure
1). Thus, HMMER appears to be particularly sensitive to
increasingly stringent E-value cut-offs.
To evaluate the selectivity of the search methods we
employed, we measured the exponential rate of decline in

proteins found with TE protein fragments (from autonomous TEs) by different search programs is shown. The percentage of total
SwissProt entries is shown in the parenthesis. The square bracket indicates the number and the percentage of protein entries
associated with sequences derived from TEs including the non-autonomous ones.

the relative number (percentage) of hits retrieved at
decreasing E-value thresholds, which allowed us to measure the effect of increasing stringency on the number of
hits retrieved across methods. This was done by fitting
exponential trend lines to the data shown in Figure 1A
and Figure 1B and then ranking the searches with respect
to the exponent of the trend line; the most selective methods are ranked the highest (i.e. have the lowest rank
number). In this way, HMMER was shown to be the most
selective method and TBLASTX the least selective. As
could be expected, selectively is inversely correlated with
sensitivity, and exactly so for the SwissProt search, as can
be seen when the ranks of method sensitivity (number of
hits) are compared to the selectivity ranks (Figure 1C and
Figure 1D). Again, this overall trend defied the expectations of increased sensitivity of profile methods that we
had at the outset of the study.
We also considered the relationships among the different
search methods in terms of the fraction of hits that they
had in common. For each pair of search methods, the fraction of shared hits was calculated (see Methods), and the
resulting pairwise similarity matrix was used to cluster the
methods (Figure 2). For both the PDB and SwissProt
searches, the translated BLAST methods group together as
do the protein searches BLASTP and BLASTX. BLASTN was
more similar to the translated methods in the PDB search,
while it had lower overlap with the other BLAST methods
in the SwissProt search. HMMER consistently showed the
lowest overlap with other methods. Perhaps more importantly, the extent of overlap between the different methods was surprisingly low. For instance, at the lowest Evalue cut-off only 2 out of a total of 4,241 hits for PDB
and 2 out of 1,724 for SwissProt were identified by all six
search methods. This underscores the fact that the different search methods are very much complementary and
indicates that an exhaustive search for potential TE-CDS
exaptation events will require the use of a variety of search
techniques.

Comparative analysis of cases of TE-CDS exaptation
HMMER was also run using the most conservative gathering (GA) and trusted cut-off (TC) thresholds described in
the Methods section. Searches using GA and TC yield the
fewest number of hits for both the PDB and Swiss-Prot
searches. Thus, we took these results to be the most reliable (conservative) set of TE-related host proteins and further evaluated these results to look for bona fide cases of
TE-CDS exaptation.

By manually evaluating these results, we were able to classify the hits into five distinct categories (see Methods),
only one of which represents the kinds of TE-CDS exaptation events that we are most interested in (Table 4). For
instance, the vast majority of apparent TE-related proteins
in the PDB data set corresponded to either synthetic constructs (i.e. artificial sequences) or non-specific, and often
ubiquitous, TE-related protein domains such as RNaseH.
For this latter category, the non-specific TE-related
domains, it is a formal possibility that they represent
ancient TE-CDS exaptation events but it is difficult, if not
impossible, to unambiguously support that assertion.
Other proteins detected in the PDB set correspond to TEencoded proteins and viral proteins. Only 11 out of 140
cases (or 7.9%) correspond to likely TE-CDS exaptation
events. With the GA and TC thresholds, the Swiss-Prot
dataset yielded far fewer total hits than did PDB and only
3 of these correspond to likely TE-CDS exaptation events
(Table 4).
A set of 12 likely TE-CDS exaptation events, representing
the non-redundant union of the most reliable cases from
the PDB and Swiss-Prot sets in Table 4, were further analyzed in order to assess the ability of BLAST and RepeatMasker to detect these cases. Only one of the 12 proteins
was detected using all methods, and again, RepeatMasker
was shown to be the least sensitive method (Table 5).
Indeed, as expected, DNA-DNA search methods in general
were found to be insensitive; there are 4 cases where
BLASTN and RepeatMasker are the only programs unable
to detect the TE-CDS similarity. There were four individual cases, corresponding to two different Pfam domains,
where only HMMER was able to detect the TE-protein
sequence similarity. These results stand in contrast to the
results of the previous section, which indicate that
HMMER is the least sensitive search method overall. There
are two possible explanations for this dissonance. First of
all, HMMER may suffer from a lack of coverage due to its
reliance on the collection of Pfam domain family definitions. Secondly, and perhaps more plausible, the different
search methods may in fact be complementary in terms of
detecting different sets of exaptation events. This may be
particularly relevant for DNA based, and/or translated,
search methods that are able to compare non-coding TEderived sequences to host protein and CDS sequences.

Sensitivity and selectivity comparison for different sequence similarity search methods

Sensitivity and selectivity comparison for different sequence similarity search methods. The percentage of hits
returned by different sequence similarity search methods are shown across increasingly stringent E-value cut-offs for the PDB

Case studies of known TE-derived genes
There are a number of well verified cases of host proteins
(genes) that are known to have been derived from TE
sequences. These are proteins that have been shown to be
functionally analogous and evolutionarily derived from
their TE-encoded counterparts. For instance, the enzyme
Telomerase evolved from TE-encoded reverse transcriptase enzymes [25,26] and the RAG1 recombinase is
related to the transposase enzymes [27,28]. The centromere protein CENPB [29] and SETMAR [30] are other well
documented cases of the evolution of host CDS from TEs.
We have used these cases as positive controls in order to
further evaluate the ability of the different classes of search
methods to detect cases of TE-CDS exaptation.

lated BLAST searches BLASTX and TBLASTN were the most
sensitive search methods finding all of the cases in this
data set, and HMMER was shown to be fairly sensitive in
detecting three out four of the known cases of TE-exaptation. RepeatMasker was the least sensitive detecting only
the SETMAR case. SETMAR represents an evolutionarily
recent TE-CDS exaptation event that occurred during the
primate radiation some 40â58 million years ago [30].
Thus, the SETMAR CDS retains DNA sequence similarity
to the Hsmar1-type TE transposase gene from which it is
derived. In any case, all the search methods were able to
detect SETMAR, so RepeatMasker would not be necessary
to elucidate this case. In general, for the BLAST searches,
translated and protein based searches are the most sensitive followed by DNA-based BLASTN.

We assessed the ability of each program to detect human
proteins or CDS for all four of these cases (Table 6). Trans-

Relationships among sequence similarity search methods
Relationships among sequence similarity search methods. Colors represent the fraction hits shared between methods, from 0 (white) to 1 (purple). The matrices are symmetrical with self-similarity shown along the diagonal. The search methods are ordered along both axes of the plots with respect to similarity, and dendograms showing the relationships among
methods are shown for the PDB (A) and SwissProt (B) data sets.

Evolutionary relationship between TE and cellular proteins
In the formal sense, establishing a solid, statistically significant, sequence similarity relationship between TEencoded and cellular proteins is necessary but not sufficient to make the claim of a TE-CDS exaptation event. This
is exemplified by the numerous cases of ubiquitous, nonspecific TE-related protein domains uncovered when
searching the PDB and Swiss-Prot experimentally characterized data sets (Table 4). These abundant protein
domains, such as RNaseH, can be functional analogs that
have evolved convergently in host and TE genomes or they
may have their evolutionary origins in host (cellular)
genomes and been subsequently captured by TEs. Thus, it
is necessary to document the evolutionary relationships
between TE-encoded and related host-encoded protein
domains as accurately as possible in order to evaluate the
evidence for TE-CDS exaptation. Phylogenetic analysis is

domains detected by the GA and TC cut-offs of HMMER. The
categories of hits are described in the text and the number
(percentage) for each category is shown for searches against the

To illustrate this analytical process, we have chosen the
THAP protein domain. Sequence similarity between the
THAP domain and TEs has been noted previously but the
evolutionary origins of the domain, and in particular the
specific direction of the TE-host transfer, remains uncertain. The Caenorhabditis elegans C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) [PDB: 2jm3] contains the THAP domain, a
~90 residue domain, which is restricted to animals and
shared between the THAP family of cellular DNA-binding
proteins and transposases encoded by DNA-type TEs. This
domain was previously found to be homologous to the
site-specific DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Drosophila Pelement transposase [31]. An evolutionary analysis of the
domain architectures and sequence similarities among
THAP domain containing proteins was taken to suggest
the possibility that cellular proteins have recruited this
domain on more than one occasion [32].

best suited to this task. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis is
needed to unequivocally demonstrate a TE-origin, i.e. the
direction of the TE-to-host sequence transfer, for protein
domains with similarity between TEs and host genomes as
was shown for the case of Telomerase [26].

In order to characterize all sequence relationships
between TE and host-encoded THAP domains, we used
HMMER with the Pfam THAP domain HMM profile to
search among the Repbase library of TE-encoded proteins.
The use of HMMER was necessitated by the fact that, consistent with results reported in previous sections of the
manuscript, BLAST and RepeatMasker can not detect any

TE-related sequence in C. elegans CtBP. Using HMMER, we
found that PROTOP is the identity of the autonomous
Drosophila melanogaster P element that contains the THAP
domain, in positions 12 to 94 of its consensus protein
sequence. We also identified six additional TE families
containing THAP domain (KBOC_DB, P1_AG, P3_AG,
P4_AG, Kolobok-1_XT, Kolobok-2_BF). In addition, CtBP
was used as a BLASTP search query to identify host (cellular) genome encoded THAP domains. All TE and host
encoded THAP domains were aligned, globally and
locally, and phylogenetically analyzed as described in the
Methods section.
The global and local alignment based phylogenetic analyses consistently identify one clade of host encoded THAP
domains and a second clade of THAP domains encoded
by both TEs and cellular genomes (Figure 3). Interestingly, the TE and host encoded domains are distributed
throughout this clade suggesting the possibility of multiple transfers of THAP domain CDS between TE and host
genomes. In addition, TE encoded THAP domains appear
to have greater sequence diversity, reflected by the branch
lengths, than host encoded THAP domains, consistent

with a TE origin of the domain. Thus, it appears that THAP
indeed evolved among TE sequences and was subsequently transferred on more than one occasion to host
(cellular) genomes.
Protein coding potential of TE-derived exons
By now, it is well known that TE-derived sequences are frequently incorporated into the exons of host mRNAs [12].
What is less clear is the extent to which TE-derived exons
of host genes are destined to become protein coding
sequences. Previously, we addressed this issue by searching functionally well characterized protein coding
sequences for the presence of TE-related domains. Here,
we take a DNA sequence codon based approach to this
question. Our approach is based on the fact that protein
coding sequences show a specific and marked periodicity
of nucleotide frequencies across the first, second and third
codon positions. This periodicity serves as a robust signal
for a number of gene prediction algorithms, one of the
earliest and most prominent example of which is GeneMark [33]. GeneMark can accurately identify protein coding nucleotide sequences based solely on the distribution

of observed nucleotide frequencies across codon positions.
We used the eukaryotic version of GeneMark [33], to evaluate the coding capacity of TE-derived exon sequences in
the human genome. First, we compared the locations of
14,802 consensus CDS (CCDS) genes mapped to the
hg17 build, from the UCSC Genome Browser [34], of the
human genome to the locations of annotated TEs (see
Methods). 761 of the human CCDS genes have TE-derived
exon sequences; there are a total of 817 TE-derived exons.
The 761 human genes with TE-derived exons include 160
TE-derived fragments with the minimum length of 100 nt
required for GeneMark analysis. Using GeneMark probabilistic models (see Methods), we analyzed the TE-derived
exon sequences as well as 500 randomly chosen representative non TE-derived exons by calculating their probabil-

ity to be protein coding regions. The distributions of
protein coding potentials (probabilities) for TE versus
non TE sequences are shown in Figure 4. Visually the distributions are quite distinct, with TE derived exons having
far lower coding potential, and accordingly there is a
highly significant difference between the two coding
probability distributions, D = 0.67 P = 0 KolmogorovSmirnov test (Figure 4A). The average coding potential of
TE-derived exons was 0.26 compared to 0.70 for non TEderived coding sequences. Using a more sensitive customtrained GeneMark model gave consistent results, 0.35
average TE coding probability versus 0.73 for non TE
sequences with significantly different distributions D =
0.59 P = 0 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Figure 4B). Clearly,
TE-derived exons have much lower coding probability
than non-TE derived sequences suggesting that many of
these exons do not actually encode proteins.

Coding probability of human CCDS genes
Coding probability of human CCDS genes. The coding probability of TE-derived coding sequences (pink) and non TEderived coding sequences (blue) are shown, with results from the original GeneMark model (A) and our custom trained GeneMark model (B). TEs are separated in Alu (red) and non-Alu (green) for the original (C) and custom (D) GeneMark models.

Since the TE-derived exons evaluated using GeneMark as
described above are taken from the RepeatMasker annotations on the human genome sequence, they do not
include more ancient well established cases of TE-derived
CDS such as the first three cases shown in Table 6. One
would expect that these TE-derived CDS have higher protein coding potentials than the more recently exonized TE
sequences revealed by RepeatMasker. In fact, when analyzed using GeneMark in the same way as described for
the entire set of TE-derived exons, all of their protein coding probabilities are significantly greater (z-test: 15.5 <z <
16.9) than the average protein coding probability (0.35)
of the aforementioned set of TE-derived exons: Telomerase = 0.81, RAG1 = 0.77, CENPB = 0.89. Interestingly, the
protein coding probability of the relatively recent case of
TE-CDS exaptation, SETMAR (0.67), is also significantly
greater (z = 11.8) than the average coding potential for the
set of RepeatMasker identified TE-derived exons. This is
consistent with the fact that, while SETMAR does represent a recent case of TE-CDS exaptation, the particular TE-

sequence that was exonized was already a protein-coding
domain prior to becoming a host gene [30].
Taken together, these protein coding probability data are
consistent with previous studies that have suggested caution is warranted when extrapolating genome sequence
analyses to infer TE-CDS exaptation events [13,16,35,36].
In particular, the notion that non-autonomous TEs that
do not encode any protein, including SINEs such as the
Alu family of elements, can emerge as protein coding
sequences after being incorporated into exons has been
directly challenged [13]. On the other hand, Alus are frequently incorporated into mRNAs as exons [37-40], and
there are a number of specific cases of Alu-derived CDS
that have been proposed to provide novel CDS to primate
genes [41,42]. In light of this controversy, we have specifically evaluated the potential coding capacity of Aluderived exons using GeneMark.

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

Alu-derived exons were considered separately from all
other TE-derived exons and their coding probability distributions were plotted along with the distribution for non
TE-derived exons (Figure 4C and Figure 4D). Alu-derived
exons have coding probability distributions that are
shifted to the left, i.e. towards lower probability, than all
other TE-derived exons. Indeed, the average coding probabilities for Alu-derived exons are significantly lower than
the averages for all other TE-derived exons (Table 7). This
result holds under a number of different analytical conditions (see Methods), including the two different GeneMark models and the consideration of Alu-derived exons
as only containing Alu sequences or containing Alu plus
other TE sequences (composite TE-exons in Table 7).
In addition to the global analysis of Alu-derived exon protein coding potential, we also evaluated several documented cases of Alu exonization events that are assumed
to represent TE-CDS exaptations [41,42]. For these cases,
the specific evolutionary scenarios giving rise to the Aluderived exons are quite well documented, but the protein
coding potential of the Alu-exons appears to be assumed.
Here, the GeneMark web server [43], which runs both
GeneMark and GeneMark.hmm [44] programs, was used
to plot protein coding probabilities along the length of
the CDS using a sliding window (Figure 5). This allowed
the protein coding potential of the Alu-derived exons to
be directly compared to that of the non TE-derived exons
in the same genes. Consistent with their status as protein
coding genes, the coding sequences analyzed tend to
show uniformly high protein coding probabilities. However, the Alu-derived exons show far lower protein coding
potential than the rest of the gene sequences. The apparent low coding potential of Alu derived exons may also
reflect the fact that these sequences have a relatively recent
evolutionary origin as exons and thus have not had
enough time to accumulate the kinds of changes that
would yield periodicities that more closely resemble other
coding sequences.
GC codon distribution for TE-derived exons
The distribution of GC content across codon positions can
also be used to evaluate the protein coding potential of
genomic sequences. This kind of analysis is based on the

fact that the GC level (%G+C) is distinctly lower in the
second (GC2) than in the third (GC3) codon positions for
protein coding sequences in species ranging from human
to Escherichia coli [45,46]. Thus, for protein coding
sequences, regression analysis of %GC2 Ã %GC3 should
yield a trend line with a slope y << 1. Here, we used GC2/
GC3 regression analysis to compare the protein coding
potential of TE-derived versus non TE-derived exons.
For the first analysis, GC2/GC3 trends were computed for
entire genes that contain one or more TE-derived exons
versus entire genes with no TE-derived exons (Figure 6A).
In this case, the GC2/GC3 distributions are indistinguishable and do not have significantly different slopes (t =
0.36, df = 14,798, P = 0.71). However, 27.93% of TE associated genes were located outside the 95% confidence
band of non-TE associated gene set. On the other hand,
when TE-derived exons are considered alone (Figure 6B),
the slopes of the TE-derived versus non TE-derived sets are
significantly different (t = 2.84, df = 14,384, P = 4.6e-3),
and 31.70% of TE-derived exons are found outside the
95% confidence interval for the non TE-derived set. Thus,
while the GC2/GC3 analysis appears to suffer from a lack
of resolution compared to the GeneMark coding potential
analysis, it too points to a relatively low coding probability for TE-derived exons.
We also analyzed Alu-derived exons separately using
GC2/GC3 codon analysis as was done with GeneMark.
Visual inspection of the location of Alu-derived exons on
the GC2/GC3 plot shows that they have relatively higher
GC2, typical of non-coding sequence, and 41.79% fall
outside the 95% confidence interval, all of which fall
above the upper confidence interval boundary (See Additional file 2). In addition, Alu-derived exons have average
GC2/GC3 ratios that are significantly higher than the
GC2/GC3 ratios for all other TE-derived exons and for the
non TE-derived gene set (Table 8). In other words, the
GC2/GC3 analysis also suggests that Alu-derived exons
are less likely to encode protein sequences than other TEderived exons.

potentials are compared between the specific pairs of groups indicated using the Student's t-test. Comparisons were done using two

Coding probability of genes with Alu-derived exons. GeneMark protein coding probability analyses are shown for three
genes with well-characterized Alu-derived exons: C-rel-2 [CCDS: CCDS1864.1] (A) MTO1-3 [CCDS: CCDS4979.1] (B) and
PKP2b-4 [CCDS: CCDS8731.1] (C) [41]. Coding probabilities were calculated within windows sliding along the length of the
genes. The locations of the Alu-derived exons are shown in red.

Conclusion
The potential for TE sequences to become exapted as host
protein coding sequences through the process of exonization has received a great deal of attention as of late [4751]. Implicit in much of this literature is the assumption
that exonized TE nucleotide sequences, i.e. TE sequences
that are spliced into mRNAs, actually encode protein
sequences. However, this assumption has been challenged on several different fronts [13,16,35,36]. In particular, it is unclear whether non-autonomous TEs that do
not encode any protein, such as Alu elements, actually
provide protein coding sequences after becoming
exonized [13]. Nevertheless, recent studies continue to
turn up numerous apparent cases of TE-CDS exaptation
[23,24]. So the matter of TE-CDS exaptation remains
unsettled, and in this report we have tried to address the
issue from two perspectives: i-with respect to the ascertainment biases that arise from the use of different

sequence similarity search methods and ii-in terms of the
protein coding potential revealed by the probabilistic
analysis of exonized TE nucleotide sequences.
Our use of profile-based (HMM) sequence similarity
searches did allow for greater sensitivity than the more
widely used DNA-DNA (e.g. RepeatMasker) search methods when employed on a test set of well-characterized exapted TE-CDS (Table 5 and Table 6). Thus, ascertainment
biases could explain the paucity of reliable examples of
TE-derived protein coding sequences uncovered via the
analysis of experimentally characterized protein sequence
data sets [13,16]. However, when profile-based search
methods are similarly applied to large-scale datasets of
experimentally characterized proteins, they did not turn
up many more cases than previously found (Tables 1,
Table 2 and Table 4). In fact, the profile-based search
method appeared to be less sensitive than all BLAST-based

search methods â nucleotide, protein or translated (Table
1 and Table 2). This apparent lack of power can actually
be attributed to the superior selectivity of the profilebased methods (Figure 1) and suggests that many of the
putative TE-CDS exaptation events turned up in BLAST
searches may be spurious. In other words, profile-based
search methods possess a valuable combination of sensitivity, measured by their ability to recover positive control
test cases, and selectivity than any of the other search
methods used. Nevertheless, the different search methods
are complementary to the extent that combined search
approaches are needed to thoroughly check any data set
for all potential TE-CDS associations. Different search
methods will also be more or less appropriate depending
on the kind of exonization event that is being analyzed;
for instance, it will not be possible to search for the contribution of non-coding TEs to exapted protein domains
using profile methods based on protein sequence alignments.
The codon based analysis of exonized TE sequences suggests that many, if not most, of these sequences do not
actually encode any protein. Non-coding TEs that are
exonized, such as Alu, have particularly low protein coding probabilities. The lack of protein coding potential
does not mean that exonized TE sequences are necessarily
non-functional. They may in fact play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. We hypothesize that many
exonized TE sequences serve as natural anti-sense transcripts, which can function as double stranded RNA regulators of gene (protein) expression. The repetitive
dispersed nature of exonized TE sequences may provide a
mechanism by which they can serve as master regulators
with influence over the expression of numerous genes
throughout the genome.

Methods
Detection of TE-encoded protein fragments
Sequence data sets
The set of functionally well characterized proteins was
taken from two databases: Protein Data Bank (PDB) [14]
(downloaded on 03/02/07) and Swiss-Prot Protein Database [15] (version 52.0). For the Swiss-Prot entries, only

Page 13 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

directly sequenced proteins were included in the data set.
These directly sequenced proteins are the proteins whose
amino acid sequence has been partially or completely
determined experimentally by Edman degradation or by
mass spectrometry and can be found by searching the
Swiss-Prot database with the keyword 'Direct Protein
Sequencing'. The data set of experimentally characterized
protein sequences from PDB and Swiss-Prot was then filtered to remove the sequences from viruses. The nucleotide coding sequences (CDS) corresponding to the final
set of protein sequences was obtained from EMBL CDS
database [52]. It should be noted that PDB entries can
contain more than one distinct protein sequence (chain)
and the same protein sequence (chain) may be found in
more than one PDB entry. A data set of protein sequences
encoded by TEs and their corresponding CDS sequences
were extracted from Repbase [21] version 12.02. The data
set of all TE nucleotide sequences (including non-autonomous TEs) was retrieved from Repbase website [53].
Identification of TE-related protein domains
Protein domains that are associated with TEs were identified in version 21.0 of the Pfam database [20] and the
associated InterPro annotation [54]. Pfam entries, both
keywords and domain descriptions, were automatically
searched using a set of related terms (e.g. transposon, retrotransposon, retroviral/retrovirus, transposase, reverse
transcriptase, etc.) as in [24]. The resulting putative TErelated Pfam entries were then manually inspected to
remove spurious hits corresponding to protein families
that are not encoded by any TEs. Manual inspection was
done using the Pfam domain descriptions and literature
references. HMM profiles, representing the site-specific
sequence variation, of the TE-related Pfam domains were
used in searches with the HMMER program as described
below.
Sequence similarity searches
The experimentally characterized PDB/Swiss-Prot protein
sequence data sets described above were searched for the
presence of the TE-related protein domains using version
2.3.2 of the HMMER program [55]. HMMER searches
were run using a series of increasingly stringent threshold
E-values, from E-value â¤ 1 to E-value â¤ 0.00001, in addition to the gathering threshold (GA) and trusted cut-off
(TC) threshold values (Table 1 and Table 2). The GA and
TC threshold cut-offs are values that have been benchmarked by the developers of HMMER to ensure that a
minimum number of false-positive hits are detected. The
GA thresholds are empirically set for each Pfam model
and correspond to the score used to collect all of the
sequences included in the Pfam full alignment. In other
words, the GA threshold corresponds to the complete
absence of false-positives. The TC threshold is similar to
GA in the sense that it corresponds to the lowest scoring

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

hit to any sequence included as a true member of a particular Pfam domain. TE-associated PDB/Swiss-Prot proteins
detected by HMMER were classified into five categories: ipotential TE-related proteins (the host proteins containing TE-associated protein domains), ii-viral proteins (genuine viral proteins though the PDB source organism is not
listed as a virus), iii-TE-encoded proteins found in TEs as
opposed to cellular host proteins, iv-synthetic construct
(synthesized protein sequences), and v-ubiquitous nonspecific TE-related protein domains (i.e. host protein containing Pfam domains which are not specific to TE protein
sequences but can be found in TEs as well).
Various BLAST programs [56] and the program RepeatMasker [17] were used to search the protein sequence and
CDS data sets described above for TE-related protein
sequences and/or TE-related CDS. The specific programquery-database combinations used for each search are
shown in Table 3. BLAST programs were run using a series
of E-value thresholds, from E-value â¤ 1 to E-value â¤
0.00001, with default parameters and without low-complexity filtering.
The fraction (f) hits shared between any two methods was
taken as the ratio of the number of hits retrieved in both
searches to the total number of hits in both searches. For
two searches that return x and y numbers of hits respectively:

fxy =

xâ©y
x+ y â xâ©y

All pairwise similarity values were calculated in this way,
and the resulting matrix was clustered using hierarchical
clustering. Matrix clustering and visualization were done
using the programs Genesis [57] and Matrix2png [58]
respectively.
Analysis of known cases of TE-derived proteins (genes)
Several well known cases of proteins (genes) derived from
TEs were evaluated by the HMMER, BLAST and RepeatMasker programs to determine the efficiency of different
search methods in detecting TE-CDS exaptation events.
The TE sequence data set sources as described in the previous section were used for these searches. The Genbank
sequence accessions for the known cases are Telomerase
Reverse Transcriptase [RefSeq: NM_198253, NM_198255,
NP_937983, NP_937986], Recombination Activating
Gene 1 (RAG1) [RefSeq: NM_000448, NP_000439], Centromere protein B (CENPB) [RefSeq: NM_001810,

Evolutionary analysis of TE-associated protein domain
We used the THAP domain-containing protein, C. elegans
C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) [PDB: 2jm3], for a
phylogenetic analysis of THAP domain shared between TE
and cellular proteins. The position of the THAP domain in
C. elegans CtBP [RefSeq: NP_508983] was identified using
HMMER program. The BLASTP program was used to
search for the homologous sequences of CtBP THAP in
other species, using the Genbank non-redundant database, and the sequence fragments corresponding to the
THAP domain were extracted as "cellular THAP". The
library of TE proteins sequences (described in the sub-section Detection of TE-encoded protein fragments:
Sequence data sets) was searched for the THAP-containing
entries by using HMMER program with gathering (GA)
threshold cut-off. The sequence fragments corresponding
to the THAP domain in TE proteins were extracted as "TETHAP" sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis of THAP sequences was done using
the neighbor-joining algorithm [59] implemented in the
MEGA program [60]. Two sources of pairwise distances
were used based on i-global sequence alignment of THAP
domains with CLUSTALW [61] and ii-local alignment of
THAP domains using all-against-all pairwise BLASTP. For
the global THAP domain sequence alignments, Poisson
distances were used, and for the local THAP domain comparisons, p-values (proportion of differences) taken from
the BLAST output were transformed into gamma distances
using Î± = 2.25 [62]. Bootstrap analysis, based on 1,000
replicates, was performed on the global THAP sequence
alignment.
Codon based analysis of TE-derived exons
The UCSC Genome Brower [34] and Table Browser tools
[63] were used to search for human protein coding
sequences co-located with TEs. Genomic locations of the
CCDS genes mapped to the hg17 (NCBI Build 35) version
of the human genome sequence were compared to the
locations of TEs annotated with the RepeatMasker program [17]. The CCDS gene data set [64] was chosen
because it represents a highly reliable set of gene models
that are built from multiple lines of evidence and undergo
quality analysis across several genomic centers before
being released. Two data sets were created in this way: igenes containing TE-derived exon sequences and ii-genes
without TE-derived exons.

Version 2.5f of the GeneMark program [33] was used to
compare the protein coding probabilities of TE-derived
and non TE-derived human exons. GeneMark uses threeperiodic inhomogeneous Markov models to analyze protein coding sequences and we used two models in our
analysis. The first model is the GeneMark model pretrained on validated coding and non-coding sequences of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

the human genome. This model is made available with
the program. We also trained a customized GeneMark
model using protein coding exon sequences from the non
TE-derived gene set for the coding training set and intron
sequences from the same genes as the non-coding training
set. Each training set was classified into five groups based
on %GC content (<41, 41â47, 47â53, 53â59, >= 59) for
separate training of the fifth order Markov chain models.
Note that 100 non TE-derived genes of each GC level were
randomly selected as a set of non TE test sequences and
removed from the training set before model training. The
GeneMark program was run on the set of genes with TEderived exons using the custom made model parameters
corresponding to the GC content of each gene. The sliding
window size was chosen to be 96 nt long and the step size
to be 3 nt. The average posterior probability, which characterizes the probability that the sequence encodes a protein, was calculated for each TE-derived exon sequence
fragments (>100 nt) using the following formula:

P(cod x..y ) =

1
n

â P(cod |F)
1

i

where x+W/2 <= i <= y-W/2, x = start position of TE fragment, y = end position of TE fragment, n = # of sliding
windows for which the midpoint lies within the range of
x+W/2 to y-W/2, i = the midpoint of each sliding window,
P(cod1|F) = posterior probability of the event that given
the fragment F, it carries genetic code in frame 1 (starting
from the very first nucleotide), W = the width of sliding
window. The coding probability was calculated in the
same way for the non TE test sequences. The analysis was
repeated for the same test set using the pre-trained GeneMark models for human genome.
For the GC2/GC3 analysis, the GC level (%G+C) of second (GC2) and third (GC3) codon positions were calculated for each coding sequence of both the TE-derived and
non TE-derived gene data sets. In addition, %GC2 and
%GC3 were calculated for TE-derived fragments that are at
least 60 nt long.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Itai Yanai, Harvard University

In this manuscript Piriyapongsa et al. report a systematic
analysis of the potential for transposable elements (TE) to
contribute to proteomes. This is an issue of recent controversy in the literature with estimates of proteins with TE's
in an organism ranging from 0.1% to 4%. The authors
point out that along with the variation of estimates, is also
variation of the datasets used and the searches invoked to
analyze them. Datasets used comprise either predicted or
experimentally-characterized protein sequences. Search
methods used are DNA sequence similarity methods such
as RepeatMasker, protein based searches, or profile based
searches. The latter two methods are expected to be more
sensitive than DNA searches. One specific goal of this
study is to test whether the number of detected TEs is low
in the clean set of experimentally-characterized protein
sequences despite the use of sensitive sequence similarity
measures. Another is to analyze the translation potential
by two additional codon-based methods.
The authors find that even the more sensitive protein and
profile methods do not uncover too many more instances
of translated TE instances. This provides strong evidence
that the original result â TEs exapted in 4% of the human
proteome â is roughly off by an order of magnitude, when
examined with respect to validated protein sequences as
opposed to predictions of protein sequences. However,
the most dramatic evidence for the general non-translation of TE's comes from Piriyapongsa et al.'s codon-based
analysis which shows that they are as untranslated as
ALUs. This dramatic lack of coding potential as estimated
by the GeneMark program does however beg the question
of why these have apparently maintained an open reading
frame and did not accumulate non-sense mutations by
drift.
One remaining open question now that the extent of TE
exaptation is roughly estimated is the exact delineation of
the TE proteins. One attractive method is the phylogenetic
approach which Piriyapongsa et al. demonstrate for the
THAP domain. Perhaps this approach can be applied globally to achieve a final tally of TE's contribution to proteomes. The authors also hint at a second method: the
integration of the 7 sequence comparison methods to
increase confidence in TE exaptation predictions. The
authors show a checkered pattern of success and failure of
the 7 methods to detect previously identified TE-associated proteins. From one aspect it is interesting to ask if the
specific failures of some of the programs can be overcome
by tuning the specific search parameter. And from another
aspect, could this positive control set and the pattern of
successes across the different methods be used to learn

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

how the different methods complement each other? This
seems to be especially in demand given the very limited
amount of overlap between many of the methods. Such
integration may lead to a more accurate list of TE exaptations.
Authors' response: Dr. Yanai suggests an interesting point
about the use of a combined search program approach and the
adjustment of search parameters for more accurate identification of TE exaptations. This is a good idea, although a larger
positive control set may be needed in order to get more information on TE exaptation signals. Several factors (e.g. age of TEs)
that can affect search parameters have to be considered. As we
show in Table 6, SETMAR, which represents an evolutionarily
recent TE-CDS exaptation event that occurred during the primate radiation, maintains very strong signal that could be
detected by any program we used. The ancient TE-CDSs do not
retain DNA sequence similarity to the TEs from which they are
derived and complementary methods will be needed to capture
all such events. Indeed, there is no one method that captures all
of the events, and it is difficult to appreciate exactly which combination of search techniques would be needed to ensure maximum coverage. In general, the more methods that can be used
the better. Different methods will be more-or-less effective
according to the type (e.g. element family and/or age) of exaptation event that is being evaluated and the same probably holds
for the tuning of specific search parameters (e.g. e-value thresholds).
Finally, the notion that many genes contain TE's that are
not translated leads to the interesting question of how the
organism protects itself against disruption by TE insertions. Surprisingly TE's may not promote creativity at the
protein level but instead creativity at the level of new
mechanisms to curb the disruption caused by proliferating selfish elements.
Authors' response: Dr. Yanai raises a good question about
the tolerance to random mutation of low coding potential TEderived coding sequences. As we proposed in the conclusion section, although lacking protein coding potential, these TEderived exons may provide other functional roles in the genome
such as gene regulation. TE sequences can be a rich source for
natural antisense transcripts that regulate gene expression of
many sense targets leading to the complex regulatory networks
in the genome. This could possibly be the reason that untranslated TE-exons are preserved by natural selection. Furthermore,
these exonized anti-sense regulators could play a role in posttranscriptional suppression of TE sequences throughout the
genome and thereby represent a mechanism to "curb the disruption caused by proliferating selfish elements" as Dr. Yanai
stated. While we are actively working on these ideas, much
more work needs to be done to gain a better understanding of
this phenomenon.

Reviewers' report 2
Kateryna D. Makova, Pennsylvania State University and
Melissa Wilson, Pennsylvania State University (nominated by
Kateryna D. Makova)

The manuscript by Piriyapongsa et al. provides an investigation of a very interesting and recently debated issue, i.e.
how much transposable elements contribute to proteincoding genes. The authors discuss previous research on
this topic and provide a thorough analysis to reach their
final conclusions. The manuscript is well written and will
be of great interest to a broad audience. We have just a few
minor suggestions for the authors to consider.
1. It is clear from table 4 that PDB and Swiss-Prot contain
very different protein sets. We wonder how much these
two sets overlap, is one more abundant for some species
than the other, and how this disparity might affect the
results.
Authors' response: The PDB and Swiss-Prot proteins are
indeed quite different and that is one of the reasons that we
analyzed these two data sets separately. The results are shown
individually for PDB and Swiss-Prot proteins. We have checked
for the overlap between PDB and Swiss-Prot data sets using
BLAST program. 52.60% of Swiss-Prot protein (CDS)
sequences have at least one PDB CDS hit with e-value <=
0.001. 72.07% of Swiss-Prot protein sequences have at least
one PDB protein hit with e-value <= 0.001. So the two sets do
overlap substantially. In addition, the results of most search
methods, in terms of the fraction of hits obtained, were comparable across the two data sets (Table 1and Table 2). Only the
results obtained from BLASTP and BLASTX program showed
markedly lower percentages of PDB hits compared to Swiss-Prot
data set. The lower fraction of TE-encoded sequences in PDB
data set can be due to the redundancy of protein chains in PDB
entries. The HMMER search, which used PDB/Swiss-Prot proteins as query sequences, also showed the difference of hit fractions between two protein data sets, though not as clearly as
BLAST results. Having said all of that, the two most relevant
points for our manuscript that hold for both the PDB and SwissProt sets are 1-different search methods detect largely different
sets of hits as described in the manuscript and 2-the different
search methods show similar relative performances in terms of
selectivity and sensitivity (Figure 1).
2. Under Results and Discussions, the first section titled,
"Searching for TE-associated proteins," when discussing
the BLAST searches, it might be clearer to describe the
three TE databases as libraries, only because it is confusing
to think of searching the CDS databases with another
database.
Authors' response: The sentence has been edited to read "TE
sequence libraries" as suggested.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

3. How do you define selectivity?
Authors' response: Selectivity is defined in our manuscript as
the strength of the effect of increasingly stringent E-value
thresholds on the number of hits retrieved by the different
search methods. This is measured in terms of the relative
number (percentage) of hits retrieved at different E-value cutoff levels.
4. Under "Comparative analysis of cases of TE-CDS exaptation", do you mean that you had the exact same hits
(same proteins) for both the PDB and Swiss-Prot using
GA and TC in HMMER? Please clarify.
Authors' response: We meant that the GA and TC methods
yield the same number of hits when run on the same database
(not between databases). This was confusing and we have modified the confusing part of the sentence to clarify it.
5. What evidence do you have for the proposal that
exonized TE sequences serve as natural anti-sense transcripts, or that they may be master regulators? Perhaps the
word "hypothesize" would be better suited than "propose" in the second to last sentence of the Conclusion.
Authors' response: We currently have several ongoing
projects in the lab that are related to this open question. The
'proposal' that TE sequences serve as natural anti-sense transcripts is supported by some new unpublished data, but we need
to evaluate this more before we can be certain. Therefore, the
reviewers' point is well taken and we have changed the abstract
and the conclusion to read 'hypothesize' as suggested.
6. In figure 3, if there is enough room, it would be beneficial to have the species names spelled out completely
either in the figure or in the figure legend.
Authors' response: For the cellular proteins, the species
names have been added to the figure as suggested.

The study attempts to provide a more quantitative and
realistic assessment of the contribution of TE-derived
sequences to the host proteome. As the authors rightfully
point out in their introduction, previous investigations of
this question have used different methods, different datasets and different probabilistic cut-off, resulting in
extremely different outcomes and inconsistent results. So
the extent by which TE contribute to the host proteome
remain an unsettled issue. The study does not offer an
unambiguous answer to this issue, but it provides a clear
demonstration that different computational approaches

Page 17 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

can yield extremely different results, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, in terms of the number of potential TEderived coding sequences and the categories of exaptation
events. Interestingly, the authors observe that the different
approaches return largely non-overlapping dataset of candidate TE-derived sequences. They conclude that it will be
necessary to combine these different methods to capture
the whole breadth of potential TE-derived proteins. They
also show, through the example of THAP-domain proteins, that phylogenetic analyses can bring further support
to the claim that some host-encoded protein domains are
derived from TE-encoded domains rather than vice-versa.
The second part of the study explores another outstanding
question: are TE-derived exons (i.e. those with unambiguous TE origin and experimentally-supported transcription) effectively translated into functional proteins? The
authors approach this question through a comparison of
the coding potential of TE-derived exons and non-TE
derived exons based on a probabilistic assessment of
codon- and GC-biases typically produced by protein-coding sequences. The results show that the dataset of TEderived exons examined have a dramatically different
codon and GC signatures than non TE-derived exons,
which the authors interpret as a reduced probability to be
protein-coding sequences.
Overall, I found that this is a valuable study in that it provides a scholarly effort to assess and quantify the biases
that can be introduced when different sequence similarity-search methods are used to address what seems to be
the same question. The results provide an immediate
explanation for the discrepancies in the degree of TE exaptation into coding sequences published previously by
different groups.
(1) My major concern is that the authors have intermingled and often lumped two very different categories of TE
exaptation events, which I believe should be kept and
treated separately. The first type of event, which I would
refer as 'domestication' is when a coding sequence previously encoded by a TE is recycled or exapted toward a cellular function. The classic examples would be RAG1 or the
transposase domain of SETMAR. The second type of exaptation events, which perhaps could be referred as to
'exonization' is when a TE sequence that was previously
non-coding becomes part of a new coding sequence (e.g.
Lev-Maor et al. Science 2003; Krull et al. 2005). The classic
example here would be exons derived from SINEs, such as
Alu, which themselves originally derive from functional
non-coding RNA (generally tRNA or, in the case of Alu,
7SL RNA). Intuitively, domestication events seem less
dubious as to their coding potential than exonization
events, because they only require that the ancestral TE
coding sequence be maintained (or slightly modified) to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

be potentially adaptive. In contrast, exonization events
require a seemingly more fortuitous evolutionary scenario
to become adaptive at the protein level, such as 'de novo'
emergence of a new functional domain, separation or disruption of an existing functional domain by a loop, etc...
Thus, one might view exonization events as being either
initially neutral and/or as having a regulatory function at
the RNA level (as the authors suggest in their conclusion,
see below for more discussion of this hyptothesis). Thus
the adaptive value of exonization events is generally subject to more debate than domestication events. I believe
treating the two categories separately will clarify and
improve the quality of the study.
For example, once these two types of events are separated,
it becomes evident that profile-based searches, which use
a collection of established TE coding domains (as found
in Pfam) as queries, can only detect domestication events,
not exonization events. This simple observation can
largely explain the discrepancies (Table 1) in the amount
and nature of TE exaptation detected via profile-based
searches and the BLAST-based searches, which use as queries all the known repeat consensus sequences, either as
DNA or as translated queries (blastn or tblastx, respectively). Thus, I am not sure it really makes sense to compare side-by-side these approaches as they use different
query sets and it is readily predictable that they will not
yield the same results.
The comparison of profile/HMM searches with tblastn or
blastp searches, which use predicted TE-encoded proteins
as queries instead of the entire TE database, seems more
appropriate. However, here again the query sets used in
the two types of methods are not directly comparable: TE
Pfam domains are generally well conserved domains
often validated by biochemical/structural analyses and
the resulting HMM profiles are based on multiple alignments of a broad diversity of TE and/or viral proteins.
Thus the same 'consensus' HMM profile encompasses
generally a very wide diversity of TEs (often an entire
superfamily or class of elements, e.g. reverse transcriptase). In addition, several TE domains are not characterized and represented in conserved domain databases,
so there is no derived HMM profiles for those. In contrast,
predicted TE-encoded proteins (which were used as queries in tblastn and blastp searches) are not limited to characterized/conserved domains and they are more
representative of the diversity of the coding potential of
TEs. Thus, it is a richer source of queries to potentially
detect domestication events, but the approach is hampered by the overall lack of sensitivity of blast algorithms.
Conversely, the sensitivity of HMM searches is notoriously better, but since the queries are less representative of
the coding capacity of TEs, the absolute number of highly
significant hits tend to be lower than with blast-based

Page 18 of 24

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

methods. Consequently, I suspect that HMM searches are
able to uncover more remote similarities and yield hits
not detected by blastp/tblastn, while the latter searches
will reveal more closely related hits and hits with TE
domains not represented in the queries of the HMM
searches. This can explain, in part, the lack of overlap
between the methods emphasized by the authors. In conclusion, even though the authors have 'fixed' the sequence
space that they explore (PDB/Swiss Prot database, a biologically reasonable compromise compared to previous
studies), they are not really able to 'fix' the query sets used
in the different methods. Thus, a direct comparison of the
outcomes produced by these different methods may be
misleading.
In my opinion, it was inherently predictable that the different methods will not yield the same datasets. For example, it is clear that if one wants to identify exonization
events (as I defined above), HMM profiling, tblastn, or
blastp searches are not the way to go. So, I would disagree
with the conclusion (see abstract) that "profile-based
methods is the most appropriate tool for detecting TECDS associations". It really depends what type of exaptation events you're trying to detect. The problem with the
way the ms is written is that it seems that all of these methods may be used to detect the same type of events, broadly
defined as TE-derived coding sequences. I think the
authors should separate more clearly the two types of exaptation events and the tools that are appropriate to detect
one or the other.
Authors' response: The reviewer raises an important point that
we have tried to address in our analysis, namely the evolutionary fate of different kinds of TE sequences that become incorporated into the mRNAs of host genes. There is indeed good
evidence to suggest that different classes of TEs, i.e. those with
protein coding versus those with non-protein coding sequences,
may have different evolutionary fates once incorporated into the
mRNAs of host (cellular) genes. This notion is well supported
by Tables 7 &8along with Figures 4, 5and Supplementary Figure 1 from our manuscript. However, there are some epistemological and related terminology issues that need to be cleared up
in regard to the distinction proposed by Dr. Feschotte between
'domestication' and 'exonization' events. Molecular domestication, a phrase introduced into the biological lexicon by Wolfgang J. Miller, is a generic term that refers to any number of
different events whereby a formerly selfish TE sequence becomes
domesticated to play some role for its host. Similarly, the term
exaptation, introduced by Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth
Vrba, refers to any biological feature that evolved for one purpose but then acquires a new function for which it was not originally adapted, such as a TE sequence that becomes a functional
part of a host gene. The relevant point here is that domestication and/or exaptation events can be deduced to have occurred
irrespective of the particular mechanism by which they arose or

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

their mode of action for that matter. For instance, TE sequences
can be domesticated to serve as protein coding sequences but
they can also be domesticated to serve as regulatory sequences.
Exonization, on the other hand, simply refers to the actual
mutational event whereby a TE sequence acquires the genomic
location and signals that cause it to be captured as an exon in
a host gene's mRNA. The question we are addressing here is
what happens after exonization. There can be several fates for
exonized TEs: 1-they can be deleterious and selected against, 2they can be neutral and drift to fixation or be lost, or 3-they can
be beneficial and consequently fixed by selection. For the last
category, the molecular function that leads to a benefit for the
host and subsequent adaptive fixation can be different: it could
be a role as a protein coding sequence or it could be a regulatory
role such as we propose for anti-sense regulation. We are in full
agreement with the reviewer that different classes of TEs probably have different propensities to be domesticated as protein
coding versus regulatory sequences. However, dividing these
events into exonization versus domestication does not accurately
capture the nuances of the biological events that we are trying
to analyze. The exonization-domestication dichotomy also
obscures an important distinction between mutational events
that originate genomic changes and the evolutionary events
that follow. Nevertheless, Dr. Feschotte makes a good point
about the importance of clearing up the difference between coding versus non-coding TE sequences being exonized and their
subsequent fates. In order to clarify this, we describe how previous authors have made this distinction and how it relates to our
study in the introduction, results and conclusion sections. In
addition, we have added an analysis of the protein coding
potential of well-characterized TE-CDS exaptation events
shown in Table 6, all of which represent cases where TE coding
sequences were exonized and subsequently exapted. We also
specifically delineate the different datasets used in the different
parts of the manuscript.
While Dr. Feschotte predicted that the different search
approaches used would turn up almost entirely different sets of
results, we did not anticipate the level of dissonance observed.
In addition, this point has not been sufficiently appreciated in
the literature to date, and this is precisely one of the things that
we were trying to evaluate. The other issues that the reviewer
points out about the different query versus search sets along
with the different affinities of the search methods used are quite
correct and of course unavoidable given the use of different
methods in our study. However, we emphasize again, and also
mention in the paper, that the effect of these differences on the
search for TE-derived protein coding sequences was precisely
what we were trying to evaluate. One of the confounding results
of this study (see response to Reviewer's report 1) is that it is
still not apparent exactly which methods (or search parameters)
will be best suited to which kinds of events. For this reason, we
conclude that the most rigorous searches of TE-CDS exaptation
events should include as many different and complementary
search methods as is possible.

(2) A related issue is that the first part of the ms puts more
emphasis on domesticated TE domains (e.g. ability to
detect known domesticated proteins, example of the
THAP domain), while the second part of the ms addresses
mostly the coding potential of exonized TEs. But, without
careful consideration of the datasets examined and of the
methods to assemble the datasets, the reader might be
tempted to conclude that the conclusions of the second
part apply to all TE-derived coding sequences, while I suspect they only apply to exonized TEs sensu stricto. Indeed,
the dataset used in the second part was obtained by intersecting the coordinates of human CDS and those of annotated TEs (i.e. identified by RepeatMasker). For having
personally worked with this same dataset, I recall that it
consists essentially of short exonized TE fragments that
were not ancestrally coding (Alu, MIRs, various
MERs...etc) or when they were, the present coding
sequence is not derived from the coding part of the element or from the ancestral reading frame (e.g. ancient L1,
L2...etc). Most of the known cases of domesticated TEs are
not captured by this procedure (e.g. CENP-B, RAG1,
ZBED) because they occurred too long ago (as shown in
Tables 5 and 6, and discussed in the text earlier, these are
not detectable by Repeatmasker because there is not
enough similarity between human TEs and the ones that
were originally domesticated). I think this point is important and should be made clearer in the text. It might be
enlightening to analyze separately the coding potential of
domesticated TE domains from the exonized non-coding
TEs as the authors did by analyzing separately Alu-derived
exons. I suspect they would find a significant difference
between the two different categories of exaptation events
in terms of their coding potential.
Authors' response: Here, we were trying to evaluate the coding potential of TE sequences that have been exonized into
human genes but where we do not know if they are actual protein coding sequences or not. The point about short fragments
is well taken but these were eliminated prior to analysis as
described in the manuscript. We did try to analyze the coding
potential of different classes separately as the reviewer suggests
but the relatively low numbers of long-enough fragments did
not afford enough resolution to our analysis. There are 160 TEderived fragments with the minimum length of 100 nt required
for GeneMark analysis and when we attempted to divide these
into different classes we lost resolution. Thus, there is not sufficient data to do the comparative analysis suggested by the
reviewer. Nevertheless, Dr. Feschotte raises a valuable point
about the need to clarify the difference between RepeatMasker
identified TE-derived exons and the exons derived from more
ancient TE-CDS exaptation events. We have added a new paragraph, and a new analysis, to the manuscript to address this
point. In order to evaluate the protein coding potential of
known TE-CDSs, we have run GeneMark on the previously
identified TE-CDS events listed in Table 6. These sequences do

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

have strong protein coding potential and in this sense stand out
from the abundant exonized Alu (and other) elements that we
analyzed.
(3) In the second part of the ms, the authors show convincingly that TE-derived exons display a significantly different 'codon' (as measured by GeneMark) and GC bias
than non TE-derived exons. They interpret these differences as evidence against the coding potential of TEderived exons. Alternatively, this difference might also
reflect the relatively more recent evolutionary origin of TE
exons compared to non-TE exons. This could also reflect
the fact that most TE-derived sequences examined were
previously non-coding (this is certainly true for Aluderived exons) and had a biased nucleotide composition
(Alus for example are GC-rich) prior to exonization. It
could be that the codon/GC biases characteristics of nonTE exons require the passage of relatively long evolutionary time to become apparent. So, if the TE-derived
sequences are evolutionary recent (Alu for example is a
primate-specific family), they might simply not (yet)
exhibit these biases. It would be interesting to see whether
more ancient TE-derived exons (e.g. derived from MIRs,
L2...) have a different codon/GC signature than recently
derived TE exons (e.g. those derived from recent L1 or
Alus). The age of exonized TEs could be estimated easily
based on their presence/absence in other mammals
(mouse for example) using the comparative genomics
track of the UCSC Genome Browser. If broadly conserved
TE-derived exons are still found to display a strikingly different codon/GC signature than non-TE exons (but similar to those of recent Alus), then it will strengthen the
argument that they have reduced or no coding potential
(as suggested in the last paragraph of the Conclusion).
Authors' response: One of the challenges of the probabilistic
GeneMark analysis is the relatively long TE-exon sequences
needed together with the high numbers needed to distinguish
between distributions. As mentioned in the response to point
#2, there are simply not enough data points to divide the TEderived exons into the number of different classes needed to
evaluate different age classes of elements. While this is the case,
the reviewers point about the relative ages of the elements is a
valid one and the fact that the Alus, for which there are high
enough numbers to evaluate separately, are a relatively evolutionarily young set of elements suggests that the low apparent
coding potential may indeed reflect the fact that there has not
been enough evolutionary time elapsed since exonization to
change the structure of the coding regions. We have added a
sentence to reflect this fact to the manuscript.
(4) Section "comparative analysis" (Table 4):
Here, the authors should clarify what they mean by "synthetic constructs". They should also explain how they dis-

Page 20 of 24

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

tinguish between specific and non-specific TE domains. I
concur that it is often difficult to infer whether a given
domain is of TE origin or was acquired from the host by
TEs. They use the example of the RNase H fold, but it
might not be the best example because this fold is also
related to the DDE core of retroviral integrases and TPases.
Discarding systematically hits to Rnase H might exclude a
number of bonafide TPase or IN-derived proteins. Nonspecific domains would require closer inspection before
being disregarded as false positives. The level of similarity
(reflected by e-values) could be used as a guide. Similarly,
I am not convinced that viral-like domains should be systematically regarded as unreliable cases of domesticated
TE coding sequences because many robust cases of TEderived proteins might actually fall within this category
(for example gag-like proteins derived from extinct gypsylike elements from vertebrates â see Campillos et al. TIG
2006).
Authors' response: Synthetic constructs are artificial, i.e.
man-made or modified sequences, such as vectors or sequence
fragments (not the entire native protein), and this has now
been clarified for the reader in the manuscript. As for the nonspecific category, we agree completely with the reviewer that
these cases should not necessarily be dismissed out-of-hand.
However, here we have tried to be as conservative as possible in
order to focus on the most reliable cases, and this is also
explained for the reader where we mention that it is possible
that these cases represent ancient TE-CDS exaptation events.
The viral proteins are also potentially interesting, but we eliminate them from consideration since our own inspection of this
class revealed that the vast majority are bona fide viral proteins,
many of which are grouped together with TE-derived proteins
when forming Pfam-models. For instance, none of the viral proteins in Table 4are likely to correspond to TE-derived proteins.
(5) I was perplexed by the section 'case studies of known
TE-derived proteins' (Table 6). First, the authors use RAG2
as a known case of transposase domestication. However,
to my knowledge, there is no evidence that RAG2 is
related to a transposase. Both RAG1 and RAG2 are
required for V(D)J recombination, but only RAG1 contains the DDE catalytic core and is affiliated to transposases (Transib; see Kapitonov & Jurka 2005). The origin
of RAG2 remains undetermined. So, it is not surprising
that RAG2 is not detected as TE-derived by any of the Blast
or RM methods. However, I found it extremely surprising
that it is detected using HMM. This would be a new and
exciting finding, which if confirmed, would require further explanation. In particular, I was wondering what
Pfam entry hit with RAG2? Conversely, I am surprised that
HMM did not detect RAG1, because the link with DDE
recombinases is very well established and the RNAseH/
DDE fold of RAG1 is well conserved. This is precisely the
type of distant relationship that I would expect HMM to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/31

be superior at detecting than Blast-based methods. Are the
authors sure they did not swap the HMM results of RAG1
and RAG2 in Table 6? In this case, the conclusion that "the
only way to detect all of these known cases would be to
used a combined strategy based on both profile and translated-blast strategies" does not hold anymore as the two
strategies will detect all of them. Plus, if we exclude the
case of RAG2, it appears that translated blast strategies will
detect sufficient to detect all of them.
Authors' response: This was a mistake in our analysis and we
are grateful to Dr. Feschotte for pointing this out. Accordingly,
the RAG2 example has been eliminated from the manuscript.
A transposase evolutionary origin of RAG2 was proposed in the
literature based on biochemical/functional analysis â but this
could well be due to the fact that it acts in a complex with RAG1
as suggested. On the other hand, RAG1 was also identified as
being related to transposase through biochemical/functional
studies originally but then it was recently identified as having
sequence similarity to transposases. However, the results we
present for RAG1 were not a case of switching RAG1 and
RAG2, so the result of RAG1 not being detected with the HMM
search holds up. In any case, removing RAG2 does mean that
the translated BLAST searches are sufficient to detect all cases
as Dr. Feschotte states. Thus, the fact that the different search
methods are complementary is better exemplified by the data in
Tables 1and 2.
(6) I was surprised that the authors did not mention the
utility of selection analysis on codons (Ka/Ks) in the
assessment of the coding potential of TE-derived coding
domains. This type of analysis remains one of the most
reliable (although indirect) methods to assess whether a
given transcribed sequence is actually being translated
into a functional protein. In particular, evidence of purifying selection in the form of Ka/Ks ratio significantly lower
than 1 in TE-derived exons can be taken as a strong indication that they encode functional coding sequences. The
method is also powerful because it allows discriminating
between domesticated proteins and TE-encoded proteins
as the latter tend to evolve neutrally (a good example is
provided by the study of domesticated Drosophila PIFlike proteins by Casola et al. MBE 2007).
Authors' response: We did attempt Ka/Ks analysis, but since
many of the TE-derived exons are relatively young, there was
not enough data to perform a systematic study of Ka/Ks. We
agree that this technique is quite powerful and reliable, in principle, for evaluating individual cases of TE-CDS exaptation.
The problem is that you need a number of substitutions in order
to get good statistical resolution between Ka and Ks but not so
many as to saturate Ks. For most cases we looked at, there were
simply not enough publicly available orthologous, and long
enough, TE-exon regions available for analysis. In fact, this is
one of the very reasons that we attempted the relatively novel

Page 21 of 24

Biology Direct 2007, 2:31

codon based analyses described to evaluate the coding potential
of TE-derived exons. The fact that these probabilistic methods
read along the length of the entire TE-derived sequence, as
opposed to simply evaluating a handful of substitutions between
sequences, gives them a relatively higher degree of resolution
based on the amount of data (sites) that they evaluate. Having
said that, even these methods provided challenges in terms of
resolution as described in the responses to points #2 and #3.
The distinction between Ka/Ks and the probabilistic approaches
we take were not raised in the manuscript because we did not
intend to debate the relative merits of the different classes of
codon based analysis.
(7) In their conclusion paragraph and in the abstract, the
authors propose that many of the exonized TE sequences
have a regulatory function at the RNA level. They hypothesized that they "serve as natural antisense transcripts". I
think the authors should provide a more explicit mechanism and at least some preliminary data supporting this
model. Are they suggesting that the repeats provide promoters driving anti-sense transcription of the flanking
exons? Or are they suggesting that the TE-derived exons
are themselves subject to RNA interference by pairing of
anti-sense transcripts produced from related repeat copies
elsewhere in the genome? It would strengthen the model
if the authors could provide data or published information supporting either of these models. Another model is
that TE-derived exons are subject to alternative splicing
and that TE-containing spliced variants are subject to nonsense mediated decay (NMD), thereby participating to
post-transcriptional gene regulation. This hypothesis is
supported by the observation that many TE-derived exons
are indeed alternatively spliced (e.g. Lev-Maor et al. Science 2003; Krull et al. Genome Res 2007). In addition,
several instances of highly-conserved TE-containing cassette exons introducing premature stop codons have been
recently shown to trigger NMD (see Mendell et al. Nat
Genet 2004; Bejerano et al. Nature 2006; Mola et al. J Mol
Biol 2007; Ni et al. Genes Dev 2007). These observations
seem highly relevant to the discussion.
Authors' response: We are currently actively working on this
exact question, but the data are not ready to be presented in
manuscript form. The same issue was raised in Reviewers'
report 2. Since we are not yet ready to present such data, we
have re-worded the abstract and the conclusion to emphasize
that the regulatory function of TE-derived exons at the RNA
level is a hypothesis. We agree with the points the reviewer
makes about the different possible models that could be involved
and appreciate the references provided. The observations are
indeed 'highly relevant' as Dr. Feschotte points out, and clarification would surely strengthen the model. However, such clarification will have to wait for another day and another study
when the data permit.
