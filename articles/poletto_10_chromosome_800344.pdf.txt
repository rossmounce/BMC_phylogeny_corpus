Abstract
Background: Cichlid fishes have been the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their rapid adaptive
radiation which has led to an extensive ecological diversity and their enormous importance to tropical and subtropical
aquaculture. To increase our understanding of chromosome evolution among cichlid species, karyotypes of one Asian,
22 African, and 30 South American cichlid species were investigated, and chromosomal data of the family was
reviewed.
Results: Although there is extensive variation in the karyotypes of cichlid fishes (from 2n = 32 to 2n = 60
chromosomes), the modal chromosome number for South American species was 2n = 48 and the modal number for
the African ones was 2n = 44. The only Asian species analyzed, Etroplus maculatus, was observed to have 46
chromosomes. The presence of one or two macro B chromosomes was detected in two African species. The
cytogenetic mapping of 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene revealed a variable number of clusters among species
varying from two to six.
Conclusions: The karyotype diversification of cichlids seems to have occurred through several chromosomal
rearrangements involving fissions, fusions and inversions. It was possible to identify karyotype markers for the
subfamilies Pseudocrenilabrinae (African) and Cichlinae (American). The karyotype analyses did not clarify the
phylogenetic relationship among the Cichlinae tribes. On the other hand, the two major groups of
Pseudocrenilabrinae (tilapiine and haplochromine) were clearly discriminated based on the characteristics of their
karyotypes. The cytogenetic mapping of 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene did not follow the chromosome
diversification in the family. The dynamic evolution of the repeated units of rRNA genes generates patterns of
chromosomal distribution that do not help follows the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. The presence of B
chromosomes in cichlids is of particular interest because they may not be represented in the reference genome
sequences currently being obtained.
Background
Teleost fishes have a successful history of diversification
over the past 200 million years. The 23.000 species of
teleosts make up almost half of all living vertebrates [1].
Perciformes represents the largest order of vertebrates
with approximately 9.300 species. It includes more than
3.000 species of the family Cichlidae [1,2] that is one of
the most species-rich families of vertebrates [3]. The natural distribution of cichlid fishes is centered on Africa,
Latin America and Madagascar, with only a few species

native to South India and the Middle East [4]. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicate that cichlids are closely
related to the marine surfperches (Embiotocidae) and
damselfishes (Pomacentridae), but not as previously
thought, to wrasse and parrotfishes (Labridae and related
families) [5]. Phylogenetic reconstructions are consistent
with cichlid origins prior to Gondwanan landmass fragmentation 121-165 MYA, considerably earlier than the
first known cichlid fossils from Eocene [5]. Cichlid fishes
found in the lakes of Africa have served as model systems
for the study of evolution [4,6,7]. Several species have
received increasing scientific attention because of their
great importance to tropical and subtropical aquaculture
[8].

The family Cichlidae is a monophyletic group and the
limits and interrelationships of all four subfamilies
[Etroplinae (Indian and Madagascar), Ptychochrominae
(Malagasy), Cichlinae (Neotropical region) and Pseudocrenilabrinae (African)] are well supported by molecular
and morphological data [9]. The African (Pseudocrenilabrinae) and Neotropical (Cichlinae) cichlids are both
monophyletic and represent sister groups [9]. The African Pseudocrenilabrinae cichlids are often assigned into
pelmatochromine, haplochromine and tilapiine groups
[10], but these groups are not recognized as valid taxonomic units. The Neotropical cichlids (Cichlinae) are
monophyletic and are composed of 51 genera and 406
described species [11,12]. The most recently proposed
phylogeny of the Cichlinae denotes the tribes Cichlini,
Retroculini, Astronotini, Chaetobranchini, Geophagini,
Cichlasomatini and Heroini [13].
The karyotypes of more than 135 species of cichlids
have been determined. Although most species present a
karyotype with 2n = 48, the diploid number ranges from
2n = 32 to 2n = 60 [14] (See Additional File 1: Available
chromosomal data for the Cichlidae). African cichlids
have a modal diploid number of 44 chromosomes
whereas the Neotropical cichlids 2n = 48 chromosomes.
Even though chromosomal data are known for several
cichlid species, these data are not representative of the
diversity of species in the group. Molecular cytogenetics
approach to characterizing genome evolution has been
applied to only a few species, principally Oreochromis
niloticus. The aim of this work was to obtain chromosomal data for additional species of cichlids, including the
mapping of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and to
compare these results to previous published chromosomal data and phylogenies, in order to correlate chromosomal rearrangements with particular phylogenetic
transitions during the evolutionary history of the family
Cichlidae.

Results
Basic cytogenetic analysis
Subfamily Etroplinae

The karyotype of Etroplus maculatus consists of 46 chromosomes including 18 m/sm (meta/submetacentric), 18
st/a (subtelo/acrocentric) and 10 microchromosomes
(Table 1, Figure 1). The most remarkable characteristics
of the E. maculatus karyotype were the presence of two
outstanding large metacentric pairs, several small chromosomal pairs identified as m/sm or st/a, and five pairs
of microchromosomes.
Subfamily Pseudocrenilabrinae

In this work we sampled the tilapiines Oreochromis
aureus, O. mossambicus, O. niloticus, O. tanganicae, Tilapia mamfe and T. mariae (Figure 1, Table 1). The karyotypes of the tilapiines investigated here are relatively

conserved with 2n = 44 chromosomes for most species
and the presence of a large st/a typical chromosome (pair
2 in O. niloticus, pair 5 in T. mariae, pair 6 in T. mamfe)
(Figure 1). Reduction in the number of chromosomes was
observed in T. mariae that shows 40 chromosomes with
the presence of two atypical metacentric chromosome
pairs (pairs 1 and 2) (Figure 1).
Most of the haplochromine species we analyzed had a
karyotype composed of 2n = 44 (Figure 1, Table 1). Astatotilapia burtoni had a karyotype composed of 40 chromosomes, with 14 m/sm and 26 st/a chromosomes, and
two large m/sm chromosome pairs (pairs 2 and 3) not
observed in other haplochromines (Figure 1, Table 1). All
the haplochromines have two typical large chromosome
pairs, the first m/sm and the first st/a pairs.
When compared to the haplochromines and tilapiines,
the karyotype of Hemichromis bimaculatus (Hemichromine) shows the same diploid number (2n = 44), but with
only two m/sm chromosome pairs (Figure 1, Table 1). A
large st/a (pair 3) and a large m/sm (pair 1) chromosome
were also observed.
B chromosomes were detected in Haplochromis obliquidens and Metriaclima lombardoi. One or two large
metacentric B chromosomes were present in 38 out of 96
analyzed specimens of H. obliquidens whereas one large B
chromosome was detected in nine out of 22 animals sampled for M. lombardoi (Table 1).
Subfamily Cichlinae

The karyotypes of Cichla species (Cichlini) and Retroculus lapidifer (Retroculini) presented 2n = 48 st/a chromosomes (Figure 2, Table 2). The karyotype of Astronotus
ocellatus (Astronotinae) presents 12 m/sm chromosomes
and Chaetobranchus flavescens (Chaetobranchini) shows
6 m/sm chromosomes (Figure 2, Table 2), both with 2n =
48.
The karyotypes of Geophagini species are similar to
Chaetobranchini (Figure 2, Table 2). On the other hand,
the karyotype of Apistogramma borelli presented a
reduced number of chromosomes (2n = 46) and the presence of a higher number of m/sm chromosomes (eight
pairs) compared to the non-geophagines (Figure 2).
Among the Cichlasomatini analyzed, Laetacara dorsigera showed a reduced chromosome number (2n = 44)
with the presence of two outstanding large metacentric
pairs (pairs 1 and 2) (Figure 2).
Heroini showed the broadest range of karyotype configurations. The cichlids Heros efasciatus, Mesonauta festivus, Parachromis managuensis and Pterophyllum
scalare have 2n = 48 chromosomes with variations in the
number of m/sm and st/a chromosomes (Figure 2, Table
2). The Symphysodon aequifasciatus karyotype is by far
the most derived of all cichlids, with a highly increased
number of chromosomes (2n = 60), including 10 microchromosomes.

Cytogenetic mapping of 18S rRNA genes

The mapping of 18S rRNA genes was conducted in 26
representative Cichlidae species, including one Asiatic,
12 Africans and 13 South Americans (Figures 1 and 2,
Tables 1 and 2). In the present work FISH proves identified the 18S rRNA gene in the terminal region of short
arm of st/a chromosomes in almost all species. Excep-

tions were observed in E. maculatus, that presented this
marker in the terminal region of a m/sm chromosome
(pair 9) (Figure 1), and C. kelberi that harbours 18S rRNA
genes in the terminal position of the long arm of the st/a
chromosome pair 1 (Figure 2). In nine of the 12 African
cichlids studied only two chromosomes were labeled by
the 18S rRNA gene probe. Variation in the distribution of

18S sites were observed in three species: O. niloticus presented six labeled chromosomes (Figure 1); O. mossambicus showed three labeled chromosomes (data not shown);
and Haplochromis obliquidens revealed four labeled
chromosomes (Figure 1). For the South American species
only one site of 18S rDNA was observed, except M. festivus, which presented five labeled chromosomes (Figure
2). Furthermore, the location of 18S sites in the short
arms of a st/a chromosome pair appears to be common
for R. lapidifer, S. jurupari, A. tetramerus, L. dorsigera
and H. efasciatus (Figure 2). Another pattern for 18S
rRNA gene position is represented by a large pair of m/
sm with interstitial clusters in A. ocellatus, Chaetobranchus flavescens and Crenicichla lepidota (Figure 2).
Terminal 18S rDNA sites were observed in B. cupido,
Parachromis managuensis and Pterophyllum scalare (Figure 2). On the other hand, Cichla kelberi, has the 18S
rDNA cluster located in the terminal position of the long
arm of a large acrocentric pair (Figure 2), and M. festivus
showed five chromosomes bearing 18S rDNA sites (Figure 2). Heteromorphic sites of the 18S rDNA was frequent in some species of the analyzed Neotropical
cichlids as A. ocellatus, C. flavescens, B. cupido, C. lepidota, S jurupari and H. efasciatus (Figure 2). The 18S
rDNA sites were mostly coincident with secondary constrictions observed in the Giemsa stained karyotypes
(Figures 1, 2).

Discussion
Chromosome differentiation among cichlids

The South American cichlids had distinct karyotypes
compared to the Asian and African ones. The most
remarkable characteristic is related to the modal chromosome number that is 48 for the South American and 44
for the African species [14] (See Additional File 1: Available chromosomal data for the Cichlidae clade). Besides
that major pattern, small differences related to variations
in the number of m/sm and st/a chromosomes are frequent and some species exhibit remarkable differences in
their karyotypes related to the occurrence of specific
chromosome rearrangements during their evolutionary
history. Among the Pseudrocrenilabrinae clade, typical
karyotype features discriminate the tilapiines from haplochromines and hemichromines (Figure 3).
The karyotypes of the Asian species E. maculatus and
the South American Symphysodon aequifasciatus showed
extensive chromosomal transformations when compared
to the Perciformes basal karyotype. Etroplinae represents
a sister clade of all other cichlids and Symphysodon (Heroini representative) represents a highly derived species
inside the Cichlinae clade [13]. Another species of
Etroplinae, E. suratensis, was described to contain 48
chromosomes [15], but the information provided is not
clear concerning the morphology of the chromosomes. It
seems, based on [15], that E. suratensis posses 48 st/a
chromosomes, most similar to the basal karyotype of Perciformes [16]. The Etroplinae cichlids are quite morpho-

logically distinct, exhibiting numerous specializations
that are absent in all other cichlid lineages [15]. The subfamily Etroplinae was the first group to be isolated from
the ancient cichlid group that was present in the Gondwanan supercontinent [9] and, the longest time of vicariance speciation could also account for the transformation
to such a derived karyotype (Figure 3).
The African tilapiines present a highly conserved karyotype consisting of mostly st/a chromosomes and 2n =
44. Only a limited number of the known tilapia species
have been karyotyped, but the species are closely related
[17], and the existing evidence suggest that the tilapia
karyotype is highly conserved [18,19]. To date, only four
species have their karyotypes differing from 2n = 44, T.
mariae, 2n = 40 (present paper), T. sparrmanii, 2n = 42
[20], O. alcalicus, 2n = 48 [21,22] and O. karongae, 2n =
38 [23]. The karyotype of O. karongae shows a reduced
diploid number of chromosomes to 2n = 38 and differs
from that found in most tilapia species. Different cytogenetic and genomic analysis previously conducted point to
the reduction of chromosome number in O. karongae as a
consequence of chromosome fusions involving three
chromosome pairs in the ancestral of this species [23,24].
The presence of a large subtelocentric chromosome
pair, that is the first st/a pair of the complement in O.
aureus, O. niloticus, T mariae, T. mamfe, O. mossambicus
and O. tanganicae, is an excellent marker for the group of
tilapiines. The karyotpes of non-tilapiine species are recognizably distinct, despite having the same number of
chromosomes. The large chromosome pair is the most
remarkable characteristic of tilapiine karyotypes. Chromosome fusions are also believed to have occurred to
create the largest chromosome pair of O. niloticus [25].
Chromosome fusions could also explain the reduction in

Page 8 of 12

the number of chromosomes in T. mariae to 40. The
presence of two atypical metacentric chromosome pairs
(pairs 1 and 2) in T. mariae suggests that these chromosomes originate from the fusion of small st/a chromosomes. These data support the hypothesis that
chromosomal fusions occurred independently during the
evolutionary history of tilapiines reducing the chromosome number from 2n = 44 as observed in several tilapia
species.
Most of the haplochromine species we analyzed had a
karyotype composed of 2n = 44. Astatotilapia burtoni
had a karyotype composed of 40 chromosomes with the
presence of two typical metacentric chromosome pair (2
and 3), which are probably the result of centric fusion of
four small st/a chromosomes. These chromosomal rearrangements apparently occurred after the divergence of
Astatotilapia from the other haplochromines that still
retain 44 chromosomes in their karyotypes. Furthermore,
the two largest pairs of chromosomes (first m/sm pair
and first st/a pair) in the haplochromines stand out compared to the other chromosomes of the complement
which make them good markers for this group. The chromosome information of haplochromines is in agreement
with their phylogenetic divergence of other African
Pseudocrenilabrinae [26].
The Neotropical cichlids have a modal number of 2n =
48, with the exception of Apistograma borelli (2n = 46),
Laetacara dorsigera (2n = 44), and Symphysodon aequifasciatus (2n = 60). The chromosomal number for South
American cichlids ranges from 2n = 48 st/a chromosomes
in Cichla spp., considered the most basal karyotype, to 2n
= 60 (46m/sm, 4st/a and 10 microchromosomes) in Symphysodon aequifasciatus. Cichla (Cichlini) and Retroculus
(Retroculini) presented a karyotype structure composed
only of st/a, similar to the proposed Perciformes ancestral
karyotype [16]. In the most recent proposed phylogeny
for South American cichlids, a clade composed of
Cichlini and Retroculini was recovered as the sister group
to all other South American cichlids [13]. On the other
hand, Symphysodon exhibited the most derived karyotype
condition compared to the proposed Perciformes ancestral karyotype and also occupy a derived position in the
phylogeny of the group [13].
The karyotype formula 2n = 48 st/a elements is characteristic of Perciformes, as observed in Sciaenidae [27,28],
Pomacentridae [29] and Haemulidae [30]. These data
suggest that Cichla and Retroculus retain the ancestral
karyotype pattern of the group (2n = 48 st/a). The ancestral karyotype has undergone major changes in its macrostructure in some lineages, which has led to the extensive
karyotype diversification that is currently observed
among cichlids. This observation is consistent with several proposed phylogenies for the family [[13], for

Poletto et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/50

review], which generally include Cichla and Retroculus as
sister group of the other Neotropical cichlids.
The derived chromosomal patterns of Symphysodon
probably results from rearrangement involving chromosomal pericentric inversions, translocations and fissions/
fusions [31,32]. Repetitive DNA elements seem to have
contributed to the chromosomal diversification of Symphysodon karyotypes in relation to other cichlids [33].
Pericentric inversions are thought to be the main mechanism contributing to changes in the basal chromosome
arm size of Perciformes [34,35]. Other mechanisms of
chromosomal rearrangement and translocation probably
have contributed to the karyotypic diversification of
South American cichlids. The chromosome number variation observed in some species suggests that events of
chromosomal translocation followed by chromosome fission and fusion were also involved. It remains to be investigated whether specific events of chromosome
rearrangements (fusion, fission, inversion) that occurred
during the evolutionary history of cichlids are related to
particular characteristics of their genomes.
B chromosome in African cichlids

In addition to the standard cichlid karyotype pattern,
large metacentric B chromosomes were observed at high
frequency among specimens of H. obliquidens and M.
lombardoi. One notable characteristic of the B chromosomes found in these species is their large size, which is
almost the same as the largest pair of the A complement.
Information concerning the occurrence and the genomic
content of B chromosomes among African cichlids has
just recently been reported for H. obliquidens [36]. The
occurrence of supernumerary chromosomes has been
described for species of diverse fish groups. In general the
supernumerary chromosomes of fishes vary in number
and morphology. Among cichlids, supernumerary chromosomes have been described in only a few species from
South America. They were first described for male germinative cells of Gymnogeophagus balzanii [37] and for species of Geophagus brasiliensis, Cichlasoma paranaensis
and Crenicichla niederleinii [38]. Small supernumerary
chromosomes were also described for Cichla monoculus,
Cichla sp. and Crenicichla reticulata [[39], for review].
Since some African cichlid species genomes are being
completely sequenced [40], it will be of particular interest
to investigate the occurrence of B chromosomes among
cichlid species for future genomic analyses.
Cytogenetic mapping of 18S rRNA genes

The ancestral condition for the location of the nuclear
organizer region (NOR) in cichlids, is supposed to be one
pair of chromosomes [[14], for review] (See Additional
File 1: Available chromosomal data for the Cichlidae
clade). But these results were obtained mostly by silver

Page 9 of 12

nitrate staining, that might not correspond to the real
genomic organization for the 18S rRNA genes. In the
present work FISH probing with the 18S rRNA gene
showed that the Asian cichlid E. maculatus, despite its
rearranged karyotype, has the ancestral condition of 18S
rRNA gene cluster localized in just one pair of chromosomes. In African cichlids it seems that different rearrangements involving the 18S rDNA bearing
chromosome pair have occurred. Compared to the ancestral hypothetical condition, O. niloticus exhibit the most
derived condition of the African species, with multiple
sites of 18S rRNA genes spread in the short arms of 6 st/a
chromosomes, whereas the other African species evidenced a lower number of sites similar to the proposed
ancestral condition.
With the exception of M. festivus, which has five
marked chromosomes, the 18S rRNA gene probing in all
Neotropical cichlids revealed a single pair of 18S rDNA
bearer chromosomes, which is probably the ancestral
condition for the group [37]. The 18S rRNA genes were
previously mapped in one chromosome pair in G. brasiliensis and C. facetum [41]. Furthermore, the location of
18S rRNA gene clusters in the short arms of a st/a chromosome pair appears to be common for several species
(A. tetramerus, L. dorsigera and H. efasciatus). Another
pattern for 18S rRNA gene position is represented by a
large pair of m/sm with interstitial clusters, probably produced by paracentric inversion, in A. ocellatus, C. flavescens, B. cupido, C. lepidota. On the other hand, despite
having the supposed ancestral karyotype, Cichla kelberi
has the 18S rDNA cluster located in the terminal position
of the long arm of a large acrocentric pair, what seems to
be a derived condition for the group. Previous data on
18S rDNA distribution on species of Symphysodon (Symphysodon aequifasciatus, Symphysodon discus and Symphysodon haraldi) showed variations from 2-5 sites [42].
Considering that Symphysodon (Heroini representative)
represents the most derived taxa inside the Cichlinae
[13], the spread of rDNA sites seems to have followed the
diversification of the subfamily.
The 18S rDNA sites were mostly coincident with secondary constrictions observed in the Giemsa stained
karyotypes. Heteromorphic sites of the 18S rDNA was
frequent in some species of the analyzed Neotropical
cichlids as A. ocellatus, C. flavescens, B. cupido, C. lepidota, S jurupari and H. efasciatus, that could indicate a
process of unequal crossover or differential rDNA amplification between the homologous chromosomes.
The variation observed in the chromosomal distribution of rDNA sites is not informative in relation to the
phylogeny of the family Cichlidae. Repeated DNAs like
the major ribosomal RNA multigene families are subject
to the action of several molecular mechanisms and are
thought to be the most rapidly evolving components of

Poletto et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/50

eukaryotic genomes [43,44]. The highly dynamic evolutionary rate of repeated elements generated patterns of
chromosomal organization that do not represent the phylogeny of the groups. Among fishes, the chromosomal
distribution of rDNA clusters can be informative for
comparative analysis of closely related species or even to
the characterization of populational variations. The distribution of 18S rDNA in three species of Symphysodon
(Symphysodon aequifasciatus, Symphysodon discus and
Symphysodon haraldi), showed intra and interspecies
variations both in the number and in the size of the sites
[42]. So, care should be exercised in making phylogenetic
inferences based on rDNA cytogenetic map data, at least
for comparisons involving higher taxa.

Conclusions
Although different events of chromosomal rearrangements have acted during the evolutionary history of
cichlids, it was possible to identify characteristic chromosome patterns for the subfamilies Pseudocrenilabrinae
(African) and Cichlinae (American). The karyotype analyses did not clarify the phylogenetic relationship among
the Cichlinae tribes. On the other hand, the two major
groups of the African Pseudocrenilabrinae, tilapiine and
haplochromine, were clearly discriminated based on the
characteristics of their karyotype. The cytogenetic mapping of 18S rRNA genes did not identify markers useful
for studying the chromosomal diversification of the
Cichlidae clade, possible as a consequence of the rapid
evolution of the repeated units of rRNA genes that generates divergent patterns of chromosomal distribution even
among closely related species.
Methods
Specimens and chromosome preparation

In the present work we analyzed one species of South
Indian cichlid obtained from a commercial source, 22
species of African cichlids, some obtained from commercial sources and some from wild stocks (mainly from the
Lake Malawi, East Africa) maintained at the Tropical
Aquaculture Facility of University of Maryland, USA
(Table 1), and 30 South American cichlid species collected from several South American hydrographic systems (Table 2). The fishes were euthanized with a lethal
dose of benzocaine followed by spinal section (Protocol
01204 - Committee of Ethical in Animal Experimentation
- UNESP - São Paulo State University, Brazil) before
removal of kidneys for chromosome preparation.
Mitotic chromosome preparations were obtained from
kidney according to [45]. In attempt to obtain a larger
number of metaphases of good quality, animals were
injected with a bread yeast solution 12-24 hours prior the
dissection. Animals were treated with a 0.025% solution

Page 10 of 12

of colchicine (1 ml/100 g weigh body) 40 minutes before
euthanasia and chromosome preparation. The kidney tissues were dissected and the cells dissociated with the use
of a syringe in a hypotonic solution of KCl 0.075% and
kept in this solution for 30 to 50 min. The cells were fixed
in 3:1 methanol-acetic acid and used to prepare slides
that were stained with Giemsa solution 5% in phosphate
buffer at pH 7 for 10 min.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization

The 18S rRNA gene was isolated via PCR (Polymerase
Chain Reaction) from the genome of O. niloticus and
used as probes for fluorescence in situ chromosome
hybridization (FISH) in 26 representative species of
Cichlidae including Asian, African and South American
species (Tables 1 and 2). Copies of the 18S rRNA gene
were amplified with the primers 18Sf (5'-CCG CTT TGG
TGA CTC TTG AT) and 18Sr (5'-CCG AGG ACC TCA
CTA AAC CA), which were designed based upon the
sequence of the catfish Ictalurus punctatus (GenBank
accession number AF021880) to amplify an approximately 1,400 base pairs (bp) DNA segment of the 18S
rRNA gene.
Mitotic chromosomes were subjected to FISH [46]
(Pinkel et al. 1986) using the PCR products from the 18S
rRNA genes as probes. The probes were labeled by nick
translation with biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche). The metaphase chromosome
slides were incubated with RNase (40 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at
37°C. After, the chromosomal DNA was denatured in
70% formamide, 2× SSC for 4 min at 70°C. The hybridization mixtures, which contained 100 ng of the denatured
probe, 10 mg/ml dextran sulfate, 2× SSC and 50% formamide in a final volume of 30 μl, were dropped on the
slides, and the hybridization was performed overnight at
37°C in a 2× SSC moist chamber. Post-hybridization
washes were carried out at 37°C in 2× SSC, 50% formamide for 15 min, followed by a second wash in 2× SSC for
15 min and a final wash at room temperature in 4× SSC
for 15 min. Detection of the labeled probes was carried
out with Avidin-FITC (Sigma) or antidigoxigenin-rhodamin (Roche). Chromosomes were counterstained with
propidium iodide (0.2%) or DAPI (Sigma) diluted in antifade (Vector).
Chromosome analysis

The chromosome spreads were analyzed using an Olympus BX 61 microscope, and the images were captured
with the Olympus DP71 digital camera with the software
Image-Pro MC 6.0. Karyotypes were arranged in order of
decreasing chromosome size and the chromosomes classified as meta/submetacentric (m/sm), subtelo/acrocentrics (st/a) and microchromosomes.
