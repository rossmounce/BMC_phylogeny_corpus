Background: HinT proteins are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and belong to the superfamily of
HIT proteins, which are characterized by an histidine-triad sequence motif. While the eukaryotic variants
hydrolyze AMP derivates and modulate transcription, the function of prokaryotic HinT proteins is less
clearly defined. In Mycoplasma hominis, HinT is concomitantly expressed with the proteins P60 and P80,
two domains of a surface exposed membrane complex, and in addition interacts with the P80 moiety.
Results: An cluster of hitABL genes, similar to that of M. hominis was found in M. pulmonis, M. mycoides
subspecies mycoides SC, M. mobile and Mesoplasma florum. RT-PCR analyses provided evidence that the
P80, P60 and HinT homologues of M. pulmonis were polycistronically organized, suggesting a genetic and
physical interaction between the proteins encoded by these genes in these species. While the hit loci of
M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium encoded, in addition to HinT, a protein with several transmembrane
segments, the hit locus of Ureaplasma parvum encoded a pore-forming protein, UU270, a P60 homologue,
UU271, HinT, UU272, and a membrane protein of unknown function, UU273. Although a full-length
mRNA spanning the four genes was not detected, amplification of all intergenic regions from the center
of UU270 to the end of UU273 by RT-PCR may be indicative of a common, but unstable mRNA.
In Chlamydiaceae the hit gene is flanked upstream by a gene predicted to encode a metal dependent
hydrolase and downstream by a gene putatively encoding a protein with ARM-repeats, which are known
to be involved in protein-protein interactions. In RT-PCR analyses of C. pneumoniae, regions comprising
only two genes, Cp265/Cp266 and Cp266/Cp267 were able to be amplified. In contrast to this in vivo
interaction analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro immune co-precipitation revealed an
interaction between Cp267, which contains the ARM repeats, Cp265, the predicted hydrolase, and Cp266,
the HinT protein.
Conclusion: In the Mollicutes HinT proteins were shown to be linked with membrane proteins while in
the Chlamydiaceae they were genetically and physically associated with cytoplasmic proteins, one of which
is predicted to be a metal-dependent phosphoesterase. Future work will elucidate whether these differing
associations indicate that HinT proteins have evolved independently or are indeed two hotspots of a
common sphere of action of bacterial HinT proteins.

Background
The detection of an unusual, highly conserved sequence
motif "His-phi-His-phi-His-phi-phi" (phi representing
hydrophobic amino acids) in a variety of organisms of all
kingdoms led to the definition of a new family of proteins
named HIT (histidine triad) [1]. This family has three
main branches: the fragile histidine triad (FHit)-related
proteins found in animals and fungi, which act as di-adenosine polyphosphate hydrolases and function as tumor
suppressors in humans and mice [2] (although the tumor
suppressing function is not dependent on ApppA hydrolysis [3]), the GalT (galactose 1 phosphate uridylytransferase) homologues, which have a modified "His-phi-Hisphi-Gln" motif, which transfers nucleoside monophosphates to phosphorylated secondary substrates rather
than hydrolyzing them [4], and the Histidine-triad nucleotide binding (HinT) homologues, which in eukaryotes
are intracellular receptors and hydrolases of purine mononucleotides [5]. Although HinT homologues are found in
all kingdoms and this family is the most ancient and
widespread branch of the HIT proteins, the cellular function, the substrates and the interaction partners of HinT
proteins are largely unknown. In prokaryotes, knowledge
of HinT proteins is generally restricted to sequence analyses. In the cell wall-less prokaryote Mycoplasma hominis,
the cytoplasmic HinT protein interacts with a surface
localized membrane complex by binding to the P80 moiety. Interestingly, the genes encoding P80 and P60, the
domains of the membrane complex, form an operon with
the HinT gene [6]. The identification of a homologous hit
locus in M. pulmonis and access to several sequenced
prokaryotic genomes enabled us, in this study, to hypothetically identify interaction partners and thus propose a
functional role for HinT in bacteria with small genomes.

Results
To find out more about the function of prokaryotic HinT
proteins we first analyzed the hit loci of bacteria with a
restricted genome, with the view that they might represent
a model for organisms possessing the minimal genetic
make-up essential for life as a free-living organism. As
polycistronically organized genes often encode proteins
that are functionally related (e.g. in a protein-complex formation or as part of a common pathway) we ran a search
of known genome sequences for genes closely neighbouring or overlapping the hit gene. Species from the Mollicutes
and the Chlamydiaceae fulfill these requirements and were
thus analyzed.
Mollicutes are phenotypically distinguished from other
bacteria by their minute size and total lack of a cell wall.
They have evolved as a branch of gram-positive bacteria
by a process of reductive evolution. The significant
genome "condensation" (for example the genome of M.
genitalium is only 580 kbp) was made possible by adopt-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/27

ing a parasitic behavior. The primary habitats of human
and animal mycoplasmas are the mucous surfaces which
they colonize during infection [7]. While the intracellular
localization of Mollicutes in insect tissues is well established, cell entry of human or animal mycoplasmas seems
to be rare and possibly mediated by a site-directed, receptor-mediated event found in chlamydia [8]. However,
Chlamydiaceae have a number of features in common with
mycoplasmas: their small genomes predict a limited metabolic capability, their major target tissue are mucous
membranes and they also cause ocular and sexually transmitted diseases. In contrast, the chlamydia are obligateintracellular bacteria that undergo a unique developmental cycle in which is an alteration in size between the small
metabolically inactive infectious elementar body and the
relatively large, metabolically active reticular body which
is adapted for intracellular growth [9]. Bearing in mind,
that in M. hominis the HinT-interacting protein is a
secreted antigen and thus predicted to play a role in the
pathogenicity of mycoplasmas we expand this analysis to
include a family of obligate-intracellular organisms
known to secrete antigens in the inclusion body in the
infected cell.
Organization of the hit-locus in Mollicutes
Hit loci with a genomic organization comparable to that
of M. hominis [6], with the hitAB genes encoding two
membrane proteins and hitL encoding the cytoplasmic
HinT, were detected in nearly half of the mollicute
genomes analyzed (Figure 1A). The highest similarity was
found with the hit locus of M. pulmonis. The MYPU_0080
encoded protein had 44.3 % identity to the M. hominis
HinT protein, and the predicted MYPU_0060 and
MYPU_0070 proteins were 23.8 % and 26.6 % identical
to the membrane proteins P80 and P60 of M. hominis,
which were encoded by hitAB. MYPU_0060 had structural
features similar to those of P80, with an amino-terminal
signal sequence with a predicted signal peptidase I (SPase
I) cleavage site and a predominantly alpha-helical structure [10]. MYPU_0070 began with an amino-terminal signal sequence of transmembrane helix (from AA 5 to AA
20) and a signal peptidase II recognition site with a lipoprotein attachment site at position 27. Thus, MYPU_0070
of M. pulmonis appears to encode a P60 homologue, a
cysteine-anchored lipoprotein. The order of genes within
the hit loci of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (MSC), Mesoplasma florum (MF) and M. mobile (MMOB) was similar
with two genes predicted to encode membrane proteins
and a downstream hitL gene. The similarities between the
predicted sequences of MSC_0500, MF_235 and
MMOB_910, and P80 of M. hominis were quite low and
the proteins would be significantly larger than P80. While
MMOB_910 contained a signal peptidase I recognition
site, like P80, MSC_0500 and MF_235 were pro-lipoproteins with an amino-terminal SPase II recognition

following species: A) M. pulmonis, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, Mesoplasma florum and M. mobile containing genes homologous to hitABL of M. hominis; B) U. parvum, M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium, each containing a gene upstream of hitL predicted
to encode an integral pore-forming protein; and C) C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, C. muridarum and C. caviae containing hitL
flanking genes predicted to encode, upstream, a protein with the signature sequence of a metal-dependent hydrolase (light blue

which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Triangles indicate signal peptidase recognition sites of SPase I and

sequence. Only MSC_500 was predicted to have a predominantly alpha-helical structure, MF_235 being predicted to have a secondary structure of alternate alpha
helical and beta sheet regions and MMOB_910 to consist
mainly of beta sheets (data not shown). The proteins
encoded by the gene next to hitL had little similarity with
P60 of M. hominis when the whole sequence was compared. However, when the P60 protein region from AA
164 to AA 177 (CS1; ELQKMLLAKLYLLK) was used, iden-

tities of 43 % (MMOB_900) to 57% (MYPU_0070) were
detected and scrutiny of the sequence from AA 226 to AA
234 (CS2; LYLMKYLVE) revealed 60 % (MYPU_0070) to
70 % identity (MMOB_900). The corresponding proteins
of Mesoplasma florum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC
did not contain these conserved sequences. The different
HinT homologues had the highest identity with the HinT
protein of M. hominis, ranging from 44.3 % (MF_233) to
55.7 % (MMOB_890).

Hit loci with a different genomic organization were identified in the mollicutes Ureaplasma parvum,M. pneumoniae
and M. genitalium (Figure 1B). While UU271 of U. parvum,
the gene immediately upstream of hitL encoded a putative
P60 homologue possessing the P60 consensus sequences
CS1 (35.7 % identity) and CS2 (30% identity), it differed
from all other P60 homologues in possessing a SPase I recognition sequence and two other transmembrane helices
(AA 355 to AA 375 and AA 407 to AA 427). The UU273
gene, immediately downstream of hitL, encoded a protein
with two transmembrane spanning helices, but with no
significant similarity to other known proteins. The
deduced protein sequence of UU270 did not have any
sequence similarity with P80. With six transmembrane
segments, it appeared more likely to form a pore than to
be surface exposed. The organization of the hit locus of U.
parvum appeared intermediate between the hit loci
described above and those of M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium. The sequence identity between the ureaplasma
HinT and the HinT proteins of M. pneumoniae (42.7 %)
and M. genitalium (47.4 %) was higher than that between
HinT of U. parvum and M. hominis (39.2 %), and the genes
immediately upstream of hitL encoded proteins with
seven (MPN_274) or five (MG_133) transmembrane
domains (Figure 1B). MPN_274 is predicted to encode a
permease of an ABC transporter [11] suggesting a comparable function in M. genitalium and probably also in U.
parvum. Thus, these hit loci of Mollicutes analyzed appear
to have a hitL gene flanked by genes that are predicted to
encode membrane-anchored proteins.
As in M. gallisepticum, the hitL gene is not flanked by other
genes on the same strand, also exceptions of a polycistronic organization of the hitL gene seem to exist within
the Mollicutes.
Organization of the hit loci in Chlamydiaceae
In the obligately intra cellular Chlamydiaceae the order of
genes within the hit loci and the function of the encoded
proteins appeared to be highly conserved, but distinctly
different from that of the Mollicutes (Figure 1C). In all
chlamydial species analyzed, the gene upstream of hitL
encoded a putative cytoplasmic protein with the signature
sequence of a metal-dependent protein hydrolase and a
large number of metal binding residues (IPR003226/
UPF0160), probably indicative of a phosphoesterase
function, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding OB fold (IPR008994). The deduced protein sequence
of the gene located downstream of hitL contained a 37–47
AA long tandemly repeated ARM repeat fold
(IPR008938), which forms a right-handed superhelix and
has been implicated in the mediation of protein-protein
interactions [12]. Cp267 contained an RGD motif, which
plays a role in cell adhesion [13]. However, the presence
of RGD in a sequence alone is not sufficient to suggest a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/27

biological function for this motif [14]. The presence of
two transmembrane helices (AA 314 to AA 334 and AA
428 to AA 448) suggested that it is more likely that Cp267
may interact with the bacterial cell membrane. In all other
chlamydial species analyzed, the Cp267 homologues did
not contain domains suggestive of membrane
attachment.
Are the hit loci genes co-expressed?
In bacteria, overlapping genes on the same coding strand
may indicate the polycistronic organization of these
genes, and co-expressed proteins are often related in
function.

As the hit locus of M. hominis is an operon containing
three genes [6] the next step was to analyze whether the
polycistronic organization of hit genes was conserved
within the Mollicutes and whether this also occurred in
Chlamydiaceae. Initially, we chose M. pulmonis, the species
with the greatest similarity to M. hominis, for reverse transcription (RT) PCR analysis. To identify the likely boundaries of an mRNA containing MYPU_0060, MYPU_0070
and MYPU_0080, two different primers upstream of the
MYPU_0060/hitA gene and three primers downstream of
the hitL gene were used (Fig. 2A). Amplification occurred
with primers binding just upstream of the predicted promoter regions 1 or 2 and just downstream of the TAA stop
codon of the hitL gene (Fig. 2B, lanes A and B) indicating
a polycistronic mRNA. Amplification was not seen with a
primer hybridizing to the sequence downstream of a predicted hairpin loop structure after the TAA stop codon of
hitL (Figure 2B, lanes C1 and C2) suggesting that the
mRNA terminates at the predicted hairpin structure.
Next, we examined the genes flanking hitL in U. parvum.
Amplicons which spanned the intergenic regions were
obtained with primers hybridizing to the center of UU270
and to the 3'-end of UU272 (Fig. 3C), and with primers
hybridizing to the 5'-end of UU271 and to the 3'-end of
UU273 (Fig. 3D). No amplification occurred with a
primer hybridizing to the 5'-end of UU270 and the 3'-end
of hitL (Fig. 3A and 3B). These data suggest that HinT is
expressed with the flanking genes UU271 and UU273.
These findings are in accordance with the predicted termination of transcription by a hairpin loop with a stem
energy of -9.1 kcal mole-1 located 33 nt downstream of the
UU273 gene [15]. Of the organisms analyzed so far U. parvum was the most demanding organism of the Mollicutes
in terms of DNA-free, full-length total RNA preparation.
Thus the detection of a common RNA from the center of
UU270 up to UU273 (Fig. 3D) may be due to an unstable
RNA or indicatory for UU270 not taking part in the
operon structure.

operon. No amplification occurred when a primer pair

Interactions between the proteins encoded by the hit locus
of C. pneumoniae
As the stability of an RNA is increased in regions with pronounced secondary structures, such as transcriptional terminators, and is often decreased in regions lacking such
protective structures [17], partial degradation of the
chlamydial mRNA may have occurred. The results from
RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA of CP265, Cp266 and
Cp267 suggest an operon producing a transient mRNA
thus suggesting a physical interaction between the products of these genes. Therefore we analyzed the interactions

between Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 using the yeast twohybrid system [18]. The system is based on the modular
organization of the transcription factor GAL4, which has
a DNA-binding domain (DB) and an activation domain
(AD). When GAL4 binds (via DB) to its cognate binding
site, the activation domain AD is brought close to the promoter and activates transcription of the reporter genes
lacZ and HIS3. In the yeast two-hybrid system these two
domains, which alone are not able to activate transcription, are separately cloned into pGADT7 (AD) and
pGBKT7 (BD) and expressed in fusion with the proteins
under investigation. Growth of a histidine dependent
yeast strain on histidine deficient media will only occur
after transformation with both plasmids if the AD and DB
domains are apposed by an interaction between the
fusion proteins, which will result in transcription of the
reporter genes. The plasmids pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-53,

RT-PCR analysis of C. pneumoniae. A. Below the schematic of the hit locus of C. pneumoniae the positions of the PCR
amplicons (A – F) are shown. Genomic DNA (g), cDNA (c) and RNA without RT reaction (r) are used as templates. B. The
PCR products were separated on a 0.8 % agarose gel and subjected to Southern blot analysis with DIG-labeled probes hybridizing to Cp265 (A, D), Cp266 / hitL (B, E) Cp267 (C, F) with visualization using chemiluminescence. In E, the signals of lower

which encode the SV40 large T-antigen and the murine
p53 protein, respectively served as a positive control (Fig.
5 K+; Fig. 6A).
HinT is known to dimerize [19,20]. We introduced the
coding region of M. hominis HinT into both pGADT7 and
pGBKT7 and transformed the histidine dependent yeast
strain AH109 with them. Quantification of transcriptional
activation of the reporter gene was achieved using a liquid
β-galactosidase assay measuring the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β, D-galactopyranoside (MUG), yielding
the fluorescent molecule 4-methylumbelliferone (4 MU).
As expected, dimerization of the fused HinT peptides led
to apposition of the AD and DB domains generating a
functional transcription factor. The transcription of the
reporter genes resulted in growth of the yeast on histidinedeficient agar plates (Fig. 5, top row, left plate) and production of β-galactosidase (Fig. 6C). Next we analyzed
whether the proteins encoded by the hit locus of C. pneu-

moniae interacted. The coding regions of Cp265, Cp266
and Cp267 were introduced into pGADT7 and pGBKT7
and expressed in yeast in all possible combinations. As
shown in Figure 5, large colonies, comparable in size to
those of the positive control, were produced by yeast that
expressed Cp265 fused to both the binding and the activation domain. This suggested a strong interaction
between the molecules of the Cp265 protein. All other
combinations of plasmids encoding Cp265, Cp266 and
Cp267 only led to the growth of small colonies, a finding
that was difficult to interpret. To differentiate between
strong and weak interactions, the β-galactosidase assay
was used. As shown in Fig. 6, the measurement of β-galactoside activity indicated an interaction between Cp267
and Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 itself, independent of the
fusion partner (the AD or DB domains of the GAL4 protein). Surprisingly, dimerization of Cp266 (HinT) was not
detected, although Cp265 interacted strongly with itself.

Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity
Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity. In yeast cells, co-transformed with pGADT7 (AD) and pGBKT7 (BD) constructs
as indicated, β-galactosidase activity was quantified using 4-methylumbelliferyl-galactopyranoside (MUG) hydrolysis to the fluorescent molecule, 4-methylumbelliferone (4 MU). The fluorescence of 4 MU was excited at 360 nm and emission measured at
460 nm.

confirmed as both Cp265 and Cp267 were found to
dimerize and there was no interaction between Cp265
and Cp266. Interestingly dimerization of Cp266 (HinT)
which was not detected by the two-hybrid system, was
demonstrated in this co-precipitation assay.

Immune co-precipitation of Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267
To confirm the findings derived from the two-hybrid analyses we performed protein-binding assays in vitro. Protein
C-tagged Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 were expressed in E.
coli and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 7A).
Each protein was then incubated with equal amounts of
[35S]-labeled Cp265, Cp266 or Cp267 in vitro and precipitated with anti-Protein C antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7B,
the supernatants of the different samples contained comparable amounts of the respective isotope labeled proteins. As expected the [35S] labeled Cp proteins alone were
neither precipitated by unrelated membrane proteins,
such as Protein C-tagged OppA of M. hominis nor by the
anti-Protein C-sepharose itself (Fig. 7C). In contrast, an
interaction of Cp266 with Cp267 was suggested by coprecipitation of significant amounts of Cp266 [35S] with
Cp267C, and Cp267 [35S] with Cp266C (Fig. 7C). The
other findings from the two-hybrid analyses were also

Thus, we can conclude that the chlamydial proteins
Cp265, Cp266 (HinT) and Cp267 have a tendency to
dimerize and Cp267 interacts with both Cp265 and
Cp266.

Discussion
A remarkable feature of HinT proteins is their ubiquity.
They are found in all kingdoms ranging from Mycoplasma
genitalium, the smallest prokaryote, to one of the most
complex eukaryotes, the human [1,19]. However the
function of this homo-dimer in the cytoplasm of these different organisms has only been closely examined in
eukaryotes, where it has been characterized as an intracellular receptor for purine ribonucleotides [4,5], especially
for hydrolases of 5'-monophosphoramide substrates such
as AMP-lysine [21], with the histidine triad motif forming
the α-phosphate binding site [20]. HinT has been shown
to associate with the protein microphthalmia, an

important transcription factor that controls growth and
function in mast cells and melanocytes [22], to interact
with the human cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7), a subunit of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase
Cdk7/Kin28 [23], and to act as a positive regulator of the
yeast Cdk7 homologue Kin28 [21]. That it may not be the
key regulator of Cdk7 activity was recently suggested by
analysis of HinT-/- knock-out mice [24]. This led to the
hypothesis that eukaryotic HinT homologues are involved
in the regulation of transcriptional processes by hydrolyzing related adenylyl-modified proteins [25].
The observation that HinT homologues are ubiquitous
and that they are even encoded by the smallest bacterial
genomes, suggests that HinT was present at the cellular
root of the tree of life and that its preservation is
advantageous for the survival of cells [20]. However the
function of bacterial HinT homologues seems to be quite
different from those of eukaryotes. In M. hominis HinT
had been demonstrated to interact both physically and
genetically with a surface-localized membrane complex
by binding to the P80 domain [6]. The data presented

here suggest that the co-expression of HinT with membrane proteins is prevalent within the Mollicutes. Comparable organization of the hit-loci was found in Mycoplasma
hominis, M. pulmonis, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, M.
mobile and Mesoplasma florum. Analysis of further genomes
will most likely lengthen this list. A genomic DNA fragment of M. bovis encoding the amino-terminal end of a
P80 homologue has been sequenced and this homologue
is predicted to possess an SPase I cleavage site. In M.
hyorhinis, a nearly complete hit locus, encoding P80, P60
and HinT homologues has been found adjacent to a
genomic region encoding the high affinity transport system (personal communication of Michael Calcutt,
Columbia, MO, USA) [26]. The organization of the hitABL
genes in an operon, as recently demonstrated for M. hominis [6] and shown here for M. pulmonis, suggests polycistronic expression of the hit loci genes. However, it remains
to be elucidated whether the encoded proteins have comparable functions to those already shown in M. hominis.
P80 of M. hominis was recently shown to reside in the
membrane as a precursor protein and to be secreted into
the extra cellular milieu as a 10 kDa smaller antigen.

Page 10 of 14

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:27

Processing of P80 was suggested to be initiated by SPase I
cleavage [27]. While the P80 homologues in M. mobile
and M. bovis also contained signal sequences for SPase I
cleavage, those in M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and Mesoplasma florum were putative pro-lipoproteins. Secretion
of lipoproteins has been observed in M. hominis [6] and
other bacteria [28], indicating that similar function may
be still possible.
M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium each had only one gene
adjacent to hitL encoding a pore-forming protein with
homologies to ABC permeases, suggesting they are part of
a distinct phylogenetic branch. Interestingly, in M. penetrans the gene upstream of hitL also encodes a protein of
an ABC transporter, an ATPase [29]. The hit locus of U.
parvum, which contained a P60 homologue and a gene
encoding a permease, may have functions that are a
hybrid of those of M. hominis and the M. pneumoniae
groups. RT-PCR analyses infer the presence of a mRNA
encoding HinT and UU271, a P60-homologue, and a
membrane protein of unknown function. Thus, the interaction of HinT with membrane proteins seems to be a
common phenomenon in Mollicutes.
A quite different situation was detected in the Chlamydiaceae. Although we were not able to establish definitely
the presence of a polycistronic mRNA derived from the
three genes comprising hit locus, the overlap of the hitL
gene with the upstream gene, as well as the conserved
order of the three genes within the hit loci of Chlamydiaceae, suggested a relationship between the gene products. Analysis of Cp265, Cp266 (HinT) and Cp267 in the
yeast two-hybrid system and immune co-precipitation
assays confirmed our hypothesis that these proteins interacted and demonstrated that they form homo-dimers.
Cp267, a protein with large areas of ARM repeats, which
are known to mediate protein-protein interactions [30],
was shown to interact with HinT, a protein known in
eukaryotes to influence transcriptional activation, as well
as with Cp265, a putative metal-dependent hydrolase
with a binding fold for short, single stranded nucleic
acids. These findings suggest that in Chlamydiaceae, the
function of HinT may be more closely related to intracellular processes than to interactions with the extracellular
milieu, as suggested by the findings on Mollicutes.

Conclusion
The data presented here demonstrate that HinT proteins
of the Chlamydiaceae associate with probable cytosolic
proteins likely to function in the regulation of cellular
processes, such as nucleotide metabolism. This function
would be similar to that of homologues in eukaryotes,
where HinT has been shown to influence transcription.
The finding that HinT proteins of the Mollicutes interact
both physically and genetically with membrane proteins

may reflect a phylogenic shift towards a different function
in this group, or may indicate an additional function of
bacterial HinT proteins. Our future work will focus on
decoding the intra- and extra-cellular processes that bacterial HinT proteins are involved in.

Methods
DNA manipulations
All routine DNA manipulation techniques, including
plasmid preparation, restriction endonuclease analysis,
ligation and transformation of E. coli were performed as
described by Sambrook et al. [31] or according to the
manufacturers' recommendations (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, and Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).
Bacterial strains and plasmids
The plasmids pXB (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany), pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (BD Bioscience Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) were used as expression vectors for
the heterologous expression of Cp265, Cp266 and
Cp267. The pXB plasmids were propagated in Escherichia
coli DH5α F'(Life Technologies), pGADT7 and pGBKT7 in
yeast AH109 cells (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto,
CA USA).
Sequence analysis
Analysis of the DNA and protein sequences and the design
of oligonucleotides were facilitated by the Lasergene software (DNA Star Inc., Madison Wisc.).

The genomes listed in table 1 were analyzed using the web

tant relation-ships between HinT protein sequences of the
analyzed Mollicutes were determined by using the BLAST
method through Molligen 1.4 [32]. Conserved domains
of proteins were predicted using the Conserved Domain
Database (CDD) or the InterPro service (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml, http://

RT-PCR
RNA was prepared from exponential phase cultures of M.
pulmonis and U. parvum as described by Chomczynski and
Sacchi [33]. Chlamydophila pneumoniae respiratory isolate
GiD was used for all experiments [34]. Chlamydial RNA
was prepared from HEp-2 cells 2 days post-infection as
described by Mölleken et al. (Mölleken et al., manuscript
in preparartion). Before use as a template for RT-PCR,
contaminating traces of DNA were digested with DNase I
as described previously [35]. Overlapping regions of the
Ureaplasma and Chlamydophila genes were amplified using
the Expand Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) by standard PCR conditions (ini-

min at 50°C (U. parvum) or 58°C (C. pneumoniae), 2.5
min at 68°C). The hit operon of M. pulmonis was amplified using the Expand Long Template PCR system by
standard PCR conditions (initial cycle of 5 min at 95°C;
10 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 44°C, 4 min at 68°C;
addition of 0.5 U polymerase; then 20 cycles of 1 min at
95°C, 30 sec at 44°C, 4 min (+ 20 sec per cycle) at 68 °C).
Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously [6].
Construction of plasmids
The regions encoding Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 in C.
pneumoniae GiD [34] were amplified by PCR with the
primers Cp1 to Cp6 (Table 2). The amplicons were cut at
the primer-introduced restriction endonuclease cleavage
sites for BamHI and SacI, and ligated in-frame into the
expression vector pGADT7. The EcoRI/SacI inserts in the
pGADT7 constructs were then ligated in-frame into EcoRI/
PstI-digested pGBKT7.

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:27

For heterologous expression of the protein-C tagged proteins, CP265C, Cp266C and Cp267C, in E. coli, the Cp
inserts of the respective pGADT7 plasmids were digested
with SacI, the ends bluntened by incubation with 3 units
S1 nuclease (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany)
for 30 min at 37°C and subsequently cut with EcoRI. The
blunt-end/EcoRI digested Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 fragments were cloned in-frame into the blunt-end/EcoRI
digested plasmid pXB and propagated in E. coli Dh5α F'.
All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 373 A machine) [36].
Expression and purification of Cp265C, Cp266C and
Cp267C
One liter of LB broth (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies Inc.,
Gaithersburg, USA) containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml)
was inoculated with the respective E. coli DH5α F' clone
and incubated for 16 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20
min, 4°C) and frozen at -70°C. After thawing on ice, the
cells were resuspended in 40 ml buffer A (120 mM NaCl,
1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and disrupted by
three repeated freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, followed by three bursts of sonication on ice (5 min bursts at
95 W with a 1 min cooling period between each burst).
Insoluble material was sedimented (15,000 × g, 20 min,
4°C) and the supernatant was transferred to an anti-Protein C affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany). Bound proteins were eluted from the anti-Protein C affinity matrix with 2 mM EDTA.
SDS-PAGE and immunostaining of proteins
Proteins were separated on 12 or 15 % polyacrylamide
gels [37], transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and
Schüll, Dassel, Germany) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Phase, Mölln, Germany) [38], and immunostained
using anti-Protein C peroxidase (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany), anti HA-antibody (pGADT7) or
anti c-myc antibody (pGBKT7) (BD Bioscience Clontech,
Palo Alto, USA).
Immune co-precipitation assay
The [35S]-labeled Cp265, Cp266 and Cp267 proteins were
generated from pGADT7 and pGBKT7 fusion vectors by in
vitro translation using a T7 coupled transcription/translation system in the presence of [35S]-methionine
(Promega, Madison, USA). Two micrograms of purified
Protein C-tagged protein were incubated with 10 µl of the
[35S]-labeled protein in buffer B (20 mM Tris/HCl (pH
7.5), 75 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 (v/
v) % Igepal, 2 mM DTT, 10 (v/v) % glycerol and 2 mM
CaCl2) for 1 h [39]. Thereafter, a 5 µl aliquot of a slurry of
the anti-Protein C matrix, equilibrated in buffer B containing 5 µg BSA, was added to each sample and the mix-

ture further incubated for 1 h. The Protein C-matrix was
washed eight times in buffer B, resuspended in 20 µl of
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min.
The proteins were then analyzed by 15 % SDS-PAGE and
autoradiography using a phosphorimager (Fujifilm FLA
3000).
Yeast two-hybrid assays
The MATCHMAKER Gal4 two-hybrid system (BD Bioscience Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) was used for interaction
assays. AH109 cells were co-transformed with the Cp265,
Cp266 or Cp267 expressing pGADT-T7 and pGBKT7 plasmids, grown in small scale cultures and plated onto histidine deficient agar plates, followed by a β-galactosidase
colony lift filter assay. All procedures were carried out as
outlined in the BD Bioscience Clontech protocol. The βgalactosidase assay was performed after the inoculation of
7.5 ml YPD Medium with 0.5 ml overnight culture in
selective medium and incubation for five hours at 30°C
until the culture reached an OD600 of 0.4 to 0.6. The cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min
and re-suspended in 300 µl Buffer Z (Na2HPO4+ 7 × H2O,
NaH2PO4 + 4 × H2O, KCl, MgSO4 × 7 H2O, pH7.0). Lysis
of the cells was achieved with four cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37°C. Soluble and insoluble
components were separated by centrifugation at 14000 ×
g for 2 min. The β-galactosidase activity was measured
using a FluorAce™ β-galactosidase Reporter Assay kit (BioRad, Hercules, USA).
