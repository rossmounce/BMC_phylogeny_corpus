Abstract
Background: In the past decade, the availability of complete genome sequence data has greatly
facilitated comparative genomic research aimed at addressing genetic variability within species.
More recently, analysis across species has become feasible, especially in genera where genome
sequencing projects of multiple species have been initiated. To understand the genesis of the
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis within a genus where the majority of species are harmless
environmental organisms, we have used genome sequence data from 16 mycobacteria to look for
evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) associated with the emergence of pathogenesis. First,
using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of 20 housekeeping genes across these species, we
derived a phylogeny that serves as the basis for HGT assignments. Next, we performed alignment
searches for the 3989 proteins of M. tuberculosis H37Rv against 15 other mycobacterial genomes,
generating a matrix of 59835 comparisons, to look for genetic elements that were uniquely found
in M. tuberculosis and closely-related pathogenic mycobacteria. To assign when foreign genes were
likely acquired, we designed a bioinformatic program called mycoHIT (mycobacterial homologue
investigation tool) to analyze these data in conjunction with the MLSA-based phylogeny.
Results: The bioinformatic screen predicted that 137 genes had been acquired by HGT at different
phylogenetic strata; these included genes coding for metabolic functions and modification of
mycobacterial lipids. For the majority of these genes, corroborating evidence of HGT was obtained,
such as presence of phage or plasmid, and an aberrant GC%.
Conclusion: M. tuberculosis emerged through vertical inheritance along with the step-wise addition
of genes acquired via HGT events, a process that may more generally describe the evolution of
other pathogens.

Background
Bacterial evolution can occur through either the modification of vertically inherited genes or the acquisition of new
genes. In the former process, duplication of genes and
neo-functionalization represent molecular events for
selection to act upon. In the latter process, transformation

(acquisition of naked DNA), transduction (acquisition of
DNA via a phage infection) and conjugation (acquisition
of DNA via a plasmid or a mobile element) represent
mechanisms whereby bacteria can incorporate new genes
[1]. These modes of acquiring new genetic material are
collectively referred to as horizontal gene transfer (HGT)

and represent an important means by which an organism
can exploit a new condition, such as a pathogenic lifestyle
[2,3].
In general, the determination that HGT has occurred is
inferred by study at the species level, comparing virulent
strains versus others strains within the species. In mycobacteria, gene acquisition has been implicated in the
recent and rapid evolution of M. ulcerans from M. marinum via acquisition of a virulence plasmid [4]. Additionally, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis has acquired strainspecific genetic elements that are not present in the related
environmental organism M. avium subsp. hominissuis [5,6].
The role of HGT in the recent evolution of M. tuberculosis
has also been the subject of study, looking at genes in
modern M. tuberculosis lacking from isolates referred to as
M. prototuberculosis [7,8]. Unlike the recent evolution, the
role of HGT in shaping evolution of microorganisms over
a longer time-span, at the genus-level, has received decidedly less attention.
Recently, the availability of genome sequence data for
multiple species of a genus has permitted across-species
comparisons for gene content. This is particularly pertinent for the genus Mycobacterium. The majority of mycobacteria are non-pathogenic environmental organisms,
but a minority of species, belonging to the slow-growing
sub-lineage, cause important human diseases (M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans, M. kansasii) and veterinary diseases (M. bovis, M. marinum, M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis, M. avium subsp. avium). Because the
majority of pathogenic mycobacteria are situated in the
same sub-lineage of the genus, we hypothesize that these
different species share a common pathogenic potential,
upon which selective pressures specifically resulted in the
unique attributes of each organism. We further hypothesize that comparisons of all available mycobacterial
genome sequences will reveal the degree to which HGT
has contributed to 'old' events during the macro-evolution of pathogenic mycobacteria. To test this, we have performed a comprehensive phylogenetic screen, looking for
HGT events that have contributed sequentially to the genesis of M. tuberculosis. We have also compared these results
with findings derived through a compositional analysis to
assess for the concordance between these methods [7].
Together, the data present a portrait of the slow, step-wise
emergence of virulence, setting the stage for further
molecular studies that define the role of each gene acquisition event in the emergence of M. tuberculosis as an epidemic pathogen.

Methods
Genome sequence data
M. kansasii ATCC 12478T, M. avium subsp. avium ATCC
25291T and M. intracellulare ATCC 13950T were purchased

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/196

from the American Type Culture Collection. After growth
in Middlebrook 7H9 media (Difco Laboratories, Detroit,
MI) containing 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, St louis,
MO) and 10% of Albumin-Dextrose-Catalase (Becton
Dickinson and co., Sparks, MD), genomic DNA was
extracted using a protocol optimized for mycobacterial
DNA, as previously described [9]. Genomic DNA was
used to prepare a library for shotgun sequencing at the
University of Minnesota Biomedical Genomics Center
(M. avium subsp. avium) or the McGill University and
Genome Quebec Innovation Center (M. kansasii and M.
intracellulare). At both centers, sequences were determined
by the Genome Sequencer™ FLX (Roche Applied Science).
The genome of M. kansasii is estimated to be 6.4 Mb in
length, with 33× coverage, and has been deposited in
GenBank as projectID number 30907. The genome of M.
avium subsp avium is estimated to be 4.8 Mb in length,
with 17× coverage, and is deposited in GenBank as projectID number 30909. The genome of M. intracellulare is estimated to be 5.4 Mb in length, with 26× coverage, and is
deposited in GenBank as projectID number 27955.
For other genomes, sequences were obtained at NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi using
the parenthesized accession numbers: M. tuberculosis

(NC_008699).
Multilocus Sequence Analysis-based phylogeny
Multilocus sequence analysis of 20 house-keeping genes
from each mycobacterial genome was performed in order
to uncover their phylogenetic relationships. Chosen genes
were deemed essential for in vitro growth [17] and conserved across all mycobacterial species and the two outgroup species. These genes were also present in the markedly decayed genome of M. leprae, providing further evidence for their conservation. The genes are distributed
throughout the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome: Rv0005gyrB, Rv0041-leuS, Rv0350-dnaK, Rv0440-groEL2,
Rv0667-rpoB, Rv0684-fusA1, Rv0704-rplB, Rv1098-fum,

Rv3646-topA. For an out-group, we used orthologues of

these genes in two related members of the order Actinomycetales: Rhodococcus jostii and Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152.
For each gene, representative sequences were obtained
and aligned in MEGA 4.1 [18]. Resulting FASTA files were
entered and concatenated in START2 [19] to form a final
38787 bp in-frame semantide. Next, using the NeighborJoining method, we generated an un-rooted phylogenetic
tree at the amino acid level in MEGA 4.1, with 500 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenies were also generated for each
individual protein to determine the concordance of findings on a gene-by-gene basis (data not shown). Notably,
because the situation of M. leprae varied considerably on
a gene-by-gene basis, we have removed this organism
from the MLSA-based tree.
Detection of M. tuberculosis orthologues in other
mycobacterial genomes
To detect M. tuberculosis genes that do or do not have
orthologues in the other genomes, we performed an alignment search with the StandAlone TBLASTN program [20],
using the 3989 predicted proteins from M. tuberculosis as
the query sequences to search for matches in the genomic
DNA of other organisms. With this initial search, we
obtained a matrix of 63824 scores (3989 protein
sequences blasted against 16 genomes) providing two
types of output: categorical (hit versus no hit) and quantitative (degree of similarity). To categorically assign that
there was no hit, we employed the default E-value (or
Expectation value) of e-10 which is provided at NCBI and
has been used in a similar study [21]. Thus, if the statistical significance ascribed to a comparison is greater than
this E value, we assigned a percentage of similarity of 0%
to that comparison.

To analyze quantitative results, we wished to assign
absence of an M. tuberculosis orthologue or presence of an
M. tuberculosis orthologue in the database genome. When
no hit was reported (0% similarity), we determined that
this M. tuberculosis protein has no orthologue in the corresponding database genome. To determine presence of an
orthologue, we performed a sensitivity analysis using different thresholds of the similarity score. In the simplest
model, any hit was considered evidence for an orthologue
(referred hereafter as the 'any hit' threshold). To reduce
the likelihood of false-positive assignments due to lowlevel similarity, we performed an empiric analysis on
sequence-comparison data to define incrementally more
stringent thresholds. As exemplified in the Additional file
1 (Figure S1), the frequency distribution of BLAST similarity scores obtained between M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii
was non-Gaussian, with a right skew. Therefore, we did
not use thresholds guided by the mean and the standard
deviation. Rather, we determined the degree of similarity
at the 95th percentile of hits between the organisms under

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/196

comparison, then at the 90th percentile and finally at the
85th percentile. As the similarity score that met these percentiles varied across different genome comparisons, we
determined these thresholds for each bi-organism comparison before applying these cut-offs to assign orthology.
Phylogeny-based detection of horizontal gene transfer in
M. tuberculosis
To enumerate genes potentially acquired via horizontal
gene transfer, we looked for proteins found only in certain
subsets of the MLSA-based phylogeny. We assumed that a
protein encoded by a foreign gene will be present in at
least some of the descendants of the bacteria that acquired
it, but will be absent from other closely related bacteria. As
an example, for a M. tuberculosis protein with orthologues
in M. kansasii, M. marinum and M. ulcerans, but no orthologue in other mycobacterial sequences, we inferred that
this gene was potentially acquired by the common ancestor of M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. marinum and M. ulcerans. The alternative hypothesis would be that this gene
was present in the ancestral Actinobacteria but lost independently three times (from M. avium-intracellulare, from
rapid-growing mycobacteria, and from Rhodococcus jostii).
This alternative hypothesis was further considered in a
secondary analysis described below under 'sub-classification analysis.'

Therefore, using the MLSA-based phylogeny, we assigned
gene acquisitions into four lists. List A included genes
acquired by the ancestor of all slow-growing mycobacteria, potentially including elements mediating common
pathogenicity mechanisms across these different organisms. List B included genes acquired by the common
ancestor of M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. marinum and M.
ulcerans. List C included genes acquired by the common
ancestor of M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii. List D included
genes unique to M. tuberculosis, acquired after the common ancestor with M. kansasii (see Figure 1).
To facilitate the process of assembling the matrices of similarities into potential HGT assignments, we developed a
software utility called mycoHIT (mycobacterial Homology Investigation Tool). The Software and a help file are
available at http://www.molepi.mcgill.ca. Briefly, mycoHIT is a JAVA application presented through a graphical
user interface. This program serves to perform BLAST
searches, parses the TBLASTN result files with PERL
scripts, in order to select the highest score for each protein.
Obtained data, including the score, are then stored on a
local MYSQL database. Our goal was to define proteins for
which an orthologue was present in one group of organisms (e.g. M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. ulcerans) but for
which there was no orthologue across all of the remaining
organisms (e.g. M. avium-intracellulare, rapid growing
mycobacteria and Rhodococcus jostii). Because this analy-

sis was based on these two criteria of orthology (present
in some, absent from the rest), we were forced to exclude
M. leprae from this analysis because the M. leprae genome
is characterized by pseudogenes and deletions [13] which
resulted in an unacceptable degree of error in categorization of orthologues and an uncertain phylogenetic situation.
To focus our analysis on HGT during the evolution of
slow growing mycobacteria, we selected these 7 genomes
(M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. ulcerans, M. avium subsp.
hominissuis, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, M. avium
subps. avium and M. intracellulare) and the option "compute all combinations for selection" (see Additional file 1
Figure S2-A). Given the selection of these 7 comparisons,
the program generated 128 files (27), representing the lists

of M. tuberculosis genes that have orthologues in 0 to 7
slow growing mycobacterial genomes and lack orthologues in the remaining 9 to 15 genomes (i.e. proteins
with orthologues in n genomes but lacking orthologues in
(15- n) genomes). These lists provide the number of genes
differentially shared across slow-growing mycobacteria in
each of the 128 possible combinations. Subsequently, the
program calculates "special lists", representing the chosen
sum of the previously calculated 128 lists according to the
phylogeny (See additional file 1 – Figure S2-B). These lists
are referred to as lists A, B, C, D. As an example, list B will
be the sum of lists MM (orthologue in M. marinum absent
in all other), MU (orthologue M. ulcerans absent in all
other), MM-MK (orthologues in M. marinum, M. kansasii
absent in all other), MM-MU, MU-MK and MM-MU-MK.

The mycoHIT program was intensively tested to report
potential problems. Furthermore, to ensure that the program sorted genes correctly, we manually performed the
analysis twice using two different thresholds ("any hits"
and 60% identity). Briefly, using EXCEL we sorted genes
and excluded those with hits in at least one of the rapid
growing species or R. jostii. In a second phase, we manually grouped genes into lists A, B, C and D following the
same strategy explained above. As mycoHIT generated the
same genes and numbers at these two thresholds as we
obtained in the manual search, this comparison served to
validate the mycoHIT program.
Sub-classification and characterization of potential HGT
For further analysis, we began with the most inclusive list
obtained through the least restrictive threshold ("any
hit") to avoid the risk of overlooking potentially instructive HGT events. For all these genes, we performed a
blastP of the predicted encoded protein using the NCBI
database composed of 853 bacterial genomes (including
53 Actinobacteria) in order to classify the proteins into four
categories 1) proteins with no blast hits at all in the entire
NCBI database, potentially indicating false-annotation, 2)
proteins that may not represent HGT (putative deletions),
based on presence of homologues in at least two different
genera of Actinobacteria out of the first five taxonomic
classes hits, 3) proteins that provide evidence for HGT but
represent vehicles of HGT, such as transposons, phage,
toxin-antitoxin genes, and 4) proteins with hits in the
NCBI database but one or less hit in the Actinobacteria
class out of the first five taxonomic classes presenting hits,
most likely to represent the bacterial elements acquired
through HGT. Notably, with this approach, we expect that
proteins that are part of a conserved family (e.g. ABC
transporters) will never be assigned as HGT, due to lowsimilarity hits. We partially correct for this possibility
when such a gene was situated in a HGT cluster. To this
end, when a cluster of HGT genes was detected, internal
genes not detected through the phylogenetic analysis were
added if they met the aforementioned criteria (presence of
hits in the NCBI database but one or less hit in Actinobacteria).

For further analysis, we have calculated the proportion of
predicted bacterial HGT associated with an annotated
vehicle of HGT (transposons, phage, toxin-antitoxin
genes) within 5 genes upstream or downstream of the predicted HGT gene or cluster. We enumerated the number of
genes that were located in clusters of two or more putative
HGT genes. Schematic representation of GC content
across a given region was obtained using Bio-Annotator
from VectorNTI (Invitrogen) using 2000 bp windows.
Finally, we compared this list of genes with already-published genomic databases on M. tuberculosis, specifically:
a) essential genes for survival in vitro [17], in macrophages

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/196

[22] and in mice [23], and b) dispensable genes as shown
by their deletion in clinical isolates [24] c) genes presenting atypical compositional characteristics suggestive of
HGT [7].

Results
MultiLocus Sequence Analysis-based phylogeny
Analysis of 20 genes across 16 mycobacterial species, Rhodococcus jostii and Nocardia farcinica revealed a total of
12741 polymorphic sites at the protein level. The number
of amino acid differences between mycobacteria strains
ranged from 0 (between Mycobacterium sp. KMS and MCS)
to 4166 (between M. bovis and R. jostii). The numbers of
amino acid differences are tabulated in the Additional file
1 (Figure S3). An un-rooted phylogenetic representation
of these differences, using MEGA 4.1, is shown in Figure
1. This phylogeny presents three groups of organisms: the
out-group bacteria, the rapid-growing mycobacteria and
the slow-growing mycobacteria. Within the latter group,
there were four major lineages: 1) M. avium-intracellulare,
2) M. marinum-ulcerans, 3) M. kansasii, and 4) M. tuberculosis and related members of the M. tuberculosis complex.
Individual trees based on the selected genes also presented a similar phylogenetic portrait of the genus (data
not shown). Notably, the unexpected finding that M.
kansasii was the nearest neighbor to the M. tuberculosis
complex was supported in the majority of single gene phylogenies.
Genes acquired by HGT in M. tuberculosis detected by a
phylogenetic method
We aimed to describe not only the HGTs specific to M.
tuberculosis but also those acquired at each node of separation in the phylogeny (excluding M. leprae). Using the different thresholds for orthology, we obtained lists of M.
tuberculosis proteins where an orthologues is present in 0
to 7 slow growing mycobacteria but absent in all other
genomes. As seen in Figure 1, in conjunction with the
MLSA-based analysis, we have grouped these proteins into
the following lists: List A, genes likely acquired by the
ancestor of all slow growing mycobacteria, List B, genes
likely acquired by the ancestor of the M. marinum-ulcerans/M. kansasii/M. tuberculosis lineage, List C, genes likely
acquired by the ancestor of the M. kansasii/M. tuberculosis
lineage, and List D, genes likely acquired in the M. tuberculosis lineage. To test for the robustness of these List
assignments, we looked for evidence of genes that are discordant with the proposed phylogeny. To test the MLSAbased prediction that M. kansasii is the nearest neighbor
among sequenced strains to M. tuberculosis, we determined how many genes are shared between M. tuberculosis
and M. kansasii, but no other species, as compared to the
number of genes that are shared only between M. tuberculosis and M. marinum. Under a null model, the two comparisons (M. tuberculosis/M. kansasii versus M. tuberculosis/

M. marinum) would have an equal number of orthologues. This hypothesis was rejected by observing that
there were a total of 72 such orthologous pairs; 42 in the
case of M. tuberculosis/M. kansasii compared to 30 in the
case of M. tuberculosis/M. marinum. (p < 0.05 by exact
Binomial method). Therefore, as orthology searches provided independent support for the MLSA-based phylogeny, we proceeded to enumerate acquired genes at
different steps in the evolution of M. tuberculosis (Table 1).
When using different thresholds of orthology ("any hit",
95th percentile, 90th percentile or 85th percentile), we
obtained slight shifts in these numbers, but overall a stable estimate of around 11–14% of the genome was
assigned as potential HGT (versus predicted HGT, based on
more stringent criteria, as described below). Notably,
about one half of these were specific to M. tuberculosis (List
D).
In addition to helping uncover HGT, the mycoHIT program can also be used to detect potential deletion events
during the step-wise genesis of M. tuberculosis. This
approach, along with associated lists, are provided in
Additional file 2. Of note, list Dd comprises 689 genes
potentially deleted from the ancestor of M. tuberculosis
after its separation with M. kansasii. This list is approximately three times longer than the corresponding list D of
potencial HGT. These results emphasize that in parallel
with the acquisition of foreign genes, there has been
reduction of the M. tuberculosis genome associated with
pathogenic specialization, as has been described for other
mycobacterial species [6,12]. Unlike M. marinum and M.
kansasii, M. tuberculosis has not been isolated from the
environment, therefore the process of reductive genomics
was potentially due to lack of selective pressure to retain
genes important for environmental survival.
Sub-classification of potential HGT
To determine genes most likely to represent true-positive
HGT, we analyzed the total list of genes obtained with the
"any hits" threshold to find those that were unlikely to
represent HGT, either because they do not code for a protein or because the encoded protein has multiple orthologues in other genera of Actinobacteria. Figure 2 presents
the number (2A) and the proportion (2B) of genes from
the four lists in each category. The first category represents
genes with no blast results across the NCBI database, sugTable 1: Numbers of genes detected as potential HGTs using

gesting that these genetic sequences do not code for a protein product or instead that the encoded proteins are so
small that they cannot meet the minimal E-value for an
orthologue. This situation applied to 36% of List A proteins, 21% of list B proteins, 9% of list C proteins and
30% of list D proteins. These results were not unexpected.
For instance, the high proportion in list A is explained by
duplication of small proteins (e.g. 56% of proteins in this
category are Esx and PE proteins).
The next category of potentially false-positive HGT genes
was those for which we observed orthologues in at least
two different genera from the Actinobacteria phylum.
Although some of these genes could represent HGT events
within the family or multiple transfers, to be conservative,
we assumed that these may represent ancestral genes that
have been deleted in certain lineages, resulting in a
restricted distribution (e.g. deleted from the rapid-growing mycobacteria lineage and Rhodococcus jostii. but
present in all slow-growing mycobacteria). The proportion of proteins classified in this category represents 31%,
31%, 16% and 16% respectively from lists A, B, C and D.
Of genes most likely to represent HGT, we divided these
between the process of HGT and the accompanying bacterial genes. Genes with homology to transposons, phage
and toxin-antitoxin comprised 13% of proteins from the
list A, 5% of proteins from list B, 43% of proteins from list
C and 34% of proteins from list D. The lower proportion
of HGT vehicles in the earlier lists is consistent with the
expectation that these genes may be eliminated with
greater time due to a lack of selective pressure for their
maintenance.
Finally, the remaining proteins (listed in table 2) on each
of Lists A-D were considered to represent bacterial genes
acquired through the process of HGT. Based on these
Lists, we obtained 28 M. tuberculosis genes that were
acquired by the ancestor of all slow growing bacteria, 40
that were acquired by the ancestor of the M. marinumulcerans/M. kansasii/M. tuberculosis lineage, 14 that were
acquired by the ancestor of the M. kansasii/M. tuberculosis
lineage and finally 55 that were specifically acquired by
the ancestor of the M. tuberculosis complex. Together, this
makes a most conservative estimate that in addition to
vehicles of HGT, 137 genes (28 + 40 + 14 + 55) in M.
tuberculosis were acquired through the process of HGT. As
a note, we also performed a PSIBLAST (Position-Specific
iterated BLAST) on the 55 proteins from ListD (data not
shown). Only two proteins (both regulators) have been
found to have a hit in other Actinobacteria. This argues that
the HGT estimate is not biased by high sequence variability within a vertical transmitted protein.

methods. B) Proportion of proteins, from list A, B, C and D, which present the specified characteristics.

Predicted HGT reveal characteristics other than abnormal
phylogeny
When looking at the location of HGT in the genome, we
observed that bacterial genes acquired horizontally
appeared in clusters, often located in the same region as
an HGT vehicle (see Additional file 1 – Figure S4). 99 of
the 137 genes (72%) were associated with another horizontally acquired gene, with the highest proportion seen
in list D (87%). Of the 137 genes, 82 (60%) were associated with a HGT vehicle, with the highest proportion
again observed with list D (76%). To illustrate compositional signs of HGT (presence of vehicle, clustering or
skewed GC%), we graphically present four examples: the
lipo-ligosaccharide (LOS) locus (Figure 3A), the phenolic
glycolipid (PGL) locus (Figure 3B), the hyc locus (Figure
4) and the Rv3775 locus (Figure 5). These examples were
chosen for their pertinence in the M. tuberculosis virulence
as discussed below.

For the LOS locus, one observes potential vehicles of HGT
(Toxin-Antitoxin genes), two clusters (one a set derived
from List B, the other comprising mostly List A genes) and
altered GC%. For the List A cluster, the GC% was near
65%, which is the average GC% for the M. tuberculosis
genome. In contrast, the cluster of List B genes was associated with a drop in GC%, as low as 53% over a calculated
interval of 3000 bp.
In the PGL locus, we detect transposases and again these
genes are in clusters. List A genes were found at each
extremity, whereas genes acquired more recently (Lists BD) were detected in a more central situation. The GC con-

tent of these gene clusters was associated with their
assigned list; genes from Lists D and B had no GC% skew
whereas genes from lists C and A had decreased GC%.
The third example is the hyc operon (Figure 4). Among
Actinobacteria, the hyc locus is found in three distinct
forms. In Nocardiodes sp. the hyc locus features neither a
transposase nor a split gene (Figure 4A). Rather, one
observes at each side of the hyc locus a duplication of a
part of a conserved gene (Noca_4472), suggestive of insertion by homologous recombination. In M. avium, this
locus is part of a large island, called LSPA6 [25], that is
found in M. avium subsp. hominissuis but not other M.
avium subspecies. This island includes one transposase
and has split radC into two pieces, suggestive of insertion
by transposition (Figure 4B). Finally, there is a hyc locus in
M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. marinum and M. ulcerans
without features of transposition or homologous recombination. Nonetheless, this locus has increased GC content, in contrast to other HGTs in the same region (acpA/
bioF, Rv0059/60, Rv0113/14/15) where GC% is decreased
(Figure 4C). These three variants of the hyc locus suggest
transfer across bacteria and provide mechanistic clues
regarding the mode of acquisition in two of three lineages.
The last example presented in Figure 5 is the Rv3375
locus, which comprises the insertion of two clusters of foreign genes (two genes acquired in list C and three genes
acquired in List D). Again, there are transposase elements
close to the locus and a GC% drop depending on which
list the genes derived from: genes from List C are not asso-

ciated with an evident GC % change, unlike the decrease
seen for List D genes.
A recent study looked for HGT in M. tuberculosis using
altered GC% at the first and third codon positions or the
codon usage as the search criteria [7]. We note that 48%
of genes reported in this paper were also detected in our
study. More interestingly, 30% of the HGT detected in our
study were also detected in this other report, with a higher
proportion among our List D genes (57%). This enrichment of compositional features of HGT in list D (the most
evolutionarily recent) is expected, as characteristics of
HGT tend to homogenize with the rest of the genome and
dispensable HGT (e.g. phage proteins) tend to be deleted
with time [26]. Moreover, these findings highlight the
complementarity of the two approaches. While compositional methods may predict certain HGT that would be
overlooked by phylogenetic methods (e.g. between bacteria of the same phylum), the use of our phylogenetic
approach has permitted detection of instances of HGT
where the genomic signature is unremarkable based on
compositional considerations, such as more ancestral
events.
Role of HGT in the emergence of M. tuberculosis
Upon analysis of the predicted function of the 137 proteins, an evident increase in transferases (e.g. glycosyl-,
formyl-, aminotransferases) was observed (30/137 =
22%). These enzymes transfer a functional group (e.g.
methyl) from one molecule to another. Two regions that
have been particularly affected by acquisition of foreign

transferases are the LOS locus and the PGL locus. Apart
from transferases, the HGT lists also contain genes coding
for proteins involved in metabolic functions related to
adaptation to anaerobic conditions. We detected two such
regions: the hyc (formate hydrogenlyase operon) and the
frd (fumarate reductase operon).
Given the evidence in favor of HGT, we evaluated the
genes so acquired for clues regarding their potential role
in the genesis of M. tuberculosis as a specialized pathogen.
By comparing the 137 genes against available databases,
we assessed for whether these genes were predicted to be
essential for growth in vitro [17], in macrophages [22], or
during experimental in vivo infection using the mouse
model [23]. As indicated in Additional file 1 (Figure S5)
and highlighted in Table 2, we found that 18 genes out of
137 were deemed essential by one of these screens, some
clustered in the same region (e.g. two genes essential in
vivo were in the Rv3375 locus whereas the hyc operon contained two genes essential in vitro and 1 gene essential during macrophage infection). We also compared against
genes deleted in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis [24] as
evidence of their dispensability for full virulence in the
human host. In this case, 21 of the 137 genes (primarily
from list B) have been deleted in at least one clinical isolate. These results suggest that while some genes acquired
by horizontal transfer are necessary for full virulence, others may represent genes that were important at earlier
stages in the evolution of slow-growing mycobacterial
pathogens but are apparently dispensable for the specific
pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.

Example
Example of lineage specific biochemical properties mediated via the acquisition of foreign genes. A) The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) locus is represented from Rv1494 to Rv1520. A graphical representation of the GC content, across a 110
Kb DNA sequence, illustrates the GC% drop of the DNA comprising the indicated clusters of HGT. B) The phenolic glycolipid
(PGL) locus is represented from Rv2949c to Rv2964. Genes colored in black are those detect as HGT. Again, a graphical representation of the GC content, across a 100 Kb DNA sequence, illustrates the GC% drop of the foreign DNA. For visual reasons, some small genes have been labeled with the two last numbers (e.g. Rv2949c has been named 49c). In all case, the genes
colored in black are those detect as HGT (or HGT vehicle), and unless otherwise stated, genes are from list D.

Discussion
Previous genomic study on M. tuberculosis, using sequence
level comparisons and post-genomic analysis, has shown
that this organism has evolved through clonal evolution,
mutation and gene deletion [27,28]. Importantly, these
studies have largely concentrated on within-species variability, and therefore have emphasized devolution once an
organism is already M. tuberculosis. Our study indicates
that ancestors of M. tuberculosis complex organisms
acquired at least 137 coding genes in a step-wise manner

through the process of HGT. More specifically, the emergence of the epidemic pathogen, M. tuberculosis, from an
environmental ancestor has coincided with 'infection' by
phages and/or transposable elements after the common
ancestor with M. kansasii. This scenario is supported by
the clinical and epidemiologic observations that M.
kansasii can cause TB-like pulmonary disease, without evidence of person-to-person spread.

Interestingly, we have detected certain 'hotspots' for HGT,
where one observes genes from different lists, indicative of
distinct HGT events. This may be due to the presence at
these sites of DNA sequences with characteristics (e.g.
transposase insertion sequence, homologous DNA to
phage DNA) that permit independent HGT. Alternatively,
features acquired in a first HGT event may permit secondary insertions due to sequence similarity with DNA of a
potential donor. In two 'hotspots', acquisition of a high
number of transferases is clearly linked to lineage-specific
biochemical properties. Phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) are
synthesized on the backbone phthiocerol dimycocerosate
(DIM), which is common to all mycobacteria, by adding
a phenol ring and methylated sugars (reviewed in [29]).
PGLs are produced exclusively by some slow growing
mycobacteria (e.g. M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. ulcerans and M. leprae) [29]. Our phylogenetic
screen detected Rv2949c, the chorismate-formate lyase
responsible for production of the phenol ring [30], as an
HGT in the ancestor of these bacteria (List B). We also
detected other HGT in this locus, notably Rv2962c and
Rv2958c (List B) and Rv2959c (List C), responsible for the
addition of different sugars to produce the M. tuberculosis
form of PGL [31]. Lastly, the methyltransferase Rv2959c,
implicated in the O-methylation of one of the hydroxyl
groups of the rhamnosyl residue of M. tuberculosis PGL
[32], was also detected as a foreign gene (List C). As PGL
is an important M. tuberculosis virulence factor [33] and
the enzymes responsible for building from DIM to PGL to
the M. tuberculosis form of PGL have been horizontally
acquired, this locus provides a clear illustration of how
HGT has contributed to the step-wise evolution of virulent M. tuberculosis. A similar scenario applies for the LOS
locus. This locus has been implicated in the production of
different variants of these highly polar glycolipids in M.
marinum [34], although the complete locus is not conserved in all M. tuberculosis strains [35]. Again, our phylogenetic analysis uncovered evidence of HGT in the form of
transferases that affect the species-specificities of LOS
products. Moreover, our study has also shown a number
of horizontally acquired transferases outside of these two
loci. As the acquisition of such enzymes can serve to modify ancestral compounds, a future challenge will be to
identify the substrates of these enzymes and determine
the role of the newly synthesized compounds in M. tuberculosis
pathogenicity.
Beyond biochemical modification of mycobacterial virulence factors, genes acquired through HGT have potentially mediated the transition from an environmental
niche to intracellular life within a complex eukaryotic
host. As a first example, two loci are predicted to mediate
adaptation to anaerobic conditions. The hyc operon
shows homology with the formate hydrogenlyase operon
from enterobacteria, implicated in formate fermentation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/196

by transforming formate into CO2 and H2 [36]. Three
genes of this operon were predicted to be essential by
TraSH analysis (2 in vitro and one for macrophage infection), therefore this operon has an important role in M.
tuberculosis metabolism that merits further study. The second locus shows homology with the fumarate reductase
operon, which is required for anaerobic respiration using
fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor [37]. As both of
these operons are up-regulated during oxygen starvation
[38,39], it can be hypothesized that the acquisition of
these genes provided a selective advantage for residence in
anaerobic conditions, as encountered within a granuloma
[40]. A second example is the acquisition of genes Rv3373
to Rv3378c. Two of these genes have been shown to be
essential during infection of mice (Rv3375 and Rv3376)
[23]. Curiously, Rv3377c and Rv3378c encode proteins
implicated in the production of a compound (tuberculosinol) with a undefined function, never documented in
bacteria [41]. These two genes were also identified in a
genetic screen for inhibitors of macrophage phagosome
acidification [42], suggesting a role for this compound in
modulating the intracellular environment.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated step-wise HGT during the genesis
of M. tuberculosis with evidence that this process has mediated the acquisition of established virulence factors. Our
original approach has permitted the detection of 'old'
HGT which may have increased the pathogenic potential
of slow-growing mycobacteria along with M. tuberculosisspecific HGT which may have permitted its adaptation to
the human lung. The examples provided in this manuscript, along with other published examples of HGT
[8,43,44] present opportunities to formally test this, for
example, by analyzing for gain-of-function when genetically engineering insertion events into non-tuberculous
mycobacteria. Additionally, as our model and software
permit the genomic analysis of different bacteria, it will
also be possible to determine the degree to which HGT
has contributed to the step-wise evolution of other mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial pathogens.
