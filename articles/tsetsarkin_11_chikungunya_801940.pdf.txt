Chikungunya virus adaptation to Aedes albopictus
mosquitoes does not correlate with acquisition of
cholesterol dependence or decreased pH
threshold for fusion reaction
Konstantin A Tsetsarkin1*, Charles E McGee2 and Stephen Higgs1

Abstract
Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito transmitted alphavirus that recently caused several large
scale outbreaks/epidemics of arthritic disease in tropics of Africa, Indian Ocean basin and South-East Asia. This reemergence event was facilitated by genetic adaptation (E1-A226V substitution) of CHIKV to a newly significant
mosquito vector for this virus; Aedes albopictus. However, the molecular mechanism explaining the positive effect
of the E1-A226V mutation on CHIKV fitness in this vector remains largely unknown. Previously we demonstrated
that the E1-A226V substitution is also associated with attenuated CHIKV growth in cells depleted by cholesterol.
Methods: In this study, using a panel of CHIKV clones that varies in sensitivity to cholesterol, we investigated the
possible relationship between cholesterol dependence and Ae. albopictus infectivity.
Results: We demonstrated that there is no clear mechanistic correlation between these two phenotypes. We also
showed that the E1-A226V mutation increases the pH dependence of the CHIKV fusion reaction; however,
subsequent genetic analysis failed to support an association between CHIKV dependency on lower pH, and
mosquito infectivity phenotypes.
Conclusion: the E1-A226V mutation probably acts at different steps of the CHIKV life cycle, affecting multiple
functions of the virus.
Keywords: Chikungunya virus, Aedes albopictus, cholesterol, pH threshold of fusion

Introduction
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthritogenic alphavirus, has received global attention due to the series of
recent large-scale outbreaks in different parts of the
world including Africa, Indian Ocean Islands, India and
countries of South-East Asia [1,2]. The virus was also
introduced with viremic travelers into Europe where it
caused, for the first time, autonomously transmitted outbreaks in 2007 [3] and 2010 [4]. The global expansion of
CHIKV was at least partially attributed to the viral adaptation to a new mosquito vector Aedes (Ae.) albopictus,
which facilitated CHIKV transmission in the regions

that lack typical vector Ae. aegypti [5-10]. Phylogenetic
studies have identified a specific mutation (E1-A226V)
in the E1 glycoprotein of CHIKV strains circulating in
the areas where Ae. albopictus serves as primary virus
vector [6,8,9,11-13]. Additionally, laboratory studies confirmed that the E1-A226V substitution leads to
increased CHIKV infectivity and is associated with more
efficient dissemination and transmission by Ae. albopictus [14,15]. We also demonstrated that midgut epithelial
cells of Ae. albopictus appear to be the primary target
cells where this mutation has the most profound effect
[16]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the
positive effect of E1-A226V on CHIKV infectivity for
midgut cells of Ae. albopictus remains largely unknown.
The envelope of CHIKV consists of 240 copies of
membrane-embedded E2-E1 heterodimers, which

surround the nucleocapsid core. Cellular entry is
mediated by the interaction of E2 glycoprotein with an
unidentified receptor, followed by endocytosis of the virion-receptor complex into endosomal compartments.
Acidification of endosomes subsequently triggers a cascade of events that culminates in E1 activation and viral
fusion reaction [17-19]. Since the mutation responsible
for adaptation of CHIKV to Ae. albopictus occurs in the
E1 protein; a receptor-mediated explanation of its effect
on viral fitness in this mosquito seems implausible, suggesting that this mutation acts at steps in the virus life
cycle following receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Previously it has been shown that mutations at the
same position of the E1 protein (E1-226) of other alphaviruses; Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus
(SINV), can modulate the cholesterol requirements for
viral entry into, and exit from, cells [20-23]. Thus, the
single amino acid substitution E1-P226S in SFV and triple substitution at (E1-A226S, E1-K227G, E1-N228M) in
SINV was sufficient to significantly increase virus production in, virus infectivity to, and virus exit from cholesterol-depleted Ae albopictus (C6/36) cells [22,23].
Position E1-226 is located at the tip of the ij loop of the
E1 protein of alphaviruses [24,25] and it was hypothesized that the presence or absence of cholesterol in target membranes is detected by residues in this loop,
which influences the kinetics of E1 conformational
changes during fusion [26]. Interestingly, in a study
using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)enveloped pseudo-typed murine leukemia virus, it was
shown that the entry of VEEV into cells is resistant to
cholesterol depletion of the mammalian cells [27], suggesting that cholesterol dependence is not absolute and
probably depends on particular virus/host species
relationships.
Previously, we demonstrated that the E1-A226V mutation that confers increased fitness of CHIKV in Ae.
albopictus is also associated with CHIKV dependence
for cholesterol for growth in mosquito derived cell lines.
Thus, the viruses that have alanine at E1-226 grew to 45 Log10TCID50/mL higher titers in cholesterol-depleted
C6/36 cells as compared to viruses that have valine at
this position [15]. However, no difference in growth
kinetics between these viruses was detected in standard
C6/36 cells, suggesting that dependence for cholesterol
might be directly connected to the mosquito infectivity
phenotype.
In this study, to investigate possible relationship
between cholesterol dependence of CHIKV and Ae.
albopictus infectivity, we generated a panel of CHIKV
clones that varies in sensitivity to cholesterol and evaluated their relative infectivites for Ae. albopictus
mosquitoes.

Materials and methods
Plasmids and cells

The plasmids encoding full-length infectious clones of
the LR2006 OPY1 strain pCHIKV-LR i.c. (GenBank
accession number EU224268), GFP-expressing full
length clone pLR-GFP-226V (pCHIKV-LR 5’GFP, GenBank accession number EU224269), pLR-ApaI-226V
and pLR-226A have been previously described [15,28].
A series of point mutations at E1-226 (S, T, G, I, P, F,
M, H, L) was introduced into pCHIKV-LR i.c. using
standard molecular biology methods that resulted in
clones designated as pLR-226X, where X corresponds to
one of residues to be introduced. To introduce S, T, G,
I, P, F, M, H, and L residues individually at E1-226 in
the background of eGFP-expressing CHIKV pLR-GFP226V [15], the DNA fragment of 4709 nt. was generated
by digestion of pLR-GFP-226V with AgeI and XhoI. This
fragment was cloned into each of pLR-226X plasmids
by AgeI and XhoI sites. The resultant plasmids were
designated pLR-GFP-226X. Presence of the eGFP gene
in the plasmid was confirmed by restriction digestion
analysis.
A plasmid encoding the pCHIKV-LR i.c. containing
mutations identified in the cholesterol-independent plaque purified clone of LR-ApaI-226V (Clone#1) [see
below; adaptation of LR-ApaI-226V to cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells] was generated by cloning of two
cDNA fragments into pCHIKV-LR 3’GFP [28]. Fragment 1 (1386 nt) was amplified based on RNA isolated
form Clone#1 virus using CHIKV specific primers, and
digested with XhoI and KpnI restrictases. Fragment 2
(961 nt) was generated by digestion of pLR-GFP-226V
with KpnI and PacI. Fragments 1 and 2 were simultaneously ligated and cloned by XhoI and PacI sites into
pCHIKV-LR 3’GFP. The resultant plasmid was named
pLR-Cl#1. To introduce a single point mutation,
C10660A, into pLR-Cl#1, two DNA fragments of 1082
nt. and 1249 nt. were generated by digestion of pLRCl#1 with XhoI and EcoRV and digestion of pLR-GFP226V with EcoRV and PacI restrictases, respectively.
Both DNA fragments were cloned simultaneously into
pCHIKV-LR 3’GFP by XhoI and PacI sites. The eGFP
expressing version of this plasmid was generated using
the same strategy as was described for pLR-GFP-226X
constructs. The resultant clone was designated as pLRGFP-Cl#1-10660A and sequenced.
The presence of correct nucleotide substitutions leading to the desired amino acid mutations at specific position of E1 gene was confirmed by sequencing analysis.
All clones possessed mutations of interest and no additional substitutions were detected. Plasmids were propagated in MC1061 strain of E.coli and purified using the
QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)

following manufacturer’s protocol. Detailed information
for all constructs is available from authors upon request.
BHK-21 (Baby Hamsters Kidney) and Vero (African
green monkey kidney) cells were maintained at 37°C
with 5% CO2. BHK-21 were propagated in MEM alpha
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1× MEM vitamin solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Vero cells were maintained in MEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% BGS and 1×
MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). C6/36 cells (Ae. albopictus) were maintained at 28°C without CO 2 in Leibovitz L-15 (L-15)
medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Rescue of infectious viruses from infectious clones

One microgram of plasmid DNA was linearized with
NotI restrictase and was used as a template for in-vitro
transcription reaction using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Ten micrograms of in-vitro
transcribed RNA were electroporated without further
purification into 107 BHK-21 cells using Gene Pulser
Xcell electroporation system (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and
preset BHK-21 conditions as described previously [29].
Electroporated cells were maintained in 75 cm2 tissue
culture flasks at 37°C in 15 mL of L-15 medium. Cell
culture supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi), and stored at -80°C. Viral titers were
determined by titration of the infectious samples on
Vero cells in 96-well plate using standard techniques
[29]. Titers were expressed as tissue culture infectious
dose 50% endpoint per milliliter of media (Log 10 TCID50/mL) [29].
Specific infectivity of electroporated RNA was determined as previously described [28]. Briefly, 1 × 105 of
electroplated BHK-21 cells were ten-fold diluted and
transferred onto sub-confluent monolayers (1 × 10 6
cells/well) of uninfected Vero cells in six-well plates
[28]. Cells were incubated for 2 h to allow attachment
to the plate, and the media was replaced with 2 mL of
0.5% agarose in MEM supplemented with 3.3% FBS.
Plates were incubated for 48-96 h until visible plaques
developed. The results (specific infectivity values) were
expressed as pfu/1 μg of electroporated RNA [Additional file 1, Table S1 and Table S2].
In vitro growth of CHIKV in standard and cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells

To investigate if the mutations in the E1 protein influenced cholesterol dependence of CHIKV, cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells were generated by five passages in
MEM alpha medium containing 10% FBS treated with
2% CAB-O-Sil (Acros Organics) for 12 h at room temperature as previously described [30]. CAB-O-Sil is a

Page 3 of 12

hydrated colloidal silica that adsorbs lipoproteins/cholesterol and allows removal of cholesterol from biological
solutions. CHIKV growth curves were determined by
infecting cholesterol-depleted and normal C6/36 cells
duplicates in 25 cm2 flasks at multiplicities of infection
(MOI) of 0.1 and 1.0, respectively, by rocking for 1 h at
25°C. The cells were washed three times with medium
and 5 mL of fresh L-15 or MEM alpha medium supplied
with 10% of standard or CAB-O-Sil treated FBS was
added to the flask. Five hundred microliters of medium
was collected from each flask at the indicated times
post-infection, and medium volume was adjusted by
adding 0.5 mL of appropriate medium. Viral titers were
determined by titration of cell culture samples on Vero
cells.
C6/36 cells infectivity assay

Primary infections of cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells
with CHIKV containing specific mutations in the E1 glycoprotein were quantified using an infectious centers
assay. Confluent monolayers of cholesterol-depleted C6/
36 cells in 96 well plates were infected with 10 μL of
serial ten-fold dilutions of eGFP expressing CHIK
viruses, for 1 h at room temperature. The virus dilutions
were made in MEM alpha medium containing 10% FBS
treated with 2% CAB-O-Sil. Following infection, 100 μL
of MEM alpha medium containing 10% cholesteroldepleted FBS and 0.8% of carboxy methyl cellulose
(which prevents spread of viruses beyond the initial
focus of infection) were added to each well. Plates were
incubated for 20 h at 30°C. Experiments were performed
in triplicates, and eGFP expressing foci were counted
and results were normalized to 106 infectious centers/
mL for standard C6/36 cells.
Adaptation of LR-ApaI-226V to cholesterol-depleted C6/
36 cells

LR-ApaI-226V virus was passed four times in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells maintained in L-15 medium.
At first passage, a confluent monolayer of cholesteroldepleted C6/36 in 25 cm 2 tissue culture flask was
infected with LR-ApaI-226V at an MOI of 0.1. At 3
days post infection (dpi), 1 mL of tissue culture supernatant was used to infect new cholesterol-depleted C6/
36 in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks. After the fourth passage in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells, tissue culture
supernatant was harvested at 2 dpi and stored at -80°C
until needed. To obtain the plaque-purified clones,
supernatant of the passage four was titrated by plaque
assay on Vero cells as previously described [31]. At 2
dpi, ten individual plaques below the agarose were
pierced with a 200 μL tip and used for infection of standard C6/36 cells in L-15 medium in one well of a 12
well plate. At 2 dpi culture supernatants were harvested,

Tsetsarkin et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:376
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/376

titrated and stored at -80°C until needed. The 950011000 nt. genome region of the plaque-purified clones
was sequenced.
Virus competition assay in cells treated with NH4Cl

BHK-21 or C6/36 cells in 12 well plates were maintained in L-15 medium supplied with 10% FBS. Thirty
minutes prior to infection, cell culture media was
replaced with 0.5 mL of the L-15 media containing various amounts of NH4Cl (endosomal acidification inhibitor) as indicated (see results). After a 30 min incubation
at room temperature, 50 μL of a 1:1 mixture of LRApaI-226V and LR-226A virus (107pfu/mL) was added
to each well and infection was allowed to continue for 1
h at room temperature. Cells were washed once with 0.8
mL of L-15 media containing NH 4 Cl, then 0.8 mL of
fresh L-15 medium containing various amounts of
NH4Cl was added to each well and cells were incubated
for 48 h at 37°C for BHK-21 or 28°C for C6/36 cells.
Cell culture supernatants were harvested and used for
RNA extraction, or titration on Vero cells. Virus RNA
was processed as discussed previously [15].
Cell-cell fusion assay

For comparative studies of the pH threshold of the
CHIKV fusion reaction, confluent monolayers of C6/36
cells in 24-well plate were infected (MOI of 0.5-1.0)
with eGFP expressing CHIKV containing specific mutations in the E1 glycoprotein. Cells were incubated for 24
h in 0.5 mL of L-15 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS to allow cell surface expression of viral glycoproteins. Cells were washed once with 0.5 mL of L-15 and
the cell-to-cell fusion reaction was triggered by incubating the cell monolayers for 2 min at 30°C in 1 mL of
pre-warmed (30°C) L-15 medium whose pH was previously adjusted to desired values. Fusion reactions were
stopped by replacement of the fusion medium with 0.5
mL of standard L-15 medium (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated for 3 h at 28°C to allow polykaryons to develop.
Cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and stained
with 1 μg/mL of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
to visualize nuclei. Cells were analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy and the fusion index (percent of fusion) was
calculated as (1-c/n)x100%, where c is the number of
eGFP expressing cells, n is the number of nuclei (n≥70).
Experiments were performed in duplicates for each
virus.
Oral infection of mosquitoes

Ae. albopictus (Galveston strain) were infected in an
Arthropod Containment Level 3 (ACL-3) insectary as
described previously [32,33]. To estimate the Oral infectious dose 50% (OID50) values, serial ten-fold dilutions
of BHK-21 derived viruses were made in L-15 medium

Page 4 of 12

followed by mixing equal volume of virus samples with
defibrinated sheep blood (Colorado Serum Company,
Denver, CO). Blood meals were presented to 4-5 day
old female Ae. albopictus (100 mosquitoes per virus
dilution) using Hemotek feeding apparatus (Discovery
Workshops, Accrington, Lancashire, United Kingdom)
as described previously [15]. Fully engorged mosquitoes
were sorted on ice and placed in carton boxes for maintenance at 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod at 28°C and
80% humidity, with a 10% sucrose solution provided ad
libitum. Midguts were dissected at 7 dpi and virusinduced eGFP expression in midgut epithelium was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CHIKV infection of
mosquitoes was detected by observation of CHIKVexpressed eGFP in epithelial cells. The oral infectious
dose 50% (OID50) values and fiducial limits were calculated using PriProbit (version 1.63) and SAS equivalent
method assuming normal function distribution and an
“all or nothing” response parameter. For stability assays,
3-4 mosquitoes infected with the highest dilution of the
selected viruses were triturated in 1 mL of TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 7 dpi, and total
mosquito and viral RNA was extracted according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Viral cDNA was amplified,
and the region of interest was directly sequenced using
an ABI PRISM model 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Results
To better understand the amino acid requirements at
position E1-226 for increased CHIKV midgut infectivity
of Ae. albopictus, and to understand how it might correlate with cholesterol dependence of CHIKV, a number
of CHIKV containing a single amino acid substitutions
at E1-226 were constructed and tested in cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells and in Ae. albopictus. Initially,
mutations encoding S, T, G, and I residues at E1-226
were introduced into the backbone of non-eGFP expressing pCHIKV-LR i.c. Specific infectivity values were
comparable for all of the constructs, indicating that
introduction of these residues at E1-226 is not lethal for
CHIKV replication in BHK-21 cells (Additional file 1,
Table S1). Growth kinetics of LR-226S, LR-226T, LR226G and LR-226I were determined in standard and
cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells, and compared with
growth of LR-ApaI-226V and LR-226A viruses, which
have been tested previously [15]. All viruses grew very
efficiently in standard C6/36 cells (Figure 1A), however,
in cholesterol-depleted cells only LR-226S demonstrated
growth kinetics comparable with LR-226A. The growth
of all other viruses was significantly attenuated, the peak
titers being 3-4 Log10TCID50/mL lower at 24, 48, and
72 hpi as compared with LR-226A and LR-226S (Figure
1B). To further investigate the effects of S, T, G and I

residues at E1-226 on the CHIKV requirement for cholesterol, the mutations encoding these amino acids were
introduced into the backbone of eGFP-expressing i.c. of
CHIKV (Additional file 1, Table S2), and then specific
infectivity of these viruses were determined in standard
and cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells (Figure 2). Relative
infectivity of LR-GFP-226A and LR-GFP-226S for cholesterol-depleted C6/36 was 2-2.5 Log10 IC/mL higher
than the infectivity of CHIKV with V, G, or I residues.
This is in agreement with the growth kinetics of these
viruses in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells, indicating
that cell infectivity of E1-226V, E1-226G and E1-226I
containing virus is much more dependent on the presence of cholesterol than infectivity of E1-226A and E1226S viruses. Interestingly, the cell infectivity of LRGFP-226T virus was significantly lower (p < 0.01 Student’s t-test) than LR-GFP-226A and LR-GFP-226S
viruses, but was significantly higher than that of LRGFP-226V, LR-GFP-226G and LR-GFP-226I viruses,
indicating CHIKV dependence for cholesterol can be

2).
To investigate the relationship between CHIKV
dependence for cholesterol and CHIKV infectivity for
midgut cells of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, serial dilutions of LR-GFP-226S, LR-GFP-226T, LR-GFP-226G
and LR-GFP-226I viruses were orally presented to Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes. CHIKV infectivity was analyzed
by the expression of eGFP in the midgut cells at 7 dpi
(Table 1). OID50 values of LR-GFP-226S, LR-GFP-226T
and LR-GFP-226G in Ae. albopictus were between 5.35
and 5.94 Log10TCID50/mL, which were not significantly
different from the OID50 value of LR-GFP-226A virus
(5.45 Log10TCID50/mL). This indicates that cholesterol
dependence of CHIKV does not directly correlate with
an increase in midgut infectivity. LR-GFP-226T and LRGFP-226G both were significantly more cholesteroldependent as compared to LR-GFP-226A and LR-GFP226S; however, all four viruses demonstrated almost
identical infectivity for Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Infectivity of LR-GFP-226I was almost identical to infectivity
of epidemic CHIKV containing the E1-226V residue (p
< 0.1). Both valine (V) and isoleucine (I) have additional
methyl and ethylene groups in their side chains as compared to alanine or glycine, which are probably required
for an increase in CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of
Ae. albopictus. The presence of a hydroxyl group in the
side chains of serine and threonine apparently has a
negative effect on CHIKV infectivity to Ae. albopictus.
To further investigate the amino acid requirement at
position E1-226 for increased CHIKV midgut infectivity
and cholesterol dependence, mutations encoding P, F,
M, H and L at E1-226 were introduced into pCHIKVLR i.c. All constructs had comparable specific infectivity
values of in vitro transcribed RNAs and produced moderate to high virus titers in BHK-21 cells (Additional file
1, Table 1), indicating that these residues are not lethal
for CHIKV, at least in BHK-21 cells. However,

constructs with F, M and H residues developed plaques
only at 72 hpe in Vero cells, and LR-226L developed
plaques at 96 hpe, indicating an attenuated phenotype.
Growth kinetics of all these viruses (except LR-226L)
were comparable in standard C6/36 cells (Figure 3A).
However, growth of these viruses was significantly inhibited at 24, 48 and 72 hpi in cholesterol-depleted cells as
compared to LR-226A or LR226S viruses (Figure 3B) (p
< 0.05). Specific infectivity of eGFP-expressing viruses
encoding P, F, M, or H at the position E1-226 in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells were significantly lower as
compared to the infectivity of LR-GFP-226A; however,

infectivity of LR-GFP-226P and LR-GFP-226F were significantly higher than that of LR-GFP-226V virus, which
agrees with the growth kinetics results (Figure 4). The
OID50 of LR-GFP-226F for Ae. albopictus was similar to
the OID50 value of LR-GFP-226A (p > 0.1), indicating
that E1-226F does not lead to increased CHIKV infectivity (Table 1). Since LR-GFP-226F was found to be much
more cholesterol-dependent as compared to LR-GFP226A, this experiment further supported the earlier
observation that dependence for cholesterol does not
correlate with increased Ae. albopictus midgut infectivity. The OID50 values of LR-GFP-226M and LR-GFP226L were indistinguishable as compared with the LRGFP-226V and LR-GFP-226I viruses (Table 1), suggesting that V, I, M and L all share similar structural properties important for CHIKV infectivity for Ae.
albopictus. Interestingly, LR-GFP-226P and LR-GFP226H demonstrated an intermediate infectivity phenotype, which was statistically different from highly infectious viruses such as LR-GFP-226 [V or I] (p < 0.05)
and/or low infectivity viruses such as LR-GFP-226 [A or
S] (p < 0.05).
The stability of LR-GFP-226 [I, F, M, H, L] was also
analyzed (Additional file 1, Table S3). All mosquitoes
infected with CHIKV containing either I, F, M or H
residues were found to replicate RNA encoding the I, F,
M, and H amino acids at E1-226, respectively, indicating
that these viruses remain stable after mosquito infection.
Two of four mosquitoes infected with virus derived
from the pLR-GFP-226L construct contained RNA
encoding only the E1-226L residue. However, sequence
results from the remaining two mosquitoes indicated
that two RNA species (encoding E1-226L and E1-226P)
were simultaneously present in these mosquitoes. These
data indicate that LR-GFP-226L is unstable and evolves
quickly to eliminate the attenuating E1-226L residue
(Additional file 1, Table S3).

Mutations in other CHIKV genome regions that control
cholesterol dependence of CHIKV

The mutagenesis analysis of the position E1-226 in
CHIKV showed that all of the residues that confer an
increased infectivity phenotype in Ae. albopictus (V, I,
M and L) also associated with increased dependence for
cholesterol in the target membrane. To investigate if
increased CHIKV dependence for cholesterol is absolutely required for increased infectivity in Ae. albopictus,
the LR-ApaI-226V virus, with the E1-226V residue conferring high cholesterol dependence was used to select
mutations that can control cholesterol dependence of
CHIKV. LR-ApaI-226V was passed four times in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells. After the first passage, the
virus titer was 5.52 Log10TCID50/mL at 3 dpi, but at 2
dpi of passage four, the titer was 7.95 Log10TCID50/mL,
indicating successful adaptation to cholesterol-depleted
cells. The passage four virus (P4) was plaque purified on
Vero cells and 10 individual clones were selected at 2
dpi. Clones were propagated once in C6/36 cells, and

the 9500-11000 nt. genome region was sequenced
(Additional file 1, Table S4). Seven of 10 sequenced
cloned viruses contained the E1-V226A mutation. The
second most common variant (3 of 10) contained three
nucleotide substitutions (10189 G®T; 10201 G®A;
10660 A®C); encoding two novel mutations (E1-A66S
and E1-D70N). In two clones (#1 and #5) these three
changes were the only found mutations, but in clone #7,
these mutations were accompanied by an E1-V226A
substitution. The least common variant (1 out of 10)
contained two nucleotide substitutions (10659 G®T
and 10970 G®A) leading to two amino acid changes
(E1-Q222H and E1-G326D) was excluded form further
analysis.
The mutations [10189 G®T(E1-A66S); 10201 G®A
(E1-D70N); 10660 A®C (E1-R223R)] from Clone#1
virus were introduced into the pCHIKV-LR i.c. and
resultant virus (LR-Cl#1) was tested in standard and
cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells (Figure 5A, B). Growth
kinetics of the i.c.-derived virus LR-Cl#1 in cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells was indistinguishable from cholesterol-adapted virus (Clone#1), and only slightly attenuated as compared to cholesterol-independent virus LR226A (Figure 5), thereby confirming the role of [E1A66S and E1-D70N] substitutions in modulating cholesterol dependence of CHIKV. One of these mutations
[10660 A®C (E1-R223R)] does not lead to an amino
acid substitution; however, it is located in close proximity to position E1-226. This mutation was present in
all three individual clones (#1, #5 and #7), suggesting
that it might be important for modulating cholesterol
dependence of CHIKV (Additional file 1, Table S4). To
test this possibility, the point mutation (10660 C®A)
from the pLR-ApaI-226V was introduced into pLR-Cl#1,
and resultant virus (pLR-Cl#1-10660A) was analyzed in
standard and cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells (Figure 5).
This virus replicated as efficiently as LR-Cl#1 or
Clone#1 viruses in cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells

indicating that the silent mutation 10660A®C is not
implicated in cholesterol sensitivity of CHIKV.
The eGFP-expressing version of LR-Cl#1-10660A (LRGFP-Cl#1-10660A) was constructed and specific infectivity of resultant virus was determined in standard and
cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells (Additional file 1, Figure S1). The LR-Cl#1-10660A virus was able to infect
cholesterol-depleted C6/36 cells significantly more efficiently (p < 0.01 Student’s t test) as compared to LRGFP-226V virus, which genetically corresponds to LRApaI-226V virus, used for the adaptation experiment.
To evaluate if the roles of the mutations [E1-A66S and
E1-D70N] from Clone #1 virus in modulating cholesterol dependence of CHIKV were correlated with the
role of these mutations in CHIKV infectivity to Ae.
albopictus midguts, the OID50 value of LR-GFP-Cl#110660A was determined as described above (Table 1).
The infectivity of LR-GFP-Cl#1-10660A virus was
almost identical to that of LR-GFP-226V (p > 0.1), indicating that [E1-A66S and E1-D70N] mutations do not
affect mosquito infectivity of CHIKV. These data also
indicate that cholesterol dependence of CHIKV does not
directly correlate with increased mosquito infectivity.
E1-A226V mutation is responsible for decrease in pH
threshold for fusion reaction

The pH dependence of the fusion reaction can be analyzed by monitoring the role of agents that act to raise
the pH of the endosome in inhibition of viral entry into
the cells [34]. The lysotropic agent ammonium chloride
(NH 4Cl) has been used previously to demonstrate the
effect of mutations in both SFV and SINV on their
fusion thresholds [35,36]. The LR-ApaI-226V and LR226A viruses were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and used to
infect C6/36 or BHK-21 cells pretreated with different
concentrations of NH4Cl. At 48 hpi cell culture supernatants were collected and either titrated on Vero cells
or used for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR and
ApaI restrictase digestion to determine the relative RNA
ratio of competing viruses. LR-ApaI-226V was markedly
more sensitive to inhibition with NH4Cl than was LR226A virus. Thus in C6/36 cells in the presence of 3, 6,
and 9 mM of NH 4Cl, the majority of CHIKV RNA in
the supernatant was derived from LR-226A virus (Figure
6A). Similarly, in BHK-21 cells, LR-226A virus outcompeted LR-ApaI-226V at NH4Cl concentrations of 9 and
12 mM (Figure 6B). These data suggest that CHIKV
with the E1-A226V mutation requires a low pH to trigger the fusion reaction. To confirm these findings, pHdependence of the cell-cell fusion was compared for LRGFP-226A and LR-GFP-226V viruses. In two independent experiments the LR-GFP-226V virus triggered cellcell fusion reaction at ~0.2 lower pH as compared to
LR-GFP-226A virus (Figure 7).

Figure 6 Effect of NH4Cl on competition between LR-ApaI-226V
and LR-226A viruses for growth in C6/36 (A) and BHK-21 cells
(B). Thirty minutes prior to infection cells were pre-incubated with
L-15 media containing various amounts of NH4Cl. Then cells were
infected with 1:1 mixture of LR-ApaI-226V and LR-226A viruses
(107pfu/mL) and incubated for 48 h in L-15 media containing
various amounts of NH4Cl. Cell culture supernatants were harvested
and used for RNA extraction or titration on Vero cells. Virus RNA
was processed as discussed previously [15].

To investigate if CHIKV mosquito infectivity phenotypes correlated with different thresholds for their
fusion reactions, cell-cell fusion assays were conducted
for eGFP-expressing viruses with S, T, G, I, P, F, M
and H residues at E1-226 (Figure 8A). No apparent
correlation was found between these two parameters.

medium whose pH was previously adjusted to desired values. The
reaction was abrogated by replacement of the fusion medium with
0.5 mL of standard L-15 medium. Percent of fusion was calculated
as (1-c/n)x100%, where c is a number of eGFP expressing cells, n is
number of nuclei (n≥70). Two independent experiments were
performed for each virus (i and ii). Each individual experiment was
performed in duplicates and results are expressed as an average of
duplicates.

Figure 8 Effect of mutations at E1-226 (A) and [E1-66/E1-70] (B) on pH dependence of CHIKV induced cell-cell fusion. C6/36 cells were
infected with eGFP expressing viruses and processed as described in legend for Figure 7. Experiments were performed in duplicates for each
virus, and results are expressed as an average of duplicates.

Thus, mosquito infectivity of LR-GFP-226F virus was
found to be similar to the infectivity of LR-GFP-226A
virus (Table 1), however, LR-GFP-226F virus triggered
the cell-cell fusion reaction at a pH even lower than
the pH of fusion of the highly infectious virus LRGFP-226V (pH~5.6 vs pH~5.8 respectively). Interestingly, mosquito infectivity of LR-GFP-Cl#1-10660A
virus was identical to that of LR-GFP-226V (Table 1),
however, LR-GFP-Cl#1-10660A triggered fusion reaction in C6/36 cells at pH markedly higher than LRGFP-226V (Figure 8B).

Discussion
The detailed mutagenesis analysis of position E1-226
demonstrated that CHIKV can tolerate a significant
variability of amino acids at position E1-226. Depending
on specific residues, CHIKV exhibited various phenotypes in cell culture conditions. These phenotypes may
be broadly categorized as follows (Additional file 1,
Table S1, S2): 1) - viruses that have S, T, G, P were
almost indistinguishable from parental (wild-type) virus
containing V or A; 2) - introduction of I, F, M or H
residues resulted in viruses that were slightly attenuated;
3) - introduction of L residues resulted in significant
attenuation of CHIKV. Analysis of viruses with specific
mutations at E1-226 in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes
revealed that effects of these mutations can also be classified into three groups as follows: 1) - amino acids I, M
and L resulted in viruses that were highly infectious to
midgut cells of Ae. albopictus. The OID 50 values of
these viruses were not significantly different from
CHIKV with E1-226V; 2). Viruses with amino acids S,
T, G or F at E1-226 were associated with a low infectivity phenotype for Ae. albopictus. The OID50 values of
these viruses were statistically indistinguishable from the
ancestral form of CHIKV with E1-226A residue. 3) - an
intermediate infectivity phenotype was attributed to P
and H residues. OID 50 values of these viruses were

statistically higher than that of highly infectious viruses
(V, I, M and L), but in the same time lower than that of
low infectivity viruses (Table 1).
To investigate the effect of mutations at E1-226 on the
CHIKV requirement for cholesterol, growth kinetics and
specific infectivity were compared for CHIKV with different mutations at E1-226 in cholesterol-depleted C6/
36 cells. The pre-epidemic CHIKV (E1-226A) infected
and replicated much more efficiently in cholesteroldepleted C6/36 cells as compared to the mutated
CHIKV (V, I, M, or L at E1-226) with a high infectivity
phenotype in Ae. albopictus (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4). This
observation suggests that CHIKV dependence for cholesterol might be associated with infectivity to Ae. albopictus. Interestingly, a recent study showed that the E1
protein of alphaviruses can directly bind to cholesterol,
which influences fusogenic properties of the viruses
[37]. This suggests that direct E1 binding to cholesterol
can be responsible for an increase in CHIKV infectivity
for Ae. albopictus. However, analysis of viruses that
showed intermediate and decreased infectivity to Ae.
albopictus does not support the conclusion that CHIKV
dependence for cholesterol is mechanistically correlated
with infectivity to Ae. albopictus. These viruses demonstrated a broad spectrum of cholesterol dependence
phenotypes that do not correlate with mosquito infectivity profile. The simplest explanation for the lack of correlation is that dependence for cholesterol and
infectivity to Ae. albopictus are two independent phenotypic effects of the E1-226 mutations. Alternatively,
dependence for cholesterol might be controlled at several steps of the infectious process. Cholesterol-independent viruses (such as LR-226A and LR-226S) do not rely
on cholesterol at each of these steps. However, cholesterol-dependent viruses (such as LR-226V and LR-226G)
may require cholesterol at different (not overlapping)
steps, and the CHIKV-cholesterol interaction at steps
which are connected to Ae. albopictus infectivity are

Tsetsarkin et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:376
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/376

unnecessary for viruses that showed decreased infectivity
for Ae. albopictus.
All of the residues at E1-226 that are associated with
high infectivity for Ae. albopictus also demonstrated
high dependence to cholesterol. To address the question
if cholesterol dependence is absolutely required for high
mosquito infectivity, we identified mutations in the
CHIKV genome regions other than E1-226, which can
make CHIKV less cholesterol-dependent (Figure 5,
Additional file 1, Table S4). Introduction of E1-A66S
and E1-D70N mutations into the i.c. of CHIKV with
valine at E1-226 significantly releases cholesterol dependence of CHIKV; however, these mutations had no
effect on CHIKV infectivity to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. These data indicate that cholesterol dependence
can be modulated independently of the phenotypes of
infectivity to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Altogether,
these observations and previously discussed data on the
roles of individual mutations at E1-226 indicate that
cholesterol dependence of CHIKV cannot serve as an
indicator of infectious properties of CHIKV in Ae.
albopictus.
Interestingly, all substitutions that control cholesterol
dependence of CHIKV occurred in an E1 region that
has never previously been implicated in modulating cholesterol dependence of alphaviruses. Previously it was
shown that besides the position E1-226, the mutations
in the “hinge” region of the E1 protein (positions: E1-44
and E1-178) could also control cholesterol dependence
of SFV. In addition, E1-44 and E1-178 mutations control
SFV dependency for sphingolipids, and it was proposed
that these mutations in the hinge region control relative
flexibility of domain I and domain II of E1, which are
believed to be important for the biological function of
the molecule [38]. The effector mechanism of mutations
from Clone#1 (E1-A66S and E1-D70N) and Clone#10
[(Q222H) data not shown] on CHIKV cholesterol
dependence are unknown. The mutations E1-A66S and
E1-D70N are located in the bc loop of domain II which
is involved in interactions with Domain I of the adjacent
E1 protein and E2 protein [17,25]. Therefore, it is possible that these mutations generally affect the stability of
the CHIKV particle. The Q222H is located in the middle of the ij loop of E1 and probably acts by controlling
the flexibility and the topology of the tip of this loop,
which interacts with the fusion loop and target
membrane.
The common feature shared by residues at E1-226
that ensure a high infectivity phenotype of CHIKV in
Ae. albopictus (V, I, L and M) is that they belong to
class of non-polar aliphatic amino acids. Interestingly,
all residues that do not fall into this category (A, S, T,
G, F, P, H) were associated with significantly lower
infectivity to Ae. albopictus. It appears that a general

Page 10 of 12

requirement for an increase in infectivity for Ae. albopictus is associated with the presence of at least two or
more aliphatic carbon atoms connected to the b-carbon
of alanine. The current model of the alphavirus membrane fusion process postulates that upon exposure to
low pH and E2-E1 heterodimer dissociation, the fusion
loop and/or adjacent ij loop (with position E1-226) act
as “sensor of lipid composition” of target membranes,
and then regulate the stable insertion of the fusion loop
into membrane of endosomes [26,39,40]. Therefore, the
aliphatic groups of V, I, M and L residues at the position E1-226 of ij loop could be directly involved in modulation of this “lipid sensor” step via direct interaction
with target membrane or by changing conformation of
the fusion loop, which is located in close proximity to
the ij loop. However, we also cannot exclude the possibility that mutations at the tip of the ij loop (E1-226)
act independently of the fusion loop by changing overall
conformation of E1 protein during this “lipid sensing”
step.
Competition experiments between LR-ApaI-226V and
LR-226A in the presence of inhibitor of endosomal acidification (NH 4 Cl), and cell-cell fusion experiments
demonstrated that the E1-A226V mutation is also
responsible for a decrease in the pH required for triggering of a fusion reaction (Figure 6, 7). The observed
difference in pH dependence between LR-GFP-226V
and LR-GFP-226A viruses was relatively small (~0.2);
however, it is possible that it can have significant impact
on the location of where the fusion reaction occurs
within endosomal compartments. Thus, lower pH suggests that fusion of E1-226V viruses would occur not in
early endosomes (pH 6.5-6.0), but rather in late endosomes (pH < 6.0), which have quite different lipid composition [41-44]. Interestingly, residues E1-226I, and E1226M that were found to significantly increase CHIKV
infectivity to Ae. albopictus, also led to a decrease in the
pH of fusion reaction. However, the further analyses of
the effects of different mutations at E1-226 on pH of
fusion reaction failed to support the association between
pH-dependence of the fusion reaction and CHIKV phenotypes in Ae. albopictus (Figure 8). This indicates that
a decrease in the pH of fusion reaction due to E1A226V mutation is probably not directly responsible for
the observed increase in CHIKV infectivity to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.
There was also no clear correlation between pH and
cholesterol dependence of CHIKV. Thus, although it
seems that viruses that have lower cholesterol dependence for cell entry have a tendency to trigger fusion at
higher pH, there are two exceptions that do not fit this
relationship. The E1-226F mutation was responsible for
intermediate dependency for cholesterol, but required
very low pH to trigger fusion. However, CHIKV with

Tsetsarkin et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:376
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/376

E1-226G was highly cholesterol-dependent, but triggered
fusion at markedly higher pH than the other highly cholesterol-dependent virus. Interestingly, the E1-P226S
mutation in SFV which is also responsible for modulation of cholesterol dependence, has no effect on SFV pH
dependence for cell entry [39].
It remains perplexing why wild-type isolates of some
alphaviruses such a SFV and SINV are highly dependent
on the presence of cholesterol in membranes of host
cell [21,23], whereas others such as CHIKV [15] and
VEEV [27] can resist cholesterol depletion? It is particularly surprising considering the fact that biological transmission of alphaviruses occurs in mosquito vectors that
do not have enzymatic pathway to synthesize cholesterol
and obtain required sterols directly from the diet
[45,46]. Our data shows that dependence for cholesterol
is not directly associated with mosquito infectivity or
pH dependence phenotypes. Moreover, it was shown
that a cholesterol-independent mutation E1-P226S in
SFV confers more efficient viral replication in intrathoracicaly injected Ae. albopictus compared to highly cholesterol-dependent wild type SFV [47], however,
selection of this mutation by SFV strains in nature has
never been documented. Since mutations that control
cholesterol dependence also control many other unrelated functions of the alphaviruses, we hypothesize that
cholesterol dependence/independence is not associated
with any specific evolutionary force that determines
alphavirus evolution in nature, and is acquired/lost by
particular viruses as a result of viral adaptation to other
conditions/functions associated with specific host specie
used by viruses in given ecological settings.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that mutation E1-A226V
is associated with multiple effects on CHIKV physiology,
such as cholesterol and pH dependency and mosquito
infectivity. The detailed analyses of CHIKV with different mutations at E1-226 and other genome regions
revealed that there is no clear correlation between these
parameters. This indicates that the E1-A226V mutation
probably acts at different steps of CHIKV life cycle
affecting multiple functions of the virus.
