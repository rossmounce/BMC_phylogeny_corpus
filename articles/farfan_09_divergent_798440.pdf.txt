Abstract
Background: The bacterial flagellum is the most important organelle of motility in bacteria and
plays a key role in many bacterial lifestyles, including virulence. The flagellum also provides a
paradigm of how hierarchical gene regulation, intricate protein-protein interactions and controlled
protein secretion can result in the assembly of a complex multi-protein structure tightly
orchestrated in time and space. As if to stress its importance, plants and animals produce receptors
specifically dedicated to the recognition of flagella. Aside from motility, the flagellum also
moonlights as an adhesion and has been adapted by humans as a tool for peptide display. Flagellar
sequence variation constitutes a marker with widespread potential uses for studies of population
genetics and phylogeny of bacterial species.
Results: We sequenced the complete flagellin gene (flaA) in 18 different species and subspecies of
Aeromonas. Sequences ranged in size from 870 (A. allosaccharophila) to 921 nucleotides (A. popoffii).
The multiple alignment displayed 924 sites, 66 of which presented alignment gaps. The phylogenetic
tree revealed the existence of two groups of species exhibiting different FlaA flagellins (FlaA1 and
FlaA2). Maximum likelihood models of codon substitution were used to analyze flaA sequences.
Likelihood ratio tests suggested a low variation in selective pressure among lineages, with an ω ratio
of less than 1 indicating the presence of purifying selection in almost all cases. Only one site under
potential diversifying selection was identified (isoleucine in position 179). However, 17 amino acid
positions were inferred as sites that are likely to be under positive selection using the branch-site
model. Ancestral reconstruction revealed that these 17 amino acids were among the amino acid
changes detected in the ancestral sequence.
Conclusion: The models applied to our set of sequences allowed us to determine the possible
evolutionary pathway followed by the flaA gene in Aeromonas, suggesting that this gene have
probably been evolving independently in the two groups of Aeromonas species since the divergence
of a distant common ancestor after one or several episodes of positive selection.

Background
The genus Aeromonas belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria includes a group of 21 Gram- negative bacterial species
that can be isolated worldwide from a variety of environments. Although it is clear that members of this genus are
primarily aquatic organisms, they can colonize other habitats and cause infections in invertebrates and vertebrates
[1]. Recently, in their report of March 2006, the Office of
Water of the Environmental Protection Agency of the USA
(EPA) included some species of Aeromonas into a group of
potential waterborne pathogens. Aeromonads are efficient colonizers of surfaces and are an important constituent of bacterial biofilms in both water distribution
systems and food processing environments. Their polar
flagellum contributes to biofilm formation and host colonization, as in the case of other bacterial genera such as
Campylobacter and Pseudomonas [2]. Additionally, in recent
studies the role of the polar flagellum of Aeromonas in
enterocyte adherence has been found to be similar to
those of other seafood pathogens such as Vibrio [3].
The bacterial flagellum is the most important organelle of
motility in bacteria and plays a key role in many bacterial
lifestyles, including virulence [4]. The flagellum also provides a paradigm of how hierarchical gene regulation,
intricate protein-protein interactions and controlled protein secretion can result in the assembly of a complex
multi-protein structure tightly orchestrated in time and
space [5]. As if to stress its importance, plants and animals
produce receptors specifically dedicated to the recognition
of flagella [6,7]. Aside from motility, the flagellum also
moonlights as an adhesion structure [3] and has been
adapted by humans as a tool for peptide display [8].
Looking at the bacterial flagellum, instead of a simple
model, there is an extensive variation in form and function. The most studied bacterial flagellar system is that of
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which exploits
two different flagellins but never in the same filament,
while in other cases, up to six different flagellins are incorporated into a single filament [9]. Flagellar filaments vary
in their physical properties: some are rigid, others flexible,
some are straight, others curly, some undergo post-transcriptional modifications such as glycosilation or methylation, others do not.
A comparison of the flagellins amino acid sequences (fliC,
flaA and flaB) from many bacterial species has revealed a
distinctive domain structure of the protein. The N- and Cterminal parts of the molecule, which are responsible for
the secretion and polymerization, are conserved among
species, whereas the central region, which produces the
surface exposed antigenic part of the flagellar filament, is
highly variable both within and among species. The N-terminal region comprises two domains, ND0 and ND1,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/23

with a highly conserved region between them, the spoke
region (12 residues). The C-terminal region includes two
domains, CD0 and CD1, with the corresponding counterpart to the spoke region, CS, between them [10]. The central variable region is less constrained, and includes
sequences of variable length. Recent studies have shown
that the N- and C-terminal conserved regions are recognized by the innate immune systems of mammals and
plants [6]. In Aeromonas, two flagellin genes have been
reported, flaA and flaB, which are present even in species
described as non motile [11].
Natural selection has clearly rendered flagellar systems
non-functional when they are no longer needed. Vestigial
non-functional remnants of flagellar genes or regulons
have been discovered in several bacterial species [12,13].
At least one degenerate flagellar system from Brucella
melitensis still has a cryptic role in infection, even though
it is no longer capable of mediating motility [14]. More
recently, flagellar-related genes have been detected in the
genome of Myxococcus xanthus, a soil bacteria that uses
gliding rather than flagellar motility [5]. In addition,
when examining homologies between flagellar and other
bacterial proteins, it becomes clear that flagellar subunits
share a common ancestry with components from other
biological systems [15].
In this work we have determined the complete sequence
of the flaA gene in 18 Aeromonas strains, including motile
and non motile strains. Direct sequencing of the flaA gene
has revealed the existence of two distinct FlaA flagellins
(FlaA1 and FlaA2) that separate two groups of species
(Group 1 and Group 2). The aim of the present study is to
verify the role of the selective pressure acting on the flaA
gene.
A comparison of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) substitution rates in protein
coding genes provides an important means for understanding molecular evolution. The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio, ω (dN/dS), measures selective pressure
at protein level. If nonsynonymous mutations are fixed at
a lower rate than synonymous mutations, the ω ratio
would be < 1 (purifying selection), while if both synonymous and nonsynonymous are fixed at the same rate, ω
should be equal to 1 (neutrality). Finally, if nonsynonymous are higher than synonymous rates, ω should be >1
(positive selection).
To perform this study, we applied a maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis based on models developed by Yang [16] to
the 18 flaA gene sequence data. Researchers have begun to
substitute the traditional null hypothesis testing approach
for that of model selection, in which several competing
hypotheses are simultaneously contrasted with the data.

Models can be ranked and weighted, providing a quantitative measure of relative support for the competing
hypothesis and in cases where models have similar levels
of support from the data, model averaging can be used to
make robust parameter estimates and predictions. This
analysis is a valuable alternative especially when more
than one hypothesis is plausible. Likelihood models
developed by Yang [16] account for variable ω ratios
among branches in the tree and can be used to test adaptative evolution along lineages. These models also allow
the ω ratio to vary among amino acid sites and to identify
critical amino acids under diversifying selection. In this
work, we have applied the maximum likelihood models
to our set of sequences in order to clarify the evolutionary
pathway followed by the flaA gene in Aeromonas.

Sobria), with a mean of 77.4% ± 0.5.
The average transition/transversion ratio was 1.0, two
times the value expected with a random substitution distribution. The G + C content varied from 49.2% (A. jandaei) to 58.3% (A. bivalvium). The average nucleotide
frequencies were 20.6%, 29.3%, 24.9% and 25.2% for T,
C, A and G, respectively.
Figure 1 depicts the saturation plot of flaA sequences using
maximum likelihood distances. This graph strikingly
shows a strong saturation of both transitional and transversional substitutions for sequence divergence values of
up to 1.0, indicating the occurrence of multiple substitutions and possible homoplasy.

Results
Analysis of flaA gene
We have sequenced a total of 18 flaA genes corresponding
to the full-length flagellin of different species of Aeromonas
(Table 1). The results of the BLASTN search in the GenBank database verified that all sequences obtained were of
the Aeromonas flagellin gene and showed high homology
with the flaA gene. Sequences ranged in size from 870 (A.
allosaccharophila) to 921 nucleotides (A. popoffii). The multiple alignment displayed 924 sites, 66 of which presented
alignment gaps. Complete deletion of the sites with alignment gaps as well as the terminal stop codons resulted in
an alignment of 855 nucleotides with 442 invariable sites
(51.7%) and 413 variable sites (48.3%), 371 of which
were parsimony informative. The identity of pairwise
comparisons of the 18 sequences ranged from 69.2% (A.

The number of amino acid substitutions of pairwise comparisons was plotted against the number of transition and
transversion substitutions (Fig. 2). The graph demonstrates a strong saturation of both transitions and transversions in flaA sequences.
The mean number of transversions for pairwise comparisons between sequences pertaining to Group 1 and 2 was
128.27 ± 0.62 whereas the values for intragroups were:
60.06 ± 10.01 for Group 1 and 58.89 ± 9.81 for Group 2.
In the case of transitions the intergroup value obtained
was 108.53 ± 1.17, and in the case of the intragroup comparisons, the values obtained were 75.08 ± 3.13 and 92.89
± 2.47 for Group 1 and 2, respectively.

homoplasy as well as for the transition/transversion ratio
and the different proportion of nucleotide base frequencies.

N93 [22] and GTR [23,24]. In all cases models were modified by considering a proportion of invariant sites
(option I) and/or assuming a gamma distribution of substitution rates among sites (option G). The General Time
Reversible model (GTR) with a proportion of invariant
sites of 0.432 and a gamma shape parameter α = 1.117
(GTR + I+ G) obtained the best Log likelihood scores.
Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and Akaike Information
Criterion [25] both favoured the GTR + I + G model. The
Akaike weight of this model, which can be interpreted as
a probability, was 0.971 corroborating that the GTR + I +
G is the most accurate model for the analysis of the
observed data. This model implemented in the PHYML
program was later used for inferring the phylogenetic tree
of the 18 species and subspecies studied. However, identical or very similar topologies were obtained with other
substitution models and clustering methods.
The tree shown in Figure 3 revealed two major clusters
among the 18 Aeromonas flaA sequences. Group 1 includes
the following strains: A. bestiarum, A. culicicola, A.
hydrophila subsp. dhakensis, A. hydrophila subsp. hydrophila,
A. hydrophila subsp. ranae, A. jandaei, A. salmonicida subsp.
pectinolytica, A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and A. veronii bv. Sobria, and Group 2 contains A. allosacharophila, A.
bivalvium, A. caviae, A. encheleia, A. eucrenophila, A.
hydrophila subsp. anaerogenes, A. molluscorum, A. popoffii
and A. sobria.
The mean intergroup number of pairwise nucleotide differences, 236.8 ± 1.4, was significantly higher than the
mean intragroup pairwise differences: 135.1 ± 5.9 (Group
1) and 151 ± 4.1 (Group 2), (t test, P < 10-15). The differences between Group 1 and 2 were significant only at a
level of 95% (t test, P = 0.03).
The amino acid alignment showed the existence of two
different FlaA proteins among the Aeromonas species:
FlaA1, which is present in Aeromonas species included in
Group 1, and FlaA2, the flagellin exhibited by the species
of Aeromonas belonging to Group 2. The comparative
sequence analysis of these groups revealed the existence of
amino acid residues fixed in different positions along the
conserved regions of the protein, which varied between
FlaA1 and FlaA2 flagellins. There were 14 of these residues
in the N-terminal region (positions 18, 21, 74, 87, 105,
107, 114, 116, 121, 124, 126, 127, 133 and 142), 9 of
which were in the ND1b domain (positions 105, 107,
114, 116, 121, 124, 126, 127 and 133), and 6 in the C-terminal region (positions 197, 198, 200, 205, 255 and
267). Only one of these fixed amino acid residues correspond to the central variable region (position 181). Furthermore, in the central region, all the sequences from
species belonging to Group 1 exhibited a deletion of two
amino acids (positions 164 and 165), which are not
found in those of Group 2.

In order to clarify the role of selective pressures that operates in nucleotide diversity and sequence divergence of
flaA in Aeromonas we performed a maximum likelihood
analysis of flaA sequence data using the models developed
by Nielsen and Yang [26] and Yang et al. [27], extending
the model of codon substitution of Goldman and Yang
[28] as implemented in the PAML4 package.

Pairwise comparisons of maximum likelihood estimates

Variability of the ω ratio among codon sites
In order to verify the nature of the selective pressure acting
on our alignment we used different codon-substitution
models developed by Nielsen and Yang [26] and Yang et
al. [27]. Standard codon models were fitted to the data set
as implemented in the codeml program from the PAML
package. Random-site models M0, M1a, M2a, M3, M7,
M8 and M8a were fitted to our data; these models assume
variation in ω among sites but not among lineages. The
models used, parameter estimates, log-likelihood and AIC
values of these models are shown in Table 2. Table 3
shows the results of the LRT tests for these models.

As shown in Figure 4A, the 153 pairwise comparisons fell
in two discrete and strikingly delimitated clusters with dN
ranging from 0.002 to 0.082 (Cluster I) and 0.161 to
0.197 (Cluster II). Cluster I represents the 36 intragroup
pairwise comparisons corresponding to the species of
Group 1 (Cluster I.1) and the 36 pairwise comparisons
between species of Group 2 (Cluster I.2). Cluster II
includes the 81 pairwise intergroup comparisons.
In Figure 4B, ω was plotted against sequence divergence
(t), defined as the number of nucleotide substitutions per
codon and was approximately 3.07 × (0.247 dS + 0.753
dN), where 0.247 and 0.753 are the proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, respectively. In the case
of pairs corresponding to Cluster II, there was a clear
inverse relationship between ω and t, with a highly significant statistical correlation (r = -0.9032, P < 10-15). The
correlation between ω and t for Cluster I.2 was also significant (r = -0.4507, P = 0.0058). However, in the case of
Cluster I.1 the correlation between ω and t was not statistically significant (r = -0.1153, P = 0.5030).

was thus lower than 1 in all the pairwise comparisons
(range: 0.008 – 0.141) with a mean of 0.076 and a standard error of 0.003. We estimated by ML the dS and dN values with ω fixed to 1 and used a likelihood ratio test (LRT)
to test the hypothesis that < 1, using ω = 1 as the null
hypothesis. All pairwise comparisons showed P values <

likelihood estimates of nonsynonymous (dN) against synonymous (dS) substitution rates (Fig. 4A), the straight line represents the neutral expectation (dN = dS). The ω ratio (dN/dS)
plotted against the maximum likelihood estimates of
sequence divergence (t), defined as the expected number of
nucleotide substitutions per codon (Fig. 4B).

We applied the simplest of site-based models, M0 [30],
which assumes an uniform ω ratio for all codons, to the
data. The log likelihood for our sequences was ᐍ = 6830.350, with an estimate of ω = 0.062, which can be
interpreted as an average over all sites in the protein and
all lineages in the tree. The low ω value obtained suggests
a strong action of purifying selection in the evolution of
flaA in the Aeromonas species studied.

models allow the nearly neutral model to be rejected
(Table 3). However, in the case of the M2a model, the proportion of sites with ω > 1 (p2 = 0) was null. Hence, no site
was positively selected at a level of 95% and only an isoleucine in position 179 was identified as being under positive selection at a level of 75% (Table 2). These results
also suggest the absence of positive selection among sites
in flaA sequences.

ratios (ω0, ω1, ω2) fits the data much better than M0 (ᐍ =
-6601.883); the value of the statistic test was 2Δᐍ =
456.93, compared with the χ2 distribution with df = 4,
showing strong evidence against the null hypothesis (M0)
in favour of the alternative (M3). However, the parameter
estimates of the M3 model also suggest that all codons are
under purifying selection with all sites with an ω < 0.6
(Table 2).
The most stringent test we carried out compared the M7
model, which assumes a beta distribution of ω over sites,
with the M8, which adds an extra site class with a free ω
ratio estimated from the data, allowing ω values greater
than one (Table 2). Both models fitted the data better
than M0 with values of ᐍ = -6603.940 and -6600.818,
respectively (Table 2). At a significance level of 95% we
can reject the null hypothesis (M7 model) and accept the
M8 model (Table 3), assuming the existence of ω values
higher than 1, but at a level of 99% we should reject this
hypothesis. In addition, the AIC value for the M8 model
was only slightly lower (13209.635) than the value for the
M7 model (13211.879).
Even accepting M8 as the model that best fits our data, the
parameter estimates showed that 99.6% of sites are under
purifying selection and only one site (0.4%), the isoleu-

cine in position 179, has an ω > 1 at a level of 95% (Table
2). Under this model, the ω average over the 285 codons
was 0.073 with a variance of 0.024. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the posterior means of the ω ratio. The estimated distribution β (0.160, 1.976) has an extreme L
shape, with an ω in the majority of sites close to 0. Assuming this model of ω distribution among sites, the ω mean
would be 0.075 with a variance of 0.022, suggesting an
extremely low probability that a site has an ω > 1. Estimates of the transition/transversion rate (κ) among the
different models were very similar, with values ranging
from 2.082 (M8 model) to 2.192 (M1a and M2a models)
and a mean of 2.117 ± 0.02. These results confirm that
purifying selection is the predominant force acting in the
evolution of the flaA gene.
Variability of the ω ratio among lineages
In order to identify those branches in the tree constructed
from the flaA sequences with an ω ratio > 1 we applied the
free-ratio models. The one ratio model (M0) assumes the
same ω ratio for all lineages and when applied to our data
involves a total of 44 parameters: branch lengths in the
tree (33), nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions (9), κ, and ω [31].

As shown in Table 2 the log-likelihood under this model
was -6830.350, with ω = 0.062 as an average over all sites
and lineages. We applied the free-ratio model, which
assumes an independent ω ratio for each branch of the
tree, to the same data set [31]. Estimates of the ω ratios are
detailed in Figure 3. Considering the 33 branches of the

tree, this model includes 32 additional parameters. The
log-likelihood was ᐍ1 = -6768.362. We performed an LRT
using the M0 model as the null hypothesis. Comparison
of 2Δᐍ = 2(ᐍ1 - ᐍ0) = 123.98 with the χ232 distribution suggests the rejection of the one-ratio model (P = 0.9 × 10-12).
Although ω ratios varies among lineages (Fig. 3), the values of ω ratios corresponding to the different branches
were significantly lower than one (t test, P = 2.2 × 10-16).
The range was from 0.0001 to 0.3307 with a mean of
0.0845 and a standard error of 0.0156.
Fixed-site models
The ω ratios inferred under the model M8 were scattered
along the codon sites, with the highest values clustering in
the region between codon 105 and 205 (Fig. 5). We
applied the fixed-site models to our data in order to determine if the different sites along the sequences were under
different selective constraints. We partitioned codon sites
into three sections, 1: N-terminal (104 codons), 2: the
central region (101 codons) and 3: the C-terminal (80
codons). The correspondence of these sections with the
three regions of the flagellin is depicted in Figure 5.

The results obtained with the fixed site models are shown
in Table 4. The statistics for the LRTs obtained by pairwise
comparisons of these models are shown in Table 5. The
simple model (model A) corresponds to random-site
model M0, and assumes no site ω heterogeneity. The
results suggest a strong action of purifying selection (ω =
0.062) along all the sites. Model E, which assumes different substitution rates (rs), transition/transversion ratio
(κ), and a dN/dS ratio (ω), as well as different codon frequencies (πs), fitted the data significantly better than any
of the simplest models (ᐍ = -6580.030), and its Akaike
weight was 0.999. However, parameter estimates were
very similar under the different models (Table 4). It is
noteworthy that the comparison between models D and C
(2Δᐍ = 0.23) leads to rejection of the model D, suggesting
that the differences of κ between partitions were not significant. In order to test whether the ω ratio differed
between partitions, we applied model D2, which was the
same as model D except for fixing κ = 2.286. When comparing model D2 with model B (Table 5), the null hypothesis had to be rejected, indicating that although the ω ratio
varies among partitions, it is lower than one (Table 4).
Despite the heterogeneity of the substitution rates and dN/
dS ratio in the flaA sequences, the results again confirm the
hypothesis that purifying selection is the predominant
force in the evolution of this gene.
Branch-site models
It is known that if a gene evolves under purifying selection
most of the time but is occasionally subject to episodes of
adaptive change, a comparison between two distant
related sequences is unlikely to yield a dN/dS ratio signifi-

cantly greater than one [32]. This could be the case of flaA
sequences belonging to Group 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Yang and
Nielsen [33] implemented two models, A and B, which let
the ω ratio vary both among sites and lineages. These
models attempt to detect positive selection that affects
only a few sites along a few lineages. Later modifications
of these models [34,35] suggest that a likelihood ratio test,
comparing the modified model A (still called branch-site
model A) with the same model but with an ω ratio fixed
to 1, appears to be a robust test for identification of positive selection sites. We applied this test to our data, labelling the branch that separates Group 1 from Group 2 as
the foreground (Fig. 3). The results of this test are shown
in Table 6.
The LRT comparing the branch-site model with the null
hypothesis model with ω = 1 gave a 2Δᐍ = 14.20, and P =
0.0002, a significant value that indicated the existence of
positive selection in this branch. We examined the Bayes
Empirical Bayes (BEB) posterior probabilities to infer the
sites that are likely to be under positive selection. The
results of this test (Table 6) showed that 17 sites were

identified as positively selected (P > 95%). We also
applied an ML reconstruction of ancestral sequences using
the codon model of Goldman and Yang [28] and Yang et
al. [36]. It is noteworthy that all the 17 sites identified as
positively selected among the amino acid changes are in
the ancestral sequence revealed by the analysis (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The flagellin gene is a widely applicable and useful genetic
marker for studying variation within species of closely
related bacteria [37]. Selander et al. have reported that the
high level of variability and rapid evolution of flagellins
provide a unique opportunity to test phylogenetic
hypotheses [38]. In this work we studied 18 sequences of
the flaA gene which codifies for the flagellar filament protein FlaA, obtained from different species and subspecies
of Aeromonas.
The flaA gene presented a high degree of variability. When
comparing the average identity of the sequences analyzed
(77.44% ± 0.50), it was significantly lower than that
determined for the 16S rRNA in the same group of strains

(98.89% ± 0.04, P < 10-86) with sequences obtained from
the databases. This value was even lower than that of the
housekeeping gene malate deshydrogenase (mdh)
(90.89% ± 0.25, P > 10-64), calculated from sequences
obtained in our laboratory with the same strains (data not
shown).
The dN/dS mean value of our sequences (0.076 ± 0.003)
was similar to that determined by Jordan et al. [39] for
3106 orthologs (including essential and nonessential
genes) in E. coli (0.081). However, it was much lower than
that reported by Mamirova et al. [40] (0.462) for 22 Gammaproteobacteria. The dN/dS mean value obtained for the
flaA sequences strongly suggests a predominant action of
purifying selection. Nevertheless, if we focused our attention exclusively on the dS values, both the mean (1.494 ±
0.047) and the range (0.074–3.529) were notably high.
These data agree with the saturation plot (Fig. 1), in which
both transitions and transversions show a clear saturation
for divergence values higher than 1.0.
The plot of amino acid substitutions against transitions
and transversions (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrated a strong
saturation in the flaA sequences when pairwise comparisons between the two groups (Group 1 and 2), were considered. Pearson's product moment correlation (r)
between the number of transitions and the number of
amino acid substitutions was 0.004 (F test, P = 0.972),
which reveals the null influence of this type of mutations
on the diversification of the two proteins. It is known that
due to the structure of the genetic code, transversions produce more nonsynonymous changes and a higher proportion of radical amino acid changes, which involve an
alteration of a certain physicochemical property [41].
Nevertheless, the correlation between the number of transitions and amino acid substitutions in pairwise comparisons between the flaA sequences corresponding to Group
1 and 2, although significant at a 95% level, was very low
(r = 0.224; F test, P = 0.044), explaining only 5% of the
variation. However, this correlation is significant when
considering pairwise comparisons between the sequences.
The product moment correlation values for transitions

and transversions in Group 1 were r = 0.792 (F test, P < 108) and r = 0.800 (F test, P < 10-8), respectively, and in
Group 2 were r = 0.602(F test, P = 0.0001) and r = 0.761
(F test, P < 10-7), respectively.
Most of the models applied to the flaA sequences determined that nearly all the sites are under purifying selection with only one site, the isoleucine in position 179,
having an ω > 1 at a level of 95% (Tables 2, 4 and 6). This
is not surprising since this amino acid is located in the
central region of the flagellin, a surface exposed domain
that is free to vary far more widely. Indeed, in other bacterial species the central region is considered to be under
neutral or positive selection pressure [38]. Nevertheless,
the branch-site model suggests episodes of positive selection in the separation of the two flagellins in Aeromonas
species. The branch-site models attempt to detect positive
selection that affects only a few sites along a few lineages
[34,35]. In the case of branch-site model A, all the sites
positively selected are included in those identified as
ancestral (Fig. 3, Table 6). Seven of the 17 sites identified
as positively selected correspond to fixed amino acids that
are identical for all the species included in a group but different between groups. The remaining sites correspond to
positions with fixed amino acids in one group but not in
the other. In addition, twelve of the positively selected 17
sites are radical amino acid substitutions. In conclusion,
all the positions identified as positively selected contributed to the diversification of the two flagellins detected in
Aeromonas, FlaA1 and FlaA2.
These results can be explained considering the possible
existence of two flaA genes (flaA1 and flaA2) among the
Aeromonas species studied. These genes would have been
diverging over a long period of time accumulating all the
possible substitutions leading to amino acid changes
allowed by the functional constraints of the flagellins. The
results obtained with the codon models that account for
selection on different codon sites or within specific lineages (Tables 2 and 4) suggested that both transitions and
transversions would be submitted to a strong purifying
selection.

In the analysis described in this paper, alignment gaps in
the variable region of the flagellin were removed. It is
known that in many bacterial species, the central region of
the genes that codify the flagellin (flaA, flaB, fliC) is polymorphic and highly diverse with numerous gaps [10]. In
order to determine the effect of alignment gaps, we also
analyzed our sequences with the 66 alignment gaps
included and treated them as ambiguity data [42,43]. The
sequences then contained 307 codons (921 nucleotides).
When comparing the sequences, with and without gaps
using the one ratio estimate model, the values obtained
were very similar, 0.078 and 0.062, respectively (Table 2).
In addition, both values were clearly lower than one.
When we determined the parameter estimates using the
M8 model (beta & ω > 1) the values obtained (p0 = 0.982,
p1 = 0.018, p = 0.160, q = 1.670) were similar to those
shown in Table 2. The only site identified as being under
positive selection was again the isoleucine, now in position 182 because of the gaps included in the analysis. We
also carried out the analysis of the sequences using the
branch-site model A (Table 4) to corroborate if the presence of alignment gaps influenced the detection and identification of sites under positive selection. The results
confirm that the sites identified as being under positive
selection were identical to those previously identified
when we conducted the analysis excluding the gaps.
These results demonstrated that although alignment gaps
in the sequence analyses have a certain impact on the estimates of model parameters; they do not seem to influence
the identification of sites under positive selection. However, insertions and deletions can play an important role
in the divergence of both flagellins (e.g. the indel of two
amino acids that appears in all the species of Group 1,
positions 164 and 165).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the maximum likelihood models applied
to our set of sequences allowed us to determine the possible evolutionary pathway followed by the flaA gene in
Aeromonas. The results indicated that this gene has probably been evolving independently in the two groups of
Aeromonas since the divergence of a distant common
ancestor after one or several episodes of positive selection
in the branch that separates these groups. The saturation
of nonsynonymous changes determined in the flaA
sequences revealed that the flagellins that define those
groups of species have accumulated all the amino acid
changes allowed by the restriction structural constraints of
the protein.

Methods
Bacterial strains and DNA isolation
A total of 18 Aeromonas strains were analyzed including
type and reference strains of the genera (Table 1). All
strains were grown aerobically on Tryptone soy agar (TSA)

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/23

at 30°C. Isolates were stored in TSB containing 20% glycerol at -40°C. Genomic DNA was extracted with the
REALPURE® Genomic DNA extraction kit (REAL
RBMEG03, Durviz, Spain), and stored at 20°C until use.
Primer design
Specific primers were designed from published polar flagella operons of some Aeromonas species [2,11,44] and the
complete genome sequence of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida A449 (GenBank accession number CP000644). For
PCR amplications, three sets of primers were designed to
amplify the complete flaA gene and its flanking regions
(yadS and flaB genes). The sense primers fla1 (5'-GCTGATGTAAACAATCTGCT-3') and fla5 (5'-GCTTAGGAGAATGGTTATG-3') are located at 437 nt and 16 nt,
respectively, upstream of the translational start site of the
flaA gene. The antisense primers fla2 (5'-GCGTTCAGTGATGAAGTATT-3') and fla2A (5'-CACCCCNTTGTTCCATCT-3') are located at 1541 nt and 977 nt, respectively,
downstream of the initiator codon. A set of internal primers was used for sequencing PCR products: fla1A-2 (sense,
5'-ATCAACAGCGCNAANGA-3'), fla12 (sense, 5'TCCAACCGTCTGACCTC-3'), fla10 (sense, 5'-GCCATGGATGAAGTGAC-3'), fla11 (sense, 5'-CANGTNGGNGCNGANGC-3')
and
fla7
(antisense,
5'CGGTTNTGNACCGCACC-3'), which were located at base
positions 112, 151, 241, 439 and 722, respectively, downstream of the translational start. Primer3 software was
used to design PCR and sequencing primers http://
primer3.sourceforge.net. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Isogen Life Science (Maarssen, The Netherlands).
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing
PCR reactions were carried out in a 50 μl volume, containing 0.5–10 μl of genomic DNA as template, 1× PCR buffer
I (10× PCR buffer I: 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.3]), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 10
pmol each primer and 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were
performed in an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler
using the following program: initial denaturation at 94°C
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 45 s, annealing at 45–50°C for 1 min and elongation
at 72°C for 1.30 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis, and
amplicons were purified with a MSB® Spin PCRapace kit
(Invitek) or from agarose gel with a QIAquick® Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified PCR products were directly
sequenced on both strands using either the PCR primers
or internal primers. Sequencing reactions were performed
with an ABI PRISM® BigDye® Terminator v3·1 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on an
ABI PRISM 3700 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by
the Genomics Unit of the Scientific and Technical Services
of the University of Barcelona (SCT-UB).

Data analyses
The nucleotide sequences obtained were examined for
open reading frames (ORFs) with the ORF finder program
and were also compared to the GenBank database using a
BLASTN analysis, both available at the NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Sequence data were translated,
aligned using ClustalX [45] according to the system
default parameters, and back translated to obtain the
nucleotide alignments. The multiple alignment contained
66 sites with alignment gaps. These sites and the termination codons were removed, giving sequences of 855 bp
length for all strains (285 codons). All subsequent analyses were performed on this set of aligned DNA sequences.

The PHYML package [46] was used for tree reconstructions in combination with the most likely model of nucleotide substitution identified by two hierarchical tests, the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) [25,47]. Model selection and tree statistics
were done using the APE package [48] and R language
[49]. The DnaSP software [50] was used to obtain the
DNA polymorphism data. The identity of the sequences,
the number of transitions and transversions and the
amino acid substitutions were calculated by using the
MEGA 4 program [51].
The synonymous substitutions rate (synonymous substitutions per synonymous site dS), nonsynonymous substitutions rate (nonsynonymous substitutions per
nonsynonymous site, dN) and dN/dS ratio (ω) were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori (NG) method [29] and the
codon-based model of Goldman and Yang [28] as implemented in the codeml program of the PAML 4 package
[16]. The latter is a maximum likelihood (ML) method
based on an explicit model of codon substitution, which
accounts for the transition/transversion rate (κ), ω, and
the base frequencies at the three codon positions.
Standard codon models were fitted to the data set with the
PAML software, and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used
to determine the relative fit of the hierarchically nested
models. Likelihood ratio test statistic 2Δᐍ = 2(ᐍ1 - ᐍ0),
where ᐍ1 represents the log-likelihood of the model corresponding to the alternative hypothesis and ᐍ0 is the loglikelihood corresponding to the model used as null
hypothesis, were compared with a chi-squared distribution in which the difference between the number of
parameters of both models gives the degrees of freedom
(χ2df) [30].
Models tested included those that account for selection in
different codon sites, within specific lineages, or a combination of selection in different sites within specific lineages. Parameters and other details involved in these
models are explicit in the Results section. For all models

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/23

the equilibrium codon frequencies were estimated from
the products of the average observed nucleotide frequencies in the three codon positions (option F3 × 4 in the
PAML package). To verify convergence all PAML analyses
were run at least three times from distinct starting values
of parameters and seed used.
Other statistical analyses and graphics were done in the R
language and Microsoft Excel. Unless otherwise indicated,
uncertainty is expressed as the standard error.

This paper reports the isolation and analysis of flagellin
gene sequences from a diverse collection of 18 Aeromonas
species and subspecies. Genes were isolated by PCR and
the resulting products were sequenced directly. By this
method, each species yielded a single flagellin gene
sequence. The authors use detailed molecular evolutionary analyses to assess the pattern and strength of selection
on these genes.

The phylogenetic analysis showed two distinct groupings
of these genes that the authors term FlaA1 and FlaA2. Even
though it is well-known that Aeromonas species generally
contain two tandemly-linked flagellin genes (FlaA and
FlaB), the authors seem to have missed the most logical

Page 12 of 16

Biology Direct 2009, 4:23

interpretation that their so-called FlaA1 and FlaA2 are
actually FlaA and FlaB (respectively, or vice versa). Unfortunately, the authors seemed to have missed this obvious
conclusion, made even stronger by the fact that the underlying Aeromonas species phylogeny (as recently published
by Saavedra et al., 2006, IJSEM 56: 2481) is not at all congruent with the authors' flagellin gene phylogeny shown
in their Figure 3.
Author's response:
Regarding the main objection you pointed out in your
revision, the misinterpretation of the two flagellin genes,
we are aware that the flagellin operon of Aeromonas is
composed of the flaA and flaB genes as cited in the manuscript (background: paragraph 4).
Concerning the phylogeny of Aeromonas published by
Saavedra et al., the incongruences are not surprising
because the work of these authors is based on the partial
sequences of two housekeeping genes (gyrB and rpoD)
that are supposed to be selectively neutral, while we have
analyzed sequences from a gene that codifies an external
protein that is subjected to high selective pressure. Despite
the above, our intention was not to construct a phylogeny
of Aeromonas based on the sequences of flaA gene.
Reviewer comments:
This appears to be a classic case of not discerning between
paralogs and orthologs in a phylogenetic analysis caused
by the arbitrary selection of one paralog or the other from
a given genome. It is clear that the two groups of flagellar
genes (which I interpret to be FlaA and FlaB) are paralogs
that diverged early in Aeromonas evolution. The fact that
each Aeromonas species gave only one sequence (either
FlaA1 or FlaA2, according to the authors' naming) could
be simply due to the direct sequencing of amplicons. Presumably, any mixed amplicons would yield poor
sequence, since paralogs within species are ~80 identical;
but if clones from those presumed-mixed amplicons were
prepared and sequenced, then two distinct versions would
be predicted.
The serious issue in not distinguishing between paralogous flagellin genes (i.e., FlaA and FlaB) undermines the
entire analysis of this paper and its interpretation. In my
view this fundamental flaw renders the paper unacceptable for publication in Biology Direct at this time. However, the details of the selection analyses of the sequences
per se appear to be sound, even if the evolutionary context
necessary for appropriate interpretation is indeed incorrect. Thus, with a careful re-framing of the analysis in a
manner that determines and then clarifies the appropriate
evolutionary history of these genes in Aeromonas, the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/23

paper would likely be appropriate for publication in Biology Direct.
Author's response:
The presence of two flagellin genes located genetically in
tandem in Aeromonas has been taken into account when
we designed the primers used for the PCR amplification
and direct sequencing of the full length sequences of the
flaA gene (methods section). The PCR primers used were
designed from the two genes flanking flaA in Aeromonas,
yadS (forward) and flaB (reverse). With these primers we
obtained a sequence that includes the full length flaA gene
plus a region upstream that contains part of yadS and
another downstream that includes part of the flaB gene. As
a consequence it is not possible to mistake the amplified
region and we are sure in all cases we amplified flaA.
In addition, we conducted a BLASTN analysis with the
sequences obtained from our strains and in all cases without exceptions, the sequences showed a high homology
with other Aeromonas flaA sequences available in the GenBank as we explained in the manuscript (results: paragraph 1).
Finally, in order to confirm that our sequences correspond
to the flaA gene we constructed a new maximum likelihood tree (additional file 1), in which we have incorporated four flaB Aeromonas sequences from the GenBank
database. As you can see, flaB sequences clustered in a second major branch in both groups (Group 1 and Group 2),
showing that probably they could also be two alleles of
flaB genes in Aeromonas as we observed in the case of flaA,
or even two different flagellin operons.

Reviewer comments
The present article provides an analysis of the flagellin
gene flaA in the opportunistic pathogen species complex
of Aeromonas. As flagella is exposed it has been shown to
be under diversifying selection in several species, it appear
to be a good candidate to study traces of positive selection
with PAML. Yet in the present study most signal are compatible with stabilizing selection rather than diversifying
selection.

I think to be more relevant, the analysis should be coupled with a phylogenetic analysis of a gene subject to less
selective pressure such as mdh that the author mention
they have sequenced too. This will for instance give more

Page 13 of 16

Biology Direct 2009, 4:23

power to the analysis of the diversification of flaA in two
groups. Are the species showing the same pattern or is it
specific to flaA gene? If the diversification is specific this
will comfort the idea that positive selection has been at
work.
Author's response:
As the referee suggest, we have included an additional file
(additional file 2), which shows the phylogenies inferred
from mdh and flaA gene sequences from different Aeromonas species and subspecies. The trees depict distinct phylogenies, mdh being much more in accordance with other
housekeeping gene phylogenies for Aeromonas, and confirming that the two groups of strains obtained in the flaA
tree were a consequence of the divergence of the two alleles of flaA, suggesting an early episode of positive selection
in their origin.
Reviewer comments
However one possible explanation is also that a duplication occurred and that a single copy get conserved or
sequenced in each subgroup. Could this be simply
rejected?

Author's response:
Following the Occham's razor principle, the simplest and
most probable hypothesis is that in prokaryotes, after a
duplication, both copies of the gene are conserved, usually in tandem or, less frequently, in a distant region of the
chromosome. Concerning the sequencing of a single copy
in each subgroup, this fact should be rejected, considering
that, as we mentioned above in the answer to Dr Logsdon,
the PCR primers used were designed from the two genes
flanking flaA in Aeromonas, yadS (forward) and flaB
(reverse). With these primers we obtained a sequence that
includes the full length flaA gene plus a region upstream
that contains part of yadS and another downstream that
includes part of the flaB gene. As a consequence it is not
possible to mistake the amplified region and we are sure
in all cases we amplified flaA.
Reviewer comments
The strong saturation observed could limit the usage of
the PAML like software, it could be appropriate to split the
dataset in the two groups to see if any more signal would
emerge. Also along those lines, the estimation of omega
along the sequence as shown in the figure 5 reveals a very
contrasted pattern between 0–120, 120–210, and 210 till
the end of the protein. Analyzing those regions separately
could also give increased power. Indeed branch site models should in theory do the job of separating branches and
sites but as they compare to other sites and branches, hav-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/23

ing large heterogeneity might affect the power to detect
selection.
Author's response:
Firstly, we are not sure about the possibility of splitting
the dataset in two groups because of the low number of
sequences in each of them (nine). Anyway, we have conducted the PAML analysis considering these two groups as
you suggest, and the results obtained are not conclusive.
Estimation of omega along different parts of the sequence
protein shows that although the central region is less constrained (with omega values 0.0787) than the other two
regions N- and C-terminal (with omega values 0.032 and
0.021, respectively), all these values are clearly lower than
one, and do not modify the results.
Reviewer comments:
I do not understand the information brought by the assertion «site under positive selection were found in the
ancestral sequence», also in the conclusion the idea that
all possible amino acid have been visited appear incompatible with dN/dS less than one and strong purifying selection. If no strong positive selection is observed in the
recent diversification of the flaA gene could the biological
implication be discussed as Aeromonas are mainly opportunistic pathogens.
Author's response:
We mean that the 17 sites identified as positively selected
(P > 95%), when we applied the branch-site model A to
our sequences (Table 6), were all of them are in the reconstructed ancestral sequence from which Group 1 and 2
diverged. Moreover, as that possibly happened a long
time ago and since then both groups of sequences have
evolved under purifying selection, the rate ratio of dN/dS is
less than one.
