Unraveling the mysteries of dog evolution
Rodney L Honeycutt

Abstract
The increased battery of molecular markers, derived from comparative genomics, is aiding our understanding of
the genetics of domestication. The recent BMC Biology article pertaining to the evolution of small size in dogs is an
example of how such methods can be used to study the origin and diversification of the domestic dog. We are
still challenged, however, to appreciate the genetic mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic diversity seen in
‘our best friend’.
Background
Size and shape are the hallmarks of the mammalian
radiations and these two features are emblematic of the
remarkable diversity of families, orders and genera of
mammals that vary widely in form, yet share a common
ancestry. The ordinal-level diversity of mammals is especially noteworthy, reflecting conformational changes in
the skull, dentition and postcranial skeleton that result
in forms as divergent as bats and whales. From a
paleontological standpoint, diversification of many
orders occurred over a relatively short period of time
[1], which makes changes in form even more curious.
One potential model for understanding the genetic basis
of evolutionary change in mammalian form is the
domestic dog, Canis familiaris. Domestication and
strong directional selection (for example, artificial selection) for phenotypic and behavioural traits have resulted
in morphological diversity within the domestic dog
unparalleled in any wild mammalian species. In approximately 15,000 years the level of morphological divergence among dog breeds has exceeded that seen
between many genera of wild canids [2-4]. Today, the
400 plus breeds of dogs vary in size, shape of the skull
and modifications of the postcranial skeleton (in particular the limb bones) to a degree that would suggest
species-level, if not generic-level, differences, if their
remains were discovered in the wild.
Darwin’s [5] entire theory of evolution by means of
natural selection provides a material explanation for
diversity of form in nature. He used examples from
domesticated plants and animals as analogies for how

adaptation can arise from selection acting on variations
that cause differences in reproductive success across
generations. As Gregory [6] indicates, we can learn
many lessons about evolution in natural systems
through detailed studies of our domesticated species,
and variation in the domestic dog raises a number of
questions commonly asked about wild species of mammals: (1) what is the domestic dog’s closest relative?; (2)
where did the domestic dog originate and was there a
single origin or multiple origins of domestic dog
lineages?; (3) when did domestication of the dog occur?;
(4) what genetic changes accompany the differences
observed among breeds of dogs and their wild canid
ancestors?
As with the studies of human origins over the past
two decades [7-10], many of the above questions related
to the domestic dog are being addressed in considerable
detail with the use of phylogenetics, population genetics,
molecular biology and comparative genomics [11-19].
This commentary was prompted by a recent paper in
BMC Biology [20] that addressed differences in size
among breeds of dogs as well as the timing and origin
of small-sized dogs. The foundation for this paper originated with the work of Sutter et al. [21], who used a
genome-wide survey and association analysis in the Portuguese water dog to identify a QTL (quantitative trait
locus) on chromosome 15 that sorted with body size. In
particular, IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) was suggested as a candidate gene for body size variation in
domestic dogs and variation at 116 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for 526 dogs clustered into two
major groups, small and large breeds. Gray et al. [20]
expanded upon these findings by using specific molecular markers (SNPs, microsatellite loci, insertion/deletion

of a SINE element and nucleotide sequences) to characterize the segregation of domestic dogs into two major
groups, small and large body size. As shown by their
study, most small breeds of dog have two unique markers (SINE element insertion in intron 2 of the IGF1
gene and a SNP allele) not found in either wolves or
large breeds. Based on the phylogenetic and geographic
distribution of sequence variants associated with the
‘small dog haplotype’, these authors concluded that
small dogs originated in the Middle East, as they share a
relationship with wolves from this region. Furthermore,
they suggest that changes unique to small size occurred
early in the evolution of domestic dogs. As a result of
these findings and more recent molecular-based studies
on the evolution of the domestic dog, I will provide an

update on how close we are to resolving the above
questions.

Ancestry of the domestic dog
Darwin [5] stated that ‘I do not believe, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended from any
one wild species’. Rather, he suggested that domestic
dogs ‘descended from several wild species’. Phylogenetic
analyses derived from molecular markers support an origin of the domestic dog from one ancestor, the wolf
(Canis lupus), thus refuting Darwin’s hypothesis
([11,22]; Figure 1). The unresolved issue relates to
whether or not all lineages of dogs originated from a
single wolf stock or multiple stocks of wolves. Most studies of variation at the mitochondrial control region

suggest that patterns of relationship among dog and
wolf mitochondrial lineages is the result of multiple origins of dogs from different wolf stocks followed by
introgressive hybridization between dogs and wolves
[11,22,23]. A recent study of variation at the Mhc
(major histocompatibility) locus also suggested that the
high level of variation observed at this locus is best
explained by continued backcrossing between dogs and
wolves subsequent to domestication [16]. These results
contrast with a recent study [19] based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that implies an origin for the
domestic dog from a ‘single gene pool’, rather than multiple domestication events and continued hybridization
with wolf stocks. There is one reason why I doubt the
conclusions from Pang et al. [19]. Their analysis compared patterns of variation in 1576 dog mtDNA to 40
wolf sequences. Such asymmetry in sampling of the wolf
population is likely to bias any conclusions about origin.
Given the fact that wolves, dogs and other members of
the genus Canis are inter-fertile [24-26], there is a high
likelihood that dogs and wolves interbred subsequent to
hybridization, thus complicating the derivation of the
number of founders for dog lineages.

Time and centre of the origin of the domestic
dog
Hypotheses related to the geographic and temporal origin of the domestic dog are reminiscent of studies
related to human origins. One of the more practical
obstacles that must be overcome relates to the conflicts
between estimates of time since divergence based on
archaeology and those derived from a molecular clock.
Based on a calibration point between wolf and coyote
and a mitochondrial molecular clock, time since divergence between the wolf and domestic dog was estimated
to be between76, 000 and 135,000 years ago [11], which
is considerably higher than the 13,000 to 17,000 years
ago based on archaeological evidence [27]. This discrepancy is not resolved by more recent interpretations of
molecular data and, in many cases, the basis for a reassessment of molecular data is not clear. For instance,
Gray et al. [20] indicated that small dogs originated
about 12,000 years ago, yet they fail to indicate how
they had arrived at this date. It appears that their argument is based primarily on archaeological evidence that
reveals the first appearance of a small dog phenotype in
the Middle East. Nevertheless, older dates for the origin
of dogs have been reported and one must question a
date based on archaeology alone, especially since information from archaeology has been used to support several different centres of origin for the domestic dog.
Pang et al. [19] also suggested that the domestic dog
originated less than 16,300 years ago, but details for the
molecular calibrations are lacking. As a result of

Page 3 of 5

conflicts between dates derived from molecular and
archeological data, it appears that most recent molecular
studies embrace data provided by archaeological evidence. The discrepancy seen between divergence times
derived from fossil materials and molecules is not
unique to dog origins. Part of the incongruence relates
to the inherent error associated with any estimates of
time since divergence for recent divergences among
lineages, especially when the origin of such lineages is
complicated by the possibility of multiple origins from
an ancestral stock and admixture [17].
Issues related to estimates for the centre of origin for
the domestic dog are still complicated and, again, it
relates to how one interprets the archaeological and
molecular data. As reviewed by Verginelli et al. [23],
some of the earliest fossils identified as dog occur
between 12,000 and 17,000 years ago in Europe and the
Middle East, and there is some evidence for Eastern
European wolf populations contributing to the origin of
the domestic dog. In contrast, based on higher levels of
mtDNA variation in dogs from East Asia and the
general phylogeographic partitioning of that variation,
Savolainen et al. [28] argue for a single East Asian origin
of the domestic dog and this conclusion appears
congruent with some archaeological evidence [29].
The problem with this particular study, however,
relates to the small number of wolf samples examined
relative to dogs. Given the diversity in wolf populations
distributed worldwide, one would think that a large
number of individuals and populations of the ancestral
species should be examined. The arguments by Gray et
al. [20] for the origin of small-sized dogs in the Middle
East are based on the similarity between wolves from
the Middle East and small dogs. Nevertheless, from a
phylogenetic standpoint, support for this hypothesis is
tenuous, given the small bootstrap values. As an alternative, one might argue that the two shared traits associated with small size in dogs may reflect convergence
as a result of artificial selection for size rather than
divergence from a single common ancestor in the Middle East.

Genetic basis of morphological diversity in the
domestic dog
Despite the high level of phenotypic variation among
breeds, genetic divergence within the domestic dog and
between most species of the genus Canis is quite low.
All species of Canis have identical karyotypes [30] and
genetic comparisons based on mitochondrial and
nuclear genes reveal low levels of divergence between
members of this genus [11,22,31]. In part, this level of
genetic similarity explains the level of inter-fertility seen
among species of Canis. As suggested by Gray et al.
[32], the dog experienced two population bottlenecks,

Honeycutt BMC Biology 2010, 8:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/20

the first associated with domestication and the second
with the formation of various breeds, with the latter
responsible for most of the loss in genetic diversity. This
has resulted in much higher linkage disequilibrium in
dogs compared to humans [13]. Although mtDNA markers fail to reveal breed-specific markers [11], both
microsatellite loci [33] and SNPs [15] are capable of
assigning individual purebred dogs to their specified
breed. Nevertheless, genetic markers to date are considerably less effective at providing well-supported phylogenetic groups of breeds, primarily as a result of most
breeds differing more by allele frequency than fixed differences. Therefore, reconstructing the overall phylogeny
of domestic dogs is considerably more complicated as a
result of the recent origin of many breeds coupled with
high levels of admixture during breed formation.
Deciphering the underlying genetic causes of morphological diversity in the domestic dog presents considerable challenges. Top-down approaches [34], using a
QTL mapping, linkage disequilibrium mapping and
association analyses are all methods that take advantage
of the dog genome sequence. Furthermore, such methods bypass the need for large pedigrees. Such an
approach has proven useful in identifying candidate
genes and the mutations responsible for traits associated
with spotting and the hair ridge in Rhodesian ridgebacks
[18]. These same methods allowed Sutter et al. [21] and
Gray et al. [20] to identify a chromosomal region whose
variation appears to be associated with size differences
in dogs. Despite these advances as a result of comparative genomics and marker-assisted mapping, deciphering
the mechanisms responsible for the origin of form in
the domestic dog will be challenging. For instance, the
QTL identified by Sutter et al. [21] appears to be associated with size, yet variation at the IGF1 locus does not
appear to be ‘a major contributor to body size in all
small dogs’. Association analyses are an excellent first
approximation but multifactorial traits resulting from
gene/environment interactions and epistasis complicate
our understanding of the genetic basis of form.
As stated by Carroll [35], ‘The key to understanding
form is development’. The question still remains - What
processes are responsible for the diversity of forms
observed in the domestic dog? Rather than major modifications in structural genes, changes may be considerably more subtle and involve changes in the timing of
gene expression, the alteration of interactions among
various gene products and variation in regions of genes
controlling development. Such changes might allow for
changes in the phenotype without major genetic divergence. The domestic dog may very well offer clues to
the types of changes in form observed in nature, such as
those observed for the mammalian radiations, and this
is the reason why continued research on genes

controlling development in dogs is an exciting avenue of
research.
