A key role of the basal ganglia in pain and
analgesia - insights gained through human
functional imaging
Review

Abstract
The basal ganglia (BG) are composed of several nuclei involved in neural processing related to the execution of motor,
cognitive and emotional activities. Preclinical and clinical data have implicated a role for these structures in pain
processing. Recently neuroimaging has added important information on BG activation in conditions of acute pain,
chronic pain and as a result of drug effects. Our current understanding of alterations in cortical and sub-cortical regions
in pain suggests that the BG are uniquely involved in thalamo-cortico-BG loops to integrate many aspects of pain.
These include the integration of motor, emotional, autonomic and cognitive responses to pain.
Introduction
The basal ganglia (BG) consist of the striatum (caudate
(C), putamen (Pu) and the core of the nucleus accumbens), the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP),
the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STh), and the substantia nigra (SN) [13] (Figure 1). Although best known for their role in motor
systems, these regions are a major site for adaptive plasticity in the brain, affecting a broad range of normal
behaviors [4] and neurological and psychiatric conditions
[5].
The first section of this review, Basal Ganglia: Pain
Processing, summarizes the role of the BG in pain processing as has been reported in specific research and
review papers. In the section titled Basal Ganglia: Functional Imaging Studies of Pain in Humans, we describe
functional imaging studies in humans reporting activation of the BG in acute pain, chronic pain, and in
response to analgesics. The third section titled Basal
Ganglia: Lessons Learned from Functional Imaging
attempts to integrate the information about lessons
learned from functional imaging. The final section, Basal
Ganglia: Imaging and Improved understanding of Clinical
Applications, describes how imaging may provide insight
to how and why certain therapies may be useful. Future

measures of BG function may contribute significantly to
our understanding about the brain changes associated
with chronic pain and specific therapies that may change
the brain in a manner that corresponds with therapeutic
effects.
Basal Ganglia: Pain Processing

Both preclinical and clinical data support a role for the
BG in pain processing [6,7].
Data supporting a role for the BG in pain and analgesia
processing have been derived from numerous preclinical
studies. These studies include electrophysiology [8,9],
analgesic effects of microinjections into these regions
[10], electrolytic lesion studies [11], chemical lesions of
dopaminergic terminals [12,13], activation of striatal
dopamine systems producing analgesia in rats [14] and
imaging drug effects in neuropathic rat models [15]. In
addition, novel pain pathways, for example those projecting from the spinal cord to the globus pallidus [16], have
been discovered. Since the major review on the involvement of the basal ganglia in pain [6,7], the examples of
preclinical studies noted above are not exhaustive and
more recent studies have included numerous other contributions (e.g., [9,10,17-19]).
In the clinical domain, two disease patterns epitomize
the role of the BG in pain - Parkinson's disease (PD) and
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). In PD, the initial pathology involves the BG (i.e., loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra [20]) that results in move-

ment disorders, and affected subjects frequently have
chronic pain [21-24]. In CRPS the initial event is most
often relatively minor damage to a peripheral nerve
[25,26], but with time expression of frequently associated
movement disorders may become evident, thereby implicating BG involvement [27-30]. Both conditions are associated with movement disorders and both are associated
with pain. In chronic pain, alterations of multiple subcortical and cortical processing, including sensory, emotional/affective, cognitive and modulatory systems, are
present. Independent of specific somatosensory regions
and pain modulation (e.g., SI and pain intensity, PAG and
pain facilitation/inhibition), recent functional neuroimaging data suggest that the BG appear to be intimately
involved in these processes.
Lesions of the BG in patients have offered further
insights into the potential role of BG in pain and analgesia. Infarction of the lenticular nucleus (composed of the
putamen and globus pallidus) may result in sensory deficits including pain in some patients [31]. Both unilateral
and bilateral deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus
have been reported to improve pain by approximately
70%, and this improvement may persist for a significant
period of time [32]. In Parkinson's disease, bilateral pallidotomy produces pain relief [33]. Taken together, these
data provide insights into the potential contributions of
the BG in chronic pain in humans.
Multisensory integration takes place in the BG [34,35]
that serves an important role in behavioral actions
including motor responses [36]. The BG receives inputs
from all cortical areas (including medial and orbital, prefrontal, dorsolateral, premotor and motor cortex, sensorimotor and parietal cortex) and the thalamus. Multiple
cortical areas receive afferents from a single thalamic
nucleus and send back information to different thalamic
nuclei [37]. Efferent pathways from the BG project to

frontal lobe areas including prefrontal, premotor and
supplementary motor areas (used in motor planning).
Thus the BG are well positioned to have influences on
cortical regions involved in motor responses, in behavior
relating to predicting events, and involved in attention
and learning [38]. Using probabilistic tractography, a
recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study on connectivity patterns of the BG in humans [39] showed segregated and overlapping loops that include prefrontal,
premotor, and motor networks to BG sub-regions (see
Figure 2). In the cat for example, electrophysiological
recordings have shown that neurons in the BG respond to
visual, auditory and somatosensory information [35].
How this integration takes place is not well understood,
but BG circuits are in a unique position to integrate cortical information to increase the speed of data processing
tasks [40-42]. Similar processing may take place with
emotional and cognitive information. Such processing is
relevant to pain because the response to acute or chronic
pain involves sensory, motor, autonomic, cognitive and
emotional integration.
Figure 3 shows the connectivity patterns of the BG with
respect to possible pain processing. Pain inputs into the
BG may be considered to be from two major sources: (1)
Afferent inputs from pain sensing systems via direct (e.g.,
spino-BG) and indirect (e.g., spino-thalamic-BG) pathways; and (2) from cortical and sub-cortical brain regions
that contribute to the BG-Thalamic-Cortical loops. Cortical regions involved in these feedback loops are also
known to have important roles in pain processing. These
areas include the ACC, regions of the frontal lobe (e.g.,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPF), orbitofrontal cor-

multiple inputs from cortical and subcortical regions as noted in the

Chudler and Dong have also reported putative nociceptive pathways into and out of the basal ganglia [6,7].
Basal Ganglia: Functional Imaging Studies of Pain in
Humans

Functional imaging studies in healthy volunteers and
patients with chronic pain have supported a growing role
of the BG in pain processing. Previous work has suggested that the BG may be involved in most aspects of
pain processing including sensory-discriminative, emotional/affective, cognitive dimension of pain and pain
modulation [7]. Given our current understanding of these
brain regions in the pain brain phenotype (i.e., functional
brain changes in healthy and disease (see [43]) and our
understanding of the basic integrative role the BG may
play neural processing, it is suggested that the BG play a
pivotal role in the behavioral manifestations of chronic
pain. Although a large literature exists on the role of the

BG in non-motor activities [44], brain imaging studies of
acute and chronic pain have contributed to supporting
preclinical and clinical work as playing an increasingly
important role in acute and chronic pain processing and
in the effects of some analgesics on brain function (Tables
1, 2 and 3).
Since there are multiple sub-regions within the BG,
preclinical studies using specific methods cannot easily
define how these interact at the same time to integrate
such information, including pain. Understanding the
functional processing of pain and analgesia in these
regions might afford insights into complex behaviors of
brain systems in acute and chronic pain and help us
understand how analgesics might affect pain processing.
Brain imaging in humans includes a number of methods
such as functional MRI (fMRI), pharmacological MRI
(phMRI), morphometric/anatomical measures (diffusion
tensor imaging and gray matter volumetric analysis), and

Basal Ganglia Activation in Acute Pain (Figure 4, Tables 1, 2
and 3)
Noxious Stimuli

Early studies of pain using fMRI indicated activation patterns in the BG including the putamen and globus pallidus. These early observations have now been replicated
in a number of functional imaging studies of experimental pain in humans, examples of which are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. As noted in the tables, a considerable similarity exists in the activation patterns from multiple
stimuli, including thermal (heat and cold), mechanical (in
a hyperalgesic capsaicin model), painful electrical and
visceral pain. Subsequent studies showed what seemed to
be specific regional activation in other BG structures
including the nucleus accumbens [45] and putamen
[46,47]. However, most studies have evaluated or
reported activation patterns and observed striatal
involvement in a general context.
Tables 1 and 2 show positive activation is present in the
caudate nucleus across multiple studies and across multiple modalities. In addition to those mentioned in the
tables, activation in the caudate is present in "prickle"
sensation evoked by cold stimuli [48]. In our own studies,
cold has previously been shown to activate basal ganglia
including the caudate [49]. Activation in the caudate
nucleus to noxious stimulation has been suggested to be
part of a pain modulatory system [50,51]. In support of
this, electrical stimulation of the caudate in non-human
primates diminished pain reactivity [52]. The authors
suggested that the results indicate that the effect of caudate stimulation is to reduce the affective components of
pain elicited by noxious electrocutaneous stimuli.
A few studies have evaluated specific activation in the
putamen and nucleus accumbens. As noted in Tables 1

[82]

and 2, the putamen is commonly activated across most
acute pain imaging studies. Pain activated the putamen
bilaterally and a somatotopic organization for hand- and
foot-related responses was only present in the contralateral putamen [53]. In healthy women, pain-evoked
putaminal activation occurred during their follicular
phase [54].
Activation of globus pallidus following painful stimulation has been shown in healthy subjects (Tables 1 and 2).
Unlike the caudate and putamen, fewer studies have specifically reported activation in this BG structure. However, like the caudate and putamen, the globus pallidus
has neurons that respond to noxious stimulation [9].
The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain substrate
known to be involved in reward-aversion processing, has
been shown to respond with opposite BOLD signal
valence to rewarding or aversive stimuli [45,55]. Using a
pain onset (aversive) and pain offset (rewarding) prolonged stimulus, a negative signal change with pain onset
and a positive signal change with pain offset was
observed in the NAc contralateral to the stimulus. The
study supports the idea that the NAc fMRI signal may
provide a useful marker for the effects of pain and analgesia in healthy volunteers. A parallel study on NAc activation in response to the direct effects of the analgesic (pain
offset) morphine, showed the same increased (rewarding)
BOLD signal in the structure [56]. Direct afferents from
the trigeminal nucleus to the nucleus accumbens have
been demonstrated in the rat; these have contralateral
projections from lamina I but bilateral with contralateral
predominance from lamina V [57]. These anatomical
studies seem to agree with other studies showing contralateral activation in the NAc [45,55]. Subsequent studies
indicated two components of activation within the NAc an anterior, superior, and lateral component and another
component that was posterior, inferior, and medial within
the structure. The anatomical segregation may correlate
with the functional components of the NAc (i.e., shell and

core) that have been defined in other species (see [58]).
The results support heterogeneity of function within the
NAc and have implications for understanding the contribution of NAc function in processing of pain and analgesia [58]. The NAc has a pivotal role in aversive and
rewarding (hedonic) processing [59].
Given that the reward system is part of the pain network [45], and that the placebo response is clearly
involved in analgesia [60,61], it is not surprising that
functional imaging has been the ideal technology to better understand neural networks involved in placebo in
humans [62,63]. Recent reviews suggest that multiple
brain regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, anterior
insula, prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal grey) are
important in the placebo response [64]. Other studies
strongly implicate the NAc and ventral BG in the placebo
response [65].
Basal Ganglia Activation in Chronic Pain (Figure 4, Tables 1,
2 and 3)

An increase in gray matter in the BG has been reported in
chronic back pain patients [66], in fibromyalgia [67], and
in chronic vulval pain [68], suggesting some underlying
functional alterations that drive these changes. In other
chronic pain conditions, alterations in activation in BG

regions have been demonstrated [55,69] where stimulation to the affected neuropathic regions produces significant activation in the BG. Specifically, contrast analysis
between the affected and unaffected regions resulted in
increased activation in the globus pallidus and putamen
to mechanical and cold allodynia, as well as decreased
activation in the caudate nucleus to mechanical, cold and
heat allodynia [55]. Taken together these data appear to
show a consistent decrease in the caudate nucleus to pain
produced across multiple painful stimuli. Similarly, functional imaging of pain in a group of pediatric patients
with CRPS has shown significant activation in the BG
with cold and brush stimuli, and also displays decreased
activation in the caudate nucleus [70].
Chronic pain has also been shown to alter BG structure
with measures of gray matter volume and white matter
tract integrity. In a more recent report, measures of gray
matter morphometry and white matter anisotropy were
measured in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) [71]. Alterations in morphometry indicated atrophy in a single cluster encompassing the right
insula, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),
and right NAc. Additionally, decreased connectivity was
reported between the ventromedial prefrontal cortices to
the BG [71].

Borsook et al. Molecular Pain 2010, 6:27
http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/27

Alterations in dopaminergic and opioidergic function
in the BG have been reported in clinical pain conditions.
In patients with burning mouth syndrome, decreases in
dopamine in the putamen suggest reduced dopaminergic
inhibition may contribute to the chronic pain condition
[72]. In addition, both atypical facial pain [73] and fibromyalgia patients [74] show an abnormal dopamine
response. Such data are consistent with other conditions
associated with decreased dopamine, including Parkinson's disease [75,76]. In addition to the alterations in dopamine, decreased μ binding in chronic pain conditions
such as fibromyalgia may contribute to altered pain processing [77]. In psychiatric disorders, pain produces
increased activation in putaminal regions in post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, [78] that when considered
with the diminished pain sensitivity reported in this
patient group may also be caused in part to abnormalities
within the BG.
Basal Ganglia Activation and Analgesics (Figure 4, Tables 1,
2 and 3)

Functional imaging of drug effects (also known as pharmacological MRI or phMRI) has been done in the context
of BG function in preclinical [79] and clinical [80,81] conditions. The evaluation of direct brain changes in functional activity in response to known analgesic drugs has
been limited to a small group that include morphine [55],
naloxone [82], remifentanil [83] and buprenorphine [84].
Direct effects of μ opioid agonist or antagonist infusions
both show activation in the BG, including the NAc. In
these experiments, the direction of BOLD signal is opposite with increased activation following morphine infusion [55] and a decreased activation following infusion of
naloxone [82] in healthy volunteers. The opposite direct
pharmacological effects indicate some specificity of
response but may also underlie NAc drive with respect to
pain and analgesia. An increased activation may be part
of an endogenous analgesic drive or emotional drive since
increased activation patterns within the NAc are also
seen in other fMRI experiments on reward [85-87]. The
increase (hyperalgesic) pain response (inhibition of tonic
opioid drive) to pain was observed in brain regions following naloxone that included concurrent activation in
the globus pallidus, caudate and putamen. Opioids may
produce changes in the BG including increases in D2
receptor binding [88]. However not all imaging studies
report BG activation in response to opioids, either
because they were not specifically focused on these
regions or they used less sensitive methods (e.g., alfentanil [89]; remifentanil [90]).
Few authors have evaluated the effects of non-opioid
analgesics on BG responsiveness. In one example,
although not specifically referred to in their paper, gabapentin reduced activation in the BG [91]; specifically, for

Page 10 of 17

gabapentin vs. placebo comparison in a hyperalgesic paradigm, deactivation in the caudate was present in the single dose study in healthy volunteers.
Other drugs, considered to be analgesics, have been
evaluated using imaging in a similar manner to that noted
above, and these studies report alterations in the human
striatum. For example tetrahydrocannabinol (known to
be an analgesic [92]) produces dopamine release in the
striatum [93]. Similar results have been shown for the
NMDA antagonist ketamine (reviewed by [94]).
Lessons Learned from Imaging

Based on imaging data of pain as well as a growing literature on pain in conditions with abnormalities of BG function, it is clear that a constellation of brain regions plays
an important role in acute and chronic pain (see Tables 1,
2 and 3). With the exception of studies on the NAc and
the pallidum (see above), few functional imaging studies
in humans have attempted to evaluate other regions of
the BG function in pain. Nevertheless there is increasing
evidence for the important roles of the region in neural
systems' adaptation to pain.
Putamen (P) shows consistent increase in activation across
multiple pain imaging studies

The putamen, a structure that shows somatotopic activation to pain [53], is consistently activated during acute
and chronic pain conditions and is affected by analgesic
administration. Chronic pain has also been shown to
increase putamen volume (see [67]) suggesting, perhaps,
that a continuous drive producing increased activation
may result in processes that enhance gray matter volume
in the structure. This region may receive direct inputs
from sensory systems, but also from cortical inputs.
Some studies (e.g., [83]) have suggested delayed functional activation in BG circuits (e.g., caudate) following
remifentanil, implicating that activation in these regions
occurs as a consequence or subsequent to initial activation of thalamo-cortical circuits. Activation seems to be
present with painful stimuli but missing with non-painful
stimuli [95].
Opposite Signal Changes in Caudate and NAc in Acute vs.
Chronic Pain

In contrast to increases in putaminal activation for acute
pain, BOLD signals are opposite in chronic pain across
multiple pain studies. The reason for this observation is
not known although the nature of reward processing in
acute vs. chronic pain is clearly different [45,59,71].
Smaller Nuclei (ST, SN) are not clearly defined in many fMRI
studies

Only a few brain imaging studies have reported activation
in the smaller nuclei of the BG even though they may be
present. Although there are studies in animals investigating SN mechanisms of pain [96], future brain imaging
studies in humans will contribute to our understanding of

Borsook et al. Molecular Pain 2010, 6:27
http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/27

the role of these nuclei in pain processing. Developments
such as accurate automated identification of sub-nuclei
within the basal ganglia should be helpful in measures of
functional brain changes [97].
Feed-forward and Feedback Loops - Integrating, Modifying,
and Modulating the Pain Experience

The BG are involved in the integration of information
between cortical and thalamic regions and in particular
the three domains of pain processing - sensory, emotional/cognitive and endogenous/modulatory. Some
investigators have suggested that these regions have
evolved as a "centralized selection device to resolve conflicts over access to limited motor and cognitive
resources" [98]. Phylogenetically older, sub-cortical connections exist between the BG and brainstem regions
involved in sensorimotor processing [99], and more
recent evidence points to BG involvement through direct
connections from sensory inputs not involving cortical
loops [100]. Dysfunctional cortico-BG-thalamic loops
may contribute to the maintenance of chronic pain and
the evolution of altered neural processing that may be a
basis for co-morbid behaviors. Whether brain processing
of pain is dependent on external neural drive (i.e., peripheral/feed-forward inputs) or internal neural drive (i.e.,
subcortical or cortical drive/feedback), the BG are central
processors that may play a role in integrating these divergent inputs that may modify pain over time.

Clinical Applications
Cortical Stimulation and Chronic Pain - Acting via CorticoStriatal-Thalamic Loops

Cortical stimulation has been used either directly with
electrodes placed on the motor cortex [101] or through
the use of repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS)
[102]. Some investigators have postulated that motor cortex neurostimulation produces an analgesic effect by
modulation of the affective components of pain and not
of the sensory components [103]. In support of this
hypothesis, stimulation of the secondary somatosensory
cortex (SII), but not motor cortex, results in increased
pain thresholds and altered discriminative capacity to
pain [104]. A combination of motor cortex stimulation
(MCS) and postoperative fMRI showed an inhibiting
effect on the primary sensorimotor cortex as well as on
the contralateral primary motor and sensitive cortices
[105] without changes in BG. Others have argued that
MCS may act through activation of perigenual cingulate
and orbitofrontal areas to alter the emotional appraisal of
pain or cortical-brainstem (e.g., PAG) activation that
enhances inhibition of pain [106] or alterations in endogenous opioid systems [107]. Given the cortico-striatal
loops, stimulation of a number of cortical regions may

Page 11 of 17

thus be involved in pain reduction. Stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, motor cortex or sensory cortices
may have different effects based on the specificity of cortico-striatal loops. In addition, connectivity between the
BG and modulatory regions including the PAG/brainstem or through the NAc [108-110] may also contribute
to the potential mechanism of cortical activation resulting in analgesia.
Anterior Cingulate Lesions and Pain Control

Both clinical [111] and preclinical [112] studies have suggested that the ACC results in alterations of pain processing. The interesting issue seems to be the dissociation of
pain intensity from pain affect (caring about the pain)
[113,114]. The ACC in humans may be involved with
linking reward-related information [115] and with alternative actions, since destruction of the ACC results in
errors related to planning [116]. The ACC has projections
to the caudate nucleus and the NAc [117], and ACC
lesions may produce an attenuation of a negative pain
affect [118] through a combination of neural networks
that include these circuits.
BG and Learned Behaviors

Pain is clearly a complex process that affects multiple
brain systems. It debatable if pain is a learned behavior,
but the BG may have a role in learning due to its involvement in habit and stimulus-response learning [119]. Such
learning may be derived from pain related regions
involved in sensory (e.g., pain intensity coding regions
such as SI), affective (e.g., cingulate or anterior insula) or
cognitive functioning (medial and lateral prefrontal cortices). Similar to the notion of "chunking action repertoires" for motor action, it may be that pain related
repertoires include motor related changes.
BG and Emergence of Central Pain

Aside from CRPS, other conditions including depression
and Parkinson's disease have BG pathology that may be
important in their clinical presentation of centralized
pain [120]. In Parkinson's disease with central pain, electrophysiological measures of pain pathways are normal,
but hyperalgesia to repetitive stimuli is present; this is
attenuated by L-dopa [121], and altered central processing in these conditions results in generalized pain symptoms. Although the basis for these changes is unknown, it
may be the result of altered chemicals in the BG, such as
central dopamine, or related to aberrant networks that
induce a kindling-like pain [122]. Changes in neural connectivity that produce changes in increased synaptic
strength [123] and could include pain facilitatory circuits
[124] may also underlie these changes. Although the basis
for these changes is unknown, alterations may then lead
to other changes such as abnormal gating of sensorymotor function involving parallel changes thalamic
regions [125]. Imaging patients with depression in whom

Borsook et al. Molecular Pain 2010, 6:27
http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/27

non-dermatomal sensory deficits were present shows
that hypometabolic patterns (FDG-PET) of activation in
the putamen was observed [126].
Regions of the thalamus including the paramedian and
anterolateral are known to be involved with central pain
(e.g., post stroke pain) [38,127]. The striatum receives
excitatory input from the thalamus. The centromedian
(CM) and parafascicular (Pf ) thalamic nuclei are important sources of thalamostriatal projections [128] and send
connections to the putamen and caudate [128,129].
Moreover, the topography of these connections corresponds with cortical sensorimotor territory observed following cortical injections [130].
Basal Ganglia and Opioid Systems

The BG has high levels of endogenous opioids, and high
binding of opioid receptors are present within the BG
[131]. In a number of chronic pain conditions, receptorbinding studies indicate a decreased opioidergic tone.
Many analgesics act at the level of the basal ganglia and
may contribute to both analgesic and addictive processes.
An understanding of how these functional processes are
differentiated by different endogenous chemicals (e.g.,
opioidergic vs. dopaminergic (see [65])) may contribute
to better analgesics since opioidergic tone might be
abnormal [77].

Dopaminergic Drugs and Pain

Given that pain now has a functional basis in terms of
regions activated including those that are classically
involved in reward [45], and that chronic pain may be a
reward deficit syndrome [132], modulating dopamine
may have important possibilities for pain treatment. Parkinson's disease patients have improved pain control
when treated with L-dopa [21,121]. Changes in dopamine
are a critical element in Parkinson's disease where abnormal pain processing is present in both conditions. Recent
imaging data have reported a direct correlation between
striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptors and sensory thresholds as being selective for the modality of pain but not for
non-painful stimuli [133]. Striatal dopamine D2/D3
receptors may control a modulatory pathway producing a
parallel shift in the stimulus-response function for sensory signals [134]. Others have suggested differential processing of pain within the BG - a more dorsal DA D2
receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the caudate and
putamen that correlates with subjective ratings of sensory
and affective qualities of the pain, along with a more ventral system involving the NAc, is associated with emotional processing [135]. Such differences may be
important in drug effects on pain. The use of antipsychotic medications for pain is not new [136], and the

chronic pain. Future work should help contribute to further understanding functional and anatomical connectivity of inputs and circuits that show how the BG may be
involved in acute and chronic pain. Such findings may
present an increasing and important role of these brain
regions in the centralization of chronic pain and the contribution to the altered brain in chronic pain conditions.
Future studies, using a combination of imaging
approaches, will help define the specificity of BG in pain
processing. For example, functional connectivity analysis
can demonstrate probable correlations between BG subdivisions and other brain regions [141].
Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Figure 5 Basal Ganglia Function in Acute and Chronic Pain. Top:
Acute Pain Processing is a normal response where pain produces responses in brain circuits that usually revert to normal. Some of these
processes are integrated in the BG and result in escape responses:
components of memory and learning of pain and affective responses
to pain. Bottom: In chronic pain both inputs from peripheral systems
and cortical and subcortical regions are abnormal. The result is that BG
functions as well as cortico-BG-thalamic loop functions are altered. The
result may be altered integration of sensori-motor responses, cognitive impairment and emotional processing.

number needed to treat (NNT; this is the number of
patients to be treated for the first subject to show a 50%
analgesic effect) of 2.6 is very competitive with the best
drugs available for chronic pain [137]. However, these
drugs have extrapyramidal and sedative effects, and atypical antipsychotics that have fewer side effects may have
analgesic properties as assessed in a limited number of
studies [138]. Newer drugs that target specific dopamine
receptors may prove to be more useful.
BG Deep Brain Stimulation and Strategies for Pain Relief

Brain imaging affords the possibility to measure changes
in brain circuits that may be altered as a result of deep
brain stimulation. Some of these have shown specific
changes in BG circuitry [139]. In the latter, stimulation of
the ventroposterior medial thalamus (VPM) resulted in
decreases in activation of the substantia nigra when activation prior to stimulation vs. post stimulation that provided pain relief was measured (pain, no stimulation vs.
no pain, no stimulation). Thalamic stimulation may activate thalamo-cortical-BG loops that contribute to the
analgesic response [140].

Conclusions
Functional imaging of pain has shown clear and consistent changes in the BG in pain conditions. Table 4 summarizes the salient features of each sub-region of the BG
as it pertains to overall putative function and specific
functions in pain, and Figure 5 summarizes potential
alterations in BG outputs affecting behaviors in acute and
