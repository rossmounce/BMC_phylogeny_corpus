Abstract
Background: Lupinus angustifolius L, also known as narrow-leafed lupin (NLL), is becoming an important grain
legume crop that is valuable for sustainable farming and is becoming recognised as a potential human health
food. Recent interest is being directed at NLL to improve grain production, disease and pest management and
health benefits of the grain. However, studies have been hindered by a lack of extensive genomic resources for the
species.
Results: A NLL BAC library was constructed consisting of 111,360 clones with an average insert size of 99.7 Kbp
from cv Tanjil. The library has approximately 12 × genome coverage. Both ends of 9600 randomly selected BAC
clones were sequenced to generate 13985 BAC end-sequences (BESs), covering approximately 1% of the NLL
genome. These BESs permitted a preliminary characterisation of the NLL genome such as organisation and
composition, with the BESs having approximately 39% G:C content, 16.6% repetitive DNA and 5.4% putative geneencoding regions. From the BESs 9966 simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified and some of these are
shown to be potential markers.
Conclusions: The NLL BAC library and BAC-end sequences are powerful resources for genetic and genomic
research on lupin. These resources will provide a robust platform for future high-resolution mapping, map-based
cloning, comparative genomics and assembly of whole-genome sequencing data for the species.

Background
The genus Lupinus, belongs to the subfamily Papilionoideae of the Leguminosae (syn. Fabaceae) forming an important part of Papilionoideae, occupying the genistoid clade
which is phylogenetically distinct from its sister clades.
These sister clades contain the majority of scientifically and
economically important legumes: Aeschynomnoid-Dalbergioids (Arachis [peanut]), Phaseoloid-Millettioids (Glycine
max [soybean]) and Phaseolus vulgaris [common bean])
and the Hologalegina clade (Lotus japonicus, Medicago
truncatula, Pisum sativa [pea], Vicia faba [broad bean],
Lens culinaris [lentil], Trifolium [clover] and Cicer

arietinum [chickpea]). In the past decade, concerted efforts
have been directed to understanding the genomics, evolution and biological characterisation of these sister clades
[1-4]. However, genistoids are the least exploited group of
legumes and lupins remain as one of the lesser studied
legume crops.
Lupins have traditionally been used for animal feed but
are gaining recognition as a health food for humans, due
to their unique dietary composition. The seeds contain a
high level of protein (30-40%) and dietary fibre (30%),
low oil and negligible starch, resulting in the lowest
recorded Glycaemic Index of any commercial grain crop
[5]. The protein content in lupin seed is similar to that in
soybean, but lupin has lower levels of phytoestrogens
which may potentially constitute a significant health risk
[6,7]. Thus, lupins are an attractive alternative to

soybean. Moreover, lupin seeds also contain constituents
that alter satiety and other features of human health with
the prospect of pharmaceutical potential [8-10]. With
increased incidence of obesity and the associated risk of
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, lupins are an excellent candidate as a healthy food.
Lupins are adapted to a range of highly divergent climatic and environmental conditions [11], providing direct
and indirect benefits in rotation with cereal crops under
rain fed conditions and limited soil nutrient supply.
Despite their agronomic potential lupins are not widely
exploited and, as a consequence, have not attracted the
intense molecular research required for genomic characterisation. In contrast, a wealth of genomic resources has
been generated for two model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus [2,3]. In recent years, genetic and
genomic resources have also been developed to different
degrees for other major grain and pasture legume crops,
including pea (Pisum sativum), soybean (Glycine max
L. Merr.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), mung
bean (Vigna radiate), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L),
groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and clover (Trifolium
repens L) [12-18]. For lupin, the major significant advances
have been the establishment of draft genetic maps for both
NLL and white lupin (Lupinus albus L), which employed a
variety of techniques and markers. The majority of the
markers were derived from comparative genomics among
related legume and non-legume species [19-24]. Also in
white lupin candidate genes and proteins associated with
antimicrobial defense and heavy-metal uptake have been
identified using genomic and proteomic approaches [25]
as have a large number of proteins, transcripts and microRNAs present in the phloem translocation stream [26].
For NLL, a limited number of ESTs and genomic
sequences have been submitted to the NCBI databases,
and a narrow-leafed lupin BAC library from cv Sonet has
been constructed with 6 × coverage of the genome [27].
Nevertheless, to facilitate the fast growing research activities in lupins, additional genomic and genetic resources
are needed. The genomic and genetic resources can also
benefit comparative genomic studies with other legumes.
BAC libraries and BAC-end sequences are valuable
resources, which have contributed significantly to genetic
and genomic studies of a wide range of model or economically important plant species (see review [12]). Using
BAC-end sequencing, a large number of SSR markers
have been identified which have in turn provided tools for
developing the genetic and physical maps of legumes such
as G. max, T. repens L, C. arietinum and C. cajan
[13,14,16,17,28-31]. BAC-end sequences have permitted
identification of macro- and micro-synteny between species and have provided accurate and cost-effective means

to estimate genome properties such as genome organisation and composition of some legume crops [17,30,32].
This study reports the construction and characterisation of a nuclear-genome BAC library of the NLL cv.
Tanjil. cv. Tanjil was one of the parents used for two
recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations that segregated for important domestication traits such as early
flowering, bitterness (alkaloid production), pod shattering, water permeability of seed and resistance to anthracnose [20,33-35]. These populations have been important
for development of molecular markers and genetic maps
for the species. Moreover, cv. Tanjil has been chosen as
the reference genome to be sequenced in a genome
sequencing project that commenced in 2011. The BAC
library for this cultivar was constructed using the BamHI
restriction enzyme and was successfully used to obtain
BAC clones containing different members of the major
seed storage protein, b-conglutin, family. In order to help
determine the structure and composition of the NLL
genome, 9600 randomly selected BAC clones were
sequenced generating 13985 BAC end-sequences (BESs).
Based on estimates that the genome size of NLL is 924
Mbp [36,37], these BESs covered approximately 1% of
the genome. The NLL BESs provided useful information
on the genome composition and organisation of the NLL
genome. We also used the BESs to identify 9966 SSR
motifs, some of which were shown to be potential molecular markers.

Results
Construction of a BAC library from NLL cv Tanjil

A NLL cv. Tanjil BAC library was constructed from
hydroponically grown seedlings using the BamH1 restriction enzyme. The library comprised of 111,360 BAC
clones which were stored in 292 384-well microtitre
plates. The average insert size of the library was approximately 99.7 kb based on the analysis of ca. 250 randomly
selected clones. Approximately 2% of the clones contained no insert while the majority (ca. 75%) had insert
sizes of between 90 kb and 110 kb, 12.5% above 110 kb,
9.2% between 80 kb and 90 kb, 3% between 50 kb and
80 kb and 0.3% smaller than 50 kb. The coverage of the
library was estimated to be around 12 haploid genome
equivalents according to the (haploid) genome size estimate of approximately 924 Mbp for NLL [36,37].
Screening the BAC library for b-conglutin containing
clones

To demonstrate the utility of the library, 111,360 BAC
clones which were double-spotted onto six nylon membrane filters using a robot were screened for NLL bconglutin genes using a cDNA fragment from a bconglutin gene (BETA2) as the probe [38]. This cDNA

probe cross-hybridised to the other six members of the
b-conglutin gene family due to the high level of homology among the gene sequences [38]. The screening permitted 108 positive clones to be identified. Twelve
clones were randomly selected and confirmed to contain
b-conglutin gene(s) by PCR with a pair of primers able
to recognise all seven b-conglutin gene members.

two bands from BACH, however sequence data showed
that they both contained BETA5 sequences, indicating a
PCR aberration. BETA1 primers identified a product
with sequence identity to BETA1 except there was an
extra 111 bp, presumably an intron within BETA1.
Apart from BACF, which contained BETA1 and BETA8,
each BAC clone only contained one b-conglutin gene.

Characterisation of b-conglutin containing BAC clones

Predicting characteristics of the NLL genome from
bioinformatic analysis of a randomly sampled collection
of BAC-end sequences

For further analysis, eight of the BAC clones were analysed for the presence of specific b-conglutin genes by
PCR using primers and annealing temperatures specific
for each b-conglutin gene, followed by sequencing of
the PCR product. As shown in Figure 1, each of the
eight b-conglutin hybridising BAC clones contained bconglutin genes, including BETA1, BETA2, BETA4,
BETA5, and a new b-conglutin gene, recognised by
BETA2 primers, which has been renamed, BETA8. The
truncated sequences of the eight b-conglutin genes are
shown in Additional file 1. It is not clear why the
BETA5 primers recognised BETA1 sequences from
BACB but not from BACF. BETA5 primers detected

To provide insight into the sequence content and complexity of the NLL genome, we sequenced and analyzed
both ends of 9600 BAC clones randomly selected from the
library and generated a total of 17856 BAC-end sequences
(BESs). Among these sequences, 13895 BESs (77.8%) of
BAC-end sequences contained usable sequence data
(> 100 bp after trimming) with a total length of ca. 8.89
Mbp which covers 0.96% of the NLL genome. The average
length of the BESs was 683 bp with a maximum of 1112
bp and minimum of 101 bp. A total of 3961 of the BESs
were discarded, because sequences were too short

Figure 1 PCR products and sequencing analysis of eight b-conglutin cross hybridising clones. PCR products from eight BAC clones
(BACA, BACB, BACC, BACD, BACE, BACF, BACG, BACH) using specific BETA1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 primers and annealing temperatures [38], were
separated on an agarose gel using electrophoresis. The PCR products (boxed) were sequenced and the best aligned b-conglutin sequence is
numbered inside the box. 1 represents BETA1, 2 represents BETA2, 4 represents BETA4, 5 represents BETA5, 8 represents BETA8, and × represents
bands for which no useable sequence data was obtained.

(< 100 bp), matched to the vector, showed low complexity
or were identified as bacterial or organelle sequences.
Applying bioinformatic analyses to the 13985 highquality BESs permitted prediction of various characteristics of the whole NLL genome. The overall G:C content
of BESs was 39%. However, the G:C content within predicted gene-coding regions was higher at 45%. Within
the 8.89 Mbp of BES sequence data, a total of 7014
repeats were identified representing 16.7% of the genome. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were
the most abundant class of transposable elements, constituting 10.26% of the genome (Table 1). The most
abundant LTR retroelements were Ty1/Copia-like
repeats (6.14% of the genome), followed by Gypsy/
DIRS1-like repeats (4.08%). Other repeats, including 461
simple repeats (0.28%), 3391 low complexity repeats
(1.82%), 182 DNA transposons (0.46%) and 422 rDNA
repeats (2.75%) were also identified.
To estimate the protein-encoding gene content of the
NLL genome, the 13895 BESs were compared to the
NCBI NR protein database by BLASTx. Protein-matching regions were found in 2667 BESs, 1723 of which
also contained matches to known repetitive DNA
sequences. Putative gene-encoding regions totalled
483,216 bp, equivalent to 5.4% of the total BES dataset.
Based on this value and an estimated average gene
length of 956 bp in legume species and 1170 bp over all
plant species (source: http://www.phytozome.net) the
NLL genome was predicted to contain between 42656

and 52204 genes. Blast2GO assigned 12831 Gene Ontology (GO) terms to 2930 BESs (Figure 2, Additional files
2 and 3). GO annotations were converted to 5448
FunCAT annotations assigned to 2067 BESs (Additional
file 4).
Functional analysis of the encoded genes in the 13985
BESs predicted high proportions of the NLL gene content
involved in the cell cycle and DNA processing (16.42%),
protein binding (15.02%), protein folding and modification (5.75%), organelle proteins (4.76%) and metabolism
(3.82%) (Additional files 5 and 6). A summary of gene
ontology revealed a relatively higher proportion within
the NLL BESs of genes associated with DNA metabolism,
proteolysis, auxin biosynthesis, cellular processes, primary metabolism, oxidation and reduction and serine
family amino acid metabolism (Figure 2). Conversely,
there was a relative scarcity in the BESs of genes involved
in organ formation, signal transduction, transmembrane
transport, gluconeogenesis, alkaloid biosynthesis, starch
and sucrose metabolism and defense/stress responses
(Figure 2).
Comparative genomics between NLL and other plant
species

To examine the phylogenetic relationship between NLL
and sequenced species, the 13895 quality-screened BESs
were aligned (via BLASTn) to the NCBI Nucleotide database and the probable phylogenetic distribution of these
hits was visualised with MEGAN [39,40] (Figure 3).

Figure 2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scatter-plots (generated via REViGO [60]) of the abundance of gene ontology (GO) terms
related to biological processes. GO terms are represented by circles. Circles representing similar GO terms are clustered closer together than
circles representing un-related GO terms. The sizes (large = high, small = low) and colours (red = high, green = moderate, blue = low) of circles
are proportional to the numbers of functional annotations (GO terms) predicted in the BAC-end sequences of Lupinus angustifolius. GO terms
representative of clusters of circles with high or low abundance have been labelled where appropriate.

MEGAN indicated the level of species similarity and
sequence conservation within the randomly sampled BES
subset of the NLL genome. About 18.3% of BESs
matched sequences available in the NCBI Nucleotide
database, while 79.2% of BESs had no hits. This is due in
part to the relatively low number of sequences from
Lupinus and other closely related genera that are currently available. The majority (84%) of the matched BESs
were mapped to eudicotyledon species, 77.9% of which
were assigned to the species of the subfamily Papilionoideae (Leguminosae). The three sequenced leguminous
species, G. max, L. japonicus and M. truncatula, were
highly represented followed by the genera Lupinus and
Arachis. In contrast, there were only six NLL BESs that
were best aligned to Arabidopsis sequences and no BESs
specifically aligned to Oryza sativa. The average percent
identity of BLASTn alignments between NLL BESs and
G. max, M. truncatula and L. japonicus was 95.8%, 94.4%
and 90.6% respectively. However the average identity
restricted to predicted gene-encoded regions was 87.0%,
88.5% and 86.7% respectively. A small proportion of BESs

(ca. 0.7%) were aligned to proteobacteria, perhaps due to
the fact that the tissues for constructing the BAC library
were collected from lupin seedlings grown under nonsterile conditions.
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) profiling and SSR markers

To characterise NLL SSRs and compare them with those
from M. truncatula, G. max, L. japonicus, Arabidopsis
and O. sativa, SSRs were predicted using methods
described previously [41]. A total of 9966 NLL SSR
motifs were found in the 13895 BESs. Details of these
SSRs, including the repeat length, repeat motif, and
repeat period are presented in Additional file 7. The SSRs
were divided into two classes: class I (≥ 20 bp) and class
II (12-19 bp) [41]. The frequency of these SSR classes for
all six species is compared in Table 2. Consistent with
data for the other five species, class II SSRs in NLL were
the most abundant microsatellites, being ca. 50 fold
greater in frequency than class I SSRs. The individual frequencies of SSRs appeared to be lower in NLL than in
the other five species. Based on the 8.89 Mbp of sequence

the number of BESs with an assigned hit. Numbers next to circles indicate the number of BESs inclusively mapped to a taxon (includes counts

(an estimated 1% of the NLL genome) obtained from the
BES data, the average density for the class I (≥ 20 bp)
SSRs was approximately one SSR every 0.9 Kbp which is
slightly higher than one SSR every 0.6-0.7 Kbp for the
other five species. For the class II SSRs (12-19 bp), the
NLL SSRs appeared to be much less frequent and the
average distance between SSRs was over six times that of
soybean and three to four times that of the other four
species.
However, analysis of the relative frequency of individual
groups of SSRs with motif length 1-8 bp revealed some
major trends for all six species as well as some distinctions for NLL SSRs (Figure 4). While the di-nucleotide
SSRs in NLL were the most abundant of all the class I
SSRs (≥ 20 nt), in line with the other 5 species, the
mono- and octa-nucleotide SSRs showed higher representation and the tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide SSRs
lower representation in NLL than those in other species.
In contrast, the distribution of the relative abundance of
each repeat motif length of the class II SSRs (12-19 nt)

Page 8 of 15

in NLL appeared consistent with that in the other species. Penta-nucleotide SSRs were an exception, and were
relatively more abundant by about four times in NLL,
than those of the other species. In the combination of
both class I and class II SSRs, NLL appeared to have
higher abundance of mono-nucleotide SSRs and lower
abundance of tri- and tetra-nucleotide SSRs. In NLL,
most of the penta-nucleotide SSRs had short repeat
sequences and grouped into class II (12-19 bp).
To develop SSR markers for NLL, primer-pairs were
designed flanking 2023 SSRs using Primer3 [42] with
additional criteria described in the Materials and Methods. After taking repetitive sequences into account,
there were 1497 non-redundant SSR marker candidates
including 24 class I SSRs (≥ 20 bp) and 1455 class II
SSRs (12-19 bp). These SSRs and the details of their primers are shown in Additional file 8. Twenty four additional class I SSR markers were designed using less
stringent criteria (see Methods). The details of these 24
SSRs are shown in Additional file 9.

As expected the “wild” NLL line, P27255, was the
most divergent, with the three domesticated lines being
closely conserved (Table 3). Nine out of 24 markers
were polymorphic between the parents of the narrow
cross (cv Tanjil × cv Unicrop), whereas 14 markers were
polymorphic between the parents of the wide cross
(P27255 “wild” × 83A:476 “domestic”).

A subset of 24 Class I SSR primer pairs were used to
establish a high throughput genetic mapping procedure
for NLL, termed ‘multiplex-ready PCR’ (Hayden et al
2008), to determine the success rate of the identified SSRs
as polymorphic markers between the parents of two NLL
recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. One RIL population was a narrow cross (cv Tanjil × cv Unicrop) and the
other was a wide cross (P27255 “wild” × 83A:476 “domestic”) [20,33]. The number of alleles that the primers amplified and their lengths are presented in Table 3. Of the 24
primer pairs tested, 3 did not yield any amplicons and four
were monomorphic between all four NLL lines tested. The
remaining 17 markers yielded single amplicons corresponding to their expected sizes based on the BES data.
Two out of these 17 primer pairs also generated secondary
amplicons for all four NLL lines. Interestingly, the wild
NLL line P27255 had an additional two primer pairs that
yielded multiple amplicons, whereas the other three
domesticated NLL lines did not. Given that the BESs only
cover 8.89 Mbp of the NLL lupin genome, the amplification of multiple products by a given primer pair could not
be ruled out, but this appeared to be limited to only a few
primer pairs.

Discussion
A deep coverage and high quality BAC library was constructed for the NLL cultivar Tanjil, which is emerging as
the reference genome for this species. The cv. Tanjil BAC
library represents ca. 12 × haploid genome equivalents. It
complements the previous NLL BAC library constructed
using a different restriction enzyme (BamH1 vs HindIII)
and a different NLL genotype (cv. Sonet) [27]. The library
contains very low organelle contamination (0.02%). The
quality of the library described here has been verified
through the BAC-end sequencing of 9600 clones and the
successful screening of the library with a probe for the
NLL b-conglutin genes (Figure 1. 1). This NLL BAC
library together with the pre-existing BAC library will
help develop genetic and genomic tools for lupins and

identify useful lupin genes for crop improvement and in
relation to human health. Indeed, the screening of the
NLL BAC library has resulted in the identification of a
large number of BAC clones containing various types of
b-conglutin genes (Figure 1). The NLL b-conglutins are
potential lupin-specific allergens [38] and their further
characterisation will verify their structures and functions,
thereby ultimately helping reduce allergenicity problems,
potentially through a genetic engineering approach.
The BAC-end sequencing of 9600 randomly selected
BAC clones represents the initial phase of efforts to characterise the NLL genome. The BAC-end sequencing
represents a random sampling of ca. 1% of the NLL
genome. Therefore these BESs provide a preliminary
genome-wide survey and facilitate comparisons with wellcharacterised legume and closely related non-legume species. The G:C content of NLL (39%) is slightly higher than
estimates in related legume species: P. Sativum (37.7%),
G. max (36%), M. truncatula (34%), L. japonicus (36%)
and Trifolium pratense (34.2%) [41,43]. The BESs generated were sufficient to reconstruct and analyse the relative
proportions of major repeat families. Based on the BESs
obtained, the repetitive content in NLL is estimated to be
at least 16.6% of the genome, which is close to Lotus japonicus (ca. 19%) and much lower than those of M. truncatula (ca. 38%) [44], soybean (ca. 59%) [13] and pea (35% to
48%) [45]. However, with additional sequence data this
estimate will likely increase, as greater whole-genome coverage allows for de novo prediction of repetitive elements
novel to NLL. LTR-retrotransposons were found to be the
major component of repetitive DNA in NLL, similar to
most higher plants characterised to date [13,45-48]. It
appears that NLL has a relatively higher proportion of
Ty1/Copia than Gypsy/DIRS1 repeat elements compared
to soybean and pea [13,45], possibly reflecting a distinct
evolutionary history specific to lupins and/or the genistoid
clade.
The de novo sequencing of the NLL cv. Tanjil genome
is underway and will involve sequencing 100 bp Illumina
reads from a range of small (200 bp), medium (200-2000
bp) and large (5-40 kb) sized paired-end and matepaired libraries. In addition to providing an initial genome survey and contributing new polymorphic markers,
the BES dataset can be combined with these next-generation reads in the final genome assembly to connect
scaffolds together across large assembly gaps. Where
necessary, the BESs will also facilitate sequencing across
gaps between scaffolds, as BAC clones corresponding to
a BES in the vicinity of a gap can be isolated and
sequenced individually.
The BESs described here are already being used to
support the genome-wide identification of polymorphic
genetic markers, such as SSRs with a total of 9966 SSR
motifs identified. The analysis of the SSR profiles

Page 10 of 15

suggested some degree of consistency in the relative
abundances of SSRs in NLL and other more characterised species (Figure 4). For example, consistent with
M. truncatula, L. japonicus, G. max, O. sativa and Arabidopsis, class I di-nucleotide SSRs and class II hexanucleotide SSRs were the most abundant [41]. However,
in NLL, the class I octa-nucleotide SSRs were also relatively overrepresented and penta-nucleotide SSRs were
underrepresented. Conversely class II penta-nucleotide
SSRs were relatively overrepresented and tri-nucleotide
SSRs were underrepresented in NLL. The divergence of
SSR abundance has also been documented for other
types of SSRs [49,50].
The average density for the class I SSRs was approximately one SSR every 0.9 Kbp which is comparable to
one SSR every 0.6-0.7 Kbp for the other five species compared. The average density for the class II SSRs however,
was significantly less frequent (one every 51.0 Kbp) compared to the other five plant species (7.8-18.4 Kbp). This
could be due to the relatively small NLL sample size or
alternatively, the result may reflect the distinct phylogenetic placement of NLL compared to the other species.
Class I SSRs, which have longer repeat sequences and/
or higher number of repeat units, are generally more
mutable and thus more likely to be polymorphic between
species than the SSRs with shorter repeat sequences and/
or lower number of repeat units [51,52]. Forty eight candidate class I SSR markers were identified and 24 of
these were initially screened for polymorphism between
the parents of two RIL populations yielding nine and 14
novel SSR markers for the cv. Tanjil × cv. Unicrop and
“wild” × “domestic” RIL populations, respectively. The
degree of polymorphism in the initial set of class I SSRs
between these four NLL lines shows that this is an effective way to identify and develop novel molecular markers.
The majority of existing markers developed in NLL are
AFLPs, MFLPs and RFLPs [19]. Besides these markers,
212 polymorphic PCR based markers are currently available in NLL and of these 212 PCR based markers, 39 are
SSR markers [19,20]. None of the 212 PCR-based markers produced amplicons within the BESs presented in
this publication by in silico PCR (amplicon size range of
20 bp to 10000 bp) [53]. The SSR markers presented in
this study are therefore novel and are specific to regions
of the NLL genome which have not been previously used
for primer-based marker design. SSR markers are valuable tools that can be applied to the study of genetic
diversity within collections, for example of Lupinus species and between cultivars [50] as well as refining existing
genetic maps using high-throughput “multiplex-ready
PCR”, which has now been established for NLL. The SSR
markers are also potentially useful for marker-assisted
breeding across Lupinus species and other related
species.

Phylogenetic analysis of the NLL BESs indicated only a
small proportion (18.3%) of NLL BESs matched to the
NCBI Nucleotide database and the majority (84%) of
these were assigned to the species of the subfamily Papilionoideae of the Leguminosae. A large proportion of
BESs (ca. 79.2%) did not match to any available legume
nucleotide sequences despite almost full genome
sequences being available for three species (M. truncatula, L. japonicus and G. max). This result suggests that
there is significant genomic disparity between the Genistoid clade and other clades of the Papilionoideae subfamily. This further illustrates how selective sequencing of
certain taxons can create biases in bioinformatic analysis
and highlights the importance of exploring the NLL genome and the development of its genomic resources. The
NLL BESs generated in this study represent the first genome-wide dataset for the genus Lupinus and provide an
excellent foundation to further understand the evolution
of the Leguminosae family.

Conclusions
NLL is emerging as an important crop for agriculture and
human health. As genetic and genomic studies in NLL
within the genus Lupinus have been limited, the BAC
library, the BAC-end sequences, and the SSRs markers
described in this study are additional genomic resources
for the species. These resources are critical for the construction of high-density physical and genetic maps and
are valuable resources for map-based cloning and functional analysis of traits in lupin. They will greatly facilitate development of molecular and genetic tools for
identifying and characterising genes involved in lupin
crop improvement and in exploiting the crop for human
nutrition. In addition, these resources provide a framework for further comparative genomics between lupins
and other legumes and ongoing efforts towards assembling the complete NLL genome using next-generation
sequencing.
Methods
Plant material

For the construction of the BAC library, seeds of Lupinus
angustifolius L., narrow-leafed lupin (NLL), cv. Tanjil
were germinated on moisturised filter paper at room
temperature for two days. Seeds were subsequently
grown hydroponically in half-strength Hoagland solution
in a growth room at 22°C over a 16 h/8 h day/night schedule. After ten days, leaves were collected, frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
For the Multiplex-Ready PCR assays to determine SSR
lengths in four NLL lines, seeds of cv. Tanjil, cv. Unicrop, 83A:476 (“domestic”) and P27255 (“wild”) were
germinated on moisturised filter paper at room temperature for two days. Subsequently, the germinated

Page 11 of 15

seeds were transferred into pots and grown in a temperature controlled growth chamber over 16 h/8 h day/
night schedule, using fluorescent light at 100 to 120 μE
m-2 s-1 and a constant temperature of 22°C. Leaf material was harvested from two-week-old plants for DNA
isolation.
Construction of the BAC library

BAC library construction was performed at the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics, University of
Adelaide, South Australia. The procedure has been
described in detail in Shi et al. [54] and high-molecular
weight DNA preparations were generated according to
Zhang et al. [55]. Leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and the powder combined with homogenisation
buffer. The homogenised sample was mixed with an
equal volume of pre-warmed 1% low melting point
(LMP) agarose and cast into plugs using plug molds
(Bio-Rad). Following lysis, the agarose plugs were cut
and digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI. The
DNA slices were size fractionated using a CHEF Mapper
XA pulse-Field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) system (BioRad), for 18 h at 11°C and 6 V/cm, using a 1-40 s pulse
time and 120° field angle.
The 100-250 kb DNA fractions were excised and the
DNA eluted in a Bio-Rad electro-eluter (Model 422),
applying 10 mA per tube. Size-fractionated DNA was
ligated to BamHI Cloning-Ready pIndigoBAC-5 vector
DNA (Epicenter) and transformed into ElectroMAX
E. coli DH10B competent cells (Invitrogen). The transformation was carried out using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser
Xcell and a cuvette with a 1 mm gap at 1800 volts (BioRad). Transformed cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h
in 1 mL LB, plated on to LB agar medium containing
12.5 μg/mL chloramphenicol and grown overnight at
37°C. Colonies were picked into wells of 384-well plates
containing 70 μL LB freezing medium using a VersArray
Colony Picker and Array System robot (Bio-Rad). Plates
were incubated overnight at 37°C and used to make three
copies of the library. Libraries were stored at -80°C. To
print filters for hybridisation screening, clones from one
copy of the library were arrayed in duplicate onto 22 cm
× 22 cm positively charged nylon membranes (Amersham Hybond-N+ from GE Healthcare, or Performa II
from Genetix) using a Qpix2 robot (Genetix). The three
copies of the library were later transferred to and stored
at CSIRO, Floreat, Western Australia.
Individual BAC clones were grown overnight at 37°C
with vigorous shaking in 5-10 mL LB containing
12.5 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and the cultures were
used to prepare BAC DNA by alkaline lysis. DNA of
each clone was digested with 0.2 unit NotI restriction
enzyme (New England BioLabs) and subjected to PFGE
in 1% agarose gels and 1 × TAE buffer, for 18 h at 11°C

Gao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:521
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/521

and 6 V/cm, using a 1-40 s pulse time and 120° field
angle. Fragments were photographed under UV light
after ethidium bromide staining and insert sizes estimated by comparison to a Lambda Ladder PFG Marker
(New England BioLabs).
BAC library screening

A cDNA probe from the NLL b-conglutin gene (Beta2;
[38]) was used for screening the BAC library. The probe
was derived from the plasmid DNA containing the cDNA
fragment of NLL Beta2 by PCR using M13 forward
(5’-GTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3’) and reverse (5’CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3’) primers. After purification with the Wizard SV 96 PCR Clean-up System (Promega), about 600 ng of the PCR product was labelled with
[a-32P]-dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labelling beads
(-dCTP) (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) following the supplier’s protocol. After incubating for 30 min
at 37°C, the unincorporated nucleotides were removed
using Illutra ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (GE
Healthcare).
Hybridisation was carried out at 68°C for 2 hr in
ExpressHyb Hybridisation Solution (Clontech) following
the supplier’s protocol. The membranes were washed in
2 × SSC for 30 min and 1 × SSC for 1.5 hours. Subsequently, the membranes were exposed to an Imaging
Screen K (Bio-Rad) for 30 min and the images captured
using the Molecular Imager FX System and Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad).
Characterisation of BAC clones

Twelve clones were randomly selected from those which
showed strong hybridisation signals. These clones were
used in PCR reactions with a pair of primers designed
from the conserved regions of the EST sequences of the
seven b-conglutin genes [38]. The primer sequences
were: forward 5’-TCCTCGTTGTACTCAATGGT-3’ and
reverse 5’-GGTTAAGGATATAAGAAGT-3’ and the
presence of b-conglutin sequences confirmed.
Eight BAC clones were selected for further characterisation. PCR reactions using primers specific for each b-conglutin gene and annealing temperatures (as described in
[38]) were carried out with each BAC clone. PCR products
were separated by gel electrophoresis and reactions which
yielded a band sequenced using the PCR reaction primers.
Where two bands were seen from one PCR reaction, each
band was excised and purified from the agarose gel using
the Qiaquick Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Retrieved sequence data was used to identify
the best aligned NLL b-conglutin by BLAST analysis.
BAC-end sequencing

The BAC-end sequencing was carried out by the Istituto di Genomica Applicata, Italy. BAC DNA was

Page 12 of 15

prepared from randomly selected clones using the MultiScreen Plasmid384 Miniprep Clearing plates (Millipore) coupled with a Biomek FX robot (Beckman).
Sequencing of BAC-ends used an ABI3730xl platform
(Applied Biosystems) with M13 forward and M13
reverse primers with Big-Dye Terminator chemistry
(Applied Biosystems).
Sequence cleaning and trimming

BAC-end sequences (BESs) were trimmed and filtered for
quality and sequence contamination using seqclean
(http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/), which had
been modified to use the same BLAST parameters as
NCBI VecScreen (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.html). BESs were screened against contaminant databases including the UniVec vector database
(Build #5.2 - Dec 7, 2009, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/UniVec), E. coli BL21 (DE3) complete genome sequence
[NCBI NUC: CP001665.1] and plant organelle genomes
(all NCBI mitochondrial, chloroplast and plastid genome
sequences under the taxon “Eudicotyledons”, [NCBI taxid:
71240]).
Estimation of genome statistics, gene content and
function

G:C content of BESs was calculated using custom perl
scripts. Repetitive DNA content was estimated using
RepeatMasker (version 3.2.9, http://www.repeatmasker.
org) [56], with the REPBASE repeat database (version
20090604) [57]. RepeatMasker parameters were set to
slow/sensitive alignment and restricted REPBASE entries
to those of species within the taxon “Eudicotyledons”
[NCBI taxid: 71240].
Trimmed NLL BESs were compared to the NCBI NR
protein database by BLASTx [58]. BESs regions matching NCBI NR proteins and not matching to RepBase
repeats [57] were assumed to contain protein-encoding
genes. The proportion of filtered BLASTx-aligned BES
regions relative to total BES sequence was used to estimate the percent of the NLL genome containing endogenous protein-encoding genes.
The functional content of the genome was estimated by
running the 13985 trimmed BESs through the Blast2GO
pipeline using default settings, blastx alignment to NR and
ANNEX augmentation [59]. Gene Ontology summary
PCA plots were generated via ReviGO [60]. REVIGO analysis focussed on functional annotations within the Lupinus angustifolius BES dataset only and did not involve
multiple species comparisons. Assigned GOs were summarised via the ‘plant’ GOSlim subset (http://www.geneontology.org/GO_slims/goslim_plant.obo). Unfiltered
GO terms were also summarised by conversion to MIPS
FunCAT terms (http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/mips2go).

Comparative genomics between NLL and other legumes

BESs were aligned via BLASTn [39] to the NCBI
Nucleotide database. Phylogenetic distribution BLAST
hits was visualised with MEGAN according to the lowest common ancestor of BLASTn BES hits [40]. The
phylogenetic relationships in the cladogram presented in
Figure 3 were derived from the NCBI taxonomy
database.
Screening of BES regions against published markers

Previous studies had published a total of 1104 markers
used for the genetic mapping of NLL (summarised in
Additional File 10). Of these 892 were PCR primer-based,
comprising 74 AFLP, 646 MFLP, 159 RFLP, 6 isosyme and
7 phenotypic markers. The remaining 212 were tested for
PCR amplification of BES sequence regions in-silico
between a range of 20 to 10000 bp [53].

Page 13 of 15

reverse primer for 24 class I primer pairs were synthesised
with the added nucleotide sequence 5’-ACGACGTTGTAAAA-3’ and 5’-CATTAAGTTCCCATTA-3’ respectively and called “locus specific primers”. A list of the 24
class I SSR primer sequences is presented in Additional
file 11. Two generic tag primers, tagF and tagR with the
sequences 5’-ACGACGTTGTAAAA-3’ and 5’ CATTAAGTTCCCATTA 3’, respectively, were also synthesised. The tagF primer was labelled at its 5’-end with one
of the fluorescent dyes: VIC, FAM, NED and PET
(Applied Biosystems). Multiplex-ready PCRs were subsequently carried out as described by Hayden et al. [64]. The
multiplexed SSR PCR products were subjected to fragment
analysis on an ABI3730 DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems) according to Hayden et al. [64] and SSR allele sizing
used the Genemarker software (SoftGenetics LLC).

Additional material
Identification of SSRs and design of SSR-flanking primers

For the purposes of comparison with previous studies of
SSRs in legumes, NLL SSRs were predicted via tandem
repeats finder [61] according to the criteria outlined by
Mun et al. [41]. SSRs were required to have a total length
of ≥ 12 bp, SSR unit length ≥ 1-8 bp and 100% identical
repetition of the SSR unit. Predicted SSRs were also distinguished into two classes according to total SSR length as
per Mun et al. [41]: class I: SSR length ≥ 20 bp, class II:
12-19 bp. For the purpose of polymorphic marker discovery, additional Class I SSRs were predicted using less stringent criteria: allowing for a SSR unit size of 2-5 bp, a
minimum of 75% identity to the SSR unit and a minimum
number of five repetitions.
SSR-flanking primers were designed using primer3 [42].
Primer design was optimised for pairs producing 250 bp
amplicons, primer lengths of 22 bp, melting temperatures
(Tm) of 60°C, maximum difference in forward and reverse
Tm of 1°C, maximum allowable primer hairpin lengths of
3 bp and maximum primer mononucleotide repeats of
2 bp. BESs were screened for potential repetitive DNA and
organelle genome sequence contamination via sensitive
RepeatMasker alignment to the Eudicotyledon subset of
RepBase and BLASTn match (e-value < 1e-20) to NCBI
Eudicotyledon organelle sequences. BAC-end sequences
were also assembled via Cap3 [62] to identify potentially
repeated regions (i.e. multi-gene families/uncharacterised
repeats). Primer pairs designed within “repetitive” BESs
were excluded from consideration as SSR marker
candidates.

Authors’ contributions
LLG was involved in the construction, characterisation and screening of the
BAC library and BAC-end sequencing. JKH carried out the bioinformatic
analysis of BESs and designed the SSR markers. LGK set up the multiplexready PCR technique and tested the SSR markers. RF was involved in the
isolation, sequencing and analysis of the β-conglutin clones. BJS was
involved in the construction of the BAC library. KBS, CAA and LLG helped
design the study. LLG drafted the manuscript with help from JKH, LGK, RF
and KBS and all authors discussed results, commented on and approved the
final manuscript.
