Abstract
The EMBnet Conference 2008, focusing on 'Leading Applications and Technologies in
Bioinformatics', was organized by the European Molecular Biology network (EMBnet) to celebrate
its 20th anniversary. Since its foundation in 1988, EMBnet has been working to promote
collaborative development of bioinformatics services and tools to serve the European community
of molecular biology laboratories. This conference was the first meeting organized by the network
that was open to the international scientific community outside EMBnet. The conference covered
a broad range of research topics in bioinformatics with a main focus on new achievements and
trends in emerging technologies supporting genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics analyses
such as high-throughput sequencing and data managing, text and data-mining, ontologies and Grid
technologies. Papers selected for publication, in this supplement to BMC Bioinformatics, cover a
broad range of the topics treated, providing also an overview of the main bioinformatics research
fields that the EMBnet community is involved in.

EMBnet history, mission and activities
EMBnet was established in 1988 as an initiative of the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) [1]. At
that time, high-speed data communication across Europe
as well as bioinformatics were in their infancy. The EMBL
was accumulating an ever-growing quantity of sequence

data and both the molecular biology and the biotechnology research communities needed to have an easy and fast
access to those data. Accessing a remote computer using
an ordinary command-line oriented terminal was not
enough. The solution for eliminating communication
delays could only be found in a distribution of data and

computer resources across a number of European nodal
centres each one serving its own local research community. The first practical steps were taken by EMBL in the
spring of 1988 after getting a positive feedback from scientists around Europe. This idea found the acceptance of
most representative computer and research centres, at that
time, dealing with molecular data management and analysis. A common agreement was reached in constituting
the European Molecular Biology network, the EMBnet [2].
In July 1988, the first EMBnet Workshop was organized at
EMBL with participants from EMBL, Daresbury (UK),
CITI2 (France), CAOS/CAMM Centre (the Netherlands)
and Hoffmann-La Roche. An early focus was on network
protocols for the distribution of data from the EMBL Data
Library. At first DECNET was intended as the data carrier
but it was soon replaced by TCP/IP. A set of client-server
data transfer programs, xNDT, was later developed at the
Swedish node. Another important issue in the agenda was
to apply for a grant for a pilot EMBnet project to the European Community.
In November 1988, a letter was sent from the EMBL Director General to all EMBL Council members asking them to
stimulate processes in their regions to identify regional
EMBnet nodes. As a proof of the urgent need, at the
EMBnet Workshop in May 1989, organized at the EMBL,
all 14 EMBL member states and established national
nodes were represented, including France, Sweden, the
UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Norway, Italy and
Denmark. Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Greece
and Finland were gearing up. In 1991, EMBnet received its
first grant from the European Community within its
framework BRIDGE (Biotechnology Research for Innovation, Development and Growth in Europe 1990–1994).
The major objective of the project was essentially the promotion of EMBnet as a European computer network for
bioinformatics. The main topics for the development of
the network were essentially three: a) the setting up of a
bulletin board, b) the study and development of the technical tools for data distribution and c) the planning of
specialised courses and workshops.
A Steering Committee (SC) was nominated during the
business meeting held in Nijmegen (NL) in July 1992, the
role of which was to promote new projects and to stimulate inter-node cooperation. This and subsequent grants
have been important for the successful growth of EMBnet.
The initially intended goal of EMBnet was fulfilled. During its first 8 years, the national nodes were the centres
where researchers in each European country could access
bioinformatics data that were kept in perfect synchrony
with the central data repositories at EMBL and its corresponding agencies NCBI at NIH in the USA and DDBJ in
Japan.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S1

In 1996, EMBnet was already composed of 26 nodes
throughout Europe with a consolidated background in
spreading data, computer resources and teaching/training
activities serving its research community [3]. The hot
topic, at that time, was no more how to distribute data
and resources but how to cope with the problem of
exploiting, in the best way the huge amount of biological
and molecular data collected in primary and specialized
databases. There was a great need to link these databases
for data integration. The first initiatives in this direction
were taken by the NCBI with the development of the Entrez software [4] and by the EMBL in Heidelberg with the
development of the SRS (Sequence Retrieval System) software by Thure Etzold [5]. The EMBnet community developed for this system a WWW interface which was installed
at each node and which is still one of the most used services by the EMBnet research community [6]. Along with
the development of the SRS WWW interface, many others
successful initiatives were accomplished. In the year 2000
EMBnet was the promoter in the creation of the peer
reviewed journal Briefings in Bioinformatics (BiB). BiB was
also supported by an educational grant from EMBnet.
The role of EMBnet as a provider of bioinformatics services and expertise for a large community of researchers is
underlined by a large series of success stories. With this
mission EMBnet has supported the growth of bioinformatics and computational biology in many countries, aiding at the implementation of bioinformatics
infrastructures and in the development and usage of the
most advanced bioinformatics tools and resources. From
very early on, EMBnet has promoted the development of
distributed computing services such as HASSLE [7], SRSfed [8] and MRSfed [9] to share workload among international servers and also contributed to the development
and maintenance of advanced database systems (Bioimage [10], CpGisle [11], CLEANUP [12], Webin & Seqin
[13], GQserv [14], PRINTS [15], InterPro [16], STACKdb
[17], UniProt [18], MNyHITS [19], ENSEMBL [20], MitoDrome [21], YeastBASE [22], MRS [23], MitoRes [24],
p53FamTag [25], engineDB [26]). EMBnet is also committed to bringing the latest software algorithms to the
user, free of charge (EGCG [27], Pratt [28], GeneDoc [29])
and continues to develop state of the art public software
such as EMBOSS [30] and powerful, easy to use intuitive
interfaces (CINEMA [31], W2H [32], GeneDoc [29],
WWW2GCG [33], Jalview [34], wEMBOSS [35], Jemboss
[36], STACKpack [17], EMBOSSrunner [37], eBiotools
[38], WebLab [39], UTOPIA [40]).
EMBnet has provided major contributions to supercomputing as a means to deliver more powerful and advanced
services (Bioccelerator [41], MPSRCH [42], INSECTS and
MOLLUSCS [43]) and pioneered the use of Grid technologies for Life Sciences. It has been involved in seminal

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 6):S1

European Grid projects such as SweGrid [44], EGEE [45],
EMBRACE [46], HealthGrid [47], Bioinfogrid [48], and
has also developed the first complete e-learning system
for teaching bioinformatics (EMBER [49]). Recently a
web-based e-learning system [50] has been added to its
list of services. The new system is based on the Moodle
[51] software with a few plug-in extensions and provides
facilities to support on-site training. The e-Learning server
is offered as a community service providing training material and experience for end-users, such as bioinformaticians, teachers and researchers. To facilitate sharing/
exchange of teaching material, the e-learning web site also
provides an exchange service, where the community may
share documents, presentations and experiences in bioinformatics training.
Attracted by the high level support of EMBnet, many
countries from Asia, Africa and America have joined
EMBnet within the last few years, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Kenya and Costa Rica. Any research group willing to
take over a certain level of support, or already offering
support to a regional community providing tools and
databanks in bioinformatics, or which is proficient in the
development of such tools or databanks, can apply for the
status of National or Associated (Specialist or Industrial)
EMBnet node. This has allowed EMBnet to expand well
beyond the European frontiers. Currently EMBnet bridges
cooperation among 39 member nodes extending to over
31 countries all over the World and reaching thousands of
users. In addition, EMBnet also maintains a fruitful cooperation with the Iberoamerican (RIBIO) [52] and the Asia
Pacific (APBioNet) [53] bioinformatics networks as well
as with the US based International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) [54]. Close contacts have been
established some years ago with the African Society for
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ASBCB) [55]
and fruitful cooperation with other scientific groups in
northern Africa are on their way to be realized.
National EMBnet nodes provide local training and support programmes in local languages and also provide their
national scientific communities with access to high performance computing resources, specialized databanks
and up-to-date software. Some nodes act as redistribution
centres to national research institutes and collaborative
technical expertise within EMBnet provides support for
sustaining the bio-computing facilities of the member
nodes.
The quarterly newsletter of EMBnet, the 'EMBnet.news'
[56], represents the main interface of the network to its
user community presenting reports about its internal
activities and latest achievements, together with technical
and scientific papers on new developments regarding bioinformatics, computational biology and bio-computing.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S1

The recent EMBnet.news issues have greatly increased in
size as well as in content, collecting contributions also
from their associated communities of partners in European and other national bioinformatics projects. The
number of issues downloaded per month amounts to
thousands of accesses; indicating a high interest in this
news letter outside the EMBnet community and in its role
as a reference point for the worldwide bioinformatics
community.

The EMBnet Conference 2008
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its activity, EMBnet
organized, in conjunction with the Annual General Meeting of the network, an international conference on bioinformatics and computational biology [57]. The
conference took place in Italy, at the Park Hotel San
Michele in Martina Franca (TA) from September 18th to
20th in 2008. The event, called 'Leading Applications and
Technologies in Bioinformatics', brought together more
than 120 scientists from all over the world to present and
discuss new technologies and instruments developed
across a vast range of research topics. In addition to the
major representation of EMBnet members, the conference
saw the contributions of many European researchers
(76%) as well as of researchers from America (11%), Asia
(8%), Africa (4%) and Australia (1%). Through this conference, EMBnet intended to give an opportunity for
aggregation of the worldwide scientific community
around the major themes at the frontiers of bio-computing and biological research. The scientific programme was
divided into four sessions and the themes covered were
'omics', as the most conventional up-to-date application
of bioinformatics and computational biology to Life Sciences research; advanced bioinformatics technologies and
applications, such as new technologies for high-throughput sequencing, data- and text-mining instruments for
biological research, ontologies, GRID technologies and
web services; biodiversity and metagenomics, giving an
insight into new trends of bioinformatics in these research
areas. Last but not least, a session on training and e-Learning in Bioinformatics was held, which covered the educational aspects within Bioinformatics to keep end users
updated with the latest developments implementing technologies for e-Learning and other instruments and to
share their 'pros and cons' amongst developers as well.
Presentations in this area were then the topics of an afternoon round table discussion during which many of the
instruments and experiences presented at the morning
conference session were demonstrated and further discussed.
The conference was opened by the conference chair
Domenica D'Elia, node manager of the Italian EMBnet
National node and representative of the hosting institute,
the CNR Institute for Biomedical Technologies in Bari.

The conference opening ceremony included the celebration of the EMBnet 20th anniversary with two presentations. Firstly Prof. Cecilia Saccone, as one of the first and
major promoters of EMBnet, reminded us about the
EMBnet history, its aim and missions. She explained that
the goals have not changed much since the 80's, apart
from an opening to the rest of the world. We should continue to expand the network, touch new fields for teaching
(interdisciplinary) and develop research. The second celebrative talk was presented by associate professor Erik
Bongcam-Rudloff (EMBnet chairman) who gave a
demonstrative view of the future of EMBnet with a shuffled movie to illustrate new challenges for bioinformatics
research that we are going to deal with, such as the huge
amount of data coming from high-throughput technologies and applications. He also initiated a discussion concerning a new name for EMBnet which should reflect the
evolution of the network from an European dimension to
the new worldwide expansion, also reflecting the links to
other collaborating networks such as RIBio, APBioNet and
ASBCB.
The scientific sessions of the conference were opened by
the keynote speakers Mehrdad Hajibabaei (Biodiversity
Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph Canada), Indra
Neil Sarkar (MBLWHOI Library, Marine Biological Laboratory, USA), Tin Wee Tan (Department of Biochemistry,
YLL School of Medicine, National University of Singapore), Alexander E. Kel (BIOBASE GmbH, Germany) and
Vincent Breton (Université Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand – France) and included 31 selected speakers among
the 76 who had submitted abstracts for presentation at the
conference. A complete report about the conference, by
the EMBnet Executive Board secretary Laurent Falquet, has
been published on EMBnet.news [58].
A tutorial on 'Grid Computing' was organized as a satellite
conference event on September 17th. The tutorial was
organized thanks to a joint effort of EMBnet and the LIBI
Italian FIRB project [59]. It was aimed at research students, post-docs, and senior researchers with an interest in
using or developing applications for distributed computing environments [60]. More than 30 participants and 12
teachers attended the tutorial. After an introductory talk
by Josè R. Valverde, from the Spanish EMBnet Node (Centro Nacional de Biotecnología in Madrid), the tutorial
focused on presentations, hands-on and demos on some
of the tools recently developed inside the LIBI project. Particular emphasis was given to the GRID Problem Solving
Environment developed and set up for the LIBI project,
the bioinformatics grid portals enabled with robot certificates, the LIBI federated databases approach and the tools
used for accessing it from a GRID environment. Some
examples of bioinformatics workflow executions on their
platform through high-level workflow management tools

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S1

like Taverna [61], were also presented. Articles from tutorial presentations have been published on the
EMBnet.news issue 14.4.
The conference programme, abstracts selected as oral and
poster presentations along with some informative articles
on EMBnet history and activities have been published in
the EMBnet.news issue 14.3.

Review policy
From the 76 abstracts submitted to the conference, 31
were selected for oral presentation. The remaining
selected abstracts were presented in poster conference sessions. Papers submitted to these proceedings were peerreviewed by at least two reviewers from the scientific committee board of the EMBnet Conference and by external
experts as required, in total 33 reviewers (see Additional
file 1). To manage the whole reviewing process we used a
fully automated on-line system, the Open Conference System from the Public Knowledge Project [62]. We received
29 full papers, however following our reviewing policy we
could accept only 24, selected on the basis of various criteria such as scientific and technical relevance as well as
novelty of the approach and relevance of results presented. This supplement to BMC Bioinformatics features
these 24 papers, which reflect the character of the conference and its focus on emerging research fields in bioinformatics and computational biology.

An overview of proceeding contents
Genomics data analysis
With multiple genome sequences publicly available, we
are now in the (post-) genomics era. The so called Next
generation (NextGen), rapid, low-cost sequencing techniques is making it possible to address a broad range of
genetic analysis applications including: comparative
genomics, high-throughput polymorphism detection,
analysis of transcriptional regulation, unraveling mutant
genes in diseases, and many other studies, only limited by
the researchers imagination.

Comparative genomics is a central step in many sequence
analysis studies and the annotation of whole genomes
through the identification of coding and regulatory
regions is one of the major challenges in the current
research in molecular biology. Creanza et al. [63] present
a statistical assessment of discriminative features for protein-coding and non coding cross-species conserved
sequence elements, comparing distributions of a set of
comparative and non comparative features and evaluating
the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained for discriminating sequence elements conserved among human,
mouse and rat species.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 6):S1

Penel et al. [64], developed an automated procedure
allowing massive all-against-all similarity searches, gene
clustering, multiple alignments computation, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction and reconciliation which led to
the production of three databases: HOVERGEN, HOGENOM and HOMOLENS.
Other example of new tools are represented by the work
of Sperber et al. [65], who created 'RetroTector' for the
study of retroviral elements in vertebrates; by the work of
Rubino and Attimonelli [66], who present a new algorithm for the classification of sequences based on regular
expression syntax; and by the work of Sebestyén et al. [67]
presenting DoOPSearch, a web-based tool using the comparative analysis of a large number of orthologous promoter regions to find common conserved motifs in the
promoter regions of different chordate and plants genes,
and to identify the overrepresented Gene Ontology terms
for functional gene correlations.
Calderon-Copete et al. [68] and Zhe Li et al. [69] give
examples of the broad spectrum of emerging new
genomes presenting works on Mycoplasma and plant
respectively.
Transcriptomics data analysis
The assessment of the functional aspects of time-course
transcriptomics data requires the use of approaches that
exploit the activation dynamics of the functional categories to where genes are annotated to. A new complex
approach in the evaluation of the expression data is presented by Nueda et al. [70]. In this work authors present
three new methods able to capture different aspects of the
relationship between genes, functions and coexpression
that are biologically meaningful. Another interesting
aspect of large-scale transcriptome data analysis is treated
by Picardi et al. [71] with EasyCluster, a new clustering
tool able to generate gene-oriented clusters of ESTs when
a genomic sequence and a pool of related expressed
sequences are provided.
Proteomics data analysis
Two key elements of omics are automatic data analysis
and data visualization. Moschopoulos et al. [72] present a
new clustering tool called GIBA and demonstrate how
combining existing methods, in this case clustering tools
used to analyze protein-protein interactions, can increase
the quality of the results. Tsagrasoulis et al. [73] describe
a visualization tool to compare two protein LC-MS datasets at a very detailed level; while Strömbergsson and Kleywegt [74] present a new computational approach to
visualize and compare chemogenomics protein-ligand
subspaces.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S1

Molecular biodiversity and DNA barcode
DNA sequences have become a primary source of information in biodiversity analysis. Singer and Hajibabaei
[75] present a web-based toolkit which allows the user to
manage their barcode datasets, pull out non-unique
sequences, identify haplotypes within a species, and
examine the within- to between-species divergences. In
addition, they provide a number of phylogenetics tools
that will allow the user to manipulate phylogenetic trees
generated by other popular programs.

A standardized and cost-effective molecular identification
system for Fungi is an urgent need owing to their wide
involvement in human life quality. However, mobile
introns in almost all the fungal mitochondrial genes represent a serious difficulty in PCR and bioinformatics surveys. Santamaria et al. [76] developed a query-based
approach searching in public databases for those mobile
introns and compare the results with a BLAST-based
approach.
Systems biology
The article from Gerdtzen et al. [77] presents a mathematical model based on the gene network involved in heterocyst differentiation and depicts a good attempt towards
the systems biology approach. Another valuable attempt
in this direction, i.e. the holistic understanding of biology,
is given by the article from Picard et al. [78], which
presents MixNet, a software that analyzes biological networks using mixture models.
Biological data integration
Integration of automatic prediction results and genomic
visualization for analysis of genome data is a big issue of
the post-genomic era. Barrio et al. [79] describe their work
on annotation and visualization of endogenous retroviral
sequences using the Distributed Annotation System
(DAS) and eBioX. Pettifer et al. [80] apply experience in
human-computer interaction (HCI), high-performance
rendering and distributed systems to build reusable software components that, together, create a toolkit that is
both architecturally sound from a computing point of
view, and addresses both user and developer requirements for large-scale analyses which require drawing
together data from a variety of geographically and structurally different databases.

Roubelakis et al. [81] present GOmir, a novel stand-alone
application consisting of two separate tools for the analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) target genes: JTarget and
TAGGO.
Grid technologies and web services
Two interesting pieces of work how the Grid technology is
used, are represented by the article from Barbera et al.

[82], describing the GENIUS Grid Portal and the robot
certificates; and by the article from Minervini et al. [83],
that describe massive non natural proteins structure prediction using the Grid. The former deals with the Grid
technology itself, whereas the latter presents an application.

Data and text mining
Data and text mining techniques represent two important
IT applications for biological knowledge discovery. Castellano et al. [84] developed a software middleware solution in order to exploit the many knowledge discovery
software applications on scalable and distributed computing systems, such as the GRID infrastructure, to tackle the
intensive use of information and communication
resources in Life Sciences. Lagani et al. [85] describe a new
kernel function consisting of a similarity measure
between groups of subjects genotyped for numerous
genetic loci. Turi et al. [86] present UTRminer, a new
application of data mining techniques for the discovery of
cis-regulatory modules controlling translation of mRNAs
targeting the mitochondrion.
