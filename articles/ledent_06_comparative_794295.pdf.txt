Abstract
Background: Histone deacetylases are enzymes that modify core histones and play key roles in
transcriptional regulation, chromatin assembly, DNA repair, and recombination in eukaryotes.
Three types of related histone deacetylases (classes 1, 2, and 4) are widely found in eukaryotes, and
structurally related proteins have also been found in some prokaryotes. Here we focus on the
evolutionary history of the class 4 histone deacetylase family.
Results: Through sequence similarity searches against sequenced genomes and expressed
sequence tag data, we identified members of the class 4 histone deacetylase family in 45 eukaryotic
and 37 eubacterial species representative of very distant evolutionary lineages. Multiple
phylogenetic analyses indicate that the phylogeny of these proteins is, in many respects, at odds
with the phylogeny of the species in which they are found. In addition, the eukaryotic members of
the class 4 histone deacetylase family clearly display an anomalous phyletic distribution.
Conclusion: The unexpected phylogenetic relationships within the class 4 histone deacetylase
family and the anomalous phyletic distribution of these proteins within eukaryotes might be
explained by two mechanisms: ancient gene duplication followed by differential gene losses and/or
horizontal gene transfer. We discuss both possibilities in this report, and suggest that the
evolutionary history of the class 4 histone deacetylase family may have been shaped by horizontal
gene transfers.

Background
In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into chromatin structures,
the basic unit of which is the nucleosome. Each nucleosome consists of about 148 bp of DNA tightly wrapped
around a histone-protein octamer containing two copies
each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 [1]. The packaging of DNA
restricts its accessibility to proteins such as transcription
factors, and therefore the transcriptional activation of

many genes requires chromatin modifications such as
reversible acetylation of the core histones [2]. The steadystate level of acetylation is controlled by the antagonistic
activities of two types of enzymes: histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs thus
play key roles in transcriptional regulation and also in
other cell processes that are influenced by the acetylation

state of core histones, such as chromatin assembly, DNA
repair, and recombination [3,4].
HDACs have additional activities that are not directed at
histones: many HDACs are partially found in the cytoplasm, and some have been shown to act on non-histone
substrates, such as the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin, and
the transcription factors p53 and YY1 [5-7]. Acetylation/
deacetylation might thus be a widespread type of posttranslational modification, acting in a manner similar to
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the regulation of
protein activity [8]. In addition, HDACs have recently
attracted considerable attention because chemical inhibitors of HDACs induce growth arrest, differentiation, and/
or apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and
may thus represent a new class of anti-tumor agents [4].
Recent phylogenetic studies [9] classify the non-sirtuin
HDACs into three families: the well-known class 1 (which
includes the human HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8), class 2
(including the human HDACs 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10), and an
additional class defined by the recently identified human
HDAC 11 [10]. This third class has been named class 4 to
distinguish it from the unrelated NAD-dependent class 3,
i.e. the sirtuin deacetylases related to the yeast Sir2 protein
[9]. Orthologues of the eukaryotic HDACs are found in
prokaryotes [9,11], and phylogenetic analyses indicate
that most of them can confidently be assigned to one or
another of the three classes distinguished among eukaryotic HDACs [9]. These prokaryotic proteins act biochemically on non-histone substrates and are usually labelled as
'acetoin utilization proteins' or 'acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases' with reference, respectively, to their involvement in the utilization of the carbon source acetoin or in
the deacetylation of polyamines such as spermine [11]. It
is known, however, that acetylpolyamine aminohydrolases share some important functional features with
eukaryotic histone deacetylases, as both: (i) recognize an
acetylated aminoalkyl group; (ii) catalyse the removal of
the acetyl group by cleaving an amide bond; and (iii)
increase the positive charge of the substrate [11].
In this study, we have identified, through similarity
searches against sequenced genomes and EST data, a very
large sampling of putative eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins belonging to the class 4 HDAC family. In the remainder of this paper we call these 'class 4 HDACs' on the sole
basis of their orthology to the characterized class 4
HDACs of metazoans, and irrespective of their actual
functional specificities, which have not been characterized. By means of multiple phylogenetic analyses, we
show that the class 4 HDACs display unexpected phylogenetic relationships, at odds with the phylogeny of the corresponding species. Some eukaryotic proteins appear
more closely related to eubacterial proteins than to those

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/24

of related eukaryotic species. We discuss the possibility
that this anomalous phyletic distribution might be the
consequence of multiple ancient horizontal gene transfers
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or alternatively, the
result of gene duplication and a high rate of differential
gene loss.

Results
Derivation of a comprehensive set of class 4 HDACs
In a survey of animal HDACs, we found by Blast BLAST
searches against the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) NR database that some animal class
4 HDACs are more similar to eubacterial HDACs than to
those of other eukaryotes. In order to conduct a phylogenetic analysis of these sequences on the largest possible
sampling of HDACs, we retrieved a large number of protein sequences of class 4 HDACs (HDAC11-related) by
means of BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database,
and also against various finished and unfinished genomes
and expressed sequence tag (EST) data. To ascertain that
the retrieved sequences were bona fide class 4 HDACs, we
used both the "reciprocal best BLAST hit" criterion and
phylogenetic analyses (as described under Methods and
in Additional File 1). We identified class 4 HDACs in 45
eukaryotic and 37 eubacterial species representative of
evolutionarily very distant lineages (Figures 1 and 2; Additional File 2). We failed to detect any class 4 HDAC in
some archaea, fungi, and apicomplexa (Plasmodium and
relatives). In the corresponding genomes, one or more
HDAC sequences were found but they belong to HDAC
class 1 and/or class 2 (not shown).
Phylogenetic analyses of the class 4 HDACs
We performed a multiple alignment of the retrieved class
4 HDACs of 82 different species and used this alignment
to construct phylogenetic trees. We then applied several
different phylogenetic methods (as described in the legend of Figure 1 and under Methods) to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the class 4 HDACs. We used
both statistical support (bootstrap values, quartet puzzling support values, and posterior marginal probabilities) and congruence between the different phylogenetic
methods as indicators of the reliability of the different
internal branches of the tree. Figure 1 summarizes these
results. The trees obtained by the different phylogenetic
methods can be found in the Additional Files 3, 4, 5).

We found two large well-supported monophyletic groups
(Figure 1; black circles). One group, which we named the
'eukaryotic group', includes only eukaryotic proteins of
animals (metazoa), land plants and a green alga
(viridiplantae), and ciliates (alveolata), i.e. of representatives of three of the main eukaryotic lineages [12]
(opisthokonta, plantae, and chromalveolata, respectively). The other group, called the 'mixed group', includes

Phylogenetic tree of the class 4 HDACs
Phylogenetic tree of the class 4 HDACs. The represented tree is a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree produced with PHYML
(using the WAG model of protein evolution). Rooting is arbitrary. Numbers above the internal branches are their bootstrap
support values (100 bootstrap replicates). Only bootstrap support values >50% are shown. Other internal branches (with
bootstrap support <50%) should be considered unreliable. In addition to the values shown for the other statistically supported
internal branches (ML WAG), some key internal branches are labelled with additional statistical support values obtained by
other methods of phylogenetic reconstruction or other models of evolution: bootstrap support in PHYML analysis with the
JTT model of evolution (ML JTT; 100 bootstrap replicates), ML quartet puzzling support (QP; 25,000 puzzling steps), bootstrap
support in neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis (BioNJ algorithm, 10,000 bootstrap replicates), bootstrap support in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis (heuristic search; 500 bootstrap replicates), and posterior probabilities (Bayesian inference, BI). More
details on the phylogenetic analyses can be found in the Methodssection and additional trees can be found in Additional Files 3,
4, 5. Eukaryotic lineages are marked by a bold "E". Colored circles highlight internal nodes defining monophyletic groups discussed in the main text. Black circles define two large groups: the "eukaryotic group" including proteins of species belonging to
three of the main eukaryotic lineages, namely the opisthokonta (metazoa), plantae (viridiplantae), and chromalveolata (alveolata), and the "mixed group" comprising proteins of species belonging to various eubacterial and eukaryotic lineages. The grey
circle denotes, inside the mixed group, a monophyletic group containing both eukaryotic and eubacterial sequences. The red
circle indicates a monophyletic group comprising class 4 HDACs of nine animals; these HDACs show closer resemblance to
eubacterial proteins than to those of other animals. The yellow circle defines a group comprising four HDACs of distantly
related eukaryotic planctonic species. The orange circle denotes a group comprising an HDAC sequence of the cnidarian
Nematostella vectensis and those of two unrelated eubacteria. The multiple alignment on which this tree is based is available as

Figure distribution of the eukaryotic class 4 HDACs
Phyletic 2
Phyletic distribution of the eukaryotic class 4 HDACs. Most of the species in which we sought class 4 HDACs are
shown, together with our current view of their phylogenetic relationships [12]. The nomenclature used for the phylogenetic
groups is according to Simpson and Roger [12] and the NCBI website. In each case in which the genome of a species has been
fully sequenced, we indicate the presence or absence of a "eukaryotic group" or "mixed group" class 4 HDAC. The # symbol
denotes species for which only EST data are available. In these cases, our failure to find a class 4 HDAC of one type of the
other does not mean that none exists. In the case of the fungi, we searched against the genomic data of all species available on
the NCBI website and failed to find a class 4 HDAC in any of them. 'Phytophthora sp' are Phytophthora sojae + Phytophthora ramorum; 'Plasmodium sp' are Plasmodium berghei + Plasmodium chabaudi + Plasmodium vivax + Plasmodium yoelii yoelii; 'Trypanosoma
sp' are Trypanosma cruzi + Trypanosma brucei.

proteins of representatives of various lineages, both
eubacterial and of eukaryotic: animals (metazoa,
opisthokonta), green algae (viridiplantae, plantae), a red
alga (rhodophyta, plantae), diatoms (stramenopiles,
chromalveolata), and a coccolithophore alga (haptophyceae, chromalveolata). This mixed group includes a wellsupported monophyletic group (Figure 1; grey circle)
comprising eukaryotic sequences and sequences from
cyanobacteria and proteobacteria.
The phylogeny of the class 4 HDACs appears, in many
respects, at odds with the phylogeny of the species in
which these proteins are found. In the mixed group, we
identified, for example, a monophyletic group of nine
animal proteins showing closer resemblance to eubacterial proteins than to those of other animals (Figure 1; red
circle). This group includes sequences belonging to representatives of several animal lineages: a cnidarian (Nematostella vectensis), two arthropods (Callinectes sapidus, a
crustacean, and Locusta migratoria, an insect), an annelid
(Platynereis dumerilii), an echinoderm (Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus), and four vertebrates (the teleost fishes Takifugu rubripes, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and
Pimephales promelas). Strikingly, the class 4 HDAC found
in these teleosts is only distantly related to that found in
another teleost fish, the zebrafish Danio rerio, and is more
closely related to eubacterial proteins (Figure 1). Similarly, one class 4 HDAC found in Locusta migratoria is
closer to those found in eubacteria than to those of other
insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis
melifera, and Tribolium castaneum) and to the second class
4 HDAC of Locusta migratoria. In the mixed group, we also
found class 4 HDACs in two green algae, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri (Figure 1), appearing
more similar to eubacterial class 4 HDACs than to those
of other viridiplantae, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza
sativa, or to the second class 4 HDAC of Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii. We further noted the existence of a monophyletic group including proteins of very distant eukaryotic species (Figure 1, yellow circle): the diatoms
Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum
(chromalveolata), the red alga Cyanidioschyon merolae, and
the green alga Ostreococcus tauri (plantae). The green alga
sequence is thus more closely related to those of the diatoms, which are evolutionarily quite distant, than to those
of any other viridiplantae. Finally, we found a monophyletic group comprising the second HDAC sequence
found in the genome of the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and the sequences of two distantly related eubacteria,
Cytophaga hutchinsonii (a Bacteroides species) and Psychrobacter cryhalolentis (a γ-proteobacterium) (Figure 1, orange
circle).
There is thus a clear incongruence between the HDAC protein tree and the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/24

species. We then looked more closely at the distribution
of class 4 HDACs in eukaryotes (Figure 2). Class 4 HDACs
are found in three of the main lineages of eukaryotes
(Chromalveolata, Plantae, and Opisthokonta) [12].
Inside each of these groups, some species possess proteins
belonging to the eukaryotic group and others display proteins of the mixed group, with a few species possessing
both types (Figure 2). The eukaryotic class 4 HDACs thus
clearly display an anomalous phyletic distribution, given
our current view of the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes.

Discussion
Two main mechanisms might account for the unexpected
phylogenetic relationships among class 4 HDACs and the
anomalous phyletic distribution of the eukaryotic ones:
(i) ancient gene duplication followed by differential gene
loss or (ii) horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Let us first examine the anomalous phyletic distribution
of some eukaryotic class 4 HDACs in the light of the 'gene
duplication-gene loss' hypothesis (Figure 3A). As both the
mixed-group type and the eukaryotic-group type occur
(often separately, sometimes together) in a wide range of
eukaryotes, the duplication event postulated to have given
rise to these two types of genes must have occurred early
in eukaryotic evolution. The presence of two types of class
4 HDACs would thus be the ancestral situation of most or
all eukaryotes. The punctate distribution we see today
would be due to loss, at a high rate, of one or the other
type of class 4 HDAC. As the mixed-group class 4 HDACs
of eukaryotes appear more closely related to eubacterial
HDACs than to the eukaryotic-group HDACs, we must
even consider the possibility that the duplication event
occurred before the eukaryotes and eubacteria diverged
(Figure 3A). The presence of two types of class 4 HDACs
would be the ancestral situation for both eubacteria and
eukaryotes. The transition to the present-day situation
would have involved not only a high rate of differential
gene loss in eukaryotes, but also the loss of one of the paralogues in eubacteria, probably at an early stage of eubacterial evolution.
One main problem with this view is that both types of
class 4 HDAC genes must have coexisted in the ancestors
of lineages (e.g. metazoans and viridiplantae) where some
descendants have one type of HDAC and other descendants have the other type. We would expect many of these
organisms to still possess both genes, but as a rule, this is
not so (Figure 2). We found both gene types in only three
eukaryotic species, as opposed to 37 species possessing
only one gene. As more genomes are sequenced, more will
probably be found to contain both genes, but the presence
of a single gene in most genomes studied to date does not
support the notion that the two categories of class 4
HDACs represent two paralogous groups that originated

early in eukaryotic evolution. In addition, the model of
ancient gene duplication followed by differential gene
loss fails to fully explain some of our observations, such
as the strongly supported separation of two diatom
HDACs, those of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, within the mixed group (Figure 1). Much
more complicated scenarios are therefore required, making this model less plausible and not especially parsimonious.

eukaryote-eukaryote and/or host-parasite gene transfer
[15,25-31]. The main criteria used in the aforementioned
publications to detect HGT are unexpected phyletic distribution, differential presence or absence in closely related
species,
and
incongruent
phylogenetic
trees
[15,16,23,32]. Our data meet all these criteria (see Figures
1 and 2), and are therefore very suggestive of the occurrence of HGTs having shaped the evolutionary history of
the class 4 HDACs.

The other main possibility is HGT, the transmission of
genetic material from one species to another (Figure 3B).
HGT is a widespread and important phenomenon in
prokaryotes. It is one of the driving forces of genome evolution in both archaea and eubacteria [13-18]. Over the
past few years, it has become increasingly clear that HGT
has had an impact on eukaryote evolution also, at least in
the case of unicellular and/or parasitic eukaryotes [19-24],
yet the occurrence and the importance of HGT in organisms such as land plants and animals is less obvious and
very controversial. Although claims have been made for
HGT in multicellular organisms, only very few cases have
been clearly demonstrated, and these mainly concern

Although our data do not allow a firm determination of
the direction of these putative HGTs (the identity of
donors and recipients remains unknown), we favour the
hypothesis that transfer occurred from prokaryotes to
eukaryotes, and that the eukaryotic-group members are
the 'original' eukaryotic HDACs and the mixed-group
members are the 'transferred' HDACS. In support of this
view, class 4 HDACs are found in many diverse eubacterial species representative of most major eubacterial lineages (Figure 1). To imagine that a class 4 HDAC was
present in early eubacterial evolution (and subsequently

prokaryotic class 4 HDACs were acquired from eukaryotes
by numerous independent HGTs.
An important feature of the putative prokaryote-eukaryote
HGTs is that most of them are probably ancient, as indicated by the species ranges covered by the monophyletic
groups distinguished among the mixed-group eukaryotic
HDACs (Figure 1). For example, the existence of the aforementioned monophyletic group comprising all nine
metazoan sequences indicates that the transferred gene
was already present in the last common ancestor of these
animals, i.e. in that of most or all animals. This means
that the recipient of the putative HGT was not a presentday complex metazoan but an ancient, probably much
more simple (maybe unicellular) ancestor. This is important, as gene transfers from prokaryotes to eukaryotes with
sequestered germ lines, such as most present-day animals,
appear to be very rare [23]; almost all other putative HGTs
we have detected concern unicellular eukaryotes. A possible exception concerns the second HDAC sequence found
in the genome of the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis,
which forms a monophyletic group with the sequences of
Cytophaga hutchinsonii and Psychrobacter cryhalolentis (Figure 1, orange circle). Although we cannot rule out contamination of the genomic data from which these
sequences were obtained, this might be indicative of a
much more recent HGT involving a complex multicellular
organism.
Besides these putative eubacterium-eukaryote transfers,
there is also the possibility of at least one eukaryoteeukaryote HGT. This is suggested by the existence of a
monophyletic group including very distant eukaryotic
species (Figure 1, yellow circle): the diatoms Thalassiosira
pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum (chromalveolata), the red alga Cyanidioschyon merolae, and the green
alga Ostreococcus tauri (plantae). The green alga sequence
is more closely related to those of the evolutionarily very
distant diatoms than to those of any other viridiplantae.
We suggest that this association may be the result of
eukaryote-eukaryote HGTs between these phytoplanctonic species.
Lastly, we note that in most lineages only a single HDAC
is found (Figures 1 and 2), yet two different proteins are
found in the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis,
and the green alga Ostreococcus tauri. In all these cases,
both proteins belong to the mixed group and are not
closely related, suggesting independent HGTs. The existence of eukaryotes with only mixed-group HDACs (and
thus lacking a eukaryotic-group member) suggests that
gene transfer was sometimes followed by functional
replacement of the 'original' eukaryotic gene by the transferred one. The only eukaryotes to possess both a mixed-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/24

group and a eukaryotic-group protein are the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and two animals (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Locusta migratoria) (Figures 1 and 2).
Similar multiple replacements have been reported for the
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1α [21]. Whether
these replacements are due solely to chance or have selective advantages [33] is an open question that awaits functional and biochemical characterization of the proteins
and still broader sampling of eukaryotic HDAC genes.

Conclusion
The results presented here shed new light on the evolutionary history of class 4 HDACs. These proteins display
unexpected phylogenetic relationships, at odds with the
phylogeny of the corresponding species, suggestive of
ancient horizontal gene transfers between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. This suggests that the evolution of important eukaryotic multigene families, such as the histone
deacetylase gene family, may have been shaped by horizontal gene transfers.

Methods
Class 4 HDAC sequences were retrieved through BLAST
searches [34] on protein and genome data, mainly from
the NCBI [35], the Doe JGI [36], the Sanger Institute [37],
the Baylor College of Medicine [38], the Genoscope [39],
and the TIGR [40] databases. To ascertain that we identified class 4 HDACs, we first used the 'reciprocal best
BLAST hit' criterion. We retained for each species only the
best BLAST hits, using known class 4 HDACs (of animals)
as queries. We then performed the reciprocal BLAST using
the obtained sequences as queries against the NCBI NR
database and verified that the class 4 HDACs initially used
in the first BLAST search are the best BLAST hits in the corresponding species. All class 4 HDACs identified are listed
in Additional File 2. As most of the identified sequences
come from EST data and unfinished genomes, we were
concerned about the possibility that some of them might
represent contamination of the genomic data. We list our
argument against this possibility in Additional File 6. In
order to detect potential bacterial contaminations, we also
performed an analysis of the codon usage of the HDAC
coding sequences compared to the corresponding
genomes. This analysis, which is shown in Additional
Files 6 and 7, does not show any evidence for contamination.
Multiple alignments were performed with Clustal W [41]
and subsequently manually improved. We performed two
types of alignments, class 4 HDACs with HDACs of other
classes and class 4 HDACs alone. The first type of alignment was used to verify the monophyly of the class 4
HDACs and thus to ascertain that we had identified bona
fide class 4 HDACs (see Additional File 1). The second
type of alignment was used to determine phylogenetic

relationships among class 4 HDACs. In establishing the
phylogeny of class 4 HDACs, we avoided using the first
type of alignment (with other HDCAs serving as outgoups) to prevent potential phylogenetic reconstruction
artefacts due to the presence of distant outliers (class 4
HDACs diverge considerably from other HDACs, not
shown) [42]. We used both a multiple alignment containing the whole protein sequences and a multiple alignment
containing only the regions with unequivocal alignment.
Both alignments gave the same tree topologies. The alignment of the whole proteins (used to produce the trees
shown in this paper) can be found in Additional File 8.
Unweighted maximum-parsimony (MP) and neighbourjoining (NJ) reconstructions were performed with the
PAUP 4.0 program [43]. MP analyses were performed
with the following settings: heuristic search of over 500
bootstrap replicates, MAXTREES set at 2000, and other
parameters set at default values. Maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses were performed with PHYML [44] and
TreePuzzle [45]. PHYML analyses were performed using
two different amino-acid substitution models, the JonesTaylor-Thornton (JTT) model [46] and the Whelan and
Goldman (WAG) model [47], the frequencies of amino
acids being estimated from the data set, and rate heterogeneity across sites being modelled by two rate categories
(one constant and eight γ rates). Statistical support for the
different internal branches was assessed by bootstrap resampling (100 bootstrap replicates), as implemented in
PHYML [44]. Bootstrap consensus trees were constructed
with the PAUP 4.0 program. Treepuzzle analyses were performed by means of the quartet puzzling tree search procedure, with 25,000 puzzling steps [45]. We used the
WAG model of substitution [47] and the frequencies of
amino acids being estimated from the data set, and
allowed rate heterogeneity across sites to be modelled by
two rate categories (one constant and eight γ rates) [45].
Bayesian inference was performed using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method as implemented in the MRBAYES
(version 3) package [48,49]. We used the WAG substitution frequency matrix [47] with among-sites rate variation
modelled by means of a discrete γ distribution with four
equally probable categories. Two independent Markov
chains were run, each containing 1,000,000 Monte Carlo
steps, after a burn-in of 400,000 steps. One out of every
100 trees was saved. For each run, we computed the
majority consensus of the obtained trees by means of the
PAUP 4.0 program. The same consensus tree was obtained
for both runs. Marginal probabilities at each node were
taken as a measure of statistical support. The discrepancy
between the estimated probabilities obtained in the two
runs was 5% on the average and never exceeded 11%. The
results obtained from the two runs are thus consistent, so
that we finally combined them by gathering the trees of
both samples.

Codon usage of 68 class 4 HDAC coding sequences with respect to the
corresponding genomes. Pearson's χ2 test was performed to measure the
goodness of fit between the observed codon usage distribution of 68 class
4 HDAC coding sequences and those expected for 69 different genomes.
Several applicability conditions were tested, in which a minimum of 0, 1,
2, and 5 codon occurrences was mandatory. The highest number of consistence between a given class 4 HDAC and its source genome is observed
for thresholds set to 0 or 1. During each test, stop codons were not taken
into account, and codons that did not fulfil the applicability conditions
were discarded from the analysis. A p-value was calculated for each Class
4 HDAC/genome tested. A p-value close to zero signals that the null
hypothesis is false, and typically that a difference is very likely to exist
between compared class 4 HDAC and genome codon usages. Large p-values closer to 1 imply that there is no detectable difference for the sample
size used. A "NA" label replaces the "source genome p-value" and p-value
ratio of class 4 HDACs for which there were no corresponding genome
codon usage table available and too few known coding sequences to derive
a significative codon usage table. The source genome table we took for the
Picea engelmannii HDAC is the available codon usage table of the closelyrelated species, Picea abies.
