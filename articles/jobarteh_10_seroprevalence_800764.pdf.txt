Abstract
Background: The prevalence of HIV/hepatitis co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa is not well documented, while
both HIV and HBV are endemic in this area.
Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of HBV and HCV virus in HIV-infected subjects
in the Gambia.
Methods: Plasma samples from HIV infected patients (190 individuals with clinically defined AIDS and 382
individuals without AIDS) were tested retrospectively for the presence of HBV sero-markers and for serum HBV
DNA, screened for HCV infection by testing for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA.
Results: HBsAg prevalence in HIV-positive individuals is 12.2%. HIV/HBV co-infected individuals with CD4 count of
<200 cells uL-1 have a higher HBV DNA viral load than patients with higher CD4 count (log 4.0 vs. log 2.0 DNA
copies/ml, p < 0.05). Males (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2) were more likely to be HBsAg positive than female. HCV
seroprevalence was 0.9% in HIV-positive individuals.
Conclusion: The prevalence of HBsAg carriage in HIV- infected Gambians is similar to that obtained in the general
population. However co-infected individuals with reduced CD4 levels, indicative of AIDS had higher prevalence of
HBeAg retention and elevated HBV DNA levels compared to non-AIDS patients with higher CD4 count.

Background
It is estimated that 350 million people world -wide are
chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
over 500,000 people die annually from HBV-related
causes [1,2]. HBV Carriers are at a high risk of developing cirrhotic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), the most frequent cause of cancer morbidity and
mortality worldwide [3]. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) produces a chronic infection in up to 80% of infected individuals. Like HBV, the virus is a major cause of severe
liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC [4,5]. Approximately
170 million people are infected with HCV worldwide
and over three million new infections occur each year
[6]. The prevalence rates in sub-Saharan Africa are
highly variable, ranging from 0-40% with Cameroon

having a prevalence of 13% [7] and 16% reported in
pregnant women in Malawi [8,9].
Although HBV and HCV are well documented for the
general Gambian population [10-13], there is limited
data on HBV and HCV seroprevalence in Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected Gambians.
HBV, HCV and HIV infections are important causes of
infectious diseases worldwide. HIV affects more than
33.4 million people worldwide, of which 22.7 million
live in sub-Saharan Africa and 2.7 million new HIV
infections were reported in 2008 [14]. In West Africa,
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused
by both HIV-1 and the related but generally less pathogenic HIV-2 [15].
The prevalence of HIV-1 reported in Senegal, The
Gambia and Guinea Bissau is between 0.5-5.0% [16] and
that of HIV-2 is between 3.3 to 8.3% [17,18]. However,
recent studies in Bissau have reported a decrease in

HIV-2 from 8.3% to 4.7% in a period of 17 yrs, whilst
HIV-1 is on the increase from 0.5% to 3.7% [19].
When both HBV and HIV co-infect a patient, the
mortality rate from chronic hepatitis B is increased
above that of either infection alone with a faster rate of
progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [20-22]. Co-infected individuals have a
reduction of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion, higher levels of HBV DNA and often show reactivation of HBV replication despite previous HBsAg
seroconversion [23].
In this era of rolling out Highly Active Antiretroviral
Therapy (HAART) it is important to document HIVHBV co-infection in regions with high chronic hepatitis
B endemicity and HIV infection rates. In the U.S. liver
disease, due to chronic HBV and/or HCV infection, has
become one of the leading causes of mortality among
people with HIV infection, despite the low prevalence in
the general population. Moreover, some ARVs, including
lamivudine (3TC) commonly used in first line ART,
possess anti-HBV activity. When these drugs are used as
monotherapy for HBV treatment, this will create the
potential for inducing HBV viral drug resistance mutations and selection of viral populations that may escape
current HBV vaccines.
The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence
of HBV and HCV in HIV infected subjects and to compare the level of HBV DNA, a marker of HBV replication in AIDS vs. non-AIDS patients.

Results
Demographic data and HIV status of subjects in the study

The demography data is presented in Tables 1 and 2.
The age ranges of the subjects were 7 months -71 years
(median = 35 yrs) for AIDS patients and 17 - 93 yrs
(median = 31 years) for non-AIDS subjects. The proportions of females infected with HIV were 61% in the
AIDS and 80% in the non-AIDS cohort. Overall, HIV-1,
HIV-2 and HIV-Dual infections accounted for 52%, 43%
and 5% of HIV infections. However, HIV-1 infection
made up 75% of the HIV infections in the AIDS cohort,
compared to only 41% in the non-AIDS. Median CD4
count at baseline was significantly lower in the AIDS
patients at pre-treatment time point compared to the
non-AIDS (p-values in each HIV-strata <0.001, analysis
not shown). The CD4 values did not vary significantly
across HIV-type in either the AIDS patients (pre-treatment time point) or non-AIDS groups (AIDS cohort,
p-value = 0.55; non-AIDS cohort, p-value = 0.36; analysis not shown). In the AIDS cohort, median HIV viral
loads before the start of treatment were not different
between HIV type (5.1 log10 copies mL-1 for HIV-1 and
4.8 log10 copies mL-1 for HIV-2 (p-value = 0.28).

HBV infection in HIV infected Gambians

Overall 78.1% (447 out of 572) of HIV positive individuals tested either positive for HBsAg or anti-HBc.
Seventy samples tested positive for HBsAg, giving an
overall prevalence of chronic HBV of 12.2% (95% CI
[0.09 - 0.15]) (Table 3). HBsAg prevalence did not vary
significantly between AIDS and non-AIDS groups
(15.7% vs. 11%) (p-value = 0.29, analysis not shown).
Additionally, univariate analysis showed no significant
differences in HBsAg prevalence by gender, age group,
HIV type or baseline CD4 cell count. However a logistic
model which regressed HBsAg on age, sex, HIV-type
and immune status revealed that HIV infected males
were significantly more likely to be HBsAg positive
(OR = 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.0, 3.2) than
women, as were younger people (10-24 yrs) compared
to adults (OR [per year] = 1.9. 95% CI: 0.9, 1.0) (Logistic
analysis is not shown in the table).
Overall, 26.1% (95% CI [16.2. 36.5]) of chronic carriers
were HBeAg positive, this did not differ by clinical status; i.e. AIDS vs. non-AIDS (p-value = 0.17) but HBeAg
positivity was associated with HIV type as 14.8% (4/27),
30% (12/40) and 100% (2/2) HIV-2, HIV-1 and Duals
respectively tested positive for HBeAg (p-value = 0.03).
The overall prevalence of anti-HBc antibody in the
502 HBsAg negative HIV-infected individuals was 79.1
(95% CI [79.0, 86.1], the marker showed an increase
with age; however this trend was not statistically significant. In multivariable logistic analysis, only male gender
and HIV type were significantly associated with HBcAb
positivity. In the model, HBcAb prevalence was

significantly higher in men (OR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.2, 4.3])
(The logistic analysis is not shown).
Overall, twenty-five of seventy HBsAg positive individuals had detectable HBV DNA, 62% (18/29) of AIDS
and 17% (7/41) of the non-AIDS carriers (Table 4) with
higher prevalence observed in HIV-1 and HIV-Dually
infected patients compared to HIV-2 (43.2% and 100%
vs. 20.8% respectively) (p-value 0.03). In paired t-tests
these differences were significant between HIV-1 and
HIV-2 and between HIV-2 and HIV-Dually infected
patients, but not between HIV-1 and HIV-Duals (analysis not shown). A higher proportion of men in the AIDS
group had detectable HBV DNA at pre treatment time
point than their women counterparts (83.3% vs. 40.0%)

(p-value 0.05), but this trend was not observed in the
non-AIDS group at the baseline time point.
CD4 levels in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals

CD4 counts were obtained for 184 out of 190 AIDS
patients at prior to ART including 29 HBsAg positive of
which 25 had CD4 counts (Table 3). The individuals
were divided into two groups based on their CD4 count
(cut off < 200 cells μL-1). The prevalence of HBsAg
positivity was not associated with CD4 levels, with equal
proportion of HBsAg positive subjects reported in either
the low level or high level CD4 group (11/29 vs. 14/29)
(Table 3). Co-infected patients with low CD4 count
(< 200 cells μL-1) had a higher HBV DNA viral load
than patients with high CD4 count of (> 200 cells μL-1)
(2.5 × 104 vs. 2.8 × 102 DNA copies mL-1) (p < 0.05).
HCV infection in HIV infected Gambians

Two independent HCV antibody assays result in 19.4%
(37/190) in AIDS and 6.7% (26/382) in non-AIDS individuals testing positive for HCV (Table 5). However, confirmatory test using RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA detected only 2
(1.0%) positive samples from the AIDS and 5 (1.3%)
from the non-AIDS group, 56 samples were not confirmed by RIBA of which 5 showed indeterminate
results, The age of these 7 individuals ranged from 29 to
68 years and they were all negative for HBsAg (Table 6).
HCV RNA detection by RT-PCR was performed in
order to determine the prevalence of chronic HCV
infection. Using primers specific to the 5′UTR and NS5b
regions we amplified 251 bp and 379 bp fragments
respectively. HCV RNA was detected in 4 (1- AIDS and
3- non-AIDS) out of 7 RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA positive
samples and in none of the 56 RIBA negative samples.
Genome sequence data from the 4 HCV RNA positive
samples were compared with sequences from the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis on the Gambian HCV
sequences in comparison with the GenBank sequences
showed similarity with HCV genotype 2 sequences
AF037254, AF037239 and AF037253(data not shown).

Discussions
HIV-HBV Dual infection is not uncommon where both
diseases are endemic. We assessed the level and impact
of this co-infection among both AIDS and non-AIDS
patients. Comparing these infections provided an insight
into the role of co-infection in disease progression in
chronic HBV carriers [23].
The HBsAg prevalence detected in HIV infected individuals was 12.2% with 78.1% positivity for either
HBsAg or anti-HBc, which is comparable to the overall
levels obtained in children [10,11] and in controls from
a liver cancer case control study [12]. 62% of the children were infected with HBV with between 17-36%

HBsAg positivity and highest rates of HBsAg carriage
was reported in the younger children. The controls in
the Kirk et al., study consisted of mainly adults with no
liver related disease. Since The Gambia has low levels of
HIV infection, with reported rates of 1-3% in the general
population [24], the similarity of HBV prevalence
reported in the previous studies and in the HIV- positive population in our study suggests that people
infected with HIV do not have greater exposure or susceptibility to HBV than the general population.
Unlike the situation in the U.S. and Europe, HBV in
sub Saharan Africa is commonly transmitted during
childhood between siblings, typically long before infection with HIV [25], Burkina Faso [26] and Cote d’Ivoire
Coast [25,27-29]. Over 30% of co-infected HBsAg carriers >25 yrs old were positive for hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg), this is greater than the rate reported in similar
age group in a non-HIV population of which the adult
HBV carriers were found to be in the inactive carrier
phase [30]. This is the third phase of chronic hepatitis B
that is traditionally identified by the absence of HBeAg
and HBV DNA for potentially indefinite duration. Thus
similar to reports from other African studies, HBe antibody seroconversion occurred less frequently in

Gambian HIV-infected individuals suggesting that HIV
infection either delayed transition to the inactive carrier
phase [31-34] or facilitate re-emergence of HBV replication. This has serious implications as studies have
shown that patients who test positive for HBeAg and/or
raised HBV DNA are those who are at highest risk of
developing advanced liver disease [35,36].
The degree of immunodeficiency represents an important factor in the progression of hepatitis among individuals co-infected with HBV and/or HCV [37]. There is
the risk of reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in HBV,
sometimes referred to as reverse seroconversion [31],
and occult hepatitis B. Occult hepatitis, defined by
undetectable serum HBsAg combined with measurable
serum HBV DNA, may be associated with progression
to cirrhosis and HCC [38] in co-infected patients. It is
anticipated that the natural history of HBV will change
in sub-Saharan Africa as more countries introduce
infant vaccination; this is likely to influence the rate of
HBV-HIV co-infection in the future. In The Gambia
HBV vaccination is done in infancy, the first dose given
between the ages of 1 and 4 weeks, with a coverage rate
of >80% [39]. However universal vaccination was introduced only 19 years ago so subjects in the current study

The HCV seroprevalence of 0.9% RIBA positive was
lower than the frequency reported in other countries in
Africa of 1.6-6.0% [7]. Although HCV had been found to
be of low prevalence in the Gambia, a surprisingly high
frequency of 19.0% was once reported in HCC patients
from a HCC case control study [12]. In our study 7 out
572 HIV positive individuals were co-infected with HCV
and this was observed exclusively in the older individuals
and none of them were HBV carriers.

The age distribution of HCV infection was previously
reported in a Gambian study of HIV negative individuals
and a cohort effect was proposed as a possible reason for
this finding [12]. Our study confirmed the presence of genotype 2, similar to the findings in Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau [40,41]. However like the Ruggieri et al., study,
we showed heterogeneity in subtype clustering. Similar low
rate of HCV-HBV co-infection was also reported in a previous study in Gambian patients referred for HIV screening
[13]. The high rate of false positive with the ELISA test
could be due to amino acid sequence variability and purity
of the HCV antigen used in the assays. The sensitivity and
specificity of the HCV ELISA have been shown to be influenced by high immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration of
human blood [42]. The lack of amplification with the 3
anti-HCV positive samples may be ascribed to a low viral
RNA content or to virus degradation.
The over representation of HIV-1 in the AIDS group
(over 5-fold higher than HIV-2) compared to the nonAIDS group is consistent with previous reports of a
longer median time to AIDS in HIV-2 with a comparatively smaller proportion of HIV-2 infected patients
developing AIDS
We observed a striking gender difference between the
two HIV groups registering a female to male ratio of over
2.5. Since this was a clinic based study, in the absence of

incidence data, it is unclear whether the gender distribution of HIV infection or HBV/HCV co-infection reflects
the general population. However, these results are similar
to a report from a national population-based HIV prevalence surveys conducted in 19 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, which showed a predominance of females in the
HIV infected groups, with the lowest female: male ratio
reported at 2.2[43,44]. Despite the over representation of
women in the two HIV positive groups, a higher proportion of HIV positive men had detectable HBV DNA compared to their female counterparts, suggesting a higher
level of viral activity which could lead to higher rate of
liver disease in males. This findings complements results
from previous studies that showed higher proportion of
men (male: female sex ratio around 2.4) with advanced
liver diseases compared to women [12]. Despite the difference in gender distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma especially in men in high-risk geographical areas,
there is little documented evidence for sex-linked differences in HBV replication [45].
In conclusion, we showed that the prevalence of HBV
chronic infection in HIV positive subjects in the Gambia
was similar to that found in the general population. Coinfection with HIV however can lead to higher frequency of HBeAg positivity and higher levels of HBV
DNA indicating higher levels of HBV replication.
Studies on the impact of HIV infection in the natural
history of chronic HBV and the effect of chronic hepatitis B on immune recovery are necessary. The question
as to whether there is a lower or delayed increase of
CD4 lymphocyte count in HIV/HBV co-infected
patients on ART is currently being investigated by our
group. The current study recommends HBsAg screening
for HIV patients before the start of ART.

(The Gambia) and with a small grant from Professor
Richard Tedder.

Materials and methods
Subjects

This retrospective study was conducted in two groups of
HIV infected patients recruited from the Genito-Urinary

Medicine (GUM) clinic from 1988 to 2008 and ARV
treatment started in 2004. During the period of 2005 to
date, the vast majority of GUM clinic patients are from
the general population presenting to the Medical
Research Council (MRC) directly. They are often self
referrals with symptoms of sexually transmitted illness
and between 10-25% of them get tested for HIV as a
result of medical illness. Prior to 2004, when there was
no active HIV screening nationwide the proportion of
self referrals to MRC were still as high as 85%-90%.
The first study group (AIDS), consists of 190 HIV
infected individuals with clinically-defined AIDS according to WHO criteria of clinical stage IV and or a CD4 <
200 cells μL-1. The second group (non-AIDS) consists
of 382 HIV-infected individuals without clinical stage IV
and had baseline CD4 counts > 200 cells μL-1 with the
majority having > 350 cells μL-1. Pre treatment and
baseline samples from the AIDS and non AIDS group
respectively were tested for HBV serology and HBsAg
positive samples had HBV DNA measurement. Samples
were tested for HCV seromarkers and HCV genotype
determined by sequencing of the 5′UTR and NS5b
regions. The AIDS patients had CD4 count, HIV viral
load and ALT results whilst non-AIDS patients had
CD4 count and ALT results.
Ethical approval was granted by the joint Gambia
Government/MRC Ethics Committee. All subjects and/
or legal guardians provided written, informed consent.
HIV Serology, CD4 cell counts and ALT measurement

HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections were screened for HIV
antibodies using combined enzyme-linked immuoabsorbent assay (ELISA) (Abbott Murex HIV 1.2.0 test kit,
Murex Diagnostics Ltd, Dartford, UK) and confirmed by
a 2 type-specific ELISA and synthetic peptide-based
strip method, Pepti-Lav 1-2 (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur,
Marne la Coquette, France) and dilutional assays [46].
CD4 cell count measurement was performed by flow
cytometry (Becton-Dickinson, Belgium) and plasma
HIV-1 and HIV-2 viral load measurement was done
using an in-house viral load assay [47] ALT was measured using Roche Cobas Mira Chemistry Analyzer.

Hepatitis B virus serology

HBsAg test was by immunochromatography (Abbot
Determine™), HBsAg positive samples were further
tested for Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibodies
(anti-HBe) by ELISA (DiaSorin, Sallugia, Italy). All
HBsAg negative samples were subjected to Hepatitis B
core antibody (anti-HBc) test using ELISA (DiaSorin).
HBV DNA quantification

DNA was extracted from HBsAg positive samples using
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, UK) and quantified
using real time PCR with HBV specific primers as previously described and utilizing primers HBV TAQ 1
(GTG TCT GCG GCG TTT TATCA) and HBV TAQ-2
(GAC AAA CGG GCA ACA TAC CTT) for the amplification [48].
Hepatitis C Virus serology, RNA detection and sequencing

Samples were screened for HCV antibodies using an
anti-HCV ELISA kit, (Abbott Murex, version 4.0). All
positive samples were rescreened using the same ELISA.
Samples that were repeatedly positive were confirmed
using a recombinant immunoblot assay (Chiron RIBA
HCV 3.0 SIA, Chiron Corporation).
All of the HCV-antibody positive samples, including
those that tested negative for RT-PCR were further
tested for the presence of HCV RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nested PCR using primers specific to the 5′untranslated region (5′-UTR)
and non-structural (NS5b) regions of HCV. Prior to
RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from plasma using
QIAmp viral RNA reagents (Qiagen). The RT-PCR
mixture containing 300 ng RNA, 0.4 mM dNTP
(each), 0.2 μM of primers NF5 (sense GTGAGGAACTACTGTCTTCA CGCAG) and NR5 (antisense
TGCTCATGGTGCACGGTCTACGAGA) was subjected to one cycle of RT at 50°C followed by 30 cycles
of PCR to amplify the 5′UTR region followed by a second round PCR amplification [49]. Similarly, the NS5b
region was amplified by performing two round of PCR
using two sets of primers 4EF101F-TTCTCGTATGATACCCGCTGTTTTGA and HCV NS5RnB-TACCT
GGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAAG GCTC [41]. Gel purified PCR products were sequenced using primers specific for the 5′UTR (KF2 - TTCACGCAGAA AGC
GTCTAG and 211-CACTCTCGAGCAC CCTATCAGGCAGT) and NS5b (HCVN S5F2-TATGA TACC
CGCTGCTTTGACTCG; HCVNS 5R2c-CTGG TCATAGCCTCCGTGAAGGCTCTCAGG and HCVN S5
R2d-CTGGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAAGGCTCGTA GG.
Statistical Analysis

HBV seroprevalence was determined in the two HIV
positive groups. To identify factors associated with the

Page 7 of 9

presence and severity of HBV infection, univariate analysis was conducted to assess HBV seroprevalence for
HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAb and the geometric mean
and median of HBV DNA copies across demographic
and HIV-related variables. Analyses were stratified by
cohort membership in the AIDS and non-AIDS patients.
Statistically significant differences in HBV seromarker
prevalence was assessed by Chi-Square or Fisher’s exact
tests. The difference in the geometric mean and median
HBV DNA copies was assessed by the Kruskal Wallis
test. Multivariable logistic regression models were then
developed to examine the impact of demographic and
HIV type on prevalence of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAb.
Factors which were statistically significant in univariate
analysis or which were of theoretic interest were
included in the full model. A logistic model that
regressed HBsAg on age, sex and HIV-type was run. All
analyses were carried out in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina).
