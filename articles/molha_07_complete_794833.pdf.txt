Background
Denitrification is a component of the global nitrogen
cycle. It is an alternative process for respiration used by
bacteria under low oxygen conditions, through which
they can reduce nitrate and/or nitrite to dinitrogen gas
through the production of the intermediates nitric oxide
and nitrous oxide [1]. In recent studies, the thermophilic
bacterium Geobacillus thermoleovorans was shown to
reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas, indicating the presence of a
denitrification pathway [2]. The first catalytic step of this
pathway can be achieved by two alternative enzymes: a
membrane-bound or periplasmic-bound reductase (NAR
and NAP, respectively). The second step can be catalyzed
by a CD1 nitrite reductase (nirS) or, in some species, a
copper nitrite reductase (nirK). The third step catalyses the
conversion of nitrite oxide to nitrous oxide by two different types of nitric oxide reductase. Finally the last step the
catalization of nitrous oxide into dinitrogen gas completes the denitrification pathway and is carried out by the
enzyme nosZ.
The aim of this study was to identify the key proteins
involved in this pathway in the recently sequenced Geobacillus thermoleovorans genome, using standard bioinformatics tools.

Materials and methods
Data gathering and database creation
A database of all the published denitrification genes and
other proteins associated with this pathway was assem-

bled and used as probe sequences to search the genome
assembly of Geobacillus thermoleovorans using BLASTP and
BLASTX [3]. If no significant hits were found, the step was
repeated using the non-redundant sequence database (nr)
from the NCBI as the target and the BLASTP. BLASTX and
PSI-BLAST [4] algorithms. All significant hits where collected and again used as probe sequences against our
genome assembly. Finally all orthologous sequences were
aligned and hmm profiles [6] were produced and
searched against our genome assembly.
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of each denitrification gene
were aligned using ClustalX [5]. A neighbor-joining tree
was calculated for each using MEGA3 software [7,8].

Results and discussion
In our genome of interest (Geobacillus thermoleovorans), we
were able to identify most of the components of the first
step on the denitrification pathway. We determined the
presence of a narGHJI gene cluster and the narXL regulatory system as well as a possible nitrate/nitrite transporter
homologous to narK gene. We also verified the presence
of the periplasmic nitrate reductase napA although no
other homologs of enzymes related to this alternative
nitrate reductase were found. For the second step of the
pathway, although no homologous for cd1-nitrite reductase were found, nirM, the electron donor for this enzyme
is present together with nirE, an enzyme involved in the
heme d1 bio-synthetic pathway. No other nitrite reductPage 1 of 2

ase was found although a copper nitrite reductase has
been identified in the genome of Geobacillus kaustophilus,
a closely related organism. The third step of the pathway
is represented by a homolog of the Ralstonia eutropha nitric
oxide reductase. This is a dehydrogenase enzyme that
accepts electrons from quinol. No enzymes where found
related to the forth and final step of the pathway. However, in addition to the above proteins, several important
regulatory proteins were also identified such as the fhp
(flavohomeprotein) and the rpoN (sigma factor s54),
dnrN, norR and norQ that have important functions such
as activation of different parts of the denitrification pathway depending on the availability of oxygen and/or nitrogen.

Conclusion
The main objective of this paper was to give an overview
of the genes involved in the denitrification pathway of
Geobacillus thermoleovorans. This was partially accomplished.
The first step of the denitrification pathway is well represented in this geobacillus species. We were able to identify
the key genes that encode the enzymes required for the
conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the nitrate reductase
NAR. Although there are 2 alternative nitrate reductases
identified on the genome, the periplasmic nitrate reductase does appear isolated with no other enzymes related to
this membrane-bound nitrate reductase pathway. The
enzyme responsible for the reduction of nitrite to nitrite
to nitrite oxide was not identified although we have identified enzymes related to the bio-synthesis of the heme D1
required for the function of this reductase. For the third
step of the denitrification pathway, we have identified an
unusual nitric oxide reductase, present in just a few betaproteobacteria and, the related enzymesnecessary for the
metabolic step were identified on the genome, although
they are not clustered together in an operon has seen in
Ralstonia eutropha. According to our genome assembly we
could not identify any candidates for the last step of the
denitrification process which indicates that this step
might be absent in this organism. Unpublished laboratory
results have indicated that this organism reduces nitrate
and nitrite oxide; this implies that a nitrite reductase is
present and we have failed to identify it. This may be due
to errors in the draft genome assembly of G. thermoleovorans or that there might be an alternative enzyme responsible for the reduction of nitrite that does not share
sequence similarity to the nitrite reductases identified
until now.
