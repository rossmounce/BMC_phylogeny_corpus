Abstract
Background: Regions of interest identified through genetic linkage studies regularly exceed 30
centimorgans in size and can contain hundreds of genes. Traditionally this number is reduced by
matching functional annotation to knowledge of the disease or phenotype in question. However,
here we show that disease genes share patterns of sequence-based features that can provide a good
basis for automatic prioritization of candidates by machine learning.
Results: We examined a variety of sequence-based features and found that for many of them there
are significant differences between the sets of genes known to be involved in human hereditary
disease and those not known to be involved in disease. We have created an automatic classifier
called PROSPECTR based on those features using the alternating decision tree algorithm which
ranks genes in the order of likelihood of involvement in disease. On average, PROSPECTR enriches
lists for disease genes two-fold 77% of the time, five-fold 37% of the time and twenty-fold 11% of
the time.
Conclusion: PROSPECTR is a simple and effective way to identify genes involved in Mendelian and
oligogenic disorders. It performs markedly better than the single existing sequence-based classifier
on novel data. PROSPECTR could save investigators looking at large regions of interest time and
effort by prioritizing positional candidate genes for mutation detection and case-control association
studies.

Background
Over the last twenty years the genes underlying more than
a thousand classically Mendelian disorders have been successfully identified. By contrast, only a relatively small
number of genetic components of complex traits have
been characterized [1].

Regions of interest identified through complex-trait linkage studies regularly exceed 30 centimorgans in size and
can contain hundreds of genes. The traditional candidategene approach to reducing this number of genes to a manageable level involves attempting to match functional
annotation to knowledge of the disease or phenotype
under investigation. Unfortunately this approach has

been characterized by unsubstantiated and unreplicated
claims [2].
Problems arise firstly because the link between genotype
and phenotype in complex disorders tends to be weak;
matching a single gene's functional annotation to a phenotype is unlikely to be successful unless the gene in question is clearly related to some known pathogenesis of the
disease. Secondly, functional annotation of the human
genome is incomplete and biased towards better studied
genes which have higher levels of annotation. Furthermore, assigning functional annotation is a time-consuming process which is unavoidably error-prone [3,4] and, if
taken at face value, misannotated genes can mislead or
delay researchers [5].
Van Driel et al. developed a web-based system for automating the annotation based candidate-gene approach [6]
that collates expression and phenotypic data from nine
different databases and returns genes that conform to
investigator-defined criteria. Recently several other candidate-gene identification systems that rely on grouping
Gene Ontology (GO) terms have been described [7,8],
notably POCUS [9], which finds genes across multiple

susceptibility loci that share Interpro [10] domains and
GO terms. These systems all rely on functional annotation
to make correct predictions, but given that such annotation is incomplete and inherently biased towards a particular subset of genes, a more robust option might be to use
sequence-based features instead.
It has been suggested that the genes underlying human
hereditary disease share certain distinctive, sequencebased features such as larger gene size [11]. By using
machine learning algorithms we aimed to discover such
common patterns that could be applied to create an automatic classification scheme capable of identifying genes
more likely than not to be involved in disease.
Machine learning has moved rapidly from the field of
experimental artificial intelligence to that of applied science. Bioinformatics researchers have been quick to adopt
machine learning algorithms in a variety of different situations and their use is now widespread [12]. Lopez-Bigas
et al. recently presented a relatively successful decision
tree created using such techniques [13] which used
amino-acid length and a measure of sequence conservation across species of genes as features to predict genes

likely to be involved in hereditary disease. Our approach
was related but examined a broader set of features and
algorithms, producing a significantly more successful classifier that is able to predict genes involved in both Mendelian and more complex traits. We have also created a web
interface to allow researchers to easily classify individual
genes or whole regions of the genome and made it freely

Results
Defining features and building the training set
A set of features was chosen based on a comparative study
of ~ 18,000 known genes from Ensembl [14] which are
not known to be involved in human disease and the 1,084
Ensembl genes also listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [15]. The feature set (described in
Table 1) reflects the structure, content and phylogenetic
extent (the extent to which a gene is conserved back
through evolution based on homologs in other species) of
each gene examined. We included signal peptide and
transmembrane domain predictions; though these are
strictly speaking functional attributes they can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy directly from
sequence.

Table 2 lists the features we found to be different between
the Ensembl genes in OMIM and those not in OMIM.
Using the Mann-Whitney U test we found highly significant differences between the gene, cDNA and protein sizes
of the two sets (P < 0.001). The genes listed in OMIM were
significantly larger and encoded larger proteins; this confirms previous findings [11,13] which noted that the
genes and proteins involved in human disease tend to be

larger than average. Similarly, we found that the genes
listed in OMIM were far more likely to have well conserved best reciprocal hit (BRH) homologs with other species and in particular with mice; this also concurs with
previous studies [13,16]. The percentage of gene products
that are secreted was much higher in the set of genes listed
in OMIM than on average (P < 0.0001) and perhaps
unsurprisingly given the larger sizes of genes involved in
disease and the correlation between gene size and exon
number we found a highly significant difference in the
number of exons per gene (P < 0.001 using the MannWhitney U test). Genes listed in OMIM had a median of
10 exons while genes not known to be involved in disease
had a median number of 8. Genes listed in OMIM were
more frequently expressed in specific tissues (P < 0.001)
and again this confirms previous findings [17] – however,
it was decided to exclude tissue specificity from our feature set in order to avoid potential bias (see Methods).
We also found novel differences between the two sets of
genes. There was a small difference (P < 0.028) in the
number of CpG islands at the 5' end of genes listed in
OMIM and those not, with slightly more genes listed in
OMIM having 5' CpG islands, which are associated with
both housekeeping genes and to a lesser extent tissue specific genes [18]. There was also a significant difference (P
< 0.01) in the length of the 3' UTR between genes listed in
OMIM (median 488 bp) and those not involved in disease (median 446 bp). There was also a significant disparity (P < 0.01) in the distance to the nearest neighbouring
gene – genes listed in OMIM had a median distance of 52
kb to their neighbours while genes not known to be
involved in disease had a median distance of 46 kb. To

our knowledge these features have not been previously
reported.
Graphs showing the different distributions of selected features in the two sets are shown in Figure 1. Though some
of the differences we found have previously been
described in literature, the discrepancy in 3' UTR length
has to our knowledge not been examined before and cannot be easily explained in terms of correlation to other,
known feature differences. Two other novel features are
the distance to the nearest neighbouring gene and the
number of exons; both of these are quite strongly correlated to gene size (with Spearman correlation coefficients
of 0.69 and 0.71, respectively).
We also studied the number of Interpro domains in each
set of genes and found significant differences but concluded that a bias existed towards better studied genes.
Therefore we excluded this feature from our study (see
Methods).
Automatic classifiers are created by being trained on a set
of genes that has already been classified manually. Our
training set of genes was made up of the 1,084 genes
found in both OMIM and Ensembl (the "disease genes")
and 1,084 Ensembl genes not known to be involved in
disease (the "control genes") which were selected at random from the larger set of ~ 18,000 as a representative
sample.
Choosing an algorithm
We used Weka [19] as the platform for our machine learning experiments. A variety of different machine learning
methods were examined but the alternating decision tree
algorithm was chosen as the basis of our classification
scheme as it couples high accuracy with a relatively small
set of rules [20]. The advantage of decision tree based
schemes over other popular algorithms such as k-Nearest
Neighbour, Support Vector Machines and Bayesian Networks is that the rules that are produced for classifying
instances can be interpreted more easily by non-expert
users. This is particularly true for the alternating decision
tree algorithm, which typically produces trees that are just
as predictive as those created by more traditional decision
tree algorithms but that are far more concise and thus easier to understand. Alternating decision trees also allowed
us to measure the contribution of each feature to the final
classification of a gene, which might provide insight into
the essential differences between those genes more and
less likely to be involved in disease.

Alternating decision trees are created by adding rules to
the tree in an iterative fashion in the order of their predictive power, with the more effective rules being added first.
These rules are automatically derived from the differences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/55

between the disease and control genes in the training set
provided. A new rule is added to the tree either as a new
"node" or as a child of an existing node. With Weka, the
number of nodes to add to the tree is specified by the user
before training begins. Too few nodes and the tree will be
sparse, without enough cumulative discriminatory power
to make confident classifications. Too many nodes, on the
other hand, will result in an overly-complex tree where
later nodes with weak predictive power can distort the
effects of earlier, more predictive nodes.
On the basis of past experience we chose to limit the size
of our alternating decision tree to fifteen nodes, which is
a good balance of predictive power and complexity. As
each node represents a rule that tests a single sequence feature, this meant that of the two dozen sequence features
available a maximum of fifteen would be used in the final
tree.
An alternating decision tree with fifteen nodes was produced by training on the training set of genes and is
shown in Figure 2. We also produced trees with ten and
twenty nodes for comparison and discovered using the
measurements described below that classifier performance was indeed poorer than with the fifteen node version
(details not shown).
The alternating decision tree
A gene is classified with the tree in Figure 2 by beginning
at the node marked "Start" and then following each
branch in turn. Upon reaching a node that contains an
assumption – for example, that the gene length is larger
than a given number – the "yes" or "no" branch is followed as appropriate. If the relevant feature – the paralog
percentage identity, for example – is "unknown", neither
branch is followed. Adding up each of the numbers in rectangles that are encountered along the way results in a
final score that reflects the relative confidence of the classification. The classification itself is based on the sign of
the score – if negative the gene is generally more likely to
be involved in hereditary disease, if positive the gene is
generally less likely to be involved in hereditary disease.

We tested the classifier on our training set of genes. 77%
of the disease genes were correctly identified (that is to say
had a negative score). In contrast, 42% of the 1,084 control genes were classified as disease genes (were false positives). As this is a predictive approach – we cannot say a
priori how much of the genome and thus the representative sample in the training set is made up of genes that are
involved in disease but are not yet characterized – at least
some of these apparently incorrect classifications are
likely to be correct.

confidence of the classification. The classification itself is based on the sign of the score.

We ran a tenfold cross-validation test to get a conservative
estimate of how our classifier might perform on unseen
data. Tenfold cross-validation is a widely used technique
in machine learning and involves partitioning the whole
training set into ten independent "folds" each with the
same balance of disease genes and control genes. The
classifier is trained on nine of the partitions and tested on

the remaining partition. This is repeated until each partition has been tested on a new classifier built with the
remainder of the training set and simulates the performance of the chosen algorithm and feature set on unseen
data. On average, 70% of the disease genes were correctly
identified during cross-validation with 43% of control
genes classified as false positives. This is comparable to

Table 3: More detailed classifier performance statistics. For each set of genes tested, five statistics that reflected performance were
calculated. Accuracy is the overall accuracy of the classifier; precision reflects the classifier's specificity and recall reflects classifier
sensitivity. The area under curve (AUC) is the area underneath the ROC curve drawn for each set of genes (see Figure 3) and
represents classifier performance across all combinations of sensitivity and specificity. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents 100%
accuracy, 0.5 represents performance no better than random and 0 represents 0% accuracy. The Kappa statistic is a measurement of
agreement between predicted and actual classifications and takes false positive rates into account. It is a number between 1
(symbolising perfect agreement between predicted and actual classifications) and 0 (symbolising no agreement).

the results obtained by Lopez-Bigas et al. [13] during
cross-validation. Table 3 contains more detailed statistics
relating to classifier performance.

The web interface allows researchers to quickly obtain
scores for regions of the genome or individual genes of
interest.

As the alternating decision tree outputs a score that can be
thresholded, it is a relatively simple matter to increase specificity (precision) at the expense of sensitivity (recall).
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves can be
used to visualise classifier performance with different
combinations of specificity and sensitivity. The x-axis of a
ROC curve represents the fraction of false positives and
the y-axis the fraction of true positives in the classifier
results. As the number of true positives (sensitivity)
increases, so too does the number of false positives
(decreasing specificity). Figure 3 shows the ROC curves for
the classifier on the training set and the two test sets which
are described below.

Further testing
Evaluating classifier performance on the training set alone
is potentially misleading as over-fitting may have
occurred. Over-fitting happens when a classifier generalises only to the extent necessary to work well on the training data, resulting in poor performance on data that was
not seen during the training process. Cross-validation provides a measure of the performance of our approach in
general, but doesn't reflect actual PROSPECTR performance accurately as the alternating decision trees created for
each fold are different. We therefore created two test sets
independent of the training set.

Table 4 shows the relative importance of the eleven different sequence features used by the classifier. We calculated
these values by testing the classifier on our training set
and, for each gene, keeping track of the percentage contribution of each feature to the final score. These percentages
were then averaged out over all genes predicted as likely to
be involved in disease. It should be noted that while the
percentages given accurately reflect the relative contribution of each feature to our classifier they are meaningless
when taken out of context; by themselves, for example,
GC content and the % identity of a worm homolog are
not necessarily equally predictive features for distinguishing between genes that are more likely and those less
likely to be involved in disease.
We implemented our classifier as a standalone script in
Perl and designed an associated web interface to aid in the
interpretation of the results produced. The resulting software is named PROSPECTR (for PRiOrization by
Sequence &PhylogEnetic features of CandidaTe Regions)
and is freely accessible together with training and test sets
of genes at http://www.genetics.med.ed.ac.uk/prospectr.

The first independent test set (the "HGMD set") contained
675 genes associated with disease listed in the Human
Gene Mutation Database [21] and 675 genes not known
to be involved in disease that were picked at random from
Ensembl. The second (the "oligogenic set") contained 54
genes not known to be involved in disease and picked at
random from Ensembl and 54 genes not listed in OMIM
but associated with different oligogenic disorders
including inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinsons, Retinitis Pigmentosa and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
We were unable to obtain a sizeable, reliable set of genes
involved in complex traits; this meant that classifier performance could not be tested on the components of complex disease. This may change in the future as resources
such as the Genetic Association Database [22] develop
further and more association data becomes accessible.
71% (478) of the disease genes from the HGMD set and
72% (39) of the genes from the oligogenic set were correctly identified by the classifier, with 42% (282) and 41%
(22) of control genes misclassified respectively. These

results are similar to those obtained on the training set,
suggesting that over-fitting did not occur. They also suggest that our sequence-based approach works equally well
for finding genes involved in both oligogenic and monogenic disorders.
Lopez-Bigas et al [13] used a larger set of disease genes
during training. Only 260 of the genes from the HGMD
set were independent of the training sets of both
PROSPECTR and the Lopez-Bigas classifier. As a comparative measure, these 260 genes were scored using both
classifiers. PROSPECTR correctly identified 72% (189) of
the disease genes while the Lopez-Bigas classifier identified 47% (123).

positive rate is measured along the y-axis and the false positive along the x-axis. The area under the resulting curve is a
measure of classifier performance.

PROSPECTR, however, had a higher false positive rate,
categorising ~ 44% of the whole human genome as likely
to be involved in disease while the Lopez-Bigas classifier
categorised ~ 31% of the whole human genome as likely
to be involved in disease. To see how this might have
affected recall we calculated the Kappa statistic [23] for the
results from both classifiers. The Kappa statistic is a measurement of agreement between predicted and actual classifications and takes false positive rates into account. It is
a number between 1 (symbolising perfect agreement
between predicted and actual classifications) and 0 (symbolising no agreement). On the independent HGMD set
of 260 genes and assuming a false positive rate of 31%,
the Lopez-Bigas classifier had a Kappa statistic of 0.158
while PROSPECTR assuming a false positive rate of 44%
had a Kappa statistic of 0.282, a factor of almost twofold.
This suggests that PROSPECTR is substantially more adept

125 times (18%), top 50% 510 times (75%) and the top
75% 639 times (94%).
We repeated the procedure for the 1,084 genes listed in
OMIM from our training set. The average number of genes
per list was 198 and target genes were in the top 5% 171
times out of 1084 (15%) and the top 50% 873 times
(80%).
The genes from the training and HGMD sets are mostly
Mendelian monogenic disorders; to see if the classifier
was equally successful at enriching loci involved in more
complex diseases we took the list of 219 genes likely to be
involved in oligogenic disorders used as a test set by
POCUS [9].

than the Lopez-Bigas classifier at correctly classifying
unseen data.
By ranking genes by score in descending order, it is possible for PROSPECTR to create a list of genes for any given
locus the top of which is enriched for genes that have a
higher probability of being involved in disease.
To test this we took the HGMD set and for each gene created an artificial locus 30 Mb in size consisting of the gene
from the HGMD set and all known genes within 15 Mb on
either side on the same chromosome. The gene taken
from the HGMD set was in each case designated the "target gene" and by scoring each gene in the artificial locus
and then ranking them we were able to see where the target gene appeared in the ordered list that was created.

For these 219 genes involved in oligogenic disorders the
average number of genes per list was 209 and the target
gene was in the top 5% 29 times (13.4%) and the top 50%
172 times (79%). Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of these results.
Performance on different types of mutation
Gene records from the HGMD contain information about
the number of different mutations associated with any
phenotypes linked to that gene, split into three types:
nucleotide substitutions, micro-lesions and gross lesions
(including repeat variations and complex rearrangements). For example, the Huntington gene (HD) is
recorded as being implicated in Huntington disease,
which is associated with a gross lesion. The Haemoglobin
beta gene (HBB) is recorded as being implicated in sickle
cell anaemia, associated with nucleotide substitutions.

Of the HGMD set we used to test performance, 297 genes
were associated with nucleotide substitutions only, 55
with gross lesions only and 27 with micro-lesions only.
We tested each subset separately to determine if the
underlying cause of disease influenced PROSPECTR's
performance.
We found that 75% and 77% of the genes involved in disease and associated only with nucleotide substitutions or
only with micro-lesions, respectively, were correctly identified by PROSPECTR. However, only 54% of the genes
involved in disease and associated only with gross lesions
were identified. This suggests that the decision tree used
by PROSPECTR is better at identifying genes likely to be
involved in disease because of small or point mutations
than genes involved in disease because of more drastic
events like gross deletions, insertions and chromosomal
aberrations.

For the 675 genes from the HGMD set the average number
of genes per list was 202. Target genes were in the top 5%
of the ordered list 68 times (10% of the time), top 10%

Whole genome analysis
PROSPECTR was used to score every known gene in the
Ensembl database on the likelihood that it is involved in
human hereditary disease. We normalised the score α
given to each gene with the equation

1
1+γα
where gamma (γ) represents Euler's constant so that it fell
between 0 and 1 with higher scores suggesting a higher
likelihood of involvement in disease.
97 genes had a score over 0.75, of which 36 (~ 33%) are
listed in either the HGMD or OMIM and are thus already
known to be involved in disease (this represents a more
than threefold enrichment; Ensembl contained ~ 19,500
known genes of which ~ 9% were known disease genes).
By contrast, in the set of 4,357 genes which scored less
than 0.3 only ~ 0.8% (35 genes) are already known to be
involved in disease.
A list of the 61 genes that scored higher than 0.75 but are
not already known to be involved in disease is included as
supplementary material (see Additional File 1). By searching for references in PubMed we discovered that 9 of these
genes (~ 15% of the total) are already candidates for
involvement in diseases including Alzheimers (ABCA2),
osteoporosis (COL4A1 and COL4A2) and schizophrenia
(SLIT3).

Discussion
Relative performance
PROSPECTR has a number of advantages over existing
classification schemes designed to differentiate between
genes more and less likely to be involved in disease.

PROSPECTR appears to perform significantly better on
unseen data than the decision tree classifier presented by
Lopez-Bigas et al. The Lopez-Bigas classifier is less likely to
be useful as a predictive tool for two, related reasons:
firstly, it achieves perfect accuracy when tested on the
training set, even though the training set is known to be
inconsistent. The Lopez-Bigas classifier suggests that ~
31% of the genome is made up of predicted disease genes.
Thus if genes were picked at random to make up the control set during training it should be assumed that ~ 31%
of them are actually disease genes which have not yet been
characterized. Perfect accuracy on the training set is therefore undesirable – by ignoring the possibility that the set
of control genes might contain disease genes the classifier
loses flexibility and predictive power. Secondly, the fact
that all uncharacterized disease genes were predicted as
being control despite their presumed strong similarity (in
terms of sequence features) to other disease genes suggests

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/55

that it is highly likely that at least some degree of overfitting occurred, which would further impair performance
on novel data.
PROSPECTR's use of a spread of sequence-based features
representing the structure, content and phylogenetic
extent of candidate genes allows investigators to see
exactly which features are contributing the most towards
a particular classification. In addition, it requires no
detailed phenotypic knowledge of the disease in question
and can score whole chromosomes in minutes. The use of
sequence-based features avoids the bias inherent in current functional annotation, where better studied genes are
far more likely to have better and more extensive annotation. Furthermore, by relying less on phylogenetic conservation we reduce the amount of potential bias from
imperfect homology prediction (see Eliminating Bias in
Methods).
Classifier mechanics
Other researchers have examined some of the sequencebased differences between genes listed in OMIM and
genes not known to be involved in disease but there have
been no comprehensive studies. The data we present here
collates all of the known sequence-based differences and
introduces some new ones – for example, the differences
in 3' UTR length between the two sets of genes are statistically significant and, though a correlation with gene size
exists, it is relatively weak (a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.35). Further research is needed to suggest how
all of these differences might relate to, for example, a
gene's relative importance or position in a protein-protein
interaction map or biological pathway.

The length of the 3' UTR is thought to be related to translational efficiency and mRNA stability [24], which in turn
affects the level of expression of the gene. Two other novel
sequence-based features where we found significant differences between disease and non-disease genes – the distance to the nearest neighbouring gene and the number of
exons – might also be directly related to expression levels
[25]. In this work we were able to confirm the suggestions
from previous studies that there is a significant difference
in tissue specificity between disease and non-disease
genes [17] – perhaps similar differences exist between the
two sets in patterns of overall gene expression levels.
It seems remarkable that disease genes would share
sequence features to such an extent. In particular gene
length and protein length when taken together as features
for an alternating decision tree classifier with fifteen nodes
can be reasonably predictive (69% of disease genes correctly classified from the training set with 51% misclassification, details not shown).

A complex web of correlations exists between gene and
protein size, levels of expression and rates of evolution,
which perhaps explains why predictive power remains relatively high after removing features other than gene and
protein size. Additionally, larger genes might simply be
bigger targets for mutation [13], or be more likely to have
sequence features like overlapping gene groups, multiple
amino acid runs [26] and motifs associated with mutational hotspots which might increase the chance of them
succumbing to some disease causing mutation.
An alternative hypothesis is that PROSPECTR does not
predict genes likely to be involved in disease at all, but the
opposite: it derives its predictive power from discounting
those genes which are unlikely to be involved in disease as
mutations usually result in a phenotype which is either
lethal (in which case we wouldn't class it as a disease
gene), undetectable (in which case we couldn't class it as
a disease gene) or very weak (in which case the classification of the gene would be debateable).
We have shown that PROSPECTR performs well on an oligogenic test set. However, one might expect the biological
mechanisms of cause and effect to differ between simple
Mendelian and more complex traits and therefore the
classifiers dealing with either type may also have to differ.
Currently no sizeable dataset of genes involved in complex disease exists; until one is created and examined we
cannot tell how PROSPECTR will perform when used to
find the genes underlying complex disease. We would
thus advise caution when using PROSPECTR to search for
genes involved in complex traits.
Future directions
PROSPECTR can create lists of genes the tops of which are
enriched for those genes that are likely to be involved in
human disease. Substantial enrichment is highly likely
with this sequence-based approach, although investigators still need to carry out functional comparisons and
fine scale mapping to reduce lists to one or two candidates
for each region of interest. By contrast, functional classifiers might present only a handful of high quality suggestions for each of the regions studied but equally might not
return the target gene at all as their threshold for successful detection is too high.

One way of speeding the candidate gene discovery process
further without sacrificing accuracy might be to combine
existing techniques that use functional annotation with a
sequence-based approach similar to the one we describe
here. It may be possible to create a combined classifier
greater than the sum of its parts by lowering the threshold
of a successful functional annotation based classifier and
then dismissing false positives using a sequence-based
approach.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/55

The alternating decision tree used in PROSPECTR was
trained using all genes from OMIM and as such is suited
for general use. However, there might well be some value
in creating custom classifiers targeted to a particular area
of interest; for example, genes involved in neurological
disorders. If the training set was still sufficiently large
enough to be representative then one might expect more
precision when scoring candidate genes in similar disorders. As a first step towards this we have made instructions
for creating custom classifiers available on the
PROSPECTR website.

Conclusion
On average, PROSPECTR successfully enriches lists of candidate genes 2-fold ~ 77% of the time, 5-fold ~ 37% of the
time and 25-fold ~ 11% of the time. It does so for both
monogenic and oligogenic disorders and on the basis of a
compact set of rules which look at sequence-based features. These features reflect the structure and content of
the genes in question as well as the phylogenetic extent
and are much less likely to be biased towards better studied genes than manual annotation.
The rules involved are easily interpretable which gives
some insight into how the classifier works and the importance of various features relative to each other, signposting new avenues of investigation into the differences
between the types of disease and non-disease genes.
We predict that the growing availability of relevant protein-protein interaction data and better functional annotation will greatly improve candidate identification
techniques for oligogenic and complex disorders, as
shared or compensated pathways become clearer. However, robust genome-wide functional annotation is still
some way off. In the meantime, using PROSPECTR as a
quick, unbiased method to rank genes in order of their
likelihood of involvement in disease could save investigators much time and effort when examining larger regions
of interest, prioritizing candidates for more in-depth functional characterization, mutation detection and case control studies.

Methods
We used Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) to
obtain lists of disease genes and MySQL client access to
Ensembl to retrieve the sequences for those genes. We also
used Ensembl to provide genes as a control set by selecting
reasonably sized representative sets at random. The genes

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:55

in the control set were not listed in either OMIM or the
HGMD.
To create our initial feature set we collated information
from Ensembl, NCBI's Homologene, Interpro [10], SwissPROT and the Novartis Gene Expression Atlas [27]. This
initial feature set included all of the features listed in Table
1 as well as information relating to tissue expression and
protein domain distribution. The relevant information for
all known genes in Ensembl was stored in a local MySQL
database. We then compared features from a set of 1,084
genes listed in OMIM with a representative sample from
the control set made up of ~ 18,000 genes from Ensembl
not listed in OMIM. Features that were considered to have
a reasonable degree of predictive power were selected to
create the feature set to be made available to the alternating decision tree algorithm. To calculate the tissue specificity of each gene we used the same method as Winter et.
al [17].
We used Weka as the platform for building our classifier.
Weka is free, open source Java application and is readily
available on the internet [19]. Experiments were carried
out using the Explorer interface to Weka using the ADTree
classifier. The accuracy, precision, recall, AUC (the area
under the ROC curve; used as a performance metric) and
Kappa statistics in Table 3 were obtained directly from
Weka. We used custom Perl scripts to create artificial loci
and then rank the scores of the genes they contained. We
wrote the PROSPECTR software using Perl and the Apache
web server.
Eliminating bias and sources of error
We studied the feature set for potential bias. In particular,
the number of Interpro domains described on each gene
appeared to have more to do with a bias towards better
studied genes than with disease gene association. When
we compared the number of Interpro domains between
the OMIM genes and a group of genes not known to be
involved in disease but with at least one reference in literature (according to their SwissPROT record) no significant
differences were found. We therefore eliminated any features based on Interpro domains as potentially biased.

Though highly significant differences in tissue expression
patterns were detected, it was decided to exclude the tissue
specificity feature from the training set as it introduced a
bias towards disease genes; reliable, normalised tissue
expression data was available for ~ 95% of genes implicated in disease but only two thirds of control genes.
Genes without the relevant data could have been ignored
or had a best guess value assigned to them, but this would
have undermined the classifier's usefulness for detecting
novel disease gene candidates and introduced new
sources of bias.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/55

Determining phylogenetic extent by looking at homologs
is also a potential source of bias as disease genes are better
characterized and more transcript evidence is available.
Imperfection in gene prediction is a major hindrance to
accurate orthology prediction [16]. On average, around a
third (~ 34%) of the predictive power of our classifier
comes from features related to phylogenetic extent.
There exists a possibility that the set of OMIM genes that
make up the training set is itself biased towards genes containing features which somehow make linking a disease to
an allele of that gene easier. However, we believe this to
be unlikely.
Firstly, it is important to remember that, at least with
Mendelian disorders, it has been the goal of identifying
the gene behind a particular common disease that has
driven research, not matching diseases to genes that are
easier to find, clone or characterize. Secondly, although
the OMIM database has been collecting information
about Mendelian disorders for many years the majority of
confirmed disease genes have been added more recently
after having been mapped and characterized with the help
of publicly available sequence data and modern molecular biology techniques – none of which are obviously
biased towards particular sequence features. Finally, given
the combined size (~ 1,700 genes) of the training and test
datasets it seems reasonable to assume that we are working with a representative sample of disease genes.
