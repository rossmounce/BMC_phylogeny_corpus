Abstract
Background: Small vagile eukaryotic organisms, which comprise a large proportion of the Earth's
biodiversity, have traditionally been thought to lack the extent of population structuring and
geographic speciation observed in larger taxa. Here we investigate the patterns of genetic diversity,
amongst populations of the salt lake microscopic metazoan Brachionus plicatilis s. s. (sensu stricto)
(Rotifera: Monogononta) on a global scale. We examine the phylogenetic relationships of
geographic isolates from four continents using a 603 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene to
investigate patterns of phylogeographic subdivision in this species. In addition we investigate the
relationship between genetic and geographic distances on a global scale to try and reconcile the
paradox between the high vagility of this species and the previously reported patterns of restricted
gene flow, even over local spatial scales.
Results: Analysis of global sequence diversity of B. plicatilis s. s. reveals the presence of four
allopatric genetic lineages: North American-Far East Asian, Western Mediterranean, Australian,
and an Eastern Mediterranean lineage represented by a single isolate. Geographically orientated
substructure is also apparent within the three best sampled lineages. Surprisingly, given this strong
phylogeographic structure, B. plicatilis s. s. shows a significant correlation between geographic and
genetic distance on a global scale ('isolation by distance' – IBD).
Conclusion: Despite its cosmopolitan distribution and potential for high gene flow, B. plicatilis s. s.
is strongly structured at a global scale. IBD patterns have traditionally been interpreted to indicate
migration-drift equilibrium, although in this system equilibrium conditions are incompatible with the
observed genetic structure. Instead, we suggest the pattern may have arisen through persistent
founder effects, acting in a similar fashion to geographic barriers for larger organisms. Our data
indicates that geographic speciation, contrary to historical views, is likely to be very important in
microorganisms. By presenting compelling evidence for geographic speciation in a small eukaryote
we add to the growing body of evidence that is forcing us to rethink our views of global biodiversity.

Background
Microscopic organisms have long been thought to occur
globally wherever suitable ecological conditions exist [1].

Such cosmopolitan distributions are considered to be the
consequence of large population sizes and high vagility
leading to increased rates of colonization and decreased

probabilities of population extinction in comparison to
macroscopic organisms [2]. However, recent genetic studies of microbial biogeography in cosmopolitan halophilic
bacteria, marine algae and fungi have challenged these
views, and indicate that, despite high vagility, microorganisms can be phylogeographically structured [3-6].
Therefore, microscopic organisms may exhibit biological
scaling rules similar to those operating on macroscopic
organisms; they can be dispersal-limited and have geographic isolation leading to local adaptation, and allopatric divergence [7,8].
Continental zooplanktonic species, including copepods,
cladocerans and rotifers, are small, microscopic organisms that disperse passively through diapausing propagules and are often found in large densities in ponds and
lakes. In consequence, they were thought to follow microbial rules of biogeography often summarized in the
phrase "Everything is everywhere, but, the environment
selects[9]." Despite being a life-long proponent of the
dominance of allopatric speciation Ernst Mayr, one of the
architects of the evolutionary synthesis, wrote:
"Probability of passive dispersal is increased by numerous
factors [...] such as small size, low specific gravity, protective coating, a dormant stage, and so forth. Species that are
optimal for all these factors may have world-wide ranges,
such as certain tardigrades, rotifers, and fresh-water crustaceans. A successful cosmopolitan with an essentially
panmictic species population is evidently barred from
geographic speciation [10]." This perception has persisted
almost unchanged until this century [11].
In striking contrast to these views, a paradigm shift seems
to be occurring, as illustrated by a number of recent phylogeographic and population structure analyses. These
studies uncover high levels of genetic structuring at a
regional scale amongst zooplankton populations, and
indicate very low levels of gene flow despite the high
potential for these organisms to disperse [12-17].
In this study, we investigate the patterns of genetic diversity found amongst populations of the euryhaline microscopic metazoan Brachionus plicatilis s. s. (sensu stricto)
(Rotifera: Monogononta) on a global scale using a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI or
cox1) gene. We try to reconcile the seemingly contradictory high vagility of this species with the observed patterns
of restricted gene flow, even over local spatial scales. Our
analysis of new and published data on mitochondrial
DNA sequence variation underscores the strong phylogeographic structure of B. plicatilis s. s. both between and
within continents, indicating the operation of incipient
allopatric speciation. In addition, and surprisingly, given
the non-equilibrium conditions and strong genetic drift

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/225

operating in the system, a strong correlation between
genetic and geographic distance is found. This paradoxical
situation suggests that the colonization process by itself
can create such patterns. Our results indicate that the evolutionary processes operating in small metazoans are similar to those known to be occurring in macro-organisms.
Our observations challenge the intuitive dogma that high
vagility leads to decreased biodiversity. As small eukaryotes constitute a remarkably diverse group, being amongst
the most numerous organisms on the planet [18], the
understanding of phylogeographical subdivision in such
taxa has profound consequences for the formulation and
interpretation of global patterns of biodiversity.

Results
Patterns of genetic variation and phylogenetic
relationships
Of the 36 Australian lakes sampled, 22 contained diapausing eggs belonging to the B. plicatilis species complex.
A total of 353 diapausing eggs were recovered and processed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the
COI fragment with 8 sites yielding 13 new B. plicatilis s. s.
sequences. To these, we added 30 additional sites from
previous studies, represented by 135 sequences [16,1921]. Given that some of the individuals previously
sequenced came from aquaculture facilities the geographic origin of two sequences could not be accurately
established, these sequences were removed from the dataset (Nhi1; [GenBank: AY785182] and Amami; [GenBank:
AY785174], [19]). The complete dataset represents 36
sites from around the world (Figure 1), with the 603 base
pair alignment collapsed to 52 haplotypes.

In total, the alignment contained 120 polymorphic sites,
89 of which were parsimony informative. The entire data
set displayed a high level of synonymous substitution
with only six polymorphic sites resulting in amino acid
substitutions in individuals from Hay Camp [GenBank:
AF499054], Laguna de las Eras [GenBank: AF266895],
Torreblanca Marsh Poza Norte [GenBank: AF266858],
Forgotten Lake [GenBank: AF499055, GenBank:
AF499056], all Western Australian sequences [GenBank:
EF524543–EF524555] and Grosbeak Lake [GenBank:
AF499057–AF499063, GenBank: AF499066–AF499069].
The model of nucleotide substitution that best fits the
data is the transition model with unequal base frequencies and rate variations among sites following a gamma
distribution (TIM + G shape parameter 0.18). Raw
sequence divergence (p-distance) ranged from 0.17% to
8.29% (0.16% to 11.91%, ML patristic distances).
The inferred phylogenetic relationship of B. plicatilis s. s.
haplotypes is shown in Figure 2. Both ML and Bayesian
phylogenetic methods retrieved the same gross topology

with well-supported main branches differing only in
minor rearrangements of the leaves (involving sequences
from Grosbeak Lake and Torreblanca Marsh). A strong
geographical orientation to the tree topology is evident,
with four geographically distinct clades (Figure 2). A first
clade was formed by all Australian sequences, a second
one containing North American and Far East Asian
sequences, a third one with an Eastern Mediterranean
sequence, and a fourth one with mostly Western Mediterranean sequences. Three exceptions to this geographic
patterning are apparent in the Western Mediterranean
clade. The first exception from the Caribbean (MEA; [GenBank: AY785189]) differed by a unique single base substitution from sequences found in several lakes on the
Iberian Peninsula (ATA, CAS, CLO, HOY, PET, SAL and
SLD; [GenBank: AF266929–AF266950]), while the second exception from the East coast in the USA (SAP; [GenBank: AY785187]) differed by four synonymous
substitutions from a Spanish haplotype (TUR; [GenBank:

AF266853–AF266855]), two of these substitutions were
unique to the Sapelo sequences. In both cases individuals
closely related to European populations are found in
Atlantic American locations. A third sequence (EIL; [GenBank: AY785188]) falls within this group although it was
sampled from the coast of the Red Sea. A pattern of geographic substructure is apparent within some of these lineages. The Australian clade contains Eastern and Western
groups and a strong substructure in the Western Mediterranean lineage is well illustrated within the Iberian Peninsula.
Analysis of association between genetic and geographic
distances

Consideration of the regression residuals revealed that the
largest deviation from the regression model was represented by pairwise comparisons involving two laboratory
kept clones (sites ATL and MEA see Figure 4 and Table 1).
In the case of ATL, a larger than expected genetic distance
was found, in the case of MEA a smaller than expected
genetic distance was found. Although natural events could
be responsible for this pattern, laboratory clones are
exposed to contamination and mislabelling problems.
Removal of all laboratory kept clones from the RMA analysis (representing 5 localities) markedly increased the correlation coefficient between geographic and genetic
distance (r2 = 0.91, P = < 0.01, y = 1.13 × 10-2 + 4.93 × 106x).

Discussion
Analysis of B. plicatilis s. s. mitochondrial sequences from
populations in eight countries reveals a strong positive
correlation between genetic and geographic distances in
this passively dispersed species. Such a pattern, usually
referred to as 'isolation by distance', is typically interpreted as indicative of migration-drift equilibrium [22],
and might even be expected given the traditional view that
large population sizes and high dispersal rates preclude
geographic speciation in small cosmopolitan species
[2,8,9,23]. However, it does not seem likely that this pattern is due to the global species having attained migration-drift equilibrium, as strong population genetic
differentiation even between nearby lakes has been dem-

onstrated in this species [16,17], and here we show extensive structuring of continental populations into
geographically restricted phylogenetic lineages. While
there is strong evidence for efficient dispersal capacity of
small organisms [24], there is a growing realisation that
continental and global zooplankton populations are far
from migration-drift equilibrium. Allozyme and microsatellite markers have shown that population subdivision
is often very strong in cladocerans, rotifers and anostracan
populations, indicating a large contribution of genetic
drift, and little effect of gene flow in population structure
[13,14,16,24-26]. Following Wright's island model [27],
migration-drift equilibrium would be extremely slow to
attain in organisms with large population sizes after a
founding event [12]. This is especially true of rotifers in

the B. plicatilis species complex where large resting egg
banks (2.9 – 13.6 × 104 eggs per m-2) [28] and high densities of adults in the water column (≈ 1.7 × 104 individuals.L-1)[29] are observed in natural populations. Given
their rapid reproductive rates and short generation times
newly colonized suitable habitats may be rapidly filled
following the arrival of a single propagule.
Instead of a migration-drift equilibrium scenario being
responsible for the 'isolation-by-distance' patterns we suggest instead that, in a similar way to humans [30], such
patterns can be generated not only in equilibrium conditions, but through colonization patterns and drift when
colonization is from nearby populations. In this alternative scenario, dispersal vectors work more successfully

across small distances with newly formed habitats being
more often colonized from local sources. In addition resident population numbers and diapausing egg banks act
as an effective buffer to dispersal by way of intraspecific
competitive exclusion, indicating that established populations are the major barrier to dispersal. This barrier to dispersal has been described as the Monopolization
Hypothesis by De Meester et al. [24] who also indicated
that local adaptation may enhance the buffering capacity
of a resident population against migration.
Interestingly, populations exhibiting positive or negative
residuals in the RMA regression may represent either similar or quite divergent scenarios. Those populations that
display negative residuals, as their pairwise comparisons
indicate a larger than expected geographic distance for
their genetic divergence, are likely to be the result of longdistance migration or belong to populations that have
experienced range expansions. Such a situation is exemplified by the sequences from Sapelo (SAP; [GenBank:
AY785187]) and especially Grand Cayman Island (MEA;
[GenBank: AY785189]) that appear to have originated
from Spain or North Africa. Conversely, populations having positive residuals, including mainly pairwise comparisons involving Spanish populations, but also ATL in the
Eastern Mediterranean, exhibit greater than expected
genetic distances for their geographic distance. These samples may represent a situation whereby regional populations have started to undergo geographic and reproductive
separation. Alternatively, historical habitat fragmentation
with recent recolonisation from refugia may account for
these outliers, potentially located near the contact zones
between divergent lineages. This inference is supported by
Gómez et al. [16] who suggested that early Pleistocene
fragmentation of B. plicatilis s. s. populations was characterized by reduced gene flow and occasional long distance
dispersal in the Iberian Peninsula, a pattern that would be
consistent with post glacial colonization of this area from
two refugia, perhaps one in Spain itself and the other in
Northern Africa.
Consideration of the regression residuals revealed that a
large proportion of deviation from the regression model
was accounted for by some laboratory kept clones (Figures 3 and 4). It cannot be discounted that some of the
original clones may have been cross contaminated or mislabelled during many years of maintenance in the laboratory. However, even if this might have been the case, the
pattern we found remains strong, and the possible sources
of error do not detract from a robust pattern. For this reasons even though "wild" populations of microscopic
metazoans should be favoured over those from laboratory
sources in future research, the information added by laboratory populations remains highly valuable.

A consequence of dispersal barriers, whether due to habitat monopolization or other processes, is geographic subdivision likely leading to allopatric speciation. Although
largely excluded as an important process in small cosmopolitan organisms until recently, it is becoming clear that
microscopic and macroscopic organisms may not have
such radically different responses to evolutionary forces.
Although population genetic divergence can be a good
indicator of reproductive isolation [31], such correlations
can rarely be included in phylogeographic studies due to
the difficulty of their measurement. Reproductive isolation experiments in B. plicatilis s. s. have shown a steady
and significant decline of fertilization success at relatively
low genetic distances of less than 8% COI divergence
(Suatoni et al. unpublished manuscript). In light of this
decay of reproductive compatibility, the pattern of genetic
divergence we observe on a global scale has evolutionary
significance, most likely indicating incipient geographic
speciation. This is especially true when we consider that
the most distantly separated populations of B. plicatilis s.
s. exhibit a COI p-distance of 8.29%, which approaches
the level of divergence between species in the B. plicatilis
species complex [21].
Brachionus plicatilis s. s. global populations are divided
into a minimum of four mitochondrial lineages that are
geographically structured in a nearly continental fashion:
Australian, Western Mediterranean, Eastern Mediterranean and North America-Far East. We are aware that large
geographic regions containing salt lakes have not been
sampled for this species, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa
and Central Asia. Sampling of other areas is sparse, so the
diversity we have uncovered is likely to be a subset of that
in B. plicatilis s. s. An isolated sample from the Eastern
Mediterranean (Atlit, Israel) forms a fourth lineage, which
appears as the basal branch to the Western Mediterranean
group and this could possibly represent the distribution
limits of otherwise unsampled African or Asian lineages.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated a strong global signal of IBD in a
passively dispersing species with a discontinuous patchy
habitat, very large population sizes, and pronounced local
genetic structuring. We conclude however that this does
not indicate that migration drift equilibrium has been
attained, but rather that it is likely to have been produced
through the colonization process. Contrary to the failing
paradigm prevalent in the literature since Darwin's time
[32], even potentially dispersive microscopic cosmopolitan organisms can achieve substantial geographic subdivision. This subdivision can commonly lead to reproductive
incompatibility. Although the number of cosmopolitan
micro-species examined for phylogeographic structure is
still very small, we suggest that it would be very unwise to
assume a priori that radically different evolutionary proc-

esses are operating on their phylogeography than those on
macro-organisms. Furthermore, geographic components
of intraspecific diversity need to be more closely considered in future studies involving microorganisms, especially when considering levels of global biodiversity. This
is likely to manifest in the recognition of cryptic species
complexes within taxa traditionally thought to be cosmopolitan.

Methods
Study species
Brachionus plicatilis s. s. is part of a relatively well-known
species complex that is composed of more than a dozen
species as elucidated by morphological, phylogenetic and
reproductive isolation experiments [19,21,33]. Brachionus
plicatilis s. s. is a cyclical parthenogen with sexual reproduction giving rise to dormant diapausing eggs (90–150
μm long). As in other zooplankton, these eggs are resilient
to desiccation and environmental insults [28,34] and may
be passively transported for long distances [35]. B. plicatilis s. s. has been found inhabiting estuaries, lagoons, rivers
and saline lakes around the world with no records in the
open ocean. The primary habitats for the species complex
are salt lakes that have no connection with a sea or ocean,
occurring in endorheic basins [36] (Figure 1). Such lakes
are often shallow and subject to considerable environmental fluctuations across several temporal scales, ranging from near fresh through hyper-saline, and from
permanent through seasonal, thus representing a mosaic
of extreme island-like habitats.
Sample collection and diapausing egg isolation
To add to the database of B. plicatilis s.s. mitochondrial
COI sequences already available, particularly from North
America and Western Europe, we collected soil sediments
from 36 saline or brackish water bodies from the Australian continent between January 2002 and May 2004. Sampling focused on south west Australia, with several
additional sites from eastern Australia. The south west
Australian sites had been previously indicated by the
Department of Conservation and Land Management
(CALM) as containing members of the B. plicatilis species
complex [37] and thus were chosen as good candidates for
the retrieval of diapausing eggs.

Sampling diapausing egg banks has been acknowledged
as a cost-effective and efficient technique for assessing a
site's total diversity, especially in fluctuating environments where closely related species can be involved in seasonal succession and preferential hatching mediated by
habitat state can lead to sampling bias [28,38-41]. To
maximize the chance of obtaining a representative collection of the sampled lakes' diapausing egg bank, and hence
genetic diversity, samples from the superficial sediment,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/225

to a depth of approximately 2 cm, were collected at various pooling points within each lake.
Diapausing eggs were recovered with a sugar flotation
method [42] modified from Gómez and Carvalho [38].
Four replicate samples of sediment, each with an approximate sediment volume of 25 cc, were suspended in 40
mL of 1.75 molar sucrose solution in a 50 mL tube. These
samples were then centrifuged at 100 G for 5 minutes. The
resulting supernatant was poured through a 45 μm poresize nylon mesh, and washed with distilled water. Residual particulate matter was washed into a Petri dish containing distilled water where individual diapausing eggs
were located and collected using a 10 μL pipette tip under
a dissecting microscope.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
In preparation for DNA extraction, diapausing eggs were
washed three times in distilled water, by way of serial
transfer between Petri dishes, placed in individual sterile
200 μL centrifuge tubes containing 35 μL of InstaGene
Matrix [Bio-Rad Laboratories] and had their contents
released by crushing them against the side of the tube. The
samples were then heated to 56°C for 20 min, 100°C for
10 min, and then cooled at 4°C for 30 min. All DNA
extractions were stored at 4°C until needed.

A 712 bp fragment of the COI gene was amplified by PCR
with LCO1490 and HCO2198 primers [43] for each individual sample. Reactions were prepared in a 10 μL volume
containing 1× PCR Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs,
2.5 pMol or both COI primers, 0.125 units of Taq (Bioline) polymerase, and 2 μL of the supernatant of the DNA
extraction. Samples were then subjected to the following
thermocycling profile: 1 cycle of 3 minutes at 93°C, 40
cycles of 15 seconds at 92°C, 20 seconds at 50°C, and 1
minute at 70°C, with a final incubation of 3 minutes at
72°C.
PCR products were sequenced on a CEQ 8000 Genetic
Analysis System (Beckman Coulter Laboratories) using
CEQ DTCS (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing) Quick
Start Kits (Beckman Coulter Laboratories) and CEQ LPA1 (linear polyacrylamide) denaturing gel, following ethanol precipitation and cleanup. Complementary strands of
DNA were sequenced and all inconsistencies and polymorphisms were manually checked against original chromatograms in CodonCode Aligner v 1.3.4 (CodonCode
Corporation). All B. plicatilis s. s. COI sequences were
deposited in GenBank's International Sequence Databases [GenBank: EF524543–EF524555].
In addition B. plicatilis s. s. COI sequences from previous
studies [16,19-21] were used in the analysis [GenBank:
AF266853–AF266883, AF266885–AF266950, AF387244–

and AY785183–AY785193].
Phylogenetic reconstruction
We carried out a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
reconstruction implemented in PHYML [44], using the
model of nucleotide substitution estimated from log-likelihood parameters following the Akaike information criterion in ModelGenerator [45]. Support for the topology
was tested using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. In
addition, a Bayesian analysis was conducted to obtain a
phylogenetic reconstruction with posterior probabilities
for nodes using 2,000,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo
generations in MrBayes 3.1.1 [46]. Summaries of this
analysis were derived with a burnin value determined by
the asymptotic convergence of two independent runs as
noted by the average standard deviation of the split frequencies sampled every 100 generations.
Analysis of association between genetic and geographic
distances
Raw COI p-distances were calculated in PAUP* [47],
while patristic distances were taken from the tree derived
from the PHYML ML analysis using PATRISTIC [48]. For
lakes containing more than one haplotype, averages of
pairwise genetic distances were calculated with equal
weighting given to haplotypes as sampling bias is likely to
have been high due to sites being represented by only a
few individuals.

Distances between field sites were estimated using the
great arc formulae for calculating distances on a spheroid,
with a value of 6371.01 km as the mean radius of the
Earth [49]. For all sequences of known geographic origin
decimal longitudes and latitudes were recorded with the
aid of virtual Globe [50]. The distance between locations
in kilometers was calculated with the following formula:
Distance = 6371.01 × ACOS [COS[RADIANS[90-lat1]] ×
COS [RADIANS[90-lat2]] + SIN [RADIANS[90-lat1]] ×
SIN [RADIANS[90-lat2]] × COS [RADIANS[long1long2]]]
Where lat1 and lat2 are the latitudes of two given sites, 1
and 2, and long1 and long2 are the longitudes of these
two sites. In order for the equation to function correctly,
southern latitudes and eastern longitudes were entered as
negative decimal values while positive decimal values
were assigned to northern latitudes and western longitudes. The error of great circle calculations is <1% of the
given estimate for the entire globe across all scales.
Reduced major axis (RMA) linear regression between
genetic and geographic distances was performed on corrected COI distances, TIM + G as selected by ModelGener-

ator [45], for the entire dataset. As the regression
contained multiple pairwise comparisons the Mantel test
for significance was employed with 100,000 randomizations. The 99% Confidence intervals were also estimated
with 100,000 bootstraps over independent population
pairs. All regression related analyses were carried out in
IBD v1.52 [51].
