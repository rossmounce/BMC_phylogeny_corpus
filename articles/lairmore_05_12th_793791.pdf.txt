Abstract
The 12th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV and Related Retroviruses, was
held at the Half Moon Hotel in Montego Bay, Jamaica, from June 22nd to June 25th 2005. The
scientific conference, sponsored by the International Retrovirology Association, is held biennially
at rotating international venues around the world. The meeting brings together basic scientists,
epidemiologists and clinical researchers to discuss findings to prevent HTLV infection or develop
new therapies against HTLV-mediated diseases. The Association fosters the education and training
of young scientists to bring new approaches to the complex problems of HTLV research, such as
translational research to bring findings from the laboratory into clinical trials that benefit HTLVinfected patients. The breadth and quality of research presentations and workshops at the 12th
International Conference indicate that these goals are being accomplished. As HTLV research
enters its third decade a new generation of scientists face many challenges. However, HTLV
scientists and clinicians displayed exciting new approaches and discoveries during plenary talks and
poster sessions. The conference encouraged research in HTLV infections and disease, fostered
collaborations, and stimulated new partnerships between clinicians and scientists to encourage
clinical trials and novel therapeutic interventions.

Findings
Jamaica and the International HTLV Conference
The International Retrovirology Association in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health and the University of the West Indies, Jamaica welcomed over 300
scientists from diverse disciplines to the 12th International
Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV and Related
Retroviruses, held at the Half Moon Hotel in Montego
Bay, Jamaica, from June 22nd to June 25th 2005. The Association was established in May 1994 to promote informal
discussions among established human T-lymphotropic

viruses (HTLV) scientists to enhance the efforts of scientists and clinicians to form interdisciplinary groups to
study HTLV and its related diseases in a cooperative and
creative manner. The Association sponsors its biennial
general scientific conferences at rotating international
venues, generally in areas with endemic HTLV infection.
This unique meeting brings together basic scientists, epidemiologists and clinical researchers in a free form
exchange of data to discuss approaches to prevent HTLV
infection or develop new therapies against HTLV-mediated diseases. The Association has focused its internaPage 1 of 6

tional meeting on HTLV and other related human and
nonhuman primate retroviruses, to promote excellent science and to facilitate the communication of scientific
results. Equally important, the Association fosters the education and training of young scientists to bring new
approaches to the complex problems of HTLV research,
such as translational research to bring findings from the
laboratory into clinical trials that benefit HTLV-infected
patients. Judging from the breadth and quality of research
presentations and workshops at the 12th International
Conference, these goals are being accomplished.
HTLV research enters its third decade with the challenge to
bring a new generation of scientists to the challenges facing the field [1]. Many of the scientists attending the meeting were from developing countries where HTLV is
endemic. It was particularly relevant that the conference
was held in context to the 25th anniversary of the discovery
of the first identified human retrovirus, HTLV-1. Scientists
in this field of research have many new discoveries to
energize their work, many of which were on display during the meeting as plenary talks or during poster sessions.
The conference encouraged research in HTLV infections
and disease and fostered collaborations between research
groups. Importantly, the conference through its many
workshops provided a setting to stimulate new partnerships between clinicians and scientists to encourage the
development of clinical trials and novel interventions.
Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and the
closely related HTLV-2 were the first human retroviruses
discovered [2]. HTLV-1, is a member of the deltaretrovirus
genera, and infects approximately 15 to 20 million people
around the world [3]. HTLV-1 infection occurs worldwide, but is particularly endemic in Central Africa, the
Caribbean, and South America and southwestern Japan,
while HTLV-2 is endemic among Indian tribes of South,
Central, and North America. The virus causes adult T cell
leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an aggressive malignancy of
CD4+ T lymphocytes in 1 to 5% of infected individuals
that is refractory to most therapies [4]. HTLV-1 is also
associated with a progressive neurologic disease termed
HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases including infectious dermatitis, uveitis, and
arthropathy [5,6]. The following summarizes selected key
presentations at the 12th International Conference on
Human Retrovirology, but is by no measure a comprehensive overview of all of the exciting findings from the conference and we apologize in advance to those investigators
we have not mentioned in an effort to provide a concise
summary of the meeting.

Molecular Epidemiology of HTLV Infections:
New Insights
Reports of well characterized cohorts by Dr. Edward Murphy of the University of San Francisco (United States)
began the meeting with a clear challenge to carefully
examine the relationship between viral loads and disease
outcomes. Data from these groups suggest that a "set
point" of viral load is determined in each individual studied based on their ability to form an effective early
immune response to the infection. Risk factors for the
transmission of HTLV-1 from infected mothers to their
children based on HLA haplotype was presented by Dr.
Robert Biggar and colleagues (National Institutes of
Health, United States), who illustrated how immune recognition may determine rates of viral transmission.
A highlight of this session included Dr. Masao Matsuoka's
and colleagues' (Kyoto University, Japan) recent findings
related to the functional significance of an anti-sense message that codes for the protein HBZ and the role of methylation in the control of HTLV-1 gene expression. His
group provided data to indicate that proviral DNA in cell
lines derived from ATLL patients was highly methylated
correlating with low or absent HTLV-1 gene expression.
Unlike the 5' LTR of proviral DNA and the coding region
and the 3' LTR was not heavily methylated in these same
cells. The expression of HBZ mRNA, but not those encoding other viral genes such as tax, was detected in all the
fresh ATL samples, strongly suggesting that HBZ has a significant role in leukemic cell survival in vivo. These findings were further supported subsequently in the meeting
by Dr. Eric Wattel (Lyon Rhone, France) who also found
correlation between proviral loads in patients with HBZ
mRNA expression. In addition, it appears that HBZ
expression had a growth stimulating influence on ATL
cells. Transfection of HBZ expressing plasmids in an IL-2
dependent human T-cell line augmented the cell line
growth and inhibition of HBZ expression by siRNA interference reduced cell growth of ATL-derived cell lines.
Finally, transgenic mice containing HBZ gene under the
control of a CD4 promoter exhibited an increased
number of CD4+ spleen-derived T-cells. Dr. Matsuoka
proposed that HBZ and Tax act synergistically to transform CD4+ T-cells eventually leading to the development
of ATLL. Since HBZ, but not Tax is expressed in ATL cells
in vivo, this unique anti-sense encoded nonstructural protein may represent a promising therapeutic target in ATLL
patients. Later in the meeting, the HBZ encoding region
was further characterized and mapped to reveal new start
sites for the anti-sense transcript by Dr. M. Cavanagh and
colleagues (CHUL Research Center, Canada). Collectively, these presentations provide new insights into the
complex interaction between HTLV-1 and virus replication and lymphocyte survival.

An exciting summary of recently published findings about
novel nucleotide sequences of human retroviruses, HTLV3 and HTLV-4 were summarized by Dr. William Switzer of
the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These researchers used polymerase chain detection
to discover evidence of two related HTLVs (named HTLV3 and HTLV-4). The first group directed by Switzer investigated 930 central Africans with contact with nonhuman
primate blood through hunting and butchering. Serological tests and partial DNA sequencing of blood samples
showed that two humans were infected with novel
viruses, designated HTLV-3 and HTLV-4. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that HTLV-3 is originated from a known
monkey virus STLV-3 through cross-species transmission,
while a corresponding monkey virus to HTLV-4 has not
been reported yet and genetically equidistant from all
known HTLVs/STLVs. The second group directed by Dr.
Antoine Gessain (Pasteur Institute, France) tested serum
specimens or DNA from 240 subjects from Cameroon to
provide suggestive evidence that an HTLV-3 related to
STLV-3 was present in individuals exposed to nonhuman
primate blood or tissues. Importantly, these findings suggest that cross species transmission between nonhuman
primates and humans is ongoing where people are
exposed to primate blood and tissues [7,8]. A challenge to
researchers in the field in the coming years will be to fully
characterize these new viruses in terms of complete
genomic sequences and to identify replication or pathogenic mechanisms of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 compared to
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.

Basic Biology: Novel Mechanisms of
Transformation and Disease
The study of HTLV-1 Tax initiated the concept that complex retroviruses regulate their expression by producing
transactivating proteins. The mechanisms used by HTLV1 Tax to alter cell cycle regulation or cell division, as in
past meetings, continued to dominate the basic biology
sessions of the 2005 meeting. Dr. Jennifer Nyborg (Colorado State University, United States) provided an overview of how the well-studied transactivating protein of
HTLV-1, Tax, promotes viral transcription from the chromosomally-integrated HTLV-1 promoter. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Dr. Nyborg's group
provided data that the promoter activation by Tax1 correlated with the apparent loss of nucleosomes from the promoter and coding region. These results suggest that the
Tax functions by causing nucleosome removal from the
HTLV-1 promoter. Later in the meeting, by using in vitro
transcription using "chromatinized" templates, Dr. Fatah
Kashanchi (George Washington University, United States)
presented complementary data indicating that Tax converts the randomly-assembled nucleosomes into periodic
assembled ones, and this periodic assembly of the nucleosomes correlated with the activation of HTLV-1 pro-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/61

moter by Tax. His group has previously demonstrated that
Tax recruits SWI/SNF complex containing BRG1 on the
HTLV-1 promoter, and the recruitment is essential for the
transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 promoter [9]. Thus,
SWI/SNF containing BRG1 may play a role in the reassemble of nucleosomes with the HTLV-1 promoter. Dr. Susan
Marriott (Baylor University, United States) provided new
data on the effects of HTLV-1 Tax on cell cycle progression
and genomic instability. Tax appears to increase genomic
instability by altered key checkpoints in the cell cycle. Her
work has focused on the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle.
Dr. Kuan-Teh Jeang (National Institutes of Health, United
States) presented data that continued this theme of the
meeting. His new findings suggest that Tax interacts with
the Ran-GTP network to cause abnormal amplification of
cellular centrosomes, which may be an initial event of
cancer caused by the virus. Dr. Patrick Green (Ohio State
University, United States) furthered this subject area by
providing new information about the role of the antisense encoded protein, PDZ-binding motif of Tax in
induction of micronuclei, a hallmark of genomic instability. Dr. Chou-Zen Giam (Uniformed Services University,
United States) reported that "unscheduled" activation by
the Cdc20-associated anaphase promoting complex by
HTLV-1 Tax induces mitotic dysfunction and inactivation
of critical regulators of mitosis. This presentations overall
solidified the concept that the acquisition of genetic and
epigenetic changes in Tax-expressing T cells favors the
selection of cells with mutated proviral DNA in a manner
to favor eventual outgrowth of the transformed cell in a
way that avoids immune system recognition. Collectively,
the precise role of Tax in cellular transformation was a
major theme of the basic science sections of the meeting.
Dr. Warner Greene (Gladstone Institute, United States)
provided a stimulating plenary talk about the role of
APOBEC 3G (A3G), a cellular deoxycytidine deaminase
with broad anti-retroviral activity. Dr. Greene summarized what is currently understood about A3G, which is
inactive as a high-molecular-weight ribonucleoprotein
complex in activated CD4 T-cells, but is active in lowmolecular-weight complexes in resting CD4 T-cells. Resting CD4+ T-cells are typically resistance for HIV-1 infection, but the resistance was greatly relieved by A3Gspecific siRNAs that block A3G function. Surprisingly,
sequence analysis showed rare dG-dA hypermutations, a
signature of A3G-mediated inhibition, in infected CD4 Tcells. Thus, A3G may have another mechanism to inhibit
HIV infection. Dr. Greene suggested that deaminase activity may have a broader role and perhaps may influence
HTLV-1's ability to infected CD4+ T-cells, a preferred natural target of HTLV-1 infection in vivo. In this regard, Dr.
David Derse and colleagues (National Cancer Institute,
United States) at the meeting reported that exogenous

Retrovirology 2005, 2:61

overexpression of APOBEC 3B (A3G) also inhibited
HTLV-1 infectivity. A3G was incorporated into HTLV-1
virions, but the amount was much less than that of HIV-1
stains that lack the ability to inactive the cellular co-factor
(HIV Vif defective). Interestingly, HTLV-1 does not appear
to have vif-like gene in its genome, but data presented
from Dr. Derse suggested that the HTLV-1 structural gene,
gag contained sequences that act to inhibit A3G incorporation into HTLV-1 virions. Thus, HTLV-1 may overcome
A3G anti-retroviral activity through gag-mediated exclusion of A3G. Consistently with these results are findings
that indicate that there are rare dG-dA hypermutations
among HTLV-1 isolates.

Clinical and Translational Research: New
Approaches in Therapy
The meeting brought together a variety of clinicians seeking better treatments against ATLL and HAM/TSP. Dr.
Thomas Waldmann (National Institutes of Health,
United States), a pioneer in the field of therapeutic
approaches against ATLL, provided a summary of the role
of IL-15 in T-cell signaling and his groups recent findings
involving Hu-Mik-Beta-1 (HM-beta) to block β-chain signaling following IL-15 receptor engagement. This
approach may provide exciting new avenues to inhibit
lymphocyte-mediated disorders such as HAM/TSP. Clinical trials using the potent immunosuppresive agent Campath-1H (anti-CD52) was presented by Dr. J.C. Morris
(National Institutes of Health, United States). HTLV-1
Leukemic patients appeared to respond well to Campath1H, despite its adverse side effects. A key factor in nonresponsive ATL lymphoma patients appears to be the difficulties with drug penetration of solid tissues.
HTLV-1 Tax has been shown to interact directly with different members of the NF-κB family [10]. Interference
with post-translational modifications of Tax including
ubiquitylation and sumoylation by proteasome inhibition was presented by Dr. Ali Bazarbachi and colleagues
(American University, Beirut, Lebanon) as effective ways
to block NF-κB signaling, a key pathway of Tax-mediated
cell transformation. Dr. Lee Ratner (Washington University, United States) presented new data regarding his
novel transgenic mouse model. His new work indicates
from this model indicates that both the canonical and
non-canonical pathways of NF-κB activation are involved
in resistance to apoptotic stimuli in Tax transgenic mouse
derived cell lines.
Novel treatments continue to be a focus of researchers in
the HTLV and related retrovirus field. Dr. Luc Willems and
colleagues
(Faculte
Universitaire
des
Sciences
Agronomiques, Belgium) using their established bovine
leukemia virus infection of sheep model, revealed new
approaches to treatment of leukemia using the drug, val-

proate. This treatment was shown to be effective in
decreasing lymphocyte numbers and tumor regression in
this model system.

Educational and Technical Workshops: Bringing
Scientists together to Address Complex
Problems
A particularly interactive portion of the meeting were the
educational and technical workshops held offsite at the
Barnett Estates, a serene setting that promoted scientific
exchange. Morning workshops discussed the epidemiology, animal models, immunology, and basic virology of
HTLV and related viruses. These group sessions were spirited and were lead by scientist who provided an excellent
overview of their fields before leading the discussion of
selected topics of interest to the group. These sessions
allowed a more informal exchange of ideas and unpublished data, a goal of any scientific meeting. New virus
strains including HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 characterized by
molecular signatures were the subject of many conversations. Current strengths of weakness or gaps in the literature dominated many sessions as participants provided
their interpretation of recent published or new data at the
early plenary sessions. These workshops were extended in
the afternoon to include important and clinically focused
sessions based on HTLV disease associations. Thus, workshops devoted to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, infectious dermatitis, and HTLV-1 neurologic disease allowed
scientist to debate current approaches and how clinical trials could be evaluated and improved. Overall, these workshops provided a dynamic interaction among scientists
and clinicians, which were apparent when patient case
studies were included to focus the discussions.

Viral Pathogenesis: Interplay between HTLV's
and Lymphocytes
Dr. Masahiro Fujii and colleagues (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan) reported data using co-transfection assays of
Tax expression plasmids with luciferase reporters to test
the functional differences between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2
Tax [11]. This group's results suggest that IL-2 autocrine
secretion establishes benign life-long HTLV-2 infection
and the distinct cytokine production regulated by the
nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a key factor for
the distinct differences in disease association between
these two related viruses. Further insights into the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection was provided by Dr. Brian
Wigdahl (Drexel University, United States) who provided
provocative data indicating that Tax is not only secreted
from infected cells, but can differentially modulate the
function of dendritic cells and astrocytes. This work may
provide a unique mechanism of neurologic damage by
HTLV-1. Dr. Renaud Mahieux and colleagues (Institut
Pasteur, France) continued to implicate unique molecular
features that differentiate HTLV-1 Tax (Tax-1) from HTLV-

2 Tax (Tax-2). Tax-2 appears to have a distinct cytoplasmic
distribution compared to Tax-1. Futures studies to define
the role of particular motifs that may explain the pathogenic differences between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 will be
directed at these important regulatory proteins.
Dr Claudine Pique and colleagues (Saint Louis Hospital,
Paris, France) presented new findings that neuropilin 1
(NP-1), a receptor for Sematophorin 3a and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), acts as a co-factor for
HTLV-1 entry. NP-1 directly interacted with HTLV-1 envelope protein. There appears to be two separable domains
in the HTLV-1 envelope that are required for the virus
entry. While one domain is a binding surface for GLUT-1,
a recently identified HTLV-1 receptor, the other was that
for NP-1. NP-1, GLUT-1 and the envelope proteins appear
to form a ternary complex on the cell surface. These results
argued that HTLV-1 has two cellular receptors for the viral
entry into host cells similar to HIV-1.

Conclusions and Perspective
The meeting concluded with poignant remarks by one of
the pioneering epidemiologist in the field of HTLV
research, Dr. Nancy Mueller (Harvard, United States). She
provided appropriate context to past studies of cohorts of
HTLV-1 infected subjects, disease associations, and the
useful applications of carefully controlled populationbased studies. As the meeting came to a close, it was clear
that HTLV and related retrovirus researchers faces many
challenges, which confound and frustrate scientists in the
HTLV field. However, the 12th International Conference
on Human Retrovirology illustrated the dedication of the
many scientists, clinicians, and patient advocates to
address these challenges with a new determination and
energy, as they all reluctantly left the gracious atmosphere
of Jamaica to travel back to their homes, laboratories and
offices throughout the world.

List of Abbreviations
HTLV, human T-lymphotropic viruses

Dr. Steven Jacobson (National Institutes of Health,
United States) presented new information about the
intriguing findings related to regulatory T-cells (CD4+,
CD25+, Foxp3+) in the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-1associated neurologic disease. Interestingly, his research
group found that Tax specifically inhibits foxp3 expression, which would be predicted to suppress the function
of these important regulatory T-cells, perhaps contributing to lymphocyte-driven diseases. Dr. Charles Bangham
(University of London, United Kingdom) and his research
group continue to lead the field of cellular immunity
against HTLV-1 infection. His presentation provided
novel insights into the efficiency of cytotoxic T-cell killing
as a key determinant of patient viral load outcome and
data describing unique lymphocyte labeling techniques
(6,6-D(2)-glucose) to monitor the kinetics of lymphocyte
proliferation and death in HTLV-1-infected subjects.
The role of nonstructural proteins including proteins
included in pX ORFs 1 and 2 were featured by a number
of investigators. Dr. Franchini's research group (National
Cancer Institute, United States) presented work indicating
that p12I is recruited to the immunological synapse and
inhibits signaling from the T-cell receptor. Dr. Vincenzo
Ciminale (University of Padova, Padova, Italy) provided
an update of his research of a novel mitochondrial localizing protein p13II in modifying lymphocyte survival and
apoptotic cell death. Dr. Michael Lairmore and his colleagues (Ohio State University, United States) provided
new information on the role of p30II in modifying G2 exit
of the cell cycle furthering implicating this protein in lymphocyte survival.
