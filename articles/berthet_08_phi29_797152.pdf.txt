Abstract
Background: Phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified DNA with
minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus
detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase
cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (<2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription
of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29
polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen)
to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA).
Results: WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity
of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 × 107 using
WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 μg/μl or 1010 target copies. The
amplification factor varied between 109 and 106. We also demonstrated that co-amplification
occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA.
Conclusion: This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA
(WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes. Amplifying viral RNA
by WTA provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random
RT-PCR.

Background
Parallelization of nucleic acid sequence detection requires
a sufficient quantity (in the microgram range) of DNA for
subsequent hybridization-based methods such as those
using DNA microarrays or resequencing arrays. For RNA
virus detection, target DNA represents the amplified product of reverse transcription (RT). RT and DNA amplification can be achieved either by using primers specific for
relevant viruses or by random priming. Although random
priming can amplify an unknown target, it often yields
lower amounts of DNA than specific primers, which can
reduce the overall sensitivity of the process. Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) using bacteriophage
phi29 polymerase with random primers allows DNA synthesis in amounts compatible with the downstream use of
DNA microarrays [1]. Moreover, MDA has the potential to
amplify the whole DNA genome (whole genome amplification, WGA) of target pathogens in the presence of contaminating DNA. WGA technology has become a useful
upfront amplification method for many biomedical
applications, such as microsatellite analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection and comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) to microarrays. We
recently showed that WGA can now be used for DNA viral
pathogen detection from clinical samples using resequencing microarrays [2]. Indeed, resequencing technology using microarrays is very promising for bacterial and
viral pathogen detection and identification, as well as for
the determination of their pathogenicity profile [2-5].
However, MDA cannot be used to amplify RNA nor small
cDNA obtained from RNA genomes after reverse transcription or small native DNA fragments such as those
generated by RT from segmented riboviral genomes.
Therefore, MDA has not been previously used with riboviruses. A novel modified MDA approach by Qiagen designated QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome has been
developed for Transcriptome studies. We changed the
process by using a different reverse transcription strategy
containing random primers instead of a mixture of random and oligo-dT primers and a different reverse transcriptase. In this WTA process, after reverse transcription
of RNA utilizing random primers, all cDNAs are being
ligated together into longer linear chains allowing concatenated cDNAs from small RNA fragments to be used as
templates for MDA. We applied WTA to viral RNA and
demonstrated that WTA is applicable for cDNA amplification of a whole range of RNA virus genomes, prior to DNA
hybridization based techniques. About half a dozen
approaches have been developed for random whole
genome amplification upstream of SNP detection methods (e.g. Omniplex® technology [6], DOP-PCR [7,8], LAPCR [9,10], PCR with universal linker [11] and T7 based
linear amplification for genomic DNA [12]). Among
them, WGA and Random Amplification (RA) based on
random RT and random PCR are the most widespread

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/77

techniques for the detection and identification using DNA
microarrays. In this study, we chose to compare WTA and
RA. The final DNA yields generated by RA and by WTA, in
the absence or presence of prokaryotic DNA, were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The accuracy of identification by high-density microarrays was also compared
between RA and WTA processes.

Methods
RNA extraction
Total RNA from brain biopsies (5–10 mg) were obtained
using 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other RNA
extraction was performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Synthesis of viral RNA complementary strand
The complementary strand (cDNA) of extracted viral RNA
was performed in a 200 μl tube. The primer used for RA
was described by Wang et al [13] whereas cDNA synthesis
for WTA was performed with random hexamer primers at
the same concentration except for the influenza B virus
experiment where the final concentration was diluted 10fold. A mix with 8 μl of RNA, 1 μl of primer (50 μM) and
1 μl of dNTPs (10 mM) was incubated at 75°C for 5 min,
cooled on ice for 5 min. Then, 10 μl of 2 × enzyme mix
were added. This enzyme mix was composed of 2 μl of 10
× RT Buffer for SSIII (Invitrogen Inc.), 4 μl of 25 mM
MgCl2, 2 μl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 μl of 40 U/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen Inc.), 1 μl of Reverse Transcriptase SuperScript III
(Invitrogen Inc.) and 0.5 μl of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich).
The final mix was submitted to the following steps: 25°C
for 10 min, 45°C for 90 min and 95°C for 5 min. All
cDNAs were stored at -20°C or immediately used.
Viral RNA amplification based on the Random
Amplification method (RA)
After the synthesis of the complementary strand, a secondstrand DNA synthesis was carried out with the addition of
10 μl of Klenow mix, consisting of 3 μl of 10 × Klenow
Buffer, 2 μl of dNTP (0.5 mM each) and 1 μl of Klenow
DNA polymerase I (Biolabs). The final 30 μl mix was incubated at 20°C for 20 min and at 95°C for 5 min. Subsequently, 15 μl of the resulting double stranded DNA was
used as template for a 40 cycle PCR with Primer E as previously described by Wang et al [13] except the addition of
0.5 μl of DMSO and the use of TaKaRa DNA polymerase
(5 U/μl) instead of Taq DNA polymerase.
Viral RNA amplification based on "Whole Transcriptome
Amplification" kit (WTA)
Viral RNA amplification was performed as described in
the protocol of the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit
(Qiagen) except for the cDNA synthesis step. It was
replaced by the reverse transcription protocol as described

above. The two following steps were performed according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen).
Co-amplification of RNA and DNA pathogens
The amplification of viral RNA and bacterial DNA as mentioned above was based on the WTA amplification process
as described above except that, after the ligation step, a
nucleic acid denaturation was performed by adding 2 μl of
denaturating solution available in Repli-g MIDI kit (Qiagen) and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. After
that, the final amplification step was performed according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen).
Identification and quantification by RT-qPCR for Rift
Valley Fever Virus
To identify Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), RT-qPCR was
performed with the primers published by Drosten et al.
[14] but using LC RNA Amplification kit SYBRGreen I
(Roche Diagnostic) and different RT and PCR cycling conditions. The detection and quantification involved the following steps: reverse transcription at 55°C for 10 min,
initial denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, and 45 cycles with
95°C for 5 s and 72°C for 10 s. Fluorescence was read at
the combined annealing-extension step at 72°C.
Identification and quantification by qPCR for
Staphylococcus aureus
The LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was used
to amplify a 197 bp region of the S. aureus nucA gene with
LC FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBRGreen kit. PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 4 μl of Master mixture including Taq polymerase, reaction buffer, and
a deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture; 10.6 μl of pure
water and 0.5 μM each of forward (5' GACTATTATTGGTTGATACACCTG 3') and reverse (5' GCCTTGACGAACTAAAGCTTC 3') primers. After distribution of 15 μl
of the master mixture, 5 μl of diluted template DNA solution was added to each glass capillary (Roche Diagnostics), centrifuged, and placed in the LightCycler sample
carousel. LightCycler amplification involved a first denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by amplification of
the target DNA for 50 cycles (95°C for 10 s, 53°C for 20
s, and 72°C for 10 s) with a temperature transition rate of
20°C/s. The fragment amplification step is followed by a
melting curve analysis to an increase from 50°C to 95°C
at a rate of 0.1°C/s.
Quantification of amplified DNA
After purification, the DNA obtained was quantified using
"Qubit Quantitation Platform" either with the Quant-iT
dsDNA HS Assay/Quant-iT dsDNA BR Assay kits for DNA
or the Quant-iT RNA Assay kit for RNA as recommended
by the manufacturer (Invitrogen®).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/77

Hybridization to microarrays
DNA amounts obtained after amplification were quantified by Quantit BR and Quantit HS (Invitrogen Inc.), for
WTA and RA, respectively. The same quantity of DNA was
fragmented (GeneChip® Resequencing Assay Kit, Affymetrix Inc.) and labelled according to the GeneChip® Mapping 100 K Assay Manual (Affymetrix Inc.). Microarray
hybridization was conducted at 45°C and array processing was carried out according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix Inc.) as
previously described [2]. All experiments described in
these studies were carried out using independent duplicates.
Data Analysis
The raw image file (.DAT) obtained after scanning the
microarray was analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip
Operating Software (GCOS) to produce a simplified file
format (.CEL) with intensities assigned to each of the corresponding probe positions. Next, the Affymetrix GeneChip Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ), which contains
a derivative of the ABACUS algorithm [15], uses the probe
intensities to call the bases along genetic fragments
included on the microarray, outputting the result in a
FASTA file. The analysis parameters were optimized in
order to obtain the best call rate value while minimising
the rate of resequencing error. The call rate for a fragment
is simply the ratio of called bases to the total number of
bases expressed as a percentage. More details concerning
data analysis are described in Berthet et al [2].

Results
DNA yields and amplification factors for WTA and RA
Phi29 polymerase requires DNA templates larger than 2
kb, which exceeds the size of the smallest RNA strands of
segmented RNA viruses (e.g. influenza viruses). To
address this shortcoming, a target cDNA ligation step is
performed prior to MDA amplification resulting in the
WTA protocol. In this work, WTA was compared to a RA
protocol as described in the Material and Methods
(M&M). The DNA yields obtained using WTA and RA
methods were compared for three different viral RNA
genomes. We tested (i) a viral genome fragmented into
small segments (influenza B virus: 14 kb and 8 segments),
(ii) a fragmented middle size genome (Rift Valley Fever
Virus (RVFV): 12 kb and 3 segments) and (iii) a large viral
genome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (SARS-CoV): 29 kb and 1 segment), which are representative of the extreme diversity in RNA viral genome
size. WTA DNA yields were 1.21 ± 0.06 μg/μl, 0.98 ± 0.27
μg/μl and 1.42 ± 0.08 μg/μl, respectively. These yields
greatly exceed those observed with RA (0.02 ± 0.01 μg/μl,
0.06 ± 0.02 μg/μl and 0.012 ± 0.004 μg/μl, respectively).
It is noteworthy that, in the absence of a DNA template,
water controls amplified by WTA yield as much as 0.9 μg/

μl of non-specific DNA. This spurious amplification is
probably due to priming artefacts or E. coli residual DNA
from the production process of one of the kit enzymes.
However, in the presence of a DNA template, such as S.
aureus DNA, the proportion of non-specific DNA dramatically decreases to undetectable levels using previously
described DNA microarray techniques [2].
High amplification factors were obtained starting WTA
with various viral genome equivalents. When starting
WTA with 15 to 4 × 107copies of RVFV RNA genome copies, the WTA amplification factor ranged from 109 to 106
whereas the RA factor varied from 103 to 101 respectively
(Figure 1). In comparison with RA, the amplification of
viral RNA was extremely high irrespective of the amount
of RNA genome input. The sensitivity of the detection and
identification protocol, based on resequencing microarray
technology, was determined by measuring the lowest
number of genome copies in the target applied to the
microarray. Figure 2 shows the call rate for the RNA
polymerase gene of RVFV expressed as a function of the
number of genome copies. The call rate is the percentage
of bases called by the resequencing algorithm (see M&M).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/77

Microarrays required a minimum of ~108 viral genome
copies for gene detection and identification confirmed by
BLAST analysis. The high amplification ratio obtained
with WTA allowed the detection of RVFV irrespective of
the copy number of input viral RNA into the amplification process. These sensitivity levels are compatible with
the viral load found in some clinical samples. In sharp
contrast, the low amplification ratio observed with RA is
irrelevant in clinical situations as it requires a very high
viral load for detection by microarrays, i.e. to obtain the
required ~108 copies of target sequence for hybridization.
To evaluate the potential of WTA in more complex samples where viral RNAs are mixed with cellular RNAs and
DNAs, human (n = 2), mouse (n = 10) and dog (n = 2)
rabies-infected brain extracts were tested. After hybridization of WTA amplified material on the DNA chip
described previously [2], all samples were found positive
for the presence of rabies virus with a minimum call rate
of 40%.

Hybridization of viral genomes of various lengths with
resequencing microarray
In order to assess the quality of amplified cDNA, hybridization to high density DNA resequencing arrays was performed and the call rate values of the sequences
determined through this analysis were compared. To this
aim, the viral amplification using WTA was performed
with seven viruses representative of the size diversity of
viral genomic RNAs, including positive and negative
strand genomes as well as non-segmented and segmented
genomes (Table 1). These data confirmed that the WTA
method amplified viral cDNA from a cell culture supernatant and identified the virus after hybridization. In all
cases, virus identification was accomplished using BLAST
analysis of DNA sequence determined using the resequencing chip.
Simultaneous amplification of viral RNA and bacterial
DNA
In a previous study, we detected and identified DNA from
monkeypox virus and Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion
collected from a patient [2]. Similarly, we wanted to check
whether a co-infection between a RNA virus and S. aureus
would lead to such discriminating results, bearing in
mind that the ratio between the amount of genetic material of RNA virus and bacteria is even higher. We therefore
evaluated the influence of RNA and DNA of diverse origins on amplification results. Simultaneous amplification
of viral RNA and bacterial DNA was performed using an
optimized WTA protocol as described in the M&M. As
shown in Table 2, S. aureus DNA amplification was
affected by neither the amount of DNA nor the presence
of viral cDNA. Similarly, cDNA from viral RNA was amplified, whatever the quantity of viral genome tested. However, the amplification ratio was decreased in the presence
of large quantity of S. aureus DNA. Considering the sensitivity threshold for the identification of RVFV (Figure 2),
this virus would be identified after hybridization on the
DNA chip with a high call rate, i.e. greater than 80%, in all
cases shown in Table 2, except for 1.45 × 104 copies of

viral RNA and 1.29 × 106 copies of S. aureus DNA. Similar
results were obtained after the co-amplification of the
RVFV cDNA and the DNA of a cowpox virus (data not
shown).

Discussion
WTA allowed amplification of a whole range of RNA viral
genomes with high sensitivity thereby providing an accurate and highly effective alternative to other random
amplification methods. In this study, we changed the
WTA method (QuantiTect Whole-Transcriptome Kit, Qiagen) by using a different reverse transcription step and
demonstrated unbiased identification of many different
viruses using WTA and oligonucleotide resequencing
microarray technology. Two viruses belonging to phylogenetically distinct genera (Vesiculovirus and Lyssavirus) were
identified with a call rate of 96.8% and 73.6% respectively. However, amplification output may vary within the
same viral genus as illustrated with yellow fever and dengue viruses (Flavivirus). The lower call rate obtained for
dengue 2 virus might be due to secondary structures in the
target sequence, as suggested by the higher call rate
obtained with yellow fever virus whose target sequence
lacked such structures. These results demonstrate the
effect of selected sequences on the final output. As mentioned for the analysis of human, mouse and dog brain
samples for the detection of rabies virus, the presence of
eukaryotic nucleic acids did not prevent either the amplification using WTA or the downstream identification of
the pathogen on DNA microarrays. WTA not only amplified a huge diversity of viral RNAs but also bacterial RNAs
such as those transcribed from ribosomal, house-keeping
and antibiotic resistance genes, extracted from either a
pure bacterial culture or a clinical sample (data not
shown). The simultaneous amplification of cDNA from
bacterial and viral RNA would be useful for the characterization of many different types of pathogens that cause
similar symptoms, such as respiratory syndromes, providing considerable potential for medical use. Samples containing 15 genome copies of viral RNA per target per

reaction could be amplified with WTA, to a yield compatible with most of the detection methods used in diagnosis. WTA could thus be used upstream of many pathogen
identification protocols for clinical samples (e.g. DNA
micro-arrays, liquid DNA arrays, Southern blots, modified qPCR using exonuclease or hybridization probes).
DNA polymerization catalyzed by phi29 DNA polymerase is a highly accurate process. Direct sequencing experiments sampling 500 000 bp determined its error rate to be
9.5 × 10-6 [16], making it one of the most accurate
polymerases available.
