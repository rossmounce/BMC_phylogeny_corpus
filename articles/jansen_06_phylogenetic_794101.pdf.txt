Abstract
Background: The Vitaceae (grape) is an economically important family of angiosperms whose phylogenetic placement
is currently unresolved. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on one to several genes have suggested several alternative
placements of this family, including sister to Caryophyllales, asterids, Saxifragales, Dilleniaceae or to rest of rosids, though
support for these different results has been weak. There has been a recent interest in using complete chloroplast genome
sequences for resolving phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms. These studies have clarified relationships among
several major lineages but they have also emphasized the importance of taxon sampling and the effects of different
phylogenetic methods for obtaining accurate phylogenies. We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of Vitis
vinifera and used these data to assess relationships among 27 angiosperms, including nine taxa of rosids.
Results: The Vitis vinifera chloroplast genome is 160,928 bp in length, including a pair of inverted repeats of 26,358 bp
that are separated by small and large single copy regions of 19,065 bp and 89,147 bp, respectively. The gene content and
order of Vitis is identical to many other unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including tobacco. Phylogenetic
analyses using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood were performed on DNA sequences of 61 protein-coding
genes for two datasets with 28 or 29 taxa, including eight or nine taxa from four of the seven currently recognized major
clades of rosids. Parsimony and likelihood phylogenies of both data sets provide strong support for the placement of
Vitaceae as sister to the remaining rosids. However, the position of the Myrtales and support for the monophyly of the
eurosid I clade differs between the two data sets and the two methods of analysis. In parsimony analyses, the inclusion
of Gossypium is necessary to obtain trees that support the monophyly of the eurosid I clade. However, maximum
likelihood analyses place Cucumis as sister to the Myrtales and therefore do not support the monophyly of the eurosid I
clade.
Conclusion: Phylogenies based on DNA sequences from complete chloroplast genome sequences provide strong
support for the position of the Vitaceae as the earliest diverging lineage of rosids. Our phylogenetic analyses support
recent assertions that inadequate taxon sampling and incorrect model specification for concatenated multi-gene data sets
can mislead phylogenetic inferences when using whole chloroplast genomes for phylogeny reconstruction.

ering plants. Single and multi-gene phylogenies of rosids
have identified seven major clades, however, relationships among these clades remain unresolved [13-16]. One
of these unresolved clades includes the Vitaceae, which
includes grape, an important crop plant. The phylogenetic
position of Vitaceae has been controversial for many
years. Some previous classifications place the family
within the Rhamnales in the subclass Rosidae [17]. More
recent molecular phylogenies based on one to four genes
provided weak support for the placement of Vitaceae sister
to the Caryophylales [18], asterids [18], Saxifragales [14],
Dilleniaceae [19], or to the rosids [14-16]. Thus, the phylogenetic relationship of the grape family to core eudicots
remains unresolved.

Background
The estimation of phylogenetic relationships among
angiosperms has received considerable attention during
the past decade with the rapid increase in availability of
DNA sequence data from a wide diversity of markers and
taxa [reviewed in [1]]. Most previous molecular phylogenetic studies of flowering plants have relied on one to several genes from the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and/or
nuclear genomes, though most of these analyses were
based on chloroplast markers. These efforts have resolved
the relationships among many of the major lineages of
angiosperms but a number of outstanding issues remain
[1]. Completely sequenced chloroplast genomes provide
a rich source of data that can be used to address phylogenetic questions at deep nodes in the angiosperm tree [26]. The use of DNA sequences from all of the shared chloroplast genes provides many more characters for phylogeny reconstruction compared to previous studies that
have relied on only one or a few genes to address the same
questions. However, the whole genome approach can
result in misleading estimates of relationships because of
limited taxon sampling [5,7-10] and the use of incorrect
models of sequence evolution in concatenated datasets
[4,11]. Thus, there is a growing interest in expanding the
taxon sampling of complete chloroplast genome
sequences and developing new evolutionary models for
phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast sequences [12] to
overcome these concerns.
The rosids represent the largest of the eight major clades
of core eudicots and include nearly one third of all flow-

In this article, we report on the complete sequence of the
chloroplast genome of grape (Vitis vinifera, Vitaceae). In
addition to describing the organization of the chloroplast
genome, we present results of phylogenetic analyses of
DNA sequences for 61 genes from grape and 26 other
angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including eight other
members of the rosid clade. The phylogenetic analyses
provide insights into the relationship of Vitaceae to other
rosids and illustrate the importance of taxon sampling
and analytical method on addressing phylogenetic questions using whole genome sequences. The complete chloroplast genome sequence of Vitis also provides valuable
data for using chloroplast genetic engineering for this economically important crop plant [20].

Results
Size, gene content, order and organization of the grape
chloroplast genome
The complete chloroplast genome of grape is 160,928 bp
in length (Fig. 1) and includes a pair of inverted repeats
26,358 bp long, separated by a small and a large single
copy region of 19,065 bp and 89,147 bp, respectively. The
grape chloroplast genome has 113 unique genes, 18 of
which are duplicated in the IR, for a total of 131 genes
(Fig. 1). There are four ribosomal and 30 distinct tRNA
genes; seven of the tRNA genes and all rRNA genes are
duplicated within the IR. There are 17 intron-containing
genes, 15 of which contain one intron, and two of which
contain two introns. Overall, the gene order in the grape
chloroplast genome is identical to that of tobacco. The
grape genome is 37.40% GC and 62.60% AT; 57.55% of
the genome corresponds to coding regions and 42.45% to
non-coding regions, including introns and intergenic
spacers.
Repeat structure
Repeat analysis identified 36 repetitive elements (30 bp or
longer with a sequence identity of at least 90%), 15 of
which are direct repeats and 21 of which are inverted
repeats (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Eight direct repeats and 12

inverted repeats were 30 – 40 bp long, and the longest
direct repeats were 64 bp. The majority of the repeats were
located within intergenic spacer regions, intron sequences
and ycf2. Two distinct 64 bp direct repeats were found in
ycf2, which is located in the IR. Additionally, a 41 bp
direct repeat was located in psaA and psaB, and a shorter,
32 bp direct repeat was found in two serine transfer-RNA
(trnS) genes that recognize different codons; trnS-GCU
and trnS-UGA. Lastly, a 31-bp direct repeat was identified
within trnG-GCC in the IR, and a 39-bp direct repeat was
found three times in the grape chloroplast genome, with
a single occurrence in an intergenic spacer region, and also
in the ycf3 and ndhA introns.
RNA variable sites in grape chloroplast transcripts
Comparison of DNA and EST sequences for chloroplastencoded proteins retrieved from GenBank showed that

most photosynthetic machinery and ribosomal subunit
genes have 100% sequence identity with their respective
EST sequences. Eleven non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, resulting in a total of nine amino acid changes,
were identified for atpI, clpP, matK, petB, petD, psbA and
rpl22 compared to the ESTs (Table 2). Also, there were five
synonymous substitutions. In the cases of non-synonymous substitutions, all genes experienced one nucleotide
substitution except clpP, which had five variable sites.
Lastly, in atpI, clpP and psbA the nucleotide substitutions
had an impact on the hydropathy of the amino acid,
changing it from aliphatic to hydrophilic, and vice versa.
These differences could be due to mRNA editing, sequencing error of either the genomic DNA or ESTs, or polymorphisms between the samples used for genomic and EST
sequences (see Discussion).

Phylogenetic analysis
We examined two datasets that differed by a single rosid
taxon to assess the effect of taxon sampling on resolving
relationships among rosids. The first data matrix examined for phylogenetic analyses included 61 protein-coding genes for 28 taxa (Table 3, excluding Gossypium),
including 26 angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups (Pinus and Ginkgo), and the second data matrix
included 29 taxa with the addition of Gossypium. Both data
sets comprised 45,573 nucleotide positions but when the
gaps were excluded there were 39,624 characters.

Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses of the 28-taxon dataset resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of
49,511, a consistency index of 0.47 (excluding uninformative characters) and a retention index of 0.62 (Fig.
3A). Bootstrap analyses indicated that 18 of the 25 nodes
were supported by values ≥ 95% and all but one of these
had a bootstrap value of 100%. Maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis resulted in a single tree with – lnL =
289638.676. ML bootstrap values also were consistently
high, with values of ≥ 95% for 21 of the 25 nodes. The ML
and MP trees had very similar topologies, except for two
important differences. The first concerned the position of
the two basal angiosperm lineages. The MP tree placed
Amborella as the most basal lineage followed by the Nym-

phaeales (including Nuphar and Nymphaea), whereas the
ML tree placed Amborella sister to the Nymphaeales, and
together this group formed the basal lineage of
angiosperms. The second topological difference concerned the placement of Calycanthus, the only representative of the magnolids. The MP tree placed Calycanthus
sister to the eudicots, whereas the ML tree positioned Calycanthus as sister to a large clade that included both monocots and eudicots. Support for the different placements of
Calycanthus was weak in both MP and ML analyses,
whereas the support for the different resolutions of basal
angiosperms was stronger (Fig. 3). These two differences
were also detected in a recent phylogeny of basal
angiosperms based on whole chloroplast genome
sequences [5]. The remaining angiosperms formed two
major clades, one including monocots and a second
including the eudicots (highlighted with thick lines in
Figs. 3 and 4). Monophyly of the monocots was strongly
supported (100% bootstrap value for both MP and ML)
and included members of three different orders (Acorales,
Asparagales, and Poales). Ranunculales were the earliest
diverging lineage of eudicots. There were two major clades
of core eudicots, one including the rosids and the second
including the Caryophyllales + asterids. Within the rosids,
Vitis was sister to the remaining taxa, which formed two
clades, one including Cucumis (Cucurbitaceae) + Myrtales,

and a second with Arabidopsis (Brassicales) + Fabales.
Overall, relationships within rosids were in agreement
with recent phylogenies [summarized in [1]] except that
the eurosids I clade was paraphyletic in our analyses.
MP analysis of the second dataset of 29 taxa including
Gossypium resulted in a single most parsimonious tree
with a length of 51,056, a consistency index of 0.46
(excluding uninformative characters) and a retention
index of 0.61 (Fig. 4A). Bootstrap analyses indicated that
24 of the 26 nodes were supported by values ≥ 95%, and
all but four of these nodes had a bootstrap value of 100%.
ML analysis resulted in a tree with a – lnL = 296670.545
(Fig. 4B). ML bootstrap analyses indicated that 22 of the
26 nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% and all but two
of these nodes had a bootstrap value of 100%. Both MP
and ML analyses provided strong support for Vitis as the
earliest diverging lineage of rosids, monophyly of Myr-

tales, and sister relationship of Brassicales and Malvales.
The ML and MP trees had three important topological differences. The first two differences concerned the position
of Calycanthus and the basal angiosperms, which were
identical to those described above for the analyses that
excluded Gossypium. The other difference concerned relationships among rosids. The MP tree (Fig. 4A) showed
strong support (100% bootstrap) for monophyly of the
eurosid I clade because of the sister relationship between
the Fabales and Cucurbitales. In contrast, the ML tree indicated that eurosids I are paraphyletic because Cucurbitales
were sister to Mrytales rather than Fabales (Fig. 4B); bootstrap support for this relationship was also strong (92%).

Discussion
Grapes are an important crop plant grown for wine, juice,
raisins, and as fresh fruit. In 2004, the world's grape harvest area in 89 grape-producing countries was 7.5 million

hectares, and in the United States grapes were grown in
380,000 hectares [21]. The total production of grapes in
the US in 2004 was 5,418,160 metric tons and this generated $2.5 billion [21]. There is considerable interest in
using chloroplast genetic engineering as an environmentally friendly approach for engineering disease resistance
to powdery and downy mildew, two fungal diseases that
have a negative impact on the grape industry. Chloroplast
genetic engineering offers a number of unique advantages, including a high-level of transgene expression [23],
multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event

[23-26], transgene containment via maternal inheritance
[27-29] or cytoplasmic male sterility [30], and lack of gene
silencing, position effect, pleiotropic effects, and undesirable foreign DNA [20,31-35]. Thus far, transgenes have
been stably integrated and expressed via the chloroplast
genome to confer several useful agronomic traits, including insect resistance [36,37,23], herbicide resistance
[27,38], disease resistance [39], drought tolerance [31],
salt tolerance [40], and phytoremediation [24]. The complete grape chloroplast genome sequence reported in this
paper provides valuable characterization of spacer regions

for potential integration of transgenes at optimal sites via
homologous recombination, as well as endogenous regulatory sequences for optimal expression of transgenes.
Genome organization and evolution
The organization of the Vitis genome with two copies of
an IR separating the SSC and LSC regions is identical to
most sequenced angiosperm chloroplast genomes
[reviewed in [41]]. The size of the genome at 160,928 bp
is also within the known size range for angiosperms,

which generally vary from 150,519 (Lotus [42]) to
162,686 bp (Amborella [3]) among photosynthetic
genomes from dicots that have both copies of the IR. Size
of the Vitis IR at 26,358 bp is also well within the size
range of other sequenced dicot genomes, which range
from 23,302 (Calycanthus [43]) to 27,807 bp (Oenothera
[44]). Gene content and order of the Vitis chloroplast
genome is virtually identical to tobacco and many other
unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes. Several
previously sequenced rosid chloroplast genomes have lost

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:32

the rpl22 gene, including legumes [45-49]. The distribution of this loss on the chloroplast phylogeny (arrows in
Fig. 4A) indicates that there have been at least two independent losses of rpl22 in rosids. Multiple, independent
gene losses in angiosperms have been demonstrated for
other genes including infA [50], rps16 [48] and accD
[51,52]. Thus, it is evident that gene losses are not always
reliable indicators of phylogenetic relationships.
It is increasingly evident that chloroplast genomes contain
repeated sequences other than the IR [49]. Several studies
have identified a higher incidence of dispersed repeats in
genomes that have experienced extensive rearrangements
[53,54]. However, dispersed repeats are also being
detected in unrearranged genomes. In most cases, these
repeats are more common in intergenic spacers and
introns, which is also true for the Vitis genome. Repeats
have been located in a number of other rosids [49] in the
same regions as those identified in the Vitis genome. One
of these, a 32 bp repeat in the trnS gene, is in the same
location in Gossypium hirsutum [55], indicating that this
repeat may be shared among rosids. Although repeats
have been implicated in playing a role in chloroplast
genome rearrangements [56], their effect if any in unrearranged chloroplast genomes is unknown.
Based on previous studies of Atropa [57] and tobacco [58],
posttranscriptional RNA editing events, as well as deamination-facilitating attacks on nucleotides' exocyclic amino
groups, yield primarily C-to-U alterations. Analyses of the
Vitis chloroplast genome and the corresponding ESTs
indicate that the five C-to-U changes likely represent
mRNA edits. However, the remaining six differences could
be either sequencing errors in the genomic DNA or EST
sequences or due to the use of different cultivars and/or
plants/tissues used for sequencing. Our methods eliminate the latter explanation since we only compared DNA
and EST sequences from leaves of the chardonnay variety
of Vitis vinifera. In view of the high depth of coverage (8X)
of our genomic DNA sequences, we believe that the non
C-to-U changes represent EST sequencing errors.
Evolutionary loss of RNA editing sites has been observed
in earlier studies and could be attributed to a decrease in
the effect of RNA-editing enzymes [59]. Additionally, conversions other than C-to-U in Vitis and other plants suggest that chloroplast genomes may be accumulating a
considerable number of nucleotide substitutions, and
some genes might accumulate more changes than others,
such as the petL and ndh genes that have a high frequency
of RNA editing [60]. Therefore, despite high levels
sequence conservation in chloroplast genomes, variations
do occur posttranscriptionally, promoting translational
efficiency due to transcript-protein complex binding and/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/32

or changes in the chloroplasts microenvironment (e.g.,
like redox potential or light intensity [61,62]).
Phylogenetic implications
Phylogenetic analyses of 28 (Fig. 3) or 29 (Fig. 4)
angiosperms based on 61 protein-coding genes identified
many of the major lineages recognized in previous phylogenetic hypotheses of flowering plants [reviewed in [1]].
Two groups, Amborella and Nymphaelaes (represented by
Nuphar and Nymphaea) are basal, with Amborella forming
the first diverging lineage in MP analyses and Amborella/
Nymphaelaes together forming the most basal clade in
ML trees. These results are congruent with recent 61-gene
analyses by Leebens-Mack et al. [5] and support their contention that limited taxon sampling in earlier whole chloroplast genome phylogenies led some previous workers to
suggest that Amborella may not be among the earliest
diverging angiosperm lineages [2,3]. Monophyly of the
monocots is strongly supported, and they are sister to the
remaining angiosperms. Calycanthus, the sole representative of the magnolids, is weakly supported as sister to eudicots in the MP analyses (Figs. 3A and 4A) but the genus is
weakly supported as sister to a clade that includes both
monocots and eudicots in ML trees (Figs. 3B and 4B).
Monophyly of eudicots is strongly supported (100%
bootstrap values), in agreement with phylogenies based
on both pollen [63,64] and other molecular data
[13,14,18,19,65-67]. Within eudicots, Ranunculales
diverge first and are sister to a strongly supported eudicot
clade that includes two moderately to well-supported
groups comprising the rosids and asterids. The early divergence of Ranunculales among eudicots is in agreement
with many recent molecular phylogenies [see chapter 5 in
[1]]. Although previous studies have clearly indicated that
Carylophyllales belong in the core eudicot clade [1], resolution of the relationships of Caryophyllales to other
major clades of eudicots remains uncertain. This order has
been considered to be closely allied to rosids, asterids, or
simply as an unresolved major eudicot clade sister to the
Dilleniaceae [15]. Although taxon sampling is limited in
our 61 gene phylogeny, there is moderate to strong support for a sister relationship between the Caryophyllales
and asterids (Figs. 3 and 4).

The rosid clade is very diverse, including nearly 140 families representing approximately 39% of the species of
angiosperms. The most recent phylogenies of this group
[summarized in chapter 8 in [1]] indicate that there are
seven major clades whose relationships still remain unresolved. Eight (Fig. 3) or nine (Fig. 4, includes Gossypium)
representatives of four of these major clades are included
in our phylogenetic analyses, including members of
eurosids I, eurosids II, Myrtales, and Vitaceae. Phylogenetic analyses of both datasets using MP and ML clearly
indicate that the Vitaceae is sister to the remaining rosids,

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:32

and therefore represents an early diverging member of the
rosid clade. Previous molecular phylogenetic comparisons that included Vitaceae could not resolve its relationship. Phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequences alone
placed the Vitaceae as sister to either the Caryophyllales or
asterid clade with weak support [18]. Phylogenies based
on atpB provided only weak support for a sister relationship of Vitaceae to Saxifragales [14]. Several phylogenies
based on two to four genes suggested that the Vitaceae are
sister to rest of the rosids, with relatively weak support
(50–75%; [14-16]). However, phylogenies based on the
chloroplast gene matK did not place Vitaceae sister to rosids but instead positioned the family as sister to Dilleniaceae with weak support [19]. In short, the phylogenetic
position of Vitaceae is equivocal, though our results
strongly support the earlier findings that Vitaceae represent an early diverging clade within rosids (Figs. 3 and 4).
The two datasets we examined differed by only one taxon
but the results of MP analyses differed dramatically
regarding the placement of three of the four rosid clades
examined (compare Figs. 3A and 4A). The 28-taxon dataset (excluding Gossypium) showed relationships that are
incongruent with recent molecular phylogenies of rosids
[1] by placing the eurosids II (represented by only Brassicales) sister to the Fabales in eurosids I. This made
eurosids I paraphyletic because the other representative of
this clade is Cucumis (Cucurbitales), which is sister to the
Brassicales in molecular phylogenies of rosids [1]. The
addition of Gossypium in the 29-taxon dataset generates
MP trees (Fig. 4A) that are congruent with previous
angiosperm phylogenies. The Brassicales and Malvales are
sister and there is strong support for the monophyly of
eurosid II. The addition of Gossypium also makes the
eurosid I clade strongly monophyletic in the MP tree by
placing the Cucurbitales sister to the Fabales, both of
which are members of the nitrogen-fixing clade [see chapter 8 in [1]]. In contrast to the MP trees, relationships
among the major rosid clades do not differ in the ML trees
when Gossypium is added. In both the 28 and 29-taxon
data sets the ML trees do not support the monophyly of
eurosids I since Cucurbitales (eurosid I) are sister to the
Myrtales and Brassicales (eurosid II) are sister to the
Fabales (eurosid I). Therefore, the ML analyses are incongruent with currently accepted relationships among rosids
[1], though the strongest support for the monophyly of
eurosid I clade is only 77% (jackknife support) in a threegene analysis [15]. Thus, our results suggest that additional phylogenetic studies are needed to assess the
monophyly of eurosids I and their relationship to other
rosids.
There has been considerable debate regarding the utility
of whole genome sequences for phylogeny reconstruction
[5,7-10]. Some have argued that the use of more genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/32

from whole genomes has great potential for providing
much more data for resolving phylogenetic relationships
[2,68], whereas others have suggested that problems with
limited taxon sampling available for whole genomes
[5,7,8,10] and model misspecification [4,11] overshadows any potential advantages. One example that highlighted each of these concerns centered around the
controversy regarding identification of basal angiosperms.
Leebens-Mack et al. [5] demonstrated that inadequate
taxon sampling clearly played a role in misleading some
previous studies, and Goremykin et al. [4] demonstrated
that ML analyses of whole chloroplast genome data sets
can be sensitive to model specification. It is well known
that ML methods fail when model parameters are misspecified [69-71]. The phylogenetic analyses in this study
provide yet another example of these phenomena. Addition of the Gossypium genome to our parsimony analyses
generated trees that are congruent with current understanding of relationships among the major rosid clades.
However, the ML analyses are incongruent with the MP
trees regarding the monophyly and relationships of the
rosid clades and support for the alternative relationships
was very strong in each case (compare Figs. 4A and 4B). It
is possible, if not likely, that the use of a single "average"
model (GTR + I + Γ) in the ML analyses is inappropriate
for a data set of 61 concatenated genes [see [11] for a discussion of this issue]. Future phylogenetic analyses of
complete chloroplast genome sequences should consider
using methods in which different models can be applied
to different partitions of the data (e.g., genes, codon positions, functional groups) [72]. Development of more
appropriate models of evolution of chloroplast sequences
[12] may also improve the accuracy of phylogenies based
on these genomes. Thus, we need more extensive sampling of whole chloroplast genomes from the major lineages of flowering plants and more rigorous phylogenetic
analyses before the full potential of this approach can be
realized. Ongoing projects by several labs [see [73] for a
list of some of these] should greatly enhance our taxon
sampling so that we can generate reliable phylogenies
based on whole chloroplast genomes.

Conclusion
The chloroplast genome of Vitis has a very similar size and
organization to other previously sequenced, unrearranged
angiosperm chloroplast genomes. These sequences will
provide a valuable resource for developing transgenes for
this important crop plant using the more environmentally
friendly chloroplast genetic engineering technology [20].
Phylogenetic analyses of a dataset of sequences of 61
shared protein-coding genes of Vitis and 26 other
angiosperm genomes demonstrated the importance of
taxon sampling and methods of phylogenetic analysis for
phylogenomic studies. Furthermore, trees generated by
both parsimony and likelihood methods provided sup-

port for the resolution of relationships among eudicots.
This included support for the position of the Ranunculales as the earliest diverging lineage of eudicots, the placement of the Caryophyllales as the sister clade to the
asterids, and the position of the Vitaceae sister to all other
rosids. However, resolution of relationships among the
remaining rosid clades based on complete chloroplast
genome sequences remains unresolved due to limited
taxon sampling and differences in trees generated by MP
and ML analyses.

Methods
DNA sources
The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of grape
was constructed by ligating size-fractionated partial Hind
III digests of total cellular, high molecular weight DNA
with the pINDIGOBAC vector. The average insert size of
the grape library is 144 kb. BAC-related resources for this
public library can be obtained online from the Clemson
University Genomics Institute BAC/EST Resource Center
[74].

BAC clones containing the chloroplast genome inserts
were isolated by screening the library with a soybean chloroplast probe. The first 96 positive clones from screening
were pulled from the library, arrayed in a 96-well microtitre plate, copied, and archived. Selected clones were then
subjected to Hind III fingerprinting and Not I digests. Endsequences were determined and localized on the chloroplast genome of Arabidopsis thaliana to deduce the relative
positions of the clones, then clones that covered the entire
chloroplast genome of grape were chosen for sequencing.
DNA sequencing and genome assembly
The nucleotide sequences of the BAC clones were determined by the bridging shotgun method. The purified BAC
DNA was subjected to hydroshearing, end repair, and
then size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractions of approximately 3.0–5.0 kb were eluted and ligated
into the vector pBLUESCRIPT IIKS+. The libraries were
plated and arrayed into 40 96-well microtitre plates for
the sequencing reactions.

Sequencing was performed using the Dye-terminator
cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems,
USA). Sequence data from the forward and reverse priming sites of the shotgun clones were accumulated.
Sequence data equivalent to eight times the size of the
genome was assembled using Phred/Phrap programs
[75].
Gene annotation
The Vitis genome was annotated using DOGMA (Dual
Organellar GenoMe Annotator) [76], after uploading a
FASTA-formatted file of the complete plastid genome to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/32

the program's server. BLASTX and BLASTN searches
against a custom database of previously published plastid
genomes identified Vitis' putative protein-coding genes,
and tRNAs or rRNAs. For genes with low sequence identity, manual annotation was performed, after identifying
the position of the start and stop codons, as well as the
translated amino acid sequence, using the plastid/bacterial genetic code.
Examination of repeat structure
REPuter [77] was used in order to locate and count the
direct (forward) and inverted (palindromic) repeats
within the grape chloroplast genome. For repeat identification, the following constraints were set to REPuter: (i)
minimum repeat size of 30 bp, and (ii) 90% or greater
sequence identity, based on Hamming distance of 3 [49].
Manual verification of the identified repeats was performed in EditSeq, while performing intragenomic blast
search of the identified repeat sequence.
Variation between coding sequences and cDNAs
Each of the gene sequences from the grape chloroplast
genome was used to perform a BLAST search of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from Genbank. In order to incorporate specificity into our analyses, the matching ESTs had to
meet all of the following criteria: (1) belong to a Vitis vinifera cv., (2) belong to the chardonnay variety, and (3)
come from leaf tissue. Due to length variations between
the screened ESTs and the related gene, the retrieved EST
with the highest bit score was selected for further analyses.
The retrieved Vitis vinifera EST was aligned with the corresponding annotated gene using ClustalX [78], followed
by screening for nucleotide and amino acid changes using
Megalign and the plastid/bacterial genetic code. Because
of variations in the length between an EST and the related
gene, the length of the analyzed sequence was recorded.
Phylogenetic analysis
The 61 genes included in the analyses of Goremykin et al.
[2,3] and Leebens-Mack et al. [5] were extracted from our
new chloroplast genome sequences of Vitis using the
organellar genome annotation program DOGMA [76].
The same set of 61 genes was extracted from chloroplast
genome sequences of six other recently sequenced
angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including tomato,
potato, soybean, cotton, cucumber, and Eucalyptus (see
Table 3 for complete list of genomes examined). In general, alignment of the DNA sequences was straightforward
and simply involved adding the 61 genes for the new
angiosperms to the aligned data matrix from LeebensMack et al. [5]. In some cases, small in-frame insertions or
deletions were required for correct alignment. For two
genes, ccsA and matK, the DNA sequences were more
divergent, requiring alignment using ClustalX [78] fol-

lowed by manual adjustments. The complete nucleotide
alignment is available online at [79].
Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP)
and maximum likelihood (ML) were performed using
PAUP* version 4.10 [80] on two data sets, one including
28 taxa and a second including 29 taxa by the addition of
Gossypium. Phylogenetic analyses excluded gap regions.
All MP searches included 100 random addition replicates
and TBR branch swapping with the Multrees option. Modeltest 3.7 [81] was used to determine the most appropriate
model of DNA sequence evolution for the combined 61gene dataset. Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the
Akaikle information criterion were used to assess which of
the 56 models best fit the data, which was determined to
be GTR + I + Γ by both criteria. For ML analyses we performed an initial parsimony search with 100 random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping,
which resulted in a single tree. Model parameters were
optimized onto the parsimony tree. We fixed these parameters and performed a ML analysis with three random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping.
The resulting ML tree was used to re-optimize model
parameters, which then were fixed for another ML search
with three random addition sequence replicates and TBR
branch swapping. This successive approximation procedure was repeated until the same tree topology and model
parameters were recovered in multiple, consecutive iterations. This tree was accepted as the final ML tree (Figs. 3B,
4B). Successive approximation has been shown to perform as well as full-optimization analyses for a number of
empirical and simulated datasets [82]. Non-parametric
bootstrap analyses [83] were performed for MP analyses
with 1000 replicates with TBR branch swapping, 1 random addition replicate, and the Multrees option and for
ML analyses with 100 replicates with NNI branch swapping, 1 random addition replicate, and the Multrees
option.
