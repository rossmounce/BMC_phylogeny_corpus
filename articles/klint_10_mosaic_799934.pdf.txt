Mosaic structure of intragenic repetitive elements
in histone H1-like protein Hc2 varies within
serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis

Abstract
Background: The histone-like protein Hc2 binds DNA in Chlamydia trachomatis and is known to vary in size
between 165 and 237 amino acids, which is caused by different numbers of lysine-rich pentamers. A more
complex structure was seen in this study when sequences from 378 specimens covering the hctB gene, which
encodes Hc2, were compared.
Results: This study shows that the size variation is due to different numbers of 36-amino acid long repetitive
elements built up of five pentamers and one hexamer. Deletions and amino acid substitutions result in 14 variants
of repetitive elements and these elements are combined into 22 configurations. A protein with similar structure
has been described in Bordetella but was now also found in other genera, including Burkholderia, Herminiimonas,
Minibacterium and Ralstonia.
Sequence determination resulted in 41 hctB variants that formed four clades in phylogenetic analysis. Strains causing the eye disease trachoma and strains causing invasive lymphogranuloma venereum infections formed separate
clades, while strains from urogenital infections were more heterogeneous. Three cases of recombination were identified. The size variation of Hc2 has previously been attributed to deletions of pentamers but we show that the
structure is more complex with both duplication and deletions of 36-amino acid long elements.
Conclusions: The polymorphisms in Hc2 need to be further investigated in experimental studies since DNA
binding is essential for the unique biphasic life cycle of the Chlamydiacae. The high sequence variation in the
corresponding hctB gene enables phylogenetic analysis and provides a suitable target for the genotyping of
C. trachomatis.

Background
Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacterium
that can multiply only within a host cell. Reticulate
bodies (RBs) are the replicating form of Chlamydia bacteria that transform into infectious elementary bodies
(EBs) prior to cell lysis. The transformation from a fragile RB to a robust EB is dramatic: the size reduces
from 1 μm to 0.3 μm, the dispersed chromatin aggregates into a condensed nucleoid and metabolism ceases.
C. trachomatis is classified into 19 serotypes (A-L3)
based on the major outer membrane protein (MOMP)
where A-C cause trachoma, D-K cause urogenital infections and L1-L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).

Hc1 and Hc2 are DNA-binding proteins, homologous
to eukaryotic histone H1 [1,2] which are thought to
mediate the chromatin compaction. These histone-like
proteins are encoded by the hctA and hctB genes that
are expressed late in the life cycle when RBs convert to
EBs [3]. The hctA gene has been inserted into Escherichia coli and the expressed Hc1 was shown to induce a
compaction of chromatin into a spherical condensed
nucleoid [4]. Hc2 also condenses DNA but the nucleoid
is distinctly different with a more thoroid shape [5,6],
indicating that these proteins interact with DNA in different ways. Both proteins are able to repress transcription, but Hc2 has a higher binding affinity for RNA and
thus represses translation more efficiently than Hc1 [6].
The Hc1 protein has two domains: the conserved
N-terminus [7], which mediates dimerisation, and the

lysine-rich C-terminus, which is responsible for DNA
binding [8,9]. Hc2, on the other hand, varies in size
between serovars because of varying numbers of lysinerich pentameric repeats [10]. Hc2 appears to be ubiquitous in Chlamydiaceae because the hctB gene has been
found in all available genome sequences of this family,
Based on Southwestern blot analysis, Hc2 has previously
been reported to be absent or present in reduced
amounts in Chlamydophila psittaci strain Mn [10].
However, the hctB gene has been found in C. psittaci
strain 6BC by whole genome sequencing (G. Myers, personal communication).
The hctB gene encoding Hc2 is one of the targets in a
newly developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
system for C. trachomatis [11]. Studies of trachoma,
lymphogranuloma venereum (B. Herrmann, unpublished), the Swedish variant with plasmid mutated
strains [12] and other genotyping studies have used this
MLST system and the corresponding hctB sequences
are stored in a publically-accessible MLST database [13].
When comparing hctB sequences from many C. trachomatis specimens it was clear that the size variation
was more complex than could be attributed to simple
deletions of a pentamer as previously described. In this
study we found elements of 108 bp that are deleted and
duplicated within the hctB gene without a premature
stop codon or loss of the reading frame. We have created a nomenclature to characterise the variation in

numbers and type of these elements observed in
378 clinically derived and reference specimens of
C. trachomatis.

Results
Hc2 in C. trachomatis

41 hctB gene variants were found among 378 sequences
in the MLST database, with the highest level of variation
occurring in a region encoding consecutive amino acid
pentamers. The pentamers have two positively charged
residues (arginine and lysine) and three other residues
that are mainly alanine, but also valine, threonine and
proline (Figure 1). The pentamers result in evenly distributed positive charges throughout the Hc2 protein,
except for the C-terminal domain (Figure 2). This
charge distribution is in contrast to the DNA-binding
C-terminal domain of Hc1 that has a random distribution of positive charges. The C-terminal domain of both
Hc1 and Hc2 lack negatively charged residues.
Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed that
there was a repetitive structure within Hc2, with repetitive elements of 36 amino acids built up by six pentamers and one hexamer (Figure 1). The repetitive region
in Hc2 is 72-144 amino acids long and has from two to
four repetitive elements. Repetitive elements with deletions of 1-4 hexamer/pentamers are relatively rare
though elements of 16, 20, 21, 26, 30 and 31 amino
acids have been found.

Figure 2 Charge distribution in Hc2, Hc2-like proteins and Hc1. Positively charged residues (blue bars) and negatively charged residues (red
bars) in the protein sequence of Hc2 in Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Protochlamydia amoebophila, an Hc2-like protein in
Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans and Hc1 in Chlamydia trachomatis.

A nomenclature was devised that enabled classification
of the repetitive elements into 14 groups (denoted 1-14)
based on the protein sequence (Figure 1) and 20 subgroups (1a, 1b, 2a etc) based on silent substitutions at
the nucleotide level. There are 22 combinations of repetitive elements at the protein level (i.e. 1, 5 and 1, 5, 5)
and 30 configurations at the nucleotide level (i.e. 1b, 5b
and 1b, 5b, 5b) of Hc2 based on the 378 specimens in
the MLST database (Figure 3). The 1, 2, 6 and 7 elements have a characteristic alanine-threonine instead of
threonine-alanine in the first pentamer (Figure 1) compared with other elements, and they are always first of
the elements in the repetitive region. The other major
types of repetitive elements are 3, 4 and 5 that are separated by three amino acid substitutions. The 8-14 elements are shorter forms of 3, 4 and 5 with deletions of
5 to 20 amino acids.
The amino acid sequence outside the variable region
is highly conserved with no insertions or deletions. The
beginning of the gene encodes 24 amino acids with two
substitutions; one of these substitutions is restricted to
the B (genital), D, G, H, I, Ia, J and K serovars while the
other is found in some trachoma strains. The last 69
amino acids of Hc2 downstream of the variable region
are therefore partly excluded in MLST typing analysis.
The only differences in sequence found in the 87 bp
obtained with MLST sequencing are two substitutions
that both cause a change in amino acid. One substitution was unique for the D, G, H, J and K serovars and

one was found only in a trachoma strain. Additional
sequencing was done in order to cover the last 120 bp
of the hctB gene for 17 strains representing different
types of Hc2. Only three variable positions were found.
Two substitutions, of which one is silent, separate the
LGV serovars from the others and one silent substitution is unique for the D, G, H, J and K serovars.
Phylogeny and evolution of repeat elements

The phylogenetic analyses of the repeat elements (Figure
3C) and of the MLST target including hctB (Figure 3A),
together show that the evolution of the hctB variants is
characterized by a relatively rapid rate of within-genome
duplications and deletions of repeat elements and a relatively slow rate of nucleotide substitution.
The phylogenetic tree shows that the hctB gene variants cluster in agreement with disease causing properties. The 41 variants of hctB sequences obtained with
MLST gave a topology with posterior probability above
0.95 for four clades, designated I-IV (Figure 3). Clade I
(1.0 posterior probability) contained the trachoma serovar A, B and C strains, but not the genital serovar B
(alleles 8_BGI, 11_BD and 31_B). The serovars B (genital), D (D/UW3), G, H, I, Ia, J and K were part of an
unresolved, basal, grade. Clade III comprised, in addition
to the LGV serovars, serovar D (D/IC-Cal8), E and F.
Clade IV (pp 0.97) consisted of some of the LGV serovars. The overlapping clade V included all LGV serovars
but did not have significant support (pp 0.84).

Figure 3 Phylogenetic relationships of 41 variants of the MLST target that include hctB from Chlamydia trachomatis. (A) Phylogenetic
tree based on the MLST target that includes the hctB gene. Each variant of the MLST target is indicated by the allele number and the serotypes
in which that variant has been found. The phylogeny has been estimated using Bayesian inferences and rooted using paralog rooting based on
the repetitive elements. The numbers on branches are posterior probabilities. The clades discussed in the text have been designated I-V. The
repetitive elements found in each MLST variant are illustrated in an alignment to the right (B). The alignment of the repetitive elements is based
on the neighbor-joining phylogeny of the element types (C) where the scale bar represents one nucleotide change.

Three cases of possible recombination were identified,
resulting in four recombined sequences (data not
shown). The sequences with a possible recombined origin are 36_J, 37_J (same event), 12_DHJK and 30_G.
Removing these sequences from the dataset before Bayesian analysis gave the same overall topology (data not
shown), but with an increased number of clades with
significant support.
The phylogenetic analysis of the repeat element types
(Figure 3C) indicated a duplication in the ancestor to
C. trachomatis, one copy resulting in the 1, 2, 6 and 7
group and the other in the group comprising the element types 3-5 and 8-14. Because the 1, 2, 6 and 7 elements are always found one per sequence and first in
order, the structure can be described as 1 + 1-3 elements rather than 2-4. Mapping this pattern on the
hctB phylogeny, the first element (1, 2, 6 and 7 super
group) appeared to have evolved by substitutions and

deletions only. The 2 element for example can have
evolved through a series of nucleotide substitutions, or
by deletion of the end of a 1 element and the beginning
of a 4 element. The remaining elements (3-5 and 8-14
super group) appear to have a much higher rate of
duplications and extinction of entire elements. Thus in
a duplication of a 5b element one copy gave rise to the
3 group lineage and the other copy to 5a and subsequently to the 4 group lineage of elements, with later
duplications and extinctions within both these lineages.

Discussion
Hc2 diversity in C. trachomatis

Hc2 displays considerable diversity in length and in
sequence when comparing 378 C. trachomatis specimens. Sequence comparisons show that Hc2 is a highly
structured protein with consecutive pentamers but also
with repetitions of larger elements built up by six

Klint et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/81

pentamers and one hexamer. These repeated elements
were found in 14 amino acid variants combined differently resulting in 20 configurations and 11 length variants of Hc2.
The rearrangement of repetitive elements appears to
be continuous in C. trachomatis because there are specimens with different configurations of repetitive elements
but with identical ompA genotype and MLST profile.
The diversity generated by several deletions and duplications while the flanking regions remain intact suggests
that the Hc2 protein is vital for Chlamydia, and that the
number of repetitions in the DNA-binding region has
an important role for the organism. It is difficult to link
the length of Hc2 to particular characteristics because
many specimens in the MLST database lack additional
information such as clinical manifestations and phenotypic differences. This needs further exploration. However,
the size variation enabled by rearrangement of the
repeated elements might be beneficial for the regulation
of DNA condensation and gene expression during the
transition from RB to EB.
Several phylogenetic trees have previously been constructed based on the ompA gene [14-17]. These trees
separate the serovars into three groups: B complex (serovars B, Ba, D, E, L1 and L2), C complex (serovars A, C,
H, I, Ia, J, K and L3) and the intermediate complex (serovars F and G). This classification does not represent
biological differences in that both ocular strains and
LGV strains are classified into the B and C complex.
A phylogenetic analysis based on a concatenated

Page 5 of 8

nucleotide sequence from nine housekeeping genes, six
intergenic non-coding segments and the porB gene gives
a different classification in which the ocular and LGV
strains are in separate clades [17]. That tree resembles
the phylogenetic tree based on hctB, where the ocular
strains are found in clade I and the LGV strains in clade
V (Figure 3), thus it reflects the biological separation in
distinct disease causing groups. Interestingly, both trees
separate the reference strains for serotype D strains in
the same way: D/UW-3 (10_DGHIIa) among serovar B
(genital), G, H, I, Ia, J and K and D/IC-Cal8 (13_D)
among serovar E and F.
The hctB gene with its high variability has proven to
be a valuable target for discrimination between different
C. trachomatis specimens in MLST analysis. For example, specimens with ompA genotype identical to the
reference strain E/Bour constitute 37-45% in two major
Swedish genotyping studies [18,19] and are abundant in
the MLST database (allele number 1, 3-5, 7, 14, 21-25,
35 in Figure 3A). However, the hctB gene can discriminate these samples because of ten configurations of 4
and 5 elements in the repetitive region.
Hc2 in Chlamydiales spp

Comparisons of hctB nucleotide sequences for other
species in the Chlamydiales-order show that they have a
similar structure with a region of repetitive elements
built up by pentamers (Figure 4) and conserved flanking
regions. The Hc2 sequence from the most closelyrelated species, Chlamydia muridarum, has the highest

arsenicoxydans. Repetitive elements of 20 amino acids or longer are shown in black.

similarity to C. trachomatis, with three repetitive elements similar to the 1, 2 and 6 elements. The repetitive
elements are shorter in Chlamydophila abortus, Chlamydophila caviae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae but
longer in Chlamydophila felis and Chlamydophila psittaci. No repetitive elements were found in the more distantly related protochlamydial amoeba symbionts
Protochlamydia amoebophila and Protochlamydia naegleriophila, and the pentameric structure was vaguer.
The hctB gene varies within Chlamydophila abortus
and is one of the targets in a recently developed MLVA
(multiple loci variable number of tandem repeat analysis) genotyping system [20]. In contrast, the four available genome sequences of C. pneumoniae are all
identical in hctB. C. pneumoniae is difficult to differentiate with highly discriminatory methods (such as SNP
analysis) [21] and is more conserved than C. trachomatis
when using AFLP [22] or MLST [23].
Hc2-like proteins in other genera

Searches in GenBank for Hc2-like proteins in other genera rendered hits including Bordetella (5 sequences), Burkholderia (31 sequences), Herminiimonas (1 sequence),
Minibacterium (1 sequence) and Ralstonia (4 sequences).
These proteins have a similar amino acid composition
and similar pentamers, resulting in a distribution of positively charged residues almost identical to Hc2 (Figure 2).
These proteins vary both in length and repeat structure, and the rearrangement in the encoding genes
might be as frequent as in hctB of C. trachomatis. Burkholderia, for instance, was found to have 14 size variants (149-231 amino acids) among 31 sequences from
nine species. Longer repeats and several different kinds
of repeats in the same protein were found in Burkholderia ambifaria, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia
pseudomallei, Burkholderia vietnamensis and Burkholderia multivorans. On the other hand, short consecutive
repeats of only a pentamer were repeated seven and
nine times in Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica. The Hc2-like proteins
in Bordetella petrii and Burkholderia phymatum have
no repeats. The protein most similar to Hc2 in C. trachomatis was found in Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans
(Figure 4) and Minibacterium masilliensis with five and
four repeats respectively.
Studies on the function of proteins similar to Hc2
have rarely been done in other genera. One exception is
the BpH1 protein in Bordetella where consecutive
lysine-rich pentamers causes size variation but which,
unlike Hc2, is expressed during exponential growth and
repressed in the stationary phase [24,25]. Strains with a
knocked out bpH1 gene have a similar growth rate and
phenotype as the wild-type strain, suggesting that this
protein is not essential in Bordetella. No study on

Page 6 of 8

functional differences between strains with shorter or
longer BpH1 has been conducted though BpH1 in B.
pertussis has been reported to vary in size between 182
and 206 amino acids.

Conclusions
To summarize, the size variation in Hc2 of C. trachomatis has previously been described as deletions of pentamers, but in the phylogenetic analyses we find a more
complex evolutionary pattern of recurring nucleotide
substitutions; deletions of elements and within-genome
duplication of repeat elements. Our study shows that
proteins similar to Hc2 also are present in several other
bacterial groups. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the
corresponding hctB gene variants cluster in agreement
with disease-causing properties. The high sequence variation of hctB provides a suitable target for genotyping
of C. trachomatis. The essential DNA binding capacity
of Hc2 in the unique biphasic life cycle of Chlamydiacae suggests that further experimental studies of DNA
binding capacity and growth rate would provide
increased knowledge about the role of length variation
in Hc2.
Methods
Specimens and species

The MLST database [13] contained 378 sequences from
clinical specimens or bacterial isolates (July 2009), of
which 199 were from Sweden and the remaining 179
from Europe, Africa, North America and Australia. The
strains included in the analysis are listed in additional
file 1: appendix 1. The last 121 bp of the hctB gene are
excluded from the MLST analysis. Consequently, additional sequencing was performed as previously described
[11] but with the reverse primer hctB_R1 (5’-ATTTCGACTCAGCCAATAAATACA-3’). Sequences covering
the hctB gene were aligned with ClustalW with default
values in the BioEdit 7.0 sequence alignment editor (Ibis
Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA). The repetitive elements
were aligned based on homology according to neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of the different types
of repeat element. Obtained sequence variants were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers are listed
in additional file 2: appendix 2. Accession numbers for
Hc2 in other Chlamydiales and Hc2-like proteins in
other genera are listed in additional file 3: appendix 3.
Sequence analysis

Repetitive amino acid elements were found with Dottup
plots using a word size of 20 and Pepinfo was used to
create plots that show the charge distribution. Both
Dottup and Pepinfo are part of EMBOSS (The European
Biology Open Software Suite, EMBnet, http://www.
emboss.org).

Phylogenetic analyses

Firstly, the phylogenetic relationship of the different
types of repetitive element was estimated with a neighbour-joining analysis [26] based on the absolute number
of base differences between the repeat element
sequences (since this number is small, correction for
multiple substitutions is not necessary). The resulting
tree (Figure 3C) was used as the guide tree for manually
adjusting the alignment of the repetitive elements (Figure 3B) in the alignment of the MLST sequences that
include hctB.
Secondly, the phylogeny of the 41 variants of MLST
targets was inferred using a Bayesian approach [e.g.’,
[27]]. The analysis was done with MrBayes 3.1.2, running under MPI [28]. A Bayesian analysis needs an
explicit substitution model, and this was selected based
on a hierarchical likelihood ratio test (hLRT) approach
[29] using Modeltest [30] together with PAUP* 4.0b10
[31].
MrBayes uses a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo method to compute the posterior probabilities for the clades. This algorithm has no defined
stop condition, but runs for a number of generations
and must be monitored for convergence, and thus completion, of the algorithm. The convergence was assessed
by monitoring the continuous-valued parameters using
the software Tracer 1.4 [32], resulting in the Bayesian
analysis being run for a total of 10 7 generations; the
first 2.5 × 106 subsequently being discarded as burn-in
(pre-convergence generations). The posterior probabilities were then summarized as a consensus tree with
MrBayes.
Thirdly, the consensus tree was rooted by paralog
rooting [33] based on the phylogeny of the repetitive
elements from the first step, producing the final phylogenetic hypothesis.
Lastly, to check for conflicting signals and possible
patterns of recombination, a recombination network of
the sequences was computed using SplitsTree 4.10 [34].
