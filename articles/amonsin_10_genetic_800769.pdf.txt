Abstract
In January and November 2008, outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported in 4 provinces of Thailand. Eight
Influenza A H5N1 viruses were recovered from these 2008 AI outbreaks and comprehensively characterized and
analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic relatedness, virulence determinants, and possible sites of reassortment.
The results show that the 2008 H5N1 viruses displayed genetic drift characteristics (less than 3% genetic differences), as commonly found in influenza A viruses. Based on phylogenetic analysis, clade 1 viruses in Thailand were
divided into 3 distinct branches (subclades 1, 1.1 and 1.2). Six out of 8 H5N1 isolates have been identified as reassorted H5N1 viruses, while other isolates belong to an original H5N1 clade. These viruses have undergone interlineage reassortment between subclades 1.1 and 1.2 and thus represent new reassorted 2008 H5N1 viruses. The
reassorted viruses have acquired gene segments from H5N1, subclade 1.1 (PA, HA, NP and M) and subclade 1.2
(PB2, PB1, NA and NS) in Thailand. Bootscan analysis of concatenated whole genome sequences of the 2008 H5N1
viruses supported the reassortment sites between subclade 1.1 and 1.2 viruses. Based on estimating of the time of
the most recent common ancestors of the 2008 H5N1 viruses, the potential point of genetic reassortment of the
viruses could be traced back to 2006. Genetic analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses has shown that most virulence
determinants in all 8 genes of the viruses have remained unchanged. In summary, two predominant H5N1
lineages were circulating in 2008. The original CUK2-like lineage mainly circulated in central Thailand and the reassorted lineage (subclades 1.1 and 1.2) predominantly circulated in lower-north Thailand. To prevent new reassortment, emphasis should be put on prevention of H5N1 viruses circulating in high risk areas. In addition, surveillance
and whole genome sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed for monitoring the genetic drift of
the virus and new reassorted strains, especially in light of potential reassortment between avian and mammalian
H5N1 viruses.
Findings
H5N1 influenza A virus has caused avian influenza (AI)
outbreaks worldwide. In Thailand, 7 major AI outbreaks
have been reported since early 2004 [1-3]. In January
2008, outbreaks of H5N1 virus occurred in two provinces, Nakhon Sawan and Phichit. The outbreak in
Nakhon Sawan affected 60,000 birds in a broiler farm
and chicken in nearby backyards, while the outbreak in
Phichit occurred among backyard chicken. In November

2008, H5N1 outbreaks were also reported in two provinces, Sukhothai and Uthai Thani. Both outbreaks
occurred among backyard poultry in villages (Fig 1).
Currently, at least two clades of influenza A virus
(H5N1) have been reported in Thailand including
clade1 viruses which are predominant in lower-north
and central Thailand and clade2.3.4 viruses which are
predominant in northeast Thailand [1,3,4]. Clade1
H5N1 viruses in Thailand have been further divided
into 3 distinct subclades including the original clade1
(CUK2-like), clade1.p1 (PC168-like) and clade1.p2
(PC170-like) [3,5]. One study has documented evidence
of genetic reassortment of H5N1 viruses in Thailand in

2007 [6]. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized the 2008 H5N1 viruses recovered during the 6th
and 7th waves of AI outbreaks in Thailand. The 2008
H5N1 viruses were compared with H5N1 isolates
obtained from each wave of AI outbreaks in Thailand.
The whole genome sequences of the viruses were analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic relatedness, virulence determinants, and possible sites of reassortment
among H5N1 viruses.
Eight H5N1 viruses were isolated from Nakhon Sawan
(n = 3), Phichit (n = 1), Sukhothai (n = 2) and Uthai
Thani (n = 2) (Table 1 and Fig 1). The viruses were isolated by embryonated egg inoculation [7]. All 8 viruses
were confirmed as Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 by
real-time-RT-PCR [8]. Whole genome sequences were
obtained as previously described [9]. Phylogenetic and
genetic relatedness analyses were conducted using the
MEGA 4.0 program applying the neighbor-joining (NJ)

approach. Bootstrapping support for tree topologies was
also performed with 1000 replicates using MEGA 4.0
[10]. In addition, Bayesian trees were generated using
MrBayes V.3.1.2 [11]. Nucleotide identities and genetic
analyses were performed using the MegAlign program
(DNASTAR). Genetic recombination analysis of H5N1
viruses was performed by Bootscan analysis [12]. Potential sites of genetic reassortment were examined by
using tMRCA analysis in a Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo BMCMC [13] framework using BEAST
version 1.5.4 [11]. Substitution model SRD06 was used.
BMCMC runs contained 20 million generations and the
convergence of the runs was inspected using Tracer version 1.5. LogCombiner V1.5.4 and Tree Annotator
V.1.5.4 were used to combine the results of multiple
runs and calculate the mean evolutionary rates and
divergence times. Dated phylogeny trees were visualized
with Figtree V.1.2.3 [11]. All 8 H5N1 viruses including

location and date of isolation as well as nucleotide
sequence GenBank accession numbers are shown in
table 1.
Nucleotide identities of the eight genes showed that all
2008 viruses displayed genetic drift characteristics commonly found in influenza A viruses. The viruses are closely related to clade1 2004-2007 viruses with high
nucleotide identity. The percentage of nucleotide identity between 2008 H5N1 viruses (NS-339) and 20042008 H5N1 isolates are within the range of 97.4-99.9%
(PB2), 97.7-100%(PB1), 97.9-99.9%(PA), 97.8-99.6%(HA),
98.8-99.9%(NP), 98.0-100%(NA), 98.2-99.9%(M) and
98.3-100%(NS) (Table 2). The genetic distance among
H5N1 viruses circulating in Thailand over the 5-year
course has remained below 3% indicating genetic drift
characteristics of the viruses.
The 2008 H5N1 viruses belong to clade1 which can be
further divided into 3 distinct branches including subclade1 (CUK2-like), subclade1.1 (PC168-like) and subclade1.2 (PC170-like) (Fig 2 and Fig 3 and Table 3).
Similar findings have been reported previously [3,5].
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that six
2008 H5N1 isolates grouped in subclade1.1. On the
other hand, two 2008 H5N1 isolates (ST-351 and CU-

354) clustered in the original clade1. Unlike the HA
gene, phylogenetic analysis of the NA gene showed that
seven 2008 H5N1 isolates grouped in another subclade1.2. Phylogenetic analyses of the internal genes of
2008 H5N1 also yielded results similar to those of the
HA (PA,NP,M) and NA gene (PB2,PB1,NS). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the 2008 H5N1 isolates
(n = 6) are new reassorted H5N1 viruses of subclade1.1
(PA,HA,NP,M) and 1.2 (PB2,PB1,NA,NS). These data
suggest that the 2008 H5N1 viruses are either reassortant strains descending from inter-lineage reassortment
of subclade1.1 and 1.2 viruses or possibly the original
strains circulating since 2004. Similar conclusion has
been documented in previous publications [3,6]. Geographically, the reassorted strains were predominantly
found in lower-north Thailand, while the original
CUK2-like strains mainly circulated in central Thailand.
In order to study the reassortment of the viruses, lineage identification and the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of H5N1 isolates representing 7
waves of AI outbreaks were examined. Our result
showed that the 2004 H5N1 isolates (NIAH7540 and
NIAH 8246) had undergone genetic drift and resulted in
a new lineage of PB2, HA, NP and NA genes (Table 3).

* The viruses characterized in this study.
** M gene clusters in only 2 lineages (lineages 1 and 1.1)

The tMRCA estimate for the HA and NA genes of
NIAH7540 and NIAH8246 was dated to 2003.75 (95%
HPD; 2003.41-2004.00) and 2003.65 (95%HPD; 2003.252003.97), respectively (Additional files 1, 2 and 3). In
2005-2006, two complete subclades were found as subclade1.1 (PC168) and subclade1.2 (CK160 and PC170).
The tMRCA estimate for HA gene of PC168 and PC170
was dated to 2005.79 and 2004.78, respectively. This
result suggests that the new subclades 1.1 and 1.2 of
H5N1 in Thailand originated between 2004 and 2005.
From 2007 to 2008, one 2007 H5N1 isolate (ICRC195)
and 6 2008 H5N1 isolates (NS-339, PC-340, NS-341,
NS342, NIAH-114843 and NIAH-115067) became
new reassorted viruses between subclades1.1 and 1.2
(Table 3). The tMRCA estimate for 2007-2008 reassorted viruses was dated to 2006.25-2007.82 (95%HPD;
2005.45-2008.00) (Additional files1,2 and 3). This result
suggests that the potential site of genetic reassortment
of Thai H5N1 originated between 2006 and 2007. The
new reassorted viruses circulating in Thailand since
2007 may be the result of a strong bottleneck effect that
caused only a few lineages to remain in the area resulting in genetic reassortment [6]. However, original clade
H5N1 viruses (ST-351 and CU-354) still circulated. To
confirm reassortment among H5N1 isolates, the viruses
were analyzed using Bootscan analysis [12,14]. The
Bootscan plots of 2005-2006 H5N1 (CK160 and PC170)
show high sequence identity to subclade1.2, while genes

of 2006 H5N1 (PC168) have high sequence similarity to
subclade 1.1 (Fig 4). Bootscan analysis of 2007 H5N1
(ICRC-195) and 2008 H5N1 (NS-339,PC-340,NS-341,
NS-342) shows high sequence identity between the
putative reassorted viruses and group1.1 in the PA,HA,
NP,M genes, and group 1.2 in the PB2,PB1,NA,NS
genes. Bootscan plot supports the recombinant points
near the junctions of PB1/PA, NP/NA, NA/M and M/
NS in the concatenated genomes of 2008 H5N1 viruses
(Fig 4). This result confirms that the new reassorted
viruses had acquired four gene segments from group1.1
and other genes from group1.2 [3]. It is noted that
Bootscan and tMRCA analysis have been used to confirm reassortment of H5N1viruses from Indonesia [14].
The 2008 H5N1 isolates displayed HPAI characteristics
similar to those of the 2004-2007 (genotype Z) viruses,
but different from genotype V viruses [1,4] (Table 4).
The HA gene contained the polybasic amino acids at
the HA cleavage site indicating HPAI characteristics
[15]. Amino acids related to the receptor binding site
Q222-G224 have remained unchanged indicating the
viruses preferentially bind to the avian receptor [16]. All
2008 viruses contained 7 N-link glycosylation sites
which have remained unaltered since 2004. Conservation of the 154-156 glycosylation site in Thai isolates
but not in the clade2.2 viruses might indicate the virulence factors of the virus in the region [17]. All 2008
H5N1 have retained amino acid residues at positions

83(A), 86(V) and 141(S) similar to 2004-2007 H5N1
viruses. However, some 2008 H5N1 isolates (except for
ST-351 and CU-354) display amino acid polymorphisms
at the antigenic site E at positions 138(Q138L) and 140
(K140R). The results indicate that 2008 H5N1 viruses
had undergone genetic drift and thus, amino acid
changes at residues 138 and 140. As for NA, the 2008
H5N1 viruses display 20 amino acid deletions in the NA
stalk region indicating evolutionary changes of the
viruses [16]. The 2008 H5N1 viruses do not harbor any
mutation at amino acid positions E119,H275,R293 and
N295 of NA proven responsible for Oseltamivir resistance which fortunately suggests Oseltamivir sensitive
viruses [18-21]. On the other hand, the 2008 viruses
show Amantadine resistant amino acids in M2 at L26I
and S31N but not at positions 27,30,64,66 [22-24]. In
NS1, the 2008 H5N1 viruses contain 5 amino acid deletions which have remained unchanged since 2004. As
for NS1, D92 at position 92 has remained unaltered
which is related to virulence in mammalian species due
to the antiviral effects of interferons and TNF [25]. The
2008 H5N1 viruses contain ESEV residues at the C-terminus of NS1 indicating high virulence [26]. As for the
PB2 gene, the viruses contain E627 indicating low virulence in mammalian species [27]. An E627K mutation in
PB2 would indicate increased viral replication efficiency
in mammals [28]. Analysis of amino acids associated
with human and avian H5N1 viruses indicated that
the reassorted 2008 H5N1 viruses possess both human
and avian characteristics. It is noted that the virulence
of these reassortant viruses will need to be further
confirmed in an animal model to validate their
pathogenicity.
In conclusion, the clade nomenclature of H5N1
viruses has been determined based on the HA gene [29].
The viruses examined in this study have undergone
inter-lineage reassortment and thus represent the
genetic parents of the new reassorted 2008 H5N1
viruses. The potential site of genetic reassortment of
Thai 2008 H5N1 could be traced backed to 2006. Bootscan analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses supported the
reassortment sites. The new reassorted viruses have
acquired four gene segments (PA,HA,NP,M) from subclade1.1 and four genes (PB2,PB1,NA,NS) from subclade1.2. This finding raises concerns with regard to
circulation of newly reassorted viruses in Thailand. Geographically, the 2008 reassorted lineages predominantly
circulated in the lower-north provinces of Thailand,
while the original CUK2 lineage is mainly found in the
central provinces. This phenomenon may be due to the
strong bottle-neck effect in the region especially in the
lower north of Thailand. To prevent future reassortment, emphasis should be put on prevention and control of AI outbreaks in the lower north of Thailand, not

only in avian species but also in mammals [30,31], since
a human-animal interface could create any emerging
virus similar to the recently emerged pandemic H1N1
[32]. In addition, surveillance and whole genome
sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed for monitoring the genetic drift of the virus and
identifying new reassorted strains, especially in light of
potential reassortment between avian and mammalian
H5N1 viruses.
