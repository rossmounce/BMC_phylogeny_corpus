Abstract
Background: Human disease genes can be distinguished from essential (embryonically lethal) and non-disease
genes using gene attributes. Such attributes include gene age, tissue specificity of expression, regulatory capacity,
sequence length, rate of sequence variation and capacity for interaction. The resulting information has been used
to inform data mining approaches seeking to identify novel disease genes. Given the dynamic nature of this field
and the rapid rise in relevant information, we have chosen to perform a single integrated mining approach to
explore relationships among gene attributes and thereby characterise evolutionary trends associated with disease
genes.
Results: All against all cross comparison of 2,522 disease gene attributes revealed significant relationships existed
between the age, disease-association and expression pattern of genes and the tissues within which they are
expressed. We found that the over-representation of disease genes among old genes holds for tissue-specific
genes, but the correlation between age and disease association vanished when conditioning on tissue-specificity.
Of the 32 tissues studied, the genes expressed in pancreas are on average older than the genes expressed in any
other tissue, while the testis expressed the lowest proportion of old genes. Following a focussed analysis on the
impact of regulatory apparatus on evolution of disease genes, we show that regulators, comprising transcription
factors and post-translation modified proteins, are over-represented among ancient disease genes. In addition, we
show that the proportion of regulator genes is affected by gene age among disease genes and by tissue-specificity
among non-disease genes. Finally, using 55,606 true positive gene interaction data, we find that old disease genes
interacts with other old disease genes and interacting new genes interacts with genes originating from higher
phylostrata.
Conclusion: This study supports the non-random nature of the human diseasome. We have identified a variety of
distinct features and correlations to other molecular attributes that can be used to distinguish the set of disease
causing genes. This was achieved by harnessing the power of mining large scale datasets from OMIM and other
databases. Ultimately such knowledge may contribute to the identification of novel human disease genes and an
enhanced understanding of human biology.

Background
Human diseases associated genes, collectively termed as
the diseasome, are the focus of extensive studies. The
consistent association of individual gene variants with
disease has facilitated the decoding of the molecular
basis of heritable diseases. On a larger scale, the diseasome itself has been scrutinized for characteristics that
distinguish it from the remainder of the genome. Such
studies on the diseasome have focussed on identifying
causal mutations, mode of inheritance, their expression
across a wide spectrum of tissues and to identify
whether they are essential or non-essential genes (i.e. to
test their embryonic lethality) [1]. For instance, it is well
established that non-synonymous DNA mutations causing disease are atypical both in their rate and pattern of
evolution [2], enriched at highly conserved amino acid
positions [2] resulting in large changes in physicochemical properties of amino acids and seem likely to have
severe effects on protein stability.
Following the availability of the human genome and
an atlas of disease associated genes deposited in OMIM
(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) [3] and other
databases [4], researchers focussed on combining these
datasets to gain insights into the evolution of the
human diseasome. For instance, López-Bigas and coworkers [5,6] classified over 1,600 human disease genes
from various databases and studied their properties
using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and expression across
different tissues. They observed that the functional pattern of genes causing dominant and recessive diseases is
markedly different and report extensive correlations
between disease gene attributes. Based on these findings,
they proposed that the division of human diseasome by
mode of inheritance (dominant or recessive) could
enhance both understanding of the disease process and
prediction of candidate disease genes.
Furthermore, a number of groups applied comparative
genomic approaches to study evolution of disease genes.
For instance, Huang et al[7] investigated whether
human disease genes differ significantly from their
rodent orthologs with respect to their overall levels of
conservation and their rates of evolutionary change. Following comparison of human genome with mouse and
rat genome sequences for disease genes, they report that
most (99.5%) human disease genes have been retained
in rodent genomes. Using a large set of disease and
non-disease genes, Smith et al[2] compared human with
rodents to infer evolutionary patterns. They measured
Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks between disease and non-disease
genes in human and found significant difference in Ka/
Ks ratios. They also describe the evolution of disease
and non-disease genes based on protein structure, gene
length and tissue specificity. Applying various in silico

Page 2 of 10

approaches, Kondrashov et al [8] compared 18 crucial
parameters among 1,273 human disease genes and
reported that disease genes evolve more slowly, have
wider phylogenetic distributions, code for longer proteins containing more alanine and glycine and less histidine, lysine and methionine, possess larger numbers of
longer introns with more accurate splicing signals and
have higher and broader expressions.
Phylostratigraphic (ps) approach is a method to quantify and statistically analyze gene emergence at different
levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. The approach is
based on the assumption that at least a significant fraction of genes has retained their function after origination [9]. This approach was developed by Domazet-Lošo
et al [9] to uncover the genomic history of major adaptations in metazoans. Later, the authors used this ps
approach [10] to study the evolution of human genes
and reported that disease genes tend to be ‘old’ rather
than ‘young’. In this study, authors also suggested that
genetic disease is an inescapable component of evolution. This is somewhat counterintuitive because diseaseassociated genes would be expected to be selected
against by natural evolution and rapidly eliminated from
the population and not maintained over extended periods of time. Alternatively, disease-associated genes may
have previously evolved to participate in highly-regulated processes that resulted in optimal conditions for a
given environment, but currently these functions are no
longer seen as optimal anymore but detrimental. Independently, we have investigated the impact of tissue
specificity and differential gene network connectivity on
disease associations of human genes [11]. We found
that disease associated genes are more likely to show
tissue specific expression and most frequently interact
with other disease genes. Based on these biological
properties, we developed a guilt-by-association algorithm that lead to the discovery of a group of 112 nondisease annotated genes that predominantly interact
with disease-associated genes, impacting on disease outcomes [11].
In the present study, and in order to further characterise evolutionary trends associated with disease genes,
we have integrated data generated in previous studies
enabling us to compare a greater number of attributes,
generated using current technologies (massively parallel
signature sequencing (MPSS) data generated from 32
tissues) combined with the latest version of OMIM. Specific attributes tested for relationships include gene age,
disease, tissue specificity, known interactions, sequence
length, chromosome location and whether or not a gene
product acts as a regulator by either being a transcription factor (TF) and/or harbouring post-translational
modification (PTM) sites.

Results and discussion
In order to identify novel, and biologically meaningful,
interconnections among disease genes, we carried out
all against all cross comparison of 2,522 disease genes
with a number of relevant molecular attributes (see
Methods) and raised several queries within the framework of evolution of disease genes. Table 1 shows the
breakdown of 12,753 genes within each category with
respect to age of the genes, tissue specificity, gene-gene
interactions, gene regulation, and association with disease. Significant findings from each of these comparisons are summarised in Table 2 (and Additional file 1)
and discussed in the following sections. As this study
aims at all against all relationships, the individual gene
attributes and its relationship with other attributes are
described simultaneously. For instance, while discussing

the impact of tissue specificity on disease genes, we also
describe the impact of regulators and/or gene length
that affect tissue specificity.
1. The interplay between evolution, disease genes and
tissue specificity

In a bid to elucidate the complex association among disease and non-disease genes, old and new genes and
housekeeping and tissue-specific genes, we integrated
functional gene attribute information spanning 12,753
genes. OLD and NEW genes represented 66 and 34% of
all genes, respectively. DIS and NDIS genes represented
24% and 76%, respectively. We observed that housekeeping genes are over-represented among old genes;
that tissue specific genes are over-represented among
disease genes; and that while disease genes are over-

represented among old genes, this over-representation is
more apparent among tissue specific genes. Overall, we
find that the age attribute has a strong correlation with
all the other gene attributes used in this study such as
tissue-specificity, gene-gene interactions, gene length
and regulatory nature of genes.
a. The impact of old genes and new genes over tissuespecificity

Old genes are ubiquitously expressed across tissues,
more associated with diseases and are more likely to be
regulators (Additional file 2: Table S2). There is in fact
a 1.32-fold higher occurrence of a regulatory function
among old genes (P < 0.0001). This decrease in regulatory function in new genes is counterintuitive as it
occurs when there is a significant increase in complexity
of organisms. This result is however consistent with the
idea that there is an upper limit to TF-based regulation
and warrants the emergence of novel regulatory
mechanisms. It is now clear that in higher eukaryotes
non-coding RNAs function as this alternative mechanism [12]. However, tissue-specificity, as measured by the
proportion of tissues in which a gene is expressed out of
a total of 32 tissues represented, drives many of the
above-mentioned relationships. In essence, conditioning
on tissue-specificity nullifies the correlations between
gene age and the other variables, except for the correlation between age and sequence length, meaning older
genes are still longer (Additional file 2: Table S3).
b. Disease genes and tissue-specificity

Disease genes are over-represented among old, interacting and genes involved in regulation and this over-representation is more pronounced among tissue-specific
genes. For instance, 31.2% disease genes are involved in
regulation compared to only 16.9% disease genes among
the non-regulatory genes. In addition, the strong correlation between disease genes and regulatory genes is intact
even when conditioning on tissue-specificity. The correlation between tissue specificity and disease-association
has also been reported by other groups [13,14]. Specifically, using a 2,400 human-rodent orthologs and 834 ratmouse orthologs and EST information, Duret and Mouchiroud [15] observed that tissue-specific genes exhibited
higher KA/KS ratios than housekeeping genes. Confirming this finding, Huang et al [7] demonstrated that much
of this effect is explicable in terms of a correlation
between a gene’s tissue-specificity and the cellular localization of its encoded protein. In this study, we found a
1.54 over-representation of disease genes among tissue
specific old genes compared to new genes. This relationship was not impacted by tissue-specificity in new genes.
2. The evolution of the regulatory diseasome

Post-transcriptional regulation by transcription factors
(TF) at the gene level [16] and post-translational

Page 4 of 10

modifications (PTM) [17] at the protein level are two
principal regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes. One of
the key components of this study was the consideration
of regulatory function in the context of disease and evolution. Specifically, we evaluated the role of regulators
during the course of evolution of disease genes by utilizing TF and PTM data. Firstly, we analysed regulators by
combining TF and PTM to explore disease genes from a
regulatory viewpoint. Next, we separated the TF and
PTM data to assess their independent effect during the
course of evolution represented by respective
phylostrata.
We found that genes encoding proteins with PTMs
are over-represented among old genes, housekeeping
genes, and interacting genes and in TF themselves. In
addition, of the 228 genes that have both PTMs and are
TF, 72 are disease genes (32% against 20% in all genes).
Out of these 228 PTMs and TFs, 30 (13%) originated in
ps5 (metazoa) compared to only 2% of total genes
formed in ps3 demonstrating significant inclusion of
regulatory modules to metazoans. This result is not surprising as metazoans by definition are multicellular
organisms and would undoubtedly require additional
levels of regulation to ensure accurate morphological
development. Finally, the proportion of regulators is
affected by age among disease genes (with ~ 1/3 more
regulator genes among old genes compared to new
genes), while it is affected by tissue-specificity among
non-disease genes (also with ~1/3 more regulators
among housekeeping genes compared to tissue-specific
genes) (Additional file 2: Table S4).
When regulatory apparatus was studied separately for
TF and PTM (see Figure 1), we found an over-representation of TF originating in ps3 (fungi) at 28.6% compared to only 7.8% of all genes being TF. We did not
observe an over-representation of PTM originating at
ps3. This suggests that the evolution from eukaryotes to
fungi requires a substantial increase in transcriptional
regulation, while post-translational modification
mechanisms are less relevant. In contrast, at ps5 (metazoa), a significant over-representation of both TF and
PTM was clearly apparent. PTMs experienced another
surge at ps11 (vertebrata) that was not coupled with a
surge in TF, indicating significant increase in protein
level regulation post vertebrates during the course of
evolution.
Other less understood eukaryotic regulatory mechanisms such as CpG island methylation was not included
in the analysis. Although CpG island methylation plays
an important role in epigenetic gene control in general
via hyper and hypo methylation of regulatory regions
(promoters) their precise role across the ‘diseasome’ is
not well established. For instance, there are independent
studies focussed on cancer [18] or methylation patterns

within the Major Histo-compatibility Complex (MHC)
as a part of human epigenome project (http://www.epigenome.org/).
3. The pattern of gene-gene interactions among gene
attributes

We looked at the combined effect of age (old vs. new),
disease-association (yes vs. no) tissue-specificity and regulatory condition (yes vs. no) on the number of interactions. By and large, age had the highest effect with Old
genes having ~50% more connections than New genes
(9.227 vs. 6.1245; P < 0.0001). Regulatory role had the
second highest effect, with regulators having ~40% more
connections than non-regulators (8.980 vs. 6.371; P <
0.0001). Importantly, after adjusting for these two variables (age and regulatory conditions), neither tissue-specificity nor disease-association were found to be
significant (P > 0.05) sources of variation in the number
of connections observed for a given gene. However,
there was a tendency for DIS genes to have more connections than NDIS genes (8.145 vs. 7.206; P = 0.0675),
and for HK genes to have more connections than TS
genes (8.109 vs. 7.242; P = 0.0855). While the original
study of Domazet-Loso and Tautz [10] failed to find a
significant re-ranking of gene functional ontologies
when comparing disease and non-disease genes in each
of the phylostrata, the incorporation of 55,606 true

positive interactions among 7,197 genes [19] allowed us
to further explore these relationships. Three major findings were of particular relevance: Firstly, there was a
bias in the way genes interact, with interacting old
genes more likely to interact with other old genes; Secondly, interacting new genes are more likely to interact
with other new genes; Finally, we observed that new
genes interact more cohesively than old genes.
4. The non-random distribution of genes along the
genome

Genes are non-uniformly distributed in the human genome and we asked whether this heterogeneity may
further our understanding of evolutionary trends among
disease genes. Consequently, we produced a chromosomal distribution of genes according to their evolutionary
age and disease status (Figure 2). The chromosomal
locations of all the genes were mapped to the genome
according to their evolutionary age and disease status
and classified into four categories: Old-Non-Disease,
Old-Disease, New-Non-Disease and New-Disease. We
noted that the sex chromosomes have a higher proportion of disease genes; 28.7 ± 1.9 % of genes in X and
38.3 ± 8.4 % of genes in Y, compared to only 13.7 ± 1.1
% of genes in Chromosome 19. This disproportionately
high number of hereditary diseases for the X chromosome was well documented during analysis of its

genome sequence [20]. In contrast, Chromosome 19 has
the lowest proportion of disease genes, the shortest
genes (average length 24.1 ± 1.3 kb) and tissue-specificity comparable to the X and Y sex chromosomes. This
was attributed to Chromosome 19 having the highest
gene density of all chromosomes, more than double the
genome-wide average [21]. Expanding this analysis, we
tested whether there was a chromosome whose genes
have a higher than average specificity for a given tissue
(see Figure 3). This analysis revealed that all chromosomes seem to have a large proportion of genes
expressed in testis and a low proportion of genes
expressed in pancreas. Additionally, for some tissues
there was a disproportionate representation of genes
from a single chromosome. As an example, we found an
over-representation of genes expressed in cerebellum
located on chromosome 13. From this we predict that
chromosome 13 may be a potential target to study central nervous system (CNS) diseases. A search of the literature confirms that deletions in chromosome 13
impacting cerebellum development have been identified
(see McCormack et al. [22] and references therein) and
as such further justifies fine mapping approaches in the
search for QTL.

5. Expression patterns and gene attribute distribution
across tissues

By associating gene expression patterns across 32 tissues
to molecular attributes used in this study (old, new, disease, non-disease, etc.) we were able to provide novel
insights into possible trends in evolution of various tissues from a diseasome viewpoint. In other words, any
non-uniform proportions of disease and non-disease
genes may unravel the complexity of evolution of tissues
and their association with diseases (pancreatic cancer,
Alzheimer’s, etc). Therefore, for each of the 32 tissues,
we explored the proportion of (1) old genes (ie. those
that evolved in ps1 or ps2); (2) disease genes; (3) number of tissues where the genes are expressed; and (4)
regulators in each tissue (Figure 4). We found that the
genes expressed in pancreas are on average older than
the genes expressed in any other tissue, have a higher
association with disease and are expressed in more tissues, suggesting that the pancreas could be one of the
first discrete tissues to evolve. This finding is in agreement with a phylogeny and ontogeny based study of the
pancreas wherein authors propose that the pancreas is
indeed one of the first tissues to evolve [23]. Conversely,
genes expressed in the lungs are on average the newest,

but this is not the tissue with the lowest proportion of
disease genes. Instead, the lowest proportion of disease
genes was found in the testis followed by the trachea
and bone marrow. This finding is supported by another
study reporting the majority of retrogenes (new genes
formed through gene duplication) are specifically
expressed in testis, whereas their parental genes show
broad expression patterns [24]. It should be noted with
caution that expression of disease genes cannot be used
as a parameter to asses whether these tissues are prone
for diseases. In other words, this data is insufficient to
conclude that the pancreas is more prone to disease

than the testis. Further, the testis was also found to
have the highest proportion of tissue-specific genes.
Finally, the retina showed a high proportion of disease
genes (second only to pancreas) even though it ranks
among the newest tissues.

Conclusion
We have used a systems biology approach to integrate
large relevant datasets to yield novel, meaningful biological insights into the evolution and tissue-specificity of
disease genes. Through the incorporation of tissue-specificity attribute, we found that the recently documented

over-representation of disease genes among old genes is
certainly true for tissue-specific genes, while among
housekeeping genes this relationship vanishes. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the challenge of establishing errorfree relationships due to the myriad of possible interactions that could exist among large numbers of heterogeneous variables.
Researchers have intuitively focused on aberrations in
regulatory genes as a likely basis for the disease development. Our findings support this approach because disease genes were found to be over-represented in both
the PTM and TF regulatory categories. Finally, this
study represents a conceptual scaffold for dissecting
human diseasome and reveals novel correlations among
molecular attributes, some known, but many unexpected, that might be helpful in the identification of
novel genes disrupted in diseases.

Methods
When discussing gene attributes, a notation consistent
with Domazet-Loso and Tautz [10] is used where old
refers to old genes, originating in ps1 or ps2 (i.e., up to
eukaryotes and before fungi); new genes (ps3 to ps19);
Tissue-specific genes (expressed in < 14 tissues); Housekeeping genes (expressed in ≥ 14 tissues); Short/Long:
Genes shorter/longer than 24 kb in length; Regulatory
genes: Genes with regulatory role, they are either transcription factors or and/or harbour at least one posttranslational modification in encoded protein.
Data integration and assembly
Our study uses the following distinct data sets:
1. The list of human genes along with their phylostrata
of origin was downloaded from (Domazet-Loso and Tautz
[10]) (Ensembl version 45 -22,937 unique proteins).
2. Expression data from massively parallel signature
sequencing (MPSS) covering 182,719 tag signatures
across 32 tissues [25].
3. These two datasets were merged to form a single
list of 12,753 genes with phylostrata of origin and
expression abundance.
4. The complete list of TFs was retrieved from BiblioSphere [26]. Data for PTM for human data were
obtained from the most recent version of Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD – Release 7) [27].
Although TF and PTM bring about regulatory mechanisms at different phases of cellular process, we have
combined TF and PTM and refer to them as simply regulators in order to capture the maximum regulatory
apparatus in eukaryotes.
5. The interaction data comprising 55,606 true positive
interactions among 7,197 genes were downloaded from
functional studies [19].

6. The information for disease association of genes
was obtained from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database [3] with 2,522 of them defined
as disease-causing (i.e., associated with either known disease phenotype or polymorphic sequence known).
AWK and Perl scripts were written to assemble and
analyse data on a Linux server.

Statistical analyses and significance
When relationships were based on Pearson correlation
and partial correlation coefficients, statistical significance
was assessed using the Procedure CORR of SAS version
9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
When proportions were being compared, a two-tailed
z-test for the difference between two proportions was
performed assuming unequal group variances as
described by AP Statistics Tutorial (http://stattrek.com/
AP-Statistics-4/Test-Difference-Proportion.aspx). As a
guide, the reader is reminded that having any two proportions each computed with more than 1,000 records,
if these two proportions differ by more than 2% then
the difference is significant at P < 5% significance (or
95% confidence).
Least square means for the number of connections
across the levels of the various class variables were
obtained from fitting linear models using the Procedure
GLM (General Linear Models) of SAS version 9.1.3
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A two-sided t-test
was used to test the significance of the difference
between two least square means of interest (eg. connections in DIS vs connection in NDIS genes).
