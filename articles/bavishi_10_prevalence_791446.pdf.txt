Abstract
Background: Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 is a metabolically versatile organism that belongs to a-3 subdivision of
Proteobacteria. The present study was to identify the extent, history, and role of gene duplications in R. sphaeroides
2.4.1, an organism that possesses two chromosomes.
Results: A protein similarity search (BLASTP) identified 1247 orfs (~29.4% of the total protein coding orfs) that are
present in 2 or more copies, 37.5% (234 gene-pairs) of which exist in duplicate copies. The distribution of the
duplicate gene-pairs in all Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) differed significantly when compared to the COG
distribution across the whole genome. Location plots revealed clusters of gene duplications that possessed the
same COG classification. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine a tree topology predicting either a
Type-A or Type-B phylogenetic relationship. A Type-A phylogenetic relationship shows that a copy of the proteinpair matches more with an ortholog from a species closely related to R. sphaeroides while a Type-B relationship
predicts the highest match between both copies of the R. sphaeroides protein-pair. The results revealed that ~77%
of the proteins exhibited a Type-A phylogenetic relationship demonstrating the ancient origin of these gene
duplications. Additional analyses on three other strains of R. sphaeroides revealed varying levels of gene loss and
retention in these strains. Also, analyses on common gene pairs among the four strains revealed that these genes
experience similar functional constraints and undergo purifying selection.
Conclusions: Although the results suggest that the level of gene duplication in organisms with complex genome
structuring (more than one chromosome) seems to be not markedly different from that in organisms with only a
single chromosome, these duplications may have aided in genome reorganization in this group of eubacteria prior
to the formation of R. sphaeroides as gene duplications involved in specialized functions might have contributed to
complex genomic development.

Background
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, a purple nonsulfur
photosynthetic eubacterium, belongs to the a-3 subgroup of Proteobacteria [1,2], members of which display
an array of metabolic capabilities in the assembly and
regulation of metabolic functions [3], electron transport
[4-6], bioremediation [7], and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis
[8,9]. In addition, many members of this subgroup
establish different types of eukaryotic associations
[10-14]. The genome of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 has been
completely sequenced and annotated [15] and is comprised of two circular chromosomes and five plasmids.

Bacterial species continue to encounter different ecological niches, and their genome size increases by
acquiring habitat relevant genes by horizontal gene
transfer [16-18] and gene duplication [19,20], which
together play a major role in the evolution of both genome size and complexity. Duplicated genes are ubiquitously present among eukaryotes and prokaryotes
[21-24]. Analyses on over 100 fully sequenced eubacterial and archaeal genomes have revealed a great extent of
DNA sequence duplications [25], however it remains
unclear whether the expansions of genome size and
complexity were essential for adaptive phenotypic
diversification.
The present study aimed to systemically identify the
extent and history of gene duplication in the genome
of R. sphaeroides. A hypothesis that the complex

genome structure (large genome size and the presence
of multiple chromosomes) requires an extensive
amount of gene duplications was examined by determining the distribution of duplicated genes on both
chromosomes and plasmids and comparing the determined levels of R. sphaeroides gene duplication to that
in other bacterial species that possess a single chromosome. After determining the extent of these gene duplications, two additional hypotheses were devised. First, a
hypothesis was formulated to test whether gene duplications were selectively preserved in specific Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COGs) necessary to accommodate the diverse growth mode of this organism. Second,
a hypothesis was tested to ascertain whether this level
of large-scale gene duplications occurred after the
diversification of members of the a-3 subgroup of Proteobacteria. The role of gene duplications in understanding the evolution of new metabolic functions is
discussed along with the age and functional constraints
of these gene pairs across four strains of R. sphaeroides.
Thus, this study investigates the nature of gene duplications in an organism with complex genome structuring
in order to determine the role of such duplications in
the evolution of new metabolic functions and complex
genome development.

Methods
Protein homology and duplication search analysis

A protein homology search was performed using the
gapped BLASTP [26], which included gap penalties,
and was therefore more conservative in database
searches. The search was conducted in two steps. First,
each protein sequence of the R. sphaeroides genome
was used to search the homologous proteins against
their own database. Then, each of the corresponding
homologous protein sequences identified by the first
step was reciprocally paired, based on a threshold
E-value of ≤ 10 -20 . The cut-off value for the percent
amino acid identity was set at ≥ 30%, which defines
the level above which gene duplication can be reliably
identified in many bacterial species [15,27,28]. However, certain duplicated genes in R. sphaeroides that
did not meet the specified search criteria (i.e. possessed less than 30% identity) have been identified or
reported in the past [15,28]. These identified or
reported duplications were incorporated for subsequent analysis. Also, to approximately determine the
prevalence and arrangement of selected gene duplications in three other completely sequenced R. sphaeroides strains (ATCC 17025, ATCC 17029, KD131),
each gene (those designated as “Orf 1”) in a duplicated
pair in R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 was subjected to BLASTP
analysis against the three R. sphaeroides strains, with
the same cutoff criteria utilized as before.

Analysis of the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs)

Gene homologs are families of genes, which encode
similar protein functions within a genome and between
genomes; if such genes are derived from different species, they are called orthologs, and if they are derived
from the same species, they are referred to as paralogs
[29]. The Cluster of Orthologous Groups [30,31] classifications provide a tool in examining gene roles.
There are four major COG functions, which include 1:
Information storage and Processing, 2: Cellular Processes, 3: Metabolism, 4: Poorly Characterized functions. These major groupings were further classified
into 25 sub-groups. However, a number of Orfs have
been classified into more than one COG as they
encode overlapping gene functions, while other Orfs
have poorly characterized functions. The percentage of
each COG functions, both in the general groups and
the sub-groups, among the duplicated genes was compared with the percentage of the respective COG functions over all genes present in the complete genome. A
chi-square (c 2 ) test was performed for both distribution comparisons with a null hypothesis assuming that
the gene duplications have the same COG distributions
as all the genes in the full genome. In addition, all 234
pairs were subsequently mapped onto CI and CII. The
level of divergence was indicated by the y-axis and the
height of the gene pinning and each gene’s major COG
group classification was color-coded.
Phylogenetic Analysis

To determine the origin and history of the gene duplications in R. sphaeroides, initially each protein in the protein-pairs was blasted against the microbial database at
NCBI using the BLASTP [26]. Geneious v4.6, a versatile
bioinformatics suite, was used to organize and perform
the protein similarity searches, generate alignments, and
construct phylogenetic trees [32]. Only organisms with
completely sequenced genomes were chosen to avoid
poor or incomplete sequence data from shotgun or partial genome sequencing projects.
For each set of homologous matches, there were four
proteins: the duplicated genes and an ortholog match
for each copy as only the best and most complete hits
to each gene in a pair were selected. For these duplicate
pairs, two alternative phylogenetic relationships were
predicted. The Type-A relationship was predicted when
a protein sequence branched with a homolog (ortholog)
from a closely related species rather than its counterpart
protein (paralog) within the R. sphaeroides genome,
whereas as Type-B relationship was predicted when the
duplicate protein copies within R. sphaeroides branched
with each other [28,33]. Additionally, four example phylogenetic analyses, two exhibiting Type-A phylogeny and
two exhibiting Type-B phylogeny, were carried out with

Functional Constraints Analysis

For the functional constraints analysis, comparisons
were conducted within all four R. sphaeroides strains.
More specifically, the 28 common gene pairs among the
four strains were utilized for the functional constraints
analysis where the genes in a given pair were compared
against one another. The synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates along with the nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate ratio were
calculated using the modified Yang-Nielsen algorithm
[37,38]. MUSCLE was used to align amino acid
sequences [34]. These aligned sequences were then
transformed into the original DNA sequences after
which, the KaKs_Calculator was used with each pair of
DNA sequences [39] to calculate the synonymous substitution rate (Ks), the nonsynonymous substitution rate
(K a ), and the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio
(ω = Ka/Ks). Under the MYN model, ω = 0.3, 1, and 3
were used for negative (purifying), neutral, and positive
selection, respectively [37,38]. A one-way ANOVA was
used to test whether the distributions of ω among the
four strains were dissimilar.
Horizontal Gene Transfer

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) features were estimated using Alien-Hunter, which predicts HGT events
using interpolated variable order motifs [40]. This
method exploits compositional biases to determine
potential HGT areas where abnormal (HGT) areas are
identified as those that are higher than a threshold
value, a value that is calculated using the sequence
structure of the input genome among other factors.
This software was used to determine the areas of possible HGT and the levels of HGT on CI and CII independently. The genes present within these regions
were additionally identified. Artemis [41] was used to
view the Alien-Hunter output.

Results
Extent of gene duplications in R. sphaeroides

Of the total 4242 protein coding genes in its genome, a
total of 1247 genes (29.4% of its genome) exist in multiple copies in the R. sphaeroides genome. Gene homologs
are present in different copies reflecting the diversity of
gene multiplication. Numbers of genes with 2, 3, 4 and
5 and more (≥ 5) copies were 468, 183, 152, and 444,
respectively. Approximately 73% of the total gene homologs represent two classes, genes with two copies (37.5%;
234 protein pairs) and genes with ≥ 5 copies (35.6%).
Genes with ≥ 5 copies represent various types of functions, for example, ABC type transporters, families of
transcriptional factors, and cell-signaling response regulators (data not shown). If genes that are present in
more than two copies were to be selected, determining
the lineage of such genes becomes functionally more
complex, especially as many such genes are also present
within multiple gene families. Moreover, the genes in
these families can be analogous instead of homologous,
meaning that they are similar due to function rather
than origin. As such, further analysis was carried out
only on genes which were identified as duplicate protein
pairs as listed in Additional file 1.
The mean amino acid identity of the protein-pairs
was 46.0% and the standard deviation was 19.5% with
a maximum amino acid identity of 99%. Gene homologs are dispersed either within each replicon or
between replicons in the genome of R. sphaeroides as
shown in Figure 1. Of the total 234 duplicate-genes,
196 gene duplications (83.8%) were chromosomal and
38 gene duplications (16.2%) were dispersed between

gene duplications common among the four R. sphaeroides strains.
Protein sequence alignments were carried out using
MUSCLE [34], a program known for its accuracy and
speed. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using
PhyML [35] with the WAG model [36] to generate
unrooted, maximum likelihood trees. Bootstrap values
were calculated using 100 replications for the trees
where topology was being determined. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed for all protein-pairs to
ascertain the tree topology (Type-A or Type B). If a set
of duplicated genes had their highest match to the same
ortholog, then the next highest ortholog match, if available, for one of the genes was utilized in the tree construction to ascertain accurately the duplication
topology.

chromosome and plasmid or between plasmids. Of
chromosomal gene duplications, intra-chromosomal
and inter-chromosomal gene duplications were 131
(56.0%) and 65 (27.8%), respectively. Of the 131 intrachromosomal gene duplications, 118 (50.4%) and 13
(5.5%) gene homologs were located within CI and CII,
respectively. Taking the sizes of the two chromosomes
into account (CI is three times larger than the size of
CII); the number of gene duplications found within CI
was significantly higher than the number of gene
duplications found within CII. Approximately 16.2% of
gene duplications involve plasmids where 9.8% of the
total gene duplications involve plasmids and chromosomes while 6.4% of the total genes duplications were
solely between plasmids.
The relationship between the percentage of homologous gene-pairs and their corresponding level of amino
acid divergence is shown in Figure 2. Amino acid divergence is defined as 100% minus the percentage identity
between the protein sequences. The protein sequence
conservation of the duplicated protein pairs varied
widely. Of the 234 gene-pairs, 204 gene-pairs showed
≥30% amino acid divergence between their corresponding protein homologs reflecting the rapid evolution of
these proteins, while 30 protein-pairs demonstrated
<30% divergence. Forty-two protein-pairs (17.9%) have
diverged between 51% - 60% of their of protein
sequences, 104 pairs (44.4%) exhibit the amino acid
divergence ranging from 61% - 70%, and approximately
10% (23 protein-pairs) of the total protein-pairs displayed amino acid divergence between 71%-80%. A
majority of gene homologs with low divergence (< 30%)

were representative of essential functions, of which 16
protein-pairs are conserved hypothetical proteins whose
metabolic functions remain unknown. The more
conserved proteins included for instance, DNA binding
proteins (ParA, ParB, Spb, a histone-like protein,
cold-shock DNA binding proteins), chemotaxis response
regulators (CheY), and periplasmic serine proteases
(ClpP, ClpX). On the other hand, gene homologs with
high level of amino divergence represented proteins
involved in cell structure (flagella formation) and cellular processes like metabolism, transport, replication,
transcription (s factors), and translation (see Additional
file 1 for more information).
Gene duplication and diverse COGs functions

The distribution of the duplicated genes present in each
of the cluster of orthologous group (COGs) was compared to distribution of genes representing these general
COGs in the complete genome as shown in Figure 3A.
Gene duplications were represented by all the COGs,
which included information processing (COG 1), cellular
processing (COG 2), metabolism (COG 3), and poorly
characterized functions (COG 4). A number of gene
duplications were not yet classified in any of these COG
functions (COG 0) since their functions are currently
unknown. For these analyses the individual genes were
examined since the copies have diverged in function
from their ancestors. For protein-pairs with multiple
functions, the COGs were counted by their categorizations, although this was a relatively infrequent
occurrence (8 genes). Analysis showed that the gene
duplications representing information processing, cellular processes, metabolism, and poorly characterized
functions constituted 10.7%, 18.8%, 40.2%, and 15.7% of
the gene duplications, respectively. The percentage of
genes in the genome of R. sphaeroides that fell under
these general COG categories of information processing,
cellular processes, metabolism, and poorly characterized
were 12.9%, 16.3%, 36.0% and 16.5%, respectively (data
taken from NCBI). The chi-square analysis demonstrated that the proportion of duplicated genes involved
in metabolism, information processing, cellular processes, or unknown functions were significantly different
from the overall proportion of total genes representing
these functions present in the complete genome
(c2 value = 9.585, p < 0.05). Further analysis on more
specific COGs revealed a greater distribution difference
between the gene duplications and the genes in the total
genome, as shown in Figure 3B. A chi-square test confirmed that the distributions were significantly different
(c2 value = 175.5041, p < 0.0001). The analysis revealed
that genes involved in group L (DNA replication,
recombination and repair), group N (cell motility and
secretion), group U (intracellular trafficking and

Specialized COG Functional Groups

Figure 3 A. A distribution of the two copy genes based on general Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) functions. The
genes are classified in 5 generalized groups: Not in COGs (Group 0); Information storage and processing (Group 1); Cellular processes (Group 2);
Metabolism (Group 3); Poorly characterized (Group 4). B. A distribution of the two copy genes based on specific Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COGs) of protein functions. A more detailed breakdown of the distribution of the genes is given based on different cellular functions
represented in 25 COG sub-groups. Of these classifiable COG groups, duplicated genes are present in 20 subgroups: J. Translation, ribosomal
structure and biogenesis; K. Transcription; L. DNA replication, recombination and repair; D. Cell division and chromosome partitioning; V. Defense
mechanisms; T. Signal transduction mechanisms; M. Cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane; N. Cell motility and secretion; U. Intracellular
trafficking and secretion; O. Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones. C. Energy production and conversion; G. Carbohydrate
transport and metabolism; E. Amino acid transport and metabolism; F. Nucleotide transport and metabolism; H. Coenzyme metabolism; I. Lipid
metabolism; P. Inorganic ion transport and metabolism; Q. Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; R. General function

secretion), group C (energy production and conversion),
group G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism), and
group H (coenzyme metabolism) were overrepresented
among genes evolved by gene duplication, while number
of genes representing other COG subgroups remained
low or fairly equal in percentages to the number of
genes representing those COGs in the overall genome of
R. sphaeroides.
Figure 4 depicts the distribution of the gene duplications on CI and CII. Although the majority of gene
duplications seem to be randomly distributed, there are
a few locations where clusters of gene duplications that
possess similar COG functions are found. On CI,
duplicated gene clusters representing COG 2 (cellular
processes) were found at two locations: between 1.7 - 1.8
Mb and between 3.0 - 3.1 Mb. In addition, duplicated
gene clusters representing COG 3 (metabolism) were
uncovered between 1.1 - 1.2 Mb and between 1.8 - 1.9
Mb. On CII, two duplicated gene clusters representing
COG 3 were present between 0.3 - 0.4 Mb and between
0.8 - 0.9 Mb. In addition, most of the gene duplications
in these clusters exhibit roughly the same level of amino
acid divergence.
Also, as about 40% of the gene duplications in R.
sphaeroides 2.4.1 are involved in cellular metabolism, it
is important to analyze some specific components of
gene duplication as related to cellular metabolism.

Carbon fixation is an important metabolic pathway that
contributes towards primary productivity and the physiological significance of carbon fixation in a-Proteobacteria species, including R. sphaeroides, is poorly
understood. However, a distinct organization of gene
duplications representing carbon metabolism is present
in R. sphaeroides. As shown in Figure 5 there are two
gene clusters on CI containing cbbA, cbbF, cbbG, cbbM,
cbbP, and cbbT while their duplicate counterparts exist
in a single cluster on CII. The amino acid identities
between these genes and their homologs on CII are 79%
(cbbA), 68% (cbbF), 84% (cbbG), 31% (cbbM), 87%
(cbbP), and 58% (cbbT). These gene clusters also seem
to be well conserved among all four sequenced strains
R. sphaeroides (2.4.1, ATCC 17025, ATCC 17029, and
KD131).
Origin of gene duplications and relationship among
R. sphaeroides strains

As a sample, four phylogenetic trees, two of Type-A and
two of Type-B, are shown in Figure 6. These phylogenetic trees depict data for hisD I and hisD II, sdhB and
frdB, sac1 and a hypothetical gene, and traI and a
hypothetical gene. Additional file 2 describes the amino
acid identity for each duplicate protein-pair, the two
ortholog matches, the identity with each of those ortholog matches to each R. sphaeroides protein in each

trees representing four of these relationships are shown above for hisDI and hisDII, sdhB and frdB, sac1 and a hypothetical protein, and traI and a
hypothetical protein. Each of these unrooted trees displayed a bootstrap value of 100. The offshoots represent branches and their lengths are
given (trees are not to scale). The relationships depict two types of topology - Type A or Type B.

duplicate protein-pair, the tree type (Type-A or Type-B)
for the protein-pair, and the bootstrap values for each
tree. Of the total 234 protein-pairs, ~77% of the protein-pairs (180 pairs) exhibited a Type-A relationship
and ~23% of the protein-pairs (54 pairs) showed a
Type-B relationship.
The strength of the tree topology was analyzed using
bootstrap values, information concerning which is also
shown in Additional file 2. Bootstrap values for 8 trees
could not be determined due to the lack of one or more
orthologs. Bootstrap values not only signify the significance of a tree topology (Type-A and Type-B), but also
provide an insight into the relative origin of a given
gene duplication. Gene duplication events that occurred
significantly before organism speciation would display
Type-A relationships with high bootstrap values. Gene
duplication events that occurred significantly after
organism speciation would display Type-B relationships
with similarly high bootstrap values. Of the 226 trees for
which bootstrap values were obtained, 209 (92.5%) had
bootstrap values ≥ 95. The bootstrap values remained
significant within both Type-A and Type-B phylogenetic
trees. Of the 180 Type-A trees, 172 (95.56%) exhibited ≥

95 bootstrap values while of the 46 Type-B trees, 37
(80.43%) exhibited ≥ 95 bootstrap values. Thus, the
majority of these trees demonstrated correct and significant trees topologies, which support the relative timings
of the origins of these gene duplications.
These results clearly show that a majority of gene
duplications in R. sphaeroides originated prior to the
formation of the R. sphaeroides lineage as also shown in
Table 1. Of the Type-A gene duplications, 58.33% (105
pairs) were found only on CI, 26.67% (48 pairs) were
found between CI and CII, and 6.11% (11 pairs) were
found only on CII. Since about 91% of the duplications
exhibiting a Type-A relationship were distributed on the
two chromosomes, these results submit that the origin
of multiple chromosomes in R. sphaeroides predates the
origin of this species. 13 proteins had indiscernible
matches to any orthologs in the current microbial database. Moreover, although a vast majority of the genes
(312 of 360 genes, 86.67%) showing Type-A trees and
these duplicated genes match with orthologs within aProteobacteria, a sizeable amount (48) of Type-A genes
had homology to bacteria outside of a-Proteobacteria
(13.33%). These other duplications were found primarily

Number of Matches

in b-Proteobacteria (3.33%) and g-Proteobacteria
(7.22%); as shown in Figure 7.
The number of significant matches (meeting the
designated criteria mentioned in the Materials and
Method section) of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 query protein
sequences to three other R. sphaeroides strains (ATCC
17025, ATCC 17029, and KD131) was also determined
(Additional file 3). The results show that there is significant variability with levels of gene loss and gene
retention. Merely 28 (11.97%) of the 234 queries had
only two gene matches, representing a duplication pair,
in all three strains. 26 (92.86%) of these 28 possessed
Type-A gene topology while only 2 (7.14%) possessed
Type-B topology. In 144 (61.54%) of the 234 queries,
at least one strain had two matches; 122 (84.72%) of
the 144 displayed Type-A topology while 22 (15.28%)
represented Type-B trees. Figure 8 details the distribution of the matches for the three strains. The match
distribution reveals varying levels of gene retention
among the organisms. A good deal of genes in the
three strains (40 - 50 genes) presented zero matches
suggesting that either these genes have been lost from
the organisms or they have sufficiently diverged as to
not present significant homology to their strain counterparts. In addition, R. sphaeroides ATCC 17029 has a
much lower number of 2 matches (67) and higher
numbers of 0 matches (50) and 1 match (100) in relation to those of the other strains.
Figure 9 provides four expanded phylogenetic trees
with genes from all four R. sphaeroides species (2.4.1,
ATCC 17025, ATCC 17029, and KD131) along with
two related genes from species outside of R. sphaeroides (orthologs). These genes in the other R. sphaeroides strains were also only present in only two copies.
The relationships again depict two types of topology -

Figure 8 The distribution of matches to the R. sphaeroides
2.4.1 query sequences. BLASTP analysis with each single gene in
each of the 234 duplicate gene pairs was performed against three
other R. sphaeroides strains (ATCC 17025, ATCC 17029, KD131). The
matches that met the specified criteria were kept and examined
accordingly. The picture depicts varying levels of gene loss and
retention among each of the strains.

Type A or Type B, where two trees are Type A and
two trees are Type B. The type A trees were between
phaD (RSP_0994) and a hypothetical protein
(RSP_3713) and between prfA (RSP_2907) and prfB
(RSP_2977). The type B trees were between cbbF1
(RSP_1285) and fbpB (RSP_3266) and between two
hypothetical proteins (RSP_3325 and RSP_3719). The
Type A trees demonstrate that one set of genes (the
duplicated set) in all R. sphaeroides strains branch
from the orthologs while on the Type B trees, the
duplications branch from R. sphaeroides genes while
the orthologs form their own branch offshoot. The
trees are most probably not instructive in terms of
specific strain formation and evolution and so were
not treated as such, but rather the genes were viewed
in terms two clusters paralleling the two genes in a
duplicate pair, where each cluster was a group of
directly related R. sphaeroides genes.
Analysis on the 28 common gene pairs among the
four R. sphaeroides strains revealed that the common
gene pairs are experiencing similar functional constraints within all four species. The correlation of nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates
for these gene pairs is shown in Figure 10. Under the
modified Yang-Nielsen algorithm, ω = 0.3, 1, and 3 were
used for negative, neutral, and positive selection, respectively [37,38]. The correlation data reveals that most of
the data points cluster similarly with all ω values less
than 0.3, indicative of negative or purifying selection
operating on these orthologs. A one-way ANOVA
demonstrated that the distributions of ω among the four

Figure 9 An expanded tree of four protein pairs. These maximum likelihood trees include genes from all four R. sphaeroides species (2.4.1,
ATCC 17025, ATCC 17029, and KD131) along with two related genes from species outside of R. sphaeroides (orthologs). These genes in the other
R. sphaeroides strains were also only present in only two copies. The relationships again depict two types of topology - Type A or Type B, where
the left two trees are Type A trees while the right two trees are Type B trees. For the top Type-A tree, the two R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genes are
phaD (RSP_0994) and a hypothetical protein (RSP_3713) while for the bottom Type-A tree the two R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genes are prfA (RSP_2907)
and prfB (RSP_2977). For the top Type-B tree, the two R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genes are cbbF1 (RSP_1285) and fbpB (RSP_3266) while for the bottom
Type-B tree, both genes encode for hypothetical proteins (RSP_3325 and RSP_3719). The trees were rooted to provide a better sense of the tree
topology. The numbers on the branches represent the substitutions per site while the numbers that point to branching points represent the
bootstrap support values for those nodes. The NCBI reference number for the corresponding gene is given to the right of the organism
description for all nodes except those labeled R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, where an RSP number is given for consistency with the rest of the information
provided in the paper. Notice on the Type A trees how the duplicated genes in all R. sphaeroides branch from the orthologs while on the Type B
trees the duplications branch from R. sphaeroides genes and the orthologs form their own branch.

R. sphaeroides strains were not significantly different
from one another (p = 0.920). For the four strains, the
mean ω value varied between 0.131 and 0.137 and the

standard deviation of ω varied between 0.030 and 0.037
(pooled S.D. = 0.033).

For R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, the putative HGT regions were
found both in CI and CII. The non-optimized coordinates for these regions are not shown. The CI HGT
regions sum to 65,005 nucleotides, which spans over 60
genes and which comprises 2.04% of the total CI replicon. The CII HGT regions sum to 110,009 nucleotides,
containing 99 genes, and comprises 11.66% of the total
CII replicon. Of the 60 HT genes in CI, 5 are among
the duplicate gene pairs, while of the 99 HT genes in
CII, 8 are among the duplicate gene pairs. The distribution of HGT regions on both chromosomes revealed
that most of the duplicated genes are outside of these
HGT regions.

Discussion
Extent of gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer
in R. sphaeroides

A systematic genome analysis of the R. sphaeroides,
which possess multiple chromosomes, has shown

Bavishi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:331
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/331

approximately the same level of gene duplication
(~28%) as reported in many other bacterial genomes
that possess only one chromosome [22,42-44] and
eukaryotes [22,45-47]. Thus, similar levels of gene
duplication in the genomes of eubacteria, archeae, and
eukarya suggest that genome size or genome complexity and the levels of gene duplication present in their
genomes are not correlated. Gene duplication can
occur on two different scales: large-scale duplication
(whole-genome duplication, WGD) and smaller-scale
duplications, which consists of tandem duplication of
short DNA sequence within a gene, duplication of the
entire gene or duplication of large genomic segments
[48-50].
The majority of gene duplications in R. sphaeroides
exist in the form of small DNA segments (one or few
genes), but a few duplications span over a large segment of genomic segments. For example, chemotaxisrelated genes are located at four major loci, chemotaxis
operon I (RSP2432-RSP2444), chemotaxis operon II
(RSP1582-RSP1589), chemotaxis operon III (RSP0042RSP0049), and chemotaxis operon IV is a part of a
56 kb- flagella biosynthesis gene cluster (RSP0032RSP0088). Three copies are present on CI and one
copy is present on CII. Although bacteria have
acquired a reasonable proportion of their genetic
diversity through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from
related microorganisms [17], its percentage varies from
1.5% to 14.47% [16]. The results for R. sphaeroides
HGT fell within these ranges but the amount of HGT
in CII was significantly higher proportionally (11.66%)
compared to that in CI (2.04%). Such distinct levels of
HGT for CI and CII may suggest that both chromosomes play different roles in R. sphaeroides. This
observation further confirms that CII has been more
flexible in acquiring genes from other species [51].
However, it must be noted that this method of analyzing HGT may not pick up genes that are horizontally
transferred between species of similar composition. In
addition, although the role of duplicated genes in the
majority of bacterial species still remains unclear, the
role of gene duplication in the resident genome cannot
be underestimated, especially since the majority of
these gene duplications are not located within putative
HGT regions as seen in R. sphaeroides.
Protein divergence and the evolution of different COG
functions in R. sphaeroides

Gene duplications in R. sphaeroides involved in a wide
variety of metabolic functions, and these duplications
revealed a considerable variation in amino acid divergence within each metabolic function category. For
example, protein pairs involved in flagellar assembly
and energy production diverged 60-70%, while protein-

Page 10 of 13

pairs involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism diverged only 10-30%. These conserved gene
homologs may either protect against deleterious
changes in either copy and consequently result in
functional redundancy or may not have been cleared
out simply because they are not harmful to the organism. Two sets of flagellar operons and neu operons
were located on CI, and most homologous protein
pairs had diverged approximately 60-70% of their
amino acid sequences. One complete set of flagellar
genes (RSP0032-RSP0084) is functional as these genes
were expressed in all growth conditions, while the
microarray expression of the incomplete flagellar
operon (RSP1302-RSP1330) was not detected [52], and
therefore the second set of flagellar genes could be
required for surface translocation during biofilm production or in an alternative lifestyle that has not been
identified yet as seen in other organisms [53,54].
Besides the genes for known functions, the genome of
R. sphaeroides contains about 40 duplicate genes
encoding hypothetical proteins. About one-half of the
total hypothetical protein-pairs diverged ~10-20%, and
the other half of the hypothetical protein-pairs
diverged ~50-70%. The analyses further revealed that
genes involved in groups L (DNA synthesis), N (Cell
motility and secretion), U (Intracellular transport),
C (Energy production), G (Carbohydrate metabolism),
and H (Coenzyme metabolism) were overrepresented
among genes evolved by gene duplication, while the
number of genes representing other COGs remained
low or fairly equal percentage-wise to the number of
genes representing those COGs in the overall genome
of R. sphaeroides. Therefore, genes involving transport
and metabolism were selected for by gene duplication.
In addition, the distribution of the gene duplications
(Figure 4) revealed that clusters of gene duplications of
the same COG function exist on both CI and CII and
that most of the gene duplications in a cluster possessed roughly similar levels of sequence conservation.
As such, it may be possible that these highlighted
chromosomal segments are locally selected for, especially as these gene duplications possess similar
functions.
The sequence similarity and evolutionary constraints
of the duplicate gene-pair are indicative of the essential
or nonessential nature of gene function. Previous studies
have revealed shown that the type II topoisomerases
gyrase and topoisomerase IV demonstrated 40 to 60%
amino acid sequence identity, but each protein has a
distinct function essential for cell survival [55,56] highlighting the limitations in bioinformatics approaches. In
a similar note, duplicate protein pairs with very little
amino acid identity can share similar functions. In Bacillus subtilis, the peptide defomylases (Def and YkrB)

Bavishi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:331
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/331

show similarity only across short sequences (motifs) but
both independently carry a deformylase reaction essential for cell viability [57]. Therefore, gene disruption analysis is further required to determine the definitive
function of isologous gene-pairs.
In the specific analysis involving the carbon metabolism genes, it is likely that the cluster in CI containing
cbbA, cbbF, cbbM, cbbP duplicated first and then
cbbG and cbbT duplications arose from CI and were
inserted between the duplicated cbbA and cbbP genes
on CII. In addition, the two genes that code for
hypothetical proteins found between cbbT and cbbG
on CI may have arisen through an additional insertion
or transposition event. Although these duplicated
genes exhibit varying levels of protein divergence,
these protein-pairs are under negative selection as
evidenced by the functional constraints analysis in
Figure 10. Additionally, the identity between the
cbbM genes was low (31%). This is most probably due
to the high degree of difference between cbbM I and
cbbM I I . More specifically, it has been shown that
cbbM, which performs the first critical step in carbon
fixation, has two forms (cbbMI and cbbMII). The form
I enzymes possesses large and small subunits while
the form II enzyme possesses only large subunits that
are different from the form I large subunits [58]. The
distinguishing between CO 2 /O 2 is primarily accomplished by loop 6 of the large subunit, which contains
a conserved element of 11 amino acid residues. Form
II enzymes are primarily anaerobic and unable to
function in aerobic environments whereas form I
enzymes can function in aerobic environments
[59,60]. As form II enzymes are not widely distributed
among different species, it is most likely that form I
enzymes duplicated to make form II enzymes in certain species and then diverged from its original function to operate in aerobic environments [61]. In
contrast, the cbbA genes may actually encode for two
different enzymes (cbbA I and cbbA II ), although there
is high identity between the two genes (79%). cbbA II
genes are usually confined to simple organisms such
as bacteria and fungi while cbbAI is present only some
bacteria such as R. sphaeroides, but is mostly confined
to higher level organisms, including plants and
animals. It could be that these two cbbA genes in
R. sphaeroides are therefore different although they
share high homology as these two enzymes are thought
to have evolved from convergent evolution [62,63].
However, in many instances, there is not markedly
homology between cbbA I and cbbA II [63]. Therefore,
the physiological significance of these duplications,
including those involving cbbA and cbbM, need to be
further studied biochemically and molecularly to better
understand their relationships.

Ancient gene duplications predated the existence of two
chromosomes in R. sphaeroides

Since the overwhelming majority of gene duplication in
the current day R. sphaeroides genome are orthologs
and originated prior to or at the time of lineage formation, these findings also validate previous results that a
large-scale gene duplication event might have occurred
prior to the speciation of R. sphaeroides [28]. and possibly even before the diversification of the a-3 Proteobacteria [52]. The HGT analysis conducted suggests that
the contribution of laterally transferred genes to the
duplicated genes is not very significant. It must also be
noted that with the sequencing of new organisms and
strains, it is possible that new ortholog matches to these
gene duplications could be found. However, even so,
such new sequences could only change Type-B trees to
Type-A trees. Such an understanding aids the mentioned finding that an overwhelming majority of the
gene duplications are Type-A. Another issue that must
be noted is that it is possible that genes in relatively
recent duplications in separate R. sphaeroides strains
could have evolved to look more like functional homologs in other species. However, 61.54% of the 234 R.
sphaeroides 2.4.1 gene pairs were found in at least one
other R. sphaeroides strain. Moreover, the functional
constraints data among the 28 common gene pairs
shows that these pairs are under negative selection and
are therefore strongly conserved in function. It is likely
then that the majority of gene duplications in R. sphaeroides are undergoing negative selection as well.
In addition, the identification of homologous gene
pairs among the other three strains of R. sphaeroides
reveals that although a gene duplication event may have
occurred prior to the formation of R. sphaeroides lineage, significant gene loss or retention has occurred
among all R. sphaeroides strains. The distribution of
matches on R. sphaeroides ATCC 17029 also suggests a
greater amount of gene loss or divergence compared to
that of the other strains and so this strain may have originated earlier from the lineage compared to the others
as it has had more time to undergo selection and deletion processes. However, the genome of R. sphaeroides
ATCC 17029 revealed high nucleotide identity (~95%)
with R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 in regions of common homology [51], so rather it may be that several duplicate gene
pairs have diverged to a level where no protein sequence
similarity can be detected.
Since many gene homologues of R. sphaeroides share
high genetic identity with homologues (orthologs) from
a diverse group of a-Proteobacteria species, a massive
gene duplication event may have had occurred before
the diversification of species in a-Proteobacteria. The
overwhelming presence of Type-A gene duplications on
CI and CII unambiguously demonstrates that both

Bavishi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:331
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/331

chromosomes (CI and CII) were present at the time of
species formation, and therefore these two chromosomes have been essential partners within the R. sphaeroides genome since its formation.

Conclusions
The analyses reveal the abundance of gene duplications
in R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 performing a wide range of functions. Moreover, although majority of gene duplications
have originated prior to speciation of the R. sphaeroides
lineage, there are varying amounts of gene loss or conservation among the four R. sphaeroides strains. The
functional constraints analysis shows that all of the
common duplications among the four R. sphaeroides
strains are under purifying selection suggesting the conservation of the functions of these gene pairs. Finally,
the results suggest that the level of gene duplication in
organisms with complex genome structuring (more than
one chromosome) is not markedly different from that in
organisms with only a single chromosome.
