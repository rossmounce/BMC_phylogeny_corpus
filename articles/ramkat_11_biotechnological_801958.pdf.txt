Biotechnological approaches to determine the
impact of viruses in the energy crop plant
Jatropha curcas

Abstract
Background: Geminiviruses infect a wide range of plant species including Jatropha and cassava both belonging to
family Euphorbiaceae. Cassava is traditionally an important food crop in Sub - Saharan countries, while Jatropha is
considered as valuable biofuel plant with great perspectives in the future.
Results: A total of 127 Jatropha samples from Ethiopia and Kenya and 124 cassava samples from Kenya were
tested by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for RNA viruses and polymerase chain reaction for
geminiviruses. Jatropha samples from 4 different districts in Kenya and Ethiopia (analyzed by ELISA) were negative
for all three RNA viruses tested: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV), Cassava common mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic
virus, Three cassava samples from Busia district (Kenya) contained CBSV. Efforts to develop diagnostic approaches
allowing reliable pathogen detection in Jatropha, involved the amplification and sequencing of the entire DNA A
molecules of 40 Kenyan isolates belonging to African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic
virus - Uganda. This information enabled the design of novel primers to address different questions: a) primers
amplifying longer sequences led to a phylogenetic tree of isolates, allowing some predictions on the evolutionary
aspects of Begomoviruses in Jatrophia; b) primers amplifying shorter sequences represent a reliable diagnostic tool.
This is the first report of the two Begomoviruses in J. curcas. Two cassava samples were co - infected with cassava
mosaic geminivirus and CBSV. A Defective DNA A of ACMV was found for the first time in Jatropha.
Conclusion: Cassava geminiviruses occurring in Jatropha might be spread wider than anticipated. If not taken care
of, this virus infection might negatively impact large scale plantations for biofuel production. Being hosts for similar
pathogens, the planting vicinity of the two crop plants needs to be handled carefully.

Introduction
Geminiviruses are a group of plant viruses that contain
circular single stranded (ss) DNA genomes encapsidated
in small twinned icosahedral capsids [1]. They infect a
wide range of plant species and are responsible for considerable crop losses [2]. Members of this virus family
have been classified into four genera: Begomovirus, Curtovirus, Mastrevirus, and Topocuvirus, depending on
genome organization, host range and type of insect vectors [3]. The genome of cassava mosaic geminivirus
(CMG) belonging to the genus Begomovirus consist of
two components termed DNA A and DNA B each of ~

Austria

2.7 - 3.0 kb [1,4]. The virus DNA A plus strand encodes
the coat protein (CP/AV1) essential for viral transmission by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) [1,5]. There are three
overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) on the complementary strand, of which the replication associated protein (Rep/AC1) is absolutely required for the replication of both genomic components [6,7]. The replication
enhancer protein (REn/AC3) is not essential for infection but enhances viral DNA accumulation [7]. The
transcriptional activator protein (TrAP/AC2) is required
for the transcription - activation of plus strand gene
transcription, and is also involved in suppression of post
- transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [8,9]. The functions of two other DNA A encoded proteins AV2 and
AC4 remains unclear although possible roles in movement (AV2), pathogenicity and PTGS (AC4) have been

demonstrated [9,10]. DNA B encodes the movement
protein (BC1/MP) and a nuclear shuttle protein (BV1/
NSP) required for cell - to - cell and long distance
spread of virus in host plant [1]. Both DNAs contain a
200-250 bp region of high sequence homology known as
the common region which is a part of a large intergenic
region (IR) that contains the origin of replication [4].
Seven species of Begomovirus have been identified so
far in association with cassava mosaic disease (CMD) in
Africa: African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV), East African
cassava mosaic Kenya virus (EACMKV), East African
cassava mosaic Malawi virus (EACMMV), East African
cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus (EACMZV) and South
African cassava mosaic virus (SACMV) [11-14]. The distribution of the viruses has become more complex, since
they invade new geographical regions and host plants
[14,15]. This was attributed to their evolution which was
more rapid than anticipated through mutational
changes, recombination of double stranded (ds) DNA
intermediates and re - assortment of gene components
(pseudo - recombination) [12-17]. In fact, recombination
played a role in the emergence of a new geminivirus
that resulted in severe epidemics almost eliminating cassava (Manihot esculenta) in Uganda and Central Africa
[12,18]. The symptom severity (due to synergism) was
linked to the occurrence of East African cassava mosaic
virus - Uganda (EACMV - UG) arising from recombination of EACMV and ACMV) [12]. Synergism refers to a
situation where one virus affects a co - infecting virus
by allowing its increased accumulation in the host plant
by facilitating its replication, its movement to tissues
that otherwise would not be invaded, resulting in more
severe symptoms than caused by each single infection
[19]. Synergism between EACMV and ACMV is due to
a selective advantage conferred by each partner linked
to post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). In plants,
PTGS operates as an adaptive immune system targeted
against viruses [20]. To counteract this defence system,
viruses have developed suppressor proteins [21]. ACMV
and EACMV - UG possess two PTGS suppressors AC4
and AC2 respectively, with differential roles that target
different steps in RNA silencing in a temporal and spatial manner [8,10,21,22]. Therefore using more than one
type of PTGS suppressor provides an advantage to
viruses synergistically interacting in mixed infections,
leading to more severe symptoms [9,10]. Furthermore,
geminiviruses may be associated with small sub genomic
DNA molecules termed as Defective (Def) DNAs, which
are the result of partial deletion to approximately half
the genome, even disrupting genes [23,24]. They may
also result from sequence duplication, inversion or

Page 2 of 10

rearrangement of viral DNA, and recombination
between DNA A and DNA B components [25].
Additionally, Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD),
caused by Ipomoviruses (family Potyviridae), has been
reported to lead to severe yield losses in cassava plantations in Africa [26-28].
Both host plants under study, cassava and Jatropha,
belong to the family Euphorbiaceae. Jatropha is a
drought resistant shrub native in tropical America, but
is now widely grown in many tropical and subtropical
regions for biodiesel production [29,30]. Based on the
genetic relationship of cassava and Jatropha and the detrimental impact of Begomoviruses in cassava, the question arose, whether Jatropha would be threatened by
comparable epidemics, if planted on larger extensions,
or in spatial neighbourhood. Therefore it was necessary
to develop diagnostic approaches allowing reliable
pathogen detection in Jatropha, which involved the
amplification and sequencing of the entire DNA A
molecules of 40 Kenyan isolates belonging to ACMV
and EACMV - UG. This information enabled the design
of novel primers to address different questions: a) primers amplifying longer sequences led to a phylogenetic
tree of isolates, allowing some predictions on the evolutionary aspects of Begomoviruses in Jatropha; b) primers
amplifying shorter sequences represent a reliable diagnostic tool, given that so far only limited serological
tests are available.

Results
Symptomatology

Jatropha plants growing in the field showed symptoms
ranging from reduced leaf size, malformation and severe
dwarfing of 1 - 3 year old plants. Symptoms on Jatropha
plants growing in the glasshouse were registered after 3
weeks as severe leaf yellowing coupled with browning of
newly formed leaves, leaf malformation, reduced leaf
size, mild to severe chlorotic specks and chlorosis in
some plants. Drying (like burning) and rolling of leaves
from tips was observed on 3 months old cuttings. In
cassava the symptoms observed in plants the field
grown and maintained in the glasshouse were similar:
mosaic, severe reduction and distortion of leaves, and
stunted growth of some plants.
Virus detection by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA)

The Jatropha samples did not contain any of the three
RNA viruses tested: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV),
Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cassava common
mosaic virus (CsCMV) when analyzed by ELISA (see
Additional file 1 Table S1). Also the cassava samples
were negative for CMV and CsCMV. In fact, only three

Ramkat et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:386
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/386

cassava samples from Busia district contained CBSV, as
detected by ELISA (see Additional file 2 Table S2).
Virus detection by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

All Jatropha and cassava samples were tested by PCR
for the presence of geminiviruses. The primer pair JC3F
and JC4R amplified longer sequences of DNA A which
were used the construct a phylogenetic tree. Primer pair
JC6F and JC2R amplified a shorter sequence of 380 bp
from AC1, AC2 and AC3 and distinguished reliably
positive from negative samples.
When symptomatic Jatropha samples from Kenya
were tested with primer pair JC3F and JC4R, 69%
were positive. The primers were able to further detect
virus in 67% of asymptomatic samples. For symptomatic Jatropha samples collected from Ethiopia, 61%
tested positive with the primers JC6F and JC2R (see
Additional file 1 Table S1). With the same primers,
75% of symptomatic samples from Kenya tested positive while 20% of asymptomatic samples were detected
positive.
For cassava, when symptomatic samples were amplified with primer pair JC3F and JC4R, 63% were positive
while all asymptomatic samples tested negative. The

Page 3 of 10

primer pair JC6R and JC2R tested all (100%) symptomatic samples positive while only 6% of asymptomatic
plants were positive (see Additional file 2 Table S2).
Samples testing positive with primer JC6R and JC2R
yielded bands with different intensity on gel electrophoresis, which were classified as weak positive (+), moderate
positive (++) and strong positive (+++) (see Additional
file 1 Table S1 and Additional file 2 Table S2). Only 2
cassava samples were co - infected with CBSV and
CMG (see Additional file 2 Table S2).
Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)

All Jatropha samples tested negative for CMV and
CBSV. The cassava samples were negative for CMV and
only one sample tested positive for CBSV.
Sequences and phylogenetic analysis of DNA A

Complete nucleotide sequences of forty DNA A components typical of Begomoviruses in the Kenyan samples
were determined, of which 34 sequences were from Jatropha and 6 from cassava (see Additional file 3 Table S3).

obtained from Jatropha and cassava in this study
and other Begomoviruses associated with the two host
plants publicly available in the Genbank (Table 1)
[12-14,16,17,31-40]. Phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated
that they belong to CMG involved in CMD as they had
close identities with sequences already deposited in public
databases. All viruses characterised in this study could be
grouped with two previously identified Begomoviruses
found in cassava in Western Kenya, namely EACMV - UG
and ACMV, but not with the species EACMKV [GenBank:
NC011583.1], EACMZV [GenBank: NC004655.1] and
strain EACMV - KE [GenBank: AJ717552.1], which were
found in Kenya previously [14]. The viruses also did not
group with EACMV - TZ [GenBank: AY795987.1],
EACMCV - TZ [GenBank: AY795983.1], EACMCV - CM
[GenBank: NC004625.1], EACMMV [GenBank:
AJ006459.1], SACMV [GenBank: NC003803.1], ICMV IN [GenBank: NC001932.1], ICMV - ker [GenBank:
AJ575819.1], SLCMV - IN [GenBank: AJ890224.1] and
SLCMV - LK [GenBank: AJ314737.1] found elsewhere in
Africa and Asia [12,13,36-38]. No close relationship was
shown between the viruses and Jatropha begomoviruses
from Asia and South America; JCMV [GenBank:
GQ924760.1], CYVMV [GenBank: EU727086.2], JYMIV
[GenBank: NC011309.1] and JLCV [GenBank:
NC011268.1].
The first group of viruses comprises ACMV, showing
nucleotide (nt) identity from 95% (isolate JN053426) to
97.3% (isolates JN053431 and JN053430) with the
ACMV reference sequence [GenBank: NC001467.1]
(see Additional file 3 Table S3). The second group are
closely related to, but distinct from the strains
EACMV - KE and EACMV - TZ. The sequences
showed approximately 90.7% nt identity (JN053450) to
92.3% nt identity (JN053440 and JN053444) with the
EACMV - KE [GenBank: AJ717552.1] and only 90% nt
identity (JN053451, JN053441, JN053452 and
JN053453) to 90.5% nt identity (JN053433, JN053440,
JN053442, JN053444 and JN053446) with EACMV TZ [GenBank: A1795987.1]. To indicate that they are
clearly isolates of the strain EACMV - UG, they had
high nt identity ranging from approximately 94.1%
(isolate JN053439) to 98.7% (isolates JN053440,
JN053442 and JN05344) with the EACMV - UG [GenBank: NC004674.1] reference sequence (see Additional
file 3 Table S3).
The viruses infecting Jatropha in Western Kenya
occur on overlapping territories, since ACMV and
EACMV - UG were both found in all the districts analysed (see Additional file 3 Table S3). EACMV - UG
occurred with a higher prevalence than ACMV. Generally speaking, out of 34 viral sequences found in Jatropha 24 (71%) were EACMV - UG, while 10 (27%) were
ACMV. In Busia, a district neighbouring Uganda,

Page 4 of 10

EACMV - UG was most prevalent with 15/24 (62.5%)
compared to 7/24 (29%) and only 2/24 (8%) from Kakamega and Siaya respectively. ACMV was found more
frequently with 6/10 (60%) on samples from Kakamega
district, compared to 2/10 (20%) from Siaya and Busia
respectively.
ACMV Def DNA A

A Def DNA A was present in a Jatropha leaf samples
collected from Western Kenya. PCR analyses with primer JC3F and JC4R of sample K1J5 amplified the
expected 2.8 kb of a near full length DNA A component
of the Begomovirus sequence and an additional shorter
fragment (Figure 2). Sequencing of the smaller fragment
revealed a size of 1420 bp, which was named Def K1J5.
This Def (Genbank JN101951) showed 96.6% nt identity
with the ACMV reference sequence [GenBank
NC001467.1] and a low nt similarity (69.7%) with the
EACMV - UG reference sequence [Genbank
NC004674.1] (see Additional file 3 Table S3). The complete sequences of DNA A components of ACMV reference sequence [GenBank NC001467.1] was used for size
comparison with the ORFs of Def K1J5. On the virion
sense strand, AV1 and AV2 were entirely missing. In
the complementary sense strand, AC4 was the only
intact gene at 422 bp while AC1 was 1070 bp long. Two
ORFs, AC2 and AC3, which are found in DNA A of
CMGs, had a size of 326 bp and 178 bp respectively
(Figure 3). The IR contained the first 11 bp of the replication site of geminiviruses.

Discussion
Cultivated cassava is believed to be the principle reservoir for CMD associated begomoviruses because of its
perennial growth and scale of production. However,
alternative hosts have been identified, including Manihot
glaziovii Müll, a wild relative of cassava native to Brazil
[35], Senna occidentalis, Leucana leucocephala, Combretum confertum, Centrosema pubescens and Pueraria
javanica [31,32]. A strain of Cassava latent geminivirus
(CLV - V) was previously isolated from naturally
infected Jatropha multifida growing in the Coastal districts of Kenya [41]. First reports on geminivirus infections on J. curcas indicated the occurrence of Jatropha
curcas virus closely related to Cassava mosaic virus in
India, reaching a disease incidence from 25 to 47%
[30,42,43]. Phylogenetic analyses of the virus genome
showed that Jatropha curcas mosaic disease (JCMD) is
caused by Jatropha curcas virus, a new strain of Indian
cassava mosaic virus (ICMV) [30]. Jatropha is further
host of CMV (family Bromoviridae Cucumovirus) [44].
In this study, we report for the first time the detection
of Begomovirus: ACMV and EACMV - UG in Jatropha.
Furthermore, a defective molecule derived from DNA A

of the bipartite Begomovirus ACMV was detected in J.
curcas. Also the presence of a co - infection with CMG
and CBSV was found in cassava plants.
The phylogenetic tree of the complete DNA A
sequences indicates that the ACMV and EACMV - UG
isolates were closely related to those isolated previously
in Western Kenya [14,33]. From an evolutionary perspective, it is an indication that the geminiviruses infecting Jatropha from the sampled areas are as a result of
spread of viruses from an inoculum source occurring
where the plants are growing. This is further supported
by the idea that the EACMKV, EACMV - KE and
EACMZV previously identified [14] from Eastern and

Coastal parts of Kenya were not found to be present in
Jatropha, since the viruses have a distinct geographical
distribution [14]. Geminivirus dissemination occurs
through cuttings or whiteflies. The viruses identified in
this study were not closely related with those infecting
cassava and Jatropha in other parts of Africa, Asia and
South America suggests that there has been no movement of infected Jatropha cuttings and viruliferous
whiteflies from other areas to Western Kenya. In fact,
recombination results in severe epidemiological consequences such as the emergence of isolates with
increased virulence capable of overcoming host resistance or with a host range wider than the original one

[45]. Recombination and synergism that have long
occurred in cassava [12-18] could have led to the current spread of the virus in the field to infect Jatropha
plants. The recombinant EACMV - UG was the most
prevalent strain virus found whilst the other strains of
EACMV were not identified. In line with this are previous claims, that EACMV in Western Kenya has been
largely displaced by EACMV - UG, which is considered
a more virulent strain [14]. In the current study the presence of EACMV - UG and ACMV on different Jatropha plants in the same field indicates the opportunity
for mixed infections. For example plants K4J1 (EACMV
- UG isolate JN053453) and K4J2 (ACMV isolate
JN053425) (Figure 1) stand close to each other in the
same field, hence offering good opportunities for more
recombination to occur. EACMV - UG and ACMV are
associated with severe synergistic epidemics on cassava
that swept through Uganda and continues to affect surrounding countries including Kenya [14,12,18,46]. Specifically the two viruses have differentially acting
suppressors of PTGS overcoming the hosts defence
mechanisms [8-10,20-22]. ACMV (recovery - type) has a
strong AC4 suppressor and EACMV - UG (non - recovery - type) has a strong AC2 suppressor causing

unusually severe symptoms. As a result, ACMV will
leave only EACMV - UG to be spread and become the
predominant virus in the area [9,21,47]. In the absence
of a synergistic interaction, only one virus in a co infected plant will become predominant and persist
[9,10,14]. Synergism may lead to a 10 - 50 fold increase
in viral DNA accumulation which substantially increases
the potential for a higher efficiency of vector transmission to even infect non cassava host plants [18,31] This
might further explain, why the EACMV - UG appears as
predominant virus in Jatropha. Co - infection of CMG
and CBSV threatens cassava production in Busia distict
of Kenya. Recent studies have shown how evolution is
shaping the populations of CBSV and Uganda cassava
brown streak virus (UCBSV) in cassava causing significant problems [26-28]. Mixed infection results in
increase in the titer of one or both viruses and elicits
disease symptoms that are more sever than the sum of
those induced in single infection [10,19].
In addition to genomic components, smaller sized Def
DNA often occurs naturally in geminivirus infected
plants [25]. The plant, from which the defective DNA
molecule was isolated in the current study, did not display particular symptoms differing from the neighbouring plants growing in the same field, meaning that it
could not have been picked up on purpose due to a previous selective decision. The Def DNA molecule found
in the plant K1J5 had lost the entire AV1 and AV2
genes and large portions of other genes. Sub genomic
Def DNA molecules associated with a number of Begomovirus seem to be fairly uniform in structure and
retain their IR and a large portion of AC1 [23], as
observed also in this study. These deletions might affect
the replication of the molecule and it might depend
entirely on its helper virus for replication. Geminivirus
Def DNA invariably rely on the respective viruses for
replication as observed for Tomato leaf curl virus that
lacked an ORF required for replication and encapsidation and were not expected to be capable of autonomous replication, however they were replicating in the
presence of the viral DNA [48]. In cassava, Def DNA
has been previously reported occurring in DNA A of
EACMV and DNA B of ACMV, and were found to be
associated with a delay in symptom development and
amelioration [23,24]. However, no naturally occurring
Def DNA A of ACMV has been found previously in
Jatropha curcas and we report it for the first time. The
role of this small Def DNA molecule in the biology of
ACMV in Jatropha in nature is still unclear.

Conclusion
We have shown for the first time cassava Begomoviruses
and their associated sub - genomic Def DNA molecules
to be naturally occurring in field growing Jatropha

plants. The occurrence of the Begomoviruses further
poses a challenge in the elimination strategy of CMG in
field grown cassava as a result of increase in inoculum
from different hosts, and calls for an elimination strategy of the viruses in J. curcas in order to save the crop
which is an important biofuel and pharmaceutical crop.
Molecular detection techniques showed the presence of
geminivirus even in asymptomatic plants. The new natural host (J. curcas) of the two viruses opens new avenues for further recombination of the viruses to occur
which indeed becomes a threat both to cassava an
important food crop to Sub Saharan countries and
Jatropha. There is a possibility of Cassava mosaic virus
in Jatropha being more widespread than anticipated,
since we have detected it also in Jatropha samples from
Ethiopia. This has led to hypothesize that other neighboring countries growing Jatropha could be facing similar challenges with this plant. The primer pair JC6F and
JC2R amplifying a sequence of 380 bp allows the detection of Begomoviruses in symptomatic and asymptomatic cassava and Jatropha plants and can therefore be
recommended for a large scale screening of field

Figure 4 Map of Kenya showing the sites of cassava and
Jatropha plant material sampling (black triangles). A survey was
conducted in Western Kenya and Rift valley where the two plants
are being grown together.

Sample collection

A total of 127 Jatropha samples from Ethiopia and
Kenya and 124 cassava samples from Kenya were used
in this study. The Kenyan samples were collected during
a survey conducted in September 2009 and November
2010 covering four districts: Kakamega, Siaya, Busia
(Western region) and Nakuru (Rift valley region) growing Jatropha and cassava together (Figure 4). Ten plants
of Jatropha and cassava showing typical virus symptoms
and ten symptomless plants were sampled from five
fields in each district. Young leaves were picked from
the plants and placed in sample collection tubes over
silica gel for further detection of viruses. Two cuttings
of approximately 30 cm long were also taken from 5
symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic plants and planted in
glasshouse for future use.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

Double Antibody Sandwich ELISA (DAS - ELISA) was
performed on all Jatropha and cassava plant accessions
to detect the presence of RNA viruses such as: CMV
and CsCMV using commercially available kits (DSMZ
GmbH, Germany and AC Diagnostics). Triple - Antibody Sandwich - ELISA (TAS - ELISA) was performed
to determine the presence of CBSV (DSMZ GmbH,
Germany). An ELISA sample was taken as positive,
when its OD value was at least three times higher than
the negative control. All determinations were run in
duplicate.

DNA extraction and rolling cycle amplification (RCA)

Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaves using the
DNeasy plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany)
according to the supplier’s instructions. RCA was performed using the TempliPhiTM Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier’s instructions.
Polymerase chain reaction

Six different primers were designed (Table 2) based on
multiple alignments of full length DNA A sequence of
geminivirus from Jatropha and cassava available in the
NCBI Genbank to amplify the variable regions to yield
longer (2800 bp) and shorter sequences (380 - 1085 bp)
(Table 3). PCR was conducted in a total volume of 25 μl

using 2.5 μl 10× PCR buffer (QIAGEN), 1 μl MgCl2 (25
mM), 0.5 μl of each primer (10 pmol), 0.5 μl dNTP, 0.15
μl HotStarTaq Polymerase (QIAGEN HotStar Plus TM
PCR), 1 μl of total genomic DNA or RCA (1:30) product.
Total genomic DNA was used with all the primer sets
that amplify shorter sequences while the RCA was used
for primer sets that amplify longer sequences (Table 3).
For RCA to amplifying longer sequences, the PCR cycling
conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95°
C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min
annealing temperature (Table 3) and 2 min at 72°C. A
final step of 10 min at 72°C ended the cycle. For primers
pairs amplifying shorter sequences, the difference in PCR
conditions was in 30 cycles of 40 s at 94°C and 40 sec
annealing temperature (Table 3). The PCR products were
analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. A subsequent purification of full length PCR products was done
using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN).
Extraction of RNA and RT-PCR

RT-PCR was performed to detect CBSV and CMV in
Jatropha and cassava. Total RNA was extracted from
100 mg of Jatropha and cassava leaves using Spectrum
™ plant total RNA kit (SIGMA - ALDRICH) according
to the supplier’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized
from 3 μg of genomic RNA using SuperScript II
™reverse transcriptase primed with oligo(dT)12-18 (Invitrogen). The CBSV specific primers CBSV 10F: 5’ATCAGAATAGTGACTGCTGG 3’ and CBSV 11R: 5’
CCACATTATTATCGTCACCAGG 3’ [49] amplifying
230 bp were used for PCR amplification of the cDNA
template. The reaction mix and PCR cycling conditions
were as performed previous [49]. For CMV detection,
Cucumoviruses universal primers CPTALL - 3: 5’
GACTGACCATTTTAGCCG 3’ and CPTALL - 5: 5’
YASYTTTDRGGTTCAATTCC 3’ [50] amplifying 940
bp were used for PCR with the reaction mixture and
cycling conditions as described previously [50].
Sequence analyses

Multiple sequence alignments of geminivirus full
length DNA A sequences was carried out using the
Clustal program (MegAlign, DNAStar). A phylogenetic

Part of genome amplified by PCR and RCA

tree was constructed from multiple alignments by performing a heuristic search. Multiple alignments were
analyzed by maximum parsimony with full-length
DNA A using Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony
(PAUP) and a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates
was performed.
