Abstract
Background: The zebrafish is recognized as a versatile cancer and drug screening model. However, it is not known
whether the estrogen-responsive genes and signaling pathways that are involved in estrogen-dependent
carcinogenesis and human cancer are operating in zebrafish. In order to determine the potential of zebrafish
model for estrogen-related cancer research, we investigated the molecular conservation of estrogen responses
operating in both zebrafish and human cancer cell lines.
Methods: Microarray experiment was performed on zebrafish exposed to estrogen (17b-estradiol; a classified
carcinogen) and an anti-estrogen (ICI 182,780). Zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes sensitive to both estrogen and
anti-estrogen were identified and validated using real-time PCR. Human homolog mapping and knowledge-based
data mining were performed on zebrafish estrogen responsive genes followed by estrogen receptor binding site
analysis and comparative transcriptome analysis with estrogen-responsive human cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D and
Ishikawa).
Results: Our transcriptome analysis captured multiple estrogen-responsive genes and signaling pathways that
increased cell proliferation, promoted DNA damage and genome instability, and decreased tumor suppressing
effects, suggesting a common mechanism for estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. Comparative analysis revealed a
core set of conserved estrogen-responsive genes that demonstrate enrichment of estrogen receptor binding sites
and cell cycle signaling pathways. Knowledge-based and network analysis led us to propose that the mechanism
involving estrogen-activated estrogen receptor mediated down-regulation of human homolog HES1 followed by
up-regulation cell cycle-related genes (human homologs E2F4, CDK2, CCNA, CCNB, CCNE), is highly conserved, and
this mechanism may involve novel crosstalk with basal AHR. We also identified mitotic roles of polo-like kinase as a
conserved signaling pathway with multiple entry points for estrogen regulation.
Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the use of zebrafish for characterizing estrogen-like environmental
carcinogens and anti-estrogen drug screening. From an evolutionary perspective, our findings suggest that
estrogen regulation of cell cycle is perhaps one of the earliest forms of steroidal-receptor controlled cellular
processes. Our study provides first evidence of molecular conservation of estrogen-responsiveness between
zebrafish and human cancer cell lines, hence demonstrating the potential of zebrafish for estrogen-related cancer
research.

Background
Estrogen is known to be carcinogenic and there are several mechanisms postulated for its carcinogenic and
tumor-promoting effects. One of the most widely
acknowledged mechanism of estrogen carcinogenicity is
the multiple estrogen-receptor signal-transduction pathways associated with increased cell proliferation and
inhibition of apoptosis [1-3]. This could involve the
direct genomic action of estrogen binding to nuclear
estrogen receptors (ERa and/or ERb), which then bind
as dimers to estrogen-response elements (ERE) in the
regulatory regions of estrogen-responsive genes in association with various basal transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors to alter expression of genes
involving in cell cycle control [1] and other tumor-promoting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor [4]. Moreover, via non-genomic action, estrogen can
also cause activation of protein kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, and rapidly increases the
levels of secondary messengers, such as cyclic AMP that
can cross-talk with other growth factors (epidermal
growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor) and signaling pathways, that are important in
estrogen-dependent cell cycle regulation [2,3]. Another
potential mechanism is via estrogen metabolism
whereby oxidative metabolites of estrogen are shown to
have genotoxic (formation of DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage), mutagenic, transforming, and carcinogenic effects [5,6]. In addition, estrogen has been
shown to cause over-expression of centrosome kinases
(Aurora A and B) and centrosome amplification which
can lead to chromosomal instability resulting in aneuploidy in early tumor foci that precipitates oncogenesis
[7]. These evidences along with cancer epidemiological
data of reproductive tissues had supported the classification of estrogen as a carcinogen.
The zebrafish is emerging as a cancer model that
offers the high-throughput advantage of an in vitro
model as well as the whole-animal physiology environment of an in vivo model [8]. The potential of zebrafish
as a cancer model is derived from its strength as an
experimental system for developmental biology and toxicology. Being a vertebrate, many of the developmental
and physiological processes are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, from the anatomical level to the
molecular level. Although zebrafish do not have certain
organ-tissues or glands (e.g. mammary and prostate)
found in mammals, similar molecules and signaling
pathways involved in carcinogenesis may still be

operating in human neoplasms. Hence, zebrafish is
known to be susceptible to carcinogens affecting
humans and develop a wide spectrum of cancers resembling human malignancies [8,9]. Moreover, the high
amenability of zebrafish to various molecular techniques
and genetic manipulation, coupled with a vast genome
resources including a near complete genome sequence
and gene expression platforms (e.g. microarray and
RNA sequencing) has empowered zebrafish with versatility for various cancer research [10-12]. From inducing
tumors driven by oncogenes in specific tissues and
fluorescent imaging of tumorigenesis in living transgenic
zebrafish to screening of chemical and genetic modifiers
of cancer, the zebrafish model can be used for addressing basic tumor biology and high-throughput drug
screening applications. The zebrafish has also been
employed for toxicological characterization of environmental carcinogens and endocrine disruptors that could
pose public health-risks [13,14].
As part of our research endeavor to explore the potential of using zebrafish for modeling estrogen-related cancer research (such as estrogen-induced carcinogenesis,
estrogen-responsive cancer model and for screening of
estrogen receptor modulators), we performed microarray
experiments on zebrafish exposed to estrogen 17b-estradiol (E2) and, a combination of E2 and anti-estrogen ICI
182,780 (E2+ICI). Although zebrafish is known to be
responsive to estrogen and contain estrogen receptors
similar to human ERa and ERb and their developmental
expression patterns had been characterized [15-17], it has
not been demonstrated whether the estrogen-responsiveness in terms of genes and signaling pathways are similar
to those operating in estrogen-responsive human cancer
cells. In this study, we first identified estrogen-responsive
genes in zebrafish that were sensitive to both estrogen
and anti-estrogen. By human homology mapping and
knowledge-based data mining, we found that many of the
genes were associated with cell cycle, DNA replication,
DNA damage and repair and cancer. By comparing with
estrogen-responsive human cancer cell lines, we identified a core set of conserved estrogen-responsive genes
that have significant enrichment of ER binding sites as
well as cell cycle signaling pathways. Further, network
analysis reveals mechanistic insights into a conserved
estrogen-mediated cell cycle regulation and signalling
pathway. This study provides the first molecular evidence
of conserved estrogen-responsiveness between zebrafish
and human cancer cell lines, further demonstrating zebrafish’s potential for estrogen-related cancer research.

Methods
Experimental design

Experimental procedures were performed within the
guidelines of National University of Singapore’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A batch of
healthy adult males were exposed to the medium containing 17b-estradiol (E2; Sigma-Aldrich; 10 nM final concentration) and an equal number of males were exposed to
the medium containing a combination of E2 (10 nM) and
ICI 182,780 (Tocris Cookson) (1 μM final concentration).
Control fishes (males) were maintained in water containing 0.01% (v/v) ethanol (ethanol control; ethanol was used
to dissolve E2 and ICI). The final ethanol concentration in
the control was similar to those in medium with E2 or E2
+ICI. Four replicates were maintained for each treatment.
Control and experimental animals were maintained in
their respective medium for 96 hours and the medium
was changed every day during the course of the experiment. Upon completion of the experiment at 96 hours,
the fish were snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C for subsequent analysis.
Experimental samples and RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from individual frozen fish
belonging to control and experimental samples (ethanol
control, E2 and E2+ICI treated). Frozen samples were
homogenized to a crude powder form in a pre-cooled
mortar and pestle. During the grinding, the sample was
kept in frozen condition by adding liquid nitrogen to
the sample in the mortar. Partially homogenized sample
was transferred to a pre-cooled sterile graduated falcon
tube containing appropriate amount of Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA) and homogenized completely using a
motorized homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted from
the samples using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently RNA was purified
using Qiagen column and the quality was evaluated
using gel electrophoresis. Reference RNA was prepared
from equal amount of male and female total RNAs
extracted from pooled liver from male and female fish,
respectively. Sufficient amounts of reference RNA
required for the entire project was prepared at one time
and stored as 100 μl aliquots at -80°C.
Zebrafish microarray and data processing

Compugen microarray set (Compugen, USA) containing
16,416 oligonucleotide probes representing zebrafish
genes was used in this study. Briefly, the oligonucleotide
probes were spotted onto poly-L-lysine coated microscope slides using a custom-built DNA microarrayer
and post-processed following the standard procedures
previously described [18]. Sample and reference RNA
were reverse transcribed in the presence of Cy3-dUTP
and Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Inc.), respectively, to

Page 3 of 15

fluorescently label the target cDNAs. The arrays were
hybridized following the strategies described in [52]. A
minimum of three good hybridizations were selected for
the analysis. The signal intensities of Cy5 and Cy3 dyes
in each spot and the local background were measured
using the GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon
Instruments, USA) to calculate the net intensity of each
spot for analysis. Microarray data from GenePix image
analysis software (i.e gpr files) were subjected to Lowess
normalization. There were 4 control (ethanol controls)
samples, 3 samples treated with E2 and 3 samples treated with E2+ICI in the normalized data, respectively.
The good arrays were selected based on scatter plot
analysis.
Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used
to identify the prominent signals for the two kinds of
treatments as previously described [19]. To boost the
power of the test, we applied 3-class SAM on the whole
array by excluding spots with more than 6 missing values.
As a result, 1610 out of 16416 genes were selected at qvalue < 8%. Subsequently, estrogen-responsive genes
were identified by analyzing the expression values for the
samples treated with E2 and E2+ICI with respect to control samples using 2-class SAM. The genes selected following this analysis displayed between 2- to 130-fold
differential expressions. A cluster of 715 up-regulated
genes were identified which showed significant up-regulation in E2. These genes displayed decreased expression
both in the Control and E2+ICI compared to their level
of expression in E2. Similarly, another cluster of 376
genes (down-regulated group) were identified which displayed significantly reduced expression in E2 compared
to control and E2+ICI. Hence, the genes selected by the
above analysis are estrogen-responsive and are sensitive
to both E2 and ICI. Datasets extracted using the above
statistical analysis were clustered and visualized as previously described [19]. The array data has been submitted
to Gene Expression Omnibus database and the accession
number is GSE27707.
Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

Transcription dynamics observed in the microarray
experiments was validated using quantitative real time
PCR (qRT-PCR) for a selected subset of up and downregulated genes. The GeneBank Accession and primers
used for qRT-PCR are given in the Additional File 1.
Gene specific primers were designed using Primer
Express software (version 3.0; Applied Biosystems). The
strategy was to select two exons with a large intronic
junction, and then the primer was designed across the
junction to ensure the amplification is from the cDNA
and not from genomic DNA. Total RNA extracted from
the experimental samples were treated with RNAse free
DNAse (Ambion, Austin, USA) to eliminate the

Lam et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:41

contamination of genomic DNA and about 1ug of RNA
was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (using random primers;
Applied Biosystems). ABI system 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR machine with 384 well formats was used for
the analysis. Fluorescent nucleic acid dye SYBR green I
(Applied Biosystems) was used for detection. Samples
were tested in quadruplicates. The reaction mix without
template served as negative control and beta actin
served as positive control. The results were analyzed
using Sequence Detection Software (version 2.3) and
SDS-RQ manager (version 1.2; Applied Biosystems).
Mapping of zebrafish estrogen responsive genes to
human homologues

Most of the functional group and pathways enrichment
analysis software use human UniGene Ids as one of the
input source data. For comparative purpose between
zebrafish and human cancer cell lines, we had to identify
human homolog for the zebrafish estrogen-responsive
genes. The zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes with
GenBank accession numbers were clustered into UniGenes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/ and these
UniGenes were mapped to the HomoloGene database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?
CMD=search&DB=homologene; Human UniGene build
200; HomoloGene Build 56) to obtain their human
homologs. We have created a web-based tool http://
123.136.65.67/ to map the zebrafish UniGene Ids to
human HomoloGene [10]. This facilitate large-scale
mapping of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes to the
corresponding human homologs.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)

Pathways are graphical representations of molecular
relationships between selected set of biological entities
derived from diverse sources of established information.
It is usually made up of nodes and edges where nodes
represent biological entities (e.g. genes, proteins, complexes) and edges represent interactions (e.g. induction,
inhibition, binding, regulation, phosphorylation etc)
between nodes in the pathway. It presents an illustration
of a ‘focused’ view of a biological function or a ‘global’
view of complex networks that are enriched in large
scale microarray data sets. Functional properties and
pathway enrichment of the estrogen-responsive genes of
zebrafish were generated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA; Version 6) (Ingenuity® Systems, http://www.
ingenuity.com). Information in this large database were
obtained through manual curation peer-reviewed literature and continually updated with information such as
modeled relationships between biological entities (genes,
proteins, cells, tissues, etc.), canonical pathways and
functional categories ("molecular and cellular functions”,

Page 4 of 15

“disease and disorders” and “physiological system development and functions”). IPA will associate genes from
the input dataset for different functional categories and
calculate a p-value using the right-tailed Fisher’s exact
test to assess the statistical significance of the enriched
genes for a functional category in relation to the initial
input dataset and the total number of genes in the database involved in the function. A p-value < 0.05 indicates
statistical significance or non-random association.
Estrogen responsive element (ERE) and estrogen receptor
(ER) binding site analysis

Human homolog of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes
(475 genes) were intersected with estrogen-responsive
genes from 4 estrogen-responsive human cancer cell lines
[T47D cells [20], MCF7 cells [21] and, MCF7 and Ishikawa
cells (Thomsen et al. unpublished data); Additional Files 2,
3, 4, 5]. The human cell line datasets contained the following number of estrogen-responsive genes and were represented by UniGene identifiers: MCF7-1485 genes, T47D975 genes, Ishikawa-1643 genes and MCF7-1531 genes.
The randomization was done using all the human homolog of zebrafish (8056 human UniGene identifiers) generated by mapping all the zebrafish genes in the microarray
to HomoloGene database as described earlier. The mapping location of each of the 139 conserved estrogenresponsive genes were retrieved using the University of
California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu; May 2004 assembly from the database
‘KnownGene and all_mrna’). Of the 139 genes, 133 were
could be mapped using the UCSC genome browser. We
scanned for scanning ERE motif along 20 kb sequences
from the upstream of 5’, downstream of 3’ and within the
gene of the estrogen-responsive genes of zebrafish and
scanned for the motif. We also scanned for the ERE motif
in the whole genome of zebrafish and analyzed the possible enrichment of ERE motif in the estrogen-responsive
genes compared to the whole genome distribution of the
motif. In addition, the genes were then scanned for ERbinding site in the neighbourhood (100kbp range) using a
combined list of ER-binding sites. The combined list was
derived from All-ER binding data for MCF7 cell [21,22],
Fun et al 2010 in preparation]. The Binomial test were
used to determine the statistical significance of the intersection between datasets as well as the ERE motif and ERbinding site analyses. A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical
significance.

Results and Discussion
Identification of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes via
whole-organism transcriptome profiling and qRT-PCR
validation

Estrogen-responsive genes were determined by comparing
whole transcriptome profiles of male zebrafish treated with

vehicle (control group), E2 and E2+ICI using SAM analysis
(Significant Analysis of Microarrays; see [19]). We anticipated that estrogen-responsive genes would be deregulated
in response to E2 treatment and the level of deregulation
would be partially suppressed or normalized when the
anti-estrogen drug ICI is included in the E2 treatment
since ICI is known to bind estrogen receptor monomers
and prevent dimerization, hence blocking estrogen receptor
signalling to targeted genes [23]. Indeed, SAM analysis of
zebrafish whole-organism transcriptome profiles identified
a total of 1092 estrogen-responsive genes (715 up-regulated
and 377 down-regulated) following E2 treatment which
were also partially suppressed or normalized in E2+ICI
treatment (Figure 1A; Additional File 6 and 7). A closer
examination of the transcriptome profiles (Figure 1B and
1C) revealed changes of transcript abundance from about
2-fold to 128-fold following E2 treatment. In a subset of
responsive genes, E2+ICI treatment almost completely suppressed or normalized the estrogen-induced transcriptional

+ICI treatment partially suppressed the E2 induced transcriptional changes (Figure 1C). These observations indicate that our microarray experiment successfully captured
genes responding (to varying levels) specifically to estrogen
and the anti-estrogen treatment.
To validate the reliability of the microarray data, we performed qRT-PCR on vitellogenins (vtg1, vtg3) and zebrafish homolog of estrogen receptor alpha (esr1), which are
well known biomarker genes responsive to estrogen
[24,25]. Expression of vtg1 and vtg3 was induced almost
400-fold and 200-fold, respectively, following E2 treatment
when compared to the control group but was only
induced to approximately 80-fold in E2+ICI treatment
(Figure. 2A).This indicate that E2-induced vtg expression
was suppressed approximately 2.5 to 5 fold by the addition
of ICI [fold-change above reference RNA (Log2ratio)]. As
for esr1, E2 treatment increased the level of expression by
about 4-fold and the inclusion of ICI suppressed the

Human homolog mapping and identification of putative
novel estrogen-responsive genes in zebrafish

Genes identified in this study were first categorized
based on their original annotations such as functionally
known genes, different groups of Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs) and ZGC clones (NIH Zebrafish Gene Collection, full-length sequenced clones without any known
function). Of the 1092 zebrafish estrogen-responsive
genes, about 31.5% were fully annotated while the rest
were ESTs (49%) or ZGC (19.5%) clones (Additional File
8). The estrogen-responsive genes were further mapped
to NCBI HomoloGene database (HomoloGene build 56
and Human UniGene build 200) and 475 (43.5%) of the
estrogen-responsive genes have corresponding human
homologs (Additional File 9). A subset of zebrafish fulllength sequenced genes (ZGC clones) with no functional
annotation that are sensitive to E2 and antiestrogen
(Additional File 10) were also identified for the first
time. A search in the NCBI UniGene database linked to
the GenBank IDs of these ZGC clones indicated that
many have ESTs that are expressed in the zebrafish
reproductive system (based on tissue specific ESTs) and
some of these clones have moderate homology to
human proteins. Hence, we have identified a number of
putative novel estrogen-responsive genes in zebrafish; of
these, some may have human homolog while the
remainder appear to be fish specific. Characterization of
some of the new target genes might provide additional
insights into both general and species-specific ER regulated gene expression.
Identification of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes
associated with carcinogenesis or cancer

To obtain biological insights into the zebrafish estrogenresponsive genes, we analyzed the human homologs of
zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes using knowledgebased pathway data mining and network generator algorithm [Ingenuity Pathways Analysis; IPA]. Of the 475
human homologs of E2 responsive genes identified in
zebrafish, 325 were eligible for network analysis while
289 were eligible for function/pathway analysis. Genes
that were not eligible for network/function/pathway analysis were genes with no reported involvement, hence
not assigned, in any known molecular function/pathway
in the database. The algorithm calculates the significance of an association (p-value < 0.05 indicate non-random association) using the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test
based on the number of genes from the 289 human
homologs that are associated in a given molecular function/pathway, relative to the total number of genes
found in the molecular function/pathway in IPA. The
analysis revealed that the top five significant molecular
functions were: i) Cell Cycle, ii) DNA Replication,
Recombination, and Repair, iii) Cell Death, iv) Cellular

Page 7 of 15

Growth and Proliferation, and v) Cellular Movement,
and they involved 20-45% of the 289 homologs (p-value
= 4.21E-13 to 2.58E-02; Figure 3A andAdditional File
11). Given the strong association with cell cycle processes, it is not surprising that the analysis also revealed
that approximately 42% of the homologs were significantly (p-value = 1.13E-8 to 2.32E-02; Additional File
12) associated with cancer ranging from tumorigenesis,
neoplasia, to various cancer types including those of the
reproductive system (uterine, endometrial, breast, ovarian and prostate).
Next, to discover and visualize the biological connectivity of the estrogen-responsive genes, the IPA network
generating algorithm is used to maximize the interconnectedness of the genes based on all known connectivity
in the database. The algorithm also incorporates other
genes from the database to maximize the connectivity
with the estrogen-responsive genes to assemble a ‘focus
gene network’ and it handles a maximum of 35 focus
genes per network. A network score is generated based
on the hypergeometric distribution and is calculated
with the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test. The top 5 scoring networks were assembled de novo using 22-29 focus
genes with associated functions ranging from cell cycle,
cancer, DNA replication, recombination and repair to
gene expression, dermatological diseases, and reproductive system development and function (Additional File
13). Interestingly, the top most significant (p-value =
1.00E-46) gene network was assembled with 29 focus
genes involved in cell cycle, cell death, and reproductive
system development and function (Figure 3B), hence
recapturing genes that are involved in the classical
estrogen-induced cellular proliferative effects in reproductive tissues. In this network we observed that several
transcription regulators such as human homologs
DAXX, HES1, EGR1, TFAP2A, TFAP2B and NOTCH2
that are involved in cell death were deregulated while
interconnected CDC45L, CDK2, EIF4G2, MCM5, SAE1,
SPDYA, TOP1 and TTK involved in cell cycle progression and division were up-regulated, signifying that the
cell cycle molecular machinery has been activated by
estrogen. This is further supported by the second top
significant network (Figure 3C; p-value = 1.00E-43)
which is assembled from 28 focus genes known to be
associated with DNA replication, recombination and
repair, cell cycle and cancer. In this network, human
homologs CCNA1, JUN, E2F4 and PCNA formed highly
connected network hubs that are up-regulated to control many of the cell cycle progression and DNA replication processes. In contrast, human homologs NFE2L2,
NQO1 and MAOB which are critical to protect cells
from oxidative stress damage were down-regulated and
this could lead to accumulation of oxygen radicals that
can cause cellular damage including DNA. Estrogen

metabolism itself has been reported to be genotoxic and
can cause oxidative DNA damage [5,26]. Hence, genes
associated with DNA damage and repair such as human
homologs APEX1, APEX2, XPA, XRCC1 and PCNA,
were up-regulated presumably to repair oxidative DNA
damages resulted from estrogen metabolism and/or
replication errors due to increased DNA replication
activity. Moreover, increased expression of human
homolog JUB as captured in the network could lead to
increase activity of the up-regulated JUN [27] which is
an estrogen-responsive proto-oncogene known for its
malignant transforming properties and tumorigenic
potentials [28,29]. Likewise, up-regulation of JUB could
also increase AURKA activity[30], a known estrogenresponsive centrosome kinase, that could induce spindle
defects, chromosome mis-segregation, and genomic
instability leading to neoplastic transformation [7,31].
Taken together, the analysis revealed that treatment of
estrogen in zebrafish could induce a large number of
estrogen-responsive genes involved in cell cycle, proliferation, DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, recapitulating known mechanisms that are associated with
estrogen-dependent carcinogenesis and/or cancer. The
responsiveness to ICI 182,780 also suggests its potential
for screening of anti-estrogens and selective estrogen
receptor modulators (SERMs). The findings further lead
us to identify conserved estrogen-responsive genes
between zebrafish and human cancer cell lines.
Conservation of estrogen-responsive genes between
zebrafish and human cancer cells

To identify estrogen-responsive genes that are conserved
between zebrafish and estrogen-responsive human cancer
cell lines, genes responding to estrogen treatment in zebrafish (current study) and in human cancer cells [T47D
cells [20], MCF7 cells [21] and, MCF7 and Ishikawa cells
(Thomsen et al. unpublished data; Additional Files 2, 3,
4, 5) were compared. Of the 475 human homologs of
zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes, 139 (29%) were
responsive to estrogen in one or more human cancer cell
lines (Figure 4; Additional File 14). The percentage intersection of the human homologs of zebrafish estrogenresponsive genes (Additional File 15 ranged from 7%
(zebrafish and Ishikawa cells) to 14% (zebrafish and
MCF7_1 cells). Between the human cancer cell lines, the
percentage intersection ranged from 8% (MCF7_1 and
Ishikawa cells) to 26% (MCF7-1 and MCF7-2 cells; Additional File 16). Hence, the percentage intersection
between zebrafish and human cancer cell line datasets
were more than half of the percentage intersection
among the human cancer cell lines. Although the intersections were not high, this is not unexpected considering the differences in experimental designs, cell lines,
reagents, platforms, data processing and analysis

approaches that would have generated variations in capturing the molecular signals in response to estrogen.
Furthermore, differences in the estrogen-responsiveness
of genes captured at the whole-organism level of a fish
and human cancer cell lines were expected. Despite these
differences, we were able to identify a core set of 139
conserved estrogen-responsive genes that are active in
zebrafish and human cancer cell lines. This also suggests
that the core set of 139 conserved estrogen-responsive
genes are highly robust with regard to their responsiveness to estrogen since they were able to be identified as
‘significantly deregulated’ despite the biological, technical
and experimental variations.
Enrichment analysis of ERE motif and ER binding sites in
conserved estrogen-responsive genes

To examine potential ER-mediated transcriptional regulation of the 139 conserved estrogen-responsive genes,
we analyzed the distribution of ERE motifs (ERE:
GGTCAnnnTGACC) in their flanking regions. We
scanned the 20 kb flanking regions of the 139 conserved
estrogen-responsive genes and the whole genome of
zebrafish for the distribution of EREs. We found that,
the ERE motifs are randomly distributed in the zebrafish
genome and not enriched in the regulatory regions of
zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes (Additional File 17).
This observation is similar to the data reported for the

Lam et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/41

distribution of ERE in the human genome and human
estrogen-responsive genes [32]. This further suggests
that presence ERE motifs are not correlated with estrogen-responsiveness of genes throughout vertebrate.
Next, we scanned for ER binding sites in the cis-regulatory regions (within 100 kb) adjacent to these 139 conserved estrogen-responsive genes by mapping the
human genes to a list of known (experimentally validated by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq analysis) ER binding
sites ([20,21] (Fun et al 2010; personal communication)]
found in the human genome. Our analysis showed that
out of the 139 conserved estrogen-responsive genes, 65
had ER binding sites (Additional File 14). Moreover, a
total of 158 ER binding sites were significantly enriched
compared to an expected 65 binding sites (Binomial pvalue < 2.2E-16; Additional File 17). In addition, we also
scanned for ER binding sites for the rest 336 ‘non-conserved’ human homologs of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes that did not overlap with any of the human
cancer cell lines. The 336 ‘non-conserved’ genes had a
total of 210 ER binding sites. Therefore, on an average,
the number of binding site per gene is calculated to be
1.16 for the conserved genes and 0.62 for the non-conserved genes. Thus the current analysis suggests that ER
binding site is enriched in conserved estrogen-responsive genes compared to the ‘non-conserved’ human
homologs of zebrafish estrogen-responsive genes that
did not overlap with any of the human cancer cell lines.
The findings also indicate that comparative transcriptomics approach between two phylogenetically distant
species could help to narrow down estrogen-responsive
genes enriched with ER binding sites. The set of genes
with experimentally validated ER binding site would
suggest that these are direct ER-regulated genes. Estrogen-responsive genes without ER binding sites may be
regulated through interaction with other transcription
factors or via non-genomic actions.
Conserved estrogen-responsive signaling pathways and
novel insights

We used IPA to identify signaling pathways and key biological network enriched by the 139 conserved estrogenresponsive genes. The analysis revealed that signaling
pathways involved mainly in cell cycle progression and
DNA damage and repair such as mitotic roles of pololike kinase, CDK5 signaling, cell cycle regulation by
BTG family proteins, cell cycle: G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint regulation, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
signaling, ATM signaling and role of CHK proteins in
cell cycle checkpoint control were significantly enriched
(Fisher’s exact test p-value = 1.93E-07 to 3.34E-02; Figure 5A). In order to gain insight into the connectivity of
the signaling pathways with key biological functions and
genes, we overlay the selected enriched signaling

Page 10 of 15

pathways over the most significant network which is
associated with DNA replication, recombination and
repair, cell cycle and cancer (Figure 5B; Fisher’s exact
test p-value = 1.00E-43). Among the 27 conserved estrogen-responsive human homologs assembled in the network, 10 of them (37%; ASF1-B, CDK2, CDC6,
CHAF1A, HES1, MCM5, PASK, PLK2, SERPINA1,
TIPIN) have experimentally validated ER binding sites in
the human genes providing evidence for ER-mediated
transcriptional regulation of these genes.
Interestingly, AHR signaling and mitotic roles of pololike kinase, shown to be highly connected with different
sets of assembled genes/molecules in this network (Figure 5B insert) further confirmed not only their known
strong associations with DNA replication, recombination
and repair, cell cycle and cancer, but also revealed the
potential conserved estrogen-responsiveness of these signaling pathways. AHR signaling is known to demonstrate inhibitory crosstalk with ER signaling [33] and
also involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis
[34]. It is interesting to hypothesize from our network
analysis that an estrogen-activated ER cum basal AHR
crosstalk mechanism may be operating in cell-cycle regulation. Estrogen-activated ER has been reported to
compete for recruitment of shared coactivators with
AHR for expression of estrogen-responsive genes
[35,33]. In addition, estrogen has been reported to stimulate the recruitment of unliganded AHR to the proximal BRCA-1 promoter region and potentiate the effects
of the liganded ER in activation of BRCA-1 transcription
[36]. More recently, there has been increasing in vivo
evidence supporting that Ahr gene in its basal state,
without any xenobiotic ligand activation, functions as a
tumor suppressor gene and that its silencing may be
associated with cancer progression [37,38]. Repression
or loss of Ahr was found to increase expression of proliferative markers and repress tumor suppressor genes
leading to increased tumor incidence in rodent models
[37-39]. We have also observed down-regulation of
basal cyp1a1 transcripts, a well-studied ahr regulated
gene, in multiple tissues of zebrafish exposed to estrogen alone [14] hence suggesting the squelching of basal
ahr activity induced by estrogen. Although the nature of
basal/unliganded AHR actvities in nucleus are still
unclear, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and nuclear localization of unliganded AHR had been demonstrated in
MCF7, murine and zebrafish liver cell lines [40,41].
Based on these evidences, our network analysis suggests
that similar mechanism may be operating whereby
estrogen stimulates recruitment of basal/unliganded
AHR and shared coactivators for transcription regulation of estrogen-responsive genes hence reducing basal
AHR tumor suppressing effects. It has been previously
proposed that AHR tumor suppressing effects could

from mitotic entry through transition from metaphase to anaphase and mitotic exit followed by cytokinesis and subsequent centrosome
separation. Legends are similar to Figure 3B and 3C.

Lam et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/41

involve RB-E2F axis since interaction of AHR and RBE2F protein complex represses G1-S phase transition
[38,39]. Our network analysis suggests two potential
conserved targets of this ER and AHR signalling crosstalk, i.e. RB-E2F axis and HES1, which are known to be
regulated antagonistically by ER and AHR ligands and
are central to activating or inhibiting estrogen-mediated
cell proliferation [34,42,43].
As captured in the network (Figure 5B), the down-regulation of human homolog HES1 and the up-regulation
of cell cycle-related genes (e.g. human homologs E2F4,
CDK2, CCNA, CCNE) provide important evidence of a
conserved estrogen-mediated cell cycle regulatory
mechanism. HES1, known to be targeted by ER [42,44]
and AHR [43], is a transcription repressor that directly
represses E2F1 and it inhibits cell proliferation[42].
Therefore as represented in the network, the down-regulation of human homolog HES1 by estrogen, known to
be mediated by a novel type repressive estrogen
response element in human [44], appeared to be conserved between fish and human, and this could be pivotal for the up-regulation E2F transcription factors and
downstream cell cycle genes (human homologs CDK2,
CCNA, CCNE) that are necessary for G1-S phase transition leading to mitosis. Several E2F transcription factors
and cell cycle-related genes have been shown to be upregulated by estrogen as primary or secondary targets in
human breast cancer cell lines [45]. Our analysis indicate that E2F4 homolog is up-regulated likely to promote cell cycle progression and it has been associated
with breast carcinogenesis as previously reported
[46,47]. Interestingly, E2F4 is also known to repress cell
cycle, hence it can exert either tumor-suppressive or
oncogenic effects in vivo but the mechanism of this
switch is not known [48]. Estrogen-induced up-regulation of human homologs CDK2, CCNE and CCNA, will
presumably increase protein complexes such as CDK2/
cyclin E and CDK2/cyclin A that partly promote G1-S
phase transition and S-G2 phase transition, respectively,
before entering M phase [49,50].
A closer examination of a major (and also top significant) signaling pathway in the M phase, mitotic roles of
polo-like kinase, showed that the conserved estrogenresponsive genes (human homologs APC, CCNB1,
CCNB2, MKLP1, PLK, PP2A, PRC1) were all up-regulated (Figure 5C). Among the 7 human homologs,
MKLP1, PLK, PP2A have experimentally validated ER
binding sites providing evidence for a direct ligand activated-ER regulation of this signaling pathway. Hence,
through these genes and their encoded products we
observed entry points for estrogen regulation of mitosis;
from mitotic entry (via PLK, PP2A, CCNB) through
transition from metaphase to anaphase and mitotic exit
(via PLK, PRC1, CCNB, APC) followed by cytokinesis

Page 12 of 15

(via PLK, MKLP1) and subsequent centrosome separation (via PLK, CCNB) (Figure 5C).
Perhaps of greater significance is that our study indicates that estrogen regulation of cell cycle is conserved
between actinopterygian fish and humans. Since actinopterygian fish is phylogenetically positioned in the
extreme end of the vertebrate taxon when compared to
humans, this would suggest that estrogen regulation of
cell cycle is likely to be conserved across vertebrates.
This is interesting from an evolutionary perspective
because estrogen and its receptors are found to be the
most ancient steroidal -receptor signalling [51,52].
Given that estrogen modulates many physiological systems in higher vertebrates, it would be interesting to
speculate on the ancient physiological process(es) where
estrogen regulation of cell cycle is occurring. Although
the presence of estrogen and ligand-binding ER outside
vertebrate is controversial [53], a recent study in annelid
invertebrates [54] has demonstrated that annelid ERs
bind estrogen with high affinity and can be activated by
low concentration of estrogen. Keay and Thornton [54]
postulated that the ancient roles of estrogen and its
receptor are involved in regulation of reproductive
maturation and function including germ cell maturation
and provision of oocyte with vitellogenin. If so, the
ancient physiological process where estrogen regulation
of cell cycling may be occurring is during germ cell/
oocyte maturation. Taken together, our findings would
imply that estrogen regulation of cell cycle is likely one
of the earliest forms of steroidal-receptor controlled cellular processes within vertebrates and perhaps may even
extend back to annelid invertebrates.

Conclusion
Previously, we have shown that fish and human shared
conserved molecular hallmarks of liver tumors and its
progression [9]. Based on the transcriptome analysis in
this study, we provide evidence that the conservation
could possibly extend further to estrogen-induced carcinogenesis since fish is also susceptible to the carcinogens affecting humans. Collectively, our transcriptome
analysis captured multiple estrogen-responsive genes
and signaling pathways largely responsible for increased
cell proliferation, promote DNA damage and genome
instability and decreased tumor suppressing effects
(including cell death), which suggests a common
mechanism for estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. Comparative analysis revealed a core set of conserved estrogen-responsive genes with enriched ER binding sites and
a conserved estrogen-mediated cell cycle regulatory
mechanism involving HES1, RB-E2F axis and mitotic
roles of polo-Like kinase signaling pathway. Almost half
of the conserved genes have validated ER binding sites
indicating that they are direct ER targets. From an

Lam et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/41

evolutionary perspective, our findings suggest that estrogen regulation of cell cycle is perhaps one of the earliest
forms of steroidal-receptor controlled cellular processes.
The conserved estrogen-regulated cell cycle signature
identified in this study would be useful for characterizing estrogen-like environmental carcinogens and for
anti-estrogen compound screening. The findings also
warrant further cancer studies in zebrafish to involve
estrogen component in experimental design and interpretation of data which would aid in modelling estrogen-responsive cancer in zebrafish. To our knowledge,
this is the first report providing evidence for molecular
conservation of estrogen responsiveness between zebrafish and human cancer cell lines, hence demonstrating
the potential of zebrafish for estrogen-related cancer
research.
