Capitellid connections: contributions from
neuromuscular development of the maldanid
polychaete Axiothella rubrocincta (Annelida)
Research article

Nora Brinkmann and Andreas Wanninger*

Abstract
Background: Numerous phylogenetic analyses on polychaete annelids suggest a taxon Capitellida that comprises the
three families Maldanidae, Arenicolidae and Capitellidae. Recent molecular studies support the position of the Echiura,
traditionally ranked as a separate phylum, within the capitellids. In order to test the robustness of this molecular-based
hypothesis we take a different approach using comparative analyses of nervous and muscle system development in
the maldanid Axiothella rubrocincta. Employing immunocytochemistry in combination with confocal laserscanning
microscopy, we broaden the database on capitellid organogenesis, thereby incorporating classical histological data in
our analysis. Besides assessing possible shared features with the echiurans, we also discuss the variability of neural and
muscular characters within the Capitellida.
Results: The scaffold of the adult central nervous system, which is already established in early developmental stages of
Axiothella, consists of cerebral commissures that give rise to simple circumesophageal connectives with fused ventral
and dorsal roots and a single ventral neurite bundle. From the latter arise segmental neurites that innervate the
peripheral bodywall. Since there is no observable regular pattern, and individual neurites are lost during ontogeny,
their exact arrangement remains elusive. The pharynx is encircled by a prominent stomatogastric nerve ring, with a pair
of anterior and lateral proboscis neurites directly connecting it to the central nervous system. One pair of ventral and
one pair of dorsal longitudinal muscles form the earliest rudiments of the bodywall musculature in late larval stages,
while a continuous layer of circular muscles is lacking throughout ontogeny.
Conclusions: Comparative neurodevelopmental analysis of capitellid and echiuran species reveals several common
characters, including simple circumesophageal connectives, a single fused ventral nerve strand, and a stomatogastric
ring nerve, that support a close relationship of both taxa, thus corroborating recent molecular phylogenetic analyses.
The data on myogenesis show that four longitudinal muscle bands most likely represent an ancestral character not
only for the Capitellida, but for the Annelida in general. Whether or not circular muscles are part of the annelid
groundpattern remains uncertain.
Background
The Maldanidae, also referred to as 'bamboo worms',
comprise a group of deposit-feeding polychaete annelids
that live in tubes composed of bottom material. They are
usually considered related to the Arenicolidae and Capitellidae, and these three families are grouped together in
the taxon Capitellida [1]. Recent molecular analyses have
confirmed the established hypothesis of a close relation* Correspondence: awanninger@bio.ku.dk

ship between the Maldanidae and the Arenicolidae (lugworms) [2-4] and have repeatedly found indications that
Echiura, a hotly debated group that has been traditionally
ranked as a separate phylum, nests within the capitellid
polychaetes [2-7]. This novel view on the phylogenetic
position of the echiurans is further supported by morphological studies on neurogenesis [8-10]. In this context,
investigation of the maldanid species Axiothella
rubrocincta not only offers an opportunity to assess the
ingroup variability of neural characters within the Capitellida but also allows to compare neurogenesis and nervous system organization with those data that recently

have become available for echiurans. This serves as an
independent test of the molecular data which propose the
placement of the echiurans within the Capitellida.
Apart from the relevance of maldanids for the evolution
of neural characters, Axiothella may also aid in casting
light on the ancestral state of muscular systems in annelids and lophotrochozoans as a whole. The musculature
of the Capitellida comprises a closed outer layer of circular fibers similar to that of clitellate oligochaetes [11].
However, in contrast to the latter group, recent studies
have shown that circular muscles are only weakly developed or even absent in most polychaete taxa [11,12], and
it has been argued that absence of circular muscles represents the plesiomorphic state for the entire Annelida [11].
Therefore, the presence of closed circular muscles in the
Maldanidae represents a striking exception that deserves
further investigation.
The systematics of the monophyletic Maldanidae is primarily based on external morphological features of the
head, pygidium, and setae [13,14]. The maldanid ingroup
relationships, as well as the monophyly of the individual
subtaxa, are still unresolved [14,15]. Most studies of the
internal morphology of maldanid polychaetes have
focused on members of the subfamily Euclymeninae [13],
to which also the investigated species, Axiothella
rubrocincta, belongs. In particular, the comprehensive
investigations of Pilgrim [16-21] serve thereby as a basis
for comparison of our data on neuro- and myogenesis.
We discuss the present data in the context of a hypothesized close annelid-echiuran relationship and contribute
to the discussion on ancestral bodyplan features of the
Annelida. In this respect, it has to be taken into account
that A. rubrocincta represents a sibling species complex
with considerable plasticity between populations concerning reproductive mode, size, and feeding, but with no
obvious morphological differences [22]. Herein, we have
adopted most of Pilgrim's [19-21] designations. However,
we use different terms for some neuronal structures and
the anterior-most muscles in the head region due to
incongruency of the macro-anatomical data described by
Pilgrim, which are based on light microscopy, and our
confocal microscopy data.

Results
General development

Axiothella rubrocincta offspring develop inside a protective mucous cocoon, whereby development of the ciliated
prototroch and telotroch shortly before the initiation of
segmentation demarcates the onset of larval life. The
juvenile phase starts with shedding of the proto- and telotroch at the onset of metamorphosis, i.e., at the 5-setiger
stage. The cocoon contains larvae and juveniles of different stages; therefore, chronology of developmental events
can only be assessed on the basis of morphological char-

acters such as the number of setigers (setae-bearing segments), rather than by absolute time values after
fertilization (Figure 1).
The anterior region of early larvae is covered by short
cilia. When the larva starts to elongate posteriorly, three
ciliated bands start to differentiate: a broad prototroch
which blends into the cilia of the apical plate, a neurotroch, and a telotroch (Figure 2A, and 2B). Slight
invaginations of the epidermis demarcate the borders of
the first three segments, and setal bundles develop pairwise in the middle of each segment (Figure 1). Moreover,
the peristomium (= asetigerous first segment) and prostomium (= non-segmental, anterior-most region) differentiate anteriorly, together with the pygidium (nonsegmental part) in the posterior body. Posterior to the
prototroch and lateral to the ventral midline, a ciliated
structure, that most likely represents a protonephridium,
is visible (Figure 2B). Subsequently, a fourth setigerous
segment appears posterior to the third, and approximately at the same time a pair of ventral uncini forms in
each of these setigers (Figure 2E-F). Most of the ciliated
regions, including the prototroch, have already been
reduced at this stage, except for a few apical and posterior
cilia (Figure 2E). Meanwhile, two pairs of nephridia have
formed in the 4-setiger individuals. At first, the ciliated
nephridioducts extend over the second/third, and over
the third/fourth setiger, respectively (Figure 2E). Later on,
a third and fourth pair of nephridia develop posteriorly,
the body elongates further, and the digestive tract starts
to form. In the 7-setiger juveniles the pharynx surrounds
the mouth and extends along the entire length of the peristomial segment, followed by the esophagus in the first
setiger (= second segment) (Figure 2G, and 2J). As pharynx we term the anterior-most part of the non-muscular
foregut, in accordance with the descriptions of developmental stages of Axiothella mucosa by Bookhout and
Horn [23] (Note: the term "pharynx" has been variously
defined in the past [see, e.g., [24-27]]). The intestine
stretches from the third setiger to the anus in the pygidium (Figure 2J). The prostomium and peristomium fuse
and together form the head.
Neurogenesis as revealed by anti-tubulin
immunoreactivity

Apart from the external and internal cilia, antibodies
against α-acetylated tubulin label microtubules of neuronal processes in developmental stages of Axiothella
rubrocincta. Compared to the serotonin and FMRFamide
stainings, this antibody allows the most detailed description of neuronal structures in the investigated species.
Primarily, and shortly after the demarcation of the first
three segments, the developing cerebral ganglion is
labeled in late larval stages (Figure 2A-B). The cerebral
commissures are densely packed and give rise to simple

circumesophageal connectives whose ventral and dorsal
roots are almost completely fused. Both circumesophageal strands together form a neuronal loop that extends
from the cerebral ganglion into the anterior hyposphere,
where the two connectives converge and pass into the
ventral neurite bundle (Figure 2B). We use herein this
term instead of "ventral nerve cord", because immunocy-

tochemical analyses do not unequivocally allow discrimination between individual axons and dendrites, as is
possible by transmission electron or light microscopy.
The ventral neurite bundle in 3-setiger larvae consists of
two main strands that lie close together and extend along
the midventral line to the telotroch (Figure 2B). Later on,
a third, median strand is visible in the tubulin staining,

but labeling is obscured by a strong serotonergic signal
(Figure 2F). Several small neurites emanate laterally from
the ventral neurite bundle and innervate the bodywall of
the three newly formed setigerous segments (Figure 2B).
In the 4-setiger stage, the neuropil of the cerebral ganglion differentiates into a dorsal and a ventral lobe on
both sides of the body. From each dorsal lobe arises a
nuchal neurite that extends posteriorly to the dorsal epidermis (Figure 2E). In addition, the stomatogastric nervous system is established in developmental stages with
four setigers, whereby a prominent stomatogastric neurite encircles the pharynx. This oral ring neurite is at first
open on its anterior side but closes with the formation of
additional segments. One pair of anterior proboscis neurites connects the stomatogastric neurite to the cerebral
ganglion (Figure 2G and 2I). Furthermore, a lateral proboscis neurite branches off on each side of the stomatogastric ring nerve. These two lateral proboscis neurites
are directed anteriorly before they turn back, run posteriorly, and fuse with the circumesophageal connectives
(Figure 3A and 3B).
Apart from that, the number and arrangement of segmental neurites, which branch off the ventral neurite
bundle, changes considerably between the 4- and 7-seti-

ger stage. At first, two major segmental neurites are visible in the head region (Figure 2E). In most of the
following setigers, approximately four segmental neurites
are present in the posterior part of the segments (Figure
2E). Most of these segmental neurites appear to be ring
neurites (Figure 2J, inset). Their exact arborization patterns are elusive, since their arrangement is different in
the various segments. Moreover, the segmental neurites
are partly reduced during development. In particular, in
the anterior segments only a few small and irregularly
distributed neurite branches are visible in the 7-setiger
stage (Figure 2G and 2J). In the posterior four segments,
however, various segmental neurites are still present.
Some of these are located at the segmental borders,
whereas others appear to be positioned at intersegmental
furrows in the epidermis (Figure 2J).
Serotonergic nervous system

Throughout the entire development of A. rubrocincta,
the neurotransmitter serotonin is generally present in all
major structures of the central nervous system, such as
the cerebral ganglion, the circumesophageal connectives,
and the almost fused ventral neurite bundle (Figure 2 and
4). Prior to the formation of the first three setigerous seg-

nuchal nerve (nn), and the nerves to the buccal epithelium (bun). The cerebral ganglion is differentiated into a dorsal (dl-cg) and a ventral lobe (vl-cg).

ments in larval stages, the circumesophageal connectives
extend over more than one third of the whole body
length. Serotonergic perikarya are associated with both
the cerebral ganglion and the ventral neurite bundle (Fig-

ure 4A). In 3-setiger stages, three to five unipolar serotonergic perikarya are located dorsal to the cerebral
commissures (Figure 2B and 2C). However, in later developmental stages only two of these cells are visible (Figure

Brinkmann and Wanninger BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:168

2D and 2I; Figure 4C). In addition, up to nine perikarya
form a cluster of cells in the anterior-most part of the
ventral neurite bundle (Figure 2B). The staining of these
serotonin-positive cell bodies is not consistent, though,
and the number of labeled cells varies among individuals
of the same developmental stage. In specimens with three
or four setigers, a network of neurites innervates the
periphery of the lateral bodywall (Figure 2C and 2D).
Some of these neurites are co-localized with tubulinergic
segmental neurites. There are no serotonergic neurites
associated with the ciliated bands. Instead, approximately
two serotonergic perikarya are connected to the ventral
neurite bundle in each of the anterior segments. The ventral neurite bundle consists of one median longitudinal
neurite with a high serotonin content and two small lateral neurites that correspond to the main neurites in the
tubulin staining (Figure 2F, H-I). In some individuals a
peculiar neuronal projection of the right circumesophageal connective is directed towards the stomodeal region
(Figure 2D, F, H). Interestingly, this process is not labeled
with antibodies against α-acetylated tubulin (Figure 2F).
In the 7-setiger stage, the stomatogastric nerve ring and
partly its connective fibers to the central nervous system
exhibit serotonin immunoreactivity (Figure 2H and 2I).
Along the single ventral neurite bundle, perikarya are
only labeled in the peristomium and in the first setiger
(Figure 2H; Figure 4F).
FMRFamidergic nervous system

In general, labeling of FMRFamide greatly resembles the
results obtained for serotonin. However, due to the fact
that FMRFamide is also present in the glandular epidermis, the stainings show an intensive background signal in
the lateral regions of the trunk (Figure 5). At first, in late
larval stages with three setigers, FMRFamide is present in
the cerebral ganglion, the circumesophageal connectives,
and the ventral neurite bundle. In addition, the stomatogastric projection of the circumesophageal connective is
labeled (Figure 5A). Shortly afterwards, three neuronal
strands, one median and two lateral, are differentiated in
the ventral neurite bundle. Thereby, the FMRFamide signal is particularly prominent at the level of the setaebearing notopodia (Figure 5B). In juveniles with seven
segments, the neuropil of the cerebral ganglion shows
two dorsal neuronal processes that most likely correspond to the tubulinergic nuchal neurites. In addition,
the stomatogastric nerve ring and two lateral proboscis
neurites are present. Moreover, FMRFamide-positive
cells are connected to the anterior-most part of the ventral neurite bundle on either side (Figure 5C). In the posterior segments an FMRFamidergic peripheral plexus
innervates the dorsal side of the body and single, large
perikarya are arranged metamerically along the ventral
neurite bundle (Figure 5D).

Myogenesis

In pre-segmental larval stages, the first F-actin staining
labels few, very delicate muscle fibers of the bodywall.
The most prominent ones are oriented in a longitudinal
direction and have a ventro- or a dorso-lateral position
(Figure 4A). In larvae with three setigers, these longitudinal muscles form very broad muscle bands. Thus, one
pair of ventral and one pair of dorsal longitudinal muscles
extend from the peristomium to the posterior-most part
of the body, where an anal sphincter is visible in the
pygidium (Figure 4B and 4D). The labeled prostomial and
peristomial muscles arise from anterior elongations of the
longitudinal muscles. Laterally, setal muscles are attached
to the base of the setal sheath (Figure 4B). In 5-setiger
individuals, the median layer of both ventral longitudinal
muscles tapers towards the prostomial tip, forming the
anterior diagonal muscles, whereas the innermost layer is
directed towards the mouth (Figure 4D). The latter composes the longitudinal retractor sheath muscle of the
pharynx. Later on, the bucco-pharyngeal musculature
exhibits a basket-like structure comprising in addition
circular retractor sheath muscles. The dorsal portion of
the ventral longitudinal muscles extends straight towards
the anterior pole of the prostomium (Figure 4G). Interestingly, a continuous sheath of circular bodywall muscles is
lacking throughout development of Axiothella, and the
four longitudinal muscle bands do not form a closed muscle layer.

Discussion
Development and structure of the nervous system in
Capitellida

Immunocytochemical data on polychaete neurogenesis
remain scarce and are mostly restricted to isolated developmental stages. At present, there are only few studies
that document the neuronal differentiation for complete
developmental series and they focus on polychaetes with
an indirect mode of development [28-31]. The two classical TEM-based studies on species of the Capitellida likewise offer only limited insights. The first is restricted to
the 3-setiger larva of Arenicola cristata (Arenicolidae),
whereas the second one describes different developmental stages up to metamorphosis in Capitella capitata
(Capitellidae) [32,33]. In both studies the presented ultrastructural data are only superficially interpreted with
respect to gross morphology.
One of the most prominent features of trochozoan larvae is the ciliated prototroch and its underlying serotonergic nerve ring. The latter was most likely already
present in the last common ancestor of the lophotrochozoans [34,35]. Although developmental stages of
Axiothella rubrocincta possess a ciliated prototroch, a
corresponding serotonergic innervation was not found in
the present study, thus corroborating earlier studies on

the benthic larvae of Arenicola [32]. Accordingly, it
appears likely that the larvae of Axiothella may have secondarily lost not only the serotonergic innervation of the
prototroch, but maybe the entire prototroch nerve as
such.
Elements of the adult central nervous system, such as
the cerebral ganglion, the circumesophageal connectives,
and the ventral neurite bundle, are established at a very
early stage of Axiothella development. This simple and
essentially adult organization of the central nervous system in larval stages corresponds to the neuronal arrangement described for the benthic larva of Arenicola and
other direct developing polychaete annelids [32,36]. One
characteristic feature during the observed developmental
period, however, is the apparently unpaired ventral neurite bundle that does not show a primarily dichotomous
organization in Axiothella. By contrast, the larvae of
Arenicola possess a broad ventral neurite bundle [32]. In
the genus Capitella, two different conditions have been
documented, namely a penta-neural organization in C.
capitata and two separate axonal tracts in C. teleta [3638]. This variety in the neuronal composition of the ventral neurite bundle in developmental stages is also known
from other polychaete larvae and may either indicate distant phylogenetic relationships or merely reflect the
recently suggested general wide plasticity of polychaete
neural patterning and nervous system anatomy [31].
Apart from that, the general arrangement of the central
nervous system is consistent with previous investigations
of the adult maldanid and arenicolid neuroanatomy
[21,39-42]. For example, no indications of ganglionic segmentation have been found in Arenicola [41]. Moreover,
the description of the adult ventral nerve cord in the maldanid species Clymenella torquata [21] can be directly
correlated with the observed threefold pattern of the ventral neurite bundle with one median and two lateral main
strands in the tubulin, serotonin, and FMRF-amide stainings. It is highly probable that the lateral tubulinergic
strands can be assigned to a dorsally located fibrous neuropil which is separated into two parts by giant fibers that
run along the ventral midline. Such multicellular giant
nerve fibers have been described for several species of the
Capitellida [21,39,41,43-45]. The serotonergic and FMRFamidergic median strand of the ventral neurite bundle
in Axiothella represents most likely the precursor of such
a giant nerve.
Despite these similarities in the central nervous system,
conflicting views exist with regard to the stomatogastric
and peripheral nervous system. The prominent stomatogastric nerve ring around the pharynx in Axiothella
rubrocincta has not been mentioned in previous studies
on the nervous system of the Maldanidae [21]. However,
the neuronal fibers that connect the ring nerve to the
central nervous system have been depicted and described

Page 9 of 13

in a similar way for the euclymenin species Clymenella
torquata [[21]; Figure 3 present work]. The position and
course of the lateral proboscis nerve in Clymenella,
termed anterior ring nerve by Pilgrim [21], is almost
identical to the one in Axiothella. The same holds true for
the anterior proboscis nerves, which only differ in number, with one nerve being present in Axiothella and in
several species of the genus Clymene, and three anterior
proboscis nerves in Clymenella [21,46-48]. It has to be
taken into account that this comparison involves on the
one hand different taxa and on the other juvenile versus
adult features. Given, in addition, the above stated differences in the applied methodology, it is not possible to
unequivocally decide whether or not these differences
indeed reflect natural conditions. However, in Capitella,
a pair of nerves, emanating from the cerebral neuropil,
encircles the mouth region, and the even more closely
related taxon Arenicola has an additional nerve ring that
surrounds the foregut at the transition between the pharynx and the esophagus [33,49]. Moreover, the descriptions of the nerves that supply the bucco-pharyngeal
region in Arenicola agree in basic features with the documented arrangement in Axiothella and Clymenella
[41,49]. Accordingly, irrespective of the varying position
of the stomatogastric nerve ring, this feature is most
probably part of the groundpattern of Capitellida.
The peripheral nervous system of Axiothella consists
mainly of the segmental neurites that emerge from the
ventral neurite bundle. Additional longitudinal nerve
fibers have not been detected in the setigers. The
arborization patterns and the exact number of the segmental neurites per setiger remain elusive. However, the
arrangement of the segmental neurites does not show an
obvious metameric pattern and the number of these neurites is apparently reduced during development of Axiothella. Similar observations have been documented
previously for the adult nervous system of other maldanid
taxa [21,39]. This has led to the conclusion that the nervous system of the Maldanidae shows only few signs of
metamerism, namely by the presence of larger clusters of
neurons opposite the parapodia and of larger nerves at
the segment boundaries [21]. In Arenicola, however, the
organization of the nervous system is very regular. A pair
of nerves originates from the ventral nerve cord at the
level of the borders between annuli, while opposite each
setigerous annulus there are two to four pairs of nerves
[41]. Slight differences in the life history traits and ecology of Axiothella and Arenicola might be the reason for
the disparity in the organization of the peripheral nervous system.
Comparative aspects of the capitellid and the echiuran
nervous system

While adult echiurans show no signs of external segmentation, their larval and juvenile stages possess a clear

metameric organization. Apart from the transient annulation of the body and the regular arrangement of mucous
glands, this segmental organization is reflected in the
structures of the nervous system during development.
For example, repetitive units of serotonergic perikarya
are distributed along the ventral nerve cord and precisely
two pairs of peripheral nerves are associated with each
ganglionic unit [8-10]. In contrast to that, there are only
few signs of a metameric pattern in the maldanid Axiothella. According to Gamble and Ashworth [41], there is
likewise no evidence for a segmental arrangement in
Arenicola, except for the presence of giant cells in regular
intervals. For the echiurans, however, it has been noted
that ganglion-like groupings of perikarya are difficult to
identify, since the perikarya are almost evenly distributed
along the ventral nerve cord [8]. In addition, it appears
that neuronal structures with a segmental arrangement
such as the peripheral neurites are subsequently reduced
during the ontogeny of Axiothella. Moreover, in Arenicola, these segmental neurites show indeed a regular
organization with two to four pairs of nerves arising from
the ventral nerve cord opposite each setigerous annulus
[41]. Another indication for a possibly common structure
of the nervous system of the Capitellida and the Echiura
is given by serotonergic immunoreactivity in the echiuran
Bonellia viridis, apparently revealing a stomatogastric
nerve ring ([9]: Figure 4A, page 108). In addition to that,
the general organization of the central nervous system in
maldanid and echiuran species is largely similar with, e.g.,
simple circumesophageal connectives and a single ventral
nerve cord in the adult. The latter results from a fusion
process of an originally multi-stranded or very broad
neurite bundle in the echiurans, similar to the condition
found in Arenicola and in other genera of the Capitellidae
[32,38,50]. Taken together, these similarities (Table 1) are
in accordance with molecular analyses that suggest a
close relationship of echiuran and capitellid taxa.
Myogenesis of the bodywall musculature in Capitellida

The number and position of longitudinal muscle bands in
adult polychaete annelids varies considerably among taxa
[11]. However, there are only four to six longitudinal
muscle bands present in most polychaetes [51]. In contrast to that, the altered arrangement in larvae of Capitella with eight primary longitudinal muscles most likely
constitutes an exception due to secondary multiplication
[52].
In the case of adult individuals of Axiothella rubrocinta,
the number of longitudinal strands is not known. However, the closely related maldanid species Clymenella
torquata has been depicted by illustrations of cross sections with up to six longitudinal bands that form an
almost closed muscle layer [19]. In larval stages of Axiothella, only four delicate longitudinal muscles form the

Page 10 of 13

precursors of the later paired ventral and dorsal longitudinal muscle bands. Similarly, one pair of ventrolateral
and another pair of dorsolateral longitudinal muscles are
present in the 3-setiger larva of Arenicola cristata [32].
Four longitudinal muscles have also been documented in
all recently investigated polychaete larvae and in developmental stages of some oligochaetes [30,53-55]. In sipunculan larvae, the first longitudinal muscle fibers likewise
form a quartet and give rise to the retractor muscles of
the adult [56,57]. These data strongly suggest that two
pairs of primary longitudinal muscles organized in separate strands represent the plesiomorphic condition for
the Capitellida and the Annelida altogether, although data
on muscle development of a number of annelid taxa
including the echiurans are still lacking.
Circular bodywall muscles are either poorly developed
or not present in most polychaete taxa studied so far [12].
This absence of circular fibers has been interpreted as a
plesiomorphic polychaete character [11]. Accordingly,
the circular fibers of the capitellid species that form a
closed muscle layer, similar to that of the clitellates, could
represent an apomorphic feature of this group. In the
investigated individuals of Axiothella, however, circular
fibers have neither been documented in the pre-segmental larvae nor in the 7-setiger juveniles. In fact, in adult
specimens of Axiothella the longitudinal bodywall muscles are usually more prominently developed than the circular fibers [58]. Accordingly, the lack of circular fibers
during development implies that these muscles are not a
larval character in Axiothella but that development of circular muscles is restricted to adult stages. By contrast,
complete circular fibers have been interpreted as a juvenile polychaete character due to their presence in progenetic species such as Dinophilus gryociliatus and
Parapodrilus psammophilus [12].
The gradual anterior-posterior development of circular
muscles starts only after the initial differentiation of the
longitudinal fibers in larvae of Capitella [52]. In the 3-setiger larva of Arenicola, circular fibers are present in more
or less regular intervals along the longitudinal body axis
[32]. Unfortunately, the dynamics involved in the formation of this circular musculature in Arenicola have not
been studied. However, based on the gap in timing
between the differentiation of longitudinal and circular
muscles in Capitella, it has been suggested that the lack
of circular fibers in polychaetes could be interpreted as a
convergent reduction due to 'switching off' of the respective ontogenetic program [59]. Hence, the last common
annelid ancestor might have possessed weak circular
fibers which only differentiate relatively late during
ontogeny. The complete layer of circular fibers, as
expressed in the clitellates and capitellids, would then
have evolved only in a second step to enable peristaltic
movement and burrowing in firm substrate [59].

* The ventral connectives in Capitella are fused only in the region of the segmental ganglia. In other genera of the Capitellidae, however, there
is a clear tendency towards a fused ventral nerve cord.

The presence of circular muscles is a shared feature of
the capitellid taxa, despite the heterogeneous development of this muscle group. However, the question
whether circular muscles are part of the annelid groundplan is still under discussion, also because the phylogenetic tree of the Annelida remains unresolved [2-4].
Moreover, the different myogenetic pathway of circular
muscle formation in sipunculans, described recently as a
synchronous-fission-type, strikingly shows the divergent
ontogenetic routes that lead to the establishment of the
circular layer of the bodywall musculature in annelids
and their closest allies [35].

ence of circular muscles is certainly a shared but not necessarily a plesiomorphic feature of the former.
The general organization of the nervous system is
largely similar in capitellid and echiuran species, corroborating molecular analyses that argue for a close relationship of both taxa. However, further investigations, in
particular of the neuronal connections between the stomatogastric and the central nervous system in echiuran
species, are needed to substantiate this notion, since
some of these common morphological traits might have
been caused by convergent reduction events.

Methods
Conclusions
Our immunocytochemical data on morphogenesis in the
maldanid Axiothella complement previous studies and
facilitate a comparison of the nervous system and musculature in capitellid polychaetes. Based on this comparative analysis, it appears that the adult nervous system of
the Capitellida is secondarily reduced, comprising simple
circumesophageal connectives, a characteristic stomatogastric nerve ring, and a single ventral connective as
shared characters. The arrangement and number of segmental nerves and ganglion-like clusters of perikarya differ in the investigated species, possibly due to differences
in the benthic life style. The data on myogenesis support
the view that four longitudinal muscle bands are ancestral
for Capitellida and the entire Annelida, while the pres-

Animal collection and fixation

Tubes housing adult Axiothella rubrocincta (Johnson,
1901) were collected in the intertidal of False Bay, San
Juan Island, Washington, USA, during summer 2008. The
tubes contained mucous cocoons from which larvae were
dissected and transferred to Petri dishes filled with Millipore-filtered seawater (MFSW). Within the cocoons, the
most advanced developmental stages were found to be 7setiger juveniles, of which some exhibit precursors of
additional segments. Prior to fixation, the specimens
were anesthetized with a 1:1 dilution of MFSW and
MgCl2 (7%). They were then fixed at room temperature in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for
1.5 h, washed three times in PB, and stored at 4°C in PB
containing 0.1% sodium azide (NaN3).

Immunolabeling and confocal laserscanning microscopy
(CLSM)

The following steps were all performed at 4°C. Antibody
staining was preceded by tissue permeabilization for 1 h
in 0.1 M PB with 0.1% NaN3 and 0.1% Triton X-100
(PTA), followed by overnight incubation in block-PTA
[6% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) in PTA]. The primary antibodies, polyclonal rabbit
anti-serotonin (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA, dilution
1:800), polyclonal rabbit anti-FMRFamide (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA, dilution 1:400), and monoclonal
mouse anti-acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, dilution 1:1000), all in block-PTA, were either applied separately or in a mixed cocktail for 24 h. Subsequently, the
specimens were rinsed in block-PTA with three changes
over 6 h and incubated in a mixture of 4'6-diamidino-2phenyl-indole [DAPI (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA)],
secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies [goat
anti-rabbit FITC (Sigma-Aldrich), dilution 1:400; goat
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen), dilution 1:1000;
goat anti-mouse FITC (Sigma-Aldrich), dilution 1:400]
and, for F-actin visualization, Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA; dilution 1:40) in
block-PTA overnight. Finally, the specimens were washed
three times in PB without NaN3 and were directly
mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) on glass slides. A minimum of 10 immunolabeled specimens per developmental stage was analyzed
for each antibody. Approximately 65 image stacks of optical sections were recorded as Z-wide-projections with
0.1-0.5 μm step size using a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence
microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP 2 confocal
laserscanning unit (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Setae are
visible in the tubulin scans due to autofluorescence.
Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 to
adjust contrast and brightness and were arranged into
figure plates using Adobe Illustrator CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). The three-dimensional computer reconstructions were generated with the imaging
software Imaris v. 5.5.3 (Bitplane, Zürich, Switzerland)
using surface rendering algorhithms.
