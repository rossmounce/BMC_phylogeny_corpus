Abstract
Background: ATRX is a tightly-regulated multifunctional protein with crucial roles in mammalian development.
Mutations in the ATRX gene cause ATR-X syndrome, an X-linked recessive developmental disorder resulting in
severe mental retardation and mild alpha-thalassemia with facial, skeletal and genital abnormalities. Although
ubiquitously expressed the clinical features of the syndrome indicate that ATRX is not likely to be a global
regulator of gene expression but involved in regulating specific target genes. The regulation of ATRX expression is
not well understood and this is reflected by the current lack of identified upstream regulators. The availability of
genomic data from a range of species and the very highly conserved 5’ regulatory regions of the ATRX gene has
allowed us to investigate putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in evolutionarily conserved regions of
the mammalian ATRX promoter.
Results: We identified 12 highly conserved TFBSs of key gene regulators involved in biologically relevant processes
such as neural and testis development and alpha-globin regulation.
Conclusions: Our results reveal potentially important regulatory elements in the ATRX gene which may lead to the
identification of upstream regulators of ATRX and aid in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
underlie ATR-X syndrome.

Background
ATR- X (alpha thalassemia, mental retardation, X-linked)
syndrome is an X-linked recessive developmental disorder affecting males. Clinical features include severe mental retardation, mild alpha-thalassemia, microcephaly,
short stature, and facial, skeletal and genital abnormalities [1-3]. The ATRX protein is large (280 kDa) and contains two highly conserved domains, a PHD-like finger
which interacts with chromatin, and a SWI//SNF-like
ATPase domain which displays nucleosome remodeling
activity, implying that ATRX functions as a chromatin
remodeling protein [4-6].

While ATRX is widely expressed throughout development, studies in mice have revealed that ATRX has specific tissue/cell type functions [7-9]. For example, while
loss of ATRX in chondrocytes has minimal effects on
bone growth, mice lacking ATRX in the forebrain show
apoptosis of cortical neurons leading to a reduction in
forebrain size [9,10]. Moreover targeted overexpression
of Atrx gives rise to phenotypic features that are common
to ATR-X syndrome such as severe neural defects and
facial dysmorphology [11].Thus, ATRX expression and
function must rely on temporal-spatial regulators and/or
cofactors for tissue-specific gene regulation and function.
While a number of cofactors have been discovered for
ATRX including Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) [12],
Enhancer of zeste (EZH2) [13], Death domain-associated
protein (DAXX) [6], methyl-CpG binding protein

(MECP2) [14] and Cohesin [15], the upstream regulators
of ATRX transcription remain unknown and the boundaries of the ATRX promoter remain undefined.
In an earlier study focused on the description of the
ATRX gene and protein sequence, the putative promoter
region of human ATRX was reported to contain ’multiple
CCAAT boxes and binding sites for the CTF family of transcription factors’ [16]. Thereafter, studies have established
that the CCAAT motif is not only recognized by the
Nuclear Factor 1/CCAAT transcription factor (NF1/CTF)
family but also several other transcription factors/complexes which include; NF-E3, GATA1, NF-Y and C/EBP
[17]. Thus, relatively little is known about the ATRX promoter and the upstream regulatory regions of the gene.
The aim of this study was to establish a starting point for
experimental studies on the human ATRX promoter by:
(i) identifying evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) in
the mammalian ATRX promoter and 5’ regulatory regions
using phylogenetic footprinting and (ii) identifying putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).

Results
Conservation analysis of the ATRX promoter and
5’ upstream sequence

The degree of conservation between the regulatory
regions of ATRX from different mammals, compared
with human, were examined across a region spanning
-13 kbp to +300 bp, which includes the 215 bp 5’UTR
of human ATRX sequence [16] since some regulatory
elements can lie within the 5’UTR of a gene [17,18].
The molecular timescale of divergence between these
species are indicated in Figure 1.
Conservation analysis revealed a clear loss of homology beyond (-500) between human and the most distantly related elephant and tammar wallaby. In addition,
three additional dispersed regions of homology were
identified by pair-wise alignment of human, mouse, dog,
horse, elephant and armadillo regulatory regions. These
are located at (-1069 to -693), (-1623 to -1457) and

(-12759 to -12669) of the human sequence, and were
labelled conserved region 1 (CR1), CR2 and CR3 where
CR3 lies most distal to the Transcription Start Site
(TSS). Thus, four dispersed regions of high conservation
were identified in the upstream regulatory region of
the mammalian ATRX promoter. These are shown in
Figure 2 in a comparison of four distantly-related species representing a broad range of eutherian divergence.
Armadillo, representing Xenarthra was not included in
Figure 2 and Figure 3 due to the sequence being incomplete. The conserved regions were then examined computationally for conserved, putative transcription factor
binding sites.
Putative TFBSs within evolutionarily conserved regions

Putative TFBSs within the putative promoter of ATRX
(-500 to +300) were investigated using the online program, Mulan http://mulan.dcode.org/. Since bioinformatic analyses of DNA sequences typically produce a
large number of potential TFBSs and because there is
such high sequence conservation in this region, only
TFBSs with 85%-100% sequence conservation and consensus identity, as defined by the program matrices,
were considered for discussion. These are indicated in
Figures 3 and 4.
In addition, a manual examination of the core promoter region for ATRX revealed a putative recognition site
for TFIID known as the initiator (Inr) element (YYANWYY)[18,19] that is not represented in the TRANSFAC
database, and which is fully conserved from human to
wallaby (Figure 3). Within the core promoter region,
there are also two fully conserved CCAAT-box domains
as well as binding sites for HNF4 and CREB.
The putative TFBSs within CR1-3 were analysed by
processing different paired combinations of mouse,
human, horse, dog, elephant and armadillo sequences
with Mulan http://mulan.dcode.org/. This is due to the

fact that Mulan requires a relatively high conservation of
sequence in order to identify TFBSs. Wallaby was not
included in this figure due to low conservation of
sequence in this region. The TFBSs found in CR1-3 are
indicated in Figure 4 and Table 1 contains a summary
of all highly conserved TFBSs in the mammalian ATRX
5’regulatory regions, in addition to the biological role of
the corresponding transcription factors (TFs).
The first intron of some eukaryotic genes, including
human, has been shown to contain regulatory elements
which influence gene expression [20]. An attempt to
align intron 1 of human, mouse, horse and dog ATRX
revealed little sequence conservation. Pair-wise alignment
of these species using both Mulan and ClustalW2 was
only achievable for the combinations of human/mouse
and human/horse and these alignments revealed only
small regions of conservation that did not overlap indicating that it is unlikely that conserved TFBSs are located
within intron 1.

Discussion
A key obstacle in the study of ATRX function has been
the absence of identified upstream regulators. The availability of genome data from a wide range of species and
the recent development of powerful bioinformatic tools
has provided a means of studying the mammalian ATRX
promoter and regulatory regions. In this study we
attempted to derive information on the evolution and
conservation of the ATRX 5’regulatory region for the
purpose of identifying putative regulators of ATRX, and
generate a foundation upon which to design future
experiments. In our approach, we make the assumption
that the transcriptional regulation of ATRX is conserved.
Analysis of the ATRX gene revealed high conservation of
synteny from humans to birds (data not shown) and high
sequence conservation between eutherian mammals and a
marsupial, the tammar wallaby. Out of the (-13 kbp to
+300 bp) studied, the region corresponding to (-500 to
+300) of the human ATRX promoter region was found

to be the most conserved with 82-90% identity between
humans and other mammals studied. The high conservation between human and mouse coding sequences (88%),
in addition to high conservation between the human and

murine ATRX proteins [21], further supports the extrapolation of data generated from studies in mouse.
The core promoter is the fundamental part of the eukaryotic promoter that provides a platform for the assembly

of the RNA polymerase II initiation complex (reviewed in
[22]). This region is usually within 80-100 bp surrounding
the TSS and is typically a focused region, as opposed to
dispersed, containing elements such as a TATA box, BRE,
Inr, MTE, DPE and DCE. However, these elements are not
universal and not all are present in the same promoters.
Moreover, some core promoters do not contain any of the
known core promoter elements. Bioinformatic analysis of
the very highly conserved sequence around the TSS,
which likely comprises the core promoter of ATRX, did
not reveal any typical core promoter elements; however,
manual examination of the core promoter region for
ATRX revealed a potential initiator (Inr) element (YYANWYY) [19] which is a recognition site for TFIID, a key
basal transcription factor (reviewed by [23]).
Analysis of the 5’ regulatory region of mammalian
ATRX revealed several highly conserved, potential regulatory motifs. Only those sites that could be verified in
the literature in terms of sequence identity to an experimentally proven consensus binding sequence are summarised in Table 1.

In ATR-X syndrome, mental retardation manifests in
approximately 95% of patients and alpha-thalassaemia,
one of the defining symptoms of the syndrome, is present in 90% of cases while 80% of patients have genital
abnormalities [1]. Significantly, the TFBSs identified in
our study correlate to TFs with overlapping roles in
neural, globin and testicular development, as well as
roles in tissues that are affected to a lesser extent in
ATR-X syndrome, suggesting that our findings are not
likely to be the result of chance-occurrence of motifs in
a DNA sequence. For example, both YY1 and CP2 are
involved in brain development [24,25], NF-Y and CP2
have a role in globin regulation [17,26], YY1, NF-Y and
CP2 are implicated in the development and function of
the testis [27-29], and FOXJ2/NKX2-5 is one of the
master transcriptional regulators of cardiogenesis [30]
where cardiac defects are observed in 18% of ATRX
patients.
Furthermore, like ATRX, most of these TFs are crucial
for development (YY1, NF-Y, CP2, HNF4, FOXJ2) and
ubiquitously expressed (YY1, NF-Y, CP2, E2F), indicating

Tang et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:200

spatial and functional compatibility with ATRX
expression.
Interestingly, STAT5B, HNF4 and HNF6 play important roles in liver function [34-36] which do not feature
in typical clinical descriptions of ATR-X syndrome yet
raises the question of whether ATRX, which appears to
be quite highly expressed in the fetal liver [31], has a
role in liver development and/or function which is not
clinically obvious in ATR-X syndrome. Alternatively,
HNF4 expression is restricted to liver, kidney and intestines [32] and a regulatory pathway involving HNF4 and
ATRX is possible given that renal-urinary abnormalities
manifest in approximately 14% of ATR-X patients and
gastro-intestinal problems arising from gut dismotility
occur in 75% of clinical cases [1]. Furthermore, HNF4
binding sites in many genes expressed in the liver have
been found in the vicinity of other liver-enriched TFs
such as NF-Y and CREB [33] which is the case in the 5’
regulatory region of ATRX. Thus, our investigation has
revealed a handful of potential upstream regulators for
ATRX expression which are of biological and clinical
relevance. Some of these are discussed further.
The transcription factor Yin Yang (YY1) is a fully conserved, multifunctional protein that can function both as
an activator or repressor of transcription (for a review, see
[34]). Human YY1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding
protein with consensus binding sequence: SNCCATNTT
[35,36]. It was later reported that a similar consensus;
CCATCTT with flanking nucleotides of G or C constitutes
an ‘activator’ motif for YY1 function with the original consensus being characteristic of a ‘repressor’ site [37]. The
consensus sequence identified in the eutherian alignment
corresponds to a YY1 binding site for transcription repression, suggesting that YY1 may be a negative regulator of
ATRX transcription.
Like ATRX, YY1 is ubiquitously expressed and genetic
ablation of Atrx and Yy1 in separate mouse studies lead
to lethality shortly after implantation, suggesting both
proteins play crucial roles in development [6,27].
Furthermore, both ATRX and YY1 have important roles
in the development of the brain and nervous system. For
example, overexpression of Atrx in mouse embryos lead
to similar neurological phenotypes of growth retardation,
exencephaly and neural tube defects [11] that are also
seen in heterozygous mutants of Yy1 [24,38], suggesting
that ATRX and YY1 could theoretically operate in the
same pathway during mammalian neurodevelopment. An
obvious hypothesis for the ATRX-YY1 relationship
would involve YY1 as a negative upstream regulator of
ATRX transcription. Such a model may seem spurious in
light of the fact that ATR-X syndrome in humans is well
documented to arise from reduced levels of functional
ATRX protein [1]. However, overexpression of Atrx in
transgenic mice gave rise to cranio-facial dysmorphology

Page 6 of 10

and seizures which are reminiscent of ATR-X syndrome
[11], indicating that expression levels of ATRX require
strict regulation for the survival of cells and organisms.
In addition, deletion of the 5’ UTR of ATRX, where the
putative YY1 binding site is located, has been reported in
an ATR-X patient [31] and while the precise mechanism
of disease arising from this clinical mutation is unclear,
we speculate that YY1 could constitute the negative feedback loop for ATRX expression while a different transcription factor may be involved in the upregulation of
ATRX.
Additionally, separate immunostaining of YY1 and
ATRX in rodent testis sections reveal a strikingly similar
pattern of expression as both proteins are expressed in
Sertoli and Leydig cells and in spermatogonia and spermatocytes but not round spermatids and spermatozoa
[27,39,40]. Moreover, both YY1 and ATRX have been
shown to cause defects in meiosis when ablated in spermatocytes and oocytes respectively [27,41]. Thus, it is possible that YY1 may also regulate ATRX in the mammalian
testis.
Unrelated promoters for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II
have several common elements including the cap signal,
TATA box, CCAAT box and GC boxes [42]. We identified three CCAAT motifs at (+3), (-34) and (-65) which
are described in one of the earliest publications on the
ATRX gene and protein [16]. In addition, the spacing
between all three CCAAT boxes and between the
CCAAT boxes and other regulatory motifs is conserved
across all eutherian promoters studied, consistent with
findings which suggest that in higher eukaryotic promoters, sequences around the CCAAT box and the spacing
between the CCAAT box and other regulatory motifs are
highly conserved for specific genes in different species
[43,44].
The CCAAT box is estimated to be present in one third
of eukaryotic house-keeping and lineage-specific genes
[16] and multiple copies are found in promoters of genes
regulated during cell proliferation [42]. Notably, ATRX is
known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a cell-cycle
dependant manner [12] and the ATRX promoter with its
multiple CCAAT boxes is typical of a gene that is regulated during cell proliferation.
Of all the transcription factors that bind CCAAT
boxes, NF-Y (also known as CBF and CP1) can be distinguished from other proteins on the basis of DNA
sequence requirements since NF-E3, GATA1 and C/EBP
often bind sites containing an incomplete CCAAT motif
[42]. High affinity binding sites for NF-Y contain YRR at
the 5’ flanking end of the CCAAT box and CA at the 3’
adjacent sequence. Changes in three or more nucleotides
decreases or abolishes NF-Y binding, while one or two
nucleotide changes lead to a modest decrease in NF-Y
binding [42]. The CCAAT boxes we identify in the ATRX

Tang et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/200

promoter contain highly conserved GCG (+2) and TAG
(-34, -65) at the 5’ flanking sequence and TG (+2), GG
(-34) and AA (-65) at the 3’ flanking sequence. Thus, by
definition, the highly conserved CCAAT boxes at (-34
and -65) would be able to bind NF-Y.
NF-Y is an evolutionarily conserved TF present from
yeast to human [45]. A double mutation leads to
embryonic lethality in mice as early as 8.5 dpc while
heterozygous mutations are similar to wild-type [45].
NF-Y has been shown to regulate genes in cooperation
with members of the Sp (specificity protein) family of
TFs. For example, NF-Y and Sp3 together regulate the
MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase) gene
[46], and NF-Y and Sp1 have known roles in the regulation of topo II (topoisomerase II) [47], SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) [48] and SOX9 (SRY-related HMG box
9) [28]. ATRX, SF-1 and SOX9 play crucial roles in the
testicular development pathway and thus it is possible
that ATRX, SF-1 and SOX9 are regulated by a similar
set of upstream factors - including NF-Y.
The CP2 TF family exists as six isoforms in human
(LBP-1a-d, -9 and -32) and four in mouse (CP2a-c and
CRTR). CP2, also known as CP2c, has important roles in
hematopoeisis, immune response, cell cycle and neural
development [25]. These biological processes advocate
CP2 to be a temporal, spatial and functionally compatible
regulator of ATRX. While immune response has not been
typically linked to ATRX function, a recent study implicated ATRX and one of its cofactors, DAXX [6], in intrinsic antiviral resistance to the HSV-1 virus [49].
In addition, CP2c was initially identified as an activator
of mouse alpha-globin via the consensus sequence
CNRGN6CNRS [50] and thus, the putative regulatory
pathway between CP2c and ATRX may represent the
first direct biochemical connection between ATRX and
the regulation of alpha-globin expression. Such a link has
been elusive despite the fact that clinical mutations of the
ATRX gene lead to a downregulation of alpha-globin
resulting in alpha-thalassaemia [31]. One possible scenario for alpha-globin regulation is a cascade that
involves CP2c activation of ATRX expression which
results in ATRX-mediated repression of a negative regulator of alpha-globin expression.
A recent study identified putative CP2 sites in the promoter of testis-determining factor, SRY, and showed that
CP2 activates transcription of the SRY through these
sites in a cell-based assay [30]. Binding of CP2 to the
SRY promoter was confirmed by ChIP analysis in the
human testis cell line, NT2/D1 [30]. Within the currently understood casade of genes involved in testicular
development, ATRX function lies downstream of SRY
and SOX9 ([51], A. Argentaro pers.comm). Thus, in the
context of testicular differentiation, CP2 may initiate the
pathway for testicular development via activation of SRY

Page 7 of 10

which eventually leads to ATRX expression. No putative
SRY binding sites were identified in our eutherian alignments suggesting SRY is not a direct regulator of ATRX
transcription.
The E2F family of TFs consists of 8 genes whose products bind to the same consensus sequence: TTTSSCGC
(reviewed by [52,53]). Mutational studies of putative E2F
binding sites suggest that E2F TFs can function both as
activators or repressors of transcription depending upon
the promoter context. This is because similar mutations
can result in upregulation or downregulation of a gene
depending on which gene promoter is being mutated
(reviewed by [54]). Interestingly, only a very small number
(~23%) of in vivo E2F sites actually contain the consensus
motif and an analysis of conforming and non-conforming
in vivo sites suggest that (i) a bona fide site must be in the
core promoter (+1 to -100) and (ii) the region must be utilised as a promoter in that cell type [55]. One of the two
E2F consensus motifs identified in this study (-1 to -6)
conforms to these conditions and thus may be a biologically active regulatory element within the ATRX promoter.
Members of the E2F family are implicated in a myriad
of functions including the regulation of mitosis, apoptosis, DNA repair, differentiation, development and
tumourigenesis, with no clear division of labour between
members [54]. These roles are very similar to that of the
SNF2 family of TFs of which ATRX is a member [16]
and recent studies indicate a role for ATRX in apoptosis
as inactivation of Atrx in mouse forebrain resulted in
p53-dependant apoptosis of neuroprogenitors in the
developing mouse [56]. In addition, E2F binding sites
have been identified in the promoters of many genes
intimately involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression [54] and ATRX could be one of these genes
since ATRX null mutations can affect cell-cycle progression and interfere with proper chromosome segregation
in both somatic and germ cells [41,57].

Conclusion
We identified twelve highly conserved TFBSs in the 5’
regulatory region and 5’ UTR of mammalian ATRX that
are likely candidates for regulating ATRX expression.
Future experiments involving DNA binding, mutational
analysis, ChIP and transactivation assays will verify
whether these sites are bona fide regulatory motifs.
Furthermore, the identification of ECRs in the ATRX
promoter region could provide a starting point for
experimental studies to define the minimal promoter of
ATRX. While a literature search did not reveal any idiopathic cases of ATR-X syndrome which are could be
attributable to mutations in the 5’ regulatory regions, an
understanding of how ATRX is regulated is an important
component of understanding its functions during development and other important biological processes.

BLAST searches of whole genome shotgun databases,
using human sequence corresponding to the 5’ regulatory
region of the ATRX gene (-13 kbp to +300 bp). Only species for which an ATRX orthologue was definitively identified and for which sufficient 5’ sequence was retrievable
were included in the generation of each results figure.
These belonged to human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus
musculus), dog (Canis familiaris), horse (Equus caballus),
elephant (Loxodonta africana), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) (Table 2).
Multiple sequence alignments were compiled using
Mulan in ‘TBA’ mode http://mulan.dcode.org/[59,60].
Candidate TFBSs within ECRs were identified using
multiTF [60][61] from the Mulan website, selecting the
TRANSFAC professional V10.2 TFBS database for vertebrates, with matrix similarity set at 0.85, 0.95 or 1.0, and
using only high-specificity matrices. The analysis was
performed on large regions of upstream genomic
sequences as well as on individual, short ECRs identified
from the initial alignments. Identification of TFBSs was
performed on alignments of two-to-several species from
diverse taxonomic groups and only those conserved in
at least two species are reported here. In addition, Map
Viewer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/[62] was
used to investigate the conservation of synteny around
the ATRX gene between species, Readseq http://wwwbimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/readseq/ was used to convert
sequences to FASTA format, and ClustalW2 http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[63] was used
as an additional sequence alignment tool.

data used to perform our analyses.
