Isolation, identification and complete genome
sequence analysis of a strain of foot-and-mouth
disease virus serotype Asia1 from pigs in
southwest of China

Abstract
Backgroud: Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype Asia1 generally infects cattle and sheep, while its
infection of pigs is rarely reported. In 2005-2007, FMD outbreaks caused by Asia1 type occurred in many regions of
China, as well as some parts of East Asia countries. During the outbreaks, there was not any report that pigs were
found to be clinically infected.
Results: In this study, a strain of FMDV that isolated from pigs was identified as serotype Asia1, and designated as
“Asia1/WHN/CHA/06”. To investigate the genomic feature of the strain, complete genome of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06
was sequenced and compared with sequences of other FMDVs by phylogenetic and recombination analysis. The
complete genome of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was 8161 nucleotides (nt) in length, and was closer to JS/CHA/05 than
to all other strains. Potential recombination events associated with Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 were found between JS/
CHA/05 and HNK/CHA/05 strains with partial 3B and 3C fragments.
Conclusion: This is the first report of the isolation and identification of a strain of FMDV type Asia1 from naturally
infected pigs. The Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 strain may evolve from the recombination of JS/CHA/05 and HNK/CHA/05
strains.

Background
Foot-and-mouth Disease is a highly contagious and economically important disease of cloven-hoofed animals,
predominantly for cattle, sheep, and pigs. The aetiological agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus, is classified as
small icosahedral virus of the Aphthovirus group within
the Picornaviridae family. There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes of the virus, namely types O, A,
C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3 and Asia1, and subtypes have
also been found within some serotypes [1].
FMD serotype Asia1 has been epidemic in China for
more than 50 years. This serotype usually infects cattle
and sheep, and its infection of pigs is seldom reported

[2]. In 2005-2007, FMD outbreaks caused by Asia1 type
occurred in many regions of China, as well as some
parts of East Asia countries. During the outbreaks, there
was not any report that pigs were found to be clinically
infected [2].
FMDV has a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 8.5 kb in length, including the 5’
untranslated region (5’UTR), a large singe open reading
frame (ORF), and the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR)
[3,4]. The 5’ UTR consists of a short (S) fragment, a
poly (C) tract, and a long fragment (5’LF-UTR), which
contains three or four tandemly repeated pseudoknots
(PKs) and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [5].
The ORF encodes a polyprotein that can be cleaved to
form four structural proteins (VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1)
and 8 non-structural proteins (L, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C
and 3D) [5]. The VP1 protein plays an important role in
virus attachment, protective immunity and serotype specificity, and nucleotide sequencing of this region has

been extensively used for molecular epidemiology studies on FMD [6,7]. The G-H loop of the VP1 protein of
FMDV spanning residues 134-158 contains conserved
Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide, which is considered to
be a ligand for cell-surface attachment [8]. In addition,
FMDV 3A region has been implicated in virus virulence
and host range, similar to the 3A proteins of other
picornaviruses [9]. The 3’UTR of about 90 residues with
a poly (A) tail (35-100nt) at 3’-end is likely to be a site
of interaction with viral and host proteins for RNA
replication [10,11].
This study, for the first time to our knowledge,
described the isolation and identification of a strain of
FMDV type Asia1 from pigs in China. To investigate
the genomic feature of the strain and further understand
its role in epidemiology of FMDV, the complete genome
of the strain was sequenced and compared with
sequences of other strains of FMDV Asia1 by phylogenetic and recombination analysis.

RNA extraction and RT-PCR

The RNA was extracted from the infected cell culture
supernatant by using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The cDNA
synthesis was carried out using Random primer9 and
Oligo (dT)18 , and Superscript П reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen). The cDNA fragments were amplified by
PCR (Biorad) using LA Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa,
Japan a) and seven pairs of primers (Table 1). The
5’RACE was performed using 5’-full RACE kit (TaKaRa,
Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cDNA fragment at the 3’ UTR was amplified by the
3’rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3’-RACE) method.
The PCR parameters included an initial denaturation at
94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 50 s, annealing 58°C for 50 s, and extension
at 72°C for 1-3 min depending on the sizes of the products and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The 5 μl
PCR products were electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose
gel containing ethidium bromide, and visualized under
UV light.

Materials and methods
Sample collection and clinical samples treatment

Genome sequencing

Three samples of ruptured vesicular fluids were collected from FMD-suspected pigs in a pig farm in southwest of China in 2006. The samples were transported
from the collection site to diagnostic laboratory in 0.04
M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 50% glycerol at 4°C
and stored at -20°C until tested.

The target fragment of PCR products were purified
using Gel Extraction Kit (OMEGA bio-tek). The purified
products were ligated to pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa,
Japan) and transfected into E. coli JM109. The positive
clones were selected to provide for sequencing by
Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and
Services Co., Ltd. Each nucleotide was determined from

Virus isolation and identification

Established cell layer of BHK-21 cells were inoculated
with 0.2 ml the three samples of vesicular fluids, respectively. The cell cultures would be examined for Cytopathic effects (CPE) for 48 hours. If CPE was formed,
the cells would be collected for subsequent experiments.
If no CPE was detected, the cells would be frozen
and thawed, and used to inoculate fresh cultures of 0.2
ml and examined for CPE for another 48 hours. The
infected BHK-21 monolayer cells were subjected to
three freeze-thaw cycles to release the viral particles.
The viral suspension was clarified from the cell debris
by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min and stored at
-70°C for the following experiments.
The FMDV O, Asia1 and A type positive serums were
chosen as antiserum in complement fixation test (CFT).
The CFT was performed by adding 0.2 ml virus sample,
each of the 3 type of antiserum and complement in
tubes, respectively. After incubating the mixtures at 37°
C for 1.5 h, sensitized sheep erythrocytes was added to
each tube, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at
37°C. Degrees of hemolysis were determined by visual
reading. The tests were set up in triplicate. Also, virus
sample, antisera, complement, and erythrocytes controls
were set up with each test.

three identical results. Sequences were assembled into
complete genome sequence using SeqMan || program of
DNAstar software package (DNAstar Inc., USA)

substitution model. The bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data.
Putative recombination analysis

Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis

Ten complete genome and thirty-three VP1 gene
sequences of FMDV Asia1 type isolates of bovine origin
and three FMDV O type (as out group) from GenBank
were involved in the analysis (Table 2). Multiple
sequence comparisons at the nucleotide and the amino
acid level were performed by MegAlign program of
DNASTAR package. The phylogenetic tree based on
VP1 sequences was constructed by using the program
MEGA 4.0 [12] with Kimura 2-parameter nucleotide

The complete genome sequences based on the multiple
alignment result were used for recombination analysis
with the SimPlot program version 3.5.1[13]. Similarity
plot were built using Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 as the query
sequence against the complete genomic sequences of 8
strains of serotype Asia1. To further investigate the
potential recombination event, the Recombination
Detection Program (RDP) [14], GENECONV [15],
BOOTSCAN [16], and MaxChi [17] methods were carried to employ Recombination Detection Program

3 (RDP3) [18] software. Statistical significance was set at
the P = 0.05 level. Each analysis was conducted twice to
ensure repeatability of results.

Results
Virus isolation and identification

Virus from one sample was adapted to BHK-21 cells
and CPE occurred when inoculated fresh cultures first
time after 24 hours, but the other two didn’t show any
CPE by blind passage 5 times. Therefore, one strain of
virus was isolated, and the first passage of the strain in
BHK cells was used for following experiments. For complement fixation test, hemolysis occurred in the mixtures containing FMDV O and A type positive serums,
whereas the mixtures containing FMDV Asia1 type positive serums didn’t show any virtual change. Thus, the
isolate was identified as FMDV of serotype Asia1, and
was designated as Asia1/WHN/CHA/06.
RT-PCR and complete genome of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06

In order to determine the full-length genome sequence of
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 strain, the seven RT-PCR cDNA
amplicons covering the entire RNA genome were cloned
and each nucleotide was determined from three identical
results. The genome sequence was submitted to GenBank
with the accession number of FJ906802. The complete
genome sequence of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, excluding
poly(C) and poly(A) tail, is 8161 nt in length, containing
an ORF, a 5’ UTR, and a 3’ UTR. ORF is 6990 nt (encoding 2329 aa)in length, which consists of L (603 nt), P1
(2199 nt), P2 (1464 nt), and P3 (2724 nt) genes. P1 protein is predicted to be cleaved into four structural proteins, including VP4 (85 aa), VP2 (219 aa), VP3 (218 aa),
and VP1 (211 aa). There are three non-structural proteins in P2, including 2A (16 aa), 2B (154 aa), and 2C
(318 aa). P3 protein contains 3A (153 aa), 3B (71 aa), 3C
(213 aa), and 3D (471 aa) four proteins. The 5’ UTR consists of S, FUR, and IRES structures, which is 366, 258,
and 454 nt in length, respectively. The 3’ UTR of Asia1/
WHN/CHA/06 was 93 nt in length, followed by a 66 bp
poly (A) tail at least.
Sequence analysis

Nucleotide and amino acid identity of different regions
of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 genome were compared with
other six FMDV Asia1 strains (Table 3). Asia1/WHN/
CHA/06 genome exhibited identities ranging from 90.2
to 98.5%, and the highest similarity with JS/CHA/05
with identity rate of 98.5%.
The ORF of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was 89.6 - 98.5%
identical with the six reference sequences at the nucleotide level with no deletion or insertion. Compared with
40 sequences of VP1 genes, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 exhibited identities ranging from 81.0 to 99.2% (data not

shown). By comparing the 40 amino acid sequences of
G-H loop region in VP1 protein, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06
got highly consistency with the stains isolated after the
year of 2004, and no mutation was observed in RGD tripeptide. Interestingly, RGD mutants (RGD®HGD) were
examined in Asia1/3kimron/61 and KRG/2/04. For bordering region of RGD of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, there
was no amino acids’ mutation at RGD +1 and +4 sides,
but a mutation at the RGD +9 (N®D). The 3A gene of
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 strain was 459 nt without insertions and deletions at this region. However, three amino
acids’ mutations occurred at the residues 86 (D®N), 93
(I®N), and 131 (H®R). Interestingly, Asia1/WHN/
CHA/06 displayed the highest nucleotide similarity with
JS/CHA/05 at all the regions except 3B gene (93.4%),
whereas it showed the highest similarity (97.7%) with
HNK/CHA/05 at 3B gene.
The 5’ UTR of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 shared 96.8% identity with the JS/CHA/05 strain, whereas it showed only
84.4-86.7% identity with other 5 reference strains. For the
S fragment of 5’UTR, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 displayed 3
nucleotide deletions located at nt 72, 74, and 184. The
712-nt of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 of 5’ LF-UTRs was
observed, whereas within other reference strains, the
length of 5’ LF-UTRs ranged from 690 nts to 714 nts.
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 strain showed four PKs structure in
5’ LF-UTR, which was the same as other reference isolates,
and no nucleotide deletion was observed. For the IRES
fragment of 5’ UTR, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was more
genetic conservative than that of S fragment, displaying
86.8-99.3% homology to other Asia1 type isolates, and
only found to be 2 nucleotide deletions. The sequence
comparison of the 3’ UTR regions showed that Asia1/
WHN/CHA/06 exhibited 74.2-87.1% homology to other
six Asia1 type isolates, indicating a relatively higher level
of genetic variation within the 3’ UTR than the 5’UTR.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the
sequence alignment of VP1 gene of 39 FMDV strains. In
the phylogenetic tree, FMDV Asia1 type strains were distributed into three different groups (Figure 1). Group1 fell
into two distinct groups (1a and 1b). Asia1/WHN/CHA/
06 was distributed into group1a with India/80, India/81,
and other 10 isolates during 2005-2007 from East Asia.
Group 1b was made up of YNBS/58 and ZB/CHA/58,
which were both isolated from China in 1958. Group2
contained the isolates from India, Central Asia, and Hong
Kong in 1983-2005. And group3 was exclusively formed
by Southeast Asia strains from 1980 to 2006.
Recombination analysis

In the similarity plot, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was shown
to be closer to JS/CHA/05 than the other 8 strains.

However, there were two narrow zones displaying disproportionately low levels of similarity between the two
strains compared to the other regions (Figure 2). Moreover, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was shown to have a higher
similarity to HNK/CHA/05 than JS/CHA/05 within the
right narrow zone (corresponding to 3B/3C), which suggested that there was a possible recombination event in
this region. And it was shown that the major parent was
JS/CHA/05, and the minor parent was HNK/CHA/05.
In the analysis by RDP program, the segment corresponding to 3B/3C region was defined as a crossover
region (Figure 3, 4), which indicated that JS/CHA/05
and HNK/CHA/05 were possible mosaics with Asia1/
WHN/CHA/06. And the estimated recombination
breakpoint was at the position 5805-6073.

3. Disscusion
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was isolated from pigs in a pig
farm in 2006. According to the investigation of the pig
farm during the outbreak, about 20% of sows presented
typical clinical symptoms of FMD, whereas none of the
piglets and boars showed any symptoms and no pigs
died. The FMD in the pig farm lasted for about one
month. Moreover, there were not any reports about outbreak of FMD in other pig farms around the area at that
time. Therefore, we speculated that Asia1/WHN/CHA/

06 had low pathogenicity or infectivity to pigs, though
high lethality of the strain to sulking mouth was
observed in this study. But further study should be carried out to test the virulence of the strain to pigs to
approve the inference.
The complete genome sequence of Asia1/WHN/CHA/
06 was determined, except Poly(C) tract. Poly(C) tract of
FMDV is usually ranging from 100 to 420 cytosine residues interspersed with an occasional uracil residue [19],
so it is difficult to amplify the true sequence of the tract
by RT-PCR from the viral RNA genome [20]. In this
study, we didn’t manage to get the poly(C) tract
sequence of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 either. Pseudoknots
(PKs) have been found to be 3-4 tandem repeats of
RNA secondary structure in FMDV genome, which
probably had some role during viral replication [21].
Additionally, it is reported that partial deletions of
FMDV strains in PKs’ region correlated with the host
range [22]. However, no deletions occurred in PKs’
region of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06. In sequence of VP1
protein, the RGD motif is the molecular basis of binding
of FMDV to its cellular receptor [23]. Although the
RGD bordering region sequence of Asia1/WHN/CHA/
06 is highly consistent with the reference strains isolated
after the year of 2004, an amino acids’ position at RGD
+9 mutated (N®D). As several lines of evidence show

that the vicinity of the RGD motif, including RGD +1
(leucine) and +4 (leucine) positions, are necessary for
the FMDV RGD-mediated receptor recognition [24,25],
it is unclear whether the variation at RGD +9 site influence the receptor recognition of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06.
Although non-structural proteins which play important

roles for viral propagation are generally more conserved
than the structural proteins, 3A is one of the most variable proteins of FMDV [11]. In addition, deletions in 3A
have been shown to associate with FMDV attenuation
in cattle and high virulence for pigs [21]. Meanwhile, a
single amino acid mutation at position 44 in the 3A

protein is present in guinea pig-adapted isolates examined [26]. In our study, we found no deletion but 3
amino acid substitutions in the 3A region of Asia1/
WHN/CHA/06. Considering that the isolate isolated
from a pig, while other FMDV Asia1 type isolates came
from cattle, it would be interesting to examine by
reverse genetics if the 3 amino acid substitutions may
contribute to adaptation of host range.
From a practical point of view, it is important to analyze the nucleotide sequence of the virus from new
hosts for subsequent comparison with other isolates to
trace the origin and route of the viral spread. To date,
there are over 40 complete genome sequences for
FMDV Asia1 isolated from cattle available in Genbank,

but no data are available on pigs. The present study
reported that the complete nucleotide sequence of
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was isolated from pigs in southwest of China in 2006. In general, the complete genome
sequence of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 exhibited a high level
of similarity with JS/CHA/05 strain, which indicated
that Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 had a close genetic relationship with JS/CHA/05 strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the
virus VP1 region of FMDV has been used extensively to
investigate the molecular epidemiology of the disease
worldwide [27]. In this study, phylogenetic tree based
on VP1 region of Asia1 isolates identified the existence
of three groups. Group1a mainly consisted of 11 isolates, which collected in East Asia (China, East of Russia,

East of Mongolia, and North Korea) during 2005-2007.
However, India/80 and India/81, which were both collected from India in 1980s, also clustered with Group1a.
These data suggest that the East Asia strains, including
Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, have a close genetic relationship
with the two India strains emerged two decades ago.
Recombination plays an important role in FMDV evolution [28,29]. In this study, supported by Simplot and
RDP program, Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was found to be a
mosaic between JS/CHA/05 and HNK/CHA/05, whose
breakpoint encompassed partial 3B and 3C genes. Protein 3B, which is present in three similar but nonidentical copies (3B1, 3B2 and 3B3) in FMDV [30], functions
in priming picornavirus RNA synthesis [31], and the 3C
protease is responsible for most of the cleavages during
the FMDV polyprotein processing [32]. Recombination
in FMDV occurs mainly in non-structural genes [33],
but the recombination over 3B/3C gene boundaries
appears to be less frequent [34]. Thus, the role of the
mosaicism observed in 3B/3C of FMDV should be targeted for further study. Moreover, JS/CHA/05 and
HNK/CHA/05 strains were both isolated from the east
of China in 2005, so there was a geographical opportunity for the recombination of the two strains. However,
as Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was isolated from west of
China, it was possible that Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 was
transmitted from east of China by introduction of pigs
or other transmission routes.

Conclusion
Here we reported, for the first time to our knowledge,
the isolation and identification of a strain of FMDV
type Asia1 from naturally infected pigs, and described
the features of the genome of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06.
Sequence analysis showed that it was belonged to

East Asian strains, and had a close genetic relationship to JS/CHA/05. Besides, potential recombination
events associated with Asia1/WHN/CHA/06 were
found between JS/CHA/05 and HNK/CHA/05 strains
with partial 3B and 3C fragments, which may trace
the origin and evolution of Asia1/WHN/CHA/06
strain.
