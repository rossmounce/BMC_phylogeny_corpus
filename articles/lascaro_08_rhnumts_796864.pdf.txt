Abstract
Background: To a greater or lesser extent, eukaryotic nuclear genomes contain fragments of
their mitochondrial genome counterpart, deriving from the random insertion of damaged mtDNA
fragments. NumtS (Nuclear mt Sequences) are not equally abundant in all species, and are
redundant and polymorphic in terms of copy number. In population and clinical genetics, it is
important to have a complete overview of NumtS quantity and location. Searching PubMed for
NumtS or Mitochondrial pseudo-genes yields hundreds of papers reporting Human NumtS
compilations produced by in silico or wet-lab approaches. A comparison of published compilations
clearly shows significant discrepancies among data, due both to unwise application of Bioinformatics
methods and to a not yet correctly assembled nuclear genome. To optimize quantification and
location of NumtS, we produced a consensus compilation of Human NumtS by applying various
bioinformatics approaches.
Results: Location and quantification of NumtS may be achieved by applying database similarity
searching methods: we have applied various methods such as Blastn, MegaBlast and BLAT, changing
both parameters and database; the results were compared, further analysed and checked against
the already published compilations, thus producing the Reference Human Numt Sequences
(RHNumtS) compilation. The resulting NumtS total 190.
Conclusion: The RHNumtS compilation represents a highly reliable reference basis, which may
allow designing a lab protocol to test the actual existence of each NumtS. Here we report
preliminary results based on PCR amplification and sequencing on 41 NumtS selected from
RHNumtS among those with lower score. In parallel, we are currently designing the RHNumtS
database structure for implementation in the HmtDB resource. In the future, the same database
will host NumtS compilations from other organisms, but these will be generated only when the
nuclear genome of a specific organism has reached a high-quality level of assembly.

Background
In greater or lesser abundance, eukaryotic nuclear
genomes contain fragments of their mitochondrial (mt)
genome counterpart, deriving from "random" insertion of
damaged mtDNA fragments [1]. The discovery of these
genomic "elements" dates back to 1967, when du Buy and
Riley [2] discovered mtDNA sequences in the nuclear
genome by means of hybridization experiments on
mouse liver. The presence of mtDNA in the nuclear
genome was confirmed in 1983, in yeast, locust, fungi, sea
urchin, man, maize and rat [3-9]. In 1994 Lopez et al. [10]
called these fragments numt, in this paper renamed
NumtS, Nuclear mt Sequences. One hypothesis on the
mechanism of their generation suggests that fragments of
mtDNA may escape from mitochondria to avoid mutagenic agents or other forms of cellular stress, reach the
nucleus and, during repair of chromosomal breaks, insert
into the nuclear DNA [11]. Papers published so far report
that NumtS loci do not show a common feature at integration sites [12]. The NumtS generation process may have
started soon after endosymbiosis. It seems obvious that
the genomic region where the mt sequence is inserted may
be involved in further recombination events, thus generating duplication of the mt fragment. In some organisms,
such as primates, the same mt region occurs several times
along the nuclear genome, but only detailed evolutionary
analysis may help in identifying "duplicated" NumtS,
because recombination and mutation occurring after
duplication may well mask the latter event. Once this
problem is solved, each NumtS may be associated with a
given copy number, although this may differ even among
tissues or cells of the same individual. NumtS have been
shown in fact to be polymorphic: a specific NumtS may be
present in heterozygosis in the same individual or may be
totally absent in a specific tissue or individual. The first
evidence of the polymorphic nature of NumtS was
reported by Zischler et al. [13], in which an insert of 540
bp (reverse positions (59–16089) of the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [14]), located on chromosome 11 and detected on total DNA extracted from
sperm, was screened in various populations using primers
designed on the sequences flanking the insertion. Among
the screened individuals, some were homozygous, some
were heterozygous and some did not show the insertion.
When present, the inserted sequence was highly conserved in all populations, thus revealing a "nuclear fossil".
The inserted sequence with its nuclear flanking region is
available through GenBank entry S80333 but, when this
sequence is blasted against Human nuclear genome Build
36.2, the resulting hit matches only the flanking region.
This means that the samples used for sequencing the
Human Genome did not harbour the "insertion". Further
examples of polymorphic NumtS are reported in "The
case of siblings" [15] and the Ricchetti compilation [16].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/267

NumtS are not equally abundant in all species. For
instance a much higher number of NumtS occurs in plants
with respect to Metazoa. Within Metazoan, NumtS are
more abundant in mammals and birds, but a very small
number can be found in Plasmodium, Caenorhabditis and
Drosophila. The debate about the presence or absence of
NumtS in fugu is open [17,18]. The great abundance of
NumtS in Apis mellifera, comparable to that in plants, has
been published recently [19]. A complete knowledge of
Human NumtS is of fundamental importance in the study
of human population migrations, which utilize mtDNA
as a phylogenetic marker, and also in the study of mitochondrial diseases. NumtS are in fact a potential source of
contamination when PCR is used to study mtDNA. This is
particularly important in the case of ancient DNA or tissue
with a reduced quantity of mtDNA copy number, in both
physiological (sperm) and pathological states [20,21].
Bensasson et al. [1] presented an exhaustive vademecum
suggesting how to check and avoid NumtS contamination. A final consideration concerns the observation that
since NumtS reside in the nucleus, they should evolve
much more slowly than their functional counterparts in
the nucleus, so that they represent nuclear fossils, "snapshots" of mtDNA at the time of transfer. This allows them
to be used as outgroups in phylogenetic studies [22-25].
Searching PubMed for NumtS or Mitochondrial pseudogenes in November 2006 yielded hundreds of papers, 113
of which on humans. Many of them report the compilation of Human NumtS and other Eukaryotic Genomes
[1,16,23,26-31], and usually mention the location and
length of each NumtS. Such data were mainly obtained by
in silico approaches and only a minority derived from a
wet-lab approach, sequencing or nDNA-mtDNA hybridizations [32,16]. Parr et al. [32] demonstrated by sequencing that the entire mitochondrial genome is present
within the nuclear genome in multiple copies: the
"pseudo-mitochondrial genome". A comparison of published compilations highlights great discrepancies among
data (Figure 1). The reason for this lies in two important
facts: incautious usage of Bioinformatics methods and
application of methods to a still not yet correctly assembled nuclear genome. However, the trends common to all
papers are that the number of NumtS varies among species and that the human genome apparently contains the
highest number of NumtS within Metazoan. But the data
are still incomplete and imperfect. NumtS quantification
needs revision, particularly starting from Human data.
The present paper, describing the bioinformatics
approaches used to optimize quantification and localization of NumtS, reports the Consensus Reference Human
NumtS Compilation (RHNumtS) and the results of the
amplification and sequencing approach applied to 41
selected NumtS

Results
The location and quantification of NumtS may be
achieved by applying database similarity searching methods, comparing the human mt DNA sequence with
human nuclear genome sequences. The goal of database
similarity searching methods is to seek for regions showing statistically meaningful similarity, but these methods
are too sensitive: slight changes in parameters and/or in
both query and database sequences may give rise to considerable changes in the resulting hits. In this study the
available human mt DNA sequences total at present more
than 3000, of which about 90% represent different haplotypes, thus choosing the query sequence is the first problem. Moreover available human nuclear genome
sequences are consensus sequences, obtained from the
DNA of five different individuals, and suffer from physiological assembly limits, due to great repetition in the
genome. This means that there are slight differences
which may lead to poorly reproducible results, due to
mitochondrial polymorphic sites and to a still not com-

pletely defined nuclear genome. Thus, changing methods
or parameters or applying the method to different human
genome sequence collections produce diverse results.
Here, we suggest the usage of different approaches and the
comparison of the obtained results, in order to minimize
both false positive and negative results with the aim to
optimize quantification and localization of human
NumtS. Our overall proposal is to apply several bioinformatics approaches, to compare the results, to produce a
consensus compilation and then validate the results
through PCR and sequencing analysis. This last step is not
the primary scope of this work although we report some
preliminary results. Available bioinformatics programs
for this type of analysis are BLAST, BLAT and FASTA. We
used only BLAST [33,34] and BLAT [35], the performance
of which better suited our needs. BLAST is implemented
in many versions, Blastn, Blastx, tBLastn, MegaBlast, etc.
We used Blastn and MegaBlast, the versions most frequently adopted in reports on human NumtS compilation.
Blastn results
Tables 1 and 2 summarise the results obtained with
Blastn, searching the revised Reference Cambridge
Sequence [14] (J01415.2) similarity versus various
human nucleotide sequence datasets by changing limits
by Entrez and limits on number of positive hits to be displayed (see Methods section). The data in the tables
clearly show how easy it is to obtain false positive or negative hits. Among the various results, we chose the one
producing 2145 hits, comparing the J01415.2 sequence
against the Chromosome Genome database with the Entrez limit "homo sapiens [ORGN] NOT (mitochondrion
OR mitochondrial) [ALL]" since in this case hits on the
mitochondrial genome were not obtained (query #19 in
Table 2). The data shown here were produced in March
2007, when the old version of Blast was available. At
present, some of the Blast options we used are no longer
available.
MegaBlast results
We used MegaBlast to compare the J01415.2 Human mt
sequence against the last assembled Human genome data-

base and Human Genome Reference sequence sets (Build
36.2, January 2007): when the E threshold was set at
0.001, the resulting hits were 288 and 186 respectively.
BLAT results
We applied the BLAT program by submitting the J01415.2
Human mt sequence to the four available Human Builds,
obtaining 118, 122, 124 and 117 hits for the hg15, hg16,
hg17 and hg18 human genome assemblies. In parallel, we
applied the same runs with the NC_001807.4 human mt
genome, reported by NCBI as the reference human mt
genome sequence. There are 22 differences between these
two genomes, which cause differing results (data not
shown). This is a further explanation of the differing
results obtained in published compilations in which different query sequences were used.
The RHNumtS compilation production
Comparisons of our results with the published ones
allowed us to produce the RHNumtS compilation. The
resulting NumtS total 190. Each NumtS in the compilation refers to an mtDNA fragment; thus, if 2 mtDNA
regions are contiguous on nuclear DNA, they are considered as two distinct NumtS. This is the case, for example,
of the repeated NumtSs 41–54 that was here validated
experimentally (see Figure 2a). Table 3 reports RHNumtS
data for NumtS whose mt fragment length is greater than
2000 bp. The complete compilation is available in Additional file 1. The rationale used to produce the compila-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/267

tion is described here. The reference results are those
obtained through BlastN (code 19 in Table 2). Hits less
than 2000 nucleotides from each other, on both nuclear
and mt genomes were merged. The results were compared
with those from Megablast [Human Genome all assemblies (Build 36.2, January 2007)] and BLAT (Assembling
hg18): the more reproducible the results obtained with
the various methods, the higher the probability that
NumtS exists in the Human Genome. Each NumtS in
RHNumtS is identified by a numeric code (RHNumtS
identifier); only three were identified by a letter. To each
NumtS we associated: chromosome and strand location,
both mt and nuclear coordinates of the NumtS ("mt start"
and "mt end", "chr start" and "chr end"); mitochondrial
and nuclear fragment lengths and differences between
mitochondrial and nuclear fragment lengths; the longer
the NumtS, the higher the number of gaps within the
NumtS, thus indicating that it likely underwent several
modifications since the time of its insertion in the nuclear
genome. Additional file 2 reports the comparison of
Blastn obtained data vs BLAT and Megablast results. Of
the 190 NumtS available through RHNumtS, 122 (64%)
were matched with both Blastn and BLAT, 60 (32%) with
Blastn only and eight (4%) with Blastn, but located on the
Celera assembly instead of the public Human Genome
consortium. The compilation was compared with some
published compilations. For each NumtS, Additional file
3 lists its presence (OK) or absence (-) in some of the published compilations. Question marks (?) indicate ambig-

sample only. Primers were designed with PRIMER3 software, testing the amplification of the full NumtS (external-external
primers) or part of it (external-internal primers or internal-internal primers). In NumtS 41–54, samples H2b and L2a1c1 have
shorter amplicons, due to a lower number of repetitions. Triple band in NUMTS 12 was due to aspecific amplification, subsequently reduced by increasing stringency of primers annealing. Abbreviations: ext for external, int for internal; the number

uous cases. With respect to the Parr compilation [32], the
sequenced NumtS are all present in RHNumtS; this validates our results, although some sequenced NumtS could
not be present in our compilation, due to their polymorphic features. The same applies to the two NumtS
sequenced by Collura [37], located on chromosome 7. In
order to quantify the strength of our approach, RHNumtS
quality scores were assigned to each NumtS for each program applied and for each match with the selected published compilations, according to defined criteria: 0.25 or
0.50 for an ambiguous or perfect match with each of the
selected published compilations [16,23,26,28], 2.00 for
matches with Parr and Collura sequenced NumtS, 0.25 for

ambiguous matches with Megablast hits, 1.00 for perfect
matches with MegaBlast and BLAT hits, and 0.75 for
NumtS not directly identified by BLAT. Score values range
from 6 to 0.25. The last column of Additional file 1 and
Table 3 lists the total score for each NumtS. NumtS with
scores higher than 3 (16.3% of the total Reference Human
NumtS compilation) are highlighted. Perfect matches
with published compilations are at most 12%: this is the
case of the comparison with the Wallace compilation
[26].

Each NumtS was assigned an identifying numeric code, according to increasing values starting from chromosome 1; a letter code (A, B, or C) was
assigned to only 3 NumtS, because they were located later, when all other NumtS had already been characterised. Chromosome and strand
location is listed for each NumtS; both mt and nuclear coordinates of NumtS ("mt start" and "mt end", "chr start" and "chr end"); mitochondrial and
nuclear fragment lengths; "difference" between mitochondrial and nuclear fragment lengths; and RHNumtS quality score are also reported.
Additional file 1 reports the complete RHNumtS compilation: there, NumtS exclusively identified by Blastn are shown in grey and NumtS
exclusively identified by Blastn, but only on Human Genome Celera Assembly, shown in black in columns "Nuc start" and "Nuc end"; repeated
NumtS in bold type and underlined in columns "Mt start" and "Mt end". NumtS with scores higher than 3 are shown in grey in column "score".

Human NumtS Sequencing
The assigned scores are theoretical indicators of the quality of our prediction, but experimental validation of the
predicted RHNumtS compilation is definitely a must and
this is our goal in the immediate future. Starting from the
RHNumtS compilation, we propose to test the real presence of each NumtS in a set of different healthy subjects
belonging to different geographic areas and various haplogroups, in order to verify if the NUMTS presence/
absence may be different in various phylogenetic lineages.
Experimental validation will be based on the amplification and sequencing of the NumtS. This requires a great
effort in terms of manpower and funds. However such
project is currently ongoing and here we report only preliminary results obtained for 41 of the 190 NumtS,
selected among the NumtS with lower scores. Indeed, the
lower the score, the higher the probability that the NumtS
is a false positive. Table 4 reports the list of the analyzed
NumtS with information about samples where amplification and sequencing has been successful. Figure 2 reports
the PCR amplification of (a) 27 of the selected NumtS in
4 healthy subjects from different ethnic groups and (b) 14
NumtS in a European sample. With respect to NumtS 41–
54, the H2b and L2a1c1 samples have shorter amplicons,
due to the presence of a lower number of repeats, as confirmed in the multi-alignment (Additional file 4).

The 122 NumtS sequence of the Latin American sample
and the European sample of NumtS 170, 178 and 187
were not obtained. For NumtS 87, 122 and 41–54 Additional file 4 reports the nucleotide multi-alignment of the
amplified and sequenced NumtS in the samples from the
4 different haplogroups, compared with the NumtS
sequence as extracted from the Human Genome build
36.2 through the UCSC genome browser (hg18 release),
and the sequences of the corresponding mitochondrial
region for the same samples. As it appears from the multialignment there is a high conservation of the NumtS
among the different subjects, although heterozygous sites
can be observed (nucleotide ambiguity letter such as Y for

C/T, R for A/G, etc.). NumtS sites reporting ambiguous
nucleotides do in fact refer to sites where two alleles are
evidenced in the sequence. The comparison of NumtS
sequence with the corresponding mtDNA also clearly
shows divergence among them. Additional file 5 reports
the multialignments of the other 21 NumtS whose
sequences have been so far produced for the European
sample only. The NumtS sequence is aligned with the
hg18 and mitochondrial corresponding sequences.
NumtS features
The resulting compilation was further analyzed, in order
to qualify and quantify the process of transfer of Human
mtDNA into the nuclear genome.
NumtS distribution along the genome
Chromosome 2 hosts the largest amount of NumtS,
whereas chromosomes 19 and 22 do not show to harbour
NumtS although, due to their polymorphic features, some
individuals may present them on the latter chromosomes.
Generally speaking, the longer the chromosome, the
greater the chance of locating NumtS, partly because, as
reported below, selection operates in the direction of
avoiding NumtS inside genes, so that shorter chromosomes with a higher density of genes are less prone to
hosting NumtS. In addition, with respect to the chromosome region where NumtS are located, no preference
between euchromatin or etherochromatin regions has
been observed. However, for each NumtS chromosome
band, Additional file 6 lists information contributing to
an overview about where NumtS are integrated.
NumtS dimensions
For each NumtS Additional file 1 also lists the mt and
chromosomal fragment lengths, besides the mt and
nuclear coordinates. These values do not coincide since,
after insertion, NumtS undergo rearrangements such as
deletions, insertions, and single nucleotide substitutions.
The older the NumtS, the greater the difference between
mitochondrial and chromosomal fragments (see differ-

For each of the 41 analysed NumtS, the mt haplogroup code of the sample, if amplified and if sequenced, is reported. NumtS 170, 179 and 187 in
the H2b sample and 122 in the I3a sample have not been sequenced because primers were not optimal for sequencing.

ence column in Table 3 and additional file 1). The longest
mt fragment located on the nuclear genome is NumtS no.
81, 14654 mt bp, located on chromosome 4 and highly
compacted: the 81 NumtS chromosomal fragment is in
fact 14587 bp long. The shortest NumtS is 45 bp long.
More than 30% of NumtS derive from mt fragments
longer than 2000 mt bp (Table 3). NumtS chromosomal
fragment length is listed in Additional File 6: the longest
one is NumtS 120, 18604 chromosomal BP, containing a
mt fragment 12281 bp long, located on chromosome 9,
with an RHNumtS score of 1.5. NumtS 103, 12053 bp
long and derived from an mt fragment of 12106 nucle-

otides, located on chromosome 7, received a score of 6,
because it was entirely sequenced from both Parr [32] and
Collura [35].
Estimation of similarity
Although Blastn, Megablast and BLAT provide scores and
percentages of identity, the values are approximate for
each hit, due to the heuristic algorithms implemented in
these programs. We thus further analysed each NumtS by
applying both the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm for
global alignment and the Waterman and Smith algorithm
for local ones. Additional file 7 shows alignment scores

Page 8 of 13

compared with BLAT scores. The highest score is that of
NumtS 81, which contains the longest mt fragment. Half
of the NumtS have similarity values between 99% and
80%, thus showing a high degree of conservation from the
time of their insertion in the nucleus.

made. Certainly, the higher the number of locus copies in
the nuclear genome, the higher the risk of co-amplification of mt-nuclear DNA, in any study on mtDNA variations.

Conclusions
NumtS in nuclear genes
Once the NumtS had been located through the UCSC
Genome Browser [38] and NCBI Map viewer [39], we
checked their location in nuclear genes. For NumtS
located in genomic regions coding for genes, Additional
file 6 lists both the gene name and the region of the gene
where the NumtS are mapped. There are 16 NumtS inside
genes; they are always located inside introns, and only two
(13 and 88) are located in 5'UTR regions.
NumtS and isochores
Isochores are large DNA segments (> 300 kb on average)
characterized by an internal variation in GC well below
the full variation observed in the mammalian genome
[40]. The previous definition of human isochores, based
on ultracentrifugation in Cs2SO4 density gradients, has
recently been revised by simply scanning the GC% content along the entire genome, and the five isochore families L1, L2, H1, H2 and H3, were defined according to GC
content, values increasing from L1 to H3. We mapped the
NumtS on isochores according to the data published in
[41]. Results are listed in Additional file 6. Only 9% of
total NumtS in RHNumtS were not located within isochores; 5% maps with the highest GC dense isochores
(H2, H3); 30% on isochore H1, and 33% and 23% on isochores L2 and L1, respectively. Thus, NumtS prefer locations with low GC contents, corresponding to poor genecontaining regions. Indeed, the presence of a NumtS
inside a gene may cause loss of function, so selection may
act to clean out the genome from disrupting NumtS insertion events. This is also confirmed by the fact that, when
NumtS are located in a gene, the gene region is always an
intron and in some rare cases a UTR.
Mapping of Human NumtS along Human mt genome
As already reported by Parr et al. [32], human NumtS are
made up of mt fragments covering the entire human mt
genome, "the pseudo-mitochondrial human genome".
For each human mt gene, Figure 3 shows the RHNumtS
identifiers containing it: all mt regions are present in the
NumtS, but the number of NumtS containing any mt gene
is highly variable. Moreover, not all NumtS contain an mt
gene entirely, because the locus may be located partially at
the 5' and 3' ends of the NumtS or because it may have
been truncated after insertion by rearrangement events.
The mt genes most frequently present in the "pseudohuman mt-genome" are the two ribosomal RNAs, ND5
and COI genes; the least represented is the D-loop region.
At present, no explanation for such preferences can be

The RHNumtS compilation proposed here results from
the application of several bioinformatics approaches and
from comparisons of resulting data with previously published Human NumtS compilations. It thus represents a
highly reliable reference basis on which to start designing
a lab protocol to test the truthfulness of each NumtS. Two
experimental procedures are proposed: nDNA-mtDNA
hybridisation, as already done with the Canis familiaris
genome [42], or by amplifying and sequencing NumtS
themselves. The latter approach, here adopted to validate
25% of the NumtS whose score in our compilation is
lower than 3, confirms the quality of our bioinformatics
approach; however, a systematic and complete experimental validation will be designed. In parallel, we are
already designing the RHNumtS database structure for
implementation in the HmtDB resource [43]. This database will report the NumtS sequences annotated with the
attributes derived from both in silico and in vitro analyses.
This work will be important because until now no database concerning NumtS has ever been published, so that
we will be able to offer an updated reference for consultation on-line to the scientific community interested in
analysis of foreign DNA integration. In the future, the
same database will host NumtS compilations from other
organisms, but these will be generated only when the
nuclear genome of a specific organism has reached a highquality level of assembly. Once the Reference Compilations for other organisms have been produced, pairwise
NumtS compilation comparisons, based on the UCSC
Genome Browser Alignment net option, will be used to
define orthologous NumtS. This procedure has been
already implemented in [31] in the Human-Chimp comparison. Lastly, some features of Human NumtS will be
investigated. We will also analyze SNPs located inside
NumtS through dbSNP at NCBI. These data may offer new
perspectives in population mitochondrial genetics, preferentially in those NumtS that comparative genomics may
indicate as being conserved. Lastly, with respect to the
NumtS insertion site, we have started some preliminary
pattern analysis by applying the WORDUP program [44]
to the NumtS flanking region, although no significant
results have yet been found (data not shown). This should
mean that NumtS integration is not guided by specific
DNA signals or does not generate any specific pattern, as
is the case for retrotransposons, in which LTR sequences
are generated after integration. Gherman et al. have

Mapping3of Human NumtS on Human mitochondrial genome
Mapping of Human NumtS on Human mitochondrial genome. Column 1 reports mt gene name, column 2 and 3
report location of the mt gene inside the genome and, starting from column 4, the RHNumtS identifiers of the NumtS containing the mt gene are shown. An RHNumtS identifier present in three contiguous genes indicates that NumtS contains the centrally located gene in its entire length; otherwise, it is partially contained. Green: regulatory regions; yellow: tRNA genes; red:
protein coding genes; pink: rRNA genes.

Methods
Blast
Blastn compares a nucleotide query sequence against a
nucleotide database. It can produce differing results if the
parameters selected among those available differ. The
input data for a Blastn run are: query sequence, sequence
set to be searched, Expected number of chance matches in
a random model (E-value), maximum number of hits to
be displayed, maximum number of aligned sequences to
be displayed, size of the string to be searched in pairwise
comparison (word size), scoring parameters, and filtering
and masking options. In addition, within the "sequence
set to be searched" section, a specific sequence subset can
be selected with the Limits option, available through the
Entrez retrieval system [45]. We submitted several runs,
changing: a) the sequence set to be searched ("chromosome", "nr" (not redundant nucleotide sequences) or
"refseq_genome"), with and without Limits by Entrez; b)
Maximum number of Hits to be displayed (egg. Description# = 1000, Graphic display# = 500, Alignments view#
= 1000). The threshold E-value was always fixed at 0.001.
The query sequence was that of the revised Reference
Cambridge Sequence (GenBank Accession J01415.2,
[14]). As already stated above, if the reference human

mitochondrial genome is changed, the Blast result also
changes.
MegaBlast
As reported in the NCBI Handbook [36], "MEGABLAST is
specifically designed to efficiently find long alignments
between very similar sequences and thus it is the best tool
to find the identical match to the query sequence. In addition to the expected value significance cut-off, MEGABLAST also provides an adjustable percent identity cut-off
that overrides the significance threshold."
BLAT
BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) [37] is a very fast
sequence alignment tool similar to BLAST. On DNA queries, BLAT is designed to find quickly sequences with 95%
or greater similarity 40 BP long or more. It may miss
genomic alignments that are more divergent or shorter
than these minima, although it will find perfect sequence
matches of 33 bases and sometimes as few as 22. The tool
is capable of aligning sequences containing large intron
sequences. Thus, because NumtS, after insertion in the
nuclear genome, undergoes further arrangements, losing
or acquiring new interspersed fragments and/or single

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:267

nucleotides, BLAT is definitely a good tool for locating
them. Instead, Blast locates single fragments of the entire
NumtS. As both approaches are useful for a complete view
of NumtS, this is the reason for our using both methods.
The BLAT program available at the UCSC site has the great
advantage of allowing the comparison of a query
sequence against a repertoire of four different Human
Builds, starting from April 2004 up to October 2006. Each
Human Build also reports the absolute coordinate for
each Chromosome, thus ensuring a good referencing system for locating NumtS in the genome. Each hit in BLAT
corresponds to a wide region where several blocks are
located. These can be displayed and analysed starting
from the BLAT output page and clicking on "details", so
that the sequences of each block and their alignment
appear. Thus, aligned blocks with gaps less than or equal
to 8 BP are merged, when only one sequence has a gap or
when gaps in both sequences are of the same size. This
implies that the identity percentage is the sum of the
matches in each block divided by the sum of the block
lengths.
Amplification and Sequencing
In order to carry out a preliminary validation of the compilation, we selected 41 NumtS whose score is lower than
3 and submitted them to PCR amplification and sequencing. The 41 NumtS were amplified on DNA extracted from
the blood of a European individual available in G. Romeo
laboratory. Moreover 27 among the 41 NumtS were also
amplified from DNA extracted from the blood of 3
healthy subjects belonging to different geographic areas
and different haplogroups, in order to verify the NumtS
presence/absence in phylogenetic lineages. Samples
selected for analysis were individuals coming from Japan
(A. Torroni laboratory), Latin America and North Africa
(V. Carelli laboratory), and belonged respectively to haplogroups H2b, G1a1a, I3a and L2a1c1. Among the 27
NumtS, 16 were sequenced in all the samples: NumtS 87,
122 and 41–54. NumtSs 41–54, because they were tandemly repeated, were amplified and sequenced all
together. For some of the amplified NumtS, the sequencing failed. These are marked in Table 4. PCR conditions
were not always equal. Primers were designed with
PRIMER3 software, testing the amplification of the full
NumtS (external-external primers) or part of it (externalinternal primers or internal-internal primers) as reported
in Table 4 and Figures 2a and 2b. Before the application
of the PRIMER3 program to the NumtS sequence and its
flanking regions, the sequence was submitted to further
bioinformatics test by blasting it against the J01415.2 reference mt sequence using the Blast2 program [49].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/267

Primer sequences are available on request. The sequences
were produced starting from the amplified fragments.
Sequencing was performed with BigDye v3.1 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, on an AB3730 capillary analyzer. The
produced sequences have been multialigned by applying
MAFFT [46] and MUSCLE [47] programs both available at
[48] in the tools section.

Comparison of BLAT and Megablast results. For each NumtS in the
RHNumtS compilation, Megablast and BLAT programs either did or did
not detect it (yes/no); if yes, table shows mt coordinates, BLAT code
assigned, number of aligned blocks and fragments as reported in BLAT
details, and %identity value as reported in BLAT output. NumtS reporting
code "Yes_1" in "BLAT hits correspondence table" were recovered by submitting mt fragment corresponding to a NumtS obtained through Blastn
to BLAT, and not through submission of entire mt genome (J01415.2 or
NC_01807.4) to BLAT.

Multi-alignments of sequenced NumtS from 4 different phylo-geographic samples. The nucleotide multi-alignments of the amplified (fig
2a in the manuscript) and sequenced NumtS 87, 122 and 41–54 of individuals coming from Europe, Japan, Latin America and North Africa
belonging respectively to haplogroups H2b, G1a1a, I3a and L2a1c1 compared with the NumtS sequence as it can be extracted from the Human
Genome build36.2 through the UCSC genome browser (hg18 release)
and the sequences of the corresponding mitochondrial region for the same
samples, are reported. Multi-alignments of NumtS 87 and 122 include
the rCRS sequence (accession number J01415.2 in GenBank) also, thus
allowing the exact localization of the variant sites respect to the universally
used human mitochondrial reference sequence. As far as NumtS 41-54
the reference sequence has been added to NumtS 43 only in a distinctly
reported multialignment. The conservation of NumtS is evident from the
multialignment among the different subjects, although heterozygous sites
can be observed (nucleotide ambiguity letter such as Y for C/T, R for A/G
etc.). Each multi-alignment refers to the nuclear region (from Chromosome start to Chromosome end), as reported in additional file 1. The
NumtS sequences produced in our validation experiments are named with
a code defined by the NumtS code and the haplogroup of the sample. The
corresponding mtDNA regions are coded as mt, followed by the haplogroup code. The reference sequence for 122 NumtS is extracted from Celera genome chromosome 9 (CM00260). Sequencing of L2a1c1 122
NumtS, H2b and L2a1c1 41, 42 and 54 NumtS failed.
