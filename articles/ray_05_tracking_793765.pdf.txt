Abstract
Background: Alu elements are Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) in primate genomes that
have proven useful as markers for studying genome evolution, population biology and
phylogenetics. Most of these applications, however, have been limited to humans and their nearest
relatives, chimpanzees. In an effort to expand our understanding of Alu sequence evolution and to
increase the applicability of these markers to non-human primate biology, we have analyzed
available Alu sequences for loci specific to platyrrhine (New World) primates.
Results: Branching patterns along an Alu sequence phylogeny indicate three major classes of
platyrrhine-specific Alu sequences. Sequence comparisons further reveal at least three New World
monkey-specific subfamilies; AluTa7, AluTa10, and AluTa15. Two of these subfamilies appear to be
derived from a gene conversion event that has produced a recently active fusion of AluSc- and
AluSp-type elements. This is a novel mode of origin for new Alu subfamilies.
Conclusion: The use of Alu elements as genetic markers in studies of genome evolution,
phylogenetics, and population biology has been very productive when applied to humans. The
characterization of these three new Alu subfamilies not only increases our understanding of Alu
sequence evolution in primates, but also opens the door to the application of these genetic markers
outside the hominid lineage.

Background
SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) are powerful tools
for systematic and population biologists [1-8]. Examples
of phylogenies elucidated using the SINE method include
the use of SINEs to support the hypothesis that cetaceans
(whales, dolphins and porpoises) form a clade within
Artiodactyla [9], clarification of relationships between
cichlid fishes [10-12] and the resolution of the humanchimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy [5]. Although applications of SINE elements to resolve population dynamics
have been limited to humans [13-19] and, to a lesser
extent, cichlid fishes [11,20,21], these studies have been

very successful in revealing patterns of variation and there
is every reason to believe that they can be as productively
applied to other species.
One reason for the success of SINEs as phylogenetic and
population genetic markers is that their mode of evolution is unidirectional [3,4,7,8,22]. This characteristic
allows for a confident inference that the ancestral state is
the absence of the SINE at each locus. Because there is no
known mechanism for the specific removal of SINEs from
any genome [4,23], individual SINEs are generally
thought to be homoplasy-free characters [4,7,17,22-25].

Alu elements are primate-specific SINEs of ~300 bp. These
elements have been extremely successful at propagating in
primate genomes as evidenced by the fact that they make
up ~10% of the human genome by mass [23,26]. Distinct
subfamilies of Alu elements in the human genome have
been described in detail [17,18,23,27-32]. Examination of
these young subfamilies has provided us with clues as to
the mobilization dynamics and evolution of Alu elements
in the hominid lineage. Characterization of Alu mobilization in non-human primates has not been as complete.
The ascertainment of lineage-specific subfamilies of Alu
elements would increase our understanding of mobile element evolution in these organisms and allow for the
development of SINE-based studies of population and
evolutionary patterns.
We recently used Alu insertion loci to clarify various relationships among platyrrhine (New World monkeys,
NWM) and cercopithecid (Old World monkeys) primates
[33,34]. These projects produced examples of Alu insertions present in a wide variety of lineages along the primate tree. We have performed a phylogenetic analysis of
the Alu sequences themselves (focusing on the platyrrhine-specific insertions) in order to characterize the evolutionary history of Alu lineages that have been or
currently are retrotransposition competent in some nonhuman primates.

Results and discussion
Platyrrhine-specific Alu sequences were obtained from the
data sets used in Ray et al. [34] When available, the
sequences from multiple taxa at a particular locus were
aligned and a consensus sequence generated to create an
approximation of the sequence of the original insertion. A
total of 48 platyrrhine-specific insertions were collected.
All selected sequences were examined for the presence of
target site duplications (TSDs). The presence of these TSDs
along with the absence of each marker in hominid and
cercopithecid taxa (and from the genomes of other platyrrhine primates in many cases) serves to verify that the elements are the result of retrotransposition events and not
segmental duplications. To trim potentially long branches
and to verify the ability of the approach to recover previously established relationships among reference
sequences, we added the consensus sequences for Alu elements specific to hominids (AluYa5, AluYa5a2, AluYb8,
AluYb9, AluYc1, AluYc2, AluYd3, AluYd6, and AluYe5)
[18,30-32,35-37]. We also included the canonical Alu
consensus sequences for the Jb, Sc, Sg, Sp, Sq, Sx, and Y
subfamilies [38-40] and rooted the tree on AluJb based on
previously established relationships [40-42].
The methods used to identify informative loci among cercopithecid taxa primarily involved a linker-PCR strategy
using two Alu selection primers [33]. Unfortunately, this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/51

introduced a sequence bias toward particular subfamilies
of recently integrated or lineage specific Alu elements. The
strategy used to identify informative platyrrhine loci, on
the other hand, used a combined computational-experimental approach. Over half of the loci identified were
derived from Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)
sequences and thus no bias was introduced. In addition, a
wide variety of primers was used in the linker-PCR
approach; as a consequence, the bias was reduced for
experimentally-derived loci. Because of the bias in the
data derived from the cercopithecids, we have not
included these Alu sequences in the analyses. For platyrrhine Alu lineages, however, more confident inferences
can be made.
Tree topologies recovered using Bayesian and parsimony
criteria were generally congruent (Fig. 1). Minor differences in the placement of some sequences are observed
but the well-supported clades recovered by the Bayesian
analysis are often present in the parsimony consensus
trees with reasonable support (>75%). However, bootstrap support on the parsimony-based cladogram was not
as high for several of the major nodes found on the Bayesian tree. We suspect that this is due to the hybrid (partially gene converted) nature of 31 sequences that share
diagnostic features of both AluSc-derived and AluSp
derived elements (see below for a full discussion). Given
the assumptions inherent in parsimony-based analyses
(i.e. incremental sequence-based changes) hybrid elements that accumulated a whole suite of character states
as a unit and that define other lineages in the data set
would be expected to cause significant problems. Supplemental analyses with the hybrid elements removed confirmed this suspicion by raising support values at some
nodes over 20 points (data not shown). The reduced treesearch method used is also thought to recover lower bootstrap support values than more traditional methods [43].
For these reasons, we have chosen to base our major conclusions on the topology and support values present on
the Bayesian tree.
Within that tree, the established relationships between
canonical Alu consensus sequences were recovered as
expected. The AluJb subfamily is basal to the remaining
Alu sequences and relationships between the various AluS
subfamilies are similar to the results of Kapitonov and
Jurka [39]. Among the New World primate Alu sequences
all but three platyrrhine-specific sequences fall within a
well supported AluSc-AluY derived clade. This topology
suggests that at there may have been three Alu lineages
active at the time of the platyrrhine-catarrhine divergence
around 35–40 million years ago [44]: an AluY progenitor;
AluSp; and, AluSc. The three platyrrhine-specific Alu insertions that clustered outside the major platyrrhine AluSc/
AluY-derived
clade
were

'All_NWM_Locus_15', and 'All_NWM_Locus_31'. Each of
these insertions is present in all tested platyrrhine taxa,
suggesting that they occurred before the radiation of the
New World monkeys into three recognized families,
(Cebidae, Atelidae and Pitheciidae). The Alu sequence at
'All_NWM_Locus_1' appears to be derived from an AluSp
source gene. Direct observation of the Alu sequence confirms the presence of several AluSp diagnostic sites in this
element (see supplemental alignments). Based on our
analyses, the sequence for 'All_NWM_Locus_15' appears
to be derived from an AluY progenitor. There is no significant support for the node, however, and it should be
noted that this is merely a suggestion based on the topology of the tree. Thus, an AluY progenitor, AluSp, and AluSc
were all active around the time of the split. The source of
the sequence at 'All_NWM_Locus_31' is unclear given the
differences in placement between the Bayesian and parsi-

mony analyses. RepeatMasker [45] lists the element as
belonging to the AluSg lineage. Thus, it may represent a
fourth lineage that was active early in the evolution of
New World monkeys.
A majority of the Alu sequences specific to various New
World monkeys are most closely related to an AluSc and
there are four well-supported clades within this group.
Clade A is represented by two sequences that were found
only in members of Pitheciidae. The insertions
'Callicebus_83' and 'Pithecia_46', were specific to their
respective Pitheciid genera, and they share eight exclusive
non-CpG mutations when compared to AluSc and other
AluSc-like sequences (Bayesian support = 1.00). The close
relationship between these sequences was also recovered
in the parsimony analysis. While we will not assign them
to a new subfamily based on only two sequences, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/51

suggest that they are good candidates for a Pitheciid-specific lineage.

elements already present in the genome. That does not
appear to be the case here.

A second clade (B) within the putative AluSc-derived
group was also highly supported (0.99) and was represented an insertion identified in all platyrrhine primates
('All_NWM_Locus_26'), as well as in two Atelid taxa
('Lago_and_Atel_20') and in all members of Cebidae and
Atelidae ('Cebid_Atelid_Locus_14'). These sequences may
represent an AluSc-derived subfamily. However, this cluster was based on only a few sequences and on shared
mutations at CpG sites; thus, it should be interpreted cautiously. An alternative is that these and the other elements
in this group represent true AluSc insertions that have continued to accumulate in platyrrhine genomes throughout
their evolution. This is not unlikely given the recent observations of potentially polymorphic AluSc loci [46] and relatively recent AluSx insertions in humans [47]. The
'stealth' model of Alu evolution and dispersal reported by
Han et al. [48] also predicts low levels of activity for older
Alu subfamiles. AluSc may represent a hardy subfamily
that has remained active at a low level for long periods of
time in a variety of primate genomes.

The presence of 31 distinct elements harboring this combination of AluSc and AluSp diagnostic mutations (plus
three additional shared mutations) suggests that there is a
recently active source gene with these characteristics. We
propose that a source gene (most likely derived from
AluSc) existed early in platyrrhine primate evolution and
that the 3' end of the element was subjected to a gene conversion event via any of the three potential models
described by Kass et al. [51]. Starting somewhere between
bases 199 and 226 and continuing to the end of the element, the conversion event resulted in the replacement of
the sequence of the source gene with sequence from an
AluSp-like element (Fig. 2). The result was a 'fusion' element that remained active and may still be active in the
genomes of several platyrrhine primates.

Clade C (support = 0.99) comprises five sequences characterized by 11 shared mutations (including a 7-base
duplication) that distinguish them from AluSc. Sequences
in this clade are distributed among members of families
Pitheciidae and Atelidae. One interpretation of this pattern is the emergence of the source gene prior to the
expansion of a Pitheciid-Cebid clade but after the divergence of Atelid taxa. This hypothesis is unlikely, however,
given the results of Ray et al. [34] in which it was made
clear that family Pitheciidae was the first to diverge from
the early platyrrhine groups. We suggest instead that the
source gene emerged after the divergence of platyrrhine
and catarrhine primates but before the platyrrhine radiation 17–20 mya [49,50], and that none of these elements
was recovered for Cebid taxa due to sampling error. Additional work will be required to test this hypothesis.
Clade D is the largest of the clearly definable platyrrhine
Alu clades, comprising 31 sequences from all three platyrrhine families. It is well-supported (1.00) and is distinguished by numerous shared mutations among its
members. Of the new subfamilies described here, this lineage is particularly interesting because of its apparently
unique origin. Close examination of the sequences reveals
four shared AluSc diagnostic mutations at the 5' end of the
elements; however, at the 3' end of the elements, there are
five additional diagnostic sites characteristic of the AluSp
subfamily. Examples of 'hybrid' elements have been
described previously [17,25,29], but these represented
individual instances involving the gene conversion of Alu

This group of elements can be further subdivided into two
subfamilies based on additional shared diagnostic mutations in what appears to be the more recently derived subfamily. In addition to the AluSp and AluSc derived sites
and the three additional distinguishing sites, 21 elements
share four unique mutations. Thus, clade D can be subdivided into two subfamilies consisting of 10 and 21 elements, respectively (see supplemental alignments).
These two subfamilies share two diagnostic positions with
the previously mentioned clade C 5' to the appearance of
the AluSp indicative sites. Thus, we believe that these three
groups of sequences represent a new platyrrhine-specific
subfamily we dubbed AluT. We chose this designation
based on the nomenclature proposed by Batzer et al. [38]
in which younger subfamilies are assigned later letters of
the alphabet. This is followed by a lowercase letter designating the order of publication, and a numerical designation indicating the number of diagnostic sites that
differentiate it from the subfamily consensus. Because this
group was similar to and apparently derived from AluSc,
AluT was most appropriate. It is distinguished from AluSc
by the two aforementioned diagnostic mutations and can
currently be divided into three subfamilies; AluTa7,
AluTa10, and AluTa15 (Fig. 2). For reference, we have
included a hypothetical AluT consensus sequence based
on the diagnostic sites shared by the Ta5, Ta10, and Ta15
consensi and the presumed ancestral sequence, AluSc, in
figure 2.
Represented by 21 sequences, AluTa15 was only found in
Cebid taxa (Aotus, Callithrix, and Siamiri). AluTa10 is represented by ten sequences and was recovered in members
of all three platyrrhine families. The distribution of this
subfamily of elements among platyrrine taxa and the pattern of shared diagnostic sites suggest that the AluTa10

family expanded earlier in platyrrhine evolution and may
have given rise to the AluTa15 subfamily. A larger sample
based solely on elements derived from unbiased methods
will be required to test this hypothesis and is currently
underway.

Conclusion
The identification of three (potentially four) new subfamilies that are unique to platyrrhine primates represents
a step forward in our understanding of the evolution of
Alu elements in the genomes of non-hominid primates.
Further, this is the first report of a unique mechanism of
Alu subfamily generation. Until now, the evolution of Alu
subfamilies could easily be described using the sequential
accumulation of diagnostic mutations. For example, the
hominid Alu subfamily AluYb currently consists of four
variants, Yb7, Yb8, Yb9, and Yb11 [30,31,52]. Patterns of
sequence variation clearly illustrate the hierarchical
nature of sequence evolution in this family. Yb9 exhibits
all of the diagnostic mutations defining AluYb7 and
AluYb8 as well as its own signature mutation. AluYb11 follows suit by exhibiting all of the AluYb9 mutations plus
two others. This pattern is confirmed using age estimates
that suggest AluYb7 is the oldest and AluYb11 is the

youngest. The AluTa10 and AluTa15 subfamilies represent
the first documented cases of a recently active 'fusion' element in which the diagnostic mutations were not accumulated gradually over time; instead, they represent the
sudden incorporation of several signature mutations by
way of a gene conversion event. Thus, a new mechanism
of Alu subfamily generation, though previously considered possible [29], has now been substantiated in the
genome.
On a more practical level, a number of questions raised in
other taxonomic analyses of New World monkeys can
now be better addressed [1,34,53-60] given the data presented here. We can confidently assign subfamily status to
certain individual Alu elements in platyrrhine genomes.
Thus, we are able to target particular Alu subfamilies with
known expansion timeframes to address branching patterns for particular primate lineages. This technique has
previously proven valuable. For example, by combining a
targeted analysis of the AluYe5 subfamily with sequence
database searches for additional informative loci, we were
able to confidently address the human-chimpanzeegorilla trichotomy [5]. Application of similar techniques
to other primates can easily be adapted by using the linker

protocols described in Ray et al. [34], Xing et al. [33] and
Roy et al. [61] and by computational analyses of existing
sequence data.
At the population level, the amplification dynamics of Alu
elements have been well characterized in humans and
even in chimpanzees, but have not been investigated
extensively in other primates. This is unfortunate given
their utility in studies of genome evolution in humans
and chimpanzees [62-64], population biology in humans
[13,15,16,27,65-74], and phylogenetic analysis at all levels of the primate tree [2,5,6,33,34,41,75]. Knowledge of
these subfamilies will aid in the development of markers
useful for all of the above tasks. For example, given the
endangered status of many New World taxa, the existence
of easy-to-ascertain markers (via a single PCR) to identify
species-specific Alu insertions in tissues of unknown origin will be a boon to conservation biologists and to population geneticists. Similar genetic systems have already
proven useful in other taxa ranging from humans to
waterfowl [76-78]. As one simple example, we now use
many of the Alu loci used in this study to verify the identity of cell lines in our laboratory. Using a single PCR to
amplify a taxon-specific Alu insertion is quick and efficient when compared to methods that involve morphological analysis (if possible on a tissue sample) or
amplification and sequencing of DNA.
In this study we have identified diagnostic mutations for
platyrrhine specific subfamilies. The identification of particular Alu lineages is the critical first step in identifying
polymorphic elements in a primate taxon [17,18,31,61].
By identifying the subfamilies that are specific to particular taxa, researchers are now better able to use previously
established techniques that take advantage of diagnostic
mutations to identify useful markers at various taxonomic
levels. The essentially homoplasy free nature of SINE
markers makes them in some ways superior to other commonly used markers for population genetics
[3,4,10,12,22,34]. Thus we see this as the beginning of a
series of studies in which the SINE method of population
genetic analysis will be expanded beyond our own
species.

Methods
Insertion/deletion (indels) events play a significant role in
defining Alu subfamilies. For this reason, the phylogenetic
method we used to reconstruct relationships was based
primarily on the Bayesian method implemented by
MrBayes, Ver. 3.1 [79,80]. We chose this method because
of its robustness and its ability to take advantage of information present in the form of insertion/deletion events in
the alignment. We partitioned the data into two sets,
sequence data and gap data. For partition one, sequence
parameters were estimated from the data The second par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/51

tition was generated using indels that were present in two
or more sequences. These were coded as present
(sequence) or absent (gap). For the second data partition,
we estimated rates of indel occurrence from the data and
corrected for ascertainment bias by setting the coding
option to 'variable' as per the MrBayes manual.
Two simultaneous Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses
were performed using one cold and three heated chains
(temperature set to default 0.2) for each analysis. We ran
the analysis for 7.5 million generations, sampling the
trees every 100 generations. At ~6.13. million generations,
the standard deviation of split frequencies consistently
reached a value of <0.01, indicating that both analyses
had begun converging on similar trees. We discarded the
first 6.5 million generations as burn-in and generated a
majority-rules consensus tree. Nodes with probability values of 0.85 to 0.89 were considered to have low support,
0.90 to 0.94 to have moderate support and nodes greater
than 0.95 to be highly supported [80].
As a comparison, we also performed a parsimony analysis
of the data in PAUP* v4.0b10 [81]. Non-CpG dinucleotides were weighted at six times the value of CpG dinucleotides [82] and gaps were treated as a fifth character
state. The size of the data set made a bootstrap analysis
using a full heuristic search for each replicate impractical.
For this reason, we employed a reduced tree-search bootstrapping method as described by DeBry and Olmstead
[43] to ascertain support for nodes.
The sequences from each clearly defined clade (see Results
and Discussion) were collected and examined for shared
mutations that presumably represent diagnostic mutations or positions characteristic of mobile element subfamilies. Consensus sequences for each of these groups
were constructed. For non-CpG sites, a simple majorityrules approach was taken to obtain the consensus for the
site. Alu elements, however, are rich in CpG dinucleotides
that are known to mutate at a 6-fold higher rate than nonCpG sites [82]. These sites tend to be highly variable and
could represent a problem when determining the identity.
We addressed this issue by examining types of variation at
potential CpG sites and by referring to the presumed
ancestral sequences. First, dinucleotide sites exhibiting
high diversity that comprised primarily both CpA and
TpG dinucleotides were assumed to be highly mutable
CpG sites that decayed as the result of the spontaneous
deamination of 5-methylcytosine. When it remained
unclear whether or not the site should be considered a
CpG dinucleotide, we referred to the AluSc or AluSp consensus sequences to determine the likely ancestral state for
the site and made the appropriate assignment.
