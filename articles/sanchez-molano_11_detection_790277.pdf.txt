Abstract
Background: The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a highly appreciated European aquaculture species. Growth
related traits constitute the main goal of the ongoing genetic breeding programs of this species. The recent
construction of a consensus linkage map in this species has allowed the selection of a panel of 100
homogeneously distributed markers covering the 26 linkage groups (LG) suitable for QTL search. In this study we
addressed the detection of QTL with effect on body weight, length and Fulton’s condition factor.
Results: Eight families from two genetic breeding programs comprising 814 individuals were used to search for
growth related QTL using the panel of microsatellites available for QTL screening. Two different approaches,
maximum likelihood and regression interval mapping, were used in order to search for QTL. Up to eleven
significant QTL were detected with both methods in at least one family: four for weight on LGs 5, 14, 15 and 16;
five for length on LGs 5, 6, 12, 14 and 15; and two for Fulton’s condition factor on LGs 3 and 16. In these LGs an
association analysis was performed to ascertain the microsatellite marker with the highest apparent effect on the
trait, in order to test the possibility of using them for marker assisted selection.
Conclusions: The use of regression interval mapping and maximum likelihood methods for QTL detection
provided consistent results in many cases, although the high variation observed for traits mean among families
made it difficult to evaluate QTL effects. Finer mapping of detected QTL, looking for tightly linked markers to the
causative mutation, and comparative genomics are suggested to deepen in the analysis of QTL in turbot so they
can be applied in marker assisted selection programs.

Background
Growth related traits (e.g. body weight or length) constitute the main goal of genetic breeding programs in
aquaculture. An increase in growth rate reduces production costs because it decreases the rearing time at farm
facilities, thus increasing benefits for aquaculture companies [1]. The phenotype of these traits is generally
associated to many genes of small effect according to
the infinitesimal model [2], but also to few genes of
high effect. There are two main approaches to address
this fact: a) The identification of QTL or b) the identification of associated markers. QTL can be defined as
DNA regions containing a gene or genes with relative

high effect on a trait of interest [3]. The development of
QTL studies through fine linkage maps may eventually
lead to the identification of the particular gene/s underlying the trait, which promotes their use for breeding
programs (GAS: Gene Assisted Selection). On the other
hand, a trait associated marker is a neutral genome position in linkage disequilibrium with a gene/s underlying
the trait. Thus, variation in the associated marker partially explains the phenotypic variation of the trait
through a correlation with variation in the actual trait
determining gene. Hence, associated markers can be
also used in breeding programs (MAS: Marker Assisted
Selection).
The effects of allele segregation at molecular markers
throughout the genome can be used to determine the
number, position and magnitude of QTL related to a
particular trait [4]. For this purpose, the development of

linkage genetic maps is essential [5]. Such maps have
been developed for several commercial fish species [6].
To date, there are few studies on QTL affecting
growth related traits in fish. Most of them were carried
out in salmonids [7-9], and a number of significant QTL
in the range from 2 to 4 was identified for each trait
accounting for 20-25% of their phenotypic variation.
Similar results were obtained in tilapia [10,11] and in
sea bass [12-14]; in the latter case, QTL explained a
higher proportion of the phenotypic variance (from 28%
to 60%).
Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a flatfish that has
been intensively cultured during the last decade due to
its great commercial value. With 22 haploid chromosomes (2 of them submetacentric, 11 subtelocentric and
9 telocentric) [15] and one of the smallest genomes
among cultured fishes (< 800 Mb) [16], its production
in Europe has increased from 3000 Tm in 1996 to 9246
Tm in 2009 [17]. As in many other cultured species,
weight and length are traits of special interest. Size dispersion (both weight and length) in turbot culture,
mainly due to sexual dimorphism since females largely
outgrow males, is another key issue for its farming [18].
Only two studies about QTL detection have been carried out in this species. In the first one, a highly significant QTL for sex determination was identified [19], and
in the second one a single QTL for body length was
detected [20].
It has been suggested that flatfish (order Pleuronectiformes) growth is allometric [21]. These authors provided data in seven flatfish species from three different
families: Soleidae, Bothidae and Citharidae, and clear
departures from isometric growth were observed in four
of them (two from Bothidae, one from Citharidae and
one from Soleidae), whereas in three species (one from
Bothidae and two from Soleidae) isometric growth
appeared plausible. Therefore, growth model is expected
to vary among different species, even considering species
of the same order. As indicated, no data on species of
Scophthalmidae, family to which turbot pertains, have
been provided by these authors. A recent study in this
species has shown that variation was not statistically different from isometric growth [22]. However, other studies in turbot have shown positive allometry associated
with temperature [23], negative allometric growth being
thus observed in late summer and autumn (temperature
around 22°C), while positive allometric growth holds up
in winter and spring (temperature around 7-10°C).
Martínez et al. developed a panel of homogeneously
distributed markers ideal for QTL identification in turbot based on previous genetic mapping information
[15,24,25]. The average distance between these markers
in the consensus map is 14.43 cM, therefore meeting
the minimum requirements for QTL analysis [26]. The

Page 2 of 9

recombination frequency ratio between males and
females was determined to be 1.6:1 (female:male) in turbot [15], and consequently, the same linkage map can
be used for both sexes without large errors.
Considering the commercial value of turbot and the
availability of a suitable set of markers for QTL screening, it is possible to conduct a study on the detection of
growth related QTL. The main objectives of this study
are twofold: a) to detect and locate QTL affecting three
growth-related traits in turbot: body weight, length and
Fulton’s condition factor, and b) to determine the association between microsatellite markers and growth
related traits and compute their apparent effects.

Methods
Turbot Families

Eight families coming from two genetic breeding programs of turbot companies located in NW Spain were
used in this study. Seven of them were obtained from
Stolt Sea Farm SA (FamPA-1, FamPA-3, FamPA-4,
FamPA-6, FamAS-1, FamAS-2 and FamAS-3) and one
from Insuiña SA (FamAP).
Families were obtained following a three generation
scheme starting from unrelated grandparents from natural populations of the Atlantic Ocean turbot fisheries
area which led to full sibling pair analysis. Families were
maintained under the same conditions at constant water
temperature of 18°C in separated breeding tanks and
using the standard culture procedure for this species
[27]. Family size ranged from 85 to 113 individuals
(Table 1).
All experiments in this work have been reviewed and
approved by the CETGA (Cluster de Acuicultura de
Galicia) Committee on Bioethics.
Trait measurements

Three growth related traits were evaluated: body weight
(We), length (Le) and Fulton’s condition factor (FK).
Fulton’s condition factor, developed by Fulton [28], is a

measure of a fish fatness and can be computed as 100 *
We/Le 3 , where We is the body weight of the fish in
grams and Le is the length of the fish in centimeters. In
our study, water temperature was maintained constant
at 18°C. Then isometric growth in the studied families
would be expected, and Fulton’s factor should be a good
approximation to fish condition, thus making it unnecessary to apply an allometric coefficient.
Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine the linear correlation between all pairs of analysed
traits. Since differences in growth rate between sexes are
significant only after 9 months post-hatching [18] and
the age of evaluation was five months post-hatching for
families FamAS-1, FamAS-2, FamAS-3 and FamAP and
eight months post-hatching for families FamPA-1,
FamPA-3, FamPA-4 and FamPA-6, the sex of evaluated
individuals is not expected to influence the measured
traits.
Microsatellites and genetic map

Table 1 shows the number of microsatellites analysed
for each family, the number of LGs they covered in the
genetic map, the map length, the average distance
between microsatellites and the average number of
microsatellites per linkage group. Not all LGs were
represented in all families because some markers were
non-informative at specific families (e.g. both parents
being homozygous) or there was only one marker
available.
The panel of markers used for QTL identification was
reported by Martinez et al. [19] and it is based on the
consensus map by Bouza et al. [15], the mapping of
ESTs by Bouza et al. [24] and the centromere mapping
by Martinez et al. [25].
Statistical procedures
QTL analyses

Two methodologies were used to detect QTL: Linear
regression (LR) interval mapping using the GridQTL
program [29,30] and maximum likelihood (ML) using
the QTLMap program [31,32]. Each family was analysed
separately, as differences in the age of evaluation and/or
the maintenance of each family in separated tanks could
distort the estimation of QTL effects if they were analysed together. The analysis of QTL in different families
under different methods is expected to provide more
confident estimations for the QTL existence (i.e. if it
appears in different families or if it is detected with both
methods). Also, a joint analysis of the 5- and the 8month-old families, respectively, was done. All genotyping information (including grandparents) was used to
obtain phase performance values.
GridQTL considers the linkage phase between markers
in accordance with pedigree information. No fixed factor

Page 3 of 9

or covariate was included in the model except in
FamPA-3, where sex information was available and it
was considered to be a fixed factor. A single QTL was
assumed at each LG and the default regression method
(Haseman-Elston) was applied [33]. Chromosome-wide
and genome wide significance thresholds were estimated
by implementing a bootstrapping method at p = 0.05
and 0.01 [34], with a permutation test set to 10,000
iterations [35].
QTLMap detects QTL through interval mapping using
ML estimates along the LG and the QTL position is
estimated through the likelihood ratio [36,37]. For the
computation of significant thresholds, 10,000 simulations were used under the null hypothesis (no QTL) for
each trait and LG.
As previously suggested [7], chromosome-wide significance of QTL between 5% and 1% entailed its classification as suggestive, and significance below 1% entailed its
classification as significant for both statistical methodologies applied. Genome-wide significances were also
tested but no significant results were obtained.
Association analysis

In order to investigate associations between phenotypic
traits and molecular genotypes, a one-way ANOVA was
performed for the progeny of each family, using the different genotypes of markers in the same LG where the
QTL was detected. Each ANOVA provided also a corrected R2 value that measured the reduction of the overall phenotypic variance of the trait due to the model
fitting, thus providing the proportion of the variance of
the trait that can be predictable from the given marker
genotypes.
Before the ANOVA analysis, tests to check for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variances
(Levene test) were performed. Also a Bonferroni correction per LG was applied to the significance threshold
for ANOVAs in order to cope with the problem of false
positives in multiple comparisons.

Results and discussion
This study represents the first wide QTL analysis for
growth-related traits in turbot. A few studies have been
addressed to detect growth-related QTL in fish and
most of them have been carried out in salmonids [7-9],
tilapia [10,11] and sea bass [12-14].
The power to detect QTL depends on the heritability
of the trait, the recombination distance between the
QTL and associated markers, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the QTL, the QTL allele frequencies and the sample size [38]. In this study,
heritabilities assumed for weight, length and Fulton’s
factor were, respectively, 0.45, 0.3 and 0.2 [39], and the
number of microsatellites and marker density is shown

in Table 1. The number of microsatellites analysed in
family FamPA-3 is higher than in other families because
it was the reference family used for constructing the
microsatellite genetic map of turbot [15]. The power of
QTL analysis is limited, since only segregating QTL in
one or both parents can be detected. In this study, the
analysed families came from unrelated grandparents
from different natural populations of the Atlantic area,
where no significant genetic differences between populations were detected, excluding Baltic Sea populations
[40,41]. In consequence, although the detected QTL
might be representative of the genetic architecture of
growth related traits in turbot, they should be verified in
more turbot families previously to their use in breeding
programs.
Phenotypic values and correlations among growth-related
traits

For each family, means (with standard error) for weight,
length and Fulton’s condition factor are shown in Table
2. The high dispersal of means across families is due to
the family effect, to the different age of fishes and to
some uncontrolled factors. This fact hinders the joint
analysis of families.
There was a highly significant positive correlation
between weight and length with an average value of
0.890 (p < 0.001) (Additional file 1 Table S1). Also, a
significant positive correlation, but lower, was observed
between weight and condition factor (average value of
0.279 with p < 0.01). However, no significant correlation
was detected between length and condition factor. Similar results were obtained in tilapia (Oreochromis sp.)
with 0.91 for weight-length [10] and Atlantic salmon (S.
salar) with 0.8 for body weight-condition factor [7].
Concerning condition factor and length, the non-significant correlation could suggest that loci influencing these
traits may be segregating independently, although it
should also be considered that linear correlations could
be meaningless due to the cubic nature of the condition
factor.

Detection of QTL using GridQTL and QTLmap

Table 3 shows the QTL detected with each method for
each trait. Although an important concordance was
observed with both methods in the detected QTL, differences do exist, and the LR method (GridQTL) identified some QTL that were not detected using the ML
one (QTLMap). Also ML provided, in general, higher
significance for concordant QTL. Similar results were
obtained by Kao [42], who detected that ML methods
tend to be more powerful and differences between both
methods tend to be larger as the marker interval
becomes wider and the QTL position moves from
boundary to the middle of an interval. He suggested the
application of regression methods as the initial procedure to obtain preliminary results and then using the
ML method in order to produce conclusive results. Also
according to Imsland et al. [18], our results showed that
sex does not have a significant effect after the analysis
of FamPA-3.
QTL affecting all traits were detected in LG16 by both
methods, and in some cases in more than one family,
which evidences its high consistency. Likewise, both
methods detected QTL for weight and length in LG5,
LG6, LG14 and LG15 in only one family (excluding
LG15 detected by ML for weight, in two families). In
the case of LG1 in FamPA-3 and LG12 in FamAP, a
QTL was detected for weight and length in one family
by using the ML method (QTLMap), but only an effect
on length was detected using the LR method (GridQTL).
Regarding Fulton’s condition factor (FK), both methods detected a significant QTL in LG3. Suggestive QTL
were detected in LG2 by ML in two families and in LG4
by LR in other two families. LR method detected a QTL
in LG11 affecting weight and FK, but this QTL was not
detected using the ML method.
The number of LGs with a significant QTL in the present study (from two to five depending on the trait and
methodology used) is of the same order as reported in
Arctic charr [8] or Asian seabass [12], using the experimental design of families of sibling pairs for QTL detection. Some QTL were found to affect two or more
traits. This could be due to a gene/s being part of an
early step in a metabolic route or acting in early stages
of development affecting both traits, but also to linked
genes affecting different traits. Similar positions of the
QTL for weight-length and weight-condition factor were
consistent with the positive correlations observed
between these traits (0.890 and 0.279 respectively).
Joint analyses of the 5- or 8-month-old fishes, respectively, provided no significant or suggestive QTL, probably due to differences in strain genetic background that
influences the degree of QTL expression as reported by
Wringe et al. [43] or the existence of another uncontrolled factor in each family.

Association analysis between microsatellite markers and
growth-related traits

For each LG with a detected QTL (suggestive or significant), an association analysis was performed between
the trait and all microsatellites in that LG (Tables 4, 5
and 6). The percentage of phenotypic variance
explained by the marker (R2) was only calculated when
the association was found significant. It could be
expected that only the closest marker to the estimated
position of QTL showed a significant association but
in several cases, the associated marker was not always
the closest one. This fact could be explained by several
reasons: a) a low informative content of the real closest
marker (this occurred for example in the case of
ScmM1 at LG5, where the closest marker was SmaUSC56, but it had only two alleles and one of the parents was homozygous); b) a large extension area in
linkage disequilibrium with the detected QTL could
also cover several markers, resulting in positive associations between the trait and the genotypes at several

markers (this occurred in the QTL detected for length
in LG15 in FamPA-1 which, although showing a maximum LR value at 15.8 cM with QTLMap, covered a
distance of many cM, including three markers) and c)
the existence of a secondary segregating QTL, since
markers could be in linkage disequilibrium with one or
other QTL. Although no secondary QTL were detected
in our study, this possibility should be taken into
account for future studies. Also, it should be considered that the map positions in this study are not definitive, and the inclusion of new markers may produce
some reorganizations.
Regarding weight (Table 4), the highest R2 (17.90%)
was associated to Sma-USC220 in LG14, where a significant QTL was detected by both QTLMap and GridQTL
in family FamPA-1. Sma-USC15 and Sma-USC32 provided also a high R2 (13.70% and 13.60%), being located
respectively in LG1 in FamPA-3 (where a QTL was
detected only with QTLMap) and in LG15 in FamPA-1
(where a QTL was detected by both methods).

All positions and intervals are given in cM. R is the corrected coefficient of determination from the ANOVA. NG is the number of genotypes observed for the
marker in the full-sib family. Functionally annotated markers (BLAST; E-value < 10-5): Sma-USC223 (4SNc-Tudor Domain Protein; E-value: 7 × 10-15); Sma-USCE7
(similar to Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Substrate 2; E-value < 2 × 10-14).

Considering length (Table 5), the highest R2 (16.20%)
was explained again by Sma-USC220, with a significant
QTL detected by both methods. Marker SmaUSC32
provided also a high R 2 (12.90%) with a QTL again
detected with both methods.
For Fulton’s factor (Table 6), the highest R2 (25.8%)
was associated to marker SmaUSC-E11, when analysing
LG16 in family FamPA-3. It was associated to a significant QTL both detected by QTLMap and GridQTL.
Marker Sma-USC144 in LG3 in family FamPA-4 also
showed a high R2 (12.20%) in association to a significant
QTL detected by QTLMap.
In general, the proportion of phenotypic variance
explained by tightest linked markers to the significant
QTL for weight varied from 8 to 13.6%, from 8.2 to
12.9% for length and from 3.3 to 25.8% for Fulton’s condition factor. Similar results were obtained in salmon by

Reid et al. [7]. In our study, it was remarkable the case of
Sma-USC32 marker, associated to a QTL in LG15, which
showed the maximum R 2 for both weight and length,
thus indicating a high association with the trait and the
possibility of using it for MAS. Also, as both QTLmap
and GridQTL agreed on the detection and positioning of
11 QTL, these are expected not to be false positives.
Moreover, association analyses with microsatellite markers in these LGs were significant, giving additional support to our findings. No association was found in several
LGs with detected QTL, probably due to the low informativeness of involved markers. These were some cases
for weight in LGs 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 20; for
length in LGs 1, 2, 3, 13 and 17; and for Fulton’s factor in
LGs 8, 10 and 24.
Most significant associated markers with the QTL
detected on growth traits were anonymous microsatellites

All positions and intervals are given in cM. R2 is the corrected coefficient of determination from the ANOVA. NG is the number of genotypes observed for the
marker in the full-sib family. Functionally annotated markers (BLAST; E-value < 10-5): SmaUSC-E11 (Chloride Channel 3; 2 × 10-19); Sma-USC7 (Insulin-like Growth
Factor 1 Receptor; E-value: 0).

isolated from partial genomic libraries [15], since only a
small number of gene-linked markers have been mapped
in the turbot to date [24]. Interestingly, four of them were
functionally annotated as growth-related genes, therefore
representing putative candidate genes for the traits under
study to be further evaluated in other turbot families.
Thus, the anonymous locus SmaUSC223 (LG16: 53.01
cM; Table 4), which explained almost 13% of phenotypic
variance for a weight QTL, could be annotated as 4SNcTudor domain protein. This gene belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of key regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes, with relevant role in both transcription
and pre-mRNA splicing, but also in RNA-induced gene
silencing and cell proliferation via activating transcription
factors [44]. Also, we detected other three markers associated to functionally annotated growth-related genes: i)
SmaUSC-E11 (LG16: 0.00 cM; Table 6), which explained
close to 26% of phenotypic variance for a Fulton’s factor
QTL, was annotated as Chloride Channel-3. This gene
may be indirectly related to growth, as pointed out in several studies that revealed an influence of water salinity on
fish development and growth, from early embryogenesis to
adult stages [45,46]; ii) SmaUSC7 (LG4: 54.9 cM; Table 6),
which explained close to 10% of phenotypic variance for a
Fulton’s factor QTL, was annotated as Insulin-like Growth
Factor 1 Receptor, a highly relevant growth-related gene
across animal species, including fish [47,48]; and iii)
SmaUSC-E7 (LG6: 92.4 cM; Tables 4 and 5), significantly
associated with weight and length QTL, was annotated as
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Substrate 2, a gene
tightly associated with muscle mass growth in teleosts
[48]. All these turbot candidate sequence tags should be
checked across new families to confirm the detected association and analysed for gene expression using Q-PCR in
individuals or families showing marked differences in
growth rate. Searching for new markers around the
detected QTL, especially for those gene-linked ones, will
be essential to refine marker-associations within each

family and to provide new putative candidates for a functional explanation.
Another way to check QTL associations and look for
candidate genes is comparative mapping [49,50]. In a
study by Bouza et al. [15], syntenic relationships were
observed between sequences of turbot and the model
fish Tetraodon nigroviridis, suggesting true homology of
those associated regions. Thus, a collinear syntenic
block was identified between turbot LG16 and the chromosome 19 of T. nigroviridis (Tni19) based on three
loci (Sma-USC136, Sma-USC285 and Sma-USC223; ~10
cM interval). In the present work, a QTL for weight was
detected in LG16 associated to the closely linked markers (~2 cM) Sma-USC223 and Sma-USC50 (Table 4),
although this latter one did not show sequence similarity against T. nigroviridis genome. The study of this syntenic block in T. nigroviridis could provide information
about candidate genes for the detected QTL, given the
high synteny conservation among phylogenetically
diverse fish genomes [50]. Therefore, we decided to
examine the microsyntenic region from 1,000 kbp to
5,000 kbp in Tni19 in more detail, trying to cover the
small genetic distance between the two weight-QTL
associated markers, SmaUSC223 and Sma-USC50,
assuming a physical-genetic ratio of about 0,5 kbp/cM
[15]. A gene list from this region of Tni19 was obtained
using the BioMart tool from Ensembl. Several of these
genes appeared associated to GO terms related to
growth regulation and cell proliferation (GO:0030308;
GO:0001558; GO:0040008; GO:0042127), some of them
very close to the syntenic position of the QTL associated marker SmaUSC223 (e.g. CD9 molecule; CCND2Cyclin D2; HCLS1-B-cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative; BTG1-Hematopoietic cell-specific Lyn substrate 1; FOXM1-forkhead box M1; PTN-Pleiotrophin;
PAWR-Apoptosis WT1 regulator; LAMB1-Laminin,
beta 1; NRCAM-Neuronal cell adhesion molecule; ADIPOR2-Adiponectin receptor 2; SEMA3A-Semaphorin

3A; CHPT1-Choline phosphotransferase 1). The list also
included some relevant growth-related candidate genes
previously reported in fish (e.g. HGF-Hepatocyte
Growth Factor; FGF6-Fibroblast Growth Factor 6; IGF1Insuline Growth Factor 1) [48,50]. Putting forward new
genetic markers for these candidate genes and testing
them in turbot families will be essential to go further in
the functional explanation of the detected associations,
as in the previous marker-associated approach.

Conclusions
The use of different statistical methods (LR interval mapping and ML) for QTL detection provided consistent
results, the use of several families to look for the repeatability of detected QTL also being of great advantage.
Although the age of evaluation and the culture conditions
have been controlled, a high variation for mean traits was
observed even between families of similar age, thus making it difficult to evaluate QTL effects and the estimation
of heritability (data not shown). This high variation can be
due to uncontrolled factors. Finer mapping of detected
QTL could lead to the identification of candidate genes
useful for GAS. Favoured by an increase of marker density,
another approach could be looking for tightly linked markers that can be used in MAS. In addition, the use of
genetically divergent grandparents in new studies would
provide higher accuracy for estimation of QTL effects, also
allowing the estimation of QTL gene frequencies. Finally,
comparative genomics in homologous regions with model
fish emerges as a useful strategy for verification of the
identified QTL and to look for candidate genes.
