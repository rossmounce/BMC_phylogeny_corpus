Abstract
Background: The apparent scarcity of available sequence data has greatly impeded evolutionary studies in Acari
(mites and ticks). This subclass encompasses over 48,000 species and forms the largest group within the
Arachnida. Although mitochondrial genomes are widely utilised for phylogenetic and population genetic studies,
only 20 mitochondrial genomes of Acari have been determined, of which only one belongs to the diverse order
of the Sarcoptiformes. In this study, we describe the mitochondrial genome of the European house dust mite
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, the most important member of this largely neglected group.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of D. pteronyssinus is a circular DNA molecule of 14,203 bp. It contains the
complete set of 37 genes (13 protein coding genes, 2 rRNA genes and 22 tRNA genes), usually present in
metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial gene order differs considerably from that of other Acari
mitochondrial genomes. Compared to the mitochondrial genome of Limulus polyphemus, considered as the
ancestral arthropod pattern, only 11 of the 38 gene boundaries are conserved. The majority strand has a 72.6%
AT-content but a GC-skew of 0.194. This skew is the reverse of that normally observed for typical animal
mitochondrial genomes. A microsatellite was detected in a large non-coding region (286 bp), which probably
functions as the control region. Almost all tRNA genes lack a T-arm, provoking the formation of canonical
cloverleaf tRNA-structures, and both rRNA genes are considerably reduced in size. Finally, the genomic sequence
was used to perform a phylogenetic study. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analysis clustered D.
pteronyssinus with Steganacarus magnus, forming a sistergroup of the Trombidiformes.
Conclusion: Although the mitochondrial genome of D. pteronyssinus shares different features with previously
characterised Acari mitochondrial genomes, it is unique in many ways. Gene order is extremely rearranged and
represents a new pattern within the Acari. Both tRNAs and rRNAs are truncated, corroborating the theory of
the functional co-evolution of these molecules. Furthermore, the strong and reversed GC- and AT-skews suggest
the inversion of the control region as an evolutionary event. Finally, phylogenetic analysis using concatenated mt
gene sequences succeeded in recovering Acari relationships concordant with traditional views of phylogeny of
Acari.

Background
Approximately 48,000 mite and tick species (Arthropoda:
Chelicerata: Arachnida: Acari) [1,2] have been described
to this day. Since the number of undescribed species is
thought to be twenty-fold higher, this subclass is by far the
most species-rich group among the Arachnida [2]. Acari
diversified 400 million years ago and currently three
major lineages are recognised: Opilioacariformes, Acariformes and Parasitiformes [2,3]. The Acariformes comprise two major groups, the Trombidiformes and
Sarcoptiformes [2,4]. Two of the most prominent members of the Sarcoptiformes are the European house dust
mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trouessart, 1897)
and the American house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae (Hughes, 1961), both belonging to the family of the
Pyroglyphidae (cohort Astigmata). Pyroglyphid mites are
typical inhabitants of animal nests. In the human environment, they are mainly found in upholstery, textile
floor covers and beddings, where they primarily feed on
the skin scale fraction in house dust [5]. About 40 years
ago, house dust mites were first recognized as one of the
major sources of allergens in house dust [6]. The allergenic proteins are found in high concentrations in mite
faeces, which, after drying and pulverizing, become airborne and can be inhaled. The presence of these allergens
in sensitive persons is able to cause diseases like asthma,
dermatitis and rhinitis [7,8]. In countries with a temperate
climate, 6 to 35 per cent of the population is sensitive to
house dust mite-derived allergens [9].
Complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences are
becoming increasingly important for effective evolutionary and population studies. Mt genome sequences are not
only more informative than shorter sequences of individual genes, they also provide sets of genome-level characters, such as the relative position of different genes, RNA
secondary structures and modes of control of replication
and transcription [10-13]. However, the applicability of
mt genomes as a marker of highly divergent lineages is
still controversial [14,15] and remains to be elucidated
[16]. In addition, unravelling mt genomes can be of economic importance as well, since several chemical classes
of pesticides target mt proteins. Well-known acaricides
like acequinocyl and fluacrypyrim affect mt electron transport through the inhibition of the mt encoded cytochrome b in complex III [17]. Also, the economically
important class of METI (Mitochondrial Electron Transfer
Inhibitors)-acaricides target the mt complex I, although
their exact molecular target has not yet been elucidated.
Recently, resistance to the acaricide bifenazate was shown
to be caused by mutations in the mt encoded cytochrome
b and to have evolved rapidly through a short stage of mt
heteroplasmy [18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

At present, the mt genomes of 20 species belonging to the
Acari are available at NCBI ([19], status January 10, 2009).
Most of the submitted sequences have the typical features
of metazoan mt genomes. They are circular, between 13
and 20 kb in length, contain a coding region with 37
genes (22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and 13 protein coding genes)
and a relatively small non-coding region. The latter is
mostly AT-rich and fulfils a role in the initiation of replication and transcription [20,21]. Compared to this typical
configuration, the mt genomes of Steganacarus magnus,
Metaseiulus occidentalis and Leptotrombidium pallidum show
some abnormal features. S. magnus lacks 16 of the 22
tRNAs normally present in mt genomes [22]. M. occidentalis has a unusually large mt genome (24.9 kb) resulting
from a duplication event of a large fragment of the codon
region. Despite its large size, genes coding for nad6 and
nad3 were not found during the initial annotation process
[23]. L. pallidum on the other hand has 38 mt genes due to
a duplication of the 16S-rRNA [24].
In this study, we analyse the complete mt genome of a
member of the Sarcoptiformes, the European house dust
mite D. pteronyssinus, after obtaining the complete
sequence using a long PCR approach.

Results and discussion
Genome organisation
The mt genome of D. pteronyssinus was amplified, using
long PCR, in three overlapping fragments. The final
assembled sequence was 14,203 bp [GenBank:
EU884425; Fig. 1], making it the fifth smallest sequenced
genome within the Acari. Only the mt genomes of Tetranychus urticae (13,103 bp), Leptotrombidium akamushi
(13,698 bp), Leptotrombidium deliense (13,731 bp) and S.
magnus (13,818 bp) are smaller (Table 1 [25-27]). As nonspecific amplification artefacts and incomplete coverage
of genes are well-known drawbacks of a PCR approach
[28], we checked the genome size by restriction digest on
rolling circle amplified mtDNA (Fig. 2). This approach
confirmed the sequence size, considering that the relative
mobility of mtDNA restriction fragments can show slight
(5–12%) deviations compared to their sequence length
[29]. The mt genome of D. pteronyssinus is the first mt
sequence of a mite belonging to the Astigmata and is
together with the mt genome of S. magnus the only representative from the order of the Sarcoptiformes. Adding
this genome to the database resulted in 21 publicly available Acari mtDNA sequences. Twelve belong to species in
the superorder of the Parasitiformes whereas nine –
among which D. pteronyssinus – belong to species in the
superorder of the Acariformes.

All 37 genes present in a standard metazoan mt genome
could be identified (Fig. 1). Gene overlap exists between
trnD/atp8 (1 bp), trnR/nad3 (17 bp), trnM/trnS2 (12 bp),

trnP/trnV (11 bp), trnV/trnK (7 bp), trnW/trnY (1 bp),
trnY/nad1 (4 bp), trnI/trnQ (1 bp) and trnL1/trnC (5 bp).
No overlap was found between protein coding genes.
Small non-coding regions (> 20 bp) are present between
trnS2/trnA (25 bp), trnA/trnP (20 bp) and nad1/nad6 (28
bp). A large non-coding region is positioned between trnF
and trnS1 (286 bp). Twenty-five genes of the mt genome
of D. pteronyssinus are transcribed on the majority strand
(J-strand), whereas the others are oriented on the minority strand (N-strand).
The mt genome of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus
is considered to represent the ground pattern for arthropod mt genomes [30,31]. Comparing the D. pteronyssinus
genome to this sequence revealed that only 11 of the 38
gene boundaries in L. polyphemus are conserved in D. pteronyssinus (Fig. 3 [32]). Moreover, by making use of the
pattern search function in the Mitome-database ([33], status January 10, 2009), the mt gene order of D. pteronyssinus appeared to be unique among arthropods.
Remarkably, the relative position of trnL2 (between nad1
and 16S-rRNA), which differentiates the Chelicerata, Myriapoda and Onychophora from the Insecta and Crustacea
according to Boore [12,34], is not conserved. However,
Boore's hypothesis was based on mt genome data from
only 2 Chelicerata that were available in 1998. At present,
41 complete chelicerate mt genomes are available in the
NCBI-database ([19], status January 10, 2009). Out of
these, only 29 depict the specific arrangement of trnL2
between nad1 and 16S-rRNA (see additional file 1 for an
overview of gene arrangements of chelicerate mt
genomes). This illustrates that care should be taken when
general rules are deduced from limited datasets.
Mt gene arrangements have already provided strong support toward the resolution of several long-standing controversial phylogenetic relationships [12]. Surprisingly,
the mt gene order of D. pteronyssinus differs considerably
from that of other mites (see additional file 1). Comparing the D. pteronyssinus mt genome to the mt sequence of
the oribatid S. magnus [22], the closest relative of D. pteronyssinus, revealed that only 6 of the 22 gene boundaries
in S. magnus are conserved in D. pteronyssinus (Fig. 3).
Extending this analysis to the other Acari mt genomes
showed that in several cases the set of neighboured genes
that were not separated during the evolution [35] was
greater between members of different superorders (e.g. D.
pteronyssinus (Acariformes) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus
(Parasitiformes)) than between members of the same
superorder (e.g. D. pteronyssinus (Acariformes) and T. urticae (Acariformes)) (Table2). Exclusion of tRNAs in our
analysis showed a similar trend, suggesting that protein
coding genes were also involved in mt gene rearrangements. These results indicate that mt gene orders seem less

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

useful for deduction of phylogenetic relationships
between superorders within the Acari. However, comparing gene order might be more powerful to establish phylogenetic relations within families, as was previously
proposed [14,36]. In the case of the Ixodidae family, it
was shown that the division of Prostriata (Ixodes sp.) and
Metastriata (R. sanguineus, Amblyomma triguttatum, Haemaphysalis flava) could be linked to mt gene arrangements
[37,38].
Base composition and codon usage
The overall AT-content of the mt genome of D. pteronyssinus is 72.6% (Table 1). This is within the range of the average AT-content of Acari mt genomes (74.6 +/- 4.0%). The
high AT-content is reflected in the codon usage (Table
3 [39]) with nucleotides 'A' and 'T' preferred over 'C' and
'G' on the wobble position and the predominant use of
codons deficient in 'C' or 'G'. For example, the most frequently used codons are TTT (F) (105 codons per 1000
codons) and TTA (L2) (78 codons per 1000 codons).

Metazoan mt genomes usually present a clear strand bias
in nucleotide composition [40]. This is probably due to
asymmetric patterns of mutations during transcription
and replication when one strand remains transiently in a
single-stranded state, making it more vulnerable to DNA
damage [41]. However, in the case of mtDNA-replication,
this hypothesis is not without controversy [42-45]. The
strand bias in nucleotide composition can be measured as
GC- and AT-skews ((G%-C%)/(G%+C%) and (A%-T%)/
(A%+T%), respectively) [46]. The overall GC- and ATskews of the J-strand of the D. pteronyssinus mt genome are
0.194 and -0.199, respectively. These are the most extreme
values encountered within mite mt genomes up till now
(Table 1) and they are reversed compared to the usual
strand biases of metazoan mtDNA (negative GC-skew and
positive AT-skew for the J-strand). Moreover, a positive
GC-skew for mite mt genomes seems to be rare since at
present, it was only encountered in Varroa destructor.
Although hypothetical, it could be the result of a strand
swap of the control region [40]. This region contains all
initiation sites for transcription [47] and an inversion of
the control region is expected to produce a global reversal
of asymmetric mutational constraints in the mtDNA,
resulting with time in a complete reversal of strand compositional bias [40]. The asymmetrical directional mutation pressure is also reflected in the codon usage of genes
oriented in opposite directions [48]. Whereas NNG and
NNU codons are preferred over NNA and NNC codons on
the J-strand, genes on the N-strand show the exact opposite trend (see additional file 2 for an across-strand (N and
J) comparison of frequencies of codons ending with the
same nucleotide).

amino acid code, with L1 = CUN; L2 = UUR; S1 = AGN; S2 = UCN. RNAs on the N-strand are underlined. Numbers at gene
junctions indicate the length of small non-coding regions where negative numbers indicate overlap between genes. A-,T-,G- and
C-content of the mt genome is represented using a red, blue, green and purple colour graded circle, respectively. Black curved
lines on the outside of these circles represent mt genome coverage by Dermatophagoides ESTs (see additional file 5 for
sequences of Dermatophagoides ESTs covering the mt genome of D. pteronyssinus).

DNA of2 digest of rolling circle amplified mitochondrial
Restriction pteronyssinus
Restriction digest of rolling circle amplified mitochondrial DNA of D. pteronyssinus. Rolling circle amplified mtDNA, undigested (lane 3) and digested with XmnI
(lane2) and EcoRI (lane 4). Molecular marker used was MassRuler DNA ladder Mix (Fermentas) (lane 1).

Protein coding genes
Nine proteins are encoded by genes on the J-strand (cox1,
cox2, cox3, atp6, atp8, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5), while
four are encoded by genes on the N-strand (nad1, nad6,
nad2, cytB). The total length (10,826 bp) and AT-content
(71.61%) of the protein-coding genes are within the range
of values typical for Acari (10,639.0 +/- 272.0 bp; 74.0 +/
- 4.0%, respectively) (Table 1). Compared to other mite
mt proteins, cox1, cox2 and cytB are best conserved. On
the other hand, atp8, nad6 and nad4L showed lowest similarity values (see additional file 3 for the average identity
and similarity % of mt proteins of D. pteronyssinus).

Start and stop codons were determined based on alignments with the corresponding genes and proteins of other
mite species. In the case of stop codons, we could also
benefit from available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of
D. pteronyssinus (n = 1797) and D. farinae (n = 1735) (Fig.
1) [49]. As for other metazoan mt proteins, unorthodox
initiation codons are used [20] (see additional file 4 for
start and stop codons of protein coding genes of Acari mt
genomes). Eight genes (cox2, atp6, cox3, nad3, nad6,
nad4L, nad4, cytB) use the standard ATG start codon, 3
genes (cox1, nad1, nad2) start with ATA and nad5 initiates
with ATT. atp8 most likely starts with codon TTG.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

Eleven genes employ a complete translation termination
codon, either TAG (cox1, cox3) or TAA (cox2, atp8, atp6,
nad1, nad3, nad6, nad4L, nad5, cytB). With the exception
of nad3, atp8 and nad4L, D. pteronyssinus ESTs for all these
genes confirmed the position of the stop codon (Fig. 1, see
additional file 5 for sequences of Dermatophagoides ESTs
covering the mt genome of D. pteronyssinus). Berthier et al.
[50] showed that the adjacent genes, nad4L/nad4 and
atp8/atp6, were transcribed and translated as a bicistronic
mRNA in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster.
However, as no ESTs were found that aligned with the
nad4L/nad4 and atp8/atp6 gene boundaries, it could not be
confirmed whether this was also the case for D. pteronyssinus. Despite its efficiency, the use of sequence alignments
to determine the position of stop codons resulted in several cases in overlapping genes. For example, based on a
highly conserved tryptophan at the C-terminal end of
Acari nad3 proteins, a stop codon was positioned despite
the resulting 17 bp overlap with trnaR. The two remaining
genes (nad2 and nad4) are likely equipped with a truncated stop codon (T). Polyadenylation of the mRNA is
needed in these cases to form a fully functional TAA stop
codon [51]. Although speculative, ESTs of D. farinae confirm the truncated stop of nad4 (Fig. 1, see additional file
5).
Transfer RNAs
Fourteen tRNAs are encoded on the J-strand and 8 on the
N-strand (Fig. 1). Secondary structures were predicted for
all tRNAs (Fig. 4). With the exception of trnS1 (UCU
instead of GCU in L. pallidum) and trnP (UGG instead of
AGG in S. magnus), all anticodon sequences were identical
to those of L. pallidum and S. magnus, the only acariform
mites for which tRNA secondary structures have been
reported [22,24]. Usually, T is in the first anticodon position for tRNAs that recognise either four-fold degenerate
codon families or NNR codons. G is usually in this position only to specifically recognize NNY-codons [52].
Except for trnM, all of the D. pteronyssinus mt tRNAs follow
this pattern. trnM has the anticodon CAT (to recognise
both ATG and ATA), which is the case for almost all animal mt systems [52] (Fig. 4).

Only one tRNA lacks the D-arm: trnS1, as is common for
most metazoans. With the exception of trnC, trnV and
trnS1, all tRNAs have T-arm variable loops (TV replacement loops) instead of the T-arm. Similar structures were
found for tRNAs of L. pallidum [24] and S. magnus [22].
The absence of the T-arm is a typical feature for tRNAs of
Chelicerata belonging to the orders of the Araneae, Scorpiones and Thelyphonida. However, other taxa within the
Chelicerata (Amblypygi, Opiliones, Ricinulei, Solifugae
and ticks) possess typical metazoan cloverleaf tRNAs [13].
Masta and Boore [13] suggested a multi-step evolutionary
process in an attempt to understand how so many tRNAs

Mitochondrial gene arrangement of Limulus polyphemus, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Steganacarus
magnus. Graphical linearisation of mt genomes is presented according to [32]. Gene sizes are not drawn to scale. J stands for
majority and N for minority strand. Protein coding and rRNA genes are abbreviated as in the abbreviations section. tRNA
genes are abbreviated using the one-letter amino acid code, with L1 = CUN; L2 = UUR; S1 = AGN; S2 = UCN. White boxes
represent genes with the same relative position as in the arthropod ground pattern, L. polyphemus. Light-gray boxes represent
genes that changed positions relative to L. polyphemus; dark-gray boxes represent genes that changed both position and orientation. Circular dots between the genes of D. pteronyssinus represent conserved gene boundaries compared to L. polyphemus.
Square dots between the genes of S. magnus represent conserved gene boundaries compared to D. pteronyssinus.

in these chelicerate groups could lose their T-arm. According to this speculative theory, changes in mt ribosomes,
resulting in the fact that the loss of arms from tRNAs was

tolerated [53,54], and/or changes in specific elongation
factors [55-57] are considered as a first step in this process.

Figure secondary structures of the 22 mitochondrial tRNAs from D. pteronyssinus
Inferred secondary structures of the 22 mitochondrial tRNAs from D. pteronyssinus. tRNAs are shown in the order
of occurrence in the mt genome starting from cox1. Locations of adjacent gene boundaries are indicated with arrows. Green
font indicates that the sequence is part of the adjacent gene. Inferred Watson-Crick bonds are illustrated by lines, whereas GU
bonds are illustrated by dots.

Only 7 of the 22 tRNAs have a completely matched 7 bp
acceptor stem (trnG, trnW, trnH, trnF, trnE, trnL1 and
trnL2). A maximum of 3 mismatches in this stem is found
in trnR. In contrast, almost all tRNAs (18) possess a completely matched 5 bp anticodon stem. trnC, trnS1 and trnN
have a single mismatch whereas trnY has two mismatches
in this stem. All tRNAs, except trnL2, have a symmetric
anticodon loop consisting of 2 bp up- and 2 bp downstream of the 3 bp anticodon. The anticodon loop of trnL2
consists of 2 nucleotides preceding the anticodon and 3
nucleotides immediately following it. This kind of aberrant anticodon loops have also been reported for the twohumped camel Camelus bactrianus ferus (trnS2) [58] and
the scorpion Mesobuthus gibbosus (trnH and trnN) [59]. As
mentioned before, sequences of some tRNAs overlap with
neighbouring genes. The extreme examples are trnR, trnS2
and trnV. trnR overlaps with the adjacent gene nad3 on the
same strand for 17 bp at its 3'-end whereas trnS2 overlaps
with the adjacent gene trnM on the same strand for 12 bp
at its 3'-end. trnV overlaps with the adjacent gene trnP on
the opposite strand for 11 bp at its 3'-end and with trnK
on the opposite strand for 7 bp at its 5'-start. Despite these
overlaps, we consider these genes not likely to be pseudogenes. First of all, their sequence is relatively well conserved when compared to corresponding genes of other
Acari. Secondly, besides sequence conservation they
depict a conserved secondary structure. Thirdly, an EST
[GenBank: CB284825] of the related species D. farinae
was found corresponding to the region covering trnR,
trnM and trnS2 of D. pteronyssinus indicating that the genes
are expressed (see additional file 6 for an alignment of
trnR, trnM and trnS2 of D. pteronyssinus with an EST of D.
farinae). Finally, and most importantly, stem mismatches
and sequence overlap are not uncommon for mt tRNAs of
arachnids [13,60], and are probably repaired by a posttranscriptional editing process [54,61].
Non-coding regions
The largest non-coding region (286 bp) is flanked by trnF
and trnS1. It is highly enriched in AT (91.61%) and can
form stable stem-loop secondary structures. Based on
these features, it possibly functions as a control region
[20,62]. With the exception of T. urticae (95.45%), it has
the highest AT-content of all Acari mt control regions
(Table 1). The position of the non-coding region differs
from most insect and arachnid mt genomes, where the
region is mostly located in close proximity to 12S-rRNA
([62], see additional file 1).

Based on the sequence pattern, the control region can be
subdivided in a repeat region and a stem-loop region. The
first region (11,491–11,528 bp) contains several ATrepeats. In order to verify the exact number of repeats we
resequenced this region. For this purpose, two flanking
primers, Dp-Ms-F and Dp-Ms-R, were synthesised span-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

ning approximately 700 bp. The PCR product was cloned
and ten independent clones were sequenced. This
revealed that the number of AT-repeats varied between 7
to 28, suggesting that this domain can be considered as a
microsatellite [63]. This is remarkable as a mt microsatellite was never reported before for species belonging to the
Chelicerata. Also in metazoan mtDNA such microsatellites are rare and have, to our knowledge, only been
reported for butterflies [64], a dragonfish, Scleropages formosus [65], a bat, Myotis bechsteinii [66], a turtle,
Pelomedusa subrufa [67] and several seal species [68-70].
The second region (11,529–11,768 bp) holds two short
palindromic sequences, TACAT and ATGTA, which are
conserved in mt genomes of mammals [71] and fishes
[65,72]. They can form a stable stem-loop structure (Fig.
5-A2), which might be involved as a recognition site for
the arrest of J-strand synthesis [71]. Near this region other
stem-loop structures could be folded (Fig. 5-A) but none
of them had flanking sequences similar to those that are
conserved in the control region of the mt genome of
insects [62] and metastriate ticks [37].
As described before, four other stretches of non-coding
nucleotides were found outside the control region. These
short sequences can fold into stable stem-loop structures
(Fig. 5-B, C, D) which may function as splicing recognition sites during processing of the transcripts [73].
Ribosomal RNAs
12S-rRNA and 16S-rRNA are located on the J-strand. This
does not coincide with their position in most Chelicerata
where they are located on the N-strand (see additional file
1). The AT-contents of both genes are comparable (72.9%
and 76.1% for the 12S- and 16S-RNA, respectively) and
are within the range of rRNAs of other Acari (76.5 +/4.2%; 78.0 +/- 4.1%, respectively). The sizes of the rRNAs
(665 bp and 1078 bp) are slightly larger than those of
other acariform mite rRNAs (626.0 +/- 29.9 bp and
1018.5 +/- 21.3 bp) but are shorter than those found in
the Parasitiformes (706.0 +/- 17.5 bp and 1207.3 +/- 31.4
bp) (Table 1).

The 12S-rRNA and 16S-rRNA genes of Leptotrombidium
species (Acariformes: Trombidiformes: Trombiculidae)
are 23.4% and 23.5% shorter than their counterparts in
Drosophila yakuba. This substantial reduction is mainly
caused by the loss of stem-loop structures at the 5'-end of
the rRNA genes [74]. To identify whether similar domains
are absent in the rRNAs of D. pteronyssinus, we constructed
their secondary structures (Fig. 6 [75,76]). This revealed
that the D. pteronyssinus 12S-rRNA indeed lacks similar
stem-loops as L. pallidum, compared to D. yakuba. The
structure also revealed 1 additional stem-loop (stem-loop
1) not present in 12S-rRNA of L. pallidum. Like in L. palli-

dum, one stem-loop replaces three stem-loops (24, 25 and
26) whereas another replaces a region of four stem-loops
(39, 40, 41 and 42) of the D. yakuba 12S-rRNA [74]. Based
on the modelled structure in combination with an alignment of other acariform 12S-rRNAs, the greatest sequence
conservation was found in the loop region of stem-loops
21 and 27 and the region between stem-loops 48 and 50.

In analogy to the 16S-rRNA gene of L. pallidum, the main
deletions of the D. pteronyssinus 16S-rRNA are located at
the 5'-end. With the exception of D19, all stem-loops of L.
pallidum are present in D. pteronyssinus. We also discovered
three additional stem-loops (C1, E2 and E19) which are
absent in the 16S-rRNA of L. pallidum. The 3'-end of the
16S-rRNA structure is best conserved compared to other
acariform 16S-rRNAs. This is in agreement with the idea
that this region is the main component of the peptidyl-

transferase centre, and as such most vulnerable to mutations [73]. Recently, the 12S-rRNA and 16S-rRNA secondary structures of S. magnus have been published [22]. The
12S-rRNA structure of S. magnus has 5 extra stem-loops (2,
4, 5, 40 and 42) compared to the one of D. pteronyssinus
whereas the 16S-rRNA lacks 6 stem-loops (D4, D16, E1,
E2, E19 and G9) and has 5 stem-loops (cd1, D1, D17,
D19, G13) not present in the 16S-rRNA of D. pteronyssinus.
It is still an open question how relatively well-conserved
structures such as rRNAs can dramatically decrease in size
while remaining functional. Wolstenholme et al. [53] and
Masta [54] suggested a correlation between the occurrence
of truncated rRNAs (compared to Drosophila) and the loss
of the T-arm in tRNAs. The coincidence of short rRNAs
and missing T-arms in tRNAs was also observed in S. magnus, L. pallidum and D. pteronyssinus. Other acariform
mites like T. urticae, Ascoschoengastia sp. and Walchia hayashii also exhibit short rRNAs (Table 1) and the prediction
of their tRNA secondary structures could further support
this hypothesis. However, examples contradicting this
hypothesis also occur e.g. pulmonate gastropods with
tRNAs lacking T-arms have no truncated rRNAs. Therefore, it remains possible that truncation of both tRNAs
and rRNA genes only reflects an independent trend
towards minimisation of the mt genome as suggested by
Yamazaki et al. [77].
Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotide
and amino acid sequences from all mt protein coding
genes of Acari. The ILD-test [78] indicated a significant
incongruence (P = 0.01) among data set partitions for
nucleotide alignments and low congruence (P = 0.07)
among data set partitions for amino acid alignments. A
considerable debate exists on the utility of this test [7984]. However, the principle of Kluge [85] implies that all
data should always be included in a combined analysis for
any phylogenetic problem and therefore we combined
data partitions for both amino acid and nucleotide alignments for phylogenetic analysis. A maximum parsimony
(MP) analysis based on nucleotide alignments (data not
shown) grouped V. destructor (Parasitiformes) within the
Acariformes, close to D. pteronyssinus. This is in contrast
with the generally accepted view on the phylogeny of the
Acariformes and Parasitiformes [2,3]. As mentioned
before, V. destructor and D. pteronyssinus both have a
reversal of asymmetrical mutation pattern. When such
reversals occurred independently, D. pteronyssinus and V.
destructor could have acquired a similar base composition
and as a consequence group together due to the longbranch attraction (LBA) phenomenon [40,86]. Modelbased methods such as maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian inference (BI) are less sensitive to LBA [40,87]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

and were for this reason considered for phylogenetic analysis.
ML and BI analysis performed on the amino acid data set
resolved trees with an identical topology (Fig. 7-A) in
which D. pteronyssinus clusters with S. magnus, forming a
sistergroup of the Trombidiformes. This is in agreement
with the most recent views on the classification of the
Acariformes [2-4]. The nucleotide data set resulted in similar trees, confirming the evolutionary position of D. pteronyssinus (Fig. 7-B). The only major inconsistency over the
trees was the position of T. urticae. Although this species is
generally considered as a member of the Trombidiformes
[2-4], it was clustered with the sarcoptiform mites D. pteronyssinus and S. magnus in the trees based on the nucleotide dataset. (Fig. 7-B). However, the position in the
different trees is questionable as it is supported by low
bootstrap values/Bayesian posterior probabilities (Fig. 7A/B). Adding additional mt genome data from closely
related taxa of T. urticae and from taxa located between T.
urticae and Trombiculidae would probably position T.
urticae with higher support values within the Trombidiformes.
In the trees based on the nucleotide dataset, H. flava is,
compared to A. triguttatum, evolutionary closer related to
R. sanguineus while in the trees based on the amino acid
dataset this is the opposite. However, as the clustering of
H. flava and R. sanguineus is in agreement with the most
recent views on the classification of the Ixodida [88,89],
we consider the nucleotide topology as the most correct
one. Murrell et al. [90] considers the Parasitiformes to be
paraphyletic with respect to the Opilioacariformes, but as
there are no complete mt genomes of Opilioacariformes
available, we were not able to verify this hypothesis.

Conclusion
This is the first description of a complete mt genome of a
species belonging to the Astigmata, a cohort within the
Sarcoptiformes. Although the length, gene and AT-content are similar to other Acari mtDNA, the mt genome of
D. pteronyssinus exhibits some interesting features. The
gene order of D. pteronyssinus is completely different from
that of other Acari mt genomes. Gene order comparison
indicated that mt gene orders seem less useful for deduction of phylogenetic relationships between superorders
within the Acari. GC- and AT-skews of the J-strand were
very large and reversed as compared to those found in
most metazoan mtDNA.
Compared to parasitiform mites, both D. pteronyssinus
rRNAs were considerably shorter and almost all transfer
RNAs lacked the T-arm. It would be interesting to investigate whether the occurrence of truncated rRNAs and the
loss of the T-arm in tRNAs are correlated or just a trend

toward minimisation of the mt genome. Finally, phylogenetic analysis using concatenated mt gene sequences succeeded in recovering Acari relationships concordant with
traditional views of phylogeny of Acari.

Methods
Mite identification
Upon arrival in the laboratory, mites were identified as D.
pteronyssinus by J. Witters (ILVO, Belgium) and F. Th. M.
Spieksma (Laboratory of Aerobiology, LUMC, The Netherlands) using morphological characteristics. To back up
this identification, molecular techniques were applied.
For this purpose DNA was extracted and used as a template for PCR. Primers 12SID-F and 12SID-R (see additional file 7 for primer sequences) successfully amplified
a 316 bp fragment. BLASTn searches against non-redundant nucleotide sequences using the amplified fragment
as query resulted in a perfect match with a mt 12S-rRNA
sequence of D. pteronyssinus [GenBank: AF529911].
Mite strain, mass rearing and isolation
The initial D. pteronyssinus culture was provided by D.
Bylemans (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Belgium). Mites were
cultured on a 1:1 mixture of Premium Gold (Vitacraft,
Germany) and beard shavings at 75% R.H., 25°C and permanent dark conditions [91,92]. Mites were isolated from
the colony using a modified heat-escape technique
[93,94]. Briefly, mite cultures were transferred to small
plastic petri dishes (75 mm in diameter, 28 mm high)
with a lid on top. These dishes were placed in the dark on
a hot plate set at 45°C (Bekso, Belgium). After 15–20
minutes the mites moved away from the heat source,
formed groups on the lid of the petri dish and could be
collected using a fine hair brush.
DNA extraction
Approximately 1000 D. pteronyssinus mites were collected
in an Eppendorf tube and were ground in 800 μl SDS-lysis
buffer (400 mM NaCl, 200 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 2%
SDS) using a small sterile plastic pestle (Eppendorf, Germany). After incubation for 30 min at 60°C under continuous rotation, a standard phenol-chloroform extraction
was performed [95]. Total genomic DNA was precipitated
with 0.7 volumes of isopropanol at 4°C for 1 hour, centrifuged for 45 minutes at 21,000 × g and washed with
70% ethanol. Precipitated DNA was resolved in 50 μl 0.1
M Tris pH 8.2.
PCR
Standard PCR (amplicon < 500 bp) was performed in 50
μl volumes (38.5 μl double-distilled water; 5 μl buffer; 2
mM MgCl2; 0.2 mM dNTP-mix; 0.2 μM of each primer; 1
μl template DNA and 0.5 μl Taq polymerase (Invitrogen,
Belgium). PCR conditions were as follows: 2' 94°C, 35 ×
(20" 92°C, 30" 53°C, 1' 72°C) and 2' 72°C. The anneal-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

ing time was extended to 1 minute and the primer concentration was increased to 2 μM when degenerate primers
were used. Long PCR (amplicon > 500 bp) was performed
with the Expand Long Range Kit (Roche, Switzerland) in
50 μl volumes (28.5 μl double-distilled water; 10 μl
buffer; 0.5 mM dNTP-mix; 0.3 μM of each primer; 4 μl
100% DMSO; 1 μl template DNA and 1 μl enzyme-mix).
PCR conditions were: 2' 94°C, 10 × (10" 92°C, 20" at a
temperature that varies depending on the primers, 1'/kb
58°C), 25 × (10" 92°C, 20" at a temperature that varies
depending on the primers, 1'/kb 58°C with 20" added for
every consecutive cycle) and 7' 58°C. All PCR products
were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and
visualised by EtBr staining. Fragments (amplicon < 1000
bp) of interest were excised from gel, purified with the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Belgium) and
cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Belgium). After
heat-shock transformation of E. coli (DH5α) cells, plasmid DNA was obtained by miniprep and inserted fragments were sequenced with SP6 and T7-primers. Long
PCR products were sequenced by primer-walking. All
sequencing reactions were performed by AGOWA
sequencing service.
Amplification of the mt genome
Primers COXI-F and 12S-R, based on partial D. pteronyssinus cox1 and 12S-rRNA sequences [GenBank: AY525570
and AF529911, respectively] (see additional file 7 for
primer sequences), successfully amplified a 4.6 kb
sequence of the mt genome of D. pteronyssinus. Degenerate
primers CYTB-F-Deg and CYTB-R-Deg (see additional file
7 for primer sequences), designed on conserved regions of
Acari cytB, amplified a partial cytB sequence from D. pteronyssinus. A specific primer COXI-R, designed from the 3'
end of the 4.5 kb sequence in combination with the
primer CYTB-F, designed from the partial cytB sequence,
successfully amplified a 2.2 kb sequence. Another primer
CYTB-R, designed from the 5'-end of this 2.2 kb sequence,
in combination with the primer 12S-F successfully amplified a 8.6 kb sequence, making the mt genome sequence
complete.
Annotation and bioinformatics analysis
The complete genomic sequence was assembled and
annotated using VectorNTI (Invitrogen, Belgium) according to Masta and Boore [60]. Open reading frames (ORFs)
were identified with the program Getorf from the
EMBOSS-package [96]. The obtained ORFs were used as
query in BLASTp [97] searches against the non-redundant
protein database at NCBI. Two large non-protein-coding
regions were candidates for the rRNAs (16S and 12S
respectively). The boundaries were identified based on
alignments and secondary structures of rRNA genes of
other mite species. Sixteen of the 22 tRNAs were identified
by tRNA-scan SE [98] with a cove cutoff score of 0.1 and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:107

the tRNA-model set to "nematode mito". The remaining
tRNAs (trnM, trnV, trnY, trnS1, trnI, trnC) were determined
in the unannotated regions by sequence similarity to
tRNAs of other mite species. In order to obtain additional
information on mt gene boundaries, BLASTn [97]
searches of D. pteronyssinus tRNA, rRNA and protein
encoding nucleotide sequences were carried out against
ESTs [49] restricted to Dermatophagoides sequences (n =
3532). ESTs with statistically significant matches (E-value
cutoff: 0.1) were collected, checked for vector contamination and aligned by Clustal W [99] as implemented in
BioEdit 7.0.1 [100] against the appropriate nucleotide
sequence of D. pteronyssinus. MatGAT 2.02 was used to calculate similarity and identity values [101] of mt proteins.
The identification of gene subsets that appear consecutively in different genomes was performed by common
interval distance analysis using CREx [102] (see additional file 8 for input data of the CREx program).
Construction of secondary structures of RNAs and noncoding regions
Secondary structures of tRNAs were determined following
the method of Masta and Boore [60]. Secondary structures
of tRNAs were drawn with CorelDraw 12.0 (Corel Corporation, Canada). The rRNA genes of D. pteronyssinus were
aligned with those of other Acariformes and conserved
areas were identified. These regions were mapped on the
published structures of L. pallidum rRNA [74]. Regions
lacking significant homology were folded using Mfold
[103]. Secondary structures of rRNAs were drawn using
the RnaViz2 program [104] and afterwards modified with
CorelDraw 12.0 (Corel Corporation, Canada). Secondary
structures of non-coding regions were folded using Mfold
[103]. When multiple secondary structures were possible,
the most stable (lowest free energy (-ΔG)) one was preferred. Drawing and editing of these structures was done
in a similar way as for rRNA secondary structures.
Rolling circle amplification and restriction enzyme
digestion
Extraction and rolling circle amplification of the mtDNA
of D. pteronyssinus was done according to Van Leeuwen et
al. [18]. Rolling circle amplified mtDNA was digested
with two enzymes (XmnI and EcoRI; New England
Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Restriction digests were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis as described before.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/107

genes were used in phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid
sequences and nucleotide sequences were aligned by
Clustal W [99] as implemented in BioEdit 7.0.1 [100]. The
nucleotide alignment was generated based on the protein
alignment using codon alignment. Ambiguously aligned
parts were omitted from the analysis by making use of
Gblocks 0.91b [105], with default block parameters
except for changing "allowed gap positions" to "with
half". Abascal et al. [106] recently presented evidence that
some insects and ticks use a modified mitochondrial
code, with AGG coding for lysine rather than serine as in
the standard invertebrate mitochondrial code. As 10 out
of 20 Acari species in our dataset are ticks all positions
aligning to AGG codons in the final amino acid alignment
were removed.
For the nucleotide alignments the "codons" option was
used in Gblocks 0.91b [105]. Due to the results of a saturation analysis [107] on single codon positions, implemented in DAMBE 4.2.13 [108], third codon positions
were eliminated from the nucleotide alignment. An
incongruence length difference test (ILD-test) [78] as
implemented in PAUP* (version 4.0b10; [109]) was used
to assess congruence among gene partitions.
Model selection was done with ProtTest 1.4 [110] for
amino acid sequences and with Modeltest 3.7 [111] for
nucleotide sequences. According to the Akaike information criterion, the mtART+G+I+F model was optimum for
phylogenetic analysis with amino acid alignments and the
GTR+I+G model was optimal for analysis with nucleotide
alignments.
Two different analyses were performed. (1) Maximum
likelihood (ML) analysis was performed using Treefinder
[112], bootstrapping with 1000 pseudoreplicates (2)
Bayesian inference (BI) was done with MrBayes 3.1.2
[113]. As the mtART model is not implemented in the current version of MrBayes, the mtREV+G+I model was used
for phylogenetic analysis with the amino acid alignment.
Four chains ran for 1,000,000 generations, while tree sampling was done every 100 generations. Burnin was calculated when the average standard deviation of split
frequencies had declined to < 0.01. The remaining trees
were used to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities
(BPP).
