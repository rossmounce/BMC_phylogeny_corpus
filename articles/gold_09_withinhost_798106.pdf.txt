Abstract
Background: Host individuals represent an arena in which pathogens compete for resources and
transmission opportunities, with major implications for the evolution of virulence and the structure
of populations. Studies to date have focused on competitive interactions within pathogen species,
and the level of antagonism tends to increase with the genetic distance between competitors.
Anther-smut fungi, in the genus Microbotryum, have emerged as a tractable model for within-host
competition. Here, using two pathogen species that are frequently found in sympatry, we
investigated whether the antagonism seen among genotypes of the same species cascades up to
influence competition among pathogen species.
Results: Sequential inoculation of hosts showed that a resident infection most often excludes a
challenging pathogen genotype, which is consistent with prior studies. However, the challenging
pathogen was significantly more likely to invade the already-infected host if the resident infection
was a conspecific genotype compared to challenges involving a closely related species. Moreover,
when inter-specific co-infection occurred, the pathogens were highly segregated within the host, in
contrast to intra-specific co-infection.
Conclusion: We show evidence that competitive exclusion during infection can be greater among
closely related pathogen species than among genotypes within species. This pattern follows from
prior studies demonstrating that genetic distance and antagonistic interactions are positively
correlated in Microbotryum. Fungal vegetative incompatibility is a likely mechanism of direct
competitive interference, and has been shown in some fungi to be effective both within and across
species boundaries. For systems where related pathogen species frequently co-occur in the same
host populations, these competitive dynamics may substantially impact the spatial segregation of
pathogen species.

Background
Infection of a single host by multiple pathogen genotypes
is a common phenomenon in a wide variety of diseases
[1-4]. Theoretical studies focus heavily on virulence evolution and the consequence of whether the different patho-

gen genotypes remain together within the host, i.e.
coinfection, or whether one competitively excludes the
other, i.e. superinfection [5-9]. Some models postulate
that genetic distance between pathogens determines
cooperative versus competitive interactions within the

individual host [10-12]. As pathogen genetic distance
increases, there should be greater evolutionary conflict
arising from sharing host resources, and thus enhanced
selection for higher rates of exploitation associated with
competition and virulence.
Only recently has a substantial number of empirical studies begun to describe within-host dynamics and help to
ground the many theoretical models with examples from
nature [2,13-15]. Pathogen genetic diversity has been
shown to influence both the outcome of competition and
whether a particular disease system assumes a coinfection
or superinfection model. Research has however primarily
focused on the intra-specific level of pathogen relatedness
[11,13,16,17].
Closely related pathogen species may also co-occur on the
same host due to host-shifts or speciation on a single host
(e.g. in prior allopatry), thus creating opportunities for
inter-specific competition. Examples include the frequent
coinfection by Plasmodium species in regions of high
malaria prevalence [3], which is associated with decreased
virulence by P. falciparum when experiencing within-host
competition against P. vivax [18,19]. Inter-specific competition has also been observed in the toad-polystome and
the snail-trematode host-pathogen systems [20,21].
Despite such recent findings, however, it remains unclear
for any particular study system whether antagonism seen
at the intra-specific level extends in a similar manner to
interactions among pathogen species. There are examples
of the non-self recognition and antagonistic mechanisms
fulfilling the same biological functions during intra- and
inter-specific interactions, such as cuticular hydrocarbons
in some insects [22] or the killing reactions of vegetative
incompatibility in some filamentous fungi [23-25]. However, the extent to which such broadly effective antagonistic mechanisms are important to the evolution of complex
disease systems remains largely unexplored.
An important model for within-host dynamics is the
anther-smut disease, caused by fungi of the genus Microbotryum that infect plants in the Caryophyllaceae
[1,16,17,26,27]. The fungus grows inside the meristematic regions of host plants and produces spores in the
developing flowers, which are then transmitted to healthy
plants by insect pollinators. Recent work has determined
that mechanisms of competitive exclusion can result
when the host is exposed to multiple pathogen genotypes
[26] and, moreover, that the antagonism increases with
genetic distance between pathogen genotypes of the same
species [16]. The Microbotryum genotype that first infects
the host most often excludes subsequent infections, and
exclusion is more likely with distantly related conspecific
genotypes. Within-host exclusion of less related genotypes
in Microbotryum also has consequences for the spatial sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/11

structuring of pathogen populations, with naturally coinfected hosts containing pathogens that are more closely
related than expected by chance alone [17].
Within the Microbotryum system, competition also exists
between pathogen species and thus over substantially
larger genetic distances than previously investigated with
regard to within-host dynamics. Host-shifts are common
[27-29], and some plant species are known to harbor multiple endemic species of Microbotryum [30,31]. The anthersmut disease of Silene vulgaris provides an excellent example, as several natural populations have been identified
that contained sympatric mixtures of two pathogen species, Microbotryum silenes-inflatae and Microbotryum lagerheimii [30,31].
In the present study we characterize competitive interactions both within and between the species of Microbotryum
found on S. vulgaris using sequential inoculations. By
assessing whether the pathogen is more likely to colonize
a host that is already infected by a member of the same or
different Microbotryum species, this study sheds new light
on whether the previously reported mechanisms of competition extend across species boundaries.

Results
Treatments that sequentially inoculated S. vulgaris plants
with combinations of two pathogen genotypes from
either of two Microbotryum species resulted in high rates of
infection (Table 1). It is among these diseased plants that
the outcome of within-host competition could be
assessed by using morphological and genetic markers that
discriminate each pathogen genotype used. Each control
treatment (sequentially receiving a single inoculum type
then water, or vice versa) resulted in infection rates of over
80%. Therefore, this source of host seeds was assumed
susceptible to all pathogen genotypes at each of the inoculation time points. The frequency of disease across plants
inoculated singly and repeatedly with the pathogen did
not differ significantly (Wald's X2 = 1.5, df = 1, P = 0.22).
One of the four inter-specific competitions (M. lagerheimii-1 then M. silenes-inflatae-2), suffered severe mortality
upon transfer from plate to soil, with one plant surviving
to flower; this treatment was removed from further analysis as the mortality is believed to be due to technical issues
during planting. The utility of morphological markers to
differentiate Microbotryum species in inter-specific competitions was confirmed by assaying teliospore germination
for all diseased plants of control treatments, which
matched their expected growth morphologies as shown in
Fig 1.
The "resident" infection (i.e. the first of sequential inoculations) was the only pathogen genotype detected in the
majority of plants for all treatments except the intra-spe-

cific treatment M. lagerheimii-1 then M. lagerheimii-2 (Fig.

successful establishment of the "challenge" infection was
detected significantly more often in intra-specific treatments than inter-specific treatments (Wald's X2 = 16.3, df
= 1, P < 0.001). The effect of genotype combinations
within intra- and inter-specific treatments was not significant (Wald's X2 = 1.3, df = 3, P = 0.72)
For each type of treatment, there was evidence of both
coinfection and complete replacement of the resident
pathogen by the challenge inoculum (i.e. super-infection). Whether establishment of the challenging inocu-

lum was by coinfection versus replacement of the resident
infection did not appear to differ between intra- and interspecific treatments. The extremely high rates of disease
among plants that were inoculated with one type of pathogen and then with water as a control (Table 1), particularly for the M. silenes-inflatae treatment, indicates that the
super-infection category was most often the replacement
of resident infection rather than failure of the first inoculation to colonize the host. Furthermore, an analysis was
undertaken to assess coinfection of the same flowering
stem, which requires persistence of multiple pathogen
genotypes in a single host meristem, as compared to coinfection of separate stems originating from same plant
rosette, differed among treatments. Results showed that
significantly more of the intra-specific competitions
expressed both pathogen genotypes on the same stem (10
of 16; average flowers and bolts sampled per plant were
5.1 and 2.2, respectively) as compared to the inter-specific
competitions (0 of 8; average flowers and bolts sampled
per plant were 5.5 and 2.9, respectively; Fisher's exact test,
P = 0.040).

Discussion
Success of the challenge inoculation during within-host
competition by Microbotryum fungi was dependent on
whether the pathogen interaction was between genotypes
from the same or different species. The challenge inoculation was more successful at infecting a plant when the resident infection represented an intra-specific interaction,
suggesting that the pathogen is more likely to share or
concede its host to conspecific genotypes. When presented with a pathogen from another species, however,
the resident infection more often excluded the challenger
entirely, resulting in a lower rate of coinfection or replacement. These results substantially advance upon previous
studies that investigated within-host competition
between Microbotryum genotypes [16,17] by suggesting
that competitive antagonism between coinfecting strains
increases with genetic distance, not only at intra-specific
levels of relatedness, but also to encompass between-species interactions.

species are designated "1" and "2" after the species abbreviation. The remaining percentages of plants on the y-axis were
those where only the resident inoculum was the detected.
Disease frequency of sequentially inoculated plants did
not differ from singly inoculated plants, indicating that
within-host competition between the pathogens did not
have a protective effect on the host, as seen in some studies on other pathogens [11,18,32,33]. Also, it is important
to note that the intra-specific competitors were not identical clones, in that they originated from different host populations and exhibited measurable genetic differences
according to microsatellite variation.
These findings on within-host competition have important implications for disease ecology, particularly with the
call for studies that move beyond the basic one-host onepathogen framework [34]. The same mechanisms for nonself recognition by Microbotryum that were previously suggested to act during intra-specific competition [16,17,26]
may be effective during competition between species as
well. If so, the antagonistic continuum that spans species
boundaries would be best understood by integrating population as well as community structures of the pathogens.
These consequences are particularly significant for disease
on S. vulgaris, where it has been shown that populations
frequently contain two endemic species of Microbotryum
[30,31]. In other host-pathogen combinations of the
anther-smut disease, such as on the plants Silene latifolia
and Silene dioica, sympatry of the hosts and their endemic
diseases are common [35]. Host species in the caryophyllaceous genus Dianthus are also know to harbor multiple

species of Microbotryum in the same geographic region
[31,36], but the occurrence of mixed populations has not
yet been investigated. Transient host shifts have been
observed for the pathogen from S. latifolia onto sympatric
S. dioica that are already maintaining infections by its
host-specific Microbotryum lineage, and vice versa [35].
Therefore, a potential for strong exclusionary mechanisms
by inter-specific pathogen competition to limit the persistence of incipient host shifts should be addressed by
additional studies. Moreover, how selection on antagonistic mechanisms acting between pathogen species impacts
the evolution of intra-specific competition, and vice versa,
remains to be explored from theoretical and empirical
grounds.
Exclusionary mechanisms during infection may also lead
to different Microbotryum species achieving territorial segregation among host plants and contribute to barriers to
gene flow between them. Pollinators would be less likely
to transport a mixture of spores from different fungal species if they visit flowers consecutively on the same plant.
Even when inter-specific coinfections were found, the two
species exclusively colonized different flowering stems of
the shared host. In this situation, both stems would have
to produce infected flowers at the same time in order for
pollinators to transmit the species together. In fact, the
promotion of earlier flowering is one of the phenotypic
effects of anther-smut disease upon its hosts [37], and the
competition among pathogen genotypes is a likely selective force for manipulation of host phenology and may
result in a degree of temporal as well as spatial segregation.
Given the previous findings that genetic distance between
pathogens impacts the occurrence of multiple infections
[16,17], it would be a simple extension to suggest that
such competitive antagonism increases with genetic distance across species. Considering that the interactions are
occurring in planta, however, it is difficult to investigate
such mechanisms directly. Some potential mechanisms
may be unlikely given our results. For example, disease
resistance in S. vulgaris may be under control of a small
number of genes [38] but there has been no evidence for
a gene-for-gene resistance system [39] that could make
hosts susceptible to one pathogen genotype over another.
Where some plants have inducible resistances as the result
of infection by fungi, such reactions are often non-specific
in nature, and the difference between intra- and inter-specific challenges is more likely be due to other factors [40].
Moreover, the resistance of hosts used in this study was
extremely low, and the dynamics of coinfection may be
driven directly by pathogen-to-pathogen interactions.
Prior studies on Microbotryum have suggested that the fungal non-self recognition process of "vegetative incompati-

BMC Ecology 2009, 9:11

bility" likely serves as a mechanism of competitive
exclusion [16,17]. Vegetative incompatibility is widespread amongst both ascomycete and basidiomycete
fungi and is thought to have arisen to prevent the spread
of infectious cytoplasmic elements or the sharing of
resources [41]. The phenomenon is initiated when
hyphae from unrelated individuals come into contact and
respond to each other as distinct organisms, involving a
cascade of gene expression and a killing reaction at the
point of each hyphal connection [42,43]. Because vegetative incompatibility is governed by accumulated differences at a collection of het loci [42,43], more closely
related individuals will have more similar alleles at these
loci, potentially favoring their coexistence when colonizing in the same resource. In some fungi, vegetative incompatibility has been shown to affect interactions at both the
intra- and inter-specific levels [23-25]. The observation
that Microbotryum resides strictly within the microscopic
corpus region of host meristems [44] has led to the suggestion that space is the primary limiting resource
between competing genotypes [1,14,27]. In such confined
regions, direct contact between coinfecting genotypes is
likely and makes the vegetative incompatibility hypothesis more plausible. In addition, all cases of inter-specific
coinfection resulted in the pathogen species segregating
completely among different stems of the host plant,
which indicates that the strongest antagonism disallowed
coexistence in single meristems from which the separate
flowers on a stem are produced.

Conclusion
Here we have shown that the strength of competitive
antagonism during infection by the anther smut fungi is
correlated with the range of genetic distances that span
from the intra-specific to the inter-specific levels. With the
co-occurrence of multiple Microbotryum species on a single
host, either due to separate endemic pathogen lineages or
the high frequency of host shifts, the strength of competitive exclusion will have a major influence upon overall
disease dynamics and potentially the extent of isolation
between pathogen species. Further studies are needed to
establish the cellular mechanisms at play during coinfection and to address the consequences of competition acting simultaneously at differently levels of selection.

Methods
Study System
The genus Microbotryum infecting the Caryophyllaceae
comprises a complex of fungal species previously subsumed under the name M. violaceum (Pers.) Deml and
Oberw. These basidiomycete pathogens reside in a highly
restricted niche within the host, the corpus region of host
meristems, and eventually produce diploid teliospores in
the anther tissues of developing flowers [44]. Infected
plants are usually completely sterilized because the dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/11

ease also inhibits development of female structures [45].
Insect pollinators spread the teliospores to healthy plants,
and upon germination the fungus undergoes meiosis.
Conjugation between haploid cells of opposite mating
types is a prerequisite for infection, with the mating system tending strongly toward selfing and automixis [4648].
Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed the evolutionary independence of cryptic Microbotryum species on the
Caryophyllaceae, and taxonomic revisions are currently in
progress [31,49-53]. Two such species within the Microbotryum complex have been recognized for some time as
causing disease in natural populations of the host Silene
vulgaris [30,31]. Frequently found in sympatry on the
same S. vulgaris host population [30,31], these two pathogen species are Microbotryum lagerheimii [49] and Microbotryum silenes-inflatae; referred to previously as MvSv1
and MvSv2, respectively [31]. This disease therefore provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of multiple
infection and inter-specific competition without a confounding effect of the pathogens being specialized to different host species.
Microbotryum teliospores for this study were obtained during a 2006 census of S. vulgaris populations in Switzerland: specimens of M. silenes-inflatae were obtained from
Davos (coordinates +46° 48' 47", +9° 49' 13") and St.
Gotthard Pass (+46° 28' 36", +8° 26' 23"); specimens of
M. lagerheimii were obtained from Oberalppass (+46° 37'
56", +8° 36' 33") and Bugnei (+46° 41' 1", +8° 47' 11").
Teliospores were collected from the field as the contents
of mature infected flower buds. To ensure viable inoculum, teliospore germination was scored after incubation
for 24 hours on potato dextrose agar at room temperature
using a subjective scale of 1 to 5. A teliospore collection
with the highest germination success (a score of 4 or 5)
was chosen for use from each of the four populations of
Microbotryum. Prior studies on Microbotryum from a variety
of hosts, including from S. vulgaris, reveal that genetic variation within host-specific lineages is low [30]. Microbotryum species identification was obtained by DNA
sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) and gamma-tubulin genes and comparing for identity with sequences from prior studies deposited in GenBank, NCBI [31,52].
Seeds of S. vulgaris were derived from a greenhouse collection of plants previously used to perform crosses between
susceptible families [38]. The original host families were
obtained from a population in Broadway, Rockingham
County, Virginia, where Microbotryum naturally occurs on
S. vulgaris as a result of a host shift from Silene latifolia
[28,54].

Sequential Inoculation
Seedlings of S. vulgaris were inoculated in vitro according
to previously described methodology [26], with 7 days
between sequential application of inoculum suspensions
or water. Treatments are listed in Table 1, including the
number of plants that became infected and could then be
assessed for which pathogen genotype was the cause of
disease. This interval between sequential inoculations was
previously shown to allow the establishment of the firstinoculated genotype [26]. Briefly, seeds were surface sterilized and incubated on agar media until expansion of the
cotyledons, at which time inoculum was applied to the
apical meristem. The first inoculation was to establish the
"resident" infections and consisted of 3 μl of a 1400 teliospores/μl suspension in water plus surfactant; the second inoculation was to present "challenge" infections and
consisted of 3 μl of a 850 teliospores/μl suspension and
was applied in the same manner to the apical meristem.
Plants were transferred to soil and grown to maturity
under greenhouse conditions in 115 cm2 'Cone-tainers'
(Stuewe and Sons, Inc., Corvallis, OR). The presence of
disease was scored when the plants flowered by inspecting
the anthers for teliospores. Each treatment was randomly
assigned to 49 seedlings (resulting in a total of 588 plants
treated), and plants were randomized for position in the
greenhouse.

To avoid experimental contamination, mature flower
buds were sampled the day before they would have
opened, based upon the exertion of petals beyond the
calyx teeth. The first mature flower bud produced by each
plant was sampled, as well as subsequently produced
buds on the same flowering stem and other stems originating from the plant rosette. Sampling was conducted
over a period of 17 weeks.
When the competition was inter-specific, species assessment for the infections utilized differences in teliospore
germination morphology after 72 hours of incubation on
water agar at room temperature (Fig. 1A, C). When competition was intra-specific, pathogen genotypes were
determined using variation in the microsatellites SVG8
and SVG5 resulting from PCR amplification with primers
as described in past research [51] (Fig. 1B, D). DNA was
extracted from infected anthers using the Chelex method
[55]. Statistical comparisons were made using the generalized linear model procedures in SPSS version 12 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A binomial logit function
was assumed, with the test including the effect of intraversus inter-specific treatments and the particular pathogen genotype combinations nested within the main effect.
This procedure was also used to test whether there were
different rates of infection among plants inoculated
sequentially with the fungus versus receiving inoculum
then water or vice versa. Due to the smaller sample size, a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/11

Fisher's exact test was used to assess whether co-infecting
pathogen genotypes segregated differently among flowering stems depending upon intra- versus inter-specific
treatments.
