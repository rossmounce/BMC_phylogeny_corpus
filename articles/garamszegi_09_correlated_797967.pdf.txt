Abstract
Background: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a key model of genetic polymorphism. Selection pressure
by pathogens or other microevolutionary forces may result in a high rate of non-synonymous substitutions at the codons
specifying the contact residues of the antigen binding sites (ABS), and the maintenance of extreme MHC allelic variation
at the population/species level. Therefore, selection forces favouring MHC variability for any reason should cause a
correlated evolution between substitution rates and allelic polymorphism. To investigate this prediction, we
characterised nucleotide substitution rates and allelic polymorphism (i.e. the number of alleles detected in relation to the
number of animals screened) of several Mhc class II DRB lineages in 46 primate species, and tested for a correlation
between them.
Results: First, we demonstrate that species-specific and lineage-specific evolutionary constraints favour species- and
lineage-dependent substitution rate at the codons specifying the ABS contact residues (i.e. certain species and lineages
can be characterised by high substitution rate, while others have low rate). Second, we show that although the degree
of the non-synonymous substitution rate at the ABS contact residues was systematically higher than the degree of the
synonymous substitution rate, these estimates were strongly correlated when we controlled for species-specific and
lineage-specific effects, and also for the fact that different studies relied on different sample size. Such relationships
between substitution rates of different types could even be extended to the non-contact residues of the molecule. Third,
we provide statistical evidence that increased substitution rate along a MHC gene may lead to allelic variation, as a high
substitution rate can be observed in those lineages in which many alleles are maintained. Fourth, we show that the
detected patterns were independent of phylogenetic constraints. When we used phylogenetic models that control for
similarity between species, due to common descent, and focused on variations within a single lineage (DRB1*03), the
positive relationship between different substitution rates and allelic polymorphisms was still robust. Finally, we found the
same effects to emerge in the analyses that eliminated within-species variation in MHC traits by using strictly single
population-level studies. However, in a set of contrasting analyses, in which we focused on the non-functional DRB6 locus,
the correlation between substitution rates and allelic variation was not prevalent.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that positive selection for the generation of allelic polymorphism acting on the
functional part of the protein has consequences for the nucleotide substitution rate along the whole exon 2 sequence of
the Mhc-DRB gene. Additionally, we proved that an increased substitution rate can promote allelic variation within
lineages. Consequently, the evolution of different characteristics of genetic polymorphism is not independent.

Background
The maintenance of genetic polymorphism is a challenging question for evolutionary biologists because its adaptive value is controversial [1]. The major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most
variable set of genes of known function in vertebrates,
and, as such, it offers a unique opportunity to test competing evolutionary hypotheses of molecular adaptation [e.g.
[2-4]]. As the system plays a crucial role in immune
defence, the most important hypothesis of MHC polymorphism proposes that the selective pressure of parasites
influences the population genetics of the MHC [2,5] at the
levels of both substitution rate and allelic variation. This
can act either via the selective advantage of heterozygous
over homozygous individuals [6] or via negative frequency-dependent selection by which rare MHC alleles
incur benefits against pathogen strains that evade common alleles [7]. Accumulating evidence from wild populations that show that non-synonymous substitution rates
are higher than synonymous substitutions demonstrate
that the MHC underwent balancing selection [3]. Moreover, field studies repeatedly report a link between the presence of particular alleles and individual fitness in terms of
freedom from pathogens [8]. However, the number of
alleles present in a population, may not be only influenced by parasite pressure, but may also be influenced by
population size effects, gene flow, drift, bottleneck effects
[2,3].
Independent of the selective pressures operating, nucleotide substitution rate and allelic variation are different
phenomena, as the former defines the probability of
nucleotide exchange in the DNA sequence, while the latter
describes the number of alleles that are preserved functioning in the population or species. Hence, selection
forces favouring MHC variability can affect substitution
rates, which may have consequences for the accumulation
of functioning alleles, but there may be various genetic
mechanisms that generate new alleles. It remains difficult
to elucidate the evolutionary causes and consequences of
MHC polymorphism, mostly because the molecular
mechanisms underlining its extreme allelic variation
remain unknown. The functional part of the molecule
that accomplishes peptide presentation (contact residues
of the antigen-binding sites [ABS]) and displays most of
the polymorphism is generally thought to be driven by
pathogen-driven selective pressures [9]. The ABS contact
residues exhibit a consistently higher rate of non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions, which is generally
interpreted as evidence that mutations altering amino
acid sequence are being positively selected, in contrast to
silent mutations [8,10]. Although, the higher rate of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions provides
evidence that selection processes are operating that favour
the establishment of polymorphism, such evidence does

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

not demonstrate what the exact genetic mechanisms are.
For example, it does not prove that different substitution
rates at the ABS contact residues are particularly favoured
by parasites or that high substitution rates directly promote allelic variation, e.g. through point mutations at the
ABS contact residues. Substitution rates may also be
resulted from gene flow or bottleneck effects, while the
adaptive number of alleles and antigen-specificity should
not be determined exclusively by alterations at the ABS
contact residues. Changes in amino acid sequences in the
protein binding groove may affect stereochemistry, and
substitution rates within the groove but outside of the
contact residues may have consequences for the threedimensional positioning of the ABS contact residues [11].
Moreover, certain regions, such as the contact region with
the T-cell receptor (TCR), may also display polymorphic
residues. Hence, substitution at the TCR binding sites may
affect the stability of MHC peptide-receptor complex and
the subsequent intrathymic selection of the responding Tcell repertoire that ultimately determines antigen-specificity [12]. Importantly, not only single codons and mutations may be involved; it should also be considered that
the exchange of longer stretches of nucleotide sequences
via recombinations may generate allelic polymorphism
[13,14].
Although selection in space and time of specific alleles
(e.g. according to fluctuations in the parasite density) can
in theory be manifested in the accumulation of many different alleles, it is not crucial to expect that selection pressures (due to parasite resistance for example) always
enhance a tight evolutionary link between rates of nucleotide substitutions and allelic variation that is preserved at
the population or species level. Accordingly, it does not
necessarily mean that a high substitution rate can be translated into genetic polymorphism. If individuals with specific MHC allele or allele combinations enjoy selective
advantages in a given environment, the fitness benefit
accrued to a certain MHC genotype may not only lead to
the accumulation of alleles but a certain allele (or allele
combination) can also undergo directional selection and
fixation [15-17]. Therefore, even if high substitution rate
and the generation of new alleles is linked, it is not necessarily reflected by the maintenance of high allelic polymorphism that can be observed at the population level in
terms of the number of alleles accumulated. Furthermore,
the strength of selection on a single allele depends on the
presence and net effect of other alleles within individuals
[18]. The typical distribution of MHC alleles across individuals follows haplotype polymorphism (gene copy
number variation), as due to past gene duplication events,
individuals can possess more than two MHC alleles of the
same lineage that are sometimes linked and that can only
occur in specific combinations [19-22]. Hence, copy
number variation and linkage can buffer or amplify the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:73

selective advantage/disadvantage of specific alleles (i.e. a
polymorph haplotype has a higher chance of having a parasite-resistant allele than does an oligo- or monomorph
haplotype). Consequently, an entire suite of evolutionary
mechanisms that operate within the MHC genome may
exist, which could shape observed levels of both substitution rates and allelic polymorphism.
For a better understanding of the evolution of MHC polymorphism, studies are needed that establish a link
between substitution rates and allelic variation. Here, we
accomplish this task and demonstrate a comprehensive
analysis of exon 2 of the primate DRB gene. The DRB
region exhibits the most elaborate polymorphisms in
MHC class II genes, and these have been extensively characterised in primates, due to their importance in immunological research [23-31]. Based on an extensive survey of
the literature, we counted the number of alleles relative to
the number of animals sampled across 46 species, and
sorted the corresponding nucleotide sequences into lineages (such as HLA-DRB1*03, Patr-DRB1*03 and MamuDRB1*03). Sequences that are derived from common
ancestry in different species, that have known gene products and peptide-binding grooves that are highly similar,
and that could therefore select the same peptide for T-cell
activation, were considered to belong to the same lineage
[32]. Based on the available sequences within each lineage, we characterised substitution rates at different sites in
each species. We predicted that if elevated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions at ABS contact residues generate allelic variation, there should be a positive relationship between these traits. We predicted a similar
relationship for substitution rates at the non-contact residues, because substitutions or recombination events at
these sites could be functionally important. We also predicted positive correlations between substitution rates at
the ABS contact and non-contact residues, as selection
exerted by pathogens can cause the joint evolution of
nucleotide substitution and recombination events.
Statistically, we focused on variation within lineages,
because comparisons between different heterologous or
paralogous lineages may be difficult due to their incomparable function and physical position within the genome
(e.g. we avoided comparing substitution rates between
DRB1*03, DRB1*05 or DRB*W7). The main question was
whether if for any reason a given lineage displays a high
substitution rate at the ABS contact or non-contact residues, it also displays a high degree of allelic variation.
Therefore, we performed our analyses at the lineage level,
and used a General Linear Model (GLM) design to control
for the fact that non-independent, multiple data were
used from the same species and from the same lineage.
This statistical setup also allowed us to assess the importance of species-specific and lineage-specific effects. Such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

effects, if detected, could reveal that a particular species
maintains a more or less constant substitution rate across
the possessed DRB lineages, or that a particular lineage
displays similar substitution rates in those species in
which it is present. The outcome of such a complex statistical design may be difficult to interpret, and is not completely independent of phylogenetic inertia due to the
evolutionary relationships between species and lineages.
Hence, we chose a single lineage (the best-characterised
DRB1*03 lineage) to demonstrate the same relationships
between substitution rates and allelic polymorphism in
an interspecific context, when phylogenetic effects can be
held constant. Additionally, we dealt with the fact that
mixing data from different populations of the same species may yield systematically higher substitution rates and
allelic diversity, because of population-specific selection
factors that favour different MHC characteristics at each
location [33]. To control for this unwanted within-species
variation, we run additional analyses that used data from
strictly single population-level studies. Finally, as a contrasting analysis, the predictions about relationships
between different substitution rates and allelic variation
by focusing on lineages of potentially non-functional loci
(pseudogenes) were tested. If the corresponding nucleotide sequences are not translated into gene products and
are thus not favoured by natural selection, one would
expect that such nucleotide substitutions should be neutral. Therefore, it was predicted that in such non-functioning lineages, there would be no selection for high rate of
non-synonymous substitutions that could result in correlations between different substitution rates and allelic variation. In the entire set of analyses, we controlled for
differences in data quality by using statistical weights. This
was necessary, as different studies screened different numbers of individuals raising heterogeneity in sampling
effort.

Results
Patterns of substitution rates
The level of non-synonymous substitution rates along the
ABS contact residues was on average 0.216 (s.e. = 0.012)
substitution, range 0.000–0.807, N = 191 (data on 60 lineages across 43 species (for 3 species only one allele was
available, thus we could not compute substitution rates).
The level of synonymous substitution rates at the same
sites was on average 0.072 (s.e. = 0.005) substitution,
range 0.000–0.338, N = 191. Thus, the synonymous rate
was on average 33.3% of the non-synonymous substitution rate. On the basis of sites that do not correspond to
the ABS contact residues of the molecule, the patterns of
distribution of substitution rates showed the following
figures: non-synonymous, mean ± s.e. = 0.027 ± 0.001,
range = 0.000–0.078; synonymous, mean ± s.e. = 0.026 ±
0.002, range = 0.000–0.115 (N = 191). The amino acid
variability (i.e. the number of different amino acids

found) of different sites of the molecule is shown in Figure 1.
Species- and lineage-specific effects
We found that synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates at different sites of the primate DRB molecule
showed consistent within-species and within-lineage variations (Table 1, Figure 2). This indicates that there are
species that systematically display higher substitution
rates than others across a list of different lineages. However, there are lineages that can be typified by their high
tempo of substitution in a range of species, while others
are less variable. The species-specific patterns were robust
because these were apparent when we only focused on
HLA-orthologue lineages (Table 1). Nevertheless, the lineage-specific patterns may be caused by differences
between the HLA orthologues and non-orthologous lineages (Workshop, 'W' lineages), since after the exclusion of
the 'W' lineages, the systematic within-lineage variation
appeared noticeably weakened (Table 1).

The repertoire of lineages may vary in a species-specific
manner, as primates closely related to humans are more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

likely to have orthologous HLA-DRB lineages, while
prosimians basically have W lineages only. As a result,
species-specific and lineage-specific effects may partially
overlap, and thus species-specific effects may emerge via
lineage-specific roles and vice versa. Therefore, we
assessed the importance of these effects simultaneously in
the same statistical model by using a GLM design, in
which one factor can be controlled as a random effect.
When we estimated species-specific effects independent of
lineage-specific effects, we still found that variation at the
species level explains a significant amount of variation in
sequence polymorphism (Table 2). Similar patterns
emerged in the reciprocal situation, when species effects
were kept constant and the independent effects of lineages
were estimated (Table 2). However, as we also found in
the one-way ANOVA design, these latter effects were sensitive to the exclusion of W lineages.
These results imply that further analyses of substitution
rates should consider species-specific and lineage-specific
effects, which are applied in the following sections in
addition to the control for heterogeneous sampling.

Association between substitution rates at different sites
As a strong indication for positive selection, the degree of
non-synonymous substitution rates at the ABS contact residues was systematically higher than that of synonymous
substitution rates at the same residues (paired-t190 =
13.19, P < 0.001). The mean of the dN:dS ratio was 5.728
(s.e. = 0.605). A positive correlation between dN and dS
indicated that lineages that have a relatively large value for
non-synonymous substitution rates also have a relatively
large value for synonymous substitution rates (Table 3,
Figure 3a). This may imply that selection favouring the

accumulation of non-synonymous substitutions within a
lineage also favours the accumulation of synonymous
substitutions. However, the slope of the regression was
significantly smaller than one (t189 = -18.25, P < 0.001),
suggesting that a unit increase in dN is accompanied by an
increase in dS that corresponds to a smaller degree of
change (Figure 3a). Non-synonymous substitution rates
at the ABS non-contact residues were also higher than synonymous substitution rates at the same residues, but these
differences were less robust (paired-t190 = 2.82, P = 0.005;
mean ± s.e. of the dN:dS ratio = 1.327 ± 0.101). We also

Interestingly, when variation between species and lineages was held constant and the analyses was weighted by
sample size that balances differences in data quality
between studies, the association between substitution
rates was prevalent across the ABS contact and non-contact residues, and also in comparisons of substitutions of
the same type (Table 3). Therefore, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates throughout the whole
exon 2 sequence of the DRB molecule seem to covary with
each other at the within-lineage level. Notably, these relationships were very similar when we focused on HLAorthologues lineages (Table 3). The only difference
observed was that synonymous substitution rates at the
ABS non-contact residues were higher than non-synonymous substitution rates when W lineages were excluded
(paired-t54 = -5.571, P < 0.001; mean ± s.e. of the dN:dS
ratio = 0.658 ± 0.058). The same comparison for the ABS
contact residues showed the opposite pattern when only
human orthologues lineages were used (paired-t54 =
6.972, P < 0.001; mean ± s.e. of the dN:dS ratio = 4.176 ±
1.101).
Substitution rates and allelic variation
If high rates of non-synonymous substitutions generate
allelic variation within a given lineage, we predict a positive relationship between dN and the number of alleles
relative to the number of animals sampled. Accordingly,
we found that the degree of non-synonymous substitutions at the ABS contact residues was positively related to
allelic variation estimated as a relative allele number,
when we controlled for species-specific and lineage-specific effects and also for heterogeneous data quality by
using statistical weights to correct for differences in sampling effort (r = 0.394, F1,89 = 16.380, P < 0.001, Figure
4a). This covariation at r ~0.3–0.4 was also prevalent
when W lineages were excluded, but was not significant
due to the much lower sample size reducing statistical
power (r = 0.324, F1,16 = 1.878, P = 0.189, Figure 4b).

observed a positive relationship between dN and dS
(Table 3, Figure 3b), with the slope being smaller than
could be expected from an isometric relationship between
the two traits (t189 = -4.601, P < 0.001).

We also examined the possibility that the relationship
between relative allele number (allelic variation) and substitution rate might be mediated by an artefact caused by
the sensitivity of the estimation of dN to the number of
alleles screened. We selected dN estimates that were
derived from analyses of exactly five sequences. This
threshold of five alleles was decided based on the balance
between precision and sample size, as such samples may
provide dN estimates of sufficiently high precision, and
are available for a number of lineages that allow statistical
analyses (N = 20). Hence, when the number of sequences
is forced to be equal, it does not inflate the estimation of
substitution rates. However, the corresponding sample
size in terms of the number of animals screened for the
detection of these five alleles showed considerable variation, and can be used to reflect allelic variation. If many

opposite case, if five alleles are present in only a few individuals, one may assume that there are several alleles
present in a larger sample, which implies that allelic variation is high. Therefore, when the number of alleles is
held constant, the number of animals screened is an
inverse estimate of allelic polymorphism. As such, this
should correlate negatively with non-synonymous substitution rate if the latter affects allelic variation. Indeed we
detected such a relationship (r = -0.492, N = 20, P = 0.028;
when using statistical weights, r = -0.466, N = 20, P =
0.038). Due to the low sample size available, we were
unable to deal with variation between species and lineages. However, this correlation may show that the relationship between relative allele numbers and substitution
rates is unlikely to have been caused by the number of
alleles analysed.
Given the high degree of association across different substitution rates and across different sites (Table 3), we predicted finding associations between allelic variation in
terms of relative allele number and different substitution
rates. These predictions were supported statistically (dS at
contact residues of the ABS: r = 0.438, F1,89 = 21.127, P <
0.001; dN at non-contact residues: r = 0.410, F1,89 =
17.967, P < 0.001; dS at non-contact residues: r = 0.415,
F1,89 = 18.533, P < 0.001, species and lineage effects were
held constant and the analyses were weighted by sample
size). When W lineages were excluded comparable effect
sizes emerged, but were non-significant probably due to
the resulting low sample size (dS at contact residues of the
ABS: r = 0.318, F1,16 = 1.799, P = 0.199; dN at non-contact
residues: r = 0.480, F1,16 = 4.800, P = 0.043; dS at non-contact residues: r = 0.307, F1,16 = 1.667, P = 0.215). There-

fore, the exclusion of W lineages raised issues about
statistical power, but the magnitude of the relationships
of interest remained unaffected.
Removing phylogenetic effects: comparative analyses of
DRB1*03 polymorphism across species
Although employing random factors in the GLM models
can eliminate the problem of the use of multiple entries
from the same species and lineages that would cause pseudoreplication, species (and also lineages) may share a
phylogenetic history that can still render data points to be
statistically non-independent of each other. To handle
this potentially confounding effect of phylogenetic inertia, we repeated the above correlations at the interspecific
level by controlling for the phylogenetic associations
between species and by using the DRB1*03 lineage.
Therefore, the common descent of species can be eliminated by modern comparative methods, while a strict
focus on a single lineage does not require considering
problems that are due to the relationship between lineages.

To perform interspecific analyses, we therefore selected
the best-characterised lineage and tested the same predictions about the evolution of MHC-DRB lineages across
species. At least two alleles within the DRB1*03 lineage
were available in 18 species, for which we had information on nucleotide substitution rates (dN at contact residues of the ABS, mean ± s.e. = 0.166 ± 0.023, range =
0.000 ± 0.306; dS at ABS contact residues, mean ± s.e. =
0.026 ± 0.004, range = 0.000–0.055; dN at ABS non-contact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.064 ± 0.013, range = 0.000 ±
0.162; dS at ABS non-contact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.041
± 0.006, range = 0.000–0.077). As expected, the dN at the
ABS contact residues was consistently higher than dS
(paired-t17 = 4.779, P < 0.001), leading to the mean of

Similar to our earlier findings, estimates of substitution
rates were strongly intercorrelated, when the phylogenetic
relatedness and the heterogeneous sampling of species
were controlled in an appropriate PGLS model (Table 4,
Figure 5). Moreover, we could confirm that the slope of
the dN-dS regression line corresponding to the ABS contact residues was smaller than unity (raw species data: t16
= -4.444, P < 0.001; phylogenetic control: t16 = -2.845, P =
0.012). In contrast, this was not the case for the regression
based on non-contact residues, which appears to be isometric (raw species data: t16 = -0.586, P = 0.566; phylogenetic control: t16 = 0.587, P = 0.566).
We tested for the relationship between substitution rates
and allelic variation. Again, we used the number of alleles
relative to the number of animals sampled as an estimate
of allelic polymorphism, and found that it was positively
related to dN at the ABS contact residues (PGLS model
combining phylogenetic control and statistical weights:
partial r = 0.610, N = 18, P = 0.009, Figure 5). This pattern
was also seen in relation to the other substitution rates
(PGLS models combining phylogenetic control and statistical weights: dS at contact residues of the ABS, partial r =
0.748, N = 18, P < 0.001; dN at non-contact residues, partial r = 0.614, N = 18, P = 0.009; dS at non-contact residues, partial r = 0.773, N = 18, P < 0.001).

(paired-t17 = -3.080, P = 0.007, mean ± s.e. dN:dS ratio =
0.679 ± 0.094).

It has been claimed that only alleles of the DRB1*03 lineage from humans, apes and Old World monkeys are
orthologous, and in New World monkeys and lesser primates all DRB1*03 alleles are generated by convergent
evolution [29,34]. However, when we applied a more narrow sense criterion for orthology and restricted our analyses to lineages from catarrhine species only, the detected
patterns were very similar in terms of the magnitude of the
effect detected (see Table 4 for the correlations between
substitution rates; the relationship between dN at the at
contact residues of the ABS and relative allele numbers,
PGLS model: r = 0.573, N = 11, P = 0.069, Figure 5). In
general, a strict focus on the DRB1*03 lineage in combination with statistical control for phylogenetic relationships and heterogeneous sampling of species provides
very similar results as to the DRB-wide analyses (Figure 3)
that factored out variations due to species-specific and lineage-specific effects.
Removing effects due to within-species variation: analyses
at the population level
In previous approaches, we included data that originated
from different populations. However, sampling more
than one population per species may result in the detection of more alleles and higher substitution rates, simply
because different populations are adapted to different
environments with different MHC characteristics. To
remove this confounding effect of within-species variability, we restricted our analyses to clear population level

studies. However, using such a restriction caused a considerable amount of information loss and a reduction of statistical power, because only a few studies were available
for this purpose (see Methods).
We found 10 different lineages across 4 species that could
be divided into well-characterised populations, and
resulted in N = 17 independent data points (i.e. population-specific combination of lineages). We calculated
nucleotide substitution rates that were similar to those we
obtained in the above analyses (dN at contact residues of
the ABS, mean ± s.e. = 0.265 ± 0.056, range = 0.000 ±
0.674; dS at ABS contact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.118 ±
0.022, range = 0.000–0.253; dN at ABS non-contact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.026 ± 0.006, range = 0.000 ± 0.081;
dS at ABS non-contact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.042 ±
0.009, range = 0.000–0.106). Again, the dN at the ABS
contact residues was consistently higher than dS (pairedt16 = 3.214, P < 0.005, mean ± s.e. dN:dS ratio = 3.220 ±
0.655), and the analogue comparison at the non-contact
residues revealed the opposite tendency (paired-t13 = 2.640, P = 0.018, mean ± s.e. dN:dS ratio = 0.561 ± 0.101).
We could also replicate the generally positive relationship
between different estimates of substitution rates, when
species-specific effects were held constant and when we
controlled for differences in sample size by using statistical weights (ABS contact residues: r = 0.739, P = 0.003, N
= 17, regression slope is smaller than unity, t15 = -3.560, P
= 0.003; non-contact residues: r = 0.748, P = 0.002; regression slope is isometric, t15 = 0.121, P = 0.905). Finally, we
also found a positive association between the number of
alleles relative to the animals sampled and dN at the ABS
contact residues (r = 0.771, N = 17, P = 0.002, when species-specific effects and heterogeneity in sample size were
controlled). These results remained qualitatively
unchanged, when we excluded data from gorilla populations, in which one dominant male may father the major-

ity of offspring that may be a confounding factor
(correlations between different substitution rates: r =
0.768 – 0.903, P = 0.004 – 0.0001, N = 12; correlation
between dN at the ABS contact residues and allelic variation: (r = 0.781, N = 12, P = 0.013).
Contrast analysis with the DRB6 locus
The above series of analyses was repeated by using potentially non-functional nucleotide sequences. We found 4
different DRB6 lineages with at least two alleles (from
DRB6*01 to 04) across 10 species providing us with a
sample size of 14 species-specific combinations of lineages. Based on the presence of several shared characteristics [30], we assumed that these sequences are nonfunctional. Confirming this assumption, the calculated
nucleotide substitution rates at the contact residues of the
ABS were lower than in the case of functional lineages (dN
at contact residues of the ABS, mean ± s.e. = 0.028 ± 0.008,
range = 0.000 ± 0.098; dS at ABS contact residues, mean ±
s.e. = 0.068 ± 0.037, range = 0.000–0.441; dN at ABS noncontact residues, mean ± s.e. = 0.034 ± 0.010, range =
0.000 ± 0.101; dS at ABS non-contact residues, mean ± s.e.
= 0.049 ± 0.015, range = 0.000–0.168). Moreover, the dN
at the ABS contact and non-contact residues was not consistently higher or lower than dS at the same residues
(contact residues of the ABS, paired-t13 = -0.226, P =
0.825; non-contact residues, paired-t13 = -1.100, P =
0.291). Contrary to previous results with potentially functioning DRB lineages, there was no indication for a generally strong positive relationship between different
estimates of substitution rates at the ABS contact residues,
when lineage-specific effects were held constant and when
we controlled for differences in sample size by using statistical weights (ABS contact residues: r = 0.194, P = 0.510,
N = 14; non-contact residues: r = 0.815, P < 0.001; there
was not enough variation in the data to control for species-specific effects). Finally, we found no association

Discussion
Relying on the information currently available in the literature and the annotated sequences in the NHP-MHC and
GenBank databases, we processed a comprehensive dataset on MHC-DRB allelic polymorphism and nucleotide
substitution rate in primates. We collected MHC data
from 51 scientific studies representing exactly 2500 animals and 1174 sequences. Our aim was to determine the
degree of correlation between different estimates of substitution rate and allelic polymorphism within lineages.
We found that substitution rates along exon 2 of the
MHC-DRB gene vary consistently both within species and
lineages. The same species appear to display similar
degrees of substitution across different lineages, while the
same lineage also possesses similar nucleotide variations
in different species. Therefore, we adopted a GLM design,
in which we could control for such species-specific and
lineage-specific effects, and thus could focus statistically
on variations between alleles, which drive polymorphism
within a lineage. In addition, by using statistical weights
in the analyses, the confounding effect of heterogeneous
data quality arising from that different numbers of animals were screened for MHC alleles in different species
was removed. These controlled analyses revealed that
non-synonymous substitution rates at sites that correspond to the contact residues of the antigen-binding
pocket of the translated protein were consistently higher
than synonymous substitution rates at the same sites. The
existence of such patterns was not so obvious at ABS noncontact residues, as dN:dS ratio varied across analyses.
However, it is remarkable that in all tests a strong relationship between substitution rates of different types and at
different sites was observed. Furthermore, different estimates of substitution rates also predicted allelic variation.
Additionally, we demonstrated that such relationships
were present, when we focused on a single lineage
(DRB1*03) and simultaneously controlled for phylogenetic relationships of species and heterogeneous sampling
by modern comparative approaches. These patterns also
emerged when we restricted our analyses to populationspecific data. Contrary, these correlations were absent in a
series of contrasting analyses, in which we focused on the
well-characterized lineages of the DRB6 pseudogene. Our
findings indicate that any selection factor that has consequences for the substitution rate at a given site may also
have consequences for the substitution rate at another site
and also for the generation of new alleles within a functional lineage. Therefore, this is the first study that shows
that different traits of genetic polymorphism evolve
together, which has important implications for the evolutionary ecology of the MHC.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

Extensive sequence variation at sites where antigen recognition occurs is a typical feature of the MHC [8]. This indicates that balancing selection operates on this region of
the genome, and that the recognition of pathogens may
have played a key role in the evolution of MHC polymorphism. At the ABS contact residues, almost all primate lineages with available data exhibited a dN:dS ratio greater
than one (Figure 3a), with at least a threefold difference
on average between non-synonymous and synonymous
substitution rates. This should be considered robust when
compared to other genes, such as reproductive or metabolic genes [1]. Sequence polymorphism at the ABS contact residues have been suggested to persist over a long
period, and some evolutionary constraints may have
favoured each species at a certain period to maintain a set
of alleles that allow diverse amino acid composition [3].
Interestingly, selection pressures that favour a high degree
of substitution rates to alter the amino acid sequence of
the functionally important part of the molecule also
favour substitution rates of different types at the ABS noncontact residues. This joint evolutionary response in terms
of the accumulation of substitutions may be a genetic
mechanism that ultimately generates new alleles.
Although sequence variation at the ABS non-contact residues was less emphasised than at the contact residues, it
showed substantial correlated variation. Hence, selection
factors affecting sites outside the contact residues should
also accompany selection factors that generate MHC
allelic variation. Therefore, increased rates of non-synonymous substitutions at the ABS contact residues are not
the only mechanisms that result in variable sequences or/
and more alleles. First, non-synonymous changes in noncontact residues may alter the contact region with the Tcell receptor, with consequences for antigen specificity
[12]. The MHC class II molecule per se shows, as compared
to the MHC class I molecule, limited specificity and is
known to be more promiscuous [35,36]. The perfect discrimination of antigens is accomplished during the maturation of the immune system, when the peptide-MHC
complex is recognised by highly specific T cells. Indeed,
even a single change in the MHC sequences that influence
receptor binding may be deleterious for recognition [37].
Second, the results showed that not only the effect of nonsynonymous substitutions but that of synonymous
changes should also be considered, as such substitutions
occur parallel to increasing allelic variation. Variation in
synonymous rates may be driven by differences in generation time or variable DNA damage due to distinct metabolic rates [38,39]. As such, for an adaptive allelic
variation to be maintained even at a constant non-synonymous substitution rate, species may need to decrease
generation time or metabolic rate or to introduce effective
error-correcting machinery. Third, the accumulation of
synonymous substitutions escorting the accumulation of
non-synonymous substitutions may also be caused by
Page 12 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:73

genetic hitchhiking-like effects, whereby polymorphism
at selectively natural sites tightly linked to sites experiencing strong selection may be affected [40]. Fourth, changes
in dN and dS along the molecule do not exclusively cover
alterations at single codons, but they can reflect the role of
intragenomic recombinations, which may involve longer
nucleotide sequences [41]. Particularly high levels of
recombination may exist in MHC genes, which can be an
important means of producing high allelic variation [13].
In any case, the possibility that the correlation between
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions occurs
because they diverged and accumulated over the same
period can be excluded. The slope of the corresponding
regression line was systematically different from unity
(Figures 3 and 5), which suggests that one substitution
trait increased considerably less than the other. This is in
contrast to time effects that would have raised symmetrical selection pressures on different substitution rates and
would have resulted in isometric correlations. Moreover,
our analyses focusing on the interspecific variation of
DRB1*03 variability showed that the relationships were
present when we controlled for the phylogeny of species.
This phylogenetic control also applies statistical control
for the divergence time of species, as the used phylogenetic tree relied on estimated divergence times [42].
We demonstrated that measures of sequence polymorphism vary in a species-specific manner. Other studies
have observed remarkable patterns of interspecific variation in MHC variability, and have suggested that these differences must be interpreted in the context of life history,
demography and ecological niches of species [13,15]. In
particular, pathogens have been long suspected to be
responsible for maintaining allelic variation at the MHC
[6]. For example, nematode burden is connected with distribution of Mhc-DRB alleles in several taxa [43-48]
including primates [49]. Heavily parasitised species maintain more MHC alleles to function against pathogens,
which can be a result of altering host-parasite cycles that
favour the preservation of different alleles at varying frequency [7]. Therefore, species-specific pressure due to disease risk may be a likely candidate that should select for
allelic polymorphism and that should have consequences
for nucleotide substitution rates that maintain such polymorphism. However, parasitism is not the only factor that
necessitates the maintenance of allelic variation. Another
set of fundamental hypotheses of allelic polymorhism
concerns the importance of mate choice for particular
genotypes or gene combinations that enhance parasite
resistance or outbreeding [4]. As a result, selection for
increased reproductive success via advantageous MHC
traits should not exclusively favour the functional (i.e.
ABS) sites of the molecule but all genetic traits that lead to
more alleles. As such, inbreeding avoidance can promote

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

increased substitution rates at other parts of the molecule.
However, the key evolutionary factors that shape interspecific variation in substitution rate and allelic polymorphism remain to be identified. Phylogenetic comparative
approaches [e.g. [50]] may offer a powerful tool to relate
components of life history, sexual selection and parasitism to species-specific estimates of MHC polymorphism
at different levels. Our results showing consistent withinspecies variation may provide a starting point for such
studies, as they prove that species-specific estimates make
biological sense.
We also found some evidence that selection pressures may
act differently on distinct lineages. Most importantly, the
strongest diversification appears between lineages that are
orthologous and that are not orthologous with the HLA
lineages. We know little about the status of MHC
sequences with workshop numbers, as they may involve
loci/lineages for which no obvious equivalents are known
in the HLA system. Therefore, the lineage-specific patterns
may be explained by the fact that different lineages represent various loci with dissimilar functions [see [51]]. In
any case, we statistically controlled for any noise that
could arise from the between-lineage variation.
Although, we processed an enormous amount of information on MHC sequence polymorphism that is currently
available in the primate literature and considered several
confounding factors at the analytical levels, some limitations that currently cannot be treated quantitatively warrant attention. For example, it may be that some of the
primate species included in this study have experienced
severe bottlenecks and, as a consequence, current levels of
MHC diversity may not be the result of pathogenic selective pressures but may instead be the result of other microevolutionary forces. However, our study was not designed
to specifically test the effect of parasites, but to identify
correlations between MHC traits whatever the selective
factor is in the background. Further investigations are
needed to demonstrate how selection forces due to parasites and/or other factors can contribute to the correlated
evolution of substitution rate and allelic variation at the
MHC. Moreover, recently, it became evident that the DRB
genes in primates may represent relative young entities,
and must have arisen from a complex series of duplications [52,53]. As a consequence, some primates may
appear to have two alleles of an apparently similar locus
on one chromosome. However, the exon 2 sequences of
these genes represent old entities predating primate speciation, and during primate evolution, they are continuously sprinkled over the duplicated genes by
recombination-like processes [52]. The identification of
gene duplications and the degree of haplotype polymorphism requires the screening and genotyping a large
number of animals, a criterion with which only few

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:73

model species meet. Detailed haplotype studies in rhesus
macaques recorded only limited evidence for haplotypes
harbouring DRB genes with exon 2 sequences grouping
into the same lineages [54,55]. As such the performed
analysis with exon 2 sequences of the DRB genes seems to
be a legitimate approach. If more information have been
gathered on the distribution of expressed alleles across
individuals at the population level, the appropriate control for gene duplication will be possible.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that nucleotide substitution rates at exon 2 of the Mhc-DRB gene can be dependent on the species and the lineage considered. Despite
this, there was a clear indication that MHC allelic variation and nucleotide substitution rates follow parallel evolutionary routes. Allelic variation can be achieved by
mechanisms that involve regions with both ABS contact
and non-contact residues, and affect both synonymous
and non-synonymous substitution rates. Hence, if a DRB
lineage is selected for any reason (e.g. due to parasite pressure), and such selection factors shape nucleotide substitution of any kind, it will have consequences for
substitution rates at different sites, as well as on the
number of alleles generated within the lineage on an evolutionary time scale and maintained at the population
level. The comprehensive analysis of MHC polymorphism
of primate lineages generally supports theories that concern the concerted evolution of genetic traits. Further
analyses are needed to identify the selection factors that
are responsible for the correlated evolution of MHC traits,
and to correct for potentially confounding factor of gene
duplication.

Methods
MHC Data
We extracted information on MHC-DRB for prosimian,
catarrhine and platyrrhine primates from the literature up
to 31 May 2007, in an attempt to recover all published
data. We relied primarily on references listed in the IPD/
MHC database [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/mhc, [56]],
which we extended with additional sources as identified
through systematic literature searches in Web of Science
and GenBank. From each paper, we gathered information
on the number and origin of animals sampled and the
number of alleles (e.g. DRB1*0301, DRB3*0504,
DRB*W706, or DRB*Wb01) detected in each lineage (e.g.
DRB1*03 within the DRB1 locus, DRB3*05 within DRB3
locus, DRB*W28 and DRB*W7 or DRB*Wa and DRB*Wb
within DRB*W). Sequences with a 'W' (workshop
number) represent alleles or loci for which no human
(HLA) orthologues exist [27]. However, we included them
in our analysis because they do appear to form lineages
[24,29,31,57,58], and thus our working hypothesis and
prediction about the relationship between sequence and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

allelic polymorphism at the within-lineage level is applicable. Moreover, our statistical approach allowed a control for differences between HLA orthologues and nonorthologues lineages. We also did the analyses after
excluding W lineages.
For a standard data collection and allele categorisation,
we followed the universal MHC nomenclature [27,59]
and the most recent taxonomy [[42], we added Microcebus
myoxinus as separate species as suggested by [60]]. If the
nomenclature in the source paper deviated from the
standard, we adopted allele names as adjusted by the IPD/
MHC, or categorised alleles based on sequence similarity
with known alleles of closely related species. Recent taxonomy does not always fit with what had been used in the
sources (e.g. the new taxonomy considers a single Papio
species [42], while P. anubis, P. cynocephalus, P. hamadryas
and P. papio were earlier treated as different species [57]).
In such cases, we recategorised alleles according to the
new scenario, and within a species we only counted alleles
that had a non-identical nucleotide sequence. As the origin of lineages is occasionally unclear, it is difficult to
identify the orthologous sequences across species. Testing
our hypothesis, however, does not require orthologous
lineages, as it corresponds to the general question of
whether a selection pressure selects for increased sequence
variability within a given lineage and also favours allelic
polymorphism within the same lineage (i.e. we were not
interested in identifying the lineage under selection). We
assumed that diverse selective mechanisms would operate
in different species and in different lineages, because the
combination of species-specific and lineage-specific
mechanisms that should be expected to result in that specific MHC structure appears to be favoured as polymorphs
in each species (e.g. DRB1 lineages in Hominoids;
DRB*W sequences in Lemurids and New World monkeys). Moreover, multiple data from the same species or
lineage are non-independent, and so their use in statistical
analyses raises issues about pseudoreplication [61].
Hence, we applied statistical approaches that allow control for the variation between species and between lineages (see below), with the result that the tests would
permit implications independent of particular species or
MHC lineage. The advantage of working with lineages is
that variation in gene copy number is low, since heterozygote individuals can only possess a maximum of two alleles per lineage [e.g. [57,62-65]]. To deal with the nonindependence of data points due to common descent, we
used comparative analyses to remove phylogenetic effects
(see below).
For each allele, we obtained the corresponding exon 2
nucleotide sequences from GenBank, and aligned them
with MEGA version 3 [66] by following the source paper
and IPD/MHC database. The alignments and the corre-

sponding references used in this study are available as
supporting material (Additional files 1 and 2). Each
sequence was first checked for codon or nucleotide insertions and deletions and for premature stop codons. Alleles with these alterations are known as pseudogenes, and
may code non-functional proteins [67]. Therefore, these
alleles together with those from the DRB6 locus were
excluded from the analyses of functioning sequences.
However, DRB6 alleles were used in the contrast analyses
of non-functioning lineages (see below). We used the Nei
and Gojobori [68] method with the Jukes and Cantor [69]
correction to calculate the rate of non-synonymous (dN)
and synonymous (dS) substitutions as well as their ratio
(dN:dS). We calculated these estimates of substitution
rate and positive selection separately for the ABS contact
and non-contact residues. We considered the following 16
ABS contact residues to be relevant: 9, 11, 13, 28, 30, 37,
38, 57, 61, 67, 70, 71, 74, 78, 82, 86 [70,71], while the
remaining codons were treated as non-contact residues.
These sites were labelled in the mode of "Select genes and
domains" in MEGA. Some studies have suggested that
other sites may be considered as contact residues in certain species, due to their high amino acid polymorphism
[e.g. [62,72-74]]. However, functional and stereochemical
evidence for these alternative sites is lacking, and their
general applicability is limited. In the majority of species,
we achieved the highest dN when we used the traditional
sites, which generally appear to be the most polymorphic
(difference in the number of amino acids detected
between the considered contact and non-contact sites: t88
= 9.76, P < 0.001; [Figure 1]).
Statistical and comparative analyses
Prior to the statistical analyses, all variables were appropriately transformed (i.e. we applied square-root-transformation for substitution rates, and log10 transformation for
the number of alleles and animals sampled). We created a
dataset at the level of lineage by entering the corresponding allele counts, substitution rates and number of animals for each lineage screened. We used a one-way
ANOVA to identify species-specific and lineage-specific
effects separately, in which we tested for consistent variation in substitution rates within species or lineages as categories. We built a General Linear Model (GLM) to deal
with species and lineage effects simultaneously, and used
them as random factors to control for their unwanted
effects [75,76]. As we were interested in the relationships
between different substitution rates, we entered the focal
trait as the dependent variable, while the other was used
as independent variable (main factor) together with species and lineage categories (random factors). Data quality
varies from study to study, as the number of animals
screened ranges from few individuals to several hundreds,
which may affect the reliability of the calculated substitution rates from these samples. However, statistical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/73

approaches are available that allow control for heterogeneous data quality, as data points in the analyses can be
weighted based on the corresponding sample size [75,77].
Therefore, we also included the log10-transformed
number of animals sampled in the GLM model as statistical weight (we used log-transformed data to avoid overemphasizing data points with very large sample size).
From this model, we derived the statistics for the relationship in question, and translated it into a Pearson's correlation coefficient to illustrate the degree of association
between traits in a form of standard effect sizes [sensu
[78]]. When we assessed the link between substitution
rates and allelic variation, we created a model with the
number of alleles as the dependent variable, and with the
investigated substitution rate as the independent variable.
The model also included the number of animals, because
the absolute number of alleles found in a species is clearly
dependent on the number of animals sampled (F1,44 =
45.29, P < 0.001). Hence, we removed such sample-size
effects, and by entering the number of animals, we could
estimate the relative (residual) number of alleles as a
measure of MHC allelic variation. As earlier, the model
also incorporated the two random factors to account for
variations between species and lineages and used weights
to balance sample size differences. We report partial correlations for the focal traits, which should reflect the relationship between substitution rate and allelic
polymorphism when the confounding effects of species
and lineages are factored out.
At the cost of reducing statistical power, all analyses were
repeated by excluding lineages belonging to a 'W' workshop number, as non-orthologous HLA lineages may
involve different loci/lineages. In addition, we performed
analyses to fully remove the potentially confounding
effect of phylogenetic inertia, as different species and lineages may be differently related to each other due to
shared evolutionary history. To eliminate the problems
caused by the phylogenetic relatedness of allelic lineages,
we focused exclusively on the variation within a single lineage and tested for correlations at the interspecific level.
The phylogenetic relatedness of species was handled by
appropriate comparative approaches that take into
account the evolutionary trees of species [79]. We have
chosen the most characterised lineage, DRB1*03, to demonstrate how the observed patterns can shape MHC polymorphism across species. To achieve the control for
species-specific effects due to common descent in the
interspecific context of DRB1*03, we applied the general
method of phylogenetic analysis based on generalised
least-squares (PGLS) models [80,81] that incorporated
primate phylogeny [42] and statistical weights. In this
PGLS exercise, we combined variance factors due to phylogenetic and weight effects as error terms in a form of a
matrix exercise using the Q = V + cW equation, where V is

the phylogeny matrix, W is the diagonal matrix of 1/
weights and c is constant [80]. By varying c constant, we
calculated the maximum likelihood of different combinations of the phylogeny and weight matrices. At the combination, which offered the highest fit to the data as revealed
by the highest maximum likelihood, we determined the
effect size of interest in the form of Pearson's r. This result
was therefore obtained at the simultaneous adjustment
for phylogenetic inertia and heterogeneous data quality,
just as much as the data required [see [82]].
To avoid the potential problem arising from the combination of data across populations, we restricted our analyses
to clear population-level studies. To achieve this, we
repeated our procedures by strictly focusing on data from
well-defined populations only. This criterion was met in 4
studies [[49,57,65], N. G. de Groot and Ronald E. unpublished data for a Pan troglodytes population from Sierra
Leone], where information on the exact origin of individuals screened was available, and from this information we
could be ascertain that the data correspond to a single
population. Note that this restriction caused considerable
reduction in sample size and statistical power. Therefore,
for comparisons, we focus on effect sizes and not strictly
on significance levels [83,84]. Moreover, the low sample
size did not allow the construction of very complex models, thus it was not possible to simultaneously control for
species- and lineage-specific effects. We, therefore, only
included species-specific effects in the GLM design. However, we could use statistical weights as above.
We have chosen DRB6 sequences for the contrast analysis
of non-functioning lineages, because previous studies
showed that these lineages generally remain unexpressed,
even if the alleles included do not have insertions, deletions or stop codons [85,86]. Accordingly, we have
repeated the analyses with the DRB6 sequences that had
been excluded from the above tests relying on functioning
DRB lineages.
We avoided using dN:dS ratios in the statistical analyses.
Correlations with ratios may be difficult to interpret
because a given pattern may arise from the effect of the
numerator, the denominator or the combination of the
two [87]. Furthermore, our predictions were specifically
applied to the independent roles of non-synonymous and
synonymous substitution rates.
