Abstract
Background: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in
various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and
tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a
crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative
genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes
in vertebrates.
Description: We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes &
Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human,
mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with
them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci
using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A
significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for
transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as
transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system
development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes
and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding
proteins.
Conclusion: The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of
highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for
functional assay.

Background
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to cisregulatory elements and activate or repress transcription
of genes. Other proteins that are involved in transcriptional regulation and that could fall under the broad classification of TFs, include co-factors, chromatin
remodeling enzymes involved in chromatin or histone

modification affecting the transcriptional state of target
genes, and general transcription factors that associate
directly with RNA polymerase II in a transcription initiation complex. The human genome is estimated to contain
about 2,000 TF-encoding genes including co-factors, chromatin remodeling enzymes and general transcription factors [1]. TFs play crucial roles in development (e.g., HOX,

SOX and PAX proteins), cell cycle progression (e.g., cMYC, c-JUN), tumor suppression (e.g., p53, FOXO proteins) and cell differentiation (e.g., RUNX, DLX proteins).
The vast majority of TFs are known to regulate the expression of a number of different genes, and TF-encoding
genes themselves are the key targets of TFs, with many TFs
regulating the expression levels of their own genes. Thus,
TFs represent crucial nodes in the gene regulatory networks that determine the correct development of the body
plan and regulate various physiological processes. To gain
an understanding of these gene regulatory networks, it is
important to identify cis-regulatory elements associated
with TF-encoding genes and the TFs involved in the differential expression of TF-encoding genes. Mutations that
disrupt the cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes
have been implicated in genetic diseases such as aniridia
(disruption of PAX6 regulatory elements, [2]), Rieger syndrome (PITX2 [3,4]) and campomelic dysplasia (SOX9
[5]).
With the availability of whole genome sequences of several vertebrates, comparative genomics has proved to be a
powerful approach for identifying cis-regulatory elements
in vertebrate genomes. Since functional noncoding elements tend to evolve slowly due to selective pressure,
potential cis-regulatory elements can be identified as noncoding sequences that are conserved in distantly related
genomes. Whole-genome comparisons of human and
other vertebrates have indeed proved to be effective in
identifying functional cis-regulatory elements in the
human genome [6-11]. Notably, a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) identified in these
genome-wide comparisons were found to be associated
with TF-encoding and developmental genes. For example,
83% (1,140 out of 1,373) of CNEs (>70% identity/>100
bp alignment length) identified in genome-wide comparison of human and fugu were located in the vicinity of
about 120 human DNA-binding TF-encoding genes [10],
while 104 of the 290 human genes associated with
human-zebrafish CNEs (>70% identity/>80 bp sequence
length) were found to be TF-encoding genes [9]. In spite
of such a known association between TF-encoding genes
and CNEs, no systematic gene-by-gene comparison of all
the orthologous human and other vertebrate TF-encoding
genes has been carried out to identify potential cis-regulatory elements associated with them. Whole-genome comparisons, particularly between distantly related genomes
such as human and fish, fail to identify and align all the
orthologous sequences due to the stringent criterion of
local alignment algorithms. On the other hand, locus-bylocus comparison of orthologous TF-encoding genes is
more effective in identifying all the associated CNEs. Furthermore, because global alignment algorithms have an
additional assumption that input sequences occur in the
same order and orientation, they have more power in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/441

detecting weakly conserved regions than local alignments
[12,13]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that global alignment algorithms tend to miss conserved functional elements that have undergone local inversions and
rearrangements. Previously, orthologous TF-encoding
genes of human, rodents, fugu and zebrafish have been
compared [14-17]. However, such studies were promotercentric, with comparisons restricted to sequences flanking
the transcription start sites. The scope of such studies is
limited because cis-regulatory elements can be located at
considerable distance from transcription start sites, even
up to several hundred kilobases away [18]. More recently,
a selected set of developmentally regulated genes and
their associated conserved noncoding elements has been
reported [19]. This database includes many but not all of
the TF-encoding genes.
We have constructed a database of DNA-binding transcription factor-encoding genes in vertebrate genomes
and evolutionarily conserved noncoding elements associated with them. This database would be useful to researchers interested in studying the regulation of TF-encoding
genes and understanding gene regulatory networks in vertebrates.

Construction and Content
Human, mouse and fugu transcription factor genes
Sequences for 1,962 human TFs were obtained from [1]
and redundancies were removed by a homology search
against human RefSeq proteins. Several known proteins
missing from Messina et al.'s dataset (e.g., JMJ2A, JMJ2C,
JMJ2D, HES4 and DLX6) were included with the search
results and the resulting proteins were mapped to human
genes in Ensembl Release 37 [20]. The TFs were classified
by DNA-binding domains or if lacking a DNA-binding
domain, the TFs were classified separately into one of the
following categories: co-factors, general transcription factors, components of chromatin remodeling complexes
and transcriptional regulators that are involved solely in
protein-protein interactions (i.e., TFs with ZnF-PHD, ZnFBTB/POZ, ZnF-MYND domains). Mouse orthologs were
retrieved from Ensembl BioMart. Fugu orthologs were
identified using a combination of data from Ensembl
BioMart (fugu version 4 assembly) and INPARANOID
analysis [21]. Fishes contain duplicate copies for many
human genes due to a 'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication event in the fish lineage [22]. INPARANOID was
used to identify duplicate fugu orthologs for human TFs
that may have been missed in Ensembl. Only proteins
longer than 50 residues were used in the analysis. INPARANOID identified some many-to-many ortholog groups
which were resolved into smaller families based on phylogenetic analysis using PHYLIP [23] with sequences from
cartilaginous fishes, lamprey, amphioxus or Ciona intestinalis as the outgroup. For each family, multiple human

and fugu proteins and a single outgroup sequence were
aligned with ClustalW. Alignments with ungapped alignment length less than 50 residues were rejected and consensus trees were generated for the remaining alignments
using 1,000 bootstraps and the PHYLIP programs PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR (Neighbor-Joining method). Following the generation of phylogenetic trees, families were
resolved to one-to-one or one-to-two human-to-fugu gene
relationships based on visual inspection of the consensus
trees. TF-encoding genes present in clusters (linked to
each other on a chromosome/scaffold, with no intervening non-TF-encoding gene) in the genome were identified
using a pre-computed index of the relative locations of all
protein-coding genes in Ensembl Release 37. To avoid
redundancy in predicting conserved noncoding elements
associated with TF-encoding genes that reside in clusters,
we identified conserved clusters of human TF-encoding
genes whose orthologs in mouse and fugu are conserved
in the same order and orientation.
Aligning human-mouse-fugu TF-encoding gene loci and
identifying CNEs
The protocol used for identifying CNEs associated with
human TF-encoding genes is summarized in Fig 1.
Genomic sequences of human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding gene loci (spanning entire conserved clusters or singleton genes) including the entire 5' and 3' flanking regions
(up to the next gene upstream and downstream), were
retrieved from Ensembl Release 37. The sequences were
repeat-masked using RepeatMasker version open-3.1.5

[24]. Sequences of human, mouse and fugu orthologous
gene loci were aligned using MLAGAN [25]. Multiple
alignments between human, mouse and fugu sequences
were preferred over pair-wise alignments between human
and fugu sequences, because multiple alignments are generally more selective (fewer false positives) than pair-wise
alignments in the detection of regulatory elements [26]. A
global alignment strategy is suitable for our goal of aligning orthologous TF-encoding gene loci which are assumed
to occur in the same order and orientation. However, it
should be noted that global alignment algorithms are
unable to detect conserved functional elements that have
undergone local inversions and rearrangements.
Conserved noncoding sequences were visualized and
detected with VISTA [27] using the fugu sequence as the
reference sequence. Conserved noncoding sequences
between human and mouse were defined as regions with
minimum 70% identity over 100 bp of sequence [28].
Considering the longer evolutionary distance between
human and fugu, and the fact that BLASTZ alignments of
human and fugu genomes show that the alignable regions
cover only 1.8% of the human genome with an average
identity of 60% [6], we defined conserved noncoding
sequences between mammals and fugu as sequences that
display minimum 65% identity over 50 bp of sequence.
Any conserved noncoding sequences that overlapped with
protein-coding sequence (Ensembl Release 37 or BLASTX
search against NCBI's non-redundant proteome, E-value <
10-4) were eliminated. Pseudogenes and noncoding RNA
genes annotated in Ensembl Release 37 were also eliminated. Conserved noncoding sequences that contained
RNA genes were identified based on BLASTN (E-value <
10-4) and INFERNAL searches against Rfam (Release 7.0)
and miRBase (Release 8.0), and excluded from further
analysis. Sequences containing 20% or more microsatellite repeats (2 to 5 nucleotides with minimum 4 occurrences and minimum 10 bp in length) were also filtered
out. The remaining conserved noncoding sequences were
reclassified as conserved noncoding elements (CNEs).
CNEs were annotated as " 5' ", "intronic" or " 3' " based
on their location with respect to the protein-coding
sequence of human TF-encoding genes. CNEs that fall
within intergenic regions of TF-encoding genes are annotated with respect to both upstream and downstream
genes.
Analysis of CNE statistics for human TF-encoding genes
For every orthologous human TF-encoding gene, we determined the density, number and total length of humanfugu CNEs associated with that gene. CNE density is
defined as the number of bases residing in CNEs per unit
length (1 kilobase in human; 100 bp in fugu) of nonrepetitive noncoding sequence in a human gene locus or
the longest orthologous fugu gene locus. For genes that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/441

are part of conserved clusters, we averaged out the number
or length of CNEs present in the whole cluster over the
number of genes in that cluster. For CNE density, we averaged the total length of CNEs present in the whole cluster
over the non-repetitive noncoding sequence length of the
cluster.

CNE sequences) or 57.4% (average (A+T)-content for all
fugu CNE sequences). Overlapping binding sites bound
by the same TFs were removed, and only string matches
with log likelihood score ratio Lq > 0.98 and matrix
matches with core similarity Sc > 90% and matrix similarity Sm > 80% were retained.

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
To test the null hypothesis that human TF-encoding genes
containing human-fugu CNEs are independent of their
associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms, a Fisher's exact test
was applied in the GOstat package [29]. Gene Ontology
terms of genes that contained CNEs were submitted to
GOstat for analysis against all the human TF orthologs.
Two-tailed P-values were reported. Only the "biological
process" subset of GO hierarchy was considered. GO output was restricted to GO-terms with P-value < 0.01, and
the "false discovery rate" method [30] was used for multiple testing correction. The reference GO annotation was
retrieved from Ensembl BioMart for all human proteincoding genes.

Implementation of TFCONES database
The TFCONES database is housed in a MySQL server and
made accessible via an Apache web server. Perl scripts are
used to generate result pages in response to user queries.
The Generic Genome Browser [35] is used for the display
of CNEs on the human genome. A local wwwblast server
[36] has been set up to allow users to BLAST-search their
sequences against the CNEs in the TFCONES database. In
order to provide a set of high-confidence TF binding sites
located in CNEs that would be useful for experiments,
only human TF binding sites that overlap an orthologous
prediction in the fugu sequence are displayed in the database.

Utility and Discussion
Enrichment analysis of CNEs within experimentally
defined TF binding sites
The human-fugu CNEs that overlap with the binding sites
of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG [31], c-MYC [32] and SUZ12
[33] were identified, by comparing chromosomal coordinates of CNEs and TF bound regions and counting CNEs
with at least half of its length overlapped by a bound
region. Except the bound regions of c-MYC which were
identified by the ChIP-PET technique, all other bound
regions were identified by ChIP-on-chip.

To test the null hypothesis that the number of CNEs that
overlap experimentally validated TF binding sites is no
greater than that expected from CNEs that overlap randomized TF binding sites, a binomial distribution was
applied in the following way. For every bound region
identified by ChIP-on-chip, we generated a random
genomic region of the same length by randomly choosing
a probe present on the microarray chip and centering the
random genomic region on the chosen probe. For c-MYC,
random regions were sampled from the entire human
genome. After each randomization, the proportion of
CNEs that overlapped the random regions was determined. The random process was repeated 1000 times and
a binomial distribution was applied using the expectation
derived from the overlap of CNEs with random regions.
One-tailed P-values were calculated.
Prediction of TF binding sites
TF binding sites were detected in human-fugu CNEs using
TESS (TRANSFAC 4.0 data) [34]. Only vertebrate sites and
weight matrices were searched with background (A+T)content of 60.4% (average (A+T)-content for all human

Transcription factor-encoding genes in human, mouse and
fugu
In the TFCONES database, we have identified in total
1,738 human, 1,495 mouse and 1,762 fugu TF-encoding
genes. For the purpose of identifying conserved cis-regulatory elements associated with a set of TF-encoding genes
that regulate transcription in the same way (i.e., via DNAbinding), we excluded the co-factors, chromatin modifiers
and general transcription factors from further analysis and
focused on DNA-binding transcription factors. This
resulted in the identification of 1,327 sequence-dependent or DNA-binding transcription factors. Similarly, 1,086
and 1,328 DNA-binding TFs were identified in mouse and
fugu respectively. Almost all families of TFs, except C2H2type (cysteine2-histidine2) zinc finger proteins, contain a
higher number of genes in fugu than human and mouse
(Table 1). These additional TFs in fugu are likely to be the
result of the 'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication in
the fish lineage [22]. We identified the mouse and fugu
orthologs for human TF-encoding genes using reciprocal
BLAST and INPARANOID (see Construction and Content). Of the 1,327 human genes that encode DNA-binding transcription factors, 1,069 genes have orthologs in
mouse while 816 genes have orthologs in both mouse and
fugu. Fugu contains two or more orthologs for 36 human
TF-encoding genes (Additional data file 1).
Conserved clusters of TF-encoding genes in human, mouse
and fugu
TF-encoding genes such as Hox, Iroquois and Dlx genes
exist in clusters. The conservation of clustered organization of genes in distantly related genomes is thought to be
related to the presence of evolutionarily constrained

shared enhancers [37-39]. We identified a total of 149
clusters of human TF-encoding genes containing 407
genes, 95 clusters of mouse TF-encoding genes containing
253 genes, and 115 clusters of fugu TF-encoding genes
containing 280 genes (Additional data files 2, 3 and 4). Of
these clusters, 18 orthologous clusters comprising 70 TFencoding genes were found to be conserved in order and
orientation in all three genomes (Additional data file 5).
These evolutionarily conserved TF-encoding gene clusters
are likely to be associated with evolutionarily constrained
shared enhancers. This set includes instances such as
HoxD cluster which has been shown to contain conserved
enhancers that regulate several genes in the cluster [37].
Among these clusters, the identification of CNEs in the
four human Hox gene clusters has been previously
reported [40].

Identification of human-mouse and human-fugu CNEs
After alignment of the orthologous human, mouse and
fugu TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN [25] and
detection of CNEs using VISTA [27] and subsequent filtering steps, of the 816 human-mouse-fugu orthologous TFencoding genes, 797 genes contain 58,954 human-mouse
CNEs, whereas 389 genes contain 2,843 human-fugu
CNEs. The human-mouse and human-fugu CNEs represent 5.7% and 0.15% respectively, of noncoding
sequences extracted for alignments. The distribution of
the lengths of human-mouse and human-fugu CNEs are
presented in Additional data file 6. The human-mouse
CNEs are on average 244 bp long (median is 183 bp; longest is 3.9 kb) and add up to a total length of 14,375 kb.
The average length of human-fugu CNEs is 136 bp
(median is 106 bp; longest is 1.0 kb) and the total length
is 388 kb. Whole-genome comparison of human and
mouse has indicated that about 5% of human and mouse
sequences are under evolutionary constraint [41], of
which 3.5% are noncoding sequences. The "Gumby" algorithm developed by Prabhakar et al. [42] which is based
on human-rodent sequence comparisons and enforces
significance thresholds, predicts that only 2.2% of noncoding sequences in the human and rodent genomes are
likely to be under selection. It is, therefore, likely that a
considerable number of the human-mouse CNEs are not
under evolutionary constraint but rather sequences that
did not have adequate time to diverge. On the other hand,
most of the human-fugu CNEs which are conserved over
a long evolutionary period (420 Myr) are likely to be
under purifying selection. To verify this, we determined if
the human-fugu CNEs significantly overlap with experimentally validated transcription factor binding sites. We
also computed the density and distribution of humanfugu CNEs among TF-encoding genes. The results of these
analyses are presented below.
Density and number of human-fugu CNEs per gene
Since we used the entire 5' and 3' flanking regions in our
alignments, we investigated whether genes with larger
flanking regions were associated with more human-fugu
CNEs than genes with short flanking regions. To this end,
we calculated the density of human-fugu CNEs in human
TF-encoding genes. The CNE densities of human genes
vary widely from 0.03 to 38 bp per kb of human sequence
for the 389 CNE-associated genes (Fig 2). The top 20
human TF-encoding genes with the highest CNE densities
are listed in Table 2. These genes are characteristically
homeodomain-encoding genes such as the genes
XP_496843 (Uncx4.1), XP_291716 (HMX3), NP_005510
(HMX2), LMO1 and PBX3. The high CNE densities of
these genes indicate that a large proportion of their noncoding regions are under evolutionary constraint. To
determine if the compaction of intergenic regions in fugu
has affected CNE density, we also measured CNE densities

clusters, we averaged out the number or length of CNEs present in the whole cluster over the number of genes in that cluster. CNE
density is defined here as the number of bases located in CNEs per kilobase of non-repetitive noncoding sequence in a gene locus.

number of bases residing in CNEs per 100 bp of the longest orthologous fugu gene locus. The CNE density in fugu
also ranges widely from 0.02 to 67 bp per 100 bp of fugu

genic regions have not been compacted or expanded
uniformly in fugu and human, respectively.
The number of CNEs associated with each gene gives an
indication of the number of conserved cis-regulatory elements in each of these genes. The top 20 human genes
with the highest number and total length of human-fugu
CNEs are shown in Table 3. The MEIS2 locus contains the
highest number and total length of CNEs (79 CNEs spanning 12.0 kb) (Fig 3). In mammals, Meis2 is involved in
the differentiation of the forebrain, branchial arches and
somitic mesoderm as well as in regulating limb outgrowth
[43,44]. The next gene with the most CNEs is IRX3 (68
CNEs spanning 10.9 kb). IRX3 is expressed in certain
regions of the midbrain, hindbrain, otic vesicle, spinal
cord, first and second branchial arches and proximodorsal
regions of the developing limb buds [45]. The association
of an abundance of CNEs with TF-encoding genes such as
MEIS2 and IRX3 that show spatially restricted expression
patterns in a wide range of tissues is consistent with the
notion that these CNEs represent regulatory modules that
direct expression to different expression domains. At the
other end of the spectrum are the TF-encoding genes that
do not contain any human-fugu CNEs. TF-encoding genes
that lack CNEs and exhibit ubiquitous expression (e.g.,
SP1, USF1, E2F1) may contain strong basal promoters
and lack tissue-specific enhancers. In the case of CNElacking TF-encoding genes that exhibit tissue-specific
expression, the divergent regulatory elements in human
and fugu may still confer the same expression patterns in

human and fugu as demonstrated in the case of human
and zebrafish RET gene regulatory elements [46]. It is also
possible that some of these divergent regulatory elements
may have conferred different patterns of expression in
human and fugu.
Human-fugu CNEs overlap experimentally verified TF
binding sites indicating they contain transcriptional
regulatory elements
The recent advances in the high-throughput techniques
for identifying in vivo binding sites of TFs such as ChIP-onchip/ChIP-PET have enabled genome-wide mapping of
binding sites for TFs such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, cMYC and SUZ12 [31-33]. Although genome-wide ChIP
analysis has a certain level of noise and does not give conclusive evidence of transcriptional regulation, it provides
a good estimate of putative regulatory elements. If the
human-fugu CNEs identified by us represent transcriptional regulatory elements, a significant proportion of
them should overlap with experimentally verified TF
binding sites. To verify this we searched the human-fugu
CNEs against the human genome sequences that were
shown to be bound by various TFs ("bound regions").

The TFs OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG are crucial for the
maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells and are necessary for propagation of
undifferentiated ES cells in culture [31]. These factors activate the transcription of their own genes and genes of
major signaling pathways, but repress the transcription of

some developmental genes [31]. Sequences bound by
these TFs within promoter regions of genes in human ES
cells were taken from Boyer et al. [31]. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs were found to overlap
bound regions of OCT4 (0.63% of human-fugu CNEs; P =
1.82 Ã 10-17), SOX2 (0.84% of human-fugu CNEs; P =
8.83 Ã 10-18) and NANOG (1.27% of human-fugu CNEs;
P = 3.44 Ã 10-26). The transcription factor c-MYC plays
important roles in regulating cell growth, cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis [47]. The genomic bound
regions of c-MYC in human B cells were recently identified
using ChIP-PET experiments [32]. In total, about 4,300
high-confidence bound regions of c-MYC were identified
to be associated with 668 target genes, of which 48 encode
TFs [32]. We found that 0.49% of the human-fugu CNEs
overlap c-MYC bound regions, constituting a significant
enrichment of c-MYC binding sites in CNEs (P = 4.44 Ã
10-5). SUZ12 is a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 which is involved in silencing of genes through the
epigenetic modification of chromatin structure [33]. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs (10.45%; P =
1.53 Ã 10-316) were found to overlap SUZ12 bound
regions in human ES cells [33]. The significant association
of human-fugu CNEs with experimentally verified TF
binding sites of both transcriptional activators and repressors, indicates that a significant proportion of CNEs are
functional transcriptional enhancers and silencers.

TF-encoding genes associated with CNEs tend to be
involved in nervous system development
To determine the relationship between human-fugu CNEs
and biological functions of TF-encoding genes, the Gene
Ontology (GO) terms describing the biological processes
of CNE-associated TF-encoding genes (385 genes with
Gene Ontology annotation) were compared with that of
all human TF orthologs (804 genes with Gene Ontology
annotation) using GOstat [29]. TF-encoding genes associated with CNEs were found to be significantly enriched
for genes involved mainly in development, and in particular development of the nervous system (P < 0.01) (Additional data file 8). In contrast, TF-encoding genes that are
associated with CNEs are depleted of genes involved in
protein metabolism and biopolymer modification (P <
0.01) (Additional data file 8; P-values marked with a negative sign). The significant involvement of CNE-associated TF-encoding genes in nervous system development is
consistent with previous studies that highlight the associ-

ation of highly conserved noncoding regions with developmental genes [6,8,10].
Potential utility of the TFCONES database
We have created a database called TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding
ElementS) that contains information about the list of TFencoding genes in human, mouse and fugu genomes,
their orthologous relationships, and details of the CNEs
associated with them (Figs 4, 5 and 6). This set of humanmouse-fugu orthologous genes and their associated CNEs
should be useful to researchers investigating the regulation and function of genes in mammals as well as in
fishes. For every CNE, the data presented include the
VISTA alignment, length, percentage identity, genomic
location and the genes flanking the CNE. The users may
search for specific human, mouse or fugu TF-encoding
genes and retrieve the sequences of the human-mouse and
human-fugu CNEs. The CNEs can be visualized in relation

to the nearest TF-encoding gene using the GBrowse feature
(Fig 7; [35]). The CNE database can also be BLASTsearched. To assist those interested in testing the function
of potential TF binding sites within the human-fugu
CNEs, we have predicted TF binding sites in the humanfugu CNEs using TESS [34]. While the human-fugu CNEs
would be useful for scientists investigating evolutionarily
conserved cis-regulatory elements that are likely to be
shared by all vertebrates, the human-mouse CNEs should
be of interest to researchers investigating cis-regulatory
elements specific to mammals. In addition, TF-encoding
genes that differentially express in certain tissues may be
studied in greater detail to explore the gene regulatory networks active in those tissues. For instance, the CNEs that
are associated with TF-encoding genes expressed in the
central nervous system may be crucial in mediating
expression precisely to distinct populations of neuronal
and glial cells. These CNEs would be useful tools for
marking cell-types through driving expression of reporter
genes and will also act as useful reagents for targeting
expression of therapeutic proteins to specific cell-types.

Conclusion
TFs are the most crucial nodes in the gene regulatory networks that underlie the developmental plan and physiological systems of vertebrates. The evolutionarily
conserved noncoding elements associated with TF-encoding genes in the TFCONES database represent a highly prioritized set of cis-regulatory sequences. These elements
and the transcription factor binding sites identified in
them should be useful for understanding the regulation of
spatially restricted expression patterns of TF-encoding
genes.
