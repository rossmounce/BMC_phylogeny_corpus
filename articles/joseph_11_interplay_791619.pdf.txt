genomes of Chlamydia trachomatis

Abstract
Background: Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial parasite, which causes several severe and
debilitating diseases in humans. This study uses comparative genomic analyses of 12 complete published C.
trachomatis genomes to assess the contribution of recombination and selection in this pathogen and to
understand the major evolutionary forces acting on the genome of this bacterium.
Results: The conserved core genes of C. trachomatis are a large proportion of the pan-genome: we identified 836
core genes in C. trachomatis out of a range of 874-927 total genes in each genome. The ratio of recombination
events compared to mutation (r/θ) was 0.07 based on ancestral reconstructions using the ClonalFrame tool, but
recombination had a significant effect on genetic diversification (r/m = 0.71). The distance-dependent decay of
linkage disequilibrium also indicated that C. trachomatis populations behaved intermediately between sexual and
clonal extremes. Fifty-five genes were identified as having a history of recombination and 92 were under positive
selection based on statistical tests. Twenty-three genes showed evidence of being under both positive selection
and recombination, which included genes with a known role in virulence and pathogencity (e.g., ompA, pmps,
tarp). Analysis of inter-clade recombination flux indicated non-uniform currents of recombination between clades,
which suggests the possibility of spatial population structure in C. trachomatis infections.
Conclusions: C. trachomatis is the archetype of a bacterial species where recombination is relatively frequent yet
gene gains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and losses (by deletion) are rare. Gene conversion occurs at sites
across the whole C. trachomatis genome but may be more often fixed in genes that are under diversifying
selection. Furthermore, genome sequencing will reveal patterns of serotype specific gene exchange and selection
that will generate important research questions for understanding C. trachomatis pathogenesis.

Background
Genetic variation is essential for the long term survival
of bacteria [1]. Mutation and recombination are the
basic processes by which genetic variation emerges in
bacterial populations [2]. Recombination is the incorporation into a genome of imported DNA, and leads to
the introduction of novel sequences in the chromosome
as well as the creation of loci with mosaic genes (new
haplotypes) [2-4]. Recombination plays a major role in
the potential for adaptation of a bacterial population
[1,5,6]. The traces of homologous recombination have

been detected through comparative analysis of the genomes of many bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus spp [1], Listeria monocytogenes [7]Campylobacter
[8], Escherichia coli [9], Chlamydia spp [10] and Salmonella spp [11], and can constitute a much faster mode
of evolution than point mutations [4,12,13]. On the
other hand, analysis of selective pressures based on the
relative rates of non-synonymous and synonymous
mutations of natural bacterial populations has revealed
the direction and strength of natural selection on coding
sequences [8,14]. Several gene-specific [15-22] as well as
whole genome analyses [1,7,11,23-26] of pathogenic bacterial populations have suggested positive selection in
virulence genes that enhance host infection potential.

At the population level, natural selection acts on the
basic processes of mutation and recombination, causing
some events to be quickly purged from the population
and others to become widespread [2]. In a perfectly clonal population, every advantageous mutation is linked to
other alleles in the genome [7,14]. Recombination can
play an important role in evolution by combining advantageous mutations and thereby assisting in their fixation
[7,14]. During the adaptation of a bacterial population
to a new ecological niche, selective pressures are shifted,
resulting in a higher or lower rate of recombination
and/or changes in genetic flux, depending on the exact
conditions [2]. Recombination and positive selection are
therefore two important evolutionary forces in microbial
pathogens that drive adaptation to new hosts, resistance
to the action of antibiotics and promote survival in the
face of host immune challenge [1,7,11,16,27].
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular
bacterial species that causes ocular diseases and sexually
transmitted diseases in humans worldwide [28]. However, progress toward understanding the biology of C.
trachomatis has been hindered by the requirement for
intracellular growth and the lack of a routine system for
directed mutagenesis [10]. C. trachomatis isolates are
differentiated into serovars based on serospecificity for
the major outer membrane protein (MOMP; encoded by
the gene ompA) [29]. Serovars that are restricted to the
epithelial cells of the eye and genital tract include: (1)
ocular, trachoma serovars A to C and Ba; although B,
Ba and C serovars are found in the genital tract but less
frequently; (2) non-invasive sexually transmitted disease
causing serovars D to K, Da, Ia, and Ja; these serovars
also infect the conjunctiva and cause a self-limited conjunctivitis; and (3) invasive serovars L1, L2, L3 and L2a
and L2b that cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).
L 2b has been described recently in Europe and North
America as an outbreak strain responsible for hemorrhagic proctitis [30]. To date, there is only one wholegenome based analysis (limited to three C. trachomatis
strains) that investigated selective pressures by calculating the ratio of the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations [26], while gene-based experiments identified the gene coding for major outer membrane protein (ompA) to be under natural selection
[31-35]. Evidence for recombination and recombination
hotspots were initially identified in gene-based studies
[36-39]. Experimental studies using a naturally occurring
ofloxacin resistant strain (with mutation in gyrA) and a
naturally occurring rifampacin resistant strain (with
mutation in rpoB) resulted in the isolation of a strain
resistant to both antibiotics that carried both mutations
[39,40]. Similarly it was shown that nonfusogenic strains
of C. trachomatis that lack inclusion membrane protein
A (IncA), a protein involved in homotypic inclusion

fusion, still recombine in vitro when subjected to the
same selection parameters [41]. Previous studies based
on whole-genome analysis used limited strains [10] and
MLST analysis [42] to identify potential recombination
targets in C. trachomatis. We recently identified a
recombinant clinical isolate isolated from a man who
has sex with men (MSM) comprised of an invasive LGV
strain and a non-invasive common urogenital strain D
that, on genome-wide analysis, was found to have seven
discrete regions of genetic exchange, including genes
involved in inclusion formation and replication [43].
However, the magnitude of recombination in C. trachomatis on a genome-wide level using multiple strains has
not been characterized before.
Advances in genome sequencing technologies [44]
have facilitated the generation of whole-genome
sequences of the various C. trachomatis serovars, which
paved the way to look into the population biology of
this commonly encountered yet still mysterious bacterium [10,28]. Understanding the evolutionary processes
behind disease tropism and severity in C. trachomatis
strains will lead to better use of medical countermeasures. One question of particular importance is whether
mutations arising from selection in genes for host tropism or increased virulence may be transmitted frequently to other members of the species through
recombination. In order to assess the contributions of
recombination and selection in this pathogen, we performed a comparative analysis of 12 published complete
C. trachomatis genomes.

Materials and methods
Genome data and Ortholog retrieval

Our data consisted of the complete sequences of twelve
finished genomes of Chlamydia trachomatis and one
genome of Chlamydia muridarum, obtained from GenBank (Table 1). Coding sequences were extracted from
NCBI RefSeq annotation and the orthologs were determined using OrthoMCL [45]. OrthoMCL uses reciprocal
best BLASTp scores in a normalized similarity matrix
that is analyzed using an additional step of Markov
Clustering to improve sensitivity and specificity.
OrthoMCL was run with a BLAST E-value cut-off of
1e-05, and an inflation parameter of 1.5. We defined the
core genes as the orthologous genes that are shared by
all C. trachomatis strains.
Alignments and Phylogenetic Inference

The program MUSCLE [46] was used for multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) of the core protein-coding
genes using default settings. The resulting protein alignments were reverse-translated to codon-based nucleotide alignments using PAL2NAL [47], which used the
corresponding DNA sequences for positive selection

analysis (see below), and another set of protein alignments were filtered by GBLOCKS [48] using default settings to remove regions that contained gaps or were
highly divergent. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
using the TREE-PUZZLE [49] and PHYLIP [50]
packages. The evolutionary distances were computed by
TREE-PUZZLE where the parameters were set to the
JTT substitution model, the mixed model of rate heterogeneity with one invariant and eight gamma rate categories, and using the exact and slow parameter
estimation. The level of bootstrap support for each gene
was inferred by 200 resamplings of the alignment using
SEQBOOT in the PHYLIP package. Whole-genome
trees (species tree) were constructed based on the concatenated alignment of all individual core genes following the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony
(MP) methods. NJ trees were constructed using NEIGBOR in the PHYLIP package and the extended majority
rule consensus tree was inferred for each core gene. The
MP tree was constructed using PROTPARS in the PHYLIP package with 100 randomizations of input order
and 4 clades were defined (Figure 1).

whole-genome (species) tree (Figure 1). Initially, the
inferred whole-genome tree was used for all PAML analyses. For all genes that were identified as being under
positive selection, Test 1 and Test 2 PAML were re-run
to check if the positive selection results obtained using

Analysis of Positive Selection

Genes under positive selection were identified using
codeml as implemented in PAML version 4.4 [51]. Two
types of tests were implemented in PAML to identify
genes under positive selection: Test 1 was carried out
using the null model M1a (Nearly-neutral) and the
alternative model M2a (positive selection) [52], whereas
Test 2 was carried out to identify genes under positive
selection in specific branches of C. trachomatis (branchsite test2 described by Zhang et al. [53]). Test 1 identified genes under positive selection in any or all of the
branches of a given phylogeny while Test 2 identified
genes under positive selection in the four clades of the

C. trachomatis strains along with one C. muridarum (out-group) are
represented in this tree. The phylogeny was constructed based on
the concatenated alignment of all individual core genes (286,496
amino acid sites) by both NJ and MP procedures. Both NJ and MP
analysis inferred the same tree. The numbers represent bootstrap
values.

gene-specific trees differed from that of the whole genome tree (Figure 1). For each test, the likelihood of a
model that does not allow positive selection (null
model) was compared to a model that allows positive
selection (alternative model) using a Likelihood Ratio
Test (LRT) [53]. For branch-specific tests (Test 2), one
degree of freedom was used to calculate p-values, while
for the overall test (Test 1), 2 degrees of freedom were
used to calculate p-values. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini & Hochberg
method [54] implemented in the software Q-value [55].
Analysis of intragenic recombination

To detect homologous intragenic recombination in the
gene clusters, we implemented the following four methods: (1) Pairwise Homoplasy Index (PHI) (2) Neighbor
Similarity Score (NSS) (3) Maximum c2, and (4) Sawyer’s
Runs test [56,57]. The first three methods were implemented using the PhiPack package [6] while the Sawyer’s
Runs test was implemented in GENECONV version
1.81a. For PHI, a window size of 50 nucleotides was used.
For Maximum c2, a fixed window size of two thirds of
the number of polymorphic sites was used. For GENECONV analyses, the parameter g-scale was set to 1 and
only the inner fragments were considered. P-values were
estimated by employing 10,000 permutations of the alignment for GENECONV and 1,000 permutations for the
other three methods. For the above four recombination
detection methods, we removed C. muridarum genes
because of the much greater evolutionary separation of
this genome from the other twelve. MSAs on the clusters
identified by OrthoMCL minus the C. muridarum genes
were recomputed using MUSCLE.

extracted from each of the 4 clades, and for each of them
we searched for the strain(s) with the highest normalized
BLASTN score along with a percent identity (pcident) of
at least 98% in the whole database containing all the ‘finished’ genome and plasmid sequences of Chlamydiaceae
bacterial species minus the strains of the clade affected by
the import. If all the best hits were with strains belonging
to the same clade, the origin of the event was attributed to
this clade, and otherwise the origin was called ambiguous.
Calculation of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)

To illustrate the distance-dependent decay of LD, we
adopted the method implemented by Sharpiro et al.,
2009 [14]. We used the core orthologs (836 genes) that
are present in one copy per genome in each of the 12
C. trachomatis strains and each unique allele was
assigned a unique allele number. We then selected pairs
of loci separated by increasing distance in the C. trachomatis D/UW-3/CX reference genome. Neighboring loci
on the same strand were excluded. LD between 2 pairs
of loci was estimated using the D’A metric [61]

which provides a summary measure of LD between
two loci, with allele frequencies p and q, each containing
m and n number of arbitrary alleles and D’ij represents
the normalized amount of linkage disequilibrium that
accounts for the variation of the allele frequencies.
When D’A = 1, linkage is at its theoretical maximum.

Evolutionary analysis using ClonalFrame

Ortholog Identification and Genome Phylogeny of C.
trachomatis

ClonalFrame [58] is a statistical approach to reconstructing the clonal genealogy while identifying genomic fragments that have been affected by recombination and
accounting for their disrupting effect. A whole genome
sequence alignment of the 12 C. trachomatis genomes
was created using progressive Mauve [59,60] and the
core alignment was extracted by keeping only the regions
where all genomes aligned over at least 500 bp. Four
independent runs of ClonalFrame were performed, each
consisting of 40,000 iterations. The first half of these
iterations was discarded as MCMC burn-in. Good convergence and mixing properties were found by manual
comparison between the four runs, making sure that they
produced consistent estimates of the global parameters,
clonal genealogy and location of recombination events.
We defined putative imports for each branch of the ClonalFrame tree as a genomic region for which the probability of recombination never goes below 80% and reaches
95% in at least one site. Such putative imports were

In order to improve our understanding of the evolution
and population structure of C. trachomatis, we performed full genome analyses for homologous recombination and positive selection using the complete and
published genomes of twelve C. trachomatis strains. Our
analysis for recombination and positive selection was
focused on the core genome. From the 12 C. trachomatis strains and the one C. muridarum (strain Ng, outgroup) (Table 1) used in this study, we identified 818
single-copy genes shared by all 13 strains. After excluding C. muridarum, the number of single-copy genes
went up to 836 genes shared by all 12 C. trachomatis
strains. Core genes represent more than 90% of the
annotated genes from the smallest genome (L2 and L2b
strains) used in this study (Table 1). This result is in
line with the known high level of synteny and genome
sequence conservation [28]. The analysis also shows that
the mouse-infecting species C. muridarum shares more
than 90% of the core gene set of C. trachomatis. It has

been suggested that the majority of apparent disparity in
gene content might be caused by differences in the gene
predictions rather than being real differences in the presence or absence of genes [28]. For the purpose of phylogenetic inference, we used the 818 single-copy genes
shared by all 13 strains.
The phylogeny of C. trachomatis was inferred using
two different approaches. The first approach utilized a
concatenated alignment of 286,496 amino acid residues
of the 818 translated core genes followed by NJ and MP
phylogenetic inference, and the second approach was
based on ClonalFrame analysis. Both approaches yielded
trees with the same topology (Figures 1 &2), based on
which we defined the following four clades (Figure 1):
clade 1 contained L 2 and L 2 b (LGV strains), clade 2
contained E/11023 and E/150 (non-invasive prevalent
sexually transmitted strains), clade 3 contained B/Tz, B/
Jali and A/HAR13 (trachoma strains) and clade 4 contained D/UW3, G11074, G11222, G/9301 and G9768.
Clade 4 contained both non-invasive prevalent (D/UW3)
and non-prevalent (G) strains.
Substitution analysis reveals widespread recombination
across the C. trachomatis genome

Based on the four-substitution analysis methods (PHI,
NSS, Maximum c2 and GENECONV) implemented for

detecting intragenic homologous recombination, 55
genes showed significant evidence for recombination
(p < 0.05) in at least one of the four-recombination analysis performed. GENECONV, PHI, NSS and Maximum
c2 respectively identified 28, 13, 21 and 47 orthologs
with significant evidence for recombination (p < 0.05)
(Additional File 1; Figure 3). A total of 24, 16, 5 and 8
orthologs showed significant evidence for recombination
in one, two, three and all four methods, respectively
(Additional File 1 & Table 2). The 8 genes identified as
having undergone recombination by all 4 methods were
three polymorphic outer membrane protein genes
(pmpE (CT869), pmpF (CT870) &pmpH (CT872)), two
hypothetical protein genes (CT049, CT144), Type III
secretion structural protein gene (yscC (CT674), the
major outer membrane protein gene (ompA (CT681))
and the gene encoding elongation factor Ts (tsf
(CT679)) (Table 2). Our analysis also identified pmpG
(NSS, MaxChi) and pmpI (MaxChi) as having undergone recombination. Other membrane proteins detected
to have been subject to homologous recombination
were yhgN family protein gene (CT852), putative integral protein genes (CT580, CT838), inclusion membrane
protein D genes (CT115, CT288) and ABC transporter
membrane protein gene (CT686). The complete list of
genes that showed evidence for gene conversion based

identified to be both under recombination and positive selection.

on substitution analysis in this study is shown in Table
2 and Additional File 1.
Evidence for Positive Selection

Using PAML we identified 62 (Additional File 2) genes
(7.58% of the genome) under positive selection (FDR <
10%) with the overall test (Test 1), while the clade specific tests (Test 2) identified respectively 7, 4, 18 and 40
genes in clades 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Additional File 3; Figure
3). No genes were found to be under positive selection
in all 4 clades. A high proportion of positively selected
genes in clades 1, 2, 3 and 4 were only under selection
in one clade (71%, 77%, 61% and 100% respectively).

Page 6 of 16

Test 1 identified 11 genes associated with membrane
and transport system associated proteins such as the
major outer membrane protein gene (ompA), polymorphic outer membrane protein genes (pmpE and
pmpF), putative integral membrane protein gene
(CT012, CT147, CT580), inclusion membrane protein
genes (CT115, CT288), translocated actin-recruiting
protein gene (tarp) (CT456) and oligopeptide transport
system binding protein genes (oppA_1 & oppA_3) to be
under positive selection. Nineteen genes were identified
as being under positive selection with both Test 1 and
Test 2 (Table 3).
Among the 92 genes that showed evidence for positive
selection by either Test 1 or Test 2, 23 genes (Figure 3,
Table 4) also showed evidence for recombination,
including 9, 6, 2 and 6 genes showing evidence for intragenic homologous recombination in one, two, three and
all four methods, respectively. The correlation between
recombination being detected by at least one method
(55 genes out of 836) and positive selection being
detected by at least one test (92 genes out of 836) was
statistically significant (Fisher’s Exact Test, p-value
< 0.001).
Recombination analysis using ClonalFrame

The impact of recombination on C. trachomatis genomes was further quantified by applying the ClonalFrame algorithm to whole genome sequences in order
to estimate the number of recombination events. ClonalFrame estimated two statistics namely, r/θ and r/m,
where the former is the ratio of the rates at which
recombination and mutation occur while the latter is

the ratio of rates at which sites are altered through
recombination and mutation. r/θ measured how often
recombination events happened relative to mutation and
r/m measured how important the effect of recombination was in the diversification of the bacterial species
relative to mutation [58]. These two statistics can be
used to assess the relative contribution of recombination
and mutation in the evolution of the strains from a
common ancestor.
ClonalFrame estimated the 95% credibility interval of
r/θ, to be 0.05-0.11 (mean = 0.07). This indicates that
mutation, despite an abundance of recombination events,
has been the predominant evolutionary process in C. trachomatis. The 95% credibility interval of r/m was 0.561.01 (mean = 0.71), indicating that, unlike mutation,
recombination often affects several nucleotides at each
occurrence. The higher rate of r/m illustrates that the
impact of recombination on genetic diversity in C. trachomatis has been significant. We found the mean tract
length of recombined fragments to be 202 bp. This is
similar to what has been found in other natural populations of bacteria [2], but is smaller than was observed in
laboratory experiments with C. trachomatis [37-39]. Such
discrepancy in the lengths of recombination events measured in vivo and in vitro has previously been described
in H. pylori [62] and E. coli [9]. It has been suggested that
this difference might be due to the fact that in nature,
larger events are more likely to reduce fitness and therefore be purged before observation [2,17]. Figure 2 shows

the distribution of recombination events inferred on the
branches of the clonal genealogy along the genome of
C. trachomatis. Ninety-four clear events were found in
clade 1, 52 in clade 2, 50 in clade 3 and 62 in clade 4.
Clade 1 containing the LGV strains showed the highest
number of recombination events that corroborated with
previously identified possible inter-strain recombination
for LGV [26].
Inter-clade recombination flux

ClonalFrame does not model the origin of recombination
events [58]. Instead, it requires post-processing of its output to determine where each event is likely to have come
from [2,63]. We performed such an analysis as described
in the Methods section, and assigned to each recombination event a putative origin. These results provided an
insight into the pattern of genetic exchange between C.
trachomatis clades. Figure 4 summarizes the flow of
recombination events with an unambiguous origin that
affected members of each clade. Seventy-four inter-clade
imports were detected, with more inter-clade DNA
exchange between clades 1 and 2 and between clades 3
and 4 indicating uneven historical levels of genetic
exchange between clades (Additional File 4).

aureus), while others are almost panmictic (e.g. Neisseria
gonorrhoeae) [14,64]. Previous studies have demonstrated
that in many recombining lineages such as Camplylobacter [65], Neisseria [17], Helicobacter and E. coli, LD decays
with relative distance on the genomes. To illustrate this
effect in C. trachomatis, we implemented an in silico
experiment as described in the Methods section. Genes up
to ~20 kb apart are found to be linked, but this linkage
drops off at approximately 100 kb (Figure 5), similar to
what has been observed in a study using the same methodology with 24 E. coli strains [14], even though the drop in
the actual magnitude of LD is larger in E. coli compared to
that of C. trachomatis (Figure 5).

Discussion
In this study we used 12 complete published genomes to
provide the first global insight into the processes of
recombination and positive selection in C. trachomatis.
The ClonalFrame reconstruction indicated a steady rate
of recombination in the history of the organism, estimated at one recombination event for every 5-10 mutations. Moreover, recombination events were distributed
throughout the genome. This corroborates with the
finding that all contemporary C. trachomatis strains
have maintained intact recA genes and relatively complete recombination systems [66]. It is notable that the
summary statistic based detection methods employed

here (GENECONV, PHI, NSS and Maximum c2) only
suggested a total of 55 genes with a history of recombination. Detection of recombination in aligned sequences
is quite variable [2] and the relative lack of sequence
variation in C. trachomatis may have dampened trace
detection thresholds.

Ninety-two genes showed significant evidence of positive selection. Of these, 23 genes showed overwhelming
evidence of both positive selection and recombination.
Studies in other pathogens [1,21] have also found
recombination and positive selection occurring in tandem, especially in genomic regions coding for proteins
involved in pathogenicity. Recombination may be effective in fixing beneficial mutations and removing deleterious ones, thus allowing a faster increase of fitness in
the population under a wide range of conditions [14].
These 23 genes could represent situations where gene
variants advantageous for C. trachomatis infection have
been transmitted to other members of the species
through gene conversion. A number of these genes have
already been found in previous studies in C. trachomatis
to have unusual levels of SNPs and genomic variation.
ompA has been shown to be under selective immune
and antibiotic pressure [32,67-69], which is consistent
with the fact that it encodes MOMP, the immunodominant and most abundant protein of the elementary body
(EB), the infectious form of Chlamydia. In addition,
intragenic recombination was discovered within ompA
[32,69] involving T cell epitopes and also in the regions
immediately flanking this gene that were statistically
shown to be hotspots for recombination [38]. The Pmp
family, including PmpE and PmpF, are considered outer
membrane proteins that play a role in antigenic variation and host immunity [70-72]. Indeed, PmpF was
recently found to contain a high number of MHC class
II epitopes in a region with significant amino acid variation among strains, indicating that the protein is likely
under immune selection [73]. TARP is translocated into
the host cell during EB attachment and is essential for
cytoskeletal rearrangement that allows both entry of the
organism and containment of the EB within an inclusion
for subsequent replication [74]. Genetic variation within
tarp (CT456), the gene that encodes TARP, tends to be
similar for strains that are associated with the same disease phenotype, suggesting that the protein may be
involved in niche-specific host adaptation [75]. Other
important genes worth mentioning include incD
(CT115; involved in development of the nascent C. trachomatis inclusion required for replication [76]), DNAdirected RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB; responsible for antibiotic resistance in many bacteria including
C. trachomatis [56]) and heat shock protein 60
(groEL_2; a chaperon that is exposed on the cell surface
and released by the cell during stress that may be
involved in tissue pathology [77-79] and autoimmunity
[35,43] While less is known about the role in virulence
of some of the other genes (especially the hypothetical
protein genes) revealed to have a history of positive
selection and recombination, our screen suggests they
may be important.

Page 10 of 16

We are limited in our ability to discover recent
recombination events by having only 12 completed genomes. However, we recently discovered an LGV strain
that is a recombinant with strain D that involves tarp
and other genes important in organism development
and survival within the host cell [43]. Other genes with
strong evidence from non-genome based screens that
we did not identify in this study include the histone-H1like protein gene (hctB; CT046), tryptophan synthase
alpha chain gene (trpA; CT171), CTP synthtase (pyrG,
CT183), hypothetical protein (CT360) and toxin gene
(CT456) as having undergone homologous recombination [10,32,36-38,42].
Chlamydia grows in small intracellular populations and
constantly goes through bottlenecks where a few bacteria
transmit from host to host. This would seem to make the
species highly susceptible to the effect of Muller’s ratchet
[3,80], an evolutionary process by which deleterious
mutations accumulate in asexual populations. Moreover,
in small populations like C. trachomatis, there are high
chances for the occurrence of Hill-Robertson effect
(HRE) [81], which imposes an important limit on the
response to selection on the whole genome of asexuals
by reducing the probability of fixation of beneficial alleles
[82]. However, phylogenetic reconstructions show this
group of organisms has survived for billions of years [83].
All these disruptive evolutionary processes can be limited
by the effect of recombination, which allows beneficial
mutations having evolved separately to come together
[84]. Our results are further evidence that the intracellular niche of the bacterium is obviously not a barrier to
exchange since the LD distance decay profile of C. trachomatis was similar to the free-lining pathogen/commensal E. coli (Figure 5).
One of the major factors that make recombination
more likely to occur between members of clades within a
bacterial species is frequent physical proximity [2]. This
proximity is more likely to occur between members of
the same community, which are likely to be related
because many species of bacteria show significant spatial
[85] and ecological [86] structuring. For C. trachomatis
to recombine regularly there must be frequent mixed
infections with sufficient organisms to allow individual
cells to be invaded. We have very little understanding of
the nature and frequency of infections where C. trachomatis DNA exchange can take place, although we know
that repeat infection occurs at rates as high as 56.9%
[43,87,88] and mixed infections at rates of up to 15%
[67,89,90] and probably higher. Our reconstruction of
inter-clade recombination currents (Figure 4 & Table 5)
indicates that there has historically been a certain level of
sexual isolation between clades 1 and 2 on the one hand
and clades 3 and 4 on the other (although we have
recently discovered clear evidence of very recent gene

conversion from a serovar D to L2 from men having sex
with men (MSM) [43]). These patterns suggest a spatial
structure in C. trachomatis infections, with some strains
associated with a particular tissue or category of host.
Some evidence points in that direction, for example the
G strains have been noted to be more prevalent in rectal
tissues in MSM while E strains are more prevalent in the
cervix among populations in the same geographical
region [91-93]. In such spatially structured environment,
it has been predicted that if beneficial mutations (due to
selection) are high, adaptation proceeds more slowly
mainly because of Hill-Robertson effect [94]. This will
develop negative associations among favored alleles containing those beneficial mutations, which favors an
increased rate in recombination in order to fix those beneficial mutations in the population. In other words, the
adaptive cost of the spatial structuring in C. trachomatis
strains is compensated by recombination, which might
explain the observed currents of recombination flux.

from our current vantage of 12 complete genomes. The
methods applied in the determination of the relative frequency and importance of mutation and recombination
events are proper and have been used to dissect the history of the 92 genes showing evidence of positive
selection. The authors interpret their data as supporting a model of mutation, inter-strain lateral gene transfer and gene conversion via recombination and positive
selection through gene loss of the original gene in the
recipient strain. That genes falling into this class are
enriched in known virulence factors leads them to the
intriguing suggestion that other genes of unknown function with the same patterns of mutational distribution
may have a similar role. The discussion of the interplay
between the forces of genetic degradation in asexual
organisms characterized by bottlenecking and the rescue
of beneficial mutations through recombination provides
the necessary context for understanding the extent to
which these observations can be directly applied to
other lineages.

Conclusions
In this study, we evaluated the contribution of recombination and positive selection in C. trachomatis based on
comparative analysis of 12 completed published genomes. Even though the gene content of the 12 strains
was very similar, phylogenetic reconstruction using the
ClonalFrame software suggested that a steady rate of
recombination has contributed significantly towards the
genetic diversity of C. trachomatis (r/m mean estimate
of 0.71). We observed trends of distance-dependent
decay of linkage disequilibrium in C. trachomatis core
genes, similar to other recombining lineages of bacteria
such as E. coli. We identified seven genes known to be
involved in the virulence and pathogenicity of infection
with a history of both positive selection and invasion of
C. trachomatis lineages through gene conversion. Sixteen other C. trachomatis genes have the same evolutionary dynamics, suggesting they should be targeted for
further studies of molecular pathogenesis. In tracing the
origins of the imports of recombinant fragments we
observed more DNA exchange between clades 1 and 2
and between clades 3 and 4, which could indicate historical spatial population structure in C. trachomatis
infections corroborating with its tissue specific infection
in the host cells, intra-cellular nature of infection as well
as nature (mixed infection) and frequency of infection.
All these factors facilitate the occurrence of recombination and positive selection to adapt to the varying host
and external environments.

Reviewer’s Comments
Referee 1: Dr Jeremy Selengut

This work provides a thorough assessment of evolutionary processes in the Chlamydia trachomatis lineage

We completely agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that
comparative genome analysis as well as in silico methods
we implemented in this study can be effectively used to
understand and dissect the evolutionary forces acting on
other microbial lineages that survived for millions of
years. The impact of genomics and such computational
methods will be peaked for microbial lineages that
invade the host at intracellular level and those that lack
a genetic system to understand more about the evolutionary history of such lineages.

This paper uses several statistical methods to uncover
and characterize recombination events in the history of
C. trachomatis. The authors uncover an impressive
wealth of information from 12 genomes (plus an outgroup). The methods in this paper are sound and well
reasoned. I have no major points.
Minor points

1) Alignments and Phylogenetic Inference, last sentence:
It is not clear what “cf” stands for.
Author’s response

We apologize for this mistake that occurred while editing. This has now been removed from the manuscript.
2) Evolutionary analysis using ClonalFrame, second
paragraph: “Highest normalized BLASTN score.” The
evalue is a probabilistic representation of the normalized
score. It is not clear why the authors chose to use a

Joseph et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:28
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/28

custom normalized score rather than the e-value that
BLASTN already produces.
Author’s response

Both methods for processing the BLAST results arrive at
the same result. We used the normalized score [95] only
because we had used it in previous analyses of Chlamydia genomes [96].
3) Calculation of Linkage Disequilibrium, last sentence: I think it would make the paper stronger if the
authors included the formula for the DA’ metric and an
explanation of DA’.
Author’s response

Page 12 of 16

Author’s response

This mistake is now corrected in the manuscript.
2) Evidence for Positive Selection, last sentence: The
p-value should be “less than or equal to” instead of
“equal to.”
Author’s response

We edited the manuscript accordingly.
3) Italicize pyrG at the end of page 16 because it is a
gene name.
Author’s response

We edited the manuscript accordingly
4) Figure 3: the resolution is poor. It would help the
quality of the paper if the image were saved as a PNG
or SVG instead of a JPG (which is a better format for
photographs).

The formula for estimating D’A metric along with a short
explanation of the method has been added to the manuscript on page 10.
4) The elementary body mentioned on page 15 is
described as a particle. However, for the purposes of
clarity it may help to describe it as a stage in the C. trachomatis lifecycle. There are two major phases in he lifecycle: the noninfectious reticulate body (RB) and the
infectious and intracellular elementary body (EB). It is
confusing when the cell is instead described as a particle.

We made figure 3 as a PNG image with improved resolution and quality.
5) Figure 4. It may help emphasize the authors’ stance
on the one-sided flow of genes between clades if the
arrows were weighted differently according to the number of genes.

The text has been changed to remove the word ‘particle’.
5) Figure 1 legend. It may help the reader if you label
NG as the out-group, even though it is labeled in Table
1.

Author’s response

Thanks for the nice suggestion. We increased the width of
the connecting lines and used different colors to highlight
the clade-specific gene flow we identified in this study.

Author’s response

Referee 3: Dr Arcady Mushegian

Figure 1 is modified and we labeled Ng as the outgroup.
6) Figure 1. It is unclear what the units are on the
scale. Is it amino acid residues?

This is a useful comparative study of many isolates of
Chlamydia trachomatis. I have mostly technical questions and comments:
1) p. 7: “OrthoMCL was run with a BLAST E-value
cut-off of 1e-05.” – was it run against the NR database,
against all species minus the query species, or against
each species separately? The E-value would be different
for the same HSP in these three situations, as it is computed using the database length and is reverse proportional to it (whereas the score S would be the same). If
the searches were done against the small database of a
single proteome, the E-value of e-05 is probably too
restrictive, and the list of “core genes” is longer. As a
quick test of this, were all short ribosomal proteins
(which are sure to be omnipresent in these genomes)
reported among the orthologous genes? What would
change if the E-value was set at e-02 or e-03 - would
the “core gene” list cover closer to the 100% of the
annotated genes in the smallest genome? And would the
properties of these genes be the same or affect the
conclusions?

Author’s response

We generated figure 1 using the TreeView software. In
TreeView the scale bar usually indicates the branch
length. In this study, we used PHYLIP’s CONSENSE
program for inferring the species tree, which instead of
showing branch lengths, shows the bootstrap values in
the nexus tree output file. Because PHYLIP puts these
numbers where TreeView expects the branch lengths,
TreeView will display a scale bar, which in our case is
an error scale bar.
We edited figure 1 and removed the scale bar. We
thank the reviewer for noticing this.
7) Table 1. It may help if the table also includes genome size and/or number of genes per 1 kb so that the
reader has a better grasp of the C. trachomatis genome.
Author’s response

We added the genome size of each of the C. trachomatis
strains into table 1.
Very minor points

1) Background, paragraph 2: “mutations” should be
singular

Author’s response

The blastp was not run against the NR database or
against all the strains minus the query strain or against
each species separately. Instead we performed allagainst-all BLASTP comparison of all the protein

Joseph et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:28
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/28

sequences from the genomes used in this study. We created a blast database using all the protein sequences of
the Chlamydia strains used in this study and performed
blastp against it with the same dataset (all protein
sequences).
2) p. 10: “It has been suggested that the majority of
apparent disparity in gene content might be caused by
differences in the gene predictions rather than being
real differences in the presence or absence of genes” - a
quick way to estimate the possible effect of this is to
look for the homologs of “unique” or sparsely present
genes in the other genomes by searching the nucleotide
sequence with the TBLASTN program. Has this been
attempted, can it also make the list of “core genes”
longer, and would these genes be different in any way
(other than they would perhaps be shorter-than-median
gene length)?
Author’s response

We took all unique or sparsely present gene clusters and
performed TBLASTN analysis against a database containing all the genomes of Chlamydia strains used in
this study. We found that 15 such gene clusters had perfect matches to all of the 12 genomes in the BLAST database, which increases the core genome size from 836 to
851 genes. For this study we used the annotation provided through Genbank but this point illustrates that we
need to consider re-annotating consistently for future
multi-genome comparisons.
3) p. 11: “four-substitution” is a typo, change to “four
substitution”, and the same for “four-recombination"?
Author’s response

We corrected the manuscript accordingly.
4) p. 13: “The 95% credibility interval of r/m was 0.561.01 (mean = 0.71), indicating that unlike mutation
recombination often affects several nucleotides at each
occurrence.” – probably, awkward wording: does not
recombination affect more than one base by definition?
Author’s response

We agree with the reviewer’s comment and corrected the
sentence by replacing the word ‘affects’ with ‘substitutes’.
p. 14: “more inter-clade DNA exchange between
clades 1 and 2 and between clades 3 and 4” – if the
genes involved in these exchanges are excluded from
the concatenated alignment used to build the genome
tree, would the clades remain the same? In other words,
is HGT determining the topology (or at least the statistical support for the partitions) of the tree?
Author’s response

We redid the phylogenetic analysis by excluding the genes
involved in the inter-clade DNA exchange. We noticed
that there were neither rearrangements of the clades nor
any significant changes in the statistical support for the
partitions of the clades in the new species tree.
