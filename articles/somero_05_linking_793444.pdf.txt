Abstract
Temperature-adaptive physiological variation plays important roles in latitudinal biogeographic
patterning and in setting vertical distributions along subtidal-to-intertidal gradients in coastal marine
ecosystems. Comparisons of congeneric marine invertebrates reveal that the most warm-adapted
species may live closer to their thermal tolerance limits and have lower abilities to increase heat
tolerance through acclimation than more cold-adapted species. In crabs and snails, heart function
may be of critical importance in establishing thermal tolerance limits. Temperature-mediated shifts
in gene expression may be critical in thermal acclimation. Transcriptional changes, monitored using
cDNA microarrays, have been shown to differ between steady-state thermal acclimation and
diurnal temperature cycling in a eurythermal teleost fish (Austrofundulus limnaeus). In stenothermal
Antarctic notothenioid fish, losses in capacity for temperature-mediated gene expression, including
the absence of a heat-shock response, may reduce the abilities of these species to acclimate to
increased temperatures. Differences among species in thermal tolerance limits and in the capacities
to adjust these limits may determine how organisms are affected by climate change.

Review
Introduction
Understanding the roles played by physiological adaptation to temperature in governing the distribution patterns
of species has taken on a new urgency because of the
potential effects of global warming on both aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems. There is already compelling evidence for widespread changes in ecosystems due to climate change. Recent meta-analyses have shown that
species' distribution patterns, the structures of ecosystems,
and the timing of annual events (phenology) such as
migration and reproduction have changed markedly during the past century, when average global temperatures
rose by approximately 0.6°C [1-4]. If the consensus view
that average global temperatures will rise by approxi-

mately 3°C during this century is correct [5], then even
more extensive changes in the biosphere are certain to
occur and, in view of this five-fold increase in warming
rate, to occur rapidly. Suffice it to say that analyses that
can assist in predicting – and, perhaps, even in ameliorating – these biological effects are strongly needed at this
time. Because most previous analyses of the biological
effects of climate change have been correlative, rather than
focused on the underlying causal mechanisms behind the
observed effects, there is clearly a need for physiologists to
contribute to this important, on-going discussion.
In this brief review, I discuss studies performed with a taxonomically varied group of aquatic ectotherms that shed
light on several questions related to the roles played by

physiological adaptations in setting species' distribution
patterns. The more clearly we understand the mechanistic
basis of biogeography, the better prepared we will be to
predict the effects of climate change on distribution patterns and ecosystem structure. The questions I address
include the following. First, how do thermal tolerance
limits differ among species adapted to different temperatures? Which species are most likely to be threatened by
increases in habitat temperatures, i.e., which species currently live closest to their thermal tolerance limits? Second, what are the "weak links" in physiological systems
that appear most likely to set thermal tolerance limits?
Can we identify physiological, biochemical, and molecular level effects that account for thermal tolerance ranges?
Third, how do capacities for acclimation to changes in
habitat temperature differ among species? Which species
have the greatest – or the least – ability to acclimate to
increases in temperature? Mechanistically speaking, what
types of acclimatory changes are needed to adapt physiological systems to permit tolerance of new thermal conditions? Fourth, what types of changes in gene expression
are needed to achieve thermal acclimation? How does
gene expression during acclimation to rapid, diurnal
change in temperature differ from the response to slower,
seasonal time-scale change in temperature? How do stenothermal and eurythermal species differ in their capacities
for altering gene expression in temperature-adaptive manners? Have extreme stenotherms like Antarctic animals
that have evolved for many millions of years under highly
stable, cold temperatures lost key abilities to acclimate to
increasing temperatures?
To address these questions, I focus primarily on studies
that our laboratory has performed on aquatic ectothermic
species that have been chosen for study because they
seemed to fit well the August Krogh Principle, which can
be paraphrased as follows: For any question a biologist
asks, Nature can provide a most appropriate study organism. Through study of such "Kroghian" species, it has
been possible to obtain at least initial answers to the several questions raised above.
Thermal tolerance relationships of porcelain crabs (genus
Petrolisthes) and turban snails (genus Tegula)
One of the challenges facing a comparative or evolutionary physiologist wishing to elucidate adaptive differences
among species is the need to separate effects due to phylogeny from true adaptive variation. One means of achieving this end is to study groups of closely related organisms
from widely different habitat conditions, for which a comprehensive phylogeny exists. A group of species that is
especially "Kroghian" from this standpoint are porcelain
crabs (genus Petrolisthes) from the eastern Pacific Ocean
[6]. Congeners of Petrolisthes are abundant (46 species
occur in the eastern Pacific), found over wide ranges of lat-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/1

itude, and occur in subtidal and intertidal habitats.
Among these congeners, body temperatures extend from
slightly below 0°C to over 40°C; for some eurythermal
species, the range of body temperatures across different
seasons can be over 32°C [7-10].
The thermal tolerance limits of field-acclimatized temperate (California and Chile), subtropical (northern Gulf of
California) and tropical (Panama) congeners of
Petrolisthes from different heights along the subtidal to
intertidal gradient are shown in Fig. 1. Data are presented
as LT50 values, the temperatures at which fifty percent of
an experimental population is killed by the heat treatment. Heating rates simulated measured rates of environmental temperature change found in the species' habitats
[10]. The predicted correlation between adaptation temperature and LT50 is found (Fig. 1A): the most heat-tolerant intertidal species, those from subtropical and tropical
habitats, had LT50s that were approximately 15°C higher
than those of temperate sub-tidal species and 6–7°C
higher than temperate intertidal species. However, the
likelihood of heat death facing the different species under
natural habitat conditions is not reflected by the LT50 per
se, but rather the by proximity of this trait to current
extremes of habitat temperature. As shown by the alignment of LT50 values vis à vis the line of unity (LT50 = maximal habitat temperature) in Fig. 1B, warm-adapted
intertidal species are in much greater jeopardy from heat
death than their more cold-adapted subtidal relatives.
Moreover, the abilities of congeners of Petrolisthes to
increase thermal tolerance through acclimation to
increased temperature are less in intertidal species than in
more cold-adapted subtidal congeners [10]. Thus, warmadapted intertidal species face greater current – and, most
likely, future – threats from high temperatures than less
heat-tolerant, subtidal congeners.
One physiological system that is a "weak link" in the thermal tolerance of these species is heart function. As shown
in Fig. 2A, sharp reductions in heart rate occur when a species-specific high temperature is reached. This is termed
the "Arrhenius break temperature" (ABT) to denote that it
is the temperature at which a sharp discontinuity in the
slope of an Arrhenius plot (ln rate of heart beat versus
reciprocal temperature (K)) occurs. Once the ABT is
exceeded, heart function of porcelain crabs does not
recover from heat stress. ABT values for the temperate congeners P. cinctipes (intertidal) and P. eriomerus (subtidal)
are 31.5°C and 26.5°C, respectively. The maximal habitat
temperatures for the two species are approximately 31°C
and 16°C, respectively [9,10]. Thus, whereas the subtidal
congener has an approximately 10°C range between its
highest habitat temperature and the upper thermal limit
of heart function, the intertidal congener's upper habitat
temperature, LT50, and ABT for heart function are

essentially the same, 31–32°C. It bears emphasizing that
ABT values for other physiological processes, for example,
mitochondrial respiration [11,12] and enzymatic activity
[13], may be considerably higher than upper lethal temperatures of the whole organism. For some species of animals, then, heart function appears to be a "weak link" in
the "chain" of physiological processes that govern thermal
tolerance.
The acclimatory plasticity of ABTs of heart function differs
among species in a parallel fashion to acclimatory change
in LT50 (Fig. 2B[8]). In this experiment, 4 congeners were
studied: the two temperate species from California discussed above, P. cinctipes and P. eriomerus, and upper
intertidal and mid-intertidal species from the northern
Gulf of California, P. gracilis and P. hirtipes, respectively.
Acclimation temperatures were 8°C and 18°C for the
temperate species and 15°C and 25°C for the sub-tropical
species. ABT (= CTmax) of P. eriomerus rose by 2.3°C when
acclimation temperature was increased by 10°C, but the
most warm-adapted species, P. gracilis, increased ABT
(CTmax) by only 0.5°C. The eurythermal intertidal species
did exhibit greater capacities than the subtidal species to
acclimate to lower temperatures, however, as shown by

their greater ability to lower the temperature at which
heart beat ceased (CTmin) (Fig. 2B). Despite being eurythermal, the warm-adapted species are again seen to be in
greatest jeopardy from further increases in maximal habitat temperature; their abilities to extend their tolerance of
lower temperatures is not matched by a similar capacity
for increasing tolerance of heat.
The differences in thermal tolerance and capacities for
warm acclimation noted with porcelain crabs were mirrored in studies done with another set of congeneric
marine invertebrates found at different vertical positions
along the subtidal to intertidal gradient, turban snails of
the genus Tegula [14]. Intertidal and subtidal Tegula congeners exhibit significant differences in thermal limits of
protein synthesis and onset temperatures for production
of heat-shock proteins that reflect their vertical distributions [15,16]. In agreement with these data, field-acclimatized populations of three Tegula congeners had
significantly different thermal limits of heart function: the
low- to mid-intertidal congener, T. funebralis, had a higher
ABT of heart function (31.0°C) than two subtidal congeners, T. brunnea and T. montereyi (ABTs of 25.0°C and
24.2°C, respectively) [17]. The ABT of T. funebralis

CTmax is the ABT, and CTmin is the temperature at which heart beat ceased as temperature was lowered. Decreasing temperatures did not cause a sharp break in Arrhenius plots, so ABTs could not be

25°C for the Gulf of California species. The differences in CTmax and CTmin between the two acclimation groups of each species

approximated the highest body temperature recorded for
this species in the field, 32°C [15]. Body temperatures for
the subtidal species only rarely reach 20°C [15], so these
species would seldom, if ever, experience heart failure in
their habitats. Furthermore, in agreement with the studies
of porcelain crabs [8], T. funebralis had a lower ability to
increase ABT during warm acclimation than the subtidal
species [17].
These interspecific differences in thermal tolerance limits
for whole organism survival and maintenance of heart
function provide important lessons concerning biogeographic and vertical patterning and the potential effects of
climate change. First, the differences in thermal tolerance
between subtidal and intertidal species indicate that the
former species would be unable to persist at the upper
habitat temperatures commonly found in the intertidal
zone during daytime low tides in warm seasons. For
example, the temperate subtidal species Petrolisthes eriomerus has an upper lethal temperature approximately
6°C below the upper limit of body temperature recorded
for the intertidal species P. cinctipes. Interspecific variations in LT50 and ABT values also mirror the biogeographic patterning found across latitude. For instance,
north temperate congeners of Petrolisthes would be unable
to survive under the habitat conditions found in the
northern Gulf of California or Panama. The close agreement among LT50, ABT, and maximal habitat temperatures for intertidal species suggests that further increases
in habitat temperature could have strong impacts on the
persistence of these species in their habitats, especially
when the limits of acclimatory ability are reached. Because
the greatest thermal stress occurs during emersion periods
during the warmest time of the day, and because solar
heating is more critical than ambient water temperature,
the precise consequences of global warming are difficult
to predict. Furthermore, because of latitudinal variation in
the timing of tidal cycles, these and other intertidal species
may face greater threats from climate change at mid-latitudes than at lower latitudes [18]. Despite these uncertainties, however, the seemingly paradoxical conclusion
reached above, to the effect that many warm-adapted species are more threatened by increases in habitat temperature than cold-adapted congeners, appears valid and
should be taken as a caveat that predicting the consequences of climate change is a complex challenge.
Acclimatory changes in gene expression: eurytherms
versus stenotherms
The abilities of ectotherms to cope satisfactorily with
increases in habitat temperature are based on several factors, including the proximity of habitat temperatures to
the edges of the thermal tolerance range and the abilities
to shift the tolerance range through acclimatization. In the
case of porcelain crabs and turban snails, acclimatory

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/1

ability was shown to vary among species. This finding that
even closely related congeneric species differ in acclimatory ability raises questions about the mechanistic basis of
phenotypic plasticity and the roles of evolutionary thermal history in establishing this plasticity.
The ability to modify the phenotype in response to a
change in body temperature is certain to depend strongly
on a capacity for modulating gene expression in an adaptive manner. Although comprehensive surveys of temperature-induced shifts in gene expression have not been
done for any marine organisms, studies of model species,
defined here as species for which the genome has been
sequenced and relatively well annotated, are beginning to
reveal the pervasiveness of stress-induced shifts in gene
expression. The studies of Gasch and colleagues [19] on
yeast, for example, have shown that a variety of physical
and chemical stressors, including temperature, hypoxia,
reactive oxygen species and osmotic shock, triggered relatively similar changes in expression of approximately 900
genes, which represents approximately 14% of the yeast
genome. They termed this gene regulatory response the
"environmental stress response (ESR)". Because the
proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that form the structural
foundation of all physiological processes of cells will be
affected in a qualitatively similar manner by changes of
temperature in all organisms [20], it is reasonable to conjecture that an ESR generally similar to that found in yeast
may characterize all species. For instance, induction of
stress-induced chaperones (heat-shock proteins) for
repair of damaged proteins, and shifts in synthesis of the
various enzymes required for modifying the properties of
lipid-based systems are likely to be ubiquitous events in
the thermally induced ESRs of different species [20].
Despite the likely occurrence among species of generally
similar requirements for temperature-adaptive shifts in
gene expression, species that fall into different regions of
the stenotherm to eurytherm spectrum may have distinctly different capacities for acclimatory regulation of
transcription. In the context of effects of climate change,
one of the most important interspecific differences relates
to the ability of extreme stenotherms, which may have
evolved for millions of years under stable thermal conditions, to alter gene expression in the face of temperature
change. The Antarctic notothenioid fishes are a primary
case in point. These species have evolved for 10–14 million years in a thermally stable "ice bath," in which
annual temperature variation is usually less than 1–2°C
[21]. McMurdo Sound populations of notothenioids are
unable to acclimate to temperatures above approximately
4°C [22,23], making these species among the most stenothermal of organisms. Antarctic marine invertebrates, too,
are extreme stenotherms, with heat death occurring at
temperatures only a few degrees above 0°C [24]. In the

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:1

case of the notothenioid fish Trematomus bernacchii, the
lack of capacity to acclimate to elevated temperatures may
stem in part from deficiencies in its ability to alter gene
expression as its body temperature changes. Unlike virtually all other species, T. bernacchii is unable to increase the
synthesis of any class of heat-shock protein following
thermal stress [23]. Lacking this ability, T. bernacchii may
be unable to effect adequate chaperone-mediated restoration of the native structures of heat-denatured proteins. A
build-up of aggregates of denatured proteins is likely to be
cytotoxic and lead to the eventual death of cells [25]. The
absence of a heat-shock response in Antarctic notothenioids, but its presence in temperate New Zealand notothenioids [26], suggests that evolution under cold, stable
thermal conditions has led to a depletion of the genetic
resources of Antarctic fish. The inability of some notothenioid species to synthesize hemoglobins [27] or
myoglobins [28] is another illustration of the depauperate
genome of these cold-adapted stenotherms. Loss of oxygen transport pigments is viewed as a reflection of the lack
of need for these pigments because of the combination of
high oxygen solubility at low temperatures and the generally sluggish locomotory habits of the notothenioids
[27,28]. In general, disappearance of these diverse genetic
capacities in notothenioids is consistent with relaxed
selection against the loss of genes that are no longer
needed under conditions of stable low temperatures.
Although future work on temperature-induced changes in
the transcriptomes of Antarctic stenotherms will be
needed before any broad generalizations can be made
about the contents of their "genetic tool kits," it seems
likely that the stenothermy of these species could be due
in large measure to a loss of the type of acclimatory plasticity that is found in eurytherms. Lacking this phenotypic
plasticity, Antarctic stenotherms seem uniquely vulnerable to the effects of global warming.
Even among eurythermal ectotherms, there may be a variety of capacities for modulating gene expression to compensate for changes in body temperature. Although few
data are currently available to test this point, acclimatory
responses to rapid, diurnal variations in body temperature
may require different shifts in gene expression from those
that characterize slower, e.g., seasonal time-scale,
responses to temperature change. A recent study [29] of
temperature-induced changes in the transcriptome (the
population of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in the
cell) of liver tissue of a eurythermal teleost fish, Austrofundulus limnaeus, revealed wide-scale shifts in gene expression, as noted earlier for yeast [19]. A total of 540 mRNAs
out of 4,992 examined changed by two-fold or more during acclimation. Many of the mRNAs changing in
response to thermal acclimation were for proteins that are
well known to be key elements of acclimatory response.
For example, transcripts for heat-shock proteins and for

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/1

enzymes involved in temperature-compensatory shifts in
membrane lipid composition showed the predicted
changes. However, for both classes of proteins, distinctly
different expression profiles were found under the two
acclimation regimes employed in this study: (i) steadystate acclimation at 20°C or 37°C for up to two weeks,
and (ii) diurnally cycling temperatures that varied from a
high of 37°C near mid-day to 20°C at night, a cycle that
simulates the environmental conditions the species
encounters in its shallow pond habitats in South America
[29]. Under steady-state acclimation, transcripts for heatshock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 showed the largest
amount of change among molecular chaperones. Under
cycling conditions, low-molecular-mass chaperones
showed the greatest change. This finding suggests that
protein damage and the repair costs it entails may differ
under constant versus intermittent heat stress. Although
both acclimation regimes led to changes in transcript
abundance for proteins associated with alterations in lipid
composition, differences between cycling and steady-state
acclimation were noted in the types of lipids that appear
to be produced. For steady-state acclimation, the expected
changes in transcripts for enzymes involved in acyl chain
double bond content (saturation) were observed, consistent with many previous studies of homeoviscous acclimation in membranes [20]. During cycling conditions,
changes in transcripts for proteins involved in cholesterol
biosynthesis and transport were more pronounced than
shifts in mRNAs for enzymes of acyl chain biosynthesis.
Although the significance of this difference in adaptive
response is not known, it seems possible that insertion
into or removal from the membrane of cholesterol could
be achieved more rapidly than changes in the composition of phospholipids. In any event, differences in the
time-frame of thermal stress may lead to differences in the
types of temperature-compensatory strategies used to
modulate the fluidity and phase of membranes.
One of the most striking changes in transcript abundance
observed in the study of Austrofundulus limnaeus was for
the message encoding high mobility group b1 protein
(HMGB1)(Fig. 3). High mobility group proteins are DNAbinding proteins that exert wide-ranging effects on transcriptional activity [30]. Rather than serving as transcriptional regulators for specific genes, HMGB1 proteins are
general activators of transcription that exert their effects
by influencing the transcriptional competence or "openness" of DNA structure. Increases in concentrations of
HMGB1 favor open DNA structures and increased transcriptional activity of many genes. The changes in mRNA
for HMGB1 found during thermal cycling (Fig. 3) and
during steady-state acclimation [29] indicate an extremely
tight control of this message. The increase in content of
HMGB1 message with falling temperature (steady-state or
cycling) is consistent with the role of this protein in

maintaining DNA structure in an open, transcriptionally
competent state. Thus, decreases in temperature will
enhance the stability of the non-covalent bonds that stabilize higher order of DNA structure. To offset this
increased stability of DNA structure, the cell may increase
the concentrations of HMGB1 proteins, thereby allowing
transcriptional activity to be temperature-independent.
This is not to suggest that changes in HMGB1 protein will
lead to genome-wide changes in transcriptional activity,
of course. Rather, by increasing the openness of DNA
structure, the promoter regions of genes will be susceptible to the effects of gene-specific transcription factors
whose influences will lead to temperature-specific alterations in the transcriptome.
The changes in gene expression noted in Austrofundulus
limnaeus and in a recent study of carp [31] represent an
initial view of the complexity of transcriptional changes
that ectothermic animals may experience during thermal
acclimation, either to short-term or long-term changes in
body temperature. Different changes to the transcriptome
may be involved in different time courses of acclimation.
It will be important to establish whether extreme stenotherms like Antarctic fish are capable of adjusting their
transcriptomes in temperature-adaptive manners, when
body temperature is increased. The importance of maintaining DNA structure in an open configuration that
allows transcription factors to effectively modulate gene
expression is a phenomenon that merits additional study.
This capacity may be of pivotal significance in
determining the effectiveness with which ectotherms can

respond to changes in temperature; it may be foundational for most, if not all, of the temperature acclimation
response. How this capacity differs between eurytherms
and stenotherms may determine how these two groups
cope with thermal fluctuations in their present habitats
and what their potentials for coping with climate change
are likely to be.

Conclusions
Ectothermic species differ widely in thermal tolerance
limits and in their abilities to adjust these limits in temperature-adaptive manners. Comparisons of congeneric
species from different latitudes and different positions
along the subtidal to intertidal gradient have provided
important insights into adaptive variation and the threats
posed by increased habitat temperature. In what at first
view may seem paradoxical, warm-adapted congeners
may be more threatened by increased temperatures than
their cold-adapted subtidal relatives. This difference stems
from two factors: the proximity of current habitat temperatures to upper lethal temperatures (LT50s) and the more
limited abilities to acclimate to increases in temperature
noted for intertidal species. The physiological determinants of upper thermal limits are certain to be
multifarious, but heart function stands out as a key contributor to these limits. In porcelain crabs and turban
snails, upper lethal temperatures coincide closely with
temperatures of heart failure. Such cardiac effects also
could contribute to a shift from aerobic to anaerobic processes of ATP generation, which has been proposed as one
important mechanism of death from high and low tem-

peratures [32,33]. Acclimatory response to change in body
temperature is likely to be an important determinant of
the effects of global warming on species. Temperatureadaptive shifts in gene expression serve as a foundation
for physiological acclimation. Changes in the transcriptome differ between long-term, steady-state acclimation
and responses to diurnally cycling temperatures. The ability to modulate gene expression requires an openness of
DNA structure, which appears to be closely regulated during steady-state and cycling thermal regimes. Being able to
modulate the transcriptional competence of DNA in the
face of changing temperature, to ensure that necessary
shifts in gene expression can occur, may be a fundamental
requirement for thermal acclimation. Species such as Antarctic notothenioid fishes that have had a long evolutionary history at constant temperatures may have lost many
of the critical gene regulatory responses needed for thermal acclimation and, as a consequence, they may be
uniquely vulnerable to global warming.
