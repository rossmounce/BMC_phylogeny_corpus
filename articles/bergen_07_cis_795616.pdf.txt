Abstract
Background: Sequence and transcriptional variability within and between individuals are typically
studied independently. The joint analysis of sequence and gene expression variation (genetical
genomics) provides insight into the role of linked sequence variation in the regulation of gene
expression. We investigated the role of sequence variation in cis on gene expression (cis sequence
effects) in a group of genes commonly studied in cancer research in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We
estimated the proportion of genes exhibiting cis sequence effects and the proportion of gene
expression variation explained by cis sequence effects using three different analytical approaches,
and compared our results to the literature.
Results: We generated gene expression profiling data at N = 697 candidate genes from N = 30
lymphoblastoid cell lines for this study and used available candidate gene resequencing data at N =
552 candidate genes to identify N = 30 candidate genes with sufficient variance in both datasets for
the investigation of cis sequence effects. We used two additive models and the haplotype phylogeny
scanning approach of Templeton (Tree Scanning) to evaluate association between individual SNPs,
all SNPs at a gene, and diplotypes, with log-transformed gene expression. SNPs and diplotypes at
eight candidate genes exhibited statistically significant (p < 0.05) association with gene expression.
Using the literature as a "gold standard" to compare 14 genes with data from both this study and
the literature, we observed 80% and 85% concordance for genes exhibiting and not exhibiting
significant cis sequence effects in our study, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on analysis of our results and the extant literature, one in four genes exhibits
significant cis sequence effects, and for these genes, about 30% of gene expression variation is
accounted for by cis sequence variation. Despite diverse experimental approaches, the presence or
absence of significant cis sequence effects is largely supported by previously published studies.

Background
Among heritable factors that influence phenotypic expression are sequence polymorphisms in genic regions that
affect gene expression rather than protein structure [1,2].
The influence of sequence variation linked to the gene
sequence on the regulation of gene expression (cis
sequence effects) has been studied experimentally in H.
sapiens at single genes for decades [3], and, more recently,
in various multi-gene approaches in S. cerevisiae [4-6], S.
purpuratus [7,8], D. melanogaster and D. simulans [9,10],
M. musculus [11,12], Z. mays [12], and H. sapiens [12-24].
In studies with human tissues, these efforts have characterized cis sequence effects on gene expression as common
and heritable [13] and have used both unrelated and
related individuals to quantify such cis sequence effects
[15,18]. Array-based genotyping and gene expression platforms [24-27] have been essential for multi-gene
approaches, and to generate data enabling investigation
of the potential effect of sequence variation not linked to
the gene on gene expression (trans sequence effects).
We used previously generated genomic resequencing data
and, for this study, quantified in vitro transcript levels
from thirty unrelated individuals at several hundred candidate genes commonly studied in cancer research. We
identified a subset of candidate genes with abundant
sequence and gene expression variation. We evaluated
potential cis sequence effects using individual single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all SNPs at a candidate gene considered jointly and haplotype phylogenies
and diplotypes. We compared our findings to the published cis sequence effects literature and to the existing
gene expression regulation literature available for those
candidate genes that exhibited cis sequence effects.

Results
Gene expression data quality
Thirty lymphoblastoid cell lines drawn from the
SNP500Cancer resource were cultured in triplicate and
total RNA extracted [see Additional file 1]. Gene expression profiling was performed on the N = 90 samples using
a custom Illumina Sentrix® Array Matrix-96 microarrays
containing 50 mer probes targeting 697 genes relevant to
cancer research [see Additional file 2]. Gene expression
data from one array were excluded from further analysis
due to a within individual cell line linear r2 correlation for
all genes of <95%, while all remaining within individual
cell line correlations were ~99%. This correlation statistic
reflects variation at all levels of the experiment: cell culture, RNA extraction, RNA labeling, and array performance. Based on these high quality data, further analysis
used normalized mean gene expression signal data from
the three replicate arrays.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/296

Selection of genes for analysis of potential cis effects
We used two threshold criteria to select genes from the N
= 697 genes for further analysis: a signal amplitude of
≥100 normalized units (38% of the genes); and a between
cell line coefficient of variation (CVIC) of ≥20% (32% of
the genes). These criteria identified N = 95 genes with sufficient, and sufficiently variable, gene expression for further analysis. We used the criterion of ≥2 SNPs per
candidate gene in the N = 30 DNAs to identify N = 522
candidate genes with sufficient sequence variation for
analysis. We then compared the N = 95 genes with sufficient gene expression variance and N = 522 genes with
sequence variation derived from the SNP500Cancer resequencing program, a component of the Cancer Genome
Anatomy Project of the National Cancer Institute [28,29]
and identified a subset of N = 32 genes (4.6% of the total
sample) for the analysis of potential cis sequence effects
(Table 1).
Gene expression of selected genes
The mean (standard deviation) rank-invariant normalized gene expression signal of the subset of N = 32 genes
was 580 (175) units (Table 1), the mean (standard deviation) intra cell line replicate culture correlation coefficient
was 0.78 (0.11), and the mean (standard deviation)
between cell line coefficient of variation (CVIC) was 0.33
(0.15). Mean noise (3 standard deviations of 20 negative
control probes built into the array) was 20 units +/- 4
units. PCNA had the largest mean gene expression, TP73L
had the smallest gene expression and the largest CV, and
PTEN had the smallest CV.
Selection of SNPs at genes for association analysis
The number (mean, standard deviation) of polymorphic
SNPs per gene ranged from 2 to 50 (9.9, 10.6) and the
number of tag (minor allele frequency minimum of >5%
and with an r2 threshold ≥ 0.80) and singleton SNPs per
gene ranged from 0 to 15 (4.3, 3.7) in the group of N = 32
genes selected for association analysis (Table 2). Two
genes (EGR1 and GADD45A) were excluded from further
analysis as there were no SNPs at these genes with minor
allele frequencies >5%. Two SNPs with genotype completion (attempted/completed) rates of 63% and 77% were
excluded. After these exclusions, there were N = 126 tag
and singleton SNPs at 30 genes available for analysis with
a mean (standard deviation) genotype completion rate of
98.3% (1.1%) [see Additional file 3]. The distribution of
SNP genotypes in the N = 30 cell lines was evaluated for
Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium using asymptotic and exact
tests; there were no SNPs exhibiting exact test P values <
0.01, and two exhibiting exact test P values < 0.05, both
were at TP73L. The distribution of the flanking, untranslated region, coding and intronic SNPs was 27%, 15%,
12% and 46%, respectively. Four genes (IRF1, MSH2,
MYC, OAS1) had only one informative tag or singleton

SNP and were excluded from haplotype-based analyses,
leaving N = 26 genes with a range of 2 to 14 tag and singleton SNPs for haplotype based analyses. The gene with
the largest number of tag and singleton SNPs (CYP1B1, N
= 14 tag and singleton SNPs) generated too many terms
for the implementation of the SAM model to compute.
The remaining N = 25 genes, comprised of N = 108 tag
and singleton SNPs (range 2–10 SNPs/gene), have results
from all SNP and haplotype based methods. The number
of SNPs before and after selection of tag and singleton
SNPs were uncorrelated (Spearman's rho) with mean normalized signal, the standard deviation, intra cell line correlation coefficient, or inter cell line coefficient (data not
shown).
Significant cis sequence effects identified via three
association methods
N = 10 individual SNPs at six genes were significantly
associated with gene expression signal, three genes exhibited significant association to gene expression in the single
additive model, and three genes exhibited one or more
statistically significant haplotype partitions (Table 3, Figure 1, Additional file 3). The distribution of flanking,
untranslated region, coding and intronic SNPs significantly associated to gene expression (30%, 10%, 10% and

50%, respectively) was not significantly different from the
distribution of SNPs not exhibiting association to gene
expression (Fisher exact test, data not shown). Three (BIC,
FCGR2B and NBS1) of the six genes identified using individual SNPs were identified by one or both of the two
gene-based association methods. Three genes (BIC,
MYBL2, and PCNA) exhibit significant association in one
or two methods and only a trend towards statistical significance in another method.
SNPs in hybridization probes
We evaluated whether the 50 base pair oligonucleotide
probe sequences for the eight genes that exhibited significant cis sequence effects exhibit sequence variation in the
N = 30 individuals in this study [see Additional file 1].
There were two probes on the array for each gene, and all
but two of the sequences (MYBL2 probe IDs = 2099,
3155) have been sequenced in the SNP500Cancer DNAs.
Two of the sixteen probe sequences exhibit variation in
dbSNP (probe ID = 2168 at CYP1B1 and probe ID = 3562
at PCNA), however neither exhibits variation in the N =
30 DNA samples investigated here.

*There was one SNP with maf > 5% at these two genes; tag SNP analysis was not performed. The single SNP with maf > 5% at each gene was used for SNP-based analyses.

Literature data on cis sequence effects at candidate genes
in this study
We reviewed the multi-gene cis sequence effects literature
that has investigated either allelic imbalance within individuals (AI), generally defined as expression ratios ≥1.5 or
≤0.67 at transcribed heterozygous SNPs, or SNP-wise linkage or association in related or unrelated samples of individuals, to gene expression [12-24]. We compared results
at the N = 14 genes studied in common by this study and
at least one additional multi-gene cis sequence effects
study [18,20-22,24] (Supplementary File 4). To avoid
issues of publication bias, we did not compare our results
to the single gene cis sequence effects literature.

Discussion
The proportion of genes exhibiting cis sequence effects
We identified nineteen publications that have investigated cis sequence effects in a multi-gene approach, one of
which summarizes results from six other publications [1224]. These thirteen publications report results at an average of 457 genes (median of 247, range of 13 to 2,726
genes, standard deviation of 724). The weighted average
proportion of genes tested in these thirteen multi-gene
studies considered by their authors to exhibit allelic

imbalance or statistically significant cis sequence effects is
26.2% (unweighted average is 25.7%). We observe statistically significant cis sequence effects at eight of thirty
genes (26.7%) in our study, which is similar to that
observed in the literature.
The proportion of gene expression attributable to cis
sequence effects
The literature presents a variety of linkage and association
techniques to estimate the proportion of gene expression
variation accounted for by individual SNPs [15,17,18,22],
expressed either as an allelic ratio [15,18] or as a proportion of variance explained [17,22]. Mean r2 estimates from
N = 14 [17] and N = 62 [22] genes exhibiting significant
cis sequence effects are 35% and 27%, respectively. The
average proportion (standard deviation) of gene expression variance explained by individually significant SNPs
in the SNP-wise regression analysis [see Additional file 3]
in this study was 21% (7%). The average proportion of
gene expression variance (standard deviation) explained
by the most significant haplotype partitions at FCGR2B,
LMO2 and PCNA was 26% (7%). Thus, current technical
approaches suggest that approximately one-quarter to

one-third of gene expression variation is attributable to cis
sequence effects.
Concordance of the multi-gene cis sequence effects
literature and this study
Pant et al., 2006 [Pant et al., 2006] examined eight genes
for cis sequence effects in common with our study, the
largest overlap in the extant literature [see Additional file
4]. Both studies observed significant cis sequence effects at
CYP1B1, FCGR2B and MYBL2. Pant et al., observed AI at
TYMS where we did not, while we observed cis sequence
effects at LMO2 and NBS1, where Pant et al. did not. Neither study observed cis sequence effects at JAK1 and MYC.
In toto, among the 14 genes jointly analyzed in this study
and in the literature, and after excluding two genes with
discordant literature results, 4 of 5 genes concordantly
exhibit, and 6 of 7 genes concordantly do not exhibit, significant cis sequence effects, respectively. Concordance
with results obtained using other experimental methods,
as we have observed here, increases confidence in our
results. Such evidence may provide the justification to
proceed to more focused functional investigation of gene
regulation.

The utility of different statistical methods used to evaluate
cis sequence effects
We used three methods to test for the significance of cis
sequence effects, after restricting the number of SNPs to
tag and singleton SNPs at each gene. Regression of individual SNPs identified the largest number of genes exhibiting significant cis sequence effects and is the most
commonly used method in the literature, after assessment
of AI. Mander's single additive method (SAM) [30,31] and
Templeton's Tree Scanning method [32,33] identified
three genes; one gene, FCGR2B, was identified in common. The latter two methods incorporate correction for
multiple tests in their estimates of the significance of association. Rather than apply any formal correction(s) for the
multiple comparisons at a gene after regression analysis
on SNPs, or after using multiple methods, we compare
and contrast the results obtained from using the three
methods. Differences between results obtained analyzing
individual SNPs and the two methods that apply multiple
test correction at the level of the gene suggests that much
of the evidence for significant cis sequence effects in this
sample of N = 30 LCLs is too weak to survive multiple test
correction, emphasizing the necessity to apply multiple

heterotic effects for haplotypes at PCNA, suggesting that

Haplotype phylogenies and significant haplotype partitions at FCGR2B, PCNA and LMO2. Haplotype phylogenies are represented together with the SNP allele
configuration and the count of haplotypes in the sample. Statistically significant haplotype partitions in the phylogeny are
indicated by a vertical or horizontal bar, while an arrow indicates a SNP that exhibits significant association via regression
analysis. The haplotypes at FCGR2B, LMO2 and PCNA were
constructed using the following SNPs: rs12145988,
rs17412751, rs922087, rs2298020, rs1674761, rs844;

sequence effects with Tree Scanning, but not with the
additive methods. At LMO2, the minor alleles of four
SNPs define a haplotype partition that exhibits significantly reduced gene expression, and at PCNA, the heterozygote diplotype exhibits significantly increased gene
expression [see Additional file 4]. These latter findings
depend upon the ability to model the effects of haplo-

Biological relevance of cis sequence effects – FCGR2B as
an example
The focus of this study is to evaluate association between
variation in DNA sequence and in vitro RNA transcription
in a group of candidate genes commonly studied in cancer
research. We briefly review some of the recent functional
genomics literature for the candidate gene FCGR2B [see
Additional file 5] and suggest below how a review of relevant genomic data and our cis sequence effects findings at
FCGR2B might inform our understanding of this literature, as an example of how our findings might influence
future FCGR2B SNP association or functional analyses.
The SNP500Cancer program resequenced portions of
IVS1, Exon 2, IVS2, IVS6 and Exon 8 of FCGR2B, yielding
N = 9 FCGR2B SNPs available with a minor allele frequency of ≥5% for analysis of gene expression variation.
After selecting one tag and five singleton SNPs to reduce
the number of statistical tests performed with minimal
loss of information [34], significant cis sequence effects
were observed at FCGR2B SNP rs17412751 (IVS1-91C>T)
(Table 3 and Additional file 4). The minor allele frequency of rs17412751 in our sample of N = 30 was 10%,
similar to the minor allele frequencies of FCGR2B promoter and transmembrane SNPs previously studied, however, it should be noted that rs17412751 is a singleton
SNP, i.e., not strongly associated with the other SNPs
available at FCGR2B. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) within
the FCGR2B genomic region in Caucasian samples
extends from the 3' end of IVS 1 distally in a punctate fashion, and there is some evidence for a separate 5' region of
LD proximal to Exon 1 (data not shown). rs17412751 has
been genotyped by Hinds et al., 2005 as afd1120510 [35]
with a minor allele frequency of 11%, and within their
sample of N = 24 European American DNAs, this SNP
exhibits strong LD with one additional SNP (rs17404379,
afd1120529). However, both of these SNPs map to both
intronic regions within the FCGR2B locus and also within
the FCGR3B/FCGR3A intergenic region some 70 kbp
proximal, suggesting that high sequence homology may
be interfering with accurate map assignment. There are
two recent reports of copy number variation (CNV) in the
region that are relevant: CNV of the FCGR3B locus is associated with nephritis in a rat model and in human patients
[36], and analysis of SNP genotypes and genomic hybridization with the HapMap sample has identified a 256 Kbp
region as human copy number locus CNV_ID_62 containing the FCGR2A, HSPA6, FCGR3A, FCGR2B and
FCRLM1 loci [37].

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:296

Our data at FCGR2B is concordant with data generated
from both in vitro and ex vivo experimental strategies that
sequence variation in the promoter [38,39] and the coding region [24] is associated with gene expression differences. Further, our data contributes to the evidence that a
minor allele frequency of ~10% characterizes the SNPs
that are associated with FCGR2B gene expression differences. The inconsistent directionality of effect of the
minor allele may be due to high sequence homology at
the CNV_ID_62 locus affecting the physical and linkage
disequilibrium mapping of the region, or may be due to
incomplete linkage disequilibrium between the analyzed
SNP and a unanalyzed SNP that may be causing the effect.
Individuals wishing to investigate regulation of gene
expression at FCGR2B in the future should include
approaches necessary to characterize the physical, linkage
disequilibrium, transcriptional and copy number architecture of the region.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include: high quality gene expression data from triplicate cell cultures for each lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), with standardization of culture, RNA
extraction, labeling, amplification and hybridization conditions; the use of sequence-verified SNPs and the resequencing of nearly all expression array probe sequence
regions; the use of multiple methods to evaluate evidence
for significant cis sequence effects; and comparison of the
results observed in this study to the published cis
sequence effects literature at both the gene and SNP levels.

Limitations of this study include: the use of Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed LCLs; the modest number of LCLs used;
the association paradigm; and the absence of genetic
assays that evaluate copy number in our sample. Limitations of LCLs as reagents for the investigation of gene
expression regulation include gene expression in a virally
transformed surrogate ex vivo tissue, which may influence
and potentially eliminate Epstein-Barr virus infection
associated genes from gene expression investigation
[40,41]. Systematic comparison of gene expression from
LCLs and non-surrogate, minimally processed tissues,
e.g., peripheral blood lymphocytes, could be an approach
towards validation of gene expression findings made in
LCLs [40]. The modest number of cell lines used in this
study limits statistical power, and is less than the number
of cell lines used by some researchers [20-22], however,
the number of genes evaluated was also modest. The association paradigm suffers from well known limitations
[42]. Some publications testing large number of genes for
cis sequence effects do not provide complete lists of genes
tested or of genes exhibiting significant cis sequence
effects on gene expression, therefore, we could not identify all genes studied in these reports. Also, due to the variety of approaches used in the literature, most comparisons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/296

are between categorical results of specific assays, i.e., it is
generally not possible to compare quantitative data from
different studies. The MYBL2 probe sequence regions were
not resequenced in the N = 30 Caucasian DNA samples
and thus the positive regression and TreeScan results at
MYBL2 could potentially be a false positive result due to
an unidentified SNP within the sequence complementary
to these probes.

Conclusion
We tested for significant association between gene
sequence variation and gene expression variation at N =
30 candidate genes in DNA and RNA from N = 30 LCLs.
Significant association between cis sequence and gene
expression variation was observed in 8 out of 30 genes,
and accounted for 26% of gene expression variation in
three genes evaluated using an analysis of variance
approach. We utilized additive and analysis of variance
(guided by haplotype phylogeny) analytical approaches,
and suggest that approaches that permit modeling of
allelic effects may identify effects missed by additive models, although larger multi-gene studies would clarify the
relative utility of the two approaches. We reviewed the
multi-gene cis sequence effects literature and found data
on N = 14 of the candidate genes that we evaluated; most
of that data is concordant with our results. Investigators
using current technologies should expect to find cis
sequence effects at about one quarter of candidate genes
evaluated: these effects will explain about one quarter of
gene expression variance. SNPs associated with gene
expression can be preferentially selected for genotyping
and analysis in genetic association studies, or nominated
for functional genomic investigations to characterize their
role in the regulation of gene expression.

Methods
Preparation of total RNA
For this study, we cultured N = 30 Coriell Cell Repository
LCLs [see Additional file 1], in triplicate under standardized conditions; when cells per milliliter exceeded 2 × 107,
the cells were harvested, the pellets were washed once
with PBS and frozen at -80°C. Same-lot cell culture reagents were used, with three technicians each dedicated to
culturing N = 10 of these cell lines, with replicate cell cultures cultured in series. Total RNA was prepared from frozen cell pellets using the Qiagen RNeasy Midi-kit
(Valencia, CA). Ten cell culture pellets were extracted at a
time by a single technician with a single assistant; cell pellets were removed one-at-a-time from the -80°C freezer,
quick thawed by rubbing between gloved hands, and Qiagen denaturant immediately added. Ethanol was added to
each sample, vortexed, and the samples applied to Qiagen
Midi columns, washed as specified, treated with RNasefree DNase "on-column", followed by additional washes
before elution of the RNA with the provided buffer. After

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:296

elution, sample volume was determined by weight,
sodium acetate was added to 0.3 M, the sample was split
and ethanol added at 3× volume to each aliquot and
stored at -20°C.
Gene expression
We performed gene expression experiments RNA from the
N = 90 cell cultures using custom Illumina Sentrix® Array
Matrix-96 microarrays containing 50 mer probes targeting
697 genes relevant to cancer research [see Additional file
2]. Candidate gene content for the custom array was
developed by a voting scheme based on other "cancer
gene" lists available on the World Wide Web on November 6, 2003. Eleven lists were assembled from a variety of
academic, industrial and government sources and a list of
all genes present on all lists was assembled with the genes
ranked according to frequency of occurrence. Any gene
appearing ≥ four lists was included in the array design [see
Additional file 2]. We designed the custom microarray
using transcript sequences from NCBI RefSeq build 34.3.
Sequences overlapping SNPs as defined in dbSNP build
121 and SNP500Cancer were avoided. RNA samples were
amplified and labeled by the method of Eberwine [43],
using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin,
TX). Specific conditions of labeling, as well as array
hybridization, washing and staining, and data extraction
and processing were performed as described in Kuhn et
al., 2004 [26], as were array processing and data extraction
and processing. Array hybridization intensity signals were
adjusted using a global background subtraction and rankinvariant normalization algorithm. All gene expression
data generated for this experiment has been deposited in
the Gene Expression Omnibus with Series accession ID =
GSE8394.

Association analysis with gene expression
We managed gene expression and SNP and haplotype
data and performed descriptive analysis in STATA 9.0
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). We evaluated normality of gene expression using the Shapiro-Wilk test, logtransformed gene expression and used log-transformed
values in each analysis method. The coefficient of variation between cell lines (CVIC) was calculated as follows
CVIC = (SDIC/μ)*100, where SDIC is the standard deviation
between cell lines estimated from a one-way analysis-ofvariance model, and μ is the mean expression of the gene.
The first analysis used linear regression, modeling gene
expression as a function of each SNP separately, using an
additive model to test for a trend across genotypes. The
second analysis included all SNPs in a gene simultaneously and compared that model to a model without any
predictors by means of a likelihood ratio test [30,31].
Third, we partitioned a haplotype phylogeny of each candidate gene to construct partition diplotypes and performed one-way ANOVA analyses of the quantitative gene
expression trait associated with these partition genotypes
to search for partitions that explain a statistically significant proportion of gene expression variation [32], using
the software TreeScan [33]. We report the proportion of
the gene expression variance explained by the partition
diplotypes and the P value from the F statistic after correction by permutation and enforcement of monotonicity.
While TreeScan performs a second round of testing for significant partitions conditional on partitions identified in
the first round of analysis, no additional significant partitions were identified upon conditional analysis in this
dataset. In this study, all P values are two-sided and must
be <0.05 to be considered significant.

SNP, haplotypes and haplotype phylogeny
We utilized sequence verified SNP data from N = 30 individuals from the Caucasian subsample of the
SNP500Cancer database [28,29], which currently contains sequence data from >750 genes that have been partially resequenced in a sample of N = 102 DNAs. We
selected SNPs as either tag SNPs or singleton SNPs using a
minor allele frequency minimum of >5% and with an r2
threshold ≥ 0.80. We reconstructed haplotypes using
PHASE [44] using the tag and singleton SNPs with the following parameters: number of iterations = 10,000; thinning interval = 1; burn-in = 10,000. We performed
haplotype phylogeny reconstruction using neighbor-joining with a uniform model of genetic distance in MEGA
version 3.1 [45]. We searched for SNPs in genomic
sequence complementary to probe sequence using
Genewindow [46], using data from NCBI genome build
35.1, dbSNP build 125, and the SNP500Cancer resequencing program.
