Abstract
Background: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is known of having caused numerous outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth
disease, and other clinical manifestations globally. In 2008, 989 EV-71 strains were isolated in Taiwan.
Results: In this study, the genetic and antigenic properties of these strains were analyzed and the genetic diversity
of EV-71 subgenogroups surfacing in Taiwan was depicted, which includes 3 previously reported subgenogroups
of C5, B5, and C4, and one C2-like subgenogroup. Based on the phylogenetic analyses using their complete
genome nucleotide sequences and neutralization tests, the C2-like subgenogroup forms a genetically distinct
cluster from other subgenogroups, and the antisera show a maximum of 128-fold decrease of neutralization titer
against this subgenogroup. In addition, the subgenogroup C4 isolates of 2008 were found quite similar genetically
to the Chinese strains that caused outbreaks in recent years and thus they should be carefully watched.
Conclusions: Other than to be the first report describing the existence of C2-like subgenogroup of EV-71 in
Taiwan, this article also foresees a potential of subgenogroup C4 outbreaks in Taiwan in the near future.

Background
Belonging to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is one of the
most causative pathogens infecting humans and may
cause outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD),
herpangina, and severe neurological symptoms, especially in young children [1]. There are over one hundred
serotypes identified in the genus Enterovirus [2], which
was originally classified into polioviruses, coxsackievirus
A, coxsackievirus B, and echoviruses on the basis of differences in cell tropism, infectivity, antigenicity, and
pathogenicity [1]. In recent years, the genus Enterovirus
was re-classified into ten species, Human enterovirus A,
Human enterovirus B, Human enterovirus C, Human
enterovirus D, Simian enterovirus A, Bovine enterovirus,
Porcine enterovirus B, Human rhinovirus A, Human
rhinovirus B, and Human rhinovirus C based on the
molecular characteristics. Former Coxsackievirus A2

EV-76, EV-89, EV-90, EV-91, EV-92, Simian enteroviruses SV19, SV43, SV46, and A13 are now members
of Human enterovirus A [3-5].
The positive-stranded RNA genome of EV-71 possesses approximately 7,500 nucleotides and includes
three genomic regions designated P1, P2, and P3. P1
region encodes four structural capsid proteins (VP4,
VP2, VP3, and VP1), while P2 and P3 encodes seven
nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D).
The nonstructural proteins are involved in polyprotein
processing, and the capsid proteins, especially VP1, contain many neutralization antigenic sites and correspond
to the virus serotyping [6]. In previous studies, the
N-terminal portion of the VP1 capsid protein (composed
of 297 amino acids) was likely to contain a major antigenic region and had important neutralizing antibody
determinants [7,8]. But in another study, two synthetic
peptides containing the C-terminal part of the VP1 protein (amino acid 163-177 and 208-222) were capable of
eliciting neutralizing antibodies against EV-71 [9]. In
addition, three regions on the VP1 protein (amino acid
66-77, 145-159, and 247-261) were identified to be capable of inducing human EV-71-specific CD4 + T-cell

proliferation [10]. However, the accurate locations of
neutralizing epitopes are still uncertain. Recombination
found in the same serotype (intratypic) or in the different
serotype (intertypic) and point mutation events result in
the evolution of EV. Multiple strains circulating at the
same area may increase the possibility of recombination,
and many recombinants have been observed in EV
[11-13].
EV-71 is genetically divided into three genogroups, A,
B, and C, on the basis of the VP1 sequences analyses
[14]. Genogroups B and C are each further divided into
five subgenogroups, designated as B1-B5 and C1-C5,
while genogroup A contains only one strain, the prototype strain BrCr [15,16]. In addition, some uncommon
subgenogroups were also identified. For instance, isolates of subgenogroups B0 were first observed in The
Netherlands in 1963 [17], and those of subgenogroup
C0 were observed in Japan in 1978 [18,19]. One Indian
isolate in 2001 was genetically distinct from all other
EV-71 strains and designated as genotype D [20].
Since EV-71 was first isolated in California in 1969,
many EV-71 outbreaks have been reported worldwide,
for instance, several outbreaks took place in the USA,
Japan, and other countries in the 1970s (subgenogroup
B1), in Hong Kong, Australia, and the USA in the 1980s
(subgenogroups B1, B2, and C1), and especially in the
Asian Pacific region in recent years [21,22]. Subgenogroup B3 was described in Sarawak, Singapore, and
Australia in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively, while
subgenogroup C4 was identified on Mainland China in
1998. After that, EV-71 epidemics of subgenogroup B4
were reported in Singapore, Sarawak, and Sydney, and
those of subgenogroup C3 were described in Korea in
2000 [15]. Subgenogroup B5 was identified in Sarawak,
Japan, and Singapore in the last decade and subgenogroup C5 in southern Vietnam in 2005 [16]. Since
one subgenogroup could be found from different countries in the same or different period, to predict the epidemiological pattern of EV-71 infections is not easy. For
example, subgenogroup C1 was first described in the
United States in 1986 [14], but caused several outbreaks
in Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom and other
countries [23-25]. On the other hand, one subgenogroup
could be identified in the same area during a long period; for instance, subgenogroup C4 showed up repeated
on Mainland China from 1998 to 2008 [26].
In Taiwan, a large outbreak was reported in 1998, followed by two lesser outbreaks in 2000 and 2001, and
one more in 2008 [27-29]. Based on a study covering
8-years, the incidence of mild cases of HFMD/herpangina
was reported as 0.8 to 19.9 cases per sentinel physician
per week. The seasonal incidence varied, but usually
peaked in the summer [30]. Over the past several years,
co-circulation patterns of various genetic subgenogroups

Page 2 of 11

were frequently observed in Taiwan. Back in 1998 for
instance, the subgenogroup C2 was found to be the
major one with subgenogroups B4 and C4 as two minors.
Afterwards, the subgenogroup B4 was singled out as the
major cause of the outbreaks with C4 as a minor in 2002,
and then subgenogroup B5 became the major one with a
minor C5 from 2006 to 2008 [21,31]. In such a situation,
it is expected that the possibility of recombination
between various subgenogroups of EV-71 increases.
Therefore, we persistently analyzed all EV-71 isolates collected by our surveillance system, and tried to find out if
any isolates were genetically distinct from those EV-71
strains isolated from earlier outbreaks by phylogenetic
analyses and neutralization tests.

Results
Epidemiological results

According to our laboratory surveillance data, EV-71
viruses of various subgenogroups were isolated from 989
patients in Taiwan in 2008. They were 413 females, 564
males, and 12 with gender not specified, and no significant
differences were observed in gender distribution (p > 0.05).
Among these patients with age ranging from 1 week to 38
years old, most (810/989, 81.9%) were under 5, including
342 girls, 460 boys and 8 with missing data of gender. EV71 infections were reported throughout the year with a
peak in the summer, roughly between May and July.
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) result

Four subgenotypes of EV-71, including 980 subgenogroup B5 isolates, 6 subgenogroup C4 isolates, 1 subgenogroup C5 isolate, and 2 subgenogroup C2-like
isolates, were identified according to the BLAST results
of partial VP1 region nucleotide sequences (Figure 1).
All isolates showed extremely high identities with their
respective reference strains (>97%), except the two C2like isolates (<93%). The genotyping of the subgenogroup C2-like isolates were thus further confirmed by
phylogenetic analysis. These two isolates, 2008-07776
and 2008-00643, were collected in Taipei County in
May and August, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis

After the BLAST process, four subgenogroup B5 and
four subgenogroup C4 isolates randomly chosen, along
with the only one subgenogroup C5, and two subgenogroup C2-like isolates, were used in a phylogenetic
analysis on partial VP1 gene nucleotide sequence (Figure 2).
The B5 and C5 isolates turned out to be genetically
similar to the Taiwan strains isolated in 2007, while the
C4 isolates tested were close to those China strains isolated in 2008-2009. Besides, the C2-like isolates were
located in genogroup C, but not within any known
subgenogroup.

Figure 1 Different subgenogroups of 989 enterovirus 71 (EV-71)
isolates in Taiwan in 2008 according to the BLAST results. The
subgenogroup was determined by BLAST analysis of partial VP1
region nucleotide sequences. There were 980 subgenogroup B5
isolates, 6 subgenogroup C4 isolates, 1 subgenogroup C5 isolate, and
2 subgenogroup C2-like isolates identified according to the BLAST
analysis.

Due to the uncertain genotyping on partial VP1
gene, with no more than 93% of the nucleotide identity between the C2-like isolates and the reference
strains, each gene region of these two isolates was
further sequenced and recombination analyses conducted. The nucleotide and amino acid identities
between EV-71 subgenogroups were presented in
Table 1. No amino acid changes were observed for
C2-like isolates in the two regions of VP1 protein
which were capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies
(amino acids 163-177 and 208-222). Moreover, there
were no unique changes in three regions of VP1 protein, which were capable of inducing human EV-71specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation (amino acids 66-77,
145-159, and 247-261). The phylogenetic analysis
results showed that these 2 subgenogroup C2-like isolates formed a distinct cluster within genogroup C
based on P1 and P2 region nucleotide sequences
(Figure 3, panels A-B), and within genogroup B based
on P3 region nucleotide sequences (Figure 3, panel C).
The phylogenetic trees of each gene sequences were
shown in Additional File 1.
One suspected recombination event was shown in the
similarity plot and bootscan analyses between subgenogroup C2 and subgenogroup B3 of EV-71 (p < 0.01)
(Figure 4).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on partial VP1 gene
nucleotide sequences of reference strains from the GenBank and 11
representative isolates chosen from 989 sequenced isolates from
Taiwan in 2008. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the
neighbor-joining method with MEGA version 4 software, and the
reliabilities indicated at the branch nodes were evaluated using
1,000 bootstrap replications. Only values of over 70% were shown.
The prototype coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) G-10 strain was used as an
out-group.

were used for neutralization test. Table 2 shows the
neutralization antibody titers against different subgenogroups of EV-71. Based on the data against their
homo-subgenogroup viruses, antisera C2, C5, and B5
showed a 2- to 16-fold decrease in titers against their
hetero-subgenogroups. However, the result of neutralization antibody titers of the same antisera against
the C2-like subgenogroup showed an obvious difference
(p < 0.05), with an 8- to 128-fold decrease compared to
those of their homo-subgenogroup.
In addition, there were 11 pairs of serum samples used
for neutralization test in this study, including acute-phase
serum (3-7 days post infection) and recovery-phase serum
(15-39 days post infection) (Table 3). Sera obtained from
the patients with EV-71 infection belonging to subgenogroups B4, C4, C5, and B5 showed a maximum of
16-fold decrease in neutralization titers against heterosubgenogroups of EV-71 as compared to the ones against
their homo-subgenogroup. On the contrary, sera showed
a maximum of 128-fold decrease against the C2-like
subgenogroup. Taken together, these results indicated a
divergence of antigenic relationship between the subgenogroup C2-like and other subgenogroups.

drawn on the basis of the P1 region nucleotide sequences (A), the
P2 region nucleotide sequences (B), and the P3 region nucleotide
sequences (C).

Discussion
Enterovirus infections, especially EV-71, were associated
with HFMD, herpangina, and neurological diseases and
very common in the West Pacific region where Taiwan
locates. There has been about two thousands isolates in
Taiwan reported by the surveillance program each year
since 2001 [16,32]. Moreover, emergence of new EV-71
subgenogroups was reported continuously. Because the
VP1 gene is highly related to host neutralization antibodies and viral virulence, determining the genogroup of
EV-71 is generally based on the VP1 gene sequence
[17], and three genotypes were recognized accordingly
[14]. A combination of VP1 and 3D gene sequences was
proposed to be used for initial genotyping [19]. However, only a few studies about the antigenic variances of
EV-71 have been reported [29,33].
In this study, we reported a genetic and antigenic
diversity of EV-71 subgenogroups in Taiwan in 2008,
including 3 previously reported subgenogroup C5, B5,
C4, and one C2-like subgenogroup. The surveillance
results of EV-71 molecular epidemiology in Taiwan was
quite different from those in other counties, for example, genogroup C was the only one spotted in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006 and in Germany from
1997 to 2007 [24,25].
EV-71 of subgenogroup C5 was first isolated in southern Vietnam in 2005 and caused an outbreak with neurological disease and high prevalence [16]. According to
our surveillance data in 2008, the isolate of subgenogroup C5 was identified in July, and this

subgenogroups of enterovirus 71 using SimPlot, version 3.5.1, in a sliding window of 400 nucleotides with a 20 nucleotides step.

subgenogroup was still recognized in 2009 (unpublished
data). Although these subgenogroup C5 strains were in
low numbers and did not result in outbreaks in Taiwan in recent years [21], a previous report of EV-71
showed that the genogroups which caused outbreaks
were usually in circulation 2 to 5 years before the
onset of the outbreaks [29]. Hence we could not
exclude the possibility of an outbreak caused by subgenogroup C5 strains in the subsequent years. Subgenogroup B5 strains were isolated in Taiwan in 2003
and 2007, and became the dominant genogroup in outbreaks in 2008. The antigenic variation of subgenogroup B5 strains had been discussed previously
[21,29], and B1/B4, B5, and C2/C4 were divided into
different groups in the antigenic map. But in another
study, subgenogroup B5 was proposed to be redesignated as B4 based on the genetic analysis of complete
genome nucleotide sequences [19]. More studies are
needed to explain the inconsistent results between
antigenic and genetic typing.

Subgenogroup C4 circulated and evolved in neighbouring countries in recent years chronologically,
especially in China. There were two clusters of subgenogroup C4 strains in China from 1998 to 2008, C4b
(from 1998 to 2004) and C4a (from 2003 to 2008), and
the Shandong C4a strains were further divided into
three lineages [26]. In Taiwan, subgenogroup C4 was
first isolated in 1998 (as C4b cluster in China), and then
caused outbreaks from 2004 to 2005 (as C4a cluster in
China) [31]. According to the sequence analyses in this
study, we identified several C4 isolates which were correlated well with C4 strains in China in 2008-2009, but
not correlated with those isolated in Taiwan in 20042005, indicating that the virus was supposed to be transmitted from China (Figure 2). This subgenogroup
caused several outbreaks in China over the last four
years [26,34], but not in Taiwan, which was possibly due
to herd immunity related to the subgenogroup C4 epidemic in Taiwan from 2004 to 2005. However, we still
detected several subgenogroup C4 isolates in 2009

Huang et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:277

(unpublished data), and an increase of severe cases in
early 2010, indicating that a potential of subgenogroup
C4 outbreak in 2010 was expected, and to maintain a
comprehensive surveillance system for enteroviruses
seems to be a must.
Inter-genogroup, inter-subgenogroup and intra-subgenogroup average divergences of EV-71 complete genome
nucleotide sequences were 17-22%, 10-14% and 1-10%,
respectively [19]. However, further evidence is needed to
designate the subgenogroup C2-like as a new subgenogroup. On the other hand, the lower neutralization
antibody titers of subgenogroup C2-like (with a maximum of 128-fold decrease) indicated the antigenic differences with other subgenogroups (Table 2, Table 3).
In previous study, a close antigenic relationship among
the EV-71 isolates belonging to genogroups B and C
was reported. The neutralization titers of the antisera
for different genogroups of EV-71 ranged from 512 to
>1,024, while the titers of the antisera for homologous
EV-71 isolates were >1,024 [33]. The antigenic diversity
of subgenogroup C2-like viruses displayed in this study
may result in the inefficiency of herd immunity, and
cause concerns on vaccine development for EV-71, e.g.,
monovalent or polyvalent vaccine. In addition, to further
clarify the divergences, more researches using EV-71
monoclonal antibodies are needed for identification of
neutralization epitopes.
The subgenogroup C2-like was supposed to be a
recombinant originated from subgenogroup C2 and B3
based on a bootscan analysis. In addition, the subgenogroup C2-like viruses were isolated from different
patients in different month, demonstrating that this subgenogroup was not a single case but circulated for a
period of time. In Taiwan, subgenogroup C2 strains
were only observed in 1998 [35], but subgenogroup B3
strains were never reported before. It is difficult to trace
the actual spread route due to the recently more

frequent international travel and fluxes of laborers.
However, each gene region of the subgenogroup C2-like
was 73.2-95.1% identical to that of other subgenogroups
(Table 1), so it is supposed probably that the ancestors
of this subgenogroup were imported into Taiwan before
2008, experienced recombination events, and then
evolved into a unique subgenogroup. For enteroviruses,
recombination was most reported to occur in the nonstructural protein region [36], while few reports demonstrated recombination in the structural capsid protein
region [37]. The putative recombination breakpoint at
2B gene in this study was not reported yet. Other breakpoints at the 3’-termini of the 2A and 3C regions [38],
3D and 3’UTR regions [39] were identified in previous
reports. It was speculated that the higher degree of similarity in nonstructural protein region may favor the
occurrence of recombination. However, variants with
recombination or deletion mutations, especially in structural protein region, may not survive or replicate less
efficiently [13,40]. The subgenogroup C2-like strains
showed lower CCID50 than other subgenogroups (data
not shown), and it may explain why this subgenogroup
did not cause outbreaks in 2008. Another possibility was
that the prevalence of subgenogroup C2-like might be
underestimated due to asymptomatic infections or mild
illness despite a surveillance system had been set up.

Conclusions
In summary, firstly, we described a genetic and antigenic
diversity of EV-71 subgenogroups in Taiwan in 2008,
including 3 previously reported subgenogroups C5, B5,
and C4, and one C2-like subgenogroup. Secondly, the
subgenogroup C4 isolates in 2008 were genetically similar to the Chinese strains causing outbreaks in recent
years, so we need to closely monitor if these subgenogroup C4 outbreaks happen or not in Taiwan in the
next few years. Thirdly, due to the diversity of

phylogeny, rapid changing of subgenogroups, and the
potential of severe and fatal outbreaks on their way, it is
a must to monitor the recombination events as well as
antigenic and genetic evolution of EV-71 very attentively
and carefully.

Methods
Virus isolation and identification

EV-71 viruses used in this study were collected by the
surveillance systems under Centers for Disease Control,
Taiwan (Taiwan CDC). These 989 strains were isolated
from throat swabs, stools, sera, or cerebrospinal fluid specimens taken from patients with HFMD, herpangina, and
other symptoms related to enterovirus infection. Virus isolation was carried out using rhabdomyosarcoma (RD),
human diploid fibroblast (MRC-5), African green monkey
kidney (Vero), human lung carcinoma (A549), monkey
kidney (LLC-MK2), or human epidermoid carcinoma
(HEp-2) cell lines until cytopathic effects (CPE) were
observed. The isolates were then identified by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using an EV-71 commercial
monoclonal antibody (Light Diagnostic, USA). The
CCID 50 of the virus was calculated by the Reed and
Muench method [41].

RT-PCR and Sequencing

Viral RNA was extracted according to the manufactory
protocol from 140 μl of culture supernatant by QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA). Onestep RT-PCR of VP1 gene was performed for all 989
EV-71 isolates with primer set 159/162 [14], and fulllength RT-PCR was performed for two isolates (200807776 and 2008-00643) as described previously [13].
The products were confirmed by agarose electrophoresis
and were stained with ethidium bromide. DNA was
sequenced in both directions using BigDye Terminator
Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit and an automated
sequencer ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA).
Sequence analysis and recombination analysis

Identification and subtyping was carried out by
sequence comparisons with reference EV sequences in
GenBank using the BLAST [42] and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The DNA sequences were assembled
and then aligned with reference sequences using the
Clustal W program by BioEdit (version 7.0.9.0) software
[43]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining method by MEGA version 4 software

[44] with 1,000 replications of bootstrap analyses. The
prototype coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) G-10 strain was
used as an out-group. Detection of recombination
events among the subgenogroups of EV-71 viruses using
the full genome sequence was determined by similarity
plot and bootscan analyses using SimPlot, version 3.5.1
[45] as previously described [21,46]. The nucleotide
identity was calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter
method with a transition-transversion ratio of 10 [47]
and a sliding window of 400 nucleotides in 20 nucleotide steps. The recombination breakpoints were determined by the maximization of c2 analysis [48], and the
p values for the resulting informative sites were calculated using the c2 test.
Preparation of different subgenogroups EV-71 virus as
immunogen for rabbits immunization

Three ancient EV-71 strains of subgenogroups C2, C5
and B5 (AFP98111207, E2006125, and E2007599,
respectively) in Taiwan were selected for antiserum preparation. These strains were propagated in RD cells, and
the CCID50 was determined before animal inoculations.
Anti-enterovirus rabbit serum was prepared as described
preciously [49]. Briefly, New Zealand White rabbits were
immunized intravenously with 5 ml of UV-inactivated
virus stock (>10 8 CCID 50 /ml) of above three subgenogroups of EV-71. The animals were subsequently
boosted four times with the same dose at a 2-day interval,
except with a double dose (10 ml) at the final boosting on
day 42, and the sera were tested for neutralization antibodies on day 49.
Determination of neutralization antibody titers

Rabbit antisera and pairs of serum samples collected
during the acute-phase and recovery-phase from
patients with EV-71 infection were examined for neutralization antibodies. All sample determinations were performed in duplicate. Sera were first inactivated at 56ºC
for 30 min, and then diluted two-fold serially in DMEM
from 1:8 to 1:1,024. One-hundred CCID50 viruses (50
μl) were added to the well contained above serially
diluted antiserum, and the mixtures were then incubated
in a CO2 incubator at 36ºC for 60 min. Later, 100 μl of
RD cell suspension containing approximately 3 × 10 4
cells was added to each well, and the CPE was recorded
during the next 4 days. The neutralization end-point
titer is defined as the highest dilution fold at which 50%
of cells showing complete inhibition of CPE formation.
Statistical analysis

Differences between proportions were tested using the
c 2 test. The neutralization antibody titers were compared between the subgenogroup C2-like group and
other subgenogroup groups by using Student’s t-test

with log10-transformed data. The p value < 0.05 is taken
to indicate statistically significance.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The nucleotide sequences newly determined in this
study have been submitted to the GenBank under the
accession no. HM622381 to HM622392.
