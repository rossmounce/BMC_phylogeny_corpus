Abstract
Background: The identification of functional regions contained in a given multiple sequence alignment constitutes
one of the major challenges of comparative genomics. Several studies have focused on the identification of
conserved regions and motifs. However, most of existing methods ignore the relationship between the functional
genomic regions and the external evidence associated with the considered group of species (e.g., carcinogenicity
of Human Papilloma Virus). In the past, we have proposed a method that takes into account the prior knowledge
on an external evidence (e.g., carcinogenicity or invasivity of the considered organisms) and identifies genomic
regions related to a specific disease.
Results and conclusion: We present a new algorithm for detecting genomic regions that may be associated with
a disease. Two new variability functions and a bipartition optimization procedure are described. We validate and
weigh our results using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and thus assess to what extent the selected regions are
related to carcinogenicity, invasivity, or any other species classification, given as input. The predictive power of
different hit region detection functions was assessed on synthetic and real data. Our simulation results suggest that
there is no a single function that provides the best results in all practical situations (e.g., monophyletic or
polyphyletic evolution, and positive or negative selection), and that at least three different functions might be
useful. The proposed hit region identification functions that do not benefit from the prior knowledge (i.e.,
carcinogenicity or invasivity of the involved organisms) can provide equivalent results than the existing functions
that take advantage of such a prior knowledge. Using the new algorithm, we examined the Neisseria meningitidis
FrpB gene product for invasivity and immunologic activity, and human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein for
carcinogenicity, and confirmed some well-known molecular features, including surface exposed loops for
N. meningitidis and PDZ domain for HPV.

Background
Many bacteria and viruses adapt to changing environmental conditions through several evolutionary mechanisms such as homologous recombination [1], nucleotide
substitutions, insertions-deletions [2], horizontal gene
transfer [3], etc. These mechanisms lead to the formation

of different polymorphic strands of the same group of
organisms, in which the variation on the DNA composition is spread randomly throughout the genomes. The
survival of these strands depends on their ability to overcome the environmental changes [4]. One of the goals of
comparative genomics consists of finding the variation
among aligned genomic sequences in order to identify
functional regions. Several comparative genomic tools
allow the identification of genomic regions in an alignment that have evolutionnary patterns different from the

neutral evolution. For instance, PhastCons [5] predicts,
from a given alignment and the related phylogenetic tree,
the genomic regions under negative selection. PAML
[6-8] allows the comparison of synonymous versus nonsynonymous mutations in an alignment in order to predict regions under selective pressure. RDP3 [9] and
TOPAL [10] are software packages including several
methods for detecting recombination. Most of these
methods and software do not take into consideration
external epidemiological evidence associated with many
bacterial and virus strands. Such an evidence can
allow the clustering of organisms based not only on the
similarity of their genomic sequences, but also, on their
association to different diseases. Hence, intra-specific and
inter-specific variation among carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic human papilloma viruses can lead to the
identification of regions related to carcinogenicity. In our
previous works, we introduced a hit region identification
function using prior knowledge information [11] and
described the related validation framework based on
Monte-Carlo simulations [12]. Then, we extended the
latter study by presenting and testing four variants of the
hit region identification function, still using the available
prior knowledge [13]. In this paper, we present a new
algorithm for the identification of specific genomic
regions associated with an external disease. The introduced algorithm uses a bipartition optimization procedure to maximize a specific clustering function Q, based
on inter- and intra-group variability, for each window
position, over the given sequence alignment. It can be
applied with or without prior knowledge information
characterizing species in hand. Hit regions (i.e., putative
regions related to a disease) can be validated using ARI
[14] (a corrected-for-chance version of the Rand index
[15]) and organismal bipartitions are constructed using
the available epidemiological data. The new algorithm
has been applied to two independent datasets: The
human papilloma viruses and the Neisseria meningitidis
data. The obtained results suggest that genomic regions
with important biological features in both datasets can be
associated with either carcinogenicity or invasivity.

Dataset description
Neisseria meningitidis dataset

Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram negative bacterium
responsible for meningitis and septicemia. It has a relatively small genome size of 2.2 Mbp. In March 2011, the
PubMLST database listed a total of 8,793 genetically distinct members of Neisseria organisms [16]. All these
facts make N. meningitidis well suited for testing comparative genomics methods [17]. Proteins expressed
under iron limitation (e.g. FrpB(FetA)) are considered as
potential vaccine components [18]. Bacteria grown
under iron starvation express several proteins, the most

Page 2 of 10

abundant of them being FrpB, a 70kDa outer membrane
protein (OMP). It is expressed in large amounts in all
strains, and antibodies against this protein appear to be
bactericidal. A putative FrpB topology was first proposed
with a 26-stranded b-barrel [19], and later reassessed to
a plug domain and a 22-stranded b-barrel with 11 surface-exposed loops [20]. These loops are accessible to
the host immune system, which produces natural antibodies against these regions. In general, bacteria express
genetic sequence variability in order to evade this
defense mechanism.
The data we considered, were classified on the invasivity basis using a list of identified hyperinvasive meningococci [21]. We then built a list of unique FetA sequence
tags carried by the alleles of these organisms. Using local
BLAST operations [22], we searched for the presence of
these tags in the distinct sequences belonging to the
selected multiple sequence alignment (MSA), first examined in [13]. We classified as belonging to the invasive
category (subset X) any allele that contained at least one
of the selected invasive tags. All the other alleles were
put in the non-invasive category (subset Y). We annotated the MSA with the information regarding surfaceexposed loops, beta-sheets and periplasmic loops [20].
Translating indexes from the amino-acid sequences to
DNA sequences were also computed. Each single value
of the hit region identification function Q (the Q-type
functions will be used to identify genetic regions that
may be related to a disease) corresponds to an interval of
a certain length (i.e., 9 or 20 nucleotides in this study)
and depends on the starting position of the sliding window used in our algorithm.
Human papilloma virus dataset

Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have a causal role in
cervical cancer with almost half a million new cases
occurring each year [23-25]. About a hundred of HPV
types have been identified, and the whole genomes of
more than eighty of them have been sequenced (see the
latest Universal Virus Database report by International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)). A typical
HPV genome is a double-stranded, circular DNA genome of size close to 8 Kbp, with a small set of genes
(L1, L2, E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7). In this study, we
focused on the gene E6, which is predominantly linked
to cancer due to the binding of its product to the p53
tumor suppressor protein. It contains a PDZ domainbinding motif (-X-T-X-V) at its carboxy terminus,
which is essential for targeting the PDZ proteins for
proteasomal degradation. Such proteins include hDlg,
hScrib, MAGI-1, MAGI-2, MAGI-3 and MUPP1 [26].
The interaction between E6 and hDlg, or the other PDZ
domain-containing proteins, may be an underlying
mechanism in the development of HPV-associated

Badescu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 9):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S9/S9

cancers [27]. The gene E6 was also shown to contain
two stable folded domains, E6N and E6C [28,29]. Models of these domains have been built in the absence of
complete crystallographic data [30].
To define carcinogenic types, we used the epidemiological data from a large international survey on HPV in
cervical cancer and from a multicenter case-control
study conducted on 3,607 women with histologically
confirmed cervical cancer [31,32]. More than 89% of
them had squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., Squam cancer)
and about 5% had adenosquamous carcinoma (i.e.,
Adeno cancer). More than a half of the infection cases
were due to the types 16 and 18 of HPV, which are
later referred to as High-Risk HPV [33]. In this study,
we examined the content of the gene E6 for 83 different
HPV types.
We fixed the window size to 20 nucleotides for HPV
datasets in order to be consistent with our previous
works [11,12], where we conducted simulations with
windows of different sizes and used the size of 20 bp to
present the results. In the same way, we considered the
window size of 9 nucleotides for the N. meningitidis
dataset to be consistent with another our study [13].

algorithm parameter. We denote by Q′ a specific version
of the Q-type function computed under condition that
the subsets bipartition is unknown (i.e., prior knowledge).
The complete algorithmic scheme is presented in Algorithm 1 in Additional file 1 .
Clustering using the Q-type functions

To perform the clustering of our data into two groups A
and B, we first calculate the intragroup variability of the
sequences from the group A, denoted by V(A), the group
B, denoted by V(B), and, finally, the intergroup variability
D(A, B), as described in Equations 1, 2 and 3. These measures are defined as the means of the squared Hamming
distances, dist, among the sequence fragments (bounded
by the sliding window position) of the taxa from the
group A only, from the group B only, and between the
sequence fragments from the distinct groups A and B:
V ( A) =

V (B) =

1
N ( A)( N ( A) − 1) / 2

Description of the algorithm

The new algorithm takes as input a MSA established for
a set of organisms. Assume that this set of organisms is
partitioned into two different subsets according to a boolean criterion (e.g., invasivity vs. non-invasivity or carcinogenicity vs. non-carcinogenicity). The corresponding
subsets are denoted X (invasive/carcinogenic) and Y
(non-invasive/non-carcinogenic), respectively. The region
of interest is scanned using a non-overlapping sliding
window, as shown in Figure 1, of a fixed width (20 sites
for HPV and 9 sites for N. meningitidis). For each window position, we carry out a bipartition optimization
algorithm in order to search for maximum values of the
hit region identification function. A specific version of
the Q-type function (see below) can be taken as the

In [11-13] four different hit region identification functions, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, which could be summarized
by the following equation, were defined:
Q = D( A, B) − k × V ( A) − l × V (B),

where the [k, l] combinations are as follows:
{Q1  (1, 0), Q 2  (0, 1), Q 3  ( 1 , 1 ), Q 4  (0, 0) .

The function Q4 (Equation 5), along with new versions
of the hit region identification function, denoted by Q5
(Equation 6) and Q6 (Equation 7), will be tested and discussed in this study:

Measuring the agreement between the reference and the
optimal calculated bipartitions using the Adjusted Rand
Index (ARI)

The Adjusted Rand Index [14] has become a criterion of
choice for measuring agreement between two partitions

in clustering analysis [34]. Having a calculated bipartition U″ = A|B and a reference bipartition U′ = X|Y, for
all n pairs of elements, one can compute how many
2
of them fall into the same group and how many in different groups. One can then calculate ARI [35] according to Equation 8. ARI is the corrected-for-chance
version of the Rand index [15]. It ranges between -1 and
1, and expresses the level of concordance between two
bipartitions [14]. The values of ARI close to 1 indicate
an almost perfect concordance between the two compared bipartitions, whereas the values close to -1 indicate a complete discordance between them:

that are in the same group in the bipartitions U″ and U
′, b is the number of pairs that are in the same group in
the bipartition U″ and in different groups in the bipartition U′, c is the number of pairs that are in different
groups in the bipartition U″ and in the same group in U
′, and d is the number of pairs that are in different
groups in the bipartitions U″ and U′.
Validation of the obtained hit regions using the Adjusted
Rand Index

We define a new function Q″ reflecting the quality of
the reference bipartition, as follows:
Q′′ = ARI × Q′.

(9)

The difference between Q′ and Q″ indicates the level
of concordance of the reference bipartition U′ with the
selected function Q. Throughout the paper, Q will
denote the hit identification function using prior knowledge information, Q′ – not using any prior knowledge
information and Q″ – using prior knowledge information and based on ARI.
Bipartition optimization

For each window position, we generated a fixed number
of random initial bipartitions. For each such a bipartition, we moved elements from one subset to the other
and back again in cycles, each time accepting the move
that maximized the objective function Q, until no
further improvement was possible. Once a local maxima
was reached, we compared it to the best current value
obtained for all starting random bipartitions tested so
far. ARI was used to compare the level of concordance
of the obtained bipartition (i.e., the one that was maximizing the given function Q) with the reference bipartition (carcinogenic vs. non-carcinogenic taxa for HPV
and invasive vs. non-invasive taxa for N. meningitidis)
given as a parameter to the algorithm.

Time complexity

The time complexity of the new algorithm carried out
with an overlapping sliding window of a fixed width,
and advancing one alignment site by step, is O(l × n2 ×
w × r), where l is the length of the MSA, n the number
of considered species, r the number of random initial
partition generations and w the window width. In order
to ensure this complexity, we have to limit the optimization cycle to a constant number of iterations.
Simulation study

In order to validate the hit region identification functions
Q′5 , Q′5 and Q′ , we conducted a Monte-Carlo simula6
tion study involving two major evolutionary mechanisms:
Positive selection (PS) and Lineage specific selection
(LSS). Two cases of group selection were also tested: The
cases of the monophyletic and polyphyletic clustering.
An approach involving the computation of p-values was
implemented to asses the predictive ability of each of the
three functions for each combination of evolutionary
parameters. The following procedure was carried out. A
phylogenetic tree T with 16 leaves was first generated
using the algorithm described by Kuhner and Felsenstein
[36]. The edge lengths of T were generated using an
exponential distribution. Following the approach of
Guindon and Gascuel [37], we added some noise to the
tree edges in order to provide a deviation from the molecular clock hypothesis. The random trees yielded by this
procedure had depth of O(log(16)). The tree was then
rooted by midpoint. For the monophyletic test, the left
and right sub-trees, denoted by T1 and T2, were determined, depending on the position of the root. For the
polyphyletic test, two sets of leaves were randomly chosen and the corresponding sub-trees, denoted by T3 and
T4, were extracted.
In the PS simulations, we used the original lengths of
the edges of the subtrees T1 and T2 (i.e., monophyletic
case), and T3 and T4 (i.e., polyphyletic case), while all
edge lengths of T were gradually multiplied by the scaling factor a, varying from 0.05 to 1 (with the step of
0.05).
In the LSS simulations, all edge lengths of T were
multiplied by 0.5 (thus simulating neutral evolution),
while all edge lengths of T1 and T3 were multiplied by
the scaling factor a1 = 0.5 + 0.025x, and all edge lengths
of T2 and T4 by a2 = 0.5 – 0.025x, where x was varying
from 1 to 19.
Second, we executed the SeqGen program [38] to generate random MSAs of nucleotide sequences along the
edges of the phylogenetic trees constructed at the first
step. The SeqGen program was used with the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution [39]. DNA sequences
with 440 bp were generated for each tree T. In addition,
MSAs of the length 20 bp were generated for each of the

Badescu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 9):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S9/S9

trees T1, T2, T3 and T4. Two different variants of MSA
were produced to simulate monophyletic and polyphyletic
evolution. In the sequence alignment generated for the
original tree T, we inserted those generated for the trees
T1 and T2 in the monophyletic case, and those generated
for the trees T3 and T4 in the polyphyletic case. The location of the inserted sequence blocks was known.
Thus, depending on the scaling factor parameters, for
the PS case we simulated a variable homogeneous
region inside a conserved context, and for the LSS case
a more divergent region inside a neutral context. Third,
we scanned the resulting sequence alignment using a
sliding window of size 20 bp with the step of 1. We calculated the value of the hit region identification functions Q′4 , Q′5 and Q′ for each fixed position of the
6
window and assessed the proportion of their values that
were higher than the reference value corresponding to
the inserted region.
These steps were repeated over 100 different replicates
and the distributions of the best (in each case) function
over each combination of testing parameters were represented using quartiles.

Results and discussion
We proposed a new algorithm for finding genomic
regions that may be related to a disease along with two
new hit region identification functions Q5 and Q6. Both
new functions along with the best existing function Q4
were tested in simulations. The functions yielding the
best results for each case were illustrated in Figure 2:
Monophyletic evolution (case a: PS, case b: LSS) and
Figure 3: Polyphyletic evolution (case a: PS, case b: LSS).
The remaining results for the Q′4 , Q′5 and Q′ func6
tions are presented in Additional file 1. Figures 2 and 3
clearly show that the hit zone identification in the
monophyletic case is much easier than in polyphyletic
case. We can suggest that in order to be recognized, the
hit region has to have a different evolutionary speed
than the context in which it resides. The polyphyletic
lineage specific case represents the hardest evolutionary
situation. Also, one can notice that different Q-type
functions, Q′4 , Q′5 or Q′ , should be used in different
6
practical situations.
The procedure for the identification of hit regions was
carried out to detect the variability zones in the FrpB
gene of N. meningitidis as well as the regions potentially
responsible for cancer in the gene E6 of HPV. In both
cases, we also carried out the ARI validation.
Neisseria meningitidis analysis

We scanned the MSA of the FrpB gene using the new
algorithm with a sliding window of size 9 nucleotides.
We compared the obtained results to the putative

Remarkably, all surface exposed loops confirmed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i.e., L2, L3, L4, L5

Q′4 and Q′5 . It is worth noting that our algorithm was
able to find the loop L4, which is hidden between the
loops L5 and L3. The model loops L1, L8 and L9 were
found at their predicted positions. The loops L2 and L11
were found at different positions, while the loops L6 and
L7 were missed regardless of the availability of the prior

small. On such a small timescale, underlining evolutionary processes are usually not very diverse. It would be
also interesting to verify whether similar conclusions
could be made for other outer membrane proteins.

knowledge information (see Figure 4b and c). As protein
models gradually improve and more crystallographic data
become available, it will be interesting to reassess these
results in the future. Both presented Q′-type functions
(Equations 5-6) overlap along the alignment, with the
exception of the largest loop (L5) and the second largest
loop (L3), where the amino acid variability is largely confined. The function Q′4 correlates best with surface
exposed loops structure. This suggests that the divergences in shape between the functions Q′4 and Q′5
might be used to detect immunologic activity. It is
known that bactericidal antibodies are directed against
variable regions situated in the largest loops of proteins
[40]. Note that the organisms compared here were strains
of the same bacterium; their genetic variant being alleles

We performed a scan of the MSA of the gene E6 for 83
HPV organisms (using non-overlapping windows of size
20 nucleotides). Each time the species bipartition was
known, High-Risk HPV against all other HPV types in
Figure 5a, Squam-Risk HPV against all other HPV types
in Figure 6a, and Adeno-Risk HPV against all other
HPV types in Figure 6b, it was incorporated in the computational procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. The
comparative results for the High Risk HPV subset provided by the new algorithm without prior knowledge of
carcinogenic taxa and those yielded by the former one
[11], are presented in Figure 5 using annotations for
HPV-16. Figure 5a illustrates the results obtained using
the functions Q4 and Q5 using a prior knowledge on the
species carcinogenicity.
According to the new algorithm, see Figure 5b, the
PDZ domain is ranked first in the annotated part of the
alignment. A detailed view of the terminal aligned
region, within the index interval 680-740, shows a small
left shift in the peak positions of the function Q′4 (5b) ,
but inside the same C-terminal tail domain. On the left
side, flanking the PDZ domain, one can find the E6C
domain which is related to the DNA binding [30]. One
can notice that the function peaks (see Figure 5a and
5b) of Q′4 are almost in the same positions than those
found using Q4, exception being a region at the beginning of the alignment (i.e., at the beginning of the E6N
domain). As for N. meningitidis loops, it would be interesting to study in greater details the regions recognized
by both tested functions, Q′4 and Q′5 .
We can conclude, by comparing Figures 5a and 5b,
that the new functions, Q′4 and Q′5 , provide almost
identical hit region recovery than the existing functions
Q4 and Q5, which take advantage of a prior knowledge
on the species carcinogenicity.
The Q″ function validation was also carried out for
HPV data. The results are presented in Figure 6. Here,
the PDZ domain ranks first for both tested datasets,
related to the Squam and Adeno cancers (Figures 6a
and 6b). The peaks were found at almost the same positions as in Figure 5, with the exception that only some
of the peaks shown in Figure 5 are present here. The
function Q′′ seems to be less variable than the function
4
Q′′ . For the Squam dataset, there is one peak in the
5
E6C domain, absent in the Adeno dataset, with a high
monophyletic signal and unknown annotation.

PDZ-doirmm is highlighted in gray. Annotations for the N and Cterminal arms, E6N and E6C domains are represented for HPV16
coordinates, from (Nominé et al., 2006) [30]. Zn2+-ligating Cys
residues annotations reproduced from Lipari et al., 2001 [28].

On the other hand, the peak located at the index 660,
and corresponding to the window positions 660-680,
includes two putative Zn2+-ligating Cys residues whose
absence in mutants results in a dramatic loss in the p53
degradation activity [28].
By analyzing Figures 4, 5 and 6, one can notice that in
some situations prior knowledge information brings an
important advantage to the method (see the case of
Figure 4c when the use of the prior knowledge along
with the ARI coefficient allows for getting rid of some
false positive hits; for instance, the false positive picks
found using Q′-tgpe functions around the indices 1225
and 1500 presented in Figure 4b were not found by the
Q″-type functions presented in Figure 4c as well as the
case of an almost perfect PDZ domain recovery provided by the Q″-type functions as shown in Figures 6a
and 6b), but in the other cases, the new algorithm is
capable of correct recovering hit regions without any

prior knowledge (e.g., see the cases of the loops L1, L3,
L5, L8, L9 and L10 for the N. meningitidis dataset).

Conclusion
We described a new algorithm for finding genomic
regions that may be associated with a disease. It is capable of detecting hit regions without prior knowledge on
the carcinogenicity or invasivity of related organisms.
This is an important improvement over previous works
in the field [11-13]. We also showed as the Adjusted
Rand Index [14,34,35] can be incorporated in the hit
detection procedure. The discussed algorithm can be
directly used to study organisms that have an ambivalent
behavior and are, thus, more difficult to classify. For
instance, some strains of Neisseria Meningitidis show a
hyperinvasive behavior during epidemics, but are noninvasive, otherwise. The behavior of some other organisms, like human papilloma viruses (HPV), is more consistent. Such organisms can be clearly classified with
respect to their level of carcinogenicity. Species bipartitions, established according to a carcinogenicity or invasivity criterion, suggested in the literature are important

Badescu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 9):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S9/S9

for the identification of genomic regions responsible for a
related disease. We showed, however, that a successful
identification of these regions can be accomplished without any prior knowledge of the species classification (Figure 5). Considering, in parallel, several hit region
identification functions can provide more insight into the
structure of genomic regions (Figures 4, 5 and 6). Simulation results suggest that there is no a unique function
that provides the best overall results in all practical situations (e.g., the case of monophyletic or polyphyletic evolution and positive or negative selection), and that at
least three different functions might be useful (Figures 2
and 3). It is worth noting that the monophyletic scenarios
are easier to detect than the polyphyletic ones. The function Q5 allows for a better detection of monophyletic scenarios, while in the polyphyletic case, the functions Q4
and Q6 provide the best results in the positive selection
context and in the lineage specific selection context,
respectively. The application of the described functions
to the HPV gene E6 allows one to retrace the hit regions
that are well-known to be related to carcinogenicity
[26-28,30].
Furthermore, the results given by these functions while
analyzing the FetA sequences of Neisseria meningitidis
suggest a large overlap between the regions with surfaceexposed loops and those detected by the hit region identification functions (Figure 4). All these results indicate the
ability of the proposed algorithm to identify regions with
bipartite evolutionary signatures according to different
patterns of evolution. Each time the species bipartition
was known, High-Risk HPV against all other HPV types in
Figure 5a, Squam-Risk HPV against all other HPV types in
Figure 6a, and Adeno-Risk HPV against all other HPV
types in Figure 6b, it was incorporated in the computational procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. In the future, it
will be important to assess the correlation between different non-overlapping detected hit regions present in the
given alignment. It would be also interesting to compare
the performance of the introduced bi-clustering algorithm
with the existing bi-clustering methods currently used in
bioinformatics, including SAMBA [41], Crossing Minimization [42] and cMonkey [43]. Another possibility consists
of using a k-means [44] type of algorithms that can suggest
partitioning of the given dataset in several, and not necessarily in two, classes when the exact number of classes is
unknown. For instance, in the case of HPV data, one
could consider the three following HPV classes: High-Risk
HPV (types 16 and 18), Low-Risk HPV (types 6, 11, 26, 31,
33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 66, 73, 81, 82 and
83) and No-Risk HPV (all other HPV types).
It is worth noting that the presented algorithm, like
most of the comparative genomics methods, relies on the
assumption of the alignment correctness. Thus, it will be

Page 9 of 10

also important to analyze the impact of alignment errors
on the results of the proposed hit detection procedure.

Abscissa represents the difference in scaling factors among the two
lineages present in the hit region. Values close to 0 represent
homogeneous evolutionnary speed (similar to the neutral context in
which it resides), while values close to 1 represent divergence among
these lineages. Context is always maintained at a scaling factor of 0.5,
simulating neutral evolution. Horizontal dashed line represents the
significance threshold of 0.05. In the case of lineage specific selection,
the value of the Q′-type functions corresponding to 1 on the abscissa
scale cannot be computed because it involves a sub-tree with 0 edge
lengths.
