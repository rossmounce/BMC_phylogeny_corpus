Abstract
Background: Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus can usually be distinguished by standard
microbiological methods (e.g., motility, hemolysis, penicillin susceptibility and susceptibility to
gamma phage) and PCR. However, we have identified 23 Bacillus spp. isolates that gave discrepant
results when assayed by standard microbiological methods and PCR. We used multiple-locus
variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), multiple-locus sequence typing (MLST), and
phenotypic analysis to characterize these isolates, determine if they cluster phylogenetically and
establish whether standard microbiological identification or PCR were associated with false
positive/negative results.
Results: Six isolates were LRN real-time PCR-positive but resistant to gamma phage; MLVA data
supported the identification of these isolates as gamma phage-resistant B. anthracis. Seventeen
isolates were LRN real-time PCR-negative but susceptible to gamma phage lysis; these isolates
appear to be a group of unusual gamma phage-susceptible B. cereus isolates that are closely related
to each other and to B. anthracis. All six B. anthracis MLVA chromosomal loci were amplified from
one unusual gamma phage-susceptible, motile, B. cereus isolate (although the amplicons were
atypical sizes), and when analyzed phylogenetically, clustered with B. anthracis by MLST.
Conclusion: MLVA and MLST aided in the identification of these isolates when standard
microbiological methods and PCR could not definitely identify or rule out B. anthracis. This study
emphasized the need to perform multiple tests when attempting to identify B. anthracis since relying
on a single assay remains problematic due to the diverse nature of bacteria.

Background
Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus are two closely related
gram-positive species belonging to the B. cereus group (B.
anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis,
B. pseudomycoides and B. mycoides). Despite their close
genetic relatedness, in general B. anthracis has several phenotypic characteristics making it easily differentiated from
B. cereus and other members of the B. cereus group. B.

anthracis is non-hemolytic on sheep blood agar, susceptible to penicillin, lysed by the gamma phage, and nonmotile. Conversely, B. cereus is hemolytic on sheep blood
agar, resistant to penicillin, resistant to lysis by the gamma
phage, and motile. In addition, B. anthracis harbors two
virulence plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, which B. cereus
lacks, although a recent reports have showed that rare B.
cereus isolates harbor genes and similar plasmids closely

related to pXO1 and pXO2 [1-6]. However, standard
microbiologic identification can be complicated when
isolates of B. anthracis are cured of both plasmids, are
phage-resistant, or when rare non-hemolytic, gamma
phage-susceptible B. cereus isolates are encountered [7].
Recently, more than 600 B. anthracis strains were recovered from a large collection of Bacillus spp. isolates that
had been stored at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) from the 1950s through the 1980s [8].
All isolates were assayed using standard microbiological
procedures, such as colony morphology on sheep blood
agar (SBA) and the gamma phage susceptibility test [9]. In
addition, all isolates were assayed using the B. anthracisspecific Laboratory Response Network (LRN) real-time
PCR, which has been shown to have 100% sensitivity and
specificity and includes three separate targets: one region
on the B. anthracis chromosome and one region on each
virulence plasmid, pXO1 and pXO2 [10]. During that
study, 23 isolates were recovered that were not clearly
identified or ruled out as B. anthracis due to discrepant

results between standard microbiologic tests and the LRN
PCR.
In the current study we used multiple-locus variablenumber tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and multiplelocus sequence typing (MLST) to identify and differentiate
the 23 isolates that gave discrepant gamma phage susceptibility and PCR results. MLVA uses eight loci (six chromosomal and two plasmid) to discriminate B. anthracis
isolates. MLVA has differentiated B. anthracis into 89 genotypes in two major clusters (A and B) and was used successfully to link clinical, powder, and environmental
isolates from the 2001 anthrax outbreak [11,12]. In addition to its subtyping capabilities, Keim et al. reported that
MLVA could be used to reliably identify B. anthracis
because close relatives, such as B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, generally only amplify 0–2 MLVA loci, and any resulting allele sizes do not correspond to those observed in B.
anthracis [12]. MLST is based on the sequencing of defined
segments of seven housekeeping genes and also has
recently been introduced as a typing method for members

of the B. cereus group [13,14]. While this method is less
discriminatory in differentiating B. anthracis isolates than
MLVA, it has been used successfully to distinguish B.
anthracis from its closest relatives within the B. cereus
group. Both of these molecular methods, in addition to
other standard microbiological methods, were used to
characterize these 23 diagnostically challenging isolates,
determine if they cluster phylogenetically, and establish
whether standard microbiological identification or PCR
were associated with false positive/negative results.

Results
Susceptibility to lysis by gamma phage, hemolysis,
susceptibility to penicillin, and real-time PCR
The isolates in this study were chosen because they could
not be definitively identified using gamma phage susceptibility and the LRN real-time PCR specific for B. anthracis

which targets three genes: one on the B. anthracis chromosome and one on each virulence plasmid, pXO1 and
pXO2. No isolates were positive for all three markers. Seventeen of the 23 isolates were susceptible to gamma phage
lysis but gave negative results for all three LRN real-time
PCR targets [Table 1]. Two of these isolates were betahemolytic on SBA, 14 were non-hemolytic, and one isolate was weakly hemolytic on SBA. The 14 non-hemolytic
isolates had typical colony morphology of B. anthracis on
an SBA plate, and with the exception of having negative
PCR results, appeared to be consistent with B. anthracis.
The remaining six isolates were resistant to gamma phage
lysis and positive for the B. anthracis chromosomal marker
used in the LRN real-time PCR. In addition to the chromosomal marker, two isolates were PCR-positive for the
pXO2 marker and one isolate was positive for the pXO1
marker. The six gamma phage-resistant isolates were non-

hemolytic and had the typical colony morphology for B.
anthracis on SBA. All 23 isolates were susceptible to penicillin.
MLVA
All 23 isolates were assayed by MLVA [Table 1]. All six
PCR-positive, gamma phage-resistant isolates amplified
all six VNTR loci located on the chromosome, indicating
that these isolates were most likely gamma phage-resistant
B. anthracis. In addition, one of the two plasmid markers
was amplified in three of these isolates.

Among the 17 PCR-negative, gamma phage-susceptible
isolates analyzed by MLVA, 16 isolates only amplified 0–
1 of the eight VNTR loci. Thirteen isolates produced a vrrA
282-bp amplicon, and one isolate produced a vrrA 261-bp
amplicon. However, neither of these sizes has been previously observed in B. anthracis strains [12]. Two isolates
did not amplify any of the chromosomal VNTR loci and
none of the 17 isolates amplified either plasmid VNTR
loci. This data suggested that these isolates were gamma
phage-susceptible Bacillus spp. and not B. anthracis. One
PCR-negative,
gamma
phage-susceptible
isolate,
2000031002, amplified all six chromosomal VNTR loci.
However, four of the loci (CG3, vrrB2, vrrB1, and vrrC1)
had previously unobserved allele sizes for B. anthracis. The
other two loci were consistent with allele sizes previously
seen in B. anthracis.
MLST
All 23 isolates were assayed by MLST [Table 1]. The 17
PCR-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolates were
analyzed by MLST for further identification and to determine if these isolates were phylogenetically related. Three
new sequence types (ST) were observed: ST 129, ST 130
and ST 132, all of which cluster in Clade 1, which includes
the Anthracis lineage as defined by Priest et al. [Figure 1]
[14]. Fifteen isolates were identified as ST 129. Of the 15
isolates, one was hemolytic; the remaining isolates were
non-hemolytic.
One
weakly
hemolytic
isolate
(2000031002) was designated ST 130, and an additional
hemolytic isolate (2002013100) was designated ST 132.
ST 129 and ST 132 clustered with other B. cereus STs in
Clade 1, which includes the Anthracis lineage, but were
sufficiently divergent from the B. anthracis STs, allowing
clear differentiation. ST 130, however, grouped within the
B. anthracis lineage [Figure 1] and is a double-locus variant of ST 1.

MLST performed on the six gamma phage-resistant isolates identified four isolates of ST 1 and single isolates of
ST 134 and ST 135, both of which are new STs observed
for B. anthracis. These three STs all cluster within the B.
anthracis lineage [Figure 1].

Discussion
Discrepancies between standard microbiologic identification and the LRN PCR results were observed for 23 isolates
that were recovered after long-term storage. MLVA and
MLST were performed to aid in resolving the discrepancies
and identify these isolates. For the six gamma phageresistant, PCR-positive isolates, all six chromosomal
MLVA loci were successfully amplified supporting the
identification of these isolates as gamma phage-resistant
B. anthracis. Aside from being gamma phage-resistant,
these isolates were typical B. anthracis. These isolates had
the typical colony morphology, were non-hemolytic, susceptible to penicillin, and clustered with B. anthracis by
MLST. All of the methods used in this study strongly support their identification as B. anthracis. Gamma phageresistant B. anthracis, while uncommon, have been previously documented [15].
For 16 of the 17 gamma phage and penicillin susceptible,
PCR-negative isolates, MLST analysis supports the identification of these isolates as B. cereus that are closely related
to each other and to B. anthracis based on their STs and
position in Clade 1 (as described by Priest et al.) [14].
While B. cereus and B. thuringiensis cannot be distinguished by MLST, Clade 1 is comprised of predominantly
B. anthracis and B. cereus strains. The MLVA data also supported the identification of these isolates as B. cereus. Previous reports have documented the existence of gamma
phage-susceptible B. cereus isolates such as these, but they
are rarely encountered [7]. Since the identification of the
B. anthracis gamma phage receptor has recently been characterized, it would be interesting to sequence the gamR
gene of these isolates and to correlate these results with
gamma phage susceptibility [16].
One PCR-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolate,
2000031002, collected in 1960 from the Belgian Congo,
provided the most peculiar results. This isolate was penicillin-susceptible, amplified all six MLVA chromosomal
loci (although four allele sizes were unusual), and clustered with B. anthracis strains by MLST. It has been previously documented that a limited number of MLVA
markers will amplify in B. cereus or B. thuringiensis [12],
and a small number of closely related non-B. anthracis isolates have been identified that amplify all six chromosomal loci (although the alleles were sizes not previously
seen in B. anthracis) [P. Keim, personal communication].
However, this isolate was weakly hemolytic and motile
(data not shown). In addition, this isolate was PCR negative for both plasmids markers by the LRN real-time PCR
and also did not amplify the MLVA plasmid markers.
Although this isolate has several characteristics consistent
with B. anthracis, based on the specificity of the PCR (as
previously described and in this study), unusual VNTR
allele sizes, and the lack of previous documentation of

motile B. anthracis isolates, this isolate is most likely a very
unusual B. cereus.
The isolates in this study are a small subset of a larger
Bacillus spp. collection that was recovered after long-term
storage (between 20–50 years) and limited descriptive
information is available for many isolates in this collection [8]. For the isolates that we studied, we presume that
the gamma phage-resistant B. anthracis were pathogenic
when first isolated but lost the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids
during storage [8]. We presume that isolates of human
and animal origin were fully virulent when first isolated as
both plasmids are needed to cause disease. Marston et al.
showed many of the isolates in the original collection had
loss one or both virulence plasmids during storage [8]. In
addition, environmental isolates were most likely virulent
at the time of collection because these isolates followed
the same pattern of plasmid loss over time as the clinical
isolates in that study. For the B. cereus isolates, it is more
difficult to ascertain their pathogenicity as B. cereus isolates can exhibit a wide range of virulence and cause a variety of infections [17]. Several methods suggest that
isolates closely related to B. anthracis tend to be clinical
(versus environmental) in nature [13,18,19]. However,
MLST data has shown clinical isolates including isolates
associated with severe disease are not clonal or restricted
to the B. anthracis Clade[20]. Thus, pathogenicity can not
be confidently deduced based on their phylogenetic relatedness.
In addition to having a negative result for the chromosomal marker, none of the gamma phage-susceptible B.
cereus isolates were PCR positive for either plasmid
marker. Their original identification was most likely based
on phenotypic characteristics, as molecular methods such
as PCR were not available at the time of collection and the
plasmid profiles of these isolates could not be easily determined. Although B. anthracis and B. cereus are very closely
related, they differ greatly in their pathogenicity which is
generally attributed to the presence of plasmid encoded
factors. For B. anthracis, these virulence factors are
encoded on pXO1 and pXO2; however, recent reports
have shown that other species can harbor genes and plasmids similar to pXO1 and pXO2 [1-6]. The possibility of
horizontal transfer or curing of plasmids emphasizes the
importance of using a chromosomal marker for the identification of B. anthracis.

Conclusion
A primary concern when encountering unusual Bacillus
isolates such as those included in this study is the need to
positively identify or rule out B. anthracis. These isolates
could not be definitively identified using gamma phage
susceptibility, hemolysis on SBA, and penicillin susceptibility. B. anthracis isolates that are gamma phage-resistant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/22

or cured of both plasmids and rare non-hemolytic,
gamma phage-susceptible B. cereus isolates can complicate the identification of B. anthracis. Rarely, B. anthracis
can be resistant to gamma phage lysis (1% of B. anthracis
isolates that were originally recovered from storage in our
collection). In addition, some B. cereus isolates that are
phylogenetically closely related to B. anthracis are gamma
phage-susceptible. Interestingly, 15 of 17 gamma phagesusceptible isolates were indistinguishable by MLST (ST
129), and all three STs identified (ST 129, ST 130, and ST
132) cluster closely with B. anthracis in Clade 1. Thus, isolates that were closely related phylogenetically to B.
anthracis were also phenotypically similar to B. anthracis.
In this study, the combination of MLVA, MLST and the
LRN PCR data were used to identify gamma phage-resistant B. anthracis isolates and B. cereus isolates phylogenetically and phenotypically very similar to B. anthracis.
Although the PCR was found to be specific, our findings
support our assertion that reliance on a single assay
remains problematic due to the diverse nature of bacteria
and concerns of potential bioengineering.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
From a collection of more than 600 isolates initially identified as B. anthracis at the time of isolation and storage,
upon recovery, 23 isolates (4%) could not be definitively
identified or ruled out as B. anthracis and were therefore
further characterized in this study [Table 1]. With the
exception of one isolate that was collected in 1974
(2002721544), all isolates were collected in the 1950s
and 1960s. Source information was available for 10 isolates (9 environmental, 1 animal). The isolates were collected from five states throughout the U.S. and four
different countries on three different continents.
Susceptibility to lysis by gamma phage and hemolysis
One colony from each recovered isolate was inoculated
heavily onto half of a sheep blood agar (SBA) plate. Subsequently, a single line perpendicular to the previously
streaked area was streaked down the center of the plate.
The second half of the plate was streaked to yield a confluent lawn, leaving approximately 1 cm between the two
streaked halves. Each half of the SBA was inoculated with
5 µl of gamma phage. The plate then was marked to indicate where the phage was inoculated. The phage inoculum
was allowed to dry, and the plate was incubated at 37°C
for 18–24 h in ambient atmosphere. An isolate was considered susceptible to gamma phage lysis if there was a
clear or partial plaque (area with no growth) on the SBA
where the phage was inoculated. Gamma phage-resistant
isolates had confluent growth at the point of gamma
phage inoculation. Hemolysis of isolates was observed on
the SBA and recorded after 18–24 h. For both assays, B.

anthracis ATCC 4229 was used as a positive control, and B.
cereus ATCC 14579 was used as a negative control.
Real-time PCR
All isolates were assayed using the Laboratory Response
Network (LRN) real-time PCR assay for B. anthracis as
described by Hoffmaster et al., which targets three separate markers: the saspB gene on the B. anthracis chromosome, the pagA gene on pXO1, and the capA gene on
pXO2 [10]. The assays were performed on the Lightcycler
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) or the Smart Cycler
(Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) instruments. All three primer/
probe sets (targeting both B. anthracis virulence plasmids
and a chromosomal marker) were used.
Susceptibility to penicillin
A confluent lawn of growth was streaked onto an SBA
plate. One penicillin disk (10 U, Remel, Lenexa, KS) was
placed on the agar. The SBA was incubated at 37°C for 24
h in ambient atmosphere. B. cereus ATCC 14579 and the
B. anthracis ATCC 4229 were used as negative and positive
controls, respectively. Isolates observed with any zones of
inhibition were considered susceptible.

Sequencing was performed using the ABI BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ver 3.1 kit per manufacturer's instructions, with the exception of using 3 µl of BigDye with 1×
reaction buffer instead of 8 µl of BigDye alone (Applied
Biosystems). Sequencing products were purified using
Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). These sequencing products were resolved using
an ABI model 3100 automated DNA sequencing system
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analyzed using the
GCG Wisconsin package ver 10.1 (Accelrys, San Diego,
CA), MEGA ver 2.1 [21], and by querying the Bacillus
MLST database [22].

Multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA)
MLVA was performed as previously described by Keim et
al. [12]. Briefly, six chromosomal (vrrA, vrrB1, vrrB2,
vrrC1, vrrC2, CG3) and two plasmid (pXO1-aat, pXO2-at)
loci were amplified. Each amplicon was labeled with one
of three dyes and analyzed on an ABI 377 automated DNA
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). ABI
Genescan software (Applied Biosystems) was used to analyze gel images.

Multiple-locus sequence typing (MLST)
The MLST scheme described by Priest et al. was used in
this study with the following modifications [14]. Seven
housekeeping genes were sequenced: glpF, gmk, ilvD, pta,
pur, pycA, tpi. Amplification was performed using a Roche
Expand Hi Fidelity PCR System (Roche), with each reaction containing 200 µM dNTP mix, 0.4 µM of the forward
and reverse primers, 1× reaction buffer (with MgCl2), 1.25
units of Expand Polymerase, and 1 µl of template [10].
PCR was performed on an ABI 2400 or 9700 thermalcycler (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were first incubated
for 5 min at 95°C. Then 35 cycles were performed as follows: 15 sec at 94°C, 15 sec at the annealing temperatures
noted in Priest et al. [14], except for pta which was
annealed at 58°C, and extension for 1 min and 30 sec at
72°C. Reactions were then incubated at 72°C for an additional 5 min, with a final cooling to 4°C. PCR products
were purified with a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
