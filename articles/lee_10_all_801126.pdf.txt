Abstract
Background: The recent 2009 (H1N1) influenza A pandemic saw a rapid spread of the virus to essentially all parts
of the world. In the course of its evolution, the virus acquired many mutations, some of which have been
investigated in the context of increased severity due to high occurrences in fatal cases. For example, statements
such as: “42.9% of individuals who died from laboratory-confirmed cases of the pandemic (H1N1) were infected
with the hemagglutinin (HA) Q310 H mutant virus.” give the impression that HA-Q310 H would be highly
dangerous or important, while careful consideration of all available data suggests that this is unlikely to be the
case.
Results: We compare the mutations HA-Q310 H, PB2-K340N, HA-D239N and HA-D239G using whole genome
phylogenetic trees, structural modeling in their 3 D context and complete epidemiological data from sequences to
clinical outcomes. HA-Q310 H and PB2-K340N appear as isolated subtrees in the phylogenetic analysis pointing to
founder effects which is consistent with their clustered temporal appearance as well as the lack of an immediate
structural basis that could explain a change of phenotypes. Considering the prevailing viral genomic background,
shared origin of samples (all from the city of Sao Paulo) and narrow temporal window (all death case samples
within 1 month), it becomes clear that HA-Q310 H was actually a generally common mutation in the region at that
time which could readily explain its increased occurrence among the few analyzed fatal cases without requiring
necessarily an association with severity. In further support of this, we highlight 3 mild cases with the HA-Q310 H
mutation.
Conclusions: We argue that claims of severity of any current and future flu mutation need to be critically
considered in the light of phylogenetic, structural and detailed epidemiological data to distinguish increased
occurrence due to possible founder effects rather than real phenotypic changes.

Background
The problem of founder effects in the analysis of association of viral mutations with clinical phenotypes or fitness
of a virus originates from scenarios where initial random
mutations are rapidly proliferated in highly connected
transmission chains which result in a high occurrence of
these founder mutations without the necessity of a selection advantage. In other words, a genetic change common
to a small founder population will also be found in most

descendants. In viral outbreaks, founder effects can be at
play when specific mutations are enriched in samples
coming from the same region and same time. Considering
phylogenetic relations is useful to identify such viral lineage founder events [1-3] and the perspective of the mutations in protein structures relative to known functional
sites is of further help to discuss the possibility of altered
phenotypes [3,4]. In the case of the 2009 (H1N1) influenza
A pandemic, some mutations have received particular
attention due to their apparent increased occurrence in
severe cases. The best studied, HA-D239G, is also referred
to in the literature as D222G or D225G using alternative
(e.g. seasonal H1/H3) numberings. Although generally

rare, HA-D239G was found by several groups to appear
enriched in severe cases [5-9]. The conservative WHO
estimate suggested that this mutation was found in 7% of
all global death cases [9]. The same WHO report also
mentions HA-D239N and PB2-K340N as being under
investigation but with unknown clinical significance [9].
A separate study suggested HA-D239G and HA-Q310 H
to be associated with disease severity noting that “42.9% of
individuals who died from laboratory-confirmed cases of
the pandemic (H1N1) were infected with the hemagglutinin (HA) Q310 H mutant virus” [10].
Here, we analyze the phylogenetic distribution and
structural positioning of HA-Q310 H, PB2-K340N, HAD239N and HA-D239G to identify possible biases through
founder effects and further discuss the mutations in their
structural context and temporal appearance.

Methods
Naturally occurring pandemic 2009 (H1N1) influenza A
viral sequences that were submitted between 30 March
2009 to 31 May 2010 were downloaded from the NCBI
Influenza Virus Resource [11]. A total of 3588 viral
strains were analyzed. The sequences for each protein
were aligned with MAFFT [12] and substitutions in
positions of all 10 proteins for all 3588 strains were
identified relative to reference strain A/Texas/04/2009
as it was one of the first submitted strains with
sequence information available for all viral genes that
most closely resembles the rest of the circulating H1N1
strains during the first week of sequence submission.
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on all strains with
full-length nucleotide sequences available for all 8 segments. The protein coding nucleotide sequences for
these strains were concatenated such that a single
sequence representing a single strain contains nucleotides for all 10 proteins. These sequences were aligned
with MAFFT [12] using the FFT-NS-1 option. Cd-hit
[13] was used to remove highly similar sequences by
allowing a maximal sequence identity of 99.94% to
reduce the set to 727 non-redundant strains. Next, we
created a maximum likelihood tree using PhyML [14]
with the approximate likelihood ratio test, the HKY85
substitution model and other parameters such as for the
shape of the gamma distribution (0.353) were estimated
by the program. The major strain lineages and substitutions discussed in this analysis were identified and
marked in the resulting phylogenetic tree using the
MEGA 4 package [15].
To assess the overall extent of clustering for the mutations of interest in the phylogenetic tree, we computed
the association index (AI) [16], parsimony score (PS)
[17] and the monophyletic clade (MC) size statistics
using BaTS (Bayesian tip-association significance testing)
[18]. The BaTS program examines a posterior sample of

Page 2 of 7

trees generated by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST v1.6.0
(Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) [19].
The input alignment was the same as described above.
The mean substitution rate was estimated using the
HKY substitution model, a strict molecular clock, and a
constant population size coalescent prior. A chain
length of 10 million generations was performed to
ensure that all parameters had achieved stabilization, as
assessed by the program TRACER v1.5.0 http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/. The posterior trees were
sampled every 1,000 generations and the maximum likelihood tree generated from PHYML was used as a starting tree. The BaTS program is then performed with
1,000 replications and with the first 1,000 sampled trees
removed as burn-in.
To observe the emerging trends of the substitutions
HA-K2E, HA-Q310 H, PB2-K340N, HA-D239N and
HA-D239G, the number of strains carrying these 5 substitutions was recorded according to their collection
date. A window period of 28 days was used to estimate
the average percentage of observing a particular substitution, over the total number of strains with sequence
information at the position of the substitution. Since the
first sample collected falls on 30 March 2009, the first
data point in the percentage-time graph, which represents an average percentage of the substitution over the
past 28 days, will be on 26 April 2009. As there are relatively much fewer sequences available from February
2010, inclusion of data from this date forward will result
in unreliable fluctuations. Hence, data points from February 2010 onwards were not included in this percentage-time graph analysis.
The structural mapping of the mutations is based on
the crystal structure of 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinin (PDB:
3LZG) [20] modeled with a human host cell receptor
analogue (LSTC) as well as a homology model of polymerase basic protein 2 using PDB: 2VQZ [21] as template. Modelling and visualization of structures was
done with Yasara [22].
Sequencing methodology (by Instituto Adolfo Lutz):
Viral RNA was extracted either from clinical samples or
supernatant fluid from MDCK infected cells using the
QIAmp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA, US) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
viral RNA extraction from necropsy tissues the QIAmp
Blood Viral RNA Extraction Kit was used instead. Primers
designed to amplify the complete HA gene sequence as
well as the RT-PCR amplification and sequencing protocols were those provided by WHO http://www.who.int/
csr/resources/publications/swineflu/sequencing_primers/
en/index.html. RT-PCR products were directly sequenced
using the “ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster

Results and Discussion
Our whole coding genome maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 2009 (H1N1) influenza A strains (Figure
1, see also Materials and Methods) is in good agreement
with previous studies [2,23,24]. We see early diversification into clades from Mexico and California which are
superseded by a dominant clade (corresponding to clade
number 7 in Nelson et al. and Valli et al.) that further
evolves with characteristic marker mutations (e.g. HA
S220T). Also, the known time stamps of samples follow

the phylogenetic groupings and approximate order in
the tree. When comparing the distribution of the mutations of interest, we see clearly distinct patterns where
HA-Q310 H and PB2-K340N are each confined to
monophyletic clusters suggestive of founder effects
while HA-D239G is not restricted to a monophyletic
group but rather occurred several times independently
in strains that are not closely related and is, hence, not
likely to associated with founder effects. Only few strains
are available with HA-D239N, however, they seem to
resemble more closely the scattered distribution of HAD239G.
This phylogenetic clustering is further supported by
the temporal global appearance of the mutations, with
HA-Q310 H and PB2-K340N being predominantly
restricted to continuous time periods whereas HAD239G independently re-occurred several times during
the pandemic (Figure 2).

respective mutation.

Indeed, although HA-D239G is generally rare, it was
found in 7% of all global death cases [9]. It has also
been shown to alter the biology of the virus [25] and
may be rationally associated with severity by switching
host cell receptor specificity (Figure 3). HA-D239N has
also been found with increased incidence in severe cases
[7] and could similarly affect the host cell recognition
properties. HA-Q310 H, on the other hand, is located
far from the receptor binding pocket and no direct biomolecular mechanism is known yet for this position that
could support a change in severity (Figure 3).
The same applies to PB2-K340N which is at a structural position where the mutated sidechain is pointing
away from the functionally important cap binding site of
the PB2 5’ cap snatching domain (Figure 3). The mutation is not in close vicinity (within 5 Angstroem) of PB1
or PA in any currently known structure. 8 of 123 strains
with PB2-K340N and HA sequence information in Genbank also have the HA-D239G mutation. These 8 cases
are strongly biased in their geographic occurrence with 7
coming from Russia. PB2-K340N is being investigated for
its occurrence in severe cases [9] but given its temporal
(Figure 2), geographical and phylogenetic (Figure 1) clustering, it could be that this higher incidence may be

associated to founder effects rather than direct phenotypic changes.
The particular case of disease severity association of
HA-Q310 H was proposed by Glinsky [10] based in part
on the analysis of 7 Brazilian fatal cases where 3 of them
had the HA-Q310 H mutation (GenBank:GQ414768,
GenBank:GQ915019, GenBank:GQ915020), 2 had the
HA-D239N mutation (GenBank:GQ915021, GenBank:
GQ915020 [also has HA-Q310H]) and 2 had the HAD239G mutation (GenBank:GQ915017, GenBank:
GQ915018). Here, we add the clinical information for
two more Brazilian cases with HA-Q310H: one more
fatal case (GenBank:GQ915025) as well as a mild case
(GenBank:GQ368664). The existence of mild cases with
this mutation is important as it shows that the individual
outcome depends on additional patient-specific factors.
HA-Q310 H also occurred in two Singaporean samples
(GenBank:CY049659, GenBank:CY049284)[26] for which
clinical information is available and both cases were mild.
In total, 18 out of 47 Brazilian HA sequences (38%)
were found to have the Q310 H mutation, while globally
this applied to only 160 out of 3240 HA sequences (5%)
over the timeframe analyzed (Apr 2009 - Jan 2010).
Although HA-Q310 H occurred in 4 of the 8 (50%)

HA-D239G and HA-D239N appear in a position that can be rationalized to directly alter the phenotypic properties of the virus.

Brazilian death cases from July and early August, this is
similar to its overall occurrence in Brazil at that time
(53-57%, Figure 4). Considering the prevailing viral genomic background, shared origin of samples (all 8 from the
city of Sao Paulo) and narrow temporal window (all
death case samples within 1 month), it becomes clear
that HA-Q310 H was actually a generally common mutation in the region at that time which could readily explain
its increased occurrence among these analyzed cases due

world. Clearly, HA-Q310 H appeared more frequently in Brazil in the
months July and August which was the exact time frame of the
analyzed death cases.

to founder effects without requiring necessarily an association with severity.
Additionally, it was noted [10] that HA-Q310 H cooccurred with a specific genotype on position HA 220.
Indeed, HA-S220T has already been recognized as typical marker mutation of different phases of the outbreak
likely due to founder effects (Figure 1)[2,27,28]. Further
analysis of the strains with HA-Q310 H reveals that
most of them also contain another mutation, HA-K2E,
which was therefore also included in the analysis.
Indeed, 3 of the 4 fatal Brazilian cases with HA-Q310 H
also had HA-K2E. Again, due to its close phylogenetic
clustering, almost exclusive co-occurrence with HAQ310 H (Figure 1) as well as strong temporal correlation with HA-Q310 H (Figure 2), HA-K2E likely
appeared more frequently during that period due to
founder effects rather than being phenotypically
important.
Finally, in order to estimate the statistical significance
and quantify the extent of phylogenetic clustering of the
discussed mutations, we computed the association index
(AI) [16], parsimony score (PS) [17] and the monophyletic clade (MC) size statistics using BaTS (Bayesian tipassociation significance testing) [18] over a posterior
sample of trees generated by BEAST [19]. As shown in
Table 1, the AI and PS index ratios of the mutations HAD239G and HA-D239N approach 1. This confirms their
sporadic and clade-independent nature in the phylogeny.
On the other hand, the index ratios and monophyletic
clade size statistics indicated that the 3 mutations HAK2E, PB2-K340N and HA-Q310 H were more likely to

Conclusions
The interpretation of effects of mutations on observed
patient phenotypes is notoriously difficult. Besides
underlying conditions of the patient, factors as simple as
delayed admission to hospital may have a strong influence on disease outcome. Often, only one or two genes
of each patient’s viral strain but not the complete genome sequence are available, and hence the full spectrum
of mutations for each case is rarely known, though this
is changing now with the advent of new sequencing
technologies. Overrepresentation of certain mutations
among geographically and temporally related samples
needs to be carefully controlled for possible founder
effects which could be identified as homogenous clusters
in phylogenetic analyses, as was observed to be the case
for HA-Q310 H and PB2-K340N but not HA-D239N or
HA-D239G. While founder effect mutations cannot
automatically be linked to phenotypes simply by
increased occurrence, they may nevertheless alter the
virus fitness for which even tiny changes could result in
advantages shifting selection to their favor. This, however, requires thorough experimental testing and careful
consideration of their structural roles and phylogenetic
relationships. Another problem is the natural bias of
sequencing severe cases disproportionally more than
mild cases. Therefore, a seemingly high percentage of a
mutation among severe cases needs to be viewed in the
context of the general viral genomic background in the
same region and time frame as the samples.
