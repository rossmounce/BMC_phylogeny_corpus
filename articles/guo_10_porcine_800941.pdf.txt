Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2): genetic variation
and newly emerging genotypes in China

Abstract
Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting
syndrome (PMWS), is a serious economic problem for the swine industry in China. In this study, we investigated
the genetic variation of PCV2 in China using strains isolated from 2004-2008. Viruses were isolated from samples
collected from pigs with multi-systemic lesions and clinical signs of PMWS from different regions of China, and the
genomes of these viruses were sequenced. The assembled sequences were used to define the genotypes of these
strains; PCR-RFLP methodology was used to distinguish isolates and capture ELISA was used to demonstrate the
antigenic changes resulted from ORF2 gene mutation of the isolates.
Results: We identified 19 PCV2 isolates, including four newly emerging PCV2 mutant strains. The 19 isolates were
designated into three genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d). PCV2d represented a novel genotype and a shift from
PCV2a to PCV2b as the predominant genotype in China was identified. This is the first report of 1766 nt PCV2
harboring a base deletion at other new different positions. Amino acid sequence analysis identified two novel
ORF2 mutations (resulting in ORF2 sequences 705 and 708 nt in length) in three deletion strains (1766 nt) and one
strain with a genome 1767 nt in length. Finding of two amino acids elongation of the ORF2-encoded Cap protein
is firstly observed among PCV2 strains all over the world. The isolates were distinguished into different genotypes
by PCR-RFLP methodology and antigenic changes were present in Cap protein of mutation isolates by capture
ELISA.
Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2 is undergoing constant genetic variation and
that the predominant strain in China as well as the antigenic situation has changed in recent years. Furthermore,
the PCR-RFLP method presented here may be useful for the differential identification of PCV2 strains in future
studies.

Background
Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent
of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome
(PMWS). This disease was first confirmed in Canada in
1997, and was then subsequently identified in pigs in
the USA, France, Japan, Korea and other countries [1,2].
In recent years, PMWS has become a serious economic
problem for the swine industry in China. PCV2 is a
member of the genus Circovirus, of the family Circoviridae, the smallest non-enveloped, single-stranded,
circular DNA viruses that replicate autonomously in

mammalian cells. The viral DNA of PCV2, encapsulated
by a single viral protein, is a single-stranded negative
sense circularized molecule of 1767-1768 nucleotides
(nt) [3-5]. Its genome contains two major open reading
frames (ORFs), ORF1 which encodes two replicationassociated proteins (Rep and Rep') and ORF2 which
encodes a viral capsid protein (Cap) involved in the host
immune response [6]. Besides PMWS, PCV2 infection
has been linked with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), reproductive failure, granulomatous
enteritis, necrotizing lymphadenitis, exudative epidermitis and congenital tremors [7-14]. The pathogenesis of
PMWS caused by PCV2 remains to be fully elucidated.
However, PCV2 pathogenicity is thought to be mediated
by the interaction of this virus with the host immune

system. The immune response to PCV2 infection and
the subsequent immunological suppression of the host
have been subjects of investigation in recent years
[15-18].
A recent report into the genetic variation of PCV2
identified nine different genotypes in clinical tissue specimens collected from pigs in different regions of China
between 2001 and 2003, by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the ORF2
region. The results indicated that mutations existed in
the genome of the predominant PCV2 strain in pigs in
China [19]. Previous investigations by Fenaux et al. [20]
suggested that the genome sequence of PCV2 strains
differed depending on the area of isolation. Recently,
Dupont et al. [21] showed that the genome sequence of
PCV2 was not directly correlated to its pathogenicity,
and they reported a strain with a genome of 1766 nt.
Since 2003, variation has been reported in the predominant genotypes of PCV2 worldwide, and genotype
PCV2b was thought to be the most prevalent form
showing enhanced pathogenicity. Mutations were also
reported in PCV2 strains in Korea [22]. In 2005, Knell
et al. reported elongation in the Cap protein as a result
of a single nucleotide deletion in the genome [23].
Olvera et al. [24] also reported a mutation within the
ORF2 gene, which resulted in elongation of the Cap
protein.
Recently, to address the current scientific confusion
on genotype names, the EU consortium on porcine circovirus diseases http://www.pcvd.net proposed a unified
nomenclature for PCV2 genotypes. The consortium proposed naming the three PCV2 genotypes: PCV2a,
PCV2b and PCV2c. Using this system, ORF2 sequences
of PCV2 are assigned to different genotypes when the
genetic distance between them is at least 0.035 [25].
PCV2 mutations are monitored and reported worldwide, however, there have been few reports [19,26] of
the genetic variation of PCV2 in China. The aim of this
study was to determine the genetic variation of PCV2 in
China using strains isolated from 2004-2008 from
PMWS-affected herds (cases). This information may
provide a valuable insight into the molecular epidemiology and pathogenic mechanisms of PCV2 infection, as
well as strategies for the prevention and control of this
virus. We also established a PCR- and RFLP-based
method to differentiate different genetic isolates in the
field.

Materials and methods
Sample collection

A total of 90 samples were collected from unthrifty pigs
(ranging from 1 to 3 months of age) with multi-systemic
lesions and clinical signs of PMWS in different regions
of China from 2004-2008. The geographical origin, year

Page 2 of 12

of sample collection, age, clinical history, organs/tissue
type and the number of samples are summarized in
Table 1. The samples were used for DNA extraction
and PCR. A PCV2 reference strain (LG) was also maintained in our laboratory and used in this study [27].
Virus isolation

Ninety samples were analyzed by PCR for the presence
of PCV2. To isolate PCV2, positive samples were freezethawed three times, fragmented and centrifuged. Filtered
supernatants were inoculated onto porcine kidney PK15 cells, free of PCV1 contamination. The PK-15 cells
were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in minimum
essential medium (MEM) (Gibco BRL, USA) and 5%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL).
PCV2 was isolated from the culture supernatants and
the isolates were then analyzed by PCR and an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) to confirm the presence of PCV2.
PCR amplification of genomic DNA

The purified PCV2 genomic DNA was PCR amplified
using the primer pairs: PCV2-F (920-946 nt; 5"-ATCCACGGAGGAAGGGGGCCAGTT-3”) and PCV2-R
(925-901 nt; 5"-GTGGATTGTTCTGTAGCATTCTTCCA-3”). PCR reactions (25 μl) contained 5 μl of KOD
DNA polymerase reaction buffer (TOYOBO Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Japan), 0.1 mM of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate, 0.4 μM of each primer, 1 μl (1 unit) of
KOD-Plus-Ver.2 high fidelity DNA polymerase
(TOYOBO Biotechnology Co. Ltd.) and 100 ng of purified DNA. PCR was performed on a thermocycler under
the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35
cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 61°C and 2 min at 72°C,
and a final step of 10 min at 72°C.
Cloning of the viral genome

To isolate PCV2 DNA, viral isolates were freeze-thawed
three times and then centrifuged. The supernatant was
then used as a template for PCR amplification of the
PCV2 geneome as previously described. Amplicon products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen, Germany), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Prior to cloning of the purified DNA fragment, an A tail was added to the 3” terminus of the
amplicon by incubation of 12.5 μl of Premix Taq Hot
start version mixture (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd.,
China) with 12.5 μl of purified PCR product at 72°C for
30 min. The amplicon with an A tail was then purified
using the QIAquick PCR purification kit, cloned into the
pMD18 T vector system (TaKaRa) and transformed into
Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells. The resulting
colonies were screened according to the manufacturers’
instructions. Positive colonies were detected using the

PCR protocol described above, except that the first denaturation step was performed at 94°C for 10 min. Plasmid
DNA was extracted using the Axygen Plasmid Miniprep
Kit (AXYGEN Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China) according
the manufacturers’ instructions and recombinant plasmids were identified by restriction enzyme analysis with
Sal Ⅰ/Xba Ⅰ.
DNA sequencing of the cloned PCV2 genomic DNA and
sequence analysis

Plasmids from ten different colonies per strain were
selected for sequencing at a commercial facility (Sangon
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China), and both strands of the
insert were sequenced at least twice, using the M13 universal primers. The sequences of the DNA fragments were
then assembled using DNAMAN software (Version 5.2.2,
Lynnon Biosoft, 1994). Then, multiple alignments of
nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalW within the DNASTAR software
(version 7.0). MEGA version 4 was used with Kimura’s
two parameter correction method to align the sequences,
estimate nucleotide distances and diversities (mean

nucleotide distances between genotypes and within genotypes) and assess the phylogenetic relationships by the
neighbor-joining method using 1000 bootstrap replicates
and the 19 strains isolated in this study, together with 154
PCV2 strains deposited in the GenBank database.
PCR-RFLP analysis of virus isolates

PCR was performed as described above and PCR products were digested with 1 U of the restriction enzymes
AccⅠand FbaⅠ (TaKaRa), in a volume of 30 μl for 4 h at
37°C. The digestion products were then separated by
electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels.
Reactivity of the 19 isolates with monoclonal antibody
1D2 by capture ELISA

Mice were immunized with 250 μg of purified PCV2
recombinant Cap (PCV2-rCap) protein, prepared by the
baculovirus expression system and monoclonal antibody
(mAb) 1D2, was prepared using the lymphocyte hybridoma technique. The mAb ascites titers reached
1:2,048,000, the mAb isotype was IgG2a and the mAb
light chain was  chain for mAb 1D2. Western blot

analysis showed that mAb 1D2 was not able to react with
native PCV2-Cap protein, but it was able to react with
PCV2 via IPMA and antigen capture ELISA, and could
be differentiated with PCV1 under the same conditions.
The mAb 1D2 was shown by a neutralization test to neutralize PCV2 (data not shown). For the antigen capture
ELISA, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with swine
anti-PCV2 positive sera (1:100 dilution) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight, and were then
blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 3 h. After blocking,
the plates were washed three times with PBST (PBS with
0.1% Tween 20). In the binding assay, plates were incubated with the culture supernatant of the 19 isolates
(104.5TCID50/ml), respectively, at 37°C for 1 h, followed
by three washes with PBST. Bound isolates were detected
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled 1D2 mAb
(the neutralizing mAb of mouse anti-PCV2 Cap). Then,
100 μl of 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic
acid (ABTS) was added and after 30 min the reaction was
stopped with 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance at 405 nm
was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA).

DNA sequencing of the cloned viral genomes

Results
Virus isolation and identification

Of the 90 samples, 42 samples (46.7%) were PCV2 PCR
positive (data not shown). Nineteen PCV2 strains were
isolated from the PCV2 PCR positive samples (Table 1)
and they were confirmed as PCV2 by PCR, an antigenbased IPMA (Figure 1) and Immune electron (Figure 2).
Cloning of the genomic DNA from the virus isolates

The full-length PCV2 PCR products amplified from the
DNA extracted from the virus-infected cells were
inserted into the pMD18-T vector. Plasmid DNA was
then extracted from transformed cells and digested with
SalI and XbaI. Two bands of the expected sizes were
obtained for each strain, indicating that the genomes of
the 19 PCV2 strains had been successfully cloned into
the vectors.

Ten positive recombinant plasmids were selected for
each isolated strain, and the DNA sequencing data
obtained using the M13 universal primers revealed
that there was 95.3-100% similarity at the nucleotide
level among the genomes of the 19 strains. The strains
were categorized into three types groups depending on
the length of their genome: three (15.8%) strains had a
genome of 1766 nt, 14 (73.7%) strains had a genome
of 1767 nt and two (10.5%) strains had a genome 1768
nt in length (Table 1). These 19 sequences were submitted to the GenBank database and assigned accession numbers HM038016 to HM038034. The
sequencing results indicated that the predominant
PCV2 strain in China had a genome of 1767 nt. Three
additional strains with a genome of 1766 nt (with one
deleted base) were isolated. There was no clinical history associated with these PCV2 sequences and the

included as a positive control and PK15 cells were used as a negative control.

pathogenicity associated with these strains warrants
further investigation.
Designation of genotypes

The genotypes of the genomic sequences of the 19 isolated strains were designated according to the method
of Grau et al. [25]. Two strains belonged to the PCV2a
genotype, 14 strains belonged to the PCV2b genotype
and three strains belonged to the PCV2d genotype,
accounting for 10.5%, 73.7% and 15.8% of the isolated
strains, respectively (Table 1).
Mutation analysis of the PCV2 genome sequences

Sequence comparisons between the 19 strains revealed
that three strains had a single base deletion and therefore represented a new mutant strain of PCV2 with a
genome 1766 nt in length. More detailed sequence analysis using the DNASTAR software showed that two
strains (AH and MDJ), with genomes 1766 nt in length,
had a single base deletion (C) at position 39, while the
other strain (YJ) had a single base deletion (G) at position 1039. In addition, two strains (LG and CL), with
genomes 1768 nt in length, were found to possess a
base insertion (T) at position 1040 (Figure 3).
Amino acid sequence analysis of the putative ORF2encoded Cap protein

The 19 ORF2-encoded Cap protein sequences were relatively conserved, although a few mutations existed (Figure 4). Important mutations located in the C terminus
of the Cap protein are indicated by the red circle in Figure 4. Strain YJ showed an elongation of two amino
acids (Asn and Glu), and strains AH, BDH and MDJ
showed an elongation of one amino acid (Lys) compared
with the PCV2a isolations. Analysis of the ORF2 gene in
the 19 strains indicated a one-base deletion at position
1039 in the genome of strain YJ, resulting in an ORF2
gene of 708 nt. While in strains AH, BDH and MDJ, a
stop codon mutation in the ORF2 resulted in an ORF2
gene of 705 nt (Figure 5). ORF2 gene was elongated by
one or two codons due to the deletion and mutation
mentioned above.
Construction of the phylogenetic tree

Sequence analysis was carried out on the genomes of the
19 PCV2 strains using the MEGA 4 software, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the sequences could be divided
into three genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d) and
the PCV2b genotype strains were subdivided into two
clusters, which accounted for 71.4% and 28.6% of the
PCV2b genotype strains respectively (Figure 6). The phylogenetic tree constructed using the 19 sequenced strains,
together with 156 sequences previously deposited in

Figure 3 Sequence alignment of a fragment of the genomic
sequence of the 19 PCV2 isolates. Alignments were performed
using the DNA Star 6.0 software. The red boxes indicate the
position of three mutations: a one base deletion at position 39 (AH
and MDJ) and 1039 (YJ). An insertion mutation of one base (T) at
position 1040 is also shown.

GenBank (including sequences reported in Zhou et al.,
[26] and Wang et al., [28] as well as reference sequences
for different PCV2 genotypes found at http://www.pcvd.
net/) is shown in Figure 7. The 175 sequences included
in this analysis can also be divided into three genotypes
(PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2c), together with another genotype designated PCV2d in this study. Genotype PCV2d
viruses are reported not only in this study but also in
Wang et al. demonstrating that this new genotype is prevalent in China [28]. Of the 19 strains isolated in this
study, the majority belonged to genotype PCV2b (73.7%),
indicating that genotype PCV2b viruses are the predominant genotype circulating in China. The genomic distances between the genotypes ranged from 0.0411 to
0.0637. Within genotypes, the average genomic distances

ranged from 0.0100 (PCV2c) to 0.0293 (PCV2a). The
PCV2d isolates identified in this study with an amino
acid elongation in the C terminus of the Cap protein,
formed a separate branch from other Chinese isolates of
the PCV2d genotype. Two PCV2a isolates identified in

this study were separated from other Chinese PCV2a isolates, being located in a mixed branch with isolates from
Taiwan, Japan and Europe. This indicated that a new
PCV2 cluster was present within the PCV2a genotypes
(Figure 7).

bp) encoding the capsid protein in the 19 isolates, using the

in the stop codon in four isolates (YJ, AH, MDJ and BDH) resulted in
elongation of the ORF by one codon, and a one base deletion in
isolate YJ at position 1039 led to a two-codon elongation of the
ORF.

Characterization of the isolates by PCR-RFLP

Genomic PCR amplification products from the 19 isolated PCV2 strains were characterized by digestion with
restriction enzymes FbaⅠand AccⅠ, and analysis of the
resulting electrophoretic patterns. Four strains (JF, WF,
CF and MZL) forming a single cluster in the genotype
PCV2b isolates were differentiated from the remaining
strains by digestion with the restriction enzyme
FbaⅠ(Figure 8A), while strains from genotypes PCV2a
and PCV2d, and the remaining PCV2b strains, were
identified by digestion with AccⅠ(Figure 8B). These
results correlated with the phylogenetic tree analysis,
indicating that analysis via PCR-RFLP using two restriction enzymes, could be an effective method for differentiation of PCV2 isolates in the field.
Identification of antigenic differences between the 19
isolates

Antigen capture ELISA using mAb 1D2 showed that all
isolates had strong reactivity with this mAb, except for
isolate YJ (PCV2b), and isolates AH, MDJ and BDH
(PCV2d). These results indicated that viruses of the
PCV2d genotype were not recognized by mAb 1D2, and
that mutation of the ORF2 gene resulted in antigenic
changes within the PCV2 Cap protein (Figure 9).

Discussion
Disease caused by PCV2 infection has increased in
severity in China in recent years, resulting in increased
morbidity and mortality in swine and significant economic losses in the swine industry. Genetic variation
among PCV2 isolates has been reported by researchers
worldwide in recent years [17,19,21,24]. A novel PCVlike agent was first isolated from pig sera in China [29],
but few studies have since been performed on PCV2
genetic variation in China. Studies are therefore required
which investigate PCV2 variation in pigs in China and
assess the most prevalent PCV2 genotypes, to facilitate
prevention and control of PCV2-induced disease.
Of the 19 isolates analyzed in this study, two strains of
the PCV2a genotype were separated from other Chinese
PCV2a genotypes on the phylogenetic tree, and were
located in a new mixed branch along with strains from
Taiwan, Japan and Europe. The occurrence of these two
distinct PCV2a genotype strains indicated that either
foreign PCV2 viruses had entered China via international trade/travel, or that these strains had resulted
from the same evolutionary events occurring in different
regions of the world simultaneously. In this study, we
also identified the existence of a novel genotype, PCV2d,
in China among 12 formerly isolated strains and three
new isolates (this study). These 15 isolates all carried
the same mutated ORF2 gene of 705 bp in length,
except for two of the formerly isolated strains (GenBank
no. DQ151643 and DQ322701), and further investigations are required to determine the potential relationship between this mutation and pathogenicity of the
viruses.
Previous investigations have shown that the genomes
of PCV2 viruses are usually 1767 or 1768 nt in length,
however, strains (GenBank no. EU148507 and
EU257516) with a genome of 1766 nt have also been
reported [21,30]. In this study, a phylogenetic tree constructed from the 19 isolates identified in this study and
the 156 strains submitted to GenBank (GenBank no. are
shown in Figure 7) indicated that the gene deletion
strain (GenBank no. EU148507) isolated in Denmark
belonged to genotype PCV2a and it was genetically similar to the genotype PCV2a strains, suggesting that it
may have evolved from a strain harboring a genome of
1768 nt. The gene deletion sequence (GenBank no.
EU257516) of the 1766 nt genome strain previously
reported by Shang et al. [30], belonged to genotype
PCV2b and was genetically similar to the genotype
PCV2b strains, suggesting that it may be evolved from
the 1767 nt genome strain (Figure 7). By sequence alignments and analysis, it was found that the positions of
base deletions differed among strains with genomes of
1766 nt. A deletion (C) was found at position 39 in the

Figure 6 Phylogenetic analysis of the 19 PCV2 isolates. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 4 software after alignment of
the full-length sequences. The PCV2 genomes were mainly assigned to three genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d). PCV2b was subdivided into
two clusters and PCV2d represented a newly emerging genotype in China. The percentage of strains in each genotype or cluster is indicated at
the corresponding positions. The results showed that the PCV2b genotype of PCV2 is predominant in China, which was compatible with reports
of a shift from PCV2a to PCV2b.

strain with a genome of 1767 nt, while a deletion (G)
was found at position 1039 in the genome of another
strain (YJ). In contrast, a deletion (G) was found at position 1060 in the genome of the strain reported by Shang
et al [30]. (GenBank no. EU257516), and two deletions
(T) were found at positions 1002 and 1003 in the genome of the Denmark strain (GenBank no. EU148507).
So, in our study, we isolated 3 strains with 1766 nt in
genomic length harboring a base deletion at different
positions from other reports [21,30] in genome, and
other reports [19,28,31] only reported common strains
with a genome of 1767 nt or 1768 nt. Although the sites

of deletion mutations varied among strains, these results
suggested that mutations occur frequently in the epidemic strains of PCV2. Further studies are now required
to investigate whether these kinds of gene mutations are
associated with viral pathogenicity.
The Cap protein, encoded by ORF2, is the major structural protein of PCV2 and the major protective antigen.
It is relatively conserved, but a few mutations have been
identified in this gene in recent years, and were also identified in this study. An elongation of one or two amino
acids was found in the C terminus of the Cap protein due
to alteration of the ORF2 gene in three 1766 nt genome
strains (AH, MDJ and YJ) and one strain with a genome
of 1767 nt (BDH). Knell et al. [23] had previously

submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers for these strains are indicated and some branches in the tree are collapsed in the form of
black triangles, followed by their corresponding accession numbers. The tree was constructed using a neighbor-joining algorithm with the MEGA
4 software. Three main genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2c), along with a newly emerging genotype PCV2d, were identified by multiple
alignments, and PCV2b was subdivided into two clusters. Genotype PCV2b was predominant among strains in China. Three PCV2d isolates from
this study form a single branch, marked by a red box. Two PCV2a isolates from this study (marked by a pink circle) were separated from the
other Chinese PCV2a isolates and were instead located at a mixed branch with strains from Taiwan, Japan and Europe (underlined in green).

reported that mutations could occur in the ORF2 gene
since a deletion (T) was found at position 1042 in the
1767-nt genome of a strain (GenBank no. AY713470),
which led to a one amino acid elongation of lysine in the
C terminus of ORF2-coded Cap protein. Olvera et al.
[24] also reported elongation by one lysine (K) residue of
the C terminus of the Cap protein in a mutation in the
stop codon of the ORF2. Similarly, in this study, an elongation of one lysine (K) residue was identified in the C
terminus of the Cap protein in three strains (AH, MDJ
and BDH) due to a mutation in the stop codon of the
ORF2. Besides, in the study, we first reported a 1766 nt
strain (YJ) with a ORF2 of 708 nt all over the world. The
ORF2 gene of the strain was mutated since a deletion
was found at position 1039 of the genome, which led to
the elongation of two amino acids (N and E) at the C terminus of the ORF2-encoded Cap protein. This finding of
two amino acids elongation of the ORF2-encoded Cap
protein is firstly observed among PCV2 strains all over
the world (the rescued PCV2 based on the genome
sequence of YJ strain has also obtained by infectious
molecular clone, data not show). The two amino acids
elongation finding also proved that PCV2 underwent variations frequently. Besides, strain YJ, BDH, AH and MDJ
showed no reactivity with the neutralizing mAb against
PCV2 Cap protein, indicating changes in the antigenic
epitopes expressed on the Cap protein (Figure 9). The
relationship between deletion mutations and changes in
the antigenicity, pathogenicity and virulence of viruses,
warrants further investigation.
A PCR-RFLP method was established in this study for
the genotyping of PCV2 epidemic strains which could

Page 11 of 12

be used to identify genotypes and clusters of strains.
Former report about PCR-RFLP for PCV2 only got the
differences between different strains, but can’t distinguish the strains into different genotypes. So, in this
study, the method used only two enzymes (FbaⅠ and
AccⅠ) to identify the different genotypes of PCV2 in the
field, which seems more simple and useful than the
method reported by Wen et al [19]. The enzymes FbaⅠ
and AccⅠ were used and the results correlated with the
results of the phylogenetic tree (with the exception of
strain JMS), providing a simple and effective method for
genotyping and identifying epidemic strains of PCV2.
The appearance of strain JMS also suggested that PCV2
strains are acquiring ongoing mutations. In summary,
we have identified four different PCV2 genotypes circulating in China. PCV2d represented a novel genotype
and we report a shift from PCV2a to PCV2b as the predominant genotype. We also constructed a simple PCRRFLP based method to genotype and identify PCV2
strains. Besides, antigenic differences were identified
between isolates by mAb 1D2.

Conclusion
Taken together, we identified 19 PCV2 isolates, including
four newly emerging PCV2 mutant strains. The 19 isolates were designated into three genotypes (PCV2a,
PCV2b and PCV2d). PCV2d represented a novel genotype and a shift from PCV2a to PCV2b as the predominant genotype in China was identified. This is the first
report of PCV2 harboring a base deletion at other new
different positions in 1766 nt strains. In this study, finding of two amino acids elongation of the ORF2-encoded

Figure 9 Reactivity of the 19 isolates with mAb 1D2. All isolates showed strong reactivity with mAb 1D2 except the YJ isolate (PCV2b) and
the PCV2d genotype isolates (AH, MDJ and BDH), indicating that viruses of the PCV2d genotype are not recognized by mAb 1D2 and that the
ORF2 mutation in strains of this genotype results in antigenic changes in the PCV2 Cap protein.

Cap protein is firstly observed among PCV2 strains all
over the world. Amino acid sequence analysis identified
two novel ORF2 mutations (resulting in ORF2 sequences
705 and 708 nt in length) in three (1766 nt) deletion
strains and one strain with a genome 1767 nt in length.
In addition, mutation of the ORF2 gene resulted in antigenic changes within the PCV2 Cap protein by using the
mAb 1D2 in capture ELISA assay. This indicated that different genotypes as well as newly emerging PCV2 were
present with antigenic difference of Cap protein, that is
the main structural protein of PCV2.
