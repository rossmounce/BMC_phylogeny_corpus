Abstract
Background: A wide variety of stabilizing factors have been invoked so far to elucidate the
structural basis of protein thermostability. These include, amongst the others, a higher number of
ion-pairs interactions and hydrogen bonds, together with a better packing of hydrophobic residues.
It has been frequently observed that packing of hydrophobic side chains is improved in
hyperthermophilic proteins, when compared to their mesophilic counterparts. In this work,
protein crystal structures from hyper/thermophilic organisms and their mesophilic homologs have
been compared, in order to quantify the difference of apolar contact area and to assess the role
played by the hydrophobic contacts in the stabilization of the protein core, at high temperatures.
Results: The construction of two datasets was carried out so as to satisfy several restrictive
criteria, such as minimum redundancy, resolution and R-value thresholds and lack of any structural
defect in the collected structures. This approach allowed to quantify with relatively high precision
the apolar contact area between interacting residues, reducing the uncertainty due to the position
of atoms in the crystal structures, the redundancy of data and the size of the dataset. To identify
the common core regions of these proteins, the study was focused on segments that conserve a
similar main chain conformation in the structures analyzed, excluding the intervening regions
whose structure differs markedly. The results indicated that hyperthermophilic proteins
underwent a significant increase of the hydrophobic contact area contributed by those residues
composing the alpha-helices of the structurally conserved regions.
Conclusion: This study indicates the decreased flexibility of alpha-helices in proteins core as a
major factor contributing to the enhanced termostability of a number of hyperthermophilic
proteins. This effect, in turn, may be due to an increased number of buried methyl groups in the
protein core and/or a better packing of alpha-helices with the rest of the structure, caused by the
presence of hydrophobic beta-branched side chains.

Background
Earth's environments exhibit the most diverse physico-

chemical conditions, including extremes of temperature,
pressure, salinity and pH. Among these factors, tempera-

ture certainly exerts a deep selective pressure on cell biochemistry and physiology [1]. Indeed, temperatures
approaching 100°C usually denature proteins and nucleic
acids, and increase the fluidity of membranes to lethal levels [2]. It is therefore of great interest to study how organisms coped with the molecular adaptations required to
thrive in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures. Such organisms, which are distributed among
the three domains of life, are called "thermophiles" or
"hyperthermophiles", if they exhibit an optimal growth in
either a 45°C – 80°C or a 80°C – 110°C temperature
range, respectively [3].
To date, a number of studies has been carried out to
understand how proteins found in hyper/thermophilic
organisms are stabilized [1-6]. Thanks to the wealth of
sequence and structural information available today on
hyper/thermophilic proteins, it is becoming clear that
there is not a general rule for the stabilization of proteins
at high temperatures. Rather, an increased thermal stability seems to be achieved through a combination of different small structural modifications involving, amongst the
others, ion-pairs interactions, hydrogen bonds and packing of hydrophobic residues [6].
Regarding the latter, one frequently invoked theory is that
the packing of hydrophobic side chains is improved in
thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, when
compared to their mesophilic counterparts [7]. Many
studies on proteins adaptation to high temperatures
focused on the differences in compactness between hyper/
thermophilic and mesophilic proteins using accessible
surface area [6] or cavity size [8] as judgment criteria.
However, as discussed by Robinson-Rechavi and Godzik
[9], and by Gromiha [10], these approaches present several drawbacks, e.g., the individual contribution to the
enhanced thermostability of different structural environments and inter-residue contacts cannot be assessed.
Hence, alternative ways to quantify protein compactness
were adopted. For example, Gromiha [10] analyzed the
long range and inter-residue contacts in mesophilic and
thermophilic proteins of sixteen different protein families, and found that an increase in contacts between
hydrogen-bond forming residues increases protein stability. Very recently, the contact order [11] is receiving
increasing attention, thanks to the findings obtained by
Godzik and his research group [9,12], who found that
hyperthermophilic proteins from T. maritima have higher
contact order than their mesophilic counterparts. Most
importantly, contact order is correlated to the folding rate
of proteins that fold with a two-states mechanism [11].
However, a severe limitation of this and other [10,13]
studies is that two residues are considered to be in contact
if the distance between their Cα atoms or between one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/14

atom and any other atom is below an arbitrary threshold.
For example, Robinson-Rechavi et al. [12] considered two
residues to be in contact if any of their atoms are closer
than 4.5 Å, while Gromiha [10] made use of a sphere of
8.0 Å centered on Cα atoms to define long-range contacts.
Furthermore, this approach bears another important
drawback: it does not permit to quantify the hydrophobic
contact area between two interacting residues. The hydrophobic contact area between buried residues represents in
fact an indirect measure of both entropic (entropy change
due to the rearrangement of the local water molecules as
two hydrophobic residues interact [14]) and enthalpic
(van der Waals forces in protein core, due to tight packing
of neighboring residues [4]) effects (Figure 1).
Therefore, despite a series of experimental and theoretical
studies on the molecular mechanisms of protein folding
[15,16] and stability [3,9,17] argued that the hydrophobic
contacts play a role of paramount importance in such
processes, the difference of apolar contact area between
large datasets of proteins from hyper/thermophilic organisms and their mesophilic homologs, to our knowledge,
has been never quantified.
Such consideration, along with the wealth of information
provided very recently by structural genomics projects,
prompted the comparison of a large number of protein
crystal structures from hyper/thermophilic organisms and
their mesophilic homologs, in order to assess the role
played by the hydrophobic contacts in the stabilization of
the protein core, at high temperatures.

Results
Analysis of the Apolar Contact Area
Two datasets were obtained from a collection of 1563
hyperthermophilic and thermophilic proteins, retrieved
from structural databases using several keywords (see
Methods section; Table 1 and 2). In the first case a choice
criteria favouring quality over quantity of data yielded a
non redundant dataset, which will be referred to as "A",
including 38 crystal structures, lacking any structural
defect and displaying a maximum resolution of 2.0 Å and
a maximum R-value of 0.25. Dataset A represents a subset
of a second dataset, which will be referred to as "B". Dataset B is composed of 59 crystal structures lacking any
structural defect, displaying a maximum resolution of 3.0
Å and a maximum R-value of 0.30. For each structure composing the two datasets, a mesophilic homologous counterpart was collected, following the same above
mentioned choice criteria. The computation of the total
apolar contact area (ACA) between the residues of each
structure pair composing dataset A and B was then carried
out. The statistical significance of the observed differences
of ACA between hyper/thermophilic proteins and their
mesophilic counterparts was assessed with a paired t-test.
The results are reported in Table 3 (see also Additional file
1 for additional information). T-test values are expressed
as the associated probability P of acceptance of the null
hypothesis, that is, there are no significant differences of
ACA between hyper/thermophilic and mesophilic pairs.
T-values scoring > 2.0 (P(t) < 0.05) are considered statistically significant. Figure 2 shows the difference of apolar
contact area computed over the whole structures of the
protein pairs composing the two analysed datasets. The
obtained values were normalized by the sequence length
of each protein. In dataset A, 22 (13 hyperthermophilic/
mesophilic and 9 thermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs)
of the 38 considered protein pairs showed an increase of
the ACA (Figure 2A); the corresponding P(t) was ~0.086
(0.079 for hyperthermophiles and 0.690 for thermophiles). In dataset B, 38 (24 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic and 14 thermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs) of
the 59 protein pairs showed an increase of the ACA (Figure 2B); the corresponding P(t) was ~0.012 (0.020 for
hyperthermophiles and 0.474 for thermophiles).
Although the obtained differences were not considered
statistically significant, according to the t-test validation
analysis, for both datasets (Table 3), nonetheless they
indicated a general increase of the apolar contact area in
hyperthermophilic proteins, compared to their mesophilic counterparts.

A more detailed analysis on the structurally conserved
regions [18] (SCRs; see methods section) of the structures
composing dataset A and B indicated that, in both datasets, a number of hyperthermophilic proteins underwent
a highly significant (P(t) < 0.001) increase of the hydro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/14

phobic contact area of those residues composing the SCRs
(Figure 3; Table 3). SCRs were defined as regions displaying a similar local conformation, lacking insertions and
deletions and composed of at least three consecutive residues. SCRs are therefore protein segments that conserve
the same main-chain conformation in each pair of structures analysed, excluding the intervening regions whose
structure differs markedly amongst different proteins [19].
Considering the role of great importance played by the
hydrophobic contacts in stabilizing and possibly driving
the protein folding mechanism, it seemed interesting to
analyse how, during evolution, the SCRs coped with the
modifications of the hydrophobic contacts necessary to
achieve the correct fold at high temperatures. In dataset A
(Figure 3A), 22 (17 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic and 5
thermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs, respectively) of
the 38 considered protein pairs showed an increase of the
ACA (P(t) ~0.0029). The same trend was also observed for
dataset B (Figure 3B), in which 37 of 59 protein pairs (27
hyperthermophilic/mesophilic and 10 thermophilic/mesophilic) displayed an increased ACA in the direction mesophile → hyper/thermophile (P(t) ~0.0001). The
measured mean ΔACA was 0.39 Å2/residue and 0.37 Å2/
residue for datasets A and B, respectively. However, if only
the hyperthermophilic/mesophilic pairs were considered,
the mean ΔACA was 0.74 Å2/residue and 0.63 Å2/residue
for datasets A and B, respectively. The maximum measured difference was 2.92 Å2/residue for the pair 1V7R/
1K7K (nucleotide triphosphate pyrophosphatase from P.
horikoshii/E. coli). Since these quite high differences of
ACA can be due to other factors than acquired thermostability (i.e., different overall conformations), the t-test validation analysis was repeated without these extreme pairs,
obtaining again not significant results (see "Methods" section and supplementary material).
To get a deeper insight into the statistically significant
increase of the hydrophobic contact area of protein cores
from hyperthermophilic organisms, the possible occurrence of a larger amount of hydrophobic contact area has
been examined in different secondary structure elements.
In dataset A (Figure 4A), 16 out of the 24 hyperthermophilic proteins considered showed an increase of ACA
in the α-helices of the protein core, compared to their
mesophilic counterparts, while in dataset B (Figure 4B)
the same ratio was 25 out of 37 proteins, with a measured
significance P(t) ~0.0524 and P(t) ~0.0113 for datasets A
and B, respectively. Although in this latter case significant
deviations from normality, as judged by the application of
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, were observed for the distribution of mesophilic values, nonetheless removing
three outliers gave a Shapiro-Wilk P(t) ~0.62 and a t-test
P(t) ~0.001. These results indicated that α-helices are
mainly involved in the increased amount of hydrophobic
contact area which was observed comparing hyperther-

mophilic/mesophilic proteins. Conversely, no statistically
significant trends have been observed in the comparison
of the ACA in the β-strands of the SCRs (Table 3). In dataset A, 21 (14 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic protein
pairs) of the 38 considered protein pairs showed an
increase of the ACA, while in dataset B, 34 (24 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic proteins) of the 59 pairs exhibited
an increase of the ACA. The mean value of ΔACA is -0.02
Å2/residue and 0.34 Å2/residue for dataset A and B. Therefore, at least for the hyperthermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs, it can be concluded that the statistically
significant increase of the hydrophobic contact area of

protein cores involves mainly the α-helices and not the βstrands.

Raa values ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (P ≤ 0.01) from the
mean value (that approximates zero) were considered statistically significant. Compositional analysis shows no
statistically significant differences between hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins, regarding the identity
of the residues involved in the formation of hydrophobic
contacts, except for isoleucine, that scored at ~3.6 standard deviations from the mean in both datasets A and B. It
is important to emphasize that, in evaluating the differences of amino acid composition of the residues involved
in conserved hydrophobic contacts, dataset B, containing
13 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs more
than dataset A, is probably more confident. In any case,
since both datasets A and B gave very similar results, the
role played by isoleucine is probably independent from
the number and type of structures analysed.

teins, compared to their mesophilic counterparts, an analysis was carried out to infer which amino acid pairs are
preferred in the formation of hydrophobic contacts. Preferred amino acid pairs forming hydrophobic contacts
were identified by computing the number of times a particular pair of residues comprised in SCRs makes a hydrophobic contact, displaying an apolar contact area > 0.0 Å2.
The results of this analysis are shown in Tables 5 and 6,
where each element ij of the interaction matrix reports, in
units of standard deviation from the mean value, the
measured frequency of interaction between residue i and
residue j. For dataset A, accounting for 17864 apolar contacts, five types of interactions (Ile/Ala, Ile/Val, Ile/Phe,
Ile/Ile and Ile/Leu) showed a frequency ≥ 3.0 standard
deviations from the mean value; in every case, isoleucine
is involved in such interactions. Similar results were
obtained for dataset B, where 33546 interactions were
counted: of six types of interactions scoring at > 3.0 standard deviations, five (Ile/Ala, Ile/Val, Ile/Tyr, Ile/Ile and Ile/
Leu) involved the amino acid isoleucine. The other statistically significant interaction is between glutamate and

lysine, scoring at 3.28 standard deviations from the mean.
The closeness between the apolar atoms composing Glu
and Lys residues might be only a secondary effect in the
generation of strong ion-pairs between these two residues.
Preferred amino acid substitutions in conserved
hydrophobic contacts
Favoured amino acid substitutions between the hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins were calculated
from the results obtained by the CHC_FIND tool [19].
The residues exchange analysis was indeed limited to the
identified conserved hydrophobic contacts. The obtained
substitution matrices are shown in Tables 7 and 8. Values
are expressed in units of standard deviation from the
mean. Only values scoring at 3.0 standard deviations or
more from the mean were considered statistically significant. Again, almost all of the most significant exchanges
involve isoleucine in both datasets (dataset A: Val→Ile
6.32, Leu→Ile 6.36; dataset B: Val→Ile 6.39, Leu→Ile 6.84
and Phe→Ile 3.12). These exchanges are reflected in the
variation of average amino acid composition of hyperthermophiles (Table 4), where a marked increase of isoleucine content can be detected. The only other exchange
observed not involving isoleucine is Ala→Val, scoring at
3.20 standard deviations from the mean.

Discussion
The main goal of this study was to evaluate on a quantitative basis the relationship between hydrophobic contacts
and proteins adaptation to high temperatures.

An essential prerequisite to carry out such a study is to
assemble a large and minimally redundant set of very high
resolution crystal structures. Indeed, despite the observation that each protein family seems to adopt different
structural strategies to adapt to high temperatures [5],
common trends may be outlined if a large number of
structural data is available [8]. At the same time, since
computed values of apolar contact area are mostly influenced by the relative position of the interacting residues,
their precision is affected by the resolution of the crystal
structures analysed. Therefore two datasets were culled
from a set of 1563 crystal structures from thermophilic
(optimal growth temperature between 50°C and 80°C)
and hyperthermophilic (optimal growth temperature
above 80°C) organisms, and their mesophilic counterparts. The rationale of this choice was to assure that the
obtained results were not biased either by the paucity of
data, or by the quality of the collected crystal structures.
As already discussed by Chen et al. [7], the increase of the
apolar contact area in hyperthermophilic and thermophilic proteins may be achieved at least by two different mechanisms: an evenly distributed increase over all
residues; a local increase over key residues. The latter
mechanism, that has been shown to be a major contribute
to the enhanced thermostability of proteins from T. maritima [9], seems to involve mainly residues already
implied in the formation of hydrophobic contacts. This
suggests that a better compactness may originate from an
even better connectivity in those protein regions that

already have a tendency to compactness and not by simply "tightening the loops" [9]. The results obtained in this
work on the difference of apolar contact area (ΔACA)
agree with this hypothesis: a significant increase of ACA
was measured in both datasets only when the analysis was
limited to the SCRs of the hyperthermophilic structures.
The SCRs were presumably subject to similar constraints
during the divergent evolution of a family of proteins
from a common ancestor, and therefore they possibly
contain most of the determinants necessary to maintain
the fold. Considering the role played by hydrophobic contacts in this sense, it is not surprising that the residues
composing the SCRs and engaging hydrophobic contacts
were mostly involved in the structural modifications nec-

essary to achieve and maintain a proper fold at high temperatures. Moreover, the finding that the measure of the
difference of ACA resulted highly significant only when
limited to the SCRs, could explain some apparently not
significant results previously obtained by measuring
accessible surface area [8] or cavity size [6].
The statistically significant increase of ~0.75 Å2/residue of
apolar contact area was observed only in the SCRs of
hyperthermophilic proteins. Therefore, it can be argued
that proteins from thermophilic organisms usually adopt
different strategies to enhance thermostability. Indeed, it
has been demonstrated that moderately and extremely
thermostable proteins rely on different mechanisms to

achieve greater stability [8,20]. Ion-pairs interactions represent presumably a predominant force in thermophilic
proteins, as well as in many hyperthermophilic proteins
[8,21]. On the other hand, comparisons of mesophilic
and hyperthermophilic protein structures indicate that
the hydrophobic effect has a contribution to stability only
at high temperatures, while only moderately thermophilic
proteins show an increase in the polarity of their exposed
surface [20]. Two factors could be responsible for this difference: the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic forces involved in protein stabilization, and/or the
phylogenetic origin of the extremely thermophilic organisms, that belong to the domain Archaea, and are there-

fore distinct from moderately thermophilic organisms,
which are mostly Bacteria. In any case, the obtained
results strongly suggest that packing of hyperthermophilic
proteins, in comparison with their mesophilic homologs,
has improved significantly, and it is reasonable to deduce
that this increased amount of apolar contact area contributes to the stabilization of the native state of the protein.
Our analysis revealed that α-helices were mainly involved
in the increased amount of ACA. Surprisingly, no statistically significant trends have been observed in the comparison of the ACA in the β-strands of the SCRs. We cannot
provide a clear explanation of this different behaviour

between secondary structures. An intriguing possibility is
that β-strands are, generally, already almost optimally
packed, even in mesophilic proteins, resulting in a small
margin of improvement. However, it is also possible that
this observation is due to 'sample bias' e.g., the peculiarities of the available protein structures.

Structural stabilization of α-helices in protein cores may
therefore represent a component of great importance for
the enhanced termostability of hyperthermophilic proteins. A number of studies in the past has stressed the
importance of the enhanced stability of α-helices as a general feature of many hyperthermophilic proteins. In order
to investigate the role of α-helices in protein thermostabil-

ity, Petukhov et al. [22] compared energy characteristics of
α-helices from four families of hyperthermophilic and
mesophilic proteins, using statistical mechanical theory
for describing helix/coil transitions. They found that the
magnitude of the observed decrease in intrinsic free
energy on α-helix formation of the thermostable proteins
was sufficient to explain the experimentally determined
increase of their thermostability. Furthermore, protein
engineering studies showed that a well-packed α-helix
structure is related to large increase in thermostability
[23,24]. It is well known that the flexibility of α-helices is
often required to assure protein function, such as conformational transitions in substrate binding or protein-protein interactions [25]. However, an excessive flexibility of
this secondary structure element, at high temperatures,
could result in an insufficient stability to maintain its
native conformation, causing the entire protein to unfold.
According to thermodynamic studies on model peptides
in aqueous environments, two main factors appear to play
a key role in the structural stability of the α-helices: the
presence of amino acids with intrinsic helical propensity,
and side chain-side chain interactions [26,27]. Therefore,
we further investigated the nature of the increased stabilization of α-helices composing the SCRs of hyperthermostable proteins, determining the differences in amino
acid composition of the residues involved in CHCs. The
results of this analysis strongly suggest that isoleucine
and, to a lesser extent valine, mostly to the detriment of
leucine, are involved in the formation of more hydrophobic contacts in hyperthermophilic proteins, compared to
their mesophilic counterparts. Likewise, the importance

of isoleucine in the formation of CHCs of hyperthermophilic proteins was confirmed by the analysis of the
preferred amino acid interactions in CHCs, where almost
all types of interactions scoring at > 3.0 standard deviations involved the amino acid isoleucine, and by the
favoured amino acid substitutions between the hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins in CHCs. A large
amount of theoretical and experimental studies demonstrates the importance of isoleucine in the stabilization of
protein structures from thermophilic organisms.
Malakauskas and Mayo [24] reported the computer-aided
engineering of a seven-fold mutant of the β1 domain of
the Streptococcal protein G, exhibiting a melting temperature above 100°C and an enhancement in thermodynamic stability of 4.3 kcal mol-1 at 50°C over the wildtype protein. Of seven mutations, five were of type XXX→
Ile, and they improved side-chain packing in the interior
of the protein. An increased content of isoleucine in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, to the detriment of leucine, was also noted by Haney et al. [28] and
Kumar et al. [6]. More recently, a structural genomics
based study carried out by Chakravarty and Varadarajan
[29] reported that leucine is preferentially substituted by
the β-branched residues valine and isoleucine, at buried
sites.
Several studies have demonstrated in the past that leucine
has a slightly higher α-helix propensity than isoleucine
and, generally, β-branched residues [27,30]. This assumption, which is apparently in contrast with the results
obtained by this work, derives from substitution experiments in short polyalanine α-helices-forming peptides in

water [31]. This process is mainly associated with the loss
of conformational entropy of residues during the folding
of α-helices in an aqueous environment: freezing side
chain with fewer internal rotational degrees in the α-helix
conformation would be entropically less expensive. However, it must be noted that these experiments, and many
derived propensity scales, do not take into account solvent entropy effects. As discussed by Creamer and Rose
[30], neglect of solvent entropy appears justified for a peptide side chain because no significant differences in solvation energy are expected in the side chain of a solitary
polyalanyl helix during a helix-coil transition. In either
case, the side chain is highly solvent-exposed. The same
situation would not be appropriate for a protein helix
that, upon association with the remainder of the molecule, engages a solvent-shielded interaction surface. In
this study, only the α-helices composing the SCRs and
therefore mostly found in the protein core were considered for further investigation. Therefore, application of
helix propensity scales might be not appropriate in this
case. For example, Li and Deber [15] have shown that αhelices propensity scales are not appropriate for non
aqueous environments and that β-branched amino acids,
as valine and isoleucine, rank among the best helix promoters in an apolar environment, as a lipid bilayer.
On the other side, hydrophobic contacts deriving by side
chain interactions could play a role of great importance in
the stabilization of the α-helices composing the SCRs of
hyperthermostable proteins. At temperatures above 80°C,
the hydrophobic effect, that is considered to be a dominant force in protein folding [32,33], is mainly enthalpy
driven [34]. In fact, while at high temperatures the
entropy contribution to the protein stability tends to zero,
the loss or gain of van der Waals interactions acquires
increased importance. For example, constructing 15 Barnase mutants in which hydrophobic interactions were
deleted, Serrano et al. [35] found a strong correlation
between the degree of Barnase destabilization and the
number of methyl side chain groups that were lost (r =
0.91). These data agree with the preferred substitutions
(RAla→Val = 3.20; RVal→Ile = 6.31) observed in the CHCs of
our datasets.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/14

Despite the advances in the design of hyperthermostable
protein variants [17], a potential drawback of these
approaches is still constituted by the time consumed by
computer algorithms for exploring the whole sequence
protein space. Other things being equal, focussing on the
apolar contact area of the α-helices of the protein core
through substitutions increasing the number of methyl
side chain groups and/or resulting in a better packing of
the secondary structure elements, will potentially give
clues for the thermostabilization of the protein.

Methods
Data Collection
Hyperthermophilic and thermophilic protein structures
were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB)[36], by initially searching for the words "thermo", "thermophile"
and "hyperthermophile". This search yielded about 300
proteins and their corresponding sources. An additional
search was then performed using as query the name of
such organisms, after having assessed that their optimal
growth temperatures were between 50°C and 80°C for
thermophiles, and above 80°C for hyperthermophiles
[3]. Optimal growth temperatures for each organism were
obtained from Entrez [37] and the "Prokaryotic Growth
Temperature Database" [38]. As a first refinement step,
the entries in which protein structures were determined by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were discarded, yielding about 1563 crystal structures.

Conclusion

As a second refinement step, all the entries were examined
by means of the PISCES tool [39], and culled from the
original dataset by maximum percentage of identity
(90%), maximum resolution (2.0 Å), maximum R-value
(0.25) and minimum chain length (50 residues) criteria.
Furthermore, a second dataset was collected following less
stringent criteria (maximum resolution at 3.0 Å and maximum R-value at 0.30), in order to cull a greater number
of structures. This second step yielded 458 and 767 proteins for dataset A and B, respectively. Each dataset was
then further reduced by eliminating proteins displaying
any structural defect, such as missing side-chains or chain
breaks due to missing residues, using the MAXIT tool,
available at [46]. At the end of this refinement step, 93
and 144 structures comprised dataset A and B, respectively.

In conclusion, taken together the obtained results indicate
the preference, in the hydrophobic contacts, for isoleucine
and valine residues as an important feature contributing
to the enhanced thermostability of α-helices in hyperthermophilic proteins, possibly occurring through a decreased
flexibility of these elements of secondary structure. This
effect, in turn, may be due to an increased number of buried methyl groups in protein core and/or a better packing
of α-helices with the rest of the structure, caused by the
presence of hydrophobic β-branched side chains.

Each structure of the two datasets was then exploited to
check for the presence in PDB of a mesophilic counterpart. To this purpose, a search with the blast tool [40,41]
was carried out, adopting the following criteria: 30% minimum sequence identity, that is usually accepted as a
threshold value to assure a homology relationship
between two proteins [42]; 90% maximum sequence
identity, in order to avoid any redundancy of data; 40%
maximum difference in length between the sequences, to

avoid the presence of large indels between the two structures. Furthermore, the retrieved mesophilic proteins had
to satisfy the same above described structural criteria to be
accepted. In those cases yielding several mesophilic
homologous structures available for each hyperthermophic/mesophilic protein, the one displaying the highest percent of sequence identity was collected. At the end
of this search, 38 protein pairs for dataset A (14 thermophilic/mesophilic pairs and 24 hyperthermophilic/
mesophilic pairs) and 59 protein pairs for dataset B (22
thermophilic/mesophilic pairs and 37 hyperthermophilic/mesophilic pairs) were collected (Table 1 and
Table 2).
Computation of the Apolar Contact Area
Computation of the total apolar contact area between the
residues of each structure composing dataset A and B was
carried out by means of the pdb_np_cont tool [43], which
computes pairwise atom contact areas between non-polar
atoms from structural protein data in a standard PDB
coordinate file. Briefly, this method is based on the classification of points located on a sphere of interaction
radius, surrounding each non-polar atom. The interaction
radius is the van der Waals radius of each atom type, plus
the radius of a water molecule. The output of this program
was utilized to calculate the pairwise residue contact areas
for every possible pair of residues belonging to the structures analysed. Heteroatoms were ignored. The total apolar contact area was then normalized by sequence length
of each protein structure.

In order to assess the role played by the hydrophobic contacts in the stabilization of the protein core, at high temperatures, each pair of homologous hyperthermophilic/
mesophilic and thermophilic/mesophilic structures was
initially superposed by means of the CE-MC tool [44]. The
resulting alignment was then utilized to derive manually
refined structural alignments. Every pair of structures was
visually inspected and, where necessary, modified to optimise the matching of several structural features, including
observed secondary elements, functionally conserved residues and hydrophobic regions, in order to give the most
accurate structural alignment.
Each structural alignment obtained as described above
was utilized to identify the common core and the structurally conserved regions between the pairs of proteins taken
into consideration (SCRs). SCRs were defined as regions
displaying a similar local conformation, with a mean
positional RMSD of the equivalent α-carbon positions of
the structures superposed ≤ 3.0 Å [18], lacking indels
(insertions and deletions) and composed of at least three
consecutive residues. For every structurally equivalent
position of the pairwise structural alignment, the RMSD
from the center of mass of the structurally equivalent Cα

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/14

atoms was computed. To avoid the presence of SCRs with
indels, positions with gaps were not considered. A window of size w = 3 positions was then scrolled through the
alignment and used to define seed positions with a mean
RMSD ≤ 3.0 Å. Each time a seed position was found, w was
increased iteratively by one position until the mean score
remained belove 3.0 Å, or until the window reached the
end of the alignment. The obtained SCRs were then visually inspected to avoid the possible presence of regions
with different conformations. Then, the hydrophobic
contacts involving pairs of topologically equivalent residues in both of the structures analysed (Conserved Hydrophobic Contacts, CHCs) were extracted from the
identified SCRs. The SCR_FIND and CHC_FIND tools
[19] were utilized to this purpose.
The differences observed in the amount of apolar contact
area between the SCRs of the hyperthermophilic/mesophilic and thermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs were
further investigated through the analysis of such differences in the regular secondary structure elements: α-helices and β-strands. Secondary structures were determined
by using the program DSSP [45].
The amount of apolar contact area measured in the SCRs
and secondary structure elements of each structure were
finally normalized by the number of residues belonging
to SCRs, α-helices and β-strands, respectively.
Amino acid Composition of the residues involved in CHCs
Differences in amino acid composition were measured by:

D aa =

n T (aa) n M(aa)
−
aa
nT
n aa
M

(1)

where Daa is the difference in amino acid composition for
residue aa, nT and nM are the number of residues of type aa
in hyperthermophilic/thermophilic (T) and mesophilic
(M) structures and naa is the total number of residues in
hyperthermophilic, thermophilic (T) and mesophilic (M)
structures.
The Daa values measured for each pair of the structures
analysed were then used to calculate the difference in
amino acid composition Caa over the k pairs composing
dataset A and dataset B:

C aa =

∑D

aa

(2)

k

The mean and standard deviation for the Caa elements
were determined; the significance Raa of the difference in
amino acid composition for residue aa was then calcu-

lated by dividing the difference between Caa and the overall mean C by the standard deviation σ:

R

aa

=

C aa − C

(3)

s

Raa values ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (corresponding to a
probability P ≤ 0.01 that the observed difference was
obtained by chance) from the mean value were considered statistically significant.
Preferred amino acid pairs in CHCs
Preferred amino acid pairs forming hydrophobic contacts
were identified by computing the number of times a particular pair of residues comprised in SCRs makes a hydrophobic contact. The obtained counts were then
normalized by the number of pairs of interacting residues
present in the SCRs of the structure taken into consideration. An interaction matrix reporting the differences in the
number of apolar contacts for each possible pair of residues, between hyperthermophilic/mesophilic and thermophilic/mesophilic structures, was derived:

C XY =

∑( C

XY
T

XY
− CM

k

)

k

(4)

where k represents the number of elements of dataset A or
B, CXY is the element of the matrix reporting the differences in the number of apolar contacts for the pair XY of
interacting residues, CT and CM are the normalized counts
for the hyperthermophilic/thermophilic and the mesophilic proteins, respectively.
The mean and standard deviation for the non-zero elements of the overall interaction matrix were determined;
the significance RXY of the interaction XY was then calculated by dividing the difference between CXY and the overall matrix mean C by the standard deviation σ:

R

XY

=

C XY − C

(5)

s

RXY values ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (corresponding to a
probability P ≤ 0.01 that the observed difference was
obtained by chance) from the mean value were considered statistically significant.
Preferred amino acid substitutions in CHCs
Amino acid substitutions of residues involved in the formation of conserved hydrophobic contacts between
hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins were determined by analysing the alignment of the SCRs of each

pair. For each residue X, belonging to a mesophilic protein and involved in making CHCs, aaX→Y was defined as
the number of times X is substituted by the residue Y of
the hyperthermophilic sequence. Likewise, aaY→X is
defined. Therefore, a substitution matrix can be obtained
by computing the difference between aaX→Y and aaY→X
over the whole dataset of protein pairs k, according to:

CS =

∑ ( ∑ aa

X →Y

k

−

∑ aa

Y →X

)

(6)

where CS is the element of the substitution matrix.
The mean and standard deviation for the non-zero elements of the overall exchange matrix were determined;
the significance RXY of the exchange X → Y was then calculated by dividing the difference between CS, and the overall matrix mean C by the standard deviation σ:

R XY =

C S −C
s

(7)

RXY values ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (corresponding to a
probability P ≤ 0.01 that the observed difference was
obtained by chance) from the mean value were considered statistically significant.
Statistical significance
The statistical significance of the observed differences of
ACA between hyper/thermophilic proteins and their mesophilic counterparts was assessed with a paired t-test
(applied to every pair of structures composing dataset A
and dataset B, respectively), to judge the rejection of the
null hypothesis (t > 2.0; P(t) < 5%). The null hypothesis
to be rejected with the paired t-test analysis is that there is
not a significant difference between the measured values
of ACA in the hyper/thermophilic and mesophilic proteins.

In order to ensure that the measured P(t) was not biased
by the extreme values of the distributions, the t-test validation analyses were repeated, removing the highest and
lowest values from the datasets.
The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was applied to judge the
distribution of the obtained values for the two datasets.
The null hypothesis of this test is that the analysed samples of data are taken from a Gaussian distribution; therefore, the returned P(t) of this test represents a criteria of
acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis. A P(t) <
0.05 was considered statistically significant to reject the
supposition of normality.
