Abstract
Background: The female lower genital tract is a gateway for pathogens entering the host through
the mucous membrane. One of the prevalent human viruses is Torque teno virus (TTV). The major
reported routes of TTV transmission are fecal-oral and parenteral. Furthermore, other modes of
transmission, e.g. sexual contact, are suggested. To investigate the sexual route of TTV
transmission, cervical smears of healthy women and those with cervical lesions were screened for
the presence of TTV DNA.
Methods: TTV DNA was studied in cervical smears of 95 patients with cervical lesions and 55
healthy women. Paired serum samples were available from 55 and 42 women, respectively. All
healthy women had normal cytology while 44 patients had histologically confirmed low-grade lesion
(LGL) and 51 high-grade lesion (HGL). TTV DNA was detected with primers specific for the noncoding region. In 40 paired cervical smears and serum samples, the phylogenetic group of TTV
isolates was determined. The presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears was detected by means of
PCR with MY09/11 primers.
Results: The prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears of healthy women was 52.7% and was
comparable with that in paired serum samples (50%). Symptomatic women had significantly higher
prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears (74.7%) than healthy controls. The TTV DNA
prevalence in patient serum samples was 51%. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were
concordant with those of TTV from cervical smears of the same subjects. In cervical smears, a
wider variety of TTV isolates was found. The viral loads in cervical smears were 10 to 1000 times
as high as in sera. The HPV-positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA prevalence
than HPV negatives. The prevalence of TTV was not associated with disease severity.
Conclusion: High prevalence of TTV in cervical smears suggests that sexual transmission is
another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The higher viral load in cervical
smears than in the respective serum samples might indicate active TTV replication in the female
genital tract. Nevertheless, cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated.

Background
The mucosal surface of the female lower genital tract is the
first line of defense against pathogens. The physical barrier created by epithelial cells prevents the penetration of
microbes and together with dendritic cells, macrophages,
NK cells and chemical elements, they are the main components of the innate immune system. However, many
common infectious disease pathogens succeed in entering
the host through the mucous membrane after which they
spread systematically. One of the most prevalent viral
pathogens of cervical epithelial cells is human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a very common sexually transmitted
infection with prevalence rates ranging from 2% to 44%
among healthy women around the world [1]. HPV plays a
role in the development of precancerous lesions and squamous cell carcinomas in the anogenital region. However,
most individuals eliminate the HPV infection without any
evidence of disease and only very few HPV-infected
women develop invasive cervical cancer after a long
period. The number of sexual partners, smoking, and
infections by other sexually transmitted pathogens are factors which increase the risk of cervical cancer in HPV
infected individuals [2].
The human population is frequently infected with Torque
teno virus (TTV), a small, non-enveloped DNA virus with
a single stranded circular genome, recently classified into
a floating family called Anellovirus [3]. TTV shows a high
degree of genetic variability: until now, more than 40 genotypes of TTV divided into 5 major phylogenetic groups
have been identified in various clinical specimens from
humans, including blood and cervical smears [4]. To date,
no clinical manifestations have been unequivocally associated with TTV, classified into orphan viruses [5]. Nevertheless, the high genetic diversity of TTV implies the risk
that one of TTV genotypes may have pathogenic potential.
The major routes of transmission are parenteral and fecaloral. Since TTV DNA was detected in semen and cervical
smears, sexual transmission has also been considered as a
possible mode of infection [6-9]. A study has observed
increase in TTV prevalence with increasing number of sexual partners among drug users with liver disease [10]; on
the other hand, several studies have reported that in atrisk groups of prostitutes, the rate of TTV viremia was not
significantly different from that in controls [11-13].
Therefore, the role of sexual transmission remains
unclear.
To investigate the possibility of sexual transmission of
TTV, cervical smears from healthy women and those with
cervical lesions were screened for the presence of TTV
DNA. For most study subjects, parallel serum samples
were also available for comparison and TTV subtyping.
Co-infection with TTV and HPV was investigated to sup-

port the hypothesis of the sexual route of TTV transmission.

Methods
Study population
Cervical smears and sera samples were obtained from the
bank of the National Reference Laboratory for Papillomaviruses in Prague. All samples were collected during a prospective study of HPV in patients treated for cervical
lesions in 1996–1997 [14]. Cervical smears from 95
patients (mean age 35 years, age range 18–71) were randomly selected to form two balanced groups of patients,
one with low-grade and one with high-grade cervical
lesions. The control group of 55 healthy women (mean
age 32 years, age range 18–61) was selected as age
matched to the patients group. Parallel serum samples
were collected from 55 patients and 42 healthy women.
For all study subjects, cytology data was available and for
patients, histology data at enrollment was obtained. Furthermore, the questionnaire data on medical history, education, socioeconomic status, and number of lifetime
sexual partners was accessible. All healthy women had
normal cytology with no pathological, clinical or cytological findings while in the patient group, 44 and 51 subjects had histologically confirmed low-grade lesions
(LGL) and high-grade lesions (HGL), respectively. No
informed consent from patient was needed by course of
law in the Czech Republic before 2000. The study in
1996–1997 was approved by the Ethical committee of the
institution.
DNA extraction
Cervical brushes were transported in tubes containing
phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with 5 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0, and stored
at +4°C. The tubes were vortexed and cells were collected
by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Forty microlitres of each cell pellet were digested in 100 μl of lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris/HCL, pH 8.0, 1% Tween-20, 5 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) at 37°C overnight. Proteinase K
was inactivated at 95°C for 10 minutes and the samples
were stored at -20°C. DNA was extracted from 200 μl of
serum by QIAamp Blood kit (QIAGEN Ltd., Crawley, UK)
and dissolved in 100 μl of the elution buffer (QIAGEN
Ltd., Crawley, UK). The control plasmid with a part of the
human beta-globin gene was added to serum sample for
the evaluation of DNA quality. Extracted DNA was stored
at -20°C.

The integrity and quality of DNA was assessed by amplification of the human beta-globin gene with primer PC03/
PC04. All tested samples were positive for the human
beta-globin gene [15].

HPV DNA detection
The cervical smears were analyzed for the presence of HPV
DNA by means of PCR with MY09/11 primers followed
by Southern blot hybridization and identification of HPV
types on dot blot hybridization with oligonucleotide type
specific probes or by sequencing [14].

vals (CI) and two-tailed P values were calculated in 2 × 2
tables using the EPI INFO statistical package (2002 version) and Graph Pad InStat (version 3.05) (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA). In all tests, the basic significance level was P = 0.05.

Results
TTV DNA detection
TTV DNA detection in cervical smears and serum samples
was done by nested PCR directed at the non-coding region
of TTV (PCR NCR) with NG133/147 and NG132/134 [16]
and with primers specific for the ORF1 N22 region (PCR
ORF1) [17]. The sensitivity of both assays was analyzed by
amplification of cloned TTV DNA at 1, 10 and 100 copies
per tube. The PCR NCR system was 10–100 times more
sensitive, able to detect one copy per reaction (data not
shown). Furthermore, ORF system is known to amplify
limited number of TTV genotypes while NCR system can
detect genotypes from all five so far known major TTV
phylogenetic groups. The prevalence with NCR primers in
our study was much higher and therefore we used results
obtained with this system for the final analysis.

Ten microlitres of the PCR product were separated electrophoretically on a 3% agarose gel (NuSieve 3:1, FMC BioProduct, Rockland, ME).
Semiquantitative determination of TTV DNA load
DNA extracted from the sera and cervical smears from 5
patients with cervical abnormalities and 5 healthy women
was serially diluted (in 10-fold steps) in distilled water
and the presence of TTV DNA was detected by PCR NCR.
The highest dilution (10N) testing positive was used as a
relative titer for determining the viral titer per 1 ml of TTV
DNA in serum samples and cervical smears.

In total, 150 cervical smears and 97 serum samples were
screened by PCR for the presence of TTV. The prevalence
rates of TTV in the study groups of healthy women and
patients with cervical lesions are shown in Table 1.
The prevalence rates of TTV DNA were 52.7% in cervical
smears of healthy women (29/55) and 50% in the parallel
serum samples (21/42). The difference between the TTV
DNA prevalence rates from the patient cervical smears and
serum samples was statistically significant (74.7% (71/
95) versus 51% (28/55), OR = 2.9, CI 1.4–5.8, P = 0.004).
Comparable prevalence rates of TTV DNA were found in
the sera from patients and healthy women, while patients
showed significantly higher TTV DNA rates in cervical
smears than healthy women (OR = 2.4, CI 1.2–4.8, P =
0.02).
Overall, 98.9% (94/95) of cervical smears from patients
with cervical abnormalities and 27.3% (15/55) cervical
smears from healthy women were HPV DNA positive. The
HPV-positive study subjects showed a significantly higher
prevalence of TTV DNA, i.e. 71.6% (78/109), than the
HPV-negatives with 48.8% (20/41) (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3–5.5,
P = 0.01). The patients were divided into two groups
according to cervical lesion severity. The TTV prevalence
rate was slightly higher in the group with high-grade
lesions, i.e. 76.5% (39/51), than in that with low-grade
lesions, i.e. 68.2% (30/44), but the difference was not statistically significant.

Genotyping determination
In 25 patients and 15 healthy women positive for TTV
DNA in both cervical smears and serum samples, the TTV
genotype was determined by a PCR assay based on amplification with TTV group-specific primers derived from the
conserved non-coding region [18].

The relative viral loads in cervical smears and in the
respective serum samples were compared for five patients
and five healthy women. All of these subjects had 10 to
1.000 times higher TTV DNA titers in cervical smears than
in serum samples.

The statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher
exact test. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence inter-

TTV genotype was determined in 25 patients and 15
healthy women with both tested specimens positive for

TTV. Any of TTV genotypes was recognized in 86% of
patient cervical smears, 50% of patient serum samples,
77% of healthy women's cervical smears and 34% of the
healthy women's serum samples. The most prevalent phylogenetic group was TTV 1 (45%), followed by TTV 3
(40%), the phylogenetic group TTV 5 was found rarely
(6%) and TTV 2 only in the group of patients (4%). Concordant phylogenetic groups of TTV isolates were found in
serum samples and the parallel cervical smears from the
same subject; however, in cervical smears more diverse
TTV genotypes were present (Table 2).
The number of sexual partners self-reported by the study
subjects did not exceed four. No difference in the prevalence of TTV DNA associated with the number of sexual
partners was found; the TTV DNA positivity rates were
65% (73/112) in subjects with less than three sexual partners and 64.5% (20/31) in those with three or four sexual
partners.

Discussion
TTV infects the majority of the general population worldwide but is not associated with any clinical evidence of
disease. The high prevalence of TTV in the general population might be explained by the existence of multiple
transmission routes. Several studies have reported the
parenteral and fecal-oral routes of TTV transmission and
other modes of transmission have also been considered.
The presence of TTV DNA in cervical smears and semen
suggests that TTV may be spread by sexual contact [9].
In our study, in agreement with Calcaterra et al., Chan et
al., and Fornai et al [6-8], we observed a high prevalence
of TTV in cervical smears. The prevalence of TTV DNA in
cervical smears of healthy women was similar to that previously reported for the Czech general population [13]. In
healthy women, no difference was found in the prevalence of TTV between the cervical smears and parallel

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/118

serum samples. Only one study has so far compared the
prevalence of TTV DNA in these two types of specimens.
Fornai et al. have reported a higher prevalence of TTV
DNA in serum than in cervical smears. Nevertheless, the
differences between the study populations can explain
this discrepancy. The subjects tested in the Fornai study
were HIV-infected individuals who have a higher TTV
prevalence and viral load in the serum than the general
population [19,20].
The cervical smears from patients with cervical lesions
were more frequently infected by TTV in comparison with
those from healthy women. The co-presence of HPV and
TTV in the patient cervical smears suggests that both
viruses have a common transmission route. The co-infection with TTV and other viruses such as HBV, HCV, and
HIV l has been reported by others [11,19,21]. The high
TTV/HPV co-infection rate, similar to those of HIV, HBV,
HCV, supports the hypothesis that these viruses share the
same mode of transmission and that sexual transmission
is another important mode of TTV infection. HPV is an etiological factor of cervical carcinoma and precancerous cervical lesions. The mode of transmission is mostly sexual.
It has been documented that patients with cervical disorders are more likely to start sexual life sooner and to have
more sexual partners [22]. Therefore, it is likely that if TTV
is transmitted sexually it will be more frequently present
in women infected with HPV. Women with cervical
lesions are also more likely to be HPV positive and form a
risk group in comparison to healthy women in terms of
the mode of transmission. Nevertheless, we did not find
the number of sexual partners to be a risk factor for TTV
infection, most likely due to the relatively low number of
lifetime sexual partners of our study subjects. Many studies have reported that the risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer increases with more than six lifetime partners
[22]. The similarity in the TTV phylogenetic groups in the
isolates from cervical smears and serum samples implies

the same source of TTV infection. The higher TTV load in
cervical smears may indicate that the vagina is the entry
site of TTV infection. The higher genotypic variability of
TTV in cervical smears may reflect that the vagina is the
first place of TTV infection. On the other hand, it might
also explain the inability to detect the lower TTV load in
the serum.
Originally, liver tissue had been thought to be a site of TTV
replication since the viral loads in hepatocytes were 10 to
100 times higher than those in the respective plasma samples. This hypothesis was confirmed by the detection of a
double-stranded variant of TTV DNA in the liver and
hepatocytes by in situ hybridization. The viral titer was 10
to 10.000 times higher in saliva than in serum. The
assumption that TTV might replicate in oropharyngeal tissues and/or salivary glands was supported by the detection of TTV in the gingival tissue [23]. In our study, we
found 10 to 1.000 higher viral loads in cervical smears
than in the parallel serum samples. This observation suggests that TTV might also replicate in cells of the cervicovaginal area.
The reported higher viral loads of TTV in HIV infected
patients might be associated with a poorer prognosis in
AIDS. A higher viral load can be explained by the immune
stimulation due to HIV infection. CIN biopsies in HIVpositive women have shown higher lymphocyte and macrophage counts in the squamous epithelium of the cervix
and an increased intralesional concentration of proinflammatory cytokines modulating HIV replication, with
consequently increased HIV genital shedding [24]. Similarly, higher TTV prevalence in HPV-positive patients can
be attributed to the stimulation of the immune system by
HPV infection and additional increase in TTV load. Nevertheless, more data is needed to better understand the phenomena. Additional risk to patients with cervical lesions
from co-infection with TTV was also investigated. As in
our study, TTV prevalence did not differ between patients
with low-grade and high-grade cervical lesions, co-infection with TTV and HPV seemed unlikely to promote the
progression of precancerous cervical lesions.

Conclusion
To conclude, high TTV prevalence in cervical smears suggests that sexual transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The higher
viral loads in cervical smears than in the respective serum
samples might indicate active TTV replication in the
female genital tract or might be the result of plasma secretion. The TTV shedding is possibly mediated by the
immune upregulation in the cervix and vagina due to HPV
infection. Nevertheless, natural cooperation between TTV
and HPV needs to be further investigated.
