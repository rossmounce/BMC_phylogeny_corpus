Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted from motherto-child during pregnancy and childbirth. Most importantly, the rate of vertical HCV transmission is increased
four-fold in the presence of maternal coinfection with
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To gain
insight into the evolution of HCV disease during pregnancy and to better understand the influence of HIV-1
coinfection, HCV quasispecies composition was characterized longitudinally in a group of 17 pregnant women
infected with HCV, including 13 subjects coinfected with
HIV-1, 4 of whom were followed during 2 consecutive
pregnancies.

Materials and methods
HCV RNA was extracted from serum and E2 hypervariable
region 1 (HVR1) and flanking regions (positions 12781889) were amplified by RT-PCR. Amplicons were cloned
and plasmid DNA from transformants was sequenced
unidirectionally. Sequences were aligned using Clustal X.
A mean of 18.8 cDNA clones of HVR1 were analyzed per
time point (1,337 clones representing 1,101 non redundant sequences). Mean genetic distance (p distance) and
its standard deviation were calculated using MEGA2.1.
dN/dS ratios were computed according to the Nei-Gojo-

bori method. Normalized Shannon entropy (Sn) was
used to account for the frequency of each different variant
in the quasispecies. Diversification of viral variants was
assessed using phylogenetic reconstructions built according to the neighbour-joining method and the Kimura twoparameter model.

Results
Median aspartate aminotransferase and HCV RNA levels
were higher in coinfected subjects throughout pregnancy,
with 3d trimester HCV RNA levels significantly higher
than those observed in subjects infected with HCV alone
(p=0.0283, Mann-Whitney U test). Quasispecies complexity based on numbers of HVR1 variants or Shannon
entropy was higher in subjects treated with and responding to antiretroviral therapy (treated-responders; n=11)
than in untreated-nonresponders (n=6) or subjects
infected with HCV alone (n=4) at all time points examined. Analysis of dN/dS ratios revealed that intrahost
selective pressure was consistently larger in treatedresponders than in HCV-only subjects, and always higher
in HCV-only than in untreated-nonresponders. Finally,
the level of diversification of HVR1 observed between
consecutive pregnancies was incompatible with linear
genetic drift during the inter pregnancy interval.

Conclusion
Overall, these results indicate that: a) coinfection with
HIV-1 leads to reduced immune pressure on HVR1; b) this
immunosuppressive effect is overturned by antiretroviral
treatment; and c) pathological events observed in HCVinfected women in late pregnancy are immune-mediated.
This study will lead to a better understanding of therapeutic and immune factors that influence viral evolution and
the clinical outcome of hepatitis C during pregnancy.
