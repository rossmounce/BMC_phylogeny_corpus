Abstract
Background: The parasitic Platyhelminthes (Neodermata) contains three parasitic groups of
flatworms, each having a unique morphology, and life style: Monogenea (primarily ectoparasitic),
Trematoda (endoparasitic flukes), and Cestoda (endoparasitic tapeworms). The evolutionary origin
of complex life cyles (multiple obligate hosts, as found in Trematoda and Cestoda) and of endo-/
ecto-parasitism in these groups is still under debate and these questions can be resolved, only if the
phylogenetic position of the Monogenea within the Neodermata clade is correctly estimated.
Results: To test the interrelationships of the major parasitic flatworm groups, we estimated the
phylogeny of the Neodermata using complete available mitochondrial genome sequences and a
newly characterized sequence of a polyopisthocotylean monogenean Microcotyle sebastis.
Comparisons of inferred amino acid sequences and gene arrangement patterns with other
published flatworm mtDNAs indicate Monogenea are sister group to a clade of
Trematoda+Cestoda.
Conclusion: Results confirm that vertebrates were the first host for stem group neodermatans
and that the addition of a second, invertebrate, host was a single event occurring in the
Trematoda+Cestoda lineage. In other words, the move from direct life cycles with one host to
complex life cycles with multiple hosts was a single evolutionary event. In association with the
evolution of life cycle patterns, our result supports the hypothesis that the most recent common
ancestor of the Neodermata giving rise to the Monogenea adopted vertebrate ectoparasitism as its
initial life cycle pattern and that the intermediate hosts of the Trematoda (molluscs) and Cestoda
(crustaceans) were subsequently added into the endoparasitic life cycles of the
Trematoda+Cestoda clade after the common ancestor of these branched off from the monogenean
lineage. Complex life cycles, involving one or more intermediate hosts, arose through the addition
of intermediate hosts and not the addition of a vertebrate definitive host. Additional evidence is
required from monopisthocotylean monogeneans in order to confirm the monophyly of the group.

Background
The evolutionary origin of parasitism throughout the tree
of life remains a central issue in evolutionary biology and
has attracted intense theoretical and empirical laboratorybased attention. In this respect the Platyhelminthes ('flatworms') have received great attention from evolutionary
biologists as a model system for investigating the adaptive
radiation associated with the evolution of parasitism (e.g.
see [1]). The phylum is represented by an assemblage of
superficially simple metazoan animal groups and has
long been considered to provide a key to understanding
the evolutionary origin and diversification of bilaterally
symmetrical metazoan groups [2]. It includes about
100,000 extant species of both free-living and parasitic
forms [3]. The conventional view of the phylum 'Platyhelminthes' is that it contains three major clades Acoelomorpha (Acoela+Nemertodermatida), Catenulida, and
Rhabditophora [4], but recent phylogenetic studies based
on morphological [5] and molecular evidence [6-10] have
suggested non-monophyly (mostly polyphyly) of the
Platyhelminthes. This is inconsistent with long-held prevailing concept of "the phylum Platyhelminthes" as
defined in most zoological textbooks. Subsequent studies
have separated the Acoelomorpha from the remaining catenulid and rhabditophoran Platyhelminthes, with the
acoelomorphs occupying a pivotal basal position among
the Bilateria [11,12] and the Platyhelminthes (sensu
stricto) as relatively derived members of the Lophotrochozoa [13]. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that the
Platyhelminthes contains four major groups, each having
a unique anatomy, body size, and life style: the 'Turbellaria' (a paraphyletic assemblage of at least seven distinct
lineages of mostly free-living forms), Monogenea (primarily ectoparasitic), Trematoda (endoparasitic flukes), and
Cestoda (endoparasitic tapeworms). Among these, the latter three groups (called 'Neodermata'; [14]) are represented by diverse obligate parasitic flatworms of
invertebrates and vertebrates that cause diseases in a vari-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/11

ety of host animal groups, including domestic animals
and humans.
The monophyletic grouping of neodermatans is considered to be beyond doubt [15,16], but sister-group relationships among its subordinate groups (i.e., Monogenea,
Trematoda, and Cestoda) are still under vigorous debate
[3,17-19]. Depending on the data sources employed for
phylogenetic analysis by previous authors, relationships
inferred were not compatible with each other (see Fig. 1
for details). Although a closer relationship of Monogenea
with Cestoda has received broader support from morphological and molecular sequence data, phylogenetic analyses of partial 28S rDNA sequences [20] and complete 28S
plus complete 18S sequences [19] suggested a different
result, rejecting a long established clade of Cestoda+Monogenea (= Cercomeromorphae). Inconsistency
in phylogenetic conclusions by previous authors concerning sister-group relationships among three major neodermatan groups, suggests the need for additional
independent molecular markers to resolve this issue.
The Monogenea are composed of mostly ectoparasitic
species which live on external organs (e.g., gill, skin, etc.)
of a broad range of aquatic vertebrate host, especially
fishes, with some exceptional species occurring in internal
organs of the host [21]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the phylogenetic position of the Monogenea, and its monophyly,
remain outstanding issues, because the evolutionary origin of ecto- and endo-parasitism in major parasitic platyhelminth groups can be elucidated only if its phylogenetic
position within the Neodermata clade is fully resolved
[22]. If Monogenea are resolved as paraphyletic, occupying the earliest branching lineages, then ectoparasitism as
the earliest life habit of neodermatans may be inferred
with confidence.

With a few exceptions, animal mitochondrial genomes are
circular in form, ranging from 13~16 kb in size. Each
genome contains 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, two
ribosomal RNA genes and 22 tRNA genes [23]. Comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome information
(e.g., gene arrangement, nucleotide and amino acid
sequences) has become a popular molecular tool for
resolving the deeper node of phylogenetic interrelationship in a variety of metazoan groups [24-27]. To date, the
complete mitochondrial genome sequence has been
determined for 13 flatworm species (six from cestodes
and seven from digenean trematodes), but the taxon sampling is highly biased toward endoparasitic flatworms i.e.
cestodes and trematodes that are of medical or economic
importance (for details see [28]). No complete mitochondrial genome information from monogenean species has
been available as yet and this lack of information has hindered better understanding of the impending phylogenetic issue as well as mitochondrial genome evolution
among major lineages of the parasitic Platyhelminthes.
For these reasons, comparisons of a monogenean mitochondrial genome with other flatworms are expected to
be very useful for resolution of phylogenetic relationships
in conjunction with gene rearrangement among the mitochondrial genomes of three neodermatan groups (Cestoda, Trematoda, and Monogenea). In the present study,
we revisited the phylogenetic issue of the Monogenea
within the parasitic Platyhelminthes based on the comparisons of the complete mitochondrial genome

sequences of a polyopisthocotylid monogenean,Microcotyle sebastis Goto, 1894 with published data from other flatworm species.

Results and Discussion
General Features of M. sebastis mtDNA Genome
The complete mitochondrial genome of M. sebastis [GenBank accession number: DQ412044] is 14,407 bp in size,
one of the largest flatworm mitochondrial genomes published to date. The genome is composed of 36 genes (all
genes are encoded in the same direction) consisting of 12
protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes and two ribosomal
RNA genes but lacking the atp8 gene, which is a common
feature in flatworm mtDNAs (see Additional File 1). M.
sebastis mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is A+T-rich (A+T
content of 70.5%; 29.4% A, 41.1% T, 19.8% G, and 9.7%
C) (Table 1). The A+T-richness of the entire sequence is
more or less similar to those in some cestodes (71.0% of
A+T in H. diminuta; [29]) and schistosomes (71.0%,
72.2% in S. japonicum and S. mekongi, respectively; [30]),
whereas this value is considerably higher than that found
in F. hepatica (63.5%) and P. westermani (51.5%) (see [30]
for details). The values for AT-skew and GC-skew of M.
sebastis mtDNA were calculated according to the formulae
([A-T]/[A+T]) for the former, ([G-C]/[G+C]) for the latter
[31]. For the entire sequences, AT skew and GC skew are 0.17, 0.34, respectively. The skewness in protein coding
sequences (AT skew = -0.20, GC skew = 0.34) is very similar to that of entire sequences, but the AT skewness is rel-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:11

atively lower for the tRNA genes, ribosomal RNA genes
and non-coding region (Table 1). The lower value of AT
skewness in these genes is generally considered to be associated with the formation of stem-loop secondary structures (i.e., base pairing between A and T in the stem
regions of their corresponding secondary structures). It is
notable that the extremely high value of GC skewness
(0.85) was encountered in the highly repetitive region
(see below for details). This unexpectedly high GC skewness is due to the configuration of a stem-loop structure
with some cases of G:T base pairing (instead of G:C) in
each of nine 53nt-repeat units.
The majority of protein-coding genes (ten of 12 genes;
cox2, cox3, cob, atp6, nad1, nad2, nad3, nad4L, nad5 and
nad6) appear to use ATG as the start codon, while the
other genes are predicted to start with ATT (cox1) and ATA
(nad4), respectively. Seven of the 12 genes terminate with
TAA (cox3, nad4, atp6, nad2, nad3, cox1 and nad6) and the
other three use TAG (cob, nad4L and cox2) as the termination codon. Although incomplete termination is common
in metazoan mtDNAs [23,24], it is relatively rare in the
flatworms studied thus far. Only two genes (nad5 and
nad1) are inferred to end with incomplete codon TA and
T, respectively, each of these is immediately adjacent to
the downstream tRNA genes trnE and trnN.
Twenty-two nucleotide sequence segments (ranging in
size from 59 nt [trnS1] to 69 nt [trnL1]) were predicted to
fold into a cloverleaf secondary structure (see Additional
File 2). The putative secondary structures common in 22
tRNA genes include an amino-acyl stem of 7 nucleotide
pairs (ntp), a DHU-stem of 3-4 ntp with a 4-9 nt loop, an
anticodon stem of 5 ntp with a loop of 7 nt, and a TΨC
stem of 3-6 ntp with a loop of 3-6 nt. Some exceptions to
these common features are trnS1 (AGN) and trnS2 (UCN)
in which each of DHU arms is missing and replaced with
an unpaired loop (10-14 nt) as found in all other flatworm species [32]. Anticodon sequences of 22 tRNAs
were identical to each of their corresponding tRNA genes
found in other flatworm species with an exception that
the trnR has a TCG anticodon sequence, rather than ACG
as those found in other platyhelminth groups.
A total of 21 intergenic regions, varying from a single
nucleotide to 472 nt long in size, were found in the M.
sebastis mtDNA genome. Of these, two intergenic
sequences, i.e., the highly repetitive region (HRR; 472 nt)
and unassigned region (UAR; 348 nt) adjacent to each
other are most prominent. The HRR located between trnK
and UAR contains seven identical repeat units of a 53-nt
sequences plus two additional repeat units, each abutting
directly onto upstream and downstream of seven consecutive repeat units, respectively, with some sequence modifications: two substitutions (T→G and A→T substitutions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/11

at the second and fifth positions of 53-nt repeat unit;
upstream unit) or with a truncated sequence of 5-nt from
3' end of the repeat unit (downstream unit). A 53-nt
repeat unit is predicted to form a stem-loop secondary
structure (not shown) with a 21 base paired-long stem
and a loop of 9 nucleotides. Of 21 base pairs in the stem
region, there are 12 A:T, five G:T, one G:C, three mismatch
pairings (1 G:G and 2 A:G) and two unpaired A's, respectively. The highly structured A:T and G:T base pairings
with avoiding C (only a single C is detected in each of the
repeated unit) account for an extremely high level of GC
skewness (0.85) in this repeat region. Although there are
some mismatched base pairings and two unpaired A's in
the stem region, the predicted putative secondary structure is considered to be analogous to those reported in
cestode species (H. diminuta [29]; T. asiatica [33]). This
stem-loop structure, although its function is still unclear,
has often been assumed to be associated with replication
origin. The second largest intergenic sequence, an unassigned region (UAR), is located between the HHR and
nad6. This region contains a peculiar ORF (open reading
frame)-like sequence segment of 174 nt comprising 58
codons including the starting codon (GTG for Val) and
termination codon TAA. Although atp8 gene has never
been found in flatworm mitochondrial genomes, the size
of the unattributed ORF is more or less similar to the atp8
genes reported in other metazoans. In order to confirm its
identity, we conducted the hydropathic profile comparison with other published atp8 genes (Geodia neptuni [Porifera]; Paratomella rubra [Acoelomorpha]; Trichinella
spiralis [Nematoda]; Lumbricus terrestris [Annelida]; Limulus polyphemus [Arthropoda]; and Homo sapiens [Vertebrata]) using MacVector program (Accelrys Inc.). The
predicted hydropathy profiles of the ORF candidate displayed very different patterns from the other sequences
compared. Direct sequence comparisons of the ORF candidate using both nucleotide and amino acid sequence
were also performed, but nearly no similarity was
detected. Moreover, the AT content of the ORF candidate
(78.3%) was much higher than the average (69.6%) of 12
protein-coding genes. Thus, taken together the evidence
does not provide unambiguous support that this sequence
is atp8 and therefore we designated it as an unassigned
region (UAR).
Molecular Phylogeny of the Neodermata
As explained, we prepared three independent amino acid
sequence datasets for phylogenetic analyses. From 12 protein-coding genes (using dataset #1, containing all complete neodermatan sequences and the incomplete M.
lineare sequences as ingroups, and four complete lophotrochozoan sequences as outgroups), a concatenated
amino acid sequence dataset containing 2,506 homologous positions was prepared for the following phylogenetic analyses. Implementation of the maximum

as missing characters generated a single most-parsimonious tree (tree length = 11,373 steps, CI = 0.722, RI =
0.674) as represented in Fig. 2. All three phylogenetic
methods produced the same tree topology in the branching patterns except for one minor change in their respective position between T. crassiceps and E. multilocularis: The
BI and MP found Echinococcus species (E. multilocularis
and E. granulosus) sister to three Taenia species, whereas
the ML analysis showed relationships of ((T. solium, T. asiatica) (E. multilocularis, E. granulosus)) T. crassiceps). In all
phylogenetic methods used M. sebastis, representing the
Monogenea, was positioned as sister to the Trematoda+Cestoda clade comprising all endoparasitic members. Phylogenetic analyses of dataset #2 (containing the
complete neodermatan sequences only [excluding the
incomplete M. lineare sequences] as ingroups, and four
complete lophotrochozoan sequences as outgroups), and
dataset #3 (comprising five gene loci only [nad5, cox3,
atp6, cox1 and cob] obtained universally from all platyhelminth ingroup and lophotrochozoan outgroup taxa)
yielded trees identical to that shown in Fig. 2. This result
is not concordant with the long-standing prevailing
hypothesis that has favored closer relationship between
the Monogenea and Cestoda based on morphology
[34,35] and 18S rRNA molecules [17,36]. The concept of
'Cercomeromorphae' (an assertion that Monogenea are
more closely related to Cestoda than to Trematoda) was
first advocated by Janicki [37]. Brooks and his colleagues
[1,34,38] have persistently advocated strong support for
the 'Cercomeromorphae' clade (Monogenea+Cestoda)
based on phylogenetic surveys of morphological characters. With respect to the possession of a hook-bearing posterior end structure in larval stages of tapeworms
(Cestoda), considered as being homologous to the posterior opisthaptor of monogenean groups, it has long been

accepted from morphological systematists as a key character uniting Cestoda and Monogenea [34,35]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, many recent works based either
on molecular data, or on the combined dataset of morphology+molecular sequence have suggested different
conclusions concerning the sister-relationships among
three neodermatan groups, depending on the data sources
examined. Of these, our data are consistent with that of
the most recently published result of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the combined complete 18S+28S rDNA
data [19] in which the conventional concept of 'Cercomeromorphae' was not supported. The position of M. sebastis was strongly supported by high bootstrap resampling
and posterior probability values (100%) in the analyses of
MP and BI, but received slightly lower support (88%) in
the ML analysis. In order to evaluate the stability of the
monogenean position in the Neodermata clade, the
unconstrained 'best tree' was statistically tested with each
of the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (constrained
trees) using the parsimony-based Templeton test [39] and
likelihood-based Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH test;
[40]) implemented in PAUP* 4.0b10 and TREE-PUZZLE
5.2, respectively. Resulting tree statistics demonstrate a
significant difference (Table 2) between the unconstrained optimal topology (a close affinity of Trematoda
with Cestoda) and the constrained alternative topology
(sister-group relationship of Monogenea/Cestoda), indicating that the position of Monogenea within the Neodermata clade is robustly corroborated by the current mtDNA
dataset. This is the first mitochondrial genome-based
molecular phylogeny supporting the position of the
Monogenea as sister group to the Trematoda+Cestoda.
Consequently, our result adds another independent line
of molecular evidence that refutes the 'Cercomeromorphae' hypothesis. This interpretation is further supported

by the comparison of gene arrangement patterns of the
flatworm mitochondrial genomes. In order to statistically
evaluate the paraphyly of the Trematoda found in all analyses, the Templeton test (MP) and Shimodaira-Hasegawa
test (ML) were applied to unconstrained 'best tree' and
constrained (monophyletic Trematoda) phylogenetic estimates. Although MP based phylogenies were not significantly different, those estimated using ML were (Table 2).
There is no evidence to suggest that Trematoda, or indeed
the Digenea or those digenean taxa included, are not
monophyletic from nuclear genes or morphology. We
suspect that resolving the Trematoda as paraphyletic is
likely artefactual, but we can only speculate as to what
may have caused this bias; e.g. base compositional differences between schistosomes and other digeneans (particularly Paragonimus), poor taxon sampling (all the cestodes
are highly derived cyclophyllideans). Additional
sequences from a broad taxon sampling of both cestodes
and trematodes and gene-by-gene analyses may resolve
this anomaly.
The gene arrangement of M. sebastis displays notably different patterns, compared to those found from other flatworm species (Fig. 3). The difference in the gene
arrangement of M. sebastis from other flatworms includes
some translocations of the protein-coding genes (cox3 and
nad6), tRNA genes (trnE, trnG, trnM, trnH, trnC, and trnK),
and two noncoding regions (highly repetitive region and
unassigned region called as HRR and UAR, respectively).
In general, the flatworm mtDNA gene order appears relatively well conserved, with the exception of the African
Schistosoma mansoni and other schistosomes S. haematobium and S. spindale whose gene order is markedly different from those of other flatworms including other
congeneric East Asian lineages S. japonicum, S. mekongi,
and S. malayensis [30]. A major gene rearrangement
among these schistosomes was interpreted as being supporting evidence for phyletic differentiation between the
two independent geographic clades [41]. Aside from those
of schistosomes, all gene arrangement changes encountered between cestode and trematode groups are remarkably minor and limited to very few translocations among
some tRNA genes (trnE, trnV, trnW, trnL1, and trnS2) and
the non-coding regions. This indicates that cestodes and
trematodes show high similarity in their gene arrangement pattern, but differ substantially from the monogenean member M. sebastis. The shared gene arrangement
among cestodes and major lineages of trematode members is very likely to reflect a common ancestry, rather
than being due to convergent evolutionary events. Along
with a robust sister-group relationship in all phylogenetic
analyses of amino acid sequences, gene arrangement data
also provide the supporting evidence for the closer relationship between Cestoda and Trematoda. Nevertheless,
we are still limited by the lack of information from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/11

closest outgroup of the Neodermata with which to detect
the plesiomorphic condition within the Neodermata.
Recently, the partial sequences of the mitochondrial
genome became available (approximately 6.8 kb) for a
macrostomid 'turbellarian' Microstomum lineare [9], but
this showed almost no shared gene boundaries with the
neodermatan groups, making it intractable for use in phylogenetic analysis using gene arrangement. Further comparisons of gene arrangements based on more sampling
of the complete mitochondrial genomes from the closest
outgroup taxa will provide useful information for resolving the issue of mitochondrial genome evolution among
major groups of the flatworms.
Evolution of Parasitism in the Neodermata
Evolutionary diversification and adaptive radiation of the
parasites are strongly correlated with their life cycle patterns. Accordingly, the evolutionary history of major parasitic platyhelminth groups can be traced by examining
the evolutionary changes of parasite-host associations
[42]. Tracking back to their historical transformations of
different life history forms during the evolutionary process can convincingly be clarified only if it is interpreted
within a robust phylogenetic framework. The interrelationships of the major neodermatan lineages is required
to determine how parasitic platyhelminths evolved, and
which life cycle pattern (ectoparasitism vs. endoparasitism) arose first within the Neodermata clade. If monogenean monophyly is true, as supported by the majority of
previous works, it is expected that a single shifting event
from ecto- to endo-parasitism or vice versa is equally possible to explain the evolutionary scenario of the parasitic
patterns found in the neodermatan groups. An endoparasitic life style appears to be plesiomorphic when inferred
from morphological [1,34,35,38] and molecular [7,43]
phylogenies where Trematoda are sister group to Cestoda+Monogenea. In contrast, in gene trees where Cestoda and Trematoda are sister taxa [19,20] (Fig. 1B), it can
be postulated that ectoparasitism is the plesiomorphic
condition. Indeed, it has often been considered among
parasitologists that a parasitic group with a simple (direct)
life cycle and higher specificity to its host groups is more
primitive than the group with more complicated life
cycles [15,44]. Therefore, the simple, direct life cycle pattern displayed by monogenean groups has been assumed
to be primitive and also correlated with high level of host
specificity [1]: Trematodes and cestodes display rather
complicated life cycle, such as utilizing many invertebrates i.e., molluscs (trematodes) or arthropods (cestodes) as intermediate hosts prior to entering into the
final life stage in various vertebrate hosts ('multiple host
system'). In contrast, the majority of Monogenea are
ectoparasitic on a broad range of aquatic vertebrates and
have only one host with high host specificity during their
life cycle, not involving intermediate hosts ('single-host

system'). The position of Monogenea in the mitochondrial gene tree (Fig. 2) is compatible with the idea that a
parasitic group maintaining simpler life cycle (being
ectoparasitic) is more primitive than the group with more
complicated life cycles (being endoparasitic), if we accept
that a single host life cycle precedes a two or more host life
cycle. Considering it in conjunction with the interpretation of life cycle patterns within the Neodermata, our
mitochondrial gene tree corroborates the idea that
ectoparasitism arose first in the neodermatan phylogeny
(i.e. primitive condition), probably in an early lineage of

monogenean groups, and that endoparasitism was secondarily acquired (i.e. derived condition) in cestodes and
trematodes (comprising all extant obligate endoparasitic
forms) after their common ancestry diverged from the
Monogenea. This result contradicts the previous hypotheses that the common ancestor of the Neodermata
acquired endoparasitism as the first mode of parasitism.
Evolution of Host-Parasite Association in the Neodermata
During the last decades, there has been a debate regarding
the order of host types in parasitic platyhelminths: what

Figure 4
Different views in the interpretations of the host adoption within the neodermatan phylogenetic framework
Different views in the interpretations of the host adoption within the neodermatan phylogenetic framework. The relative
sequence in the acquisition of invertebrate/vertebrate hosts by three major groups of the Neodermata is illustrated by numerical order (not to scale). (A) 'Vertebrate first' hypothesis; (B) 'Mollusc first' hypothesis (modified [45]); (C) the interpretation of
the present study.

host type was the earliest form involved in the life cycles
of the common ancestor of the Neodermata, i.e., 'Vertebrate first' vs. 'Mollusc first' (Fig. 4)? Under the parsimony
assumption, in which the hypothesis with fewer inferences of character transformation is preferred, mapping of
host adoption by each of the stem groups of the Neodermata onto the previously accepted phylogenetic relationships has suggested two different ways of interpretation in
relation to their life cycle evolution [45]. The simplest,
most parsimonious scenario ('Vertebrate first') proposed
first by Littlewood et al [43] was that the proto-trematodes
first acquired an endoparasitic association with vertebrates and that independent adoptions of invertebrates by
the Trematoda (molluscs) and Cestoda (crustaceans) were
subsequent acquisitions (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, it
has also been suggested that the association of common
ancestor of the Trematoda with molluscan hosts was
primitive (acquiring its subsequent vertebrate hosts independently), and that the vertebrates were involved in the
life cycle of the common ancestor of the Monogenea+Cestoda clade as independent initial hosts apart from that of
trematodes, with the crustaceans as subsequent intermediate hosts adopted by the Cestoda groups after the ancestral cestode was diverged from the monogeneans
('Mollusc first'; Fig. 4B). The 'Mollusc first' hypothesis has
received relatively broader support from the authors who
intended to explain the digenean evolution in relation to
host distribution [15,46]. This view was based on some
assumptions that the Aspidogastrea is the most primitive
group among the Neodermata [47], and that the Trematoda (Aspidogastrea+Digenea) is the sister group of all the
other neodermatan groups. But this scenario is not parsimonious, because it necessitates extra assumptions of secondary loss and/or gain of invertebrate (molluscs and
crustaceans) and vertebrate hosts during the divergence of
major groups of the Neodermata. Notwithstanding the

difference in their way of interpretation, both of these
alternative explanations were made on the basis of previous phylogenetic assertion that Monogenea and Cestoda
are most closely related ('Cercomeromorphae') and that
the Trematoda is sister to the Monogenea+Cestoda. The
underlying phylogenetic hypothesis on which most of
previous authors relied is seriously challenged by the conclusion of the present study in which the Monogenea are
positioned as sister group of the Trematoda+Cestoda,
refuting the 'Cercomeromorphae' theory. A possible scenario, not refuted by our mitochondrial gene tree, is that
the monogenean lineage is the earliest offshoot within the
Neodermata clade. However, further verification is
required that the Monogenea are indeed a monophyletic
group; paraphyly, with Trematoda+Cestoda as the most
derived lineage would confirm this scenario. If Monogenea were paraphyletic it would be most parsimonious to
infer monogeneans had diverged before either trematodes
or cestodes. If the interpretation of monogenean evolution suggested here is correct (Fig. 4C), then it is convincing to postulate that the most recent common ancestor of
the Neodermata giving rise to the Monogenea adopted
vertebrate ectoparasitism as its initial life cycle pattern and
that the intermediate hosts of the Trematoda (molluscs)
and Cestoda (crustaceans) were subsequently added into
the endoparasitic life cycles of the Trematoda+Cestoda
clade after the common ancestor of these branched off
from the monogenean lineage. Vertebrate parasitism first
(whether ecto- or endo-) is fully supported. Although
some authors have argued that cestodes are the most
derived of all Neodermata (see [15]), there is no conclusive evidence available for ordering which intermediate
host form was first introduced into the life cycles of trematodes and cestodes. Our interpretation based on the
mitochondrial genome phylogeny is likely to be the simplest (most parsimonious) explanation in understanding

the evolution of host-parasite associations coupled with
the modes of parasitism in the Neodermata. As Cribb et al
[48] pointed it out in detail, however, evolutionary estimation of the character transformation using a parsimony
approach does not always produce the best solution and
it might be misleading when information utilized for the
analysis is incomplete. The uncertainty of the closest relatives to the Neodermata and its life cycle pattern has not
been resolved yet, and therefore our interpretation should
be further verified by evidence concerning the identity of
the closest sister group of the Neodermata and the life
cycle mode in which it was engaged. Thereafter we will be
much more confident of the conclusion that the ectoparasitism arose first within the Neodermata representing the
vast majority of parasitic flatworms.

Conclusion
The evolutionary origin of parasitism within the Neodermata was inferred for the first time from a phylogeny of
the Neodermata, estimated with complete mitochondrial
genomes from all parasite classes. Comparisons of
inferred amino acid sequences and gene arrangement patterns of a polyopisthocotylid monogenean Microcotyle
sebastis with other published flatworm mtDNAs indicate
that Monogenea are sister group to the Trematoda and
Cestoda within the Neodermata clade. From this finding,
we suggest that ectoparasitism likely arose first in the neodermatan phylogeny (i.e. primitive condition), probably
in an early lineage of monogenean groups, and that
endoparasitism was acquired secondarily (i.e. derived
condition) in cestodes and trematodes after their common ancestry diverged from the Monogenea. In association with the evolution of life cycle patterns, our result
lends strong evidence that the most recent common
ancestor of the Neodermata giving rise to the Monogenea
adopted vertebrate ectoparasitism as its initial life cycle
pattern and that the intermediate hosts of the Trematoda
(molluscs) and Cestoda (crustaceans) were subsequently
added into the endoparasitic life cycles of the Trematoda+Cestoda clade after the common ancestor of these
branched off from the monogenean lineage. Complex life
cycles, involving one or more intermediate hosts, arose
through the addition of intermediate hosts and not the
addition of a vertebrate definitive host.

Methods
Sampling and Molecular Techniques
Live specimens of M. sebastis were isolated from the gill of
host fish Sebastes schlegeli from a fish farm at the Namhae
County of Gyeongsangnam-do Province of South Korea
(N 34°42'23", E 128°03'97"). The total genomic DNA
was extracted from a single individual using a QIAamp tissue kit (Qiagen Co.). Two partial fragments of cob (~450
nt) and rrnL (~430 nt) were initially PCR-amplified and
cycle-sequenced using two primer sets: The cob primers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/11

(Cytb-424F [5'-GGW TAY GTW YTW CCW TGR GGW
CAR AT-3'] and Cytb-876R [5'-GCR TAW GCR AAW ARR
AAR TAY CAY TCW GG-3']) were originally designed by
von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Brown, and Boore [29] and the
rrnL primers (PL16SF [5'-WYYGTGCDAAGGTAGCATAAT-3'] and PL16SR [5'-AWAGATAAGAACCRACCTGGCT-3']) were directly designed on the basis of
conserved regions of mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences
of diverse platyhelminth species. The sequences obtained
in these two regions were then used to design species-specific primer sets for long PCR reactions. Two pieces of
overlapping long PCR products (~7.8 and ~7.4 kb each in
size) covering the entire mitochondrial genome were
amplified using the Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche Co.) with the following conditions: 1 cycle of initial denaturation (45s at 94°C), 35 cycles of denaturationprimer annealing-elongation (10s at 92°C, 30s at 63°C,
and 8 min at 68°C), and 1 cycle of the final extension (12
min at 72°C). A negative control (no template) was also
performed for every PCR run to determine any potential
contamination of the PCR products. The amplified long
PCR products were isolated on a 0.8% agarose gel containing crystal violet, excised in ambient light and
extracted using the TOPO Gel Purification reagents supplied with the TOPO XL Cloning kit (Invitrogen Co.).
After gel purification, each of two long PCR products was
ligated using the cloning kit (TOPO XL Cloning kit) and
then transformed into E. coli competent cells. Cyclic
sequencing reactions for each of the long PCR products
were performed in both directions with a Big Dye Terminator Cycle-Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) using
primer walking. A full strand of the entire mtDNA
sequence was then assembled by double-checking the
sequences of overlapping regions of the two long PCR
fragments.
Gene Annotation and Phylogenetic Analyses
Twelve protein-coding genes and two ribosomal RNA
genes of M. sebastis were identified by sequence comparison with those published in other flatworm species, with
the aid of a web-based automatic annotation program for
organellar genomes (DOGMA; [49]). We identified the
putative secondary structures of 22 tRNA genes by using
tRNAscan-SE program [50] or by recognizing potential
secondary structures and anticodon sequences by visual
inspection. The amino acid sequences for protein-coding
genes of M. sebastis mtDNA were inferred using the flatworm mitochondrial genetic code (the genetic code table
9 in GenBank). Amino acid sequences, and gene starts and
stops, were verified by alignment against homologous
genes from other flatworms. In addition to the mtDNA of
M. sebastis, the mitochondrial genome sequences for 13
neodermatan species and four lophotrochozoan species
(used as outgroups) were retrieved from the GenBank for
phylogenetic analyses: Echinococcus multilocularis [Gen-

retusa
[GenBank:
NC_000941; Brachiopoda]. The sequence information of
the mitochondrial protein-coding genes for rhabditophoran turbellarian species Microstomum lineare is limited to
smaller number of gene loci (full lengths of nad5, cox3,
atp6 and partial lengths of cox1 and cob; [9]). For this reason, three independent amino acid sequence datasets
were prepared for phylogenetic analyses: (1) the dataset
containing all complete neodermatan sequences and the
incomplete M. lineare sequences as ingroups and four
complete lophotrochozoan sequences as outgroups, (2)
the dataset containing the complete genome sequences
only (excluding M. lineare sequences), and using four
lophotrochozoan sequences as outgroups, and (3) the
dataset comprising five gene loci only (nad5, cox3, atp6,
cox1 and cob) obtained universally from all platyhelminth
ingroup and lophotrochozoan outgroup taxa. A multiple
alignment for each gene loci was performed using ClustalX [51] with the following options: gap opening penalty
= 10, gap extension penalty = 1.0 with a "delay divergent
sequence" setting of 30% of the BLOSUM similarity
matrix. The result of multiple sequence alignment is not
always unambiguous due to the length and sequence variation among the taxa, causing the poorly aligned profile.
Therefore, a conserved block of concatenated alignment
was selected using the Gblocks program [52] for each of
protein-coding loci of all species examined and then subjected to subsequent phylogenetic analyses. This was compared with an alignment where ambiguously aligned
positions had been identified by eye; the two alignments
were almost identical and yielded identical phylogenetic
estimates. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of flatworm
mitochondrial genomes were conducted using several
methods applied to the protein sequence data. Bayesian
analysis was performed using MrBayes 3.1 [53]. We set
parameters to "ngammacat = 4", "rates = invgamma" for
likelihood setting. Four Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains were run for 106 generations, sampled
every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior probability values representing the percentage of samples recovering particular clades were estimated after initial 1,000 trees (the
first 105 generations) were discarded. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was carried out using quartet puzzling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/11

method of the TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 program [54] under the
mtREV24 matrix [55], as an evolution model for mitochondrial protein, with four categories of gamma-distributed rates estimated from the dataset. The analysis was
run for 5×104 puzzling steps. For ML phylogenetic analyses, the mtREV substitution model of Adachi and Hasegawa was used as it is widely recognized to represent much
better fit to the mtDNA-encoded protein sequence data
than the Dayhoff and the JTT models [55,56]. The maximum likelihood mapping method [57] was conducted to
assess the amount of phylogenetic signal in the dataset.
We also conducted maximum parsimony (MP) analysis in
PAUP* 4.0b10 version [58] and nodal support in the
resulting tree was estimated by nonparametric bootstrap
analysis with 1,000 random replications using a heuristic
search option. Statistical tests for the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were performed using the likelihoodbased Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [41] and parsimonybased Templeton test [40] implemented in TREE-PUZZLE
5.2 and PAUP* 4.0b10, respectively.
