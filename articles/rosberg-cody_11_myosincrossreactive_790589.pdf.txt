Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to determine the catalytic activity and physiological role of myosin-crossreactive antigen (MCRA) from Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. MCRA from B. breve NCIMB 702258 was cloned,
sequenced and expressed in heterologous hosts (Lactococcus and Corynebacterium) and the recombinant proteins
assessed for enzymatic activity against fatty acid substrates.
Results: MCRA catalysed the conversion of palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids to the corresponding 10-hydroxy
fatty acids, but shorter chain fatty acids were not used as substrates, while the presence of trans-double bonds and
double bonds beyond the position C12 abolished hydratase activity. The hydroxy fatty acids produced were not
metabolised further. We also found that heterologous Lactococcus and Corynebacterium expressing MCRA
accumulated increasing amounts of 10-HOA and 10-HOE in the culture medium. Furthermore, the heterologous
cultures exhibited less sensitivity to heat and solvent stresses compared to corresponding controls.
Conclusions: MCRA protein in B. breve can be classified as a FAD-containing double bond hydratase, within the
carbon-oxygen lyase family, which may be catalysing the first step in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production,
and this protein has an additional function in bacterial stress protection.

Background
The Streptococcal 67 kDa MCRA-like proteins represent
a family of proteins which are present in a wide range of
bacteria. It has been reported that some members of the
MCRA-like proteins have fatty acid hydratase activity
[1,2]. Recently, the MCRA protein from Streptococcus
pyogenes M49 was reported to be a FAD-containing
enzyme, which acts as hydratase on cis-9 (9Z) and trans-11 (11E)-double bonds of C-16, C-18 nonesterified fatty acids producing 10-hydroxy and
10,13-dihydroxy fatty acids [1].
The expression of the mcra gene was found to be upregulated by the stress responsive alternative transcription factor sB in Staphylococcus aureus [3]. It could be

speculated that in vivo conditions such as high temperature at the site of infection, leading to stress in S. aureus
may induce the stress responsive sB transcription factor
[3]. It is a general belief that the MCRA protein is
involved in virulence in Staphylococcus and Streptococcus [4]. A 67 kDa streptococcal MCRA protein was upregulated in group A Streptococcus during experimental
mouse soft tissue infection [5] and in the asymptomatic
phase of infection in cynomolgus macaques monkeys
infected with group A Streptococcus [6]. However, a
mcra deletion mutant in Streptococcus pyogenes showed
only mild alteration in virulence properties, such as
blood survival, adherence and internalization to human
keratinocytes [1]. Dunman et al. (2001) found the mcra
gene was down-regulated by Agr, one of the most studied virulence response regulators in Staphylococcus
aureus, along with other cell surface virulence factors
[7]. Growth-phase associated regulation of the mcra

gene was abrogated in a rgg mutant strain of Streptococcus pyogenes causing the mutant strain to synthesize the
protein during both the exponential and stationary
phases of growth, in contrast to the wild-type strain
which only synthesized the protein in the exponential
phase of growth. The transcriptional regulatory protein
Rgg coordinates amino acid catabolism and virulence
factor expression in Streptococcus pyogenes [8]. Also, the
mcra gene was up-regulated by the mgrA regulon in
Stapylococcus aureus. This regulon has been shown to
affect multiple Staphylococcus aureus genes involved in
virulence and antibiotic resistance, but also genes
involved in osmotic stress response (opuD (N315SA1987, encoding the glycine betaine transporter), proP
(N315-SA0531, encoding a proline/betaine transport
homolog) and gbsA (SA2406, encoding glycine betaine
aldehyde dehydrogenase)) [9].
The MCRA protein shows over 50% homology with
linoleate isomerases from Lactobacillus acidophilus
(Genbank: ABB43 157.1) and Lb. reuteri PYR8 linoleate
isomerase [10], a protein that catalyses the formation of
(9Z, 11E)-CLA from linoleic acid. CLA refers to several
positional (9,11; 10,12; 11,13; etc.) and geometric (cis or
trans) isomers of linoleic acid C18:2 cis-9 (c9), cis-12
(c12) octadecadienoic acid] with conjugated double
bonds, and the (9Z, 11E) and (10E, 12Z) isomers in particular, have been shown to exert beneficial effects on
human metabolism, including anti- carcinogenic, antidiabetogenic and anti-atherogenic activities and body
composition alteration effects. CLA is formed via biotransformation of linoleic acid, as a direct result of the
action of the ruminal microbiota, of which Butyrivibrio
fibrisolvens is the foremost [11-13]. The mechanism of
microbial production of CLA was characterised using
washed cells of the strain Lb. acidophilus AKU 1137
[14] and involves the production of hydroxy fatty acids
as precursor to formation of CLA. When isolated and
introduced to the washed cells, these hydroxy fatty acids
were rapidly transformed to their respective CLA isomers. Thus, CLA formation by Lb. acidophilus was
found to consist of two distinct steps, step one: the
hydration of linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-18:1 and step
two: the subsequent dehydration and isomerisation of
these hydroxy fatty acids to the c9,t11 CLA and t9,t11
CLA isomers.
We have previously reported the ability of a range of
Bifidobacterium spp. to produce the c9,t11 CLA isomer
from free linoleic acid [15-17] and have shown that
administration of CLA producing B. breve NCIMB
702258 to mice and pigs in combination with linoleic
acid alters host tissue fatty acid composition [18],
including elevated liver c9,t11 CLA, coupled with reductions in the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) and interferon-g (IFN-g). The enzyme

responsible for CLA production in Bifidobacterium has
not been reported. The aims of this study were 1) to
investigate if the MCRA protein from B. breve NCIMB
702258 was active as a fatty acid hydratase, by introducing the gene encoding MCRA into Corynebacterium
glutamicum and Lactococcus lactis and analysis of the
enzymatic activity of the expressed protein in the heterologous hosts and 2) to investigate whether this led to
increased stress tolerance in the new hosts, and thus we
report a role for MCRA in stress protection in B. breve.

Methods
Cultures and media

B. breve NCIMB 702258 was cultured in MRS media
(pH 6.0, Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK) supplemented with
0.05% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride (Sigma Chemical,
98% pure) under anaerobic conditions using anaerobic
jars with ‘Anaerocult A’ gas packs (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) at 37°C. Lactococcus lactis NZ9800 (a L. lactis
NZ9700 derivative which does not produce nisin
because of a deletion in the nisA gene, and contains the
nisRK signal transduction genes integrated on the chromosome) was cultured at 30°C in M17 (Difco laboratories, USA) broth and/or agar containing glucose (0.5%
w/v). L. lactis carrying the plasmid pNZ8048 was routinely cultured in the presence of chloramphenicol (5 μg/
ml) as a selective marker. Corynebacterium glutamicum
ATCC 13032 was cultured aerobically in BHI media
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37°C. C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 carrying the shuttle vector pCLIK 5a MCS
Pddh (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) was routinely
cultured in the presence of kanamycin (20 μg/ml) as a
selective marker. Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) carrying
the plasmid pOXO4 was routinely cultured aerobically
in BHI at 37°C in the presence of chloramphenicol
(25 μg/ml) as a selective marker.
DNA sequence analysis and primer design

The sequence encoding the 67 kDa MCRA (linoleate
isomerase) protein from Lb. reuteri PYR8 [19] was compared to sequence databases (GenBank and unfinished
genomes databases), using the BLAST suite of programs
[20]. Proteins exhibiting significant similarity were
aligned using DNAStar software (DNAStar Inc. Madison, WI, USA) and conserved motifs were identified.
Degenerate oligonucleotide primers and primers specific
for bifidobacteria (considering bifidobacteria codon
usage) were designed to these motifs (YWXTMF AFE
and DTVFTTEYS, Figure 1) and used in PCR reactions
to amplify a ~1 kb internal region of the sequence as
follows: Primer EV1a forward and EV2a reverse general,

performed in a Hybaid PCR Express Unit (Hybaid Ltd.
Middlesex, UK) in 50 μl with an annealing temperature
of 45°C. Each reaction contained 1 μl of each primer
(50 pmol/μl), 2 μl of template in 5 μl MgCl2 (50 mM),
5 μl dNTP Master Mix (12.5 mM), 50 μl 10x NH4 Reaction Buffer and 0.5 μl Biotaq DNA Polymerase (5 U/μl)
(BIOLINE, London, UK). The resulting ~1 kb fragment
was cloned into pCR 2.1- TOPO and sequenced (MWG,
Germany).

another 370 bp of the upstream region of the gene. The
last round of inverse PCR to obtain the missing 170 bp
from the 5’ end of the gene was carried out with primers ER001 (5’-TCGATGGAGGGAATCGAA-3’) and
ER002 (5’-TATTGGCTCAACAAGGAAGAT-3’) targeted to circularized HaeII digests.
DNA manipulations and plasmid construction

Chromosome walking by inverse PCR

To obtain flanking chromosomal sequence, two primers
were designed to terminal regions of the known chromosomal DNA sequence (Additional file 1). The genomic DNA from B. breve NCIMB 702258 was digested
with a range of restriction enzymes followed by ligation
with DNA ligase as described by the supplier (New England BioLabs Inc. Hertfordshire, UK). The circularized
fragments were subsequently used as templates in the
inverse PCR reactions with the terminal primers. The
reactions were performed in the same way as the standard PCR reactions but with an annealing temperature
of 50°C and the resulting fragments (analysed after
separation by agarose gel electrophoresis) were cloned
into the pCR2.1-TOPOvector and sequenced. The two
terminal primers used were Primer A (upstream): 3’CGTTCTCGACCTTGGTGTTGTATCGGAATT 5’ and
Primer B (downstream): 5’ -GTACCGACCGACAA
GATCGAGTCGCTTGCC-3’. From the approach
described above, it was confirmed by sequencing that
the 3’ end of the gene was obtained from re-circularized

Genomic DNA was isolated from B. breve NCIMB
702258 by a modified method described by Hoffmann
et al. (1987) [21]. The 1878 mcra gene from B. breve
NCIMB 702258 (Genbank: HQ593838) was amplified
from genomic DNA with primers EMY01 and EMY02
(Table 1). PCR was performed with High Fidelity
Expand Polymerase as described by the supplier (Roche
Diagnostics, England) using 200 ng genomic DNA as a
template. PCR conditions were as follows: 10 cycles of
2 min, 15 s denaturation (94°C), 30 s annealing (55°C),
2 min elongation (72°C) followed by 20 cycles of 15 s
(94°C), 30 s (55°C), 2 min + 5 s/cycle (72°C) and finally,
one 7 min cycle at 72°C.
The mcra gene was amplified with primers EMY03
and EMY04 (Table 1) for cloning in pCLIK, resulting in
the construct pEMYC2 which was transformed into
C. glutamicum. Recombinant plasmids were double
digested with the same enzymes to verify the correct
clone and electroporated into L. lactis NZ9 800 and C.
glutamicum ATCC 13032. Electrocompetent L. lactis
were prepared and transformed according to the method

described by de Ruyter et al. (1996) [22], while electrocompetent C. glutamicum cells were prepared as
described by Luchansky et al. (1988) [23]. For enzymatic
assays, the recombinant B. breve MCRA protein was
produced in E. coli as N-terminal 6x His-tag fusion. The
complete mcra gene was amplified using primers
BBI_fw2 and BBI_rv2 (Table 1). Ligation with pET28
vector (Novagen) resulted in a construct pBBI2 containing N-terminal fusion of 6x His tag and B. breve MCRA
protein. The authenticity of the clones was verified by
sequencing (MWG-BIOTECH, Germany).
Investigation of the stress tolerance of MCRA proteinoverproducing L. lactis and C. glutamicum

The MCRA protein was expressed in lactococci using the
NICE system [22], which allows maximal protein expression at sub-lethal concentrations of nisin, and is tightly
controlled, such that there is negligible expression in the
absence of nisin [24]. The MCRA protein was also
expressed in C. glutamicum using the shuttle vector
pCLIK 5a MCS Pddh. This vector replicates in both
E. coli and C. glutamicum and contains a C. glutamicum
promoter (ddh promoter) and a kanamycin resistance
gene which function in both E. coli and C. glutamicum.
L. lactis pNZ8048 and pEMYL1 cells were induced with
nisin (10 ng/ml) at OD600 nm ~ 0.5 and cultures were
left to grow for an additional 1.5 h prior to heat treatment. C. glutamicum pCLIK and pEMYC2 were grown
to OD600 nm ~ 0.4 - 0.5, prior to stress. Thermotolerance of L. lactis and C. glutamicum was monitored at
51°C in broth over 30-40 min. Aliquots were removed at
0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, plated on agar and incubated at
30°C (L. lactis) and 37°C (C. glutamicum) for 72 h. Salt
tolerance was determined following resuspension in
broth containing 3 M NaCl (L. lactis) and 4.8 M NaCl
(C. glutamicum) and culture viability was monitored over
60-90 min with aliquots taken at 15 min intervals.
Solvent tolerance was determined on addition of butanol
1-5% (v/v), and survival was monitored over 90 min with
aliquots taken at 15 min intervals.

Heterologous expression, protein extraction and SDSPAGE

The putative linoleic acid isomerase was expressed in
pOXO4 in E. coli using the T7 system (pOXO4 is a T7
RNA polymerase dependent expression plasmid). E. coli
pOXO4 (control) and E. coli pEMYE3 cultures were aerated vigorously until the OD600nm reached approximately
0.6, at which point isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was added to final concentration of 0.5 mM to
induce expression of the T7 RNA polymerase. Aliquots
were taken at intervals after IPTG induction at 1, 3, 6
and 12 h for whole cell protein extraction and sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). Similarly, L. lactis pEMYL1 and pNZ8048 (vector
control) were cultured to OD600nm ~0.5 and induced
with nisin (10 ng/ml) and allowed to grow for another
12 h prior to protein extraction. C. glutamicum pEMYC2
and pCLIK (vector control) were cultured as described
previously for 24 h prior to protein extraction. To extract
proteins, cells (9 ml) were harvested and washed in
20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 and resuspended in 0.5 ml
extraction solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 M Urea
and Chaps (0.5% w/v)) and bead-beaten for 2 × 30 sec
with 1 min rest on ice. The cell lysate was then centrifuged to remove beads and cell debris and the protein
extracts analysed by SDS-PAGE using a Mini Protean II
cell unit (Bio-Rad) by the method of Laemmli [25] with a
10% acrylamide resolving gel and 4% stacking gel. A low
molecular weight standard ranging from 14,400 to 97,400
Da (BioRad) was used as a molecular weight marker.
Production and purification of recombinant B. breve
MCRA protein from E. coli

For protein production, E. coli BL21 Star strain (Invitrogen, Darmstadt Germany) harboring pBBI2 plasmid was
used. Bacteria were cultivated in 2xYT medium (tryptone (30 g/L), yeast extract (15 g/L), NaCl (5 g/L)) supplied with kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 37°C until OD600
reached 0.6. At that point, IPTG was added to final concentration of 0.1 mM, the cells were changed to 16°C

Rosberg-Cody et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/9

and harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 9100 g) after
18 h induction time. Cells were resuspended in buffer A
(0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl) in 1:3 v/v ratio,
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C.
For protein purification, cells were lysed by adding
lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) and DNaseI (1 μg/ml) in buffer A
and 10 mM MgCl2 and centrifuged for 20 min at
70,000 g. The supernatant was loaded on HisTrap column (GE Healthcare, Sweden), the column was washed
with 10 column volumes of buffer A, and the protein
was eluted with 3 column volumes of buffer A and
0.5 M imidazol. After elution, the buffer was exchanged
to buffer B (0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) by
ultrafiltration and protein concentration was estimated
spectrophotometrically using calculated absorption coefficient ε280 = 116990.
Immunoblotting

10 μg of protein were subjected to SDS PAGE followed
by protein transfer to nitrocellulose membrane at 60 V,
4 mA/cm 2 gel surface for 1 h. The membrane was
washed with buffer B and blocked for one hour in buffer
B containing 5% (w/v) milk powder. His-tagged proteins
were detected using anti-His tag antibody (Sigma) in
combination with a secondary antibody coupled with
alkaline phosphatase and nitrotetrazolium blue/5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate staining.
Spectroscopic assays

Solution of purified B. breve MCRA protein had yellow
colour, therefore for initial characterization UV-Vis
spectrum of purified protein in the range 300-600 nm
was recorded with a single beam absorption spectrometer (Ultrospec 2100 pro, GE Healthcare). For the
reference, spectra of FAD and FMN in Buffer B were
recorded in the same way. For these measurements,
B. breve MCRA protein, FAD and FMN were brought
within the concentration range 10-40 pM. The absence
of covalent bond between cofactor and B. breve MCRA
protein was confirmed in the following way; 200 pl of
the protein (10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) was
boiled for 10 min at 100°C and centrifuged at 12,000 g
for 10 min. The spectrum of the supernatant was then
recorded as described above.
Activity assay, lipid extraction and derivatization

To demonstrate the enzymatic activity of B. breve MCRA
protein, a panel of free fatty acids was tested in the
reactions with the purified protein. Typically, 10-50 pg
of substrate was mixed with 10 pg of purified protein in 1
mL of buffer B and incubated for 1 h at 25°C. Fatty acids
were extracted from the reaction mixture with 1 ml
chloroform:methanol (1:1) according to Bligh and
Dyer [26]. Free fatty acids were dissolved in methanol

Page 5 of 12

and converted to corresponding methyl esters with
(trimethylsilyl)-diazomethane. For GC- MS analysis, fatty
acid methyl esters were dissolved in acetonitrile and
hydroxy groups were modified by N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), resulting in fatty acid
trimethylsilylethers. GC-MS analysis was performed as
previously described [27].
Phylogenetic analysis

Homologs to the previously identified linoleate isomerase from Lb. acidophilus (Genbank: ABB43 157.1) and
oleate hydratase, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica (Genbank: GQ144652) were selected from BLAST analysis.
These homologs, along with MCRA from B. breve
NCIMB 702258 discussed in this manuscript were
aligned using T-Coffee [28] and protein trees were built
using the PHYLIP package [29]. The cladogram was
then visualised using DENDROSCOPE [30].

Results
Previous studies by Rosson et al. [10] reported on the
isolation and purification of a putative linoleic acid isomerase from Lb. reuteri. In these studies, protein
sequencing had identified a 67 kDa protein with homology to MCRA. Based on this finding, we designed primers to conserved regions shared by a range of MCRA
proteins in the database (Figure 1) and found that we
could PCR the gene from a range of different Bifidobacterium strains and Propionibacterium freudenreichii
shermanii (Additional file 2). Given that B. breve
NCIMB 702258 is known to be capable of producing c9,
t11 CLA from linoleic acid [16], we decided to study
this strain in terms of CLA production. Using primers
EV1a forward and EV2a reverse, we amplified a 1 kb
internal fragment of the putative isomerase gene from
B. breve. Sequencing of this revealed up to 70% homology to MCRA proteins from various genera. Following
this, we primer walked in both 5’and 3’ directions,
which resulted in the full sequence of B. breve putative
isomerase (Additional file 1).
Sequence analysis

The complete 1878 bp nucleotide sequence from B. breve
NCIMB 702258 encodes a protein of 626 amino acids
with homology to other “67 kilodalton MCRA” proteins.
The calculated molecular weight of the protein is
70535.38 Da. Comparison with sequences in the database
revealed that the cloned MCRA protein showed 71%
homology with putative 67 kDa MCRA from Streptococcus mutans UA159 (Genbank: NP_720953) and 51%
homology with Lb. acidophilus linoleate isomerase (Genbank: ABB43 157.1). A non-canonical flavin binding
motif (GxGxxA(x)21E) is present at the N-terminus
of B. breve MCRA protein, similar to Streptococcus and

cytoplasmic, but may have one trans-membrane helix as
predicted by PSORTb (http://www.psort.org/). Upstream
of the ORF is a putative dehydrogenase or reductase protein with ~50% homology with B. longum NCC2705 2,5diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase (Genbank: AAN24097).
Downstream of the TGA stop codon is a region of dyad
symmetry, capable of forming a stable stem-and-loop
structure. The potential hairpin consists of 13-bp stem
separated by a 3-bp mis-priming and a 5- bp loop (ΔG,
-15.01 kcal).
Over-expression of B. breve MCRA protein in E. coli

Since no over-expression of the putative linoleic acid
isomerase could be confirmed following SDS-PAGE of
the recombinant lactococci and corynebacteria, possibly
due to masking of the protein by other proteins of similar molecular weight (Additional file 3), the putative lai
(linoleic acid isomerase) gene was expressed in pOXO4
in E. coli using the T7 system (pOXO4 is a T7 RNA
polymerase dependent expression plasmid). Following
growth and induction at OD600 nm 0.6 with 0.5 mM
IPTG, aliquots of E. coli pOXO4 (control) and E. coli
pEMYE3 were taken at 1, 3, 6 and 12 h after induction
for whole cell protein extraction and SDS-PAGE. A protein band of approximately 66 kDa was visualized, corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the
putative isomerase protein, which was absent in the
IPTG induced control culture E. coli pOXO4 (Additional file 3). Following incubation for 48-72 h with free
linoleic acid (0.5 mg/ml), the substrate for bacterial

A

conversion to c9,t11 CLA, no isomerase activity could
be confirmed among the heterologous clones carrying
the lai gene in the bacterial supernatant by GC (Additional file 4), or by measuring OD234 nm [17].
Production of B. breve MCRA in E. coli. and enzymatic
assays

B. breve MCRA protein was overproduced in E. coli and
purified on Ni2+-NTA column (Figure 2A, lane 2). The
major band with apparent molecular weight of 66 kDa
was visualized on SDS PAGE after the elution. Immunoblotting with anti-His tag antibodies confirmed that this
band contained 6x His tag (Figure 2A, lane 3). Purified
B. breve MCRA protein has flavin-like UV-Vis absorption spectrum with maxima around 450 and 370 nm
(Figure 2B) and the flavin cofactor is released in the
solution upon protein denaturation by heat. The spectral
properties of B. breve MCRA are consistent with a
recombinant MCRA protein from S. pyogenes, which
was found to contain a non-covalently bound FAD and
exhibited double bond hydratase activity producing
10- and 13-hydroxy fatty acids [1]. These data prompted
us to examine the enzymatic activity of B. breve MCRA
using common C16 and C18 fatty acids as substrates.
To this end, purified protein was incubated with free
fatty acids and the reaction products were analyzed by
GC-MS. Indeed, we observed conversion of palmitoleic,
oleic and linoleic acids to the corresponding 10-hydroxy
fatty acids (Figure 3 and Table 2), but myristoleic acid
or shorter monounsaturated fatty acids were not substrates. The presence of trans-double bonds as well as

Phylogenetic analysis

Figure 4 displays a phylogenetic analysis of MCRA
from B. breve NCIMB 702258 along with both

linoleate isomerase and oleate hydratase homologs.
The tree clearly illustrates distinct groupings of the
two sets of homologs. Interestingly, our MCRA protein
branches in between both groupings but appears to be
evolutionary closer to the hydratase group. This result
further supports our finding of the MCRA as fatty acid
hydratase.

Stress tolerance of MCRA-overproducing Lactococcus and
Corynebacterium

To determine if heterologous Lactococcus and Corynebacterium containing the mcra gene exhibited improved
stress tolerance, the heterologous cultures along with
vector controls of Lactococcus (pNZ8048) and Corynebacterium (pCLIK) were assayed for hydratase activity
by measuring 9-hydroxy fatty acids without and with
linoleic acid supplementation of the medium. Indeed,
those cultures that expressed MCRA/hydratase accumulated increasing amounts of 10-HOA and 10-HOE in
the culture medium (Additional file 5). Next, the heterologous cultures were exposed to heat (51°C × 30-40 min),
salt (3 M NaCl × 90 min - Lactococcus and 4.8 M NaCl ×
90 min - Corynebacterium) and solvent (3% (v/v) butanol
× 45-60 min) stresses. L. lactis pNZ8048 reduced in viability by 4 Log CFU/ml following heat stress at 51°C for
40 min, whereas L. lactis pEMYL1 only reduced in viability by 2 Log CFU/ml (Figure 5A, B). The difference in
survivability between C. glutamicum pCLIK and
pEMYC2 was ~0.5 Log CFU/ml when heat stressed at
51°C for 30 min, a decline in survivability by <0.5 Log
CFU/ml for L. lactis pEMYL1 and <1 Log CFU/ml for
C. glutamicum pCLIK (vector control).
Similarly, when induced L. lactis pNZ8048 was
exposed to solvent stress (3% (v/v) butanol), a decrease
in viability of >3.3 Log CFU/ml was observed, whereas
induced L. lactis pEMYL1 only decreased ~1.5 Log

Page 8 of 12

CFU/ml following 60 min in 3% (v/v) butanol, i.e. a difference of nearly 2 Log CFU/ml between the cultures
under identical conditions. C. glutamicum pEMYC2
exposed to 3% (v/v) butanol stress for 45 min survived
~ 0.75 Log CFU/ml better than the vector control
(pCLIK) (Figure 5C-E).
Upon confirming that the clones containing the
MCRA protein were less sensitive to heat and solvent
stresses, we examined the hypothesis that the protein
also protected the cultures from salt stress. Following
growth and induction by nisin (10 ng/ml at OD600 nm
~0.5) and additional growth for 1.5 h, L. lactis pNZ8048
(control) and pEMYL1 cultures were exposed to 3 M
NaCl for 90 min. However, no difference in salt tolerance was observed at concentrations of 3 M NaCl. A
similar observation was made for C. glutamicum pCLIK
and pEMYC2 which were grown in 4.8 M NaCl for 90
min. Both C. glutamicum control (pCLIK) and pEMYC2
cultures survived in 4.8 M NaCl for 90 min with no
apparent decline in viable numbers (Figure 5F, G).

Discussion
Several recent reports have linked MCRA and oleic acid
hydratase activity [1-3], which was first observed more
than forty years ago in Pseudomonas sp. [32]. However,
the significance of this hydratase activity for the bacterial host is not yet clearly established. Our study identified MCRA from B. breve as a FAD-containing
hydratase with an additional role in stress protection
(Figures 2 and 3, Table 2). Interestingly, a recent study
by O’Flaherty and Klaenhammer (2010) indicated a role
for MCRA in stress tolerance, cell wall division and
adherence to Caco-2 cells [33]. Furthermore, all three
characterized enzymes from this family are highly specific for free fatty acids as the previously characterized
linoleic acid isomerase from P. acnes [1,2,34]. Thus,
both enzyme activities seem to form a new class of
FAD-dependent fatty acid modifying enzymes. This finding may be even further supported by phylogenetic
groupings (Figure 4). Given the wide distribution of the
mcra gene between human pathogenic and commensal
bacteria, it could be speculated that it is not directly
linked to virulence but to a general stress protection,
which could also be useful for a pathogen i.e. increased
heat at the site of infection. Our study confirmed the
increased viability of heterologous Lactococcus and Corynebacterium transformed with the mcra gene during
heat and solvent stresses as a difference in viability of 2
Log CFU/ml following heat stress at 51°C for 40 min
and 3% (v/v) butanol stress for 60 min was observed
between L. lactis pEMYL1 and pNZ8048 (Figure 4A-E).
Likewise, the introduced MCRA improved the survivability of C. glutamicum by ~0.5 Log CFU/ml difference
between C. glutamicum pCLIK and pEMYL1 following

heat stress at 51°C for 30 min, and ~0.75 Log CFU/ml
following 3% (v/v) butanol stress for 45 min (Figure 5).
The same host, L. lactis NZ9800 has previously been
used for comparative studies of stress performance following transformation with the well known heat shock
protein GroESL in plasmid pNZ8048. Desmond et al.
(2004) [35] compared the viability of induced (nisin
10 ng/ml) and heat treated cells at 54°C for 30 min of
the same host L. lactis NZ9800 transformed with either
pNZ8048 or pNZ8048-GroESL. At that temperature,
both L. lactis pNZ8048 and un-induced L. lactis
pNZ8048-GroESL (pGRO1) reduced in viability by 4.0
log CFU/ml, whereas the induced L. lactis (pGRO1)
declined by 3.3 Log CFU/ml during the heat stress.
Furthermore, induced GroESL-overproducing L. lactis
(pGRO1) was able to grow and increase by 0.5 Log
CFU/ml during 5 h exposure to 0.5% (v/v) butanol,
compared with L. lactis (pNZ8048) and un-induced
L. lactis (pGRO1) which declined in viability after 1 h
(0.2 Log CFU/ml), a trend that continued over the 6 h
period of solvent challenge.

It has been reported that the response of cells to sublethal heat and ethanol exposure induce essentially identical stress responses because of the alteration in the
membrane fluidity by these stresses [36]. Heat and ethanol stresses cause similar changes to plasma membrane
protein composition, reducing the levels of plasma
membrane H+- ATPase protein and inducing the plasma
membrane-associated Hsp30. Both stresses also stimulate the activity of the fraction of H+-ATPase remaining
in the plasma membrane. The resulting enhancement to
catalysed proton efflux from the cell represents a considerable energy demand, yet may help to counteract
the adverse effects for homeostasis of the increased
membrane permeability that results from stress.

Conclusions
This study has shown that the MCRA protein in bifidobacteria is a FAD containing hydratase enzyme, which
may be catalysing the first step in CLA production in
this species, and has an additional function in bacterial
stress protection.
