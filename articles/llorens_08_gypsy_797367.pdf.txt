Abstract
Background: Sequences homologous to the gypsy retroelement from Drosophila melanogaster are
widely distributed among drosophilids. The structure of gypsy includes an open reading frame
resembling the retroviral gene env, which is responsible for the infectious properties of
retroviruses.
Results: In this study we report molecular and phylogeny analysis of the complete env gene from
ten species of the obscura group of the genus Drosophila and one species from the genus Scaptomyza.
Conclusion: The results indicate that in most cases env sequences could produce a functional Env
protein and therefore maintain the infectious capability of gypsy in these species.

Background
Gypsy (gypsyDm) is an endogenous retrovirus of D. melanogaster. Its structure is largely similar to the vertebrate retroviruses and it possesses infective properties [1-4].
Sequences homologous to gypsyDm are widely distributed
among Drosophila species, found in both the subgenus
Sophophora as well as in the subgenus Drosophila [5-9]. In
addition, they have been detected in some species of the
genus Scaptomyza [8,9]. The phylogenetic relationships
among gypsy sequences from Drosophila species is not be
always coincident with those of their hosts, which could
be indicative of horizontal transfer during evolutionary
history [6,7,9,10]. Horizontal transfer has been invoked
to explain the evolutionary patterns of several families of
transposable elements [11-15]. In some cases, such as the
P element, the horizontal transfer events are strongly doc-

umented [16-18]. However, the underlying mechanisms
to horizontal transfer remain elusive.
In the case of gypsyDm, the horizontal transfer could be
associated with the infectious properties of that element.
One way to evaluate the potential impact of the gypsy
infectious ability on the evolutionary history of gypsy
sequences from Drosophila, is to analyze the infective ability of gypsy homologous sequences from species other
than D. melanogaster.
The infectious ability of gypsyDm is associated with the
expression of a retroviral envelope-like protein encoded
by the env gene [2]. Structural analysis of the env region of
a given gypsy sequence is the first step in determining its
potential infectious ability. In previous reports, two com-

plete gypsy elements from D. subosbcura and D. virilis were
sequenced [10,19]. Although, the env region is preserved
in its full-length, in both species single indels result in
potentially truncated Env proteins [10]. However, as has
been proposed in [4], it is possible that both, defective
and complete fully functional gypsy elements, coexist in
the genome of these species. This study describes the existence of full-length env genes in the genomes of D. subosbcura and D. virilis, as well as in the genomes of the several
species closely related to D. melanogaster:D. simulans, D.
erecta, D. orena, D. teissieri, and D. yakuba. Interestingly,
these gyspy sequences can potentially invade the D. melanogaster genome, and escape the control normally exerted
by the flamenco gene, whose product represses mobility[4].
It is generally accepted that species of the obscura group
can be classified into five subgroups: the pseudobscura and
affinis subgroups, consisting of Neartic species, the subobscura and obscura subgroups, mainly consisting of Paleartic species, and the microlabis subgroup encompassing
Afrotropical species [20-22]. Gypsy sequences homologous to gypsyDm have been detected in several species of
the Neartic and Paleartic subgroups, appearing as a monophyletic group that is highly diverged from the gypsyDm
prototypic element [7,8]. With the exception of D.
guanche, the 5' region of the env gene in all species examined could potentially produce a functional N-terminal
region of the Env protein. To confirm the existence of
potentially infective gypsy lineages other than gypsyDm,
gypsyDs, and gypsyDv, we report here an analysis of the
complete env gene of ten species of the obscura group and
one species from the genus Scaptomyza. Most of the species
analyzed contain intact copies of the env region and the
env splicing sites, and in vitro can be translated into a protein of the predicted size.

studies, the complete gypsy elements from D. subobscura
and D. virilis have been sequenced [10]. These studies
were carried out to understand the evolutionary behaviour of gypsy and indicate that the genetic organization of
gypsy in those species is conserved. Moreover, in D. melanogaster do the gypsy elements have a complete functional
env gene [10]. In the case of D. virilis and D. subobscura, it
has been shown that the genomes of these species contain
at least one copy of gypsy putatively encoding a complete
envelope protein [4].
The main aim of this study is to examine whether potentially functional copies of the env region of gypsy exist in
other species. This was accomplished by searching
genomes for the presence of full-length env coding
sequences and assessing their functionality.
The analysis of the env sequences shows their infectious
capability
To analyze the infectious capability of the gypsy element of
each analyzed species (table 1) we amplified the env
region with specific primers designed from the intergenic
sequence (figure 1). In all species the size of the amplified
sequence was 1.5 kb, except for D. algonquin and D. tolteca,
with sizes of 0.5 and 1.2 kb respectively. The PCR products of all species, were cloned in pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and sequenced with the specific primers of the
vector, demonstrating that D. algonquin and D. tolteca had
a deletion of 1.5 kb and 0.3 kb respectively. In the same
way, D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda had deletions of 40
pb and 21 pb respectively that produced a stop codon and
an Env truncated protein. D. persimilis had a single nucleotide change, also producing a stop codon. In contrast, D.
madeirensis, D. obscura, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. affinis
and S. elmoi had different polymorphisms but none
resulting in a truncated protein, so these env regions
would produce potentially active proteins.

Results and discussion
Sequences homologous to gypsy from D. melanogaster are
widely distributed among Drosophila species. In previous

With these data, we can conclude that D. madeirensis, D.
obscura, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. affinis and S. elmoi

The major protein products obtained in this assay have
molecular weights corresponding to the expected size for
Env protein of D. melanogaster, about 54 kDa. These protein products were obtained in the same species where the
env nucleotide sequence was complete, without disruptions. We obtained complete Env protein from D. madeirensis, D. obscura, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. affinis and S.
elmoi, while we obtained truncated proteins from the species where the sequence was disrupted, D. pseudoobscura,
D. persimilis and D. miranda (figure 2).
In D. melanogaster, the splicing produces a start codon
using AT from 5' site in the gag region and a G from the 3'
site in the env region [2]. We have analyzed the sequences
from the different species of this study and only D. madeirensis, D. obscura, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. affinis and
S. elmoi, have conserved the sequences that produce the
start codon after the splicing.
These results show that these species contain at least one
copy of gypsy element that can encode an envelope protein. Other data that support the existence of functional
Env proteins include the presence of N-glycosylation sites,
conserved cysteine residues and endopeptidase cleavage
sites in all the species with a complete env sequence and
the ATG codon (figure 3), as described in [2,4]. Moreover,
those species have the sequence pattern (R-X(2)-R-X(5,6)[GE]-X(5)- [LV]-X-G-X(2)-D-X(2)-D) for the detection in
silico of endogenous retroviral envelope protein proposed
in [23]. Only the signal peptide and the membrane-spanning domain sequence show differences on comparing to
D. melanogaster gypsy sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/302

Although sequences have the capability to produce
complete envelope protein, their expression could be
repressed in the species studied
To demonstrate the capability of the gypsy elements to
produce an active envelope protein, we wanted to know if
the env gene was expressed in vivo in the species with the
complete env sequence.

In order to detect the production of the env mRNA we performed a RT-PCR analysis using the GS05 and GS06 primers with the mRNA extracted from ovarian chambers of
the female flies. Since we also wanted to detect alternative
splicing, necessary to produce ENV, we used the primers
GYPSY5'F and GS06 of the env gene using the same mRNA
as before (see materials and methods).
Amplification with the internal primers was successful in
all species analysed as well as in the positive control (data
not shown). However, alternative splicing was not
detected (data not shown). These results suggest that the
alternative splicing of gypsy in the obscura species group
and S. elmoi would be repressed by a genomic gene as
occurs in D. melanogaster with the flamenco gene [24].
Alternatively, the gypsy element may use an alternative
start codon to express the env region or we simply could
not detect the alternative splicing.
The gypsy phylogeny is not totally consistent with species
phylogeny
Since gypsy elements can potentially jump from one individual to another without the need of a vector, it has been
proposed that horizontal transfers of gypsy elements is
favoured by their ability to encoded full-length ENV proteins [4]. In this way we performed a phylogeny analysis
of the env gypsy sequences studied, looking for evidences
of horizontal transfer events.

A Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of envelope
sequences is shown in figure 4. The obscura sequences fall
into four main clades that are generally consistent with
species phylogeny. Clade A includes sequences from D.
affinis of the affinis subgroup; clade B, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. madeirensis, and D. obscura of the obscura subgroup; clade C, D. miranda, D. persimilis, and D.
pseudoobscura of the pseudoobscura subgroup; and clade D,
D. tolteca of the affinis subgroup. The D. virilis sequence is
responsible for the relatively low support for clade A;
removing the D. virilis sequence from the analysis
increases the bootstrap values to 98/77 for a grouping of
the D. hydei sequence with those from D. affinis, with the
rest of the topology unchanged. With the exception of the
placement of sequences from S. elmoi, the topology of this
tree is identical to that obtained by parsimony analysis,
which yielded a shortest tree of 1477 steps (Consistency
Index = 0.8; Retention Index = 0.9). The distribution of
sequence from D. affinis and D. tolteca into two distinct
clades is an unexpected result that is consistently seen in
all analyses. Constraining the analysis so that the
sequences from D. tolteca and D. affinis are monophyletic
adds an additional nine steps to the parsimony tree.
The potential effect of recombination on the phylogeny
was assessed by using the GARD algorithm, which uses
maximum likelihood models to detect recombination
events. The BIC model found no evidence of recombination, while the AIC model identifies a potential breakpoint at position 1288 in the 1392 character alignment.
The potential effect of this event on the phylogeny was
also examined using a sliding-window approach. Separate
phylogenetic analyses were constructed from four 400-bp
regions of the envelop alignments (positions 1–399; 400–
799; 800–1199; and 1200–1493), and on a fifth dataset
that excluded the region beyond the breakpoint. The latter
analysis resulted in an identical tree to that shown in figure 4, as did two of the four sliding window analyses. In
the other two sliding-window trees, the D. virilis sequence
was excluded from clade A, as it was in one of two alternate trees obtained from the AIC analyses. Regardless of
its precise affiliation, in an expanded phylogenetic analysis that includes 180 published gypsy sequences, D. virilis
clearly belongs to a well-supported clade that includes all
of the obscura sequences (see below).
Sequences from S. elmoi fall into clade B, in which they
form two subclades. Although not monophyletic, the
average amount of sequence divergence between the two
subclades is just 1.1%, and if the sequences from S. elmoi
are constrained to be monophyletic the total length of the
parsimony tree is unchanged. If the gypsy sequences from
S. elmoi are excluded from the analysis, the topology of the
obsucra sequences is unchanged from that shown in figure
4. To make the gypsy phylogeny conform completely to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/302

the species phylogeny (including S. elmoi as an outgroup,
a monophyletic clade that includes D. hydei and D. virilis,
and D. melanogaster as a sister taxon to the obscura
sequences) increases the parsimony tree length from 1477
to 1542 steps. Thus, there is clear incongruence between
the gypsy phylogeny and that of the species from which the
sequences were isolated.
The envelope sequences from S. elmoi differ on average by
only 2.1% from those found in the obscura species of clade
B. As a hallmark of horizontal transfer is the existence of
highly similar sequences in the genomes of divergent taxa
[15], transfer of gypsy from the obscura group to the genus
Scaptomyza seems likely. Because the sampling from S.
elmoi is quite extensive, an explanation of the retention of
an ancestral polymorphism for the phylogenetic incongruence seems unlikely. This conclusion is further supported by comparison to the divergence of a non-mobile
nuclear gene, Adh. Over exon 2 of this gene, the average
divergence between S. elmoi and the clade B Adh
sequences is 20.0%. A horizontal transfer involving the
genus Scaptomyza and the Palearctic members of the
obscura species group is of particular interest because of
the well-documented horizontal transfer of the P transposable element between these taxa [17]. In that case, the
direction of transfer was almost certainly from Scaptomyza
to D. bifasciata. In the case of gypsy, the phylogeny indicates a transfer in the opposite direction.
To provide some comparison to other studies of gypsy evolution, an extensive phylogenetic analysis was performed
with an enlarged dataset of 180 sequences, combining
those from this study with those of [9] and [26]. This
allows us to assess the coherence of the two clades, A and
B, which include postulated horizontal transfer events,
and to increase the sample size considerably to examine
the alternative hypothesis of ancient lineages. This tree is
presented in figure 5. The positions of the D. hydei, D. virilis and S. elmoi sequences remain unchanged from that
shown in figure 4, providing additional evidence to support the hypothesis of horizontal transfer.
Molecular evolutionary analysis of gypsy sequences is
consistent with activity
To examine the evidence for selection on the gypsy
sequences, the numbers of synonymous substitutions
(dS) and nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) were calculated for each sequence. The average dN/dS ratio was then
calculated for each clade (see table 2), providing some
indication of whether purifying selection is or has been
operating on these sequences. For all major clades, the
dN/dS ratio is similar to that obtained for non-mobile
nuclear genes [25]. Similar results have been obtained in
a number of studies of gypsy sequence evolution [6,8-10].
Together, these comparisons suggest that many gypsy ele-

ments are capable of activity, consistent with the expression data described above. Although the pattern is
consistent with activity (and potential infectivity), this
conclusion may be complicated by two factors: (i) codon
bias, which is lower for the gypsy sequences, when compared to Adh (data not shown), and (ii) the nature of
selection on the gypsy sequences which may include functional constraints on the RNA intermediate in addition to
selection for a functional envelop protein.
It is noteworthy that clade B includes the gypsy sequences
that have intact envelope genes (D. ambigua, D. bifasciata,
D. madeirensis, D. obscura, and S. elmoi), whereas clades D
and C consist of those with interrupted reading frames.
Clade A comprises sequences from the Neartic species D.
affinis, which also encode full-length envelope proteins
and are characterized by very low dN/dS ratios. It is fascinating that in the two clades with open envelope reading
frames and low dN/dS ratios, horizontal transfer has likely
occurred. Even though the gypsy sequences examined from
clade C are not likely functional, the low dN/dS ratio suggests that these elements have been active in the recent
past. The envelope coding regions of D. tolteca (clade D)
are characterized by a substantial deletion at the beginning of the envelope gene and relatively higher dN/dS
ratios, suggesting that they have been inactive for considerably longer than the clade C elements. Thus, the phylogenetic and sequence analyses together provide a
snapshot of the evolutionary history of gypsy in the obscura
species group that is consistent with their activity and
potential infectivity.
Horizontal transfer of gypsy has been suggested in other
studies: among sequences from the obscura group and D.
virilis/D. hydei, which belong to a different subgenus [7],
and within the melanogaster species group [6]. Two additional studies, which are similar is scope to the one
described here, concluded that horizontal transfer of gypsy
was fairly widespread among species in the genus Drosophila and sister genera [9,26]. As these studies included
a total of only three sequences from the obscura group,
they were not able to identify precisely the species

involved in the transfer events. In the analysis presented
here, the envelope sequence from D. hydei shows a strong
affiliation to the sequences from D. affinis; a less well-supported clade includes the sequences from D. virilis as well.
As the envelope sequences from D. hydei, D. virilis, and D.
affinis differ by an average of only 6.2%, and the species
sampling is now quite extensive (see figure 5), horizontal
transfer remains the best explanation for the incongruent
phylogeny. The hypothesis of horizontal transfer finds
additional support in a comparison of the divergence of
the envelop region to the non-mobile gene, Adh. The average divergence of Adh sequences from D. hydei/D. virilis
and D. affinis is 21.4% (clade A).
Using the values for synonymous nucleotide substitutions, [26] provided an estimate of 6.3 million years ago
(MYA) for a transfer from the obscura group (as represented by D. persimilis) to D. virilis. When a similar analysis is done with the D. affinis sequences (which are not
included in [26]), an estimate of only 2.7 MYA is obtained
for a transfer from D. affinis to D. hydei, and 3.1 MYA for
a transfer from D. affinis to D. virilis. In clade B, time estimates calculated from synonymous changes place the
transfer from the Paleartic obscura to S. elmoi at 2.1 MYA.
The fact that these transfers occurred relatively recently
supports the idea that at least some genomes in the obscura
group harbor active, infectious gypsy elements.

Conclusion
The genomes of six of the eleven species of analysed
encode intact copies of the envelop coding region of gypsy
and retain intact envelop splice sites. Their potential for
expression was analyzed in vitro and each was found to
encode a protein whose size is consistent with activity.
Moreover, these elements possess two additional features
of active gypsy genes, alternative splice sites and the use of
alternative start codons. Evolutionary analysis of the
envelop sequences shows that interspecies transfer of gypsy
is associated with those obscura elements that can encode
a functional envelop protein. Such horizontal transfer is
supported by the incongruence of the gypsy and species
phylogenies and by the low levels of gypsy divergence
when compared to the divergence of host genes from the
same species.

Methods
Drosophila and Scaptomyza stocks
Ten species from the obscura group (D. madeirensis, D.
obscura, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. miranda, D. affinis, D. algonquin, D. tolteca), and
one species from the Scaptomyza genus (S. elmoi) were analysed. All species were obtained from the Tucson Stock
Center (table 1).

PCR amplification of the env coding region
Genomic DNA from each species was prepared as in [7].
PCR was usually carried out using 100 ng of genomic
DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 10 mM dNTPs and 0.5 U
of Netenzyme DNA polymerase. The amplifications were
performed in a Eppendorf Mastercycler 5333 version
2.01.33-09. The amplified 1443-bp fragment contains a
short intergenic stretch, and the entire ORF3 region from
the gypsy element. The pairs of primers used to amplify the
env region in the differents species were (see figure 1):
ENV5'mad: 5'-AGTAGAGTTAGAATAACGTCC-3' and
GYPSY3': 5'-TRGCGMGTCAGCATTGTT-3' (where R is G
or A) for D. madeirensis, D. ambigua, D. bifasciata and S.
elmoi; ENV5'obs: 5'-ATTAGAGTTAGAACAACGT CT-3' and
GYPSY3' (see sequence above) for D. obscura;
ENV5'pseuaff: 5'-CTTAGAGTTAGAACACCGTCT-3' and
GYPSY3' for D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. affinis, D.
algonquin; ENV5'mir: 5'- CTTAGAGTTAGAACACCAT CT3' and GYPSY3' for D. miranda; ENV5'tol: 5'- CTTAGAGTTAGAACACCTTCT-3' and GYPSY3' for D. tolteca.

PCR conditions consisted of a single denaturing step at
94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
55–60°C for 1 min (depending on each primer), and
72°C for 1 min 30 s; a final extension was performed at
72°C for 10 min.
To amplify the 5' region of gypsy, which contains the env
splicing site, different primers, derived from alignments of
gypsy elements from D. subobscura, D. virilis and D. melanogaster were designed. The size of the amplified fragment
is 500 bp. The sequences of these primers were (see figure
1): GYPSY5'F: 5'-GCKWTGATGGCGTATGCATTG-3'
(where K is G or T and W is A or T) and GYPSY5'R: 5'YTATGCTGCCGAAAGTATGC-3' (where Y is C or T).
Cloning and DNA sequencing
PCR products were cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen). Eight clones from each species were sequenced in an
automatic ABI-Prism sequencer. The multiple alignments
of gypsy ORF3 sequences were performed with the program SEQUENCHER version 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corporation). The sequencing reactions were carried out with the
primers (see figure 1): ENV5' and GYPSY3' (see sequence
above) GS05, 5'-TAA TAC TCA CGA TAA CGT TGG-3' for
D. bifasciata, D. madeirensis and D. ambigua, GS04, 5'-TAA

Phylogenetic and sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using the default settings of ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/ and
were then refined by eye to correct obvious misalignments. The phylogeny of 64 gypsy sequences from the
obsura group and seven sequences from Scaptomyza elmoi
was examined using parsimony, distance, and maximum
likelihood methods as implemented by PAUP* 4.0b10.
Four additional gypsy sequences, from D. subobscura
[X72390], D. hydei [X74539], D. virilis [M38438], and D.
melanogaster [Z31368] were also included in the analysis.
A total of 1392 positions were analysed, with gaps treated
as missing data. Identical tree topologies were obtained
for all major clades using each method, and adjusting the
search parameters for each. The Neighbor-Joining tree
shown in figure 4 was constructed using the Kimura twoparameter model for nucleotide substitution. The parsimony analyses, which included 553 informative characters, used random addition of sequences (10 replicates)
and TBR branch swapping; both heuristic and branchand-bound searches yielded identical trees. The maximum-likelihood analyses used empirical base frequencies
and a substitution model in which all rates were equal.

Previous studies of gypsy phylogeny indicate that the gypsy
sequence from D. melanogaster is an appropriate outgroup
for phyolgenetic analysis of sequences from the obscura
group (e.g., [26]). The use of this taxon as an outgroup
was verified in two additional ways. First, it is clearly the
most divergent of the gypsy sequences, showing an average
distance of 36% (Kimura two-parameter method) from
the other sequences. Second, midpoint rooting with both
neighbor-joining and parsimony establish the root along
the D. melanogaster branch. Bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates for both parsimony and
Neighbor-Joining. Character state analyses and parsimony tree-length comparisons were determined with
MacClade 4.0.3. The potential effect of recombination on
the phylogenetic analyses was assessed with the GARD
method [27].
Molecular evolutionary analysis was implemented with
MEGA4 [28]. Nucleotide divergences were calculated
using the Kimura two-parameter method and the numbers of synonymous substitutions (dS) and nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) were calculated using the Nei
and Gojobori (1986) [29] codon model for the nucleotide
sequences that had been aligned based on amino acid
position. To facilitate comparisons, the alignments were
adjusted by eye to maintain homologous codon positions. Because of some variability in identifying the start
site in all sequences, the comparison began at a conserved
serine codon, which, in most sequences, is the eighth
amino acid of the envelope polypeptide. The divergence
of gypsy sequences was compared to those of a non-mobile

In vitro translation of the Env proteins
To generate PCR products for in vitro protein expression,
special primers, consisting of two different parts, were
designed. The first half adds regulatory elements necessary
for expression in a prokaryotic system, such as a T7 promoter, the ribosomal binding site and the T7 terminator.
The second half recognizes a specific region of env, which
corresponds to the sequence used to amplify the env
region in the different species (see sequences above). This
PCR product can be expressed directly in E. coli HY using
the Rapid Translation System (RTS) from Roche. The E.
coli Linear Template Generation Set, His-tag and the RTS
100 E. coli HY (both purchased from Roche), were used to
detect mutations that lead to the termination of mRNA
translation and subsequently to protein truncation. The
translation products were separated by discontinuous
SDS-PAGE through a 12% separating gel with Tris-glycine
buffer. The signals were detected by colourimetric system.

RT-PCR env amplification
RNA extractions were carried out using approximately 100
mg of flies. These RNA extractions were carried out with
the QuickPrep™ Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham
Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Afterwards, the mRNA was treated with RQ1 RNasefree DNase (Promega) to remove remainder DNA of the
sample. RNA obtained was reverse transcribed in the presence of AMV-RT (Promega) and the env-specific primer
GS06 (see sequences above).

Reactions were carried out at 37°C for 2 hours followed
by 10 minute at 65°C to denature the enzyme. From the
first strand reaction, 2 μl was used as a template in PCR
using the following primers: GS05, for D. bifasciata, D.
madeirensis and D. ambigua, GS04, for D. affinis and GS06
(see sequences above) for all species (figure 1).

To analyse the alternative splicing product, the RNA
obtained was reverse transcribed and amplified with GS05
and the primer GS06.
