Abstract
Background: Variations in the influenza Hemagglutinin protein contributes to antigenic drift
resulting in decreased efficiency of seasonal influenza vaccines and escape from host immune
response. We performed an in silico study to determine characteristics of novel variable and
conserved motifs in the Hemagglutinin protein from previously reported H3N2 strains isolated
from Hong Kong from 1968–1999 to predict viral motifs involved in significant biological functions.
Results: 14 MEME blocks were generated and comparative analysis of the MEME blocks identified
blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7 to correlate with several biological functions. Analysis of the different
Hemagglutinin sequences elucidated that the single block 7 has the highest frequency of amino acid
substitution and the highest number of co-mutating pairs. MEME 2 showed intermediate variability
and MEME 1 was the most conserved. Interestingly, MEME blocks 2 and 7 had the highest incidence
of potential post-translational modifications sites including phosphorylation sites, ASN
glycosylation motifs and N-myristylation sites. Similarly, these 2 blocks overlap with previously
identified antigenic sites and receptor binding sites.
Conclusion: Our study identifies motifs in the Hemagglutinin protein with different amino acid
substitution frequencies over a 31 years period, and derives relevant functional characteristics by
correlation of these motifs with potential post-translational modifications sites, antigenic and
receptor binding sites.

Background
Molecular and viral characterization of the hemagglutinin
protein (HA) from different hosts has increased in the last
three decades, in response to three worldwide outbreaks
of influenza in the years 1918, 1957, and 1968 [1]. The
H3N2 antigenic subtype responsible for the 1968 pandemic was first isolated in July 1968 in Hong Kong, and

supplanted the H2N2 virus responsible for the 1957 Asian
flu pandemic[2,1].
Bioinformatics and computational approaches towards
molecular understanding of HA have largely focused on
the determination of mutation levels and evolution of the
HA gene, and identification and prediction of antigenic

variants of H3N2 by locating potential immunodominant
positions on the HA protein. Phylogenetic analysis of
H3N2 genomes illustrates that the H3N2 virus is composed of multiple and distinct clades, which exhibit
genetic variation by interacting with minor lineages
through reassortment events [2]. Whole-genome alignments, statistical analysis with construction of evolutionary trees were used to identify locations of mutations
within H3N2, predict their yearly frequency, and determine modes of antigenic drift and positive selection [2].
Using a parsimonious tree to map the HA1 domain of 254
H3N2 viral genes, Fitch and coworkers determined that
HA1 evolves at an average rate of 5.7 nucleotide substitutions/year, and indicated the presence of six hypervariable
codons of the HA gene which accumulate replacement
substitutions at a rate that is 7.2 times that of other codons
[3]. Some studies have concluded that H3 hemagglutinin
gene exhibits positive selection in key regions of the HA
molecule such as the receptor-binding site and antibodybinding sites [4], which result in new antigenic and resistant strains. Several studies used bioinformatics approach
to predict antigenic strains of the H3N2 virus [5-7]. One
study generated a model based on 131 positions in the
five antigenic sites of the protein, and which could predict
antigenic variants of H3N2 with an agreement rate of 83%
to existing serological data [5]. Later studies also identified twenty amino acids positions, which are potential
immunodominant positions and contribute to antigenic
difference between strains [6].
To the best of our knowledge, few bioinformatics publications have addressed motif search in segments of the
H3N2 genome where mutations have been observed. A
recent study by Ahn and Son [7] aimed to detect relative
synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and codon usage patterns (CUP) in HA and Neuraminidase (NA) from H3N2,
H9N2, and H5N1 subtypes within human, avian, and
swine populations. They established a unique CUP for
each subtype, and observed a possible divergence within
human H3N2 isolates based on their synonymous CUPs.
A study published earlier this year [8] has focused specifically on the H3N2 subtype, using nucleotide co-occurrence networks of human H3N2 strains to predict H3N2
evolution. However, analysis of H3N2 nucleotide and
protein genomes to discover patterns and motifs yet
remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report motifs
and assign potential functional characteristics within the
HA protein sequences of the gene of H3N2 human influenza isolates from Hong Kong between 1968 and 1999.
We identify motifs within the HA protein, and interrelate
these motifs with amino acid substitutions frequency, comutating pairs, potential post-translation modification
sites, antigenic sites, receptor-binding sites. We focus our
analysis on motifs with varying mutation frequency and
correlate the variable motif with a high number of poten-

tial post-translational modification sites that overlap antigenic and receptor binding sites. We speculate that
mutation in these motifs results in the emergence of viral
strains that are highly pathogenic and has the intrinsic
character to overcome that host defense mechanisms.

Results
14 MEME Blocks identified from HA1 consensus
sequences; representatives of strains isolated from 1968 to
1999
Submission of the 17 HA1 consensus sequences generated
from the nucleotide GenBank accession numbers (refer to
the material and methods section) to the MEME server has
generated 50 protein motifs from which we selected 14
MEME blocks which are common to the entire data set
(Figure 1), with the exception of block 14 which occurs in
only 16 of the 17 sequences. All the observed blocks had
a p value < 0.0001. MEME blocks 1 and 2 occur 3 times
over the entire protein sequence with a motif size of 41
and 29 amino acids respectively. MEME blocks 3, 5, 9 and
10 occur twice over the entire amino acid sequence with a
motif size of 35, 21, 15 and 11 respectively. The remaining
MEME blocks occur only once with varying motif sizes of
4–50 amino acids. Table 1 shows the location of each
block within the HA sequence. Notably, all of the blocks
occur at least once within the HA1 domain (17–344) with
the exception of blocks 8 and 14, which only occurs in
HA2.
Genetic distance and entropy analysis of MEME blocks
reveals variable and conserved motifs
Amino acid substitutions over the 1968–1999 data set
were extracted from the multiple sequence alignment
using MEGA 4.0 [9]. The numbers of amino acid substitutions in the 17 consensus sequence were determined by
Infoalign and are tabulated in Table 2. We compared the
percent change in amino acid substitution (mutation frequency) in the Hong Kong data set from 1968–1999 and
calculated the genetic distance. Two of the years, investigated in our study, showed significant amino acid substitutions; in 1975 fifteen amino acid substitutions are
observed with a 2.65 percent change from 1974 and in
1983 thirteen amino acid substitutions are observed with
~2.3 percent change from 1982 (Table 2). Association
between amino acids substitution and the MEME blocks
were determined and are represented in Figure 2a. We
subdivided the blocks into 3 categories based on the
genetic distance (Figure 2a); highly variable motifs
include MEME blocks 7, 11, and 13, highly conserved
motifs include blocks 1 and 8, and the rest of the MEME
motifs showed intermediate variability (Table 2).

In an attempt to establish the relationship between blocks
and amino acids substitutions over the time period
between 1968–1999, a line graph was drawn to examine

the mutation rate of each of the MEME blocks, in order to
infer the evolutionary behavior of the motifs (i.e. whether
they were acted upon by positive selection or neutral
genetic drift evolution). The frequency of amino acid substitutions within the highly variable MEME block 7 (Figure 2b) largely follows the occurrence pattern of
substitutions within the entire protein (Table 2), reaching

a peak in 1980, which corresponds to a year with a high
number of mutations in the alignment, and following a
similar zenith in 1985. However, for the intermediately
variable MEME block 2, not all the mutations within each
year of the alignment occur in the block, resulting in a zigzag behavior from 1982 onwards (Figure 2c). Some
blocks only undergo amino acids substitutions in one or

as a 40 amino acid block containing more than 35% of
amino acid substitutions. The first part of hot spot cluster
I between amino acid position 140–154, is included
within MEME block 7 (130–170). The second part of hot
spot cluster I, between position 170–180, overlaps MEME
block 11 entirely (171–178) and with one of the repetitive
MEME block 2 (179–207). Hot spot cluster II overlaps
entirely MEME block 13 (209–214) and almost entirely
MEME block 3 (215–249). The two significant hot spots
of variability were confirmed by looking at conserved
regions generated by BIOEDIT, with a minimum length of
15 amino acids and maximum entropy 0.2, and this
region did not overlap with the conserved region analysis
(data not shown).

(data not shown). MEME block 5 undergo amino acids
substitutions from 1968 to 1984, then remain conserved
after this period (data not shown). Similarly, MEME block
10 is conserved after 1984 with an exception of an amino
acid substitution in 1992 (data not shown). Additionally,
certain blocks remain conserved for a few years of the
cohort, but undergo amino acids substitutions towards
the later years of the study. Notable examples include
blocks 6, 9, and 13 (data not shown). The MEME program
lists the HA MEME blocks in descending order based on
their e-value, as such, MEME blocks 2 and 7 are quite significant and plausible for further analysis.
To confirm these finding, we correlated hot spots of variability with MEME blocks, using an entropy plot of the
HA alignment (Figure 3). Hot spots of variability are clustered around amino acid position 140–190, and 200–
240. Through out this study, we define a hot spot cluster

Potential post-translational modification sites in HA
protein
Scanning the 17 consensus sequence against the existing
Prosite Motifs database (PPSearch) revealed five potential
post-translational modification sites. The sites detected
include 24 phosphorylation, 12 glycosylation and 14
myristylation sites (Table 3). 7 of the potential phosphorylation sites are Casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation
sites encompassing different region of the protein. One
study has previously reported a CKII phosphorylation
domain [10]. 16 of the potential phosphorylation sites are
Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site encompassing different regions of the protein. The clustering of the
PKC phosphorylation site is at position 152–224 (9/16
sites are in this region) in contrast to the clustering of CKII
phosphorylation site from position 416–459); it is worth
noting that CKII phosphorylation clustering is followed
by two PKC phosphorylation sites. One cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site
was identified at position 156–159 (within the single
MEME block 7).

Of the 12 ASN glycosylation sites found under PPSearch 7
ASN glycosylation sites have been have been cross-referenced to potential sites of HA in the Uniprot KnowledgeBase, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Entry Q91MA7. Of these 7
ASN glycosylation, 5 remain conserved in all years of the
data set. Interestingly, 4 ASN glycosylation sites noted by
Skehel and co-workers [11] overlap our 2 prominent
MEME blocks; 4 ASN glycosylation sites (amino acids 24–
27, 38–41, 181–184 and 499–503) overlaps MEME 2
block, and 3 overlaps MEME 7 block (amino acids 138–
141, 142–148 and 149–152).
Additionally, 9 of the 14 N-myristylation sites are in
MEME blocks 1, 2 and 7. Four sites overlap with MEME
block 7, three sites with MEME block1, and two sites with
MEME block 2. Interestingly, some of these post-translational modification sites are conserved over the years as is

Using ClustalW alignment the number of observed substitutions for each of the consensus sequence and the equivalent years are tabulated using
Infoalign. The highest aminoacid substitution (29 aa substitutions over the entire sequence) was in Years 1980. The genetic distance in each MEME
block is calculated showing that MEME blocks 1 and 8 are conserved (bold), MEME blocks 7, 11 and 13 are highly variable and the other MEME
blocks show intermediate variability.

the case with the majority of the phosphorylation sites
(>70%), while more than 50% of the glycosylation and
myristylation sites are observed in selected years (Table
3). Experimental studies need to be performed to confirm
these potential post-translational modification sites.

Entropy 3
Entropy plot of the protein consensus ClustalW
alignment. Amino acid positions that do not exhibit any
changes over the years have entropy of 0, whereas positions
of high variability are represented by peak in the plot. Two
hot spots of variability were observed and are clustered
around amino acid position 140–190, and 200–240. The
entropy analysis was performed for the entire hemagglutinin
sequence (560 amino acids), but at amino acid position 340
(HA2) the analysis does not exhibit much entropy.

Relationship between post-translational modification
sites, MEME blocks, amino acid substitutions and entropy
It was observed that MEME block 7, 2 and 1 contain the
greatest number of post-translational modification sites
(Prosite motifs) (Figure 4). It is worth noting that only
one cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site
was observed in the dataset, within MEME block 7 and its
frequency is therefore not tabulated. An analysis of other
post-translational modification sites shows that PKC sites
occur mainly within Blocks 2, 3 and 7 while most of the
ASN glycosylation sites appear within block 2 and 7 and
most myristylation sites appear in MEME block 7 (Figure
4).

CKII sites were detected in MEME blocks 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and
12; MEME blocks 1, 5 and 9 CKII sites have zero entropy.
Unlike other MEME blocks, nearly all of CKII sites at
MEME block 2 and 7 have non-zero entropy. One CKII
site (position 205-entropy value 1.2) at MEME block 2 is
also involved in the co-mutating pair (see below). These
results illustrates that despite the high number of potential CKII sites at the highly conserved MEME 1 these sites
remain conserved (Figure 5a) and the variable MEME
block 2 and 7 undergo amino acid substitutions in CKII
sites.
PKC sites were detected in MEME blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
10 and 11. The conserved MEME blocks 1 and 4 posses
PKC sites with zero entropy. The majority of MEME blocks
2 and 3 PKC sites have zero entropy. One amino acid posi-

of all of PKC's sites. Unsurprisingly, none of the PKC sites
at MEME block 11 have zero entropy. The highly variable

at MEME block 7 are a part of the co-mutating pairs (see
below).
ASN glycosylation sites were detected in MEME blocks 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9. MEME blocks 4 and 5 have zero entropy
at all of their ASN sites. MEME block 2, 6 and 9 have
nonzero entropy at the majority of their ASN sites. MEME
block 1 and 7 are the only blocks with the majority of
their glycosylation sites possessing nonzero entropy. Surprisingly, the conserved MEME block 1 also contains the
amino acid (position 99) with the highest entropy (Figure
5c); this position is also the amino acid participating in
the co-mutation pairs (see below). Additionally, one of
the highly variable MEME block 7 N-glycosylation site is
also involved in the co-mutation pairs (see below).
Myristylation sites were detected in MEME block 1, 2, 4, 7,
and 9. MEME block 1, 2, 4, and 9 have the majority of
their myristylation sites possessing zero entropy, in fact all
myristylation sites at MEME block 4 have zero entropy,
while all but 1 and 2 sites in MEME block 1 and 2, respectively have nonzero entropy (Figure 5d). One of the myristylation sites at MEME block 1, with a relatively high
entropy (0.87), is involved in co-mutating pairs (see
below).
Relationship between the high frequency mutation MEME
Blocks and previously reported antigenic and receptorbinding sites
MEME blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7 were found to overlap with 4
previously identified antigenic sites (Table 4) [12]. The
entire antigenic A site (143–146) was contained within
MEME block 7 and overlap a potential phosphorylation

site (CKII). The entire antigenic B site (187–196) was contained within one of the repetitive MEME block 2 (179–
207) and also contains a potential phosphorylation site
(PKC). Notably, antigenic site A also overlaps a hot spot
cluster (140–154). As opposed to sites A and B, antigenic
sites C and D are represented as single amino acid substitutions. Many of these sites are contained in MEME blocks
1, 2, 3, and 7, with more than 1/5 of the sites in block 2
alone. 43% of antigenic sites in blocks 2 and 80% of antigenic sites in MEME block 3 are also part of a hot spot
cluster (200–240). Several of antigenic sites C have a relatively high entropy (over 1), as amino acid position 78
and 205 (data not shown).
In addition, we correlated the receptor binding sites
described by Skehel and Wiley (2000) with MEME blocks.
Interestingly, 4 of these receptor binding sites overlap the
variable MEME block 7 and the intermediately variable
MEME block 2 (Table 5). The receptor binding sites
described by Skehel and Wiley (2000) and their overlapping MEME motifs 1, 2, and 7 are presented in Table 5.
Based on overlapping MEME blocks with hot spots, frequency of amino-acid substitutions, potential post-translational modification sites, receptor-binding sites and
antigenic sites we mapped MEME blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7
onto the 3D hemagglutinin structure determined by
Fleury and co-workers [13]. Antigenic sites A-D were also
mapped for comparison and clarity [11]. Mapping MEME
blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7 onto the existing 3-D hemagglutinin
structure revealed that these blocks lie on the surface of
the protein (Figure 6), specifically on the characteristic 8
beta antiparallel strands of the protein.

Discussion
As opposed to previous molecular and computational
approaches to understanding the dynamic nature of the
human H3N2 influenza strain, our approach is one of few
that attempts to understand and determine the functional
importance of variable and conserved motifs in the
hemagglutinin protein over time. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study that addresses different
regions in detail, and recognizes novel motifs and identifies their key functional significance with respect to potential post-translational modification sites, co-mutating
amino acid pairs, antigenic and receptor binding sites.

modification (prosite) motifs implicated in each of
the MEME blocks. MEME block 7 has the highest number
of post-translational modification sites, followed by MEME
block 2, 1 and 3 respectively. High frequency of post-translational modification site was recorded when a frequency of 2
or above is observed. Frequency of potential protein kinase

that MEME block 3, 2 and 7 have a high PKC sites frequency.
Frequency of potential N-myristilation site in the MEME

that MEME block 1 and 2 have a high CKII sites frequency.

= 0.481894). 107 pairs based on 24 analyzed positions
were generated. Of these, 77 pairs contained at least one
amino acid within MEME blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7. MEME
block 7 contained 66% of these pairs at amino acid position 140-151-153-159-160-161 (Table 6). Interestingly, 4
out of the 6 amino acid positions at MEME block 7 participating in the co-mutating pairs, are potential PKC sites.
Additionally, amino acid positions 151 participating in
the co-occurring pairs of mutations at MEME block 7 is a
potential glycosylation sites. Surprisingly, the highly conserved MEME block 1 participated in co-occurring pairs of
mutations in 2 amino acid positions (99 and 363) a glycosylation and a myristylation site, respectively. The highly
variable MEME block 11 (171-172-174-176) participated
with 4 sites in the co-occurring mutation pairs (Table 6).
Interestingly, MEME blocks 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 12 had no
co-occurring pairs of mutations (Table 6).

In this study we have utilized 17 HA consensus sequences
generated from 32 Hong Kong H3N2 isolates spanning
the years from 1968 and 1999. We identified 14 MEME
blocks, with the clustering of blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7 between
positions 85–250 and 430–550 (Figure 6). We correlated
the MEME blocks with rates of amino acid substitution
and genetic distance. We also utilized entropy plots to
determine the clustering of hot spot variability sites. We
determined potential post-translational modification
sites and correlated their positions and frequencies to
MEME blocks, frequency of amino acid substitutions,
antigenic sites and receptor binding sites. Out of the 14
MEME blocks, MEME blocks 1, 2 and 3 co-occur more
than once within the HA protein and MEME block 7 is a
single block. These blocks have different amino acid substitution frequency and encompass different hot spot clusters, post-translational modification sites, antigenic sites
and receptor-binding sites. Of these highlighted blocks,
MEME 2 had multiple interesting characteristics. This
block (29 amino acids) is repeated three times at positions 14–42, 179–207 and 478–506 of the HA protein,
and was characterized as an intermediate mutation frequency block (Figure 1). The repetitive nature of this
motif could represent multiple binding pockets and could
infer specificity to different proteins. Alternatively, such
repetitive motif in the HA1 and HA2 subunits suggest
common function in the 2 subunits possibly in guiding
receptor binding and membrane fusion. A time course
analysis to determine the frequency of substitution over
the years was performed and lacked a distinct pattern in its
amino acid substitution resulting in a zigzag behavior
from 1982 onwards (Figure 2c). Additionally, MEME
block 2 had one of the highest post-translational modification frequency; having the highest ASN-glycosylation
frequency. It was previously reported that the addition of
new oligosaccharides to the HA of the H3N2 viruses contributes to the virus ability to elude antibody pressures by
changing its antigenic potential [15]. Alterations in HA
glycosylation may affect NK cell recognition of influenza
virus-infected cells [16]. Additionally, recently circulating
avian influenza viruses (H5 and H9 subtypes) mutate at
selected N-linked glycosylation sites [14].

Figure entropy of specific post-translational modification sites in each of the MEME blocks is demonstrated using boxplot
Average5
Average entropy of specific post-translational modification sites in each of the MEME blocks is demonstrated
using boxplot. (A) Average entropy of potential CKII phosphorylation sites in the MEME blocks. Blocks 1, 5 and 9 have zero
entropy at all CKII sites. The majority of MEME blocks 2 and 7 CKII sites have nonzero entropy. One of the MEME block 2
CKII sites (amino acid 205) has the largest entropy (1.24) among all of CKII's sites. The average entropy over MEME block 7
and 2 CKII sites is therefore higher than for any other block. MEME block 1 has a wider boxplot than the others, indicating
more CKII sites in this block. (B) Average entropy of potential PKC phosphorylation site in the MEME blocks. MEME block 1
and 4 have zero entropy at all their PKC sites. The highest PKC entropy values were observed in MEME block 2 (amino acid
205) and MEME block 7 (amino acid 160) with 1.2 entropy values. MEME block 5, 7 and 11 are unusual in that very few of their
PKC sites have zero entropy. MEME block 11 then 7 PKC sites have the highest average entropy. The width of the boxplots
indicates that more PKC sites are observed in MEME sites 2, 3 and 7 respectively. (C) Average entropy of potential N-glycosylation site in the MEME blocks. MEME blocks 4 and 5 have zero entropy at all of their ASN sites. MEME block 2, 6 and 9 have
nonzero entropy at the majority of their ASN sites. One of the ASN sites (amino acid 99) from MEME block 1 has the highest
entropy (1.003) among all ASN sites. The width of the boxplots indicates that more N-glycosylation sites are observed in
MEME sites 2 and 7 respectively (D) Average entropy of potential N-myristylation site in the MEME blocks. MEME blocks 1, 2,
4, and 9 have the majority of their myristylation sites possessing zero entropy. The highest myristylation sites entropy is at
MEME block 9 and 7 (Amino acid 78 and 160 respectively) with an approximate entropy value of 1.2. MEME block 1 and 7 have
more N-myristylation sites than any other block, although MEME block 2 also has a fairly large number of myristylation sites.

MEME block 2 also encompasses the entire length of antigenic site B, and 1/5 of antigenic sites C and D in HA are
present in this block (Table 4). Three receptor binding
sites overlap this block (Table 5). A high number of co-

occurring pairs of mutation was also observed in this
block (Table 6). Mutation of glycosylation sites near
receptor binding sites of HA1 was proposed to be an adaptation mechanism of the H7 viruses to a new host [18].

and tabulated with overlapping MEME motif, entropy values and posttranslational modifications sites. Site A average entropy is based on
amino acid position 144 and 145, while site B average entropy is
based on amino acid position 188 and 189.

These associations suggest that MEME block 2 is a

tional modification, enhance pathogenicity by mutating
receptor binding sites and escaping the host immune
response by mutation in antigenic sites.
Additionally, we have identified MEME block 7 (41
amino acids) at position 130–170 (Table 1) as high mutation frequency block (Figure 1). Contrary to MEME 2
block, MEME block 7 revealed a peak frequency of substitution in 1980, corresponding to one of the years with a
high mutation rate and therefore this block largely follows
the occurrence pattern of substitutions within the entire
protein (Figure 2b). However, the overlap between this
block and one of the largest hot spots of variability
revealed by the entropy plot, namely, the second cluster of
hot spots, indicates that increased numbers of mutations
within this block is not coincidental (Figure 3). MEME
block 7 contained more than 35% of co-mutating pairs
(Table 6). This block had the highest post-translational
modification frequency (Figure 4), with the highest
number of N-myristylation sites (Figure 5b). The entire
length of antigenic site A is contained within MEME block
7 (Table 4) and therefore its rapid mutation is a mechanism by the virus to hide from the immune system.
The prevalence of post-translational sites in MEME blocks
of high variability, and the lack of conservation observed
within post-translational modification sites indicate their
importance in sustaining the virus against environmental
factors, contribution to viral spread and pathogenicity,
and ultimately increasing viral virulence. Increased muta-

tions within ASN-glycosylation sites between our 1968–
1999 cohort, is consistent with previous studies, which
suggest that increased glycosylation sites attenuates H3N2
viral activity [14]. It was previously reported that the addition of new oligosaccharide to the HA of the H3N2 virus
contributes to the virus ability to elude antibody pressure
by changing its antigenic potential [15]. Indeed, several
studies have addressed the effect of glycosylation on the
binding affinity of HA with sialic acid (SA)-containing
receptors [16]. A study of reassortment viruses with different H3 HA on naïve mice has shown that, when matched
to HK68 NA molecules, viruses with HK68 (7 potential

sites) were more virulent than viruses with 12 potential
sites (Pan99), and required 3 logs less virus to kill the
mice [19]. Another study showed that mutant HA with 3–
6 glycosylation sites decreases receptor-binding activity
[15]. Additionally, a balance of glycosylation is needed to
mediate the interaction of HA and NA molecules for
receptor binding activity and viral release [15].
The importance of other post-translational sites that we
have observed, such as myristylation sites, is seconded by
several studies on the biological role of oligosaccharides
and lipid modifications of proteins involved in protein

translocation. Myristylation is one of 3 protein lipid modifications which are evolutionarily conserved in plants,
animals, and fungi, and which aid in targeting proteins to
the plasma membrane and other sub-cellular compartments [16]. Our study of several potential myristylation
sites in MEME block 7 and the exhibition of high variability in these sites imply a mechanism by the virus to escape
from neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, the
abundance of myristylation sites in the conserved MEME
block 1 and their conservation in the years studied, in
addition to its overlap with a single receptor binding site
infers block 1 importance in selective and specific receptor
binding and host cell attachment and infers conservation
of essential functions through evolution. Unsurprisingly,
minimal post-translational sites were observed in this unvariable block 1. However, the few glycosylation sites
observed in MEME block 1 are not conserved and in fact
contains the ASN site with the highest entropy and its
involvement in the co-mutating pairs suggests specific and
selected base pair substitutions over the years. The relatively high co-mutating pairs in this block remain unexplained. Interestingly, the minimal overlap of this
conserved site with previously reported antigenic sites
[12] is also in agreement with the conserved nature of this
site.
The HA protein is on the surface of the influenza particle
and is involved in receptor attachment and binding and
antigenic determinants. This study reports unique regions
in the protein that undergo either high mutation rates to
possibly acquire new characteristics by post-translational
modification or remain conserved for specific viral functional characteristics. Such changes are expected to
enhance the ability of the virus in receptor binding,
increase its infective state and escape the host immune
response by modification of its antigenic sites. The
dynamic evolution of a potentially functional motifs of
the HA protein in H3N2 Hong Kong Influenza A virus
strains, as revealed by bioinformatics analysis, paves the
way for future experimental analysis to determine the significance of these post-translational modification sites
and the effect of these alterations on receptor binding and
antigenic determinants functions. Because of the worldwide flow in the H3N2 seasonal virus strain and the
recently proposed limited mutation of the out of region
circulating virus [22] further experimental analysis to
appreciate the importance of the variable MEME motif 2
and 7 and the conserved MEME motif 1 in viral pathogenesis is required.

Methods
Protein Sequences
Sequence files in the FASTA format were collected from
the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) Influenza
virus resource website [23,24], a specialized database

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/91

based on the NCBI Genbank database. A total of 34 fulllength annotated strains of the HA segment of Hong Kong
H3N2 isolates between 1968 and 1999 were used in this
study. The utilized HA accession numbers and the equivalent year they were isolated are 1968 [RefSeq:AAK51718,
ABQ97200], 1969 [RefSeq:ABB80034], 1971 [RefSeq:ABB82227], 1972 [RefSeqs:ABB80023, ABB04371],
1973 [RefSeqs:ABB04338, ABD60790], 1974 [RefSeqs:ABC40619, ABB04294], 1975 [RefSeq:ABB04928],
1980 [RefSeqs:ABB04283, ABB46547], 1982 [RefSeq:ABB46403], 1983 [RefSeqs:ABB04939, ABB04917,

[RefSeq:ABB04327, ABB04305, ABB04349], 1987 [RefSeq:ABB04360], 1988 [RefSeq:ABB04316], 1989 [RefSeq:AAT64734],

AAK62042, AAK63817, AAK63819, AAK63821]. Using
the ClustalW alignment tool [17] a protein consensus
sequences was generated for each year as representatives
of the entire set of isolates. Seventeen consensus
sequences were generated, with an average length of 566
amino acids each.
Motif and protein modification site prediction in the HA1
protein
Seventeen consensus sequences were submitted into the
MEME program [18] to search for motifs that are common
to all sequences. A maximum of 50 MEME blocks were
generated a motif size varying between 2 and 50 amino
acids. Of these, blocks we selected 14 motifs for further
analysis that occurred at more than 94% of the sequences.

Consensus sequences were submitted into the PPSearch
(Protein Motifs Search) [19] tool available at the European Bioinformatics Institute website. This revealed several post-translation modification sites within the HA1
and HA2 domains. Findings were compared to other
motif finding applications including PROSITE under the
Expasy Server, PSite, and the ELM database. MEME blocks
were also submitted into MAST to determine their functional significance [20]. Additionally, the 1968 consensus
sequence was queried against the BLOCKS [21] and
PRINTS [21] database to check for the existence of known
protein motifs.
Tabulation of Amino Acid Substitutions and Hot Spots of
Variation
Consensus sequences were aligned using the ClustalW
multiple alignment tool. Using both the 1968 sequence as
a base year, and performing pairwise alignments for each
two consecutive years using the LALIGN program of the
EMBOSS package [22], the percent change and the
number of amino acid substitutions were calculated using
the Info align tool. MEGA 4.0 was used to calculate the
genetic distances of the HA gene and protein using the

Kimura two parameter model and Poisson correction
model respectively with gamma-distribution rate across
sites [9]. The consensus years that exhibited the greatest
frequency of substitutions in the alignment were determined. An entropy plot of the alignment was generated to
highlight hot spots of variability. Additionally, conserved
regions were determined using BIOEDIT [23], and
mapped to MEME blocks and functional motifs.
Co-occurring pairs of mutations
The ClustalW alignment of the 17 consensus sequence
from each year was submitted into CRASP [24] to determine significantly correlated pairs of amino acids which
co-mutate within the alignment. Correlating pairs were
determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient
matrix based on the average accessibility surface area of
the amino acids, at a significance level of 95%. The overlap between significantly co-mutating pairs with the
MEME blocks was determined and are illustrated in table
