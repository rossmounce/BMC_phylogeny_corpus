Abstract
Background: In the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization
have been proposed as important processes driving the retention of duplicated genes in the genome. These processes are
thought to occur by gain or loss of regulatory elements in the promoters of duplicated genes. We tested the DDC model by
determining the transcriptional induction of fatty acid-binding proteins (Fabps) genes by dietary fatty acids (FAs) in zebrafish. We
chose zebrafish for this study for two reasons: extensive bioinformatics resources are available for zebrafish at zfin.org and
zebrafish contains many duplicated genes owing to a whole genome duplication event that occurred early in the ray-finned fish
lineage approximately 230-400 million years ago. Adult zebrafish were fed diets containing either fish oil (12% lipid, rich in highly
unsaturated fatty acid), sunflower oil (12% lipid, rich in linoleic acid), linseed oil (12% lipid, rich in linolenic acid), or low fat (4%
lipid, low fat diet) for 10 weeks. FA profiles and the steady-state levels of fabp mRNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA in
intestine, liver, muscle and brain of zebrafish were determined.
Result: FA profiles assayed by gas chromatography differed in the intestine, brain, muscle and liver depending on diet. The
steady-state level of mRNA for three sets of duplicated genes, fabp1a/fabp1b.1/fabp1b.2, fabp7a/fabp7b, and fabp11a/fabp11b,
was determined by reverse transcription, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In brain, the steady-state level of
fabp7b mRNAs was induced in fish fed the linoleic acid-rich diet; in intestine, the transcript level of fabp1b.1 and fabp7b were
elevated in fish fed the linolenic acid-rich diet; in liver, the level of fabp7a mRNAs was elevated in fish fed the low fat diet; and
in muscle, the level of fabp7a and fabp11a mRNAs were elevated in fish fed the linolenic acid-rich or the low fat diets. In all
cases, induction of the steady-state level of fabp mRNAs by dietary FAs correlated with induced levels of hnRNA for a given
fabp gene. As such, up-regulation of the steady-state level of fabp mRNAs by FAs occurred at the level of initiation of
transcription. None of the sister duplicates of these fabp genes exhibited an increase in their steady-state transcript levels in a
specific tissue following feeding zebrafish any of the four experimental diets.
Conclusion: Differential induction of only one of the sister pair of duplicated fabp genes by FAs provides evidence to support
the DDC model for retention of duplicated genes in the zebrafish genome by either subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.

Background
In his seminal book, 'Evolution by Gene Duplication',
Susumu Ohno [1] argued that one of the major mechanisms that facilitate the increasing complexity in the evolution of life is duplication of genes and whole genomes.
Models to explain retention of duplicated genes in eukaryotic genomes have undergone a development of thought
since Ohno proposed his model almost 40 years ago.
Ohno [1] argued that most duplicated genes are lost from
the genome owing to nonfunctionalization, a claim
which has been validated by empirical evidence from
Lynch and Conery [2]. Nonfunctionalization is a process
where deleterious mutations accumulate in the coding
region of a gene giving rise to either a dysfunctional protein or no protein product. Duplicated genes might, however, be retained in the genome owing to mutations in the
coding region that led to a novel function for the protein
product of a gene, a process Ohno termed 'neofunctionalization'. This model by Ohno for the preservation of
duplicated genes came to be known as the 'classical
model'. Data primarily derived from genome sequencing
projects over the past decade suggest that a much higher
proportion of gene duplicates is preserved in the eukaryotic genome than predicted by Ohno's "classical model".
To explain this apparent "conundrum", Force et al. [3]
proposed the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model in which subfunctionalization serves
as an alternative mechanism, but not to the exclusion of
neofunctionalization, for the preservation of duplicated
genes. According to the DDC model, duplicated genes are
retained in the genome either by subfunctionalization,
where the functions of the ancestral gene are sub-divided
between sister duplicate genes, or by neofunctionalization, where one of the duplicates acquires a new function.
In this model, both processes occur by either loss or gain
of cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoters of the
duplicated genes. As with the "classical model" of Ohno
[1], the DDC model proposes that most duplicated genes
are lost from the genome (i.e., nonfunctionalization)
owing to an accumulation of deleterious mutations in
coding or control regions leading to functional decay.
We chose to test the DDC model of Force et al. [3] that
subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization results in
the retention of duplicated genes in the genome by investigating the expression of duplicated copies of fatty acidbinding protein (Fabp) genes, members of the multigene
family of intracellular lipid-binding protein (iLBP) genes,
in zebrafish for two reasons. First, bioinformatic resources
for zebrafish are readily available, including linkage maps,
extensive expressed sequence tags (EST) http://
www.zfin.org and an almost complete genome sequence
database http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio. Second,
and most importantly, owing to a whole genome duplication (WGD) event, an event that occurred early in the ray-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/219

finned fish radiation about 230-400 million years ago [47], we predicted that many members of the iLBP multigene family might exist as duplicated copies. This prediction has proved to be correct (see below).
The iLBPs are encoded by a highly conserved multigene
family, which consists of the fatty acid- (FABP), cellular
retinol- (CRBP) and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein
(CRABP) genes [reviewed in [8-12]]. Currently, 17 paralogous iLBP genes have been identified in animals, but no
member of this multigene family has been identified in
plants and fungi. Schaap et al. [13] have suggested, therefore, that the first iLBP gene emerged after the divergence
of animals from plants ~930-1000 million years ago. This
ancestral iLBP gene presumably underwent a series of
duplications followed by sequence divergence, giving rise
to the diversity of the extant iLBP multigene family. This
multigene family has been further augmented in rayfinned fishes by the WGD event mentioned above [4-7].
Originally, iLBP genes and their proteins were named
according to the initial tissue of isolation, e.g., liver-type
FABP (L-FABP), brain-type FABP (B-FABP), etc. Owing to
some confusion with this earlier nomenclature, here we
use the nomenclature proposed by Hertzel and Bernlohr
[14] in which numerals distinguish the different FABP
proteins and their genes, (e.g., FABP1 (liver-type), FABP7
(brain-type)).
FABP1, the first FABP isolated, was described almost 40
years ago [15]. Although extensive studies in mammals
have focused on the tissue distribution and binding activities of FABPs, the regulation and evolution of their genes,
and mice FABP gene knock-outs [8,10-12], the precise
physiological roles of FABPs remain unclear. However,
accumulated data have provided evidence that FABPs play
an important role in uptake, sequestering and transport of
fatty acids and interaction with other transport and
enzyme systems. Indirect evidence suggests other putative
physiological functions for FABPs, such as: (i) transport of
fatty acids to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription via
activation of the nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) [see e.g., [12,16]]; (ii)
essential functions in early development, especially neural growth and differentiation [see [17,18] and references
therein]; and (iii) a role in human diseases [10,12].
Although the coding sequence and structure of the FABP
genes has been well conserved over millions of years, each
FABP gene exhibits a distinct, yet sometimes overlapping
pattern of tissue-specific expression with other FABP
genes. If all FABP genes in this multigene family arose
from a single ancestral gene as proposed [13], the regulatory elements in the promoters must have evolved different functions in the subsequent duplicated genes giving

rise to the complexity of the spatio-temporal expression of
this multigene family. Regulatory elements in the promoters of some mammalian FABP genes and one insect have
been identified [8,19]. As such, cis-acting elements that
determine the spatio-temporal expression of these genes,
with a few exceptions, are not well defined. From
sequence data, it appears that mammalian iLBP gene-promoters consist of a modular structure similar to many
eukaryotic promoters, comprised commonly of a TATA
box with proximal and distal regulatory elements [20].
Currently, our understanding of the regulatory elements
that control the expression of the FABP genes is modest
and limited primarily to mammals [but see [21-23]].
Based on the zebrafish fabp10 sequence [24], Her et al.,
[22] cloned its promoter and by functional analysis, identified a 435 bp regulatory element that is sufficient to
modulate the liver regional expression in transgenic
zebrafish. How this cis-acting element functions is not
known. In addition to functional promoter studies, fatty
acids and peroxisome proliferators have been shown to
induce the transcription of some FABP genes in mammals
[25,26] via activation of PPAR, or other unknown transcription factors, that bind to a fatty acid (FA) response
element (FARE) [23].
To date, we have characterized 11 zebrafish FABP genes
with respect to their cDNA sequence, gene structure, chromosome location, conserved gene synteny with their
mammalian orthologs, and their spatio-temporal patterns
of expression in embryos, larvae and adults [17,18,24,2734]. Based on phylogenetic analyses and conserved gene
synteny with their single-copy, mammalian orthologs,
eight (four pairs) out of 11 of the extant members of the
zebrafish FABP genes arose as a result of the ray-finned
fish-specific WGD event [[18,32,33] and unpublished
data]. One pair of genes, fabp1b.1 and fabp1b.2, are tandemly-arrayed on chromosome 8 separated by ~4 kb of
DNA [unpublished data]. This duplication, which was
subsequent to the WGD but is not yet dated, is presumably the result of unequal crossing-over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The number of
duplicated FABP genes (63%) retained in the zebrafish
genome owing to the WGD event in the ray-finned fishes
lineage is remarkable as Postlethwaith et al. [4] estimate
that only 20% of all the duplicated genes following WGD
have been retained in the zebrafish genome. Other estimates for retention of duplicated genes in the zebrafish
genome from the WGD are 14-30% [6]. Three zebrafish
FABP genes, fabp2, fabp3 and fabp6 exist as single copies (a
duplicate of fabp10 has recently been identified by us
[unpublished data]). Following the WGD event, the sister
duplicates of these genes have presumably been lost by
accumulation of mutations leading to functional decay.

In mammals, FAs up-regulate the expression of some
FABP genes as evidenced by an increase in mRNA and protein levels [25,26]. We hypothesized that (i) zebrafish fabp
genes might be up-regulated by dietary FAs, and (ii) sister
duplicated fabp genes might be differentially modulated
by dietary FAs. We show by assaying steady-state mRNA
and heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) levels for three
sets of duplicated fapb genes, fabp1a/fabp1b.1/fabp1b.2,
fabp7a/fabp7b and fabp11a/fabp11b, that dietary FAs modulate the transcriptional initiation of only one of the
duplicated fabp genes in specific tissues of zebrafish. This
result provides compelling evidence that these duplicated
fabp genes were retained in the genome by either subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization owing to the divergence of cis-acting regulatory elements in the fabp gene
promoters.

Results
The steady-state level of fabp mRNAs does not differ
between sexes of zebrafish
Several authors have argued that lipid metabolism is
influenced by the sex of an organism. For example, longchain fatty acids are cleared from plasma by the liver more
rapidly in female rats than male rats [35]. Bass et al. [36]
reported that female rats have a higher intracellular concentration of FABP3 than male rats. We, therefore, assayed
by reverse transcription, quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT- qPCR) the steady-state level of mRNA
encoded by each fabp gene in intestine, liver, muscle and
brain of male and female zebrafish reared on TetraminÂ®
(Tetrawerke, Melle, Germany) flake diet. No difference in
the steady-state level of fabp mRNAs in a specific tissue
(i.e., intestine, liver, muscle or brain) was observed
between male and female zebrafish (data not shown).
Effect of diet on the FA composition in different tissues of
zebrafish
Zebrafish readily ate all four diets and no differences were
observed in their feed intake during the 10 week feeding
period. Composition and abbreviated names for the four
diets are shown in Table 1. The weight of fish increased
from 0.26 Â± 0.02 g at the beginning of the feeding trial
(~22 weeks of age) to 0.45 Â± 0.01 g at the end of the feeding trial (~32 weeks of age) for all diets. At the end of 10
weeks, each diet resulted in a different FA profile for specific tissues. Fig 1 shows the composition of four major
FAs in intestine, liver, muscle and brain. For detailed composition of FAs in each tissue see additional file 1: Tables
S1-S4. Intestine, liver, muscle and brain of fish fed HD
and LND had higher proportions of n-3 fatty acids, due
largely to elevated levels of linolenic acid (18:3 n-3),
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3), and docosahexaenoic
acid (22:6 n-3), and reduced proportions of n-6 fatty
acids. In contrast, intestine, muscle, and brain of fish fed
LD and LFD exhibit higher percentages of n-6 fatty acids,

and reduced proportions of n-3 fatty acids. The percentages of other fatty acids varied among tissues within each
experimental group and also among the experimental
groups (see Additional file 1: Tables S1-S4).
Effect of diet on the steady-state level of fabp1a/fabp1b.1/
fabp1b.2 mRNAs in different tissues
No modulation in the steady-state level of fabp1a mRNAs
was observed in the intestine (Fig. 2A) regardless of diet
fed to the fish. In the intestine of fish fed LND, the steadystate level of fabp1b.1 mRNAs was higher than those in the
intestine of fish fed the other three diets (Fig. 2B). The
level of fabp1a and fabp1b.1 mRNAs was below that quantifiable by RT-qPCR in liver, muscle and brain of
zebrafish. fabp1b.2 mRNA was detectable in intestine and
brain of fish fed the four diets, but the levels in liver and
muscle were below the quantifiable range in RT-qPCR
assays (data not shown). Furthermore, dietary FAs did not

change the steady-state level of fabp1b.2 transcripts in the
intestine and brain.
Effect of diet on the steady-state level of fabp7a and
fabp7b mRNAs in different tissues
The steady-state level of fabp7a mRNAs was not modulated in intestine (Fig. 3A) or brain (Fig. 3G) of fish fed
any of the experimental diets. In contrast, the steady-state
level of fabp7b mRNAs was higher in intestine of fish fed
LND compared to fabp7b mRNAs in the intestine of fish
fed LD and LFD, but not different in intestine of fish fed
HD (Fig. 3B). Also, the steady-state level of fabp7b mRNAs
was elevated (10-fold) in the brain of fish fed LD compared to the level of fabp7b transcripts in brain of fish fed
LFD and LND, but was not different in brain of fish fed
HD (Fig. 3H).

The steady-state level of fabp7a mRNAs was 4-fold higher
in the liver of fish fed LFD compared to the transcript levels in the liver of fish fed one of the three other diets (Fig.
3C). The steady-state level of fabp7a mRNAs was 3-fold
higher in muscle of fish fed LND compared to mRNAs levels for this gene in muscle of fish fed LD, but was not different in the muscle of fish fed HD and LFD (Fig. 3E). No
difference was observed in the steady-state level of fabp7b
mRNAs in liver of fish fed any of the four experimental
diets (Fig. 3D). Finally, fabp7b mRNAs were not quantifiable by RT-qPCR in muscle (Fig. 3F).
Effect of diet on steady-state level of fabp11a and fabp11b
mRNAs in different tissues
No difference was observed in the steady-state level of
fabp11a mRNAs in the intestine, liver and brain of fish fed
any of the four diets (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D). The steady-state
level of fabp11a mRNAs was, however, 2-fold higher in
muscle of fish fed LFD compared to fabp11a transcript levels in muscle of fish fed the other three diets (Fig. 4C). The
level of fabp11b mRNAs was not quantifiable by RT-qPCR
in liver, muscle and intestine of zebrafish owing to their
low abundance. The steady-state level of fabp11b mRNAs
weas not changed in the brain of zebrafish fed any of the
experimental diets (data not shown).
Modulation of the steady-state level of fabp mRNAs is due
to up-regulation of transcriptional initiation
Heterogeneous RNA (hnRNA) for a given gene is rapidly
processed to a mature mRNA transcript by removal of
intervening sequences and the addition of a 5' cap and a
poly(A) tail [37]. As such, the level of hnRNA for a given
gene indirectly correlates with the rate of initiation of
transcription for that gene. To test whether the observed
increase in the steady-state level of fabp mRNAs by dietary
FAs was due to increased transcriptional initiation, the
steady-state level of hnRNA for a specific fabp gene was

In the intestine of fish fed LND, the level of fabp1b.1
hnRNA was higher than in the intestine of fish fed one of

of fish fed LND compared to fabp7b hnRNA in the intestine of fish fed one of the other three diets (Fig. 5D).
fabp7b hnRNA was 6-fold higher in the brain of fish fed
LD compared to fish fed the rest of the treatment diets
(Fig. 5E), while the steady-state level of fabp11a hnRNA
was 2-fold higher in muscle of fish fed LFD compared to
hnRNA transcript levels in muscle of fish fed HD and LD,
but was unchanged in muscle of fish fed LND (Fig. 5F).

Discussion
Effect of diet on FA profiles in tissues of zebrafish
The FA composition in tissues of fish is mediated by various metabolic activities, such as fatty acid desaturation,
elongation [38], and ï¢-oxidation [39]. The composition
of FAs in tissues is also influenced by dietary lipids [4042]. In the current study, the FA composition of the four
diets fed zebrafish affected the FA profiles of intestine,
liver, muscle, and brain (Fig. 1 and additional file 1:
Tables S1-S4). Our results are consistent with other studies in which dietary FAs modified the FA profile in
zebrafish and other fishes [43-48].

same samples. Data are presented as the mean ratio Â± S.E.M.
(x 10-3). Significant differences in the relative steady-state
level of fabp mRNA transcripts between fish (n = 6) fed different diets are indicated by an asterisk.

Dietary FAs modulate the steady-state level of fabp
mRNAs
Several studies reported the induction of some FABP
genes in mammals by FAs and molecular mechanisms for
this induction have been proposed [36,49-52]. For example, some research groups [52-54] have suggested that
FABPs transport long-chain FAs to the nucleus from the
cytoplasm. Once inside the nucleus, FABPs interact with
and transfer their long-chain FA ligands to nuclear receptors, such as PPARï¡ and PPARï§ [55-57]. Dietary longchain FAs are known to activate these nuclear receptors
[58-62]. Once activated, these nuclear receptors form heterodimers with retinoic acid receptors (RAR) or retinoid X
receptors (RXR) (e.g., PPAR-RXR or PPAR-RAR), which in
turn bind to response elements in FABP genes and,
thereby, stimulate initiation of transcription [63]. In part,
our results showing the increased transcription of fabp
genes by dietary FAs are consistent with this mechanism
of induction (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5). However, none of the
fabp genes were up-regulated in any of the tissues assayed
in zebrafish fed HD (Table 2). Indeed, the steady-state
level of fabp1a, fabp1b.1 and fabp11a mRNAs was lowest in

all of the tissues assayed in fish fed HD (Figs. 2 and 4).
Also, the steady-state level of Fabp7 mRNAs in rat brain
[64], Fabp5 mRNAs in mouse liver [65], and the steadystate level of fabp3 and fabp10 mRNAs in the muscle of
Atlantic salmon [47] were not elevated in animals fed
diets rich in fish oil. Similarly, Liu et al. [66] showed that
PC12 cells from rats exposed to eicosapentaenoic acid and
docosahexaenoic acid, both abundant in the HD diet fed
zebrafish, did not change the level of Fabp5 transcripts.
Based on the results reported here and previous studies
[47,64-66], we propose that, besides up-regulation of fabp
genes by FAs [67], there may be other mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the fabp genes, such as repression
of transcriptional initiation. Berger et al. [65] suggested
that the observed down-regulation of Fabp5 mRNA levels
in the liver of mice fed a fish oil diet was mediated via
transforming growth factor, beta 1 (TGFï¢1). Although a
few reports [67-69] emphasize the role of TGFï¢1 in the
transcriptional regulation of Fabp genes, the exact mechanism remains unknown.
Differential modulation of fabp1b.1, but not fabp1a and
fabp1b.2 transcription by dietary FAs
FAs are known to induce the expression of the Fabp1 gene
in the mammalian intestine [25,36,49,70,71]. Feeding of
high-fat diets rich in vegetable oils resulted in a 30-40%
increase in the cytosolic content of FABP1 in the rat intestine [36,49]. Rats weaned to a high-fat diet showed higher

levels of Fabp1 mRNAs in their intestine than those
weaned to a low-fat diet [70,71]. Also, feeding rats a diet
containing 6% sunflower oil (rich in linoleic acid)
resulted in the greater induction of Fabp1 in intestine
compared to rats fed a diet containing 3% sunflower oil
[25].
Since FAs, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic
acid, induce the expression of the mammalian FABP1
gene [25,26,70,71], we anticipated that the steady-state
level of mRNAs for all the duplicated copies of zebrafish
fabp1 (fabp1a, fabp1b.1, and fabp1b.2), might be modulated by the different FAs in one or more of the experimental diets. However, in this study, we only observed
up-regulation of the steady-state level of fabp1b.1 mRNAs
in the intestine of fish fed LND (Fig. 2) at the level of transcriptional initiation (Fig. 5). The steady-state level of
fabp1a (Fig. 2) and fabp1b.2 mRNAs remained unchanged
in the different tissues of zebrafish fed experimental diets.
We conclude, therefore, that the fabp1a and fabp1b.2
genes, but not the fabp1b.1 gene, no longer respond to dietary FAs owing to loss of cis-regulatory elements in their
respective promoters. In their study of cis-regulatory elements after a WGD event in yeast, Papp et al. [72] concluded that the total number of cis-regulatory elements
remained unchanged over time between duplicated genes.
They further suggest that the number of shared cis-regulatory elements between duplicated genes decreased. The
difference in the mode of gene regulation reported here
for the duplicated fabp1s may be due to loss of cis-regulatory elements in the fabp1a and fabp1b.2 genes, a mechanism consistent with the process of subfunctionalization.
In contrast, zebrafish fabp1s exhibit a divergent pattern in
their tissue-specific distribution of transcripts when compared to their mammalian ortholog. Mammalian Fabp1
transcripts were abundant in the intestine, liver and were
detected at lower levels in kidney, ovary, and lung [12,73].
In adult zebrafish, fabp1a transcripts were detected in the
intestine [32], whereas fabp1b.1 transcripts were abundant
in the intestine [32] but detected at lower levels in the
liver, heart, gills, ovary and testes [unpublished data].
Zebrafish fabp1b.2 transcripts were abundant in the intestine, ovary and skin, and detected at lower levels in the
brain, heart and eye [unpublished data]. This divergent
tissue-specific distribution of transcripts for the duplicate
fabp1 genes differs from previously reported examples of
subfunctionalization [3], where the combined tissue-specific expression of duplicated zebrafish genes equals the
tissue-specific expression of their mammalian ortholog, as
described for the duplicated hoxb1a and hoxb1b [74], mitfa
and mitfb [75,76], and sox11a and sox11b [77] genes. Comparative functional analysis of cis-regulatory elements of
Fabp1 genes will be necessary to determine if the dupli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/219

cated fabp1 genes are retained in the zebrafish genome due
to either subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.
Tissue-specific transcriptional modulation of fabp7a and
fabp7b mRNAs by dietary FAs
In this study, duplicated copies of zebrafish fabp7, fabp7a
and fabp7b, exhibited distinct patterns of up-regulation by
dietary FAs in different tissues for steady-state levels of
both mRNA and hnRNA (Figs. 3 and 5). The steady-state
level of fabp7a mRNAs in muscle and liver were elevated
in zebrafish fed LND and LFD, whereas the steady-state
level of fabp7b mRNAs was modulated in brain and intestine of the fish fed LD and LND.

Mammalian Fabp7 transcripts are detected in brain, retina,
spinal cord and mammary gland [8,12]. Zebrafish fabp7a
transcripts are detected in brain, spinal cord, retina, testis,
liver, intestine, and muscle [18] and zebrafish fabp7b transcripts are detected in brain, retina, testis, liver, intestine,
skin, and swim bladder [18]. In addition, the steady-state
level of zebrafish fabp7b transcripts, but not fabp7a transcripts, was up-regulated in the brain of zebrafish fed LD
(Fig 3).
Since the duplicated copies of the zebrafish fabp7, fabp7a
and fabp7b, show a different tissue-specific pattern of
expression compared to their mammalian ortholog and
exhibit a different mode of gene regulation by dietary FAs
from each other, it is possible that either subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization may account for the retention of both duplicated fabp7 genes in the zebrafish
genome.
Transcriptional modulation of fabp11a, but not fabp11b,
by dietary FAs
Previously, we reported that the duplicated copies of the
zebrafish fabp11 gene and the tetrapod FABP4, FABP5,
FABP8 and FABP9 genes are derived from a common
ancestral gene [33]. To date, the fabp11 gene has only been
identified in fishes [33,78]. This study shows that both the
steady-state level of fabp11a mRNAs (Fig. 4) and hnRNAs
(Fig. 5) was only elevated in muscle of fish fed LFD, but
not in muscle of fish fed one of the other three diets.
Although fabp11a and fabp11b exhibit different tissue-specific patterns of expression in embryos, larvae and adult
zebrafish [29,33] and differential regulation by dietary
FAs, we are unable at this time to resolve whether these
duplicated genes were retained in the genome by either
subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization as no
ortholog of this gene has been identified thus far in other
species, such as birds or mammals.

Conclusion
In this study, we show that dietary FAs change the FA profile in intestine, liver, muscle and brain of zebrafish. The

tissue-specific changes in FA content modulated the
steady-state level of mRNAs for only one sister duplicate
of three pairs of duplicated genes of the fabp multigene
family in zebrafish (Table 2). Furthermore, changes in
fabp hnRNA directly correlated with changes in the steadystate levels of fabp mRNAs, suggesting that the affects of
FAs on these fabp genes occurred at the site of transcriptional initiation (Table 2). These findings indicate that the
retention of duplicated fabp genes in the zebrafish genome
is most likely the result of either subfunctionalization or
neofunctionalization. To distinguish between these processes as outlined in the DDC model [3] will require functional analysis of the fabp promoters to identify ciselements responsible for transcriptional induction by FAs.

Methods
Diets and fish husbandry
Four isoproteic (41% crude protein) diets differing in FA
composition and lipid content were formulated (Table 1).
In addition to National Research Council recommendations on the nutritional requirements of warm-water
fishes [79], we were guided by the results of previous dietary studies in zebrafish [43-45,80,81] in the formulation
of the diets used in this study. All dry ingredients were
mixed in a Hobart mixer. Butyl hydroxy anisole was dissolved in the lipid source and choline chloride was dissolved in distilled water. Both of these solutions were then
added to dry ingredients to make a wet dough. The wet
dough was scrubbed through an 800 ï­m screen and the
resulting wet particles were freeze-dried and stored at 20Â°C. The particle size was 600-800 ï­m in diameter, a
size interval for feeding appropriate to the age and weight
of the fish used in this study. Mean weight of fish at the
start of the feeding trial was 0.26 g. Highly unsaturated
FA-rich diet (HD), linoleic acid-rich diet (LD), linolenic
acid-rich diet (LND) contained 12% lipid, whereas the

low fat diet (LFD) was composed of 4% lipid (Table 1).
The FA composition of the four diets is shown in Table 3.
The concentration of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) was highest
in LD (44.82%), while the concentration of linolenic acid
(18:3 n-3) was highest in LND (33.53%). Among the four
diets, the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) was highest in
HD (6.14% and 20.94%, respectively).
One hundred and eighty wild-type inbred zebrafish siblings (mean wt. 0.26 g), bred from 2 males and 2 females
(obtained from a local aquarium supply store) to control
for genetic variance, were randomly assigned to 12
aquaria (35 l) with 15 fish per tank at approximately 20
weeks of age. Each dietary treatment had three tank replicates to control for environmental variance. Fishes were
acclimatized for 15 days and fed TetraminÂ® (Tetrawerke,
Melle, Germany) twice a day to satiation. The Tetramin
diet was discontinued and then fish were fed one of the
four diets twice a day at 0900 h and 1900 h to satiation for
10 weeks. A constant water temperature (28Â°C), a light/
dark cycle (14/10 h) and other water parameters were
maintained according to Westerfield [82]. Feeding was
stopped 24 h prior to sampling of tissue. Fish were individually euthanized by immersion in 0.2% MS-222,
weighed and dissected to collect intestine, liver, muscle
and brain tissues for RNA and FA analysis. Animal husbandry and protocols for this experiment were reviewed
by the Animal Care Committee of Dalhousie University in
accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from intestine, liver, muscle and
brain of zebrafish using the standard TRIzol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). The quality and
quantity of extracted RNA was assessed by agarose gelelectrophoresis and spectrophotometry at 260 nm, respectively. Messenger RNA in 2 ï­g of total RNA was converted
to cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen,
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). cDNA was synthesized
from heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) using random
hexamers. Primer pairs for quantification of mRNA and
hnRNA encoded by different fabp genes and the annealing
temperature for primer pairs for each fabp gene are shown
in Table 4. For assay of gene-specific hnRNA, one primer
was based on an intronic sequence, while the other was
based on an exonic sequence (see Table 4 for details).
Primers for the amplification of elongation factor 1 alpha
(ef1ï¡) mRNA by RT-qPCR are based on a previous study
[83].

The target sequence for each gene was quantified to generate a standard curve of known copy number. Amplification of cDNA samples and DNA standards was carried out

using the SYBRGreen Quantitect PCR Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) following the manufacturer's
instructions. For thermal cycling and fluorescence detection, a Rotor-Gene 3000 system (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) was used. PCR conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation for 15 min at 95Â°C followed by 40
cycles of 15 s denaturation at 94Â°C, 20 s annealing of
primers at different temperatures depending on the
primer pairs (see Table 4), and 30 s of elongation at 72Â°C.
Following the PCR cycles, the melting temperature of the
PCR product was determined to assess its purity. Fluorescence was measured following each cycle. The copy numbers of mRNA and hnRNA for each fabp gene were
determined using the standard curves as explained by
Bustin et al. [84]. As negative controls, the reverse transcriptase was omitted from cDNA synthesis reactions for
each sample and these controls were subjected to RTqPCR. To determine the relative steady-state level of fabp
mRNA and hnRNA in each tissue, the absolute copy
number of fabp mRNA and hnRNA transcripts was divided
by the copy number of ef1ï¡ mRNA and hnRNA transcripts
in each sample.
Lipid extraction, FAME preparation and gas
chromatography
A modified Folch procedure [85] described by Budge et al.
[86] was used to extract neutral lipid fractions from tissues. Briefly, the tissues were homogenized and sonicated
for four minutes in 8:4:3 chloroform:methanol:water and
the process was repeated four times. Following each
extraction, the organic layer was removed, pooled and
concentrated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. FA methyl
esters (FAMEs) of tissue and dietary lipid were prepared
with 7% boron trifluoride in methanol and heating to

100Â°C for 60 minutes [87]. FAMEs were separated by a
gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization
detector (Hewlett Packard 6890 GC system, Wilmington,
Delaware, USA) on an Omegawax 320 capillary column
(30 m Ã 0.32 mm Ã 0.25 ï­m; Supelco, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA). FAMEs were identified by comparison of
retention times with those of known standards (Supelco
37 and menhaden oil; Supelco, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,
USA).
Statistical analysis
Microsoft ExcelÂ® 2003 and SPSSÂ® 14.0 (Chicago, USA)
were used for statistical analysis. The relative abundance
of mRNA and hnRNA encoded by each fabp gene is presented as means Â± S.E.M. The significance level was set at
P < 0.05. The effect of diet on FA composition and the relative abundance of mRNA and hnRNA encoded by each
fabp gene in different tissues were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA. Post hoc comparisons were conducted using the
Tukey's HSD test.
