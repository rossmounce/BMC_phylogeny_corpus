Abstract
Background: Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) and Auxin Response Factor (ARF)
transcription factors are key regulators of auxin responses in plants. We identified the suites of
genes in the two gene families in Populus and performed comparative genomic analysis with
Arabidopsis and rice.
Results: A total of 35 Aux/IAA and 39 ARF genes were identified in the Populus genome.
Comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that several Aux/IAA and ARF subgroups have
differentially expanded or contracted between the two dicotyledonous plants. Activator ARF genes
were found to be two fold-overrepresented in the Populus genome. PoptrIAA and PoptrARF gene
families appear to have expanded due to high segmental and low tandem duplication events.
Furthermore, expression studies showed that genes in the expanded PoptrIAA3 subgroup display
differential expression.
Conclusion: The present study examines the extent of conservation and divergence in the
structure and evolution of Populus Aux/IAA and ARF gene families with respect to Arabidopsis and
rice. The gene-family analysis reported here will be useful in conducting future functional genomics
studies to understand how the molecular roles of these large gene families translate into a diversity
of biologically meaningful auxin effects.

Background
Aux/IAAs are auxin response genes that code for nuclear
localized proteins [1]. Aux/IAA proteins generally have
four characteristic domains; an N-terminal repression
domain, an adjacent domain involved in protein stability,
and two C-terminal domains (CTD), III and IV, through
which Aux/IAA proteins form homo- and heterodimers
with Aux/IAA or ARF proteins [2]. Most ARF proteins con-

tain an N-terminal B3-like DNA binding domain that
includes an ARF family-specific domain, a variable middle
region that confers activator or repressor activity, and
domains III and IV that are also found in Aux/IAA [3]. ARF
proteins are capable, irrespective of auxin status, of binding to auxin responsive cis-elements (AuxRE; TGTCTC)
present upstream to the coding sequence of auxin responsive genes [4,5]. Aux/IAA proteins bind to the DNAPage 1 of 14

bound ARF partner proteins via domains III and IV and
repress ARF activity. In the auxin activated status, Aux/IAA
proteins are ubiquitinated via interactions with the auxinmodified SCFTIR1complex and subsequently degraded by
26S proteasome action [6-8]. While some ARFs possess a
characteristic glutamine (Q)-rich middle region which
confers an activator activity, ARFs with a proline, serine
and threonine-rich middle region are found to be associated with repressor activity [3,9]. The complexity of auxin
regulatory activity is due in part to the large sizes of the
ARF and Aux/IAA gene families, as well as variations in
activation or repression activity among ARFs, heterodimerization affinities, expression patterns, and auxinmediated transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.
Despite the knowledge that Aux/IAAs and ARFs influence
apical dominance, vascular development, tropic movements, root growth, tissue and organ patterning, and
flower and fruit development [10], many questions still
linger. For example, these gene families remain largely
uncharacterized in forest tree species and the degree of
conservation of gene families between annual and perennial woody plants is unknown. Furthermore, the mechanisms of Aux/IAA and ARF interaction and regulation are
not completely understood and much remains to be
learned about their roles in the contexts of a cell and the
whole organism. Identification of Aux/IAA and ARF gene
families from distinct model plants is a necessary step in
formulating better hypotheses related to physiological
and developmental processes. The recent sequencing of
the Populus genome has provided an additional reference
genome for testing inferences on auxin signal transduction events obtained previously through functional
genomic studies of Arabidopsis.
The present paper summarizes findings from bioinformatics-based comparative genomic studies to identify the
total number of Aux/IAA and ARF genes in Populus, to predict the protein domain architectures, and to assess the
extent of conservation and divergence between Populus,
Arabidopsis and rice gene families. Targeted RT-PCR and
whole genome microarray analyses, and EST database surveys were also undertaken to explore differential expression of closely grouping co-orthologs. Furthermore, we
have reflected on the possible implications of differential
patterns of retention, loss, and expansion of duplicated
homeologous genes.

Results and discussion
Identification and sequence analysis of Populus Aux/IAA
genes
The Populus genome has 35 predicted Aux/IAA genes
(henceforth referred to as PoptrIAA) compared to 29 genes
in the Arabidopsis genome (henceforth referred to as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/59

AtIAA) [11] and to 31 genes in the rice genome (henceforth referred to as OsIAA) [12]. In silico mapping of the
gene loci showed that PoptrIAA genes are present on 10 of
the 19 chromosomes (Figure 1; See Additional file 1).
Any analysis of Populus gene family evolution must take
into account the most significant event in the recent evolution of the genus; a genome-wide duplication event that
occurred approximately 65 Mya and which is still detectable over approximately 92% of the genome [13]. Based on
the age estimates of duplicate genes and homologymicrosynteny analysis (See Additional file 2), 14 PoptrIAA
genes pairs (80% of total genes) are represented within
segmental duplication regions associated with the recent
salicoid duplication event. It is intriguing that 6 pairs of
tandem duplicates are represented as 'ancient tandem
genes' within more recent whole genome or segmental
duplicate clusters. These 15 PoptrIAA genes (~43% of
total) are represented in 7 distinct tandem duplicate gene
clusters, with 6 clusters containing two tandem genes and
1 cluster containing 3 tandem genes (PoptrIAA15,
PoptrIAA19.1 and PoptrIAA19.2).
It is possible that some of the apparently closely-related
genes are in fact alleles from unassembled haplotypes,
which are potential artifacts from shotgun assembly of
this highly heterozygous genome. For example,
PoptrIAA3.1 and PoptrIAA3.2 group closely with their tandem duplicates, PoptrIAA16.1 and PoptrIAA16.2, and
PoptrIAA3.1 and PoptrIAA16.1 genes are located on a presently unassembled scaffold (scaffold_70). However, the
apparent co-orthologs are divergent at the amino acid
level as well as in the flanking gene order and identity in
the syntenic blocks, which argue against the classification
of the scaffold as a haplotype.
Further analyses of conserved domains and multiple
sequence alignments of predicted proteins showed that
some Populus genes contain modifications in the conserved domain architecture (See Additional files 3, 4 and
5). Based on MEME-MAST protein motif analysis, domain
I was found to be missing in PoptrIAA29.1, PoptrIAA29.2
and PoptrIAA29.3 and also in the Arabidopsis ortholog,
AtIAA29. Similarly, domains I and II appear to be missing
in PoptrIAA33.1, PoptrIAA33.2 and PoptrIAA34 as well as
AtIAA33 and AtIAA34. Multiple sequence alignment
shows that the "idLgLsLrt" sequence reported as domain I
motif in AtIAA34 (LxLxL) [14] is conserved with AtIAA14,
AtIAA15, AtIAA16 and AtIAA17 (See Additional file 3) in
which the consensus sequence of the reported domain I is
"TELxLxLPG" [14].
Domain II enables the SCFTIR1-dependent proteasomemediated degradation of Aux/IAA [15]. Rapid basal degradation rate and auxin responsiveness of Aux/IAA proteins

arisen from the salicoid genome duplication 65 Mya and shared by two chromosomes [13]. Chromosome numbers (linkage
group number I-XIX) and sizes (Mb) are indicated at the bottom end of each chromosome. PoptrIAA and PoptrARF genes are

Additional file 1).

are found to be associated with alterations in the highly
conserved domain II motif, 'VGWPPI/V' [15] and the 'KR'
motif between domains I and II [16]. Studies in Arabidopsis show that mutations in the VGWPPV motif render the
repressor protein stable [17-23]. Multiple sequence alignments of full-length amino acid sequences revealed deviations in both the 'VGWPPI/V' and 'KR' motif sequences
in PoptrIAA7.1, PoptrIAA20.1, PoptrIAA 20.2, PoptrIAA
33.1, PoptrIAA 33.2, PoptrIAA 34 and AtIAA20, AtIAA30,
AtIAA31, AtIAA32, AtIAA33 and AtIAA34. Deviations in
the conserved 'KR' motif alone were observed in
PoptrIAA27.1, PoptrIAA26.2 and AtIAA28 sequences.
However, PoptrIAA7.1 was found to be unique in that it
contains a tandem duplication of the domain II region
(See Additional file 5). This unique feature has not been
detected in Aux/IAA genes reported from any other genera
including Arabidopsis, Oryza, Vitis, Nicotiana and Coffea,
but was found in GenBank ESTs derived from P. tri-

chocarpa, P. deltoides, P. tremuloides, P. tremula Ã tremuloides [24], P. alba Ã tremula, P. trichocarpa Ã deltoides
and P. fremontii Ã angustifolia, suggesting that this is a
Populus-specific acquisition.
Comparative analysis of Populus and Arabidopsis Aux/
IAA gene families
Phylogenetic reconstruction at the molecular level using
all available and predicted Populus, Arabidopsis and rice
Aux/IAA amino acid sequences shows that four groups of
PoptrIAAs (PoptrIAA3, 16, 27 and 29) have expanded to
contain three or more members each (Figure 2). Three
AtIAAs did not have a representative sequence ortholog in
Populus, indicating acquisition or perpetuation of distinct
Aux/IAAs unique to Arabidopsis and its relatively recent
ancestors.

Phylogenetic analysis of predicted full-length Aux/IAA protein sequences using Neighbor-Joining method.
Amino acid sequences of full-length predicted proteins were aligned using MUSCLE program. Tree was produced as described
in methods. Bootstrap support is indicated at each node. Green boxes represent sustained expansion of subgroups in Populus.

There are four homologs of AtIAA16, PoptrIAA16.1â16.4,
predicted in the Populus genome. Phylogenetic groupings
suggest absence of AtIAA16 orthologs from rice.
PoptrIAA16.3 and PoptrIAA16.4 are likely co-orthologs of
an ancestral gene lost in Arabidopsis. These co-orthologs
have intact conserved domains and EST evidence supporting their functionality (See Additional files 1 and 5).
Based on EST data, PoptrIAA16.1 appears to express during
wood formation (in cambial zone and tension wood),
whereas PoptrIAA16.3 and 16.4 appear to express in young
leaves (See Additional file 6). A PoptrIAA16.1-like EST was
previously reported from hybrid aspen to be expressed in
the context of wood formation and a PoptrIAA16.3-like
EST was shown to be expressed in dividing and expanding

cells [24]. These findings are partially supported by our
whole genome microarray data, which showed that
PoptrIAA16.1 was expressed in xylem, phloem, cortex,
root and seed (See Additional files 7, 8 and 9).
However, there was no array evidence to support expression of PoptrIAA16.3 and PoptrIAA16.4 in young leaf tissues, though PoptrIAA16.3 was expressed at the stem
apex, in apical vegetative buds, newly set reproductive
buds of both genders, and in older leaves.
Two Aux/IAA proteins, IAA26/PAP1 (Phytochrome associated protein1) and IAA27 are known to interact with
phytochrome A (PHYA) [25,26] and TMV replicase

PoptrIAA3.1â3.6 represent a six-member PoptrIAA3 subgroup that groups closely with AtIAA1â4. This subgroup
provides striking evidence for functional divergence following selective retention of duplicated genes. While the
Arabidopsis shy2 mutant, carrying a gain-of-function mutation in AtIAA3, has upcurled leaves, slower gravitropic
response, shorter hypocotyls and fewer lateral roots [22],
a functional role for AtIAA4 is yet to be assigned. Genespecific real-time RT-PCR showed that genes in the
PoptrIAA3 subgroup display differential expression
between leaf, stem and root tissues (Figure 3). PoptrIAA3.2
was found to have a higher expression level by several fold
in stem than in roots. In an earlier study of aspen Aux/IAA
genes, the PoptrIAA3.2-like gene had highest expression in
developing xylem [24], which is also supported by our
microarray results (Figure 4). EST data suggest that
PoptrIAA3.1 and 3.2 appear to be preferentially expressed
in the cambial zone and during wood formation (See
Additional file 6), and the microarray data suggest that
these genes are also strongly expressed in newly germinated seedlings. PoptrIAA3.6-like ESTs are found in libraries of dormant buds and senescing leaves. PoptrIAA3.4 has
a distinct expression pattern compared to other PoptrIAA3
genes, with detectable ESTs in male and female catkins,
and highest expression in floral buds as determined by the
microarray (Figure 4).
Identification and sequence analysis of Populus ARF
genes
A total of 39 predicted ARF genes (henceforth referred to
as PoptrARF) were found in the Populus genome, compared to 23 genes reported from the Arabidopsis genome
(henceforth referred to as AtARF) [2] and to 25 genes
reported from the rice genome (henceforth referred to as
OsARF) [29]. In silico mapping of gene loci showed PoptrARF genes are present on all chromosomes except VII,
XIII, XVII and XIX (Figure 1). Eleven out of 39 genes lie
within unassembled scaffolds. Conserved domain evaluations showed that four gene models (PoptrARF3.3, 6.3,

[1,27,28]. Populus has three IAA27-like Aux/IAA genes. EST
and microarray data suggest expression in shoot meristem, floral buds and dormant and active cambia (See
Additional files 6, 7, 8 and 9). Possible affinity for interaction with PHYA protein suggests a role for PoptrIAA27 in
external-stimuli-dependent cambium activation or
growth status. PoptrIAA26.1 and PoptrIAA26.2 genes cluster closely with AtIAA18 and AtIAA26 and are expressed in
shoot meristem, young and senescing leaves, male catkins, and floral buds. RT-PCR survey of PoptrIAA26.1 and
PoptrIAA26.2 genes shows highest expression in young
leaves. Since AtIAA26 and AtIAA27 proteins display binding affinity towards PHYA, it is likely that these Populus
sequence orthologs are also involved in mediating the
photoregulation of various tree developmental processes.

of the three tissue types. ÎCt was estimated by the formula;

capture the other lower fold change values observed.

are otherwise conserved in their closest sequence ortholog
(See Additional files 10, 11 and 12).
Sixteen PoptrARF gene pairs (82% of total) are estimated
to be represented in chromosomal segmental duplications arising out of the salicoid whole genome duplication event. Two genes, PoptrARF16.4 and PoptrARF16.5,
(5% of total) are represented as one tandem duplication
pair. The Arabidopsis genome contains a group of seven
tandemly duplicated ARF genes that thus far have not
been observed in other plant species including Populus
and rice.
Comparative analysis of Populus and Arabidopsis ARF
gene families
Phylogenetic analysis using known and predicted Populus,
Arabidopsis and rice ARF protein sequences shows distinct
gene family histories even between the two dicots (Figure
5). The ratio of activator ARFs (defined by the Q-rich middle region) in Arabidopsis and Populus is 1:2.6 whereas the
ratio of repressor and other ARFs is 1:1.4, indicating a twofold enrichment of activator ARFs during Populus evolution.

A pair of Populus genes, PoptrARF7.3 and PoptrARF 7.4, was
found to group closely with three OsARF genes but had no
obvious Arabidopsis orthologs. The loss-of-function ARF7
mutant displays altered leaf expansion, lateral root formation [30] and hypocotyl phototropism [31] in Arabidopsis.
PoptrARF7.3 has EST support from a tension wood library
(See Additional file 6), and microarray data indicated that
PoptrARF7.3 has higher expression in xylem tissue (See
Additional files 7, 8 and 9). It is possible that analogous
to AtARF7's role in auxin dependent differential growth in
aerial plant form [31], PoptrARF7.3 may be involved in
differential growth in woody stems in response to tension
stress.
At least three different singleton ArabidopsisARF genes
(AtARF2, 6 and 16) were found to cluster with four or
more Populus genes each. PoptrARF6.4 and PoptrARF6.5
are likely co-orthologs of an ancestral gene lost in Arabidopsis. AtARF 6 and its Populus co-orthologs have Q-rich
middle regions. Potato ARF6, which is similar to AtARF6,
is reported to be involved in meristem activation [32].
Sprouting buds, apical meristem and leaf tips were
reported to have the highest ARF6 transcript levels. While
PoptrARF6.1 has EST support from cambial zone and tension wood tissue libraries, PoptrARF6.4, has expression
support from a dormant bud library and PoptrARF6.2 has
EST support from floral bud libraries. Furthermore, our
microarray experiments indicated that the five members
of the PoptrARF6 subgroup showed differential patterns of

expression. PoptrARF6.1 and 6.4 were expressed at low levels, with peaks in mature leaves and phloem-cortex samples. In contrast, PoptrARF6.2 and 6.3 were strongly
expressed across most tissue types, with particularly strong
expression in xylem, phloem, and vegetative and reproductive meristems. Finally, PoptrARF6.5 was not significantly expressed in any of the tissues tested (See
Additional files 7 and 8). Interestingly, AtARF6 and 8
(double mutant) are associated with floral development
in Arabidopsis [33]. They also display reduced stature, possibly due to reduced apical meristem activity. Though further experimental validation is required, preliminary
information suggests that this subgroup has functional
roles in controlling meristematic activity in distinct tissues
and developmental stages.
AtARF2 negatively regulates differential growth in Arabidopsis hypocotyls [34]. AtARF2 mutants are reported to
have defective floral structures [35]. T-DNA insertion
mutants of AtARF2 have larger rosette leaves and reduced
number and size of other aerial organs including inflorescences [33]. AtARF2 T-DNA insertion mutants also exhibit
extra cell division and expansion in seeds and other vegetative and floral organs[35]. Populus has four putative
AtARF2 orthologs (Figure 5). PoptrARF2.5 and
PoptrARF2.6 are likely co-orthologs of an ancestral gene
lost in Arabidopsis. Based on microarray and EST support,
PoptrARF2.1 and 2.2 appear to express almost ubiquitously, with particularly strong expression in xylem and
phloem. PoptrARF2.3 and PoptrARF2.4 were expressed in
vegetative and floral buds, as well as in the cambial (cell
division) zone. Tissue distribution of Populus ESTs and
array results suggest that these sequence orthologs may
possess similar functional contexts in Populus and Arabidopsis.
Characterization of the ettin (ett) mutant revealed that
AtARF3 is involved in floral meristem, gynoecium, stamen
and perianth patterning [36]. Populus has three ARF3-like
genes out of which, PoptrARF3.1 and 3.2 had some EST
and microarray expression support from vegetative and
reproductive buds, but surprisingly these genes were most
strongly expressed in xylem and phloem. PoptrARF3.3 was
not included on the microarray because the gene model
was artificially truncated in the initial annotation.
Monopteros (mp), a loss-of-function AtARF5 mutant, has a
severely malformed embryonic axis and vascular system,
and defective inflorescences where lateral flowers are
completely lacking or reduced in number [37]. Populus
has two putative orthologs of AtARF5, PoptrARF5.1 and
5.2, and RT-PCR and microarray results indicate slightly
higher expression in roots compared to stem and leaves
(See Additional files 7, 8 and 13). Populus EST and microarray data show that PoptrARF5.2 is highly expressed in

respect to AtARF5 (or common ancestor) or if they play
additional roles in tree development.
Evolution, divergence and regulation of Aux/IAA and ARF
gene families
Genome-wide duplications followed by a series of reciprocal tandem terminal fusions have resulted in a dramatic
reorganization of the duplicated genome segments in Populus. Ensuing gene loss and expansion events have con-

tributed toward divergence in gene family structures
between the dicots, Arabidopsis and Populus [13,38]. Moreover, the modes of expansion, either through tandem or
segmental duplication, differ between members of each
gene family.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed a few subgroups such as
IAA16 and ARF4 that contained sequence representatives
in Populus and Arabidopsis but not in rice indicating that
these subgroups were acquired or differentially retained in
dicots post-divergence from monocots.

Contrary to the ARF gene family, Aux/IAA gene family was
observed to have expanded largely due to segmental
duplications in Arabidopsis [38]. Segmental duplications
have also contributed to expansion of both these gene
families in rice [12,29]. Our study indicates that PoptrIAA
as well as PoptrARF genes have been largely retained at a
higher than average rate following the salicoid genomewide duplication and rearrangement events. On a
genome-wide scale, approximately 14,000 of the 45,000
(~32%) predicted genes are retained in duplicated pairs
resulting from the salicoid duplication event [13]. The
retention rates for PoptrIAA and PoptrARF families are 80%
and 82% respectively. This is in line with the expectation
that genes involved in transcription regulation and signal
transduction are preferentially retained following duplication [39-41]. The low proportion of retained tandem
duplicates (5%) in the PoptrARF gene family compared to
the PoptrIAA family is potentially due to constraints associated with dimer stoichiometry maintenance for ARF
transcription factor activity as tandem clusters do exist for
other Populus gene families [13]. Even though 43% of PoptrIAA genes are represented in tandem clusters of two to
three genes each, nearly 86% of these tandem clusters
have likely expanded and been retained following chromosome-level segmental duplication or whole-genome
duplication events. These observations suggest that PoptrIAA and PoptrARF transcription factor families consist of
genes originating primarily from high segmental (largescale) and secondarily from low tandem (small-scale)
duplication events. Sub-functionalization, neo-functionalization and non-functionalization events associated
with duplicate transcription factor genes carry a greater
weight for functional ramifications such as the ability to
differentially regulate auxin signal transduction pathways.
It could be speculated, based primarily on our understanding of the functional role of the nearest Arabidopsis
ortholog [33-35,42], that the presence of multiple ARF2
co-orthologs in the Populus genome could reflect the
greater need for temporal control on cell division and
expansion in the context of flowering, senescence and
abscission in Populus, a perennial deciduous tree that
exhibits seasonal dynamics and transitioning between
juvenile to mature to reproductive stages across a timespan of years as opposed to days as in the annual Arabidopsis. Considering the complexity of ARF- and Aux/IAAmediated regulation, the reasons for and implications of
diversification will require further understanding using
evolutionary systems biology studies [43].

single and double mutants resulting from AtIAA12 gainof-function and ARF5 loss-of-function mutants have similar mutant phenotypes. It is proposed that ARF5 may act
in a positive and IAA12 in negative regulatory way to control embryogenesis and root meristem development in an
auxin-dependent manner [21]. RT-PCR results show that
PoptrARF5 and PoptrIAA12 genes display contrasting
expression patterns in roots (See Additional file 13). The
high expression of PoptrARF5 in roots and low expression
of PoptrIAA12 suggests that they may co-regulate root
development in Populus in an auxin dependent manner.
The potential number of heterotypic interactions between
Populus ARFs and Aux/IAAs are likely several times greater
than the number of members in these two large gene families. This may contribute to higher-order auxin signal and
response mechanisms needed by perennial plants to
achieve greater developmental plasticity.

Closely-related ARFs that represent pairs of sister loci have
been found to have strong double-mutant phenotypes
and overlapping expression domains [33]. Furthermore,
interaction affinities were found to be stronger among
intra-group (activator or repressor ARF groups) members
when compared to inter-group members [44]. Moreover,

Conclusion

The auxin response mechanism has recently been shown
to be also regulated through small noncoding RNA species; microRNA (miRNA) and trans-acting short-interfering RNA (ta-siRNA). AtARF 10, 16 and 17 are known to be
regulated by miR160, a miRNA group that is highly conserved across the plant kingdom [45,46] and AtARF6 and
AtARF8 have shown to be regulated by miR167 [47]. Both
miR160 and miR167 families are predicted to be two-fold
overrepresented in the Populus genome when compared to
Arabidopsis [13]. Target sequences for miR160 have been
detected in PoptrARF10.1-10.2, PoptrARF16.1â16.5 and
PoptrARF17.1â17.2 and miR167 targets have been found
in PoptrARF6.1â6.3 and PoptrARF8.1â8.2.
TAS3 ta-siRNA has been shown to mediate post-transcriptional regulation of ARF3 and ARF4 gene expression
[48,49] and to play a key role in juvenile to adult phase
transition in Arabidopsis [50,51]. The ta-siRNA target site
sequences were reported to be conserved among AtARF2,
AtARF3 and AtARF4 and related rice and wheat sequences
[49]. Homologous conserved sites were found to occur
once in PoptrARF2.2 and PoptrARF2.6 and twice in
PoptrARF3.1, PoptrARF3.2 and PoptrARF4 genes. GenBank
database searches showed that grape, tobacco, medicago
and tomato ARF3-like sequences also carry two conserved
ta-siRNA target sites. The individual PoptrARF coorthologs as well as the different genes represented in the
miR and tasiR groups provide myriad opportunities for
complex regulatory interactions of auxin-related transcription in Populus.

This study identified the suites of Aux/IAA and ARF genes
in the Populus genome and revealed their gene family
structures. Comparative genomics with Arabidopsis and
rice suggested that the two gene families have a common
origin, including conservation of activator groups in ARF

gene families of all three genomes, but have experienced
separate evolutionary histories, diverging in important
ways, including the lack of large clusters of tandemly
duplicated AtARF genes from Populus and rice, lack of
PoptrARF7.3 and PoptrARF7.4 orthologs in Arabidopsis and
substantial expansion of certain PoptrIAA and PoptrARF
subgroups through large-scale segmental duplications.
Overall, the gene family structures of Populus and Arabidopsis displayed a greater degree of conservation with each
other than in comparison with the monocot plant, rice.
The Populus genome sequence and the findings reported
here provide new opportunities to facilitate postulation
and exploration of hypotheses linking auxin response regulatory genes to conserved core plant processes, as well as
perennial plant features such as wood development, longdistance nutrient and water movement, seasonal dynamics, and disease resistance. Targeted reverse genetics studies, high-resolution spatiotemporal expression surveys as
well as investigations of in vivo homo- and hetero-dimerization affinities of the various Aux/IAA and ARF gene family members among taxa will need to be carried out to
understand how the molecular functions of these genes
translate into a diverse suite of auxin-mediated effects at
the whole-plant level. Further studies on basic aspects of
the functional contexts of Aux/IAA and ARF proteins will
open opportunities for applications in agricultural, forestry, environmental and energy sectors. One such application includes ongoing functional genomics studies to
investigate the roles of PoptrIAA and PoptrARF genes in
carbon allocation and carbon sequestration.

Methods
Identification of Aux/IAA and ARF gene families in
Populus
Genes were initially identified using Pfam domain IDs
assigned to predicted Populus gene models in the JGI
(DOE Joint Genome Institute, CA) annotation pipeline
[13], and by using Arabidopsis ARF and Aux/IAA proteins
[2,11] as queries in BLASTP searches of predicted Populus
proteins (Populus Genome v 1.1, January 2007). Populus
proteins identified in this initial search were used as query
sequences in additional BLASTP searches of the predicted
Populus protein set for exhaustive identification of divergent Populus gene family members. Redundant and
invalid gene models were verified based on gene structure,
intactness of conserved motifs, EST support and synteny
analysis. We have also included in our study an incomplete gene model (fgenesh4_pg.C_scaffold_1006000001)
representative of PoptrARF6.3 because this gene model is
flanked by a sequence gap followed by the conserved ARF
amino terminus domains, which could potentially be corrected into a complete gene model in the upcoming version of the genome. Furthermore, this gene showed very
strong evidence of expression based on microarray analy-

ses. Sequence conservation and microsynteny analysis of
Populus gene models with Populus homeologous (duplicated) genomic regions and the Arabidopsis genome was
conducted using the Vista Browser tool with default curve
calculation parameters; nucleotide sequence 'conservation identity' of 70% and 'minimum conservation width'
of 100 bp [52]. One gene model per locus, which included
some JGI annotated models representing the promoted or
reference set, were used in this study. It should also be
noted that in the current version of the genome (v 1.1),
some of the scaffolds could potentially represent haplotypes and not unique unassembled genomic regions.
Gene nomenclature is based on the consensus standard
established by the International Populus Genome Consortium (IPGC) to distinguish Populus trichocarpa from other
Populus species.
Chromosomal mapping of PoptrIAA and PoptrARF
genes and estimation of duplicate genes
Information on chromosomal location was gathered from
the Populus genome browser [53]. Chromosomal locations were determined by integrating the genome assembly with a microsatellite-based genetic map for P.
trichocarpa Ã P. deltoides [13,54]. The physical chromosomal location was represented in a graphical output by
scaling the 19 chromosomes (depicting regions of
genome-wide duplications as in Tuskan et al., 2006) followed by scale-guided positioning or mapping of the loci.
Identification of homeologous chromosome segments
resulting from whole-genome duplication events was
accomplished as described in Tuskan et al., 2006. Briefly,
global alignments were performed using the double-affine Smith-Waterman algorithm. Genetic distances
between pairs were calculated as the proportion of fourfold degenerate nucleotide sites that underwent transversions (4DTV distance). 4DTV stands for four-fold synonymous (degenerative) third-codon transversion. It
represents a transversion in the third nucleotide position
within four codons that does not result in a change in corresponding amino acid identity within the protein it
codes for. Such an estimate of synonymous mutation rate
within a transcribed region of a gene but not in region that
experiences selection is a conserved means of estimating
divergence within the more recent evolutionary past. Distances corresponding to the 'salicoid' whole-genome
duplication events were delineated based on discrete
peaks in 4DTV distributions. Duplicated segments were
defined as regions on different linkage groups or scaffolds
containing six or more homeologous pairs with similar
4DTV values, with fewer than 25 nonhomeologous genes
intervening. Gene pairs resulting from the 'salicoid' duplication (apparently common to the Salicaceae) were
defined by 4DTV values between 0.04 and 0.17. Microsynteny in flanking regions of segmental duplicates was verified using the Genome Browser. Tandemly duplicated

genes that matched the same homeolog were only
counted once for this analysis.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Conserved protein motifs were determined from CDsearches [55] and using MEME-MAST programs [56,57].
Sequence identity between two genes was determined
using the bl2seq tool [58]. Multiple sequence alignments
were performed using MUSCLE sequence alignment program [59]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in two
ways using amino acid sequence alignments of conserved
regions or full-length sequences of all predicted proteins
in Aux/IAA and ARF gene families of Populus, Arabidopsis
[2,9,11] and rice [12,29]. Arabidopsis and rice sequences
were obtained from TAIR and TIGR databases. Unrooted
PHYLIP trees with 1000 bootstraps were generated by
Neighbor-Joining method using ClustalX 1.83 program.
Phylograms were visualized in TreeView v1.6.6. Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis of conserved, collated and aligned
Aux/IAA (See Additional file 14) and ARF amino acid
sequences (See Additional file 15) was performed using
the MRBAYES (version 3.1.2) package [60,61]. We used
the WAG substitution frequency matrix [62] with amongsites rate variation modeled by means of a discrete Î³ distribution with four equally probable categories. Two independent runs of 1â2 million Monte Carlo Markov Chain
generations with four chains each were run. Trees were
sampled every 100 generations and stationary phase and
burnin value was determined by plotting the likelihood
scores against number of generations. Posterior probabilities calculated from consensus are shown on branches.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
Leaf, stem and root tissue material were collected from
greenhouse-grown P. trichocarpa (Nisqually-1)plants and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was
extracted from plant samples using plant RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA) followed with DNase I treatment. The quality
and quantity of RNA was evaluated using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis. cDNA was
synthesized from two micrograms of RNA using SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen, CA) according to manufacturers'
instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out using cDNA,
primer pairs (See Additional file 16) and iQ SYBR mix
(BioRad, CA). Samples were run in triplicate in an iCycler
real-time PCR machine (BioRad, CA) and normalized
with respect to18S threshold cycle values. Fold change
was calculated by the formula 2-ÎÎCt, where ÎÎCt is the
difference between ÎCt of a gene in a given tissue and the
lowest value ÎCt for that gene in any of the three tissue
types. ÎCt was estimated by the formula; Ct of gene of
interest â geometric mean of ÎCt of 18S RNA gene (control gene). EST information was obtained from GenBank
and the Populus EST database, PopulusDB [63].

Microarray analysis
We used a whole genome microarray that we designed
together with NimbleGen Systems, Inc. The array targets
55,794 predicted transcripts from the poplar genome
sequencing project. There are three different isothermal
60 mer probes per target, designed for maximum specificity. All probes are replicated once on the array for a total
of over 385,000 probes synthesized in situ on glass slides
[64].

Tissues for microarray hybridizations were obtained from
field and greenhouse-grown trees, and tissue collection
methods varied depending on the tissue type. All tissue
was obtained from Populus trichocarpa clone Nisqually-1,
except for floral tissue and seeds, which were collected
from trees growing in the wild near Corvallis, Oregon. Tissues and abbreviations are listed in Additional file 17.
Two biological replicates were used for each of 12 tissue
types, and three biological replicates were used for xylem
and phloem samples. RNA was extracted as described for
RT-PCR analyses. Labeling, hybridization, and scanning
were carried out by NimbleGen using their standard
expression array protocols.
Array data (See Additional file 18) were normalized using
the NimbleGen microarray data processing pipeline
(NMPP) [65]. We used a two step normalization procedure starting with an initial quantile normalization
among replicates within each tissue, and then a global
normalization to adjust all tissues to a similar baseline.
Gene-level analyses were performed using the mean normalized fluorescence values for all probes and replicates.
For negative controls we used probes targeting 3,149
transposable elements that were contaminants in the initial release of Populus gene models. This approach is warranted because the vast majority of these elements will be
quiescent at any particular time, an assumption that is
supported by the significantly lower hybridization signals
from these probes compared to all other groups of targets
on the array (data not shown). For each experiment we
defined the expression threshold as the 95th percentile of
the fluorescence values for all negative control targets. Relative expression of individual genes was assessed as foldchange from this negative control threshold value. A twofold change was considered to be evidence of significant
expression.

Expression analysis of PoptrARF5 and PoptrIAA12 genes using real-time
RT-PCR. * Fold Change is represented relative to lowest value observed
for the gene. Lowest value was determined by comparison of relative
threshold cycle values for a specific gene across leaf, stem and root samples.
Fold change was calculated by the formula 2-ÎÎCt, where ÎÎCt is the difference between ÎCt of a gene is a given tissue and the lowest value ÎCt
for that gene in any of the three tissue types. ÎCt was estimated by the formula; (Ct of gene of interest) â (geometric mean of ÎCt of 18S RNA
gene, control gene).
