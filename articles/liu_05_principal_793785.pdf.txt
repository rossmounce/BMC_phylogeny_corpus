Abstract
Background: The responses to interleukin 1 (IL-1) in human chondrocytes constitute a complex
regulatory mechanism, where multiple transcription factors interact combinatorially to
transcription-factor binding motifs (TFBMs). In order to select a critical set of TFBMs from genomic
DNA information and an array-derived data, an efficient algorithm to solve a combinatorial
optimization problem is required. Although computational approaches based on evolutionary
algorithms are commonly employed, an analytical algorithm would be useful to predict TFBMs at
nearly no computational cost and evaluate varying modelling conditions. Singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a powerful method to derive primary components of a given matrix.
Applying SVD to a promoter matrix defined from regulatory DNA sequences, we derived a novel
method to predict the critical set of TFBMs.
Results: The promoter matrix was defined to establish a quantitative relationship between the IL1-driven mRNA alteration and genomic DNA sequences of the IL-1 responsive genes. The matrix
was decomposed with SVD, and the effects of 8 potential TFBMs (5'-CAGGC-3', 5'-CGCCC-3', 5'CCGCC-3', 5'-ATGGG-3', 5'-GGGAA-3', 5'-CGTCC-3', 5'-AAAGG-3', and 5'-ACCCA-3') were
predicted from a pool of 512 random DNA sequences. The prediction included matches to the
core binding motifs of biologically known TFBMs such as AP2, SP1, EGR1, KROX, GC-BOX, ABI4,
ETF, E2F, SRF, STAT, IK-1, PPARγ, STAF, ROAZ, and NFκB, and their significance was evaluated
numerically using Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithm.
Conclusion: The described SVD-based prediction is an analytical method to provide a set of
potential TFBMs involved in transcriptional regulation. The results would be useful to evaluate
analytically a contribution of individual DNA sequences.

Background
The use of microarrays has led to a significant number of
exciting discoveries establishing important links between
mRNA expression patterns and cellular states [1,2]. Math-

ematical and computational models have been developed
to understand and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying expression patterns [3,4]. However, it
remains difficult to discover and validate novel transcrip-

chical clusters [7,8], this approach is not aimed to build a
global model with multiple binding motifs. TFBM can be
inspected through phylogenetic footprinting [6,9,10], but
identifying orthologous genes and their associated regulatory regions are not always possible. Model-based
approaches, initially developed using yeast genome [3],
encounter difficulty in evaluating the astronomical
number of TFBM selections in the combinatorial problem
[11,12]. Although multiple binding motifs were selected
in the yeast dataset using a recursive formula, prediction
of TFBMs would be affected depending on the order of
selected motifs [3]. Some models lack statistical standards
for determining the number of TFBMs having combinatorial roles that are critical in expression patterns. Thus, a
predictive model that provides a comprehensive set of
TFBMs

needs
to

developed.

Flowchart of the model-based analysis of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs). The mRNA expression data and the human genome sequence information were
used to formulate the mathematical model. The putative
TFBMs were selected through the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analysis and the Singular Value Decomposition

tion-factor binding motifs (TFBMs) in the human
genome. The popular approach to identify TFBMs utilizes
sequence comparisons among co-expressed genes [5] or
across multi-species [6]. Although any consensus motif
can be searched among the co-regulated genes in hierar-

The specific aim of the current study was to devise a model
for predicting known and de novo transcription factor
binding motifs from array-derived mRNA expression levels by developing a unique principal component analysis.
We employed the responses of human chondrocytes to
interleukin-1 (IL-1) as a model system [13]. IL-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine, and it stimulates not only inflammatory responses but also tissue degeneration [5]. More
than 100 microarray analyses have been conducted to
analyze IL-1-driven responses in various cell types, including chondrocytes [14,15], and significant efforts have
been made to understand transcriptional mechanisms of
IL-1 response [16-18]. However, few of the previous studies have validated the global roles of multiple critical
TFBMs in downregulation or upregulation of a cluster of
genes.
In this principal component analysis, we introduced the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) test, singular value
decomposition (SVD), and a genetic algorithm (GA) to
predict and evaluate TFBMs from a pool of random DNA
sequences (Fig. 1). The predictive model was formulated
using state vectors, which represented a contribution of
potential TFBMs to the IL-1 responses. The promoter
matrix was defined to build the quantitative relationship
between the mRNA expression vector and the state vectors, and a unique SVD procedure was applied to the promoter matrix. Although one previous study defined the
mRNA expression level as a state variable, dynamical correlations among the mRNA levels do not directly represent biological processes [19]. Here, a state variable was
defined as an activation level of each TFBM, and SVD was
used to link the primary components in the expression
vector to the influential TFBM candidates in the state vector through the eigen gene vectors and the eigen TFBM
vectors. The analytical prediction of TFBMs with SVD was
evaluated numerically using Monte Carlo simulation and
GA.

Results
Prediction and validation of novel and known TFBMs
were conducted using logarithmic ratios of the IL-1-driven
mRNA alterations in human chondrocytes (Fig. 1). First,
AIC was used to determine a statistically meaningful
number of TFBMs in the model. Second, the contribution
of each of the 512 TFBM candidates to the IL-1 responses
was evaluated by decomposing the promoter matrix with
SVD. Third, the SVD-based priority of TFBMs was evaluated numerically by GA and Monte-Carlo simulation.
Fourth, a linkage was established among the predicted
and known TFBMs.
Messenger RNA ratios and AIC analysis
Using data obtained in primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes, 45 IL-1-responsive genes were selected
and the ratios of mRNA levels from IL-1-treated cells
against mRNA levels in untreated cells were calculated
from the list of IL-1-responsive genes in primary chondrocytes published by Vincenti and Brinckerhoff [13]. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the relative mRNA levels are represented
in a greyscale, and the logarithmic ratios are illustrated in
a green to red color code. The mRNA ratios for 33 genes
were positive (upregulation; indicated by green), while
the ratios for 12 genes were negative (downregulation;
indicated by red). Using Eq. (1) and the SVD procedure,
these logarithmic mRNA ratios were modelled against 1 to
32 TFBMs that were chosen from random DNA sequences
of 5 bp in length (Fig. 2B). As expected, the model error
decreased monotonically as the number of TFBMs
increased from 1 to 32. In order to estimate the proper
number of TFBMs in the model, AIC was calculated using

Eq. (2) (Fig. 2C). The minimum AIC was obtained with 8
TFBMs, which were used as models for further analysis.
SVD analysis
Using the SVD procedure, the promoter matrix H, built
from the 300-bp upstream flanking sequences, was factorized into three matrices in Eq. (4). Using the eigen gene
vectors in U (Fig. 3A) and the eigen values in Λ (Fig. 3B),
the observed mRNA ratios were decomposed linearly with
definition of the weighing factors, ki (Fig. 3C), in Eq. (5).
Out of 45 eigen values, the primary and the secondary
eigen values were 133.4 and 64.6. Shannon entropy was
calculated as 0.65 [6], and the eigen values suggested a relatively even spread distribution among the 45 eigen gene
vectors. Note that that Shannon entropy takes values
between 0 and 1, and a smaller value suggests that expression data are dominated by influential eigen values. Using
the weighing factors for each of the eigen TFBM vectors,
the most influential 8 TFBMs, whose contribution to the
expression levels of IL-1-responsive genes was predicted to
be larger than the others, were selected. First, the eigen
TFBM vectors (Fig. 4A) were derived as a complement of
the eigen gene vectors. Then, each TFBM candidate in the
eigen TFBM vectors was weighted by the same weighting
factors defined in Eq. (5). This weighting process predicted the contributions of TFBM candidates to the
observed value of z (Fig. 4B). Lastly, the overall significance to the selected 45 genes was estimated by adding the
45 row elements in the eigen TFBM vectors (Fig. 4C). The
predicted TFBM candidates were 5'-CAGGC-3', 5'CGCCC-3', 5'-CCGCC-3', 5'-CACCG-3', 5'-GCGCC-3', 5'ATGGG-3', 5'-GGGAA-3', and 5'-CCGCG-3'.

model error was 108 ± 31 (mean ± s.d.) and 93 ± 23 for
the first and the second datasets, respectively (Fig. 6).

GA analysis, Monte-Carlo simulation, and leave-one-out
test
In order to evaluate the selection of 8 TFBMs based on the
above principal component analysis, the numerical search
for TFBM candidates was conducted with the GA analysis.
Starting with 200 digital chromosomes in Eq. (6), including the chromosome for the SVD solution, the population
of chromosomes was evolved for 104 generations. During
evolution, the model error was reduced through artificial
chromosome recombinations and mutations (Fig. 5A).
The sum square error for the mRNA ratios was 15.94 (SVD
solution) and 7.55 (GA solution). These values were
smaller than the Monte-Carlo results of 58.97 ± 8.61 (N =
10,000) using a random selection of TFBMs (Fig. 5B). The
GA solution reduced the error of the SVD solution by
52.6% by retaining five SVD-driven TFBMs and introducing three new TFBMs, 5'-CGTCC-3', 5'-AAAGG-3', and 5'ACCCA-3' (Fig. 5C).

In order to further examine the SVD-based model, we conducted a leave-one-out test. In this test, (N - 1) genes were
used to build a model and one gene was used to validate
the model through any difference between the observed
and the predicted expression levels. The process was
repeated N times (N = 45) by removing one gene at a time.
The model error for a complete set of leave-one-out tests
was 33. To evaluate significance of the leave-one-out
model error, Monte-Carlo analyses were conducted using
two datasets. In the first dataset the elements in the promoter matrix was reshuffled, and in the second dataset the
order of mRNA expression levels was randomized. The

In this report, we have presented a predictive model and
its validation using the transcriptional responses to IL-1 in
human chondrocytes as a model system. From a pool of
512 random DNA sequences of 5 bp in length as potential
TFBM candidates, the SVD analysis and the GA simulation
both identified 8 TFBMs. Five out of 8 TFBM candidates
were identical in both analyses, and several of the known
TFBMs, including AP2, EGR1, GC-BOX, SP1, NFκB, and
LEF1, coincided with the predicted TFBMs.
Prior to application to the mammalian gene expression in
the current study, the described approach was examined
to build a model for a Ras/cAMP signal transduction pathway in yeast. This pathway is well characterized in yeast,
and a cAMP responsive element (CRE; 5'-[A/G][A/C][T/
C]GCAGT-3'), which is conserved in eukaryotes, is known
to be involved. The SVD-based approach with 5-bp
sequences predicted a part of CRE (5'-AATGC-3') together
with two yeast-specific binding motifs such as 5'-AGGGG3' (binding motif for MSN2/MSN4; stress responsive element) and 5'-ACCGG-3' (binding motif for LEU3). Since
both MSN2 and LEU3 are differentially expressed in
response to Ras activation [5], the results allowed us to
apply this principal component approach to the current
study on the human IL-1 responses (see additional file).
In the prediction phase of TFBM analysis, we demonstrated that the SVD analysis prioritized the contribution
of individual TFBM candidates, and the GA algorithm was
employed to evaluate independently the SVD solution.
SVD is computationally inexpensive, and the results are
reproducible since no random parameters are involved. It
is straightforward to incorporate the effects of degenerate
binding sequences by modifying a linear combination of
the eigen TFBM vectors and adding contributions from
redundant sequences in the final SVD procedure. More
specifically, to any TFBM candidate there are 15 degenerate motifs with one base-pair mismatch and the contribution of these degenerate sequences can be included in the
model with an appropriate weighting factor. The standard
computational complexity of SVD procedure is estimated

to O(mn) by implementing the average algorithm or
employing parallel computing [21]. GA is a heuristic
solver suitable for searching efficiently the suboptimal

solutions. There are 1.1 × 1017 combinations to predict 8
TFBMs from 512 candidates in this study. It is virtually

mal in terms of minimization of the prediction error. A
predicted 5-bp TFBM can represent more than one motif
longer than 5 bp sequences.
The use of mathematical and computational procedures
such as AIC, SVD, and GA have been used previously to
analyze the behaviour of complex biological systems
[22,23]. In prediction of TFBMs from the microarray data,
however, the described usage here is unique in a novel
state-variable representation. Since many genes are regulated by multiple TFBMs, a statistical standard such as AIC
may be used appropriately to validate the number of
TFBMs that are meaningful in array-derived data. The previous use of SVD has been limited to clustering expression
patterns in the eigen gene space [22,24]. The unique feature of the described predictive model is to link the eigen
gene space to the eigen TFBM space by applying SVD to
the promoter matrix defined from TFBMs. Evolutionary
algorithm such as GA has been used to estimate the values
of parameters [25,26]. We employed GA to select the set
of TFBMs from an artificial chromosome that is composed
of on/off switches for 512 random DNA sequences.
The predictive model in this study generated many testable hypotheses on known TFBMs, as well as novel TFBM
candidates, and led us to the analysis of transcription factors. Five out of the 8 TFBM candidates were linked to
known transcription factors. Among them, AP2 is known
to be involved in stress responses [27] and LEF1 is known
to be involved in a wnt signalling pathway [28]. However,

neither AP2 nor LEF1 is reported to be responsive to IL-1.
EGR1 increases expression of inflammatory cytokines and
is involved in IL-1-induced downregulation of the type II
collagen promoter in chondrocytes [29], and the GC-box
is a widely distributed promoter component. The binding
site of SP1 is recognized by SP3, which may oppose positive effects of SP1 [30]. NFκB is a pivotal transcription factor that is both induced at the mRNA level, as shown here,
and activated by proinflammatory cytokines [31-33].
However, the relatively long degenerate consensus
sequence of its binding site 5'-GGG(A/G)(C/A/T)T(T/
C)(T/C)CC-3'requires a further linkage analysis to the predicted TFBM of 5'-GGGAA-3'. In a separate study, the promoter competition assay was conducted to evaluate the
role of the SVD-selected TFBMs using three IL-1-responsive genes, LIF, NFκB2, and IRF1 [34]. In the assay, the
stimulatory effects of 5'-CAGGC-3' and 5'-CGCCC-3', as
well as the inhibitory effects of 5'-CCGCC-3', 5'-CACCG3', and 5'-GCGCC-3', were consistent to the SVD prediction. In order to further validate the stimulatory role of 5'CAGGC-3', a gel shift assay was conducted. As predicted,
incubation with the nuclear extracts isolated from the IL1-treated cells retarded the mobility of the DNA fragment
containing 5'-CAGGC-3' (see additional file).
The described state-variable formulation of the predictive
model can be extended to include redundancy in TFBM
consensus sequences, temporal mRNA profiles, and interactions of TFBMs with transcription factors and cofactors.
Short motifs such as 5 bp TFBMs in this study may present

less specificity, but the described SVD procedure can
increase specificity easier than any combinatorial search
algorithm such as GA. The model can be extended to predict a dynamical state of TFBMs associated with the regulation of the temporal mRNA expression profiles [23].
Interactions among TFBMs through transcription factors
and cofactors can be implemented through the nonlinear
version
[35].

Conclusion
Identification of TFBMs in the human genome is critically
important in the post Human Genome Project era [36].

Although experimental evaluation is mandatory to gain
biological insights from the model-based predictive
results, an analytical model at nearly no computational
cost would be useful to provide initial conditions for
numerical optimization or predict a set of potential targets for experimental verification. Although the prediction
is dependent on definition of regulatory regions, the
described model-based analysis allowed us to gain a new
biochemical insight on the IL-1 responses by integrating
the SVD procedure and Akaike information criterion. In
conclusion, the current study on gene responses to IL-1
demonstrates that application of the primary component

analysis would predict and validate the novel and known
TFBMs from the microarray data using genomic DNA
information.

Methods
Determination of mRNA ratios
The mRNA expression data for the IL-1-responsive genes
in primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes were
obtained from the lists published by Vincenti and Brinckerhoff [13]. The logarithmic ratios of mRNA levels in IL1β (10 ng/ml)-treated chondrocytes to control mRNA levels were determined for 45 IL-1-responsive genes, whose
transcription initiation site was identifiable in the GenBank sequences or by the PEG program [37,38]. The logarithmic ratio makes it easy to characterize both
upregulation and downregulation to the control level,
and it has been widely used to model array-derived
expression data in yeast and human [3,39]. The described
SVD-based approach is effective for modelling both
upregulated and downregulated genes, and the positive
and negative values represent the upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Definition of promoter matrix
Prior to mathematical formulation, a promoter matrix
HnxM was defined, where n was the number of the IL-1responsive genes and M was the total number of TFBM
candidates. The element hij in HnxM represented the
number of appearance of the j-th TFBM candidate on the
5'-end flanking region, 300 bp in length in the current
study, of the i-th IL-1-responsive gene. The length of 300
bp was determined to minimize the least-square model
error from the upstream regions of 100 bp to 5000 bp
with a 100-bp interval. In this study, 512 TFBM candidates
(M = 512), 5-bp DNA sequences including 5'-AAAAA-3',
5'-AAAAC-3', etc., were initially screened without considering polarity of DNA strands, and the critical TFBMs were
selected by the SVD-based procedures described below.
Since the length of motifs varies from 5 to 30 bp in
TRANSFAC database, the 5-bp sequences were chosen as a
potential core binding motif and their linkage to known
motifs with redundancy was considered using TRANSFAC
database.
Formulation
Using the promoter matrix Hnxm, the mRNA level of each
IL-1-responsive gene was modelled [40]:

z= Hnxmx

where z was the mRNA expression vector representing the
logarithmic mRNA ratios for the 45 IL-1-responsive genes,
and x was the state vector representing the role of TFBM
candidates in achieving the observed values in z. Note that
we used M as the total number of TFBM candidates (M =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/276

512 in this study), m as the number of TFBMs in the SVDˆ
based model, and m as the estimate of m based on Akaike
information criterion below.
Akaike information criterion
In order to avoid underfitting or overfitting the mRNA
ratios with TFBM candidates, AIC was defined and used as
an indicator of statistical measure [41]:

AIC(m) = −2 log L( x , m) + 2m

(2)

ˆ
ˆ
where L( x , m) was the likelihood function, and x was
ˆ
the estimate of x. The value of x was determined using the
singular value decomposition procedure described below.
The likelihood of the expression vector, z, with the estiˆ
mate of the state vector, x , was calculated:
−

n

1
L( x , m) = (2πσ 2 ) 2 exp{− σ 2 ( z − Hnxm x)T ( z − Hnxm x)}
2

( 3)

where σ2 was a model error variance. Prior to constructing
the final SVD-based model, a set of preliminary models
for m = 1, 2, ..., M were built using the singular value
decomposition procedure, and AIC(m) was minimized by
ˆ
treating m as a parameter. Note that AIC( m ) ≤ AIC(m) for
ˆ
m = 1, 2, ..., M, and m = 8 in this study.
Singular value decomposition (SVD)
SVD is a matrix decomposition technique which can be
applied to any rectangular matrix. It decomposes a matrix
into two orthogonal matrices and one eigenvalue matrix.
Two orthogonal matrices represent the column and the
row spaces in the original matrix, and the eigenvalue
matrix relates these two spaces. In order to evaluate the
contribution of 512 potential TFBMs to the IL-1
responses, the promoter matrix HnxM was factorized using
SVD:

HnxM = UnxnΛnxMVMxMT

(4)

where Unxn(u1, u2, ..., un) was defined as the eigen gene
matrix, ΛnxM(λ1, λ2, ..., λn;OnXM-n) was a matrix containing
n eigen values in the first n column vectors, and VMxM(v1,
v2, ..., vM) was defined as an eigen TFBM matrix. Note that
Unxn and VMxM are orthogonal and therefore UnxnT Unxn =
Inxn and VMxMVMxMT = IMxM. In the Unxn space, the mRNA
expression vector, z, can be expressed as a linear combination of the orthogonal vectors u1, u2,..., un and the eigen
values λ1, λ2,...,λn with ki (i = 1, 2, ..., n):

C = [c1, c2,..., c512]
n

z = ∑ ki λi ui
i =1

( 5)

Determination of ki was achieved by projecting the vector
z to λiui direction. Therefore, taking an inner product
between z and λiui gave ki.
Since ui and vi are the associated bases in the gene space
and the TFBM space respectively, the factor ki (i = 1, 2,...,
n) for describing the expression in gene space can be used
to model the contribution of individual TFBMs in the
TFBM space. For instance, let us consider one extreme case
where z was parallel to u1. Then, a contribution of TFBMs
to z would be proportional to v1 and not affected by the
other vi (i ≠ 1) since the eigenvalue matrix ΛnxM does not
have any non-diagonal components. Therefore, the elements in v1 would be used to indicate potential importance of M TFBM candidates. In a general case, the SVD
procedure allowed us to evaluate n pairs of ui and vi
through λi and ki without conducting any combinatorial
search. In order to model the gene space using the
observed mRNA expression of z, the orthogonal vectors
(u1, u2,..., un) are linearly combined using ki (i = 1, 2,..., n).
In order to model the TFBM space, a linear combination
of the orthogonal vectors (v1, v1,..., vn) is made.
Based on the above rationale, we evaluated the linear
combination of the eigen TFBM vectors in a form of
n

a = ∑ ki vi . This vector a plays the similar role of zin Eq.
i =1

(5). M elements in a indicates the role and the contribution of M TFBM candidates. The positive/negative value
suggests a stimulatory/inhibitory role, and a larger absolute value implies a stronger contribution. Therefore, the
ˆ
ˆ
procedure to select m TFBMs is to choose a set of top m
ˆ
TFBMs whose value in a is larger than other (512 - m )
TFBMs. To include redundancy in TFBM consensus
sequences, a weighted linear combination of elements in
a can be used. In summary, the principal component analysis allows us to identify the principal expression components using the eigen gene vectors and to predict the
principal TFBM using the eigen TFBM vectors. With the
weighting factors defined from the observed value of z, the
vector a indicates the predicted contribution of individual
TFBM candidates to the observed expression pattern.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Monte Carlo simulations
In order to evaluate the SVD-based prediction of TFBMs,
the numerical simulations with GA were conducted using
the procedure described previously [42]. In a chromosome-like bit map, 512 TFBM candidates were embedded:

(6)

where each chromosomal element took "1" and "0" for
inclusion and non-inclusion in the model, respectively.
512

Note that

ˆ
∑ ci = m

for any chromosome, and the pro-

i=1

moter matrix was constructed based on the value of each
chromosomal element ci. Two hundred chromosomes
represented the population, and one chromosome in the
first generation corresponded to the SVD selection. In
each generation, 100 chromosomes with smaller errors
were recombined, and the other 100 chromosomes with
larger errors were mutated. The model error was defined

ˆ
as z - H nxm x

2

, and the state variable, x, was estimated

using a least-square scheme:

ˆ
x = (Hnxm T Hnxm )−1 Hnxm T z

(7)

ˆ
Note that n = 45 and m = m = 8 in GA. Monte Carlo simulation was also performed to evaluate numerically the
ˆ
SVD- and GA-based selection of TFBMs [42]. A set of m
TFBMs was randomly chosen from 512 TFBM candidates,
and the error distribution associated with the randomly
selected TFBMs was compared to the error in the modelbased prediction. The simulation was conducted 10,000
times.
Linkage map among TFBMs
The 8 TFBM candidates, derived from the GA analysis,
were linked to the biologically known TFBMs. We evaluated the 5-bp core consensus sequences identical to the
known TFBMs using TRANSFAC database [43]. Since the
motifs in the database ranges up to 30 bp, it is possible
that a 5-bp TFBM candidate corresponds to multiple
motifs in the database. Namely, the state vector could represent the combined role of binding motifs when the predicted motifs are shared among transcription factors.
