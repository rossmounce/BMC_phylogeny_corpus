Abstract
Background: An open, focal issue in evolutionary biology is how reproductive isolation and
speciation are initiated; elucidation of mechanisms with empirical evidence has lagged behind
theory. Under ecological speciation, reproductive isolation between populations is predicted to
evolve incidentally as a by-product of adaptation to divergent environments. The increased genetic
diversity associated with interspecific hybridization has also been theorized to promote the
development of reproductive isolation among independent populations. Using the fungal model
Neurospora, we founded experimental lineages from both intra- and interspecific crosses, and
evolved them in one of two sub-optimal, selective environments. We then measured the influence
that initial genetic diversity and the direction of selection (parallel versus divergent) had on the
evolution of reproductive isolation.
Results: When assayed in the selective environment in which they were evolved, lineages typically
had greater asexual fitness than the progenitors and the lineages that were evolved in the alternate,
selective environment. Assays for reproductive isolation showed that matings between lineages
that were adapted to the same environment had greater sexual reproductive success than matings
between lineages that were adapted to different environments. Evidence of this differential
reproductive success was observed at two stages of the sexual cycle. For one of the two observed
incompatibility phenotypes, results from genetic analyses were consistent with a two-locus, twoallele model with asymmetric (gender-specific), antagonistic epistasis. The effects of divergent
adaptation on reproductive isolation were more pronounced for populations with greater initial
genetic variation.
Conclusion: Divergent selection resulted in divergent adaptation and environmental
specialization, consistent with fixation of different alleles in different environments. When brought
together by mating, these alleles interacted negatively and had detrimental effects on sexual
reproductive success, in agreement with the Dobzhansky-Muller model of genetic incompatibilities.
As predicted by ecological speciation, greater reproductive isolation was observed among
divergent-adapted lineages than among parallel-adapted lineages. These results support that, given
adequate standing genetic variation, divergent adaptation can indirectly cause the evolution of
reproductive isolation, and eventually lead to speciation.

Background
Adaptation to different environments is postulated to play
a large role in speciation and adaptive radiation [1]. With
ecological speciation, reproductive isolation between
populations evolves incidentally as a by-product of adaptation to divergent environments [2,3]. There are three
potential sources of this reproductive isolation. First, the
traits that are under divergent selection may indirectly
reduce reproductive success by altering mate choice. Second, ecological mechanisms may contribute directly to
reproductive isolation among species. If two species are
specialized to different environments, interspecific
hybrids may have reduced fitness in both environments
because they lack the full complement of adaptive factors
possessed by each of the parental species and exhibit a
maladaptive intermediate phenotype. Third, divergent
adaptation may promote reproductive isolation through
genetic incompatibilities, as predicted by the
Dobzhansky-Muller model [4,5]. When populations
adapt to divergent environments, selection promotes sorting and fixation of different alleles in the alternate populations. Subsequent hybridization creates novel
combinations of alleles that have not been tested and
approved by selection, creating the possibility of negative,
genetic interactions [6]. Under the Dobzhansky-Muller
model, this antagonistic epistasis between incompatible
alleles at interacting loci causes reductions in reproductive
success. Given enough time, two completely separated
populations will inevitably develop genetic incompatibilities due to mutation and genetic drift. Does divergent
adaptation accelerate or increase the likelihood of the evolution of genetic incompatibilities, and thus speciation?
The amount of standing genetic variation in the ancestral
population before speciation has a major effect on the
evolution of reproductive isolation. Low-diversity populations may be restricted to adaptive peaks that are proximal
to that of their conspecific ancestors, thereby limiting
their ability to explore alternative adaptive peaks. Highdiversity populations created by interspecific hybridization may possess greater segregational variance, with the
potential for significant negative or positive epistasis
among genetic factors. Positive epistasis may allow hybrid
populations to access higher-fitness peaks elsewhere on
the fitness landscape, thereby facilitating greater and more
rapid evolutionary responses to novel environments. Furthermore, the level of potential divergence as a result of
differential sorting between lineages increases with
genetic variance. Hybrid speciation theory therefore suggests that the greater genetic variation associated with
hybrid populations may increase the likelihood and rate
of ecological speciation [7].
To test these key predictions of ecological and hybrid speciation, we developed an experimental evolution system

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/35

using the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Several
attributes make Neurospora ideal for this study. Like other
microbes, it is amenable to experimental evolution
because of short generation time, and ease of indeterminate propagation and archival storage [8]. The amount of
genetic variation in artificial populations can be controlled by crossing parents of known relatedness. Also, the
role of ecological specialization in promoting species
divergence in this genus finds support in phylogenetic
reconstructions [9].
Most importantly, Neurospora has a well-characterized sexual system with identifiable events associated with mating
and sexual development [10,11]. Defects that cause reproductive isolation can be easily recognized at numerous
stages in the sexual cycle [12-14]. In outbreeding Neurospora, mating occurs between haploid individuals of
opposite mating type (mat A or mat a). Each self-sterile
individual produces receptive "female" mating structures
(protoperithecia) and fertilizing "male" propagules
(conidia). Successfully fertilized protoperithecium
enlarge rapidly and develop into mature fruiting bodies
called perithecia. At this point, prezygotic isolation can be
assessed by perithecial production. Karyogamy, meiosis,
and mitosis occur to produce the haploid progeny
(ascospores) which are then forcibly ejected from the
perithecium. At this point, postzygotic isolation can be
assessed by progeny viability.
Most experimental-evolution studies of reproductive isolation have focused on premating isolation and mating
preference in Drosophila [3,15,16]. This form of isolation
does not play an important role in speciation in fungi and
plants because these organisms do not have "behaviour"
in the classical, zoological sense. Here we focus on the
incompatibilities that occur after mating (gamete transfer), which are central to reproductive isolation in all
eukaryotic organisms.
In a recent study of the unicellular yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, divergent adaptation resulted in both extrinsic
ecological isolation and intrinsic genetic incompatibilities
[17]. It is not known, however, if microbes with different
levels of biological complexity respond to divergent, ecological selection in similar ways [18]. Neurospora has a filamentous rather than unicellular growth form, with more
complex mating and sexual development than yeast. Here
we study speciation with a similar experimental approach
to that of ref. 17 but use a multicellular microbial system.
In brief, we evolved replicate lineages of Neurospora in one
of two sub-optimal, selective environments. The asexual
fitness of lineages was then measured to test for adaptation to the selective environment and trade-offs in the
alternate environment. To test for the development of
reproductive isolation (both prezygotic and postzygotic),

the success of matings between lineages was assessed
using two different measures. By varying the amount of
standing genetic (and phenotypic) diversity in the founding populations, we tested if increased variation caused by
hybridization facilitates adaptation and the evolution of
reproductive incompatibilities. To test if divergent adaptation increases the likelihood of the development of reproductive isolation, the effects of chance and divergent
selection were differentiated by comparing the reproductive success between parallel-adapted lineages and divergent-adapted lineages.

Results
Evolution regimen
The founding populations for Experiment L (low diversity) and Experiment H (high diversity) were produced by
an intraspecific and interspecific cross, respectively (Fig.
1).

The average sequence divergence between the parental
individuals in Exp. H was 4.87%, nearly three times
greater than that in Exp. L (1.63%; ref. 9). Replicate lineages of Neurospora were experimentally evolved for seven
cycles of propagation, with each cycle consisting of a sexual phase followed by an asexual phase (Fig. 1). Divergent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/35

selection was applied during asexual reproduction by
exposing the lineages to one of two sub-optimal, selective
environments: high salinity or low temperature. For Exp.
L, lineages evolved in high salinity or low temperature
were named LN or LT, respectively. For Exp. H, lineages
evolved in high salinity or low temperature were named
HN or HT, respectively. In total, each experimental lineage underwent 7 meiotic generations and ~1500 mitotic
generations.
Adaptation
At the end of the evolution regimen, we tested for adaptation by assaying the linear, mycelial growth rate of
evolved lineages in their respective selective environments
(high salinity or low temperature). All four lineage-classes
(LN, LT, HN, HT) had a significantly greater growth rate
than the mid-parent mean in the selective environment
(one tailed, df = 5, p ≤ 0.01 in each case), with an average
fitness advantage of 12.8% (± 1.2 SE). All four lineage
classes also had mean growth rates that were greater than
the fastest parental progenitor in the selective environment (Fig. 2), significantly for three lineage classes (one
tailed, df = 5; LN, p = 0.05; LT, p = 0.04; HN, p = 0.19; HT,
p = 0.02). On average, lineages gained a 3.8% (± 0.9 SE)
fitness advantage over the fastest parental progenitor.

rates were normalized over the growth rate of the fastest parental progenitor in each of the three environments. Asterisks
indicate means that were significantly different than 1.0, as determined by t-tests (see Methods). Errors bars are standard error
(n = 6).

To test for trade-offs, growth rate was assayed in the alternate, selective environment. The evolved lineages displayed an average fitness reduction of 1.2% (± 1.3 SE),
relative to fastest ancestor. Only the LT lineage class had a
significantly reduced growth rate in high salinity (Fig. 2;
one tailed, df = 5, p = 0.04). In the permissive environment (Fig. 2), each lineage class had a significantly greater
growth rate than the fastest parent (two tailed, df = 5, p ≤
0.04 in each case), with an average fitness gain of 6.8% (±
0.8 SE).
In nature, the growth rate of evolved lineages in relation
to each other, rather than in relation to the ancestor, is
what determines competitive fitness. When assayed in the
high-salinity environment, high-salinity-evolved lineages
had a greater mean growth rate than low-temperatureevolved lineages (one tailed, df = 5; LN > LT, p < 0.007; HN
> HT, p = 0.37). Similarly, low-temperature-evolved lineages had a greater growth rate than high-salinity-evolved

lineages when assayed in the low-temperature environment (LT > LN, p = 0.10; HT > HN, p = 0.02). When modeled with ANOVA, the interaction between assay
environment and selective environment was significant
for Exp. L (df = 1, p = 0.0038), but not for Exp. H (p =
0.19). Despite these mixed significance levels, the overall
pattern suggested a negative correlation of fitness gains
across environments.
Sexual reproductive success – progeny viability
To monitor the effects of environmental selection on the
sexual reproductive success among lineages, we assayed
progeny viability during the course of evolution. Assay
points 1–7 were designated at the end of each of the seven
sexual-asexual propagation cycles. Progeny viability
assays were performed by crossing each lineage with the
five other evolved lineages and measuring ascospore germination under permissive conditions. Given the reciprocity of matings regarding gender (male/female) and

mating type (mat A/mat a), 4 different matings were performed for each of the 15 pairwise combinations of lineages within each experiment. Thus, each assay comprised
60 matings and the scoring of approximately 10,000
ascospores.
Evolution in sub-optimal conditions initially reduced
progeny viability, however, regular sexual cycles subjected
the experimental lineages to selection for greater reproductive success. As a response, progeny viabilities
increased an average of 0.06 (± 0.06 SE) and 0.03 (± 0.02
SE) per successive assay point for Exp. L and H, respectively. Over the course of the evolution regimen, progeny
viabilities had nearly recovered to the values observed for
the original, parental crosses (Exp. L parental cross = 0.78;
Exp. H parental cross = 0.17).
To test for the effects of parallel and divergent selection on
reproductive success, we compared the progeny viability
of matings between lineages evolved in parallel selective
environments (PE matings) versus those evolved in divergent selective environments (DE matings). To account for
variation in overall means, progeny viability was normalized over the grand mean for each assay point, allowing
direct comparison of different assays. In Exp. L, progeny
viability of PE matings was greater than that for DE matings (Fig. 3a) for some but not all assay points. In the early
assays, significant differences were actually in the opposite
direction than predicted by ecological speciation. However, this pattern was reversed as evolution progressed: the
last two assay points showed significant differences (PE >
DE, Fig. 3). In Exp. H, the results were clearly consistent
with predictions: PE matings were significantly more successful than DE matings for assays points 3 through 7 (Fig.
3b).
We then modeled the effects of mating type and selective
environment on progeny viability in Exp. L and H. The
ANOVA included only assay points 6 and 7, the most
derived states of the lineages (Table 1). Because each lineage could act as a female or a male in different matings, we
analyzed these two gender roles independently. The mating type and selective environment of males were inconsequential to progeny viability (p ≥ 0.24 in each case). In
contrast, progeny viability was significantly affected by the
selective environment of the female (p ≤ 0.004 in both
cases). Subsequent analyses therefore were performed
separately on each lineage class as female.
In general, progeny viability was greater when females
were fertilized by males evolved in the parallel environment than when fertilized by males evolved in the divergent environment. These differences were significant at
both assay points for one of the two lineage classes in each
experiment: the LT and HN lineage classes in Exp. L and

lineages within lineage classes: PE > DE matings for all
three LT and HN lineages (data not shown). In addition,
PE matings were significantly more successful than DE
matings for 5 of the assay points along the course of evolution (data not shown, Fisher exact tests; LT, p ≤ 0.0004
in each case; HN, p < 0.0001 in each case), demonstrating
a clear trend through time.
Progeny viability in selective environments
All previous assays of progeny viability were performed
under permissive conditions. To examine the effects of
sub-optimal conditions, we also scored progeny viability
in high-salinity and low-temperature environments (30
matings, Exp. L). If environment-specific adaptation in
the asexual phase had a correlated effect on ascospore ger-

Sources of variation were mating type (mat A versus mat a), selective environment (high salinity versus low temperature), and their interaction.

mination, a U-shaped distribution of means across the
two panels in Figure 5 is expected (based on the partners
comprising each mating class). In the low-temperature
environment, the rank order of progeny viability for the
four mating classes was consistent with such a distribution. In the high-salinity environment, LN × LN matings
had unexpectedly low viabilities and did not display a correlated effect: this represented the only case where the
observed rank order did not match expectations. Owing to
the small sample size, few significant differences were
detected but notable trends did exist. In low temperature,
LT × LT had significantly greater progeny viability than the
other mating classes. For DE matings (Fig. 5), progeny viability was similar across both selective environments.
When the assay environment matched the environment
in which the female lineage had evolved, progeny viability
was greater (interaction between selective environment
and assay environment). This pattern again demonstrates
environment-specific adaptation and the importance of
the maternal contribution to progeny.

perithecial production were detected between PE and DE
matings (Fig. 6a; p > 0.67 for each lineage class as female).
For Exp. H, PE matings produced significantly greater
numbers of perithecia than DE matings, but only when
HT lineages acted as the female (Fig. 6b; p < 0.0001). In
HT(female symbol Ǩ) × HN(male symbol ǩ) matings,
perithecial production was greatly reduced compared to
wild-type levels (Fig. 6b). The protoperithecia responded
to fertilization by expanding and darkening slightly, the
typical response seen in wild-type matings. However, the
vast majority of perithecia aborted at this stage of development and never matured into the larger, black perithecia.
In the reciprocal HN(female symbol Ǩ) × HT(male symbol ǩ) matings, an incompatibility phenotype was not
observed: nearly all perithecia developed to maturity as
normal. All combinations of HT and HN lineages shared
this pattern of asymmetrical reproductive isolation (data
not shown). The two types of matings differed only by
which lineage class functioned as the female and male
partner, demonstrating that the incompatibility was
expressed in a gender-role-specific fashion.

Sexual reproductive success – perithecial production
Progeny viability measures postzygotic isolation and
reflects the quality of progeny produced at the completion
of sexual reproduction. Perithecial production measures
prezygotic isolation and reflects the success of fertilization
events. Perithecial number also influences the quantity of
progeny produced, assuming that more perithecia produce more progeny.

Genetic basis of incompatibility phenotype
The genetic basis of the interactions causing the reductions in perithecial production was investigated further.
Sixty f1 progeny were isolated from crosses between HT2
and HN2 lineages. These progeny were mated back to the
HT2 and HN2 parents, in both gender roles, and perithecial production was assayed.

Perithecial production was measured at assay point 7 and
evidence for reproductive isolation was observed in Exp.
H but not Exp. L. For Exp. L, no significant differences in

The discriminated phenotype, defined as the inability of a
male to activate an HT2 female to produce >1 perithecia/

that confer discrimination or non-discrimination were
named dmad and dman, respectively.

inatory phenotype, defined as a female producing >3
times more perithecia when fertilized by HT2 males than
when fertilized by HN2 males, segregated 30:30 (χ2, p =
1.0). These two lines of evidence suggested that the phenotype was controlled by a single, Mendelian locus. This
locus was named dfe for "discriminatory female", and the
alleles that confer discrimination or non-discrimination
were named dfed and dfen, respectively.

The inferred genotypes of the HT2 and HN2 parents were
dfed dman and dfen dmad, respectively. Among the 60 f1
progeny, we observed 34 parental (19 dfed dman; 15 dfen
dmad) and 26 recombinant (11 dfed dmad; 15 dfen dman)
genotypes, providing evidence that the two loci were
genetically unlinked (χ2, p = 0.55). We selected 8 f1 progeny (4 of each mating type, 2 of each two-locus genotype)
and assayed perithecial production in the 32 possible
matings among them. All observed phenotypes matched
predictions based on the female × male genotype combinations: perithecial production was reduced only for matings in which the female was dfed and the male was dmad
(Table 2).

When these progeny were grown as males and used to fertilize discriminatory HT2 females, perithecial production
values again formed a bimodal distribution (not shown).

We were able to reconstitute the original, parental HT2
and HN2 genotypes, and associated phenotypes, by crossing recombinant f1 genotypes (dfen dman × dfed dmad).

Discussion
The founding populations of Neurospora were composed
of multiple individuals with standing genetic variation. As
evolution progressed, the genetic composition of these
initially identical lineages could change by the sorting of
pre-existing and new alleles, or by the creation of novel
allele combinations through recombination. How these
processes interact with the different types and strengths of
selective pressures during the evolution regimen ultimately determines the phenotype of the end-point lineages. In this study, we investigated the effects of these
processes on adaptive increases in asexual fitness and the
evolution of reproductive isolation.
The best evidence for adaptation is when the evolved lineages have greater fitness than their most-fit ancestor (Fig.
2). Although specialization to one environment may be
associated with fitness reductions in other environments
[19,20], we found only limited evidence for such fitness
trade-offs (Fig. 2). These results are fully consistent with
the recent experimental study of speciation in yeast [17].
Taken together, the mycelial growth rate data demonstrate
that the negative correlation of fitness gains in the two
selective environments was a result of divergent environmental selection. Surprisingly, divergent selection also
caused a correlated response of an increase in general
growth rate in the permissive environment (Fig. 2). Furthermore, environmental adaptation in the asexual phase
had a correlated effect on ascospore germination in those
selective environments (Fig. 5). This pattern is expected if
ascospore germination is considered to be the first step in
mycelial growth.

which the female lineage was fertilized by males evolved in
the parallel environment (PE matings, n = 12) or the divergent environment (DE matings, n = 18), are in grey or white,
respectively. For clarity, the paternal lineage-classes are also
shown. Full assays were performed once and four times for
Experiment L and H, respectively. Asterisks indicate significance differences between mating classes, as determined by
two-tailed t-tests. Errors bars are standard error.

Among 24 f2 progeny, we obtained 13 parental (9 dfed
dmad; 4 dfen dman) and 11 recombinant (6 dfed dman; 5 dfen
dmad) genotypes (χ2, p = 0.51). Again, the two alleles at
both loci segregated evenly in these f2 progeny (χ2, p >
0.22 in both cases).

Compared to previous experimental studies with fungi
[17,21-24], the levels of environmental adaptation we
observed here were unexpectedly low. We used mycelial
growth rate as a proxy for fitness because it was the most
obvious trait under selection; the mycelial sector with the
fastest growth rate was transferred as the founder for the
next culture tube. Other asexual traits, such as biomass
accumulation, may have also been under selection, but
were not measured. In addition, selection during sexual
cycles may have counteracted selection during the asexual
phase, causing a reduction in the net asexual fitness gains
[25-27].
Another factor potentially impeding adaptation is the
coenocytic growth form of this filamentous fungus.
Hyphae of Neurospora are densely packed with nuclei that
are capable of migrating between hyphal compartments.
The interconnectedness of the mycelial network may have
a homogenizing effect, interfering with competition
among genetically different nuclei. Individual nuclei
have, at best, only partial control of the phenotype and are
not fully exposed to selection. Propagation of lineages by

conidia, in which individual nuclei are more exposed to
selection than in hyphal tips, may have allowed for more
efficient competition and a greater adaptive response [28].
Further comparative, experimental studies are needed to
determine the relationship between growth form and
adaptive potential of filamentous fungi.
When ecological speciation via divergent adaptation
occurs, there are two possible underlying causes of sexual
reproductive isolation. First, direct selection on the sexual
phase may cause specialization to a particular environment, such that sexual reproduction is disrupted when
not within that environment. In this case, reductions in
reproductive success are caused by interactions between
adapted genotypes and the environment ("ecological isolation"). Second, divergent selection during the asexual
phase may cause the accumulation of negatively interacting loci, which consequently have indirect effects on the
sexual phase. In this case, reductions in reproductive success are caused by antagonistic epistasis between genetic
factors in the adapted genomes ("genetic isolation").
To discriminate the direct effects of divergent adaptation
during the sexual phase from the indirect effects of divergent adaptation during the asexual phase, these two selective pressures were experimentally decoupled. The
Neurospora populations were exposed to selective, divergent environments only during the asexual phase. Most
organisms spend the majority of their life in the asexual
phase, so adaptive evolutionary responses to environmental selection typically occur in this phase. At no point in
our evolution regimen was reproductive isolation the target of selection. The sexual phase was performed under
identical, permissive, conditions for all lineages. Thus,
any differential patterns of sexual reproductive success
could be attributed to the indirect effects of divergent
selection on non-sexual traits that had overpowered the
unifying effects of parallel selection on the sexual phase.
Our experimental design also allowed us to identify
genetic isolation. When sexual reproductive success was
assayed in the permissive environment, any patterns of

differential reproductive success could be attributed solely
to genetic isolation, and not to ecological isolation. One
may argue that, in nature, genetic isolation is far more
important than ecological isolation because the latter is,
by definition, dependent upon the environment. Incompatibilities caused by intrinsic genetic interactions may be
permanent despite changing environments.
We could determine if the development of reproductive
isolation was caused by random effects of chance or by
deterministic effects of divergent selection. If the evolution of reproductive incompatibilities was random, these
phenotypes should not be correlated with the selective
environments: parallel and divergent selection should
have similar effects on reproductive isolation. Thus, divergent selection can be implicated as the causal factor only
when greater reproductive isolation is observed between
divergent-adapted lineages than between parallel-adapted
lineages (Figs. 3, 4, 6).
In general, the conclusion that divergent adaptation promotes the development of reproductive isolation was supported by results from progeny viability assays,
particularly from the later stages of the experiments (Fig.
3). Differential progeny viability that was consistent with
ecological speciation was observed in almost all comparisons made at the level of lineage class as female (Fig. 4).
The two lineage classes (LT and HN) that drove the trend
were evolved in different environments, and were derived
from founding populations with different levels and
sources of genetic variation. Thus, differential progeny
viability was not dependent upon a particular selective
environment, or particular genetic components possessed
by the progenitors. Rather, divergent selection in divergent environments caused the patterns of differential
reproductive success.
Perithecial production assays for Exp. H, but not Exp. L,
were consistent with divergent adaptation promoting the
development of reproductive isolation (Fig. 6). For Exp.
H, females produced more perithecia when fertilized by
parallel-adapted males than when fertilized by diver-

gently-adapted males. When HT lineages functioned as
the female, the discrepancy was quite dramatic: PE matings produced, on average, 9.39 times more perithecia
than DE matings.
The incompatibility phenotype and its inheritance pattern
support a two-locus, two-allele model with asymmetric,
antagonistic epistasis. The two loci, dfe and dma, interact
in a gender-role-specific fashion to modulate the progression through the sexual cycle. Antagonistic interactions
between the dfed and the dmad alleles cause major reductions in perithecial production, but only when the female
possesses the dfed allele and the male possesses the dmad
allele. The reciprocal pairing, and all other allele pairings,
do not result in the incompatibility phenotype. This
model is fully compatible with the Dobzhansky-Muller
model.
Reductions in reproductive success are compounded over
the successive stages of a single life cycle. When perithecial
production and progeny viability are combined, PE matings have a 7.64-fold advantage over DE matings for Exp.
H. For Exp. L, in which the degree of differential reproductive success was much lower, PE matings have only a 1.13fold (13%) advantage over DE matings. Although this is
not a large difference, one must consider that these effects
are compounded over successive generations, allowing
minor disparities in reproductive success to have substantial consequences on gene flow between populations.
We are aware of only six other experimental evolution
studies in which the effects of divergent selection and
genetic drift could be separated. Recent work with experimental populations of yeast clearly demonstrated that
divergent adaptation resulted in significantly greater
reproductive isolation than parallel adaptation [17]. The
other five studies all used Drosophila as the experimental
system, but obtained mixed results. In four studies [2932], divergent selection had greater effects than parallel
selection. In another study [33], however, the predictions
of ecological speciation were not supported.
This study revealed the strong influence that the maternal
partner has on the success of a mating. These results are
explicable for Neurospora because the female bears nearly
the whole burden of sexual reproduction. The maternal
partner forms complex structures for mating, actively
senses the presence of a male, and produces most of the
tissue comprising a mature perithecium. In contrast, the
only role of the male is to passively donate nuclei to the
female.
Increased genetic variance caused by interspecific hybridization allows for both negative and positive epistasis, thus
expanding the fitness distribution in both directions. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/35

Dobzhansky-Muller model focuses on negative interactions between heterospecific genomes that may cause less
fit genotypes. Hybrid speciation theory focuses on positive interactions (and transgressive segregation) that may
create more fit genotypes. In this sense, the two theories
are opposite sides of the same coin. Here we tested
whether the potential benefits of positive epistasis could
overpower the potential detriments of negative epistasis,
regarding the overall fitness of lineages and their ability to
adapt; the results of our experiment suggest they cannot.
Even though the multiple rounds of sex and recombination should have allowed the separation and purging of
negatively interacting factors, lineages from the highdiversity Exp. H did not adapt to the selective environments more than the lineages from the low-diversity Exp.
L. When mycelial growth rates in all three environments
are considered (Fig. 2), it appears that Exp. L lineages actually had greater responses (both direct and correlated) to
selection than Exp. H lineages.
Results from progeny viability and perithecial production
assays supported predictions from hybrid speciation theory: differential reproductive success was more common
and more striking in Exp. H than in Exp. L (Figs. 3, 4, 6).
Exp. H was initiated from a cross between two species, N.
crassa and N. intermedia, with nearly complete reproduction isolation [12-14]. The founding population likely
contained considerable genetic variance for reproductive
success. We hypothesize that, as variation sorted out during the course of evolution, lineages became fixed for particular combinations of compatible genomic regions.
Parallel adaptation during the asexual phase promoted
the fixation of similar genomic regions. Divergent adaptation promoted the fixation of dissimilar genomic regions,
thereby increasing the likelihood of genetic incompatibilities among lineages.
Identifying the genomic regions and, ultimately, the genes
that interact to produce the incompatibility phenotypes is
critical to understanding the causes of reproductive isolation. Further research should investigate the genomic
composition of the evolved lineages, and its correlation
with adaptation and incompatibility. Genomic regions
consistently shared among parallel-selected lineages
could point to the genes or mutations under selection and
involved in adaptation. The most discrete differences in
reproductive success were in perithecial production, so it
might be possible to determine the location and characteristics of the two genetic factors (dfe and dma). At this
point, it is unclear if these loci encode single genes or sets
of tightly linked genes. By genetic manipulation and controlled crosses, one could determine precisely the nature
and mechanism of the antagonistic interaction that causes
the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated three important aspects of speciation in a developmentally complex eukaryotic microbe.
First, divergent selection on a common, founding population resulted in divergent adaptation and environmental
specialization. Evolved populations typically had higher
fitness in their selective environment than in the alternate
environment in which they had not evolved. This negative
correlation of fitness across environments provides the
phenotypic variation upon which ecological mechanisms
of isolation can act. Second, divergent adaptation resulted
in greater reproductive isolation than parallel adaptation.
Evidence for differential reproductive success was
observed at two stages of the sexual cycle: perithecial production and progeny viability. The genetic basis for one of
the observed incompatibility phenotypes can be
explained by a two-locus, two-allele model with asymmetric, antagonistic epistasis. Third, the effects of divergent adaptation on reproductive isolation were more
pronounced for populations with greater initial genetic
variation. Interspecific hybridization may produce novel
variation that allows the populations to follow previously
inaccessible evolutionary trajectories. Taken together, our
results support the hypothesis that, given adequate standing genetic variation, divergent adaptation can indirectly
cause the evolution of differential reproductive success,
and eventually lead to speciation.

Methods
Strains
Two strains of N. crassa subgroup NcA (D143 [mat A,
FGSC 8903] and D69 [mat a, FGSC 8829]) and one strain
of N. intermedia subgroup NiA (D73 [mat a, FGSC 8833])
were used in this study. Species tester strains of N. crassa
(FGSC 6682 [mat A] and FGSC 6683 [mat a]) were used
for mating-type determination. Information on these
strains can be obtained from refs. 9 and 14, or the Fungal
Genetics Stock Center (FGSC [34]). Unless otherwise
stated, strains were cultured on Vogel's Minimal (VM)
medium (1× Vogel's salt solution, 1.5% sucrose, 1.5%
agar).
Crossing and progeny isolation
The Neurospora species used in this experiment are heterothallic (self-sterile). Each individual can act as a "female"
or "male", depending upon how the individual was prepared for mating and how the cross was performed. Gender is determined by the direction of fertilization and
nuclear transfer. The individual or population to act as the
female was grown in 13 × 100 mm test tubes containing
slanted Westergaard's Synthetic Crossing (SC) medium
(1× SC salts, 1% sucrose, 2% agar) to promote the development of specialized, female mating structures (protoperithecia). The male was grown on VM medium to
produce mitotic propagules (conidia). After 4 d, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/35

female was fertilized with a dense suspension of conidia
harvested from the male. Hair-like protrusions (trichogynes) from the protoperithecia sense and actively grow
towards nearby males through chemotaxis. Successfully
fertilized hyphae proliferate within the enlarging protoperithecium that develops into a mature fruiting body
(perithecium). Within the perithecium, apical segments
of the fertilized hyphae (asci) undergo karyogamy, meiosis, and one mitotic division, with each ascus yielding
eight haploid progeny (ascospores). When mature, the
asci forcibly eject the ascospores out of an apical opening
(ostiole) in the perithecium: the ascospores adhere to the
inside test tube wall. Ascospores were harvested 18 d after
fertilization, then heat-shocked for 40 min at 60°C to activate the germination process. Ascospores were spread on
colony-restricting sorbose medium (1× Vogel's salt solution, 2.0% sorbose, 0.05% dextrose, 2.0% agar) and
allowed to germinated for 24 h. Viable colonies formed by
individual ascospores were transferred to separate test
tubes. The mating type of progeny was determined by
spotting conidial suspensions on lawns of female-receptive mat A and mat a tester strains.
Founding populations
To produce the low-diversity, founding populations for
Experiment L, an intraspecific cross between N. crassa
D143 and N. crassa D69 was performed. For Experiment
H, an interspecific cross between N. crassa D143 and N.
intermedia D73 was used produce the hybrid, high-diversity, founding populations. Note that N. crassa D143 was
a parent common to both experiments. The sequence
divergence between parental individuals was the mean
uncorrected genetic distance from four independent loci
[9]. For each experiment, 25 progeny of each mating type
were isolated. The individuals in each mating-type class
were grown to the point of conidiation, harvested, then
mixed in approximately equal proportions in sterile distilled water. Other than the hybrid origin of the founding
populations in Exp. H, all other protocols were the same
for Exp. L and H.
Asexual propagation
For Exp. L, the 25-genotype, mat A founding population
was divided into two groups of three sub-lineages, designated LN1-A, LN2-A, LN3-A, and LT1-A, LT2-A, LT3-A.
Similarly, the mat a founding population was divided into
sub-lineages designated LN1-a, LN2-a, LN3-a, and LT1-a,
LT2-a, LT3-a. Lineages consisted of paired sub-lineages of
opposite mating type; for example, lineage LN1 consisted
of sub-lineages LN1-A and LN1-a. The same was done for
Exp. H, except the lineages were given HN and HT names
(see Fig. 1). To initiate each of the 12 sub-lineages, a 50 μl
aliquot of the founding population mixture, containing
approximately 5 million conidia, was inoculated into the
end of glass tubes (2.5 × 30 cm) filled horizontally with

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:35

20 ml of solid media (1.5% agar). Conidia typically contain 2–3 nuclei, so the inoculum represents between
10–15 million nuclei. The LN and HN lineages were propagated asexually in a high salinity environment (VM
medium with 0.7 M NaCl), whereas the LT and HT lineages were propagated in low temperature environment
(VM medium incubated at 12°C). The sub-lineages of
opposite mating type were propagated separately to avoid
the loss of one mating type by drift. When cultures neared
the end of tubes, a 15 × 20 mm strip of the entire leading
colony front was transferred to a new tube with fresh
medium. Not only were hyphae growing on the surface of
the medium, but significant amounts of submerged and
aerial hyphae were present. Thus, we assumed that 100%
of the 300 mm2 of two-dimensional area was colonized.
Given that the average hyphal strand is 12 μm wide, and
using the calculated nuclear densities (see below), we estimated that our asexual propagation regimen transferred
approximately 25 million nuclei between successive culture tubes.
Experimental lineages underwent a total of 450 cm of
asexual growth. Determination of the number of mitotic
generations the lineages had evolved is not straight-forward for Neurospora. First, the coenocytic mycelium has
numerous nuclei per hyphal compartment, and nuclei can
migrate freely between compartments. Second, mitosis is
not synchronized across nuclei. Third, nuclear division is
not restricted to the growing front of the colony. These
characteristics make tracking the history of individual
nuclei impossible. Despite these difficulties, we estimated
the number of cell cycles by two methods. The first estimate relied on the correlation between cell cycle duration
and mycelial extension rate. Given a cell cycle time of 1.5
h [35] and a growth rate of 2.0 mm/h at 22°C on VM
medium, 16.67 cell cycles are completed for each 5 cm of
growth. The second estimate relied on the number of
nuclei per unit length of hyphal filament. Neurospora
hyphae are densely nucleated, with an estimated 1000
nuclei per 1 mm of hyphae [36,37]. A single hyphal filament of 5 cm in length, which approximates the length of
the actively growing colony front, would contain ~50,000
nuclei. Assuming a single initial nucleus, and that all
nuclei remain mitotically active, 15–16 cell cycles would
be needed to generate 50,000 nuclei and 5 cm of growth.
Thus, the two methods gave similar results, and we estimate that 450 cm of asexual growth represents approximately 1500 mitotic generations. Our generation
calculations (16.67 cell cycles in 5 cm) are very conservative compared to estimates from other filamentous fungi
(e.g. ref 38; 115 cell cycles in 3 cm), so we may in fact be
greatly underestimating the generation number. Moreover, our estimates do not include any of the mitotic generations that occurred during the sexual cycles and progeny
isolation.

Sexual cycles
Asexual evolution was interspersed with six cycles of sexual reproduction (Fig. 1), with an average of 68 cm of
asexual growth between cycles. To maintain the genetic
cohesiveness of lineages, genetic exchange was achieved
by crossing each sub-lineage with its paired sub-lineage of
opposite mating type. To reconstitute each sub-lineage, 20
progeny of the appropriate mating-type were isolated and
mixed in approximately equal proportions in sterile distilled water. Further asexual evolution was re-initiated
from approximately 5 million conidia in solution. Including the initial founding cross, lineages underwent a total
of 7 sexual cycles.
Mycelial growth rate
Cultures were inoculated near the perimeter of petri plates
(100 × 15 mm) containing the appropriate medium. To
allow cultures to acclimate to the assay environment and
reach a steady-state growth rate, measurements were
started only after the culture had grown approximately 2
cm or more. Rates were averaged over the entire assay
period, the duration of which depended upon the environment. Growth rates were determined for each sub-lineage by averaging three replicated measurements. The
permissive environment was VM medium at 22°C. Mycelial growth rates were measured at the end of the evolution regimen.

To test for adaptation, the growth rate of an evolved sublineage was divided by the growth rate of the fastest parental progenitor. The N. crassa D143 parent was used in all
cases because it had a greater growth rate than the other
parent, for both Exp. L and H, and in all environments.
The statistical significance of deviations from 1.0 was
determined by t-tests. Tests for adaptation (>1) or tradeoffs (<1) were one-tailed, whereas tests for correlated
responses in the permissive environment were two-tailed.
Sexual reproductive success – progeny viability
Progeny viability assays were performed by mating sublineages from the same experiment. A culture from each
sub-lineage was grown for 3 d on VM slants, then used to
inoculate 5 SC slants for mating. The physiological states
of cultures prior to mating were similar because all cultures were grown outside of the selective environments,
under permissive conditions, for two transfers: first on VM
slants, then on SC slants. These steps ensured that the
stress of growing in the selective environments did not
affect reproductive success or confound the assessment of
genetic isolation. Progeny viability assays consisted of 60
matings: each of the 12 sub-lineages was fertilized by the
5 different sub-lineages of opposite mating type. Each
pairing of two sub-lineages consisted of two reciprocal
matings: one with the mat A partner as female, one with
the mat a partner as female. This design allowed the

assessment of female function to be separated from male
function.
For each mating, heat-shocked ascospores were spotted
on sorbose medium and allowed to germinate at 22°C for
24 h. Progeny viability was quantified as the proportion of
ejected ascospores that germinated to produce hyphae.
For the full assays in the permissive environment, we
scored an average of 170 ascospores from each mating,
resulting in an average of 10,168 ascospores per assay. The
significance of differences between mating classes was
determined from germination/non-germination frequencies using Fisher Exact tests. Matings were weighted in
inverse proportion to the number of ascospores scored,
such that each mating contributed equally to the statistic.
To represent the variation among matings within classes,
germination counts were converted to proportions and
standard errors were calculated.
When progeny viability was scored in the selective environments, we used only the 30 matings in which the mat
A partner was female. Analyses of full assays showed that
the mating type of the female did not affect reproductive
success. These assays were performed at assay point 7 for
Exp. L.
Sexual reproductive success – perithecial production
The female was inoculated and grown on SC plates for 4
d to develop receptive protoperithecia. A 2.5 μl aliquot of
a conidial suspension made from the male was spotted
onto the female. After 8 d, we counted the maximum
number of perithecia in the field of view of a dissecting
scope at 50× magnification (19.63 mm2), from which the
number of perithecia per mm2 was calculated. At this
developmental stage, successfully fertilized protoperithecia have commenced sexual development, as indicated by
a darkening of the perithecial wall and the formation of
beaks or beak-like protrusions. Such fruiting bodies were
classified as perithecia. Protoperithecia that had not commenced sexual development by day 8 never matured into
perithecia, as verified by inspection of the same areas 7 d
later.

The concentration of conidia in the fertilizing solution
was great enough that all protoperithecia presumably had
access to conidia. When a subsample of fertilizations was
repeated with 1/10 and 1/100 dilutions of conidial solutions, the same number of perithecia were produced.
Thus, females were over 100× saturated by males.
