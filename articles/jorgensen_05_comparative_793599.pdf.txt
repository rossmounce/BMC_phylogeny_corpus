Abstract
Background: The availability of abundant sequence data from key model organisms has made
large scale studies of molecular evolution an exciting possibility. Here we use full length cDNA
alignments comprising more than 700,000 nucleotides from human, mouse, pig and the Japanese
pufferfish Fugu rubrices in order to investigate 1) the relationships between three major lineages of
mammals: rodents, artiodactyls and primates, and 2) the rate of evolution and the occurrence of
positive Darwinian selection using codon based models of sequence evolution.
Results: We provide evidence that the evolutionary splits among primates, rodents and
artiodactyls happened shortly after each other, with most gene trees favouring a topology with
rodents as outgroup to primates and artiodactyls. Using an unrooted topology of the three
mammalian species we show that since their diversification, the pig and mouse lineages have on
average experienced 1.44 and 2.86 times as many synonymous substitutions as humans,
respectively, whereas the rates of non-synonymous substitutions are more similar. The analysis
shows the highest average dN/dS ratio in the human lineage, followed by the pig and then the
mouse lineages. Using codon based models we detect signals of positive Darwinian selection in
approximately 5.3%, 4.9% and 6.0% of the genes on the human, pig and mouse lineages respectively.
Approximately 16.8% of all the genes studied here are not currently annotated as functional genes
in humans. Our analyses indicate that a large fraction of these genes may have lost their function
quite recently or may still be functional genes in some or all of the three mammalian species.
Conclusions: We present a comparative analysis of protein coding genes from three major
mammalian lineages. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of codon-based likelihood models in
detecting selection and it illustrates the value of sequencing organisms at different phylogenetic
distances for comparative studies.

Background
Large scale sequencing projects of many different species
allow us to investigate phylogenetic issues in much more
detail and to identify whether certain genes have had an
extraordinary evolution in one or more species and thus
gain insight into the actions of natural selection. Despite
the sequencing of an increasing number of mammalian
genomes and the implementation of more sophisticated
evolutionary models using maximum likelihood and
Bayesian methodology, the branching order within the
mammalian phylum is still not completely resolved. The
main reason for this uncertainty is that the diversification
of these orders occurred over a short period of time, making the inference of branching order a difficult problem.
One of the highly debated issues concerns the relative
order of branching among primates, artiodactyls and
rodents [1-9]. Here, the Japanese pufferfish Fugu rubrices is
used as an outgroup to estimate the branching order of the
three species relative to each other.
Codon based models [10,11] allow for powerful analysis
of protein coding nucleotide sequences. Evolutionary
hypotheses may be tested using likelihood ratio tests
between nested models. For an introduction to the practical use of these models see [12], for a more thorough
review of the methodology see [13]. The parameter of primary interest is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω), also known as the dN/dS ratio.
The dN/dS ratio measures the relative importance of evolutionary forces that have shaped a particular protein. A
dN/dS ratio significantly larger than one strongly suggests
that positive Darwinian selection has acted on the protein. Different extensions to the basic codon model exist,
and these can be divided into three main categories: (1)
Lineage-specific models that average ω over sites but differentiate between lineages [14]; (2) site-specific models
that average ω over lineages but differentiate over sites

[15]; (3) branch-site specific models that combine the two
previous extensions by allowing ω to vary over sites in all
background lineages, but allow for a different value of ω
in one or more pre-specified lineages [16]. The models we
use here and their relationships are shown in Table 1.
Numerous studies have shown the ability of the site-specific and the branch-site specific models to detect positive
selection in cases where the branch-specific models did
not, indicating that averaging over sites is generally a more
serious problem than averaging over lineages and that in
many cases using a branch-site specific model increases
the power to detect positive selection [17-22].
In a recent study of cDNA trios of human, mouse and
chimpanzee a codon based branch-site specific model was
used to search for human genes that have undergone positive selection since our divergence from other primates
[23]. Here, a similar search is done on a different phylogenetic level using a collection of porcine genes. While the
study by Clark and colleagues concentrates on the divergence between humans and chimpanzees (branch a in
Figure 1) our study searches for genes that have undergone positive selection since the divergence of primates,
artiodactyls and rodents. Several recent studies have
shown that some of the branch-site specific models under
certain conditions might have a high false positive rate
when used to detect positively selected sites [24,25]. This
problem has recently been addressed by Yang and colleagues with the implementation of a new Bayes empirical
Bayes (BEB) method for predicting positively selected
sites. This new method is much better at avoiding false
positives while still retaining a high sensitivity (Z. Yang,
pers. comm.). Here we use the new and improved BEB
version of the branch-site specific model originally presented in [23] to detect genes that may have been influenced by positive selection.

Results
The distribution of sequence lengths of the 1120 threespecies alignments is shown in Figure 2. Since the full
length cDNAs were assembled from random ESTs, there is
a bias towards assembling relatively short genes. Therefore the subset of genes used in this analysis is not a random sample from the pig genome. This decreases the
power of our evolutionary tests, since short alignments
have less power when testing for positive selection, but we
do not anticipate any other systematic bias in our results.
Mammalian phylogeny
The relative branching order of the three mammalian species was investigated with the individual genes as well as
with a concatenated super gene. Using the empirical
amino acid substitution model of Whelan and Goldman
[26] we maximized the likelihood under the three conflicting topologies shown in Figure 3a–c. In 123 of the 988
alignments all amino acids are identical in the three mammalian species giving us no information to discriminate
between the three topologies. Of the remaining 865 alignments 245 favour topology A, while 440 and 180 favour
topology B and topology C respectively. A concatenated
super gene of all 988 alignments clearly favoured topology B over topology A, which again has a higher likelihood than topology C, consistent with the results from
the individual gene comparisons (Table 2.).

We used the baseml program of PAML to compare the
three topologies in a nucleotide based framework. Different nucleotide based substitution models were used to
maximize the likelihood on the three topologies for each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/2

of the three codon positions separately. The results of
using different models of nucleotide evolution were
highly similar so here we only discuss the results obtained
with the HKY85 model [27]. The results based on the
third codon position shows that Fugu is too distantly
related to the three mammals to be informative in placement of the root of the mammals (results not shown). The
first and second codon positions do not show such
saturation and should therefore be useful in comparing
the three topologies. Consistent with the results based on
the amino acid substitution model we see that topology B
is favoured in most genes, followed by topology A and
topology C, respectively. The actual numbers from the second codon position are 215, 386 and 179 in favour of
topology A, topology B and topology C respectively and
208 alignments are uninformative. The corresponding
numbers for the first codon position are 215, 545, 175
and 53 (Table 2.).
The internal branch is rather short in all cases. Therefore
in the remaining analyses we treat the mouse, human, pig
split as a trifurcation. Depending on which topology is
actually the right one, the only bias introduced by treating
the topology as a star tree, as shown in Figure 3d, is a
minor overestimation of the branch length of the species
that actually roots the other two.
The rates of evolution
The three-species alignments were used to estimate the
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of
the three branches under the free ratio model, see Table 3.
Figure 4a–f shows the distribution of the synonymous
and nonsynonymous branch lengths for each gene in all
three species. The synonymous rates are significantly different between the three species. The average synonymous
substitution rate, estimated using the concatenated super
gene, is approximately 2.86 times larger in mouse compared to pig, and approximately 1.44 times larger in pig
than in human. The nonsynonymous rates are more similar among the three species. The corresponding values for
the nonsynonymous rates are 2.08 and 1.17 respectively.
Table 3 shows the mean, median and variance of both the
synonymous and nonsynonymous rate distributions as
well as the values obtained from the concatenated super
gene. The average values from the individual genes are
highly similar to the results obtained from the concatenated super gene.
Positive Darwinian selection
The dN/dS ratios on the three different lineages were estimated under the free ratio model (Figure 4g–i). Most
genes in all three species have an average dN/dS ratio very
close to zero with the average dN/dS ratio higher in
human than in pig, which again is higher than in the
mouse lineage.

The one ratio model averages over sites and lineages,
which makes this an extremely conservative method of
detecting positive selection. Only four of the 1120 threespecies alignments have an average dN/dS ratio larger
than one, see Table 4, and of those only one is significantly larger than one (XM_165930). The free ratio model
allows each lineage to have its own dN/dS ratio. This
model has slightly more power than the one ratio model
due to its ability to find lineage specific signals. The
likelihood ratio test (LRT) of these two models should not
be considered as a stringent test for positive selection, but
more as a test for different selective forces among lineages.
The LRT shows that 154 genes have significantly different
dN/dS ratios among lineages at the 5% significance level,
73 at 1% and 41 at the 0.1% level of significance. Table 5
shows the 24 genes that have a dN/dS ratio larger than one
in one or more lineages as well as the result from each
gene of a LRT that tests whether the estimated value of ω
is significantly larger than one. As with the one ratio
model only one gene shows a result significantly larger

than one. The gene is the same one as reported with the
one ratio model (XM_165930) and the lineage with a dN/
dS ratio significantly larger than one is the lineage leading
to pig.
Several studies have shown that averaging over sites is
more conservative when searching for positive selection
than is averaging over lineages. The branch-site specific
model A and model B [16] were originally designed to
search for genes where only a small fraction of codons in
a specific foreground lineage has evolved under positive
selection. Several studies have shown that the original
models are prone to predicting false positives under certain conditions, and one should therefore be very careful
drawing conclusions from studies based on those models.
Here we use a new and improved version of a branch-site
model developed for the analyses of human, chimpanzee
and mouse gene trios [23]. The new model we use here is
implemented in PAML v. 3.14 and uses the new and
improved Bayes empirical Bayes approach to predict

which sites have evolved under positive selection in the
foreground lineage. Likelihood ratio tests were done separately with human, pig and mouse as the predefined
foreground lineage. The LRT when contrasting the neutral
model with the branch-site model has two degrees of freedom. By using the human lineage as foreground lineage
we find 288 genes that show signals of positive selection
(dN/dS in the foreground lineage is larger than one). In
58 of those genes the branch-site model fits the data
significantly better than the neutral model at the 5% significance level. We find 34 and 15 genes at the 0.01 and
0.001 levels of significance respectively. The corresponding numbers of genes using pig as foreground lineage are
314, 55(0.05), 23(0.01) and 5(0.001). Using mouse as
foreground lineage results in 352, 67(0.05), 25(0.01) and

4(0.001). The genes found to be under positive selection
in any of the three species with a LRT significance level of
0.001 are shown in Table 6.
The molecular function of the genes predicted to be under
positive selection was determined using the Panther server
[28] and the NCBI server using the newest build of the
human genome. Both annotation servers are updated on
a regular basis when new information becomes available.
During the course of this study the annotation of several
genes changed. Of our 1120 alignments 188 are currently
not annotated as functional genes indicating that they
might possibly be pseudogenes in human; see the
Discussion for more details on this subject. The

positive selection in the human lineage at the 5% level of
significance can therefore be viewed as either 58/1120
~5.2% or 43/931 ~4.6%, indicating that possible pseudogenes are only slightly overrepresented in the genes predicted to have undergone adaptive evolution. The genes
predicted to have been under positive selection in the pig
and mouse lineage show a similar trend.
Several different models have been developed that allow
for heterogeneity of ω over sites in an alignment. We used
the M4 model [15] which allows each codon to fall into
one of 5 categories corresponding to ω equal to 0, 1/3, 2/
3, 1 and 3. The first category represents the fraction of
codons that have evolved under strong purifying selection

allowing no nonsynonymous changes to occur. The next
two categories represent different intensities of purifying
selection. The category with ω = 1 represents neutrally
evolving sites, while the last category with ω = 3 represents
codons that have evolved under positive selection. The
results of this analysis on the concatenated super gene can
be seen in Table 7. Only 1.6 % of all codons appear to
have evolved under positive selection, and approximately
69 % have been under strong functional constraints.
Codon usage bias
The concatenated super gene was also used to investigate
the patterns of codon usage in the three species; the results
of this investigation are summarized in Table 8. A test for

fits the data poorly, so does the equal frequency model
(Table 9). For a description of the codon equilibrium fre-

avoidance at the second and third codon position. Since
all changes in the second position of a codon are

expected to be lower than under the F3 × 4 model. The
extra parameter introduced improves the log likelihood
by approximately 1236 units (~44%). This can be
compared to the approximately 321 units per extra
parameter introduced when going from the F3 × 4 model
to the codon table model. When analysing the super gene
it is still better to use the actual codon frequencies, but
with individual genes the number of codons can
sometimes be so small that the use of actual codon counts
can be problematic. We also implemented a similar
model that incorporated the avoidance of CG in first and
second position by introducing an additional parameter
but this does not improve the fit of the model significantly
(results not shown). This is probably caused by the fact
that all four codons with CG in the first and second position code for the same amino acid, Arginine. Arginine has
six different codons and the two codons without a CG pair
(AGA and AGG) are generally favoured over the other four
(Table 8), but this tendency is apparently accounted for
when modelling nucleotide frequencies at the three
codon positions, so here we only present the model that

accounts for CpG avoidance at the second and third
codon position. Table 9 shows that the choice of codon
equilibrium frequency model has detectable effects on the
parameter estimates. Most striking is the apparent overestimation of the transition/transversion ratio and the dN/
dS ratio when the model is less parameter-rich.

Discussion
The phylogeny of the early mammalian radiation has
been extensively debated over the last two decades. The
classical view based on fossil evidence states that all major
orders of placental mammals first appear right after the
Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) boundary approximately 65
million years ago [29]. This sudden appearance of all
major placental orders is known as the mammalian radiation. With the use of molecular data this late radiation
has been challenged and it is now widely accepted that the
radiation of the placental orders probably occurred many
million years before the KT boundary [29-31]. Molecular
data have also been used to investigate the relative
branching orders of many of the larger clades of placental

mammals [1-7,9,30]. One of the issues that have been
debated extensively is the placement of Rodentia in the
placental tree. Some studies favour a basal placement of
the rodents [1,3-5,32,33] while other studies favour a sister relationship between primates and rodents [6-8].
Recently strong evidence based on insertions, deletions
and ancient transposable elements in favour of a sister
relationship of primates and rodents has been reported
[2,34].

The incongruence of single gene phylogenies was investigated in a recent study of eight yeast species [35]. The phylogeny commonly believed to be correct is completely
resolved when concatenating 20 or more randomly chosen genes to form a super gene. A concatenated multi gene
approach was also shown to resolve single gene incongruences in a recent study on green algae [36]. Here we use
988 full cDNA alignments comprising 672,918 nucleotides to investigate the branching order of the three
mammalian species. We present results based on both sin-

gle gene phylogenies and a concatenated super gene. All
genes including the concatenated super gene were analysed with both nucleotide and amino acid based substitution models. All methods favour a primate-artiodactyls
clade with rodents as an outgroup but with a relatively
short internal mammalian branch, indicating that the
mammalian radiation happened within a short period of
time. The different methods used in this study have very
different assumptions but they all show the same general
results. The HKY85 model takes into account differences
in nucleotide frequencies and transition/transversion
biases and allows for differences in substitution rates
among the lineages. However, it is still possible that complexities unaccounted for such as non-stationarity and

irreversibility of the substitution process have created
biases that lead to long-branch attraction of Fugu and
Mouse and an erroneous conclusion. Furthermore, the
incongruence between our analysis and many recent studies is also affected by the following. (1) The choice of
outgroup; bony fishes are believed to have diverged
approximately 450 million years ago [31], making saturation effects in synonymous sites a real problem. We are
therefore forced to only consider nonsynonymous sites or
amino acid replacements in the phylogenetic analyses.
The recently completed genome sequence of the chicken
(Gallus gallus) shows that the average value of dS between
human and chicken genes is approximately 1.66 [37],
which indicates that many genes may still be too distantly
Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2005, 3:2

related for synonymous sites to avoid problems with saturation. A marsupial species would provide a much better
outgroup when available [3,32]. (2) Taxon sampling; by
only using three species the variance of the parameter estimates can be quite high and the power to discriminate
between two conflicting topologies quite low. The
sequencing of more species will lessen this problem. (3)
Overly simplistic evolutionary models; here we use only
nucleotide and amino acid based models. If a more
closely related outgroup was available the use of more
complex codon based models could be beneficial in
resolving the apparent conflict. Several extensions have
been made to the codon models during the past few years.
One obvious extension to the codon models is a model
that incorporates CG avoidance within and over codon
boundaries. This will clearly improve the fit of the data to
the model and therefore give more accurate parameter
estimates. Including context dependencies over codon
boundaries and information about protein structure have
also been shown to increase the fit of the models to protein coding data and therefore should result in better
parameter estimates [38,39]. (4) Gene trees and species
trees can be different; the split between the three groups
probably occurred within a very short period of time,
allowing for the possibility that different genes actually
have different phylogenies due to ancient polymorphisms
at the time of the speciation. Using even larger number of
genes and a sufficiently sophisticated model should lessen
this problem [35,36].
The rate of synonymous substitution was estimated to be
almost three times higher in rodents than in other mammals, in agreement with previous investigations that also
showed an elevated rate in rodents [40-42]. This has historically often been explained by a generation time effect.
Species that have short generation times experience more
generations in the time span we consider and consequently they will experience more neutral substitutions
over time. The fact that the pig, which has a generation
time intermediate between mouse and humans, has an
intermediate rate of synonymous substitutions, seems to
agree with this theory. For a more thorough discussion of
the generation time hypothesis in mammals see [43]. The
nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that
the generation time effect should be smaller for non-synonymous substitutions [42,44,45]. The simple argument
is that animals with short generation times such as
rodents often have a very large effective population size.
In a population with a large effective population size
slightly deleterious mutations will be removed from the
gene pool more effectively than in a population with a
small effective population size, where genetic drift will
reduce the efficiency of natural selection. Figure 4g–h
shows the distribution of the dN/dS ratio in the three
lineages. The average dN/dS ratio is highest in humans

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/2

suggesting a small effective population size, while it is
smallest in mouse suggesting a larger effective population
size.
Previous studies of the occurrence of positive selection
based on pair wise comparisons have revealed a very low
occurrence of positive selection. In a study of 3595 alignments only 17 genes showed evidence of positive selection [46]. The branch specific models used here only find
one gene where the dN/dS ratio is significantly larger than
one. The gene reported is XM_165930. XM_165930 was
originally annotated as being similar to cold shock
domain protein A, but it has recently been removed from
Genbank as a result of standard genome annotation
processes.
Codon based branch-site models similar to the ones used
here were used in a paper based on a three way comparison among chimpanzees, humans and mice [23]. They
report that approximately 1.6 % of all the genes studied
have been undergoing positive selection in the lineage
leading to modern humans. Using a similar criterion our
study indicates that approximately 3.0 % of the genes
studied have been undergoing positive selection on the
lineage leading to humans; the corresponding numbers
for pig and mouse are 2.0 % and 2.2 % respectively. When
comparing these two studies it is important to consider
the following three things: (1) the relatively short average
length of the genes studied here decreases the power of the
models to detect positive selection; (2) the use of the new
BEB method for detecting positively selected sites should
reduce the number of false positives, making our estimates more conservative and more accurate; (3) our study
deals with a completely different phylogenetic level, covering a much longer time span than the study by Clark
and colleagues.
The multiple testing and the small number of taxa used in
a study like this imply that the results presented should
not be taken as conclusive evidence for positive selection,
but more as an approach to searching among the thousands of genes to look for genes that may have evolved in
a biologically interesting manner. Comparative
approaches such as the one we use here can only be a first
step towards showing that positive Darwinian selection
may be a key part in the evolution of many different gene
families. Further experimental and computational
analyses must then be used to investigate the suggested
candidates more thoroughly.
During the course of our investigation a large fraction of
the genes were re-annotated as putative pseudogenes:
188/1120 ~16.8%. However, all these genes have uninterrupted reading frames in all three species; only a tiny fraction of all codons seems to have evolved in a neutral-like

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2005, 3:2

fashion (ω~1), and the distributions of the synonymous
as well as the nonsynonymous rates of these putative
pseudogenes are almost identical to the distributions of
the remaining genes (results not shown). The only difference is a slight increase in the dN/dS ratio in the human
lineage, which is actually due to a few genes that experience an unusually high dN/dS ratio. Omitting these genes
from the analysis removes the observed differences completely. Thus, if all these genes are indeed pseudogenes in
human, the loss of function must have occurred quite
recently and they may not be pseudogenes in pig and
mouse.

Conclusions
The collection of a large set of pig cDNA sequences has
enabled us to study long term evolutionary trends in
mammalian genes. Our results indicate that the codon
models are able to detect evolutionary signals indicating
adaptive evolution in several genes. Our phylogenetic
investigation of the primate, rodent, artiodactyl split disagree with most recent findings in favouring a primate, artiodactyl clade with rodents as an outgroup. Our study
indicates that several genes that are not classified as genes
in the most recent human annotation might after all be
real genes; or at least they have become pseudogenes very
recently, and the orthologous genes in mouse and pig
might still be functional. This shows the potential of comparative methods in identifying functional regions of the
genome.

Complete cDNA from the domesticated pig Sus scrofa was
assembled at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences
(DIAS) from cDNA libraries from 100 different tissues
constructed at DIAS and the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in the following way. Total RNA was purified from selected tissues using Rneasy (Qiagen) or Tri
ReagentR and poly(A+) mRNA was selected using Oligotex (Qiagene) or PolyATract (Promega). Directional cloneable cDNA was synthezised from Poly(A+) mRNA
using the cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) and was ligated
into Eco RI/Xho I digested pTrueBlue (GenomicsOne) or
pBluescript (Stratagene) followed by electrotransformation into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF' (Stratagene). 5'-EST
sequencing was performed using standard protocols
(Applied Biosystem). The sequences were trimmed to the
longest open reading frame and the termination codons
were removed.

Homologues sequences from human, mouse and the Japanese pufferfish Fugu rubrices were obtained with the
blastall program with default parameters; the E-score was
set to 10-8. We constructed two different datasets, one with
and one without Fugu rubrices. Individual alignments were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/2

made using ClustalW version 1.83 with default parameters [47]. We kept the pig reading frame intact in the
alignments by removing any columns where the alignment gave rise to gaps in the pig sequence. Alignments
that resulted in premature stop codons, or were shorter
than 30 codons, were removed. We used the one ratio
model to estimate the total branch length of the tree as
well as the synonymous branch lengths. These distributions were used to detect peculiar genes where one or
more sequences might not be a true orthologue, and all
outliers were thereafter removed from the dataset. This
analysis gave 1120 alignments of mouse, human and pig,
and of these 988 also included Fugu. The 1120 original
cDNAs from Sus scrofa have been deposited in Genbank
with the following accession numbers: AY609387AY610506.
Phylogeny and rates of evolution
Nine hundred and eighty-eight four-species alignments
were concatenated into a super gene. The three topologies
were compared using the super gene as well as each individual gene. Both nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and amino acid substitutions were investigated with
PAML v. 3.14 [48]. The nonsynonymous substitutions
were represented by the first and second codon positions
of all codons, and the three different topologies were
investigated with baseml using the HKY85[27] model
(model = 4) of nucleotide substitutions. The likelihood
was then maximized under the three different topologies
using all the individual genes as well the concatenated
super gene. The codeml program with the codons translated to amino acids (seqtype = 3) were also used to investigate the three topologies. We used different models of
amino acid evolution to maximize the likelihood under
the three topologies and since the results were highly similar we only present the results from the empirical method
of Whelan and Goldman (model = 2, aaratefile =
wag.dat)[26].

Using the 1120 three species alignments, the synonymous
and nonsynonymous rates of evolution were estimated
with the codeml program (seqtype = 1) using the free ratio
model (model = 2) with the transition/transversion ratio
estimated from the data (fix_kappa = 0).
Investigation of selection
The different tests for positive Darwinian selection are all
based on extensions of the basic codon based likelihood
model [11]. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to
compare nested models where one allows for positive
selection and the other does not. The probability that a
codon i substitutes into another codon j during the time
interval t is determined by the rate matrix Q = (qij) with
entries

for synonymous transversion
for synonymous transition
i
for nonsynonymous transversion
for nonsynonymous transition
if codon i and j differ at more than one position

for i ≠ j, with corresponding substitution probability
matrix given by exp(Qt). Here πj is the equilibrium codon
frequency of codon j, κ is the transition/transversion ratio
and ω is the dN/dS ratio. All parameters are estimated
independently for each gene. The star topology of the
three species is used to estimate the branch lengths (τhuman, τpig, τmouse) for synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions.
Positive selection was tested in two different ways. Test 1
averages over sites but differentiates among lineages. The
LRT compares the free ratio model where all three lineages
have a different value of ω estimated from the data with
the one ratio model where all three lineages share a common value of ω [14]. We note that this test is more a test
of variable dN/dS ratios among lineages than a test for
positive selection. The free ratio model has three parameters for ω and the one ratio model only one. The LRT statistic is calculated as 2 times the differences in maximum
log likelihood and is asymptotically distributed as a χ2 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The genes found in
one or more lineages evolving with a dN/dS ratio > 1 are
compared to a nested model where the dN/dS ratio is
fixed at 1 in the lineages shown to have a dN/dS ratio
larger than one to see whether the result can be attributed
to natural selection or just relaxation of selective
pressures.
Test 2 is based on a new and improved version of the
branch-site method presented in [23]. We will refer to this
model as model A. The LRT is based on a comparison of
the neutral model and model A. The neutral model
assumes two categories of sites, a proportion p1 of sites
where ω1 are estimated from the data and is forced to lie
between 0 and 1, and a proportion p2 of neutrally evolving sites where ω1 = 1 (p1 + p2 = 1). Model A furthermore
allows a pre-specified branch to have a proportion of sites
that evolve with a different value of ω estimated from the
data. This value cannot be smaller than 1. The LRT follows
a χ2 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. If the value of
ω in the foreground lineage is estimated to be equal to one
the model collapses to the neutral model.
PAML v. 3.14 [48] was used to estimate likelihood and
parameters under each model. Codon equilibrium frequencies can be estimated from data using either simple
proportions in the full data set (the CT model with 60

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/2

parameters), assuming equal frequencies (Fequal model),
multiplying overall counts of nucleotide frequencies (F1 ×
4 model, 3 parameters) or counts of nucleotide frequencies for each codon position (F3 × 4 model, 9 parameters).
The codon table (CT) was used for analysis of the concatenated super gene and the F3 × 4 model was used on the
individual genes.
CpG Extension of the codon models
A simple extension of the F3 × 4 codon equilibrium frequency model can incorporate CpG avoidance by adding
an extra parameter that penalizes a C followed by a G in
the second and third codon position. The new model is
parameterised as follows

πi1i2i3

if stop codon ( TGA, TAG, TAA )
if i2 = C and i3 = G
otherwise

Here πi11 represents the frequency of nucleotide i1, at
codon position 1, and ψ(0 < ψ < 1) is a CpG penalizing
parameter. The scaling factor cψ ensures that the codon frequencies sum to one.
