Abstract
Background: The Cronobacter genus (Enterobacter sakazakii) has come to prominence due to its
association with infant infections, and the ingestion of contaminated reconstituted infant formula.
C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus are closely related, and are defined according their biotype. Due to
the ubiquitous nature of the organism, and the high severity of infection for the
immunocompromised, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme has been developed for the
fast and reliable identification and discrimination of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus strains. It was
applied to 60 strains of C. sakazakii and 16 strains of C. malonaticus, including the index strains used
to define the biotypes. The strains were from clinical and non-clinical sources between 1951 and
2008 in USA, Canada, Europe, New Zealand and the Far East.
Results: This scheme uses 7 loci; atpD, fusA, glnS, gltB, gyrB, infB, and pps. There were 12 sequence
types (ST) identified in C. sakazakii, and 3 in C. malonaticus. A third (22/60) of C. sakazakii strains
were in ST4, which had almost equal numbers of clinical and infant formula isolates from 1951 to
2008. ST8 may represent a particularly virulent grouping of C. sakazakii as 7/8 strains were clinical
in origin which had been isolated between 1977 - 2006, from four countries. C. malonaticus divided
into three STs. The previous Cronobacter biotyping scheme did not clearly correspond with STs nor
with species.
Conclusion: In conclusion, MLST is a more robust means of identifying and discriminating
between C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus than biotyping. The MLST database for these organisms is
available online at http://pubmlst.org/cronobacter/.

Background
The genus Cronobacter is composed of Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods, which are members of the Entero-

bacteriaceae Family. It was formerly known as Enterobacter
sakazakii and was divided into 15 biotypes [1]. The biotyping scheme was based on Voges-Proskauer, methyl red,

indole, ornithine decarboxylase, motility, reduction of
nitrate to nitrite, production of gas from D-glucose,
malonate utilization and production of acid from myoinositol and dulcitol. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, we extended this further to 16 biotypes [2,3] which
has contributed to the recent taxonomic revisions. Initially the Cronobacter genus was composed of 4 species; C.
sakazakii, C. turicensis, C. muytjensii, C. dublinensis, plus a
possible fifth species [4]. More recently, the species C.
malonaticus sp. nov. was proposed [5]. This was initially
regarded as a subspecies of C. sakazakii as the two species
could not be distinguished according to 16S rDNA
sequence analysis however DNA-DNA hybridisation studies revealed a <70% DNA relatedness. Consequently C.
sakazakii consists of biotypes 1-4, 7 & 8, 11 & 13, and C.
malonaticus contains biotypes 5, 9 and 14 [5].
Cronobacter spp. have come to prominence due to their
association with infant infections, and cases linked to the
ingestion of contaminated reconstituted infant formula
[6-8]. However not all cases have been linked to formula
ingestion. The organism is ubiquitous in the environment
(water and soil) and food [9,10].
Cronobacter spp. cause infections across all age groups
[11]. However neonates, particularly those of low-birth
weight, are the major identified group at risk with a high
mortality rate [6,11]. The organism is a rare cause of neonatal meningitis, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis. A number of outbreaks of C. sakazakii have been
reported in neonatal intensive care units around the world
[12-16]. The International Commission for Microbiological Specifications for Foods (2002) [17] has ranked Cronobacter spp. as 'severe hazard for restricted populations,
life-threatening or substantial chronic sequelae or long
duration'. The FAO/WHO [6,7,11] have undertaken three
risk assessments of the organism in powdered infant formula, and the WHO [18] have published recommended
procedures for the reconstitution of powdered infant formula to reduce the risk of infection to neonates. Together
with the ubiquitous nature of the organism, and the high
severity of infection for the immunocompromised, there
is a need for a technique that enables fast and reliable classification and identification of Cronobacter strains worldwide.
Selected strains of Cronobacter spp. have been shown to
invade human intestinal cells, replicate in macrophages,
and invade the blood brain barrier [19,20]. Based on the
clinical outcome of different pulsetypes during a neonatal
intensive care unit outbreak it was proposed that certain
types of C. sakazakii are particularly virulent [16,20].
Whether the virulence was linked to a particular genotype
or phenotype warranted further investigation.

16S rDNA sequences can be useful to determine phylogenies between distantly related Enterobacteriaeceae [21].
However it is less discriminatory and unclear for more
closely related organisms. An alternative to rDNA
sequence analysis is the partial sequencing of proteinencoding genes. Additionally, for determining phylogenetic relationships, sequence data from more than one
gene should be used to reduce the possibly of ambiguities
caused by genetic recombination or specific selection
[21,22]. A number of such genes have been used as phylogenetic markers for members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
Genes which have been analysed include rpoB, gyrB, mdh,
infB and recA [23,24]. These results can be more reliable
for species identification and determining intra- and intergeneric relationships than 16S rDNA gene sequencing.
Recently, Kuhnert et al. [25] used three loci (recN, rpoA
and thdF) for 30 species of Enterobacteriaceae including
Cronobacter spp. Whereas our work is focussed on a higher
resolution analysis of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus using
7 loci. The genes under study were atpD, fusA, glnS, gltB,
gyrB, infB, and pps. These genes encode for ATP synthase B
subunit, elongation factor EF-2, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamate synthase large subunit, type IIA topoisomerase, initiation translation factor 2 and phosphoenol
pyruvate synthase, respectively. These were compared
with the previous biotyping scheme for Cronobacter spp.
and also considered the source and isolation date of the
strains.

Results
Development of the Cronobacter MLST scheme
Several criteria were used in the selection of all potential
loci. Genes included were those encoding for putative
housekeeping products necessary for biological roles in
DNA repair, replication and amino acid biosynthesis.
Genes that were either a) located near to or b) implicated
as being, putative virulence factors and mobile elements
were avoided as these may come under greater selective
evolutionary pressures than other genes. The selected loci
were distributed as much as possible across the chromosome to ensure that each locus was genetically unlinked.
Each gene fragment was also required to be approximately
500 bp in length to facilitate the design of universal nested
primers for each locus preferably in conserved flanking
regions around a variable central core. Using these criteria,
genes were selected and the chromosomal locations of all
these loci were confirmed by bioinformatic analysis of the
C. sakazakii BAA-894 genome sequence (Genbank accession number CP000785).

The genes selected for the MLST scheme (atpD, fusA, glnS,
gltB, gyrB, infB and pps) are shown in Table 1 along with
putative gene products, gene sizes, primers and location
within the C. sakazakii ATCC BAA-894 genome.

Allelic variation
Novel sequence information for all seven loci was
obtained from a collection of 60 C. sakazakii and 16 C.
malonaticus strains. To assess the performance of the MLST
scheme, Cronobacter strains were selected to be representative of the different biotypes (most of which were previously derived in an earlier study [3]), and were also
distributed both temporally and geographically in terms
of their isolation (See Additional file 1). In silico sequence

data was also obtained for all the loci from C. sakazakii
strain ATCC BAA-894 (Accession No. CP000785), Citrobacter koseri strain ATCC BAA-895 (Accession No.
CP000822), and Enterobacter species strain 683 (Accession No. CP000653). The latter strain sequence data was
used to root the data set. The seven alleles obtained for the
C. sakazakii genome reference strain BAA-894 were identical to the online genome sequence (CP000785).

The mean allele length was 434 bp for the scheme and
ranged between 363 bp (glnS) and 507 bp (gltB) in length
(Table 2). All alleles within a particular locus were found
to be of an identical length for all Cronobacter strains
examined. Nucleotide sequence diversity at all seven loci
is shown in Table 2. The proportion of variable sites varied from 10.8% (atpD) to 27.6% (gyrB) which extended
over the whole section of the sequenced allele.

A total of 17 STs were found for the 78 strains examined
(See Additional file 1); 12 STs for for C. sakazakii (n = 60),
3 C. malonaticus (n = 16), 1 Cit. koseri (n = 1) and 1 Enterobacter sp. 638 (n = 1). The sequences of each allele type at
all seven loci, along with the allelic profiles and sequence
types used for the multilocus sequence sequence analysis
(MLSA) of the Cronobacter strains examined are available
at http://pubmlst.org/cronobacter/.

Allele variation is not necessarily equally likely at every
nucleotide of each locus. If a locus does not have a role
affected by a selective pressure (such as antibiotic exposure) then nucleotide substitutions would frequently not
be expected to change the amino acid sequence (synonymous) as changes are likely to be eliminated by purifying
selection. By calculating the dN/dS ratio (non-synonymous
substitutions to synonymous substitutions) the degree of
selection operating on each locus can be estimated. The
dN/dS ratio for all seven loci within Cronobacter strains was
found to be significantly less than 1, ranging from 0.006
(atpD) to 0.079 (infB) (Table 2), indicating that no strong
positive selective pressure was present at any of the loci
selected, validating their suitability for inclusion in the
MLST scheme.

The close genetic relationship between C. sakazakii and C.
malonaticus was evident in that atpD allele 3 was identified
both in C. sakazakii (ST3, ST17) and C. malonaticus
(ST10). Apparently 'species specific' alleles were found
across different STs e.g. the GlnS allele 3 was identified in
C. sakazakii ST 3, 4,15 and 16, fusA allele 1 was in C. sakazakii ST1, 4, and 14, and three C. malonaticus STs had fusA
allelic profile 7, and ST7 and ST10 had gltB allelic profile
7.

Assignment of allele and sequence types
The number of different alleles resolved from this Cronobacter MLST scheme at each locus ranged from 11 (gltB) to
15 (pps) alleles. The mean number of allele types per locus
was found to be 13.4, providing the potential to distinguish >7 × 1010 different genotypes and also making it
highly unlikely to obtain identical sequence types (ST) by
chance.

For the development of the MLST scheme, it was important to use a diverse collection of strains to obtain primarily different STs based upon known 16S rRNA gene
sequencing and biotype to validate the scheme's effectiveness across the two Cronobacter species. For each unique
allelic profile in the order atpD, fusA, glnS, gltB, gyrB, infB
and pps, a unique ST was designated; See Additional file 1.

Comparison of sequence type with source and biotype
In total 60 C. sakazakii and 16 C. malonaticus strains were
analysed. Most strains analysed were associated with previous publications (See Additional file 1). The earliest isolate (NCIMB 8272) was from a can of dried milk powder,
which was deposited in the culture collection in 1951,
and the earliest clinical isolate (NCTC 9238) was deposited in 1953 [1].

C. sakazakii ST1 contained infant formula isolates from
1988-2003 from Russia, Netherlands, USA and UK. It
included the ATCC BAA-894 strain from the Tennesse
NICU outbreak [13] which has been sequenced (Accession number CP000785). Two strains were from milk
powder and faeces. There were no known clinical outbreak isolates in ST1. C. sakazakii ST14 was a single strain
from infant formula in France (1994) [16]. This ST varied
by just a single nucleotide polymorphism from ST1 with
respect to the pps locus. C. sakazakii ST3 strains were from
infant formula, follow up formula, weaning food, and
neonatal enteral feeding tubes. The strains were from
1988-2008, and were isolated in the Netherlands, UK, and
Korea. There were no known clinical isolates, however

bacter koseri at 13% divergence. Figure 1 also shows the
distribution of biotypes across the sequence types.

C. sakazakii ST4 was the major (22/60) sequence type
among the isolates. It contained almost equal numbers of
clinical (n = 9) and infant formula (n = 7) isolates. This ST
also included the Betty Hobbs 1951 isolate from a can of
dried milk (NCIMB 8272) [1]. In contrast, strains in C.
sakazakii ST8 were predominantly (7/8) clinical isolates
from USA, Canada, and Czech Republic. The isolation
dates ranged from 1977-2003, and included the C. sakazakii type strain (NCTC 11467T). The remaining strain was
isolated in 2006 from infant formula in France. C. sakazakii ST12 included 5 strains from UK, USA, France and
Czech Republic, at least 3 of which were clinical in origin.

Analysis of recombination among C. sakazakii
Bacteria existing as clonal populations evolve diversity by
the accumulation of point mutations, while non-clonal
populations evolve more through recombination within
or between species. In this study identical alleles were
found within species and between the two Cronobacter
species (See Additional file 1).

C. malonaticus ST7 contained 11 strains which were primarily clinical in origin from the Czech Republic, isolated
between 1977 and 2004. C. malonaticus ST11 contained 3
clinical strains from the Czech Republic, biotypes 2a, 14a,
and 13b which were isolated in 1983 [30]. C. malonaticus
ST10 was composed of two strains from chinese herbs
which were both isolated in 2005.
Biotypes did not always correspond with sequence types
or Cronobacter species (See Additional file 1). For example,
biotype 2 was primarily distributed over C. sakazakii ST1
and 3, with two other strains in ST4. The index strain for
biotype 2a was in C. malonaticus ST11, and a second strain
was in C. sakazakii ST12. Biotype 1 was in C. sakazakii ST4,
8,13,15,17 and 18. C. malonaticus is defined as biotypes 5,
9 and 14 [5]. However biotype 5 was in C. malonaticus ST7
and 10, and C. sakazakii ST16. Biotype 9 was only in C.
malonaticus ST7. Whereas biotype 14 and 14a were in C.
malonaticus ST7, and ST11. Biotypes 2a, 4a, 13a, and 13b
are conventionally assigned to C. sakazakii [3]. However,
C. malonaticus ST7 included the index strains for biotypes
4a and 13a, and C. malonaticus ST11 included the index
strains for biotypes 2a and 13b.
Relationships of C. sakazakii, C. malonaticus, Cit. koseri
and Enterobacter sp. 638 using concatenated nucleotide
sequences
In order to assess all the loci together in one tree, concatenated nucleotide sequences were used. Concatenated
nucleotide sequences (3,036 bp) for the 15 Cronobacter
STs, Cit. koseri and Enterobacter sp. 638 were analysed
using the UPGMA method (Figure 1). The Cronobacter species were fully resolved, falling into distinctive clusters of
strains. The Cronobacter species were clearly separated
from the Enterobacter sp. strain 638 and also by a lesser
extent from the Cit. koseri strain (100% bootstraps). C.
sakazakii and C. malonaticus separated from each other at
2.6% divergence (100% bootstrap value), and from Citro-

Evidence for clonal or recombining populations can be
estimated by assessing the level of linkage between alleles
at different loci around the chromosome. The index of
association (IA) [34] measures the extent of linkage. An IA
not significantly greater than zero after 1,000 computer
randomizations would suggest that a single species population (monophyletic) is in linkage equilibrium (freely
recombining), while a population with an IA significantly
greater than zero (p < 0.001) is considered to be in linkage
disequilibrium (clonal). C. sakazakii examined had an IA
value of 0.28 (p value < 0.01) and therefore indicates a
more clonal that freely recombining population. Further
analysis will be undertaken as part of a subsequent study,
along with other Cronobacter spp..

Discussion and Conclusion
The diversity of Enterobacter sakazakii was well acknowledged prior to the taxonomic revision to the Cronobacter
genus, which was based on DNA-DNA hybridisation, 16S
rDNA sequence analysis, and biotyping [5]. The earlier
biotyping scheme was extremely useful in aiding the definition of the various Cronobacter species, especially due to
the close genetic relationship of C. sakazakii and C.
malonaticus which initially was regarded as a subspecies of
C. sakazakii [4].
Nevertheless, phenotyping is in part subjective, and a
DNA based scheme is preferred for its robustness. This
study has used 7 loci for a MLST scheme for C. sakazakii
and C. malonaticus. Strains were chosen to represent the
diversity of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus based on biotype, geographic and temporal distribution, and source
(environmental, formula, clinical). The strains were from
Europe, USA, Canada, Russia, New Zealand, Korea and
China. The isolation dates ranged over 57 years from 1951
to 2008.
As MLST uses multiple loci, a greater degree of variation
and better resolution for MLSA and for inferring evolutionary and epidemiological relatedness can be obtained
than by a single locus alone. Twelve sequence types of C.
sakazakii were assigned. ST4 contained the largest number
of strains, both clinical, infant formula, and milk powder
isolates, from USA, Canada, Europe and Russia. The earli-

est isolate dates from 1951 and demonstrates the ubiquity
of this sequence type. Many (18/22) of these strains were
biotype 1, which was previously shown to be the most
numerous biotype (60/189) [3].
Previously Caubilla-Barron et al. [16] and Townsend et al.
[20] reported on C. sakazakii infections in neonatal intensive care unit outbreak, which involved 4 pulsetypes. Only
one pulsetype (PT2) was associated with all the deaths
and therefore indicated that C. sakazakii strains may vary
in their virulence potential. PT2 strains caused necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC), septicaemia, and meningitis. These
strains were all in ST4. Other strains, associated with nonfatal NEC, neonatal colonisation, and infant formulas
were in ST12, 13 and 14.
ST8 is of particular interest as 7/8 strains were clinical in
origin, the eighth isolate being isolated from infant formula. These organisms isolated between 1977 and 2006
were from USA, Canada, France and the Czech Republic.
ST8 also contains the C. sakazakii type strain (NCTC
11467T, equivalent ATCC 29544T) and interestingly the
index strains for biotypes 1, 3 and 4. Some of these strains
have previously been studied by Pagotto et al. [33] and
Postupa and Aldov [35]. ST(8) therefore merits further
investigation, as it may represent a particularly virulent
type of C. sakazakii strains.
Similarly ST7 in C. malonaticus was dominated (8/11) by
clinical isolates, however this grouping may be biased as
5 clinical isolates (510, 515, 521, 522, 524) were epidemiologically linked. There is also a predominance of biotype
9 in this sequence type, which may in part explain why
that biotype was previously associated with clinical
source; 10/13 strains [3].
The MLST scheme is openly available on the internet for
other workers and will assist in the identification and discrimination of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus based on
DNA sequence in place of the far less reliable biotyping
approach, which in isolation is essentially of no phylogenetic value and little epidemiological value. The role of
biotyping in the identification and discrimination of C.
sakazakii and C. malonaticus needs to be seriously
reviewed. Even within the sample of isolates examined
MLSA has already identified 1 or 2 STs which appear to be
associated with enhanced virulence, and this may aid our
understanding of the pathogenicity of this ubiquitous
organism.

Methods
Source of strains and biotyping
Strains were chosen on the basis of their species, biotype,
geographic and temporal distribution, source and clinical
outcome (See Additional file 1). This included the type

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/223

strains C. sakazakii NCTC 11467T, and C. malonaticus CDC
1058-77T, biotype index strains, infant formula and clinical isolates, from Europe, USA, Canada, Russia, New Zealand, Korea and China, ranging from 1951 to 2008. The
majority of these have associated published articles (See
Additional file 1). Biotyping was as according to Iversen et
al. [3].
DNA isolation and PCR
Genomic DNA was prepared using GenElute™ Bacterial
Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma) and 1.5 ml of overnight culture grown in TSB broth as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Selection of MLST gene loci
MLST loci were selected by comparing genome sequence
data for C. sakazakii (strain ATCC BAA-894; http://
genome.wustl.edu), Cit. koseri (strain ATCC BAA-895;
http://genome.wustl.edu) and Enterobacter sp. strain 638
http://www.jgi.doe.gov/ using the Artemis Comparison
Tool (ACT) and the Double ACT program available at
and
http://
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/ACT/
www.hpa-bioinfotools.org.uk/pise/double_act.html,
respectively.
Primer design
Amplification and nested sequencing primers for the
MLST loci were then designed to conserved areas of these
genes using Primer3 available at http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/
[36].

For each locus, primers were designed to have a similar
melting temperature and were found to successfully
amplify by PCR a panel of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus
strains (Table 1 and Additional file 1). Reaction conditions for all the primers were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 1 min, primer annealing at 58°C for 1 min, extension
at 72°C for 2 min; followed by a final extension step of
72°C for 5 min. Each 50 l amplification reaction mixture
comprised ~10 ng chromosomal DNA, 10 l Q solution
(Qiagen, Crawley, UK), 20 pmol forward and reverse
primer, 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen) containing 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.8 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates and 1.25
U Taq (Qiagen). The amplification product was then purified using MinElute UF plates (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer's protocol before being used in a sequencing reaction.
Multilocus sequence analysis
Using the nested sequencing primers, nucleotide
sequences were determined at least once on each DNA
strand with BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction Mix v3.1
(PE Biosystems, Foster City, US) under standard sequencing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Unincorporated dye terminators were removed by precipitation with 95% alcohol. The reaction products were separated and detected on an ABI PRISM genetic analyser
3100 (PE Biosystems) using a standard sequencing module with a Performance Optimised Polymer and 5 cm
array. The sequences from both strands of a given locus of
the same isolate were aligned, trimmed to the desired
length and edited using SeqMan II (DNA Star software,
Madison, US).
Allele and Sequence Type designation
Arbitrary allelic numbers were assigned to each unique
allele for a given locus. After sequencing and assigning
allele types to all seven loci each isolate was then designated by a combination of seven numbers called an allelic
profile that represented a sequence type (ST) for that particular isolate (eg. ST1). A novel sequence type (ST) designation was given to each isolate with a unique allelic
profile while subsequent isolates with an identical allelic
profile were assigned the same ST identifier and considered to be isogenic strains as they were indistinguishable
at all seven loci. All alleles within the MLST scheme were
in frame, to aid with analysis.
Linkage analysis
Linkage analysis was carried out by using the index of
association (IA), as defined previously [37]. We examined
whether alleles were randomly associated, that is, at linkage equilibrium, indicating a freely recombining population, or non-randomly associated, that is, at linkage
disequilibrium, implying a clonal population structure. If
there is linkage equilibrium, i.e., a random association
between alleles of different loci, IA = 0. If IA is significantly
different from 0, it indicates that recombination has been
rare or absent and that the population has a clonal structure [34].
