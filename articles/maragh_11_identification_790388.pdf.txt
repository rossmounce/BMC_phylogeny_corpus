Abstract
Background: We recently identified Rbm24 as a novel gene expressed during mouse cardiac development. Due to
its tightly restricted and persistent expression from formation of the cardiac crescent onwards and later in forming
vasculature we posited it to be a key player in cardiogenesis with additional roles in vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis.
Results: To determine the role of this gene in cardiac development, we have identified its zebrafish orthologs
(rbm24a and rbm24b), and functionally evaluated them during zebrafish embryogenesis. Consistent with our
underlying hypothesis, reduction in expression of either ortholog through injection of morpholino antisense
oligonucleotides results in cardiogenic defects including cardiac looping and reduced circulation, leading to
increasing pericardial edema over time. Additionally, morphant embryos for either ortholog display incompletely
overlapping defects in the forming vasculature of the dorsal aorta (DA), posterior caudal vein (PCV) and caudal vein
(CV) which are the first blood vessels to form in the embryo. Vasculogenesis and early angiogenesis in the trunk
were similarly compromised in rbm24 morphant embryos at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf). Subsequent vascular
maintenance was impaired in both rbm24 morphants with substantial vessel degradation noted at 72 hpf.
Conclusion: Taken collectively, our functional data support the hypothesis that rbm24a and rbm24b are key
developmental cardiac genes with unequal roles in cardiovascular formation.

Background
During vertebrate embryogenesis the heart is the first
organ to develop and achieve functionality. Model
organism studies have uncovered a number of genes
such as Nkx2.5, which have important functions in early
vertebrate myocardial development and differentiation
[1,2]. Despite an increasing body of data illuminating
the roles played by several key genes during cardiac
development, there is still much to learn about what
other factors may be critical. The general stages of cardiac development are invariable throughout vertebrate
model organisms where heart development has been
examined, with zebrafish progressing through these
stages at a particularly rapid rate [3]. During zebrafish
cardiogenesis the heart cone is the first structure to

form between 19-20 hpf, followed by the formation of a
short cardiac tube lacking discrete chambers by 24 hpf.
Subsequently the cardiac tube lengthens and distinct
ventricle and atrium chambers are discernable by 30 hpf
with heart tube looping occurring around 36 hpf. A
functional two chambered zebrafish heart is visible by
48 hpf [4].
In a recent transcriptional profiling study, we compared the signatures of mouse embryonic stem cells as
they were differentiated towards cardiac cell fates in an
effort to uncover novel critical cardiac genes. In this
initial study we described the cardiac developmental
expression of 31 identified candidate genes with previously unknown roles in cardiogenesis. Furthermore,
nine of these transcripts were expressed in the forming
cardiac crescent of the mouse embryo [5], consistent
with roles in the earliest stages of heart development.
Based on the early cardiac expression of these genes we

predicted they likely play significant roles in heart
development.
In this paper we report functional evaluation of one of
these genes, Rbm24, through the identification, characterization and knockdown of its zebrafish (Danio rerio)
orthologs. Rbm24 is a member of the RNA binding protein family, based upon the identification of a RNA
recognition motif (RRM) in amino acid residues 12-84.
RRMs are the most common and best characterized
RNA binding modules with many functioning in most
post-transcriptional processes [6]. The RRM is composed of four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets with two
helices packed against it such that the domain has the
split ab (babbab) topology [7]. Often, RRMs function
in concert to increase binding specificity possibly
because the number of nucleotides recognized by a single RRM is generally too small to define a unique binding sequence [8]. RRMs are found in a variety of RNA
binding proteins, including several hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and
protein components of snRNPs indicating a diverse role
of these motifs in cellular development and function.
As we have shown previously, the mouse Rbm24 transcript is upregulated in the cardiac progenitor population and is expressed from the earliest stages of cardiac
specification, in the cardiac crescent, and subsequently
within the heart tube and looping heart [5]. Based upon
these observations we hypothesized that Rbm24 plays a
crucial role in cardiogenesis. In this study we investigated the putative role of Rbm24 in cardiac development. We have identified two rbm24 zebrafish orthologs
(termed rbm24a and rbm24b), and demonstrate that
their spatial expression is consistent with our observations in mice. We use rbm24a and rbm24b translation
blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) in
the early embryo and demonstrate that each zebrafish
rbm24 ortholog has a key but unequal role to play in
cardiac development. Additionally, we demonstrate a
role for rbm24a and rbm24b in normal vascular development. Vascular development consists of vasculogenesis which is the de novo formation of the first vascular
vessels and subsequently angiogenesis which is the formation of additional vasculature as extensions of existing vasculature. Zebrafish vasculogenesis results in the
formation of the main trunk vessels with the DA first to
form (24 - 26 hpf) followed by the CV and PCV (28 30 hpf) and several heart vessels generating the first single circulation loop. Angiogenesis can be observed in
the trunk by 24 hpf as intersegmetal vessels (Se) begin
to form as paired dorsally extending branches off the
DA and subsequently off the PCV (~32 hpf). As the Se
reach the dorsal line of the embryo the ends of the vessels form connections resulting in two dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAVs) running along the

Page 2 of 13

anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the embryo at the dorsal
line. By 48 hpf these trunk vessels are fully formed with
circulation [9,10]. Our findings show the requirement
for rbm24a and rbm24b in cardiac development and
vasculogenesis with a more pronounced role for
rbm24a, and an additional putative role for rbm24a in
angiogenesis.

Results
Phylogenetic comparative analysis establishes two rbm24
orthologs in zebrafish

We recently reported the identification of Rbm24 as one of
a number of novel transcripts discretely expressed in the
earliest stages of cardiac development in the mouse embryo
[5]. To facilitate determination of the biological requirement for this gene during vertebrate embryonic development, we first set out to identify the orthologous gene/s in
zebrafish. In the transition between assembly Zv8 and Zv9
of the zebrafish genome, first one and then a second putative rbm24 ortholog was identified. The current assembly
(Zv9) identifies a protein coding gene as rbm24a residing
on chromosome 19 and also a novel annotation of a putative rbm24b protein coding gene residing on chromosome
16. To confirm the validity of these most recent changes to
the genome annotation we compared these findings to our
own comparative genomic analyses.
The first annotated rbm24a gene encodes a protein
that displays strong similarity to the mouse Rbm24 (Evalue = 3e-90; 188/237 (79%) amino acids). Using the
mouse Rbm24 as a blastp query to search the NCBI
RefSeq database of D. rerio proteins we detected strong
similarity (E-value = 5e-61; 103/116 (88%)) to a
hypothetical protein LOC562236 encoded by a gene
(zgc:136803) on chromosome 16 (Zv8). This protein is
now termed rbm24b in Zv9. The identification of these
genes as rbm24 orthologs is further supported by the
identification of a pair of annotated rbm24 paralogs in
both the medaka (Oryzias latipes; chr. 11, 16) and pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis; chr. 21 and 8) genomes.
Zebrafish chromosome 19, where rbm24a resides, shares
a common evolutionary origin with O. latipes chromosome 11 and T. nigroviridis chromosome 21 [11]. Similarly, chromosomes 16 and 8 in O. latipes and T.
nigroviridis, respectively, map to the rbm24b region of
chromosome 16 in D. rerio.
rbm24a and rbm24b display cardiovascular expression
during embryogenesis

The spatial and temporal expression of both rbm24
orthologs was determined using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) (Figure 1). Both rbm24 orthologs show cardiac expression early in development. At 15.5 hpf we
detected rbm24a but not rbm24b expression in myocardial precursor cells (Figure 1B and 1C). By 24 hpf both

posterior caudal vein; IV, intestinal vasculature.

rbm24a and rbm24b expression was detected in the
forming heart (Figure 1E and 1F). Expression of rbm24a
was also detected in the lens of the eye. By 48 hpf, and
continuing through 72 hpf, rbm24a and rbm24b exhibit
broad expression throughout the heart, although expression of rbm24a was higher in the atrium than the ventricle. By contrast expression of rbm24b appeared
uniformly expressed in both heart chambers (Figure 1I
and 1L). These data are consistent with cardiac expression of the mouse Rbm24 ortholog, and suggest incompletely overlapping requirements for rbm24a and
rbm24b during zebrafish cardiac development.
By 72 hpf both rbm24a and rbm24b show incompletely overlapping vascular expression in addition to cardiac expression. rbm24a is expressed in the DA and
intestinal vasculature (IV) while rbm24b is expressed in
the PCV as well as the IV (Figure 1N and 1O). The
early expression of both rbm24a and rbm24b in both
the heart and vasculature suggests potentially important
roles in cardiogenesis and vasculogenesis.
rbm24a and rbm24b are required for normal cardiac
development

To determine the functional role of the rbm24 orthologs
in cardiac and vascular development, translation blocking
morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) were
designed against the 5â UTR of each transcript. The effects
of gene knockdown was assessed for each ortholog individually post microinjection of either MO into zebrafish
embryos at the 1-2 cell stage. Titration experiments were
conducted to determine MO quantities sufficient to
induce a consistent phenotype in a majority of embryos
injected (Additional File 1). Injection of 5 ng of rbm24a
MO or 8 ng rbm24b MO resulted in a robust cardiac phenotype for a significant number of injected embryos at 48
hpf (64/67 and 59/62 respectively) (Table 1), compared to
uninjected embryos (Figure 2A, B and 2D). During cardiogenesis the heart tubes of all affected morphant embryos
failed to correctly loop, remaining linear but with distinct
ventricular and atrial chambers (Figure 2). Affected
embryos also exhibited reduced blood circulation, which
led to cardiac edema in all cases by 48 hpf and continually
worsened as development progressed (Additional File 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). A subset of rbm24a MO treated
embryos (6/64) displayed an even more severe phenotype,
lacking a distinct heart tube and exhibiting a beating focus

of periodically contracting cells. This poorly organized cardiac structure was located ventral to the embryo between
the embryo and the yolk suggesting a defect in the migration and organization of the cardiac fated cells. Similarly
reduction of rbm24a or rbm24b expression using splice
blocking morpholinos, designed against the second intron/
exon boundary, also resulted in cardiac looping defects
and cardiac edema in a majority of embryos (92.7% and
54.4% respectively) (Additional File 11). Knockdown efficiency was evaluated by RT-PCR for embryos displaying
cardiac looping defects and cardiac edema after injection
with splice blocking morpholino. Both rbm24a and
rbm24b transcript levels were significantly reduced to
42.80% +/- 3.35, P < 6.5 Ã 10-4 and 40.27% +/- 3.19, P <
4.4 Ã 10-5 of transcript levels in respective uninjected controls (Additional File 12). We used translation blocking
MO in all subsequent MO-based experiments due to their
greater efficacy.
To confirm the phenotype observed in the rbm24 morphants was not due to non-specific morpholino toxicity,
embryos were co-injected with p53 morpholino and
rbm24a MO or rbm24b MO (Methods). The cardiac phenotypes remained unchanged in the presence of the p53
morpholino (Additional File 13). We then performed
phenotype rescue for both rbm24 morphants to determine the sequence specificity of the observed morphant
phenotypes. We generated full length capped poly-A
RNA transcripts for each ortholog and co-injected each
along with the respective rbm24 MO, directed against
the 5âUTR not present in the in vitro transcribed RNA.
Rescue for rbm24a MO was achieved with 800 pg of
RNA (36/45) while 50 pg of RNA was sufficient for
rbm24b MO rescue (35/47). For both orthologs rescue
resulted in properly looped hearts, normal systemic circulation and an absence of cardiac edema and by 72 hpf
and continuing to 96 hpf (Figure 2F, H, J, K, M and 2P).
Taken collectively, these data suggest the phenotype seen
with each rbm24 MO is a specific result of reduction in
gene expression and support the inference from ISH
expression data that both rbm24 orthologs are required
for normal cardiac development.
Depletion of rbm24a and rbm24b compromise cardiac
myocardium development

To better evaluate the impact to the heart of reducing
rbm24a or rbm24b we assayed the expression of several

Figure 2 rbm24a and rbm24b are required for normal cardiac development. Translation blocking morpholinos complementary to rbm24a
(5 ng) or rbm24b (8 ng) were injected into 1-2 cell stage zebrafish embryos and the resulting phenotypes were evaluated compared to
uninjected controls at 48 hpf (A, B, D), 72 hpf (F,G,I), and 96 hpf (K, L, O). Lateral heart views are shown with a dotted outline around the heart
chambers. Both morphant embryo conditions exhibited cardiac looping defects and edema at all stages. Heart chambers are shown with a
dotted outline with chambers denoted: v, ventricle; a, atrium; black arrows, cardiac edema. Phenotype rescue was achieved for each rbm24 via
co-injection of each respective full length capped poly-A RNA transcript (rbm24a 800 pg, rbm24b 50 pg) along with the respective
complementary translation blocking morpholino into 1-2 cell stage embryos where 800 pg rbm24a (C, H, M) or 50 pg rbm24b (E, J, P) achieved
rescue. Rescued embryos posses looped hearts absent of edema.

key myocardial transcripts by ISH, including myosin
light polypeptide 7, myl7 (heart), myosin heavy polypeptide 6, myh6 (atrium) and ventricular myosin heavy
chain, vmhc (ventricle). Expression of each marker was
evaluated in control (uninjected), rbm24a MO and
rbm24b MO injected embryos fixed at 72 hpf at which
point the zebrafish heart is normally, looped, fully developed and functioning, allowing us to comment in
greater detail on the structural deficits contributing to
the gross morphological morphant phenotypes. When
examining the entire heart, both rbm24a and rbm24b
morphant embryos exhibit strong myl7 expression levels
comparable to that of controls albeit within an unlooped
heart tube. The hearts of controls by contrast are appropriately looped (Figure 3A - F). Additionally in rbm24a
morphants defects of the presumptive atrium of the
forming heart tube appear more severe than in the ventricular portion (Figure 3C and 3D). By contrast organization of the developing ventricle and atrium in rbm24b

MO embryos appears equally compromised (Figure 3E
and 3F). Expression of the atrial marker myh6 for both
rbm24 morphants appears qualitatively similar to levels
in uninjected controls. Presumptive atria of rbm24a
morphant heart tubes appear linear and truncated, while
to rbm24b morphants also have linear longer heart
tubes, both contrasting with the looped atrium observed
in uninjected controls (Figure 3G - L). These data are
consistent with the observations that rbm24a expression
was higher in the atrium than the ventricle by 72 hpf,
contrasting with the more uniform expression observed
for rbm24b across both heart chambers (Figure 1).
Both rbm24 morphant conditions exhibited a near
abrogation of the levels of the ventricular marker vmhc
compared to strong expression in uninjected controls
(Figure 3M - 3R). In rbm24a MO morphants expression
of vmhc was faint but with expression clearly bounded
to the heart tube with a clear ventricular portion; however, the expression uncharacteristically extended

beyond the ventricular portion into the presumptive
atrium of the heart tube (Figure 3O and 3P). For
rbm24b morphants vmhc expression was very diffuse
and failed to clearly mark a ventricular boundary. These
findings for vmhc expression were unexpected; both in
the reduction of total expression seen for both rbm24
morphants and the apparent stronger severity of the
ventricular phenotype compared to the atrial phenotype
for both rbm24 morphants. Taken together the expression of these markers highlight the differential spatial
impact of each rbm24 ortholog in heart structure development of the myocardium, and is consistent with our
previous gross morphological observations. These data
indicate an incompletely overlapping role for rbm24a
and rbm24b in heart tube formation and subsequent
heart looping.
Edema in morphant embryos may have multiple origins

Figure 3 Depletion of rbm24a and rbm24b compromise cardiac
myocardial development. The expression patterns of cardiac
markers were analyzed in rbm24 morphants and uninjected controls
at 72 hpf. Ventral and lateral images of the heart are shown with a
dotted line marking the boundary between heart chambers. By
myl7 expression of the entire heart, uninjected controls possess
looped hearts with defined ventricle and atrium chambers (A, B) in
contrast to unlooped hearts for both rbm24 morphants. rbm24a
morphants displayed linear presumptive ventricle and an
incompletely formed presumptive atrium (C, D). rbm24b morphants
displayed a linear presumptive atria and ventricle (E, F). myh6
marking the atrium displayed a looped atrium in controls (G, H)
with linear atrium in rbm24a (I, J), and rbm24b morphants (K, L).
vmhc expression demarks looped ventricles in controls (M, N).
rbm24a morphants displayed little expression bound to an
unlooped heart tube where expression extends to the presumptive
atrium (O, P). Almost no vmhc expression is detectable in rbm24b
morphants (Q, R). v, ventricle region; double arrow, ventricular
expression a, atrium region; solid black arrow, atrial expression.

The observed cardiac edema may result from reduced
circulation as a consequence of defects in heart structure, heart rate, aberrant vasculature or combinations of
these factors. Given the observed structural defects, we
additionally assayed heart rate as a potential contributor
to cardiac edema in the rbm24a MO and rbm24b MO
injected embryos [12]. Heart rate counts were determined for uninjected, rbm24a MO and rbm24b MO
injected embryos (n = 50) at 48, 72 and 96 hpf. At 48
hpf both rbm24a and rbm24b morphants displayed significantly lower heart rate compared to uninjected controls (P < 0.0002) (Figure 4). Heart rates in rbm24a MO
injected embryos remain significantly lower than uninjected controls at 72 hpf and 96 hpf. By contrast the
heart rate of rbm24b MO injected embryos recovered
such that it did not differ significantly from uninjected
controls at 72 hpf and 96 hpf (P > 0.12) despite their
continued structural anomalies. These data demonstrate
cardiac edema is not ameliorated in rbm24b morphants
despite heart rates increasing to normal levels, suggesting the role of other factors must be considered as contributing to compromised circulation. Although defects
in structure and rates of contraction may contribute to
compromised circulatory function, we posit that vascular
disruption likely also plays a role in the resulting edema.
rbm24a and rbm24b are required for normal
vasculogenesis with a potential role in early angiogenesis

To determine the functional role of rbm24a and rbm24b
in vascular development we also undertook MO-based
analyses of each ortholog in the TG(kdrl:G-RCFP) transgenic zebrafish reporter line which fluorescently marks
all endothelial cells highlighting the forming cardiovascular structures [13]. Embryos were examined for vascular expression, after injection of rbm24a MO or rbm24b
MO as described above, after heart formation and

Figure 4 Slow heart rate may contribute to cardiac edema in rbm24 morphants. Heart rates were determined for uninjected control,
rbm24a and rbm24b morphant embryos at 48, 72 & 96 hpf and significance was ascribed from a t-test statistic. 50 embryos were examined for
each condition at each time point. At all time-points the heart rate of rbm24a morphants was significantly lower than controls where P < 2 Ã
10-5. At 48 hpf rbm24b morphants had significantly lower heart rates than controls (P = 1 Ã 10-32). The heart rates for rbm24b morphants then
rose to rates not different from controls by 72 hpf and 96 hpf (P > 0.12) while maintaining the features of the morphant phenotype. Error bars

completion of vasculogenesis at 48 and 72 hpf (Figure
5). As per our earlier experiments, morphant embryos
for both genes exhibit endocardial cardiac edema and a
lack of heart looping displaying little to no circulation
with 30/31 and 45/50 embryos displaying cardiac defects
for rbm24a and rbm24b morphants respectively (Figure
5D - F and 5M - O). Additionally, all rbm24a and
rbm24b morphant embryos display a reduction in total
trunk vasculature and vascular organization in 100% of
the embryos (Figure 5G - I and 5P - R); however vasculogenic and angiogenic vessels are disrupted to differing
degrees. At 48 hpf rbm24a morphants posses a clearly
present PCV appearing thicker than normal with no
detectable DA or CV (Figure 5H). Angiogenesis is
severely disrupted in these embryos with unpaired
stunted dysmorphic Se also appearing thicker extending
only to the midline of the embryo and thus a complete
lack of DLAVs. By contrast the rbm24b morphant at 48
hpf shows little to no disruption of the DA, a visible but
malformed CV and no detectable PCV (Figure 5 I).
Unlike rbm24a morphants, rbm24b morphants have less
disruption of angiogenesis. Se in rbm24b morphants

display pairing at the posterior end of the embryo and
extend dorsally the length of the embryo forming one
DLAV; however, all these vessels are structurally dysmorphic. Both rbm24a and rbm24b vascular morphant
phenotypes become progressively more severe between
48 hpf and 72 hpf. Vessels are less well organized and
the number of vessels present is reduced, with no evidence of IV (Figure 5J - L and 5P - R). Of the morphant
embryos displaying cardiac defects rbm24a and rbm24b
morphants segregated into different classes of vascular
defects, with 31/31 rbm24a morphants analyzed possessing disorganized trunk vasculature where Se do not
extend the entire dorsal length of the embryo and the
DA and CV are undetectable; and 50/50 rbm24b morphants had disorganized trunk vasculature where the Se
formed DLAV and yet the PV was undetectable (Figure
5S and 5T). These data correlate with respective primary
vascular expression locations of rbm24a of DA and
rbm24b of PCV and both displaying expression in the
IV (Figure 1G and 1H). When expression of rbm24a or
rbm24b is compromised formation of the vessels
required for the initial circulation loop is similarly

and trunk with a dotted outline indicating heart chamber boundaries. Uninjected controls at all time-points display looped hearts and properly
developed vasculature. (A, D, G, J, M, P). 48 hpf rbm24a morphants possess unlooped hearts but display only the PCV and stunted disorganized

compromised, likely contributing significantly to the
observed cardiac edema in morphant embryos. These
findings indicate the endocardium is also compromised
as a result of rbm24 knockdown and also suggests that
both rbm24a and rbm24b are independently necessary
for normal early vascular development and support a
putative role for rbm24a in angiogenesis.
rbm24a and rbm24b exhibit incompletely overlapping
functions in zebrafish development

To determine whether rbm24a and rbm24b interact
genetically in the developing zebrafish embryo, we

injected low doses of both rbm24a and rbm24b MOs
into the same embryo. Although each MO dosage
amount was too low (2.5 ng and 4 ng respectively) to
elicit a strong consistent phenotype alone as evidenced
by titration experiments (Additional File 1), a much
more severe phenotype resulted in the morphants
receiving both MOs in concert (Figure 6). The double
morphants displayed greater cardiac edema at 24 hpf
than either morphant alone (Figure 6A - D). By 48 hpf,
the double morphants also displayed very little cardiac
organization, with most (73/93) failing to form any
heart tube structure. No double morphants displayed

Figure 6 Double rbm24a and rbm24b morphants display more
severe cardiac defects. Morpholinos directed to each rbm24
ortholog were injected individually and in tandem into zebrafish
embryos and assessed at 24 hpf and 48 hpf compared to
uninjected embryo hearts (A and E). Individual morpholino
injections were titrated to a low dose for both rbm24a, 2.5 ng (B
and F) and rbm24b, 4ng (C and G). Embryos receiving low doses of
both rbm24a and rbm24b morpholinos resulted in more severe
phenotype than either low dose MO alone, exhibiting severe
cardiac defects and increased edema (D and H).

any circulation (Figure 6E- H). This severe and distinctive phenotype exceeds that observed for either MO
when assayed independently, even at the higher concentrations that yield consistent cardiac defects (5 ng of
rbm24a MO or 8 ng rbm24b MO). These data support
the possibility that roles for rbm24 orthologs may overlap during cardiovascular development.

Discussion
Rbm24 is a novel cardiac gene candidate identified
through transcript profiling of differentiating mESCs [5].
It was initially selected for functional analysis due to its
early cardiac expression during mouse development,
first detected by in situ hybridization in the cardiac crescent of mice, and subsequently in the heart tube and
looping heart.
We integrated syntenic and sequence-based comparative genomic analyses to identify two rbm24 orthologs
in zebrafish, establishing that their expression was concordant with our earlier observations in mice. In the
zebrafish embryo, a reduction of either rbm24 ortholog
expression by injection of morpholinos results in cardiac
looping defects and reduced circulation. These embryos
later exhibit cardiac edema and distention as early as 48
hpf, but this is likely a secondary effect of reduced
rbm24 expression, due instead to reduced circulation
[14]. Our data suggests that reduced circulation is likely
due to a reduction in critical vasculature and not simply
reduced heart rate. Additionally, reduction of either
rbm24a or rbm24b independently yielded vascular
defects of both myocardium and endocardium. We
exclude general toxicity or off target effects as the cause
of the observed morphant phenotype by confirming they

Page 9 of 13

remain without amelioration in the presence of p53
MO. We also confirmed the morphant phenotypes are
sequence-specific by successfully achieving RNA-based
phenotype rescue.
Investigation of molecular markers for myocardial
development further illuminated the impact of reducing
rbm24 expression. Both rbm24 orthologs are detected in
the developing heart by in situ hybridization by 24 hpf
and sustain expression at least through 72 hpf. In all
cases a reduction of rbm24a or rbm24b was sufficient to
prevent heart looping noted at 48 hpf and beyond,
where normal heart looping occurs at approximately 36
hpf. Expression of rbm24a is unequal between the ventricle and atrium with stronger expression in the atrium
while rbm24b shows equivalent expression in both
chambers. This skewed expression of rbm24a at higher
levels in the atrium is illustrated by truncated and
abnormal atrium formation of the developing heart in
rbm24a MO injected embryos demonstrating its
requirement for cardiogenesis, including atrial specification, at this early stage. A reduction in either rbm24
ortholog severely disrupts the expression level and localization of ventricular marker vmhc yielding little to no
expression visible in either rbm24 morphant condition.
Reduced ventricular myocardial count disproportionate
to the atrium has also been reported with deficient nkx
and hedgehog signaling [15,16]. Although reduction of
each rbm24 results in incompletely overlapping atrial
and ventricular phenotypes, reduction of either is sufficient to compromise the looping of the heart tube. The
looping of the heart tube is a result of both genetic and
biophysical mechanisms, and perturbation of the
mechanical force generated by the contraction of the
heart chambers can affect proper heart formation [17].
Zebrafish wea mutants (myh6), display distortions in
cardiac looping, but still maintain a functional circulatory system due to the adaptation of the ventricle [18].
This suggests that reduction in rbm24a expression
impacts both the ventricle and atrium, likely in the organization or structure of the muscle filaments, in addition
to cardiomyocyte count, in turn affecting the ability of
the heart to circulate blood.
Although both rbm24a MO and rbm24b MO injected
embryos display an additional phenotype of aberrant
vascular morphology, with defects in vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis the defect in rbm24a morphants appears
more severe. The observed phenotypes, however, are
also consistent with the exhibited localization of each
rbm24 ortholog, wherein rbm24a is expressed in the DA
and rbm24b is expressed in the PCV by 72 hpf. The
expression difference likely reflects the acquisition of
independent roles since duplication of the ancestral
gene [19,20], resulting in incompletely overlapping functions for these orthologs in vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis

Maragh et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/62

is impaired when expression of either rbm24 ortholog is
reduced. The integrity of these first vessesls of angiogenesis (Se and two DLAVs) deteriorates over time. In
rbm24a morphants Se are more severely affected not
reaching the dorsal line to form DLAVs at 48 hpf and
continue to deteriorate by 72 hpf. This may result form
the lack of any discernable DA. rbm24b morphants still
possessed a visible DA but no PCV, Se and one DLAV
were present and only displayed mild morphology
alterations at 48 hpf with subsequent severe deterioration by 72 hpf. In the case of all rbm24 morphants there
is an inability to maintain the new vessels formed during
angiogenesis and a wasting of any vessels resulting from
vasculogenesis. It is unclear the molecular basis of this
blood vessel deterioration. Normal rbm24 expression
may be playing a direct role in the vascular maintenance
or the angiogenesis pathway. Also to be considered is
that a lack of sufficient concentrations of growth factors
and mitogens due to insufficient circulation may be preventing maintenance of initiated vasculature, since it has
been shown Se sprouting and extension involves several
rounds of cell division [21] and vegfA is required for
vascular maintenance [22].
The incompletely overlapping role of rbm24a and
rbm24b in the developing heart and vasculature is underscored by the extreme phenotype observed in the double
morpholino injections. rbm24a and rbm24b appear to act
in parallel in cardiac development, converging on a common phenotype for which they are both overtly required.
By contrast in vasculogenesis, rbm24a and rbm24b
appear to function in parallel but differentially in artery
and vein formation, resulting in different vascular phenotypes which are individually sufficient to disrupt formation of the initial embryonic circulation loop. Further
analyses will be required to determine the mechanistic
role played by rbm24a/b and whether their roles involve
one or all of the above-discussed mechanisms.
The critical role for rbm24 in cardiogenesis raises the
question whether mutations at the orthologous human
locus may contribute to cardiac disorders. Interestingly,
Wessels et al. recently identified a novel cardiac syndrome with noncompaction cardiomyopathy, bradycardia, pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defects, and
heterotaxy with genetic linkage to human chromosome
6p [23]. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the
implicated interval to chromosome 6p24.3-21.2, a region
encompassing the human RBM24 ortholog (6p22.3),
making it an ideal candidate for variation underlying
this phenotype. However, sequencing of all RBM24 coding exons, intron/exon boundaries and the upstream
promoter region in two affecteds, revealed only known
polymorphisms (rs10456798 and rs35860841) that were
also observed in a heterozygous state in an unaffected
family member. While we can exclude a role for RBM24

Page 10 of 13

coding mutations, additional sequencing of putative regulatory sequences will be necessary to determine if
RBM24 may play a role in this syndrome.

Conclusion
Our data provide significant insight into the role of
rbm24 in formation of cardiac and vascular systems,
however much remains to be learned about the exact
mechanism by which it functions and the role RBM24
may play in human disease. Other RRM containing proteins have also been shown to serve important roles in
embryonic development [24,25] and post-transcriptional
regulation is a frequent theme. With this in mind, we
hypothesize that the protein plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression important for
cardiac and vascular development. In the case of rbm24a
and rbm24b depletion for instance, we found that expression of the ventricular marker vmhc is nearly abolished in
the heart at 72 hpf, suggesting they both may contribute
to specific regulation of vmhc mRNA. We will continue
elucidate the role and mechanisms of rbm24 function in
embryonic development. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the power of the screen that uncovered Rbm24 as
a candidate cardiac gene, adding significant value to the
original data set for which this work represents just the
first of many such analyses awaiting completion.
Methods
Zebrafish maintenance

Adult AB zebrafish were maintained in system water
according to standard methods [26]. Embryos were
obtained from natural mating of adult fish. All experiments were in accordance with ethical permits by Johns
Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number FI10M369.
Bioinformatic identification of zebrafish rbm24 orthologs

We used the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded
by the mouse Rbm24 gene to perform a blastp query
searching the NCBI RefSeq database of D. rerio proteins
from the Zv8 2008 genome assembly. Two genes were
identified (rbm24 and zgc:136803) which encode proteins
displaying strong similarity to the mouse Rbm24 protein
(E-value = 5e-61; 103/116 (88%) and E-value = 3e-90;
188/237 (79%), respectively). As of the Zv9 2010 D. rerio
genome assembly NCBI RefSeq now annotates the two
genes we previously identified as two rbm24 paralogs
with protein coding transcripts: rbm24a on chromosome
19 (RefSeq ID: NM_212865) and rbm24b on chromosome 16 (RefSeq ID: NM_001039925).
Nucleic Acid in situ hybridization

Total RNA was isolated from whole zebrafish embryos at
24 hpf using TRIzol Reagent and total cDNA was

generated with oligo-dT using the SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Riboprobes for rbm24a,
rbm24b, myl7, myh6, and vmhc were generated by PCR
amplification of embryo cDNA. PCR fragments were
TOPO cloned into PCRII vector (TA Cloning Kit Dual
Promoter with pCRII vector, Invitrogen) and transformed
into TOP 10 Cells (Invitrogen). Colonies were mini cultured and plasmid DNA was harvested using the QIAprep
Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) Digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized from 1 Î¼g plasmid DNA using Sp6
and T7 RNA Polymerase (DIG RNA Labeling Kit SP6/T7,
Roche), and purified (SigmaSpin Colums, Sigma). Embryos
for in situ hybridization at 48 hpf and older were treated
with 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) beginning at 48
hpf to reduce pigmentation. Embryos were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4Â°C at 15.5 hpf, 24
hpf, 48 hpf, and 72 hpf; and in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [27].

after injection of either 7.5 ng rbm24a or 9 ng rbm24b
splice blocking MO. Total cDNA was generated with
oligo-dT using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
(Invitrogen). RT-PCR was carried out via the standard
curve method on a Bio-Rad DNA Engine Opticon 2
Real-Time Detection System with primers specific to the
correctly spliced transcripts at 100 ng input cDNA.
Uninjected 24 hpf embryo cDNA was used to generate a
standard curve and cDNA from uninjected experimental
control embryos was assayed at 100 ng cDNA as the
standard for 100% expression. All reactions were run in
triplicate at 25 Î¼L volumes using Power Sybr Green
PCR Master Mix (1x final) (Applied Biosystems), primers at final concentration 0.08 Î¼M each. Significance
of expression reduction was determined using the students t-test statistic comparing transcript levels of
rbm24a or rbm24b in uninjected controls to that measured cDNA from their respective morphants.

Morpholino design and injection

rbm24 MO phenotype rescue

Antisense morpholinos for rbm24a and rbm24b were
designed and provided by Gene Tools, LLC. The rbm24a
translation blocking morpholino (5â-TGCATCCTCACGAAACGCTCAAGTG-3â) and the rbm24b translation
blocking morpholino (5â-AAATAAACTCCTTGCTCCTTGAAGG-3â) were designed to hybridize to the 5â UTR
immediately upstream of the translational start site. Morpholinos were diluted with dH2O to 20 ng/nL and titration
experiments were conducted at 1, 2, 5 and 10 ng rbm24a
MO and 1, 2.5, 5, 7 and 9 ng rbm24b MO to determine an
effective dose (n = 100 embryos per concentration).
Experimental concentrations of 5 ng rbm24a or 8 ng
rbm24b MO were selected and injected into the yolks of
1-2 cell fertilized embryos (n = 75). Double knockdown
experiments were conducted with co-injection of 2.5 ng
rbm24a and 4 ng rbm24b translation blocking MO into
embryos and compared to embryos injected with these
amounts of either MO alone. The rbm24a splice blocking
MO (5â CGTTATTTGAGATGCCTGACTGTT 3â) and
the rbm24b splice blocking MO (5â TATTTTGACGTTATTTACCTGGCTG 3â) were designed to hybridize to
the boundary of the second exon and second intron of the
transcript and injected at 7.5 ng and 9 ng respectively.
Antisense p53 MO (5â-GCGCCATTGCTTTGCAAGAATTG-3â) previously published [28] was purchased
from Gene Tools, LLC and 1 ng was injected into 1-2 cell
stage fertilized embryos both with and without each
rbm24 translation blocking MO (n = 50) [29]. Embryos
were analyzed for cardiac and vascular phenotypes at 48,
72 and 96 hpf.

Total RNA was isolated from whole zebrafish embryos
24 hpf using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and total
cDNA was generated with oligo-dT using SuperScript
III First-Strand Synthesis (Invitrogen). Full length
rbm24a and rbm24b cDNA were PCR amplified and
cloned into the pCR8 gateway vector (pCR8âGWâTOPO
TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) before being cloned into
the pCSDEST destination vector (kindly provided by the
lab of Nathan Lawson, UMass Med School). Full length
sense capped Poly-A RNA was generated for rbm24a
and rbm24b with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit
(Ambion) and quantified with a NanoDrop 1000. Full
length RNA was co-injected into 1-2 cell embryos with
rbm24a MO or rbm24b MO at titrating levels and evaluated for phenotype rescue at 48, 72 and 96 hpf. Rescue
was confirmed with 800 pg rbm24a RNA and 50 pg
rbm24b RNA.

RT-PCR to determine transcript knock down efficiency

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) from whole morphant zebrafish embryos at 24 hpf

Sequence analysis

Genomic DNA from two patients and an unaffected
family member were included [23]. Direct sequencing of
part of the promoter region (1031 bp), all exons plus
exon-intron boundaries and a putative regulatory element in intron 3 (1164 bp) of the RBM24 gene was
undertaken. Primers were designed to cover all four
exons representing the âcanonicalâ sequence
(ENST00000379052, transcript length 2,458 bp and 236
aa, http://www.ensembl.org). PCR primers were
designed by Primer3 software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/
cgi-bin/primer3/primer3.cgi and are available on
request. Amplified PCR products were purified and
sequenced using BigDye Terminator chemistry v3.1 on
an ABI Prism 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Biomedical research involving human subjects

Maragh et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:62

has been performed according to the principles of the
Helsinkiâs Declaration. Written informed consents were
obtained from the patients and relatives involved in the
research. Genomic DNA was taken from patients as per
standard care and therefore ethical approval was not
required.
Heart Rate counts

Heart rates (beats per minute) were counted for uninjected, rbm24a MO and rbm24b MO injected embryos
displaying the morphant phenotype at 48, 72 and 96
hpf. 50 embryos were analyzed per condition per time
point. Average heart rates with standard error were
plotted and significant heart rate deviation of morphants
compared to uninjected controls was determined using
the students t-test.
Fluorescent vascular imaging

The transgenic zebrafish line TG(kdrl:G-RCFP) generated by Cross and colleagues [13] was used for vascular
expression. Adult fish and embryos were maintained as
described [26]. Embryos were injected with either 5 ng
rbm24a MO or 8 ng rbm24b MO at the 1-2 cell stage
and analyzed at 48 and 72 hpf for G-RCFP expression
via fluorescence microscopy.
