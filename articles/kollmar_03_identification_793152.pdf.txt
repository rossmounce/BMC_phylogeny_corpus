Abstract
Background: Kinesins constitute a large superfamily of motor proteins in eukaryotic cells. They
perform diverse tasks such as vesicle and organelle transport and chromosomal segregation in a
microtubule- and ATP-dependent manner. In recent years, the genomes of a number of eukaryotic
organisms have been completely sequenced. Subsequent studies revealed and classified the full set
of members of the kinesin superfamily expressed by these organisms. For Dictyostelium discoideum,
only five kinesin superfamily proteins (Kif's) have already been reported.
Results: Here, we report the identification of thirteen kinesin genes exploiting the information
from the raw shotgun reads of the Dictyostelium discoideum genome project. A phylogenetic tree of
390 kinesin motor domain sequences was built, grouping the Dictyostelium kinesins into nine
subfamilies. According to known cellular functions or strong homologies to kinesins of other
organisms, four of the Dictyostelium kinesins are involved in organelle transport, six are implicated
in cell division processes, two are predicted to perform multiple functions, and one kinesin may be
the founder of a new subclass.
Conclusion: This analysis of the Dictyostelium genome led to the identification of eight new kinesin
motor proteins. According to an exhaustive phylogenetic comparison, Dictyostelium contains the
same subset of kinesins that higher eukaryotes need to perform mitosis. Some of the kinesins are
implicated in intracellular traffic and a small number have unpredictable functions.

Background
Eukaryotic cells express three types of motor proteins:
myosins, kinesins and dyneins [1]. Each constitutes a
large superfamily based on the highly conserved motor
domain [2-4]. All motors have in common that they use
the energy derived by the hydrolysis of ATP to produce
mechanical force. While myosins move on actin filaments, kinesins and dyneins are responsible for the retrograde and anterograde transport along microtubule tracks.
The first kinesin was isolated from squid giant axons as a
protein responsible for fast axonal transport [5,6]. This

conventional kinesin (KHC) was shown to be a tetramer
including two heavy and two light chains. The heavy
chain consists of an N-terminal motor domain with
microtubule affinity and ATPase activity followed by an
extended coiled-coil region containing the light chain
binding site [7] and a C-terminal domain that binds to the
cargos. Like KHC, most kinesins have their motor
domains at the N-terminus. However, in some kinesins,
the motor domain is located in the centre of the molecule
and a few others have C-terminal motor domains. In general, the position of the motor domain determines the

directionality of transport: N-terminal kinesins move to
the plus end and C-terminal kinesins to the minus end of
microtubules [8]. Kinesins with central motor domains
do not generate movement but function as microtubule
depolymerases [9].
Based on phylogenetic analysis, kinesins were grouped
into nine [3] or, more recently, thirteen subfamilies [10].
Higher eukaryotes share a common subset of ten subfamilies. Additionally, there are some kingdom specific
kinesin subfamilies. Together with the subfamilies, the
cellular functions of the kinesins seem to have segregated,
although there are some exceptions. Three subfamilies are
implicated in organelle transport: KHC, Unc104/Kif1,
and Osm3 kinesins. KHC subfamily members have been
reported to transport numerous membrane cargoes such
as, for example, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula and
lysosomes [11]. Lower eukaryotic Unc104 motors have
more general roles in membrane trafficking, while their
metazoan orthologs specialize in transporting synaptic
vesicle precursors in the nervous system [12]. Osm3 kinesins are heterotrimeric and primarily involved in "intraflagellar transport" [1] but are also involved in other tasks,
including the transport of vesicular cargoes in neurons
[13].
The six subfamilies solely attributed to mitotic functions
are the BimC/Eg5, NCD/Kar3, MKLP1, MCAK/Kif2, Kip3
and CENP-E motors. All BimC motors examined to date
have been found to be located on the microtubules
between spindle poles [14,15] and to form bipolar
tetramers [16]. They are supposed to cross-link antiparallel microtubules in the spindle midzone [16] and to slide
them past one another to separate poles. To organise the
spindle microtubules, BimC kinesins work together with
C-terminal motors of the NCD/Kar3 subfamily [17]. Kar3
and NCD, the most extensively analysed C-kinesins, can
both bind microtubules with their N-terminal tails [18]
and therefore cross-link and slide microtubules by
anchoring their tails to one microtubule, while generating
force with their motor domains against adjacent microtubules. MKLP1 kinesins are involved in mitosis associated
with the spindle midzone during anaphase and concentrating to a midbody matrix during cytokinesis [19].
MCAK/Kif2 kinesins are reported to destabilize microtubules [20] and associate to mitotic centromers [21]. The
attachment of MCAK to the centromer is mediated via
non-motor domains [22], while the motor domain is
responsible for microtubule depolymerisation [20,23].
Vertebrate members of the CENP-E subfamily have been
shown to bind to kinetochores during mitosis [24] and
are involved in chromosome segregation. In interphase
cells, Kip3 from S. cerevisae localizes to cytoplasmic microtubules, during mitosis it is most concentrated along the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/47

nuclear spindle, and late in anaphase it is preferentially
found in the spindle midzone [25,26].
Compared to the vast amount of data describing the structures, functions and localisations of Dictyostelium myosins
[27,28], there are so far only a few investigations of Dictyostelium kinesins. Already in the early days of kinesin
research the first Dictyostelium kinesin was isolated from
cell lysates as a 105 kDa protein, based on its nucleotidedependent binding to microtubules [29]. About ten years
later, a PCR-based approach resulted in the full-length
sequence of one kinesin (K7) and short fragments of further kinesins (K3, K4, K6, and K8) [30]. K7 was also analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy and shown to
localise to a membranous perinuclear structure. Using the
video microscopic observation of organelle transport in
vitro as an assay, two further kinesins of 170 and 245 kDa
were isolated [31]. The 245 kDa kinesin was found to be
an Unc104/Kif1A homologue responsible for about 60 %
of organelle movement. The third kinesin sequence (K2)
revealed a C-terminal type kinesin related to the NCD/
Kar3 subfamily. K2 localised as GFP fusion to the nuclei
of cells at the interphase and to mitotic spindles during
mitosis [32]. Two further sequences were obtained as a
result of the assembly of the genomic sequences of chromosome 2 [33].
The genome of Dictyostelium discoideum is covered now
with shotgun reads to a depth of 6 to 8 [34]. Here, we have
obtained the full set of kinesin superfamily proteins by
homology searches for the motor domain. In addition to
the five known kinesins, we identified eight new superfamily members. The sequences of the motor domains
were aligned with those of 377 kinesins from 50 species
found in the databases and phylogenetically analysed.
The Dictyostelium kinesins group into nine subfamilies,
one of the kinesins constituting the founder of a new
class.

Results
Identification and nomenclature
Thirteen kinesins were identified in the Dictyostelium
genome, based on the sequence homology of the kinesin
motor domain, and their full-length sequences were
assembled (Fig. 1, Table 1). Five of the sequences have
already been published [30-33] as well as fragments of
DdKif3, DdKif4, DdKif6, and DdKif8 [30]. Since genes
belonging to the same family should be designated by
using the same acronym, we decided to give all the kinesins the acronym Kif followed by a number. Following the
Dictyostelium genetic convention, which is intended to be
conform with the conventions derived from Demerec et
al. [35], the Dictyostelium kinesins are given a locus
descriptor consisting of three italic letters, followed by a
capital italicised letter to distinguish genes. In an early

analysis of Dictyostelium genes [36], the kinesin genes were
assigned the acronym ksn. However, this acronym ksn is
not used for kinesin proteins of any other organism and it
does not appear in the common databases (for example
GeneBank or Trembl). We chose Kif because this name is
in accordance with the nomenclature of human and
mouse kinesins. Other acronyms like Klp (for kinesin-like
protein) or Krp (for kinesin related protein) are not as
widely used and have misleading implications. The established numbering was retained and the newly discovered
kinesins added in random order.
Phylogenetic analysis and classification
A phylogenetic tree of the motor domains of the Dictyostelium kinesins together with 377 kinesin motor domain
sequences from 50 species found in the public databases
was created (Fig. 2, supplementary data [see Additional

file 1]). The tree is in basic agreement with the phylogenetic results of earlier investigations that, however, only
included 146 kinesins in the most extensive analysis [3].
The kinesin superfamily comprises 17 subfamilies of Nterminal motors, two subfamilies of kinesins with central
motor domains, and four subfamilies with C-terminal
kinesins. Subfamilies were only assigned when kinesins of
different organisms contribute. The new subfamilies were
designated obeying the more general nomenclature of
Miki et al. [10] (N-1 to N-17, M-1 and M-2, C-1 to C-4) as
well as following the old convention that new classes
should be named after the first member discovered.
According to this phylogenetic tree, twelve of the Dictyostelium kinesins group into nine different subfamilies, only
DdKif9 might be an orphan or the founder of a new class.
Based on the position of their motor domains, two of the
kinesins (DdKif6 and DdKif9) are of the middle motor

domain type, one (DdKif2) has the motor domain at the
C-terminus and the remaining kinesins have N-terminal
motor domains.
Organelle transporters
Based on the phylogenetic tree, four Dictyostelium kinesins
group to the Unc104/Kif1 (DdKif1) and KHC (DdKif3,
DdKif5, DdKif7) subfamilies that are implicated in
organelle transport (Figs 1, 2). Two of the KHC subfamily
members are new.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/47

DdKif4 (CENP-E subfamily)
Phylogenetically, Kif4 groups to the mammalian and
metazoan CENP-E kinesins. Those motors belong to the
longest of all kinesins and have tails of about 2000 aa
forming coiled-coil structures. In a similar way, DdKif4
contains a tail of long, interrupted coiled-coil regions. In
contrast to the other CENP-E kinesins, Kif4 has a putative
nuclear localisation signal C-terminal to its motor
domain.

DdKif3 (KHC subfamily)
This kinesin contains an N-terminal motor domain followed by a 30 aa linker consisting of only glycine and serine residues. The linker is connected to a long α-helical
domain composed of several predicted coiled-coil
regions. The C-terminus (aa ~980–1193) is extremely rich
in asparagine, proline and serine residues. It is predicted
not to contain any secondary structural elements, except
for loops, and might therefore only fold in the presence of
specific interacting proteins or membranes. The small
peptide sequence obtained from tryptic digest of a 170
kDa kinesin that is able to reconstitute plus-end directed
membrane transport [31] is identical to DdKif3. Interestingly, the sizes from SDS gel electrophoresis and weight
calculation (131 kDa) are quite different.
DdKif5 (KHC subfamily)
Based on phylogenetic appearance, protein length and
domain organisation, DdKif5 is the most similar Dictyostelium kinesin to human conventional kinesin. Neck and
tail domains are composed of long α-helical stretches,
which are predicted to form interrupted coiled-coils. The
probability of building dimers or higher oligomers is
enhanced by two leucine zippers (at aa ~350 and ~810).
The respective tail sections of the Dictyostelium KHC subfamily kinesins do not show a strong homology to the
KLC binding site (amino acid residues 770–810 [7]) of
human KHC. This heptad-repeat region is highly conserved between mammalian and invertebrate species and
most likely forms an α-helical coiled-coil interaction with
a corresponding heptad-repeat region of KLC. Nonetheless, DdKif5 is the Dictyostelium kinesin with the highest
similarity in this region and therefore the most likely candidate for binding of possible Dictyostelium kinesin light
chains.
Mitotic motors
Dictyostelium contains six kinesin motor proteins belonging to subgroups predicted to function exclusively during
mitosis (Figs 1, 2). Two of them belong to the CENP-E
subfamily (DdKif4, DdKif11) and one each to the BimC/
Eg5 (DdKif13), MKLP1 (DdKif12), MCAK/Kif2 (DdKif6)
and NCD/Kar3 (DdKif2) subfamilies. The C-terminal
kinesin Kif2 has already been described [32].

long insertions
Structure of the motor domain of human Kif5B [78] highlighting loops for which some of the Dictyostelium kinesins have
long insertions. The approximate lengths of the insertions
are given.

DdKif11 (CENP-E subfamily)
DdKif11 is the shortest of the Dictyostelium kinesins and
groups to the plant branch of the CENP-E subfamily. The
primary sequence of the motor domain shows an
elongated loop-2 (L2) containing five consecutive LKTP
motifs (Fig. 3). The non-motor part of the protein is
mostly α-helical and predicted to form coiled-coils. The
protein sequence ends with amino acid residues EVML.
This motif is implicated in binding of PDZ domains (the
name PDZ derives from the first three proteins in which
these domains were identified: PSD-95, DLG, and ZO-1
[37]). PDZ domains play important roles in the transport,

localization and assembly of supramolecular signalling
complexes [39].
DdKif13 (BimC/Eg5 subfamily)
Overall, Kif13 has a similar domain organisation to other
members of this subfamily. As most members of the
BimC/Eg5 family, it shares several invariant amino acids
surrounding a conserved p34cdc2 kinase consensus phosphorylation site (S/TPxK/R). This conserved sequence has
been termed the BimC box motif [40]. Mutation of threonine to alanine in this motif has been shown to prevent
their association with the mitotic spindle for both Xenopus
and human Eg5 [41,42].
DdKif6 (MCAK/Kif2 subfamily)
At the N-terminus, DdKif6 contains a sterile alpha motif
(SAM) domain [43]. This domain is a putative proteinprotein interaction module that is present in a wide variety of proteins involved in many biological processes [44].
SAM domains do not form homo-oligomers in solution
[45,46], although homodimers of SAM domains of different proteins have been found in crystal structures [47].
Instead, SAM domains hetero-oligomerize either by interacting with SAM domains of other proteins [44] or with
other protein modules like the Src homology 2 (SH2)
domains [48]. Following the SAM domain, DdKif6 contains long stretches of consecutive asparagine, serine,
glutamine and glutamic acid residues. The regions
neighbouring the central motor domain are mostly α-helical and are partly predicted to form coiled-coils.
DdKif12 (MKLP1 subfamily)
DdKif12's motor domain contains a long N-terminal
extension (~120 residues) and an extremely long loop-6
(L6) that constitutes the succession of the P-loop helix
(Fig. 3). Kinesin motor domains share a close structural
homology to myosin motor domains [49]. In myosins,
the loop following the P-loop helix (called loop-1) is
responsible for nucleotide affinity that decreases with the
length and flexibility of this loop [50]. L6 might have a
similar function in kinesin. The motor domain additionally contains a very long L12, having five positively
charged residues in its sequence. This is similar to the Kloop composition in Kif1 kinesins from mammals. The
tail of DdKif12 contains some predicted coiled-coil
regions but does not show similarity to any protein in the
databases.
Motors with multiple or unknown function
DdKif8 of the Kif4 subfamily and DdKif10 of the Kip3
subfamily belong to subfamilies members of which have
been found to be involved in either mitosis or organelle
transport, or which participate in both processes depending on the stages of the cell cycle.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/47

DdKif8 (Kif4 subfamily)
The motor domain of DdKif8 contains the longest loop10 (L10) of all sequenced kinesins, having about 70 extra
residues compared to normal L10's (Fig. 3). L10 consists
(from the N- to the C-terminus) of a serine/threonine
linker, eight lysine residues (five consecutive), another
serine linker and a stretch of 14 consecutive aspartic or
glutamic acid residues, followed by a final linker. This
loop is involved in neither nucleotide binding nor in the
direct kinesin-microtubule interface, so its function was
not yet analysed. Based on its length, it might be possible
that the lysine part interacts with the E hook of tubule
molecules in a similar way to the K loop of Unc104/Kif1A
(a lysine rich L12) is suggested to function [51,52]. Further possible functions include interactions with other
microtubule bound proteins. The stalk domain of DdKif8
is mostly α-helical, containing extended regions rich in
polar residues and a coiled-coil domain. The C-terminus
is built of seven WD-40 repeats which contribute to a
seven-bladed beta propeller [53]. Blade five and blade six
are separated by an unusually long insert of ~100 residues.
WD40 domains are known to mediate protein-protein
interactions [54] and the function of this domain in
DdKif8 might be the binding of a specific protein cargo,
either as part of a protein complex or as a receptor
attached to an organelle.
DdKif10 (Kip3 subfamily)
Following the motor domain, DdKif10 is predicted to
have some coiled-coil structure, interrupted by a negatively charged region mainly consisting of asparagines and
aspartic acids. In the middle of the protein, there are two
EF-hand binding domains, the first one having only weak
homology. EF-hand motifs almost always occur in pairs,
packed together in a face-to-face manner [55]. Their functions include the transduction of intracellular Ca2+ signals
as well as Ca2+ uptake and buffering. Recent investigations
also show that EF-hand domains are responsible for
homo- and heterodimerisation [56,57]. Directly behind
the second EF-hand motif, DdKif10 contains a stretch of
almost 50 consecutive asparagine residues. The C-terminal domain is composed of α-helical and β-sheet structure, as well as a short predicted coiled-coil domain.
DdKif9 (not classified)
The motor domain of DdKif9 does not group with any of
the other known kinesins and may therefore be the
founder of a new class. Its motor domain is located in the
centre of the molecule and contains one of the longest
loop-5s (L5) of all kinesins (Fig. 3). L5 constitutes the
interruption of the long α-2 helix C-terminal to the Ploop. In myosins, the length and flexibility of the loop
following the P-loop helix (named loop-1) has a strong
effect on nucleotide affinity [50,58]. Whether L5 has a
similar influence on the affinity of kinesins to nucleotides

was not yet analysed. The N-terminal domain is rich in
amino acids proline, asparagine, serine and threonine,
while the C-terminal domain is α-helical and predicted to
form coiled-coils. The C-terminus is concluded with a
transmembrane domain that might be the linker to membranous cargos.
Missing motors
Due to the broad diversity of the kinesin family, different
evolutionary lineages have evolved different subfamilies
with specialised functions. The only major subfamilies for
which Dictyostelium does not contribute are the Osm3 (N4) and Kif15 (N-10) kinesins.

Discussion
The nine subfamilies identified in the Dictyostelium
genome are Unc104/Kif1 (DdKif1), Kif4 (DdKif8), NCD/
Kar3 (DdKif2), KHC (DdKif3, DdKif5, DdKif7), BimC/Eg5
(DdKif13), CENP-E (DdKif4, DdKif11), MCAK/Kif2
(DdKif6), MKLP1 (DdKif12) and Kip3 (DdKif10). Kif9
could not be grouped to one of the already assigned subfamilies. Structurally, two of the kinesins (DdKif6 and
DdKif9) are of the middle motor domain type, one
(DdKif2) has the motor domain at the C-terminus and the
remaining are N-terminal kinesins. Functionally, Dictyostelium contains some kinesins of the KHC and Unc104/
Kif1 subfamily that have been shown to or are implicated
to perform intracellular transport. To accomplish mitosis
and cytokinesis, kinesins from all essential classes are
available: BimC/Eg5, CENP-E, NCD/Kar3, MCAK/Kif2
and MKLP1. Additionally, Dictyostelium has two kinesins
of the Kip3 and Kif4 subfamilies, members of which were
shown to participate in either or both of the above mentioned processes in other organisms. Like most other species, Dictyostelium also has its unique kinesin (DdKif9)
that has an unknown function. The only major
subfamilies for which Dictyostelium does not contribute
are the Osm3 (N-4) and Kif15(N-10) kinesins. Osm3
kinesins comprise a subfamily of mainly heterotrimeric
motors built of two kinesin chains and a tightly associated
subunit. They are involved in "intraflagellar transport" [1]
and other specialised tasks such as the movement of vesicular cargo in neurons or pigmented melanosomes in
melanophore cells. Kif15 kinesins are involved in mitosis
by transiently positioning spindle poles, specifically during prometaphase [59] or by maintaining spindle bipolarity [60].
Organelle transporters
The Dictyostelium genome contains four kinesins belonging to subfamilies involved in organelle transport. Their
biochemical properties and cellular functions have been
discussed elsewhere [61].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/47

Mitotic motors
The BimC/Eg5, CENP-E, NCD/Kar3, MCAK/Kif2 and
MKLP1 subfamily members comprise the essential subset
of kinesins necessary for mitosis of higher eukaryotes.
DdKif13 is phylogenetically one of the most divergent
BimC kinesins but has a similar domain organisation and
contains the BimC motif. Therefore, it is expected to form
a bipolar tetramer and is likely to fulfil the same function
as other BimC kinesins. BimC kinesins work in close
cooperation with C-terminal motors of the NCD/Kar3
subfamily to organise the spindle microtubules [15,17].
As NCD/Kar3 kinesins move to the minus ends of microtubules, they work in the opposite direction to the BimC
kinesins causing contraction of the spindle. The spindle
structure is therefore established and maintained by the
smooth balance between NCD/Kar3 and BimC action.
Dictyostelium also contains a kinesin of the NCD/Kar3
subfamily, namely DdKif2, which has been localised to
mitotic spindles being enriched toward the spindle poles,
as compared to spindle microtubules [32]. DdKif2 and
DdKif13 are therefore the Dictyostelium kinesins responsible for the organisation of the spindle microtubules.

Dictyostelium contains two members of the CENP-E subfamily. Members of this subfamily bind to kinetochores
during mitosis [62] and are responsible for the alignment
of the chromosomes [63]. The two Dictyostelium members
of the CENP-E subfamily, DdKif4 and DdKif11, are very
different in all aspects. DdKif4 is phylogenetically more
similar to the mammalian homologues, with a similar
length and domain organisation, having only coiled-coil
regions in its tail. As the nuclear envelope does not break
down during mitosis of Dictyostelium cells, the nuclear
localisation signal that lack mammalian homologues is
obviously important for its destination. DdKif4 therefore
likely operates in kinetochore binding and chromosome
separation. DdKif11 is by far the shortest of the Dictyostelium kinesins. It groups to the plant members of the CENPE subfamily that are very diverse in length. None of these
plant kinesins has been functionally analysed, so it has yet
to be determined whether they have a similar function to
their mammalian homologues. DdKif11 also has a PDZ
domain-binding motif. These motifs are implicated in
transport, localization and assembly of supramolecular
signalling complexes [39]. It is therefore unlikely that
DdKif4 and DdKif11 have entirely overlapping functions.
Another kinesin with expected function in mitosis is
DdKif6, belonging to the MCAK/Kif2 subfamily. MCAK/
Kif2 kinesins have been shown to depolymerise microtubules in vitro [20,23]. This is consistent with their
observed function in vivo where their inhibition interferes
with the poleward movement of chromosomes during
anaphase A [22], a process being associated with the
shortening of the microtubules that connect the

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

chromosomes to the poles. In addition to the well-conserved motor domain, Kif6 contains a SAM domain at its
N-terminus. The phylogenetically closest related metazoan members of the subtree (LemKif4 and MmKif24)
also have a SAM domain at their N-terminus. The selfassociation of SAM domains has been known for some
time to play a regulatory role in proteins involved in the
regulation of developmental processes among diverse
eukaryotes [44]. For example, in Dictyostelium cells, the
levels of DPYK1, a SAM-containing protein-tyrosine
kinase, increase as the cells initiate their signal-mediated
developmental cycle [64]. The SAM domain of DdKif6
might therefore be the reason for its observed developmental regulation [30].
DdKif12 groups to the MKLP1 subfamily. Based on their
amino acid sequence, MKLP1 kinesins are characterised
by their extremely long L6, the loop following the P-loop
helix. The specific function of this loop has not yet been
analysed in detail but from the close structural similarity
of the kinesin motor domain to the motor domain of
myosins [49], this loop might be involved in determining
nucleotide affinity. Mammals have three kinesins of this
subfamily of different length and domain organisation.
CHO1 (Kif23), the most extensively analysed MKLP1
kinesin, is involved in mitosis and has been shown to
mediate antiparallel microtubule sliding [65], most probable by cross-linking antiparallel microtubules by its second, nucleotide insensitive microtubule binding site [66].
Rab6-Kif (Kif20A) also functions in cell division during
cleavage furrow formation and cytokinesis [67] but additionally localises to the Golgi apparatus and plays a role
in the dynamics of this organelle [68]. In addition to their
tasks during mitosis, some MKLP1 kinesins might thus
perform other functions during interphase and this might
also be true for DdKif12.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/47

repeats, which are also found in mammalian Kif21 kinesins and other kinesins of this subfamily.
In recent years, the genomes of a number of eukaryotic
organisms have been completely sequenced. In subsequent studies the full set of members of the kinesin superfamily were identified and classified from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [71], Saccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster [72], mouse and human [10], Arabidopsis thaliana
[73] and Caenorhabditis elegans [74]. The Arabidopsis
genome contains by far the most kinesin genes (61 Kif's;
Table 2).
Some of the kinesin subfamilies only include members
from specific kingdoms. The N-14, N-17, M-2, and C-4
classes are plant specific, the N-13 subfamily exclusively
harbours yeast members and only mammals contribute to
a special class of C-terminal kinesins (C-2) as well as to
the N-15 kinesins. The N-9 and N-11 subfamilies are, as
yet, reserved for members of the metazoan subkingdom.
This is similar to results of the analysis of the myosin
superfamily, which also showed that some classes are
restricted to specific kingdoms. Taking into account that
the yet to be classified kinesins will appear as members of
new classes, the mammalian genomes comprise by far the
highest diversity, harbouring kinesins of 19 subfamilies.
Compared to the other completed genomes, Dictyostelium
has a similar percentage of kinesin genes. The thirteen
kinesins group into nine characterised subfamilies and
one new class. This subfamily diversity is comparable to
that observed for the Drosophila and C. elegans genomes.
While Dictyostelium mostly contributes only one member
to the subfamilies, more complex organisms show additional diversity, often having several members per
subfamily.

Motors with multiple or unknown function
DdKif10 belongs to the Kip3 subfamily of kinesin motors.
The only member of this subfamily that has been analysed
yet is Kip3 from S. cerevisiae [25,26]. In contrast to ScKip3,
DdKif10 contains EF-hand motifs in the tail. EF-hand
motifs are implicated in the transduction of intracellular
Ca2+ signals. DdKif10 might therefore fulfil several different functions during interphase and mitosis.

Conclusions

Another Dictyostelium kinesin potentially performing multiple functions is DdKif8, belonging to the Kif4 subfamily.
Kif4 from mammals has been shown to function in the
anterograde transport of certain organelles in juvenile
neurons and other cells [69]. Furthermore, it colocalized
at the mitotic spindle during mitosis, where it is associated with chromosomes [70]. DdKif8 was found to be
constitutively expressed [30]. Its tail contains seven WD40

Methods

This analysis of the Dictyostelium genome led to the identification of eight new kinesin motor proteins. According
to an exhaustive phylogenetic comparison, Dictyostelium
contains the same subset of kinesins that higher eukaryotes need to perform mitosis. Some of the kinesins are
implicated in intracellular traffic and a few have unpredictable functions.

Identification of Dictyostelium kinesins
The full-length sequences of DdKif1, DdKif2, DdKif5,
DdKif7 and DdKif9 have been reported in the literature.
Additionally, for DdKif4 the mRNA sequence is available,
differing from the genomic sequence by a gap of about
100 bp that is, however, dubious. The whole dataset generated by the Dictyostelium Sequencing Consortium

www.uni-koeln.de/dictyostelium; http://www.pasteur.fr/
recherche/unites/gmp/sitesgmp/gmp_projects.html was
used to search for kinesin domains. For this purpose, all
available raw reads were translated into all six reading
frames and subsequently examined for the presence of
Interpro domains IPR000857, IPR001752, IPR002151,
and IPR008658 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro. All reads
containing at least parts of the domains were sampled and
assembled together with adjacent sequence reads. The
assembly was performed using the Staden package http://
www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/pubseq/staden_home.html. To
obtain contigs containing the full length genes, reads were
added to the contigs until the gene prediction software
geneid predicted the same gene structure for the kinesin
domain containing genes independently from the contig
length. Furthermore, all six reading frames of contigs
larger than 1 kb resulting from a phrap based assembly of
all sequences were scanned for the presence of these
domains. One kinesin domain-containing gene (kif11)
could only be detected by the single read examination,
indicating that the phrap based assembly failed to produce larger contigs in this particular genomic region.
Taking advantage of uneven distributions of reads derived
from different chromosome specific libraries, the
predicted kinesin domain containing genes were assigned

to specific chromosomes. Each predicted gene was
checked for matching ESTs from the Japanese cDNA
project. Most of the predicted genes could at least partly
be covered by EST sequences indicating expression of the
genes. Only for kif 5 and kif 9 was no EST available. This
may be due to the fact that most of the ESTs were derived
from cells entering the sexual or developmental cycle.
Building trees
The motor domain of DdKif1 was used in a BLASTP search
using the WU-BLAST2 server at EMBL http://dove.emblheidelberg.de/Blast2/; [75]). The sequences obtained were
compared with recent compilations of kinesin sequences
[3,10,73] and missing sequences were manually added.
Altogether 377 kinesin sequences from 50 species were
obtained (see supplemental material) and aligned
together with the thirteen Dictyostelium kinesins using
ClustalW [76] software. The alignment showed that especially the sequences of kinesins from L. major and P. falciparum were misaligned because of the many unusual
insertions (extended loops). The crude alignment was
extensively manually improved according to the conserved secondary structural elements of the motor
domain, which were obtained from a superposition of all
crystal structures (Kollmar, unpublished data). An
unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated using the

Bootstrap (1,000 replicates) method implemented in
ClustalW (standard settings) and drawn by using
TreeView [77]. The tree did not change considerably when
a correction for multiple substitutions was applied, nor
did it change when 10,000 replicates were used.
