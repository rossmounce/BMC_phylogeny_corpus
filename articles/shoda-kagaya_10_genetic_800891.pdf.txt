process of damaged area expansion

Abstract
Background: The ambrosia beetle, Platypus quercivorus, is the vector of oak wilt, one of the most serious forest
diseases in Japan. Population genetics approaches have made great progress toward studying the population
dynamics of pests, especially for estimating dispersal. Knowledge of the genetic structuring of the beetle
populations should reveal their population history. Using five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, 605 individuals
from 14 sampling sites were assessed to infer the ongoing gene flow among populations as well as the processes
of expansion of damaged areas.
Results: Population differentiation (FST = 0.047, G’ST = 0.167) was moderate and two major clusters were detected
by several methods, dividing the samples into north-eastern and south-western populations, a similar genetic
divergence was reported in host oak trees. Within the north-eastern populations, the subgroups mostly
corresponded to differences in the collection period. The genetic characteristics of the population might have
changed after 2 years due to the mixing of individuals between populations with enhanced migration related to
population outbreaks. Because isolation by distance was detected for whole populations and also within the northeastern populations, migration was considered to be limited between neighbouring populations, and most
populations were suggested to be in genetic equilibrium of genetic drift and gene flow. Recent bottlenecks were
found in some populations with no geographical bias; however, they were all from newly emerged oak wilt
forests. The emergence of oak wilt should have induced intense fluctuations in the beetle population size.
Conclusions: Because the genetic boundaries coincide, we suggest that the geographical structuring of the beetle
was formed by co-evolution with the host species. Our findings indicate the oak wilt expansion process.

Background
Understanding the processes that drive the spread of
plant diseases by vector beetles is critical for developing
plans to protect against such damage. Population genetic
approaches have made great progress toward studying
the population dynamics of pests, especially for estimating dispersal (e.g., [1,2]). Here we report the population
genetic structure of an oak forest pest, Platypus quercivorus (Murayama; Coleoptera: Platypodidae), and infer
the ongoing gene flow among populations.
Japan has lost vast oak tree forests, particularly stands of
Quercus crispula Blume, due to wilt, at a rate of approximately 2,000 ha/year [3]. This mass mortality of oaks is

caused by Raffaelea quercivora Kubono et Shin-Ito [4] and
its vector, the ambrosia beetle P. quercivorus [5,6]. Oak
wilt is the first example of a disease caused by an ambrosia
fungus carried by an ambrosia beetle that kills vigorous
trees [7]. Although the disease was first reported in the
1930s and its emergence has been sporadically reported
[8,9], no epidemical symptoms were established before the
1980s [10]. As of 2007, the disease had expanded rapidly,
and damage had been reported in 23 of the 46 prefectures
in Japan (Figure 1) [11].
The range of the damaged area has been expanding,
but where the beetles originated remains unknown.
Knowledge of the genetic structuring of the beetle populations should reveal their population history. Such information may also contribute to an understanding of why
the oak wilt has been so damaging. Kamata et al. [7]

main cause of the increase in oak wilt because P. quercivorus was widely distributed in Japan before the epidemics. Specifically, they suggested that the beetles use
mature trees, whose prevalence has increased in oak
forests following the disuse of firewood. Changes in the
distribution of the beetles may be traced using population
genetics methods, and the cause of the sudden disease
expansion may be inferred using molecular ecological
studies.
To develop plans for protection against oak wilt, it is
necessary to understand the process by which the vector
beetles spread the disease. Temporal and spatial patterns
of P. quercivorus infestations have suggested that the
damage spreads from an epicentre to surrounding trees
[7]. The majority of disease dispersal is found within the
small migration range of the vector; however, damaged
areas more than 10 km apart have suddenly emerged [14].
For example, in 2005, Nagano Prefecture reported that
after gradual diffusion from the northern region of the
prefecture, damaged Q. serrata was found 100 km south
of the original infestation [15]. It is unclear whether the
expansion of the disease is accomplished by colonisation
of the vector beetles. There is increasing interest in adopting new technology to estimate dispersal because the
movement of organisms from one location to another is
integral to the study of evolutionary and ecological
dynamics. Genetic markers are valuable tools for analysing
the dispersal abilities and mechanisms, and provide an
alternative to mark-and-recapture methods (e.g., [16]).
Areas of ongoing gene flow are often deduced to describe
and interpret patterns of genetic structure. Microsatellite
markers in particular exhibit high resolution and are suitable for studying genetic structuring and deducing the
ongoing dispersal of pests [17,18]. We used microsatellite
markers to map the spatial and temporal population structure of P. quercivorus in areas damaged by oak wilt disease.
We investigated the dispersal of P. quercivorus among
populations to thereby gain an understanding of the
expansion mechanisms of the disease.

Methods
suggested that global climate change has pushed the beetle’s distribution northward such that it is now attacking
Q. crispula, which is a typical species of northern cooltemperate forests in Japan. In addition, oak wilt is less
damaging to Quercus serrata Thunb. ex Murray, which is
more common in southern areas, than to Q. crispula
[12]. Kamata et al. [13] questioned whether fungus, vector and host species are in evolutionary equilibrium to
test the invasive species hypothesis. It is possible that
Q. crispula is more susceptible to the disease because of
a lack of history of co-evolution between the host and
the vector species. Kobayashi and Ueda [14] predicted
that changes in the management of oak forests are the

Sampling

In 2005 and 2007, individual beetles were sampled from
14 sites (Table 1, Figure 1). Adult P. quercivorus individuals emerge from the trunk of the oak tree and disperse during the summer. We collected adult specimens
using an aggregation pheromone [19] and a trap with
cross barriers and propylene glycol basins (Sankei). In
some newly damaged areas, individuals were collected
directly from injured wood or weakened trunks due to
the difficulty of trapping flying adults. Samples were collected from damaged areas 0-5 years after the first
appearance of oak wilt (Table 1). Site 10 (TRL) represented a population from an area exhibiting newly

emergent damage with no reported oak wilt in neighbouring sites. Site 11 (TRT) comprised a population in
which no wilting trees were found, and was in close
proximity to site 10 (TRL). In Sakae (site 8; SKE), both
the flying adults and adults emerging from trunks were
collected. All samples were preserved in 99.5% ethanol
at -20 or 4°C until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping

In total, 20-154 individuals were examined per site
(Table 1). Total DNA was extracted using PrepMan
reagent (Applied Biosystems) or the Chelex method [20]
with some modifications [21]. Five microsatellite loci
were examined: Pq3003, Pq3313, Pq3422, Pq3423 and
Pq3469 [22]. One primer of each primer set (typically
the forward primer) was end-labelled with NED
(Pq3422, Pq3423), FAM (Pq3003, Pq3469) or HEX
(Pq3313) fluorescent dye. The polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed in 8- μl volumes with one-fifth
volume of the 5 × PCR buffer Ampdirect containing
Mg2+ (Shimadzu Biotech) or one-tenth volume of the 10
× PCR buffer supplied with Ex Taq, 160 μM of each
dNTP, 0.4 unit of TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa), 40 ng of
fluorescently labelled primer, 40 ng of the corresponding
primer (Applied Biosystems) and genomic DNA.
Because the primer pairs Pq3469, Pq3423 and Pq3313
are suitable for multiplex PCR, they were added to one
tube with 1/3 concentrates of the mixture described
above. Amplification was performed as follows: 94°C for
2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for
30 s and 72°C for 45 s. For multiplex loading, 0.5 μl of
each PCR product and 0.5 μl of GeneScan 400HD
[ROX] Standard (Applied Biosystems) were added to 12

μl of deionised formamide. The products were separated
using capillary electrophoresis (ABI PRISM 310; Applied
Biosystems) and assigned scores using 310 GeneScan
software (Applied Biosystems) and by eye.
Data analysis

Micro-Checker v. 2.2.3 [23,24] was used to check microsatellite data for scoring errors and null alleles. Fundamental
genetic parameters were calculated over all loci using the
programme POPGENE v. 1.31 [25]. Observed (HO) and
expected heterozygosities (HE) were calculated to quantify
the genetic diversity of each population. Allelic richness
(A; [26]) was estimated using a fixed sample size of 20.
Putative linkage disequilibrium was assessed between all
pairs of loci for each population using GENEPOP [27],
and the significance of the P value was corrected using
the sequential Bonferroni procedure [28]. F statistics were
studied with FSTAT v. 2.9.3 [29], estimated FIS and FST
[30] to test for local inbreeding within populations and differentiation between populations. The significance of
deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within
population was tested by randomisation. The significance
of the population differentiation was tested assuming
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within populations by the
permutation test. The genetic diversity and genetic components were compared between trap-collected and
trunk-collected samples in Sakae using the indices above.
The post hoc test was adjusted using the sequential
Bonferroni procedure [28]. Since the absolute values of
the population differentiation parameter FST depend on
the level of genetic variations in the examined material,
standardised values of G’ ST [31], which always range
from 0 to 1, were also calculated using averaged values of

Shoda-Kagaya et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:21

intra-population gene diversity (HS), total gene diversity
(HT) and the GST values calculated by SMOGD [32]. BOTTLENECK v. 1. 2. 02 [33] was used to detect recent bottlenecks under the assumptions of the infinite allele mutation
model (IAM), and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was
applied. Severe reductions in population size were inferred
from comparisons between the expected equilibrium gene
diversity (HE) and the observed numbers of alleles.
An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed using the programme ARLEQUIN v. 3.01 [34]
to test for a geographical structure effect. An AMOVA
was also used to partition the genetic variance among
groups, among populations within groups and within
populations. Groups were defined as individuals collected in the same year. Upon conducting the AMOVA,
FST was used to quantify the degree of population differentiation. The significance of any differentiation was
tested using a permutation method with 10,000 replications. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) based on Nei’s
genetic distances DA [35] calculated using Populations
1.2.30 [36] was used to explore the relationship between
geographical site and genetic differentiation. MDS was
performed using the programme SYSTAT v. 9.01 [37].
Multidimensional scaling operates directly on dissimilarities; therefore, no assumptions about statistical distribution were necessary [37]. This avoided the distortions
seen in classical scaling methods, which assume a linear
relationship between values (e.g., principal co-ordinates
analysis PCoA) [38]. The fit of the data in two dimensions was measured by the stress factor. A spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA, [39]) algorithm
was used to define the population configuration. Given
the number of groups (K), the population configuration
with the highest differentiation among groups (FCT) was
calculated using a simulated annealing procedure by
SAMOVA 1.0 [39]. K was set between 2 and 9 with 500
independent simulated annealing processes, and the
optimum number of population groups for a set of sample populations was estimated by exploring the behaviour of the index F CT for different values of K.
Clustering of the populations was assessed by generating
a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based on the DA genetic
distance using Populations with a bootstrapping test.
“Isolation by distance” (IBD) was tested as the correlation between genetic and geographical distance, using all
population pairs to estimate the regression of FST/(1 FST) on a logarithm of distance for populations, as suggested by Rousset [40]. The relationship between genetic
differentiation and geographic distance was assessed by
the Mantel test [41], with 9,999 randomisations using
GenAlEx 6.2 [42]. This test was done for total populations as well as populations collected in same year (2005
and 2007). The reasoning for the latter analysis is discussed in the Results.

To assess the level of population structure and assignment of an individual’s origin, an individual-based clustering was performed using the programme STRUCTURE
v. 2.3.1 [43]. F statistics and AMOVA tests used the sample location as the unit of comparison, whereas the Bayesian model-based methods of STRUCTURE used the
individual as the unit, assigning it to the most likely group
(cluster). Each individual genotype was used to estimate
the proportion of admixture from several demes in an
individual’s nuclear genome. Five independent runs for
each K were used, with burn-ins of 20,000 replicates and
run lengths of 10,000 replicates. An allele frequency correlated model (F model; [44]) and an admixture model were
adopted. STRUCTURE v. 2. 3. 1 is also able to make explicit use of sampling location information to provide accurate inferences [45], and the LOCPRIOR model was used.
The likelihood of the assignments was evaluated for K
varying from 1 to 9, and the reliability of the K clusters
was tested for these values and variances among the trials;
ΔK was also used to assess the true K number [46]. In the
F model, all K clusters are assumed to be diverged from a
common ancestral population at the same time, but the
model allows the possibility that the clusters may have
experienced different degrees of drift since the divergence
event to be considered [47]. In this model, the amount of
drift for each cluster from a common ancestral population
is described as ‘F’, values of which are analogous to traditional FST values between clusters and a common ancestral population [44]. Then, F for each cluster can be used
as an indicator of genetic drift and/or bottleneck in the
long term [44,47]. F was assessed for each K to search for
bottlenecks in the long term.

Results
Allele polymorphisms and genotypic linkage

We were able to successfully genotype 605 individuals
from 14 sampling sites using all five loci. No null alleles
or scoring errors were detected by Micro-Checker. The
number of alleles varied from 8 (Pq3422) to 16 (Pq3423),
with an average of 12.4 alleles per locus. Nine of 150
tests [between Pq3003 and Pq3313 in 1 (NKH); Pq3313
and Pq3469, and Pq3422 and Pq3423 in 9 (SNN); Pq3313
and Pq3423, Pq3313 and Pq3469, and Pq3423 and
Pq3469 in 10 (TRL); Pq3313 and Pq3469, Pq3422 and
Pq3469, and Pq3422 and Pq3423 in 11 (TRT); P < 0.05]
showed significant linkage disequilibrium after correcting
for multiple tests.
Genetic diversity and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within
populations and detection of bottleneck populations

The mean expected heterozygosity (H E ) for all loci
varied from 0.594 to 0.741 (Table 2). For most populations, the expected and observed heterozygosities were
similar and F IS values were not significantly different

from 0, except for population 1 (NKH; P < 0.001). The
mean number of alleles (Ā) within populations ranged
from 4.6 to 7.2. Beetles emerging from trunks and beetles collected using the pheromone trap were similar in
their genetic diversity at site 8 (SKE), and no genetic differences were detected between them (FST = -0.0018, P
= 0.59429). Thus, we combined the data for site 8 (SKE)
for further analyses.
Recent genetic bottlenecks were detected within sites
1 (NKH), 5 (BDU), 6 (TMG), 8 (SKE), 11 (TRT), and 12
(NGY; Table 2). Populations showing significant recent
bottlenecks were distributed throughout north-eastern
and south-western populations; however, they were all
from newly emerged oak wilt forests for which the first
damage occurred within the 2 years prior to sampling.
Population differentiations

Moderate population differentiations were found (FST =
0.047 ± 0.002, G’ST = 0.167 ± 0.001; P < 0.001). Pairwise
F ST estimations are shown in Table 3. The AMOVA
showed that the variance within populations explained
95.3% of the total variance; 4.7% was expressed among
populations and the overall population differentiation was
significant (P < 0.001). The hierarchical AMOVA indicated that the effect of collection year was marginally
significant and the collection site effect was significant
(Table 4). The MDS resulted in a stress of the final configuration of 0.084 and explained 96.6% of the variance
(Figure 2). The MDS also demonstrated that populations
from the south-western region [10 (TRL), 11 (TRT), 12
(NGY), 13 (ODN) and 14 (MMD)] are genetically diverged
from populations in the north-eastern region [1 (NKH), 2

(YUZ), 3 (SAK), 4 (TOK), 5 (BDU), 6 (TMG), 7 (OMY), 8
(SKE) and 9 (SNN)]. Two major groups were detected
within the north-eastern populations, mostly corresponding to differences in the year of collection (2005 and
2007). The SAMOVA showed that when the number of
groups of populations (K) increased, the value of F CT
increased (Figure 3). From K = 2 to 5, FCT increased sharply and then began to level off. Thus, we used K = 2-5 for
interpreting the grouping patterns. The first level of divergence defined two groups, 12 (NGY) and others. When K
= 3, population 12 (NGY) and the Tenryu populations, 10
(TRL) and 11 (TRT), are considered to be different groups
from the others. In addition, the increase in K substantially
increased the FCT. Four clusters were revealed as follows:
cluster 1 included 1 (NKH), 6 (TMG), 7 (OMY), 8 (SKE)
and 9 (SNN); cluster 2 included 2 (YUZ), 3 (SAK), 4
(TOK) and 5 (BDU); cluster 3 included 10 (TRL) and 11
(TRT); and cluster 4 included 10 (NGY), 13 (ODN) and
14 (MMD). Cluster 1 comprises populations distributed in
the north-eastern region that were collected in 2007 with
the exception of 9 (SNN). Cluster 2 is composed of the
2005 collections, and the distribution of cluster 2 overlaps
that of cluster 1. Clusters 3 and 4 are composed of populations from the south-western regions. When K = 5, cluster
4 is split in two: one contains10 (NGY) and the other contains 13 (ODN) and 14 (MMD). The clustering of K = 4
and K = 5 was supported with high bootstrap values in the
NJ tree using Nei’s DA (Figure 4). When K = 4, two major
groups were detected corresponding to clusters 1 and 2
and clusters 3 and 4, supported with 88% and 93% bootstrapping values for clusters 1 and 2, respectively, and by
92% and 60% for clusters 3 and 4. Populations from Kyoto

Prefecture [13 (ODN) and 14 (MMD)] exhibited similar
genetic components supported by an 83% bootstrapping
value in cluster 4.
The Mantel test showed that the between-population
differentiation increased significantly with geographical
distance (r = 0.520, P < 0.001), as illustrated in Fig 5, suggesting a model of IBD. Given that in north-eastern
populations, genetic change was detected between the
two collection years (2005 and 2007), the IBD was tested
separately for each year. Significant IBD was confirmed
for each test (2005, r = 0.714, P < 0.001; 2007, r = 0.495,
P = 0.001). In addition, the IBD within north-eastern
populations in the 2005 collection [2 (YUZ), 3 (SAK), 4
(TOK), 5 (BDU) and 9 (SNN)] was tested to eliminate
any effects of differentiation between the north-eastern
and south-western populations and the collection year.
IBD was also detected in the north-eastern populations
for the 2005 collection (r = 0.861, P = 0.046).
Individual-based clustering

The Bayesian clustering analysis conducted using
STRUCTURE showed substantial genetic structuring
for P. quercivorus. The likelihood of assignment, ln P
(D), increased from K = 1 to 7 (Figure 6). It then fluctuated, and the highest value was obtained at K = 9.
The standard deviation of this value for each iteration
increased with the value of K, and was very high when
K > 5. The highest ΔK was found at K = 2, whereas it

decreased to almost 0 when K = 5 (Figure 6). Therefore, the consistency of the result was unclear from
K = 5. Because adding a cluster from K = 5-6 did not
provide much more information regarding the genetic
structuring (Figure 7), assignment results were interpreted for K = 2-5. Populations were clearly divided
into north-eastern and south-western clusters when
K = 2, and there appeared to be few migrant individuals. When K = 3, the north-eastern cluster was partitioned and most populations exhibited some
admixturing, with the exception of 1 (NKH). This partition corresponded to the subgrouping shown in the
SAMOVA and NJ analyses. Populations in Tenryu [10
(TNL), 11 (TNT)] were divided from the south-western cluster when K = 4. Population 12 (NGY) and
populations in the Kyoto prefecture [13 (ODN) and 14
(MMD)] were discriminated when K = 5. These partitionings were also consistent with those of the
SAMOVA and NJ tree analyses. Higher F values were
exhibited in the north-eastern clusters when K = 2-5
(Figure 7).

Discussion
Genetic diversity and population bottleneck

Our data indicate that high genetic diversity exists within
populations regardless of the location or collection
method. When samples from population 8 (SKE) were
compared for their genetic diversity and components, the

collection method (trapping flying adults or direct collection from trunks) had little effect on the overall results.
Because no null alleles were detected, all of the genotyped data were considered useful for the analysis.
A bottleneck was detected in some populations from
recently infested forests. Since there was no damage,
these individuals may have originated as a small number
of colonisers, which would have entailed a founder
effect. If they were not colonisers, they may have been
residents, in which case sudden changes in the availability of resources might have resulted in fluctuations in
the population size of the beetle in damaged oak forests.
Linkage disequilibrium was also detected in recently
infested forest area populations. The lack of linkage disequilibrium in most populations suggests that the loci
used may not be in close proximity to one another on
the chromosomes. Population bottlenecks and/or

groups of P. quercivorus in Japan. These are divided into
north-eastern and south-western populations. Using
chloroplast DNA, Okaura et al. [48] examined the phylogeography of Q. crispula and three related species,

which are the main hosts of P. quercivorus. Quang et al.
[49,50] showed nucleotide functional gene variation in
Q. crispula and inferred its history of colonisation into
Japan. These studies showed that a genetic boundary for
Q. crispula was found between the north-eastern and
south-western populations and coincides with the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line, a major tectonic depression that runs through Nagano Prefecture and separates
sites 1 (NKH) through 9 (SNN) from 10 (TRL) through
14 (MMD). Given that the beetles exhibited the same
pattern of genetic differentiation between the eastern
and western populations, it is possible that they share a
population history with Quercus species.
A change in the vegetation distribution would likely
affect the beetle’s genetic structuring in evolutionary
timescales. Kamata et al. [7] predicted that P. quercivorus expanded its distribution northward and upward
in elevation, and that the lack of co-evolution between
Q. crispula and the beetle had an influence on the
damage that incurred. They further proposed that a
recent warmer climate has altered the distribution of
P. quercivorus such that they encountered Q. crispula,

which is lacking in defence systems against the disease.
Given that the genetic structuring of P. quercivorus suggests that the species became established in accordance
with the vegetation history on a regional scale, it is difficult to support Kamata et al.’s hypothesis [7] for the
main cause of oak wilt expansion in entire regions.
Although the genetic structures of the hosts and vectors
coincide, the hypothesis that individuals from different
origins invaded Japan and caused population structuring
divided by the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line by
chance cannot be rejected. Further details of the population history of the beetles may be elucidated by additional phylogenetic analysis using individuals from
outside Japan.
A rapid expansion of species distribution often entails a
lack of geographical structuring [2,51]. The beetle populations that are damaging Q. crispula in north-eastern
areas are not considered exclusively invasive populations
because IBD was detected within the north-eastern populations. According to Rousset [40], most populations are
thought to be in genetic equilibrium between genetic
drift and gene flow. However, we identified a single
population that may be composed of migrants. Specifically, the population at site 1 (NKH), which represents
the northern limit of oak wilt in 2007, exhibited inbreeding, and an analysis using the STRUCTURE programme
predicted that the population was a result of admixturing
of two groups. Therefore, the damage at site 1 (NKH)
may have been caused by non-local individuals from various source populations.
There was no visible damage near site 10 (TRL), and it
was not clear whether the beetles therein that attacked
Q. serrata were endemic or migrant. Adults were caught
by trapping within site 11 (TRT), and there was no oak
wilt. Site 11 (TRT) is near to site 10 (TRL). Beetle populations from sites 11 (TRT) and 10 (TRL) showed similar
genetic compositions with high genetic diversity. Therefore, they may not represent descendants of long-distance
dispersers from severely damaged areas, and may instead
be endemic populations. The beetle populations within
sites 10 (TRL) and 11 (TRT) must have persisted without
a break.
Population expansion and migration of P. quercivorus

The NJ, SAMOVA and clustering by STRUCTURE analyses indicated that within the north-eastern populations, genetic components were substituted between
2005 and 2007. Because IBD was detected among northeastern populations in 2005, most of the migration
should be limited to neighbourhoods. This substitution
may have been attained by gradual expansion of population distributions and mixing of population structures
prior to the emergence of oak wilt damage. The migration of the beetles among populations might be

Page 9 of 11

enhanced by increased oak wilt damage. Therefore, samples collected in 2007 in north-eastern regions may contain individuals from broader areas. Although the
beetles may seldom disperse long distances beyond a
regional scale, migration within a regional scale may be
frequent.
Chapuis et al. [18] examined population outbreak
effects using the locust Locusta migratoria. They showed
that population outbreaks reduce population differentiation by enhancing migration and/or effective population
sizes. Thus, an increased P. quercivorus population size
might alter the population structure in a similar manner
to that seen with L. migratoria. Our STRUCTURE analysis produced an F value that indicated a high value for
clustering of individuals in north-eastern populations
mostly collected in 2005 when K = 3. However, the F
value decreased in the 2007 collection cluster. This
result indicates that the north-eastern population collected in 2005 was influenced by strong genetic drift
after divergence from the common ancestral population,
and that the effective population size is small. By incorporating independent demes, outbreak populations from
2005 to 2007 might have made the effective population
sizes larger.
Implications for developing protection plans against
oak wilt

The genetic structure of the beetles supported Kobayashi
and Ueda’s prediction [14] that changes in the management of oak forests are the main cause of the increase in
oak wilt. Although migrant beetles might occasionally
produce new areas of oak wilt damage, our analysis of
the genetic structuring of the vector beetle populations
indicated that the invasion of the beetle via long-distance
dispersal into non-endemic areas or distribution change
above regional scale may not be the main cause of oak
wilt expansion. Outbreak populations might have
enhanced migration on a small scale, and beetles in
neighbouring populations may have encouraged such
activity. Population outbreaks may also have led to mass
attacks on host trees in neighbouring forests, thus establishing new damaged areas. The sequence of activation of
the beetle might have promoted disastrous oak wilt.
To prevent the expansion of the disease to undamaged
areas, it is important to manage beetle populations to
maintain low densities and thus stopping the sequence
of activation. Therefore, we need to trap beetles and/or
monitor oak wilt damage to provide an indication of the
population density of the beetles in continuous oak forests. Once damage is confirmed, the health of the oak
forest can be maintained if immediate action is taken
before Allee effects (in which the growth rate of sparse
populations increases with increasing population density;
[52]) become severe. In particular, in mature oak forests

Shoda-Kagaya et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/21

composed of plenty of large-diameter trees, vast numbers of beetles can emerge from a few wilted oaks [53].
We must monitor oak forests that have been abandoned
for a long time and are full of large trees with caution,
so as not to release pests to nearby forests. Further studies of the dispersal dynamics of the beetles, such as frequency and distance of adult flight, are needed to
generate alert systems for oak wilt expansion.

Conclusions
We found genetic differentiation in the ambrosia beetle
P. quercivorus, which corresponds to the genetic structuring of the host oak trees. Based on a combination of
methods of statistical analysis, the genetic structure is
presented with a high degree of confidence. The geographical structuring of the beetle was thought to be
formed by co-evolution with its host species.
