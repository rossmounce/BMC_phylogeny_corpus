Abstract
Background: The distribution of isoelectric point (pI) of proteins in a proteome is universal for all organisms. It is
bimodal dividing the proteome into two sets of acidic and basic proteins. Different species however have different
abundance of acidic and basic proteins that may be correlated with taxonomy, subcellular localization, ecological niche
of organisms and proteome size.
Results: We have analysed 1784 proteomes encoded by chromosomes of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and also
mitochondria, plastids, prokaryotic plasmids, phages and viruses. We have found significant correlation in more than 95%
of proteomes between the protein length and pI in proteomes – positive for acidic proteins and negative for the basic
ones. Plastids, viruses and plasmids encode more basic proteomes while chromosomes of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota,
mitochondria and phages more acidic ones. Mitochondrial proteomes of Viridiplantae, Protista and Fungi are more basic
than Metazoa. It results from the presence of basic proteins in the former proteomes and their absence from the latter
ones and is related with reduction of metazoan genomes. Significant correlation was found between the pI bias of
proteomes encoded by prokaryotic chromosomes and proteomes encoded by plasmids but there is no correlation
between eukaryotic nuclear-coded proteomes and proteomes encoded by organelles. Detailed analyses of prokaryotic
proteomes showed significant relationships between pI distribution and habitat, relation to the host cell and salinity of
the environment, but no significant correlation with oxygen and temperature requirements. The salinity is positively
correlated with acidicity of proteomes. Host-associated organisms and especially intracellular species have more basic
proteomes than free-living ones. The higher rate of mutations accumulation in the intracellular parasites and
endosymbionts is responsible for the basicity of their tiny proteomes that explains the observed positive correlation
between the decrease of genome size and the increase of basicity of proteomes. The results indicate that even conserved
proteins subjected to strong selectional constraints follow the global trend in the pI distribution.
Conclusion: The distribution of pI of proteins in proteomes shows clear relationships with length of proteins,
subcellular localization, taxonomy and ecology of organisms. The distribution is also strongly affected by mutational
pressure especially in intracellular organisms.

Background
The abundance of genomic data allows for answering
questions concerning the whole genomes' or proteomes'
structure and evolution. One of the most intriguing recent
findings is the distribution of isoelectric point (pI) of proteins in the whole proteomes. So called virtual 2D gels
(i.e. plots where pI of proteins is plotted against their
molecular weight) seem to be universal – in all proteomes
they are usually bimodal with very low fractions of proteins with pI close to 7.4 [1-8]. More detailed analyses
have shown that the distribution is connected with specific properties of basic and acidic residues of amino acids
and combinations of their pK values. The probability of
constructing a protein with pI close to 7.4 of naturally
occurring amino acids is low. This is in agreement with
expectations because proteins are most insoluble, least
reactive and unstable in pH close to their pI, and pH of the
majority of the cell interior compartments is close to 7.5
[5,9]. Thus, this property of proteomes could be the result
of selection at the very early steps of evolution.
Different relationships between pI and other phenomena
were discovered. Schwartz et al. [6] observed the correlation between the trimodal distribution of pI and the subcellular localization of proteins. Knight et al. [7]
characterized more than 100 prokaryotic and eukaryotic
proteomes by virtual 2D-gels and observed very little or
no relations to phylogeny while significant relationship
existed with the ecological niche of organisms. Moreover,
they found a negative correlation between proteome size
and basicity for the smallest and the most basic proteomes. Also very well documented has been the shift of
pI distribution toward acidicity in halophilic bacteria
which is probably related to their adaptation to high salt
environments [10-12]. Similarly, it has been assumed that
the basic proteomes of Coxiella burnetti and Helicobacter
pylori are connected with an adaptation to acidic environment [13] and the basic proteomes of some Archaea are
an adaptation to high temperature [14]. On the other
hand, Nandi et al. [15] have focused on an evolutionary
approach and found that the molecular weight of proteins
is a much more conserved feature than their pI value. They
concluded that a lot of orthologous proteins change their
pI between acidic and basic and only a few stay exclusively
acidic or basic in different organisms. Furthermore,
Schwartz et al. [6] and Knight et al. [7] found that membrane proteins are larger and more basic than non-membrane ones whereas Nandi et al. [15] found that many
orthologous membrane proteins have very variable pI values and may be used as markers to predict the organism's
ecological niche.
In this paper we have broadened our analysis to proteomes of organelles, viruses and bacteriophages and
applied different methods and parameters to describe

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/163

quantitatively the pI distribution of proteomes. One of
the aims of these studies is uncovering the relationship
between the pI and the protein length. In the previous
analyses, such correlations even if existing, were
neglected. Furthermore, we have analysed the relations
between the pI distributions of proteomes and the taxonomy and ecology of corresponding organisms considering
different taxonomical levels and ecological signatures
such as habitat, relation to the host cell, salinity, oxygen
and temperature requirements. Moreover, we have tried to
explain the observed relationship between the proteome
size and the pI distribution of proteomes [7].

Results and Discussion
General properties of isoelectric point distributions in
proteomes
Some examples of the distributions of isoelectric points of
proteins coded by selected proteomes are shown in Fig. 1
(for more proteomes see additional data files 2, 3 and 4).
All analysed proteomes show usually bimodal distributions with a smaller third peak between two main peaks,
which are in agreement with the results of other authors
[7,8] and suggestions that the multimodal distribution of
pI corresponds to the pK values of amino acid moieties
[8,14].

To simplify comparative analyses of the pI distribution of
different proteomes, we have divided the whole sets of
proteins into two sets called later the acidic and basic sets.
The division point corresponds to the pI value for which
the pI distribution reaches the minimum between acidic
and basic sets (see the Methods section for details). For
most of proteomes the division point was between 7.4
and 7.5. The distribution of the values of division points
is very narrow – the range is 7.22 – 7.54 with the average
and median 7.41. We have not found any correlation
between the pH of these points and the taxonomical or
ecological classification of organisms and genome sizes.
The universality of the pH value of the minimum in pI distributions supports the conclusion of other authors that
the bimodal distribution of pI results from intrinsic chemical properties of amino acids [8].
For each proteome we have calculated the average pI separately for the basic and the acidic sets of proteins, the
average length of proteins and the pI bias (see the Methods section). The pI bias simply describes the asymmetry
of the bimodal distribution of pI (Fig. 1). It ranges from 100% to 100%. These two extreme values indicate that all
proteins in a given proteome are acidic or basic, respectively. Value close to zero means that a given proteome
has a similar fraction of acidic and basic proteins. We have
found that if a proteome has more acidic proteins, the
average pI of proteins of the acidic set is lower and the
relationship is statistically significant (correlation coeffi-

cient, r = 0.76, p < 0.001) – additional data file 5A. On the
other hand, if the basic proteins prevail in the proteome it
is not connected with the shift of average pI value of basic
proteins with exception of some intracellular microorganisms (additional data file 5B). We have also found that the
basic sets have greater variance of their pI than the acidic
sets that indicates greater diversity of the basic proteins.
Relationships between pI value and size of proteins
The 2D virtual distribution of proteins shows a characteristic pattern that may resemble a "butterfly" [7] or "lungs",
and no correlation has been observed between pI and the
molecular weight of proteins. Nandi et al. [15] have found
that molecular weight of proteins is a much more conserved feature than their pI which would additionally suggest that there should be no correlation between pI and
molecular weight. However, after dividing proteomes into
acidic and basic sets, the correlation between the pI and
the size of proteins for many proteomes can be seen – positive for acidic proteins and negative for basic proteins
(Fig. 1). Although the correlation coefficient is not very
high, for more than 92% of acidic sets and almost 99% of
basic sets of chromosome-encoded proteomes of Archaea,
Bacteria and Eukaryota it is statistically significant with
Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p < 0.05. Furthermore, the
correlation between the size and pI of proteins is a general
feature with very narrow distributions of the correlation
coefficients (shown in Fig. 2 separately for acidic and basic
proteins).

To show that these correlations are intrinsic properties of
proteomes, we have created three artificial proteomes consisting of randomly generated proteins characterized by:
(i) the average amino acid composition of E. coli proteins
and the length of the real E. coli proteins; (ii) equal frequencies of amino acids and the length of the real E. coli
proteins; (iii) the average amino acid composition of the
E. coli proteins and the uniform length distribution in the
range of the E. coli proteins. (See additional data file 6 for
distributions of pI and relationships between length of
proteins and their pI for these proteomes.) The generation
of artificial proteomes was repeated 100 times for each set.
In each case we got significant correlations between length
and pI values (Tab. 1). Each version of artificial proteomes
produced the bimodal distribution of pI and stronger correlations between the pI and the length of proteins than in
the real E. coli proteome. The pI bias of the real proteome
does not fall within the range of pI values of generated
proteomes and is nearest to the generated proteomes
assuming the average amino acid composition and the
length of the real E. coli proteins. The pI bias was more
balanced when proteins were generated from the uniform
amino acids distribution, however still without proteins
with pI close to 7.4. In addition, the proteome became
more acidic when the length of proteins corresponded to

the uniform distribution. It suggests that selection for the
length of proteins may shape the pI distribution to some
extent.
The results mean that the longer proteins can maintain
the neutral or nearly neutral pI whereas the most extreme
pI values are specific for shorter proteins. It probably
results from purely statistical reasons. The shorter proteins
show higher fluctuation of amino acid composition,
which strongly influences their pI – incorporation of even
one charged residue shifts significantly the protein pI to
the lower or higher value. On the other hand, long proteins, usually composed of more charged amino acids
much better buffer the effect of fluctuation in their composition and can keep their pI even close to 7.4. This 'statistical' explanation of the relationship between proteins
size and pI does not exclude the possibility that this relation may have some biological consequences in a diversification of proteins' structure and function. For example,
if there exists a selection constraint to generate a very
acidic or very basic protein, the easiest way to accomplish
that is "to make" it short. Actually, very basic proteins
interacting with nucleic acids – ribosomal proteins – are
usually very short. We think that more proteins subjected
to such selection should be found. These proteins may
belong to specific regulatory proteins, transcriptional factors, modulators, signalling proteins, small proteins interacting with other proteins etc.

Each of the first three proteomes was generated 100 times and the resulting correlation coefficients and the pI bias were averaged over 100 values.
Correlation coefficients both for all generated artificial proteomes and the real proteome are statistically significant with p < 0.001.

We have also noticed a difference in the length of acidic
and basic proteins. The comparative analyses have shown
that acidic proteins are significantly longer than basic
ones (t-Student test, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p <
0.05) in more than 95% of Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota proteomes. The acidic proteins are on average 73 and
107 amino acid residues longer than the basic ones in the
case of Prokaryota and Eukaryota, respectively. Probably it
is connected with the presence of very short ribosomal
proteins in the basic set and long aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the acidic one [15].
Nandi et al. [15] observed that the size of orthologous
proteins found in closely related organisms is much more
conserved than their pI. We compared the length of
orthologous proteins of many proteomes whose pI values
were changed from acidic to basic or vice versa but we did
not observe any statistically significant differences in the
length of these proteins, either. We found that the change
of pI did not depend on the length of the compared
orthologs.
Relationships between pI values of proteomes and
taxonomy
In the analysis of potential relationships between pI of
proteomes and taxonomy we have used the pI bias that is
quite concise but a very informative parameter emphasising the most distinct and basic differences in the pI distributions. Fig. 3 shows the result of statistical analysis of the
pI bias of different groups of proteomes and the UPGMA
dendrogram classifying the different groups of proteomes
according to the median of the pI bias. The analysis allows
for dividing proteomes into at least two groups: (1) the
more basic proteomes coded by plastids, viruses and plasmids and (2) the more acidic proteomes of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, mitochondria and phages. This division
is supported by 95% (subsampling method), WLS-LRT
and F-test (both p < 0.001). Moreover, every comparison
between members classified to these different groups
made by Kruskal-Wallis test is statistically significant (p <
0.002). Within the acidic group it is possible to recognize

some subgroups according to the high percentage support: Eukaryota with mitochondria and Bacteria with
phages. The clade containing Prokaryota and phages is
rather weakly supported by subsampling analysis but it is
very significant according to WLS-LRT and F-test (for both
p < 0.001). The observed basicity of plastid, viral and plasmid proteomes is probably connected with the prevalence
of basic proteins (e.g. ribosomal in the case of plastids and
basic proteins interacting with nucleic acids in the case of
viruses) and it may also result from higher rate of accumulation of mutations, especially in viruses and plasmids
(see the section 'Relation between pI value of proteomes,
their sizes and GC content of genomes' for similar a explanation for intracellular bacteria).
Our analyses of prokaryotic proteomes performed on the
lower taxonomical level did not show any relation
between the pI bias and phylogeny, which is in agreement
with the results of Knight et al. [7]. Many monophyletic or
closely related groups (e.g. taxa of Archaea or proteobacteria) were not grouped when the pI bias was used as a criterion. It indicates that the pI distribution has not been
conserved during evolution of prokaryotes. We did not
observe such a relationship for eukaryotic proteomes,
either.
On the other hand, we have found an interesting grouping
related to a phylogenetic signal when analysing mitochondrial proteomes, which are much smaller and more
conserved according to their protein content than large
chromosome-encoded proteomes (Fig. 4, see also Tab. 2).
The analysed groups of proteomes clearly divide into two
subgroups: Viridiplantae+Protista and Fungi+Metazoa.
This division is strongly supported in 100%, WLS-LRT and
F-test (for both p < 0.001). It is in agreement with the
opinion that the clade of Fungi+Metazoa called
Opisthokonta is a well-established group, which is supported by many molecular data analyses [16,17]. Furthermore, the two subgroups of Metazoa: Chordata and nonChordata (including the most of phyla of invertebrates)
form a well-supported clade (97%; WLS-LRT and F-test:

tral or even acidic (for Fungi). We did not find any
relationship between the pI bias and phylogeny on lower
taxonomic levels: among metazoan phyla and subgroups
of Craniata when analysing both full proteomes and proteomes containing only the 12 common proteins.

The observed phylogenetic signal in the pI bias is probably the result of different composition of proteomes.
Mitochondrial proteomes of Viridiplantae, Protista and
Fungi are usually several times larger than Metazoa proteomes that contain usually 12–13 proteins. Actually, the
most of proteins (e.g. ribosomal proteins) that are absent
from Metazoa but present in Viridiplantae, Protista and
Fungi are very basic (additional data file 7). Therefore,
when we performed the same analysis based on the proteomes consisting only of 12 proteins present in the most
of mitochondrial proteomes the phylogenetic signal disappeared and the pI bias of basic proteomes became neu-

Similarly to Knight et al. [7] but analysing a larger set of
proteomes, we have found significant correlation between
the pI bias of proteomes coded by prokaryotic genomes
and their plasmids (N = 63, r = 0.74, p < 0.001). There is
no such correlation between the pI bias of eukaryotic
nuclear-coded proteomes and proteomes of their
organelles (N = 36, r = 0.04, p = 0.81). We have obtained
similar results when analysing the average pI values of
acidic and basic sets separately and no correlation was
found in these two cases when the average length of proteins in these two sets was studied. It seems that organelle
genomes are more independent than plasmids to follow

the genomic trends in pI, which seems to be not true for
plasmids. For example, the organelles are separated by
two membranes and posses their own replicational, transcriptional and translational machinery. Plasmids code
generally for more basic proteins than chromosomes but
a mutational pressure or some selection constraints affect
these two proteomes simultaneously and gene transfer
between plasmids and chromosomes occurs probably
more often than between organellar and nuclear
genomes. If more data are available, it would be interesting to analyze such relationships between viral or phagal
proteomes and proteomes of infected organisms.
Relationships between pI values and subcellular
localization of proteins
The analysed mitochondrial and plastid proteomes
include only proteins coded by the organellar genomes.
However, there are many proteins encoded by nuclear
genes, which are targeted to the organelles. The nuclearencoded organellar proteins are usually equipped with Nterminal targeting signals (transit peptides) responsible
for their import into organelles. These peptides are
cleaved off by organellar peptidases after the proteins are
transported. Because these presequences are rich in basic
amino acid residues, the pI of premature unprocessed proteins (i.e. the whole sequences) should be more basic than
the pI of mature proteins (i.e. without transit peptide). In
the Tab. 2 we have compared the pI bias of the premature
and mature proteins with proteomes coded by organellar
genomes. Because mitochondrial proteomes differ
between various taxonomical groups, we analysed them
separately. (See additional data file 8 for distributions of
pI and relationships between length of proteins and their
pI for these proteomes.) As it was expected, the presence
of very basic transit peptides (pI bias 93 – 100%) in the
premature proteins shifts the pI distribution of these proteins towards basicity (i.e. higher values of pI bias),
whereas most mature proteins are acidic. Interestingly,
only in plastid and mitochondrial proteomes of plants a
weak surplus of acidic premature proteins still exists. The
nuclear-encoded organellar proteomes generally differ
from the organelle-encoded ones. The pI bias values only
of the mitochondrial premature proteins of Viridiplantae

and Fungi and mitochondrial mature proteins of Chordata fall within the quartile range of the pI bias of corresponding organelle-encoded proteomes.
Schwartz et al. [6] analyzed three subcellular localizations
of proteins and found that cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteomes contain more acidic and basic proteins,
respectively, whereas the nuclear proteome has rather
equal proportions of the acidic and basic proteins. In this
paper we have considered 12 subcellular localizations in
analyses (Tab. 3). (See also additional data file 9 for distributions of pI and relationships between length of proteins and their pI for these proteomes.) The results
showed that the most acidic proteomes are present not
only in cytosol but also in vacuoles and lysosomes and
many acidic proteins build cytoskeleton. The most basic is
the mitochondrial proteome and the distribution of pI of
proteins integral to membrane is slightly shifted towards
basicity. The rest of subcellular localizations contain more
balanced proportions of acidic and basic proteins. The
basic character of integral membrane proteins may be
explained by the presence of the basic residues on either
side of membrane spanning region, which play a role in a
stabilization of proteins in the membrane [6]. Basicity of
mitochondrial proteins results from the presence of positively charged transit peptides. The other relationships
between the pI and the subcellular localization are probably related to the presence of some specific groups of proteins in particular localizations (e.g. acid hydrolases in
lysosomes, degradative enzymes in vacuoles and acidic
proteins such as: actins, dyneins, keratins, kinesins, lamins, myosins, tubulins in cytoskeleton). It is interesting to
correlate the pI distribution of the particular proteomes
with the pH of the compartments in which these proteomes are located. However, we did not observe any statistically significant correlation (r = 0.38, p = 0.27, n = 10).
Relationships between pI values of proteomes and ecology
of their organisms
To analyse the relationships between the pI of proteomes
and ecology of organisms in details, all analysed prokaryotic proteomes were classified to different ecological subgroups (see the Methods section for details) and then

compared in respect to the pI bias (Tab. 4). The KruskalWallis tests revealed that the differences were not statistically significant when organisms were grouped according
to their oxygen and temperature requirements (p > 0.1)
but they were very significant when classified according to
their habitat, relation to host cell and salinity requirements (p < 0.001). The same conclusion we have drawn
(on the same significance level) when the χ2 test was performed. Fig. 5 presents the ratios of the observed to
expected number of proteomes in a given class of pI bias
for different ecological classifications.
The analyses showed that salinity is positively correlated
with the acidity of proteomes – the more halophilic
organisms have more acidic proteomes. It agrees with
results of other authors who observed in halophiles predominance of acidic over basic residues [18-22] and low
isoelectric point of their proteins [10-12]. Extremely halophilic and moderately halophilic bacteria are present only
in the 'acidic' class and mesohalophiles disappear in the
'basic' class (Fig. 5C). This relationship is usually
explained by the higher stability and solubility of proteins
rich in acidic residues in hypersaline environment [19,2328].
Considering habitat preferences, host-associated organisms have the least acidic proteomes compared to other
groups and aquatic bacteria possess the most acidic ones.
In the 'acidic' class aquatic bacteria are the most overrepresented group and host-associated species the most
underrepresented one (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, the
'basic' class contains only host-associated microorganisms. Although proteomes of host-associated species are
shifted towards more basic proteomes, they are still acidic
on average (Tab. 4). However, a more detailed classification of organisms considering their relation to the host
cell has revealed that proteomes of intracellular bacteria
are on average basic and extracellular and free-living/

intracellular species have slightly acidic proteomes (Fig.
5E). More acidic proteomes are characteristic of free-living/extracellular and free-living species. Actually, these
two groups are overrepresented in the 'acidic' class
whereas intracellular bacteria are strongly overrepresented
in the 'basic' class. The results show that the more an
organism is related to the host cell the more basic proteome it has. The explanation of this result will be discussed in the next section where the relationship between
the pI bias, proteome size and GC content of genome is
considered. We have also noticed that all intracellular
organisms that have slightly acidic proteomes (Anaplasma, Brucella, Chlamydiae, Ehrlichia) and the majority of them (with only one exception) that have slightly
basic proteomes with the pI bias ≤ 20% (Bartonella, Coxiella, Parachlamydia, Rickettsia conorii, Tropheryma, Wolbachia) reside and usually replicate in vacuoles or

phagosomes. What is interesting, R. conorii has the least
basic proteome within the Rickettsia genus and as the
only representative of its genus was observed in a vacuole
[29]. It would imply that environment of vacuoles modifies proteomes of intracellular organisms towards acidicity.
Ecological changes quite strongly and quickly influence
the pI bias in the course of evolution of proteomes
because the changes in the pI bias are seen even among
closely related organisms. We have gathered all analysed
species belonging to the same genus and having different
ecological assignments (see additional data file 10). In
every case the pI bias of host-associated species is more
shifted towards higher values (i.e. basicity) than the bias
of species living in the multiple environments. The most
pronounced examples are two species of Burkholderia of
which one lives in a terrestrial habitat and posses the
acidic proteome and the other one is associated with a

Relationships between pI values of proteomes, their sizes
and GC content of genomes
The relationship between pI value of proteomes, their
sizes and GC content of genomes was analysed by Knight
et al. [7]. They concluded that there is no correlation
between median pI and GC content in small basic proteomes and have opened the discussion about the reasons
of basicity of tiny proteomes by giving two unverified
potential explanations: selection of proteins in the proteome and selection within particular proteins. To see
how general these relations are, we have performed analyses on a larger set of proteomes using the pI bias and considering the relation of organisms to host cell in more
detail.

Fig. 6A presents the relationship between the pI bias and
proteome size (expressed as logarithm of proteins
number) for prokaryotic organisms. The plot in additional data file 11 includes also eukaryotic organisms. A
clear trend is visible for prokaryotic proteomes – the
smaller proteomes contain more basic proteins – whereas,
the most of proteomes of Eukaryota are shifted towards
larger values of proteome size. The correlation coefficient
for the set containing prokaryotic proteomes is r = -0.64 (p
< 0.001). The negative correlation has been found also for
the pI bias and the GC content of genomes (for the whole
set: r = -0.49, for prokaryotic proteomes r = -0.50; for both
p < 0.001). Generally, the genomes with lower GC content code for more basic proteomes. Detailed analysis of
prokaryotic proteomes, considering relation between
organisms and the host cell have shown that the more a
bacterial strain relies on its host the higher is AT fraction
in its genome and the smaller and more basic proteome it
possesses (Fig. 6). Most of these organisms are intracellular parasites or endosymbionts or at least they are in some
way associated with their host (extracellular). It seems
that the rules are general because the proteome encoded
by the nucleomorph of a eukaryote Guillardia theta [30] is
also AT-rich, reduced and the most basic in the whole set.
G. theta is a unicellular cryptophyte alga which is a host
for another cell with reduced residual nucleus called the
nucleomorph. The cell may be considered endosymbiont
as well.
The observed correlations are clearer when only species
with proteomes smaller than 1000 proteins are consid-

ered. The correlation coefficients change from -0.64 to 0.82 for the relationship between the pI bias and proteome size and from -0.49 to -0.58 for the relationship
between the pI bias and GC content and are statistically
significant. Therefore, the hypothesis that the inefficiency
of DNA repairing mechanisms in intracellular microorganisms causes the large AT bias of their small genomes
and in consequence greater content of basic lysine [31]
can not be completely excluded. It is possible that there
are some other reasons of the observed relationships
between the basicity of the proteome and the reduction of
its size such as: gain or loss of some groups of proteins
causing the pI shift of the whole proteome or selection for
pI changes of particular proteins, e.g. involved in adaptation to the new environment or host [7]. The former
hypothesis explains at least the differences between mitochondrial proteomes (see above).
We have considered if this hypothesis explains the basicity
of small prokaryotic proteomes as well. We can exclude

acquisition of basic proteins as the explanation because it
is difficult to find any new genes gained by intracellular
bacteria that would be absent from the closely related freeliving relatives [32-34]. Usually, in the intracellular bacteria many genes deteriorate or are eliminated rather, leaving a conserved set of genes (e.g. encoding basic
ribosomal proteins). The loss of dispensable genes coding
for acidic proteins could lead to the shift of the whole proteome towards basicity. One could assume that conserved
orthologous proteins present both, in the intracellular
bacteria and in their free-living counterparts did not
change their functions in the course of evolution and
these sets have the same proportions of different classes of
proteins. Then we should expect that these proteomes
have similar pI distributions and are more basic than the
proteins which are still present in the free-living bacteria
but were lost in the intracellular organism. To check this
we have analysed distribution of pI for three sets of proteins: present only in the free-living bacteria but not in the
intracellular ones, and orthologous proteins common for
the intracellular bacteria and their free-living counterparts
analysed separately for these two groups of bacteria. The
results of comparison of Escherichia coli K12 with: Buchnera aphidicola str. Bp, Candidatus Blochmannia floridanus
and Wigglesworthia glossinidia are presented in Fig. 7. The
set of orthologous proteins of these endosymbionts is very
basic. However, the orthologous proteins of E. coli are
even more acidic than the set of proteins present only in
E. coli and lost in the endosymbionts. We have obtained
similar results for seven other pairs of bacteria. Assuming
that the E. coli proteome resembles the free-living ancestor
of the endosymbionts we can estimate that 300 to 400 of
its proteins (i.e. 55–65 percent of the common part of
proteomes) have changed their pI from acidic to basic
during transition to intracellular way of life. Therefore, in
contradiction to the mitochondrial proteomes, the
observed shift of small bacterial proteomes towards basicity cannot be explained by the gain or loss of some proteins in the proteome but by the shift of pI of many
proteins.
To find the explanation of this shift, we have generated for
each organism a proteome of the same length distribution
of proteins as in its real proteome but with the amino acid
composition calculated for the base composition characteristic for the given genome that reflects, to some extent,
the composition generated by mutational pressure [35].
We generated 100 such proteomes for each organism and
we averaged their pI bias. These proteomes show the equilibrium steady state of proteomes evolving only under
mutational pressure without any selection constraints. All
generated proteomes showed extremely high (higher than
85%) pI bias with average = 94% (Fig. 8A, see additional
data file 6 for the E. coli example). Actually, according to
the genetic code table, assuming equal frequencies of

the basic ones. The relationship between the fraction of
the basic or acidic amino acid and GC content is non-linear but any nucleotide composition favours basic residues
especially for extreme GC content (Fig. 8B). The smallest
difference between the fraction of coded basic and acidic
amino acid is for 37% of GC. It is in agreement with the
relationship obtained for the generated proteomes. The
lowest pI bias falls between 30% and 40% of GC content.
Furthermore, the points bifurcate towards the higher pI
bias for the extreme values of GC content showing negative correlation below and positive correlation above 40%
of GC content. The negative relationship is probably connected with the increase of basic lysine coded by AT-rich
codons whereas the positive one – with the growth of
basic arginine coded by GC-rich codons. Since any DNA

composition (especially the one in equilibrium with
mutational pressure) shifts proteomes towards basicity,
we can assume that the acidic proteomes are subjected to
strong selection pressure opposite to the mutational pressure. The more acidic a proteome is the stronger selection
should be exerted on it. So far, the most acidic proteomes
belong to extreme halophiles so we should expect very
strong selection constraints on this group exerted by the
hypersaline environment in which they live.
The results indicate that AT bias alone cannot explain the
observed basicity of tiny proteomes. We have not
observed any correlation for these virtual proteomes
between the pI bias and proteome size also. It seems that
the acceleration of mutation accumulation itself could be

responsible for the basicity of tiny proteomes. It is in
agreement with the well-documented higher evolutionary
rate of intracellular bacteria than their free-living relatives.
It has been suggested that the higher rate of evolution
results from enhanced mutation rate [36] and/or Muller's
ratchet effect or the easier fixation of mutations by genetic
drift in small asexual populations [37-46]. Accordingly,
the increase of basicity of proteomes and the increase of
mutational AT bias would be paralelly ongoing phenomena resulting from the higher evolution rate of genomes of
intracellular bacteria. The elevated AT bias probably
results from the elimination of genes encoding DNA
repair and recombination-associated enzymes or at least
from the decrease in their efficiency in intracellular organisms [31,32,37,47-49]. These enzymes would normally
correct the error-related tendency toward AT enrichment,
for example the deamination of cytosine to uracil, which
is then replaced by thymine.
To confirm our explanation we have analysed 39 sets of
much conserved orthologous proteins present in each of
100 selected prokaryotic organisms, representing quite
uniformly the values of the pI bias. We have assumed that
if the increase in substitution rate affects the pI distribution we should observe a positive correlation between the
pI of these proteins and the pI bias of the whole proteomes. Actually, for 36 of them we have found such statistically significant correlation (see additional data file
12). Three sets, for which the correlation was not significant, represent the most basic ribosomal proteins and
maybe their further shift was improbable. The results indicate that even much conserved proteins subjected to
strong selectional constraints follow the global trend in
the pI distribution. Such a relationship concerns probably
many other proteins because analyses of pI of Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COGs) showed that proteins of
only few clusters are conserved and stay in the same acidic
or basic set while the majority of them jump between the
two sets [15]. Many of these promiscuous proteins are
membrane proteins that have direct contact with the
external environment and may be considered adaptive
proteins. Therefore it would favour the hypothesis about
the selection for pI changes of particular proteins. However, it does not fully explain the basicity of small prokaryotic proteomes because the changes of pI concern also
many non-membrane and much conserved proteins.
(Relationships between pI and other phenomena we discussed in additional data file 13.)
It would be interesting to investigate the relationship
between the change of the pI distribution of proteomes
and the transition of organisms from the free to intracellular way of life on different stages of genome reduction.
Very insightful results concerning this subject would give
sequencing and analysis of reduced genomes of bacterial
endosymbionts identified in eukaryotic hosts, e.g. a
cyanobacterium in amoeba Paulinella chromatophora, a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/163

cyanobacterium Cyanothece in diatom Rhopalodia gibba, a
Gram-negative bacterium in diatom Pinnularia nobilis and
many different bacterial endosymbionts found in various
species of insects. Additional interesting results would
come from analyses of nucleomorphs – small, reduced
eukaryotic nuclei found in certain plastids present in
some groups of algae such as cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Moreover, it is interesting to estimate how
many mutations are required or should be accepted to
remodel one proteome to another in the aspect of their pI.
However, many factors such as length, amino acid composition, pI of the original proteins, mutation rate and
patterns of nucleotide substitutions and resulting patterns
of amino acid substitutions should be taken into account.

Conclusion
Although the distribution of pI of proteins in proteomes
is generally bimodal, different species have different
abundance of acidic and basic proteins that is correlated
with ecology of these species, especially with habitat, relation to the host cell and salinity of the environment. The
pI distribution is also related with taxonomy of organism
but only on higher taxonomical levels and subcellular
localization of some proteomes. The other factor that
shapes the distribution is the rate of mutations accumulation. The rate is higher in intracellular organisms than in
free-living ones and it is responsible for the basicity of tiny
proteomes that explains the observed relationship
between the proteome size and pI of proteomes.

Methods
Proteomic sets were downloaded from different sources
(see additional data file 1 for details): National Center for
Biotechnology Information, European Bioinformatics
Institute, DOE Joint Genome Institute, Broad Institute of
MIT and Harvard, The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR), Welcome Trust Sanger Institute, Ensembl project,
Stanford Genomic Resources, Virginia Commonwealth
University, National Institute of Genetics, Japan, PlasmoDB, International Fugu Genome Consortium, Genoscope, DictyBase and SilkDB. We have not analysed
proteomes containing less than 10 proteins. In sum we
have analysed 1784 proteomes grouped in the following
sets encoded by: chromosomes in Archaea (22), Bacteria
(210) and Eukaryota (63), mitochondria (720), plastids
(42), prokaryotic plasmids (319), phages (245) and
viruses (163). Note that in the paper, in the proteomes of
Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota only chromosomeencoded proteins are referred to. Sequences of nuclearencoded proteins with annotated transit peptides and targeted to mitochondria (2021) or plastids (1173) were
downloaded from UniProt database [50]. Proteomes of
12 subcellular localizations (in sum 13,039 proteins)
were extracted from non-redundant datasets from DBSubLoc database [51].

Isoelectric points were calculated using the standard iterative algorithm [52,53] that gives relatively precise results
of pI calculations for raw protein sequences [1,2]. The
algorithm is used in the Compute pI/Mw tool at the
ExPASy server [54]. The source code of the algorithm was
kindly supplied by Elisabeth Gasteiger.
Each proteome was divided into two sets named the acidic
and the basic one according to the pI value of its proteins.
To find the point of division of proteomes for the two sets,
we ranked proteins according to their pI values, cut off
10% tails of both acidic and basic proteins and the rest of
the proteome distribution was scanned for the largest difference in pI between two neighbouring proteins. The
point of division between acidic and basic proteins was set
in the middle of this distance. Because of statistical reasons, the procedure was applied only to big chromosomeencoded proteomes of Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota.
Because of the narrow range and the universality of the
mid-point, we assumed as the division point of smaller
proteomes encoded by plasmids, mitochondria, plastids,
viruses and phages the median of the mid point calculated
for the big proteomes which equals 7.41.
Proteomes were characterized by the average pI and the
average length of proteins separately for the basic and the
acidic sets of proteins and by the "pI bias" (b) describing
the relation between the number of proteins in the basic
set and the number of proteins in the acidic set: b = 100·
(Nbasic-Nacidic)/(Nbasic+Nacidic), where Nacidic and Nbasic
denote the numbers of proteins in the acidic and the basic
sets, respectively.
The different sets of proteomes were clustered by the
UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-Group Method Arithmetic
Averages) method based on the median of the pI bias. The
clustering was performed with the neighbour program
from the PHYLIP 3.6 package [55]. To evaluate the reliability of specific clades in UPGMA trees we created 10 000
matrices of median of the pI bias generated by the random
sampling of 2/3 members of each group of proteomes
(subsampling method). Then we applied the neighbor
and consense programs (from the PHYLIP package) to calculate the percent of randomised trees containing a given
clade. Moreover, the WeightLESS program [56] was used
to perform the WLS-LRT (Weighted least-squares likelihood ratio test) and F-test.
All analysed prokaryotic proteomes were classified
according to five ecological signatures: habitat (aquatic,
host-associated, multiple, specialized, terrestrial), relation
to host cell (extracellular, free living, free living/extracellular, free living/intracellular, intracellular), salinity
(extreme halophilic, moderate halophilic, mesohalophilic, non-halophilic), oxygen (aerobic, anaerobic, facul-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/163

tative, microaerophilic) and temperature requirements
(hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, psychrophilic, thermophilic). The classification was based on the data published on the NCBI web site, papers related to the
sequenced genomes and other sources. A given species
was assigned only to one subgroup, the most typical for its
ecological property. To analyse the relationship between
the pI bias and ecological classification of proteomes the
analysed proteomes of particular ecological subgroups
were distributed among three classes of the pI bias
('acidic': -90% to -30%, 'neutral': -30% to 30% and 'basic':
30% to 90%). Then the observed numbers of proteomes
in the given class were compared to the expected ones by
χ2 test.
Sets of orthologous proteins of prokaryotic organisms
were downloaded from Microbial Genome Databse –
MBGD [57].
The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and t-Student test
were applied accordingly to determine statistical significance of tested hypotheses. The Benjamini-Hochberg
multiple comparisons procedure for controlling the false
discovery rate was used [58].
