Abstract
Background: Metagenomic sequence data are proving to be a vast resource for the discovery of
biological components. Yet analysis of this data to identify functional RNAs lags behind efforts to
characterize protein diversity. The genome of 'Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique' HTCC 1062 is the
closest match for approximately 20% of marine metagenomic sequence reads. It is also small,
contains little non-coding DNA, and has strikingly low GC content.
Results: To aid the discovery of RNA motifs within the marine metagenome we exploited the
genomic properties of 'Cand. P. ubique' by targeting our search to long intergenic regions (IGRs)
with relatively high GC content. Analysis of known RNAs (rRNA, tRNA, riboswitches etc.) shows
that structured RNAs are significantly enriched in such IGRs. To identify additional candidate
structured RNAs, we examined other IGRs with similar characteristics from 'Cand. P. ubique' using
comparative genomics approaches in conjunction with marine metagenomic data. Employing this
strategy, we discovered four candidate structured RNAs including a new riboswitch class as well
as three additional likely cis-regulatory elements that precede genes encoding ribosomal proteins
S2 and S12, and the cytoplasmic protein component of the signal recognition particle. We also
describe four additional potential RNA motifs with few or no examples occurring outside the
metagenomic data.
Conclusion: This work begins the process of identifying functional RNA motifs present in the
metagenomic data and illustrates how existing completed genomes may be used to aid in this task.

Background
The discovery of many RNA sequences that do not encode
proteins (non-coding RNAs or ncRNA) and have biological functions beyond those of tRNA and rRNA, has significantly expanded the known role of RNA in diverse

cellular processes. Consequently, there is a growing effort
to systematically identify ncRNAs utilizing both experimental and computational techniques. Experimental
approaches are typically used to identify non-coding portions of an organism's genome that are actively being tranPage 1 of 16

scribed. These approaches are not dependent on the
identification of conserved RNA sequences or secondary
structures, and therefore are well-suited for the discovery
of unstructured or poorly-conserved ncRNAs. However,
experimental limitations can cause some RNAs to be
missed, and the false-positive rate may be high due to
"transcriptional noise" [1,2]. Alternatively, computational methods seek to identify evidence of conserved
RNA sequences and secondary structures through comparative genomics [3,4]. However, such methods usually cannot be used to identify RNA motifs that may not have
conserved secondary structure, are small with few basepairing elements, or are not well-represented in genomic
sequence databases.
Marine metagenomic sequence data are a proven resource
for the discovery of novel protein diversity and have provided additional examples for thousands of previously
identified open reading frames (ORFs) with no known
homologs [5]. While there have been surveys conducted
with the marine metagenome to discover additional
examples of known ncRNAs [6,7], there have been no
studies explicitly examining these data for novel RNA
motifs, in part due to unique computational challenges
inherent to metagenomic datasets. Specifically, the
exceedingly large amount of sequence data available (~7
billion base pairs), relatively poor annotation of protein
coding regions due to a high frequency of fragmentary
genes that result from short sequence reads, and comparatively high sequencing error rates make metagenomic
data analysis difficult [8-10].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

At 1.3 million base pairs, the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique'
is the smallest known for a free-living organism, but it
appears to encode for nearly all the basic functions of Alphaproteobacteria cells [14]. The genome contains very little non-coding DNA, with a median intergenic region
(IGR) length of 3 nucleotides. In addition, the organism
has remarkably low GC content (29%). While evaluating
nucleotide composition is usually not a viable method for
identifying ncRNAs [15], in genomes with a strong AT bias
or hyperthermophilic environment, the higher GC content necessary to maintain a stable RNA structure may be
used to identify candidate ncRNAs [16-19]. 'Cand. P.
ubique' offers an ideal opportunity to utilize nucleotide
composition as its genome has very few long IGRs, which
are generally low GC (23% on average).
In the current study we combine nucleotide composition
with comparative genomics approaches to identify novel
structured RNA motifs in 'Cand. P. ubique' and the marine
metagenomic data. First, we demonstrate that longer,
higher GC 'Cand. P. ubique' IGRs are much more likely to
contain structured RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, etc.). Subsequently, we utilized the IGRs in 'Cand. P. ubique' with
similar properties that lack assigned ncRNAs as the starting point for a comparative sequence analysis strategy that
takes advantage of marine metagenomic sequences. We
discovered four likely structured ncRNAs including a new
riboswitch class, and three other candidate cis-regulatory
motifs. In addition we describe several other conserved
IGRs that encode potential structured RNA elements.

Results
To circumvent many of the challenges associated with
analyzing metagenomic sequence data, we have used the
genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' HTCC 1062 as a starting
point to discover new RNA motifs within the marine
metagenome. Bacteria of the SAR11 clade, of which 'Cand.
P. ubique' is a representative, are found throughout the
world's oceans and are the dominant aerobic heterotrophs in marine surface waters [11]. Given its numeric
advantage, genes from members of the SAR11 clade are
well-represented in marine metagenomic libraries with
nearly 20% of sequence reads from the Global Oceanographic Survey (GOS) matching most closely to genes
present in the 'Cand. P. ubique' genome [12,13]. Only
~30% of the GOS reads could be aligned well to the 584
available reference genomes. The other predominant genera represented in the GOS data are Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Burkholderia, and Shewanella, none of which are
closely related to 'Cand. P. ubique'. While, alignments to
every reference genome were identified, typically they
showed identity to regions corresponding to large, highly
conserved genes [13].

Analysis strategy
To identify potential ncRNAs in the genome of 'Cand. P.
ubique', all IGRs were extracted from the 'Cand. P. ubique'
genome and ranked by GC content. When 'Cand. P.
ubique' IGRs are plotted by their length and percent GC,
those containing annotated RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, riboswitches, etc.) cluster toward the top right of the graph
(Figure 1). This finding indicates that the vast majority of
GC-enriched IGRs longer than 100 bp carry annotated
ncRNAs (Additional file 1).

To identify additional structured RNAs that may not be
annotated, we performed BLAST searches of the remaining IGRs against the Community Cyberinfrastructure for
Advanced Marine Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) database [20]. Table 1 lists GC enriched
'Cand. P. ubique' IGRs longer than 100 bp and the
number of BLAST hits identified with an E-value less than
10-5 as a measure of conservation. The average number of
blast hits for IGRs containing tRNAs is 2158, with a standard deviation of 1282. However, the average number of
blast hits for the 'Cand. P. ubique' IGRs containing SAMII riboswitches, which are significantly smaller than a

Percent GC-content versus length of intergenic regions (IGRs) in 'Cand. P. ubique'. Transfer and ribosomal RNAs
are as annotated by Rfam [24] and RefSeq (RefSeq accession NC_007205.1). Other structured RNAs include known riboswitches, 4.5S RNA (SRP RNA), RNase P RNA and tmRNA.

tRNA and most commonly present in Alpha-, Beta- and
Gammaproteobacteria, is approximately 500. Based on
this analysis and the need for a relatively large number of
BLAST hits for subsequent comparative sequence analysis
algorithms, IGRs with greater than 200 BLAST hits were
further screened for unannotated ncRNAs and misannotated protein coding sequence. This screening process
revealed several misannotated protein coding sequences
in addition to several known structured RNAs not previously annotated (Additional file 2 – Table 1). The RNA
motifs identified are typically very highly ranked on our
list, and include tmRNA, the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), the RNase P RNA (class A),
and a number of riboswitches (Table 1).
Identification of SRP RNA (4.5S RNA) [21] and RNase P
RNA [22,23] was very straightforward. Both are completely contained within their respective IGRs and conform to well-established consensus sequences [24]. We
also easily identified a variety of RNA cis-regulatory ele-

ments known as riboswitches [25] including two representatives of the glycine riboswitch class [26] previously
described in 'Cand. P. ubique' [27], two class II SAM riboswitches (SAM-II) [28] and a TPP riboswitch [29,30].
In contrast, identification of the tmRNA [31] representative was somewhat more challenging. The tmRNA eluded
identification during initial screens for several reasons.
First, in the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' the flanking gene
(thyX, SAR11_0010) is likely misannotated resulting in a
partial overlap of the annotated coding region with the
tmRNA. While coding sequences in 'Cand. P. ubique'
often overlap by several nucleotides, an in-frame methionine at position 30 of the existing annotation for thymidylate synthase sequence is most likely the correct start
site based on BLAST analysis of ThyX protein sequences.
Second, the genomic sequence of the tmRNA is split and
permuted relative to the mature form of the RNA in 'Cand.
P. ubique'. While this feature is shared by most other Alphaproteobacteria and by some Cyanobacteria [32], it

makes identification of the RNA more difficult because
the region between the two sections varies in length
between 75 and 125 bp [33], and the permuted model is
not currently represented in the Rfam database [24].
By applying length, %GC and conservation thresholds we
have significantly enriched our list of IGRs for known
structured RNAs. Only, 4% of all IGRs in 'Cand. P. ubique'
contain known structured RNAs. Approximately 17% of
IGRs greater than 100 bp contain structured RNA; and
eliminating IGRs with <26% GC increases this percentage
to ~40%. Applying the BLAST hit threshold further
increases percentage of considered IGRs containing
known structured RNAs to ~75%. However, our parameter choices do exclude 2 of the 34 IGRs (6%) containing
previously known RNAs. The first is a tRNA that is found
within an IGR of 98 bp. We explored lowering the 100 bp
threshold. However, we identified few additional candidates, and these candidates typically were very close to
previously established thresholds for other parameters
further decreasing their attractiveness for comprehensive
study. The second example of a known RNA we excluded
using our parameters is the IGR containing a SAM-II riboswitch preceding metX (SAR11_0217), which failed to rank
highly based on GC-enrichment. The IGR containing this
riboswitch is 191 nucleotides long and 22.5% GC (ranked
121st in the genome based on Additional file 1). However,
the SAM-II aptamer alone is 70 nucleotides long and 30%
GC. An early investigation of the 'Cand. P. ubique'
genome did explore ranking the IGRs by the highest percent GC within a "sliding window" of 50 nucleotides [19].
However, this did not change the rankings of 'Cand. P.
ubique' IGRs significantly (R2 = 0.84, Additional file 3).
Thus, this additional level of complexity was not implemented for the final analysis.
For those IGRs that are longer than 100 bp, greater than
26% GC, and well-conserved in the marine metagenome
(Table 1) but do not contain known structured RNAs,
similar sequences identified by the BLAST analysis were
used as input for comparative sequence analysis algorithms employed for ncRNA discovery. For each IGR several hypothetical alignments and secondary structures
were generated using a covariance model search [34].
These alignments and predicted secondary structures were
then used as the starting point for homology searches of
the NCBI and metagenomic sequence databases to identify additional examples [35,36]. To confirm and refine
secondary-structure models and sequence alignments, all
examples for a particular IGR were subsequently combined and the process repeated beginning with the covariance model search to generate an RNA secondary
structure that is well-supported by a large number of representatives (100–300 unique sequences).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

Using this strategy, we discovered candidate structured
RNA elements located 5' relative to genes encoding ribosomal proteins S2 (rpsB) and S12 (rpsL), and the signal recognition particle protein (ffh). We also found a structured
RNA element associated with genes for the methionine
biosynthesis proteins O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase
(metY), homoserine S-methyltransferase (mmum) and
betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (bhmt) (Figure
2). Moreover, we identified a series of IGRs that contain
potential RNA structures that are less well-supported by
the alignments and often include highly conserved
regions with few mutations and thus few opportunities to
observe covariation and compatible mutations that are
the hallmark of a correctly predicted RNA secondary structure (Figure 3). Features of these new-found candidate
structured RNAs are described below.
rpsB motif
We identified a likely RNA motif preceding the gene rpsB,
which encodes ribosomal protein S2. The motif is present
in both marine metagenomic sequences and most Alphaproteobacteria with the exception of most members of
the Rickettsiaceae family (Additional file 4). In addition,
we identified representatives in most Gammaproteobacteria, a few Epsilon-, Delta-, and Betaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and some Firmicutes. In nearly all examples
where the downstream genes can be determined, the
motif precedes rpsB. However, a few precede fts, which
encodes elongation factor Ts (Ef-Ts) and is often found in
the same operon as rpsB [37].

The structure of rpsB motif (Figure 2A) consists of a long
base-paired structure (P1) capped by a three-stem junction carrying two variable length stems (P2 and P3), both
of which may be very short, or absent in some representatives. The nucleotide junction between P2 and P3 (J2–3)
forms a pseudoknot with the 3' extension following P1.
P2 is quite short in 'Cand. P. ubique' and consists of only
three base pairs. In Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and most
Gammaproteobacteria this pairing element is entirely
absent or very short (three or fewer base pairs). In contrast, P2 is up to eleven base-pairs in some species of Alphaproteobacteria. P3 is also quite short in 'Cand. P.
ubique' with only two base pairs, however, it is typically
at least four base pairs and has greater than twelve base
pairs in several species of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The pseudoknot interaction is present across all of the
taxa. However, in Firmicutes it appears to only consist of
three base pairs rather than the five predicted in other
phylogenetic groups.
Cis-regulatory elements in the 5' untranslated regions
(UTRs) of ribosomal protein encoding mRNAs have long
been known [38]. Ribosomal proteins L1 [39], L4 [40,41],
L10/L12 [42], L20 [43], S4 [44,45], S7 [46], S8 [47,48],

The conserved sequence and secondary structure of the four candidate RNA motifs identified
The conserved sequence and secondary structure of the four candidate RNA motifs identified. (A) rhtB associated element, (B) pntA associated element, (C) bablM associated element, (D) SAR11_0636 element. See Additional files 8, 9,
10, 11 for alignments of all representatives. Structural notations are as in Fig. 2, and consensus nucleotides and covariation
computed identically to Fig. 2.

S15 [49], and S1 [50] are known to bind mRNA sequences
to control gene expression. All such sequences characterized to date are autoregulatory, where the mRNA is bound
by a ribosomal protein encoded within the transcript [38].
Typically such sequences inhibit translation, although
some regulate transcription [41,51].
The role of the S2 ribosomal protein in translation is not
well understood. S2 binds the 30S subunit late in ribosome biogenesis and acts as a bridge between the 16S RNA
and ribosomal protein S1, which is the only ribosomal
protein contacting the 30S subunit through protein-protein interactions [52]. The function of S1 is similarly

unclear; however it has been implicated in translating
highly structured mRNAs [53], as well as in the formation
of the translation initiation complex at internal ribosome
binding sites [54]. Analysis of the crystal structure of the
30S subunit from T. Thermophilus ribosome shows that S2
contacts distal regions of the 16S RNA (H26 in the body
and H35–37 in the body) [55]. These regions bear no
obvious resemblance to the motif we have identified.
However, structural mimicry cannot be excluded. In several instances the 5' UTR of an mRNA and the ribosomal
RNA bound by the same protein share similar tertiary
structures despite having little or no primary or secondary
structure similarity [56-59].

The region upstream of the ribosomal protein S2 was
identified as a potential 5' UTR in a transcriptome analysis
of Escherichia coli [60,61]. In addition, recent in vivo work
in E. coli shows that the region 162 nucleotides upstream
of rpsB controls an rpsB-lacZ fusion construct in response
to exogenous S2 added in trans [62]. This work identified
the conserved RNA structure upstream of rpsB in other
Gammaproteobacteria. However, we identified a more
broadly conserved motif in Alpha- Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria as well as Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. In addition, the pseudoknot interaction had not previously been
identified.
rpsL motif
A second putative motif in the 5' UTR of a ribosomal
mRNA was identified for rpsL (encoding ribosomal protein S12), the first gene in a series of 22 genes encoding
ribosomal proteins in 'Cand. P. ubique' that are homologous to those in the E. coli str, spc, and S10 ribosomal operons. We identified over 900 representatives (659 unique
sequences) of the motif in the marine metagenome in
addition to the instance in 'Cand. P. ubique' (Additional
file 5). The motif is consistently identified 3' of rpoC,
which encodes RNA polymerase, and 5' of rpsL. The genes
further downstream of rpsL are typically those identified
in the 'Cand. P. ubique' operon. However, due to the
length of the metagenomic sequences analyzed it is
impossible to determine whether the entire series of ORFs
is conserved. The motif occasionally precedes rpsG or fusA
genes that directly follow rpsL in the 'Cand. P. ubique'
genome. Despite extensive searching, we only identified
the motif in 'Cand. P. ubique' and marine metagenomic
sequence samples.

The motif consists of a bulged P1 stem connecting to a
three-stem junction (Figure 2B). The P2 stem shows covariation throughout its length, however, the loop region is
diverse both in length (3–10 nt) and sequence. Both the
P1 and P3 stems show some covariation, but more positions exhibit breaks in the Watson-Crick base pairing
compared with the P2 stem. The nucleotides in J2–3 are
identical in nearly all examples, and the P3 loop and P1
bulge also show extensive conservation.
Several proteins encoded by this series of ribosomal protein genes in 'Cand. P. ubique' have been shown to regulate ribosomal protein expression in E. coli [40,41,4648,62]. The str ribosomal operon (encoding ribosomal
proteins S12, S7, and elongation factors G and Tu) is regulated by the binding of S7 to the transcript region
between the genes for S12 and S7 [46]. Similarly, the spc
operon (encoding ribosomal proteins L14, L24, L5, S14,
S8, L6, L18, S5, L30 L15 and secY) is regulated by S8 binding to an mRNA structure between L24 and L5 [47,48].
The eleven-gene S10 operon (encoding ribosomal pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

teins S10, L3, L4, L23, L2, S19, L22, S3, L16, L29, S17) is
regulated by ribosomal protein L4 binding to a 5' UTR
preceding the S10 gene [40,41].
The secondary structure of the motif described here does
not bear any resemblance to the regulatory motifs associated with S7, S8 and L4. Additionally, the rpsL motif is not
located at the same genomic position as any of the E. coli
regulatory motifs. While this series of ribosomal proteins
in 'Cand. P. ubique' essentially consists of the three separate E. coli operons, separate regulation in this organism is
unlikely as the coding regions typically overlap by a few
base pairs and the largest IGR is nine nucleotides. This
motif is not identified outside of 'Cand. P. ubique' and the
metagenomic data. However, given its genomic context
and conserved secondary structure, the rpsL motif is likely
a structured RNA involved with regulation of ribosomal
protein expression. Considering the large number of
potential candidates, we cannot predict with confidence
which protein may be its binding partner.
ffh motif
We identified an RNA motif in the IGR preceding the gene
ffh which encodes the cytoplasmic protein component of
the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP). The motif
is well-conserved in metagenomic sequence samples with
over 600 representatives (345 unique sequences) (Additional file 6). In addition, this motif is widespread among
Alphaproteobacteria occurring in all fully-sequenced representatives of the Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales
and Rhizobiales classes. However, the ffh motif does not
occur in any sequenced representatives of the Rhodospirillales or Caulobacterales classes and it is also not
found in representatives of Rickettsiales other than 'Cand.
P. ubique'. In nearly all examples where the downstream
genes can be identified, the motif precedes ffh. This transcript has been detected by several metatranscriptomics
analyses of microbial small RNAs [63,64].

The RNA motif consists of a single bulged hairpin (Figure
2C). However, there is convincing co-variation found at
all positions along the stem with the exception of the first
base-pair which is always a cytosine-guanosine pair. Additionally, there is significant sequence conservation within
the bulge. In particular the two cytosine residues are
found in nearly every example.
The signal recognition particle (SRP) is an essential RNAprotein complex conserved in all three domains of life
that targets secreted proteins to the plasma membrane in
eubacteria and archaea or to the endoplasmic reticulum in
eukaryotes through interactions with peptide signal
sequences [21]. The eubacterial SRP complex consists of
the 4.5S RNA, a cytoplasmic protein (Ffh), and a receptor
protein (FstY) that targets the complex to the membrane.

Page 8 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:268

Ffh binds directly to a conserved portion of the 4.5S RNA
known as helix 8 [65], and FstY in turn binds Ffh [66,67].
The eukaryotic and archaeal SRPs typically consist of
larger RNAs and a greater number of proteins. However,
the interactions between the RNA component and the
cytoplasmic protein are conserved [68].
How the levels of the Ffh protein and the 4.5S RNA are
regulated is not fully understood. In E. coli the 4.5S RNA
is present in excess compared to Ffh [69], and it has been
shown using both depletion studies [70] and examination
of a temperature sensitive ffh mutant in E. coli [71] that
Ffh is significantly stabilized by its interactions with the
4.5S RNA and is rapidly degraded when not bound to the
RNA. However, no regulation at the transcriptional or
translational level has been described. The RNA motif
identified does not appear to resemble the portion of the
4.5S RNA bound by Ffh. However, it is possible that the
motif plays a role in the regulation of the ffh gene, especially given the widespread distribution of this motif and
the precedent for cis-regulatory mRNA elements associated with the genes of RNA binding proteins [72].
Methionine biosynthesis associated motif
We identified a conserved RNA motif preceding the
methionine biosynthesis genes mmum, metY, and bhmt.
This conserved sequence was previously identified as a
potential regulatory region in 'Cand. P. ubique' as the
three genes appear to be co-regulated from proteomic
studies [73]. We found 690 representatives (505 unique
sequences) in metagenomic sequences, most of which
precede metY (Additional file 7). However, there are
metagenomic examples that precede bhmt, metH, and
mmum. In addition, there is a single example in the
genome of Psychroflexus torquis ATCC 700755 (RefSeq
accession NZ_AAPR0000000) also preceding metY.

The motif consists of a simple pseudoknotted structure
that is typically within ten nucleotides of a start codon
(Figure 2D). Both stems show covariation and many loop
nucleotides are well-conserved. Based on the association
of the motif with methionine biosynthesis genes, the
coregulation of the three genes in 'Cand. P. ubique' [73],
and the prevalence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding riboswitches [74], we hypothesized that the RNA was
a SAM-binding riboswitch. In vitro biochemical characterization of the RNA has revealed that representatives of this
RNA motif selectively bind SAM (M. Meyer, E. Poiata, and
R. Breaker; unpublished data).
The RNA motif also displays some similarities to the previously described class II SAM riboswitches (SAM-II) that
bind SAM and control sulfur metabolism genes in Alphaproteobacteria [28]. In particular the two RNA motifs
share a similar overall pseudoknotted structure and many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

of the bases shown to contact the ligand in a crystal structure of the class II SAM riboswitch [75] have equivalent
nucleotides in the new-found motif. Despite these similarities, the motif lacks the final 3' base-pairing element
present in most SAM-II riboswitch representatives. Moreover, both paired regions in the new motif differ in length
from those in the SAM-II consensus, and the loop regions
outside those that bind the ligand in the SAM-II riboswitch are not well conserved. Such differences in the
riboswitch aptamers for SAM-I and SAM-IV riboswitches
cause representatives to be sorted into distinct collections
when examined using bioinformatics search algorithms
that identify common sequence and structural elements
[76]. Likewise, the differences between SAM-II and the
new-found motif also cause them to be sorted independently, suggesting that this is a new class of SAM-binding
riboswitches that we have termed SAM-V.
Other potential RNA motifs
In addition to the motifs that we identified that have
strong support as structured RNAs based on their alignments and distribution, we also identified several potential RNA motifs that are less well-supported. These
candidate RNA motifs have fewer positions with covariation or compatible mutations and are not identified outside the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' and metagenomic
sequences. However, they do exhibit evidence of possible
RNA structure formation and our models are supported
by sequence alignments from the marine metagenome.

The first of these motifs consists of a single bulged hairpin
(Figure 3A). Both portions of the stem are conserved, and
show indications of covariation and compatible mutations at many positions. Both the loop and the bulge are
also well-conserved. The alignment consists of ~1250 representatives (919 unique sequences) from the marine
metagenome and 'Cand. P. ubique' (Additional file 8). In
'Cand. P. ubique' the motif is flanked by a hypothetical
protein and rhtB (LysE type translocator). In the metagenomic sequence, this context is largely conserved. However,
the motif also appears upstream of proC (pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase), as well as other genes further downstream of rhtB in 'Cand. P. ubique' such as livM and livK
(components of putative branched amino acid transporters). Approximately 50% of examples of this motif,
including the one in 'Cand. P. ubique', are directly followed by a poly-uridine track of 6–9 nucleotides potentially forming a rho-independent terminator stem [77].
This feature suggests either a potential regulatory function
or a conserved termination signal. However, the lower
portion of the well-conserved hairpin structure also forms
a fairly convincing inverted repeat sequence, which may
indicate alternative functionality.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:268

The second motif consists of two base-paired stems in
series where the loop of the second is especially well-conserved (Figure 3B). The alignment includes 365 unique
sequences derived from metagenomic sequences (~400
total representatives), in addition to the example in 'Cand.
P. ubique' (Additional file 9). In 'Cand. P. ubique' the
motif is flanked by rpmJ, which encodes the ribosomal
protein L36, and pntA, which encodes the alpha subunit
of a pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase. In the marine
metagenome the motif consistently precedes pntA, but the
gene annotated directly 5' of the motif varies. Most frequently it is the 5S rRNA gene, or rmlB (dTDP-D-glucose
4,6-dehydratase, COG1088). The conserved position of
this motif 5' of the pntA gene suggests a regulatory function related to pntA. However, there is an additional ~60
bp of sequence between the motif and the start of the
gene. While this sequence is somewhat conserved at the
nucleotide level, this region does not appear to have any
structure supported by compatible or covarying base-pair
interactions.
The third motif (Figure 3C) also consists of a set of predicted base-pairing stems in series. The sequence of the
first predicted stem is very strongly conserved, with no
mutations observed in any of the representatives identified. The second stem shows a few compatible mutations
and the position nearest the loop frequently fails to maintain base pairing. The loops and linker regions exhibit
almost no conservation. Approximately 540 representatives (314 unique sequences) were identified in the
marine metagenome, and the genomic context is well
conserved (Additional file 10). The motif occurs between
rnhB1 (RNaseHII) and bablM (a site-specific DNA methylase) in the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' and the vast
majority of metagenomic examples fall between genes
annotated as rnhB1 and a DNA methylase.
The fourth motif is somewhat more complex than others
in this category (Figure 3D). There are ~640 representatives (338 unique sequences) in the marine metagenome
in addition to that in the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique'
(Additional file 11). Its three-stem junction carries a well
conserved stem (P2) that contains two bulged regions,
one of which is highly conserved. Due to this conservation, none of the base pairs are supported by covariation
and only a few by compatible mutations. The other two
stems (P1 and P3) are only moderately conserved, and the
loop of P3 is variable in length containing between 5 and
12 nucleotides with no strong conservation. The motif
occurs between two hypothetical proteins. One
(SAR11_0635) is annotated as both an SOS-mediated
transcriptional repressor and an S24-like peptidase
depending on the database, and the other (SAR11_0636)
is annotated as a SOUL heme-binding protein. In the
metagenomic data, neither of these associations is strictly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

conserved and the annotated genes on either side vary
widely. The genes annotated directly 5' to the motif are
typically syntenous with those in 'Cand. P. ubique' (i.e.
predicted glycoyltransferase, SAR11_0633). The genes
annotated directly 3' of the motif show even greater variation and do not seem to be syntenous with the 'Cand. P.
ubique' genome. Based on these observations, it seems
likely that the RNA is not a cis-regulatory element, but
rather could be a separately transcribed non-coding RNA.
Microarray studies show that transcripts for all of these
genes, although not necessarily any untranslated regions,
are present in 'Cand. P. ubique' during both exponential
growth and stationary phase cells. Interestingly, comparison of microarray and quantitative proteomic data
(unpublished data) for pntA shows a ~300% increase in
protein as cells enter stationary phase, starkly contrasting
the corresponding 9% decease in transcript levels. This
disparity between transcript and protein expression provides further evidence for post-transcriptional regulation
of the gene. Unfortunately, proteomic data are not available for RhtB and BabIM (not included in the AMT-tag
library), and SAR11_0636 was never observed in the proteomic dataset, so direct comparisons are not possible for
these genes.

Discussion
In this study we identified structured RNAs that are conserved in both the genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' and the
marine metagenomic datasets. A few these RNAs were
assigned to previously-known classes, while this is the first
description of others. Our work differs from other surveys
of ncRNAs in the metagenome [6,7] in that we did not
seek to identify additional examples of known motifs, but
rather we sought to discover motifs not previously
described. We identified three likely cis-regulatory protein
binding motifs and a new riboswitch class, and our
approach is validated by the confirmed biological function for two of the four motifs (rpsB motif and SAM-V
riboswitch). In addition to these four RNA cis-regulatory
elements, we also describe a series of motifs for which
there is less evidence of RNA structure. While these RNA
motifs are less well-supported by compatible and covarying mutations than the others we present, the structures
are credible given the number of representatives identified, the degree of sequence conservation, and the thermodynamics of RNA folding.
There are many additional IGRs in 'Cand. P. ubique' that
contain a high percentage GC and seem highly conserved
(Table 1), yet have no discernable RNA structure. For
some of these IGRs, the large number of BLAST hits is the
result of many different short aligned sections of high
identity within the IGR (e.g. the IGR between
SAR11_0641 and SAR11_0642). By contrast, in the IGRs

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:268

where we identified convincing structured RNAs there is
typically a longer region of alignment with mutations distributed throughout. For several other IGRs there are a
large number of BLAST hits that align but form no detectable RNA structure (e.g. the IGR between SAR11_0037
and SAR11_0038). These regions may contain RNAs that
are not extensively structured (e.g. antisense RNAs that
base pair to target RNAs) [78], or perhaps they are conserved protein binding sites that act at the level of DNA.
The parameters we used to identify IGRs for inspection
were based on the properties of previously annotated
RNAs and were designed to capture most structured RNAs.
However, one IGR containing a known structured RNA
does not meet our parameters for inspection. The IGR
containing a SAM-II riboswitch preceding metX
(SAR11_0217) failed to rank highly based on GC-enrichment. The IGR containing this riboswitch is 191 nucleotides long and 22.5% GC (ranked 121st in the genome
based on Additional file 1), significantly below where we
arbitrarily stopped examining IGRs due to the decreasing
number of convincing BLAST matches (Table 1). However, the SAM-II aptamer alone is 70 nucleotides long and
30% GC. An early investigation of the 'Cand. P. ubique'
genome did explore ranking the IGRs by the highest percent GC within a "sliding window" of 50 nucleotides [19].
However, this did not change the rankings of 'Cand. P.
ubique' IGRs significantly (R2 = 0.84, Additional file 11).
Thus, this additional level of complexity was not implemented for the final analysis.
In contrast to other computational genomics studies [3],
we identified relatively few candidate RNAs. This is likely
because there is relatively little to find in 'Cand. P. ubique'
compared with organisms that have larger genomes. The
genome of 'Cand. P. ubique' is hypothesized to be streamlined to minimize nutrient use [14,79]. Even the strong
AT bias may reflect adaptation to nitrogen limitation in a
nutrient poor environment because GC pairs require an
additional nitrogen compared to AT base pairs. A survey
examining lengths of the RNase P RNA, SRP RNA, TPP
and glycine riboswitches in 'Cand. P. ubique' compared
with those in other Alphaproteobacteria showed that
RNAs in 'Cand. P. ubique' have tendency toward fewer
nucleotides (Additional file 12). On average they are
greater than one standard deviation lower than the mean
for a given RNA (average Z-value of -1.12). While this
result is not statistically significant, the motifs identified
here further reflect this tendency. The S2 motif identified
in 'Cand. P. ubique' is among the shortest with an exceedingly short P2 stem (3 bp) and no P3 stem. The presence
of RNA-based regulatory motifs in 'Cand. P. ubique' indicates that such mechanisms can be an effective use of
scarce resources, and the smaller RNAs likely reflect pressure to decrease the number of nucleotides at both the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268

DNA and RNA level. Interestingly ribosomal RNAs and
tRNAs both showed less variation in length among Alphaproteobacteria than other structured RNAs, as well as
less or no evidence of reduction in 'Cand. P. ubique' suggesting that it is difficult to alter RNAs with functions critical for survival.

Conclusion
This study increased the number of candidate structured
RNAs in both 'Cand. P. ubique' and the marine metagenome. Several of the RNAs discovered have wide phylogenetic distribution, while others can only be found through
examination of metagenomic data. The combination of
computational approaches used in this work is relatively
simple and in principle might be applied to any organisms with similar properties. This work also underscores
how single completed genomes that are carefully annotated are important components in the effort toward
annotating and understanding the vast amount metagenomic data available.

Methods
Identification of candidate RNA motifs
Non-protein coding segments of the 'Cand. P. ubique'
genome (RefSeq accession number NC_007205.1) were
computationally identified based on the RefSeq version
25 gene annotations and their sequences extracted [80].
The size and percent GC values for these regions were
established. Individual sequences annotated as harboring
a structured ncRNA according to the Rfam database (version 8.1) were identified [24]. Two additional sequences
containing tRNAs were identified from the RefSeq annotation of the 'Cand. P. ubique' genome, and the riboswitches were located based on alignments maintained
through periodic homology searches [81].

As all known structured RNAs in 'Cand. P. ubique' are
present in IGRs longer than 100 bp (Fig. 1), we used 100
bp as the minimum size requirement for the IGRs we
examined. The conservation level for each IGR was determined by the number of hits returned with an E-value less
than 10-5 from a nucleotide BLAST analysis of the IGR
against the "GOS: All Metagenomic Sequence Reads"
database maintained at the CAMERA website [20]. IGRs
not well-conserved in metagenomic sequence data (less
than 200 blast hits) were removed from consideration.
The remaining IGRs were screened for the presence of
unannotated protein coding regions first through BLASTX
and subsequently TBLASTX searches of the NCBI nr and
nr/nt databases http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
Blast.cgi and TBLASTN searches of the "All Metagenomic
Sequence Reads" CAMERA database. Those sequences
containing a conserved protein coding region (Additional
File 2) were excluded from further analysis.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:268

For the remaining IGRs, all blast matches from the conservation analysis were collected and the sequences extended
to match the length of the IGR, or to the end of the
sequence read (average trimmed sequence read is 822 bp
in length [13]). This collection of sequences was then used
as input for CMFinder version 0.2 [34] which created multiple sequence alignments with putative conserved secondary structures. These alignments were manually
examined for features indicative of a structured RNA such
as extent of covariation within predicted stems and conservation in areas outside base-paired regions. For most
IGRs, several alternative structures were initially chosen
for further analysis due to the high level of conservation
in the sequences.
The alignments and hypothetical secondary structures
were used to search for additional homologs in the
RefSeq25 database [80] along with metagenome
sequences from acid mine drainage [82], soil and whale
fall [83], human gut [84,85], mouse gut [86], gutless sea
worms [87], sludge [88], Global Ocean Survey scaffolds
[12,13], other marine sequences [89] and termite hindgut
[90].
Homology searches were performed using RAVENNA version 0.2f, essentially as described previously
[35,36,91,92]. For each IGR, homologs resulting from
these searches were used in conjunction with the original
sequences as the starting input for a second CMFinder
search and the homology search process was iterated to
derive a single structure, or in cases of predicted pseudoknot interactions two compatible structures, supported by
the alignment.
Analysis of motifs
The alignments of IGRs where convincing RNA structure
could be identified were manually edited by RALEE [93].
We used RNAshapes [94], CMFinder [34] and RAVENNA
[36] during these analyses. Additional homology searches
were conducted using the RAVENNA '-local' and '-global'
command line options with the microbial subset of RefSeq version 25, and the metagenomic sequence databases
described above. As the full RefSeq database is
3,717,469,431 nucleotides and the combined metagenomic databases total 5,529,658,033 nucleotides, several
subset databases (Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Additional File 2 and Global Ocean Survey
Scaffolds) were used to reduce the number of false positive hits. Local searches tended to have greater success
identifying homologs of motifs with variable length or
optional stems.

sequences or annonatated genes in IMG/M [95]. However, sequences from three metagenome projects
[85,89,90] were extracted from GenBank and genes were
predicted using the MetaGene program (dated Oct. 12,
2006) with default parameters [96]. Conserved protein
domains were detected using the Conserved Domain
Database version 2.08 [97].
The extent of covariation and conservation of sequences
reflected in consensus diagrams (e.g. Figure 2) was determined as previously described [92]. Sequences were
weighted to de-emphasize highly similar homologs using
the GSC algorithm [98] implemented by Infernal [35].
Base pairs where both positions in the sequence alignment varied among sequences while maintaining WatsonCrick or G-U wobble base pairing were classified as covarying. Base pairs where a single position varied were classified as compatible mutations. If the frequency of nonWatson-Crick or G-U pairs exceeded 5%, no covariation
or compatible mutation was annotated.
