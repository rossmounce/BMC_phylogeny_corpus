Abstract
Background: DNA barcoding, i.e. the use of a 648 bp section of the mitochondrial gene
cytochrome c oxidase I, has recently been promoted as useful for the rapid identification and
discovery of species. Its success is dependent either on the strength of the claim that interspecific
variation exceeds intraspecific variation by one order of magnitude, thus establishing a "barcoding
gap", or on the reciprocal monophyly of species.
Results: We present an analysis of intra- and interspecific variation in the butterfly family
Lycaenidae which includes a well-sampled clade (genus Agrodiaetus) with a peculiar characteristic:
most of its members are karyologically differentiated from each other which facilitates the
recognition of species as reproductively isolated units even in allopatric populations. The analysis
shows that there is an 18% overlap in the range of intra- and interspecific COI sequence divergence
due to low interspecific divergence between many closely related species. In a Neighbour-Joining
tree profile approach which does not depend on a barcoding gap, but on comprehensive sampling
of taxa and the reciprocal monophyly of species, at least 16% of specimens with conspecific
sequences in the profile were misidentified. This is due to paraphyly or polyphyly of conspecific
DNA sequences probably caused by incomplete lineage sorting.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the "barcoding gap" is an artifact of insufficient sampling
across taxa. Although DNA barcodes can help to identify and distinguish species, we advocate using
them in combination with other data, since otherwise there would be a high probability that
sequences are misidentified. Although high differences in DNA sequences can help to identify
cryptic species, a high percentage of well-differentiated species has similar or even identical COI
sequences and would be overlooked in an isolated DNA barcoding approach.

Background
Molecular tools have provided a plethora of new opportunities to study questions in evolutionary biology (e.g. speciation processes) and in phylogenetic systematics. Only
recently, however, have claims been made that the
sequencing of a small (648 bp) fragment at the 5' end of
the gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI or cox1)

from the mitochondrial genome would be sufficient in
most Metazoa to identify them to the species level [1,2].
This approach called "DNA barcoding" has gained
momentum and the "Consortium for the Bar Code of Life
(CBOL)" founded in September 2004 intends to create a
global biodiversity barcode database in order to facilitate
automated species identifications. Right from the start,

however, this approach received opposition, especially
from the taxonomists' community [3-8]. Some arguments
in this debate are political in nature, others have a scientific basis. Concerning the latter, one of the most essential
arguments focuses on the so-called "barcoding gap".
Advocates of barcoding claim that interspecific genetic
variation exceeds intraspecific variation to such an extent
that a clear gap exists which enables the assignment of
unidentified individuals to their species with a negligible
error rate [1,9,10]. The errors are attributed to a small
number of incipient species pairs with incomplete lineage
sorting (e.g. [11]). As a consequence, establishing the
degree of sequence divergence between two samples
above a given threshold (proposed to be at least 10 times
greater than within species [10]) would indicate specific
distinctness, whereas divergence below such a threshold
would indicate taxonomic identity among the samples.
Furthermore, the existence of a barcoding gap would even
enable the identification of previously undescribed species ([11-13] but see [14]). Possible errors of this
approach include false positives and false negatives. False
positives occur if populations within one species are
genetically quite distinct, e.g. in distant populations with
limited gene flow or in allopatric populations with interrupted gene flow. In the latter case it must be noted that,
depending on the amount of morphological differentiation and the species concept to be applied, such populations may also qualify as 'cryptic species' in the view of
some scientists. False negatives, in contrast, occur when
little or no sequence variation in the barcoding fragment
is found between different biospecies (= reproductively
isolated population groups sensu Mayr [15]). Hence, false
negatives are more critical for the barcoding approach,
because the existence of such cases would reveal examples
where the barcoding approach is less powerful than the
use of other and more holistic approaches to delimit species boundaries.
Initial studies on birds [10] and arthropods [9,16]
appeared to corroborate the existence of a distinct barcoding gap, but two recent studies on gastropods [17] and
flies [18] challenge its existence. The reasons for these discrepancies are not entirely clear. Although levels of COI
sequence divergence differ between higher taxa (e.g. an
exceptionally low mean COI sequence divergence of only
1.0% was found in congeneric species pairs of Cnidaria
compared to 9.6–15.7% in other animal phyla [2]), Mollusca (with 11.1% mean sequence divergence between
species) and Diptera (9.3%) are not peculiar in this
respect. Meyer & Paulay [17] assume that insufficient sampling on both the interspecific and intraspecific level create the artifact of a barcode gap. Proponents of barcoding
might argue, however, that the main reason for this overlap is the poor taxonomy of these groups, e.g. cryptic species may have been overlooked which are differentiated

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/8

genetically but very similar or even identical in morphology.
If the barcode gap does not exist, then the threshold
approach in barcoding becomes inapplicable. Although
more sophisticated techniques (e.g. using coalescence theory and statistical population genetic methods [19-21])
can sometimes help to delimit species with overlapping
genetic divergences, these approaches require additional
assumptions (e.g. about the choice of population genetic
models or clustering algorithms) and are only feasible in
well-sampled clades.
Barcoding holds promise nonetheless especially in the
identification of arthropods, the most species-rich animal
phylum in terrestrial ecosystems. Identification of arthropods is often extremely time-consuming and generally
requires taxonomic specialists for any given group. Moreover, the fraction of undescribed species is particularly
high, as opposed to vertebrates. Hence, there is substantial
demand for improved (and rapid) identification tools by
scientists who seek identification of large arthropod samples from complex faunas. Therefore arthropods deserve
to be considered the yard-stick for the usefulness of barcoding approaches among Metazoa and it is not surprising that several recent studies have tried to apply DNA
barcoding in arthropods [9,11-13,16,18,19,22-27]. Diversity is concentrated in tropical ecosystems, but measuring
intra- and interspecific sequence divergence in tropical
insects is hampered by the fragmentary knowledge of
most taxa. In contrast, insects of temperate zones, and
most notably the butterflies of the Holarctic region, are
well known taxonomically compared to other insects. The
species-rich Palaearctic genus (or subgenus) Agrodiaetus
provides an excellent example to test the existence of the
barcode gap in arthropods. This genus is exceptional
because of its extraordinary interspecific variation in chromosome numbers which have been investigated for most
of its ca 120 species ([28-30] and references therein). As a
result several cryptic species which hardly or not at all differ in phenotype have been discovered (e.g. [31-39]).
Available evidence suggests that apart from a few exceptions (e.g. due to supernumerary chromosomes) differences in chromosome numbers between butterfly species
are linked to infertility in interspecific hybrids [40]. This is
due to problems in the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Since major differences in chromosome numbers are indicative of clear species boundaries,
they are helpful also to infer species-level differentiation
for allopatric populations. Agrodiaetus butterflies therefore
are an ideal case for testing the validity of the barcoding
approach. If valid, then it must be possible to safely recognize all species that can be distinguished by phenotype,
karyotype or both character sets with reference to
sequence divergences alone. On the contrary, failure of

DNA barcodes to differentiate between species that are
distinguished by clear independent evidence would
undermine the superiority of the barcoding approach,
which has especially been attributed to taxa with "difficult" classical taxonomy, such as Agrodiaetus.

Results
Intraspecific divergence
The average divergence in 1189 intraspecific comparisons
is 1.02% (SE = 1.13%). 95% of intraspecific comparisons
have divergences of 0–3.2%. The few values higher than
3.2% are conspicuous and probably due to misidentifications (Lampides boeticus, Neozephyrus japonicus, Arhopala
atosia, Agrodiaetus kendevani, see below), unrecognized
cryptic species (Agrodiaetus altivagans [41], Agrodiaetus
demavendi [30]), hybridization events (Meleageria marcida
[30,42]) or any of those (Agrodiaetus mithridates, Agrodiaetus merhaba).

The evidence for the possible misidentifications is the following:
• Lampides boeticus is the most widespread species of
Lycaenidae and a well-known migrant which occurs
throughout the Old World tropics and subtropics from
Africa and Eurasia to Australia and Hawaii. Apart from a
single unpublished sequence (AB192475), all other COI
GenBank sequences of this species (from Morocco, Spain
and Turkey) are identical with each other or only differ in
a single nucleotide (= 0.15% divergence). They are also
nearly identical to two specimens of Lampides boeticus in
the CBOL database (BOLD) [43] from Tanzania and
another sequence of this species from Papua New Guinea
(Wiemers, unpubl. data). The GenBank sequence
AB192475 (of unknown origin, but possibly from Japan),
however, differs strongly (8.2–8.7%) from all other Lampides boeticus sequences and therefore we assume this to
represent a distinct species. Its identity however remains a
mystery because it is not particularly close to any other
GenBank sequence and a request for a check of the
voucher specimen has remained unanswered for more
than a year.
• The questionable unpublished sequence of Neozephyrus
quercus (AB192476) is identical to a sequence of Favonius
orientalis and therefore probably represents this latter species which is very similar in phenotype but well differentiated genetically (4.8% divergence).
• A similar situation constitutes the questionable unpublished sequence of Arhopala atosia (AY236002) which is
very similar (0.4%) to a sequence of Arhopala epimuta.
• Agrodiaetus kendevani is a local endemic of the Elburs
Mts. in Iran. The two sequences of this species in the NCBI

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/8

database which exhibit a divergence of 5.4% have been
published in two different papers by the same work group
[29,44]. While one of them is identical to a sequence of
Agrodiaetus pseudoxerxes, the other one is nearly identical
to Agrodiaetus elbursicus (0.2% divergence). These latter
two species however belong to separate species groups
[30] and thus conspecificity of the two sequences of A.
kendevani is very improbable as there is no evidence of
hybridization between members of different species
groups in Agrodiaetus [30].
Higher intraspecific divergence values are also found
between North African and Eurasian populations of Polyommatus amandus (3.8%) and Polyommatus icarus (5.7–
6.8%). In the former species the North African population
is also well differentiated in phenotype (ssp. abdelaziz),
while in the latter species phenotypic differences have
never been noted. Cases with substantial, but lower
genetic divergence between North African and European
populations which do not correspond to differentiation
in phenotype also occur in the butterflies Iphiclides (podalirius) feisthamelii (2.1%; [30]) and Pararge aegeria (1.9%;
[45]). In all cases these allopatric populations may actually represent distinct species, although we do not currently have additional evidence in support of this
hypothesis.
Although some of the other higher divergence values >2%
are possibly due to cryptic species (e.g. in Agrodiaetus
demavendi) or hybridization between closely related species (e.g. in the species pair Lysandra corydonius and L. ossmar, as evidenced by the comparative analysis of the
nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer region ITS-2
[30]), most of those values represent cases in which there
is hardly any doubt regarding the conspecificity of samples. The highest such value is 2.9% between distant populations of the widespread Agrodiaetus damon (from Spain
and Russia). Outside the genus Agrodiaetus high values are
also found between North African and Iranian populations of Lycaena alciphron (2.7%), Spanish and Anatolian
populations of Polyommatus dorylas (2.3%) and even
between Polish and Slovakian populations of Maculinea
nausithous (2.3%). Table 1 lists mean intraspecific divergences in those species that are represented by more than
one individual in the data set.
Interspecific divergence
The average divergence in 236348 interspecific comparisons is 9.38% (SE = 3.65%) ranging from 0.0% to 23.2%
(between Baliochila minima and Agrodiaetus poseidon). Of
these, 57562 are congeneric comparisons with an average
divergence of 5.07% (SE = 1.73%) ranging from 0.0%
(between 23 Agrodiaetus as well as 3 Maculinea species
pairs) to 12.4% (between Arhopala abseus and Arhopala
ace). 94% of those comparisons are within Agrodiaetus.

Mean and range of intraspecific nucleotide divergences for 133 Lycaenidae species, using Kimura's two parameter model. The column "Monophyly" states if
conspecific sequences form a monophylum ("Mono"), a paraphylum ("Para") or a polyphylum ("Poly") and the subsequent column gives the corrected status (if
presumable errors are excluded and critical taxa are lumped together).

Only congeneric comparisons were included in subsequent analyses in order to make comparisons feasible
across taxonomic levels. Table 2 lists mean interspecific
divergences in genera of which at least two species are represented in the data set. Sequence divergence in 95% of
interspecific (congeneric) comparisons is above 1.9%,
and 87.6% of such comparisons reveal distances above
3%.
The barcode gap
As apparent in Figure 1 (and Figure 2 for comparisons
within Agrodiaetus only) no gap exists between intraspecific and interspecific divergences. Since some (0.14%)
interspecific divergences are as low as 0% no safe threshold can be set to strictly avoid false negatives. Although
species pairs with such low divergences include some
whose taxonomic status as distinct species is debatable,
they also include many pairs which are well differentiated
in phenotype, have a very different karyotype (in Agrodiaetus), and occur sympatrically without any evidence for
interbreeding. Examples include Agrodiaetus peilei – A.
morgani (0.0%), Agrodiaetus fabressei – A. ainsae (0.2%),
Agrodiaetus peilei – A. karindus (0.2%), Polyommatus myrrhinus – P. cornelia (0.4%), or Agrodiaetus poseidon – A.
hopfferi (0.6%).

The minimum cumulative error based on false positives
plus false negatives is 18% at a threshold level of 2.8%

(Figure 3). Minimum errors are very similar for Agrodiaetus (18.6% at 3.0% threshold, not shown) and other
Lycaenidae (18.6% at 2.0% threshold, not shown), but
much lower in Arhopala (5.3% at 3.4% threshold, Figure
4).
For safe identification, minimum distances between species (Figure 5) are critical and not average distances. In
Agrodiaetus, all but two species (= 98.3%) have close relatives with interspecific distances below 3%. In the other
genera combined, "only" 74% of taxa are affected but this
lower rate is probably due to undersampling and would
rise, if more sequences of more closely related species
become available for the analysis.
Identification with NJ tree profile
The approach of species identification with a NeighbourJoining (NJ) tree profile as proposed by [9] does not necessarily depend on the barcoding gap but on the coalescence of conspecific populations and the monophyly of
species (details see Data analysis).

The success rate in the identification of our Lycaenidae
data set with this method was 58%. Five out of 158 misidentifications or ambiguous identifications (3.2%) can be
attributed to incorrectly identified specimens (Lampides
boeticus, Neozephyrus japonicus, Agrodiaetus kendevani, see
above). Further 90 cases (57%) were among closely

related sister species whose taxonomic status is in dispute
(Table 3). If these cases are not taken into account (i.e.
counted as successful identifications, an unrealistic best
case scenario for barcoding success), the success rate
would rise to 84%. In Agrodiaetus the success rate would
remain lower (79%) while in the remaining genera it
would reach 91%. But even with these corrections, 61
cases of misidentifications (16%) remain, 46 of these in
Agrodiaetus (affected taxa in Table 4). The complete Neighbour-joining tree (available for download as additional
file 1: NJ-tree) shows the reason for this failure: Only 46%
of conspecific sequences form a monophyletic group on
this tree while the others are either paraphyletic (10%) or
even polyphyletic (44%). In Agrodiaetus, only 34% of species are monophyletic (Table 1), while the others are paraphyletic (11%) or polyphyletic (55%). If incorrectly
identified specimens are excluded and critical taxa (Table
3) are lumped together, still only 59% of species are
monophyletic (43% in Agrodiaetus) while 7% are paraphyletic and 34% polyphyletic (49% in Agrodiaetus).

Conclusion
We found an upper limit for intraspecific sequence divergences in a wide range of species of the diverse butterfly
family Lycaenidae, but no lower limit for interspecific

divergences and thus no barcoding gap. This result is especially well documented in the comprehensively sampled
genus Agrodiaetus (114 of ca 130 recognized species
sequenced) while the smaller overlap in Arhopala can be
attributed to the lower percentage of species sampled (33
of more than 200 species). The choice of species by [46]
was to maximize coverage of divergent clades while minimizing the total number of species which is a common
and sensible approach for phylogenetic studies, but
undermines the power of such sequence data as critical
tests for the barcoding approach. The general level of
sequence divergence is not exceptionally low in Lycaenidae compared to other Lepidoptera. The mean congeneric
interspecific sequence divergence of 5.1% in Lycaenidae
(5.1% in Agrodiaetus and 5.0% in the other genera) was
only slightly lower than the mean value of 6.6% found by
[2] in various families of Lepidoptera.
We thus confirm the results of Meyer & Paulay [17] and
Meier et al. [18]. Our results also agree with those from a
recent study in the Neotropical butterfly subfamily Ithomiinae (Nymphalidae) [47] which records highly variable
levels of divergence in mtDNA (COI &COII) between taxa
of the same rank. Our results however fail to agree with
those of Barrett & Hebert [9] on arachnids. In that study

Frequency distribution of intraspecific and interspecific (congeneric) genetic divergences in Agrodiaetus
Figure 2
Frequency distribution of intraspecific and interspecific (congeneric) genetic divergences in Agrodiaetus. Total
number of comparisons: 737 intraspecific and 54209 interspecific pairs across 114 Agrodiaetus species. Divergences were calculated using Kimura's two parameter (K2P) model.

the mean percent sequence divergence between congeneric species was 16.4% (SE = 0.13) and thus three times
higher than in our study while the divergence among conspecific individuals was only slightly higher with 1.4% (SE
= 0.16). The contradiction between our study and theirs
can be explained by the very incomplete and sparse taxon
sampling in their data set amounting to just 1% of the species contained within the families. We conclude that the
reported existence of a barcode gap in arachnids appears
to be an artifact based on insufficient sampling across
taxa.
Despite these difficulties, species identification of unidentified samples with the help of barcodes is entirely possible. The NJ tree profile approach which does not rely on a
barcode gap enabled the correct assignment of many
sequences, and other methods (e.g. applying population
genetic approaches) might further increase the success
rate. However, 17% of test sequences could still not be
identified correctly, even in some sympatric species pairs
which clearly differ in phenotype and chromosome
number (e.g. Agrodiaetus ainsae [n = 108–110]/fabressei [n
= 90], Agrodiaetus hopfferi [n = 15]/poseidon [n = 19–22]).
The main reason for this failure is that a large proportion
of species are not reciprocally monophyletic, e.g. due to

incomplete lineage sorting, which is in accordance with a
previous study [48]. Moreover, the success with this
method is again completely dependent on comprehensive
sampling. If the correct species is not included in the profile, the assignment must by necessity be incorrect and
misleading. Because of the non-existence of a barcoding
gap, this error will often be impossible to detect. This limits possible applications of the barcoding approach. For
example, cryptic species can only be detected with the
help of a barcoding approach at high genetic divergence
from all phenotypically similar species. An example is
Agrodiaetus paulae which was discovered in this way [41].
In contrast, and on the one hand, the sympatric species
pairs Agrodiaetus ainsae-fabressei, A. hopfferi-poseidon and A.
morgani-peilei would have gone unnoticed by barcoding
approaches even though their strong phenotypical and
karyological differentiation (n = 108 vs. n = 90, n = 15 vs.
n = 19–22 and n = 27 vs. n = 39, respectively) clearly indicates their specific distinctness. On the other hand,
sequence divergence in what is currently believed to represent one species does not per se prove the specific distinctness of the entities in question. In Polyommatus icarus
or P. amandus, for example, the high divergences between
North African and Eurasiatic samples is a strong hint for
the presence of unrecognized cryptic species, but this

needs to be rigorously tested with sequence data from
samples that cover the geographic range more comprehensively. Also in practical application the problem of
misidentified specimens and sequences in GenBank
remains a real threat to the accuracy of barcode-based
identifications. An example is the GenBank sequence
AB192475 of Lampides boeticus which is also used in the
CBOL database (see above). This underscores the importance of voucher specimens and documentation of locality data, an issue raised by barcoding supporters but
unfortunately still much neglected by GenBank. Another
case of misidentification (GenBank sequence AF170864
of Plebejus acmon which was originally submitted as Euphilotes bernardino) [30] has already been corrected with the
help of the voucher specimen.
In conclusion, the barcoding approach can be very helpful, e.g. in identifying early stages of insects or when only
fragments of individuals are available for analysis. However, correct identification requires that all eligible species
can be included in the profile and that sufficient information is available on the amount of intraspecific genetic
variation and genetic distance to closely related species.
The barcoding procedure is not very well suited for identifying species boundaries but it may help to give mini-

mum estimates of species numbers in very diverse and
inadequately known taxonomic groups at single localities.
Our case study on Agrodiaetus shows that a substantial
number of species would have gone unnoticed by the barcoding approach as 'false negatives'. Thus, especially in
clades where many species have evolved rapidly as a result
of massive radiations with minimum sequence divergence, the barcoding approach holds little promise of
meeting the challenge of rapid and reliable identification
of large samples. Yet, it is exactly these situations which
pose the most problematic tasks in the morphological
identification of insects.
Although molecular data can be helpful in discovering
new species, a large genetic divergence is not sufficient
proof since it must be corroborated by other data. Furthermore, most closely related species which are difficult to
identify with traditional means, are also similar genetically and would go unnoticed by an isolated barcoding
approach. Mathematical simulations have shown that
populations have to be isolated for more than 4 million
generations (i.e. 4 million years in the mostly univoltine
Agrodiaetus species) for two thresholds proposed by the
barcoding initiative (reciprocal monophyly, and a genetic
divergence between species which is 10 times greater than
within species) to achieve error rates less than 10% [49].

The optimum threshold value is 3.4%, where error is minimized at 5.3%.
This might help to explain why the barcoding approach
appears to be more successful in the Oriental genus Arhopala which is thought to represent a phylogenetically older
lineage of Lycaenidae estimated to be about 7–11 Million
years old [50], while the origin of the Palaearctic genus
Agrodiaetus is dated at only 2.5–3.8 Million years [44].
Our data show that the lack of a barcoding gap and reciprocal monophyly in Lycaenidae is not confined to the
genus Agrodiaetus with its extraordinary interspecific variation in chromosome numbers, but also to other genera
of Lycaenidae with stable chromosome numbers. It
should also be noted that in Agrodiaetus there is neither
evidence for exceptional rapid radiation as in cichlids of
the East African lakes [51] nor for unusual (i.e. sympatric)
speciation patterns caused by karyotype evolution.
Rather, karyotype diversification seems to have been a
mere by-product of the usual mode of allopatric speciation [29,30,44].

Methods
Data sources
A total of 694 barcode sequences were used for our analysis. We used a 690 bp fragment at the 5' end of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of 309 Lycaenidae
sequences from a molecular phylogenetic study by Wiem-

ers [30]. Most sequences belong to Agrodiaetus (198), the
others (111) mostly to closely related Polyommatinae. All
sequences have been deposited in GenBank [52]
AY556869-AY556963,
(AY556844-AY556867,
AY556965-AY557155) with LinkOuts provided to images
of the voucher specimens deposited with MorphBank
[53]. These sequences were supplemented by 385 further
sequences of Lycaenidae deposited in GenBank as of
March, 2006 (Table 5). They include sequences from further studies on Agrodiaetus [29,44], the Palaearctic genus
Maculinea [54], Nearctic Lycaeides melissa [55], the Oriental genus Arhopala [46,50], the Australian genera Acrodipsas [56] and Jalmenus [57], and the South African
Chrysoritis [58] as well as a few sequences which have only
been used as outgroups in non-Lycaenidae studies (e.g.
[59,60]). Sequence length in the 5' region as defined by
CBOL ranged between 240 bp and the maximum of 987
bp. (18 COI sequences from a study on Japonica only contained a 3'end fragment and therefore were not included.)
Of these, 89% are at least 648 bp long as recommended
by CBOL and 98% at least 500 bp long which is deemed
sufficient for barcode sequences [13]. However, sequence
overlap for sequences from different studies was sometimes lower because of slightly different sequence locations within the barcode region (Figure 6). It should be
noted that these inconsistencies in barcode comparisons

mouse tail tissue. In a few cases only dried material was
available and either thorax or legs were used for DNA
extraction.

Amplification of DNA was conducted using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The reaction mixture (for a total
reaction volume of 25 µl) included: 1 µl DNA, 16.8 µl

ddH20, 2.5 µl 10 × PCR II buffer, 3.2 µl 25 mM MgCl2,
0.5 µl 2 mM dNTP-Mix, 0.25 µl Taq Polymerase and 0.375

Initial 4 minutes denaturation at 94°C and 35 cycles of 30
seconds denaturation at 94°C, 30 seconds annealing at
55°C and 1 minute extension at 72°C.
PCR products were purified using purification kits from
Promega® or Sigma® and checked with agarose gel electrophoresis before and after purification.

is not necessarily the best model to analyze the data (see
[64]), but it was chosen to facilitate comparisons with
other barcode studies of Hebert and co-workers [1,912,16] who have been using this model. Distance tables
were processed to calculate divergence means (incl. standard errors and ranges) within and between species.

Cycle sequencing was carried out on Biometra® T-Gradient
or ABI Biosystems® GeneAmp® PCR-System 2700 thermal
cyclers using sequencing kits of MWG Biotech® (for Li-cor®
automated sequencer) or ABI Biosystems® (for ABI® 377
automated sequencer) according to the manufacturers'
protocols and with the following cycling times: initial 2
minutes denaturation at 95°C and 35 cycles of 15 seconds
denaturation at 95°C, 15 seconds annealing at 49°C and
15 seconds extension at 70°C. Primers used were the
same as for the PCR reactions for the ABI (primer 1 was
used for forward and primer 2 for independent reverse
sequencing), but for Li-cor truncated and labelled primers
were used with 3 bases cut off at the 5' end and labelled
with IRD-800. For ABI sequencing the products were
cleaned using an ethanol precipitation protocol. Electrophoresis of sequencing reaction products was carried out
on Li-cor® or ABI® 377 automated sequencers using the
manufacturer's protocols.

The taxonomy was taken from GenBank in most cases but
two minor spelling inconsistencies were corrected. In four
cases where a taxon within Agrodiaetus was treated as a
species taxon by one author but only as a subspecies by
another, we matched them by treating those taxa as distinct species. The generic subdivision of Lycaenidae is very
much in flux. Some genera are only treated as subgenera
by some authors and many genera (like Polyommatus or
Plebejus) are probably paraphyletic or polyphyletic, however we undertook no revision of the GenBank taxonomy
since it appeared consistent enough for our analysis. The
remaining inconsistencies only affect few taxa in our analysis and include the treatment of Sublysandra (distinct
genus or subgenus of Polyommatus), Eumedonia (distinct
genus or subgenus of Aricia), Otnjukovia (synonym to
Turanana), Maculinea (synonym to Phengaris) and Callipsyche (synonym to Satyrium). (A complete list of sequences
with corresponding taxa names and voucher numbers is
found in the additional file 1: NJ tree.)

Data analysis
Sequences were aligned with BioEdit 7.0.4.1 [62] and
pruned to a maximum of 987 bp, the section proposed by
CBOL for barcoding. Pairwise sequence divergences were
calculated separately for intraspecific as well as for interspecific, but intrageneric comparisons with Mega 3.1 [63]
using Kimura's two parameter (K2P) distance model. This

A Lycaenidae species profile was created according to [9].
Of the 694 barcode sequences, we excluded 9 short Arhopala sequences with a barcode length of only 240 bp. (To
check the position of those sequences, a separate analysis
was run containing only the Arhopala sequences.) Of the
remaining 685 sequences, we randomly selected 1
sequence from each of the 308 Lycaenidae species for

inclusion into a COI species profile. We chose a sequence
of Apodemia mormo (GenBank accession number
AF170863) from the family Riodinidae as outgroup
because this family appears to represent the sister group to
Lycaenidae [65-67]. The other 377 sequences which had
not been included in the profile were used as "test"
sequences: They were singly added to the test profile in
repeated Neighbour-joining analyses and their "classification success" was recorded. A test was recorded as successful if the test sequence grouped most closely with the
conspecific profile sequence and not with another species.
Results of three GenBank sequences which were not identified to species level (all belonging to the genus Agrodiaetus) were not counted. After the classification test, another
NJ analysis was run including all sequences in order to
understand possible failures in classification. The main

reason for using the Neighbour-joining as a tree-building
method is its computational efficiency. Although this
method is well suited for grouping closely related
sequences, it should be noted that other methods (such as
Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian
inference of phylogeny) are usually superior in constructing phylogenetic trees.
