Abstract
Background: The Notch signaling pathway is fundamental to the regulation of many cell fate
decisions in eumetazoans. Not surprisingly, members of this pathway are highly conserved even
between vertebrates and invertebrates. There is one notable exception, Hairless, which acts as a
general Notch antagonist in Drosophila. Hairless silences Notch target genes by assembling a
repressor complex together with Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and the co-repressors Groucho
(Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). Now with the availability of genomic databases,
presumptive Hairless homologues are predicted, however only in insect species. To further our
understanding of Hairless structure and function, we have cloned the Hairless gene from Apis
mellifera (A.m.H) and characterized its functional conservation in Drosophila.
Results: The Apis Hairless protein is only one third of the size of the Drosophila orthologue.
Interestingly, the defined Suppressor of Hairless binding domain is interrupted by a nonconserved
spacer sequence and the N-terminal motif is sufficient for binding. In contrast to Apis Hairless, the
Drosophila orthologue contains a large acidic domain and we provide experimental evidence that
this acidic domain is necessary to silence Hairless activity in vivo. Despite the dramatic size
differences, Apis Hairless binds to the Drosophila Hairless interactors Su(H), Gro, CtBP and
Pros26.4. Hence, Apis Hairless assembles a repressor complex with Drosophila components that
may have a different topology. Nevertheless, Apis Hairless is sufficient to repress the Notch target
gene vestigial in Drosophila. Moreover, it is able to rescue Hairless mutant phenotypes, providing in
vivo evidence for its function as a bona fide Notch antagonist.
Conclusion: This is the first interspecies-complementation analysis of the Hairless gene. Guided
by evolutionary comparisons, we hope to eventually identify all the relevant structural domains and
cofactors of Hairless, thereby opening an avenue for further insights into the repressor-complexes
that down-regulate Notch signaling also in other, higher eukaryotes.

Background
Cell to cell communication is essential for development
and cellular differentiation of metazoans. The communication is established by signaling pathways that allow

information to be sent from one cell to a neighboring cell.
This information enables the receiving cell to adopt a different cell fate. One of the best studied signaling pathways
that coordinate developmental decisions is the Notch

pathway [1-3]. It was first described in the process of lateral inhibition in Drosophila: within a cluster of equipotential cells destined to adopt the same cell fate, one cell
gains the ability to inhibit adjacent cells to engage differentiation by means of activating Notch. Notch signaling
also plays important roles in asymmetric cell divisions
that result in differential cell fate decisions [4-6]. Moreover, local Notch activity can induce the formation of
developmental boundaries as seen during wing margin
formation in Drosophila [7-9].
It is not surprising that this fundamental pathway is
highly conserved in eumetazoans and is crucial at many
different developmental stages in a variety of different tissues [1,2]. The pathway is initiated by the binding of the
ligands, Delta or Serrate (Delta-like and Jagged in mammals), presented on one cell to the Notch receptor on the
adjacent cells. As a consequence, the intracellular Notch
domain is cleaved and migrates into the nucleus, where it
forms a transcriptional activator complex by binding,
together with co-activators, e.g. Mastermind (Mam), to
the transcriptional regulator CSL (CSF or RBP-Jκ in mammals, Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H) in Drosophila and
Lag-2 in Caenorhabditis) [3]. CSL belongs to the family of
rel DNA binding molecules and allows for context specific
transcriptional activation of target genes of the Notch signaling pathway [10]. In Drosophila, Hairless (H) acts as a
general antagonist of this pathway. H binds to Su(H) and,
by recruiting the co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), converts Su(H) into a
repressor of the Notch target genes [11-14]. In this complex H acts as molecular linker between Su(H) and the corepressors. Since H retains repressor activity even in the
absence of co-repressor binding, it is thought that it
impedes formation of the Notch-Su(H)-Mam activatorcomplex on its own [12].
Given the high conservation of Notch signaling components, e.g. the human and fly CSL orthologues share
approximately 80% identity over large parts [15], one
might expect a H homologue to likewise antagonize
Notch signaling in mammals. However all attempts from
many groups including ours failed so far to identify a vertebrates H gene. With the rational that sequences mostly
relevant for H function should be conserved over larger
evolutionary distance, we started to search for H genes in
further remote species. Our molecular analysis of the H
orthologue from the distantly related Drosophila hydei species revealed that H is indeed a relatively fast evolving
gene [16]. Hence, H functional domains may have
evolved beyond recognition over time or may be present
in different molecules in mammalian species. With more
and more genome sequences available, we could identify
H-like genes in several insect species. From the available
genomic sequence projects, we characterized H ortho-

logues and found that the A. mellifera Hairless gene
(A.m.H) is a good candidate to investigate H structure and
function in more detail. The phylogenetic distance from
Drosophila to Apis is estimated at 250–300 million years
and is considerably greater than to Anopheles (Fig. 1A)
[17]. In contrast to the Anopheles H gene, which is larger
than the Drosophila orthologue D.m.H, the Apis H gene is
much smaller. Moreover, the honeybee brain sequencing
project confirmed that A.m.H is expressed in honeybee.
We cloned the gene from an Apis mellifera cDNA library
and tested A.m.H gene function in D. melanogaster. Notably, the orthologous proteins are only 54% identical, and
A.m.H is only about 36% of the size of D.m.H. Despite
the small size, A.m.H contains the characteristic interaction domains and is able to bind to the Drosophila proteins Su(H), Gro, CtBP and Pros26.4 as does D.m.H. Most
surprisingly, A.m.H retains functional activity in the fly,
where it can rescue H loss of function mutant phenotypes.
Moreover, when overexpressed, A.m.H induces typical H
gain of function phenotypes indicative of antagonizing
Notch signaling in a variety of tissues and developmental
processes. Considering the vast size difference, a repressor
complex assembled by A.m.H might have a different
topology than that of Drosophila. Nevertheless, A.m.H is
sufficient to repress the Notch target gene vestigial during
wing development of Drosophila. In contrast to A.m.H, the
Drosophila H protein contains a large acidic domain and
we provide experimental evidence that this acidic domain
silences H activity in vivo. Finally, our work shows that the
Su(H) binding domain previously defined in D.m.H can
be separated into two distinct domains, and that the Nterminal domain is sufficient for Su(H) binding. In summary, our work provides evidence for the in vivo function
of Apis Hairless as a bona fide antagonist of Notch signaling. This evolutionary comparison may help us to eventually identify all the relevant structural domains and
cofactors of Hairless, thereby furthering our understanding of the repressor-complexes that down-regulate Notch
signaling.

Results
Established structural domains of H are well conserved in
insect evolution
The H gene encodes a general antagonist of the Notch signaling pathway in D. melanogaster, where it plays a central
role in repressing Notch target genes [18]. There is ample
genetic evidence showing that H is involved in manifold
developmental processes in Drosophila. So far it remains
open, whether this reflects solely its central role in Notch
signaling or whether H is involved in other pathways as
well. H is a novel protein that is quite large and may contain more than the already established functional
domains. A comparison with the orthologues from D.
hydei (D.h.H) and A. gambiae (A.g.H) identified several
conserved domains of presumed functional significance

[11,16]. Experimental analysis of D. hydei showed that the
D.h.H protein with 1158 residues is somewhat larger than
the D.m.H orthologue that spans 1077 amino acids
[16,19,20]. The A.g.H is even larger and comprises
approximately 1300 residues based on an in silico prediction (see Additional file 1). Meanwhile several additional
genome sequences have been published. The available
databases show that H orthologues are present in all Drosophilids (see Additional file 1) and several other dipterans, as well as in other insect orders including
Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera that are considerably further diverged (see Additional file 1). However, to date we could not detect clear H orthologues in
species others than insect species, even when using the
most highly conserved H domains (see below). The phylogenetic distance between Nematocera dipterans, like A.
gambiae and A. aegypti, and the Cyclorrapha to which Drosophilidae belong, is about 200 – 250 millions years,
whereas about 250 – 300 million years are estimated
between dipterans and the other insect orders [17] (Fig.
1A). A comparison of the presumptive H orthologues
reveals a surprisingly high degree of divergence and highlights conserved domains all the more. These domains
characterize the H protein and its function. They include
the Su(H) binding domain (SBD), the Gro binding
domain (GBD) and, at the very C-terminus a binding
sequence for CtBP (CBD) that are remarkably well conserved (Fig. 1B–D). The SBD maps to D.m.H residues 232
to 337, a region that is nearly identical in all Drosophilids
(Fig. 1B; see Additional file 1) [16]. However, in further
diverged insects including Anopheles the SBD is split by a
less well conserved stretch (Fig. 1B; see Additional file 1).
The GBD has been mapped to nine residues in D. melanogaster [11,12]. It is extremely well conserved in the
insect H orthologues (Fig. 1C). The CBD is nearly invariant (Fig. 1D).
The structure of the SBD in the further diverged insects led
us to address whether the entire region is needed for
Su(H) binding (Fig. 1E). In fact we found that the N-terminal portion (NT, L171 to S270) was sufficient for Su(H)
binding, in agreement with earlier results [21] and bound
as well as the entire SBD (NT-CT, L171 to H357). In contrast,
the C-terminal portion (CT, R267 to H357) did not bind to
Su(H) (Fig. 1E).
The H orthologue from Apis mellifera
To further our understanding of H function, we analyzed
the Apis mellifera H gene (A.m.H) in more detail. Since
there was neither a good annotation of the A.m.H gene
nor a complete EST sequence available, we cloned A.m.H
from an Apis cDNA library. However, the largest clone
missed the start codon by 22 bases as predicted from an
incomplete EST-sequence (see Methods). For subsequent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/175

in vivo analyses, we extended this cDNA clone by in vitro
mutagenesis (Fig. 2A).
The A.m.H cDNA spans a total of 2726 bp; it contains two
introns at positions identical to D.m.H (Fig. 2C). The
cDNA has an open reading frame of 392 codons, which is
only ~36% of D.m.H. Accordingly, the calculated molecular weight of A.m.H protein is ~44.5 kDa, whereas that
of D.m.H is ~110 kDa.
Despite its small size, A.m.H contains the characteristic H
protein domains, i.e. the SBD, the GBD and the CBD, and
they are well conserved (Figs 1, 2). Three nuclear localization signals are predicted in D.m.H; two are identical in
A.m.H, the third is slightly variant (Fig. 2C). D.m.H is a
highly basic protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.4;
A.m.H is likewise basic with a pI of 10.85. Both proteins
contain acidic stretches, however, only the one located
within the SBD is conserved (red arrow in Fig. 2B). Unlike
D.m.H, the honeybee H protein does not contain the large
acidic domain downstream of the SBD (Fig. 2B, asterisk).
Using the standard parameters of the BESTFIT program,
the two orthologues share 54% identity. Under relaxed
conditions that allow an overall alignment, the two protein sequences are 70% similar and 63% identical (see
Methods).
A.m.H protein recapitulates D.m.H protein-protein
interactions
The three H domains SBD, GBD and CBD serve as binding
sites for the proteins Su(H), Gro and CtBP, respectively. In
addition, the C-terminal half of D.m.H was shown to bind
to the N-terminal half of Pros26.4, which is one of six
AAA-ATPases that form the base of the 19S proteasome
regulatory subunit [22].

The most central feature of H activity is the binding to
Su(H). Hence, we first tested whether A.m.H is able to
bind to D.m.Su(H). This was not certain since the A.m.H
SBD shows just 79% similarity and 72% identity to the
Drosophila SBD (Fig. 1B). However, full length A.m.H
bound to D.m.Su(H), whereas a N-terminally truncated
protein that lacks the SBD, A.m.H 4-1 did not (Fig. 3).
The GBDs of A.m.H and D.m.H are 80% identical and
90% similar (Fig. 1C). However, binding of full length
A.m.H protein to D.m.Gro protein was not seen in the
yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). This was unsurprising,
since full length D.m.H binds rather weakly to Gro,
whereas it binds very strongly to a short peptide containing the GBD [12]. Likewise, strong binding was observed
with a corresponding small peptide (S262 to P309) spanning the A.m.H GBD, as well as with the N-terminally
truncated A.m.H 4-1 construct (Fig. 3). The specificity of
the interaction was confirmed by a point mutation within

mutant; GBD, Gro-binding domain only; GBD*, mutant construct. Dm-Su(H) and Dm-S4-1 were in pJG; Dm-Gro and DmCtBP in VP16 vectors. Empty vectors served as controls. Blue color denotes positive interactions as it reflects activation of the
lacZ-reporter gene.

the A.m.H GBD: an exchange of Tyrosine 264 to Alanine
was sufficient to completely abrogate binding to Gro (Fig.
3), just like the corresponding mutation in D. melanogaster
[12]. The weak binding of Gro to full length H proteins
from either species may perhaps result from the three
dimensional structure of H which then must be likewise
retained by the tiny A.m.H protein.
The CBD of honeybee and fly H orthologues are identical
(Fig. 1D). Therefore, the observed strong interaction
between A.m.H and D. melanogaster CtBP was expected
(Fig. 3). Mutation of A.m.H CBD* completely eliminated
binding to D.m.CtBP (Fig. 3) just like the respective
D.m.H mutation [12], confirming the specificity the
A.m.H CBD. Finally, we tested interaction of A.m.H with
Pros26.4. As shown in Fig. 3, the full length A.m.H as well
as the N-terminally truncated A.m.H 4-1 both bound to
the N-terminal part of Pros26.4 (Dm-S4-1), just like
D.m.H. The Pros26.4 binding domain in D.m.H maps
roughly between the GBD and the CBD [21]. Interestingly, this region of A.m.H is only 21% of the D.m.H size
and contains very few similarities. This comparison will
aid to identify the relevant sequences involved in this
interaction.
Activity of A.m.H in Drosophila melanogaster
Mutations in the H gene are haplo-insufficient in Drosophila resulting in a dominant phenotype with reduced
numbers of macro- and microchaete and gaps in wing
veins [23-25]. Bristle loss can be rescued to about 75% of
the wild type numbers by a D.m.H gene under the control
of a heat shock promoter (hs) at ambient temperature

[26,27]. We investigated whether A.m.H can replace
D.m.H function in HP8 null mutants. Three independent
hs-AmH lines were analyzed. Indeed, a rescue of total
macrochaete-loss of 36% was achieved. Moreover, the
strongest line restored 62% of the macrochaete on the
notum (Fig. 4; Table 1). These data indicate that A.m.H

can largely replace D.m.H activity despite the dramatic
structural difference between the two proteins.
Overexpression of H causes phenotypes opposite of the H
loss of function mutants owing to impairment of Notch
signaling. Dependent on the time point of H overexpression (Fig. 5A), ectopic bristles (primarily microchaete),
bristle loss or shaft duplications are observed [27,28].
Ectopic bristles form from extra sensory organ precursors
that arise when Notch-mediated lateral inhibition is
blocked. Indeed, furry flies are generated if hs-AmH is
induced during late third larval instar to early pupal stages
(Fig. 5B, C). These ectopic sense organs contain the full
complement of cells, since we find the corresponding
neurons and thecogens in pupal nota (Fig. 5B', C'). The
outer bristle organ is derived from the pIIa daughter cell,
which is generated by a Notch dependent unequal division of the sensory organ precursor cell (Fig. 5A). Repressing this step during midpupal stages causes a
transformation to inner cell fates at the expense of outer
cell fates (pIIa to pIIb; Fig. 5A, D) [6,28]. Accordingly, we
find bald patches on the outside (Fig. 5D) and pair-wise
duplication of inner cell types (neuron plus thecogen)
(Fig. 5D'). Finally, Notch signaling is required to differentiate the socket from the shaft cell and the thecogen from
the neuron. If these late steps are impeded by overexpression of A.m.H, a socket to shaft transformation (Fig. 5E)
and a thecogen to neuron transformation (Fig. 5D', E') is
the consequence. Overall, overexpression of A.m.H has
the same effects on bristle development as that of D.m.H
[26,27]. In addition to the bristle phenotypes, wing phenotypes similar to those of hs-DmH were observed (Fig.
5F, G) [27]. These include irregularities in the bristle pattern along the wing margin, as well as thickened veins that
frequently end in broadened deltas (Fig. 5G). In addition
to these well characterized phenotypes, we noted an elongation of the entire wing along the proximo-distal axis giving the wings a lanceolate appearance (Fig. 5F, G).

Tissue specific repression of Notch signaling in Drosophila
melanogaster by Apis H
Notch signaling is involved in a plethora of developmental processes; a well studied example is the formation of
the wing margin. During larval life, the presumptive wing
margin is established in the wing imaginal disc by activation of the Notch pathway along a dorso-ventral boundary. A number of Notch target genes are subsequently
activated including wingless, vestigial and cut, that are critical for patterning and outgrowth of the wing as well as
the specification of wing marginal cells [9,29-31]. If
Notch activity is down-regulated in the respective cells,
adult wings are incised as exemplified in heterozygous
Notch mutants [25]. Likewise, wing margin defects
develop if D.m.H is overexpressed in a spatially and temporally regulated manner in larval wing discs due to a
local down-regulation of Notch activity [12,31,32]. Using
the Gal4-UAS system [33], A.m.H was locally overexpressed using the omb-Gal4 driver line that drives expression in the central part of larval wing discs. This caused
extremely deep incisions in the adult wing, and the central
wing blade was completely absent (Fig. 6A). Quite surprisingly, A.m.H is able to convert Su(H) into a repressor
even more efficiently as D.m.H in the context of wing
margin formation (Fig. 7). In Drosophila, this conversion
is largely dependent on the co-repressors Gro and CtBP
[12]. Accordingly, mutant UAS-AmH constructs defective
in either binding of Gro (UAS-AmHG*), of CtBP (UASAmHC*), or both (UAS-AmHGC*) (Fig. 3) were overexpressed. For each construct at least three independent
lines were analyzed that gave similar results. Although we
cannot exclude quantitative differences in the expression
levels of individual lines, the phenotypic differences were
very consistent. UAS-AmHG* caused a less extreme wing
nicking than full length A.m.H (Fig. 6A), albeit the phenotype was still very strong and clearly stronger than
obtained with D.m.H. Much weaker phenotypes were
obtained upon overexpression of AmHC* and even
weaker with AmHGC* (Fig. 6A), in accordance with the
idea that both co-repressors are required for H repressor
activity [12,34]. As already noted for D.m.H, CtBP seems
to be the more important co-repressor since loss of CtBP

Figureoverexpression antagonizes Notch signaling in the process of bristle and wing development
A.m.H 5
A.m.H overexpression antagonizes Notch signaling in the process of bristle and wing development. A) Scheme
of bristle organ development. After being singled out from a proneural cluster by lateral inhibition, a sensory organ precursor
(SOP) divides unequally to produce two daughter cells (pIIa, pIIb), destined for outer and inner cell fate, respectively. pIIa gives
rise to shaft and socket cells, and pIIb eventually to neuron and thecogen. A Notch signal is required for proper designation of
cells depicted in red color. B) Thorax of a wild type fly. Note typical arrangement of macrochaete and regular spacing of microchaete, each consisting of a shaft and a socket. B') The underlying cell pair consists of a thecogen (red) and a neuron (light
blue). Size bar; 10 μm. C) Early heat induction (black dash; about 5 days after egg deposition) of hs-AmH during larval to pupal
transition interferes with lateral inhibition. As a result ectopic SOPs form, each giving rise to a complete bristle organ. Accordingly, additional thecogen/neuron pairs are detected inside (C'; size as in B'). The resultant flies are furry compared to the wild
type. D) Later heat shock (blue dash; about 5 days 18 hours after egg deposition) leads to a transformation of outer pIIa to
inner pIIb cell fate. Accordingly, neither shafts nor sockets develop, and the flies have bald patches. D') As expected, additional
inner cell pairs of thecogen (red) and neuron (light blue) develop (arrow). Moreover, a transformation of thecogen to neuron
is observed, giving rise to a neuron doublet (arrowhead). Same size as in B'. E) Heat shock at an even later phase (red dash;
about 6 days after egg deposition) causes socket to shaft transformation most easily seen on the head. Consequently, two
shafts arise from a bristle organ (black arrowhead). A partial transformation of the socket gives the appearance of a triple shaft
(white arrowhead). E') Transformation of inner cell types, thecogen to neuron, is observed as well. In extreme cases, all four
bristle cells are transformed to neurons (light blue), giving rise a neuron quadruple (arrow). Size is as in B'. F) The wing of a
control fly shows the five longitudinal veins that end thinly at the margin (see enlargement F'). Mechano- and chemosensory
bristles cover the anterior, and hairs the posterior wing margin in a regular pattern (anterior is up). G) Heat induction of hsAmH affects the veins, now ending in typical deltas (arrowhead; see enlargement G'), and the bristles as described above, leaving the impression of a 'sloppy' margin (arrow). In addition, the wing is elongated along the proximo-distal axis, giving it a more
lanceolate overall appearance.

binding reduces H activity more strongly than loss of Gro
binding. Notably, overexpression of AmHGC* resulted in
shortened longitudinal veins L4 and L5 (Fig. 6A) like
DmHGC* [12]. This phenotype is very similar to the
dominant wing phenotype of H mutants, raising the possibility of dominant negative effects. Interestingly the
AmHGC* double mutant still retains notable repressor
activity as seen by the incisions of the wing margin that are
caused by its overexpression (Fig. 6A). Hence, A.m.H is
able to antagonize Notch signaling independent of corepressors Gro and CtBP as was noticed before with the
Drosophila orthologue [12]. Because the small size of
A.m.H leaves little room for additional binding domains,
it seems not very likely that other, yet unidentified corepressors confer this repressor activity. Perhaps, some
Notch target genes require co-repressors for full silencing
whereas others like vg do not. In the latter cases, H may
directly interfere with the recruitment of intracellular
Notch or Mam to the activation complex.
Apis H represses transcription of vestigial in D.
melanogaster
vestigial (vg) is one of the Notch target genes that is activated along the dorso-ventral boundary in the wing imaginal disc and that is important for boundary formation
and wing growth [30]. Notch signals activate vg expression via the vg boundary enhancer (vgBE) that contains a
Su(H) binding site [29]. The activity of this element is
restricted to the dorso-ventral boundary by the Su(H)Notch activation complex [29] and is repressed in adjacent cells by the Su(H)-H co-repressor complex [12].

Transgenic flies carrying a lacZ reporter gene under the
control of vgBE (vgBE-lacZ) [29] were used to study the
ability of A.m.H to regulate D.m.vg transcription dependent on Drosophila co-repressors Gro and CtBP (Fig. 6B).
Cells overexpressing A.m.H protein were labeled with
anti-A.m.H antibodies (Fig. 6B). Compared to the normal
expression of the lacZ-reporter gene, beta-galactosidase
was almost completely absent in areas, where full length
A.m.H was overexpressed, reflecting its repressor activity
on the vgBE enhancer element. At the same time, the presumptive wing blade was notably distorted (Fig. 6B),
which is typical of full length D.m.H overexpression [12].
Overexpression of AmHG*, resulted in a likewise inhibition of vgBE-lacZ expression, however, the wing disc had
only little or no morphological defects (Fig. 6B). In contrast, mutation of the CBD interfered strongly with A.m.H
repressor activity, since overexpression of AmHC* caused
only a small gap in the vgBE-lacZ pattern (Fig. 6B). In the
absence of co-repressor binding (AmHGC*), no or very
little down-regulation of vgBE-lacZ was observed (Fig. 6B).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/175

The acidic domain in Drosophila H attenuates its
repressor activity
Since the rescue capacities of the heat shock A.m.H constructs were reduced compared to similar D.m.H constructs, we were surprised by the strong wing defects of the
omb-Gal4>UAS-AmH flies (see Fig. 6A). These phenotypes were much stronger than those effected by a likewise
overexpression of UAS-DmH (Fig. 7B, C) [12]. What
could be the reason? Despite the much smaller size of
A.m.H, the overall organization of the two orthologues is
similar. There is, however, a striking difference with regard
to a large acidic domain (AD) in D.m.H just C-terminal of
the SBD (Fig. 7A), which is completely absent from A.m.H
(Fig. 2B). Our earlier work suggested that the acidic
domain might attenuate H repressor activity in Drosophila
[27]. To strengthen this hypothesis, we generated the
D.m.H UAS-HΔC3 and UAS-HΔAD constructs both lacking the acidic domain (Fig. 7A). Both constructs were
overexpressed using the omb-Gal4 driver line. As shown
in Fig. 7D and 7E, D.m.H protein lacking the acidic
domain is much more potent than full length D.m.H or
A.m.H. The resultant wings are barely recognized as such
since only the hinge region is present (HΔAD; Fig. 7D) or
little of the wing blade remains (HΔC3; Fig. 7E). The fact
that HΔC3 gives milder phenotypes than HΔAD suggests
that regions important for normal H repressor activity are
lost in this larger deletion as well. These findings strongly
support the notion that the acidic domain antagonizes the
repressor activity of D.m.H. Hence, the stronger overexpression phenotypes obtained with A.m.H in the wing
nicely fit this hypothesis because of the missing acidic
stretch in the Apis H orthologue.

Notch is required for the correct development of a multitude of tissues owing to its involvement in cell growth,
cell death and cell differentiation [1,2,35]. Accordingly,
overexpression of D.m.H interferes amongst others with
growth and patterning of the eye, the wing, the leg and
other appendages, dorsal closure of the thorax and bristle
specification on the entire body [28-32,36-38]. A.m.H
shows the same variety of overexpression phenotypes
indicating that it acts as a bona fide Notch antagonist in
all known Notch dependent processes (see Figs 8, 9). We
note, however, that in most tissues, overexpression of
A.m.H resulted in weaker phenotypes than that of D.m.H
suggesting a specific role of the acidic domain of D.m.H
during wing development.

Discussion
Comparison of A.m.H and D.m.H peptide sequence
Most strikingly, A.m.H is roughly a third of the size of
D.m.H. A closer look at the D.m.H sequence reveals many
poly-residues stretches, notably poly-Alanine, poly-Serine
and poly-Asparagine, which are absent in A.m.H, challenging their functional importance. Moreover, A.m.H

A.m.H recruits Drosophila co-repressorsand downregulates transcription of the Notch target gene vestigial. A)
Wild type and mutant A.m.H constructs that are deficient in binding Gro, CtBP or both as schematically depicted, were overexpressed in the central wing blade using the omb-Gal4 driver line. Overexpression of these constructs results in deep wing
incisions, ranging from nearly complete loss of the wing blade to large notches. Note shortening of longitudinals L4 and L5
upon overexpression of UAS-AmHGC* which cannot recruit any co-repressor (arrowheads). Control flies are omb-Gal4 ×
UAS-lacZ. Wings are from female flies reared in parallel at 25°C. B) Wild type and mutant A.m.H constructs as depicted above
were overexpressed in the central wing domain with omb-Gal4 at 25°C. Expression of the vgBE-lacZ reporter gene was determined by anti-beta-galactosidase staining (green). The control disc (omb-Gal4; vgBE-lacZ) shows the typical expression in a thin
strip of cells along the dorso-ventral boundary (green). Ectopic expression of A.m.H (red nuclear staining) completely
represses vg-transcription (arrowhead) within the A.m.H overexpression domain (outlined with yellow dots). Lack of Gro corepressor binding (AmHG*) interferes only little with vg-repression, whereas CtBP is clearly more important for H repressor
activity (AmHC* and AmHGC*). Expression of A.m.H protein was monitored with antisera (red nuclear staining). Note disturbed wing disc morphology of omb-Gal4>UAS-AmH animals (arrow).

lacks the large acidic domain that attenuates D.m.H
repressor activity. Accordingly, overexpression of A.m.H
causes more severe defects than D.m.H, most notably during wing margin formation. However, deletion of the
D.m.H acidic domain results in an even more active protein (Fig. 7), demonstrating two important points: on one
hand, the acidic domain is a necessary functional domain
of Hairless in Drosophila that is absent in the honeybee.
On the other hand, A.m.H is less active in Drosophila compared to the endogenous D.m.H protein.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/175

We noted one additional larger conserved domain of
unknown function upstream of GBD (Fig. 2C). It contains
a highly conserved nuclear localization signal, which may
be the primary reason for the conservation. Other than
that, there are only a few very small conserved sequence
stretches between the H orthologues from Apis and fly and
they are not conserved between Drosophila and Tribolium
or Anopheles (see Additional file 1). Hence it seems
unlikely that they are of functional relevance. With respect
to the phylogenetic distance and great divergence of the
Apis H gene, the remaining activity of A.m.H is quite
remarkable. It is able to rescue the dominant HP8 mutant
phenotype and can reproduce if overexpressed largely all
phenotypes that are obtained by the overexpression of
D.m.H protein (Figs 4, 5, 6; Figs 8, 9). Hence, A.m.H acts
as a bone fide antagonist of Notch signaling in Drosophila.
Since H is a multi-functional protein, this can only be possible if A.m.H protein is able to interact genetically and
physically with the components provided by Drosophila.
A.m.H assembles a functional repression complex on
Notch target genes using Drosophila components
Interaction of A.m.H with Drosophila proteins was tested
with two powerful approaches, the yeast two-hybrid assay
and even more convincingly, a direct in vivo assay in the
fly. So far, we know of four direct H interaction partners
in Drosophila, Su(H), Gro, CtBP and Pros26.4 [1113,21,22]. Recent data provide evidence that H assembles
a repressor complex on Notch target genes by linking
Su(H) with the two co-repressors Gro and CtBP. Binding
of H to the Pros26.4 subunit of the proteasome is unrelated to Notch signaling [11,12]. However, it reduces H
protein stability. Therefore, Pros26.4 indirectly plays a
positive role in the Notch signaling pathway [22]. Our
data show that A.m.H physically interacts with any of
these four Drosophila proteins in an in vitro assay. Moreover, we show that relevant mutations in the A.m.H GBD
and CBD eliminate binding to the respective co-repressors. These data highlight the importance of the mutated
residues for the binding to the respective partner. Interestingly, the A.m.H double mutant retains repressor activity
independent of the co-repressors, suggesting that it may
interfere with the assembly of the Su(H)-Notch-Mam activator complex. A similar intrinsic repressor activity was
already observed for the corresponding D.m.H*GC
mutant [12]. This intrinsic repressor activity has been conserved through considerable evolutionary time and we
hope to be able to localize the responsible domain by further comparison and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Taken all together Apis H is a mini-gene
in comparison to the Drosophila orthologue. Interestingly
this small gene mimics H function in Drosophila almost
completely. This was very surprising since H executes its
functions solely through protein-protein interactions.
From the functional complementation we conclude that

A.m.H antagonizes many different Notch-dependent processes during appendage development

A.m.H antagonizes many different Notch-dependent processes during appendage development. D.m.H (central
panel, UAS-DmH) and A.m.H (right panel, UAS-AmH) full length constructs were overexpressed in a spatially and temporally
controlled manner using the Gal4-UAS system. Controls (left panel) are derived from crosses of the same Gal4-line with UASlacZ. A-C) Notch signaling is required for proximo-distal patterning of the leg, notably the formation of segmental joints. PtcGal4 drives H expression in all larval discs along the antero-posterior border. One consequence is the repression of Notch signaling during leg development, causing fusion of the otherwise separated tarsomeres (t1–t5, arrow in B and C) of the tarsus.
Moreover, femur (fem) and tibia (tib) are not well separated. D-F) Overexpression of D.m.H and A.m.H in the ptc pattern
leads to split halteres (arrow in E and F). G-K) During wing development, Notch is required for outgrowth of the wing blade,
margin formation and establishment and refinement of the veins. G) Control wing. H, I) The distance between the third and
fourth longitudinal wing veins is conspicuously reduced upon overexpression of D.m.H along the antero-posterior border (ptcGal4). In addition, a gap is seen in the distal wing margin (arrow). I) The former phenotype is less pronounced using A.m.H
(double arrow; compare with H). Hence, the wing incision appears larger (arrow). J, K) Ap-Gal4 drives H expression in the
dorsal compartment, resulting in broadened veins (arrows) and smaller dorsal surface causing blisters (open arrows).

A.m.H must be able to assemble an effective repressor
complex together with the Drosophila proteins Su(H), Gro
and CtBP. However, whereas D.m.H is rather big with
roughly 120 kDa and hence provides a sufficiently large
surface area for the binding of all three proteins at once,

A.m.H. has a predicted size of only about 45 kDa. For
example, any of its Drosophila partners has a considerably
larger molecular weight [12]. Hence, one might expect
steric hindrance in a repressor complex containing A.m.H
plus Drosophila components. Because A.m.H functions

Page 13 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:175

well in the fly, it must allow for a topology similar to
D.m.H. In this case, the interaction domains SBD, GBD
and CBD must be in likewise close proximity in D.m.H,
whilst the intervening, non-conserved sequences loop
out. A structural analysis of Hairless proteins is required to
eventually resolve the conformation of the repressor complex.
Notch signaling pathway in the honeybee
In this work, we have used A.m.H for a structure-function
analysis of fly Hairless. We do not know, whether A.m.H
has the same antagonistic role during Notch signaling in
the honeybee as in Drosophila. Since we cannot genetically
manipulate the honeybee in the same way as Drosophila,
we cannot address this question directly. Instead, we
searched the honeybee database for other components of
the Notch pathway (see Additional file 2). In fact, we
found single orthologues of Notch, Su(H), Gro and CtBP
that are extremely well conserved in Apis, and one reasonably well conserved Mam orthologue. Moreover, predicted Notch target genes mγ, mβ, mβ' and mα that form
the honeybee E(spl)-C have been already described [39].
We were surprised, however, by the low conservation of
Apis vestigial (vg). The A.m.vg protein has a similarity of
63% and an identity of 58% to D.m.vg (see Additional file
2). This is the lowest conservation rate of any Notch pathway component we have looked for. We were curious
whether the boundary enhancer, where Su(H) binds to, is
present within the presumptive A.m.vg gene. In Drosophila,
this enhancer is located in the first intron and contains a
single Su(H) binding site on the minus-strand with the
core sequence GTGAGAA [29]. The corresponding intron
in the honeybee vg gene comprises over 30 kb and more
than 20 possible Su(H) target sequences (Genomatrix),
three with the identical core sequence on the minusstrand. Taken together, these findings imply that the
entire Notch signaling cascade is conserved in A. mellifera.

In addition, our data indicate that A.m.H antagonizes
Notch signaling in the honeybee also by the assembly of
a repression complex consisting of A.m.Su(H) and the corepressors A.m.Gro and A.m.CtBP. This is based on the
high conservation of the three orthologues as well as their
binding sites within A.m.H and on the direct protein
interactions between A.m.H and the Drosophila Su(H),
Gro and CtBP proteins (Figs 1, 3; see Additional file 2).
The structure of the activation complex from mammals as
well as from C. elegans, comprising Notch, Mam-like protein and DNA-bound CSL has been elucidated [40,41]
and we do not expect it to be much different in fly or honeybee. Differences may arise for target genes such as E(spl)
or vg, which eventually implement Notch signals. The
Apis E(spl) homologues possess typical Su(H) binding
sites in their enhancer-promoters, indicating their impor-

tance in the Notch signaling pathway for honeybee development as well [39,42].
Notch antagonists in higher eukaryotes
Hairless is the general antagonist of the Notch signaling
pathway in Drosophila. To date, H has no known homologue in higher eukaryotes other than insects, in contrast
to the other Notch pathway members that are well conserved from worm and fly to human. Strikingly, the Su(H)
protein, which directly binds to H, shares 82% amino acid
identity with its mouse orthologue RBP-Jκ over large protein portions [15]. This is surprising and leads to speculations. For example, it was postulated that H is the
counterpart of the Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein
(MINT) [43,44]. However, the corresponding Drosophila
protein is encoded by split ends (spen) and has been proposed to integrate information from several different signaling pathways. Recently it has been shown to function
also as genetic antagonist of certain Notch dependent
processes [45].

Conclusion
A vertebrate H homologue has not yet been identified
based on sequence conservation, presumably due to a
high degree of divergence. One experimental approach to
eventually identify such a homologue is to analyze the H
structure in detail and to characterize important functional domains. The H orthologue from the honeybee will
help us in this process. We have shown that A.m.H functions as a bone fide Notch antagonist in the fly despite
considerable divergence with regard to size and amino
acid sequence.

Methods
PCR and cloning strategies
An Apis mellifera embryonic cDNA Uni-ZAP XR library
[46] was screened with a PCR-probe (see Fig. 2A). Two
positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Based on the
sequence of the A.m. EST-clone # BB160014B20G05 [47],
which covers the N-terminus of a predicted A.m.H transcript, our longest isolated cDNA clone was incomplete at
its 5' end. The 22 lacking bases were extended using the
ExSiteTM PCR-based Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). An additional base was added to the lower primer
such that the Eco RI site provided by the pBluescript vector
allowed subsequent in frame cloning in pEG- and pMALvectors, respectively. Primer sequences used in this study
for in vitro mutagenesis and DNA amplification are available upon request, as are details on the cloning strategies.
Computer analysis of H orthologues
The Drosophila melanogaster gene and protein sequences
were accessed in FlyBase [48]. The other Drosophila
sequences as well as the sequences of Anopheles gambiae,
Aedes aegypti, Culex pipiens, Bombyx mori, Tribolium casta-

neum, Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis and Pediculus
humanus corporis were screened with tblastn service of Flybase. In case of A. mellifera, screening was done also with
the HUSAR TBlastN2 service of the DKFZ [49,50]. For
both databases, we used the D. melanogaster protein
sequence as search sequences. Similarity and identity
scores were calculated using BESTFIT. Because standard
conditions only align the best conserved domains, we
relaxed the parameters such that the entire protein
sequence was aligned (gap weight 1, length weight 1, maximum penalty length 30). Whereas these changes have little influence on identity values of closely related
sequences, they give higher scores with less conserved
sequences. Multi-alignments were done with PRRN with
gap extension penalty 1 and the gap open penalty 9. Further analyses were performed as previously described
[39].
Generation of A.m.H and D.m.H wild type and mutant
constructs
Full length A.m.H cDNA was cloned into pUAST [33] generating UAS-AmH. Likewise, hs-AmH was cloned using
pCaSpeR-hs RX8 vector [27]. Mutant constructs were generated with the Quick change XL Site directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
AmHG*: Gro binding site was destroyed by mutating
Y264 into A. AmHC*: CBD was modified from PLNLSKH
to VIQITKR. AmHGC*: within the mutant construct
AmHG*, wild type CBD was replaced by mutant CBD*
(Fig. 2A). All changes were sequence verified. The mutant
constructs were shuttled into pUAST and pEG vectors,
respectively.

Construction of D. melanogaster Hairless C3 deletion (R355
to V564) was described earlier [27]; it was shuttled into
pUAST to yield UAS-DmHΔC3. The AD deletion (E358 to
E465) was generated by A. Bravo-Patiño. It was likewise
shuttled into pUAST (UAS-DmHΔAD).
Generation and analysis of transgenic flies
All P-element constructs, hs-AmH, UAS-AmH, UASAmHG*, UAS-AmHC*, UAS-AmHGC*, UAS-DmHΔAD
and UAS-DmHΔC3, were injected into y1 w1118 embryos
according to standard protocols and several independent
transgenic fly lines were each established; they behaved
largely identical in subsequent tests. The results shown are
from parallel experiments involving a minimum of three
independent lines each and are representative for the
respective construct. The obtained phenotypes were nonoverlapping. The HP8 null mutant was described earlier
[19,51]. Heat shock was given for half hour at 39°C to
third instar hs-AmH larvae and early pupae. Overexpression experiments with UAS-lines were performed at 18°C
and 25°C, respectively. As driver lines, omb-Gal4, gmrGal4, pnr-Gal4, sca-Gal4, ap-Gal4, ey-Gal4 and ptc-Gal4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/175

were used [48]. The vgBE-lacZ reporter line [29] was combined with omb-Gal4, and males crossed to UAS-AmH
wild type or UAS-AmH mutant virgins. Wing discs of
female larvae with the genotype omb-Gal4/X; vgBE-lacZ/
UAS-AmH* were processed for antibody staining. Control
animals were omb-Gal4/X; vgBE-lacZ.
Analysis of protein-protein interactions
Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assays were performed as previously described using VP16-dCtBP, VP16Gro, pEG-Gro, pJG-S4-I and pJG-Su(H) [12,22,31]. For
bait, Apis mellifera constructs pEG-AmH, pEG-AmHG*,
pEG-AmHC* and pEG-AmHGC* were used. In addition,
the following pEG-constructs were generated: pEG-AmHGBD containing the Gro binding domain (codons S262 to
D309), pEG-AmHGBD* (Y264 to A mutation, PCR-amplified from AmHG*) and pEG-AmH4-1 (deletion of 172 Nterminal codons). AmH4-1 is an incomplete cDNA clone;
it starts with L173 and contains complete C-terminal coding sequences. The D. melanogaster Su(H)-binding
domain (SBD) was subdivided into DmH-NT (codons
L171 to S279) and DmH-CT (codons R267 to T362) and
cloned into pEG vector, respectively. pEG NT-CT (L171 to
T362) spans both parts. All constructs were sequence confirmed. Expression of the various pEG-constructs was
examined with Western blots using the anti LexA antibody
(Invitrogen).
Immuno-histochemistry and phenotypic analyses
A PCR construct spanning A.m.H codons N137 to P348 was
cloned into pMAL-C expression vector (New England
Biolabs). AmH-MBP fusion protein was expressed in E.
coli and affinity purified using standard protocols. Polyclonal antisera were from Pineda ABservice (Berlin).
Imaginal discs were stained as described before using rat
anti-AmH (1:500) and mouse anti-beta-galactosidase
(1:20) (developed by J.R. Sanes; obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [DSHB], Department of
Biological Science, University of Iowa City, IA 52242).
Pupal nota were dissected as described earlier [6,28] and
stained with rat anti-elav 7E8A10 and mouse anti-pros
MR1A (each 1:10) (developed by G.M. Rubin and C.Q.
Doe, respectively; obtained from DSHB).

Secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein and Cy3
were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Samples were
mounted in Vectashield (Vector Lab) and analyzed on a
Zeiss Axioskop linked to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal
microscope. Fly body parts were dehydrated in ethanol
and mounted in Euparal or Hoyer's medium. Pictures
were taken on a Zeiss Axiophot with Nomarsky optics.
Pictures of adult flies were taken with a Pixera camera on
a Wild 5M stereo-microscope using Pixera Viewfinder 2.0.
They were assembled using Corel Photo Paint and Corel
Draw software.
