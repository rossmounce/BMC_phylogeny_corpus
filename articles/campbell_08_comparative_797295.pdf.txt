Abstract
Background: Small RNA regulatory pathways (SRRPs) control key aspects of development and
anti-viral defense in metazoans. Members of the Argonaute family of catalytic enzymes degrade
target RNAs in each of these pathways. SRRPs include the microRNA, small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and PIWI-type gene silencing pathways. Mosquitoes generate viral siRNAs when infected
with RNA arboviruses. However, in some mosquitoes, arboviruses survive antiviral RNA
interference (RNAi) and are transmitted via mosquito bite to a subsequent host. Increased
knowledge of these pathways and functional components should increase understanding of the
limitations of anti-viral defense in vector mosquitoes. To do this, we compared the genomic
structure of SRRP components across three mosquito species and three major small RNA
pathways.
Results: The Ae. aegypti, An. gambiae and Cx. pipiens genomes encode putative orthologs for all
major components of the miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA pathways. Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens have
undergone expansion of Argonaute and PIWI subfamily genes. Phylogenetic analyses were
performed for these protein families. In addition, sequence pattern recognition algorithms MEME,
MDScan and Weeder were used to identify upstream regulatory motifs for all SRRP components.
Statistical analyses confirmed enrichment of species-specific and pathway-specific cis-elements over
the rest of the genome.
Conclusion: Analysis of Argonaute and PIWI subfamily genes suggests that the small regulatory
RNA pathways of the major arbovirus vectors, Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens, are evolving faster than
those of the malaria vector An. gambiae and D. melanogaster. Further, protein and genomic features
suggest functional differences between subclasses of PIWI proteins and provide a basis for future
analyses. Common UCR elements among SRRP components indicate that 1) key components from
the miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA pathways contain NF-kappaB-related and Broad complex
transcription factor binding sites, 2) purifying selection has occurred to maintain common pathwayspecific elements across mosquito species and 3) species-specific differences in upstream elements
suggest that there may be differences in regulatory control among mosquito species. Implications
for arbovirus vector competence in mosquitoes are discussed.

Background
Small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways are master
regulators of critical cellular processes, from development
to germ-line surveillance to anti-viral defense [1-5].
Although small RNA regulatory pathways (SRRPs) operate
using distinctly different mechanisms, they share several
common features. Small regulatory RNAs of 20 to 30
nucleotides (nts) are used as guide strands for target substrate recognition by an RNase H type nuclease of the Argonaute protein family. Target RNAs are subsequently
degraded or otherwise prevented from being translated
into protein. The three major pathways are the small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and PIWI small
RNA (piRNA) pathways; the general functions of each are
summarized in Table 1. Due to the paucity of functional
information from mosquitoes, we have relied on protein
structure and functional information compiled from Drosophila spp., Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals.
The Argonaute protein family contains the Argonaute and
PIWI protein subclasses. All proteins in this family contain PAZ (PIWI, Argonaute, Zwille) and PIWI domains
[6]. The PAZ domain is a small RNA binding domain; the
PIWI domain is an RNase-H type domain which relies on
divalent cation binding to facilitate dsRNA-guided cleavage of ssRNA (reviewed in [7]). Argonaute 1 (Ago1) and
Argonaute 2 (Ago2) are in the Argonaute protein subclass
and are functionally distinct from PIWIs, in that they rely
on Dicer proteins to cleave long dsRNAs into small RNAs,
which are then passed to the Agos for further processing
and recognition of target RNAs. These proteins physically
interact with Dicers at the PIWI domain and use small
RNAs formed from double-stranded templates [8]. Ago1
and Ago2 each participate in different gene silencing pathways.
MiRNA pathways of invertebrates have been best characterized in D. melanogaster and C. elegans (reviewed in
[9,10]). In D. melanogaster, developmental and housekeeping gene expression is regulated by Ago1 and the
small RNA subclass, miRNAs (20–22 nts) [11]. In general,
Ago1 acts with Dicer-1, microRNAs (miRNAs) and accessory proteins to control gene expression of housekeeping
genes (Figure 1) [12-14]. In An. gambiae, the miRNA pathway helps defend against Plasmodium bergei infection [15].
Gene expression can be controlled by a variety of possible

silencing mechanisms, including translational repression,
decreased mRNA stability or altered mRNA localization
[3,16,17]. These small RNAs are genome-encoded as primary transcript miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) up to 2 kilobases
(kB) in length and processed into miRNA precursor (premiRNAs) hairpin loops of about 65 nts by Drosha and
Pasha (DGCR8) [18,19]. Dicer-1 cleaves pre-miRNAs to
form mature miRNAs, which are transferred to Ago1 for
silencing of target mRNAs [3,20,21]. In mammals, some
miRNAs are encoded in the introns of the genes they target [22].
The siRNA pathway provides defense against RNA viruses
in the degradation of double-stranded viral RNAs
[1,8,23,24]. SiRNAs, generated from longer dsRNA molecules by the Dicer-2/R2D2 complex, serve as guides for
Ago2 to identify and degrade target RNAs. Key proteins in
the anti-viral RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, including
Ago2 and Dicer-2, are functional in vector mosquitoes
and influence the ability of mosquitoes to serve as competent vectors of human virus pathogens [1,25-27]. Further,
several recent reports of Drosophila have shown that
endogenous siRNAs control retrotransposons and mRNAs
in somatic cells in an Ago2/Dicer-2 dependent manner
[28-30].
In Drosophila melanogaster, the PIWI protein subclass
includes PIWI, Aubergine (Aub), and Argonaute 3 (Ago3).
These proteins contain the signature PAZ and PIWI
domains, but have remained enigmatic members of the
Argonaute family. They have been implicated in a variety
of functions specific to germ-line tissue in D. melanogaster,
including the suppression of retrotransposon mobilization, maintenance of telomeres, prevention of doublestranded DNA breaks during meiosis, and mRNA silencing in germ-line cells [4,5,31-34]. Ago3, Aub, and PIWI
use PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs) (24 to 30 nts) in
these pathways. The mechanisms for production of this
class of non-coding RNAs are not well understood. Models have been proposed, suggesting they are processed
from piRNA cluster transcripts and amplified by a "Ping
Pong" amplification loop between these transcripts and
those derived from active transposons (Figure 1) [35].
Three mosquito species, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti,
and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus are important vectors of

human and animal pathogens [36-41]. The goal of this
study is to increase understanding of the three small RNA
pathways in vector mosquitoes using comparative genomics, with special emphasis on the key catalytic enzymes of
the Argonaute protein family. We performed phylogenetic
analyses of Argonaute family proteins and demonstrated
expansion of Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens Argonaute and
PIWI subfamilies. In addition, we determined whether cisacting regulatory elements upstream of SRRP genes are
conserved across mosquito species or among components
of specific RNA regulatory pathways, as has been successfully demonstrated in other invertebrates [42]. To this
end, previously validated mosquito transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs) and other elements in upstream
control regions (UCRs) of all suspected SRRP components
were identified. Further, we used motif discovery algorithms to identify novel upstream regulatory sequences.
The identification of common cis-acting regulatory features lends insight into species-specific differences in regulation of SRRPs and provides a basis for future studies of
pathogen defense in vector mosquitoes.

deviation/mean) = 100.0%) while among Ago2 proteins
the average probability was 0.9411 (CV = 30.1%) (Figure
3) [55]. Thus, the probability of amino acid substitutions
among Ago2 proteins is about 38-fold greater than among
Ago1 proteins. Because of this high rate of change among
Ago2 proteins, there was only weak bootstrap support
(56.6%) for the proteins from mosquitoes. However,
among the two genera of the tribe Aedini it is interesting
that between Ochlerotatus triseriatus and Ae. aegypti the
substitution probability is only 0.1306, while within and
among Culex species the probability is 0.3798 (CV =
68.9%). This pattern suggests that anti-viral pathway components are evolving more rapidly in Culex spp. than
among subgenera of Aedine mosquitoes. An interesting
parallel was found among drosophilid species, wherein
key anti-viral RNAi component genes, such as DmeAgo2
and DmeDicer-2, were found to be evolving at a higher rate
than miRNA pathway components or other immune
response genes [56]. Synapomorphies that distinguish
Ago1s from Ago2s can be found in the amino acids surrounding the first catalytic residue (Additional File 2).

Results and discussion

Ago1 protein conservation indicates an evolutionary
trend of purifying selection, probably due to conserved
mechanisms in developmental pathways. This hypothesis
is supported in the conservation of some miRNAs
between drosophilids, mosquitoes, and humans http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk/[57]. Although many mosquito
miRNAs have not been experimentally verified, their presence suggests conservation of developmentally regulated
gene silencing pathways. Alignment of Ago1 proteins further illustrates the degree of conservation with overall
amino acid identity of 82 to 89% among all mosquito
orthologs and that of D. melanogaster (Additional File 1B).
This is in contrast to the 30 to 43% amino acid identity
among all mosquito Ago 2 proteins compared to
DmeAgo2 (Additional File 1C).

The An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. pipiens genomes
encode components of the three major RNA regulatory
pathways previously identified in D. melanogaster (Figure
1 and Additional File 1A) [1,8,11,12,24,26,43-53]. There
are gene expansions in some categories; these are
described below. Additional File 1A depicts, in gray highlight, the genes for which expression has been confirmed,
either experimentally or in EST libraries [1,26]. Importantly, key catalytic residues of the RNase-H domains are
conserved in all mosquito Ago1s, Ago2s and PIWI subfamily proteins (Figure 2) [7]. Although a few studies have
been done in Ae. aegypti and anopheline mosquitoes
[1,15,25,54], experimental verification will be required to
confirm the roles played by most of these putative
orthologs in RNA regulatory pathways.
Argonaute protein subfamily
Ago1 is represented at a single genomic locus in An. gambiae, Cx. pipiens and D. melanogaster but seems to be
present in two copies in Ae. aegypti (Figure 1, Additional
File 1A). The flanking sequences of about 1.2 kilobases
(kB) upstream and the introns were found to be unique.

Ago1 of the human head louse, Pediculus humanus was
used as an outgroup for the analysis of Argonaute subfamily proteins. Ago2 homologs from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, and D. melanogaster were also included in the
analysis. In addition, orthologs from the important pathogen vectors, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Culex tarsalis, and Ochlerotatus triseriatus were included. Based upon the JonesTaylor-Thornton probability model, the probability of
amino acid substitutions among Ago1 proteins was
0.0247 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 100 * (standard

Ago2 is a single locus in Ae. aegypti, An. gambiae, and D.
melanogaster, but is present in two copies in Cx. pipiens
(Figure 1). Fragments of two distinct mRNAs have also
been isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhyncus, suggesting that a
gene duplication occurred early in the evolution of Culex
spp. (Campbell, unpublished). This first evidence of multiple Ago2 loci in Dipterans suggests that differential regulation of RNAi anti-viral defense could occur in Culex spp.
vectors. Although anti-viral RNAi activity has not yet been
reported for Culex spp., this pathway has been established
as an important facet of anti-viral defense in An. gambiae
and Ae. aegypti against alphaviruses and dengue viruses
(DENV), respectively [1,25,26].
PIWI pathway gene expansions
A significant gene expansion has occurred in PIWI subfamily proteins in both Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens (Figure
1) [48,51]. Phylogenetic analyses of PIWIs used D. melaPage 4 of 16

nogaster Aub and PIWI as outgroups (Figure 4). Three wellsupported clades are evident. Ago3s form a single clade
with D. melanogaster. In contrast, none of the mosquito
PIWIs formed a clade with the drosophilid proteins,
rather, two clades arise based on similarity to An. gambiae
Ago4 or Ago5.
The first clade has 100% support and contains the Ago3
proteins. Ago3s can be readily distinguished from other
Argonaute family proteins by the amino acids surrounding the first conserved catalytic residue (Figure 2 and
Additional File 1D). The average rate of change among
these is high 0.6872 (CV = 40.7%). The Ago3 proteins
among the Culicidae are monophyletic with 100.0% support, and the average rate of change among these is also
high 0.4615 (CV = 44.6%).
The Ago4-like clade has 100.0% bootstrap support and
contains AgaAgo4, CpiPIWI1, CpiPIWI2, CpiPIWI3,

AaePIWI1, AaePIWI2, AaePIWI3 and AaePIWI4. The
amino acid substitution probability among these is low
relative to the other 2 clades, (0.1943; CV = 39.5%). Members of the Ago4-like group were distinguished by the
synapomorphy
"ETGIQVLNLILRRAMNGLNLQLVGRNLY" within the first 260 amino acids (Additional File
2). This synapomorphy is maintained in DmePIWI, but
not in DmeAub. Members of the Ago5-like group have a
variable sequence in the corresponding region.
AgaAgo5 is basal to the Ago5-like clade, which has 93.0%
bootstrap support and contains CpiPIWI4, CpiPIWI5,
CpiPIWI6, AaePIWI5, AaePIWI6 and AaePIWI7. The
amino acid substitution probability is high (0.3422; CV =
37.8%). These analyses indicate that the expanded PIWI
protein subfamily comprises several different gene families with some resulting from recent gene duplication
events (Figure 4, Additional File 1E). Expansion of Argonaute family proteins has occurred in other organisms, as
well. One example is in C. elegans, in which a gene expansion has occurred, evidently to aid in sequential amplification of siRNA signal. A key difference between the C.
elegans and mosquito Argonaute family gene expansions
is that the C. elegans secondary Agos (SAGOs) lack the key
metal binding residues required for RNase H catalytic
activity and so are thought to play a secondary role in
RNAi [58], whereas, these key catalytic residues are
present in mosquito PIWIs (Figure 2).
In drosophilids, PIWI pathway components have been
implicated in the control of both retrotransposons and
the long terminal repeats of telomeres [31,33]. Our analysis suggests the PIWI subfamily gene expansion initially
occurred in ancestral Culicinae mosquitoes before the
divergence of Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens ancestors [59,60].
Expansions in PIWI pathway components may have been
adaptive for controlling the increased burden of retrotransposons in Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens relative to An.
gambiae. Although retrotransposons are present in the An.
gambiae genome, the percentage of the genome bearing
TEs is much less than that of Ae. aegypti [46,61-63]. About
47% of the Ae. aegypti genome harbors both class I and
class II transposable elements (TEs), whereas the An. gambiae genome contains about 16% TEs [46,51]. TEs are also
present in Culex spp. genomes, however the percentage of
the genome occupied has not yet been reported [63,64].
Retrotransposons, also known as Class I TEs, account for
at least half of the TE load in both anopheline and aedine
genomes. Therefore, the aedine genome carries more than
twice the retrotransposon load than anophelines carry.
In a related context, DmePIWI has also been implicated in
maintenance of heterochromatin. DmePIWI associates
directly with chromatin and heterochromatin protein 1a
(HP1a) [65]. DmePIWI-HP1a interactions occur through
conserved PIWI protein motifs, PxVxV or PxVxM. Of the

RNA interference [24,66]. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that there are independent orthologous groups of
Rm62-like proteins (Additional File 3).
Rm62 and Armitage-like proteins carry predicted DEAD
box ATP-dependent helicase domains. DmeArmitage is a
transcriptional repressor of specific mRNAs during male
germ-line development and has been shown in a genetic
screen to be involved in anti-viral defense [24,67]. Interestingly, the Armitage gene duplication in Aedes and Culex
has resulted in two different types of multi-domain helicases (Figure 1). Although both aedine Armitage-like paralogs carry a type III DNA restriction enzyme domain, as
does DmeArmitage, only one of the two Culex paralogs
carries this domain (CPIJ001247). Instead, the second
paralog is missing the restriction enzyme domain and carries a predicted DNA helicase domain (CPIJ001245) (data
not shown). In contrast, AgaArmitage has two RNA helicase domains, in addition to the DNA restriction enzyme
domain. This interesting diversity in protein domains
among mosquito species suggests that, if Armitage participates in anti-viral defense as in D. melanogaster, it may be
pivotal to species-specific differences.

all four of these proteins are in the Ago5-like protein class.
In contrast, neither AgaAgo4 nor AgaAgo5 carry these
motifs.
Accessory Proteins
The RNA helicases of Drosophila and mosquitoes are
clearly a large and complex family. Other than a genetic
connection to anti-viral defense and retrotransposon
maintenance in drosophilids, little is known about Rm62
in Dipterans. Using a high stringency search cut-off E
value of E = 10-80, multiple mosquito genes were identified that are homologous to DmeRm62 RNA helicase (Figure 1 and Additional Files 1A, F). Although reciprocal
genome searches identified 7 homologous RNA helicase
genes in Drosophila, only DmeRm62 has been linked to

Upstream Control Regions
We took a conservative approach to determine whether
cis-acting elements are conserved among SRRP component upstream regions. Our goals were two-fold: 1) to
identify previously validated mosquito TFBSs and 2)
novel upstream regulatory control elements in regions
corresponding to -1000 nts to +100 nts. This region corresponds to the upstream genomic sequence, the 5' untranslated region of the transcript, the translation start site
and some coding nucleotides in the first exon. Consensus
sequences for the upstream motifs are listed in Table 2.
We determined whether elements in each of these categories are conserved within each pathway or across mosquito species.

Within the last 150 million years, An. gambiae and Ae.
Aegypti became distinct species, and more recently, Cx. pipiens diverged. One might expect that among-species comparisons would yield fewer common elements than
within-species elements. However, non-coding DNA is
subject to the same stabilizing selection as protein coding
regions, and, in drosophilids, non-coding DNA is actually
less polymorphic than protein coding regions at synonymous sites [68]. If purifying selection has occurred in
UCRs of mosquito SRRP genes, common elements could
be conserved across species, thus adding support to the
functional significance of upstream regulatory elements,
regardless of whether they were unique across the entire
genome. Furthermore, selective pressures on non-coding
DNA can be significant and therefore exacerbate the
search for TFBSs [68]. Therefore, to maintain a conserva-

tive line of inquiry, we chose to examine only those TFBSs
that have been experimentally confirmed in mosquitoes.
The search for novel motifs was expected to yield conserved cis-acting regulatory elements.
Transcription factor binding sites: NF-kappa B related sites
There is empirical evidence that RNA viruses activate
innate immunity pathways in Dipterans. The Toll and
JAK-STAT (janus kinase/signal transducers and activators
of transcription) pathways are activated in drosophilids
upon infection with Drosophila C virus or Drosophila X
virus [69,70]. A search for STAT binding motifs (Table 2)
among all pathway component UCRs yielded no matches,
thus suggesting that the JAK-STAT pathway does not activate transcription of effectors of mosquito miRNA, siRNA,
or PIWI pathways. Mosquito NF kappa B-related proteins,
REL1 and REL2, participate in transcriptional induction of
immune effectors during bacterial and fungal infections
(summarized in [71]). REL1 stimulates downstream effec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/425

tors via the Toll pathway, while REL2 stimulates downstream effectors via the immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway
[72]. During Sindbis (SINV) infection of Ae. aegypti, REL1
transcripts are enriched early in infection [73]. Identification of REL TFBSs in UCRs of SRRP genes would suggest a
link between small regulatory RNA pathways and the
innate immune response cascade. Consensus NF kappa Brelated binding motifs in Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae are
"GGKGATYYAC" (NFkB1) and "KGGGAWHMMM"
(NFkB2), respectively. A cross-species consensus is
"KGKGAWHHMM" (NFkB4) [72]. These REL TFBS consensus motifs could be bound by either AaeREL1 or
AaeREL2. Search of all mosquito SRRP components for
NFkB1 yielded hits on only two Rm62-like UCRs, and
NFkB2 revealed few hits across all species (Additional File
4). The cross-species 10 nt consensus, NFkB4, revealed
more hits, some of which are redundant to those identified by NFkB2 (Figures 5, 6, 7). To identify putative motifs
under more relaxed conditions, a shortened version of the

NFkB2 consensus, "GGGAWHM" (NFkB7), was used. In
this case, the relaxed search was followed by a more rigorous requirement of ≥ 2 motifs per UCR. Proportions of
UCRs containing these motifs are listed in Table 3.
Schematics showing distribution of NFkB4 motifs are
shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7. Hits were detected in key
component UCRs of all three mosquito species and
SRRPs. For example, AaeDrosha, AgaDrosha, AaeTSN,
CpiTSN and AgaTSN UCRs share NFkB4 sites, and all
three species have NFkB4 sites upstream of PIWI pathway
component UCRs. Although there were no significant
pathway-specific or species-specific differences in the
presence of NF kappa B-related binding sites, the presence
of these motifs in key UCRs suggests a possible link to the
innate immune response or development.
The drosophilid ortholog of Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (TSN) is a component of the RISC and has multiple
functional attributes, such as transcriptional co-activation
activity, non-specific ssRNA cleavage, cleavage of hyperedited dsRNA substrates, and an un-defined role in antiviral defense [43,74]. Microarray analysis of Ae. aegypti
transcripts during a SINV infection, showed early enrichment of AaeREL1 transcripts at 1 day post-infection (dpi),
followed by stimulation of AaeTSN at 4 dpi [73]. Analysis
of anti-viral RNAi component transcript levels in Ae.
aegypti infected with alphaviruses or flaviviruses showed
periodic enrichment of TSN transcripts in a virus-dependent manner [25](Campbell, unpublished). Importantly,
TSN UCRs from all three species contained NFkB4 motifs
(Figure 7, Additional File 4). This evidence further suggests that a link exists between the anti-viral pathway and
the innate immune response pathway of mosquitoes.
Broad Complex motifs
Broad complex (BRC) transcription factors act during
ecdysone-dependent regulation of gene expression in
invertebrates [75]. Ecdysone, a steroid hormone, is of key
importance in embryogenesis and development in
insects. Of the four types of BRC TFBSs, BRC_Z1 is the
most abundant in miRNA and piRNA pathway component UCRs, however, the enrichment is not statistically
significant (Table 3). In mosquitoes, BRC_Z1 is thought
to be a transcriptional repressor that ensures proper temporal gene expression control for the yolk protein precursor gene, vitellogenin [76]. The presence of a BRC_Z1
motif upstream of nearly all of the miRNA pathway components and many PIWI pathway components suggests
the requirement for temporal control of these pathways,
as well. BRC_Z2 is required for 20-hydroxyecdysonemediated transcriptional activation [76]. BRC_Z2 motifs
were identified on key genes of all three pathways, sometimes in tandem with BRC_Z1 motifs (Figures 5, 6, 7 and
Additional File 4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/425

GATA factors
GATA factors control tissue- and temporally-specific gene
expression. GATA binding sites are upstream of a variety
of genes in mosquitoes, including lysosomal protease, gut
trypsin, and vitellogenin genes [77-79]. Expression of gut
trypsins and vitellogenin genes are tightly linked to bloodfeeding. GATA factors or GATA repressors bind these sites
to either activate or repress transcription. Multiple GATA
sites were identified in all UCRs, indicating no obvious
species-specific or pathway-specific variation (Additional
File 4). Therefore, this element was not analyzed further.
Novel Elements
Novel UCR elements could serve as genomic structural
elements, mRNA stability elements or TFBSs. We identified features in upstream non-coding regions that may
have been selectively maintained over the course of evolution. To accomplish this, we compared UCRs across mosquito species and across small RNA regulatory pathways
for all three mosquito species. This focused approach
allowed us to use a subset of each mosquito genome as
background. The presence of cis upstream elements across
all three mosquito species for a single pathway would suggest that they may be important regulatory features of that
pathway. Although some components, such as those of
the RISC, may act in multiple pathways; for our analysis,
we categorized the groups according to the outline in Figure 1. The sequence motif search programs MEME (Multiple EM for motif elicitation), MDScan, and Weeder were
used [80-83]. These programs identify over-represented
sequence patterns or motifs in a given dataset compared
to all other datasets. The top two elements discovered for
each species and pathway were then identified among all
UCRs, and significant differences among pathways or species were noted. Selected motifs are listed in Table 3, along
with the proportion of UCRs with at least one species-specific or pathway-specific hit, and full descriptions are in
Additional File 4. Fisher's Exact test was used to determine
whether the UCR elements or TFBS motifs were enriched
in a pathway-specific or species-specific manner. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing adjustment was
used to correct for false positives, thus, for any BH score
over 0.05, the Fisher's Exact test score was considered
insignificant. In addition, we performed full genome
searches for all novel elements and removed those that
did not show enrichment in SRRP UCRs over the rest of
the genome (Additional File 4). Together, these methods
allowed identification of cis-elements that could be
important regulatory features of SRRP pathways.

Identification of species-specific cis elements could provide an important foundation for future characterization
of species-specific differences in regulation of pathogen
defense pathways. By convention, strong regulatory sites
are those represented in tandem repeats (Figures 5, 6, 7,

Additional File 4) [84]. Due to the experimental design,
elements that were identified in the species-specific search
might also be enriched in a pathway-specific manner. For
example, the An. gambiae elements M7 and M8 are
enriched over the remainder of the genome in an siRNA
pathway-specific manner for both An. gambiae and Ae.
Aegypti (Additional File 4). In addition, elements M12 and
M13 are enriched in Cx. pipiens in a miRNA pathway-specific manner over the remainder of the genome, even
though Fisher's Exact test did not indicate the Cx. pipiens
has significantly more of these elements than Ae. aegypti
or An. gambiae (Table 3). In contrast, the M1 and M2 elements of Aedes aegypti are strongly enriched in all SRRPs
over the remainder of the aedine genome (Additional File
4). M9 (An. gambiae) and M17 (Cx. pipiens) were enriched
in a species-specific manner over all other SRRP UCRs
according to Fisher's Exact test (Table 3), however, they
were not enriched in SRRP upstream regions compared to
the remainder of the genome. Therefore, they are not
likely to be important to regulation of small RNA metabolism.
Pathway-specific upstream elements were also identified.
Of the five elements identified, M24 was the most interesting, because, it was enriched among the siRNA pathway
UCRs across all three species. Conservation of withinpathway features across species supports the hypothesis of
purifying selection in UCRs of small RNA regulatory components.

Implications for Vector Competence
Of the Argonaute protein subfamily members, Ago2, the
anti-viral RNase H-type nuclease, is significantly more
diverse among mosquito species than the miRNA pathway nuclease, Ago1. This finding suggests that anti-viral
defense effectors are evolving at a faster rate than those
involved in housekeeping functions. Anti-viral defense
systems likely evolved to protect against entomopathogenic viruses. In turn, some entomopathogenic viruses
probably evolved into arboviruses. When considering
these pathways, it is important to keep in mind that evolutionary pressure exists on both the arbovirus and the
vector mosquito to modulate the immune response.

Differences in UCR element motif patterns suggest that
there are likely to be species-specific differences in transcriptional regulation of siRNA pathway components that
could affect arbovirus vector competence. Loosely categorized, An. gambiae primarily transmits malaria parasites,
Cx. pipiens transmits encephalitic arboviruses, and Ae.
aegypti transmits important hemorrhagic arboviruses. For
a given arthropod, low vector competence could arise
from an effective immune response that clears the pathogen and prevents pathogen escape to the salivary glands.
With this model in mind, we hypothesize that An. gambiae
has a more effective antiviral immune response than
either Cx. pipiens or Ae. aegypti. Characterization of these
putative regulatory differences awaits further exploration
in each species. The demonstrated ability of some mosquito species to serve as competent arbovirus vectors in

spite of the presence of anti-viral RNAi components, begs
the question of what mechanisms are used by arboviruses
to evade anti-viral RNAi defense.
This report brings to bear both the importance of PIWI
family gene expansion in vector mosquitoes and the need
for research focus in this area. A few exploratory studies
have found evidence that PIWI proteins could be important in anti-viral defense. Transient silencing of Ago3 by
dsRNA injection increased O'nyong-nyong infection of
An. gambiae [1]. However, characterization of PIWI pathway activity in mosquito anti-viral defense is clearly
required before additional conclusions can be drawn. In
Drosophila, an apparent paradox is found, wherein PIWI
pathway proteins are reportedly expressed only in ovaries
and are restricted to germline maintenance, however,
PIWI pathway components DmeAub, DmeArmitage and
DmeRm62 have been implicated in anti-viral processes
[5,24,67,85]. Recent reports describing the presence of
endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) are beginning to shed
light in this area [29,30]. Small RNAs were found to control retrotransposons in somatic tissue in D. melanogaster
in a Dicer2/Ago2 dependent manner.

Conclusion
This genomics study provides important contextual information for both vector biologists and the RNAi community and highlights important differences between vector

mosquitoes and model organisms, such as Drosophila.
Together, these data suggest a need to further investigate
the relationship between vector competence and specific
small RNA pathways across mosquito species, as well as
potential arbovirus strategies for evasion of these defense
mechanisms. However, it is still unclear what aspects of
mosquito biology are driving evolution and gene expansion of Argonaute family genes.

Methods
Putative ortholog identification
Mosquito Argonaute/PIWI family genes were identified
by tblastx search of the Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus genomes at Vectorbase.org, using the An. gambiae
RNAi orthologs [86]. Putative orthologs of other SRRP
components were identified by tblastx search of the databases using drosophilid RNAi genes. Argonaute and
Rm62 family hits with E values of 0.0 -10-80 were included
in the analyses. Many other putative orthologs did not
allow cut-offs with this high stringency, therefore, for all
other groups, top hits with E values of < 10-40 were used.
Gene expression in each species was corroborated by the
presence of a mosquito EST in the public database, as
determined by blastn search, E value < 10-40. Putative isoforms from Cx. pipiens, based on alternate gene predictions at the same locus, were designated with a letter
following the allele number (Additional File 1A).

Scale is 1000 bases upstream to about 100 bases downstream of the beginning of the transcript.
The conservative naming conventions used for the PIWI
genes could not be followed for Ago1 and Ago2. The gene
names "Argonaute 1" and "Argonaute 2" are understood
in the broad scientific community to be associated with
the miRNA and siRNA pathways, respectively. To use a
different numbering scheme for the expanded "Argonaute
1" and "Argonaute 2" gene families would have further
added to confusion, therefore, we chose to assign the
newly identified genes as paralogs rather than orthologs,
even though the genes were not located on the same
super-contig. The high level of sequence similarity provides additional support for this decision. For example,
the open reading frames of AaeAGO1-1 and AaeAGO1-2
have 99.1% nucleotide identity but different upstream
flanking sequences and introns. Similar searches were
done for CpiAGO2-1A and CpiAGO2-2. Importantly,
CpiAGO2-1A and CpiAGO2-2 share only 48% nt identity
but both are classified as 'Ago2-type' proteins according to
amino acid sequence similarities and synapomorphies.
Phylogenetic analyses
Full-length PIWI subfamily proteins were compared. The
C-terminal 250 amino acids of Argonaute subfamily proteins were compared. Partial Ago sequences were used,
because full-length sequences were not available for some
species. A Gonnet matrix was used in a CLUSTALW alignment; this weighted matrix is based on the supposition

that any given amino acid substitution is influenced by
neighboring amino acids, and thus provides a basis for
characterizing protein families [87]. The alignment was
used to generate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
using PROML (PHYLIP [88]). Phylogenetic relationships
among proteins were estimated using a maximum likelihood analysis of amino acid sequences with the JonesTaylor-Thornton probability model of amino acid
changes [55]. This method assumes that taxa evolve independently, that each amino acid position evolves independently and that substitutions at each amino acid site
occur with a probability specified in the PAM 250 matrix.
In addition, all amino acids are included in the analysis
rather than just the phylogenetically informative sites. A
bootstrap analysis was done with 1,000 pseudoreplicates.
Motif Searches and Analyses
Genomic sequences corresponding to approximately 1000 to +100 was extracted from genomic, 5' untranslated
region, and partial coding region of each gene as listed at
Vectorbase.org [86]. Motif searches were performed using
MEME, Weeder, and MDScan [81-83,89-91]. Searches of
the upstream control regions were performed separately
for each of the following groups: (1) Ae. aegypti, (2) An.
gambiae, (3) Cx. pipiens, (4) miRNA genes across species,
(5) siRNA genes across species and (6) PIWI genes across

identified for at least two of the three species. Experimentally identified motifs are interesting for biological reasons, therefore, significance by Fisher's Exact test or
genome search was not required.

Full genome searches were performed to ensure that each
element is enriched in the pathway or species of interest
over the rest of the genome. This validation method provided support for the hypothesis that the particular motif
was enriched in the pathway-specific or species-specific
manner in which it was originally discovered. Each species
genome was searched for the given sequence using the
same number of mismatches denoted in Additional File 4.
The output number was adjusted to the number of occurrences per supercontig length. The 95th percentile of this
"mod count" was used as a cut-off to determine which
motifs were enriched in each category. Motifs reported as

Fisher's Exact test adds further support and highlights
motifs that are over-represented in a species or pathwayspecific manner among all UCRs tested. The median
number of hits was calculated using only those UCRs
which contained at least one hit. Fisher's exact test was
used to test for a relationship between each pathway (or
species) versus the absence or presence for each motif,
using a lower cut-off of one hit per motif. The BenjaminiHochberg (BH) multiple testing adjustment method,
which controls the False Discovery rate, was also performed, using a cut-off of 0.05 [93]. This cut-off ensures
that 5% or fewer should be false discoveries or false positives and was used to identify motifs with significantly different proportions among pathways or species. The BH
adjusted p-values as well as the gene proportions for
