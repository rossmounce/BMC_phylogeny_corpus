Distinct, ecotype-specific genome and
proteome signatures in the marine
cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus

Abstract
Background: The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, having multiple ecotypes of distinct genotypic/
phenotypic traits and being the first documented example of genome shrinkage in free-living organisms, offers an
ideal system for studying niche-driven molecular micro-diversity in closely related microbes. The present study,
through an extensive comparative analysis of various genomic/proteomic features of 6 high light (HL) and 6 low
light (LL) adapted strains, makes an attempt to identify molecular determinants associated with their vertical niche
partitioning.
Results: Pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in synonymous codon usage is observed exclusively in LL strains.
Distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by 2 LL strains with larger genomes and G+C-content ≈
50% (group LLa), 4 LL strains having reduced genomes and G+C-content ≈ 35-37% (group LLb), and 6 HL strains.
Taking into account the emergence of LLa, LLb and HL strains (based on 16S rRNA phylogeny), a gradual increase
in average aromaticity, pI values and beta- & coil-forming propensities and a decrease in mean hydrophobicity,
instability indices and helix-forming propensities of core proteins are observed. Greater variations in orthologous
gene repertoire are found between LLa and LLb strains, while higher number of positively selected genes exist
between LL and HL strains.
Conclusion: Strains of different Prochlorococcus groups are characterized by distinct compositional,
physicochemical and structural traits that are not mere remnants of a continuous genetic drift, but are potential
outcomes of a grand scheme of niche-oriented stepwise diversification, that might have driven them
chronologically towards greater stability/fidelity and invoked upon them a special ability to inhabit diverse oceanic
environments.

Background
Evolution of a microbe is often driven by its environment or life-style. Microorganisms adapted to some specialized environmental conditions have been reported to
display conspicuous genome and/or proteome features
[1-8]. Species of widely varying taxonomic origins, but
thriving in same/similar environmental conditions such
as high temperature or high salinity, may converge to
similar genome and/or proteome composition. In contrast, closely related bacterial species inhabiting distinct
ecological niches may display substantial genomic

diversity [1-3,6,8-11]. Unveiling the plausible causes/
consequences, at the genome and proteome levels, of
such niche-dependent evolution of the microbial world
poses a major challenge to the present-day life-scientists.
The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus
[12], having multiple ecotypes exhibiting distinct nichespecific phenotypic as well as genotypic characteristics,
offers a useful system to address this issue.
Prochlorococcus are one of the most abundant life
forms on this planet and more importantly, are major
contributors to global photosynthesis [13-15]. A variety
of Prochlorococcus strains, each specialized to dwell in
different conditions of light, temperature and nutrient
abundances [14,16-18] dominate the euphotic zones of
the ocean - mostly between latitudes 40°S and 40°N, and

sometimes beyond. To date, the complete genomes of
12 different strains of P. marinus have been sequenced
(listed in Table 1) and wide variations have been
observed in genetic architectures, genome sizes and
genomic G+C-content of these strains [19]. On the basis
of vertical niche partitioning, these 12 strains are classified into two major Prochlorococcus ecotypes: high light
adapted (HL) ecotype being most abundant in surface
waters and low light adapted (LL) ecotype dominating
deeper waters [19,20]. 6 of the sequenced strains have
been identified to belong to the LL group and the other
6 have been found to survive at HL conditions [19]. The
phenomenon of oceanic niche differentiation for P. marinus has been previously investigated into - and several
inferences regarding the effects of light adaptation,
nutrient availability and predator influence on their genome evolution and diversification has been arrived at
[21-24]. However, the full expanse of ecologically relevant differences in genomic, physicochemical and physiological characteristics among these strains are yet to
be explored. In the present study, we have attempted to
identify novel niche-specific molecular signatures in the
genome and proteome compositions of 12 different Prochlorococcus strains, and also investigated the adaptive
strategies of different Prochlorococcus strains for their
survival in diverse oceanic environments.
It is worth mentioning in this context that Prochlorococcus is the first documented example of genome
shrinkage along with A+T enrichment in a free-living
organism [25]. Earlier examples of genome reduction
had been restricted to endosymbionts or pathogens with
a host-dependent lifestyle, which evolve under the constraint of frequent population bottlenecks with a subsequent increase in genetic drift [2,3,26-29]. Considering
the abundance of P. marinus in the marine ecosystem,
their reductive genome evolution might not be

influenced by similar population bottlenecks and resulting genetic drifts, and thus seems to be a more complex
phenomenon to explain. Although P. marinus genome
evolution has been investigated previously [25,30] and
the event of genome shrinkage have been ascribed to
various factors related to their growth in oligotrophic
waters [20,23,31], selection for metabolic economy
[25,31,32], loss of low fitness genes [33], and smaller cell
sizes [25], it is still unclear to what extent it has been
driven by any random genetic drift and/or other specific
selection force(s). Our analyses indicate that the ecotype-specific molecular signatures exhibited by P. marinus strains under study are not mere remnants of a
continuous genetic drift, but a potential outcome of
niche-oriented stepwise diversification of Prochlorococcus, orchestrated by an array of interplaying adaptive
forces.

Results
In an attempt to understand the trends in molecular
evolution in Prochlorococcus, we have analyzed various
genome and proteome characteristics of 6 LL and 6 HL
strains of P. marinus. The analyses of genome/proteome
in P. marinus include the study of trends in codon,
dinucleotide and amino acid usages, gene synteny of
orthologous sequences, intergenic sequence composition, physicochemical properties of the encoded proteins
and the extent of positive selection among different
strains. These analyses were primarily directed towards
the identification of niche-specific variations within different Prochlorococcus strains.

(COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of
12 different strains of P. marinus. Figure 1 shows the
positions of the individual genes on the planes defined
by the first and second major axes generated by COA
on RSCU values of coding sequences of respective Prochlorococcus genomes under study. Interestingly, in
cases of all LL strains, the genes transcribed from the
leading and the lagging strands of replication are segregated in two distinguishable clusters (with little overlap
between them), either along Axis1 or Axis2 or both.
Similar scatter plots with two distinct clusters of genes
were observed earlier in cases of microbial genomes
with pronounced strand-specific mutational bias
[2,3,34,35]. When the positions of all synonymous
codons are plotted on the plane defined by the first and
second major axis of COA on RSCU for genes of all LL
strains (plot not shown), a clear separation between
G-/U- ending codons and A-/C- ending codons is
observed, indicating the presence of asymmetric mutational bias at synonymous codon usage level in low light
(LL) adapted genomes of P. marinus. In contrast, for
each of the HL strains, a single cluster of genes (i.e., no
segregation between the leading and lagging strand
genes) is found on the Axis1-Axis2 plane of COA on
their RSCU values (Figure 1), suggesting the absence of

Page 3 of 15

any pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in their
synonymous codon usage. For all LL strains, GT3-content of genes exhibit significant correlations with Axis1
and/or Axis2 values (Table 2). 3 of the 6 LL strains, viz.
LL1, LL3 and LL4 show highly significant correlations
between Axis1 and GT3-content of genes, whereas LL2,
LL5 and LL6 strains show significantly high correlations
between Axis2 and GT3-content (Table 2). In LL strains
the positions of the leading and lagging strand genes on
the planes defined by Axis1 and Axis2 of COA (Figure
1), therefore, clearly indicate the overall GT3-richness of
the leading strand genes. However, for the HL strains of
Prochlorococcus, the percentage of variance explained by
the first two principal axes are relatively low and the
correlation values of these axes with GC3- or GT3-contents of genes are either insignificant or much lower
than those observed for LL strains (Table 2). This suggests that no single axis and/or parameter can explain
strand-specific variations in synonymous codon usage of
HL strains.
Chi-square tests on occurrences of different codons on
two replicating strands of representative LL strains (LL1
and LL6) further reveal significant overrepresentation of
28 and 22 G-/U- ending codons on the leading strands
of LL1 and LL6 respectively (p < 0.001); while 28 and

25 A-/C- ending codons are overrepresented in the
genes encoded on the lagging strands of LL1 and LL6
respectively (p < 0.001) (Additional files 1 and 2). The
codon ‘CUG’ is the only exception, which, in spite of
being G-ending, is significantly overrepresented in the
lagging strand genes of LL1.
In microbial genomes characterized by pronounced
strand asymmetry [2,3,34,35], replicational-transcriptional selection usually play a major role in shaping genome organization. The leading strands of replication of
such organisms, in general, contain higher number of
genes due to replicational selection, and are also
enriched with highly expressed genes as an effect of
transcriptional selection. However, in LL strains of P.
marinus, the predicted protein coding sequences are
found to be distributed almost equally in two strands. In
fact, in three LL strains (LL1, LL2 and LL3), the number
of predicted protein coding sequences are lower in the
leading strands than in the lagging strands (approximately 48% in the leading strands and 52% in the lagging strands), indicating the absence of replicational
selection. The lagging strands of the strains MIT9313
(LL1) and MIT9303 (LL2) are also found to be enriched
in ribosomal proteins, which are typically highly
expressed. Only two such genes are encoded by each of
their leading strands, leaving 36 and 37 ribosomal proteins to be encoded by their lagging strands (LL1 and
LL2 respectively). For other LL strains, the distribution
of ribosomal genes is quite conventional (≈ 25 on leading strands and ≈ 12 on lagging strands). However,
most of the other potentially highly expressed genes
(e.g., RNA polymerases, transcription and translation

processing factors, etc.), are present in higher numbers
in the leading strands of all LL strains. Hence it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the
effects of transcriptional selection on the LL strains of
Prochlorococcus.
Larger extent of genomic rearrangements between small
and large P. marinus genomes

In order to understand the nature and extent of genomic rearrangements during the events of niche specific
diversification, we have analyzed the conservation of the
relative order or synteny of orthologs across the chromosomes of different P. marinus strains. Figure 2 represents graphically, the gene synteny of 519 orthologs (see
methods) in three low light (LL1, LL3 and LL6) and two
high light adapted (HL3 and HL4) strains of P. marinus.
The low light strains of Prochlorococcus have considerable variations in their genomic size and G+C-content
(Table 1). The LL1 strain here represents the high G+C
and large genome containing LL strains, while the LL3
& LL6 strains represent the other members of the LL
group which have lower G+C-content and reduced genome size. HL3 and HL4 strains are representatives of
the HL group, which also share smaller genome and
lower G+C content. Interestingly, the extent of variation
in order and orientation of orthologous genes between
two strains of similar light optima but of distinct genome sizes and G+C-content (viz., between LL1 and LL3,
Figure 2), is significantly greater than that between two
strains with distinct light optima, but having similar
genome size and G+C-content (e.g., between LL6 and
HL3). It is worth mentioning at this point that this

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/103

conclusion holds good for all 12 P. marinus strains
under study, i.e., the results will be similar even if the
representative strains selected here are replaced with
any other strains form the groups they represent. The
analysis, therefore, suggests that genome reduction in P.
marinus has been accompanied by numerous seemingly
random genome rearrangements such as translocations
and inversions. Amongst the reduced genomes, the
order and orientation of orthologous gene clusters
remain more or less conserved except some local reorientation of genome fragments, the number and extent
of reorientations being higher between the strains with
distinct light adaptation (Figure 2).
Niche-specific dinucleotide abundance values of P.
marinus genomes

It has been reported previously that dinucleotide abundance values are usually similar in related species and
can be regarded as a genome signature [36]. To understand the patterns in dinucleotide signature, we have
calculated dinucleotide abundance values for all P. marinus genomes and also for E. coli (a representative

Page 5 of 15

outgroup). The genomic G+C-bias of E. coli is similar to
that of LL1 and LL2 Prochlorococcus strains. The results
are shown diagrammatically in Figure 3. Some Prochlorococcus-specific trends are exhibited by all P. marinus
organisms under study, irrespective of their G+C-bias or
ecological adaptation. For instance, the dinucleotide CG
is appreciably overrepresented in E. coli, but significantly
underrepresented in all P. marinus, including the strains
which have similar G+C-content to that of E. coli. Contrasting trends in E. coli and P. marinus strains are also
observed for the dinucleotides AG/CT and GA/TC. The
dinucleotide abundance values of AC/GT are also significantly underrepresented in all P. marinus strains, but
not in E. coli.
However, significant intra-Prochlorococcus differences
are also present in dinucleotide abundance profiles, on
the basis of which all P. marinus strains under study
may be divided into three distinct groups:
(a) Group LLa, comprised of the two LL strains P.
marinus MIT 9313 (LL1) and MIT 9303 (LL2) - both
having larger genomes (≈ 2.5 MB) and average G+Ccontent ≈ 50%: Genomes of these two strains are

characterized by significantly high values of CA/TG and
low values of TA (Additional file 3). The values for AT,
AC/GT and CG are also relatively higher and that of
CC/GG are lower, as compared to other P. marinus
strains.
(b) Group LLb, consisting of other four LL strains
(LL3, LL4, LL5 and LL6), characterized by relatively
lower G+C-content (between 35% - 37%) and small genome size (< 2 MB): These four LL strains exhibit highly
similar patterns, which are visibly distinct mainly at CA/
TG and CC/GG from the almost overlapping profile of
HL strains (Figure 3).
(c) Group HL, including all 6 HL strains having
reduced genome and G+C-content ≈ 31%: The dinucleotide CC/GG is significantly overrepresented only in
the HL Prochlorococcus strains.
Clustering by amino acid composition reveals a balance
between genomic G+C-bias and Prochlorococcus-specific
selection forces

In an attempt to investigate whether the strand-specific
mutational bias has any impact on amino acid usage in
gene products of LL strains of P. marinus in comparison
to their HL counterparts, we performed correspondence
analysis (COA) on relative amino acid usage (RAAU) of
the encoded proteins of each organism. No clear

segregation can be observed for proteins encoded by the
leading and lagging strands in any of the P. marinus
genomes under study (data not shown), implying that
the strand-specific mutational bias has hardly any influence on the amino acid compositions of the gene products of LL strains of Prochlorococcus. In all the strains
of P. marinus, the first three axes generated by COA on
amino acid usage cumulatively explain about 39% of the
total variability. Both mean hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the encoded proteins exhibit strong correlations
with either of the first two principal axes and seem to
be the major contributors to amino acid usage variation
in P. marinus proteins (data not shown).
In order to check whether the amino acid usage patterns in LL and HL groups of Prochlorococcus follow
any specific trends, we carried out a clustering analysis
on relative abundances (with respect to E. coli) of different amino acid residues of each organism (Figure 4) in a
dataset comprising of all P. marinus strains under study
along with a cyanobacterial representative Cyanothece
sp. (having G+C-content similar to those of E. coli and
two LLa strains), and two non-cyanobacterial species the bacteroidetes/chlorobi G. foresetii (average genomic
G+C-content = 36.6%, similar to those of LLb strains)
and the epsilon-proteobacteria C. jejuni (average genomic G+C-content = 30.3%, similar to those of HL

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/103

strains). Branching patterns suggest an optimization
between the G+C-bias and P. marinus group-specific
selection for amino acid usage. As can be seen in Figure
4, a major branching between the organisms occurs
according to the average genomic G+C-content. Organisms having average G+C-content around 50% - viz. E.
coli, Cyanothece sp. and the two LLa strains - cluster
together under the node ‘a’, while the organisms with
lower G+C-content (30-37%) form a distinct cluster at
the node ‘b’. However, within the A+T-rich or relatively
G+C-rich clusters, finer segregation occur according to
taxonomy, i.e., between the cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial species. For instance, node ‘a’ acts as a bifurcation point between the gamma-proteobacteria E. coli
and the three cyanobacterial species, followed by
another bifurcation at node ‘c’ between the two LLa
strains and non-Prochlorococcus species Cyanothece.
Similarly, within the A+T-rich cluster, the HL strains of
P. marinus with G+C-content ≈ 30-31% club together
with their LLb counterparts (average G+C-content ≈ 3537%) under the node ‘f’, distinctly separated from C.
jejuni and G. foresetii. Node ‘f’ also acts as the point of
divergence of LLb and HL strains, which cluster separately under the nodes ‘g’ and ‘j’ (containing 4 LLb
strains and 6 HL strains respectively). These observations indicate that though the amino acid usage patterns
in Prochlorococcus are primarily guided by their directional mutational bias, other selection pressures must
also have exerted some significant influence. Three cyanobacterial species, namely Cyanothece sp., P. marinus

Page 7 of 15

str. MIT9313 (LL1) and P. marinus str. MIT9303 (LL2)
- all have nearly the same G+C-content as E. coli, yet
their amino acid usage abundance patterns are quite distinct from that of E. coli. Similarly, the LLb and HL
strains of P. marinus display significant differences in
amino acid usage patterns from that of non- P. marinus
species (G. foresetii and C. jejuni, respectively) having
similar G+C-content. A careful examination of Figure 4
delineates the Prochlorococcus-specific features in amino
acid usage patterns. For instance, as compared to E. coli,
Thr is underrepresented in all strains of P. marinus,
including those having ≈ 50% G+C-content (and also in
C. jejuni, but not in Cyanothece and G. forsetti). Ser is
overrepresented in all A+T-rich P. marinus species,
especially in comparison to C. jejuni and G. foresetii.
Tyr is typically underrepresented in all Prochlorococcus
strains, compared to the non-Prochlorococcus species of
similar G+C-content. Frequency of Phe is also relatively
lower in Prochlorococcus in comparison to any other
species of similar G+C-bias. All these observations suggest that the amino acid usage in P. marinus is a result
orchestrated by the forces of species-specific selection
acting on mutational bias and genetic drift.
Niche-specific variations in physicochemical and
structural features of Prochlorococcus orthologs

In an attempt to have a better insight into the nichespecific physicochemical and structural properties of P.
marinus proteins, if any, we performed a comparative
analysis of the core proteins, i.e., proteins found to be

from the members of group LLa to group LLb to group
HL. In other words, the core proteins of LL strains are,
in general, more hydrophobic, more acidic, less aromatic
and less stable than their HL orthologs. The comparison
of structural properties reveals that among the three
groups, members of the group LLa exhibit the highest
propensity for helix formation and lowest propensity for
beta-sheet and coil formation. LLb group orthologs are
characterized by intermediate values for all three propensities, and group HL orthologs display trends opposite to that of group LLa - i.e. lowest propensity for
helix formation and highest propensity for beta-sheet/
coil formation (Table 3).
However, one may argue that these inter-group variations in physicochemical properties and structural propensities of P. marinus strains can only be a reflection
of their varying genomic G+C-bias rather than being
niche specific. In order to address this issue, we carried
out a comparative analysis of various proteomic features
of orthologous sequences from three representative
P. marinus strains LL1, LL3 and HL3 (from groups LLa,
LLb and HL respectively) with those of three other caynobacterial species, Synechococcus elongatus (55.5% G
+C-content), Synechocystis sp.(47.4% G+C-content) and
Nostoc sp.(41.3% G+C-content) as well as three non-cyanobacterial species namely E. coli, Bacillus cereus and
Francisella tularensis. The non-cyanobacterial species
were chosen as reference organisms, due to their close
average genomic G+C-content to those of LLa, LLb and

HL strains (50.8%, 35.5% and 32.3% for E. coli, B. cereus
&F. tularensis, respectively), and the significant number
of orthologs they share with these P. marinus strains.
Values of different physicochemical parameters and
structural propensities of the orthologs from these reference species and the representative P. marinus strains
are summarized in the Table 4. It reveals that the values
of any specific parameter, say of hydrophobicity index
or instability index, is in most cases, not comparable
between orthologs from P. marinus strains and outgroup organisms of similar G+C-bias. For instance, the
values observed for B. cereus are quite different from
those of LL3 - the genomic G+C-content of both being
quite similar. The average pI value of B. cereus proteins
is not only significantly less than that of their LL3
orthologs, it is even lesser than LL1 proteins. The average instability index of B. cereus proteins is also much
less than that of the Prochlorococcus orthologs. The
average helix forming propensity of B. cereus proteins is
closer to that of LL1 proteins, while their beta sheet
forming propensity is almost same to that of HL3 proteins. Similarly, the aromaticity and instability indices or
helix forming propensities of E. coli proteins are significantly different from those of Prochlorococcus strain
LL1, while most of the F. tularensis protein characteristics differ widely from those of the P. marinus HL3
strain with similar G+C-bias. Comparing between the
cyanobacterial species, amino acid indices and secondary
structural traits of Synechococcus (the closest taxonomic
relative of Prochlorococcus) seem to be guided by its G
+C-content (Table 4: Set IV). The hydrophobicity values
and the helix-forming propensities of the other two cyanobacteria also gradually decrease with decrease in
genomic G+C-content within the set. However, the
other indices and structural traits of Synechocystis and

Nostoc do not reflect any systematic co-variation with
their G+C-bias. These observations suggest that the variations in proteomic features of Prochlorococcus might
not be a mere outcome of their G+C-bias, there could
be significant influence of other selection forces as well.
Higher positive selection between orthologs from strains
with opposite light optima

In order to better understand the evolutionary trends in
different P. marinus species having distinct genome
composition and/or light adaptation, the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions (dS and dN)
were calculated between 519 orthologous sequences of
LL1, LL6 and HL3 strains (representatives of groups
LLa, LLb and HL respectively), and the number of genes
showing positive selection (dN > dS) between each possible pair of organisms were determined. Figure 5 depicts
a Venn diagram for the number of positively selected
genes among the strains under study. Out of 519 orthologs, maximum number of positively selected genes (90)
is found between LL1 and HL3 - the strains that differ
in genome size, G+C-composition and light adaptation.

selected (dN/dS > 1) orthologs between pairs of different
Prochlorococcus strains. The 519 core proteins of 3 representative
organisms (LL1, LL6 & HL3) were considered for the analysis. dN/dS
could be calculated for 414 × 3 pairs out of the 519 × 3 pairs
considered.

Page 10 of 15

The strains LL6 and HL3 having nearly similar genome
size and G+C-bias, but distinct light optima come next
with 78 positively selected genes among them and the
two strains LL1 and LL6 of the same light group, but
distinct genome size and G+C-bias, exhibit the minimum number (68) of positively selected genes. Among
these three sets, there are several genes, which are positively selected between any two out of the three possible
pairs of P. marinus strains under study. There are 25
genes selected positively between HL3 and either of the
LL strains i.e. between the strains of two opposite light
optima, irrespective of their G+C-bias and genome size.
17 genes are positively selected between the strains of
distinct G+C-bias and genome size - between the relatively G+C-rich and large genome strain LL1 and either
of the A+T-rich and reduced genome strains LL6 or
HL3. Only 7 genes display common positive selection
between LL6 and LL1 (the strains with similar light
adaptation but of different genome size and G+C-bias)
and between LL6 and HL3 (the strains having relatively
lower G+C-bias and genome size). Thus, our study indicates the presence of a considerable positive selection
pressure in diversification of the Prochlorococcus core
genome, which in turn, suggests an appreciable role of
random genetic drift in vertical niche partitioning of the
strains.
Pronounced effects of directional mutational bias in the
intergenic regions of HL P. marinus strains

In an attempt to examine whether the G+C-bias of
intergenic regions of the different strains (with varying
genomic G+C-content), follow trends similar to the
respective coding regions, G+C-content of intergenic
regions were calculated. The intergenic regions are, in
general, more A+T rich than the overall genomic G+Ccontent of respective organisms (Additional file 4). Also,
the A+T bias of intergenic regions are more pronounced
in HL strains than their LL counterparts.
Unconstrained intergenic regions are more prone to
mutational change. Accumulation of unfavourable mutations may render a coding region nonfunctional, facilitating its removal from the genome in course of time.
We have identified probable remnants of coding
sequences within intergenic regions of two representative Prochlorococcus strains having reduced genomes
(LL6 and HL3). The G+C-content of these remnants

are, in most cases, higher than that of average intergenic
DNA, but lower than the average G+C-content of the
bona fide coding regions (Table 5 and Additional file 5).
These particular non-coding sequences, therefore, may
be remnants of coding sequences that are in the process
of being eliminated from the genome.

Discussion
Exhibition of a wide range of genomic G+C-content
(30.8% to 50.7%) and genome sizes (1.6 Mb to 2.7 Mb)
by different strains of P. marinus, and also their adaptation to different ecological niches - a situation encountered rarely in the microbial world - demand detailed
investigation. We have performed a large scale comprehensive study to critically analyze the direction and
strength of mutational pressure and genomic/proteomic
determinants associated with the adaptation of these
strains to oceanic environments subject to different light
intensities. From this study it appears that (a) low light
adapted (LL) free living Prochlorococcus strains exclusively show strand asymmetry in synonymous codon
usage, (b) general trends in amino acid usage in LLa,
LLb and HL strains differ appreciably, (c) distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by LLa, LLb
and HL strains, (d) higher number of genes have undergone positive selection between the strains with distinct
light optima, i.e., between LL and HL strains and (e)
there are definite trends in variations of different physicochemical and structural features in core proteomes of
different groups of Prochlorococcus strains, which are
not solely governed by their genomic G+C-bias. These
observations, along with the findings on large-scale genome reduction associated with gradual increase in genomic A+T-content and extensive chromosomal
rearrangements between different strains, strongly suggest a stepwise diversification of Prochlorococcus strains,
in course of their adaptive evolution (Figure 6).
Among several genome/proteome signatures of P.
marinus strains reported for the first time in this work,
the most notable is the impact of pronounced replication-strand-specific asymmetry on synonymous codon
usage, observed exclusively in the low light adapted
strains of P. marinus (Figure 1). This is noteworthy for
two reasons: (i) Presence of pronounced strand-specific
mutational bias with detectable influence on codon
usage was observed so far mostly for obligatory

Evolution method (CNI algorithm), with the software MEGA (version 4).

intracellular microorganisms having reduced genomes
[2,3,5]. Interestingly, all 6 LL strains of P. marinus exhibiting strand-specific synonymous codon usage are freeliving and two of them (LL1 and LL2) are characterized
by relatively larger genome size. On the other hand, for
the reduced genomes of 6 HL strains, no perceivable
sign of strand asymmetry could be seen in their usage
of synonymous codons. (ii) In most of the other microbial genomes with asymmetric mutational bias, the
genes, especially the highly expressed ones, are present
in the leading strands of replication in significantly
higher numbers, the phenomenon referred to as replicational-transcriptional selection [2,3,34,35]. No such definite significant bias in gene distribution is observed in
either of the strands of replication in the LL strains of
P. marinus. Strand asymmetry in codon usage of Prochlorococcus, therefore, may not bear an explicit causality to the event of genome reduction or with
replicational-transcriptional selection.
The homogenization of the strand asymmetric bias in
the HL strains may be attributed, at least partially, to
the absence of a specific type of DNA repair enzyme
MutY. In previous studies of Rocap et al. [20] and
Dufresne et al. [25] it have been shown that the enzyme
MutY is absent in the strain P. marinus str. CCMP1986
(HL3), while it is present in P. marinus str. CCMP1375
(LL3) and P. marinus str. MIT9313 (LL1). MutY, an A/
G-specific DNA glycosylase, acts with MutT (NTP

pyrophosphohydrolase) and MutM (formamido-pyrimidine-DNA glycosylase) to avoid misincorporation of oxidized guanine (8-oxoG) in DNA and to repair the base
mismatches A:8-oxoG [37]. Knocking out both mutM
and mutY in E. coli results in a 1,000-fold increase of G:
C to A:T transversions in comparison to the wild-type
strain [38]. Our analysis reveals (through BLASTP
search) that mutY is present only in the LL strains, but
not in any of the 6 HL strains. The excess number of
‘G’s present in the leading strands of LL strains might
have transversed to ‘A’s in the HL strains due to the
absence of mutY in the later, and this in turn, caused a
simultaneous increase of ‘T’s in the lagging strands,
eventually leading to homogenization of the G+T and A
+C frequencies in two strands of replication in the HL
strains. Existing mutational drift towards A+T-enrichment in the HL strains might also have facilitated
achieving the uniformity in those strains. Further
insights may be accumulated in this regard with the
availability of more completely sequenced Prochlorococcus genomes in future.
In the process of gradual genome reduction, mutations
often accumulate in expendable genes, thereby transforming them, by degrees, to pseudogenes, to small fragments, to extinction [39]. In the reduced genomes of
P. marinus, we have found some putative remnants of
coding regions, the A+T-content of which are, in general, higher than that of coding regions, but lower than

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/103

other non-coding regions. This is in agreement with the
fact that the reduced genomes of P. marinus (especially
those of HL strains) are subject to a strong mutational
A+T-drift, and will therefore result in gradual A+Tenrichment of the genic remnants already released from
amino-acid-coding constraints in recent past. The base
composition of such remnants is expected to gradually
approach the A+T-content of bona fide non-coding
regions.
Comparison of orthologous gene synteny from five
representative strains having different genome size and
G+C-content clearly points at a high level of chromosomal rearrangement during genome shrinkage in Prochlorococcus. This finding is in agreement with earlier
findings on association of chromosomal rearrangement
events with higher rates of chromosomal evolution and/
or the phenomenon of genome reduction, as in Arabidopsis thaliana [40] and different endoparasites/endosymbionts [41,42]. Intra-chromosomal recombination at
duplicated sequences often results in deletion of intervening sequences, and rearrangement of flanking
regions, thereby leading to genome shrinkage [39].
Previous analyses with endosymbiotic or endoparasitic
organisms like Bartonella, Tropheryma, Buchnera, Wigglesworthia etc. [2,3,28,29] revealed that the phenomenon of genome reduction is normally associated with
population bottlenecks or other mechanisms such as
selective sweeps. In case of the hyperthermophile
Nanoarchaeum equitans, extreme genome reduction is a
feature of its thermoparasitic adaptation [1]. Although
our knowledge of bacterial populations in open oceans
is not exhaustive, it may certainly be assumed that P.
marinus ecotypes, the most abundant free-living marine
cyanobacteria and an important contributor to global
photosynthesis, are not subject to small population sizes
[13-15,30]. More importantly, the HL strains with
reduced genomes are apparently biologically superior
than their LL counterparts [21]. It is possible that the
bias towards reduced A+T rich genomes in HL strains
is consistent with cellular economy at regions with limited nitrogen and phosphorous near the ocean surface.
Scarcity of these elements that are essential in DNA
synthesis favors the incorporation of an AT base-pair
containing seven atoms of nitrogen, one less than a GC
base-pair. It is worth mentioning at this point that the
trends in amino acid usage in different P. marinus
strains, as observed in this study are quite compatible
with the earlier report by Lv et al. [43] on influence of
resource availability on proteome composition of these
species. For instance, increase in overall aromaticity
from LLa to LLb and HL strains is in full agreement
with the observations by Lv et al. [43] on increased carbon-content in the encoded proteins of different HL
strains as compared to that of LL strains. The average

Page 12 of 15

instability indices of the HL proteins are significantly
lower than those of their LL orthologs, suggesting that
the HL proteins, in general, may be more stable. Proteins characterized by higher percentages of helix structures, experience increased overall packing that imparts
more rigidity [44] and, hence, a decrease in regions with
helix-forming propensities with a subsequent increase in
coiled structures in HL proteins probably makes them
more flexible. It is also tempting to presume that higher
values of aromaticity and pI in HL proteins, as compared to LL orthologs, might facilitate cation-pi interactions in the former, imparting more stability. The
central issue in the adaptation of HL proteins to their
environmental niches may, therefore, be the conservation of their functional state, characterized by a wellbalanced optimization of stability and flexibility.

Conclusion
The current study advocates for the presence of adaptive
selection forces that might have played significant role
in governing Prochlorococcus evolution and fitness at the
genome and proteome levels. An optimization between
these adaptive forces and directional mutational bias has
set definite trends in molecular evolution of P. marinus.
This characterizes different P. marinus ecotypes with
distinct niche-specific compositional, physicochemical
and structural traits, thereby driving them chronologically towards increasing stability and/or fidelity.
Methods
Sequence retrieval

All predicted protein coding sequences and the complete genome sequences of the 12 different strains of P.
marinus were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank (listed
in Table 1). For comparison, the predicted protein coding sequences of E. coli (NC_000913.2), Bacillus cereus
(NC_003909.8), Francisella tularensis (NC_006570.1),
Synechococcus elongatus (NC_006576.1), Synechocystis
sp. (NC_000911.1), Nostoc sp. (NC_003272.1), Campylobacter jejuni (NC_003912.7), Cyanothece (NC_011884.1)
and Gramella forsetii (NC_008571.1) were also retrieved
from GenBank. Annotated ORFs, which encode proteins
less than 100 amino acids long, were not considered for
further analysis.
Determination of leading and lagging strand genes

In order to identify the replication origin (oriC) or termination (ter) sites we performed GC-skew (G-C/G+C)
analysis using a sliding window of 10 Kb along the genome sequence. The sites were validated by checking the
neighbouring gene organization (e.g. identified origins in
Prochlorococcus genomes were flanked by DNA polymerase beta subunit III gene on the 3’ side and the
Threonine synthatase gene on the 5’ side) and the

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/103

presence of DnaA boxes in their vicinity [45]. Based on
the predicted oriC and ter sites (Additional file 6), the
leading strands and lagging strands of replication for
each genomes were identified along with the genes
encoded on the two strands.
Multivariate analyses on synonymous codon and amino
acid usage and cluster analysis on amino acid usage

Correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous
codon usage (RSCU) and amino acid usage of genes/
proteins were performed on individual genomes in
order to identify any significant variation in the usage of
codons or amino acids, if present, and help ascertain the
underlying cause(s), using the program CODONW 1.4.2
[46].
To find out the variation in amino acid usage between
LL and HL Prochlorococcus strains, a cluster analysis on
standardized amino acid usage was carried out using
STATISTICA (version 6.0, published by Statsoft Inc.,
USA) for all 12 Prochlorococcus organisms (Table 1)
along with E. coli, Cyanothece, C. jejuni and G. forsetii
having G+C-content nearly equal to the different LL
and HL strains. The amino acid usage of E. coli was
chosen as a well-defined reference for standardizing the
amino acid composition for the analysis and to produce
an accompanying heat map. With the help of a program
developed in-house in Visual Basic, a 16 × 20 matrix
(heatmap) was generated, where the rows and the columns correspond to data sources (i.e., organisms in the
cluster) and standardized amino acid usage values,
respectively. The overrepresentation or underrepresentation of standardized amino acid usage values of the
organisms in the matrix are shown in green or red
colored blocks (Figure 4) respectively, and their intensities varying in accordance with their deviation from the
standard (yellow). The extreme left column represents
the genomic G+C-content of the respective organisms.
Dinucleotide analysis of DNA sequences

For all Prochlorococcus genomes and E. coli, the dinucleotide abundance for each possible dinucleotide was
calculated as the ratio between the observed and
expected frequencies of the concerned dinucleotide in
its genomic context [47]. Dinucleotide abundance values
generally represent the genomic signature of any species
[48] and here we were interested to see whether all Prochlorococcus genomes follow a similar trend or not.
Determination of orthologs

Stand alone BLAST package (ver. 2.2.18) was downloaded from the NCBI FTP site and using the package,
all-to-all BLASTN and BLASTP searches were performed with the genes from all the 12 strains of P. marinus. Orthologs across these organisms were defined for

Page 13 of 15

this study as protein coding genes having a BLASTP
sequence Identity ≥ 60%, not more than 20% difference
in length and E-value ≤ 1e-20. The resultant list of
‘orthologs’ were checked for consistency with the data
obtained from Genplot http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sutils/geneplot.cgi, which houses a pair-wise list of genes
giving mutually best BLASTP hits when all genes from
the genomes of any two organisms are ‘blasted’ against
each other. We have identified 519 orthologs present in
all 12 P. marinus genomes as their core proteome. The
stringent measures employed for the similarity search
ensure that these orthologs have been sufficiently conserved throughout the adaptive evolution of P. marinus,
and any niche-specific features deciphered from this
dataset would certainly not be a trivial outcome. For
comparative analysis with suitable outgroup organisms,
we retrieved orthologs of nine organisms including
three representative P. marinus strains (LL1, LL3 and
HL3), E. coli, B. cereus, F. tularensis, S. elongatus, Synechocystis sp. and Nostoc sp. from NCBI GenePlot by filtering the symmetrical best hits of protein homologs.
Estimation of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution patterns in orthologous sequences

Positive selection can be inferred from a higher proportion of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions
per site (dN/dS > 1). The dN and dS values were calculated for 519 orthologs of LL1, LL6 and HL3 using the
software MEGA (version 4) [49]. The calculation was
based on the modified Nei-Gojobori Jukes-Cantor
method that considers deviations from an equal frequency of transitions and transversions [50,51].
Gene synteny visualization

Comparison of the gene repertoire or gene synteny
between 5 representative Prochlorococcus strains (LL1,
LL3, LL6, HL3 and HL4) were carried out using a Java
program developed in-house. It can represent the
arrangement of orthologous genes between two chromosomes by joining the locations of the orthologs by differently coloured lines. The red lines represent the genes
present on the same strand (+/-) and blue lines represent orthologs coded on different strands of chromosomes being compared.
Calculation of codon/amino acid usage indices and
estimation of secondary structure of proteins

Indices like relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)
[52], G+C and G+T-content at third codon positions
(GC3 & GT3 respectively), aromaticity and average
hydrophobicity (Gravy score) [53] of protein coding
sequences were calculated to find out the factors influencing codon and amino acid usages. The isoelectric
point (pI) and instability index [54] of each protein were

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/103

calculated using the Expasy proteomics server [55]. Secondary structures of the identified orthologs were computed using the software PREDATOR [56] and the
varying percentages of the structural components (viz.
helices, sheets, and coils) in proteins from different
strains were also noted.
Identification of intergenic regions

The sequences coding for mRNAs and structural RNAs
were noted from the protein table and structural RNA
table respectively (available from NCBI) for each of the
organisms. Intergenic regions were identified by subtracting the regions of these gene sequences from the
whole genome. The overall G+C-content of the intergenic regions were calculated after concatenating all the
intergenic sequences together, for each of the 12 Prochlorococcus strains. For identification of probable pseudogenes/remnants of coding DNA in LL6 and HL3 (two
representative strains of groups LLb and HL having
reduced genomes), their intergenic regions were subjected to a similarity search (tBlastX) against a pool of
Prochlorococcal genes (consisting of sequences from
three representative strains LL1, LL6, HL3). 48 hits for
LL6 and 93 hits for HL3 were identified, having
sequence identities ≥ 30%, aligned lengths ≥ 15 amino
acids, and E-values < 1e-3.
