Background

Conclusion

The source of the HIV-1 virions that emerge during suppressive HAART can be identified by a phylogenetic analysis that compares the virions present in plasma with
those in cell reservoirs. However, the difficulty found in
the characterization of very low plasma RNA could be
addressed by the analyses of LTR circles.

These findings support our hypothesis showing that episomal DNA is apparently reflecting the viral quasispecies
present in plasma RNA, especially in the patient with the
lowest viral load. This method is a rapid and economic
alternative to selectively amplify HIV-1 regions from LTR
circles.

Materials and methods
We developed a protocol using an ATP dependent plasmid safe DNAse that selectively digests linear DNA to
purify LTR circles from chromosomal DNA. The β-actin
gene was amplified to detect contamination from linear
DNA. A phylogenetic analysis of the env HIV regions of
the LTR circles, PBMCs and free virus in plasma from three
patients undergoing HAART within 27 to 852 viral copies/
ml viral load range was undertaken to determine if LTR
episomes are labile in vivo and suitable for analysis.

Results
The phylogenetic trees and Kimura 2-parameter mean distances show a higher homogeneity within the plasma
RNA and LTR episomal DNA groups of each patient. In
addition, Wilcoxon's signed ranks tests (p < 0.05) from
101 clones, demonstrated that the nucleotide distances
between the episomes vs. plasma and episomes vs.
PBMCs were significantly different for the three patients.
