Abstract
Background: Telomeres are specialized structures at the end of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome
stability and cell viability. The importance of telomeric proteins for telomere maintenance has increased our interest in
the identification of homologues within the genus Leishmania. The mammalian TRF1 and TRF2 proteins, for example,
bind double-stranded telomeres via a Myb-like DNA-binding domain and are involved with telomere length regulation
and chromosome end protection. In addition, TRF2 can modulate the activity of several enzymes and influence the
conformation of telomeric DNA. In this work, we identified and characterized a Leishmania protein (LaTRF) homologous
to both mammalian TRF1 and TRF2.
Results: LaTRF was cloned using a PCR-based strategy. ClustalW and bl2seq sequence analysis showed that LaTRF
shared sequence identity with the Trypanosoma brucei TRF (TbTRF) protein and had the same degree of sequence
similarities with the dimerization (TRFH) and the canonical DNA-binding Myb-like domains of both mammalian TRFs.
LaTRF was predicted to be an 82.5 kDa protein, indicating that it is double the size of the trypanosome TRF
homologues. Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization showed
that LaTRF, similarly to hTRF2, is a nuclear protein that also associates with parasite telomeres. Native and full length
LaTRF and a mutant bearing the putative Myb-like domain expressed in bacteria bound double-stranded telomeric
DNA in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that LaTRF interacted specifically with telomeres in vivo.
Conclusion: The nuclear localization of LaTRF, its association and co-localization with parasite telomeres and its high
identity with TbTRF protein, support the hypothesis that LaTRF is a Leishmania telomeric protein.
Background
More than 20 Leishmania species are pathogenic to
humans and cause leishmaniasis of differing severity.
Leishmania amazonensis (Trypanosomatidae), the parasite studied in this work, is common in Brazil and causes
a wide spectrum of clinical leishmaniasis [1]. The parasite
can cause opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients
and co-infections have been reported in 34 countries.
There are no adequate methods for controlling leishmaniasis and current available treatments are inefficient
[2,3]. Consequently, most of the ongoing research for new

drugs to combat the disease is based on post-genomic
approaches [4].
Telomeres are specialized structures at the end of chromosomes and consist of stretches of repetitive DNA (5'TTAGGG-3' in vertebrates and trypanosomatids) and
associated proteins [5]. Telomeres are essential for maintaining genome stability and cell viability, with dysfunctional telomeres triggering a classic DNA-damage
response that enables double-strand breaks and cell cycle
arrest [6].
There are three classes of telomeric proteins, viz., proteins that bind specifically to single-stranded G-rich
DNA, proteins that bind to double-stranded DNA and
proteins that interact with telomeric factors. Other nontelomeric proteins, such as the DNA repair proteins

Mre11 and Rad51, also play important roles at telomeres
[7,8]. In mammals and yeast, telomeric proteins are organized in high order protein complexes known as shelterin
or telosome that cap chromosome ends and protect them
from fusion or degradation by DNA-repair processes
[9,10,7]. These complexes, which are abundant at chromosome ends but do not accumulate elsewhere, are present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle and their action
is limited to telomeres [7,8]. Shelterin/telosome proteins
include members or functional homologues of the TRF
(TTAGGG repeat-binding factor) or telobox protein family, such as TRF1 and TRF2 from mammals [11] and
Tebp1 [12], Taz1 [13] and Tbf1 [14] from yeast. All of
these proteins bind double-strand telomeres via a Myblike DNA-binding domain, which is one of the features
that characterize proteins that preferentially bind doublestranded telomeric DNA [15-17].
In humans, TRF1 may control the length of telomeric
repeats through various mechanisms. For example, TRF1
can control telomerase access through its interaction
with TIN2, PTOP/PIP1 and the single-stranded telomeric
DNA-binding protein POT1. TRF1 may also regulates
telomerase activity by interacting with PINX1, a natural
telomerase inhibitor. In comparison, TRF2 is involved in
many functions, including the assembly of the terminal tloop, negative telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection [18,11,16]. The shelterin complex is
anchored along the length of telomeres by both TRF2 and
TRF1 [19], whereas in conjunction with POT1, TRF2 is
thought to stimulate WRN and BLM helicases to dissociate unusual structures during telomeric replication [20].
TRF2 also interacts with enzymes that control G-tail formation, the nucleases XPF1-ERCC1, the MRE11-RAD50NBS1 (MRN) complex, the RecQ helicase WRN and the
5' exonuclease Apollo [8]. Loss of TRF2 leads to NHEJmediated chromosome end-fusion and the accumulation
of factors that form the so-called telomere dysfunctioninduced foci (TIFs) [21,22]. Thus, TRF2 can modulate the
activity of several enzymes and influence the conformation of telomeric DNA.
Only a few telomeric proteins that bind the doublestranded form of telomeric DNA have been described in
Leishmania and in their trypanosome counterparts
[17,23]. Homologues of human TRF have been found in
the genomes of T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major based on
sequence similarities to the C-terminal Myb-like DNA
binding domain. For example, the T. brucei TRF2 homologue known as TbTRF shares a similar telomere endprotection function with vertebrate TRF2 [24].

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the putative L. amazonensis TRF gene
homologue

Using data mining via the OmniBLAST server we
searched the whole L. major genome database http://

Page 2 of 9

www.ebi.ac.uk/parasites/leish.html for a putative
sequence that shared similarities with the vertebrate
TRF1 and TRF2 proteins. For this search, we used the
most conserved part of both human proteins, the C-terminal fragment containing the Myb-like DNA binding
domain. The search returned a single sequence (GenBank
acc. no. XP_001682531.1) that encoded a hypothetical
protein (GenBank acc. no. Q4QDR7, GeneDB_Lmajor
LmjF18.1250), the C-terminus of which shared ~30%
identity and 50-55% similarity with the vertebrate TRF
Myb-like domain, according to the blast2 sequence analysis (Table 1).
Based on the L. major sequence, primers were designed
for PCR amplification of the entire homologous sequence
from L. amazonensis with genomic DNA as the template.
PCR products of 2,931 bp were cloned into the vector
pCR2.1 and both insert strands were sequenced (data not
shown). The deduced polypeptide sequence of 796 amino
acid residues contained a putative C-terminal Myb-like
DNA binding domain between residues 684-733, according to psi-blast (Fig 1 - top). The LaTRF gene (GenBank
acc. no. EF559263) shared high sequence identity and
similarity to the putative L. major TRF, and to hypothetical L. infantum and L. braziliensis TRFs (Table 1). The
sequence conservation between LaTRF and the trypanosome TbTRF and the putative TcTRF homologues
decreased to 35-45% identity (Table 1), consistent with
the known evolutionary relationships among these
organisms. The Leishmania TRF homologues encode the
largest TRF protein (~82.5 kDa) described so far. The fact
that the Leishmania proteins showed much greater
homology with each other than with other protozoan
proteins and that they are the largest TRF described so
far resembles the situation for Leishmania telomerase
protein [25].
In addition, like TbTRF, LaTRF shared sequence similarities with the canonical Myb-like domain and with the
TRFH dimerization domain of human TRF1 and TRF2
(Fig 1-bottom and Table 1), but no sequence similarities
were found with any other telobox protein (data not
shown). Together, these results indicate that although
LaTRF shares high sequence similarity with TbTRF, probably because the two species are phylogenetically related
[26], further studies are required to confer any functions
to the Leishmania TRF homologue identified here.
LaTRF is a nuclear protein that co-localizes with L.
amazonensis telomeres

In exponentially growing L. amazonensis promastigotes,
LaTRF was detected only in nuclear protein extracts. A
single ~82.5 kDa protein band was detected using antiLaTRF serum (Fig 2 - top panel: lane 1). No protein was
detected in cytoplasmic and total protein extracts (Fig 2 top panel: lanes 2 and 3), indicating that LaTRF is a
nuclear protein with very low intracellular abundance. As

a control, Western blots were revealed with anti-LaRPA-1
serum, which recognizes a ~51.2 kDa telomeric protein
band [23] (Fig 2 - bottom panel: lane 1) and also its phosphorylated forms (Fig 2 - bottom panel: lane 2; da Silveira
& Cano, unpublished data).
We also developed an immunofluorescence assay combined with FISH, using anti-LaTRF serum and a PNAtelomere probe specific for TTAGGG repeats. As shown
in Fig 3 (panels p1-4, merged images a and b), LaTRF is a
nuclear protein that partially co-localizes with parasites
telomeres, since some of the LaTRF signal coincided with

telomeric foci and some did not (Fig 3, panels p1-4). In
most cells, LaTRF appears as a diffuse signal spread all
over the nucleoplasm and only in some cases it forms
large punctuated foci, which seems to co-localize with the
telomeric DNA (yellow dots in Fig 3, panels p2 and p4).
Similarly, in humans, the hTRF2 protein also appears in
the form of punctuate foci that does not completely associate with telomeres [18], which is in agreement with
other cellular functions played by this protein [27,28]. In
contrast, the T. brucei TRF protein (TbTRF) appears to
co-localize with most telomeres at all stages of the cell

Whether LaTRF also has other cellular roles or if its association with telomeres occurs in a cell cycle dependent
manner is not clear at this stage.
LaTRF interacts in vitro and in vivo with L. amazonensis
telomeres using a Myb-like DNA binding domain

EMSA assays were done with renatured protein extracts
containing full length LaTRF, the Myb-like DNA binding
domain (LaTRFMyb) (Figs 4 and 5, see additional file 1)
and with L. amazonensis nuclear extracts (Fig 6), to investigate whether LaTRF, like its vertebrate and trypanosome counterparts [18,24], was able to bind doublestranded telomeric DNA in vitro.
The full-length recombinant protein and its deletion
mutant were expressed in very low amounts and in non-

Figure 3 LaTRF partially co-localizes with L. amazonensis telomeres. LaTRF (red), using anti-LaTRF serum, was combined with FISH
(green) using a PNA-telomere probe specific for TTAGGG repeats. DAPI
(blue) was used to stain DNA in the nucleus (N) and in the kinetoplast
(K). Images were organized in panels p1-p4 showing the co-localization patterns in merged (a): telomeres and LaTRF, and in merged (b):
DAPI, telomeres and LaTRF. Merged images were done using NIS elements software (v. Br 2.30).

Figure 4 Recombinant LaTRF and the mutant bearing the C-terminal Myb domain bind in vitro double-stranded telomeric DNA.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were done using radiolabeled double-stranded telomeric DNA (LaTEL) as probe. Protein:DNA
complexes were separated in a 4% PAGE in 1X TBE. EMSA was done
with E. coli BL21 protein extract (lane 2), recombinant full length LaTRF
(lanes 3-6) and a mutant bearing the C-terminal Myb domain (lanes 79). A supershift assay was done with anti-LaTRF serum (lane 6). Assays
were also done in the presence of 20 fold excess of non-labeled LaTEL
as specific competitor (lanes 4 and 8) or 100 fold excess of doublestranded non-specific poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] DNA (lanes 5 and 9). In lane
1, no protein was added to the binding reaction. The original gel image

soluble form in the E. coli system (data not shown) making their purification by conventional chromatography
very difficult. Therefore, protein expression was checked
by Western blot using anti-LaTRF serum and anti-His tag
monoclonal antibody (data not shown).
As shown in Fig 4, recombinant full length LaTRF and
the mutant bearing only the C-terminal Myb-domain
were able to bind specifically the double-stranded telomeric DNA (LaTEL). Competition assays showed that the
complexes formed by both recombinant proteins were
completely abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled
LaTEL and that there was no competition for binding
when excess of non-specific poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] doublestranded DNA was used (Fig 4, lanes 4, 5, 8 and 9). Supershift assay with anti-LaTRF serum, which recognizes a Nterminal epitope in the protein, confirmed that full length
LaTRF forms a robust complex with labeled LaTEL (Fig 4,
lane 6), possibly because the binding of anti-LaTRF stabilized the LaTRF-LaTEL complex, blocking the action of
other non-specific binding activity in the extract. When
competitors were added to the supershift reactions with
anti-LaTRF serum, the binding specificity of recombinant
LaTRF for LaTEL was confirmed (Fig 5, lanes 2-4). The
complex was almost totally abolished in the presence of

Figure 5 Supershift and competition assays confirm that recombinant full length LaTRF bind in vitro double-stranded telomeric
DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were done using radiolabeled double-stranded telomeric DNA (LaTEL) as probe. Protein:DNA complexes were separated in a 4% PAGE in 1X TBE. EMSA was
done with recombinant full length LaTRF and anti-LaTRF serum in the
absence (lane 2) and in the presence of 20 fold excess of non-labeled
LaTEL as specific competitor (lane 3) or 100 fold excess of doublestranded non-specific DNA (poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC]) as non specific competitor (lane 4). In lane 1 reaction was done in the presence of LaTEL

excess unlabeled LaTEL (Fig 5, lane 3) and no competition was detected in the presence of non-specific DNA
(Fig 5, lane 4). The results presented above suggest that
recombinant LaTRF binds LaTEL potentially via the
putative Myb-like DNA binding domain indicating a role
for the C-terminal region of LaTRF in mediating
sequence-specific binding to telomeric DNA.
Nuclear extracts were obtained from log phase L. amazonensis promastigotes in order to check if native LaTRF
was also able to bind double-stranded telomeric DNA
(LaTEL) in vitro, (Fig 6). The results showed the presence
of LaTRF activity in these extracts, as part of the complex
formed with the nuclear proteins and LaTEL (Fig 6, lane
2) was supershifted by the anti-LaTRF serum (Fig 6, lane
6). In addition, competition assays showed that this complex was unaffected by excess of poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] (Fig
6, lane 3), used as the non-specific competitor, but it was
almost completely abolished in the presence of excess
unlabeled LaTEL (Fig 6, lane 4). Supershift experiments

Figure 6 Nuclear extracts obtained from L. amazonensis promastigotes contain LaTRF bind activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were done using radiolabeled double-stranded telomeric
DNA (LaTEL) as probe. Protein:DNA complexes were separated in a 4%
PAGE in 1X TBE. In lanes 2-6, EMSA was done with nuclear extracts obtained from L. amazonensis promastigotes. In lane 2, the reaction was
done in the absence of competitors. In lanes 3 and 4, binding reactions
were done respectively, in presence of 100 fold excess of doublestranded non-specific DNA (poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC]) and 20 fold excess of
non-labeled LaTEL. In lane 5, a supershift assay was done with anti-LaTRF serum and in the presence of 20 fold excess of non-labeled LaTEL
and in lane 6, the supershift assay shown in lane 5 was done in the absence of competitors.

using anti-LaTRF serum were done in the presence of
competitor to confirm that LaTRF was actually involved
in the formation of the retarded band (Fig 6, lane 5). Note
that the retarded shifted band disappeared due to the
competition by non-labeled LaTEL. Thus, these results
indicate that LaTRF is in part responsible for the binding
activity shown in these extracts and is probably a component of the Leishmania telomeric complex.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also suggested that LaTRF is a telomeric protein. The anti-LaTRF
serum immunoprecipitated L. amazonensis telomeric
DNA (Tel1) in vivo (Fig 7 - left) but did not immunoprecipitate the GT-rich kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) (Fig 7 right). The kDNA control represented by the UMS (universal mini-circle sequence) albeit GT-rich, is very representative of the general base composition of Leishmania
genomic DNA. In addition, it is a good control, since we
were able to show that it was co-immunoprecipitated by
two other Leishmania telomeric protein [17,23]. In a previous study, we described LaTBP1, a protein that specifically binds telomeric and GT-rich DNA in Leishmania.

Methods
Parasite cultures

Figure 7 LaTRF interacts with telomeric DNA in vivo. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (CHIP) of mid-log phase promastigotes cells using anti-LaTRF. Control experiments were done with chromatin immunoprecipitated in the presence of pre-immune serum and without
serum (mock). Total DNA (input) corresponds to 10% and 1% of the
amount of DNA in 108 cells cross-linked with the chromatin. Slot-blots
were hybridized with 5' end-labeled Tel1 probe (left) and re-hybridized
with the kDNA probe (right).

LaTBP1 has a centrally positioned Myb-like DNA binding
domain and is most likely a non-telobox protein that is
apparently related to the multifunctional yeast RAP1
telomeric protein and TFIIIB B" transcription factor [17].
Together with the putative LaTRF described here, these
are the only descriptions of proteins bearing a Myb-like
DNA binding domain that interact with double-stranded
telomeric DNA in Leishmania.
As mentioned here and elsewhere [26], the huge evolutionary distance between this protozoan and higher
eukaryotes presents a barrier when searching for protein
homologues in the genomes of these parasites. For example, no TRF1 homologues were found in trypanosomatid
genomes but the expression of hTRF1 in procyclic forms
of T. brucei caused telomere shortening and cell cycle
arrest, probably by displacing an unknown endogenous
telomeric factor [29]. RNAi knockdown of TbTRF
arrested bloodstream cells in G2/M and most of the procyclic cells in the S phase, and caused shortening of Grich single-stranded telomeric DNA. These findings suggest that TbTRF is probably the unknown endogenous
telomeric factor, which resembles the function of mammalian TRF2 at parasite telomeres [24]. The functions of
LaTRF at Leishmania telomeres remain to be determined.

Conclusions
In this report we describe the characterization of the
Leishmania TRF homologue and show that it is the largest TRF protein homologue described so far. This protein
contains a canonical C-terminal Myb-like DNA binding
domain as well as a putative and less conserved TRFH
dimerization domain [30]. In addition, LaTRF is
expressed exclusively in the nucleus and like its vertebrate
and trypanosome counterparts, binds to parasite telomeres in vitro and in vivo. It can also co-localize with parasite telomeres, despite being spread all over the
nucleoplasm in most cells, suggesting that LaTRF may

with 10% fetal calf serum (Cultilab), 25 mM HEPES and 1
× antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Cultilab) at 28°C.
Isolation of L. amazonensis genomic DNA and cloning of
the LaTRF gene

Total genomic DNA of L. amazonensis was prepared as
previously described [31]. LaTRF was cloned using a
PCR-based strategy. Primers were designed based on the
putative sequence LM16.2.Contig67 from L. major
(GeneDB_Lmajor LmjF18.1250) for amplification of the
complete LaTRF open reading frame (ORF) (See additional file 2: Table S1). The PCR product spanning the
entire L. amazonensis TRF ORF (2,391 bp) was obtained
by using the primers F1 and R1 and 1U of Platinum Taq
(Invitrogen) followed by cloning into the pCR® 2.1 cloning
vector (Invitrogen). The PCR product was sequenced
using specific primers and primers from the vector (See
additional file 2: Table S1). The primers F1 and R1 contained restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI (See additional
file 2: Table S1) to allow further cloning of the gene inframe with a N-terminal 6× His-tag into plasmid pET28a+ (Novagen).
Amino acid sequence alignments were done with
blastp, bl2seq, cds http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
and ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/ using
default parameters. The sequences used for these analyses were: hTRF2 (GenBank acc. no. Q15554), hTRF1
(GenBank acc. no. P54274.2), TbTRF (GenBank acc. no.
AY910010), putative LmTRF (TrEMBL acc. no.
Q4QDR7, GeneDB_Lmajor LmjF18.1250), TcTRF
(GenBank acc. no. XP_819954.1), LiTRF (GenBank acc.
no. XP_001464939.1) and LbTRF (GenBank acc. no.
XP_001564056.1). The L. amazonensis LaTRF gene
sequence was submitted to GenBank and is available
under the accession number EF559263.
Construction of an LaTRF deletion mutant (LaTRFMyb)

To verify the existence of a Myb-like DNA-binding
domain at the C-terminus of the protein, a deletion
mutant was constructed. The primers F3 and R1 (See
additional file 2: Table S1) were used to amplify the deletion mutant LaTRFMyb from genomic DNA, which contained the putative C-terminal Myb-like DNA binding
domain. This mutant has approximately 665 bp that span
nt 1726-2391. As with full length LaTRF, the LaTRFMyb
mutant was cloned into the pCR® 2.1 cloning vector

(Invitrogen), sequenced and subcloned into a pET28a+
expression vector.

Indirect immunofluorescence combined with Telomere
PNA FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)

Full length LaTRF and the deletion mutant LaTRFMybcloned into a pET 28a+ vector, were transformed in E.
coli strain BL21 DE3 RP codon plus cells for expression in
the presence of 1 mM IPTG. Both proteins were
expressed in low amounts and in non-soluble form, preventing them from being purified by affinity chromatography based on the 6× His-tag. To overcome this
problem, the non-soluble bacterial pellets containing
both proteins were solubilized in 7 M urea, sonicated in
the presence of 10 U of DNAse I (Sigma) and renatured
by dialysis in 50 mM glycine, pH 8.0. The presence of
each protein in the extracts was checked by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot probed
with anti-LaTRF serum and with an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen).

This assay was performed using previously described
protocols [32,33] with minor modifications. For IF, 106
promastigotes cells were washed in 1X PBS and fixed in
1% formaldehyde for 5 min at 4°C. After permeabilization
with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in 1X PBS) for 10 min at room
temperature, cells were incubated with 0.1 M Glycine (in
1X PBS) and attached to glass coverslips coated with 0.1%
poly-L-Lysine (Sigma). Anti-LaTRF serum was used to
detect LaTRF with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) as the secondary antibody followed
by telomere detection using a Telomere PNA FISH Kit/
FITC (DakoCytomation). VECTASHIELD® Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs) was used as the antifade mounting solution and to stain nuclear and kinetoplast DNA. The images were analyzed with a Nikon 80i
fluorescence microscope and captured with a digital
camera (Nikon). When necessary, images were superimposed using NIS elements software (v. Br 2.30).

Preparation of L. amazonensis total and nuclear extracts

EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay)

Promastigotes in mid-exponential growth were used to
obtain both extracts. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts
were prepared with a Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif )
adapted for L. amazonensis promastigotes in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors.
Total protein extracts were obtained using RIPA buffer
(150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100 and 0.1% SDS) in the presence of 10 U of DNase I and
1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) and incubated for 15 min at 4°C. Cell lysates were homogenized by
vortexing at maximum speed (5 bursts of 10 s each).
Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 9,300 ×g for 8
min at 4°C, to separate the total protein (supernatant)
from the cellular debris (pellet).
Both extracts were stored at -80°C and their protein
concentrations were measured by the Bradford dye-binding assay, using bovine serum albumin as standard.

All of the conditions for binding reactions and EMSA,
including binding temperature, protein concentrations in
the extracts and the double-stranded DNA probe
(LaTEL), were standardized in preliminary experiments.
LaTEL was constructed by using the γ [32P]ATP 5'-endlabeled oligonucleotides ssTel78G and ssTel78C, as
described by Lira et al. [17]. Assays were done by mixing
10 μg of renatured bacterial extracts containing full
length LaTRF or LaTRFMyb with approximately 2 pmol of
labeled probe (LaTEL) in 30 μl of EMSA buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl, 10%
glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 8.0) containing 10 ng of poly
[dI-dC] [dI-dC] and 10 ng of poly [dA-dT] [dA-dT]. Total
protein extracts of non-transformed E. coli were used as
controls. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at
room temperature and loaded onto a non-denaturing 4%
polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, 19:1, w/
w) in 1X TBE. After electrophoresis, the gels were
exposed to X-ray film.
Binding reactions were also done with crude nuclear
extracts obtained from 108 parasites (~2.3 μg of total proteins) and γ [32P]ATP labeled LaTEL (2 pmol) in EMSA
buffer containing a mixture of 10 ng of poly [dI-dC] [dIdC] and 10 ng of poly [dA-dT] [dA-dT].
Competition assays to test the binding specificity of proteins in both recombinant and nuclear extracts, were done
using 20 fold excess of unlabeled LaTEL (in relation to the
labeled probe) as the specific competitor and a 100 fold
excess (in relation to the labeled probe) of unlabeled double-stranded DNA poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] as the non-specific

Expression of LaTRF and the deletion mutant LaTRFMyb
proteins in E. coli

Western blot analysis

Different protein extracts obtained from 107 parasites
were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BIORAD) in Tris-glycine-methanol at 16°C. The membranes
were probed with rabbit anti-TRF2 serum raised against
the synthetic peptide Nt-APAVTTRKRPRSSDSP-Ct
(Sigma). The extracts were also probed with anti-LaRPA1 serum as a control [23,32]. In both cases, immunoreactive bands were revealed by using an Amplified Alkaline
Phosphatase Immun-Blot Assay Kit, according to the
manufacturer's instructions (BIO-RAD).

competitor. Supershift assays were done using full-length
recombinant LaTRF (10 μg) or native nuclear extracts from
108 parasites in the presence of ~30 μg of anti-LaTRF
serum in EMSA buffer containing labeled LaTEL as probe
and both poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] and poly [dA-dT] [dA-dT]
as above described. These assays were also performed in
the presence of 20 fold excess of non-labeled LaTEL and
100 fold excess of poly [dI-dC] [dI-dC] as described above.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was obtained from
promastigote forms of L. amazonensis parasites (0.8 × 108
cells/experiment) as described by Lira et al. [17]. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-LaTRF serum
and DNA was extracted after cross-link reversal. DNA
samples were slot-blotted and hybridized with Tel1 and
kDNA probes by using a previously established protocol.
Aliquots of 1% and 10% of total DNA used in each experiment (input) were tested separately. Control assays
included immunoprecipitation of chromatin with preimmuneserum (pre-immune) or without serum (mock).
The probes used were 5'-end labeled with γATP [32P]:
Tel1 (5'TTAGGG-3')3 and kDNA (5'-TTTCGGCTCGGGCGGTGAAAACTGGGGGTTGGTGTAAAAT-3'),
according to Lira et al. [17].
