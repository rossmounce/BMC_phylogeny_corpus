Abstract
Background: The DUB/USP17 subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes were originally identified as immediate early
genes induced in response to cytokine stimulation in mice (DUB-1, DUB-1A, DUB-2, DUB-2A). Subsequently we have
identified a number of human family members and shown that one of these (DUB-3) is also cytokine inducible. We
originally showed that constitutive expression of DUB-3 can block cell proliferation and more recently we have
demonstrated that this is due to its regulation of the ubiquitination and activity of the 'CAAX' box protease RCE1.
Results: Here we demonstrate that the human DUB/USP17 family members are found on both chromosome 4p16.1,
within a block of tandem repeats, and on chromosome 8p23.1, embedded within the copy number variable betadefensin cluster. In addition, we show that the multiple genes observed in humans and other distantly related
mammals have arisen due to the independent expansion of an ancestral sequence within each species. However, it is
also apparent when sequences from humans and the more closely related chimpanzee are compared, that duplication
events have taken place prior to these species separating.
Conclusions: The observation that the DUB/USP17 genes, which can influence cell growth and survival, have evolved
from an unstable ancestral sequence which has undergone multiple and varied duplications in the species examined
marks this as a unique family. In addition, their presence within the beta-defensin repeat raises the question whether
they may contribute to the influence of this repeat on immune related conditions.
Background
The role of ubiquitin in the regulation of cellular processes is ever expanding and has resulted in much
research being focused upon the proteins which are
responsible for the conjugation and removal of this moiety from proteins of interest. Deubiquitinating enzymes
are a large family of proteases that cleave ubiquitin from
ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and to date five families
consisting of approximately 95 members have been identified including the Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases
(UCHs), the Ubiquitin Specific Proteases (USPs), the
Machado-Joseph Disease Protein Domain Proteases

(MJDs), the Ovarian tumour Proteases (OTUs) and the
JAMM Motif Proteases [1,2]. The USPs, of which the
DUB/USP17 subfamily are members, are the largest family consisting in humans of approximately 56 members
[1,2]. They are cysteine proteases that are identified by
two well conserved motifs known as the Cys and His
boxes essential for their catalytic activity [1].
The DUB/USP17 subfamily of deubiquitinating
enzymes were originally identified as immediate early
genes induced in response to cytokine stimulation in
both mice (DUB-1, DUB-1A, DUB-2) and humans (DUB3)[3-6]. Several lines of evidence also suggest that this
family regulate cell growth and survival. DUB-1 expression results in cell cycle arrest prior to S-phase [7] and
DUB-2 expression can markedly inhibit apoptosis
induced by cytokine withdrawal [8]. More recently, we

have also reported that constitutive expression of DUB-3
can block cell proliferation [6,9] and subsequently we
have demonstrated that this is due to its regulation of the
ubiquitination and activity of the 'CAAX' box protease
Ras converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) [9].
Previous studies suggested that the murine genes originally identified were part of a head-to-tail repeat of DUB/
USP17 genes on mouse chromosome 7, that had most
likely resulted from a tandem duplication event [5]. In
addition, it has also been reported that human USP17 is
encoded as a 1593 bp ORF within RS447 [10], a megasatellite repeat, originally identified as a 4746 bp tandemly
repeated sequence from human chromosome 4p15 [11]
and shown to be highly polymorphic with an estimated
copy number range of 20 to 103 [12]. In addition to the
multiple repeat units on chromosome 4p15, it had also
been demonstrated that a limited number of repeat units
are present on human chromosome 8 [13]. Previously, we
interrogated the available sequence databases and identified multiple human ORFs which indicated that several
potential human members of this family existed [14]. In
addition, we identified 2 rat ORFs and one additional
murine ORF suggesting that the DUB/USP17 family
members were conserved through multiple species as
part of a conserved tandemly repeated sequence [14],
something supported by the previous observation that
RS447 recognises related sequences in a number of species [13]. In addition, we noted that each sequence
showed more intra-species rather than inter-species
homology suggesting that although the sequences in each
species had originated from a common ancestor, expansion in the number of family members had occurred after
the species had diverged [14].
These previous studies indicated that the DUB/USP17
proteases are an unusual family of genes incorporated
into a sequence which has tandemly replicated in at least
three separate species. However, this work was carried
out prior to the establishment of a robust and complete
human genome sequence and as a result a clear picture of
the structure of these repeat units and how they have
evolved was not possible. Therefore, the refinement of
the human genome sequence, as well as those of many
other species, now gives us the opportunity to revisit this
gene family to comprehensively analyse their distribution
and evolution.
In this study we have identified and mapped 32
sequences from the current human genome reference
build which are potential members of the DUB/USP17
family. We have also identified and mapped 7 murine and
3 rat sequences from their respective genomes, as well as
identifying multiple sequences from pan troglodytes
(chimpanzee), macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey), pongei
abelii (sumatran orangutan), canis familiarus (dog) and
bos taurus (cow) which would appear to represent mem-

bers of this protease family. In addition, we demonstrate
that the previous assumption that these sequences have
multiplied through tandem duplication is insufficient. In
particular we show that the sequences on human chromosome 8 are actually embedded within the previously
characterised beta-defensin cluster and that the copy
number variation observed for these sequences may be
associated with the variable copy number of this cluster.
In addition, we show that whilst head to tail repeats are
present in some species, this is not absolute. Finally, when
examining the relationships between the identified
sequences it is again apparent that the sequences present
in humans, mice, rats, cows and dogs have all been
derived from a common ancestor which has replicated
after these species have diverged. However, when the
chimpanzee and human sequences are compared it
would appear that there has been some duplication prior
to their divergence.

Results
Identification and mapping of homo sapiens sequences

We searched the available databases for human genomic
sequences which could represent members of the DUB/
USP17 family. Then, concentrating on the current human
genome assembly (GRCh37 primary reference assembly)
we have identified and mapped all potential family members. Thirty-two separate loci were found to represent
potential members of this family on both chromosomes 4
and 8 (Figure 1A and 1B). On chromosome 4p16.1 (GenBank: NC_0000004)(Figure 1A) we found two separate
blocks of RS447 tandem repeats consisting of 13 and 10
copies respectively. Closer examination revealed that
these blocks were in fact separated by an assembly gap
suggesting these sequences represent a portion of a single
block of tandem repeats which has not been fully
resolved due to its repetitive nature. On chromosome
8p23.1 (GenBank: NC_0000008)(Figure 1B) we identified
3 blocks of 3 RS447 repeat units. Upon further analysis of
the sequences on chromosome 4 we found that 20 of the
23 sequences contained an intact ORF of 1593 bp equivalent to those previously identified (USP17, DUB-3) [6,10]
and that the previously identified USP17 was one of the
sequences present. On chromosome 8 we found that 6 of
the 9 sequences had intact ORFs and that DUB-3 was one
of the sequences present.
We then carried out a clustal alignment of the proteins
encoded by the intact ORFs to determine if they were
potentially functional deubiquitinating enzymes (Additional file 1). Three of the ORFs from chromosome 8
lacked either the cysteine or the histidine residue
required for catalytic activity [15] and as a result will be
non-functional (USP17L4, USP17L7, USP17L8).
We then took all of the sequences from both chromosomes 4 and 8 and created a phylogenetic tree to examine

the relationship between these sequences (Figure 1C) as
well as examining the chromosome 4 (Additional File 2)
and chromosome 8 (Additional file 3) sequences separately. The sequences within the two blocks of tandem
repeats upon chromosome 4 were found to be closely
related suggesting these have all arisen from one ancestral
sequence which was present at this location and has subsequently been tandemly duplicated. However, the
arrangement of sequences on chromosome 8 is more
complex. Although not completely definitive, the relationships between these sequences would suggest that
the 3 blocks of 3 repeat units on chromosome 8 have
resulted from the duplication of one of these blocks
rather than the tandem duplication of individual
sequences. This hypothesis was further supported when
the sequences surrounding these blocks were examined
(Figure 2; for Genbank accession numbers see Additional
file 4). Previously it has been shown that a number of the
beta-defensin genes on chromosome 8p23.1 exist as part

of a cluster [16,17]. This cluster, which is made up of
DEFB107, DEFB105, DEFB106, DEFB104, SPAG11,
DEFB103, DEFB4, DEFB108 and DEFB109 is surrounded
by FAM90A/olfactory receptor genes and has been
shown to have a variable copy number ranging from 1 to
12, but more commonly between 2 and 7 [16,17]. It would
appear that two of the blocks of DUB/USP17 repeats
(LOC401447, USP17L4, LOC402329 and LOC392187,
USP17L8, USP17L3) are present within the 2 betadefensin clusters which have previously been identified
on the human genome reference assembly [16] (Figure 2A
and 2B). The third block (LOC392196, USP17L7, DUB-3)
is not within the recognised beta-defensin cluster which
shows copy number variation, but is associated with a
cluster of other beta-defensin, FAM90A and olfactory
receptor genes (Figure 2C). This would suggest that
although these blocks would appear to have been derived
from a common ancestral block, the third block is not
embedded within the copy number variable beta-

defensin cluster. It is also interesting to note that there are
2 beta-defensin genes in close proximity to the tandemly
repeated sequences on chromosome 4 as well as a number of olfactory receptor sequences (data not shown).

3B). The sequences were found to separate into two main
branches. The first, consisting of DUB-1, DUB-1A, DUB6
and LOC667882, were found reasonably close together
upon chromosome 7. However, the second consisting of
DUB-2, DUB-2A and LOC269980 lie on both sides of the
former group of sequences. The differences between
these two groups are further illustrated by the clustal
alignment of the proteins produced by these intact ORFs
(Additional file 5). Towards the carboxy termini of all of
these proteins there is a 19 amino acid sequence which is
apparently duplicated. However, the members of the second branch (DUB-2, DUB-2A) would appear to have
undergone a further replication and now have three copies of the aforementioned sequence (Additional file 5).
The surrounding sequence did not contain any betadefensin-like sequences, but we did observe multiple
olfactory receptors sequences surrounding these genes
and clearly they are embedded in an area rich in olfactory
receptor genes (data not shown).

Identification and mapping of mus musculus sequences

As before, we searched the available databases for murine
sequences which could represent members of the DUB/
USP17 family and concentrated on the murine genome
reference assembly (C57BL/6J). Seven separate loci representing potential members of this family on chromosome 7 (GenBank: NC_000073) were identified (Figure
3A). These sequences were found spread along this chromosome and whilst DUB-1 and DUB-1A represent head
to tail repeat units, it would appear that the other
sequences present are randomly spread throughout this
region (Figure 3A). Upon closer examination we found
that 6 of the 7 sequences contained an intact ORF equivalent to those previously identified in mice [3-5,18], with
all of these previously identified sequences being represented (DUB-1, DUB-1A, DUB-2, DUB-2A).
We then carried out a clustal alignment of the proteins
encoded by the intact ORFs and found that all of the key
catalytic residues (Additional file 5) necessary for activity
[15] were present and therefore they are all potentially
functional.
Next, we created a phylogenetic tree to examine the
relationship between the sequences identified (Figure

Identification and mapping of rattus norvegicus sequences

The rattus norvegicus genome reference assembly (based
on RGSC v3.4) was searched to identify and map any
potential DUB/USP17 family members. Three separate
loci were found to represent sequences that are potential
members of this family on chromosome 1 (GenBank:
NC_005100) (Figure 3A). Two of these sequences
(LOC689730, LOC689742) represent head to tail repeat

units, with the third being located some distance away
(Figure 4A). Upon closer examination we found that all 3
of the sequences contained an intact ORF.
A clustal alignment of the proteins encoded by these
ORFs demonstrated that whilst LOC689730 and
RGD1562061 are potentially functional deubiquitinating
enzymes, LOC689742 lacks the cysteine residue necessary for catalytic activity in these enzymes (Additional file
6).
We then created a phylogenetic tree to examine the
relationship between these rat sequences and the previously examined murine sequences (Figure 4B). The
sequences were found to separate into two distinct
groups with sequences from within each species being
more homologous. This was further illustrated by the
clustal alignment (Additional file 6), which showed that
the sequence towards the carboxy termini of these proteins which we have previously found to be at least duplicated in the murine sequences, has only one copy present
in all the rat sequences.
Again, like the murine sequences, we found multiple
olfactory receptor genes around the rat sequences suggesting they were again embedded in an area rich in
olfactory receptors (data not shown).

Identification of other DUB/USP17 family members

Having identified and mapped the sequences from the
human, mouse and rat genomes, we next went on to
examine other species to determine if any contained
DUB/USP17 genes and we identified a number of species
where sequences were present. In particular, we found 5
loci on Canis lupus familiarus (dog) chromosome 16
(NC_006598) that are split into 2 groups (LOC609287,
LOC609310 and LOC611374, LOC611292, LOC611251),
although not head to tail repeats, and separated by
approximately 5 Mb. All of these have intact ORFs and
when aligned with other family members (Additional file
7) they all appear to be potentially active as they contain
all the essential catalytic residues. Further examination
did not reveal any beta-defensin or olfactory receptor
genes within this region, but, we did find a number of unannotated DUB/USP17 sequences on dog chromosome
21 (GenBank: NC_006603) in an area which is rich in
olfactory receptor genes (data not shown).
Three loci were also found on Bos taurus (cow) chromosome 4 (GenBank: NC_007302, reference assembly
based upon Btau_4.0), 2 of which are head to tail repeats
(LOC786921, LOC786982) and 2 of which possess intact
ORFs (LOC790134, LOC786921). One was also found on
chromosome 3 (GenBank: NC_007301) (LOC789329).

Again, when aligned with other family members all the
necessary catalytic residues were present (Additional file
7). However, no beta-defensin or olfactory receptor
sequences were found in the vicinity.
We also identified a sequence from Equus caballus
(horse) chromosome 27 (Reference sequence based upon
EquCab2)(GenBank: NC_009170) as a potential DUB/
USP17 family member with a complete ORF
(LOC100063044) with all residues necessary for catalytic
activity intact. Interestingly this gene was found in close
proximity to a number of FAM90A and defensin genes
(data not shown).
A phylogenetic tree to examine the relationship
between the sequences from cow and dog as well as those
of humans, mice and rats was then created (Figure 5). As
before, these sequences showed more similarity to those
of their own species than to those of other species suggesting that they have all evolved from a common ancestor and have been replicated post-speciation.
Finally, we examined sequences from other primates
and found 10 sequences in Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee)

and
12
(GenBank:

LOC749572) that are potential DUB/USP17 genes. However, only 4 of these contained intact ORFs (LOC750726,
LOC735845, LOC748110, LOC748210), and when these

Page 7 of 11

were aligned with other family members only 2 contained
all the key residues necessary for catalytic activity
(LOC748110, LOC748210) (Additional file 8). We also
identified 1 sequence from macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey)
chromosome
8
(GenBank:
NC_007865)
(LOC695235) which had an intact ORF and when we
examined pongei abelii (Sumatran orang-utan) we found
several genomic clones from chromosome 8 which contain an unresolved tandem repeat equivalent to RS447.
Indeed, we found one BAC clone (GenBank: AC210623)
which has more than 20 tandemly repeated copies, many
of which contain intact ORFs. When the predicted proteins from both of these were aligned with other family
members they are intact and potentially active. We created a phylogenetic tree examining the relationship
between the sequences from Pan troglodytes and humans
(Figure 6). Unlike our previous comparisons, it was evident that the human and Pan troglodytes sequences do
not segregate and it would appear that there may well
have been several common ancestral sequences prior to
these two species separating. It is also interesting that the
sequences from the different Pan troglodytes chromosomes are spread between the different blocks of similarity, suggesting they may have resulted from the
duplication of a block of sequences from one chromosome onto another, rather than the tandem duplication of
a sequence once it has been transferred to that chromosome. This is similar to what is observed on human chromosome 8. It is also interesting to note that we observed

Discussion
Previously we reported that the DUB/USP17 family of
deubiquitinating enzymes had multiple tandemly
repeated family members on chromosomes 4 and 8 in
humans as well as on chromosome 7 in mice and that
multiple family members were also present in rats [14].
This suggested that members of this family were present
within a tandemly repeated sequence, which was conserved among these species and all the family members
had resulted from one common ancestral sequence which
had duplicated in each species after their separation [14].
In this current study, using the most current human
genome assembly, we now show that our original
assumptions insufficiently explained DUB/USP17 evolution. In particular, we now show that in the most current
human genome reference assembly there is a block of
tandemly repeated sequences on chromosome 4 containing a minimum of 23 DUB/USP17 sequences. Furthermore, the 9 DUB/USP17 sequences present on
chromosome 8 are found in blocks of 3 repeats embedded within, in at least 2 cases, the copy number variable
beta-defensin cluster. In addition, it is evident that whilst
some of the family members in mice and rats may lie head
to tail, there are not the same tandem repeat blocks seen
on human chromosome 4. In addition, we have now identified multiple additional sequences within chimpanzee

(3 on chromosome 4, 2 on chromosome 8, 3 on chromosome 11, 2 on chromosome 12), rhesus monkey (1 on
chromosome 8), orang-utan (unresolved repeat on chromosome 8), horse (1 on chromosome 27), cow (3 on chromosome 4 and 1 on chromosome 3) and dog (5 on
chromosome 16 and unannotated sequences on chromosome 21) which also appear to represent members of this
family of genes (Results summarised in Additional file 9).
Again the relationship between the sequences observed
in humans, mice, rats, cows and dogs would suggest the
presence of one ancestral sequence which has been duplicated in all of these species independently. However, it
would also appear from comparison of human and chimpanzee sequences that some duplication has taken place
prior to their divergence.
The arrangement of the human family members would
suggest that the variation in RS447 copy number, and as a
result the number of DUB/USP17 genes, may come about
via two mechanisms. Firstly, the presence of tandemly
repeated sequences on human chromosome 4 would suggest that this sequence is susceptible to tandem duplication, something which is further illustrated by the tandem
repeats observed in murine and rat sequences as well as
the large unresolved tandem repeat on orang-utan chromosome 8. Secondly, the localisation of a block of three
RS447 repeat units within both copies of the beta-defensin
cluster, previously shown to be present in the current
human genome assembly [16], and to show copy number
variation from 2 copies to 12 [19], may well account for
part of the variation in RS447 copy number previously

Burrows et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:250
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/250

observed. It is therefore likely that both of these blocks
contribute to the differences in RS447 copy number. However, the presence of an assembly gap between the two
blocks of repeats observed on chromosome 4 indicating
this repeat is not fully resolved, as well as assembly gaps
between the beta-defensin clusters on chromosome 8
would suggest the genome assemblies to date are rather
tentative and preclude us from determining how much
each block contributes to the variation in copy number.
The tentative nature of our observations also makes it
difficult to determine which of these blocks may contain
the ancestral sequence. It is interesting that all the
sequences in the tandemly repeated blocks on chromosome 4 show little divergence and the majority retain an
intact ORF. This may well suggest this is a relatively recent
evolutionary event, which has resulted from the transfer of
DUB/USP17 sequences from chromosome 8. This conclusion is supported by the observation of a small number of
beta-defensin and olfactory receptor sequences in close
proximity to these tandem blocks as well as the observation that within all of the beta-defensin clusters, 2 of the 3
DUB/USP17 genes lack either an intact ORF or residues
necessary for catalytic activity. Although, it must be noted
that the sequences which appear to lack the necessary
active residues could also function as ubiquitin binding
proteins or competitors for the active family members. In
addition, the observation of DUB/USP17 genes in association with beta-defensin, FAM90A and olfactory receptor
genes in multiple species including humans, chimpanzee,
rhesus monkey, mice, rats, horses and dogs would also support this hypothesis. This would also suggest that the
ancestral DUB/USP17 sequence may well have existed in
close proximity to beta-defensin and olfactory receptor
genes and that this family has evolved along with these
sequences in the species outlined. However, no betadefensin genes are found within the vicinity of the murine
and rat DUB/USP17 family members and syntenic regions
to the beta-defensin clusters on human chromosome
8p23.1 exist on murine chromosomes 8qA1.3-A2 and
14qC3 as well as rat chromosomes 16q12.5 and 15p12,
regions which are distinct to their DUB/USP17 genes on
murine chromosome 7 and rat chromosome 1 [20]. This
could be explained by the observation that, in the different
mammalian species a number of beta-defensin blocks have
been identified, two of which are specific to rodents, and
several of which show no overlap between humans and
rodents [20]. Therefore, the absence of the beta-defensin
genes from the DUB/USP17 region in rodents may be due
to the evolutionary pressures which have prompted them
to evolve a distinct beta-defensin repertoire from other
mammals.
Alternatively, the DUB/USP17 sequences may be
mobile genetic elements which are more readily inserted
into areas of the genome which are unstable and there-

Page 9 of 11

fore their frequent co-localisation with the olfactory
receptor and beta-defensin genes is due to the nature of
the areas into which they insert and not to any co-evolution. This is supported by the observation that the closest
relatives of the DUB/USP17 family, USP36 and USP42,
have much more complex genomic structures suggesting
that the DUB/USP17 family may not have resulted from
gene duplication, but from the insertion of a mRNA
sequence into an unstable genomic region.
The defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides
which are produced by mucosal epithelial cells lining the
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts and
as such are thought to play an important role in immune
defence [20]. The defensin genes on chromosome 8p23.1
consist of a block of alpha-defensin genes and a copy
number variable block of beta-defensin genes. Only one
of the alpha-defensins varies in copy number (DEFA1A3)
due to its propensity for tandem duplication [21,22].
However, the entire beta-defensin cluster shows copy
number variation [16,17,19] and the presence of multiple
and diverging copies of these genes may be important to
boost host defence.
The olfactory receptors are often found as tandemly
repeated sequences and there are approximately 400
apparently functional genes in humans, as well as an
equivalent number of pseudogenes [23,24]. These genes
are also proportionally over-represented at regions that
show copy number variation as well as regions that show
segmental duplications [25]. There should be positive
selection to maintain a highly variable repertoire of olfactory receptors to allow the recognition of a wide array of
odorant molecules, although it is apparent that primates
have a smaller number of functional receptors in comparison to other mammals, possibly due to their acquisition
of tri-chromatic vision [26,27].
If the DUB/USP17 genes have co-evolved with these
genes it could suggest they are under similar evolutionary
pressures to the beta-defensin and olfactory receptor
genes. However, on the basis that they have not diverged
significantly, that their repertoire has not spread beyond
chromosomes 4 and 8; and that on chromosome 8 all but
one DUB/USP17 gene copy in each repeat block has been
inactivated would collectively suggest this is not the case.
Indeed, it has been observed that in regions of copy number variation, which are inherently unstable, the selection
pressures to get rid of unnecessary additional copies of
the olfactory receptors and other genes are reduced, and
this may well account for their over representation [25]. It
is also interesting to note that each of the beta-defensin
clusters maintains a DUB/USP17 gene with an intact
ORF, suggesting there may be positive selection to maintain an active member in each repeat of this copy number
variable repeat, especially, if as hypothesised, this is the
ancestral sequence.

Burrows et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:250
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/250

Moreover, unlike the beta-defensins and olfactory
receptors, the known function of the DUB/USP17 family
genes would suggest there should be no selective pressure
for the acquisition of additional family members and as
yet we have no experimental evidence that any of the
intact ORFs, other than DUB-3 and USP17 are active. In
fact, several lines of evidence suggest that the DUB/
USP17 family regulate cell growth and survival, processes
which are controlled by delicately balanced systems
which can be easily disrupted and would not benefit from
additional gene expression. In particular, DUB-1 expression results in cell cycle arrest prior to S-phase [7], DUB2 expression markedly inhibits apoptosis induced by
cytokine withdrawal [8] and we have previously reported
that constitutive expression of DUB-3 blocks cell proliferation [6,9,28] through its regulation of the ubiquitination
and activity of the 'CAAX' box protease RCE1 [9,29]. In
addition, it has also been observed that overexpression of
USP17 family members can lead to apoptosis [30] and
most recently it has been reported that DUB-3 regulates
the ubiquitination and stability of CDC25A and thereby
the progression of the cell cycle [31]. Indeed, previous
studies of RS447 would suggest mechanisms are present
to regulate the transcript levels of DUB/USP17 genes. In
particular, previous studies have indicated that cosmid
vectors containing significantly different copy numbers of
the RS447 repeat may produce similar levels of DUB/
USP17 protein due to the production of anti-sense transcripts [10]. In addition, it has been reported that some
copies of the RS447 sequence can be methylated [12].
Therefore, it is probable that the expression of the DUB/
USP17 genes is tightly controlled and their existence
within a highly polymorphic sequence is not so much a
reflection of the selective evolutionary pressures on these
genes, but a consequence of the unstable and copy number variable region of the genome in which they have
evolved.
However, having now established that each copy of the
copy number variable beta-defensin cluster contains a
block of DUB/USP17 sequences using the current human
genome build, it would also be interesting to examine the
association of their copy number with immune related
diseases. Previously, it has been demonstrated that higher
copy numbers of this cluster are associated with protection against Crohn's disease [32], something which was
hypothesised to result from the increased barrier to
infection resulting from over production of the betadefensins. In addition, higher copy numbers have also
been associated with an increased risk of psoriasis [33].
The DUB/USP17 family members are cytokine induced
genes [3-6] which will be expressed in many immune cell
types and could modulate the immune response. Therefore, their presence within this cluster could be related to
its association with these immune related diseases. As a

Page 10 of 11

result, it may be informative to examine the overall copy
number of these genes and see if there is any association
with these diseases.

Conclusions
Our observations suggest that the DUB/USP17 family of
enzymes have evolved from an ancestral sequence which
was part of an unstable part of the genome and as a result,
it has undergone multiple and varied duplications independently in all of the species examined. However, there
is strong conservation of this family throughout these
species, probably due to their important role in regulation of cell fate [6-9,28,30]. It will be intriguing to determine the importance of these highly polymorphic genes
in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer where copy
number variation of the region in which they are embedded has already been shown to be important [28,29].
