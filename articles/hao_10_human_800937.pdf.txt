Human functional genetic studies are biased
against the medically most relevant primatespecific genes

Abstract
Background: Many functional, structural and evolutionary features of human genes have been observed to
correlate with expression breadth and/or gene age. Here, we systematically explore these correlations.
Results: Gene age and expression breadth are strongly correlated, but contribute independently to the variation of
functional, structural and evolutionary features, even when we take account of variation in mRNA expression level.
Human genes without orthologs in distant species (’young’ genes) tend to be tissue-specific in their expression. As
computational inference of gene function often relies on the existence of homologs in other species, and
experimental characterization is facilitated by broad and high expression, young, tissue-specific human genes are
often the least characterized. At the same time, young genes are most likely to be medically relevant.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that functional characterization of human genes is biased against young, tissuespecific genes that are mostly medically relevant. The biases should not be taken lightly because they may pose
serious obstacles to our understanding of the molecular basis of human diseases. Future studies should thus be
designed to specifically explore the properties of primate-specific genes.

Background
Proteins and their encoding genes can be characterized
by functional attributes, such as which pathways they
act in or what molecular functions they have; structural
attributes, such as lengths of their coding regions or
UTRs and GC contents; and evolutionary attributes,
such as substitution rates between species and estimates
of selection pressures. With the increasing availability of
functional genomic data and systems biology tools, correlations between some of these attributes have been
observed. The two factors with the strongest associations with other data types in humans are expression
breadth (the number of tissues one protein is expressed
in) and phyletic age (defined by the evolutionarily most
distant species where homologs can be found) [1,2]. For
example, recent studies have shown that expression

breadth correlated with promoter architecture, evolutionary rates (Ka and Ks) and gene length [2,3], while
human proteins of different phyletic age are enriched in
distinct functional categories [1]. Interestingly, many
properties that correlate with expression breadth also
correlate with phyletic age and vice versa; indeed, some
studies have reported correlations between phyletic age
and expression breadth [2,4].
In evolutionary history, proteins involved in basic biological processes such as transcription and translation
machineries, metabolism and cell cycle control were probably invented first. Accordingly, the corresponding genes
are old, and conserved in multiple organisms, and are
expressed in multiple tissues. Conversely, younger genes
perform more specialized functions, and are thus typically
used and expressed in specific tissues and/or environments. This line of reasoning predicts a significant correlation between phyletic age and expression breadth.
Consequently, variables correlate with one of the two
factors should also correlate with the other. For example,
many old genes are expected to be broadly useful (and
hence broadly expressed), to come from basic functional

groups (such as transcription/translation or metabolism),
and to require distinct promoter architectures and optimized gene structures; they may also evolve mostly under
strong purifying selection.
This picture of increasing specialization with decreasing gene age is an oversimplification. For example, gene
duplication may often be followed by subfunctionalization [5], where each of the two gene copies takes over
the function of the ancestral gene in part of the tissues
of the ancestral gene. A recent study suggested that
subfunctionalization was indeed partially underlying the
correlation between the rate of increase in gene tissue
specificity and the rate of increase in the maximum
number of cell types [6]. The duplication thus creates
two gene copies with the same phyletic age, but very
different expression profiles [7,8]; other changes of
gene attributes (e.g., sequence changes to optimize tissue-specific function) might follow. Furthermore, genes
expressed in different tissues may be under different
constraints, resulting in variable evolutionary rates
across proteins with similar expression breadth [9].
Another important factor known to influence gene
structure and evolution is expression abundance
[10-12]. Thus, while we expect a strong overlap between
the influence of phyletic age and expression breadth on
human protein features, we expect age and breadth to
differ in their influence on individual proteins; and we
expect that other factors, such as expression abundance,
also contribute to systematic variation in protein
attributes.
Functional studies of proteins and their encoding genes
are biased by gene properties. For example, highly and
broadly expressed gene products are easy to detect and
are thus studied preferentially. Older genes, which are
most likely conserved across multiple species (especially
model organisms used for disease models), are studied
more intensively due to the availability of animal (or even
yeast) models. Proteins with basic molecular functions
were studied preferentially because of their importance
in biology. Due to these biases, we expect that databases
like Gene Ontology [13] and KEGG pathways [14,15]
contain more reliable functional annotations for old and
broadly expressed genes. Conversely, younger genes,
which may be important, e.g., in human-specific gene
regulation, are not studied as much.
In this study, we focus on human protein-coding
genes to explore systematic correlations of phyletic age
and expression profiles with some intrinsic gene features, as well as the interdependence of age and expression breadth. Based on our observations, we discuss
systematic biases in functional studies that affect the
process of knowledge acquisition for human diseaserelated genes.

Results
If it increases with expression breadth, it probably
increases with age

Using previously published phyletic age classifications
[1] and expression breadth data [2,3], we first verified
the substantial correlation between evolutionary age and
expression breadth in human genes (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.27, P < 10-15). Consistent with our
hypothesis of a later origin of proteins with more specific functions, we find that older genes are on average
more broadly expressed, while young genes tend to be
tissue-specific (Figure 1a), tissue-specificity is most pronounced for genes restricted to primates or mammals.
Genes of different expression breadth exhibit different
promoter architectures [2,16]. Characterizing promoter
architecture through the presence of CpG-islands and
TATA-boxes, we confirmed that CpG+/TATA- promoter presence is positively correlated with expression
breadth (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.394, P <
10-15), while CpG-/TATA+ and CpG-/TATA- promoters show a corresponding negative correlation (Additional file 1, Figure S1a). As expected, we found that
phyletic age also correlates significantly with promoter
architecture (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.217,
P < 10-15 for CpG+/TATA-, Table 1). As shown in Figure 1b, younger genes are increasingly in favor of promoters lacking CpG islands; these promoters are
significantly enriched especially in primate-specific
genes (odds ratio: 8.038, P < 10-15, Fisher’s exact test).
Overall, we examined five structural gene properties:
length of proteins and 5’-UTRs, number of exons,
length of the first exon, and GC content of gene’s coding regions. Each structural property correlates significantly with both phyletic age and expression breadth
(P ≤ 0.0005 in each case, see Table 1, Additional file 1,
Figure S1b-g and Figure S2a-f for details). The strongest
correlations are those with protein length, gene length
and exon numbers, while 5’-UTR length and GC content show weaker correlations. Of particular interest are
the weak but statistically highly significant correlations
of the length of first introns with phyletic age and
expression breadth (R = 0.10 and 0.06, respectively).
First introns are known to often harbor regulatory elements [17]. Thus, the results in Table 1 suggest that tissue-specific gene expression is at least in part achieved
through additional regulation in 5’-UTRs and first
introns. This notion is consistent with the correlation
between 5’-UTR length and first intron length (R =
0.095, P < 10-15).
We also examined gene-specific evolutionary rates,
estimated from the fraction of synonymous (Ks) and
non-synonymous (Ka) sites with nucleotide substitutions
between human and mouse orthologs. Ka, Ks, and their

ratio Ka/Ks all correlated negatively with both phyletic
age and expression breadth, which is consistent with
previous findings [1,16] (see Table 1 and Additional file
1, Figure S1h and S2g for details).
Are more ancient human genes really involved in
more basal cellular functions? While the relationship
between functional categories and phyletic age has been

investigated previously [1,4], the trend among human
proteins was relatively weak [1]. Here, we used annotation data from two sources, GeneOntology (GO) [13]
and pathway annotations from KEGG [14,15]. Of the
22,165 human non-redundant protein-coding genes in
this study, 7,452 had GO annotations supported by at
least one of the experimental evidence codes (IDA, IPI,

IMP, IGI, and IEP). Using a modified method from Freilich et al. [4], we grouped genes into four main categories according to their GO annotation: enzymatic
activity, transporter, regulation (including transcription
regulator activity, translation regulator activity, and
enzyme regulator activity), and signal transduction.
These functional annotations indeed correlated with
expression breadth (Figure 1c): the fraction of enzymes
increases with increasing expression breadth, while the
fraction of genes involved in signal transduction
decreases. In contrast, the fractions of transporters and
genes involved in regulation remained roughly constant
across different expression breadths.
While we also found global patterns in the distribution
of the functional groups across different age groups,
these were not a simple mirror image of the results for
expression breadth. Similar to the trend with increasing
expression breadth, we found that the combined fraction
of enzymes and transporters decreases with phyletic age,
while the combined relative number of genes involved in
regulation and signal transduction increases (Figure 1d).
For expression breadth these trends are almost entirely
due to variation in enzyme and regulator fractions. For
phyletic age, there is also a decrease in the fraction of
transporters in primate-specific genes. Even more strikingly, regulatory genes show a U-shaped distribution,
compensated by massively increased fractions of signaling genes in metazoa-, chordata-, and mammalian-specific genes (Figure 1d).
We found a comparable number of our genes (8,569) to
be annotated in at least one of four pathway categories in

KEGG: metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes.
As shown in Figure 1e and 1f, global trends are very similar to the GO results. However, metabolism appears
almost absent among mammalian-specific genes, while
environmental information processing is the dominant
category also in primate-specific genes. After examining a
wide range of structural, evolutionary, and functional
properties of human genes, we thus conclude that any
trends with increasing expression breadth seem to be
always mirrored by according trends with increasing phyletic age, and vice versa.
Age and expression breadth affect gene properties
independently

Are the effects of age and expression pattern independent? Or is one of the two factors responsible for most of
the correlations, and the effect of the other factor just
due to the mutual relationship between age and expression? And do other factors contribute significantly to the
variation of human protein properties? Using a generalized linear model, we find that both age and expression
breadth contribute independently to all characteristics of
human proteins tested here (Table 2). We also find that
mRNA expression abundance contributes significantly to
some but not all properties. Interestingly, expression
level is correlated with expression breadth [18], but not
with phyletic age; under our hypothesis, the observed
result suggests that ancient cellular functions do not generally require large protein numbers, but that expression
levels are rather driven by tissue-specific effects [9].

We used a form like ‘property ~ phyletic age + expression breadth + expression abundance’in the generalized linear model analysis. This form will produce
three p-values showing the influence of phyletic age, expression breadth and expression abundance on ‘property’respectively; p-values less than certain
threshold (0.05 for example) suggest significant contribution of some factors to the ‘property’; multiple significant p-values suggest the corresponding factors
contribute independently to the ‘property’.

Human functional studies are biased against
disease-related genes

The most striking trend with decreasing age is that
more and more human genes are not annotated in GO
or KEGG (Figure 2a and 2b). Most strikingly, the majority of genes in the primate group are functionally
uncharacterized. There is a corresponding trend for

genes with lower expression breadth to be less annotated in GO (Additional file 1, Figure S1i). Thus, broadly
expressed and, in particular, older genes are relatively
well studied, while many young, tissue-specific genes are
poorly characterized. Interestingly, there is no corresponding increase in the fraction of genes annotated in
KEGG with increasing expression breadth (P = 0.28).

Figure 2 Young genes are rarely functionally characterized; but the youngest group is the most disease-related. (a) genes annotated by
gene ontology with experimental evidence codes (GO-EXP); (b) genes annotated by KEGG; (c) disease-causing genes annotated by OMIM (Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man).

Hao et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:316
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/316

Thus, annotations in KEGG, which are mostly based on
biochemical experiments, appear less biased towards
broadly expressed proteins compared with the more heterogeneous GO database.
These biases are not surprising: regularly, the first step
in functional annotation is comparison to characterized
genes with similar amino acid sequence. The probability
of a good match obviously increases with the phylogenetic distribution of homologs; in particular, this
approach will seldom be successful for genes that are
restricted to primates. Experimental characterization is
usually done in model organisms, with a substantial part
of our knowledge derived from species as distantly
related to humans as insects, nematode worms, or even
yeast. Finally, tissue-specific (and often lowly expressed)
genes are harder to observe experimentally, adding a
bias towards broadly expressed proteins to the phylogenetic bias.
Should we care about this bias? An analysis of diseaserelated genes in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man database (OMIM) [19] shows that such medically
relevant genes are strongly enriched among primate-specific genes: about 20% of all genes restricted to humans
and other primates are currently associated with diseases (Figure 2c), more than in any other age class; this
percentage is very likely an underestimate. That this
medically most relevant group of genes is the one least
characterized appears problematic.

Discussion
Grouping human protein-coding genes by both phyletic
age and by expression profiles, we observed significant
correlations of these two factors with a number of gene
properties, including gene structure, GC content, promoter architecture, evolutionary rate, and functional
classification. While several of these correlations had
been observed previously [1,2,4], we show that in each
case both factors, age and expression pattern, independently contribute to the observed variation. The trends
are gradual, with substantial overlap between neighboring groups.
Another important gene property correlated with phyletic age as well as expression breadth is the probability
of being annotated in public databases (Figure 2a, b and
Additional file 1, Figure S1i): the youngest, primate-specific genes are the least characterized functionally, partly
because of a lack of orthologs in model species, partly
because of the typical gene properties analyzed above.
Thus, there is a substantial bias against the functional
characterization of certain genes: functional studies preferentially target genes that are conserved in other species, with broad expression breadth and basic functions,
while younger genes with temporally and spatially
restricted expression are less understood. These biases

Page 6 of 8

are not unexpected, as lowly expressed genes are difficult to capture even using high-throughput technologies,
and as functional studies are facilitated by the availability of orthologs in model species.
Unfortunately, it is the primate-specific genes that
contain the highest fraction of disease-related genes
(19.4%, Figure 2c). The systematic biases against their
study should thus not be taken lightly: the incomplete
functional characterization of the youngest genes may
pose serious obstacles to our understanding of the molecular basis of human diseases. Cell line culturing, tissue
engineering and the emerging induced pluripotent stem
cells technique [20] may help to provide solutions to
this bias.
Our results differ markedly from those of DomazetLoso and Tautz [21,22], which found that the percentage of human disease-related sequences remained
approximately constant up to the divergence of the
mammalian lineages, and then decreased steeply with
decreasing age. One major methodological difference
between our study and [21,22] is that these authors
identified phylogenetic sequence age based on a very
lenient Blast E-value cutoff (0.001). This approach places
all gene families that share a particular protein domain
into the age class where this domain emerged first, even
though a particular gene may have evolved later, e.g., via
gene duplication [21,22]. The youngest sequences in
[21,22] are thus genes without any recognizable homology to genes in other phyla; it is conceivable that some
of these may in fact be mis-annotations. In contrast, the
method employed here [1] is designed to confidently
assign phylogenetic ages to genes rather than domains.
The youngest genes in our study often share protein
domains with older sequences, but arose recently by
gene duplication or exon shuffling. Thus, while the
results of [21,22] apply to the age distribution of disease-associated protein domains, our results give the age
distribution of complete disease-associated genes.

Methods
Human protein coding genes and gene properties

22,165 non-redundant human protein-coding genes
were downloaded from the HomoloGene database
release 64 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene.
Properties of the human genes, including number of
exons, intron length, and 3’ and 5’ UTR length, were
calculated based on BLAT mapping results of nucleotide
gene sequences to the human genome available at the
UCSC Genome Browser [23]. Evolutionary rate of
human and mouse orthologs, promoter type, as well as
expression breadth of human genes were obtained from
[2,3]. Four types of promoter architectures were identified according to the presence and absence of CpGisland and TATA-box in the core promoter [2]. mRNA

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Human GO annotations were obtained from the Gene
Ontology [13] website http://www.geneontology.org;
Only GO annotations with any of the experimental evidence codes IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI or IEP (GO-EXP) were
used in this study. Based on GO, human protein-coding
genes were divided into four groups: enzyme, transporter, regulation and signal transduction, using a method
similar to [4].
Pathway annotations of human genes were obtained
from KEGG [14,15]. According to these annotations,
human genes were classified into one of five categories:
metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and
human disease. We did not consider the category
“human disease”, as only a few genes were classified into
this category by KEGG.

Diseases related genes

The ‘genemap’ file containing a list of the best-curated
disease genes was downloaded from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database [19] on April
27, 2010. Out of 12,489 entries, we selected 2,428
entries with the “(3)” tag, for which there is strong evidence that at least one mutation in the particular gene
is causative for the disease. In total, 2,349 genes in the
gene set analysed in this study were marked as diseaserelated genes.
