Probable presence of an ubiquitous cryptic
mitochondrial gene on the antisense strand of
the cytochrome oxidase I gene

Abstract
Background: Mitochondria mediate most of the energy production that occurs in the majority of eukaryotic
organisms. These subcellular organelles contain a genome that differs from the nuclear genome and is referred to
as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Despite a disparity in gene content, all mtDNAs encode at least two components
of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, including cytochrome c oxidase I (Cox1).
Presentation of the hypothesis: A positionally conserved ORF has been found on the complementary strand of the
cox1 genes of both eukaryotic mitochondria (protist, plant, fungal and animal) and alpha-proteobacteria. This putative
gene has been named gau for gene antisense ubiquitous in mtDNAs. The length of the deduced protein is
approximately 100 amino acids. In vertebrates, several stop codons have been found in the mt gau region, and
potentially functional gau regions have been found in nuclear genomes. However, a recent bioinformatics study
showed that several hypothetical overlapping mt genes could be predicted, including gau; this involves the possible
import of the cytosolic AGR tRNA into the mitochondria and/or the expression of mt antisense tRNAs with anticodons
recognizing AGR codons according to an alternative genetic code that is induced by the presence of suppressor tRNAs.
Despite an evolutionary distance of at least 1.5 to 2.0 billion years, the deduced Gau proteins share some conserved
amino acid signatures and structure, which suggests a possible conserved function. Moreover, BLAST analysis identified
rare, sense-oriented ESTs with poly(A) tails that include the entire gau region. Immunohistochemical analyses using an
anti-Gau monoclonal antibody revealed strict co-localization of Gau proteins and a mitochondrial marker.
Testing the hypothesis: This hypothesis could be tested by purifying the gau gene product and determining its
sequence. Cell biological experiments are needed to determine the physiological role of this protein.
Implications of the hypothesis: Studies of the gau ORF will shed light on the origin of novel genes and their
functions in organelles and could also have medical implications for human diseases that are caused by
mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, this strengthens evidence for mitochondrial genes coded according to an
overlapping genetic code.

occurs in mitochondria. These essential subcellular
organelles contain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which
is an extrachromosomal genetic element. The mitochondrial genes are arranged compactly and generally have
no introns and few intergenic nucleotides. In some
mtDNAs (e.g., nematodes and annelids), all genes are
transcribed in the same direction, whereas, in others,
both strands encode genes. With few exceptions,
metazoan mtDNAs are covalently closed-circular molecules that autonomously replicate and transcribe within

the organellar matrix. The mitochondrial gene content
is highly variable across eukaryotes. The number of
mitochondrial protein genes is believed to vary from 3
to 67, while the tRNA gene content varies from 0 to 27
[2]. Typical triploblastic animal mtDNAs contain genes
that encode the large and small subunit ribosomal
RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and 13 proteins that
are all components of the oxidative phosphorylation
process: ATPase subunits 6 and 8 (ATP6 and 8), cytochrome b (Cyt b), cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1-3
(Cox1-3) and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1-6 and
4L (ND1-6 and 4L). In some species that are missing
mitochondrial genes, such as atp6 and atp8 [3], these
genes are either encoded in the nucleus (as it has been
shown for the atp6 gene of a non-metazoan (Chlamydomonas reinhardti) [4]) or have been lost, which implies
that their function has become dispensable or has been
assumed by other proteins.
In view to find putative mitochondrial genes in alternative reading frames on both coding and “presupposed”
non-coding strands, numerous complete mtDNA genomes have been analyzed. This search has led to the
observation of an unknown, positionally conserved open
reading frame (ORF) on the complementary strand of
eukaryotic cox1 genes.
An independent method was designed to detect previously unknown overlapping protein coding mt genes

mitochondrial gene sequences in view to find a number
of such genes in various alternative frames, including a
sequence corresponding to the above mentioned ORF
[5]. The study of this ORF constitutes the aim of this
article.

Presentation of the hypothesis
To identify the novel putative mtDNA genes, numerous
complete mtDNA genomes have been translated in all
six frames, and all of the putative ORFs in unconventional frames have been studied. Conceptual translations
using the corresponding translation table have been
made using the program “VirtualRibosome” [6]. The
presence of putative ORFs in the nucleotide sequence
was determined using “NCBI ORF finder” [7]. Among
these results is a relatively long alternative ORF on the
complementary strand of the cox1 genes or, more precisely, in the region corresponding to the second half of
the NH2-terminal domain (Figure 1). Genes can overlap
on the same strand or on the opposite strand. Moreover,
despite stop codons in sequences, a relatively well-conserved nucleotide region has been found in all of the
complete mtDNAs analyzed. Its position versus the cox1
gene justifies the name gau (gene antisense ubiquitous
in mitochondrial genomes). The deduced Gau protein
sequence is relatively well conserved in protist, fungal,
plant and animal mtDNAs and in members of the
alpha-proteobacteria taxa (rickettsiales, Rhizobacteria,

[10], RNA editing [11] and suppressor tRNAs [12],
which are well known in mtDNAs [13,14]. Therefore, it
is difficult to predict the exact size of the gau coding
region. We hypothesize that it could be exactly 100
codons long (see discussion).
Are there functional copies of gau in the nuclear
genomes of vertebrates?

As in other taxa, in vertebrate mtDNAs, the sequences
of the gau regions are highly conserved but they are
punctuated by numerous AGR (R for purines) stop
codons. To determine regions that are homologous to
the gau genes but free of stop codons, various complete
or almost complete nuclear vertebrate genome
sequences were screened. Alignments of both Gau
deduced proteins and cox1 regions revealed some interesting features (Table 1 and Additional file 1). For
instance, in both Pan troglodytes (Ch2a) and Pongo pygmaeus (Ch2a), the two flanking regions of the gau-like
genes have a very low level of similarity to the cox1
genes. This suggests that in cox1 pseudogenes, negative
selection has only acted to conserve the gau ORFs. This
hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that in the nuclear
gau regions, the number of stop codons is lower than in
the mitochondrial sequences that were translated using
the standard genetic code (Additional file 1). Surprisingly, in vertebrates, nuclear gau regions were found in
introns of various genes (Table 1).
These analyses could be compatible with a functional
nuclear ORF for Gau, whose product would be imported
into the mitochondria.
Mitochondrial expression and antisense tRNAs

The possible in situ expression of the vertebrate mitochondrial gau ORF and the synthesis of the corresponding protein product cannot be ruled out despite the
presence of stop codons within the gau region and other
putative overlapping mitochondrial genes. Importing
cytosolic tRNAs [15-21] with anticodons that recognize
AGR codons and bear the cognate amino acid arginine,
according to the standard genetic code used in vertebrate
nuclear chromosomes, could allow mitochondrial expression of these mitochondrial genes [5]. Additionally, it was
shown that both DNA strands are transcribed in their
entirety [22]. Hence, it is very likely that RNA that corresponds to the putative gau gene is produced in mitochondria. Accordingly, RNA corresponding to two other
putative mitochondrial antisense overlapping genes on
the complementary strand of mammalian ATP6 and
ATP8 has been previously detected and shown to be
associated with low resource availability ([23], as presented by figure 6 in reference [5]).
A further independent mechanism could enable mitochondrial expression of the mitochondrial gau region

despite the presence of stop codons. RNA corresponding
to the complementary (antisense) sequence of primate
sense tRNAs has a number of properties beyond that of
forming cloverleaf secondary structures, which suggests
activity in protein synthesis [24]. For example, the usage
frequencies of amino acid cognates in regular primate
mitochondrial ORFs coevolve with various antisense
tRNA properties that are required for proper activity in
translation [24]. These results were also confirmed by
the association between the pathogenic effects of human
polymorphisms in tRNA genes and the cloverleaf formation of the antisense tRNA sequences [25]. Pathogenic
mutations, when compared to neutral polymorphisms,
decrease cloverleaf formation in antisense tRNAs that
are predicted to be active in translation according to
other properties and analyses [24]. However, the opposite occurs (pathogenic mutants increase cloverleaf formation compared to regular polymorphisms) for
antisense tRNAs that are not expected to function in
translation (figure 3 in [25]). The finding that was most
relevant to the expression of antisense ORFs, which
include stop codons such as in gau, is that the anticodons of some antisense mitochondrial tRNAs correspond to mitochondrial stop codons, also called
antitermination (antisense) tRNAs [26]. Several patterns
suggest that regular sense protein synthesis is adapted
for proper function in the presence of these antitermination tRNAs. One of these patterns is the negative coevolution between the formation of the antisense
antitermination tRNA cloverleaf and the regular main
frame usage in mitochondrial genes with stop codons
corresponding to the tRNA anticodons. These results
themselves are evidence for translational activity by antisense tRNAs [26]. In addition, comparative analyses of
primate mitochondrial genomes show that predicted
antisense antitermination tRNA properties coevolve
positively with putative mitochondrial overlapping genes
(including gau) whose expression necessitates the suppressor/antitermination antisense tRNAs [5]. Coevolution between the predicted primate mitochondrial
antisense antitermination tRNAs and the putative mitochondrial off-frame overlapping genes requires stop
codon suppression for their expression, which suggests
that proteins corresponding to Gau and other mitochondrial genes may be synthesized in situ in the mitochondria. Notably, these mechanisms enable potential
mitochondrial expression of gau in association with
antisense antitermination tRNAs or by importing cytosolic tRNAs. However, these do not imply that the negative selection of stop codon usage within the gau region
does not occur, especially in species such as Homo
sapiens, in which no antisense antitermination tRNA is
predicted to exist [5,26]. Low stop codon numbers
would cause gau expression to be independent of the

induction of cytosolic tRNA import and/or antisense
tRNAs, which would enable the independent regulation
of expression of the various putative overlapping genes
according to the number of stop codons.
Previous analyses [5] showed that the number of overlapping genes is greater in primate species possessing
the predicted antisense antitermination tRNAs with
anticodons matching the AGR codons than in sister
taxa that are not predicted to possess such tRNAs. This
coevolution between the translational properties necessary to translate overlapping genes and the overlapping
genes themselves is significant evidence in favor of the
hypothesis that overlapping genes are physiologically
functional. A similar analysis is performed here testing
whether the number of AGR codons in the predicted
gau sequence of primates coevolves with the presence/
absence of predicted tRNAs with anticodons that match
the AGR codons. Figure 3 presents the phylogenetic
relationships between 63 primate taxa, for which the
complete mitochondrial genome is available in GenBank, the presence of predicted antisense antitermination AGR tRNAs in these species, and the number of
stop codons in gau. Taxa were grouped to create monophyletic clusters of species predicted to possess this
tRNA in view to compare to closely related monophyletic groups of species that were not predicted to possess a tRNA matching AGR codons. These pairs of
monophyletic clusters were used to calculate the phylogenetically independent contrasts, A-N, which are
shown in Figure 3. Groups are indicated by the letters
A-N near taxon names, and the times of divergence that
are shown are from various publications on primate
phylogeny [27-34].
Phylogenetic contrasts for a given monophyletic group
were calculated by subtracting the mean number of gau
AGR codons in species that do not possess a tRNA
matching the AGR codons from the mean in the phylogenetically matched taxa predicted to possess this tRNA.
For example, group G indicates the gain, in one of the
two available mt genomes of the velvet monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus, of an antisense antitermination tRNA
with an anticodon matching the AGR codons. The gau
region in the Chlorocebus pygerythrus genome has 11
AGR codons, while the other available sequence from
that species has only 9 AGR codons, and on average,

gau sequences from Chlorocebus species that do not
possess this tRNA have 10.5 AGR codons. Hence, the
contrast for group G is +0.5 AGR codons in gau. Physiological activity expects a positive association between
AGR codons and the presence of this tRNA. Thus, most
contrasts are expected to be positive, as in the case of
Chlorocebus. Indeed, 9 of the 13 contrasts (69%) that
were calculated are positive, which is a statistically significant majority of the cases according to the robust
non-parametric sign test (one tailed P = 0.0231). These
contrasts are not equal in terms of estimation quality.
Seven contrasts were calculated based on one single species in one of the groups being contrasted (as in contrast G). Three of the four negative contrasts belong to
contrasts with low estimation quality due to a small
sample size, which suggests that the actual strength of
the coevolution between the presence/absence of mt
tRNAs that recognize AGR codons and the number of
AGR codons in gau is probably stronger. Further
exploration of the data (not shown) suggests that the
interaction between long divergence times between
groups with and without this tRNA and a low sample
size creates uncertainty in the contrast estimation.
Indeed, phylogenetic reconstruction becomes more
uncertain the further the reconstructed state/time is
from the actual observed data, which in most cases are
the actual species observed rather than the assumed
ancestors (i.e., see the discussion in reference [35]).
The various contrasts are also not equivalent in a different sense; parsimonious phylogenetic interpretations
of the presence/absence of the tRNAs in Figure 3 suggest that some contrasts reflect a gain in tRNAs that
recognize AGR codons (contrasts B, E, F, G, K, M, N),
while an evolutionary scenario of loss fits the other contrasts (A, C, D, H, J, L). For gains, 6 of the 7 contrasts
are positive, which is statistically significant according to
a one-sided sign test (P = 0.03125). Half of the six contrasts assumed to be evolutionary losses are negative,
which does not indicate any pattern. Previous analyses
[5] also suggested that the time since a change in the
presence/absence in AGR tRNA occurred affected the
number of overlapping genes, which suggests that with
time, overlapping genes evolve when the ability to translate them exists. This correlation between the contrasts
associated with gains and the time since the gain

Figure 3 Schematic representation of the phylogenetic relationship between the primate species examined for gau followed by
numbers of stops in this region. Underlined species possess a predicted mitochondrial antisense antitermination AGR tRNA, which potentially
enables translation of the AGR codons without importing cytosolic tRNAs. Broad branches represent evolution in the presence of antitermination
tRNAs, as predicted by parsimony. Branch lengths are not proportional to divergence times, but specific nodes used for contrast analyses
between lineages with and without antitermination AGR tRNA are indicated by capital letters, together with estimated divergence times,
because these lineages with and without antitermination AGR tRNA diverged. Divergence times (millions of years) shown are from the following
references (superscripts match the corresponding nodes indicated by capital letters): [27]1, [28]2, [29]3, [30]4, [31]5, [32]6, [33]7 and [34]8. *Analyses
of several sequences indicate the possibility of a polymorphism in the presence of the antitermination AGR tRNA in Varecia. It is most
parsimonious to assume that the presence of antitermination AGR tRNA is very recent in this genus.

occurred (times are indicated in Figure 3) exists for primate mt gau, as shown in Figure 4 (non-parametric
Spearman rank correlation rs = 0.93, one-sided P =
0.0113). The correlation was unexpectedly negative for
losses (non-parametric Spearman rank correlation rs =
-0.77, two-sided P = 0.0836) but weaker and statistically
insignificant.
This section presents two independent analyses that
suggest that mt antisense antitermination tRNAs with
anticodons matching the AGR codons translate gau: significant majorities of phylogenetic independent contrasts
are positive; and the contrasts increase with time as the
evolutionary ability of mitochondria to translate AGR
codons is gained. The coevolution between gau and the
mitochondrial translational apparatus strongly supports
the hypothesis of the mitochondrial expression of gau.
In vertebrate mitochondria, the expression of gau would
require a modification of the vertebrate mitochondrial
genetic code, which would mean reassigning the stop
AGR codons to code for arginine [5].
Data concerning the selective pressure on the gau ORF
and protein structure

A relatively high level of amino acid sequence similarity
has been found between alpha-proteobacterial proteins
and metazoan Gau proteins. For example, in Wolbachia
bacteria and Drosophila simulans Gau, the amount of
sequence containing identical and functionally similar
amino acids is 47.5% and 57.4%, respectively (Table 2).

Figure 4 Contrasts in the numbers of AGR codons in the
mitochondrial gau genes of primates. Analyses made between
the lineages with and without antisense antitermination tRNA (from
nodes A-N in Figure 3) as a function of the divergence times
between these lineages. Numbers near data points refer to the
smallest sample size used in the contrast calculation. Open symbols
are for nodes where the antisense antitermination tRNA was
presumably lost. Filled symbols indicate gains according to the
parsimonious interpretations of Figure 3.

These values are very significant: higher values for identical amino acids are only found in some parts of the
Cox1 proteins but not in other translated cox1
sequences from other potential reading frames (Table
2). The gau ORF is always found in the same reading
frame, which is in the antisense strand overlapping the
cox1 gene in such a way that the third position of the
cox1 gene codons are complementary to the third position of the gau ORF triplets (Figure 1). This implies that
in the first two positions, point mutations in the cox1
gene are almost always associated with major structural
changes in the Gau protein. Therefore, changes in the
gau and cox1 codons are limited.
Complementary analyses have been made to determine if the relatively high degree of conservation of the
deduced protein sequence is under heavy selective pressure or is due to the sequence conservation of the cox1
genes. Analyses reveal that for 12/100 positions in the
Gau protein, the amino acid changes preferably occur
within the same family (F/L/I/M/V, K/N and Q/H).
However, because the most conserved positions (first
and second) on the cox1 codons correspond to the second and first positions on gau codons, respectively,
changes within a functionally similar amino acid family
are facilitated (for example: I/M, F/L, Q/H and N/K, but
not I/F) (Figure 2 and Table 3).
Moreover, overlap coding for gau by the mitochondrial
cox1 gene implies that synonymous codon usage is optimized to enable overlap coding on the opposite strand.
Simulations of the human mitochondrial cox1 region
which randomly reassign synonymous codons according
to synonymous codon frequencies found in the human
cox1 gene enabled us to test this hypothesis. These simulated sequences do not alter the sequence of the protein
as coded by the main frame but do alter the sequence of
Gau. The third codon position of Gau, which corresponds to the third codon position in cox1, alters synonymous codons in the two-fold codon families in cox1 but
does not alter the amino acids putatively encoded by
Gau. Therefore, simulations can only alter gau at cox1
codons from four-fold codon families corresponding to
codons in gau to an amino acid encoded by a two-fold
codon family. Greater possibilities exist for the six-fold
codon families coding for leucine and serine. However,
this suggests that the simulations that randomly reassign
synonymous codons at the cox1 gene level have limited
freedom to alter Gau. In addition, synonymous codon
usages are biased, which decreases the possibility of altering Gau even more. If, for example, nine out of ten
codons that code for phenylalanine are UUU and only
one is UUC, the simulations will alter the original codon
at most in only 2 cases.
On average, the simulations altered “only” synonymous codons in 51.4 percent of cox1 but altered 53.5

The sequences have been divided into five parts, including the gau region. Concerning the last region (values are in bold), the translations correspond either to
the exact nucleotide sequence or to +/- 1 or two nucleotide(s) sequences according to the reading frame. For Drosophila and Wolbachia, the accession numbers
are AF200838.1/AAF77368 and AE017196/AAS14036.1, respectively. The genetic codes are those of invertebrate mitochondria and of bacteria. The sequence of
Drosophila simulans is preferred to that of D. melanogaster because the start codon is undetermined in the latter. Abbreviations (a.a.: amino acids).

percent in the region corresponding to gau. This result
is statistically significant. Twenty independent simulation replications were performed and a paired t test
between the percentages altered in the cox1 gene at
large versus the gau region indicated that this difference is statistically significant (two-tailed paired t test,
P = 0.00479). This suggests that the amino acid

composition of Gau is slightly more open to alterations
by simulations than the rest of cox1. This result, if
interpreted as the result of selection, suggests an adaptation allow some freedom for gau to evolve independently of cox1 and more than for other regions of
cox1, which are presumably not involved in overlap
coding.

This analysis was performed on the sequences in figure 2, excluding the
human mitochondrion. Only positions for which all amino acids are
functionally similar are mentioned. The number of sequences containing a
given amino acid is in parentheses.

Altering synonymous codons at the cox1 level does
not necessarily alter the amino acids encoded in Gau, as
explained above. Indeed, on average, 79.8 percent of
Gau amino acids remained unchanged by simulations,
which means that on average only 37.8 percent of the
altered codons resulted in amino acid changes in Gau.
Because of these relatively high constraints on the
effects of simulations on coding properties of gau, simulations should not have altered much GAU. So, we
blasted [36,37] the amino acid sequence coded by each
of the 20 simulated cox1 sequences. These aligned with
the same sequence as found for the original GAU
sequence translated for that frame from the natural cox1
sequence, as found previously [5]. However, the nonrandom nature of the natural cox1 coding sequence, in
relation to the overlapping gau coding region, is
revealed by the observation that the alignment quality is
systematically lower for simulated sequences than for
the natural sequence: 81.2 percent of the residues were
identical or similar for the natural sequence, and on
average, only 77.8 percent (standard deviation 1.6) were
identical or similar for the 20 simulated sequences (twotailed, one sample t test, P < 0.0001). This means that
Gau proteins translated from simulated human cox1
sequences differ more from the GenBank sequences
than the natural sequence. Hence, the natural sequence
is optimized toward a given coding content and its high
quality alignment with the GenBank sequence is not
due to chance. If no such optimization existed, simulated sequences when compared to the GenBank
sequences would have had greater similarity to the GenBank sequences than the natural sequences in approximately half of the cases; however, this was not the case
for the 20 simulated replications. It is important to
stress here that this non-random result is even more
unlikely considering that simulations alter so few Gau
amino acids (approximately 80 percent remain

unchanged). These simulation analyses suggest that cox1
coding sequences are optimized to enable overlap coding for Gau and that matching an existing GenBank
sequence of Gau is not the result of chance.
The ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous
(dS) changes between taxa is frequently computed to
determine the strength and direction of selection. Thus,
protein and DNA sequences coding for Gau and a part
of Cox1 (i.e., corresponding to the complementary
regions of gau) from vertebrates and protostomia were
retrieved from GenBank. Protein sequences were aligned
using MUSCLE [38]. The correspondence between the
protein alignments and each DNA sequence was established using Wise2 software [39]. The CodeML program
of the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) software package was used to test for positive
selection using the M2a and M1a models, respectively
[40]. Likelihood ratio tests were calculated by comparing
M1a to M2a with df = 2. The site model M2a was
applied to test the evolutionary shift by maximum likelihood analysis for gau. This model allows the ω (= dN/
dS ratio) to vary among sites. The ratios ω > 0, ω = 0,
and ω < 0 signify positive selection (adaptive molecular
evolution), neutral mutations, and negative selection
(purifying selection), respectively. In our analyses, no
significant positive selection was found, and a majority
of the sites evolve with a ω (dN/dS) < 0 (data not
shown).
Distribution of nonsense mutations along gau ORFs

We have searched for nonsense codons that disrupt the
coding frame of the gau gene in several different organisms. We downloaded available mitochondrial genomes
from the NCBI Organelle Genome Resource [41]. A
total of 1,525 complete genomes were analyzed. Among
them, 1147 sequences from metazoa, 33 from fungi, 25
from plants and 28 from other eukaryotes were found
to code for GSPPP (see below). This pentanucleotide
was chosen because it is the most conserved domain
among the gau-bearing taxa, and it has been found in
more than 93%, 96%, and 97% of the fungi, alpha-proteobacteria and plant, and protostomian, and deuterostomian complete mitochondrial genomes, respectively.
Moreover, most of the sequences that do not contain
this region may be uncertain or have undetermined
nucleotides (data not shown). As a cautionary note, it
has been observed that approximately a quarter of the
published complete mtDNAs contain misannotations,
although they generally concern tRNA genes [3,42].
Using the highly conserved sequence GSPPP (Figure 2)
as an anchoring position, we have searched for stop
codons in: i) 100 codons upstream of the glycine of the
GSPPP sequence; ii) 100 codons downstream from the
glycine of the GSPPP sequence; and iii) 100 codons

Faure et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:56
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/56

downstream of the start codon number 101 from the
previous measure (Table 4). As shown in Table 4, the
largest numbers of sequences from the 100 possible
codons without nonsense mutations (223) are found 100
codons downstream of the GSPPP sequence (region ii)
in contrast to the regions upstream (4) and downstream
(90) of the gau sequence (regions i and iii, respectively).
Sequences without nonsense stop codons are found
mainly in protostomia.
To expand our knowledge regarding Gau proteins, different types of analyses using structural bioinformatic
tools were performed. Sequence similarity is not uniform throughout the Gau proteins, but a computeraided prediction of the secondary structure of eukaryotic
Gau proteins showed b strands in the NH2 part of the
protein and a helices (with the exception of those of
Monosiga brevicollis (protist)) in the first part of the
COOH-region (Figure 5). Moreover, the Gau proteins
(with the exception of those of alpha-proteobacteria)
contain two regions (near their middle): a positively
charged domain followed by a very hydrophobic one. In
addition, examination of the hydrophobicity profiles
revealed a convincing relationship between the Gau proteins; all exhibit similar profiles, which suggest a close
structural equivalence (Figure 6). Various programs have
been used to predict the transmembrane regions and/or
signal peptide: Phobius [43], PrediSi [44], PSORT [45]
and PRED-TMR [46]. However, no transmembrane
domain or signal peptide has been highlighted, which
suggests that these proteins could be localized in the
periplasm. It should be mentioned that these proteins
do not have any obvious motifs or domains that are
conserved in other proteins in databases, such as the
PROSITE database.

cephaloptera (unpublished data). In addition, the poly
(A) tail is generally removed during cloning. Therefore,
in databases, ESTs containing sequences similar to the
whole gau regions and bearing a poly(A) tail are very
rare. However, examples belonging to a plant, a mollusk
and an insect were found (Additional file 2). No EST
sequence containing both the entire gau region and a
poly(A) tail was found in vertebrates; however, examples
of two murid sequences cloned unidirectionally using an
oligo dT are shown in Additional file 2.
Immunolocalization of human Gau proteins

An anti-Gau monoclonal antibody was produced by
Proteogenix (Oberhausbergen, France, http://www.proteogenix.fr) using the peptide sequence GSPPPAGSKKEVLK as the antigen. This peptide corresponds to a
eukaryotic consensus sequence of the NH2 terminus of
this protein (residues 2 to 15) (Figure 2). BLAST analysis revealed no significant alignments of this peptide
with the GenBank human protein sequences (data not
shown). A higher degree of similarity was found in one
and six proteins with 10 and 8 identical amino acids out
of 14, respectively. Moreover, identical amino acids are
non-contiguous in the primary sequences, and the corresponding proteins are not localized to the mitochondria. Among the proteins having 7 identical amino acids
in the peptide sequence is a protein with a mitochondrial localization signal, but the alignment contains a
gap. Use of the anti-Gau antibody has revealed a strict
co-localization of Gau proteins and the mitochondrial
marker MitotrackerRed CMXRos in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and almost all Gau proteins are localized to the mitochondria (Figure 7). Moreover, control experiments using preimmune serum
remained negative.

Transcription of the gau region

BLAST analysis was performed to determine EST
EMBL/GenBank database sequences similar to the gau
regions of various taxa. However, the main problem
encountered during this type of search is that many of
the ESTs are known to be misoriented [47], and the
EST sequences corresponding to the gau region could
be doubtful. Nevertheless, we combined multiple results
to infer the correct orientation of the mRNAs and ESTs,
including sequence type (mRNA or EST), CDS annotation, data on the cloning strategy and poly(A) signal/tail.
The presence of the poly(A) tail is an unambiguous criterion to determine the EST orientation; however, the
nature of the 3’ end post-transcriptional modifications
in mitochondria varies significantly among organisms.
Poly(A) tails have been detected in most plant mitochondrial mRNAs, in some trypanosomal (protist) and
mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs [48], and in numerous mitochondrial ESTs of the chaetognath Spadella

Discussion
The origin of novel genes is mostly attributed to processes, such as the mutation, duplication, and rearrangement of genetic segments. A rarely considered
alternative is that proteins may arise continuously de
novo (i.e., from a non-coding sequence). The possibility
of generating new genes from pre-existing nucleotide
sequences was first suggested by Grassé [49], who called
it “overprinting”. There are two principal types of overlap: (1) the same-strand type in which the two genes
involved are transcribed from the same strand but in
different reading frames and (2) the different-strand
type in which the two genes are transcribed from different strands. Overlapping genes are known to be common in viruses, mitochondria, bacteria, plasmids and
even in vertebrates (references in [50,51]). However,
with the exception of viruses [52], it is widely assumed
that only one strand can encode a protein and that the

Figure 5 Prediction of the secondary structure. The HNN (Hierarchical Neural Network) prediction method was used (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/

non-coding strands do not, although they can play a
role in regulation [53]. The term janology (from the
two-faced Roman deity Jano) has been proposed for
the homologous relationship among the sequences
sharing the same DNA [54]; although the term refers
to Jano, it would be more appropriate to use this term
for naming proteins encoded by the complementary
strands of a DNA duplex. In the present study, analysis
of complete mtDNAs has revealed an ORF in the complementary strand of the cox1 gene. Interestingly, the
mitochondrial gene content is highly variable across
extant eukaryotes. However, despite the disparity in
size, all mtDNAs encode long and small subunit ribosomal RNAs and two components of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain: Apocytochrome b and Cox-1
[4]. Evidence now firmly supports that mitochondria
have a single origin; they arised from a eubacterial
symbiont whose closest contemporary relatives are
found within the alpha-proteobacteria [8,55]. The
sequence of the deduced Gau proteins is relatively
highly conserved not only in protist, plant, fungal and
animal mtDNAs but also in alpha-proteobacteria. Its
lack in other bacteria taxa strongly suggests an ancestral co-evolution of this region over the last 1.5 to 2.0
billion years [56].

Due to alternative translational mechanisms, it is difficult to predict the exact size of the gau coding region.
Alternatives to the AUG start codons are very common
among mtDNA genes, so it is unusual to find an AUG
codon at the beginning of orthologous genes from different species ([13,57] and references there in [58]. For
example, in almost all of the taxa, some of the NUN
codons could be used as start codons. Interestingly, in
the N-terminal region of the putative Gau proteins, a
methionine or an isoleucine has generally been found at
the same position, and it is known that the AUC/AUU/
AUA codons (normally an isoleucine codon) can serve
as initiation codons. In addition, in the transcript, an
initiator AUG codon can be created by RNA editing [9].
The physiological translational stop codons are also
unknown. However, codons in position 101, in reference
to the putative initiation codon, are generally ochre
(UAA) or amber (UAG) stop codons, which are the
most efficient stop codons, strongly suggest a possible
termination of the ORF at this position. Moreover, in
the gau ORFs, the UAN codons are rare, and when present, the UAC or UAU triplets are preferentially translated into tyrosine. In addition, when internal stop
codons are found in the gau sequences of both bacteria
and plants, it is almost always the opal stop codon

(UGA). However, it is not only the least efficient translational terminator, but there is evidence in eukaryotic
and bacterial cells that it is translated by the tryptophan-tRNA [59,60]. The fact that these internal opal
stop codons have been found at almost always the same
position where the tryptophan amino acid is encoded in
the other sequences (e.g., Drosophila and protists Monosiga brevicollis and Rhodomonas salina) suggests that
these codons could be read. It is well known that in
numerous taxa, mitochondrial codon usage varies from
the standard genetic code, principally in the use of UGA
as a tryptophan codon [13]. Sequence determination of
metazoan mt protein genes followed by the comparison
of the deduced amino acid sequences with those of
other species has shown that the amino acid assignment
of the codons AGA/AGG differs among metazoans
[61,62]. Instead of arginine, the AGA/AGG codons specify serine in most invertebrates, including protostomia
and echinoderms (references in [63]). Several arthropods
translate the codon AGG as lysine instead of serine [64],
and the protein genes of diptera (insects) do not contain
the codon AGG [65]. In vertebrates, one or both of the
AGA/AGG codons are generally absent or rarely used
as stop codons [61]. Surprisingly, these two codons are
numerous in vertebrate gau sequences (for an example,
see the mitochondrial human sequence in Additional
file 1). This is compatible with the cytosolic synthesis of
Gau, perhaps from the nuclear mitochondrial pseudogene and the in situ mitochondrial expression of the
gau gene, which may be induced by importing cytosolic
AGR tRNAs with cognate Arg into the mitochondria.
Mitochondrial synthesis of Gau independent of cytosol
import is also possible due to the production of mitochondrial antisense, antitermination suppressor tRNAs
with anticodons that match AGR stop codons [5] (see
also Figures 3 and 4).
If we hypothesize that the size of the gau ORF is likely
approximately 100 codons, various data showing the high
degree of conservation of the deduced Gau protein
sequences indicate that the gau sequence is under relatively heavy selective pressure and that it is not due to
the overprinting bias. This assumption is based on the
following facts: 1) the conserved positions of both the
potential initiation and stop codons, 2) the high level of
synonymous mutations, and 3) the cox1 genes are organized in exons and introns, as shown in some taxa
[66-68] and in these taxa, the gau ORFs are complementary to only one part of an exon (see the examples in
Table 5). Interestingly, in some species, the last nucleotide of the gau stop codon corresponds to the first
nucleotide of the cox1 exon. This is another element supporting the functionality of the gau ORF products.

MitoTracker Red CMXRos, a mitochondrial marker (red). In (E, F), colocalization of Gau protein (green) and mitochondria (red). After reaching
confluence, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, France). Mitotracker Red
CMXRos (200 nM) was added to the cells for 10 min. After this incubation, the cells were washed for 10 min with HBSS and then fixed directly
with 4% PFA for 3 min at 4°C. The cells were covered with Vectashield mounting medium to avoid bleaching the fluorescence. All steps were
performed in the dark. For immunodetection of Gau proteins, the mouse monoclonal antibody developed by ProteoGenix (Oberhausbergen,
France) was used. To minimize any non-specific antibody binding, the cells were first incubated in 10% normal goat serum in PBS (0.1 M)
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, they were incubated overnight at
4°C in the primary monoclonal antibody against Gau, which was diluted at 1/100 in a PBS (0.1 M) solution containing 10% normal goat serum
and 2% bovine serum albumin. After being rinsed three times, the cells were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody, Alexa 488-coupled
anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) diluted at 1:400. Finally, the cells were rinsed in PBS and mounted in a medium containing an antifading agent (Gel/
MountR, Bibmeda, USA). The primary antibody was omitted for the controls. Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal
microscope (63x objective, numerical aperture 1.35). All parameters (laser percentage and voltage, light, gain, exposure, offset values) were
adjusted to achieve the best results.

Despite the failure to identify the physiological translation initiation and stop codons, we hypothesized that
the gau ORFs could encode at least a 100 amino acid
sequence. Because, for example, in the invertebrate
mitochondrial genetic code, two of the sixty-four codons
encode stops, an ORF that contains at least 100 codons
is unlikely to appear by chance in the non-coding
sequence with an average base composition. Thus, the
presence of an ORF ≥100 codons is frequently considered to be a rough indication that the sequence is, or is
not, protein-coding. Frequently, only ORFs greater than
100 codons in length are annotated as genes, and as a
consequence, any ORF ≤100 codons is treated as spurious until proven otherwise through either experimental
or comparative work. The gau ORF is longer than the
minimal size compatible with a functional protein. For

example, in metazoans, ATP8 is the smallest mitochondrially encoded protein; it is only approximately
50-65 amino acids long, and only half a dozen of these
amino acids are well conserved across animal mtDNAs
[69]. Approximately, twenty identical amino acids have
been found in the deduced Gau protein sequences of
both eukaryotes and bacteria. Moreover, due to overprinting, the composition of the Gau proteins is biased,
and the level of amino-acid conservation is low for a
mitochondrial protein. Interestingly, the mitochondrial
protein ATP8 is not only well conserved within the
metazoans and alignments could contain indels [56],
which is contrary to most of the Gau alignments. Interestingly, ATP8 is more conserved at the level of secondary structure and in the chemical characteristics of the
amino acids than in specific amino acid identity [55].

Similarly, comparisons of the secondary structure, especially the hydrophobicity profiles of Gau proteins, suggest that these putative proteins are structurally
equivalent and could have similar physiological roles
(Figures 5 and 6). Some amino acid differences have
been found between eukaryote and bacterial proteins.
However, this could be due to different constraints
between the mitochondrial periplasm and the bacterial
cytoplasm. In addition, these proteins do not have any
obvious motifs or domains that are conserved in other
proteins in the databases. Two reasons could explain
this result: first, the Gau protein may be unique, and
second, gau is an overprinting gene. Indeed, the creation
of new coding sequences by overprinting has many constraints [70]. Mutations must allow an optimal adaptation of the new gene without inducing unfavorable
mutations in the original gene. The maintenance of two
functional overlapping genes is likely to constrain the
ability of both genes to become optimally adapted.
Genes that have arisen by overprinting can be identified
by their biased composition. Thus, the new gene will
exhibit unusual codon usage and encode new proteins
with physicochemically biased properties [71]. The gau
gene has a strongly biased composition, and both the
first and second codon positions are “locked” (Figure 1).
Interestingly, a recent study suggested that some viral
overlapping reading frames that encode hypothetical
proteins with highly unusual and biased composition,
often discarded as non-coding, may in fact encode proteins [70].
Integration of mt genes into the nuclear genome is a
physiologically important process contributing to the
origin and evolution of the eukaryotic cell [63]. The
transfer of entire genes from the mitochondria to the

nucleus appears to continually occur in some plants
(references in [72]). Although the transfer of entire
genes seems to have ended in animals, DNA fragments
of mitochondrial origin continue to integrate into the
nuclear genome (references in [73,74]). Copies of mitochondrial sequences that are present in nuclear genomes
are commonly referred to as “numts” (nuclear mitochondrial-like sequences) [75,76]. Although numts are
common in several taxa, the stable nuclear absorption
of mtDNA sequences does not appear to be universal.
No numts have been reported in Plasmodium falciparum (protist), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), or
Drosophila (insect), although these organisms are well
studied [76]. Moreover, functional mt genes transferred
to the nucleus via endosymbiotic gene transfer no
longer occurs in animals but is still an active process in
green algae and land plants [77-79]. Numerous gau-like
nuclear sequences have been found in vertebrate nuclear
genomes, principally in cox-1 pseudogenes, but the analysis of the flanking regions suggests a strong selection
pressure favoring sequence conservation only in the gau
regions. Moreover, the proteins deduced from these
regions exhibit a surprising homology level with the
mitochondrial paralogs, which suggests possible nuclear
transcription. This allows genes to evolve independently
of the cox1 genes and possible lecture of vertebrate
mitochondrial stop codons AGA/AGG [56], although
mechanisms enabling in situ mitochondrial expression
exist either via importing cytosolic tRNAs or independent of import by mitochondrial antisense antitermination tRNAs [5] (see also Figures 3 and 4).
Estimations of the ratio of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions (dN/dS) at sites in the overlapping reading frames of the gau and cox1 regions

Faure et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:56
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/56

(complementary to gau) provide strong evidence for an
evolutionary mode under purifying selection. The selective pressure is similar for these regions in both protostomia and vertebrates, which suggests that also in the
latter taxon, Gau proteins are also mitochondrially
encoded. Interestingly, in viruses, it has been shown that
dN/dS rates were consistently lower in regions with
more overlap than in those with less overlap; however,
these analyses only concern genes which overlap on the
same strand ([80] and references there in). Other analyses, in which genes overlapping on the opposite strand
have been studied, show that false results concerning
the nature of the selection are not unfrequent and that
non-functional overlapping ORFs are evolutionnary conserved because their sequence is shared with functional
genes [81,82]. This strongly suggests that bioinformatic
analyses of evolutionary conservation could be uninformative in the case of overlapping genes.
Because of the problematic assignment of the orientation of ESTs, unambiguous sequences corresponding to
the gau region are rare in the database. However, some
EST sequences bearing the entire gau region containing
a terminal poly(A) tail exist. It is probable that the EST
sequences for which the orientation is unknown could
correspond to the transcriptional regions of gau
sequences. It is also possible that, as has been already
shown for another janolog sequence (ribin, which is
found on the complementary strand of the 28S rRNA
gene [83,84]), the relatively low level of gau-EST
sequences may result from transcription that is tissue
specific, by transcription that only occurs in infected/
stressed organisms or during particular stages of development. In addition, it must keep in mind that both
same-strand and opposite-strand overlapping ORFs may
be transcribed regardless of functionality [85]. Moreover,
immunohistological experiments using an anti-Gau
monoclonal antibody clearly showed a mitochondrial
specific signal in human cells. The human mitochondrial
proteome consists of an estimated 1,100-1,400 distinct
proteins, only 13 of which are encoded by the mtDNA.
In addition, approximately 15% of the mitochondrial
proteome awaits identification [86], and the Gau proteins could be one of these still unknown proteins.

Testing the hypothesis
The presence of the Gau proteins still remains hypothetical. Concerning the anti-peptide antibody, based on
the expected N-terminal sequence of Gau, experimental
studies are needed to determine its size, whether the
antibody reacts with a single protein, and whether the
sequence of the immunoreactive protein corresponds to
the predicted gau gene product. Moreover, a set of
immunohistological experiments is required to demonstrate that these proteins are present and functional

Page 17 of 22

both in eukaryote and alpha-proteobacteria cells. This
includes the use of monoclonal antibodies against the
putative amino, central, and carboxyl terminal synthetic
peptides of GAU proteins, Western blot analysis and
immunological analyses of different subcellular enrichments from several cell types. These immunoprecipitation analyses are required to determine if the gau ORF
could encode a functional protein in the mitochondria.
Mass spectrometry could be applied to identify the Gau
proteins from highly enriched mitochondrial extracts.
This hypothesis could also be tested by purifying the
product of the gau gene and determining its sequence.
Cell biological experiments are needed to determine the
physiological role of this protein. However, in preliminary studies, this hypothesis can also be tested genetically
by constructing yeast or alpha-proteobacteria strains
with a tagged gau gene and analyzing gau-negative
mutants. The tag would allow the purification of Gau by
affinity chromatography and analysis of the purified protein by mass spectrometry. Yeast is a useful organism
that can be used to gain a better understanding of the
genetic and molecular properties of mitochondria.
Moreover, the general conservation of both mitochondrial genes and pathways between human and yeast
allows us to use yeast as a model for some diseases [87].
Similarly, the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter
sphaeroides is a popular model system already used to
demonstrate the functional effects of human mitochondrial DNA mutations, including those within the structural subunits of cytochrome c oxidases [88,89].
However, it must not be forgotten that in yeast and
alpha-proteobacteria, the gau region is on the opposite
strand of the cox1 gene. In vertebrates, gau regions are
in the nucleus as a possible functional pseudogene and
on the complementary strand of the mitochondrionencoded cox1 gene. Moreover, it also stresses that future
studies are likely to confirm the existence of the other
putative overlapping genes [5].

Implications of the hypothesis
The protein families involved in basic cellular pathways
are highly conserved throughout evolution, and despite
the fact that further work is required to determine
whether the gau ORF encodes a functional protein, we
hypothesize that studies of this ORF will highlight the
evolutionary origin of mitochondria and the possible
overlapping mitochondrial genetic code. Moreover,
despite the small size of the mitochondrial genome,
mtDNA mutations are important causes of inherited
disease. Indeed, pathogenic point mutations and rearrangements of the mtDNA have been reported in a wide
spectrum of clinical disorders, including neurodegenerative disease, aging and cancer (reviewed in [1,86]). However, many challenges remain. Relatively little is known

Faure et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:56
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/56

concerning the precise pathophysiological mechanisms
that lead to cellular dysfunction and pathology, and we
hypothesize that studies of Gau proteins could help to
provide a better understanding of mitochondrial disease.

Reviewers’ comments
Changes are highlighted in yellow in the manuscript
Referee 1: Arcady Mushegian, Kansas University Medical
Center

The manuscript by Faure et al reports an intriguing
observation of a novel conserved putative ORF in the
antisense orientation of the mitochondrial and alphaproteobacterial cox1 genes. I am somewhat concerned
about the significance of these observations, since most
of the case is made by pointing out various aspects and
consequences of high sequence conservation of this
ORF, which itself is a consequence of its overlap with
also conserved cox1.
Authors’ response: Part of the supporting data relates
to the simulations showing that natural sequences are
optimized for overlapping coding with the cox1 region,
which is also assumed to code for gau. In addition, variation within gau among primates coevolves with the
part of the mt translational apparatus specifically
required for gau’s translation. Such analyses are not
dependent on alignments and conservation and are
themselves strong independent confirmation of the results
based on conservation.
Western with anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies is
good but not enough - have the authors tried to also
detect the transcript using the strand-specific probe?
Authors’ response: This experiment has not been performed; however, we performed BLAST searches of gau
regions against the EST GenBank database. Although
apparently rare, some correctly oriented EST sequences
bearing the complete gau regions were found.
P. 5: “The deduced Gau protein sequence is relatively
well conserved not only in protists, fungi, plants and
animals mtDNAs but also in members of the alphaproteobacteria taxa (rickettsiales, rhizobacteria rhodobacterales, etc...) ... but not in other bacterial taxa” – is the
ORF for Gau found in the opposite strand of the cox1
in alphaproteobacteria? Do other taxa have cox1, and
what to make of the lack of gau there?
Authors’ response: We have added this sentence in the
MS: « In other bacterial taxa, such as proteobacteria
other than alpha-proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, a region with a
lower degree of similarity to the Gau protein can also be
found after translation of the complementary strand of
the genes encoding members of the cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I-like SCOP superfamily [9]. »

Page 18 of 22

p. 6: “overlaps the cox1 gene in such a way that the
third positions of gene codons overlap with the third
positions of the overlapping ORF triplets” – three “overlaps” in one sentence is a bit if stylistic trouble, but,
more important, the meaning is unclear. One base cannot “overlap” another base, only be the same if they are
in the same strand, or be complementary if they are in
the opposite strands as is the case here.
Authors’ response: As suggested by the referee, the
changes have been made.
Ibid. “Therefore, gau codons have much restriction to
change, as compared to those of cox1.” – not “as compared to”, but rather “as well as"?
Authors’ response: Corrected.
p. 6: Changes in 1st and 2nd position of either ORF
will impact the other one strongly, no?
Authors’ response: This is now discussed in the manuscript: « ... However, because the most conserved positions (first and second) on the cox1 codons correspond to
the second and first positions on gau codons, respectively,
changes within a functionally similar amino acid family
are facilitated (for example: I/M, F/L, Q/H and N/K, but
not I/F) (Figure 2and Table 3). »
p. 7 and following: GSPPP is not a motif, it is an exact
match in all sequences - is it variable in some of the
sequences that are not shown
Authors’ response: Corrected. Data concerning the conservation of this sequence are now in the manuscript.

Title: Probable presence of an ubiquitous cryptic
mitochondrial gene on the antisense strand of the cytochrome oxydase I gene
Version: 1 Date: 27 April 2011
Reviewer number: 2
Report form:
This manuscript proposes the existence of a novel
conserved protein, Gau, expressed on the antisense
strand opposite the cox-1 gene. The evidence based on
bioinformatics analyses is circumstantial and not compelling on its own, but does indicate that it is worthwhile testing the hypothesis. They went part of the way,
by raising an anti-peptide antibody based on the
expected N-terminal sequence of Gau, and demonstrating that human cells express immunoreactivity that is
localized to mitochondria. However, they did not characterize the immunoreactive protein at all - does the
antibody react with a single protein, and is it of the
expected size? Does the sequence of the immunoreactive
protein correspond to the predicted Gau gene product?
I would want to see a Western blot (preferably of several cell types, and across different subcellular

Faure et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:56
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/56

compartments within the cells), at least, before I would
feel that their hypothesis has been validated
experimentally.
Authors’ response: According to the « Instructions for
Biology Direct authors » (http://www.biology-direct.
com/authors/instructions/hypothesis), « hypothesis articles should present an untested original hypothesis
backed up solely by a survey of previously published
results rather than any new evidence. Hypothesis articles
should not be reviews and should not contain new data.
They should be articles outlining significant progress in
thinking that would also be testable, though not so easily
testable that readers will wonder why the testing has not
already been done ».
We agree with the referee’s comments, and given the
interest in these experimental studies, we have added a
chapter entitled « Testing the hypothesis ». Moreover, in
the revised manuscript, we consider that the convergence
of different independent types of bioinformatic analyses
is more than circumstantial and is a body of evidence
worth consideration, although it is not yet compelling.
Concerning the specificity of the antibody, as is now indicated in the manuscript, BLAST analyses suggest that no
part of any known human proteins exhibits a high level
of amino acid identity with the peptide antigen that is
used for immunization and antibody production.
There are also widespread typos and errors in English
usage that should be corrected.
Authors’ response: Now after yours remark, the English
of the MS has been corrected and improved by American
Journal Experts.

Reviewer’s report
Title: Probable presence of an ubiquitous cryptic
mitochondrial gene on the antisense strand of the cytochrome oxydase I gene
Version: 1 Date: 3 June 2011
Reviewer number: 3
Report form:
Major comments:
Presentation of the hypothesis: Numbers are presented
for the conservation between the gau ORF in Wolbachia
and Drosophila and the statement is made that such
levels are “very significant”. It is not clear, however, setting aside for the moment the lack of stop codons, how
much conservation would be expected given the corresponding conservation of the cox1 gene region on the
opposite strands. A null hypothesis should be considered. What is the minimum amount of conservation
that could be generated from the observed Cox1 protein
sequences? Is there less conservation in the opposite
strand in a different region of the cox1 coding sequence
that has approximately the same relative conservation

Page 19 of 22

between Wolbachia and Drosophila? I find that the
statement included following this, that the gau gene
contains a positive patch and a hydrophobic patch,
although not linked to any strong statement, is meant to
imply that Gau is a “real” protein. I find this a very
weak inference, as it is not clear to what extent random
changes to the corresponding cox1 sequence might generate sequences in the opposite strand that have the
“appearence” of protein-like structures.
Authors’ response: The comparison between the
sequences of Wolbachia and Drosophila has been
improved. In the present analysis, the cox1 gene has been
divided into five parts, including the region corresponding to gau sequence. This latter region corresponds to the
most conserved sequence of the cox1 gene. Thus, a null
hypothesis should not be excluded; especially because
bioinformatic analyses (dN/dS) do not suggest a positive
selective pressure on the mt gau regions. We agree with
the referee’s remark that we do not demonstrate that
“Gau” proteins are producted. However, many arguments
are provided that supports this hypothesis, including
immunodetection and BLAST results from the EST
database.
The case of gau regions in vertebrates: Special effort
were put into finding gau-homologous regions in vertebrate genomes because of the presence of stop codons
in the mitochondrial cox1 antisense sequences. These
observations should be paired with control evaluations
of genomes that have a mitochondrially-encoded gau
region, and thus should be less likely to have nuclear
versions.
Authors’ response: Analyses in the reference [5]by Seligmann, who is now a co-author of this MS, suggest that
in vertebrates, two hypotheses are possible: mitochondrial
recruitment of a nuclear pseudogene product or that
Gau is the result of in situ mitochondrial expression
using cytosolic tRNAs or mitochondrial antisense antitermination tRNAs. The second hypothesis (expression of a
mitochondrial gene) is the most parsimonious hypothesis.
Data concerning selection pressure of the gau ORF
and protein structure: In the line “...mutations in the
cox1 gene involve de facto important changes...”, the
word “important” should be changed or carefully
defined. The word “important” is repeated at the end of
that pararaph, but again without sufficient definition.
Authors’ response: We have removed this ambiguous
sentence. Moreover, the word “important” has been
replaced by « major structural » changes.
The exposition of the analysis of possible changes is a
good start, but devoid of any numerical or statistical
treatment, it is impossible to determine the significance
of the results. Are 12/100 more than expected to behave
in the way shown? What are the odds of a random
mutation constrained by the relative orientation of the

Faure et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:56
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/56

Cox1 and Gau genes resulting in the retention of amino
acids within their “conformational” selection groups?
Authors’ response: We agree with the referee’s comment, especially because the results presented in Figure
2show that the cox1 region that is complementary to the
gau sequence is the most conserved. Thus, we added the
following sentence: “ ...because the most conserved positions (first and second) on the cox1 codons correspond to
the second and first positions on gau codons, respectively,
changes within a functionally similar amino acid family
are facilitated.”
Discussion: The likelihood that a 100 amino acid open
reading frame could arise by random chance in a noncoding stretch of DNA is alluded to, but is not really
relevant to the issue of the Gau ORF. More germane is
the likelihood that, given the observed conservation of
the particular Cox1 region in question, stop codons
could be avoided given all the possible allowed point
mutations. For example, at some positions the observed
Cox1 multiple sequence alignment might allow for so
few possible amino acids that a stop codon in the corresponding Gau codon would be impossible. The fact that
this ORF is aparrently conserved across large phylogenetic distances is very strong evidence, but it could be
made much stronger by presenting a calculation showing that the number of possible ways of disrupting this
ORF without harming the Cox1 gene is large and a very
likely outcome absent selection for the Gau protein’s
translation.
The data presented in Additional file 1show that the
number of stops within primate mt gau varies from 8 to
17. Hence, the coding constraints on cox1 do not prevent
changes in the number of stops in gau. In addition, the
fact that the number of stops coevolves with the ability
to translate stops by suppressor tRNAs shows that the
number of stops is not a random consequence of changes
in coding at the cox1 level. In the human mt gau, there
are 14 stops in the simulated sequences, which is constrained to keep cox1 unchanged. However, randomly
mutated synonymous codons contain an average of 11.35
± 1.5 stops, which are found at 21 locations throughout
gau. Hence, at least 21 stops could exist within gau in
humans without altering the protein encoded by cox1.
The fact that the natural sequence contains more stops
than the average simulated sequence may result from
pressures to avoid gau’s expression under conditions
other than those in which suppressor tRNAs are present
in the mitochondria.

Reviewer’s report
Title: Probable presence of an ubiquitous cryptic
mitochondrial gene on the antisense strand of the cytochrome oxydase I gene

Page 20 of 22

Version: 2 Date: 22 September 2011
Reviewer number: 3
Report form:
This work lays out an intriguing hypothesis that is
well supported by the existing data and a number of
preliminary
calculations
and
experimental
observations.
Whether the Gau transcript is a real and biologically
important entity or a very persistent phantom remains
to be experimentally tested. This manuscript provides a
sound basis and impetus for that effort.
Quality of written English: Needs some language
corrections before being published
Authors’ response: Despite that we have already had
the manuscript professionally copy-edited by American
Journal Experts some parts which could be difficult to
read have checked and improved if necessary for English
language by one colleague.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Alignments of mammalian Gau proteins and cox1
regions. Characteristics of the nuclear gau sequences are shown in Table
1. For each species, the alignments of the nuclear Gau proteins have
been provided with the sequences that have been deduced from the
mitochondrial cox1 gene (mt.mt and mt.st are sequences that were
translated using the standard and the mitochondrial (vertebrate) genetic
codes, respectively). The alignments of the nuclear cox1-like regions are
shown with those of the mitochondrial cox1 gene. For nuclear
sequences, the chromosome number is shown after the two letters “Ch”.
The nuclear sequences corresponding to the gau regions are in bold.
Characteristics of the nuclear sequences: Homo sapiens, cox1 (NC_001807,

Additional file 2: Alignments of the EST sequences containing the
complete region of Gau translation with homologous regions in
mtDNA. With the exception of the Rattus norvegicus sequence, the
closest mtDNA issued from a complete genome has been used.
Additionally, the nucleotide positions in the genome are given. The
sequences corresponding to the gau regions are in bold letters.
Characteristics of the sequences are the following: A) EST sequence from
Eucalyptus gunnii (Viridiplantae, CT987850.1; another EST sequence
(CT980201.1) is strictly identical to this one) and mtDNA sequence from
Carica papaya (Viridiplantae, NC_012116); B) EST sequence from
Biomphalaria glabrata (Mollusca, EE049639.1; the nucleotide insertion at
position 531 is a sequencing artifact because it is not present in all ESTs
from the Biomphalaria genus that contain this region) and mtDNA
sequence from the same species (NC_005439); C) ESTs sequences from
Phlebotomus perniciosus (Insecta, EST1: GW817739.1, EST2: GW816615.1,
EST3: GW819720.1; for this last sequence, the 3’ end has been removed
because it apparently corresponds to a cloning artifact) and mtDNA
sequence from Anopheles darlingi (NC_014275); D) ESTs sequences from
Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (Muridae, BF784456.1 and
