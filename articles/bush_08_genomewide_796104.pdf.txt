Abstract
Background: A major goal in the study of human evolution is to identify key genetic changes
which occurred over the course of primate evolution. According to one school of thought, many
such changes are likely to be found in noncoding sequence. An approach to identifying these
involves comparing multiple genomes to identify conserved regions with an accelerated
substitution rate in a particular lineage. Such acceleration could be the result of positive selection.
Results: Here we develop a likelihood ratio test method to identify such regions. We apply it not
only to the human terminal lineage, as has been done in previous studies, but also to a number of
other branches in the primate tree. We present the top scoring elements, and compare our results
with previous studies. We also present resequencing data from one particular element accelerated
on the human lineage. These data indicate that the element lies in a region of low polymorphism in
humans, consistent with the possibility of a recent selective sweep. They also show that the AT to
GC bias for polymorphism in this region differs dramatically from that for substitutions.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that screens of this type will be helpful in unraveling the complex
set of changes which occurred during primate evolution.

Background
Humans possess numerous behaviors absent in other animals. Such behavioral specializations reflect anatomical,
physiological and ultimately genetic modifications which
occurred during the course of primate evolution.
The nature of the underlying genetic changes has long
interested scientists. According to one influential viewpoint, key genetic differences in primate evolution
resulted from changes in the regulation of gene expression
[1]. Until recently however, there have been few examples
of functionally significant cis-regulatory changes in the
human lineage. This is beginning to change with the

recent identification of several such cases. These include
changes which occurred in a cis regulatory element of the
PDYN gene in the lineage leading to humans [2], and
changes in cis-regulatory elements of the LCT gene which
lead to adult lactase persistence in a number of human
populations [3,4].
Whole genome sequencing efforts may now allow us to
identify more such cases. Several recent studies have used
genome-wide screens to identify noncoding elements
which may have been subject to positive selection in
human evolution [5-7]. The basic approach is to look for
genomic regions where the human branch contains a surPage 1 of 10

prisingly large number of substitutions-that is regions
which have an accelerated substitution rate in the human
lineage. Pollard et al. used a likelihood ratio test approach
that compared the branch lengths for each element with
what would be expected given a genome wide model for
conserved elements rescaled to the conservation level of
the given element [5,6]. Prabhakar et al. developed a different method which incorporated variation in the neutral
rate among lineages and loci into its estimation of acceleration [7]. In both cases the main focus was the human
terminal lineage after its divergence from chimpanzee.
Here we present a new likelihood ratio test method for
identifying acceleration in noncoding elements. Our
approach is designed to account for lineage specific variation in mutation rates. We apply it not only to the human
terminal lineage, as was done in previous studies, but also
to other branches of the primate tree [8]. We identify lists
of elements which have been accelerated in these
branches, and in addition we report a follow up resequencing study on one of the elements we identified. In it

Results and Discussion
We began with a genome wide set of conserved elements,
the Phastcons elements [9]. We obtained these for the
March 2006 release of the human genome and subjected
them to a variety of filters to eliminate coding sequence,
potential mis-alignments, and regions of low sequence
quality (see Methods). We were left with 169,447 elements. These had a median length of 103 bp, and 1st and
third quartiles of 73 and 161 bp respectively. For this set
we obtained Multiz multiple alignments for 6 eutherian
mammal species: human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse,
rat and dog [10]. We then used likelihood ratio tests to
search these alignments for elements with an accelerated
substitution rate in a particular lineage. Figure 1a gives an
illustration of the phylogenetic tree for our species. In the
description to follow we will refer to the various internal
branches as they are labeled in Fig. 1a. We will call the
human lineage after the divergence of chimpanzee the

human terminal lineage, and the human lineage after the
divergence of macaque (e.g the human terminal lineage
plus internal branch 1) the long human lineage. In our
description of our method below, we use the human terminal lineage as an example. However we applied this
method also to the long human lineage and to internal
branch 2.
Our goal was to identify elements which have undergone
acceleration due to changes in selective pressure. To distinguish changes in selection from changes in mutation
rate we compared the rate of molecular evolution in a
given element with the rate in nearby ancestral repeats.
For each element we examined, we obtained ancestral
repeats in a 750 kb window surrounding (Figure 1b).
Ancestral repeats represent sequence that is likely to be
nearly neutral, and therefore allowed us to approximate
the local mutation rate.
We then calculated the likelihood of the alignment for
each element and its associated repeat alignments jointly
under a constrained model, and then separately under an
unconstrained model (Figure 1c and Methods). The
unconstrained model is the same as the constrained with
the addition of an extra variable which allows the human
terminal branch to grow more rapidly. The likelihood
ratio test (LRT) statistic is based on the ratio of these likelihoods, and will be larger in cases where the ratio
between the human branch of the element and the
human branch of the nearby repeats is significantly
greater than the genome wide average. To assess the significance of these LRTs we used a nonparametric bootstrap
method to calculate false discovery rates (FDR) for our
data [11] (Methods).
Additional File 1 contains the 63 elements in our 10%
FDR group for the human terminal lineage along with the
trees calculated for each element, and for nearby repeats.
(The file also contains the 10% FDR groups for for the
long human lineage, and for internal branch 2.) These elements, which are generally very conserved among vertebrates, are changing extremely rapidly on the human
terminal lineage. In all cases the estimated human branch
length of the conserved element is greater than the local
neutral branch length as estimated by our ancestral repeat
tree. For the top 10 it is roughly an order of magnitude
larger.
We wish to understand the genomic processes which produced these elements. To do so it is important to examine
them carefully for biases in features such as their pattern
of substitutions or physical positioning. Such biases can
provide clues as to what forces produced them. We examined the position of our elements relative to Ensembl gene
annotations and found that the accelerated group for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/17

long human branch was enriched near gene deserts
(defined as a region > 500 kb without an Ensembl gene).
34% of our starting set of 169,447 elements fall in or adjacent to a gene desert. In comparison for the accelerated
group on the long human branch, the proportion is 49%
(Fisher's exact test p = 0.008181). For internal branch 2
and the terminal human branch this trend is not significant after we consider multiple testing.
In an earlier study, Pollard et al. found that in the 202
accelerated elements they identified on the human terminal branch there was a substitution bias from AT to GC.
AT to GC substitutions constituted 57% of their total,
while GC to AT were 29%. They suggested that biased
gene conversion might contribute to this, an idea that was
supported by the fact that their human accelerated elements were enriched in the terminal band of chromosomes. These regions tend to have a higher recombination
rate, and are therefore a likely site of biased gene conversion [6]. It is interesting to ask if these patterns are also
true for our group of accelerated elements. We counted AT
to GC and GC to AT substitutions, omitting cases where
the mutation occurred at a hypermutable CG dinucleotide. We found that in our human terminal group the
bias to GC is weaker: 51% of substitutions are AT to GC
while 31% are GC to AT. This ratio is not significantly different than what we find in the whole set of 169,447 elements which we screened. In the long human lineage
group the proportion of AT to GC substitutions is 45%,
which is less than that found in the whole set of elements.
The same is true for the other primate lineage FDR groups.
We should note that though we don't see a significant
trend toward bias in the groups of elements we look at,
certain individual elements do seem to show a strong
trend. We will discuss one of these below. And we do find
some tendency for our accelerated elements to be located
in the final band of chromosomes. Our 10% FDR groups
for the long human lineage, and for the terminal human
lineage both have a higher proportion of elements in the
final band of chromosomes than does the complete set of
elements we screened (fisher exact test p = 0.005 and p =
0.15 respectively).
The fact that our 10% FDR lists are not strongly biased
toward GC is an indication that our method is selecting
for a slightly different population of elements than is the
method of Pollard et al. We examined the extent to which
our results for the human terminal lineage overlap with
those of their study, and another by Prabhakar et al. [6,7].
This is illustrated as a Venn diagram in Figure 2. It is striking that the results from the three studies have relatively
little overlap. The majority of elements found by each
study are unique to that study. This is true despite the fact
that they used the same set of multiple alignments. These
studies each have various methodological details which

are unique. For example a feature unique to our study is
the use of ancestral repeats to approximate the local mutation rate. The studies also vary in the level of conservation
of the initial set of elements-Pollard et al. started with a
smaller and more conserved set than we did. Clearly differences such as these have important effects. And clearly
future refinements will be needed. The key to improving
these screens will be studying their results in more detail,
especially in the wet lab. This can provide independent
evidence to help identify elements which have truly
undergone positive selection.
In fact, screens of this type are by nature only a first step.
They provide a list of candidate elements which can then
be subjected to further experiments. This is so because various confounding factors can lead to spurious hits. For
example, if an element becomes nonfunctional in the
human lineage, this will lead to relaxation of constraint
and a higher substitution rate. Accelerations of this type
should be less dramatic than those caused by positive
selection, but may nevertheless slip into our lists. The best
way to think about these lists, is that they are likely to be
enriched for cases of positive selection. But in any individual case, we must take the element and try to find additional evidence.
We now briefly examine several individual elements, with
an emphasis on those near genes involved in brain devel-

opment. The second element in the human terminal 10%
FDR group is 155 bp long, conserved to Xenopus, and
located at the distal end of the long arm of human chromosome 2. The ratio between its terminal human branch
length (0.050) and the human branch of nearby ancestral
repeats (0.0051) is about 10, which is dramatically larger
than the genome wide average of 0.68. This difference is
reflected in an LRT of 28.0, which is greater than any LRT
in the nonparametric bootstrap set for this branch. This
element also has the distinction of being the only one
found in all three studies in Figure 2 (it is HAR2 in Pollard
et al.'s naming scheme). It initially drew our attention
because it is located near genes with interesting developmental and regulatory functions. It is in an intron of the
centaurin gamma 2 gene (CENTG2), a brain expressed
gene involved in membrane trafficking and the regulation
of cGMP levels. CENTG2 belongs to a family of genes
which have expanded greatly on the terminal human lineage [12]. This element is also about 300 kb downstream
of gastrulation brain homeobox 2 (GBX2), a gene which
is involved in midbrain-hindbrain segmentation in vertebrate embryos. Figure 3 shows an alignment and UCSC
genome browser shot of this element. Using publicly
available SNP data, Pollard et al. found low levels of polymorphism in the region around this element. Their
results were suggestive of a selective sweep, but because it
was based on SNP data with potential ascertainment
biases, some questions remained.
To address this, we resequenced a 5.5 kb region around
this element in a global human diversity panel of 90 individuals (Additional File 2). We found that the human specific substitutions in the element itself are fixed in our
sample of humans. We also found that the surrounding
region has a low level of polymorphism (pi = 0.00033),
and a negative Tajima's D statistic suggesting an abundance of rare alleles (Tajima's D = -1.698, 0.05 < p < 0.10).
Levels of polymorphism increase as one moves to the
edges of the region we resequenced. In particular the 500
bp on the centromeric side of our region have a much
higher level of polymorphism. This may be due to the fact
that they overlap a recombination hotspot as defined by
LDHot method [13,14] using Hapmap [15] and Perlegen
[16] data. Excluding those 500 bp, pi in the remaining 5
kb region is 0.00017 and Tajima's D is -2.154 (p < 0.01).
Pollard and colleagues also noted that the region of low
polymorphism appears to be about 5 kb [6].
This polymorphism data is also interesting regarding the
issue of AT to GC bias. Polymorphisms have been affected
by forces such as selection and biased gene conversion
only incompletely. As such, they are more reflective of
mutation pressures than substitutions are [17]. In our
resequencing data there is a very strong GC to AT bias
(Table 1). This is strikingly different than the AT to GC

less constraint than much of the genome. However it is
worth noting that certain processes such as gene conversion may be more common in repeats, and that there may
be variation between different kinds of repeats in terms of
substitution rates. Such considerations may provide a
basis for further improvements in our method. For example we could focus on certain categories of repeats which
are known to have higher average substitution rates, or are
less subject to gene conversion.

Conclusion
bias in substitutions (fisher's exact test p = 1.101e-07).
This says that in element 2, mutational forces are strongly
tending to AT. However forces affecting substitutions,
such as selection or biased gene conversion have driven in
the other direction even more strongly. To us the fact that
this difference is so dramatic suggests the involvement of
selection, perhaps in addition to biased gene conversion.
However we cannot eliminate other possibilities. Perhaps
biased gene conversion is capable of producing such a
dramatic difference by itself [18]. Or perhaps it was acting
at this locus historically, but a recent change in recombination rate has reduced that influence. These caveats notwithstanding, we feel that overall our resequencing results
are consistent with the idea that selection was involved in
the evolution of human element 2. The region of reduced
polymorphism we observe, while not large enough to be
conclusive, is consistent with a selective sweep. One possibility would be positive selection for increased GC content in this region, perhaps related to the regulation of a
nearby gene. As Pollard et al. suggested, multiple forces
may be at work, including selection and biased gene conversion.
As a second example, we consider an accelerated element
on internal branch 2 (Figure 4). It is the 4th element in
our 10% FDR group for this branch. It is 175 bp long and
conserved to platypus. The ratio between the length of
internal branch 2 in this element (0.17) and in nearby
ancestral repeats (0.15) is 1.13, which is significantly
larger than the genome wide average of 0.22 for this
branch. This is reflected in the element's LRT of 32.6,
which is greater than any LRT in our nonparametric bootstrap set for this branch. The element is located in an
intron of the human neurotrimin (HNT) gene. HNT is an
immunoglobulin domain containing cell adhesion molecule of the IgLON family which is expressed in the fetal
brain and may be involved in controlling neurite outgrowth [19]. HNT is known to have several splice isoforms. Our element is located in an intron just after the
transcription start of one of the isoforms, and could be
involved in regulating the expression of that transcript.
For the future, we see several ways to improve our
method. Ancestral repeats are known to have relatively

We think it will be important to choose cases such as these
and obtain direct experimental evidence about their function. One can begin by using transgenics to study expression in vivo. For example, in the case of the element
located in the HNT gene we can attach the human and
mouse versions to reporter constructs. We determine if
these drive expression, and if so whether the human version's expression differs significantly from mouse. The
hope is that in some cases the results of such work will
suggest more detailed functional studies, specific to the
biology of a particular adaptation.
We are optimistic that these lists and others like them will
allow us to get a toehold in understanding the genetic
basis of key adaptations in primate evolution. In this way,
we can to begin to unravel the complex set of changes
which have occurred in the course of primate evolution.

Methods
We began with the Phastcons elements (based on the 17
way vertebrate mutliz alignments) [9,10] on the March
2006 release of the human genome. We subjected these to
a number of filters before obtaining multiple alignments
for six eutherian mammal species: human [20,21] (NCBI
build 36.1 Mar. 2006), chimpanzee [22] (build 2 Mar.
2006), macaque [12] (v1.0 Jan. 2006), mouse [23] (build
36 Feb. 2006), rat [24] (v3.4 Nov. 2004) and dog [25]
(May 2005).
We eliminated coding sequence using the UCSC genome
informatics group's table browser [26]. This step was
important because one category of spurious alignment is
the case where a pseudogene has been aligned in one or
more lineages. This situation could be mistaken for acceleration. We therefore filtered out all elements which overlapped UCSC Known genes, Refseq genes, Ensembl genes,
mRNAs and spliced ESTs using the table browser on both
the human and mouse genomes. We also eliminated elements which overlapped regions of low sequence quality
(score<40) in any of our six genomes. We found that spurious alignments often involved cases where the aligning
fragment in one of the species did not come from a syntenic genomic region relative to the aligning fragments in
other species. We therefore applied a gene synteny filter.

For each alignment, we examined the Ensembl genes
nearby the aligning fragment in each species. To pass the
filter, fragments needed to be less than three genes distant
from a homologous gene in all six genomes. Another possible source of misalignments are cases where an element
has undergone a recent duplication in one of the
genomes. To eliminate this possibility, we filtered out elements which had multiple high blat hits in any of the six
genomes. We also eliminated elements which were less
than 50 bp long, or which were not present in all six of our
species.
We obtained Multiz alignments for the 169,447 elements
passing our filters using the six way mammalian synteny
alignment available on the UCSC website [10]. In order to
keep our molecular evolutionary models simple, we eliminated alignment columns with a CpG in any of the species. We also eliminated columns containing a gap.
By intersecting a genome wide set of repeats with the six
way multiple alignments, we identified a set of repeats
which were present in the ancestor of our six mammal
species. Such elements are a good neutral proxy and we
used them to estimate the local mutation rate around a
given conserved element.
Our likelihood ratio test method is conceptually similar
to a relative ratio test [27]. It is illustrated in Figure 1. For
each element we obtained all ancestral repeats in a 750 kb
window surrounding (Figure 1b). If an element had less
than 6000 bp of repeats, we omitted it. For the whole set
the median number of repeat bases per element was
17,930. We calculated the likelihood of each element and
associated repeats jointly under a constrained model
(weighting the element and repeat bases differently in the
likelihood). We then did the same with the unconstrained
model (Figure 1c). In the constrained model we require
the rate of evolution of element and repeats to be proportional. The constant of proportionality for each branch is
determined by the genome wide proportion (Figure 1d).
To calculate it we determined the length of a particular
branch for all elements taken together, and did the same
for all repeats taken together. The ratio between these was
the constant of proportionality for a given branch. It was
necessary to calculate separate constants for each branch
because these vary from branch to branch [22,28-31]. The
constrained model also includes a tree wide scaling factor
S, which accounts for the fact that different elements have
different levels of conservation. Then for each branch we
wish to test, we also obtain the likelihood for an unconstrained model. This model allows the element to evolve
more quickly on that particular branch. From these likelihoods we calculate the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic
for this element and this branch. We implemented this
with the HYPHY package [32] using the HKY85 substitu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/17

tion model [33]. We are interested in cases where acceleration has occured in an individual element on a particular
lineage. To isolate such effects, our models are designed to
account for three other kinds of factors. Local variations in
the mutation rate are accounted for by the fact that we are
looking at the ratio between element and nearby reapeats.
These should be affected equally by such variations. Lineage specific differences in constraint which are genome
wide are accounted for by the constants of proportionality
(e.g. Khuman, Kchimp in Fig. 1C.). And element to element variations in the (tree-wide) level of conservation
are accounted for by S. differences between constrained
and unconstrained models will reflect cases where the
substitution rate in an individual element on a particular
lineage has been accelerated.
To identify significant LRT values, we need to know the
distribution of LRTs in elements which do not have a lineage and locus specific acceleration. We chose to do this
with a nonparametric bootstrap method which involved
creating pseudo elements by taking a random sample
from all element alignment columns. We obtained mock
ancestral repeats in the same manner. Both were size
matched to actual data. The element and repeat sets produced by this method are a fair approximation of the null
(no acceleration) condition. Such mock elements are
unlikely to contain a cluster of accelerated columns. Such
a cluster is what we would expect in a true accelerated element. The fact that they may contain any accelerated column by chance is conservative for our application.
Contrained and unconstrained models were constructed
in the same way as for real data. The constants of proportionality for these were created by calculating pseudo-element and pseudo-repeat branch lengths for the complete
set of each taken together. We created 3,388,940 element
repeat sets, and calculated an LRT for each. Using LRTs
from these we calculated false discovery rate groups using
the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [11].
The human samples and re-sequencing procedure are the
same as in [34]. In this case we analyzed the data with
phred, and phrap [35,36]. We called SNPs using polyphred with score set to 30 and confirmed them by eye
using consed [37,38].
