Abstract
Background: Lactobacillus reuteri harbors the genes responsible for glycerol utilization and vitamin B12 synthesis
within a genetic island phylogenetically related to gamma-Proteobacteria. Within this island, resides a gene
(lreu_1750) that based on its genomic context has been suggested to encode the regulatory protein PocR and
presumably control the expression of the neighboring loci. However, this functional assignment is not fully
supported by sequence homology, and hitherto, completely lacks experimental confirmation.
Results: In this contribution, we have overexpressed and inactivated the gene encoding the putative PocR in L.
reuteri. The comparison of these strains provided metabolic and transcriptional evidence that this regulatory protein
controls the expression of the operons encoding glycerol utilization and vitamin B12 synthesis.
Conclusions: We provide clear experimental evidence for assigning Lreu_1750 as PocR in Lactobacillus reuteri. Our
genome-wide transcriptional analysis further identifies the loci contained in the PocR regulon. The findings
reported here could be used to improve the production-yield of vitamin B12, 1,3-propanediol and reuterin, all
industrially relevant compounds.

Background
Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative lactic acid
bacterium colonizing the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract)
of various mammals, including humans [1]. It is able to
convert glycerol to 1,3-propanediol in a two-step enzymatic conversion, yielding NAD+ [2]. In the first reaction, glycerol dehydratase (EC 4.1.2.30), converts
glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde requiring the presence of vitamin B12 as a coenzyme [3]. Reuterin, a mixture of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde isomers [4], is a
potent antimicrobial, bestowing L. reuteri with an
important growth advantage over other residents of the
GI tract, such as Gram-negative enteric bacteria [5,6].
We have shown previously that L. reuteri CRL1098
encodes the complete machinery necessary for de novo

synthesis of vitamin B12 in a single chromosomal gene
cluster [7]. This cluster was shown to be very similar to
that present in various representatives of g-Proteobacteria, standing out against canonical phylogeny. Complete genome sequence analysis of the type strain of L.
reuteri revealed that the region immediately upstream of
the vitamin B12 biosynthesis cluster maintains a gene
order similar to that of Salmonella [8]. The functionality
of this upstream region was demonstrated to also match
Salmonella where the pdu gene cluster is located. The
latter encodes the assembly machinery of metabolosomes and the several subunits of a large diol dehydratase that can metabolize both glycerol and 1,2propanediol [9].
Also within this cluster resides a gene (lreu_1750) predicted to encode a 359 amino acid long putative transcription factor of the AraC type family, containing a
typical helix-turn-helix domain. Based strictly on its
conserved genomic context, this gene has been suggested to encode PocR, a regulatory protein that modulates propanediol utilization (pdu) and vitamin B 12

biosynthesis in enteric bacteria [8-10]. This functional
annotation, however, does not seem to be fully supported by sequence homology. And more importantly,
to the best of our knowledge, it completely lacks experimental confirmation.
Here we provide the first experimental evidence to
support the functional assignment of Lreu_1750. This
was achieved by overexpression and inactivation of
lreu_1750, assessing its impact on central carbon and
energy metabolism, and on reuterin and vitamin B 12
synthesis. In addition, we characterized the genomewide transcriptional response of both constructs in comparison to their parent strains leading to the

identification of the genes comprised in the PocR regulon of Lactobacillus reuteri.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of Lreu_1750

Phylogenetic comparisons between Lreu_1750 and other
PocR sequences raise serious doubts about its functional
annotation (Figure 1). When compared to the PocR found
in enteric bacteria, Lreu_1750 reveals limited amino acid
sequence identity (19.1%) and a large percentage of gaps
(40.1%). The sequence identity and percentage of gaps
(20.5% and 38.8%, respectively) of the PocR-like regulatory
proteins of other vitamin B12-producing Firmicutes, such

as Listeria monocytogenes, suggest that it is slightly more
related. The closest homolog of Lreu_1750 present in the
complete genomes available is found in L. brevis ATCC
367 (GI:116334199) with 36.1% identity and only 1.4%
gaps. L. brevis is also able to produce 1,3-propanediol [3],
but it cannot synthesize vitamin B12 [7]. The predicted
products of lreu_1750 and its homolog in L. brevis are
approximately 60 amino acid residues longer in the C-terminus in comparison to PocR from S. typhimurium LT2.
This could additionally affect its functionality and further
urges the experimental confirmation of its tentative annotation. The putative PocR of two different wild type L. reuteri strains, JCM1112 and ATCC PTA 6475, have also
been aligned and found to display 100% sequence identity
and 0% gaps (Figure 1). Subsequent experiments have
been carried out using derivatives of both strains predominantly for technical convenience. Nevertheless, this choice
is also important to further substantiate the generality of
our findings regarding the role of this PocR-like protein in
L. reuteri strains.
Physiological effects

The functional assignment of lreu_1750 was initiated by
characterizing the impacts of its overexpression on central

carbon and energy metabolism. Since functionally active
glycerol metabolizing enzymes are encoded in the vicinity
of lreu_1750, the experimental focus was on glycerol
metabolism. In the absence of glycerol, except for a slight
impairment (< 10%) of μ max (Figure 2), no metabolic
effects were observed related to the overexpression of
lreu_1750 (Figure 3, panels a. and c.). In the presence of
glycerol, however, the overexpressing strain in comparison
with JCM1112 transformed with pNZ7021 (empty plasmid), displays a drop in the final ethanol concentration
from 13.7 to 6.2 mM while acetate increased approximately 4 mM. This enhancement of the shift from ethanol
to acetate formation (p-value < 0.025, paired two-tailed ttest) is accompanied by a 22.5% increase of 1,3-propanediol production, which is produced on a 2:1 molar ratio
with acetate, assuring the regeneration of reducing equivalents (Figure 3, panels b. and d.).
Overexpressing Lreu_1750 does not lead to significant
changes (p-value = 0.07, paired two-tailed t-test) in reuterin production (Figure 4). This is not totally unexpected, since changes in the level of enzymes involved
in central carbon metabolism often do not result in
drastic changes in fluxes [11]. In contrast, the disruption
of the lreu_1750 gene leads to an abrupt decrease in

reuterin production from 25 mM in the parent strain to
undetectable levels (< 0.1 mM) in the mutant. When
this strain is complemented with a plasmid harboring
lreu_1750 under control of its native promoter
(pJKS101), reuterin production is restored to levels in
the same order of magnitude as L. reuteri 6475 (11
mM). Mostly human-derived L. reuteri strains can produce reuterin, and therefore, it is thought that this may
be important for their survival in the human GI tract
[1]. The observed reduction by more than 250-fold in
reuterin production most likely debilitates the probiotic
functionality of the PocR mutant strain [1,12]. Furthermore, it will condition the potential utilization of glycerol for the regeneration of NAD+, limiting its biomass
yield on carbon substrate [10].
The regulatory role of Lreu_1750 on vitamin B12 synthesis is clearly illustrated by the drastic inhibitory effect
that its inactivation exerts over vitamin B12 production
(Figure 5). In contrast to the parent strain, the deletion
mutant of the putative PocR did not produce detectable

levels of B 12 (6.09 and less than 0.01 μg.L -1 .OD 600 -1 ,
respectively). Furthermore, the complementation of the
mutant with pJKS101 (harboring the putative pocR) leads
to the reestablishment of B 12 production (5.36 μg.L -1 .
OD 600 -1 ). Additionally, in the strain overexpressing
Lreu_1750 (JCM1112 pNZ7748) we observe a significant
increase (p-value < 0.016, paired two-tailed t-test) of
more than 25% in vitamin B12 production in comparison
to JCM1112 transformed with the empty plasmid
(pNZ7021). This increase was obtained regardless of the
addition of glycerol, and was observed in all the media
and conditions tested including the pH-controlled batch
fermentations using CDM (data not shown).
The physiological effects observed for the overexpression
and inactivation of Lreu_1750 are all in agreement with its
functional assignment as the regulatory protein PocR.
Transcriptomic response

In order to probe the global regulatory role of the putative PocR of L. reuteri, we compared the transcriptomes

of the deficient and overexpressing strains relative to
their parent strains. Considering that (i) glycerol has
been shown to induce the expression of lreu_1750 [10],
masking the effect of its overexpression; (ii) consequently the differentiating phenotype of the PocR deficient strain can be best observed under conditions in
which its growth kinetics are hampered (such as in the
presence of glycerol - Figure 2); and (iii) there is a large
redundancy between the different transcriptome analyses carried out; most emphasis in this report has been
put on the data related to the lreu_1750 overexpression
in the absence of glycerol. The complete list of differentially regulated genes under all conditions assayed is
available in Additional file 1: Transcriptome analysis
data.
Upon overexpressing lreu_1750 only 120 genes
(approximately 6% of the genome) are differentially
regulated, of which, all but two are up-regulated. Three
functional classes were represented with 10% or more of
its members in the list of differentially expressed loci,
namely the ones related to coenzymes, secondary metabolites and energy production (Additional file 1, Table

S2). A closer inspection of the list of differentially regulated genes shows that lreu_1750 is clearly involved in
the regulation of the same processes that have been
linked to PocR in Salmonella [13]. These genes include
the pdu cluster flanking lreu_1750, encoding the several
subunits of the diol dehydratase and the metabolosomeassembly proteins [9], along with the two operons of the
B12 biosynthesis cluster [7] (Figure 6). The lack of statistical significance observed for some of the expression
data of the B12 synthesis cluster is easily explained. This
cluster is divided into two multicistronic operons with a
relatively low abundance and a remarkably large size.
This raises great technical difficulties during mRNA
purification as reported in the past [7,14].
Besides these genes stretching from lreu_1695 to
lreu_1752, which are expected to be regulated by PocR
by homology with Salmonella [2], we found two genes
(lreu_0429 and lreu_0430) predicted to be co-transcribed and annotated with unknown function in GenBank, that are up-regulated ~3.5-fold (Table 1). A closer
look at their sequence indicates that these are most
likely two subunits of an ATPase transporter [15], which

have been tentatively associated with copper transport in
ERGO [16]. We speculate that these are cobalt- rather
than copper-transporters, based on the fact that cobalt
availability is essential for the synthesis of vitamin B12.
We also found regulated a few genes related to sugar

uptake and carbon metabolism. These are presumably
related to the up-regulation of lreu_0088 (transcription
factor of LacI family), which is most likely a consequence of a slight drop in growth rate caused by the
extra burden of the lreu_1750 overexpression (Figure 2).

Annotated as hypothetical protein in GenBank and as copper-transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.3.10) in ERGO database [16].

A considerable number of enzymes involved in recombination and DNA repair were also up-regulated. This is
probably a consequence of the homologous region to
the genome of L. reuteri present in plasmid pNZ7748
(harboring lreu_1750) and not in pNZ7021 (empty vector), as previously observed [17,18].
The transcriptome studies carried out for the PocR
insertion mutant were consistent with the results
obtained through the overexpression of lreu_1750. We
mainly observed in the PocR mutant compared to the
wild-type strain, a down-regulation of the genes located
within the genetic island that comprises the pdu and
vitamin B12 operons (Additional file 1, Table S3). Again
due to the rarity and fragility of these transcripts [7,14]
only 30 out of 58 loci are differentially expressed significantly (p-value ≤ 0.05) even though the whole region,
excluding the transposase, appears co-regulated.
There is strong phylogenetic evidence supporting that
the pdu and vitamin B12 synthesis gene clusters have
been acquired by L. reuteri through distant horizontal
gene transfer [7,8]. The confinement of the PocR regulon to mostly one continuous stretch of the chromosome (Figure 6), with exception of the putative cobalt
transporter, further substantiates this hypothesis.

Conclusions
In this study, we have provided experimental evidence
that lreu_1750 encodes a PocR-like regulatory protein,
despite its lack of sequence homology to PocR from
enteric bacteria. This was achieved by overexpression
and inactivation of lreu_1750, and assessment of its
impact on central carbon and energy metabolism, and

on reuterin, 1,3-propanediol and vitamin B12 biosynthesis. In addition, we characterized the genome-wide
transcriptional response of both constructs in comparison to the wild-type leading to the identification of the
genes encompassed in the PocR-like regulon of L. reuteri. The latter were found to be similar to the ones present in some representatives of g-Proteobacteria.
Ultimately, the demonstrated stimulatory effects of PocR
on vitamin B12, 1,3-propanediol and reuterin synthesis
could be applied to improving the production yield of
these industrially relevant compounds.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis of Lreu_1750

The sequence of Lreu_1750 (GI:148544956) was entered
as a string to search for closely related homologs within
available microbial genomes using the protein-protein
BLAST algorithm [19]. Relevant sequences were
retrieved and aligned using ClustalW with default settings [20] and visualized in CLC Sequence Viewer 6.5.
Strains, plasmids, primers and cultivation conditions

The bacterial strains, plasmids and primers used in this
study are listed in Table 2. L. reuteri strains were cultivated at 37°C in undefined MRS broth [21], in Vitamin
B 12 assay medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The
Netherlands) enriched with 0.5% glycerol (v/v), in the
semi-defined medium LDMIIIG [12] and in a chemically
defined medium (CDM) previously used to study vitamin B12 production in L. reuteri [14]. When appropriate,
erythromycin and/or chloroamphenicol were added to a
final concentration of 10 μg/mL.

Construction of putative pocR overexpression and
deletion mutants

Gene lreu_1750, encoding the putative PocR in
JCM1112T, was overexpressed constitutively under control of the pepN promoter in a similar fashion as previously described [22]. A fragment containing lreu_1750
was amplified from chromosomal DNA of L. reuteri
using Herculase II DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La
Jolla, USA), and primers P180 and P181 (Table 2). After
digestion with KpnI, the modified amplicon was purified
and cloned in pNZ7021 making use of the KpnI and
PmlI restriction sites directly downstream of the pepN
promoter. The resulting plasmid, termed pNZ7748, was
used directly from the ligation reactions to transform

Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 by electroporation [23]. Subsequently, pNZ7748 was purified from Lc. lactis as previously described [24] and, after confirming the
sequence of the insert using both P181 and P182, it was
used to transform L. reuteri also by electroporation [25].
The disruption of the putative pocR gene was carried
out in L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475, which shares an
identical sequence with the type strain (JCM1112) for
this region of the chromosome [1]. This was achieved
by site-specific integration of plasmid pORIpocR as
described previously [26] using the temperature-sensitive
plasmid pVE6007 [27] as the helper plasmid. The internal fragment of the target gene was amplified by PCR
using primers LR0062F-BHI and LR0062R-ERI (Table

Santos et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:55
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/55

2), and inserted into pORI28 by directional cloning
using standard techniques [24]. The resulting insertion
mutant was designated 6475::pocR.
Complementation of L. reuteri 6475::pocR

An E. coli-L. reuteri shuttle vector (pJKS100) was constructed by combining an L. reuteri replicon from pLEM5
[28], the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CmR) from
pVE6007 [27], the L. lactis promoter (P23) [29], and the
pUC origin and multiple cloning site (MCS) from pCR®2.1
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each fragment was PCR amplified from their respective template, restriction enzyme
digested and subsequently ligated to generate the final shuttle-vector, pJKS100. To create the complementation vector
for 6475::pocR, the L. reuteri 6475 pocR gene with its natural promoter was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA
using LR0062 FL F and LR0062 FL R primers and cloned
into pJKS100 using standard techniques [24]. Both constructs, pJKS100 and pJKS101, were electroporated seperately into L. reuteri 6475::pocR as previously described [25].
Fermentation conditions and substrate and product
analysis

The physiological effects of the overexpression of
lreu_1750 were studied in pH-controlled batch cultivations of L. reuteri pNZ7748 (lreu_1750 overexpression)
and L. reuteri pNZ7021 (empty plasmid) in CDM in the
presence or absence of glycerol carried out as described
previously [14]. At different time points, samples were
taken for transcriptome, supernatant and vitamin B 12
analysis (Figure 2). We determined the extracellular
concentration of main fermentation substrates and products by HPLC, as described elsewhere [6,30].
The comparison between the insertion mutant, 6475::
pocR, and its parent strain was established in batch fermentations of LDMIIIG or MRS carried out in an anaerobic chamber (80% N 2 , 10% H 2 , and 10% CO 2 ;
Microbiology International). Transcriptome comparisons
were carried out at the end of the fermentation when
biomass concentration became stable.
Vitamin B12 and reuterin determination

Vitamin B12 levels were determined as described in the
Official methods of analysis of AOAC International [31],
using a bioassay with L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC
7830 as the indicator strain. Reuterin production was
measured with a bioassay and carried out as previously
described [5].

plasmid) were compared using cDNA microarrays as
previously detailed [14] using a hybridization scheme
comprising 17 arrays in a loop-design. The following
samples were hybridized per array labeled with cyanine3
and cyanine5, respectively: sta-F6 and sta-F5, sta-F7 and
sta-F8, sta-F5 and sta-F7, sta-F8 and sta-F6, sta-F3 and
sta-F4, sta-F1 and sta-F3, sta-F2 and sta-F1, sta-F4 and
sta-F2, exp-F3 and exp-F4, exp-F1 and exp-F3, exp-F2
and exp-F1, exp-F4 and exp-F2, exp-F4 and sta-F4, staF3 and exp-F3, sta-F2 and sta-F8, sta-F4 and sta-F6,
exp-F2 and sta-F2. Here, F1 and F5 represent completely independent biological duplicates of L. reuteri
pNZ7021 cultured in the absence of glycerol; F2 and F6
represent completely independent biological duplicates
of L. reuteri pNZ7748 cultured in the absence of glycerol; F3 and F7 represent completely independent biological duplicates of L. reuteri pNZ7021 cultured in the
presence of glycerol; and F4 and F8 represent completely independent biological duplicates of L. reuteri
pNZ7748 cultured in the presence of glycerol. The prefix exp- and sta- stand for cells harvested at mid-logarithmic and early-stationary growth phases, respectively.
The custom probe design of the Agilent 11 K microarray platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) used is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo under accession number GPL6856, and the data obtained were deposited in
the same repository under accession number GSE13289.
- Transcriptional analysis of the putative PocR insertion
mutant

The transcriptome of the insertion mutant, 6475::pocR,
and its parent strain were compared using two-color
microarrays as previously detailed [32]. Briefly, oligonucleotides (60-mers) were designed and synthesized for
1,966 open reading frames from a draft genome
sequence of L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 [1]. For expression analyses, three biological replicates of the insertion
mutant and parent strain were compared. Moreover,
dye-swap hybridization was performed for each comparison. Following mRNA isolation [32], cDNA synthesis,
labeling, and hybridization were performed as previously
described [32]. Information regarding the microarray
platform and data obtained is deposited at NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo) under GPL7541 and GSE22926, respectively.
GenePix Pro 4.0.12 software was utilized for image
analysis of the 6475 microarrays. Normalization within
arrays and between arrays was performed by applying
the Loess algorithm [33] using the Limma package [34]
in R http://www.r-project.org. Normalized intensities
were used for further analysis. The average signal intensities of three biological replicates were calculated in
order to compare the relative gene expression of mutant
and wild type strains. The statistical significance of

Santos et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:55

differences was calculated based on variation in biological duplicates, using the eBayes function in Limma
(cross-probe variance estimation) and false discovery
rate (FDR) adjustment of the p-values. Only genes that
were differentially expressed by least 1.5-fold with FDRadjusted p-values lower than 0.05 were considered
significant.
