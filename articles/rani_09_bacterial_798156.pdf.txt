Abstract
Background: Mosquitoes are intermediate hosts for numerous disease causing organisms. Vector control is one of the
most investigated strategy for the suppression of mosquito-borne diseases. Anopheles stephensi is one of the vectors of
malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The parasite undergoes major developmental and maturation steps within the
mosquito midgut and little is known about Anopheles-associated midgut microbiota. Identification and characterization of
the mosquito midgut flora is likely to contribute towards better understanding of mosquito biology including longevity,
reproduction and mosquito-pathogen interactions that are important to evolve strategies for vector control
mechanisms.
Results: Lab-reared and field-collected A. stephensi male, female and larvae were screened by "culture-dependent and
culture-independent" methods. Five 16S rRNA gene library were constructed form lab and field-caught A. stephensi
mosquitoes and a total of 115 culturable isolates from both samples were analyzed further. Altogether, 68 genera were
identified from midgut of adult and larval A. stephensi, 53 from field-caught and 15 from lab-reared mosquitoes. A total
of 171 and 44 distinct phylotypes having 85 to 99% similarity with the closest database matches were detected among
field and lab-reared A. stephensi midgut, respectively. These OTUs had a Shannon diversity index value of 1.74–2.14 for
lab-reared and in the range of 2.75–3.49 for field-caught A. stephensi mosquitoes. The high species evenness values of 0.93
to 0.99 in field-collected adult and larvae midgut flora indicated the vastness of microbial diversity retrieved by these
approaches. The dominant bacteria in field-caught adult male A. stephensi were uncultured Paenibacillaceae while in female
and in larvae it was Serratia marcescens, on the other hand in lab-reared mosquitoes, Serratia marcescens and
Cryseobacterium meninqosepticum bacteria were found to be abundant.
Conclusion: More than fifty percent of the phylotypes were related to uncultured class of bacteria. Interestingly, several
of the bacteria identified are related to the known symbionts in other insects. Few of the isolates identified in our study
are found to be novel species within the gammaproteobacteria which could not be phylogenetically placed within known
classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the midgut microbiota of A. stephensi from labreared and field-collected adult and larvae using "culture-dependent and independent methods".

Background
Mosquitoes are transmitters of several serious human diseases including malaria. Anophelines are the only transmitters of malaria. Anopheles stephensi is the main vector in
urban India, where 70% of world-wide malaria related
cases occur. During the development and maturation of
parasite in vector the midgut of the female Anopheles is a
major site of interaction. Interruption of parasite development in mosquitoes remains the enticing strategy for the
control of mosquito-borne diseases. The malaria parasite
development involves critical steps within the mosquito
midgut, an environment it shares with gut-residing bacteria. The occurrence of apparent 'symbiotic' association
between Anopheles mosquitoes and bacterial species has
not been much evaluated.
A possible approach to restrict malaria parasite transmission is to manipulate the mosquito functional genome,
one possible approach is to employ normal bacterial symbionts of the mosquito gut to block development cycle in
the vector. Gut microbes have been described to be
involved in supporting normal growth and development
of Drosophila. There have been conflicting reports regarding the role of microbes in the fitness of the vector. Hedges
et al. (2008) described that Drosophila melanogaster flies
infected with a common bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia display reduced mortality induced by a range of
RNA viruses and bacterial presence provides a fitness
advantage to flies. The study highlighted the notion that
the native microbes are symbionts that modulate immune
responses [1]. On the other hand, Wolbachia pipientis
wMelPop strain presence in dengue vector Aedes aegypti,
reduced the life span of vector to half the normal adult life
span. Nevertheless, it is becoming abundantly clear that
endosymbiont microbes have a profound influence on
the vector persistence and competence in nature [2].
Mosquito midgut is an immune-competent organ. Plasmodium presence in gut is known to induce immune
responses elsewhere in body, probably due to immunesignaling [3,4]. The intensively investigated question is
whether mosquito midgut resident endosymbiont contribute towards elicitation of immune response of host to
Plasmodium invasion? If they do indeed contribute
towards facilitation of Plasmodium development in mosquito, the second important question is can these endosymbionts be used as paratransgenic to block their
development? It is coceivable that a vector endosymbiont
may be manipulated to produce antiparasitic molecules.
This vector could then reintroduced into the insect gut,
thus inhibiting parasite development [5-7]. A close relationship between gut microflora and mosquito development is exemplified during the metamorphosis of larva
into adult mosquito. During metamorphic transition

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

from larvae to adult the microflora associated with larvae
is 'cleaned' and adult mosquitoes acquire new set of
microbes. This process of microbial cleansing and acquisition is termed as gut-sterilization [8].
A few studies have been performed to identify bacterial
species in field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes, using
microbe culturing techniques. These studies highlighted
breadth of bacterial flora associated with mosquitoes. Bacteria, Pseudomonas cepacia, Enterobacter agglomerans, and
Flavobacterium spp. were found in high abundance in laboratory-reared A. stephensi, A. gambiae and A. albimanus
mosquitoes [9]. Further, the gut microflora varied
depending upon the ecological niche or geographical
location of the mosquitoes. Straif et al. (1998) identified
Pantoea agglomerans (synonym Enterobacter agglomerans)
and Escherichia coli as the most frequently isolated bacteria, from midgut of A. gambiae and A. funestus mosquitoes
caught in Kenya and Mali [10]. Jadin et al. (1966) identified Pseudomonas sp. in the midgut of mosquitoes from
the Democratic Republic of the Congo [11]. GonzalezCeron et al. (2003) isolated various Enterobacter and Serratia sp. from Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes captured in
southern Mexico [12]. Recently, field-captured A. gambiae
mosquitoes in a Kenyan village were reported to consistently associate with a Thorsellia anophelis lineage that was
also detected in the surface microlayer of rice paddies
[13]. The microbial flora associated with Anopheles darlingi, a major Neotropical malaria vector, was found to be
closely related to other vector mosquitoes, including
Aeromonas, Pantoea and Pseudomonas species. Laboratoryreared A. stephensi has been reported to stably associate
with bacteria of the genus Asaia [14]. The successful colonization of Serratia marcescens in laboratory-bred A.
stephensi has also been established [15].
However, it should be emphasized that microbial studies
of the midgut of Anopheles are scarce, and have depended
mainly on traditional culture-based techniques [9,10,12].
In A. gambiae, few studies have combined culture and
PCR-based approaches to characterize gut associated bacteria [16]. Therefore, the application of "culture-dependent and culture- independent" based tools, such as 16S
rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics, to study these
systems are highly desirable. 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and metagenomics, have been primarily responsible in
revealing the status of our lack of knowledge of microbial
world such that half of the bacterial phyla recognized so
far consist largely of these as yet uncultured bacteria [17].
It also provides, an idea of species richness (number of
16S rRNA gene fragments from a sample) and relative
abundance (structure or evenness), which reflect relative
pressure that shape diversity within biological communities [18].

There is current interest in the use of microorganisms as
biological control agents of vector-borne diseases [19-21].
Microorganisms associated with vectors could exert a
direct pathogenic effect on the host by interfering with its
reproduction or reduce vector competence [22-25]. In laboratory-raised insects, the bacteria in the midgut can be
acquired both transstadially and through contaminated
sugar solutions and bloodmeals. In wild populations,
however, the origin of the midgut bacteria, are still
unknown [9,10,26,27]. An understanding of the microbial community structure of the mosquito midgut is necessary, which will enable us to identify the organisms that
play significant roles in the maintenance of these communities. To understand the bacterial diversity and to identify bacterial candidates for a paratransgenic mosquito, we
conducted a screen for midgut bacteria from lab-reared
and wild-caught A. stephensi mosquitoes using "culturedependent and culture-independent" approach.

Results
Isolation and biochemical characterization of bacterial
isolates
Plating of the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared
and field-collected adult A. stephensi (male/female/larvae)
was used for the isolation of the culturable micro flora.
The bacterial colonies on TSA and LB agar were selected
on the basis of minor variations using conventional
microbiological techniques. The initial number of isolates
was reduced based on colony characteristics (involving
colony size, shape, color, margin, opacity, elevation, and
consistency) and the morphology of isolates studied by
Gram staining. Microbial isolates were further selected on
the basis of physiological parameters such as their sensitivity to different antibiotics (see Additional file 1). It
ensured the diversity of microbes at a preliminary level.
The abilities of these microbial isolates to solublize the
various substrates such as amylase, lipase and protease
were also quite variable, few Bacillus strains were among
the high protease producers, whereas Enterobacter sp. were
showing high lipase activity. Overall activity in all strains
was moderate, with no activity observed (zone of hydrolysis) in few of the isolates. To determine the phylogenetic
relatedness of the strains, mosquito midgut contents were
subjected to analysis with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing
using "culture-dependent and culture-independent"
approaches. Five 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed and approximately 150 sequences per library
were analyzed.
Diversity of Cultured Bacteria from lab-reared adult A.
stephensi
Out of a total of 50 screened bacterial colonies, 34 distinct
isolates, 18 from adult male and 16 from adult female labreared A. stephensi were studied further. 16S rRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

sequencing placed these two sets of 18 and 16 isolates
with their closest matches into 4 major groups. In labreared adult male A. stephensi isolates, 3 major groups
were: Cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroidetes (CFB), alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria, whereas in
lab-reared adult female betaproteobacteria was also identified (Figure 1). 16S rRNA gene sequence identified the
lab-reared adult male bacterial isolates as Agrobacterium
sp., Chryseobacterium meninqosepticum, Pseudomonas mendocina and Serratia marcescens, whereas in lab-reared A.
stephensi adult female Comamonas sp. was also present, the
details of which are shown in Table 1. In lab-reared adult
male and female A. stephensi, most abundant and diverse
members were of gammaproteobacteria (61% and 43%
respectively) particularly, Pseudomonas mendocina and S.
marcescens, as a dominant group. It was followed by CFB
group bacteria (Chryseobacterium meninqosepticum) constituting around 33% and 38% in male and female A.
stephensi, respectively. Distinctive representative genera in
lab-reared female A. stephensi was Comamonas sp. (betaproteobacterium), representing 13% of total isolates.
However, male A. stephensi isolates were distinguishable
by genera such as Agrobacterium sp., an alphaproteobacterium. Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas and Serratia were
genera common to adult male and female A. stephensi.
Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene clone library from labreared adult A. stephensi
One hundred clones were screened from each lab-reared
adult male and female A. stephensi 16S rRNA gene library,
out of which 50 clones from each were analyzed further
on the basis of sequencing results. The 16S rRNA gene
sequencing data of isolates and clones were used to divide
them into broad taxonomic groupings. The relative abundance or percent distribution of the taxonomic groups
obtained in lab-reared adult A. stephensi is shown in Figure
1. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that
the libraries were dominated by sequences related to the
genus Pseudomonas and Serratia (71% of the clones examined). The majority of the cultured isolates and the 16S
rRNA gene library clones belonged to the gammaproteobacteria class. Diversity of bacteria within the 16S rRNA
gene libraries from lab-reared male and female A. stephensi
was rather low, with relatively few phylotypes. Low bacterial diversity in Anopheles species by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing has been reported, with six, two, and one bacterial species in A. arabiensis, A. gambiae sensu stricto, and
A. funestus, respectively [16]. We detected few operational
taxonomic units (OTU) within the gammaproteobacteria
that were detected in other studies by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing and bacterial isolation [10,16]. This difference
may be due to the differences in microbial ecology which
widens the view of the actual diversity residing in a system.

Percentage
Percentage abundance diagram of culturable isolates and 16S rRNA gene library clones from lab-reared (LR)
and field-collected (FC) adult male, female and larvae of Anopheles stephensi. Percentage distribution was calculated
on the basis of relative abundance in the total PCR amplification.

A total of 12 genera were identified, 7 from the lab-reared
adult male and 5 from adult female A. stephensi 16S rRNA
library and used to assign each of the clones to taxonomic
groups (Table 1). Cloning revealed that almost 50% of the
sequences obtained in both the libraries were related to
known bacteria, which fall within defined groups (bacteria/species). It can be seen that there are not much of the
differences between isolates and the 16S rRNA gene
library from lab- reared adult A. stephensi in the relative
abundance of the different taxonomic groups. These
appeared to reflect that except few isolates, microbial flora
present in adult mosquitoes was more or less similar.
Bacterial Community Structure
We grouped 16S rRNA gene sequences with its nearest
neighbors (clone clusters) as shown by BLASTn search
and clone clusters are comprised of one or more phylotypes. Sequences with more than 97% similarity were considered to be of the same OTUs. The frequencies of the
OTUs obtained are shown in Table 1. A total of 22 phylotypes were observed, 15 from lab-reared male and 7 from
female A. stephensi 16S rRNA library. Whereas, by culturable methods 22 phylotypes were detected, 11 each from
lab-reared male and female A. stephensi.

The most abundant phylotypes (71% in male, 37% in
female) in the lab-reared adult A. stephensi 16S rRNA
libraries were closest matches to gammaproteobacteria
(Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas tolaasii, S. marcescens and Klebsiella sp.) and CFB (Elizabethkingia menin-

goseptica, C. meninqosepticum, 37% in male and 29% in
female mosquitoes). Almost same pattern is observed
among culturable isolates, with gammaproteobacteria
and CFB as major phylotypes detected. Elizabethkingia
meningoseptica clones were observed (less frequently) only
in adult 16S rRNA gene libraries, no culturable isolate was
identified, whereas C. meninqosepticum, was detected in
culturable as well as 16S rRNA gene clones among adult
mosquitoes.
Second major phylotypes in lab-reared male 16S rRNA
gene library belonged to alphaproteobacteria – Agrobacterium tumefaciens (13%) followed by unidentified class of
bacteria (13%), none of the alphaproteobacteria and unidentified bacterium clones were detected from female 16S
rRNA library. The degree of similarity of clone sequences
and the 16S rRNA gene sequence of its closest relative in
the database was in the range of 90–99%. The phylotypes
indicated by culture-independent methods exhibited
greater divergence and diversity than phylotypes recovered by culturing (Figure 1).

Total number of phylotypes observed:
Lab-reared adult male A. stephensi = 26
Lab-reared adult female A. stephensi = 18

sequences from a variety of phylogenetic groups are
shown in Figure 2. In field-collected male A. stephensi 3
major groups were, high G+C Gram-positive Actinobacteria, Gram-positive Firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria.
Distinctive representative genera were; Micrococcus sp.,
Staphylococcus hominis, S. saprophyticus, Acinetobacter sp., A.
lwofii, A. radioresistens, A. johnsonii, Enterobacter sp., E.
cloacae and Escherichia hermani details of which are shown
in Table 2. Sequences with more than 97% similarity were
considered to be of the same OTUs. A total of 14 distinct
phylotypes were identified from male A. stephensi. The frequencies of the OTUs obtained are shown in Table 2.
A large proportion of the isolates, 82% was identified as
gammaproteobacteria, where dominant genera were Acinetobacter, Enterobacter and Escherichia. The group of firmicutes constituted 12% of the total clones and was
moderately occupied by Staphylococcus hominis and S.
saprophyticus. High G+C Gram positive actinobacteria

(Micrococcus sp.) was represented by a single clone OTU
observed among 6% of total male isolates. It was showing
less than 85% homology to the closest database match.
Male Anopheles stephensi 16S rRNA gene library
A total of 150 clones were analyzed initially from 16S
rRNA gene library of midgut content of field-collected
male A. stephensi. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing placed
the clones with their closest matches into 4 major bacterial groups: CFB, Gram-positive firmicutes, betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria. In male A. stephensi
16S rRNA gene library, Gram-positive bacteria, especially
bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes dominated the flora.
This is not in accordance with culture-based studies made
in male A. stephensi. A total of 27 distinct phylotypes were
identified from male 16S rRNA library clones (Table 2).
The most frequently encountered sequences in this work
originated from species of the genera: Bacillus sp., Paenibacillus alginolyticus, P. chondroitinus, and Herbaspirillum sp.

These phylotypes were specific to the field-collected male
midgut flora, as none of the species were identified in rest
of the samples. Bacillus sp., P. chondroitinus, Herbaspirillum
sp., and Photorhabdus luminescens were identified as single
unique phylotypes (Table 2, Figure 3). The Good's coverage calculated for the 85 clones was 68.23% (Table 3).
In all, 64% of the clones were found to belong to firmicutes, followed by 28% from unclassified class of bacteria
(mainly uncultured Flexibacteriaceae and uncultured
Paenibacillaceae) were also identified. CFB, betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria, each constituted 1% of

the total clones (Figure 1). It can be observed here that
among culturable isolates gammaproteobacteria are the
dominant group, whereas 16S rRNA gene clones were
dominated by firmicutes. Both the approaches ("culturedependent and culture-independent") have led to the
identification of more number of genera in each sample as
compared to single sample analysis.
Female Anopheles stephensi
A total of 34 distinct isolates were identified from fieldcollected female A. stephensi midgut microflora. On the
basis of phylogenetic tree 16S rRNA gene sequences were

found to belong to major two bacterial phyla, gammaproteobacteria and CFB (Figure 4). The majority of the cultured isolates from field-collected and lab-reared adults
belonged to the gammaproteobacteria class. A total of 29
bacterial OTUs were detected among female A. stephensi
on the basis of 97% sequence similarity as a cut off value
(Table 2). Sequences with more than 97% similarity were

considered to be of the same OTUs. Representative genera
of gammaproteobacteria were, Acinetobacter sp., A. hemolyticus, A. radioresistens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter
sp., E. cloacae, E. sakazaki, Escherichia hermani and Enterobacteriaceae bacterium. They constituted the largest proportion of 97%, among the total diversity. Out of the 29
distinct phylotypes observed, 28 were found to belong to

The table lists the number of phylotypes, observed and estimated species richness, coverage and diversity indices for the culturables and 16S rRNA
clone libraries from lab-reared and field- collected adult and larval Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Numbers were calculated with DOTUR
program, OTUs were defined using a distance level of 3%.
The Shannon-Weiner diversity index [16] is calculated as follows:
a: S = (Phylotype richness): Total number of species in the sample.
b: H = Σ (pi) (log2 p - i), where p represents the proportion of a distinct phylotype relative to the sum of all phylotypes.
c: E = (Evenness) was calculated as follows: E = H/Hmax where Hmax = log2 (S)
C_ACE = ACE Coverage, C_Chao = Chao Coverage, C_Simpson = Simpson Coverage
Good's Coverage = [1 - (n/N)] × 100
Where n is the number of molecular species represented by one clone (single-clone OTUs) and N is the total number of sequences [54].

class gammaproteobacteria only. Only single phylotype
Chryseobacterium indologenes, from CFB was detected with
3% proportion from the total observed OTUs. None of
the member from high G+C Gram-positive actinobacteria
and Gram-positive firmicutes were observed, as in fieldcollected male A. stephensi. Similarly, none of the CFB
group phylotypes were detected in female A. stephensi. Isolates belonging to genus Acinetobacter sp., A. radioresistens,
Enterobacter sp., E. cloacae and Escherichia hermani were
commonly observed in both male as well as female fieldcollected A. stephensi. These results are quite different from
the data what we have observed in lab-reared adult A.
stephensi (Figure 1).
Female Anopheles stephensi 16S rRNA gene library
A total of 100 clones were found positive for the insert
and were partially sequenced. Of these, three were shown
to be chimeras and were therefore not included for further
analysis. The phylogenetic analysis of the remaining
clones was done using partial 16S rRNA gene aligned
homologous nucleotide sequences (Figure 5). The per-

centage distribution of the clones from the 16S rRNA gene
library representing the microbiota of female A. stephensi
midgut was determined (Table 2, Figure 1) On the basis of
sequence similarity to the existing GenBank database
entries, the clones were clustered together to form four
major groups: Gram positive firmicutes, betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria and the unidentified and
uncultured bacteria group. The last group included all the
uncharacterized and as yet uncultured bacteria. Thirty six
distinct phylotypes were observed from female A. stephensi
midgut 16S rRNA gene library.
In accordance with culturable isolates, 16S rRNA libraries
were also dominated by gammaproteobacteria, constituting 86% of the total clones analyzed. Representative genera were: Acinetobacter sp., A. hemolyticus, uncultured
Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas putida, P. synxantha, uncultured Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, S. nematodiphila, S. proteamaculans, Xenorhabdus nematodiphila,
Leminorella grimontii, uncultured gamma proteobacteria
and Enterobacteriaceae bacterium.

Unclassified group represented 12% of the total clones
(90–98% similarity to closest database matches) whereas
Gram-positive firmicute (Leuconostoc citreum) and betaproteobacteria (Achromobacter xylosoxidans) contributed
1% each to the total number of clones analyzed. Leuconostoc citreum is one of the most prevalent lactic acid bacteria,
in a best-known Korean traditional dish. It can suppress
the growth of pathogenic microorganisms such as B.
cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Its com-

plete genome sequence may provide us with scientific
insights into the probiotic effects of L. citreum and may
lead to new biotechnological applications along with its
significance inside mosquito midgut.
It is interesting to observe here that many of the single
clone OTUs such as Leuconostoc citreum, Achromobacter
xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas synxantha, S. nematodiphila, S.
proteamaculans, Xenorhabdus nematodiphila and Leminorella
grimontii were particularly present in female A. stephensi

Anopheles stephensi Larvae
Five major phyla, CFB, Gram-positive firmicutes, gammaproteobacteria, Deinococcus-thermus and unidentified
class of bacteria were identified from 30 isolates of fieldcollected A. stephensi Larvae. A total of 29 phylotypes were
observed with 97% similarity values as cut off. The 16S
rRNA gene sequences from a variety of phylogenetic
groups are shown in Figure 6. The majority of the cultured

isolates (63%) from field-collected A. stephensi larvae were
found to belonging gammaproteobacteria class. Distinct
genera were Acinetobacter venetianus, Aeromonas sobria, A.
popoffii, Pseudomonas anquilliseptica, uncultured pseudoxanthomonas, Thorsellia anopheles and Vibrio chlorae. Grampositive firmicutes represented second abundant phylotypes (20% of the isolates) containing Bacillus sp., B.

constituted an equal proportion of 7%. The degree of similarity of isolates and the 16S rRNA gene sequence of its

closest relative in the database was in the range of 85–
99%. Uncultured class of bacterial sequences obtained
was related to unknown, possibly novel bacteria, which
did not fall within defined groups (new bacteria/species).
A single OTU was observed from Deinococcus xinjiangensis
(Table 2).

It can be observed here that the majority of the cultured
isolates from field-collected adults and larvae belonged to
the gammaproteobacteria class with Acinetobacter as a
common and dominant genus. Most of the sequence
types were specific to larval samples only, such as Aeromonas sobria, A. popoffii, Pseudomonas anquilliseptica, unculPage 13 of 22

tured Pseudoxanthomonas, Thorsellia anopheles and Vibrio
chlorae. Bacillus firmus, Exiguobacterium sp. and Deinococcus
xinjiangensis were not detected in either male or female
midgut bacterial flora.
16S rRNA gene library analysis from Anopheles stephensi
larvae
More than 100 clones were found positive for the insert
and were partially sequenced, 80 of which were found to
contain the amplified 16S rRNA gene. Of these, four
sequences were shown to be chimeras, which were therefore not included for further analysis. The percentage distribution of the clones from the 16S rRNA gene library
representing the microbiota of the midgut of A. stephensi
larvae was determined (Table 2, Figure 7). The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene placed the 16S rRNA
gene library clones from field-collected A. stephensi larvae
sample into 8 major groups, belonging to 19 different
genera (Table 2). These groups were: Cyanobacteria,
Actinobacteria, CFB group bacteria, Gram-positive Firmicutes, betaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, Deinococcus xinjiangensis, and the unidentified and uncultured
bacteria group. Larval midgut microbial flora was the
found to be most diverse as compared to adult mosquito
midgut diversity. Cloning revealed that almost 50% of the
sequences obtained in library were not related to the
known bacteria. Since the percent similarity with the
reported closest database matches are less than 97%, these
may be categorized among the new bacteria/species. A
total of 36 phylotypes were observed from 16S rRNA
library based on their less than 97% similarity.

The most abundant phylotypes were closest matches to
gammaproteobacteria, constituting 65% of the clones.
Distinct genera were Enterobacter aerogenes, Ignatzschineria
larvae sp., uncultured Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., uncultured Serratia sp., S. marcescens, S. nematodiphila and
Thorsellia anopheles. Gram-positive firmicutes contributed
14% of distinct phylotypes from groups of Staphylococcus
cohnii, Streptococcus suis, uncultured B. thermoamylovorans
and uncultured Lactobacillus sp. The inability to detect
Bacillus sp. in clone libraries despite their presence on
plates was observed among larvae samples. 11% of the
clones were found to belong to betaproteobacteria,
mainly Azoarcus sp., Leptothrix sp. and uncultured Hydroxenophaga sp. Deinococcus xinjiangensis was identified as single clone OTUs among 6% of the clones. Cyanobacteria,
Actinobacteria, CFB group and uncultured class of clones
represented 1% of the single clone OTUs as Calothrix sp.,
Brevibacterium paucivorans, uncultured Dysqonomona sp.
and uncultured bacterium (Figure 1). The degree of similarity of clone sequences and the 16S rRNA gene sequence
of its closest match in the database were in the range of
85–98%. It was very interesting to observe that the individual libraries harbored many sequence types unique to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

that library and sample, so the even single data set provides a better estimate of the total diversity in all the samples. Among the lab-reared and field-caught mosquito
midgut bacteria Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas and Serratia sp. were found to be overlapping in adult female and
larval mosquitoes, whereas no genera were found to be
overlapping in adult male A. stephensi.
Uncultured groups and "Novel" lineages
Results of Jukes-Cantor evolutionary distance matrix suggested that the vast majority of the sequences were different strains of known and unknown species and may
represent new species within the genus of different phylum. Many 16S rRNA gene sequences from field-collected
male A. stephensi (M1, M6, M10, M16) (Figure 2) and
many clusters of different phylotypes in female A.
stephensi, such as F31, F33, F34, F36, F37 (Figure 4) were
very distinct from those of cultured organisms present in
the NCBI database. Larval A. stephensi sequences (L12,
L15, L18, L19, L20, L24, L29 and L39, Figure. 6) were also
found to be deep branching in tree with low bootstrap values, which suggests a high genetic diversity. These did not
appear to fall within defined groups and subgroups and
may represent "novel" species. Many of such novel isolates have been reported earlier by 16S rRNA gene-based
identification of midgut bacteria from field-caught A.
gambiae and A. funestus mosquitoes which have revealed
new species related to known insect symbionts [16]. Further characterizations of these isolates are in progress. Few
of them could be identified only to the family level
(Enterobacteriaceae, Paenibacillaceae and Flexibacteriaceae)
(Table 2). The family Enterobacteriaceae contains various
species previously described as insect symbionts in mosquito midgut screens [9,10,28-30]. From this study it is
proposed that environmental conditions (for example,
laboratory and field) provide a specific ecological niche
for prolonging survival of diverse and "novel" microbial
species.
Diversity Index Analysis
Diversity index quantifies diversity in a community and
describe its numerical structure. The analysis indicated
that most of the bacterial diversity has been sufficiently
covered (Table 3). Shannon Weaver diversity index (H)
for culturable isolates of lab-reared male and female A.
stephensi were 1.74 and 1.84 and for uncultivable clones
was calculated to be 2.14 and 1.97 respectively. Species
evenness (E) for the culturables from lab-reared male and
female A. stephensi were 0.89 and 0.94 and for unculturable flora was 0.89 and 0.70 respectively.

These index values varied significantly in field-collected
male and female A. stephensi. Shannon's diversity index
(H) for culturable diversity of field-collected male and
female A. stephensi was 2.75 and 2.93 and for uncultivable

diversity was calculated to be 2.93 and 3.15 respectively.
Species evenness (E) for the culturable isolates from fieldcollected male and female A. stephensi were 0.89 and 0.94
and for unculturable diversity were 0.89 and 0.70 respectively.
Shannon's index (H) and species evenness values were
observed to be comparatively higher for field-collected A.
stephensi larvae (3.21 for culturable subset and 3.49 for
16S rRNA library clones). Species evenness (E) for the cul-

turable isolates from field-collected A. stephensi larvae was
0.98 and for unculturable diversity was estimated to be
0.99. In a recent study on bacterial diversity in the midgut
of field-collected adult A. gambiae as measured by the
Shannon- Weaver diversity index, (H) ranged from 2.48
to 2.72, which was slightly higher than those observed for
bulk water (1.32–2.42). Bacterial diversity indices in all
midgut samples were within the range of H values
observed for water (larvae, H = 2.26–2.63; adults, H =
2.16–2.52) [13]. These values indicate that the diversity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

and evenness are quite higher in our samples. The evenness and dominance values approximate to the maximum
possible values, as most of the sequence types were recovered only once. The sample coverage using Good's
method for the male, female and larvae (individual 16S
rRNA gene libraries) ranged from 38 to 71%.

uncultured Paenibacillaceae family bacteria, while in larvae
and female mosquitoes the dominant bacteria was Serratia marcescens. In lab-reared adult male and female A.
stephensi bacteria, Serratia marcescens (61 to 71% of isolates/clones) and Cryseobacterium meninqosepticum (29 to
33% of isolates/clones) were found to be abundant.

Thus, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices suggested
higher diversity in the field- collected adult male, female
and larval midgut flora than the lab-reared adult male and
female A. stephensi. The Shannon index gives more weight
to the rare species and Simpson to the dominant [31], but
in this case they were quite concordant. The ACE and
Chao estimators did not agree with Shannon and Simpson in all cases. The Chao estimator takes into account
only singletons and doubletons, ACE uses OTUs having
one to ten clones each [31,32]. The ACE and especially
Chao are dependent of the amount of singletons and the
discrepancies with the diversity indices are most probably
due to different amounts of singletons in the libraries.
Higher coverage's have been reported with libraries from
human sources, (as high as 99%) which may be due to the
larger number of sequenced clones in these studies
[33,34].

Almost 50% isolates and 16S rRNA gene clones identified
from field-collected adult and larvae A. stephensi, displayed 16S rRNA gene similarity to unidentified bacterium clones in public databases (NCBI, RDP-II). 16S
rRNA gene sequences of majority of these isolates and
clones displayed sequence similarities to cultured or the
uncultured bacteria of gammaproteobacteria group.
Recovery of many isolates and 16S rRNA clones belonging
to the genus Acinetobacter, from field-collected adult male,
female and larvae of A. stephensi indicate that gammaproteobacteria may form a significant proportion of the A.
stephensi midgut microbiota. The presence of Exiguobacterium sp. bacterium related to activated sludge treatment
probably reflects the ecological niche of larvae and the
metabolic diversity of gammaproteobacteria and other
bacterial groups [35-38]. A careful comparative analysis of
breadth of diversity of microbes reported from other mosquito species reveals preponderance of bacteria, Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas in adult
A. stephensi midgut flora. These bacterial species have also
been identified from the midgut of other Anopheles sp.,
[28,39-41] suggesting that at least a fraction of mosquito
midgut inhabitants could be common for different mosquito species inhabiting the similar environment and may
represent evolutionary conservation of association of gut
vector biology.

In lab-reared and field-collected adult and larval midgut
flora of A. stephensi investigated in this work, the estimated OTU number was 215 using 97% sequence identity
as the criterion in DOTUR, using the pooled sequence
data from all isolates and clones. The ACE estimate for the
individual libraries varied from 50 to 173 (Table 3). The
individual libraries harbored many sequence types
unique to that library, such that, even pooled data set provides a better estimate of the total diversity. Rarefaction
curve analyses (Figure 8) revealed that field-collected A.
stephensi male, female and larvae midgut microbial flora
("cultured and uncultured microbes") consist of a vast
diversity. In clone libraries, with increasing numbers of
sequences, the number of OTUs increases, until saturation
is reached. In order to cover total diversity a large number
of sequences need to be sampled. However, the present
analysis indicates that it is more or less sufficient to give
an overview of dominating microbial communities for
these two, lab-reared and field- collected environments.

We have identified the richness and diversity of microbes
associated with lab-reared and field- collected mosquito,
A. stephensi. Malaria transmitting vector A. stephensi occupies several ecological niches and is very successful in
transmitting the parasite. Characterization of gut micobes
by "culture-dependent and culture-independent" methods led to the identification of 115 culturable isolates and
271 distinct clones (16S rRNA gene library). The dominant bacteria in field-captured A. stephensi adult male were

The transition from larvae to adult is a metabolically
dynamic and complex process. It is likely that the gutassociated flora plays some role in facilitating this transition. The gut during larvae to adult transition is believed
to undergo sterilization process and adults recruit new
microbiota. Our results revealed that the gut sterilization
is not complete during transition and certain bacteria are
retained (Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Cryseobacterium and Serratia sp). These
bacterial species do not become dominant during adult
maturation and remain in low abundance except Cryseobacterium and Serratia sp., which were relatively high in
lab-reared adult male, female and field-collected larvae
and adult female A. stephensi. Acinetobacter and Enterobacter sp. were retained by both male and female field-collected A. stephensi. It is interesting to observe here that
Bacillus and Staphylococcus sp. were exclusively retained by
adult field-collected male A. stephensi, whereas, Cryseobacterium, Pseudomonas and Serratia sp. were retained by adult
field-collected female A. stephensi. Adult male and female
mosquitoes are anisomorphic and have different feeding

habits. The gut flora is known to help in various physiological processes including digestion. The difference in gut
flora might help in digestion of different types of food in
male and female mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes are
anautogenous, i.e., they require blood meal for ovarian
development, which also supplies loads of microbial flora
while male mosquitoes never take blood. This may be the
reason for the observed more diverse gut flora in adult
female than in the male mosquitoes.
It is observed that the bacterial diversity in field-collected
mosquitoes, whether male or female, was much more
than that of lab-reared mosquitoes. Under laboratory conditions, the mosquitoes were reared in hygienic and controlled conditions whereas, reverse is true for the field
conditions. Hence, the larvae in field are more exposed to
the microbial flora of the open water than their counterparts in the laboratory. Larvae being filter feeders ingest
the water in immediate vicinity irrespective of their preference. Similarly, adult mosquitoes feed on uncontrolled
natural diet, while laboratory-reared mosquitoes were fed
with sterile glucose solution and resins. Even the blood
offered to female mosquitoes in laboratory is from infection-free rabbit; on the other hand, the blood meal in field
is good source of various infections. Thus, field-collected
mosquitoes have more chances of having diverse gut flora
as was observed.
Mosquitoes are known to elicit specific immune
responses against parasites [3,4,42]. Some of these
immune responsive genes are expressed in response to
bacteria and this raises the possibility that the presence of
specific bacteria in the gut may have an effect on the effi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

cacy at which a pathogen is transmitted by a vector mosquito [9]. In previous studies of lab-reared A. stephensi
adults, it was demonstrated that great number of S. marcescens were found in the midgut of the insects, but was not
found in larvae and pupae [10]. In another study, it was
observed that Plasmodium vivax load in A. albimanus mosquitoes co-infected with E. cloacae and S. marcensces were
lower (17 and 210 times respectively) than control aseptic
A. albimanus mosquitoes with Plasmodium vivax infection
(without E. cloacae and S. marcensce). In our study, we also
observed that a relatively high number of S. marcescens
(35 isolates from lab-reared male/female and 48 clones
from field-collected female/larvae) were identified from
lab and field- populations of A. stephensi. However, none
S. marcescens species were identified from field- collected
male A. stephensi. At this point it is premature to draw correlation between the occurrences of S. marcensce and
pathogenecity or vector load. However, previous reports
suggest that mortality in S. marcensces-infected A. albimanus mosquitoes was 13 times higher compared with
the controls [12].
The present study assumes importance in the light of earlier studies which suggested that the composition of midgut microbiota has a significant effect on the survival of
dengue (DEN) viruses in the gut lumen [43]. The overall
susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to dengue
viruses increased more than two-folds, with the incorporation of bacterium Aeromonas culicicola. However, the
increase in susceptibility was not observed when the antibiotic-treated A. aegypti mosquitoes were used, indicating
that A. aegypti mosquito midgut bacterial flora plays a role
in determining their capacity to carry viral load to the
virus [43]. It has also been proposed that Wolbachia strains
might be used to skew A. aegypti mosquito population life
span, thereby reducing pathogen transmission without
eradicating mosquito populations [2]. Furthermore, studies involving the effect of midgut bacterial flora have indicated that the incorporation of the Pseudomonas and
Acinetobacter isolates in the mosquito blood meal resulted
in an increased vector load of parasite of Culex quinquefasciatus towards virus infections [44]. It has also been shown
in lab-reared Drosophila melanogaster that genetic differences promote pathological gut bacterial assemblages,
reducing host survival. There results imply that induced
antimicrobial compounds function primarily to protect
the insect against the bacteria that persist within their
body, rather than to clear microbial infections and thus
they directly benefit the insect survival [45]. Malaria-mosquito combination is believed to have been around for
thousands of years. It is likely that acquired microflora
permitted the maintenance of parasite in mosquito. The
microbes could be benefiting mosquito by protecting
against pathogenic bacteria or lowering the innate immunity of mosquito against parasite. It has been reported that

reduction in the normal bacterial flora in the mosquito
midgut increases Plasmodium falciparum infection rates in
experimentally infected Anopheles mosquitoes [41]. Interactions between midgut bacteria and malaria parasites in
wild mosquito populations could explain how the vector
potential for malaria parasite transmission is modulated/
influenced by environmental factors such as acquisition
of different types of bacteria.
The results obtained from our study and from view of previous studies it is indicated that colonization of bacteria in
mosquitoes occurs early during their development. It is
reasonable to assume that infection of mosquitoes occurs
by acquisition of different bacterial species from the environment. The midgut bacterial infection in mosquito
field-populations may influence P. vivax transmission and
could contribute to understanding variations in malaria
incidence observed in different area. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt of comparative cataloguing the midgut microbiota of a parasite transmitting
vector A. stephensi from lab-reared and field- collected
adult and larvae using "culture-dependent and independent methods". Most of the previous studies of midgut
flora of Anopheles mosquitoes exclusively utilized culturedependent methods for screening. By including cultureindependent method, we obtained a broader picture of
the mosquito midgut flora. These microbes represent a
potential resource that could be employed in mechanisms
to interfere with mosquito vector development and in
interrupting parasite development.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates that the microbial flora of larvae
and adult A.stephensi midgut is complex and is dominated
by gammaproteobacteria and Gram-positive firmicutes
species. The dominant phylotypes most probably originated from midgut inhabitants. A sex specific variation
was observed, this being reflected in the proportional
changes of the microbial phyla, as well as at the species
level. Identification methods detected a high microbial
diversity among A. stephensi adult and larval midgut. The
micro flora of the investigated A. stephensi adults and larvae differed statistically and differences between the larval
microbial diversity was more pronounced than the differences noted between A. stephensi male and female culturable and unculturables. This work provided basic
information about bacterial diversity in midgut of labreared and field-caught A. stephensi male female and larval
species and its population dynamics and hence, qualitative information about the total bacterial exposure in
midgut environment. Our future work will include characterization of the different sources of microbes and a
quantitative assessment of the different microbial taxa. It
is promising that several of the isolates are Gram-negative
gammaproteobacteria, for which there are well estab-

lished means of genetic modification. All of the bacterial
isolates from this study will be further evaluated for their
suitability as paratransgenic candidate.

Methods
Maintenance of Anopheles stephensi
Cyclic colonies of Anopheles stephensi were maintained in
a mosquitarium maintained at 28 ± 2°C and 70–80%
humidity. Adult mosquitoes were offered raisins and 1%
glucose solution as a source of energy. Female mosquitoes
were allowed to feed on caged rabbit for their ovarian
development. Eggs were collected in filter paper lined
plastic bowls half filled with de-ionized water and left
undisturbed for two days to allow the eggs to hatch. Larvae were cultured in enamels trays and were fed upon mixture of dog biscuit and yeast extract in 3:1 ratio. Following
pupation, the pupae were transferred to accordingly
labeled cages for emergence of adults.
Collection of mosquitoes and isolation of bacterial flora
from midgut
IV instar anopheline larvae were collected thrice from
cement tanks in District Jhajjar, Haryana, India (28°37'N
and 76°39'E). The larvae were brought to the laboratory
in Delhi within two hours of collection and those that are
morphologically identified as Anopheles stephensi were
pooled [46]. The larvae were surface sterilized for 5 sec. in
95% ethanol [28]. The larval guts were dissected aseptically in laminar hood using sterile entomological needles
underneath a stereo microscope. The dissected midguts
were transferred to the 100 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and were grounded to homogeneity.

For studying the microflora of adult mosquito midgut, the
IV instar larvae were allowed to emerge in the adult mosquitoes and the females and males were separated based
on their morphological differences. The midguts of both
the sexes were aseptically dissected as described for the IV
instar larvae. Similarly the lab-reared adult male and
female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were also dissected
to study the gut flora. Each midgut extract consisted of a
mean number of 24, 25 and 30 pooled midguts of adult
male, female and larvae respectively. Midgut extracts were
stored in a -80°C deep freezer until further analysis.
Isolation of Bacteria
Culture-Dependent Methods
Microbial strain isolation protocol followed addition of 1
ml of the each sample to 5 ml of trypticasein soy agar
(TSA) and LB agar medium, (HiMedia, India) and incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm for 24 h–48 h. One hundred
micro liters of these samples were spread on to TSA and LB
agar plates (2% agar was added to the medium). A 100 μl
aliquot from these samples was further serially diluted up
to 10-6 and plated onto TSA and LB agar. Incubations were

Page 18 of 22

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:96

done at 37°C for 24 h–48 h. This nutrient rich media supports growth of dominating and even supporting group
population of microbes.
The initial number of 40 isolates was reduced to 20 colonies, selected randomly after a first round of screening
based on colony characteristics (involving colony size,
shape, color, margin, opacity, elevation, and consistency)
and the morphology of isolates based on Gram's staining.
The colonies on TSA and LB agar are expected to represent
the heterotrophic bacterial population associated with
both laboratory-reared and field-collected mosquitoes.
This resulted in around 20–30 isolates from each sample.
Single distinct colonies of isolates were picked and
streaked on fresh TSA plates. Isolates were sub-cultured
three times before using as pure culture.
Identification of bacterial isolates
Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated by colony PCR protocol. 16S rRNA gene was amplified using 16S universal
primers as reported by Lane et al. (1991) PCR reactions
were performed under the following conditions: Initial
denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min 30 sec, 72°C
for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min [47].
Partial 16S rRNA gene (600 to 900 bp product) was
amplified using forward primer 27F 5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' and reverse primer 1492R 5'-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'. The presence and yield of
PCR product was determined on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis at 200 V for 30 min in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA
buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR products were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and were partially sequenced using
universal primers.
Screening of isolates on the basis of antibiotic-sensitivity assay
One hundred distinct isolated colonies from both labreared and field-collected mosquitoes were grown individually in LB medium at 37°C, 200 rpm for 24 h–48 h.
One hundred micro liter bacterial culture (O.D600~1.0;
105 CFU) was spread on LB plates. Each isolate was tested
against 12 different antibiotic discs of known concentrations: Ampicillin (Amp) 25 mcg, Carbenicillin (Car) 100
mcg, Chloramphenicol (Chl) 10 mcg, Gentamycin (Gen)
10 mcg, Kanamycin (Kan) 30 mcg, Nalidixic acid (Nal) 30
mcg, Penicillin G (Peni) 10 units, Polymyxin B (Poly) 100
units, Rifampicin (Rif) 15 mcg, Streptomycin (Str) 10
mcg, Tetracyclin (Tet) 10 mcg and Vancomycin (Van) 10
mcg were equidistantly placed on three NA plates at the
rate of 4 discs per plate. Plates were incubated overnight at
37°C. Zone of inhibition of bacterial growth was measured (diameter in mm) and on the basis of zone of inhibition, isolates were segregated [38]. The strains were
distinguishable at a preliminary level on the basis of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

response to all the 12 different antibiotics [see Additional
file 1].
Determination of metabolic characteristics
Different isolates were patched individually onto selective
media such as LB agar (as control), casein hydrolysate
(1%), starch (1%), tributyrin (1%) and to identify their
abilities to produce amylase, lipase and protease activity,
respectively. All the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24–
48 h. These activities were checked by observing for a zone
of clearing around each bacterial isolate. For protease
activity, plates containing casein hydrolysate were visualized by coomassie staining of the plates. For starch, the
zone of clearing was observed after flooding the plates
with iodine solution. Relative enzyme activity was calculated by finding the ratio of zone of clearing (mm) and
size of the bacterial colony (mm).

Culture-Independent Method
16S rRNA gene library construction
Total DNA isolation
Total microbial DNA was extracted by adapting minor
modifications in the protocol described by Broderick et al.
(2004) [48]. Midgut extracts were thawed and 600 μl of
Tris-EDTA (TE) (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA)
was added to each tube. The contents of the tube were
then sonicated for 30 sec. as described earlier to separate
bacterial cells from the gut wall and 537 μl of TE was
removed and placed in a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
The sample was sonicated under the same conditions for
45 s to break open bacterial cells and was mixed thoroughly with 60 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 3 μl
of 50 mg of proteinase K/ml and was incubated for 1:30 h
at 37°C. Each tube was mixed with 100 μl of 5 M NaCl
prior to the addition of 80 μl of 10% cetyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide-5 M NaCl. The sample was mixed
thoroughly and incubated at 65°C for 30 min. DNA was
extracted with equal volumes of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (CIA) (24:1 [vol/vol]) and phenol CIA (25:24:1 [vol/
vol/vol]). DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and
recovered by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in
100 μl of TE buffer. DNA concentration and purity was
determined by absorbance ratio at 260/280 nm, and the
DNA suspension was stored at -20°C until it was used for
PCR and further analysis.
PCR amplification
Bacterial 16S rRNA gene from total DNA were amplified
by PCR in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing (as final
concentration) 1× PCR buffer, with 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM
of each dNTPs, DNA (50 ng), 2 μM each of forward primer
27F 5'-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3' and reverse
primer 1492R 5'-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3' [47]
and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Real Biotech Corporation, India). The reaction mixture was incubated at

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:96

94°C for 5 min for initial denaturation, followed by 30
cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 53°C, 55°C or 58°C for 90 sec,
72°C for 2 min 30 sec and a final extension at 72°C for
10 minutes. All reactions were carried out in 0.2 ml tubes
in an ABI Thermal Cycler. PCR product of the three
annealing temperatures were pooled and was examined
by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The amplified product was pooled and
purified using gel band extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Cloning of Bacterial 16S rRNA gene
16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed by ligating
PCR product into pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega,
USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
ligated product was transformed into E. coli DH5α. Transformants were grown on LB plates containing 100 μg mL1 each of ampicillin, X-gal and Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Single white colonies that grew upon overnight incubation were patched on LB Amp plates. Plasmid
DNA was isolated from transformants by plasmid prep kit
(Axygen, USA). All clones in libraries of approximately
100 clones from each lab-reared and field-collected adults
were sequenced.
DNA sequencing data analysis
Sequencing reactions were performed using the Big Dye
reaction mix (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) at Macrogen Inc. South
Korea. Purified plasmid DNA was initially sequenced by
using the primers T7 and SP6, which flank the insert DNA
in PGEM-T easy vector. DNA from cultured strains were
sequenced by using 27F and 1492R primers. All partial
16S rRNA gene sequence assembly and analysis were carried out by using Lasergene package version 5.07 (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis. USA). Partial 16S rRNA gene
sequences were initially analyzed using the BLASTn search
facility. Chimeric artifacts were checked using
CHECK_CHIMERA program of http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi RDP II analysis software http://
rdp.cme.msu.edu/[49,50] and by another chimera detection program "Bellerophon" available at http://
foo.maths.uq.edu.au/~huber/bellerophon.pl[37,51,52].
The sequences were submitted to the NCBI (National
Centre for Biotechnology and Information) and GenBank
for obtaining accession numbers.
Phylogenetic tree construction
All the sequences were compared with 16S rRNA gene
sequences available in the GenBank databases by BLASTn
search. Multiple sequence alignments of partial 16S rRNA
gene sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W, version
1.8 [53]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from evolutionary distances using the Neighbor-Joining method
implemented through NEIGHBOR (DNADIST) from the
PHYLIP version 3.61 packages [54]. The robustness of the
phylogeny was tested by bootstrap analysis using 1000

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/96

iterations. Sulpholobus solfataricus (Accession number
X03235) was selected as an out group [37]. Trees generated were analyzed with the TREEVIEW program [55].
Accession numbers of all isolates and clones can be
viewed in respective phylogenetic tree. All of the
sequences have been submitted to the NCBI (National
Centre for Biotechnology and Information) GenBank
sequence database. The accession numbers are the following; sequences from laboratory-reared adult male and
female A. stephensi (female clones F1–F24): (FJ607957–
FJ607980), (Female isolates 1F-16F): (FJ607981–
FJ607996), (male isolates 1M-20M): (FJ607997–
FJ608014), (male clones LMC1–LMC24): (FJ608015–
FJ608038). Accession numbers from field caught adult
male, female and larvae of A. stephensi are the following;
(larvae clones LC1–LC70): (FJ608039–FJ608103), (larvae
isolates L1–L39): (FJ608104–FJ608133), (male clones
MFC1–MFC96: (FJ608134–FJ608218), (male isolates
M1–M20): (FJ608219 – FJ608233), (female isolates F1–
F37): (FJ608234–FJ608267), (female clones FC2–FC96):
(FJ608268–FJ608333).
Richness Estimation by DOTUR
Distance-based operational taxonomic unit and richness
(DOTUR) was used to calculate various diversity indices
and richness estimators. Sequences are usually grouped as
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or phylotypes, both
of which are defined by DNA sequence. A genetic distance
is approximately equal to the converse of the identity percentage. DOTUR, assigns sequences accurately to OTUs or
phylotypes based on sequence data by using values that are
less than the cutoff level. 16S rRNA clone sequences were
grouped into same OTUs by using 97% identity threshold.
The source code is available at http://www.plant
path.wisc.edu/fac/joh/dotur.html[56]. A PHYLIP http://
evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html[54] generated distance matrix is used as an input file, which assigns
sequences to OTUs for every possible distance. DOTUR
then calculates values that are used to construct rarefaction
curves of observed OTUs, to ascertain the relative richness
between culturable isolates and 16S rRNA gene libraries. In
this study we used DOTURs dexterity by analyzing, culturable isolates and 16S rRNA gene libraries constructed from
lab-reared and field-collected A. stephensi.

The Shannon-Weiner diversity index is [18,37] calculated
as follows:
H = Σ (pi) (log2 p - i), where p represents the proportion
of a distinct phylotype relative to the sum of all distinct
phylotypes.
Evenness (E) was calculated as: E = H/Hmax where Hmax
= log2 (S)

Coverage was calculated by Good's method, according to
which the percentage of coverage was calculated with the
formula [1 - (n/N)] × 100, where n is the number of
molecular species represented by one clone (single-clone
OTUs) and N is the total number of sequences [57].

Rarefaction curve for comparison of diversity
To compare the bacterial diversity of lab-reared and fieldcollected mosquito samples, a large number of clones
were analyzed and a cutoff value of 97% was used for
OTUs. To obtain a phylogenetic relationship between the
various phylotypes, one representative member of each
phylotype was selected. To determine if the number of
clones analyzed in lab-reared and field- adapted adults
were representative for the each bacterial community, a
table was made in which each OTU was listed as many
times as its observed frequency. Rarefaction curve was
generated by plotting the number of OTUs observed
against number of sequences sampled [55].
