Genomic variability in Potato virus M and the
development of RT-PCR and RFLP procedures for
the detection of this virus in seed potatoes
Huimin Xu*, Jeanette D’Aubin, Jingbai Nie

Abstract
Potato virus M (PVM, Carlavirus) is considered to be one of the most common potato viruses distributed worldwide.
Sequences of the coat protein (CP) gene of several Canadian PVM isolates were determined. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated that all known PVM isolates fell into two distinct groups and the isolates from Canada and the US clustered in the same group. The Canadian PVM isolates could be further divided into two sub-groups. Two molecular
procedures, reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were developed in this study for the detection and identification of PVM in potato tubers. RT-PCR was
highly specific and only amplified PVM RNA from potato samples. PVM RNAs were easily detected in composite
samples of 400 to 800 potato leaves or 200 to 400 dormant tubers. Restriction analysis of PCR amplicons with MscI
was a simple method for the confirmation of PCR tests. Thus, RT-PCR followed by RFLP analysis may be a useful
approach for screening potato samples on a large scale for the presence of PVM.
Background
Potato virus M (PVM), a member of the genus Carlavirus in the family Flexviridae, has a single-stranded,
polyadenylated, positive-sense genomic RNA of appropriately 8.5 kb in length [1,2]. PVM is considered to be
one of the most common potato viruses distributed
worldwide and an economically important pathogen of
potato (Solanum tunerosum). PVM can cause a yield
reduction in potatoes between 15% and 45%, and potato
cultivars may be 100% infected in some regions [3]. The
virus is transmitted by aphids in a non- persistent manner and by mechanical inoculation with sap from young
leaves [1]. PVM causes mottle, mosaic, crinkling and
rolling of leaves and stunting of shoots. Symptoms of
potato plants caused by PVM infection are similar to
those caused by several other common potato viruses
including Potato virus S (PVS, Carlavirus), Potato virus
X (PVX, Potexvirus) and the common strain of Potato
virus Y (PVYO, Potyvirus). Severity of symptoms varies
greatly depending on the combination of potato cultivars and PVM isolates [3,4].

A practical and important way to limit the spread of
PVM and to control potato disease caused by this virus
is to use PVM-free potato seed tubers. It is required by
seed potato certification program in Canada and many
other countries that seed potatoes must be screened for
various viruses including PVM and the total virus incidence must be lower than an acceptable level (e.g. 5%).
Currently enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
is the predominant method employed for the detection
of PVM in potato samples on a large scale [5,6]. But, to
screen potato tuber samples by ELISA, the tuber dormancy must be broken and sprouts are used for detecting PVM to avoid false negative result due to the low
PMV titre in dormant potato tubers. Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures
have been developed and employed successfully for the
specific detection of several potato viruses including various strain groups of PVY [6-11], Potato mop-top virus
(PMTV, Pomovirus)[12], Tobacco rattle virus (TRV,
Tobravirus)[13] and Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV, Alfamovirus)[14]. RT-PCR has been demonstrated to be sensitive, specific, simple and fast. The efficiency of viral or
total RNA extraction from potato samples on a large
scale has been greatly improved by the utilization of
standard commercial RNA extraction kits [13,14]. Viral

RNA can be extracted directly from dormant potato
tubers without the need to treat the tubers for breaking
dormancy or to grow the tubers in greenhouse for leaf
testing by ELISA.
In this paper we report on the analysis of the coat
protein (CP) gene sequence of several Canadian PVM
isolates and the comparison of PVM isolates from
Canada and other countries. Oligonucleotide primers
specific to PVM CP gene were designed and RT-PCR
procedures were developed for the specific detection of
PVM in various potato samples and for the confirmation
of PCR amplicons. The efficacy of RT-PCR for indexing
seed potato samples on large scale for PVM was
enhanced by using composite leaf and tuber samples.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was
introduced to verify PCR amplicon identity.

Results
Initial tests by ELISA and RT-PCR

All original PVM samples (tubers, leaves, tissue culture
plantlets) were confirmed by ELISA to be positive for
PVM (Table 1). In preliminary tests, amplicons of 520
bp were generated in RT-PCR using primer set PVM3/
PVM4 from RNA templates extracted from leaf samples
of potato plants infected with PVM isolates CL1, 2, 3, 4
and several field isolates and all PCR amplicons were
digested by MscI specifically resulting in two fragments
of expected size (Table 1, Fig. 1). RNA extracts from
foliage of potato plants infected with other viruses or
viroid were also tested in RT-PCR using this primer set

to determine specificity. None of them yielded any
amplification products. To evaluate the sensitivity of the
RT-PCR for the detection of PVM in dormant tubers
using primers PVM3/PVM4, sap from PVM infected
tubers was mixed with sap from healthy tubers in a dilution series from 1:0 to 1:799 (infected tissue sap: healthy
tissue sap, v/v) followed by RNA extraction. PCR amplicons of 520 bp were detected in all composite leaf samples (from 1:0 to 1:799, data not shown) and in most of
the composite tuber (dormant) and sprout samples ranging from 1:0 to 1:399 (Fig. 2).
Confirmatory tests

All samples confirmed to be positive for PVM in the
initial RT-PCR tests were re-tested to confirm the validity of the initial test and as a check for false positive
results. RNA was re-extracted from fresh tissue sap and
amplified by RT-PCR using the same primer set
(PVM3/PVM4). In each case RT-PCR amplicons of 520
bp were obtained and digested into 150 and 370 bp
fragments upon treatment with MscI (Table 1, Fig. 1).
Retested samples that gave the expected RT-PCR and
RFLP results were considered confirmed positives. Tissue saps of all positive samples were used to inoculate
potato and indicator plants. All these test PVM isolates
induced light mosaic symptoms on inoculated potato
plants (Shepody) (Table 1) and chlorotic local lesions on
inoculated Chenopodium quinoa plants (data not
shown). Subsequently PVM was detected by ELISA, RTPCR and RFLP (the same as that shown in Table 1)
from inoculated plants. Progeny tubers produced by the

Figure 1 Detection of PVM RNA in potato samples by RT-PCR
and confirmation of PCR products by restriction analysis. PCR
amplicons (520 bp) were produced in RT-PCR using primers PVM3
and PVM4 from RNA extracted from PVM-Ca508 infected tuber
(lanes 2), leaf (lane 4) and sprout (lanes 6) samples. PCR products
were digested into two fragments, 370 and 150 bp with MscI (lanes
3, 5, 7) for verification. M: Molecular weight marker (100 bp DNA
ladder, New England Biolabs, Pickering, Ontario); No-template
control (lane 1) and negative control (RNA extracted from healthy
leaves, lane 8) were used for PCR. Gel electrophoresis: 1.5% Agarose1000 (Invitrogen Canada, Burlington, Ontario).

inoculated plants did not show any necrotic symptom
(neither surface, nor internal) at the time of harvest or
after 12 weeks in storage at 4-8°C.
Sequence analysis

Total RNAs extracted from potato leaves confirmed to
be positive for PVM by various tests (ELISA, bioassay,
RT-PCR and RFLP) were also amplified in RT-PCR
using primer set PVM1/PVM2 flanking the entire CP
gene of PVM resulting in PCR amplicons of 917 bp (CP
gene: 915 bases) that were then sequenced from both
directions using primers PVM1/PVM2. PCR amplicons
generated using primer set PVM3/PVM4 were also
sequenced from both directions with the same primer
set. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based
on the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene and the
amino acid sequence of coat protein showed that all
PVM isolates fell into two distinct groups - I and II
(Table 2 and Fig. 3). PVM isolates in group I only
shared approximately 73% - 75% of identical nucleotides
and 85% - 87% of identical amino acids with isolates in
group II. Isolates within the same group (either I or II)
shared over 90% of identical nucleotides and over 95%
identical amino acids (Table 2). Variation among isolates
in either group (I or II) was 7% to 8% in nucleotides and
approximately 4% in amino acids. PVM isolates in either
group I or II might be further divided into two or three
sub-groups (Table 2, Fig. 3).

Discussion
In this study, PVM was detected in several potato samples from an experimental farm in the province of

Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. These PVM isolates
and four other PVM isolates from Charlottetown
Laboratory (CL), Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) virus collection were characterized in this study
by ELISA, bioassay, RT-PCR, RFLP and sequence analysis of the CP gene. Data from all the tests positively
identified the virus as PVM. Sequence analysis of these
PVM isolates and eight other known PVM strains/isolates showed that all PVM isolates evaluated fell into
two distinct groups - group I and II. Group I consisted
of PVM isolates detected and characterized in Italy, Germany, China, Poland and Russia and group II consisted
of Canadian and US isolates. Isolates in group I might
be further divided into two sub-groups - Ia, and Ib.
PVM isolates from China and Poland formed the group
Ia and group Ib consisted of isolates from Italy, Germany and Russia. Isolates in group II could be further
divided into two sub-groups - IIa and IIb. PVM isolates
Idaho and Ca128 were considered to represent IIa and
IIb, respectively. Group IIa consisted of isolates Idaho,
Ca508, Ca513, CL1 and CL3 and group IIb consisted of
CL4, Ca5 and Ca218 (Table 2, Fig. 3). PVM Idaho strain
and PVM isolates detected in potato samples from PEI
probably have the same origin and both group IIa and
IIb types of PVM isolates may be present in the same
geographic region.
Based on the sequence alignment of known PVM
strains/isolates, two sets of primers specific to PVM CP
gene, PVM1/PVM2 and PVM3/PVM4 were designed

and were evaluated in RT-PCR for the detection of
PVM in potato tubers (dormant and non-dormant),
sprouts and leaves (also tissue culture plantlets). Both
sets of primers were highly specific and only amplified
PVM RNA to generate PCR products of the expected
length. These primer sets produced no amplicons from
potato samples collected from healthy plants and plants
infected with Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd, the
type species of Pospiviroid) and several other viruses
(see below). Primer set PVM1/PVM2 was used successfully for the amplification of the entire PVM CP gene.
Primer set PVM3/PVM4 was employed mainly in RTPCR for amplifying a segment of PVM CP gene from
total RNAs extracted from various types of potato samples. PVM RNA was readily detected by RT-PCR from
total RNA preparations extracted from bulked potato
samples (leaves, sprouts and tubers). Up to 800 leaves
or 400 sprouts could be combined for reliable detection
of PVM RNA by RT-PCR. Up to 200 to 400 dormant
tubers could be combined to achieve reliable detection
of PVM RNA by RT-PCR. The approach of using composite tuber samples will greatly reduce the cost and
time associated with RT-PCR for indexing seed potato
lots on a large scale for the presence or absence of
PVM. If there is need, it is possible to determine the
quantity of PVM RNA in the test sample by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR. In this study, PVM RNA was
easily detectable from as low as 5 ng of total RNAs
extracted from dormant potato tubers or as low as 0.1

pg of PVM RNA was readily detectable by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown).
Analysis of PCR amplicons based solely on molecular
mass on agarose gels may result in false positive conclusions. RFLP analysis was conducted in this study to
determine the identity of all PCR amplicons and the
results confirmed that all amplicons generated by primers PVM1/PVM2 and PVM3/PVM4 were indeed
derived from PVM RNAs. A single MscI (TGG↓CCA)
site was confirmed in the region flanked by primer
PVM3 and PVM4 in the CP gene of all the Canadian
PVM isolates sequenced in this study and all other
known PVM isolates except those PVM strains/isolates
(M57, Uran and Hangzhou) in the phylogenetic group
Ia. RT-PCR using primer set PVM3/PVM4 followed by
RFLP analysis using MscI provided a rapid, sensitive and
reliable detection-confirmation approach for indexing
seed potatoes in Canada since all PVM samples from
Canadian potato lots have been detected and identified
using this approach. Several other restriction endonucleases, such as NcoI, NdeI, PvuII and TaqI, were also
evaluated and they may be used to differentiate various
PVM strains/isolate since not all analysed PVM isolates
have the restriction sites. For example, in the region
between primers PVM3 and PVM4, a NcoI site was
revealed in PVM isolates detected in Germany, Italy,
Russia, Poland and China, but not found in the isolates
detected in the US (Idaho strain) and Canada (data not
shown).

Figure 3 Phylogenetic dendrogram depicting the relationship among PVM isolates based on alignment of nucleotide of the CP gene
(top) and amino acid sequence of the coat protein (bottom). The phylogenetic relationship between PVM isolates were deduced using the
Bootstrap Neighbour-Joining (N-J) methods (random number generator seed: 111, number of bootstrap trails: 1000) in the Phylip formatted
Clustal W (V1.82). The trees were visualized and the dendrograms were displayed using the program TreeView (V1.5).

Conclusion
PVM isolates were characterized at the molecular level
in this study and their genetic relationships with other
known PVM isolates were established. RT-PCR and
RFLP procedures were developed for the detection and
identification of PVM in potatoes. Composite leaf or
tuber samples can be used in PCR tests to reduce the
time and cost needed for screening tubers on a large
scale.
Materials and methods
Potato samples

Seven PVM isolates (Ca5, Ca99, Ca102, Ca128, Ca414,
Ca508 and Ca513) from potatoes (Solanum tuberosum

cv. Shepody) grown on an experimental farm in the province Prince Edward Island, Canada and four PVM isolates (CL1, 2, 3, 4) from CFIA-CL virus collection, were
identified and characterized, on the basis of bioassay
and serological reactions (Table 1). All isolates were
maintained in infected potato plants that were grown
under greenhouse conditions and progeny tubers were
harvested and stored at 4°C. Dormancy breaking was
done by maintaining tubers at room temperature.
Tubers were sampled according to the methods
described previously [12]. Leaf and sprout samples were
directly used for extracting tissue sap. All samples were
macerated in extraction bags (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland) by pounding the tissue with a hammer and the

Xu et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:25

tissue sap was subjected to different tests as described
below. Plant sap was kept at -20°C if it was not used
within 12 hours. A second aliquot of the sap from RTPCR positive samples was re-tested to confirm the initial
results. All PCR amplicons were subjected to restriction
digestion and the RFLP pattern was used to determine
whether they matched PVM patterns. Positive samples
were then subjected to bioassay (see below).
Bioassay

Tissue sap from PVM positive samples based on initial
ELISA and RT-PCR tests were inoculated onto healthy
potato (Russet Burbank) and indicator (C. quinoa)
plants. Tissue sap was diluted (1:2) in phosphate buffer
(0.1 M, pH7.2) and inoculated onto leaves of potato and
indicator plants by rubbing carborundum dusted leaves.
Inoculated plants were grown in a greenhouse at 18°C 22°C and observed every other day for the development
of symptoms. All inoculated plants (regardless of
whether or not symptoms developed) were tested for
PVM by ELISA and RT-PCR. All progeny tubers were
tested by RT-PCR followed by RFLP analysis for
confirmation.
ELISA

Potato tubers and leaves as well as indicator plants were
screened for the presence of PVM by a standard double
antibody sandwich ELISA using commercial coating
antibody, conjugate, positive control and all necessary
reagents from Neogen Europe Ltd. (Auchincruive, Scotland, UK), following the procedures recommended by
the supplier. Tuber or leaf tissues were homogenized in
0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.02% NaN3 , 0.1%
Tween 20 and 0.1% skim milk powder (pH 7.4) at a
sample to buffer ratio of 1:5 (w:v) and 100 μl of
extracted sap was loaded in duplicate on microtitre
plates. A panel of positive, negative, and buffer controls,
in addition to the controls supplied with the ELISA kit,
were included on each plate. Absorbance values (A405
nm) of 4 times of the healthy control reading was used
as the positive threshold, but if absorbance of the
healthy control was < 0.030, a positive threshold of
0.100 was used.
RT-PCR

From each macerated sample, 100 μl of sap was
extracted with the Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research
Center, Inc, Cincinnati. OH) as described by the manufacturer. Subsequently the RNA was extracted with
chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, washed with
ethanol and suspended in 25 μl (for tuber samples) or
50 μl (for sprouts, leaves and tissue culture plantlets) of
RNase-free and DNase-free water according to the procedures described previously [12]. RNA extracts from
leaves and tubers of healthy potato plants were used as
negative controls. RNA extracts from foliage and/or
tubers of potato plants infected with other viruses

including AMV, PMTV, TRV, PVS, PVX, Potato aucuba
mosaic virus (PAMV, Potexvirus), PVY O , the tobacco
vein necrotic strain of PVY (PVY N ), the potato tuber
necrotic strain of PVY (PVYNTN), Potato virus A (PVA,
Potyvirus), Potato latent virus (PotLV, Carlavirus),
Potato leafroll virus (PLRV, Polerovirus) and PSTVd
were also included in RT-PCR tests to determine primer
specificity.
Two sets of primers were designed based on sequence
analysis of known PVM isolates obtained from the NCBI
website including the isolates Hangzhou (China,
AJ437481), M57 (Poland, AY692075), Uran (Poland,
AY311394), German isolate (X57440), Italy tomato strain
(X85114), Idaho strain [15](USA, AF023877) and two
Russian PVM isolates [2](D14449, Table 2). Primers
PVM1 (Reverse: CTTCATTTGTTATTCGACTT) and
PVM2 (Forward: ATGGGAGATTCAACRAAGAA) were
used for amplifying the entire CP gene and the nucleotide
sequences of the amplicons (917 bp) were then determined in both directions using the same primer set.
PVM3 (Reverse: TGAGCTCGGGACCATTCATAC) and
PVM4 (Forward: ACATCTGAGGACATGATGCGC)
were used in RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR to yield an
amplicon of 520 bp.
First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using
Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Canada, Burlington, ON, Canada)
using the antisense primer (PVM1 or PVM3). The procedure for the two step RT-PCR were essentially the
same as described previously [11]. A reaction containing
no cDNA template was included in all PCR tests as a
blank control. The temperature regime for amplification
reactions was as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min
at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds,
58°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds. The final
extension was at 72°C for 7 min. A GeneAmp 9700
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was
used for RT-PCR amplifications. Optimal annealing
temperature of primers was determined using a temperature gradient thermocycler (Watman Biometra,
Goettingen, Germany). PCR products were separated on
a 1.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and
visualized under UV light.
Restriction digestion

Several restriction endonucleases MscI, NdeI, PstI, PvuII
and TaqI (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON, Canada)
were evaluated for a direct digestion of PCR amplicons
generated with primers PVM3/PVM4 and MscI was
selected for all RFLP tests in this study. Five microliters
of PCR amplicons were digested with 5 units of the
restriction enzyme at 37°C for 1 hour in a reaction
volume of 20 μl using the buffer recommended by the
enzyme supplier. RFLP patterns were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose-1000

The CP gene amplicons generated in RT-PCR from test
samples using primer PVM1/2 and PVM3/4 were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagne Inc.,
Mississauga, ON, Canada) following the procedures
recommended by the provider and the dsDNAs amplified in a typical RT-PCR reaction (50 μl) were eluted
with 30 μl of water (DNase-free and RNase-free). Purified PCR amplicons from the CP gene of PVM isolates
CL1, CL3, CL4, Ca5, Ca128, Ca508 and Ca513 were
sequenced in both orientations by automated cycle
sequencing (York University, Toronto, ON, Canada)
using primers PVM1/PVM2 and/or PVM3/PVM4
depending on the templates. Sequences of Canadian
PVM isolates were compared with PVM sequences in
the NCBI database with the program BLAST. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal G (V1.1) and GeneDoc Multiple Sequence
Alignment Editor and Shading Utility (V2.5.000)[16].
The phylogenetic relationship of the Canadian potato
isolates of PVM and 8 other known PVM strains/isolates (Table 2) were deduced using the Bootstrap Neighbour-Joining (N-J) methods (random number generator
seed: 111, number of bootstrap trails: 1000) in the Phylip formatted Clustal W (V1.82). The trees were visualized and the dendrograms were displayed using the
program TreeView (V1.5).
