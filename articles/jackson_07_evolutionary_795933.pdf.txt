Abstract
Background: Gene order along the genome sequence of the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei
provides evidence for a 0.5 Mb duplication, comprising the 3' regions of chromosomes 4 and 8.
Here, the principal aim was to examine the contribution made by this duplication event to the T.
brucei genome sequence, emphasising the consequences for gene content and the evolutionary
change subsequently experienced by paralogous gene copies. The duplicated region may be
browsed online at http://www.genedb.org/genedb/tryp/48dup_image.jsp
Results: Comparisons of trypanosomatid genomes demonstrated widespread gene loss from each
duplicon, but also showed that 47% of duplicated genes were retained on both chromosomes as
paralogous loci. Secreted and surface-expressed genes were over-represented among retained
paralogs, reflecting a bias towards important factors at the host-parasite interface, and consistent
with a dosage-balance hypothesis. Genetic divergence in both coding and regulatory regions of
retained paralogs was bimodal, with a deficit in moderately divergent paralogs; in particular, noncoding sequences were either conserved or entirely remodelled. The conserved paralogs included
examples of remarkable sequence conservation, but also considerable divergence of both coding
and regulatory regions. Sequence divergence typically displayed strong negative selection; but
several features, such as asymmetric evolutionary rates, positively-selected codons and other nonneutral substitutions, suggested that divergence of some paralogs was driven by functional change.
The absence of orthologs to retained paralogs in T. congolense indicated that the duplication event
was specific to T. brucei.
Conclusion: The duplication of this chromosomal region doubled the dosage of many genes.
Rather than creating 'more of the same', these results show that paralogs were structurally
modified according to various evolutionary trajectories. The retention of paralogs, and subsequent
elaboration of both their primary structures and regulatory regions, strongly suggests that this
duplication was a seminal development, stimulating functional innovation and fundamentally altering
the genetic repertoire of T. brucei relative to other trypanosomatids.

Background
The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, causes
sleeping sickness and substantial human morbidity across
Africa. The recently completed genome sequences for T.

brucei and two related protistan parasites, T. cruzi and
Leishmania major [1-3], have provided a basis for understanding the biological and pathological differences
among the Trypanosomatidae infecting humans. All

trypanosomatid genomes share broad conservation of
synteny, polycistronic transcription and a general absence
of cis-introns (but isolated instances have been identified
[2]). However, the number and size of chromosomes is
known to vary between and within species, due to variation in repetitive, telomeric regions [4,5] and the infrequent, irregular genetic exchange between strains [6-8].
The T. brucei haplotype includes 11 megabase-sized chromosomes, as well as numerous mini-chromosomes [9];
other species have many more indicating that T. brucei has
experienced a sequence of chromosomal fusions [10].
This study shows that the T. brucei genome has acquired a
previously unreported duplication affecting chromosomes 4 and 8, which does not reflect temporary karyotypic fluctuation. The report begins by documenting this
partial chromosomal duplication to identify paralogous
gene copies, and then a quantitative analysis of paralogous sequences examines the potential for evolutionary
innovation and the importance of the duplication for the
genomic repertoire in T. brucei.
The architecture of genome sequences has shown that
duplication is a frequent and important process in
genome evolution [11,12]. It occurs on every scale within
the genome: mistakes during DNA synthesis cause tandem duplication of individual genes, and segmental
duplication often results from the transposition of mobile
elements; for instance, the transposition of an Alu element
caused the duplication of the human BRCA1 region [13].
Duplication of whole chromosomes, or chromosomesized blocks, can result from mistakes during cell division,
(i.e., non-disjunction). This can also occur after whole
genome duplication (WGD) when a polyploid genome
decays through selective gene loss. The relative importance of these processes seems to vary by gene function
and taxon; WGD has been widely reported, most notably
among plants [14-17] and yeasts [18-21], and may have
been responsible for major evolutionary transitions in
chordates [22-24]. Certainly, the prevalence and importance of duplication in genomic evolution has only
recently become clear [11] and is among the major
insights delivered by whole genome sequencing. These
observations have helped to revive the argument of Ohno
[25], eclipsed in the pre-genomic era by the focus on
sequence evolution, that gene duplication is the principal
source of evolutionary novelty [reviewed in [12]], faster
and more consequential than nucleotide substitution.
The fate of gene duplicates seems to be multifarious and
subject to various factors. Since duplications of any kind
disrupt systems at, or near, optimality, one should assume
that most duplications are selected against. Indeed, most
loci created after large duplication events are subsequently
deleted [12,18], resulting in 'diploidisation' in Arabidopsis
thaliana for example [22,26]. However, gene loss is nei-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/432

ther complete nor random, and may show similar trends
across taxa [27]; in teleost fishes, genes associated with
signalling and gene regulation were enriched following
gene loss [28], transcription factors were over-represented
in rice [29], while A. thaliana preferentially retained signal
transduction loci [26]. Loci with a high level of proteomic
connectivity were also selectively retained in A. thaliana
following WGD [26]. Ohno's original model [25] intuitively suggested that duplication facilitated novel functions (neofunctionalisation) through the relaxation of
purifying selection due to redundancy after duplication.
The importance of rapid, structural evolution to functional innovation has been inferred from the widespread
asymmetry of evolutionary change among paralogous
genes and regions [19,26,30-32], the acceleration of evolutionary rate among paralogs [33,34] and positive selection of duplicated genes [35,36].
In contrast to neofunctionalisation, functional change
might result from a segregation of the original gene function between duplicates (subfunctionalisation), due to
degenerate mutations in each, and producing copies with
distinct specificities [37-40]. The duplication-degeneration-complementation model [38] refined this concept,
stating that complementary mutations in regulatory
regions were responsible for partitioning functionality.
Many examples of duplicates performing generic functions, but with specific spatial or temporal expression profiles, are known; myb-homologs in maize (Zea mays) are
tandem duplicates and are expressed in distinct flower tissues due to divergence in their 3' regulatory regions [41].
In pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), two copies of a Hox gene
(Hoxa2) formed after WGD are expressed in distinct
regions of the hindbrain, whereas their common ortholog
in tetrapods is expressed throughout; tissue specificity
evolved through changes in cis regulatory modules [42].
Along with loss of function (pseudogenisation, or nonfunctionalisation), a gallery of potential fates has been
formulated. What is clear is that sensible changes in structure are correlated with changes in function; these may
affect coding sequences or regulatory modules, and the
precise outcome of duplication likely reflects both selective pressures (adaptation) and historical constraints, that
is, the function, indispensability and connectivity of the
original gene [43]. Duplicates may evolve through structural divergence or rapid changes in expression profile,
but duplication always creates evolutionary opportunities, some of which may lead to novelty.
This study provides the first account of a large duplication
event in T. brucei, which, if its consequences are similar to
those in other organisms, may provide, or have provided,
the raw material for evolutionary innovation and the
expansion of gene families. Previously, studies of tandem
gene arrays had documented gene duplication in trypano-

somatids, for example, the phosphoglycerate kinase gene
array [44] and hexose transporters [45], where gene duplication combined with gene conversion to create novel
sequence types; this phenomenon is now known to be
widespread [46]. Elaboration of important trypanosomatid gene families, such as amastin surface antigens in
Leishmania spp. [47] and VSGs in T. brucei [48] are also the
consequences of gene duplication. However, the impact
of this chromosomal duplication has been much greater
and, by examining the evolutionary changes that have
subsequently affected each duplicon, this study sought to
establish its contribution to the T. brucei genome. There
were four specific aims: i) to document gene losses and
gains since the duplication event; ii) to describe patterns
of both coding and non-coding sequence divergence
between paralogous gene pairs ; iii) to assess evidence for
disparity in evolutionary rate during divergence using relative rates tests; iv) to assess the role of non-neutral substitutions in deriving new functions.

Results
(a) Partial chromosomal duplication: gene content and
order
Comparison of gene order along Chromosomes 4 and 8
of T. brucei with homologous regions in T. cruzi and L.
major demonstrated widespread colinearity within and
between species. Figure 1 shows tBLASTx analyses
between Chromosomes 4 and 8 and Chromosome 31 in
L. major, visualised by the Artemis Comparison Tool
(ACT). The blast hits between chromosomes 4 and 8 are
given in greater detail in Additional data file 1. On Chromosome 8 (0.98â1.47 Mb), the duplicon begins with a
ser/thr-protein kinase NrkAgene (1: Tb927.8.6930; paralogous gene pairs are numbered 1 to 74 and referred to by
their GeneDB identifier tags), which is preceded upstream
by a strand-switch region, and ends at the chromosomal
terminus with a receptor-type adenylate cyclase (74:
Tb927.8.8360). On Chromosome 4 (2â2.48 Mb), a paralog of the ser/thr-protein kinase NrkAgene is found near
the chromosomal terminus (1: Tb927.4.5390) and is followed downstream by a strand-switch region and several
genes typical of T. brucei sub-telomeric regions. Synteny
with Chromosome 8 is conserved upstream, culminating

in several genes that include a receptor-type adenylate
cyclase (74: Tb927.4.3860). This is preceded upstream by
10 loci that were not conserved on Chromosome 4, and
then a strand-switch region. Hence, each duplicon was
bound by strand-switch regions and approximately 0.5
Mb in size, and gene order between the two regions was
colinear and anti-parallel.
The location of homologs of the duplicated genes in T.
cruzi and L. major genome sequences showed that gene
order was largely conserved in these species. This served
two purposes; first, it showed that both duplicons corresponded to the entirety of Chromosome 31 in L. major,
although, as Figure 1 shows, this chromosome is larger
and contains other genes besides those retained in T. brucei. Complete chromosomal structure is not established in
T. cruzi. And second, it enabled the ancestral gene order of
the pre-duplication chromosome to be inferred, through
the classification of duplicated genes as shared (i.e. present
on both duplicons and in an outgroup), lost (i.e. present
on one duplicon and in an outgroup) or gained (not
present in an outgroup). 74 loci were shared by both
duplicons and other species. 57 genes on Chromosome 4
were absent from Chromosome 8 but present in other
species, indicating that they were lost. Similarly, 27 genes
on Chromosome 8 and present in other species were
absent from Chromosome 4. Therefore, 47% of all duplicated loci were retained as paralogs on both duplicons.
Furthermore, 7 and 18 loci were present on Chromosomes 4 and 8 respectively, but absent from other species,
suggesting that they were independently gained postduplication. A detailed and interactive figure showing the
colinear gene order of the duplicons, and with links to the
T. brucei genome sequence, is available from the GeneDB
website [49], (also included here as Additional data file
1). Shared and lost genes appeared to differ in the presence of transmembrane helices (TMH) and putative signal
peptides. A two-sample t-test assuming heteroscedasticity
confirmed that conserved paralogs included significantly
more TMH (Âµ = 1.45, df = 102, p = 0.011) and signal peptides (Âµ = 0.2, df = 134, p = 0.033) than singleton genes.
It was concluded from comparison of T. brucei and T. congolense genome sequences that the segmental duplication
is restricted to T. brucei. It was initially observed that the
preliminary assembly for chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. congolense did include homoeologous regions to the T. brucei
duplicons. The putative duplicons in T. congolense showed
conserved synteny and numerous retained paralogs, as in
T. brucei. However, comparison of sequence divergence
between paralogs showed that the preliminary T. congolense genome sequence did not contain an ortholog for
each paralog seen in T. brucei, as expected if the duplication had occurred prior to speciation. Of 42 instances
where a locus had been duplicated and retained on both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/432

duplicons, by both species, the T. congolense 'paralogs'
were identical in nucleotide sequence in every case; furthermore, the intergenic sequences of 'paralogous' regions
were also identical. Further examination of the sequence
reads for T. congolense homologs identified putative alleles, but nothing to suggest the presence of orthologs to
both T. brucei duplicates. It is implausible that while T.
brucei paralogs have diverged considerably in most cases,
and intergenic regions have little or no affinity, the corresponding regions in T. congolense should have remained
entirely unchanged over the same time-span. With the
completion of the T. congolense genome, it will hopefully
become clear why preliminary assemblies reproduced the
structure of the T. brucei genome sequence; but T. congolense certainly does not display the evolutionary dynamics
seen in T. brucei and does not share in the effects of the
duplication event (in terms of the derivation of novel
genes).
(b) Sequence divergence of conserved paralogs
The remaining analyses dealt with the consequences of
segmental duplication for the divergence of conserved
paralogs present on both duplicons. There was considerable variation in the sequence identity between paralogs, as
shown in Additional data file 1 and recorded in Additional data file 2. There were instances of extreme conservation between paralogs, for example, a myosin heavy
chain kinase A showing 98% identity (26: Tb927.4.4970
and Tb927.8.7450), and of extreme divergence, for example, a monoglyceride lipase showing 39% identity (53:
Tb927.4.4360 and Tb927.8.8020). Other paralogous,
hypothetical genes showed as little as 5% identity (e.g., 7:
Tb927.4.5330 and Tb927.8.7060). Figure 2 shows a
bimodal frequency distribution of nucleotide sequence
identity for all shared paralogs. Coding sequences either
changed little, retaining 70â100% identity, or diverged to
around 40% identity; but there were low numbers of CDS
with identity at 50â60%, or less than 30%.

Sequence divergence among NCS was generally greater
and bimodality was more pronounced. There were paralogs with almost identical 5' and 3' untranscribed regions
(UTR), for instance, paralogous RNA polymerase IIA large
subunits (22: Tb927.4.5020 and Tb927.8.7400) had identical 3' UTRs over 400 bp; but highly divergent, indeed
unalignable, UTRs were a more typical observation. Figure
2 identifies many NCS with less than 25% identity, which
is no greater than expected by chance. These cases are
largely an expression of comparisons between unaligned
sequences; however, in some instances a part of the CDS
or NCS aligned well but constituted only a minor fraction
of the whole alignment, producing a value below 0.25.
This explains how paralogy was established between
sequences with less than 0.25 identity. The bimodality of
sequence divergence is further illustrated in Figure 3

where coding and non-coding identities for each paralogous gene pair are correlated. Both panels A and B, though
especially the 3' UTR comparison, clearly show gene pairs
consistent with a 1:1 relationship, including both conserved and divergent cases. However, in both cases there
was a deficit of gene pairs falling in the 0.6â0.8 range and
a surfeit of those falling into the bottom-right quadrant of
the graph. These cases have CDS identities between 0.6
and 0.8, but with much lower values for NCS. Once again,
many NCS values fell below 0.25, reflecting those
sequences that were unaligned. In summary, despite being
formed at the same time, divergence of duplicated coding
and non-coding sequences varied widely along the duplicons. The bimodality of divergence values indicated that
fewer duplicate sequences had diverged moderately than
expected; rather duplicates had remained largely
unchanged or become very different.
(c) Evolutionary rate asymmetry
Relative rates tests were used to analyse paralogous CDSs
for significant asymmetry in the rate of evolution postduplication; all results are shown in Additional data file 3.
Canonical relative rates tests identified 12 cases where one
paralog had evolved significantly faster; these are listed in
Table 1, and indicated by blue arrows in Additional data
file 1. Among these cases there were two gene pairs, 3methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (5: Tb927.4.5350 and
Tb927.8.6970) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase
(20: Tb927.4.5050 and Tb927.8.7380), where the rate
asymmetry coincided with apparent psuedogenisation of
one paralog. Elsewhere, monoglyceride lipase, noted
above as having exceptional sequence divergence also displayed rate asymmetry (in favour of the Chromosome 8
copy), as did paralogous tandem gene arrays of glycosyltransferase (57: Tb927.4.4290 and Tb927.8.8090) and
amino acid transporter genes (69: Tb927.4.4020 and
Tb927.8.8220). The largest asymmetry in evolutionary
rate occurred between paralogs of a mitotic centromerassociated
kinesin
(73:
Tb927.4.3910
and
Tb927.8.8350); the rate of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site for the Chromosome 4
lineage was 0.4386, compared with 0.6062 for the Chromosome 8 lineage (p = 1.00 Ã 10-7). The Bayesian relative
rates test was more conservative, identifying 4 cases of significant asymmetry that are detailed in Table 2; each of
these corroborated a significant result obtained using the
canonical test. A complete account of the Bayesian relative
rates tests is given in Additional data file 4.
(d) Non-neutral evolution
One factor capable of causing differential evolutionary
divergence between paralogs is natural selection. For all
genes along the duplicons, the action of selection on individual codons was examined using SLAC, FEL and REL
algorithms to calculate Ï. The T. congolense homolog was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/432

used as an outgroup comparison in these tests. Additional
file 5 shows the global Ï values for all loci, none of which
suggested net positive selection (i.e., Ï > 1). Most singleton loci and paralogous genes were under negative, purifying selection when compared to their T. congolense
homologs (i.e., Ï << 1), which was reflected in a leftskewed frequency distribution of global Ï and an average
value of 0.219 (Â± SD 0.099). Those paralogs showing
extreme deficits in non-synonymous substitutions (i.e., Ï
< 0.1) included an RNA polymerase IIA large subunit that
was generally well conserved (22: Tb927.4.5020 and
Tb927.8.7400), an ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase
(25: Tb927.4.4990 and Tb927.8.7430) and a translocating
pyrophosphatase
(51:
Tb927.4.4380
and
Tb927.8.7980), despite this being generally quite divergent. Although purifying selection was ubiquitous, FEL
and REL tests detected 12 and 41 positively-selected
codons respectively among both singleton loci and
retained paralogs. However, the incidence of positive
selection involving paralogous genes (and their outgroup)
was significantly higher than for singletons and their outgroups, when combining the two tests (p = 0.0125,
Fisher's exact test) or analysing them separately (FEL, p =
0.0059; REL, p = 0.051). Including an outgroup in these
tests meant that some cases of positive selection could
derive from the interspecific comparison, rather than the
duplication event. Hence, when the outgroup was
excluded, positive selection was detected in 21 duplicate
loci; Table 3 describes the results for 16 loci that included
positively-selected loci both with and without an outgroup comparison (these are also marked with red arrows
in Additional file 1).
Beyond the ratio of amino acid replacements to silent substitutions, other patterns of sequence divergence could
reflect non-neutral evolution. Paralogous sequences were
scored for the ratio of 'invariable' to 'variable' mutations
at non-synonymous and then synonymous sites. Significant disparity between these ratios was an indication of
non-neutral evolution and was detected in 15 cases at the
p = 0.01 level; these are shown in Table 4 and as green
arrows on Additional data file 1. Details for all loci are
shown in Additional data file 6. These comprised the tail
in an over-dispersed distribution of G statistics, meaning
that most cases showed negligible difference between substitution patterns at the distinct sites. Where significant
disparity was observed, this was generally due to an excess
of RI mutations, and there were four cases in particular
where the number of invariable mutations outnumbered
variable mutations at non-synonymous sites; these concerned three pairs of paralogous hypothetical genes: 6
(Tb927.4.5340 and Tb927.8.6980), 2 (Tb927.4.5380 and
Tb927.8.6940),
and
24
(Tb927.4.5000
and
Tb927.8.7420); as well as paralogs of a single-copy amino
acid transporter (40: Tb927.4.4730 and Tb927.8.7740).

Values in bold denote the paralogs with the faster evolutionary rate.

(e) Taxonomic distribution PCR assay
Three locations were selected where a shared paralog on
both chromosomes was followed downstream by different, single-copy genes on each duplicon. For each location, a genome containing both duplicons should yield
two distinct PCR products. The presence of both duplicons in other T. brucei strains would therefore be demonstrated by amplification of all six PCR products of the
correct size. Additional data file 7 shows that this was
observed in the subspecies to which the original genome
sequence belongs (T. b. brucei), but also in T. b. gambiense,
T. b. rhodiense and T. evansi, confirming that the duplication was common to all members of the T. brucei clade.

Discussion
The duplication of a chromosome-sized region of the T.
brucei genome was identified, based on the colinear gene
order along 0.5 MB regions of chromosomes 4 and 8.
Comparisons with homoeologous regions in other
trypanosomatids confirmed that the duplicated region
corresponded to the entire chromosome 31 in Leishmania
spp. and was unique to T. brucei. In addressing the aims of
this study, it has been shown that although substantial
gene loss occurred after duplication, 47% of all duplicated
loci had been retained as conserved paralogs. The functions of retained compared with deleted genes suggested
that gene loss was selective. Divergence of conserved paralogs was bimodal, particularly in the case of NCSs; UTRs
either remained highly conserved or were radically
remodelled. Sequence divergence was also characterised
by ubiquitous purifying selection, frequent rate asymmetry between paralogs and occasional positive selection,
which nonetheless occurred significantly more often
among duplicates than single-copy genes. So taken
together, the patterns of observed structural change suggested that at least some conserved paralogs were functionally innovative.
(a) Post-duplication effects on gene content
Duplication events of this kind have not previously been
recorded in trypanosomatid genomes. Karyotypic fluctuations appear to be reasonably frequent among trypano-

somatids; in T. brucei the infrequent nature of reductive
cell division produces triploid hybrid strains [50,51]; the
irregularity of genetic exchange in these organisms also
seems to cause widespread variation in ploidy in T. cruzi
[7]. Among Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp. fluctuations in repetitive, telomeric regions causes substantial
variation in chromosome size [4,5]. However, the effect of
these events seems to be restricted to karyotype, and has
not had permanent effects on genetic complement. The
duplication event recorded here differs in nature because
its effects on genetic complement go beyond spatio-temporal fluctuations in copy number; the duplicons evolved
through deletion of many genes, gain of a few others, and
widespread divergence of retained paralogs, to create a
novel and permanent addition to the T. brucei genome.
Such expansions in genetic complement through large
duplication events have emerged as primary evolutionary
catalysts from various taxa; both yeasts [18-20] and
angiosperms [14-17] are known to be palaeopolyploids,
while the possibility of successive whole-genome duplications in vertebrates continues to be debated [24,51-55].
Comparisons of completed genomes from these organisms are illuminating the mechanisms of large duplication events. Koszul et al. (2003) [56] examined reversion
to wild-type in Saccharomyces cerevisiae after enforcing a
growth defect; the majority of revertant strains resulted
from spontaneous duplication events, ranging in size
between 41 and 655 kb. This and other observations [57]
suggest that large duplication events result from damage
incurred during DNA replication and its subsequent
repair. The locations of such breakpoints in yeast also support the view that damage occurs at specific points of
weakness, for instance termination sites, repetitive regions
and those containing mobile elements [58,59]. Similarly,
in T. brucei, the upstream junction of the chromosome 4
duplicon comprised a 40 kb region with almost no open
reading frames but several mini-satellite loci and both
DIRE and RIME mobile elements.
Large duplication events make immediate additions to
genomic repertoire, many of which will prove lasting.

However, the conclusion from several model organisms is
that such events are typically followed by substantial gene
loss [11-18], often resulting in 'diploidisation' and the restoration of original gene number [22]. Unusually, almost
half of duplicated loci recorded here are retained as paralogs; this contrasts with 28.6% and just ~20% following

sativa [29] respectively, and perhaps 10% in yeast [61].
Such recognised WGD events are shared across species or
genera, and are undoubtedly ancient. By contrast, the
present case is apparently restricted to T. brucei and is certainly absent from other principal trypanosome clades. Its

cladistic distribution suggests that is a relatively recent
event, which may explain the large fraction of genes
retained in comparison with other large duplication
events. The fate of gene duplicates is complex and
depends both on taxon [27] and function, incorporating
protein complexity [62], dose sensitivity and 'connectivity' [60,63,64]. Some observations suggest that genes
encoding simpler products, with fewer interactions with
regulators or targets around the cell (i.e., lower 'connectivity'), are retained in duplicate more often. Hence, in yeast
complex proteins are retained less often as the number of
subunits increases [65], subunits of heterodimers are less
duplicable than those in homodimers [62] and there was
a negative relationship between 'connectivity' and retention after duplication [66]. The 'balance' hypothesis
explains such biases in terms of dose sensitivity [63]; effective gene expression depends on a dynamic equilibrium
of regulatory factors, which is perturbed by unilateral
duplications of regulatory genes or individual components of larger assemblages. Hence, genes that are more
peripheral to the regulatory environment and dose-insensitive, such as surface-expressed genes, may be retained
more often [66].

tion is large enough to include a gene plus all its interacting loci, or by deleting them, where the event has been
smaller. In T. brucei, retained paralogs were enriched with
TMH and signal peptides, showing that gene loss was
selective after duplication, resulting in preferential retention of surface expressed genes, (e.g., amino acid transporters,
adenylate
cyclases,
glycosyltransferases).
Although the large number of uncharacterised genes limits our ability to scrutinise gene loss by function, metabolic enzymes such as metallopeptidases, components of
the electron transfer chain, and various loci associated
with the RNA synthesis and modification featured prominently among deleted duplicates. This is consistent with
the preservation of dosage balance through deletion of
loci with high connectivity, and retention of dose-insensitive proteins on the cell surface. Indeed, the process of
removing dose-sensitive genes may be continuing
through pseudogenisation of duplicates such as a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (20: Tb927.8.7380). Prior
to duplication, this locus was duplicated in tandem; after
duplication, one copy was lost from chromosome 8 and
another is currently being deleted from chromosome 4,
thereby restoring the original copy number.

However, most analyses identifying selective gene loss
report enrichment of highly connected and expressed
genes, integral to cell function, for instance those associated with regulation, signal transduction, transcriptional
control and protein-protein interactions [26,27]; this can
apparently result in co-localisation of regulator and target
loci over time [60,67]. Yet, these studies have addressed
WGD events and the dosage balance hypothesis accommodates them if gene loss is considered scale-dependent
[68]. Dosage balance can be preserved either by retaining
all components of a regulatory network, where a duplica-

(b) Post-duplication effects on gene sequence
For those gene duplicates that are preserved, duplication
marks the beginning of genetic divergence. Paralogs will
diverge over time, unless gene conversion homogenises
their sequences at a much faster rate [46]. The speed and
magnitude of evolutionary change depends on the selective environment following duplication, the nature of
which is likely to vary by case. The role of adaptive evolution in neofunctionalisation and subfunctionalisation
models differs, but setting positive selection aside, the
common theoretical expectations are that evolutionary

rate should accelerate in one or both duplicates as functional change accumulates. Regulatory regions should
also be remodelled, either to effect functional change (i.e.,
under a DDC model) or to preserve it. In this case, most
features of sequence divergence â the prevalence of negative selection, rate asymmetry, and excessive numbers of
non-synonymous substitutions â indicate that post-duplication sequence change has been functional. At a basic

level, patterns of coding and non-coding sequence divergence displayed a deficit in moderate divergence, indicating that regulatory regions in particular remained
conserved or were entirely remodelled. Therefore, given
that paralogs could be conservative or innovative with
respect to both CDSs and NCSs, it follows that four types
of dynamics were observed, examples of which are listed
in Table 5.

First, for some duplicates both CDS and NCS experienced
few substitutions and remained structurally conserved.
Such loci included RNA polymerase IIA (22), dynein light
chain 2B (3), a 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (5), as
well as many other hypothetical genes where divergence
in either CDS or NCS did not exceed 5%. These cases suggest that some genes involved in core cellular functions
were retained to increase dose, and have been constrained
by strong purifying selection. The substantial divergence
of regulatory regions elsewhere makes a compelling argument for conservation of expression profile in these
instances. However, high sequence identity does not preclude important structural changes, since two examples of
this dynamic (24 and 2) also showed non-neutral substitution patterns, with significant excesses of 'constant-butdifferent' amino-acid replacements. This dynamic might
also occur where gene conversion homogenises gene copies in trans, although no evidence was seen for this here.
The second dynamic involved substantial divergence in
both CDS and NCS. These cases mostly involved hypothetical genes, which is intuitive since slowly-evolving
genes fundamental to cellular function are more likely to
be annotated; many possessed features indicative of surface-expression, and a GTP-binding rab protein (59)
showing 45% and 43% divergence in CDS and NCS
respectively was included. Since these paralogs often
diverged beyond recognition in parts of their structures,
such that functional conservation is implausible, they are
the best candidates for neofunctionalisation. Positive
selection was detected for individual codons at some loci
with this dynamic; for example 10, 12, 46, 62 and 71.
However, none of the paralogous sequences displayed a
global Ï above 1, and positive selection was not conspicuously strong. Documented cases of neofunctionalisation
are sparse, perhaps because it is easier to elucidate the
functional differences between gene duplicates when
sequence identity remains high. One instance, the evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins from trypsinogen-like
proteases in Antarctic notothenioid fish [69], demonstrates how gene duplication can be followed by fundamental remodelling of primary structures, involving the
loss of functional domains and very low sequence identities, of the magnitude recorded in T. brucei. At least two
conserved paralogs showed remodelling of this type, and
so are candidates for radical new functions. First, a kinetoplastid membrane protein (18: Tb927.4.5120 and
Tb927.8.7260) was substantially shortened on chromosome 8 relative to chromosome 4 (and orthologs in other
species), involving the deletion of a large repetitive Hint
domain and a GPI anchor signal; these features suggest a
membrane-bound signalling function that has been lost
by the chromosome 8 paralog. Second, a hypothetical
gene (72: Tb927.4.3920 and Tb927.8.8340) possessed a
lipid-binding domain and 12 transmembrane helices, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/432

latter were deleted from the chromosome 8 paralog, indicating that the protein had acquired a new position within
the cell.
The third dynamic combined divergence of NCS with conservation of coding regions. This kind of change might
indicate where regulation of a gene has evolved without
much structural change, perhaps resulting in a novel
expression profile. Genes in this category are mostly metabolic enzymes, e.g., protein kinase, lipase and phosphatase; these might be expected to evolve slowly with
respect to primary structure, but they offer interesting avenues for further investigation since their regulatory
regions have clearly been changed considerably. Several
previous cases have shown that innovation can occur
through changes to regulatory domains alone. Bhushan et
al. (2005) [70] described paralogous metallopeptidases in
A. thaliana with 75.6% protein identity but differential
expression in tissue-specific manner. Segregation of the
ancestral function between duplicates was achieved
through regulatory change (although some structural
change had also altered enzyme specificity), consistent
with a subfunctionalisation model. Hua et al. (2003) [71]
described a similar case in humans, where Nudt10 and
Nudt11 were recently duplicated phosphohydrolases, the
former expressed in liver, kidney and testis and the latter
restricted to brain. However, these copies were identical at
the protein level. Indeed, the evolution of proteins under
strong structural constraints, such as Hox genes [72,73]
through changes to cis-acting regulatory modules provides
the most comprehensive evidence that subfunctionalisation via this mechanism is a general principle.
In the final dynamic coding regions diverged, while
untranslated regions remained structurally conserved.
Given that non-coding regions are typically less affected
by negative selection, it is intuitive that this outcome was
rare. Table 5 shows that in two cases non-coding regions
were conserved (90% and 98% respectively), while CDS
divergence was greater, but only considerably so for one
hypothetical gene (63), likely to be involved in signal
transduction. There was no evidence of significant rate
asymmetry or non-neutral substitutions between these
paralogous pairs, and so it seems more likely that strong
selection to preserve regulatory regions was responsible
for the dynamic. Therefore, these loci might represent odd
examples of structural derivation in the absence of
changes to expression profiles.
In summary, the diverse divergence rates observed,
(despite the time of separation being constant), the
instances of contrary divergence patterns in CDS and
NCS, as well as significantly asymmetric change or adaptive substitutions among many paralogous pairs, all sug-

gest that the duplication event had equally diverse
functional consequences.

Conclusion
The T. brucei clade has been affected by the duplication
and transposition of a large chromosomal block, perhaps
due to a mistake during cell division. For events of this
type, a surprisingly large proportion of gene duplicates
were subsequently retained, including gene families
known to be important at the host-parasite interface.
Gene loss was selective, since surface-expressed genes were
over-represented among conserved paralogs; this is consistent with a dosage balance hypothesis in which genes
with low 'connectivity' within the cell are more likely to be
preserved after segmental duplications because they are
dose-insensitive. Sequence divergence of conserved paralogs followed several different evolutionary trajectories,
sometimes accompanied by significant asymmetry in substitution rate and significant excesses of amino acid
replacements, and generally more prone to adaptive evolution than singleton loci. Indeed, the structural change
among coding and regulatory regions of conserved paralogs was often radical, providing strong indications that
many of these cases involved functional change. The functional consequences of this duplication will become clear
as hypothetical genes are annotated and the biological differences between paralogs investigated. However, by demonstrating considerable gene retention and structural
divergence, this study has established that the duplication
made a significant contribution to the genomic repertoire
of T. brucei, relative to other trypanosomatids, and was a
seminal development in its genomic evolution.

Methods
(a) Examination of the duplicated regions
The extent of colinearity between Chromosomes 4 and 8
in T. brucei was assessed using the Artemis Comparison
Tool v5 (ACT [74]). A tBLASTx algorithm [75] was used to
create a sequence comparison from EMBL files of the two
chromosomes. The duplicated regions of Chromosomes 4
and 8 were inspected visually from the GeneDB chromosome maps page [76], to determine the gene order on
each duplicon and affinity shown by each paralogous
gene pair. Sequence identity was calculated as the proportion of amino acids conserved when paralogous genes
were aligned in BioEdit [77]. Inspection of homologs in
Leishmania major showed that the duplicated region in T.
brucei corresponded to the complete Chromosome 31 in
L. major. The gene order in L. major (and another related
trypanosome, T. cruzi) was used to infer the gene order on
the chromosome ancestral to the duplicons on Chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. brucei. If present on both duplicons
and either outgroup, a locus was shared, i.e., originally
single-copy and now retained as two paralogs. If present
on one duplicon and either outgroup, the locus was con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/432

sidered to have been present on the ancestral chromosome and lost after duplication from the either duplicon.
If present on one duplicon but absent from either outgroup, this was interpreted as gain of a locus after duplication. Situations were both duplicons retained a locus that
was absent in both L. major and T. cruzi were not
observed. The duplicated regions in T. brucei were also
compared to homologous regions in its closest relative, T.
congolense. If it could be shown that T. congolense possessed duplicate copies for the loci in these regions, this
would show that the duplication occurred prior to the
separation of these two species. Gene order along the T.
brucei duplicons was compared with preliminary assemblies for chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. congolense (available
from GeneDB).
(b) Analysis of divergence of paralogous sequences
Patterns in sequence divergence post-duplication were
analysed by comparing the identity shown by coding
regions of paralogous gene pairs with that shown by noncoding regions. Untranslated regions of genes were identified from genomic sequence in Artemis v8 [78] after
identifying the sequence motifs for spliced leader and
poly-A tail additions, established previously [79]. These
motifs signal the creation of individual transcripts from
nascent polycistronic transcripts; they are arranged in a
fairly consistent manner, with a polypyrimidine tract providing the signal for poly-A tail addition (i.e., the end of
the 3' UTR), and the next downstream AG dinucleotide
signalling for the addition of the spliced leader sequence
(i.e., the start of the 5' UTR) [79]. Determination of these
points for each paralogous gene pair allowed sequence
identity to be calculated for coding, 5'UTR and 3'UTR
regions respectively. If paralogous non-coding regions
could be aligned, nucleotide identity was calculated from
the alignment; if not, a nominal value was calculated from
unaligned sequences. In both cases, sequences were
trimmed to equal length since length differences would
reduce sequence identity overall.
(c) Relative rates tests
Significant departures in evolutionary rate post-duplication were identified using the relative rates test [80,81].
Paralogous gene pairs were combined in a sequence alignment with a homolog from T. cruzi (or where this was
absent, T. vivax), retrieved from GeneDB, and designated
as an outgroup comparison. The rates of non-synonymous substitutions per site (Dn) between each paralog
and an outgroup were compared using RRTree [82]; synonymous substitutions were not compared since these
were frequently saturated over the relatively large evolutionary distances concerned. Due to the various weaknesses of the canonical, i.e., Wu-Li, relative rates test, a
Bayesian approach was adopted as previously described
[83]). The genetic distance between each paralog and the

Page 13 of 17

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:432

most recent common ancestor of all three sequences was
estimated using Cadence [83]; this was calculated from
5000 Bayesian phylogenies to estimate 95% confidence
intervals. Significant differences in evolutionary rate were
inferred where these confidence intervals did not overlap.
(d) Tests for non-neutral evolution
Paralogous CDS sequences were analysed for evidence of
adaptive evolution using two methods. First, alignments
were generated for each pair of paralogous sequences and
for each singleton locus along the duplicated region, in
combination with their T. congolense homologs. The latter
were included to allow the singleton loci to be analysed
and directly compared with conserved paralogs. The ratio
of non-synonymous substitutions per site (Dn) to synonymous substitutions per site (Ds), referred to as Ï, was calculated for each codon of each alignment using the
adaptive evolution server [84], within the HYPHY platform [85]. Three methods were used to detect both positive and negative selection at individual codons: i) SingleLikelihood-Ancestor-Counting (SLAC), ii) Fixed-EffectLikelihood (FEL) and iii) Random-Effects-Likelihood
(REL), which have been described in detail elsewhere
[86]. The inclusion of a T. congolense homolog as an outgroup sequence could introduce or obscure further evidence for selection, hence, conserved paralogs were tested
again without an outgroup, using the REL method.

Second, paralogous sequences were aligned with
homologs from related trypanosomatids (T. congolense, T.
vivax, T. cruzi, as appropriate and where available) and
used to create a phylogenetic tree and reconstruct ancestral sequences. This was done using CRANN [87], which
applies the method of [88]. The frequencies of invariant
(i.e., change once but not again) and variable (change frequently) mutations at both non-synonymous and synonymous sites were calculated along the branches leading to
each paralog from their inferred ancestor. The ratios of
invariant to variable mutations at non-synonymous and
synonymous sites were calculated; significant differences
between these values were identified using a G-test. Significant differences due to an excess of invariant mutations at
non-synonymous sites ('replacement-invariable', or RI)
indicate adaptive change [89,90], in essence because the
ratio at synonymous sites represents the expectation
under neutral conditions, and the ratio at non-synonymous sites should be not significantly different in the
absence of positive selection.

b. gambiense (Dal 972), T. b. rhodiense (LVH 108) and T.
evansi (RoTat 1.2). Three locations along the duplicated
region were selected where there was a shared paralog followed downstream by distinct single-copy genes (i.e., lost
from one chromosome) on each duplicon. For each location, a common forward primer and dissimilar reverse
primers were used to amplify the two distinct intergenic
regions from each T. brucei subspecies. Successful amplification of products with expected size confirmed that both
duplicons were present. Genomic DNA was denatured at
92Â°C for 2 minutes and then 35 amplification cycles were
performed under the following conditions: denaturation
at 92Â°C (30 seconds), annealing at 60Â°C (10 seconds)
and extension at 72Â°C (90 seconds). The locus, forward
primer, chromosome 4-specific reverse primer (with
expected product size), and chromosome 8-specific
reverse primer (with expected product size) are given for
each location in turn. Location 1: 14 (Tb927.4.5180 and
