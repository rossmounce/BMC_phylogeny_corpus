Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the antifungal compounds from the extracts of
Schinus terebinthifolius (Anacardiaceae) against clinical isolates of the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
Methods: The hexane and dichlomethane fractions from leaves and stems of S. terebinthifolius were fractionated
using several chromatography techniques to afford four compounds.
Results: The compounds isolated from S. terebinthifolius were identified as schinol (1), a new biphenyl compound,
namely, 4’-ethyl-4-methyl-2,2’,6,6’-tetrahydroxy[1,1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-dicarboxylate (2), quercetin (3), and kaempferol (4).
Compounds 1 and 2 were active against different strains of P. brasiliensis, showing a minimal inhibitory
concentration value against the isolate Pb B339 of 15.6 μg/ml. The isolate Pb 1578 was more sensitive to
compound 1 with a MIC value of 7.5 μg/ml. Schinol presented synergistic effect only when combined with
itraconazole. The compounds isolated from S. terebinthifolius were not able to inhibit cell wall synthesis or
assembly using the sorbitol assay.
Conclusion: This work reveals for the first time the occurrence of compound 2 and discloses activity of
compounds 1 and 2 against several clinical isolates of P. brasiliensis. These results justify further studies to clarify
the mechanisms of action of these compounds.

Background
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus occurring in Central and South America, is responsible for
paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), an endemic disease that
could affect at least 10 million people in Latin America
[1]. However, notification of its occurrence is not compulsory in the countries where it is endemic, hence
accurate figures regarding the disease incidence and prevalence are difficult to determine [2]. PCM is a pulmonary infection characterized by cutaneous and/or mucosal
lesions that can disseminate to other organs [3]. This
disease constitutes an important health problem in

Brazil and had also been found in Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador and Argentina [1].
Two forms of the disease have been described in the
literature: the acute (subacute) juvenile form and the
chronic adult form; the former runs a faster course and
is more severe than the latter [4]. However, in both
cases, cell-mediated immune functions are abnormal
and, in the absence of specific therapy, mortality is high.
Even if improvements are observed in patients after specific treatment, lesions usually remain as sequels [5].
The disease may develop either directly from a primary
focus with no latency period or, more commonly, by
reactivation of quiescent infections [1].
The drugs most commonly used for treating patients
with PCM are sulfonamides, ketoconazole, itraconazole,
and amphotericin B. Sulfonamides were the first class of

drugs available for treating patients with PCM, but long
periods of treatment may be required (more than 2
years), with increasing concern about drug toxicity, cost
of treatment, and unacceptable rates of noncompliance
with therapy [1,6,7]. Unfortunately, amphotericin B has
been associated with substantial toxicity. Although itraconazole and ketoconazole are effective against P. brasiliensis, a long duration of therapy and sometimes a
lifelong secondary prophylaxis are required, especially in
AIDS patients with high relapse incidence [3].
With the aim of discovering new drug leads that could
result in new chemotherapeutic or chemoprophylatic
agents to combat P. brasiliensis infectitons, our group
screened Brazilian medicinal plant’s extracts against isolates of P. brasiliensis [8]. Among these plants, Schinus
terebinthifolius showed strong activity against clinical isolates of P. brasiliensis. S. terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) is a perennial tree occurring in the Brazilian coast.
It is known by a variety of common names, e.g., “aroeiravermelha” and “aroeira pimenteira” [9]. Many biological
properties for this medicinal plant were described in the
literature: antioxidant and wound-healing [10], antitumoral [9], and antimicrobial activities [11-13,8]. We report
herein for first time the investigation of natural products
isolated from this plant using in vitro assays with
P. brasiliensis.

hexane fraction (HEX-L), 5.0 g of a dichloromethane
fraction (DCM-L), and 6.6 g of the ethyl acetate fraction
(EA-L), and 15.2 g of the aqueous fraction (AQ-L). The
plant stems (250 g) were submitted to the same procedure resulting in 1.0 g (HEX-S), 3.2 g (DCM-S), 0.8 g
(EA-S), and 4.8 g (AQ-S) fractions, respectively [13,8].
Instruments (General procedures)

Five clinical P. brasiliensis strains, Pb01 (ATCC- MYA826), PbB339 (ATCC 32069), Pb18 (Faculty of Medicine,
Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), Pb3 (clinical isolate from chronic PCM, São Paulo, Brazil- MHH
Forjaz/TIE Svidzinski), and Pb1578 (clinical isolate
PCM, Goiás, Brazil, kindly provided by Dr. Maristela
Pereira, Universidade Federal de Goiás) were used in the
biological assays. The strains of P. brasiliensis were
maintained by continuous passages in YPD (yeast, peptone and dextrose) medium at 37°C. The fungi were
used after 7-10 days of growth.

Silica gel Merck 60G (70-230 mesh) was used for column chromatography and silica gel pre-coated plates
Merck 60F254 were used for thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). The spots on TLC were visualized under UV at
254 and 366 nm and also after spraying with vanillinH 2 SO 4 and heating at 120°C for 10 min. Plates were
sprayed with NP-PEG (polyethylene glycol reagent for
visualization of flavonoids. Gel filtration was run on columns filled with Sephadex LH-20. Analytical HPLC
(high-performance liquid chromatography) were run on
a Shimadzu chromatograph equipped with a LC10AD
pump, a dual wavelength detector set to 210 nm and
240 nm, and using a Shim-pack C18 column (5 μm particle size, 4.6 × 250 mm) at a 1 ml/min flow rate. Semipreparative HPLC was run on the same equipment
described above using a Shim-pack C18 (5 μm particle
size, 20 × 250 mm) column and 10 ml/min flow rate.
Pro-analysis and HPLC grade solvents were purchased
from Vetec (São Paulo, Brazil) and Sigma Chemical Co
(St. Louis, USA), respectively. The ESI-MSn mass spectra were obtained on an ion trap LCQ Advantage
(Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer operating in the positive and negative ion modes
with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The samples were injected directly into the ESI source using the
equipment micro syringe. The heated capillary temperature was 200°C, the sheath gas flow rate set to 20 arbitrary units, and spray voltage regulated to 4.5 kV. 1D
and 2D NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra
were recorded in CD 3 OD and DMSO-d 6 on a Bruker
Avance DRX 400 MHz spectrometer, using tetrametilsylane as internal standard.

Plant material

Chromatographic fractionation of the extracts

The aerial parts of S. terebinthifolius (germplasm bank
number 44) were collected at EPAGRI (Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina),
Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil, in January 2004.

HEX-L (1 g) was chromatographed on a column (46 × 3
cm) filled with 60 g of silica gel eluted with mixtures of
hexane-methanol of increasing polarity. Seventy-four fractions were collected and tested against P. brasiliensis (isolate Pb18). The fractions 10-15 were grouped (26 mg) and
fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Shim-pack C18 5 μm, 20 ×
250 mm column using a gradient of MeOH-water (90100% of MeOH for 20 min) at flow rate 10 ml min-1 and
the absorbance of the effluent measured at 210 and
240 nm. This procedure afforded 15.0 mg of compound 1.
DCM-S (3 g) was injected in a 46 × 3 cm column containing 200 g of silica gel and eluted with a step-gradient

Methods
Maintenance of P. brasiliensis strains

Extract preparation

The dried leaves (400 g) were extracted by maceration
in four liter of ethanol 80% during ten days. After solvent elimination, 36 g of a hydroalcoholic extract (HAL) was obtained. This extract was then partitioned
between water and, successively, with hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate, resulting in 1.4 g of an

Johann et al. Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2010, 9:30
http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/9/1/30

of hexane-methanol of increasing polarity. The collected
fractions (127) were combined according to their TLC
profile in 37 groups. All groups were tested against
P. brasiliensis (Pb18) and the majority showed antifungal
activity. Group 23 (249 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC in
acetonitrile-water gradient from 10 to 50% in 40 min and
from 50 to 100% in 10 min, the effluent absorbance was
monitored at 220 nm and 240 nm. This experiment
yielded three fractions which were subjected to gel filtration in a 30 × 2 cm column filled with Sephadex LH-20
and eluted with MeOH at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. In this
way it was possible to isolate 17.0 mg of compound 2
and 15.0 mg of compound 3 and compound 4 (2.6 mg).
Antifungal activity
Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)

The bioassay with all isolates of P. brasiliensis was performed following CLSI M27-A 2 guidelines [14] and
modifications suggested by Nakai et al. [15] and Johann
et al. [8]. Amphotericin B (Sigma, St Louis, USA) and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SMT/TMP) (Ducto,
Brazil) were included as positive antifungal controls.
The concentrations of 25-0.03 μg/ml for amphotericin B
and 600-1.17 μg/ml for SMT/TMP were used. Their
stock solutions were prepared in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) and water, respectively, from which twofold serial
dilutions were prepared as described in the CLSI document M 27-A2 [14].
Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC)

The in vitro minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of
each compound tested was determined by streaking
10 μl from each well that showed complete inhibition
(100% inhibition or a clear well), from the last positive
well (growth similar to that of the growth control well),
and from the growth control well onto YPD plates. The
plates were incubated at 37°C for 7 days only. The lowest drug concentration at which no colonies were able
to grow was taken as the MFC value [16].
Sorbitol protection assay

MIC values were determined for the P. brasiliensis isolate Pb18 using the standard broth microdilution procedure described above. Duplicate plates were prepared:
one containing twofold dilutions (from 1000 to 7.8 μg/
ml) of compounds 1 and 2 and the other containing
compounds 1 and 2 plus 0.8 M sorbitol. MICs were
evaluated after 7 and 10 days of incubation [17].
Checkerboard microtiter test

Eight serial twofold dilutions (from 1000 to 7.8 μg/ml)
of compounds 1 and 2 and amphotericin B (from 1 to
0.007 μg/ml) were prepared with the same solvents used
in the MIC test. The checkerboard was prepared in
microtiter plate for multiple combinations of two antimicrobial agents. Each row (x axis) in the plate contained the same diluted concentration of the first

Page 3 of 6

antimicrobial compound; while the concentration in
each subsequent row was half this value. Similarly each
column (y axis) in the plate contained the same diluted
concentration of the second antimicrobial compound;
while the concentration in each subsequent column was
half this value. The drug combination in which the
growth is completely inhibited was taken as effective
MIC for the combination [18].
A 100-μl suspension of Pb18, the same isolate used in
the MIC test, was added to each well and cultured for
14 days. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were
calculated as the MIC of the combination of amphotericin
B and compounds 1 and 2 divided by the MIC of compounds 1 and 2 or AMB amphotericin B alone. The FIC
index was calculated by adding both FICs and this was
interpreted in the following manner: a synergistic effect
when its value is ≤0.5; no interaction when the value falls
within the >0.5 to 4.0 range; and antagonistic effect when
it is >4.0. This experiment was also performed to determine the effect of a combination of active compounds
with SMT/TMP and itraconazole (Janssen-Cilag) [19-21].

Results
The hexane (HEX-L) and dichloromethane (DCM-S) fractions of crude extracts from stems and leaves of
S. terebinthifolius were selected for chemical fractionation
because they exhibited the strongest activities against isolates Pb01, Pb18, and PbB339 of P. brasiliensis and had
not presented any toxicity to murine macrophages [8].
The activity of crude extracts of steam and leaves was
noted at 30 μg/ml for the three isolates de P. brasiliensis
aforesaid. For fractions HEX-L the activity was noted at
15.2- 125 μg/ml for the isolates tested and for DCM-S the
activity was at 30 μg/ml. However, the fractions EA-S, EAL, aqueous steam and aqueous leaves did not present good
activity with MIC values of 125-1000 μg/ml for EA fractions and 625-1000 μg/ml for aqueous fractions against
isolates Pb01, Pb18, and PbB339 of P. brasiliensis.
After several chromatographic procedures, compound 1
was isolated from the HEX-L fraction of S. terebinthifolius.
Compounds 2, 3, and 4 were isolated from the DCM-S
fraction. Their spectral data (ESI-MS, NMR, UV) were
obtained; analysis and comparison with data from the
literature allowed us to identify 1 as schinol; 2 as 4’-ethyl4-methyl-2,2’,6,6’-tetrahydroxy[1,1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-dicarboxylate; 3 as quercetin; and 4 as kaempferol (Additional
file 1).
Compounds 1 and 2 (Figure 1) showed antifungal
activity at concentrations ≤250 μg/ml against five isolates
of P. brasiliensis (Table 1). Compound 1 displayed activity for the majority of the isolates of P. brasiliensis, with
MIC values varying from 7.5 to 125 μg/ml. The flavonols
3 and 4 were inactive at the highest concentration tested
(250 μg/ml).

decreased four times, indicating a synergistic effect (fractional inhibiting concentration index = 0.5) between
these substances. No synergy could be observed for the
other combinations.

Discussion
In a previous work, our group detected the activity of
crude extracts from leaves and stems of S. terebinthifolius
against clinical isolates of P. brasiliensis, Cryptococcus
neoformans, Sporothrix schenkii, and five clinical relevant
species of Candida [13,8]. The antimicrobial activity of
the crude extract from the leaves of S. terebinthifolius
against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and C. albicans has
been reported elsewhere [12].
According to Johann et al. [13] the leaf extract of
S. terebinthifolius showed the presence of saponins, flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids, and tannins. Loyd et al. [22]

reported the presence of sesqui- and triterpenes. The tetracyclic triterpene schinol (1) was first isolated by Kaistha
and Kier [23]. It was further isolated from other plant
species such as Juliana adstringens (Julianiaceae) [24].
We describe here for the first time the isolation and
identification of compound 2 (4’-ethyl-4-methyl-2,6,2’,6’tetrahydroxy[1,1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-dicarboxylate, for NMR
data (Additional file 1). This new biphenyl compound is
a positional isomer of 4’-ethyl-4-methyl-2,6,3’,5’-tetrahydroxy[1,1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-dicarboxylate, a compound
already isolated from fruits of S. terebinthifolius [25].
This was the first report of the isolation of the flavonols
quercetin (3) and kaempferol (4) from S. terebinthifolius.
However, both compounds have already been described
among species of the genus Schinus [26].
When the activity of the compounds isolated in this
work is compared to the activity of the extracts and fractions of the S. terebinthifolius [8], it is possible to notice
that the activity of the 1 (7.5-62.5 μg/ml) was better than
the original fraction HE-L (15.2-125 μg/ml). These results
suggest that 1 could be the main active compound, since
the other fractions did not present important activity.
The activity of the original fraction of the compound
2 was 15.6-125 μg/ml and the crude extract (DCM-S)
was 30 μg/ml, thus, other active compounds could be
present and by means of synergism, have greater
potency than isolated compounds.
The isolates Pb1578 and PbB339 were more sensitive
to compounds 1 and 2, respectively; they were also more
susceptible to SMT/TMP when compared with other isolates of P. brasiliensis. Pb01 was the isolate most resistant
to compound 1 (150 μg/ml), while isolates Pb18 and Pb 3
were more resistant to compound 2. In the present work
we tested fungal isolates of P. brasiliensis of 2 distinct
cryptic phylogenetic species: S1 (Pb18) and PS2 (Pb03)
[27]. Pb01 and Pb1578 are known as isolates representative of a new phylogenetic species Pb-01-like [28]. Teixeira et al. [28] recommended the formal description of

Page 5 of 6

the “Pb-01-like” cluster as the new species Paracoccidioides lutzii.
In the present work, compound 4 (kaempferol) did not
present any antifungal activity. However, glucosylated
derivates of kaempferol such as 3-O-b-D-glycopyranosyl
(1®2)-O-b-D-glucopyranosil (1®2)-O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1®6)]-b-D glucopyranoside showed activity
against different isolates of Fusarium oxysporum [29].
Yordanov et al. [30] showed that kaempferol is a potential inhibitor of the virulent factors (lipolytic and proteinase activities) responsible for the penetration of C.
albicans into human cells.
Báidez et al. [31] have shown that quercetin (3) exhibits activity against Phytophthora megasperma and
Cylindrocarpon destructans. However, in the present
work, we found that this compound did not present any
activity against P. brasiliensis.
Antifungal activity may be due to interference in the
cell wall synthesis or assembly. A distinctive feature of
compounds acting on the fungal cell wall is that the antifungal effect can be reversed in a medium containing an
osmotic stabilizer such as sorbitol. Compounds 1 and 2
were tested on the isolate Pb18 of P. brasiliensis in the
presence of sorbitol and showed MIC values similar to
those of the medium without sorbitol. This result suggests that these compounds may be exerting their antifungal activity via mechanisms other than the inhibition
of the cell wall synthesis or assembly. Thus, new experiments are needed in order to determine the mechanism
of action of these compounds against P. brasiliensis.
Use of combined antifungal drugs with different active
mechanisms could be a promising therapeutic approach.
In our study, we could confirm the antifungal of schinol
as well as the synergistic effect between schinol and itraconazole in P. brasiliensis. The synergistic effect
between schinol and itraconazole might be clinically
useful and valuable because itraconazole has a long
duration of therapy [3].

Conclusion
In the present work, the aerial parts of S. terebinthifolius furnished two antifungal compounds active on P.
brasiliensis: schinol (1), and new biphenyl identified as
4’-ethyl-4-methyl-2,2’,6,6’-tetrahydroxy[1,1’-biphenyl]4,4’-dicarboxylate (2). These natural products will be
further studied to evaluate their toxicity and to elucidate their mechanism of action.
