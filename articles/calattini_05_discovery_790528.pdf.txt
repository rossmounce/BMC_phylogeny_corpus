Abstract
Human T-cell Leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) are pathogenic retroviruses
that infect humans and cause severe hematological and neurological diseases. Both viruses have
simian counterparts (STLV-1 and STLV-2). STLV-3 belongs to a third group of lymphotropic viruses
which infect numerous African monkeys species. Among 240 Cameroonian plasma tested for the
presence of HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 antibodies, 48 scored positive by immunofluorescence.
Among those, 27 had indeterminate western-blot pattern. PCR amplification of pol and tax regions,
using HTLV-1, -2 and STLV-3 highly conserved primers, demonstrated the presence of a new
human retrovirus in one DNA sample. tax (180 bp) and pol (318 bp) phylogenetic analyses
demonstrated the strong relationships between the novel human strain (Pyl43) and STLV-3 isolates
from Cameroon. The virus, that we tentatively named HTLV-3, originated from a 62 years old
Bakola Pygmy living in a remote settlement in the rain forest of Southern Cameroon. The plasma
was reactive on MT2 cells but was negative on C19 cells. The HTLV 2.4 western-blot exhibited a
strong reactivity to p19 and a faint one to MTA-1. On the INNO-LIA strip, it reacted faintly with
the generic p19 (I/II), but strongly to the generic gp46 (I/II) and to the specific HTLV-2 gp46. The
molecular relationships between Pyl43 and STLV-3 are thus not paralleled by the serological
results, as most of the STLV-3 infected monkeys have an "HTLV-2 like" WB pattern. In the context
of the multiple interspecies transmissions which occurred in the past, and led to the present-day
distribution of the PTLV-1, it is thus very tempting to speculate that this newly discovered human
retrovirus HTLV-3 might be widespread, at least in the African continent.

Findings
Three types of Primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses
(PTLVs) have been discovered so far in primates [1]. While
two of them i.e. PTLV-1 and PTLV-2 include human
(HTLV-1, HTLV-2) and simian (STLV-1, STLV-2) viruses,

the third type (STLV-3) consists only, so far, of simian
strains. Sequence comparisons of STLV-3 proviruses indicated that these strains are highly divergent from HTLV-1
(60% nucleotide similarity), HTLV-2 (62%), or STLV-2
(62%) prototype sequences. In all phylogenetic analyses,

STLV-3 viruses cluster in a highly supported group, indicating an evolutionary lineage independent from PTLV-1
and PTLV-2. Nevertheless, STLV-3 lineage is composed of
at least three subtypes that are corresponding more or less
to the geographical origin of the virus (East, West or Central Africa) [2-9]. Most of the viruses belonging to the
PTLV-1 type cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages according to their species of origin. Their
intermixing has therefore been inferred as an evidence for
past or recent interspecies transmission episodes. The
hypothesis of viral transmission from monkeys to
humans is supported by an increasing number of observations [1]. Thus, it has been proposed that HTLV strains
related to STLV-3 might infect human populations living
in areas where STLV-3 is present.
Cameroon has a remarkable diversity of retroviruses. All
the subtypes of HIV-1 group M (A to H) are present, subtype-recombinant strains co-circulate, and HIV-1 groups
O and N have been reported. Besides, HTLV-1 subtypes B
and D as well as HTLV-2 type A and B are also present in
Cameroonian individuals, while STLV-1 and STLV-3
strains have been isolated from several non-human primates (NHPs) species living in this region [3,4,8]. We
therefore conducted a study to search for HTLV variants in
Cameroonian individuals with HTLV-1/2 indeterminate
serology. This survey was approved by both the national
(Cameroon Ministry of Health and their National Ethics
committee) and local authorities (village chief) with
information to each participant. An oral informed consent was obtained from each participant (adults or parents
for minors). A series of 240 blood samples was obtained
from Bakola (n = 64) and Baka (n = 65) Pygmies, while
others (n = 111) were obtained from Bantous (mainly
from the Fang, Mvae and Ngumba tribes). All these individuals (117 women and 123 men, mean age 44, range
10–75 years) live in remote villages in the rain forest area
of the Southern part of Cameroon.
The 240 plasma were tested at a 1/40 dilution for the presence of HTLV-1/2 antibodies with a highly sensitive
immunofluorescence test (IF), that uses MT2 and C19 as
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viral antigen producing cells respectively. This test also allows the detection of STLV-3 positive samples [4,5]. The 48 plasma that were IF reactive on
MT2, C19 or both, were further tested by western blot
(WB HTLV BLOT 2.4; Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore).
Among the 48 samples tested, 4 and 11 WB patterns were
very evocative of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection respectively, while 27 exhibited diverse HTLV incomplete patterns, including some HTLV-1 indeterminate gag profile
(HGIP). Six samples were WB negative. High-molecular
weight DNA was extracted from the 48 blood samples and
was first subjected to PCR using human β-globin specific
primers, to ensure that DNA was amplifiable. They were

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/30

then subjected to two series of PCR using degenerated tax
and pol primers designed on highly conserved regions that
are common to all PTLVs. The tax primers are the following: SCTaxoutse: 5'-CTHTAYGGRTACCCHGTCTACGT-3'
and SCTaxoutas: 5'-AGGGGAGBCGAGGGATAAGG-3'
corresponding to nucleotides 7279 to 7301 and 7455 to
7474 respectively of the prototype STLV-3PHA969 sequence
(GenBank accession number Y07616). The pol primers are
SCPOL1outse: 5'-TTAAACCDGARCGCCTCCAGGC-3' (nt
2485 to 2506) SCPOL1outas: 5'-GGDGTDCCYTTRGAGACCCA-3' (nt 3201 to 3220) and SCPOL1inse: 5'-TAYHHAGGRCCAGGMAATAACCC-3' (nt 2556 to 2578).
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 tax sequences were obtained for 4
and 11 samples which exhibited complete HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2 WB profiles respectively, but none of the WB
indeterminate sample gave a PCR signal. Consistent
results were obtained for these HTLV-1 and HTLV-2
strains with the pol semi-nested PCR. However, a faint
band (665 bp) was also obtained for one sample (Pyl43),
which was previously found to be tax PCR negative.
Sequencing of this fragment indicated the presence of an
HTLV pol sequence that is highly related to STLV-3 strains
(86.6% to 99.2% nucleotide identity). Based on an alignment of different STLV-3 sequences, a tax semi-nested
PCR was then designed using SCTaxoutse (see above) and
Mac4 followed by Mac2 and Mac4 as inner primers [10].
This allowed the amplification of a 279 bp fragment
which was also found to be highly homologous to STLV3 strains (92.4% to 99.6% nucleotide identity). We did
two phylogenetic analyses (tax and pol) with the neighbor
joining method. Assessment of a 180-bp tax sequence
(Figure 1) or of a 665-bp pol region (data not shown)
demonstrated a strong relationship between Pyl43 and
STLV-3 strains from Cameroon.
The HTLV-3 sample originated from a 62 years old Bakola
Pygmy living in a remote settlement in the ocean department of Southern Cameroon. His plasma was reactive on
MT2 cells (titer: 1/320) but was negative on C19 cells. The
HTLV BLOT 2.4 WB [11] exhibited a strong reactivity to
p19 and a faint one to MTA-1 (Figure 2A). On the INNOLIA strip (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) [12], it reacted
faintly (+/-) with the generic p19 (I/II), but strongly to the
generic env gp46 (I/II) and to the specific HTLV-2 gp46
(Figure 2B). Surprisingly, the close molecular relationship
between Pyl43 and STLV-3 is thus not paralleled by the
serological results, as most of the STLV-3 infected monkeys have an "HTLV-2 like" WB pattern (p24 > to p19 with
or without K55) (Figure 2A, lanes 3–4) [2-9].
In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this report the
presence of a new human retrovirus in the peripheral
blood cells of a Central African native. This virus is closely
related to STLV-3. In the context of multiple interspecies

HTLV-3 is closely related to STLV-3. Unrooted phylogenetic tree generated with the Neighbor-joining method,
performed in the PAUP program (v4.0b10), on a 180 bp fragment of the tax gene using all full length PTLV-1/2 available
sequences and all published STLV-3 tax sequences. The
PTLV-1/2/3 strains, including (in bold), the novel sequence
generated in this work (Pyl43), were aligned with the
DAMBE program (version 4.2.13). The final alignment was
submitted to the Modeltest program (version 3.6) to select,
according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the
best model to apply to phylogenetic analyses. The selected
model was the TrN+G. Bootstrap support (1,000 replicates)
is noted on the branches of the tree. The branch lengths are

transmissions that have occurred in the past and led to the
present-day distribution of the PTLV-1 [1], we suggest that
HTLV-3 might be widespread, throughout the African
continent. HTLV-3 infection seems to be reflected by an
HTLV indeterminate serological WB pattern. This raises an
important public health question regarding the effectiveness of the current commercially available screening and
confirmation tests for detecting this new HTLV type. Key
research priorities are now to investigate the transmission
modes of this virus as well as possible pathogenic
associations.

The HTLV 2.4 western blot kit is based on strips incorporating HTLV-1/2 native viral antigens (originating from HTLV-1
infected cells) to which HTLV-1 (MTA-1) or HTLV-2 (K55)
gp46s or HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (GD21) gp21 recombinant
proteins have been added [11]. The INNO LIA kit uses only
recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides derived from
both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 proteins sequences. Whereas gag
p19 I/II corresponds both to a recombinant protein and synthetic peptides being recognized by anti HTLV-1 and HTLV-2
immune sera, env gp46 I/II corresponds only to synthetic
peptides recognized by anti HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 immune
sera. env gp46 II corresponds to synthetic peptides specific of
HTLV-2 [12]. (A, B) Lane 1: HTLV-1 positive control; lane 2:
