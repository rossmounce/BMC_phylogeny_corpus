Abstract
Background: Genes continuously duplicate and the duplicated copies remain in the genome or
get deleted. The DAL5 subfamily of transmembrane transporter genes has eight known members
in S. cerevisiae. All are putative anion:cation symporters of vitamins (such as allantoate, nicotinate,
panthotenate and biotin). The DAL5 subfamily is an old and important group since it is represented
in both Basidiomycetes ("mushrooms") and Ascomycetes ("yeast"). We studied the complex
evolution of this group in species from the kingdom of fungi particularly the Ascomycetes.
Results: We identified numerous gene duplications creating sets of orthologous and paralogous
genes. In different lineages the DAL5 subfamily members expanded or contracted and in some
lineages a specific member could not be found at all. We also observed a close relationship between
the gene YIL166C and its homologs in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species and two "wine spoiler"
yeasts, Dekkera bruxellensis and Candida guilliermondi, which could possibly be the result of
horizontal gene transfer between these distantly related species. In the analyses we detect several
well defined groups without S. cerevisiae representation suggesting new gene members in this
subfamily with perhaps altered specialization or function.
Conclusion: The transmembrane DAL5 subfamily was found to have a very complex evolution in
yeast with intra- and interspecific duplications and unusual relationships indicating specialization,
specific deletions and maybe even horizontal gene transfer. We believe that this group will be
important in future investigations of evolution in fungi and especially the evolution of
transmembrane proteins and their specialization.

Background
Transmembrane transporters of unicellular organisms,
like yeast, are one of the primary links between the outer
world and the metabolic pathways inside the cell. The
importance of these genes is seen in the substantial proportion of transporter genes within the yeast genome
(10%) [1]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, over

400 genes encoding transporter proteins have been found
[2].
Different species of yeast require different substrates to be
transported, and the number and kind of transporters
present in the genome therefore vary between species. The
presence or absence of a transporter may provide insight

into the niche preference and metabolic ability of a yeast
[3-6]. An example is seen in the loss or inactivation of the
galactose transporter Gal2p (and six other genes of the
galactose metabolism) in several Hemiascomycete species
[7]. Similarly, expansion or contraction of gene numbers
in various transporter subfamilies can indicate metabolic
abilities: for example, peroxisomal and long chain fatty
acid transporters have undergone amplification in Y. lipolytica, which is known to grow on fatty acids [8]. More
unexpectedly, genes belonging to two heavy metal transporter subfamilies, SIT and CT2, have been amplified 14
and 10 times respectively in Y. lipolytica [9], possibly as the
result of a natural symbiosis with bacteria providing ironsiderophores and/or other natural chelators.
Yeast transporters have been classified into a number of
families and subfamilies, based on functional and phylogenetic criteria [8,10]. Within the Hemiascomycete phylum, 97 small phylogenetic transporter subfamilies have
been identified comprising a total of 355 transporters
named according to their evolutionary patterns ("ubiquitous," "species specific," "phylum gains and losses," and
"homoplasic")[8].
The subfamily which is most variable in gene number
across yeast species is the anion:cation symporter subfamily (TC number 2.A.1.14) of the Major Facilitator
Superfamily [8]. These transporters are all putative weak
acid permeases, which take up anionic vitamins (allantoate, nicotinate, panthotenate, biotin and thiamine) in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/164

symport with protons or cations. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the allantoate permease family consists of eight proteins where the allantoate permease YJR152w (DAL5) has
given its name to the subfamily. The other members of
this family are YLR004c (TH173), YLL055w (YCT1),
YGR260w (TNA1), YIL166c, YAL067c (SEO1), YGR065c
(VHT1), YCR028c (FEN2) [10] (Table 1).
To investigate the evolution of this gene family, and track
its expansions and contractions across Hemiascomycetes,
we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of these genes
across a number of Hemiascomycete species for which
whole genomes are available. The DAL5 subfamily is a
ubiquitous transporter found in all Hemiascomycete species, but with a very complex evolution involving repeated
gene losses and duplications.

Results and Discussion
The relationship between the members of the DAL5
subfamily
The allantoate permease transporters are known to be an
ancient subfamily [11], and as expected we found almost
all members of the DAL5 group represented in the Hemiascomycete, Euascomycete and Basidiomycete taxa
included in our analysis. We identified three major clusters in the phylogenetic tree of all known members of the
DAL5 subfamily: one including the three genes SEO1,
VHT1 and FEN2 and their orthologs, another including
YCT1, DAL5 and TH173, and the third including YIL166c,
YOL163-2w and TNA1 (Figure 1) for more details [see

Function

References

Encodes an allantoate and ureidosuccinate permease, expression is constitutive but sensitive to nitrogen
catabolite repression. Subtelomeric in S. cerevisiae
YCR028c (FEN2) A membrane pantothenate transporter, regulated by high concentrations of pantothenate. Pantothenate is
essential for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, which is a carrier of activated C2 units in sterol biosynthesis. FEN2
was first identified in a screen for mutants resistant to fenproprimorph, an inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis
YGR065c (VHT1) Encodes a high affinity H+-biotin (vitamin H) permease different from mammals, regulated by high concentrations
of biotin. The biotin uptake and biosynthesis is reciprocally regulated by iron, with uptake being activated when
iron is scarce
YGR260w (TNA1) Encodes a high affinity nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) permease. The mRNA levels increase strongly at reduced
extracellular concentrations of both nicotinic acid and para-aminobenzoate (PABA) but are not inhibited by high
concentrations of the same substrates. Subtelomeric in S. cerevisiae
YLR004c (TH173) Encodes a membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that is strongly regulated by thiamine. It is unable to
transport thiamine but might be involved in transport of thiamine precursors. The metabolite is probably a
compound that can be used by yeast to generate the thiazole precursor HET. The expression level is upregulated
by Pdc2 (pyruvate decarboxylase) and Thi2 (thiamine)
YAL067c (SEO1)
Might be involved in the transport of some sulphur compound (which remains to be identified) since the
overexpression of the SEO1 gene allowed growth on low concentration of methionine sulphoxide and supressed
the ethionine sulphoxide resistance. The gene does not encode a methionine permease Subtelomeric in S.
cerevisiae
YLL055w (YCT1)
Might be involved in the intracellular transport of allantoate since its transcripts are overexpressed during
nitrogen starvation (similar to DAL5) The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Subtelomeric in S.
cerevisiae
YIL166c
Putative protein with elevated mRNA expression by sulfur limitation. YIL166c is a non-essential gene.

these clades are consistent with those in earlier papers
(e.g. [10]) with the addition of YOL163-2w, which is a
pseudogene in S. cerevisiae, in the last group. The two
genes SEO1 and VHT1 appear to be the result of an
ancient duplication in an ancestor of the Saccharomycotina group. Members from the Pezizomycotina group

For most genes within this subfamily, the phylogenetic
relationships we observed were similar to known taxonomic relationships (compare Figure 1 and Figure 2).
with Euascomycete, Basidiomycete and Hemiascomycete
species each clustering together, and Basidiomycetes at
the base of each tree. Within the Hemiascomycetes, we
expect to find Y. lipolytica at the base of the clade, with
Kluyveromyces and Candida species diverging subsequently, followed by the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
[12-14]. We observed this phylogenetic pattern overall,
but with some exceptions.

The relationship of the YIL166c and YOL163-2w genes
The evolution of the group of genes which we originally
believed to be orthologs of YIL166c is more complex than
we anticipated. These genes appear to be members of two
paralogous clades, one consisting of YIL166c from S. cerevisiae and closely related genes in the sensu stricto species,
C. guilliermondi and D. bruxellensis. Gene members from
U. maydis and A. oryzae were also found in this, the smallest of the clades of the genes in the DAL5 subfamily (Figure 5). The second paralogous clade consists of genes
from only Hemiascomycete species, including the contiguous S. cerevisiae genes YOL163w and YOL162w, constituting a putative single frame-shifted pseudogene. S.
cerevisiae and S. bayanus were the only representatives
from the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group that we found.
More than half the members of this clade have gene duplications. Besides Y. lipolytica, C. guillerimondi, C. albicans, C.
tropicalis, A. gossipii and D. hansenii each have two or more
paralogous copies, indicating multiple recent gene duplications after species divergence. These two clades, YIL166c
and YOL163-2w, have a common base represented by two
Euascomycete species, A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, and
three gene copies from C. guillermondi (Figure 5).

The relationship of the DAL5 genes
The DAL5 gene tree provides one exception to the
expected phylogenetic relationships. S. pombe has two
copies of this gene: one is basal to the Hemiascomycetes,
as expected, but the second clusters with K. lactis (Figure
3). This clustering of a S. pombe gene with K. lactis has very
low bootstrap support, however, and is probably artifactual. C. guilliermondi and D. hansenii both possess multiple paralogs of this gene, and each has one representative
that clustered outside the Hemiascomycetes. These genes
may be ancient paralogs, which may have evolved functions distinct from those described for DAL5.
The relationship of the TNA1 genes
Another unexpected relationship was found in the gene
tree of TNA1, in which four species K. waltii, C. tropicalis,
Y. lipolytica and S. pombe had several gene duplicates, both
recent and ancient, and spread unevenly in the gene tree.
In our analyses we found five copies of this gene from C.
tropicalis and S. pombe clustering at three different places in
the tree and three copies from K. waltii in two clusters. For
Y. lipolytica we found 20 gene copies clustering at five different places (Figure 4). A distant group of species, Group
C, include only species from the pre-whole genome duplication event in the yeast clade and could constitute
another gene member with a different function or specialization from TNA1. The paralog was obviously lost in an
ancestor of the whole genome duplication lineage. This
might also be the case in the groups of A and B where Y.
lipolytica has several recent duplications.

The gene tree indicates ancient duplication of this gene,
since many species have gene copies in several clusters (C.

There are two further points of interest in this region of
the tree (Figure 5). The first is the presence of a U. maydis
(Basidiomycete) gene at the base of the Hemiascomycete
YIL166c clade. Although the node has only 60% bootstrap support, the node below this is 100% supported,
which results in a confident clade in which a basidiomycete is nested within ascomycetes. This relationship suggests that there has been a horizontal gene transfer event
from either Euascomycetes or Hemiascomycetes to this
Basidiomycete species. It will be interesting to see if a similar sequence can be detected in any other Basidiomycete
species.
Secondly, while most species are represented in most gene
clades, the species represented in each of these two clades
(YIL166c and YOL163-2w) are substantially different. The
YIL166c group contains the sensu stricto species, D. bruxellensis and C. guilliermondi, while the other clade contains
the other species from the Hemiascomycetes. The Saccharomyces sensu stricto species, C. guilliermondi and D. bruxellensis have all been found in alcoholic beverages like wine

[15]. The presence of these orthologous transporters in
these taxa could be due to selection for retention of a
transporter specially adapted to an environment of low
oxygen and high ethanol concentration. It seems that the
genes from these species are true orthologs with a common origin, and have either been lost from the other
Hemiascomycetes or horizontally transferred into the
"wine species". The gene transfer is either from a species
close to U. maydis, which branched off before the Euascomycetes, or the gene in U. maydis is also a horizontally
transferred gene, and the horizontal gene transfer
occurred from a species in the Euascomycetes clade to U.
maydis, and the "wine species". These hypotheses are currently speculative, and much further work would be
required to investigate them further.
Another unusual behaviour of the Hemiascomycete
orthologs of YIL166c is that this transporter appears to
have undergone species-specific duplication in every species in our analysis. Some have been duplicated prior to
speciation like C. tropicalis and C. albicans. The intraspecific duplication has resulted in two or three copies for
most of the species in the trees except for Y. lipolytica. The
pattern of gene duplication in this species is unusual: for
each member of the subfamily, Y. lipolytica has either three
or more paralogs or no copy of the gene at all. We found
no orthologs of YIL166c, YCT1, TH173 and VHT1 in Y.
lipolytica, but for FEN2 we found three copies, YOL163w
four copies, DAL5 five copies, SEO1 six copies and for
TNA1 20 copies, that met our criteria. The selective advantage of these amplifications for Y. lipolytica is not understood, but it could be a compensation for the loss of the
other DAL5 transporters or a selective advantage coupled
to a sudden change in the environment and/or the hydrocarbon diet. The amplification we observe of anion:cation
symporters in Y. lipolytica has also been seen in
drug:H+antiporter transporters and quinate:H+symporters
[8].
How have the gene expansions taken place?
Duplications of genes could be on the gene level, segmental, chromosomal or whole genome duplications. The
duplications offer the opportunity for copies to evolve different functions, either broader or more specialized. Gene
copies that provide an advantage for the organism may be
preserved and go to fixation under selection. Others might
lose any function, become pseudogenes and ultimately be
lost from the genome. In the DAL5 family the number of
copies various tremendously within and between species
for the different gene family members. This expansion
and shrinkage is most evident in Y. lipolytica where we
found three to twenty paralogs for five of the nine subfamilies and in the others, no copy of the gene at all. The
other species has also expanded into two to four copies for
most genes in this subfamily. In some cases it is evident

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/164

that the duplications occurred before speciation, for
example see C. albicans and C. tropicalis for YOL163w,
while in other cases there have been recent independent
duplications in several species, see Y. lipolytica and A. gossypii in YOL163w (Figure 5). A similar pattern can be
observed in the lower part of the tree DAL5 (Figure 3)
where a few lineages (D. hansenii, C. albicans and Y. lipolytica) seem to have undergone a recent duplication and at
the same time an ancestor of S. cerevisiae and the sensu
stricto group deleted their copy.
Most species-specific genes are located near telomeres in
Saccharomyces sensu stricto species [16-18]. Four (SEO1,
YCT1, DAL5 and YIL166c) of the eight genes (nine in
other species) in this subfamily are subtelomeric in S. cerevisiae. It is possible that the complexity that we see in
many trees, especially for Y. lipolytica and D. hansenii, is a
result of horizontal gene transfer coupled with intraspecific duplications. Maybe the duplications that we see are
a result of specialization for different substrates or maybe
even for a different function. Most of the permeases are
complex in nature, with many different substrates, and for
many of the species investigated here the transporter proteins are poorly studied.

Conclusion
Yeast is one of the most important model organisms in
biology research including evolution. The yeast lineage, as
part of the kingdom of fungi, has revealed both horizontal
transfers and whole genome duplication and is a very
important group regarding new insights into evolutionary
pathways [3,5,19]. Crucial genes often show an interesting evolution and transmembrane proteins are often
essential for the survival of the yeast cells. The transmembrane DAL5 subfamily includes genes that seem to be very
important due to its many duplications in almost all yeast
species investigated, but it also includes genes that obviously can be deleted without any harm done to the organism. When we analysed species from the whole kingdom
of fungi we found that the DAL5 subfamily has a very
complex evolution in yeast, not seen before, with intraand interspecific duplications and unusual relationships
indicating specialization, deletions and maybe even horizontal gene transfer. We believe that the DAL5 subfamily
will be important in future investigations of evolution in
fungi, especially the evolution of transmembrane proteins
and their specialization.

Methods
DATA
We performed two sets of BLAST searches to obtain the
sequences used in this analysis. First, the protein
sequences of the eight members of the DAL5 family from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SEO1, FEN2, VHT1, TNA1,
YIL166c, DAL5, YCT1 and TH173) were used as BLASTP

queries against an NCBI genomic BLAST database of several fungal species for which whole genomes are available
(Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, C. tropicalis, Debaryomyces hansenii,
Kluyveromyces lactis, K. waltii, Saccharomyces bayanus, S. castellii, S. cerevisiae, S. kluyveri, S. kudriavzevii, S. mikate, S.
paradoxus, Yarrowia lipolytica, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
Aspergillus fumigatus and A. Nidulans). For each of these
query proteins, we extracted from the BLASTP results all
hits that had E-values better than 1e-6. To confirm that we
had obtained all likely homologs of these genes, we compared the sequences of the hits we obtained in each query
species to the database of gene family sequences made
available by Jason Stajich at http://www.fungalge
nomes.org. Any genes in this database which were not
present in our BLAST results, and were over 300 bp long,
were added to our dataset.

sis was repeated. These results were not qualitatively different.

We also used the S. cerevisiae genes as TBLASTN queries
against a database of Dekkera bruxellensis contig
sequences, which represent approximately 40% of the
genome of D. bruxellensis strain CBS 2499 (Woolfit et al
2007).
Phylogenetic analysis
We initially treated each of the query genes, together with
their sets of hits, as separate datasets. As preliminary analyses suggested that the genes SEO1 and VHT1 represented
a Hemiascomycete-specific duplication, the results for
these two genes were combined, leaving us with seven
datasets.

Acknowledgements

For each of the datasets, the protein sequences were
aligned using T_Coffee. The alignments were edited by
hand, and any regions of the sequences for which homology could not be confidently established were removed
producing alignments of between 410 and 526 residues in
length (SEO1-VHT1: 495aa, FEN2: 449aa, DAL5: 416aa,
YCT1:
488aa,
TH173:
486aa,
TNA1:
410aa,
YIL166C:526aa). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for
each dataset using PHYML, using the JTT model of substitution, and a gamma distribution of rates with four categories. The gamma parameter was estimated from the
data. One thousand bootstrap replicates of each tree were
run, using the same model parameters.

We then combined all sequences into a single alignment.
The seven previously aligned datasets were used as "profiles" and aligned against one another using the profile
comparison function in T_Coffee. The resulting alignment of 650 residues was checked manually, and phylogenetic analyses were performed as described above. To
confirm that the step-wise method of alignment had not
affected our results, gaps were removed, all sequences
were realigned using Muscle, and the phylogenetic analy-
