Abstract
Background: Many bacteria can take up DNA, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence
and transformation remain obscure. The sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or
gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. Additional insight may come from
the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as Haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence
(USS) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient DNA uptake. We used the
distribution of competence genes and DNA uptake specificity in H. influenzae's family, the Pasteurellaceae, to
examine the ancestry of competence.
Results: A phylogeny of the Pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced
genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the Hin subclade (H. influenzae, Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and H. somnus), and the Apl subclade
(A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica, and H. ducreyi). All species contained homologues of all known H. influenzae
competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. Competence gene defects were identified
in three species (H. somnus, H. ducreyi and M. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin.
The assumption that USS arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of H.
influenzae proteins with distant homologues. Abundant USS-like repeats were found in all eight Pasteurellacean
genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the Hin subclade were identical to that of H. influenzae
(AAGTGCGGT), whereas members of the Apl subclade shared the consensus ACAAGCGGT. All species' USSs
had the strong consensus and flanking AT-rich repeats of H. influenzae USSs. DNA uptake and competition
experiments demonstrated that the Apl-type repeat is a true USS distinct from the Hin-type USS: A.
pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up DNA fragments containing the Apl-type USS over both H. influenzae and
unrelated DNAs, and H. influenzae prefers its own USS over the Apl type.
Conclusion: Competence and DNA uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the Pasteurellaceae, with
divergent USSs and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. The conservation of most
competence genes over the ~350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence
may be evolutionary dead ends.

Background
Many bacteria are able to take up DNA from the environment [1]. DNA provides these naturally competent cells
with nutrients (nucleotides, N and P), while recombination of incoming DNA with the cell's genome can also
provide new genetic information. However, many aspects
of the evolution of competence remain unclear.
Competence is widely distributed among bacteria, and
some of the genes required for DNA uptake are shared
between even distant relatives, suggesting an ancient common origin for competence. For example, the Gram positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae
and the Gram negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae all require homologues of type four pilus
proteins and of the ComEC/Rec2 membrane channel [1].
However, the regulatory processes controlling expression
of these competence genes are very different in the different organisms [2]. Furthermore the distribution of natural
competence is surprisingly sporadic; most naturally competent bacteria have many relatives, including other
strains of the same species, that cannot be transformed
under laboratory conditions (for examples see [3-6]). Two
explanations seem equally plausible. First, competence
might be ancestral to most major lineages but frequently
lost (and possibly regained, under different regulation).
Alternatively, competence might be frequently gained in
independent lineages, e.g. if the genetic requirements for
DNA uptake are simple and readily met by laterally transferred genes or by mutation of genes with related functions such as those associated with type IV pili.
The uptake specificity of some naturally competent bacteria can also guide inferences about the evolution of competence. Although many naturally competent bacteria will
take up DNA fragments from any source with equal efficiency, members of some Gram-negative families take up
DNA fragments from their own species much more efficiently than unrelated DNA. In the Pasteurellaceae and
Neisseriaceae the molecular basis of this specificity is preferential binding of the uptake machinery to short DNA
sequences present in thousands of copies in each species'
genome. Such sequences are referred to as uptake signal
sequences (USSs) in the Pasteurellaceae and DNA uptake
sequences (DUSs) in the Neisseriaceae; they are not known
in other naturally transformable bacteria [7,8].
The best-characterized uptake sequences are those of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The preferred sequences themselves appear to have
little in common: the core H. influenzae USS is 5'-AAGTGCGGT (5'-ACCGCACTT in the reverse orientation), with
two AT-rich motifs on the 3' side of the standard orientation [9], whereas the Neisseria DUS is GCCGTCTGAA with
no flanking motifs [10]. However, similarities in genomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/82

frequencies and distributions suggest that they have arisen
by similar processes. Both USSs and DUSs are present in
their respective genomes at frequencies close to one copy
per kb and both show no significant orientation bias.
Both types are distributed somewhat more regularly
around their genomes than expected for randomly located
repeats, but both have some copies occurring in closely
spaced oppositely oriented pairs [7]. Both USSs and DUSs
are preferentially found in non-coding DNA sequences,
but both have many copies in coding sequences. Both
types are also overrepresented in the genomes of at least
some other members of their genus or family [4,7-9,1113].
One puzzling attribute shared by USSs and DUSs is an
unusually strong consensus, with each genome containing many more copies that perfectly match its consensus
core sequence than singly mismatched copies. This pattern is typical of young transposons and other genetic elements that multiply by copying, but very different from
the more relaxed consensus typical of sequences that function as binding sites for regulatory proteins, which arise
by point mutation of pre-existing sequences. Because
USSs are thought to function by binding to DNA-receptor
proteins at the cell surface [14,15], their very strong consensus is anomalous. The explanation might be that the
DNA uptake machinery at the cell surface binds DNA with
much higher specificity than do intracellular DNA-binding proteins. However the possibility that USSs arise by a
copying process has not been excluded.
Previous analysis has found that copies of the H. influenzae USS are abundant in the genomes of several other
members of the Pasteurellaceae (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, and H. somnus), and
comparison of homologous genes in H. influenzae and P.
multocida has shown that individual USSs can be stable
over hundreds of millions of years [13]. However, preliminary examinations of the sequenced genomes of the Pasteurellaceans Mannheimia haemolytica (by Sarah
Highlander) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (by ourselves) found that the H. influenzae USS was much less
abundant than a related sequence that differs at several
positions, suggesting that these genomes might contain a
variant USS.
Insight into the evolution of competence will depend on
an improved understanding of Pasteurellaceaen phylogeny. Almost all Pasteurellaceae (gamma-proteobacteria)
are commensals and/or pathogens of the mucosal surfaces
of vertebrates, primarily birds and mammals, and several
are important human pathogens. Although phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences has confirmed that
the family is monophyletic, the relationships of its members remain poorly resolved. Two recently published phy-

subclade from the five other species. The 100% bootstrap
values place A. pleuropneumoniae and H. ducreyi as sister
species, but the branching order in the Hin subclade
remains uncertain.

A robust Pasteurellacean phylogeny
The amino acid sequences of 12 well-conserved genes
were identified from the available published and draft
sequences of Pasteurellacean genomes and used to infer
the consensus phylogeny shown in Figure 1. Homologous
E. coli genes were used as the outgroup. The chosen genes
did not contain the H. influenzae USS, were distributed
around the H. influenzae genome, and had strong homologues in the other genomes. Intracellular proteins were
chosen to preclude the diversifying selection that can bias
evolution of proteins exposed on the cell surface, and
genes with base compositions typical of their species'
genomes were used to preclude recent horizontal transfer.

This phylogeny is restricted to the eight species with
sequenced genomes, but it is the first Pasteurellacean tree
to have strong statistical support. It differs in many
respects from both the 16S rRNA and protein phylogenies
previously published for the Pasteurellaceae. However in
our view these discrepancies are the consequence of most
branches of those earlier phylogenies having very poor
bootstrap support, making them intrinsically unreliable,
and so should not be a cause for concern. The Apl subclade
it predicts was also supported by the protein tree of Christensen et al. [17]. Although the Apl subclade is not seen in
Christensen et al.'s small-subunit rRNA tree, the resolution of that region of their tree is poor (best bootstraps are
69% and 75%) [16]. The topology of an earlier tree based
on small subunit rRNA sequences agrees with ours,
although none of the relevant bootstrap values in that tree
are significant [18]. The new tree also confirms what the
previous more-detailed but less-well-supported trees had
predicted – that within the Pasteurellaceae true evolutionary relatedness is not well correlated with many of the features previously used to assign isolates to genus
[17,19,20].

The resulting phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) identified two primary subclades within the Pasteurellaceae. These are
referred to below as the Hin subclade and the Apl subclade. The statistical support for these subclades is robust,
with bootstrap values of 100%. Independent phylogenies
done for each protein separately all grouped A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica and H. ducreyi together as a distinct

The genus assignment of M. succiniciproducens provides an
example. This species, isolated from bovine rumen, was
assigned to Mannheimia based on a simple small-subunit
rRNA tree with no bootstrap analysis [21]. Our phylogenetic analysis instead places the two Mannheimia species
in separate subclades. The 80% bootstrap score supporting M. succiniciproducens's placement as the sister group to

Here we use the concatenated sequences of 12 proteins to
construct a well-resolved phylogenetic tree for the species
of Pasteurellaceae with genome sequences available. This
tree then serves as a framework against which we characterize the long-term evolution of competence genes and of
DNA uptake specificity.

H. influenzae in Fig. 1 is too low to rule out a closer affinity
with P. multocida. Hong et al. compared the M. succiniciproducens genome sequence to those of both P. multocida
and H. influenzae; more genes are shared with the former,
but the amino acid identities are higher with the latter
[22,23]. In any case it is striking to find a rumen bacterium
as such a close relative of bacteria otherwise restricted to
respiratory mucosa.
Competence genes in Pasteurellacean genomes
Natural transformation has been demonstrated experimentally in only three of the eight sequenced species (H.
influenzae, A. actinomycetemcomitans and A. pleuropneumoniae [12,24,25]). Only two other species within the Pasteurellaceae have also been shown to be naturally
competent (Haemophilus parasuis [26] and Haemophilus
parainfluenzae [4,27]). A number of other species have
resisted multiple attempts at transformation in the laboratory, but their nontransformability could be misleading,
as cellular processes important in the natural environment may not be induced under laboratory culture conditions.

VanWagoner et al. identified homologues of several H.
influenzae competence genes (HI0366, HI0938 and
HI0939) in most sequenced Pasteurellacean genomes
[28]. As we have recently identified the complete competence regulon of H. influenzae, we examined the genomes
of all of the sequenced Pasteurellaceae for homologues of
all of these genes [29]. Table 1 shows that all of the

genomes contain recognizable homologues of all of the
genes known to be required for competence in H. influenzae, as well as homologues of most other genes consistently occurring in the same operons.
However not all of the genes in this ancestor's sequenced
descendants appear to be functional. The H. ducreyi comA,
comB and comM genes are interrupted by an internal stop
codon (comA) and frameshifts (comB and comM). A deletion in the H. somnus genome fuses the 5' portion of comD
to the 3' 67% of comE, which also contains a frameshift. A
17 kb insertion disrupts the comM gene of M. succiniciproducens, and most of pilB in M. haemolytica has been
deleted. In some cases, examination of genome sequences
from different isolates revealed discrepancies; these may
result from strain-specific variation or from the preliminary nature of some of the sequences used. Only the
sequenced genomes of H influenzae, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae retain fully
intact sets of competence genes.
What inferences can be drawn about the evolution of
competence? First, the most parsimonious explanation
for the presence of all competence genes in all genomes is
that the ancestral Pasteurellacean had functional copies of
all these genes and was naturally competent. When and
where did this ancestor live? Although dating bacterial
divergences is highly problematic, the most recent common ancestor of H. influenzae and P. multocida, and thus
of the Hin-subclade in Fig. 1, has been estimated to have

A USS-encoded peptide and flanking region within the H. influenzae folD gene (HI0609; amino acids 203–245), aligned with folD proteins from: E.coli (b0529; amino acids 203–246), Vibrio cholerae (VC1942; amino acids 228–271), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA1796; amino acids 203–246). The sketch at the right

lived about 270 million years ago (mya), and last common ancestor of the entire family must be older still
[30,31]. Thus the origin of the Pasteurellaceae is likely to
have long predated the origin of mammals (c.195 mya)
and may be contemporaneous with the origin of tetrapods about 360 mya. If so, it is possible that these bacteria
moved into the respiratory tract and used the abundant
DNA found there [32] almost as soon as the first respiratory tracts evolved.
What then explains the sporadic distribution of competence in its descendants? Three of the five genomes from
'non-transformable' species we analyzed carry obvious
genetic defects that would prevent DNA uptake. (Loss of
comM in M. haemolytica would only prevent transformation.) Each defect is unique and so must have arisen since
the most recent divergence in its lineage. Furthermore, the
substitution rate indicated by the scale bar on Fig. 1 allows
estimation of the minimum number of chain-terminating
and frameshift mutations expected to have accumulated
since loss of a competence gene removed selection on
other competence-specific genes. The scarcity of such
mutations in each of these strains (0, 1 or 2) suggests that
competence was lost quite recently. This is consistent also
with the high densities and strong consensuses of the USS
in all genomes except H. ducreyi. Frequent recent losses of
competence would also explain the reported variation in
competence within populations [3-6].
Uptake signal sequences (USS) are not insertions
One goal of this work was to use USS distribution to make
inferences about the evolution of DNA uptake specificity.
However, the anomalously strong consensuses of H. influenzae USSs (and other USSs) raised the concern that they
might have been produced by insertion of a replicating

element rather than by point mutations in pre-existing
sequences. Fortunately the mode of USS origin makes a
simple prediction about the positions of gaps in sequence
alignments. If individual H. influenzae USSs have arisen by
insertion, gaps should be seen when the segments containing these USS are aligned with homologous sequences
from genomes that diverged before USS arose. We used
this prediction to test whether the many H. influenzae
USSs in protein coding sequences arose in an ancestral
Pasteurellacean by insertion or by accumulation of point
mutations in the ancestral genes.
Because of the evolutionary distance between H. influenzae and species with no USS, the alignments were done
between predicted amino acid sequences rather than
nucleotide sequences. Segments of well-conserved H.
influenzae proteins, centred on USS-encoded amino acids,
were aligned with homologous protein segments from
Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
whose genomes do not contain USS-like repeats. A typical
alignment is shown in Fig 2, along with a sketch of the
evolutionary relationships of these bacteria.
Of the 956 H. influenzae USS in protein-coding regions
(65% of all USS), 158 were in protein segments that could
be aligned with = 50% identity to homologues from all
three other species. Only 24% (115/474) of the individual
E. coli, V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa proteins alignments
contained gaps, and most gaps were outside of the segment encoded by the USS core. Similar results were seen
in alignments between homologues from outside the
gamma-proteobacteria and the subset of H. influenzae
protein sequences sufficiently well conserved to align well
(results not shown). The homology between amino acids
that are USS-encoded in H. influenzae and amino acids in

distant relatives confirms that USSs have arisen by nucleotide substitutions in pre-existing sequences and not by
insertions of a replicative element.
All Pasteurellacean genomes contain USS-like repeats
The next step was to characterize the phylogenetic distribution of USS. Bakkali et al. found that the only overrepresented short repeats in the P. multocida genome are
variants of the 9 bp H. influenzae USS core [13]. They also
found the H. influenzae USS core to be highly overrepresented in the H. somnus and A. actinomycetemcomitans
genomes but did not survey other repeats. To avoid the
bias of searching for a specific USS sequence, we extended
this analysis by counting all 6–12 bp repeats in all eight
genomes (Table 2) and calculating the number of each
repeat expected in a random-sequence genome of the
same size and base composition.

Table 2 shows that all genomes had highly overrepresented repeats related to the H. influenzae USS. The most
common 9-mer repeats in the genomes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. multocida, M. succiniciproducens and H.
somnus are the H. influenzae USS core AAGTGCGGT and
its reverse complement. All of the ten most abundant 8mer, 9-mer and 10-mer repeats in these genomes also contain or closely overlap this 9-mer. We will refer to this as
the Hin-type USS. However the most frequent 9-mer
repeats in the genomes of A. pleuropneumoniae and M.
haemolytica differed from the Hin-type USS at the second,
third and fourth positions (ACAAGCGGT rather than
AAGTGCGGT); we will refer to this as the Apl-type USS.
The most abundant repeats in the H. ducreyi genome were
not recognizable USSs but simple palindromes and
strings of As and Ts, so Table 2 also gives the frequencies
of the most common USS-like 8, 9 and 10-mers for this
genome. These resembled the Apl-type USS but their copy

numbers were substantially lower than in the other
genomes. (Although the 10-mer AATAAGCGGT was the
most common USS-like 10-mer repeat, ATAAGCGGT and
TAAGCGGT were not among the 50 most frequent 9-mers
and 8-mers.)
Each genome was specifically checked for repeats of the
other USS type. The frequencies of both types of 9 bp USSs
per Mb sequence in all eight genomes are shown in Fig.
3A. Only 4 copies per Mb would be expected in randomsequence genomes of the same base compositions.
Although the minority USS type (e.g. Hin-type USS in A.
pleuropneumoniae) is several-fold overrepresented in each
genome, it is not significantly more frequent than other 9mers sharing the global consensus ANNNGCGGT. Thus
each genome appears to have a predominant subcladespecific USS type.
Fig. 3B shows, for each Pasteurellacean genome, the ratio
of repeats perfectly matching each USS type to repeats
with single mismatches to that type. Genomes with Hintype USSs resemble H. influenzae in having more perfect
than singly mismatched copies, despite the 27-fold greater
number of possible sequences. The discrepancy is also
seen for genomes with Apl-type USSs; with the exception
of H. ducreyi, the ratio is substantially higher for the subclade-specific USS type than for the other type. The consistency of the pattern suggests that USS accumulation is
shaped by similar forces in the different genomes.
Detailed comparisons of USSs
As USSs are thought to function by binding to DNA receptors on the cell surface, bases at different positions in the

reflecting their differing contributions to this DNA-protein binding. Sequence logos were used to visualize the

representation of each base at each position of the USS
(Figs. 4 and 5) [33]. In these logos the relative heights of
the A, G, C and T in each stack shows the frequencies of
the bases at that position, and the overall height of each
stack of letters reflects the strength of the consensus at that
position (the information content). The height of the
stack is especially sensitive to minor changes in the frequency of a very frequent base (e.g. if the frequency of the
most common base falls from 1.0 to 0.9 the height falls
from 2.0 to 1.6).
Fig. 4A shows the differences in consensus strengths at the
USS core positions. In all genomes with Hin-type USSs
most core positions appear to have roughly equal consensus strengths, suggesting that all make similar contributions to binding specificity. The exceptions are the final T,
which has a weaker consensus in H. influenzae and H. somnus, and the first G in M. succiniproducens. For genomes
with the Apl-type USS the first two positions of USS cores
show a weaker consensus than the other positions, suggesting that they may make a lesser contribution to the
specificity of DNA binding and uptake. Confirmation of
these predictions must await identification and characterization of the proteins or other molecules that interact
with the USS at the cell surface.
The H. influenzae and A. actinomycetemcomitans USSs have
been shown to also share conserved motifs (segments 2
and 3) on the 3' side of the USS core [9,12]. The importance of segment 2 was experimentally demonstrated by
Danner and coworkers, who showed that USS-containing
DNA fragments ethylated at bases in this region were not
taken up by competent H. influenzae cells [15]. The functions of these positions in DNA uptake are not known;
they may be additional sites of contact with the DNA
receptor, or they may be involved in DNA bending or
kinking during uptake.
Fig. 4B shows the consensuses of positions flanking the
core USSs in each of the eight genomes. As viewed in the
standard orientation, all USS consensuses have an AT-rich
motif just 3' of the core (segment 2; positions 22–27 as
numbered in Fig. 4B), with the first bases usually 'A's and
the final 3 or 4 bases 'T's. A second AT-rich motif is seen
further downstream (segment 3). In the Hin-type USS this
6nt-motif segment consists primarily of Ts, and is centred
12 positions to the right of segment 2. In A. pleuropneumoniae and M. haemolytica, segment 3 extends slightly farther
to the left and substantially farther to the right, and has
the more complex consensus AAAATTTTGCAAAT.
Although the H. ducreyi USS consensus in segments 2 and
3 resembles the Apl-type motifs, it is much weaker.
Together with the lower frequency of USS in its genome,
and the presence of inactivating mutations in three of its

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/82

competence genes, this suggests a relatively ancient loss of
ability to take up DNA.
The consensuses in segments 2 and 3 of the A. pleuropneumoniae and M. haemolytica USSs were particularly strong
and extensive. To compare their strengths to that of the
core USS we repeated the above analysis in reverse. We
chose the nine bases making the strongest contribution to
segment 2 and segment 3 (ATTTNNNNNNNNNTTTGC)
or to segment 3 alone (TTTTGCAAA) and identified and
aligned all A. pleuropneumoniae genomic segments containing them (560 and 454 segments respectively). The
resulting logos (Fig. 5A and 5B) show that many of the
segments bearing these motifs also contained all but the
first two bases of the Apl-type USS core. The weak correlation of the first two positions of the core with the flanking
segments may mean that these positions play a lesser role
in USS function than the rest of the core, with its larger
segment 3 making a greater contribution to the binding
specificity. A logo using only the 164 sequences with 12
matches to segments 2 and 3 was even more effective,
recovering the full core consensus (Fig. 5C). Taken
together, these analyses suggest that, at least in A. pleuropneumoniae, the motifs in segments 2 and 3 may be as
important for DNA uptake as the USS core.
USS in H. parasuis
A recent paper reported that H. parasuis has the core USS
GAGTTCGGT, which differs from both the Hin and Apl
types[26]. However this conclusion was based on analysis
of a single putative USS in a cloned 413 bp fragment. We
have examined all the available H. parasuis sequences
(86,701nt, mainly in ORFs) and find, in addition to the
one copy of this repeat described by Bigas et al., four copies of the Hin-type USS, fourteen copies of the Apl-type
USS, and seventeen copies of sequences differing at single
positions from the Apl-type USS. This suggests that H. parasuis has an Apl-type USS, which would be consistent both
with previous phylogenetic analysis placing it in a
strongly supported subclade with M. haemolytica and A.
pleuropneumoniae [17,34] and with the ability of A. pleuropneumoniae DNA to efficiently transform H. parasuis
[35].
H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae recognize
subclade-specific USSs
A. actinomycetemcomitans (Hin-type USS) has already been
shown to preferentially take up its own and H. influenzae
DNAs [12], but for most of the other species the role of the
putative USS in DNA uptake could not be directly tested
because no competent isolate has been identified. However A. pleuropneumoniae strain HS143 (serotype 15) has
recently been shown to be much more competent than
other strains (J. Bossé, manuscript in preparation), allowing us to test its uptake specificity by three different exper-

The solid bars in Figure 6A and 6B show measurements of
uptake by competent H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae cells of radiolabelled 220 bp DNA fragments containing synthetic H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae USSs.
These USSs were designed to contain the most common
base at each position of the extended USSs described
above; a control fragment contained a randomized version of the H. influenzae USS sequence. As expected, H.
influenzae took up about 1500-fold more DNA containing
its USS than control DNA (Fig. 6A; note the log scale). The
function of the Apl-type putative USS was confirmed; A.
pleuropneumoniae took up about 17-fold more DNA with
its USS than control DNA (Fig. 6B). Each species also took
up substantially less DNA containing the heterologous
USS type than its own type (only about twice as much as
control DNA), confirming that the DNA uptake machinery discriminates between the two types.
Uptake of chromosomal DNA may provide a more biologically relevant measure of specificity. The dashed bars

in Fig. 6A and 6B show uptake of radiolabelled chromosomal DNAs by competent H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae cells. In this assay H. influenzae took up 50-fold
more H. influenzae DNA than the control E. coli DNA (Fig.
6A), and A. pleuropneumoniae took up about 37-fold more
A. pleuropneumoniae DNA than E. coli DNA (Fig. 6B). In
both chromosomal and synthetic-USS uptake experiments A. pleuropneumoniae took up substantially less DNA
than did H. influenzae, consistent with its lower transformation frequency.
Consideration of the relative densities of the two USS
types in the three genomes (H. influenzae: A. pleuropneumoniae: E. coli; 198:8:1 (Hin-type USSs) and 4.4:48:1 (Apltype USSs)) allows clarification of the degree to which
each species takes up DNA of the other type. First, the high
density of Hin-type USS in the H. influenzae genome
means that most chromosomal DNA fragments (≥ 50 kb
long) would have contained at least several USS, reducing
the contribution of each USS to uptake. Second, the presence of heterologous USS in the two Pasteurellacean
genomes can explain H. influenzae's 6-fold higher uptake
of A. pleuropneumoniae DNA than E. coli DNA, but is likely
insufficient to explain A. pleuropneumoniae's 32-fold

higher uptake of H. influenzae DNA than E. coli DNA.
These results suggest that the A. pleuropneumoniae uptake
machinery does indeed weakly recognize the Hin-type
USS, and do not preclude a similar overlap in specificity
by the H. influenzae uptake machinery.
Figure 7 shows the extent to which cells preferentially take
up genetically marked conspecific DNA in the presence of
competing DNA from their own strain or another species.
This is a more sensitive measure of uptake bias than the
uptake of pure DNAs tested above. Fig. 7A shows the
results of uptake-competition assays using H. influenzae
cells and a constant amount of H. influenzae chromosomal DNA carrying a novobiocin resistance allele. As
expected, unmarked H. influenzae DNA competed
strongly but B. subtilis DNA, which does not contain overrepresented USS-like repeats, did not [36]. A. pleuropneumoniae DNA did not compete for uptake. Fig. 7B shows
that A. pleuropneumoniae took up its own DNA in prefer-

ence to both H. influenzae DNA and B. subtilis DNA. These
results confirm that the DNA uptake machineries of both
H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae discriminate
strongly in favour of DNAs containing their own USS
type. H. parasuis DNA was also tested; it did not compete
for uptake by H. influenzae (Fig. 7A), but competed with
A. pleuropneumoniae DNA for uptake by A. pleuropneumoniae to an extent consistent with the density of Apl-type
USS in its DNA.
We did not test whether cells could discriminate between
DNAs from species in the same subclade. However, as an
earlier measure of relatedness among the Pasteurellaceae,
Albritton et al. examined the ability of DNAs from various
species to compete with H. influenzae DNA for uptake by
competent H. influenzae cells [37]. The ability to compete
for uptake correctly predicted the USS distributions we
have found: DNAs from A. actinomycetemcomitans and P.
multocida (Hin subclade) competed strongly (54% and

44% as well as H. influenzae DNA), but DNA from A. pleuropneumoniae (Apl subclade) competed only poorly (7%).
Although the other sequenced species were not tested, the
competition shown by DNA of non-sequenced Pasteurellacean species is likely to predict the USS types they contain. Thus the strong competition Albritton et al. observed
by H. parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus and
P. pneumotropica DNAs suggests that they likely carry Hintype USSs. Consistent with this, H. parainfluenzae is
known to have Hin-type USSs [15], and Christensen et al.'s
rRNA and protein trees place P. pneumotropica close to P.
multocida with reasonable bootstrap support; their rRNA
tree also places H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus close
to H. influenzae with modest bootstrap support. In contrast, Albritton et al. found that DNAs of P. ureae, A. lignieresii and A. equuli competed very poorly with H.
influenzae DNA. These taxa are closely linked to A. pleuropneumoniae in Christensen et al.'s rRNA tree, and A. lignieresi is the sister taxon to A. pleuropneumoniae in their
protein trees, supporting the hypothesis that they have
Apl-type USSs [16,17].
The shared features of the Pasteurellacean USS types may
reflect generalized features of the DNA uptake process.
The 9 bp USS cores may match the size of the recognition

domain of the as-yet-unidentified DNA receptor protein,
and are similar in length to the 10 bp Neisseria core. The
conservation of segment 2 and segment 3 in the Pasteurellaceae is intriguing, as conserved flanking motifs are not
seen in Neisseria. It may be significant that the spacings
between the USS core, segment 2 and segment 3 correspond roughly to single turns of helical DNA. We know it
cannot be the case that H. influenzae cells initiate uptake
by threading a DNA end through a membrane pore,
because they efficiently take up covalently closed plasmids [38]. However DNA molecules are too highly
charged and too stiff (persistence length about 50 nm or
150 bp) to simply pass sideways through the outer membrane. Together the USS core plus flanking motifs may
allow the DNA to be sharply kinked (perhaps by strand
separation), presenting a compact cross-section for membrane transit. Detailed understanding of the function of
USSs will require more complete experimental studies of
binding and incorporation of target DNA sequences.

Conclusion
The eight Pasteurellacean species we analyzed fall into
two robust subclades. The genomes of all these bacteria
contain homologues of all the H. influenzae genes known
to be needed for DNA uptake, some of which have

the USS core and included the AT-rich segment 2 and
much of segment 3. During the initial diversification of
the Pasteurellacean subclades the uptake specificity and
USS consensus changed in parallel in one or both lineages. This divergence of genomic USSs may have been
effectively complete before the divergence of the
sequenced species within each subclade, with USS specificities remaining stable since then, although the existence
of Pasteurellaceae with other diverged uptake specificities
cannot be ruled out. Because the USS consensuses within
each subclade are so similar, USS specificity will not enable competent bacteria to distinguish between DNAs
derived from different species within their subclade.
Because many of these DNAs are otherwise sufficiently
diverged that recombination is not only inefficient but
toxic [37,39], forces other than exclusion of non-self DNA
may be responsible for uptake specificity.

recently been inactivated by mutation. All of these
genomes also contain high densities of genetically stable
repeats, either the well-characterized H. influenzae USS or
a related sequence, in each case comprising a 9 bp core
and two adjacent AT-rich segments. The distribution of
the Hin-type and Apl-type USSs corresponds to the two
Pasteurellacean subclades. Competent members of these
subclades discriminate between the two USS types, each
preferring to take up DNA containing the USS typical of its
own genome.
Taken together, these findings are consistent with the following model of the evolution of competence in the Pasteurellaceae: The ancestor of the sequenced Pasteurellaceae
possessed a complete set of functional competence genes
and was naturally competent, taking up DNA by a mechanism very similar to that used by H. influenzae today. The
ancestral genome contained many USSs; these may or
may not have been simpler than the USSs in its descendants, but likely had the common motif ANNNGCGGT in

What are the implications for other bacterial families? We
suggest that the evolutionary history of competence often
follows the pattern shown in Fig. 8. In this model, the
ancestors of many bacterial families were naturally competent but competence has been and continues to be frequently lost. Mutations causing loss of competence have
not always been strongly selected against, and sometimes
may have been actively favoured, so non-competent lineages often persist. However, over the long term the noncompetent lineages are selected against, so that all extant
bacteria have recent ancestors who were competent. This
hypothesis is consistent not only with our family-level
analysis but with the extensive evidence of sporadic distribution of competence within individual species [3-6]. The
pattern is similar to that seen for the mismatch repair system, where mutants with defects in mutation prevention
can experience a short-term advantage but are eventually
eliminated by selection against accumulating deleterious
mutations [40].
Many questions remain unanswered. How deep is the
ancestry of competence? Are some bacterial families
ancestrally not competent? Have some modern species
completely lost competence? Do genes introduced by conjugation or transduction ever restore competence to noncompetent lineages? Thanks to the ever-increasing availability of new genome sequences, answers to these questions will soon be within reach.

isolates, we used the more complete 129-PT sequence.
Four incomplete A. pleuropneumoniae genome sequences
were listed at NCBI; however we used our nearly complete
sequence of strain L20 (serotype 5 b, sequence available
from JN on request). The genome sequences of M. haemolytica and A. actinomycetemcomitans are also in progress
and not yet available at NCBI.
Complete genome sequences with annotations were
retrieved from the NCBI website [43] for H. influenzae Rd

str. Pm70 (NC_002663.gbk), M. succiniciproducens

P. aeruginosa PA01(NC_002516.gbk). Unfinished
genome sequences were obtained for A. actinomycetemcomitans from [44] and for H. somnus 129-PT from [45].
Preliminary sequence data for M. haemolytica were
obtained from the Baylor College of Medicine Human
Genome Sequencing Center [46,47]. Open reading frames
for genome sequences lacking annotation were identified
from the draft sequence using the GLIMMER software
package (now available at [48]).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis used the amino acid sequences of
the following 12 H. influenzae genes and their best homologues in the other 7 Pasteurellaceaen genomes and in E.
coli: gapdH (HI0001), lepA (HI0016), ffh (HI0106), serS
(HI0110), secD (HI0240), dapA (HI0255), ruvB
(HI0312), xerC (HI0676),ispB (HI0881), secA (HI0909),
crp (HI0957), and dnaJ (HI1238). Homologues were
identified using the BLASTP program (E-val < 10-50) in the
BLAST package [49]. For each gene, the amino acid

sequences from the 9 genomes were aligned using CLUSTALW with output in PHYLIP format [50]. The aligned
sequences were inspected, the ends were trimmed to
remove sequence missing in any of the 9 genomes, and
the alignments of the 12 genes were concatenated to produce a single long alignment.
Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated alignment used
the PHYLIP software package [51]. ProML analysis using
maximum likelihood with the JTT method and a gammaplus-invariant-sites distribution of rates across sites
yielded a predicted tree with estimated phylogenetic distances. SeqBoot was then used to produce 100 datasets by
bootstrapping resampling; these were put into ProML to
generate phylogenetic trees. The final bootstrap analysis
was done using the program Consense and the bootstrap
values were added to the tree generated with the complete
sequence above.
Homology of USS-encoded peptides
BLAST searches were used to identify those USS-containing H. influenzae genes that had homologues in all of E.
coli, V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa. ClustalW was used to
align the homologous protein sequences, with the default
penalties of 10 for gap opening and 0.2 for gap extension.
Analysis was restricted to 43aa segments centred on
amino acids encoded by the USS core that showed >50%
amino acid identity across all homologues. All gaps
within these alignments were tabulated.
Repeat analysis
The Perl program repeat_finder was developed to search
genome sequences for abundant short DNA sequences
(code available at [52]). It was used to tabulate the occurrences of the 20 most abundant 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, and
12-mers for each of the 8 Pasteurellacaean genomes,
along with the number of each expected for a randomsequence genome of that size and nucleotide composition.

All occurrences of the 9 bp putative USS core for each species were identified, and 50-bp sequence segments containing the core plus 11 bases upstream and 30 bases
downstream were aligned. The program WebLogo [7,53])
was used to visualize the consensus for each USS. Similar
analyses were done for each genome using all singly mismatched occurrences of the 9 bp core, and for A. pleuropneumoniae using consensus sequences derived from the
two flanking regions.
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 15 (strain HS143) and H.
influenzae Rd (strain KW20) were grown in Brain Heart
Infusion broth (Difco) supplemented with the recommended concentrations of NAD and hemin (H. influenzae

only), and were made competent by transfer of exponentially growing cells to MIV starvation medium as
described for H. influenzae[54]. Aliquots of competent
cells were stored at -80°C and thawed immediately before
use.
DNA labeling
Chromosomal DNAs of H. influenzae Rd and A. pleuropneumoniae were labeled by nick-translation with alpha33P-dATP to specific activities of 2 × 107 cpm/μg. Fragments of about 200 bp centered synthetic USSs (USS-Hin:

USS-Apl:

BglII ends. The amplified fragments were cut with BglII
and end-labeled with Klenow polymerase using alpha33P-dATP, to specific activities of 106–107 cpm/μg.
DNA uptake
Competent cells of H. influenzae strain KW20 and A. pleuropneumoniae strain HS143 (1.0 ml; ~1 × 109 cfu) were
incubated with 150 ng of labeled chromosomal DNA or
20 ng of labeled PCR fragment for 15 minutes at 37°C,
followed by 5 minutes incubation with DNase I at 1 μg/
ml. Cells were then washed three times at room temperature by pelleting and resuspension in 1.0 ml of MIV, and
the radioactivity of the pellets was counted.

Transformation-competition experiments
Competent cells of H. influenzae strain KW20 and A. pleuropneumoniae strain HS143 (0.2 ml) were incubated for 15
minutes at 37°C with 100 ng of genetically marked conspecific DNA (MAP7 DNA for H. influenzae [54] and
sodC::Kan DNA for A. pleuropneumoniae [25]) mixed with
100, 300, or 900 ng of competing DNA (H. influenzae
KW20, A. pleuropneumoniae HS143, B. subtilis or H. parasuis (strain Nagasaki) DNA). DNaseI was then added at
1.0 μg/ml for a further five minutes and cells were then
diluted and plated on supplemented BHI plates containing 2.5 μg.ml novobiocin (H. influenzae) or 25 μg/ml kanamycin (A. pleuropneumoniae). Data were plotted using the

and competition experiments, drafted the manuscript and
produced the figures. WAF carried out most of the bioinformatics analyses. JB analyzed the H. parasuis sequences.
ADSC identified and analysed the competence genes in
each species. JHEN participated in the bioinformatics
analyses. All authors helped interpret the results and write
