Abstract
Background: Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV) is a
significant disease among domestic and wild cattle. The BHV-1 infection was first detected in
Finland in 1970; presumably it was imported in 1968. The infection reappeared in the large-scale
bulk-tank milk surveillances which started in 1990, and was eradicated in 1994. Our aim is to
describe the epidemiology of this infection in Finland, and its eradication.
Materials and methods: The official sources of pertinent information, the legal basis for the
disease control and the serological methods for the detection of the infection are described.
Results and conclusion: Ten AI bulls were found to be seropositive in 1970–1971. The total
number of herds with BHV-1 antibody positive animals in the large-scale surveillance in 1990 and
subsequent epidemiological investigations in 1991 was five, and the total number of seropositive
animals was 90. The five herds formed three epidemiological units; semen of at least one bull
seropositive in 1971 had been used in each unit. This remained the only plausible route of infection
in each of the three units. Using the 'test and slaughter' approach and total stamping out in one
herd the infection was eradicated in 1994.

Background
Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV) is a significant disease among
domestic and wild bovine animals [1,2]. Clinical signs of
the infection include symptoms of inflammatory processes on both respiratory and genital organs, and abortion. Young calves can develop a systemic disease affecting
visceral organs [3].
The disease is caused by the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae of the Herpesviri-

dae family. Only a single serotype of BHV-1 is recognized,
but subtypes of BHV-1 have been described on the basis
of restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of viral DNA.
These types are referred to as BHV-1.1 (respiratory subtype), BHV-1.2 (respiratory and genital subtype) [4].
BHV-1 is able to establish a latent infection in the trigeminal or sacral ganglia [5]. Animals with a latent BHV-1
infection may serve as a source of infection for susceptible
animals if and when the virus is reactivated [6]. The infection is transmitted mainly through respiratory, ocular or
genital secretions in a direct contact between animals.

However, the infection can also spread through fresh or
frozen semen from infected bulls [7-9].

the tested dairy herds were a random sample, approximately 1/4 of the total. Every 3th to every 5th of the beef
animals were sampled at the slaughterhouse, when the
daily number of the animals to be slaughtered allowed
this, otherwise every animal was sampled. The range of
the proportion of beef herds these samples represented
was estimated to be 70–90%. The insemination statistics
of the implicated bulls, and of the herds and were
obtained from the registers of ProAgria Agricultural Data
Processing Centre Ltd, Vantaa Finland, the latter with written permission from the herd owners.

The disease is notifiable in many, but not all countries.
Common control measures against IBR/IPV include
screening, surveillance, precautions at borders and a modified stamping out policy. Many countries allow and carry
out vaccinations, while vaccination is prohibited in countries that have eradicated the disease [2]. Serological testing for the infection in Finland started in 1965, and
antibodies against BHV-1 were encountered for the first
time in 1970–1971 among bulls at an artificial insemination (AI) station. The infection surfaced again in 1990 in
a large herd with respiratory problems among calves, and
in the first bulk-tank milk (BTM) surveillance for selected
viral infections in the same year. The infection was eradicated in 1994. Our purpose is to review the official control
measures, the epidemiology of the infection in Finland
and its eradication.

Finnish legislation concerning IBR/IPV
An administrative decision was issued by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in 1978 which required
systematic testing of AI bulls for antibodies against BHV1. A circular was sent out by MAF in 1993 defining the
measures for controlling IBR/IPV, based on the amended
Act (809/92) to the Animal Diseases Act (55/80). The disease is notifiable, and a herd suspected of having animals
with IBR/IPV is placed under restrictive measures by the
official municipal veterinarian. The decision to take
restrictive measures can also be based on results from the
annual BTM surveillance. All animals in a suspect herd are
examined serologically for antibodies against BHV-1. If
the results are negative the restrictions are withdrawn.

Materials and methods
Sources of the data
The data of the targeted testing of specific groups of animals for antibodies against BHV-1 between 1965 and
1989 were extracted from the annual statistics compiled
by the State Veterinary Institute. The tested animals consisted mainly of heifers to be exported to the Soviet
Union, live animals imported into Finland, and animals
with respiratory infections for which a definite diagnosis
was considered necessary. The sample was not actually
random but selected, taken each year, especially in the
case of heifers, from the same BHV-1 free herds. The data
are shown in Table 1. Systematic testing of sera from AI
bulls was introduced in 1978.

The herd owner is informed in writing of the decision to
take restrictive measures and these include the following:
- All seropositive and clinically ill animals must be isolated to the extent possible and kept indoors
- Bovine animals can only be transported from the farm
for slaughter

Each dairy herd was tested annually since 1991 for antibodies against BHV-1. The individual serum samples in
Table 2 represent the continued targeted testing of specific
groups of animals after 1989. Besides this, a random sample of sera of beef animals were tested since 1993 (see
Table 2). The numbers were extracted from the annual statistics compiled by the State Veterinary Institute and, since
1994, by National Veterinary and Food Institute. In 1990

- Delivery of bovine semen from the herd and the use of
animals for natural mating are prohibited
- After the seropositive animals have been culled the stalls
and appliances must be cleaned and disinfected with disinfectants that are active against viruses

- Unnecessary visits to the animal shed must be avoided.
The use of protective clothing and footwear in the animal
shed is mandatory
- No restrictions are imposed on the use of milk or its
delivery to the dairy.
Restrictive measures are only withdrawn after seropositive
animals have been culled and the other animals have
tested negative twice, one month after the culling and
then four months after the first test, at the earliest. The
slaughter can be carried out at partial state expense (75%
of the animal's value with the slaughter value deducted)
on application by the owner and recommendation by the
municipal and district veterinarians. The municipal veterinarian is obliged to conduct an epidemiological investigation to map the spread of the infection. Vaccination
against IBR/IPV in Finland is subject to approval by the
Food and Health Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
Serological methods to detect IBR/IPV
The serological method used in testing prior to 1990 was
virus neutralization (VN) test, also referred to as serum
neutralization (SN) test. This is a prescribed test for international trade [1], but the actual sensitivity (se) or specificity (sp) of the test depend on laboratory performance.
The se or sp of the pre-1990 test method performed in
State Veterinary Institute (VELL, later EELA) can no longer
be traced. The VN test has only been used since 1990 for
confirmatory purposes. The commercial ELISA kit,
CHEKIT-Trachitest (Dr Bommeli AG, CH-3097 LiebefeldBern, Switzerland) has been used to test individual animal
sera since 1990. The same test was also used in 1990–
1994 for large scale annual surveillance for antibodies in

BTM samples, but the SVANOVA IBR-Ab Kit (SVANOVA
Biotech AB, Uppsala Science Park, SE-751 83, Sweden)
replaced it in 1995. Estimates of the se or sp for the
CHEKIT-Trachitest are not available from the manufacturer, but Rosskopf et al. [10] evaluated the test with material from herds with a known disease status. According to
the report, the CHEKIT-Trachitest showed a sensitivity of
94–99.3% and a specificity of 81.5–98.5% for serum samples. The manufacturer of the SVANOVA IBR-Ab kit
quotes figures of 100% se and 92% sp, relative to SN test.
The se and sp of milk vs. serum are quoted as 92.8% and
100%, respectively. Kits without a control well for each
sample were used in large scale testing for reasons of economy. Positive samples were retested using kits with control wells.

Results
Surveillance of the infection
The numbers of sera examined for antibodies against
BHV-1 in the annual targeted testing prior to 1990, as well
as the results of the serological testing are shown in Table
1. The increase in the numbers reflects revisions of administrative decisions concerning animal disease control.

Data of the annual BTM surveillance and of targeted testing of both routine disease testing samples and random
samples from beef herds, sent into the national central
laboratory between 1990 and 2003, are shown in Table 2
Epidemiological information on BHV-1 antibody-positive
animals and herds
The infection was encountered for the first time in December 1970, when the serum of an AI bull showing signs of
respiratory infection tested positive for antibodies against
BHV-1. Nine of its AI station mates were also found to be

seropositive on closer examination in 1971 (Table 1).
One of the seropositive bulls had been imported from
Denmark in 1968 and it is quite possible that this animal
brought the infection to the station and spread it to the
other bulls. Importing of live animals to AI stations
required a permit in the sixties, but was still possible. The
total number of antibody-positive herds detected in
1990–1991 was five (Table 3): a cluster of four herds in
southern Finland, and one separate herd in the northwestern part of the country. The total number of traced
contact herds of these five herds between 1988 and 1991
was 54. All individual animals of the herds B, D and F, and
the contact herds C and E, except of one non-compliant
herd, were examined in 1991. All 28 contact herds of
herds C and E were also traced and their animals tested
individually. All except D, contact of E, were seronegative.
Details of the AI station, the five seropositive herds, and
epidemiological information are presented in Table 3.

Applied control measures
The seropositive bulls on the AI station were not culled as
this was not required by law, and many served the full
term. The herd B and the BTM antibody-positive herds D
and F were placed under restrictive measures in 1991. The
seropositive animals in herds D and F were culled and
both the BTM and individual sera of the animals in these
herds were retested after the required periods. In both
cases the subsequent samples were all negative and the
restrictive measures were withdrawn. The seropositive
contact herds C and E were dealt with in the same way as
herds D and F. The one non-compliant contact herd (of
herd B) was also placed under restrictive measures, as a
suspected BHV-1 positive herd. The two animals bought
from herd B to this herd were tested at slaughter and
found to be seronegative. The herd was subsequently
cleared in 1993. After four years under restrictive measures
the herd B was entirely stamped out in 1994.

The capital letter denotation of herds in the following
refers to Table 3. Herd B was detected by signs of respiratory infection, such as fever, nasal discharge and dyspnea
in young stock; however, herd B was also BTM antibodypositive; this is reflected in Table 2 where the number of
BTM antibody-positive herds in 1990 is three. The herds
formed three apparent epidemiological units. Herds B
and C were neighbours and had animal and personnel
contacts. The only seropositive animal in herd C had been
purchased from B. Herd E served as a young stock raising
operation for herd D, such that the heifers were inseminated when in herd E and returned to herd D approximately 1 month before parturition. The third
epidemiological unit was the geographically separate herd
F. The insemination statistics of the herds revealed that
semen from three AI bulls found to be seropositive in
1971 had been used in herds B, E and F, and had come
from a different bull for each herd. This means that possibly infected semen had been used in each epidemiological
unit, which remains the only plausible route of transmission for each unit.

Discussion
The rarity of the BHV-1 infection in Finland indicates an
introduction in the late sixties, despite the fact that herd
management practices do not in general favour the spread
of infectious agents. The infection was not mentioned in
the comprehensive review of animal virus diseases in Finland, published in 1964 [11]. It is quite possible that the
semen from the three implicated AI bulls, that was used
between 1968 and 1979 spread the infection to a number
of dairy herds and that it persisted in these herds for over
a decade. E.g. Mollema et al. [12] have shown that herpesvirus can persist for more than 40 years in small (n = 20)
host populations. The average herd size was around 10 in
the sixties and is still less than 20 in 2006. Another conceivable route for the introduction of BHV-1 into the
country could have been through the extensive contacts
with foreign personnel on one of the herds (herd B).
However, there is nothing to substantiate this claim and it
could only explain the infection for one of the epidemiological units. Unfortunately no isolates of the virus were
ever obtained from the semen or the infected animals to

provide sequence-based phylogenetic support for a common origin. Thus there is no conclusive proof of the
semen-mediated transmission, however, taken together
the well known potential of transmitting IBR via semen,
the fact that semen from infected bulls had been used in
each of the epidemiological units and the very strict official import policy on live animals before 1995, this route
is by far the most probable.
A figure for the total number of supposedly semeninfected dairy herds can be estimated from the proportion
of known infected herds (3) to the total number of dairy
herds in 1990 (45,500), and the total number of dairy
herds which used AI services in early seventies (120,000)
[13], assuming that semen was indeed the only source of
infection and that the number of infected herds had only
been reduced by the closure of dairy farms. When you
divide the estimated 8 herds into the total number of
herds (23,820) in which semen from the three implicated
AI bulls had been used, then this gives a transmission efficacy of approximately 1/3,000 inseminations. The low
efficacy concurs with the notion that the shedding of the
virus into the semen only takes place for a few days [14],
or is intermittent and that the titer of the virus in semen is
only occasionally sufficient to infect the dam [15,16].
Routine annual screening between 1972 and 1989,
including AI bulls, did not reveal any BHV-1 antibodypositive animals. This is not surprising given that the
mean number of samples examined between 1986 and
1989 (Table 1) represented only 0.15% of the contemporary cattle population of approximately 1,400,000 heads.
The probability of detecting an infection with this sample
size, using the total number of seropositive animals (90)
as an estimate for the infection prevalence (0.006%), is no
more than 12% (assuming a random sample and a perfect
test; calculated with WinEpiscope 2.0, see [17] for details).
IBR/IPV has been eradicated during the nineties from a
few European countries, e.g. Austria, Denmark and Sweden, and the disease-free status of these countries was last
confirmed by the EU Commission in 2004 [1]. Switzerland and Norway are also recognized as being free of the
disease [18,19]. These countries do not vaccinate against
IBR/IPV. The role of vaccination in eradication campaigns
is controversial. Kujik [20] claimed that if there are > 15–
20% seropositive animals in the population, vaccination
is the most realistic strategy to eradicate IBR/IPV. Noordegraaf et al. [21] even submitted the idea that a compulsory
vaccination programme would be necessary to eradicate
the disease. On the other hand, separation or culling of
the seropositive animals and restocking with seronegative
animals is shown to be a valid alternative to vaccination,
at least at the herd level [22,23]. In Finland the clinical
suspicion, BTM antibody surveillance and epidemiologi-

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/49/1/3

cal investigations in 1990–1991 rounded up five BHV-1
antibody-positive herds. Using vaccines to control and
eradicate the infection was deliberated (L. Sihvonen, personal communication) but there were no marker vaccines
available at the time and the situation was not considered
serious enough to justify the risks involved in using live
vaccines. Furthermore, the small total number of known
infected herds did not support the notion of a wholesale
vaccination campaign. Hence a decisive 'test and slaughter' policy to control IBR/IPV was adopted. This policy
proved successful, which is reflected by the short time, i.e.
5 years, between the detection and eradication of the
infection. The time could have been even shorter, had it
not been for one herd (Table 2). Cattle owners were entitled to financial compensation if animals from their herds
were culled for seropositivity or the actual disease and this
was no doubt a key to the success of the project, as was the
case with the eradication of enzootic bovine leukosis [24].
Annual surveillance of all dairy herds for antibodies
against BHV-1 in BTM samples and of beef animals at
slaughter are continuing and the results are reported to the
EU Commission. The Commission set additional guarantees relating to IBR/IPV for bovines destined for Finland in
1994 based on the country's disease free status, and these
guarantees were last confirmed in 2004 [18].

Conclusion
The available information suggests that the BHV-1 virus
infection was imported into Finland in 1968 along an
infected AI bull, and that it spread in 1968–1979 via
semen of the bulls that contracted the infection at the station. Once the extent of the spread was established in
large-scale annual surveillances in 1990–1992, effective
control measures at the expense of the state were taken.
The infection was eradicated in 1994 and the additional
guarantees of EU Commission have applied to Finland
since then. Annual bulk-tank milk surveillances and testing of individual animal sera for antibodies against BHV1 are continuing
