Abstract
Background: Ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild
animals. The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical
parts of the world where it is endemic. Tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored. The objective of this study
was to explore the R. microplus microbiome by applying the bacterial 16S tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon
pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) technique to characterize its bacterial diversity. Pyrosequencing was performed on adult
males and females, eggs, and gut and ovary tissues from adult females derived from samples of R. microplus
collected during outbreaks in southern Texas.
Results: Raw data from bTEFAP were screened and trimmed based upon quality scores and binned into individual
sample collections. Bacteria identified to the species level include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
chromogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Serratia marcescens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and
Finegoldia magna. One hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues
sampled. The total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised: 53 in adult males, 61 in adult females,
11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. Notable genera detected in the cattle tick include
Wolbachia, Coxiella, and Borrelia. The molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative
abundance of the microbiota associated with R. microplus.
Conclusions: This report represents the first survey of the bacteriome in the cattle tick using non-culture based
molecular approaches. Comparisons of our results with previous bacterial surveys provide an indication of
geographic variation in the assemblages of bacteria associated with R. microplus. Additional reports on the
identification of new bacterial species maintained in nature by R. microplus that may be pathogenic to its
vertebrate hosts are expected as our understanding of its microbiota expands. Increased awareness of the role R.
microplus can play in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria will enhance our ability to mitigate its economic
impact on animal agriculture globally. This recognition should be included as part of analyses to assess the risk for
re-invasion of areas like the United States of America where R. microplus was eradicated.

Background
Ticks are considered to be second only to mosquitoes as
worldwide vectors of human diseases, but they are
regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing
pathogens in domestic and wild animals [1]. The cattle

tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the
world where it is endemic. For example, the economic
impact on the cattle industry in Brazil by the cattle tick
R. microplus is estimated to be two billion U.S. dollars
annually [2]. In addition to direct economic loss associated with blood feeding by R. microplus during infestation, indirect effects are also significant due to the
transmission of diseases like bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis caused by the apicomplexan protozoans

Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina, and the bacterium
Anaplasma marginale, respectively. The vector competency of R. microplus for A. marginale suggests that
other microbial associations with this tick host may
exist. However, quantitative and qualitative information
on the composition of bacterial communities in R.
microplus is scarce.
Seminal studies by Smith and Kilbourne at the end of
the 19 th century demonstrating that Rhipicephalus
annulatus transmitted B. bigemina triggered research on
other microorganisms harbored by ticks [3,4]. Currently,
our understanding of ticks as vectors of infectious
agents has advanced to the point where some tick-borne
bacterial diseases are considered an emerging infectious
threat globally [5,6]. It is estimated that the number of
described tick-borne pathogens affecting humans and
animals will increase as research on tick biology and
ecology progresses [7]. In some cases, species related to
pathogenic bacteria were detected and identified in ticks
before their effect on human health was fully determined [8]; but our knowledge of bacterial communities
in ticks beyond pathogenic species is limited, even
though the association between non-pathogenic bacteria
and ticks was documented at the beginning of the 20th
century [9].
Bacteria are ubiquitous microorganisms and some
have evolved symbioses with ticks. In addition to transmitting pathogenic bacteria that include species in the
genera Borrelia, Rickettsia, Francisella, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Coxiella, ticks also harbor bacterial endosymbionts which can have commensal, mutualistic, or
parasitic relationships with their tick hosts [10-12]. The
study of bacterial communities in ticks that transmit
disease-causing agents has revealed new microbial associations including previously unknown tick-borne pathogens or vector competencies [13-15]. Elucidating the
taxonomic composition of symbiotic bacteria facilitates
our understanding of phylogenetic relationships between
symbionts and the evolutionary biology of their association with tick hosts [16]. Microbial interactions within
the tick host may influence pathogen characteristics and
dynamics including transmission [17,18]. Additionally,
the functional and genomic characterization of endosymbionts could provide opportunities for genetic engineering whereby transformants could be developed for
use as microbial acaricides.
Molecular methods offer an expedient and efficient
opportunity to analyze bacterial communities in ticks
avoiding the need for intensive culture-based techniques,
and furthermore, allow the identification of species
which are not amenable to culturing. Specifically, pyrosequencing of partially amplified 16S rRNA sequences
has been applied to study the composition of bacteria
associated with biological systems including insect

vectors [19-21]. Here, we evaluated bacterial diversity
associated with R. microplus using bTEFAP. Bacterial
composition was investigated in the egg, adult male and
female life stages, and ovary and gut tissues from adult
female cattle ticks. This report represents the first comprehensive survey of bacterial communities associated
with the cattle tick using a culture-independent method.

Results
Estimated richness and diversity of bacterial communities

The application of bTEFAP reported here enabled us to
explore the genome of bacterial symbionts, i.e. the
microbiome, living inside and outside the cattle tick R.
microplus as a means to initiate the characterization of
the microbiota associated with this tick species of economic significance in animal agriculture worldwide. A
total of 183,626 sequences were generated and a total of
130,019 sequences utilized for analyses of the 18 samples. Thus, an average of 7200 sequences > 350 bp (avg
length 450 bp) per sample were analyzed after all quality
control and screening steps. Indices of bacterial richness
and diversity, based on Operational Taxonomic Unit
(OTU) estimated through Rarefaction curve, Ace, and
Chao1 procedures, are summarized in Table 1. Rarefaction and Richards maximum predicted curve modeling
indicated that > 98% of OTUs at the 5% divergence
were achieved for each sample [22], which suggests adequate depth of coverage (data not shown). Although
results are presented at the 1, 3, and 5% dissimilarity
levels, attention is focused on OTUs at 5% dissimilarity
since it has been reported that reasonable genus-level
richness can be achieved using that degree of discrimination [22]. By rarefaction analysis estimates, the trend
for genera richness at 5% dissimilarity was: egg>gut >
adult male > adult female > ovary.
Identification and quantification of bacterial taxa

In addition to surveying bacterial diversity across tick
life stages and tissues, pyrosequencing also allowed
assessment of the relative abundance of the taxonomic
levels of bacteria detected (Figure 1). Tracebacks entered

bacterial classifications were based upon the percent identity of the sample sequence to known sequences, the percent divergence was then used
to adjust identifications to the taxonomic level with the highest degree of confidence (e.g. a percent divergence < 3% can be expected to provide
confidence at the species level, > 3% but < 5% at the genera level, etc.). Classifications were compiled after traceback. Legend and scale shown in

novel bacterial species. Genera that may include previously undescribed species of bacteria associated with
the cattle tick include Coxiella, Achromobacter, Corynebacterium, Staphyloccocus, Anaerobiospirillum, Roseburia, Prevotella, Nocardioides, and Vagoccocus.

Bacteria identified to the species level include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Serratia
marcescens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Finegoldia magna. Staphylococcus aureus was present in adult
males, eggs, and the gut of adult female cattle ticks.
Similar findings were reported for the closely related
tick species Rhipicephalus decoloratus and Rhipicephalus
geigyi in Africa where S. aureus was isolated from the
hemolymph of adult females and their eggs [23]. However, there was no evidence of transovarial transmission
for S. aureus in those tick species. We detected S. chromogenes in adult male and female ticks. Staphylococcus
chromogenes was isolated previously from R. microplus
collected in Australia using a culture-dependent
approach after the ticks had been surface-sterilized [24].
Staphylococcus chromogenes is part of the natural skin
flora of cattle but can cause mastitis, and in pigs it may
provoke exudative epidermitis [25,26].
The other five bacterial species represent previously
unreported associations for R. microplus. Whereas C.
glutamicum and S. marcescens were detected in eggs
only, S. sciuri was present in male and female ticks, F.
magna in eggs and female ticks, and S. dysgalactiae in
eggs, male ticks, and female ticks. Because of our permissive approach to assess bacterial diversity, e.g., the
ticks used in this study were not disinfected prior to
DNA extraction, the prevalence of these new bacterial
associations with R. microplus needs to be confirmed.
However, it is relevant to note that S. dysgalactiae and
S. marcescens are known to cause bovine mastitis,
whereas F. magna was detected in papillomatous digital
dermatitis lesions of cattle [27-29]. Staphylococcus
sciuris is commonly found in the skin of cattle and
other animals, while the natural habitats of C. glutamicum include soil, soils contaminated with bird feces,
sewage and manure, and vegetables and fruits [30,31]. In
their natural environment, R. microplus eggs may be
exposed to C. glutamicum after oviposition by gravid
female ticks.
Clustering analysis showed that the microbial biota
detected in the ovary tissue of adult female ticks was
the most dissimilar tissue of all the tick samples tested
(Figure 1). Additionally, the least diverse microbial biota
was detected in this tissue. Members of the Coxiellaceae
family were the most prevalent bacteria in cattle tick
ovary. Consistent with this finding, the Coxiellaceae
were also found in the egg and adult female samples
(Figure 1).
Relative abundance of bacterial genera by tick life stage
and tissue sample

One hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected
in all the life stages and tissues sampled in this study

Page 4 of 11

(see Additional File 1 Table S1). Among the genera
found in our study, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Paenibacillus,
Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Serratia, Staphylococcus, and Stenotrophomonas are genera previously
reported to be harbored by R. microplus isolated from
ticks collected in Australia [24]. Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus, found in both our study and the
Australian study, were also cultured from homogenates
of R. microplus in Bangladesh that were produced following surface sterilization and dissections using sterile technique [32]. Infection with Achromobacter and Escherichia
was previously reported for cattle ticks from the Bangladesh study but not the Australian study.
Among the life stages sampled, the total number of
bacterial genera detected in the egg, adult male, and
adult female ticks was 54, 53, and 61, respectively (Additional File 1 Table S1). Of those numbers, 25, 25, and 27
genera were unique to the egg, adult male, and adult
female life stages, respectively. By comparison, only 7
bacterial genera were identified in tick ovary, whereas
11 genera were found in the tick gut. Cryobacterium,
Rhodococcus, and Veillonella were identified only in the
ovary, whereas Anaerobiospirillum was the only genera
unique to the gut.
The molecular approach applied in this study allowed
us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota
associated with R. microplus. The predominant genera
in the bacterial communities of the tick samples analyzed based on an abundance cutoff of 1.0% are shown
for each sample in Figure 2. Staphylococcus was relatively abundant ( > 18%) in adult males and eggs, but
not in adult female ticks. Other prevalent genera were
Corynebacterium ( > 13%) in eggs and adult males, and
Coxiella ( > 13%) in tick eggs. Achromobacter (27.7%),
Pseudomonas (12.6%), and Sinorhizobium (7.7%) were
the predominant genera found in adult female ticks.
Among the tissues sampled, Coxiella was the most
abundant (98.2%) genus in ovary, whereas Anaerobiospirillum (29.5%) and Brachybacterium (21.9%) predominated in the tick gut. Other relatively less abundant
genera, but worth noting, include Borrelia (7.9%) in the
tick gut; Clostridium (3.9%) in adult female ticks; Escherichia (1.5%) in the tick gut; Klebsiella (1.3%) in adult
female ticks; Streptococcus in eggs (2.9%) and adult
males (1.%); Enterococcus in adult male ticks (1.4%),
adult female ticks (2.2%), and tick gut (11.4%); and Wolbachia in adult female ticks (1.8%).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the first
exploration of the diversity of the bacterial biota associated with distinct life stages and tissues of the cattle
tick, R. microplus using a nonculturable method.

Previous surveys of bacterial diversity in R. microplus
employed culture methods, and for the most part, those
studies focused on the isolation of bacteria pathogenic
to the tick and vertebrate hosts [24,32-34]. The tagencoded pyrosequencing approach reported here
allowed us to detect and identify bacteria that otherwise
might be fastidious, obligate intracellular, or noncultivable. Surveys of bacteria based on 16S rRNA gene
sequences have proven useful to analyze the microbiome
of bacterial communities in different habitats on and
inside the host’s body [35]. Our understanding of the
ecology and eco-pathogenic relevance of tick-bacterial
relationships is expanding as new associations are
revealed through 16S rRNA gene-based analyses
[14,36,37]. We probed deeply into the cattle tick microbiome using the 16S-bTEFAP technique. One hundred
seven bacterial genera reported here represent new
microbial associations for R. microplus. It has been suggested that the analysis of individual ticks could increase
the ability to recognize bacteria in low copy numbers
whereas the analysis of dissected organs would exclude
the detection of external environmental bacteria [36].
We took a mixed approach by sampling ticks individually, without sterilization and prior to DNA isolation, for
broad-range analysis of bacterial communities, while the
gut and ovary were dissected for testing. Unique bacteria
genera associations were detected for each of the tick
samples tested. The symbiotic relationships for the bacterial genera associated with R. microplus remain to be
characterized.
Although transovarial transmission enables bacterial
colonization very early in the tick life cycle, copulation
and egg fertilization could augment bacteria-tick associations through possibly infected sperm or the microbiota associated with the female genital tract [38]. It
remains to be determined if antimicrobial activity occurs
in R. microplus ejaculate, as has been shown for other
arthropod species [39,40]. The environment where eggs
are deposited influences the type of bacterial communities they are exposed to, which in some cases can
include bacteria pathogenic to engorged females [41].
Ecological factors related to questing behavior facilitate
contact with bacteria in the environment and expand
the complexity of bacterial communities residing on a
tick’s exoskeleton. Further investigation of the microbiota in the tick exoskeleton is needed to understand
the ecology of that microbial habitat in the context of
host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Studies
in other biological systems have revealed the complexity
of such interactions that offer the opportunity to
develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions
[42,43], which in the context of this study could translate into options for tick biological control. Once on the
host, ticks come in contact with the skin microbiota and

Page 6 of 11

become exposed to infected blood to fulfill their obligate
hematophagous habit, or other host body fluids, while
searching for and attaching at predilection sites. Systemic infection with bacteria acquired from the host
skin, including S. marcescens, was documented in Dermacentor andersoni following a stringent, sterile sample
processing protocol prior to tick trituration and media
inoculation with the resulting suspension [44]. Here, it
is documented that R. microplus harbors S. marcescens.
Isolation of the bacterial genera Staphylococcus from R.
annulatus and R. decoloratus, and Streptococcus from R.
annulatus without specific characterization was reported
previously [41,45,46]. Thus, systemic infection of R.
microplus with S. sciuri and S. dysgalactiae may have
occurred through host skin contact. This route of infection could also apply to F. magna because of its presence in the host skin habitat. Since C. glutamicum was
detected in eggs laid by females collected in the field, it
is possible that the ticks acquired the bacterium from
hosts exposed to environmental sources. Given their
economic impact on livestock production systems, our
results indicate cattle transmission studies are warranted
using R. microplus infected with S. dysgalactiae, S. marcescens, and F. magna.
The detection of S. chromogenes in cattle ticks from
Australia and outbreaks in the USA, as well as the suite of
bacterial genera shared by specimens from Australia,
Bangladesh, and the USA noted here suggest that there
may be a core microbiome associated with R. microplus.
Alternatively, bacteria found in common between
R. microplus, R. annulatus, R. decoloratus, and R. geigyi
indicates that microbiota composition is influenced by the
ecological niche they occupy during the parasitic stage, i.e.
cattle. More extensive surveys are required to ascertain the
biogeography of the microbiome across time and space as
well as among and between R. microplus populations. As
it has been shown for other anthropod vector-bacteria systems, these studies will help determine if bacterial communities associated with R. microplus represent random
assemblages and define the influence of biotic and abiotic
factors [14,21,37]. However, special attention is needed to
harmonize sampling methods and molecular protocols
given the rapid development of massively parallel sequencing technologies to facilitate meaningful comparisons.
Additionally, it has been hypothesized that at least two
tick species have evolved under the R. microplus designation [47]. The apparent co-evolution of certain bacterial
lineages with their hosts warrants the application of that
concept to test the hypothesis of genetic and reproductive
divergence between geographic strains of R. microplus
[12,47-49].
The Coxiella-type microbe we detected in R. microplus can be presumed to be an endosymbiont. Although
more abundant in adult females, ovary, and eggs, a weak

Andreotti et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/6

signal for the Coxiella microbe was noticed in one male
tick. A similar observation was reported for a Coxiella
endosymbiont in Amblyomma americanum [14,37]. Its
presence in ovary and eggs indicates that the putative R.
microplus-associated Coxiella endosymbiont can be
transmitted vertically. Most of the bacterial sequences
detected in the ovary were ascribed to the Coxiella
microbe. This may result from selective amplification of
the Coxiella symbiont associated with the expansion of
ovarian tissue that takes place during engorgement since
the ovary was collected from replete female R. microplus
undergoing active oviposition [37,50]. The degree of
relatedness between the R. microplus-associated Coxiella
symbiont, Coxiella endosymbionts in other tick species,
and C. burnetii remains to be determined. This will
facilitate testing the hypothesis that the R. microplusassociated Coxiella microbe is a primary endosymbiont
as documented for the Coxiella spp. infecting A. americanum, which showed a reduced genome in comparison
to C. burnetii [50,51]. Rhipicephalus microplus has been
found to harbor C. burnetii in India and China [52,53].
Our inability to detect C. burnetii in R. microplus from
outbreaks in the USA suggests that the pathogen is not
circulating in that tick population; alternatively, its presence in very low numbers prevented detection through
the method used in this study. The concept of targeting
endosymbionts as a means to control ticks and tickborne diseases has been tested taking the chemotherapeutic approach [54,55]. Using antibiotics to treat the
infection of A. americanum with a Coxiella spp. endosymbiont resulted in reduced reproductive fitness [55].
Novel approaches for endosymbiont isolation and characterization will facilitate in vitro culture to produce
reagents for testing of the immunological approach to
control ticks targeting their endosymbionts [54,56].
Our understanding of the associations between R.
microplus and members of the genus Borrelia keeps
expanding. Borrelia theileri, the etiologic agent of bovine
borreliosis, has been shown to be transmitted by R.
microplus in many parts of the world [57]. Borrelia
burgdorferi was isolated from R. microplus in China
[58]. Detection of the R. microplus-associated Borrelia in
the gut and ovary reported here parallels the systemic
infection with B. theileri where no adverse effects were
observed in tick viability [33,59]. Like the Borrelia DNA
sequences detected in this study, specific identification
awaits for other Borrelia microbes isolated from R.
microplus in diverse geographic locations [60-62]. However, R. microplus may be acting as a bridging vector
facilitating the transmission of microbes across vertebrate hosts and possibly influencing ecological and evolutionary aspects of their natural history. The degree of
similarity at the nucleotide level between a Mexican
isolate of B. theileri and Borrelia spp. infecting A.

Page 7 of 11

americanum from the Northeast region of the USA suggests recent divergence [63]. Because white-tailed deer
and cattle used to be sympatric throughout the southern
USA prior to 1943, which is when cattle ticks were officially eradicated, it has been hypothesized that spirochetes infecting A. americanum may represent a host
shift of B. theileri as R. microplus could have transmitted
the spirochete to both ungulate hosts [64]. A Borrelia
spp. detected in R. microplus from Brazil was shown to
be closely related to B. theileri and Borrelia lonestari
and the cattle tick-deer relationship was suggested as a
natural process for the spread and/or maintenance of
Borrelia spp. [65].
Although bacteria in the genus Wolbachia are generally found in reproductive tissues, the R. microplusassociated Wolbachia was not detected in ovarian tissue,
but in the two adult female ticks assayed individually.
Since ticks from a laboratory colony established in 1999
were the source of the ovarian tissue samples, it is plausible that Wolbachia infection was lost during the colonization process. It is also possible that laboratory
rearing conditions allowed the Coxiella strain in the
R. microplus ovaries sampled to out-compete pre-existing Wolbachia microbes with the eventual loss of infection in La Minita strain. Detection of the Wolbachiatype microbe in adult female ticks does not necessarily
mean that the ovary was the only tissue infected. Disseminated Wolbachia infection has been documented in
other arthropod vector species and similar events were
reported for a Coxiella endosymbiont infecting A. americanum where the salivary glands were also infected
[50,66]. The possibility for horizontal transmission
would exist if Wolbachia infection of the R. microplus
salivary glands were to occur. The horizontal transmission of Wolbachia microbes has been documented to
occur more often than previously thought [67-69]. However, it has been shown in mosquitoes that the size of
Wolbachia symbionts would prevent its free passage
through the salivary ducts [70].
The functional relevance of our findings and observations needs to be tested. Proof of active infection is suggested to confirm the physiological significance of
bacterial DNA detection in R. microplus by tag-encoded
pyrosequencing or any other molecular or non-culturable
approach. Rhipicephalus microplus has evolved various
defense mechanisms acting in the hemocel if the external physical barrier represented primarily by the exoskeloton is bridged. Antimicrobial peptides form part of
the cattle tick immune system [71,72]. Additionally, at
least two types of R. microplus hemocytes exist that
effect phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen
species [73]. Other components of the cattle tick
immune system are likely to be discovered as additional functions are identified and assigned to the

Andreotti et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/6

hemocyte transcriptome [74]. Caution must also be
exercised in defining the relationship of bacteria found
to be associated with R. microplus in this study.
Although a particular genus may include pathogenic
species, several of the bacterial genera detected and
reported here for the first time in association with the
cattle tick comprise groups commonly found in soil, on
the surface of plants, or considered enteric bacteria.
However, similar results from studies where stringent
surface-sterilization was performed and negative controls were tested indicate that such bacteria are truly
associated with R. microplus [14,37]. Lastly, blood feeding has been shown to increase bacterial diversity [37].
Thus, comparative analyses of the R. microplus microbiome between immature stages, unfed and blood-fed
ticks across life stages, laboratory colony and wildcaught specimens, and additional organs and tissues
are warranted [37].
It is worth noting that certain bacteria were detected
in R. microplus by investigators in other parts of the
world. Rhipicephalus microplus was found to harbor
Rickettsia conorii in India [52]. Ehrlichia canis and a
new Ehrlichia species closely related to Ehrlichia chaffeensis were detected in cattle ticks in China and the
Thai-Myanmar border [53,58,75]. Additionally, R. microplus in the Caribbean contained Ehrlichia ruminantium
DNA [76]. Our findings suggest that these pathogens of
economic importance to livestock production systems
are not circulating among outbreak strains of R. microplus in the USA. However, those studies highlight the
potential role of R. microplus as vector of zoonotic bacteria. Although it is considered a rare event, R. microplus can parasitize humans [77,78].
The analysis of our results in the context of previous
bacterial surveys provides an indication of geographic
variation in the assemblages of bacteria associated with
R. microplus. Additional reports on the identification of
new bacterial species maintained in nature by R. microplus that may be pathogenic to its vertebrate hosts are
expected as our understanding of its microbiota
expands. Increased awareness of the role R. microplus
can play in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria will
enhance our ability to mitigate its economic impact on
animal agriculture globally. This recognition should be
included as part of analyses to assess the risk for reinvasion of areas where R. microplus was eradicated like
the USA.

Conclusion
Tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored. By comparison to the proposed strategy to accomplish the
Human Microbiome Project, the work presented here
constitutes the initial data acquisition and analysis
exercise towards a comprehensive analysis of the R.

microplus microbiome. A thorough understanding of the
functional, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of the
bacterial diversity in communities associated with the
cattle tick requires additional investigations. The bacteria we found could have favorable effects on the tick’s
successful infestation of its cattle host, perhaps with
roles in host blood digestion, immunity against infection
by competing microbes potentially deleterious to the
tick, or effects on population structure and fertility. Cattle ticks have evolved in conjunction with bovine hosts;
therefore, bovine-tick interactions have likely influenced
the ecology of their microbiomes. Even within the tick
itself, there are feedback mechanisms influencing interactions at the host-microbiome interface. Our results
further document the co-infection of cattle ticks with
several bacteria, even in the presence of antimicrobial
factors that are known to be produced by the tick
immune system response in their hemolymph and gut
tissues. Further investigations on the cattle tick microbiome are likely to enhance our understanding of the
roles this cosmopolitan species serves as vector of bacteria that may be pathogenic to its vertebrate hosts.

Methods
Tick samples

Adult male and female ticks were obtained from a R.
microplus infestation outbreak on cattle from Starr
County, TX. Samples from the infestation were collected
by USDA personnel in November, 2008, and shipped to
the USDA Cattle Fever Tick Research Laboratory in
Moore Field, TX, where the samples were frozen at
-80°C. Prior to freezing, eggs were collected from gravid
females, mixed together, and pooled and labeled as f1
generation. A portion of these f1 eggs were used to
establish a laboratory colony to obtain adult ticks as
described previously [79]. Two adult females and two
adult males developed from these f1 eggs and three
small clumps of approximately 100 f1 eggs each were
used for the DNA extraction and pyrosequencing. The
gut and ovary samples were obtained from the f20 generation of the La Minita strain of R. microplus that has
been maintained Babesia-free at the University of Idaho
Holm Research Center since 1999. The founding ticks
for this strain were originally collected in Starr County,
TX, in 1996. Using standard protocols approved by the
University of Idaho Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, La Minita larvae were placed on a stanchioned calf and replete females collected and dissected
under sterile phosphate-buffered saline during the period of active oviposition. The ventral cuticle was excised;
the ovaries and gut separately removed, rinsed in sterile
saline, and held on ice until 5 ticks were dissected. The
tissues were frozen at -80°C. A clump (~5 mm diameter) of the frozen material was broken off and used

Andreotti et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/6

for pyrosequencing analysis. All samples used in this
study were collected under open benchtop conditions.
Neither surface sterilization nor sterile dissection techniques were employed during sample preparation steps
prior to DNA extractions.

Pyrosequencing and analysis

Bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing
(bTEFAP) was conducted as described previously
[19,20]. Our approach was modified slightly to utilize
the Titanium sequencing platform rather than FLX
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) to take advantage of the longer average read lengths generated by the
Titanium methodology. Additionally, we used a single
35 cycle PCR step with Qiagen HotStar Master Mix and
addition of 0.5U of HotStar HiFidelity Polymerase in
each reaction (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Finally,
sequences used for analysis had average read length of
~450 bp with sequencing extending from the 27F 5’
GAG TTT GAT CNT GGC TCA G 3’ to 519r 5’ GTN
TTA CNG CGG CKG CTG 3’ in relation to E. coli 16S
extending across V1 and into the V3 ribosomal region
(Research and Testing Laboratory, Lubbock, TX).
Amplicon sequencing was performed based upon the
manufacturers protocols (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for Titanium sequencing on FLX-titanium
platform. Raw data from bTEFAP was screened and
trimmed based upon quality scores of Phred20 average
and binned into individual sample collections. Sequence
collections were then depleted of chimeras using
B2C2 [80].
The resulting files were then depleted of short reads
(< 350 bp) and bacterial species identified using BlastN
comparison to a quality controlled and manually curated
database derived from the NCBI. Data was compiled and
relative percentages of each bacterial identification were
determined for each individual sample. Data was also
compiled at each individual taxonomic level according
to the NCBI taxonomy criteria as described previously
[19,20]. Rarefaction, Ace, and Chao 1 analyses to estimate mathematically predicted diversity and richness in
tick samples was performed with DOTUR as described
elsewhere [22,81].
