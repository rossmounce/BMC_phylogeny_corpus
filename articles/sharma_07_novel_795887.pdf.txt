Abstract
Background: Y-chromosomal haplogroup (Y-HG) Q is suggested to originate in Asia and
represent recent founder paternal Native American radiation into the Americas. This group is
delineated into Q1, Q2 and Q3 subgroups defined by biallelic markers M120, M25/M143 and M3,
respectively. Recently, a novel subgroup Q4 has been identified which is defined by bi-allelic marker
M346, representing HG Q (0.41%, 3/728) in Indian population. With scanty details of HG Q in Asia,
especially India, it was pertinent to explore the status of the Y-HG Q in Indian population to gather
an insight to determine the extent of diversity within this region.
Results: We observed 15/630 (2.38%) Y-HG Q individuals in India with an ancestral state at M120,
M25, M3 and M346 markers, indicating an absence of already known Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 subhaplogroups. Interestingly, we further observed a novel 4 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism (ss4
bp, rs41352448) at 72,314 position of human arylsulfatase D pseudogene, defining a novel sublineage Q5 (in 5/15 individuals, i.e., 33.3 % of the observed Y-HG Q) with distributions independent
of the social, cultural, linguistic and geographical affiliations in India.
Conclusion: The study adds another sublineage Q5 in the already existing arrangement of Y-HG
Q in literature. It was quite interesting to observe an ancestral state Q* and a novel sub-branch
Q5, not reported elsewhere, in Indian subcontinent, though in low frequency. A novel subgroup
Q4 was identified recently which is also restricted to Indian subcontinent. The most plausible
explanation for these observations could be an ancestral migration of individuals bearing ancestral
lineage Q* to Indian subcontinent followed by an autochthonous differentiation to Q4 and Q5
sublineages later on. However, other explanations of, either the presence of both the sub
haplogroups (Q4 and Q5) in ancestral migrants or recent migrations from central Asia, cannot be
ruled out till the distribution and diversity of these subgroups is explored extensively in Central
Asia and other regions.

Background
In the past, markers on the non-recombining region of the
Y chromosome (NRY) have been used extensively as a
male complement to mtDNA to study the colonization or
migration histories within the different regions of the
world. Y-chromosomal haplogroup (Y-HG) Q, defined by
either of the binary markers P36/MEH2 [1] or M242 [2],
has been suggested to originate in Asia and represent
recent founder paternal Native American radiation into
the Americas. In Eurasia, haplogroup Q chromosomes
have been reported with the highest frequency in Siberian
populations, distributed primarily across Northwest and
Northeast Siberia with the vast majority in only two Siberian populations, the Kets (93.8%) and the Selkups
(66.4%) [3]. Other population groups from the region
bearing this haplogroup include, Kyrgyz (2%), Kazak
(6%), Kallar (1%), Shiraz (8%), Bartangi (13%), Korean
(2%), Yagnobi (3%), Esfahan (6%), Turkmen (10%),
Dungan (8%), Tuvinian (17%), Uzbek/Kashkadarya
(5%), Shugnan (11%), Uzbek/Bukhara (2%), Uzbek/Surkhandarya (4%), Yadhava (3%), Kazan Tatar (3%), Tajik/
Samarkand (5%), Uighur (5%), Uzbek/Khorezm (9%),
Uzbek/Tashkent (14%), Arab/Bukhara (14%), Uzbek/Fergana Valley (5%) and Uzbek/Samarkand 7%) [2]. Interestingly, Y-HG Q is the youngest paternal haplogroup
observed with less frequent subgroups which are geographically restricted. These have been delineated into
Q1, Q2 and Q3 subgroups defined by biallelic markers
M120, M25/M143 and M3, respectively[1]. Recently, a
novel subgroup Q4 was identified, defined by the biallelic marker M346, representing HG Q (0.41%, 3/728)
in Indian populations [4].
With very less details of HG Q in Asia, especially India, it
was pertinent to explore the status of the Y-HG Q in
Indian populations to gather an insight to determine the
extent of diversity within this region.

Results and Discussion
In the present study, we screened 630 samples belonging
to different regions of India and observed 2.38% (15/630)
individuals bearing Y-HG Q. It was interesting to observe
that 14/15 samples did not show any of the already
known Y-HG Q sub-haplogroups (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4),
defined by biallelic markers M120, M25/M143, M3 and
M346, respectively (Table 1). Only one individual was
observed with the presence of M120 polymorphism, representing Q1 lineage.
Further, a novel 4 bp del/ins polymorphism (rs41352448,
details provided in the Additional file 1) at 72,314 position of human arylsulfatase D pseudogene (ARSDP gene),
in 5/15 individuals (33.3% of the observed Y-HG Q in the
study) indicated the presence of a novel sub-group Q5 of
Y-HG Q. In order to establish the exclusiveness of this pol-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/232

ymorphism to Y-HG Q, we screened some of our samples
already categorized in other unrelated haplogroups like
R1a1, R2, L, H1, J, C, etc. The presence of an ancestral
allele (without insertion at 72,314 position of ARSDP
gene) in these samples confirmed the restriction of this
novel polymorphism within the Y-HG Q. We also
screened the sample with a derived state at M120 marker
in the present study (representing Q1), using ss4 bp
marker and found an absence of the polymorphism. In
order to assign an independent status to designated Q5
and to confirm the placement of M346 derived samples as
Q4 [4], it was necessary to study the novel ss4 bp marker
(Q5) in M346 derived samples (Table 1). Three samples
provided on request were screened for the ss4 bp polymorphism. The absence of this polymorphism in these
three samples not only confirmed the authenticity of Q4
lineage but also validated the independent status of Q5
observed by us (Figure 1). In addition to the Y-HG Q5 (5/
15) and Q1 (1/15) samples, there were 9/15 (60%) individuals who did not show any of the known Q subgroup
signature and were designated as Q*.
In order to put together our observations along with those
made in literature earlier, we pooled data of 1615 Y- chromosomes (630 present study and 985 from literature)
(Table 1) for analyses, of which 21/1615 (1.3%) samples
represented Q lineage in India. All of our 15 samples and
3 samples belonging to Y-HG Q4 [4] were genotyped for
12 Y-microsatellite markers. However, to keep uniformity
in evaluation, data of 10 overlapping Y-STR markers from
present study and from different population groups of
central Asia and India was used to construct median joining network [5], although 12 Y-STR markers were analysed by us (Additional file 2). For most of the Indian YHG Q and its sub-lineages, three clusters of Y-STR haplotypes were observed (Figure 2). One cluster included all
the three Q4 and one Q*, another with all the Q5 and the
third with most of the Q* bearing individuals. It was
interesting to find that most of the Indian Q (Q4, Q5 and
Q*) associated Y-STR haplotypes were separated from the
bulk of Central Asian Q* associated haplotypes. Further,
the clustering of the Y-STR haplotypes reassured the findings by the bi-allelic markers. This could either be due to
population differentiation or because of the presence of
these clusters in the ancestral migration from Central Asia,
not clear at the moment. The increased diversity within
the Indian population clusters could be interpreted as an
overall effect of geographical differentiation, population
expansions and severe bottlenecks resulting in loss of
many of the in-between haplotypes thus, reducing the
reticulation and increasing the branch lengths. It could
also be as a result of independent migrations and admixture.

tribes to their Dravidian counterparts, despite its low frequency. These observations could be explained either on
the basis of the ancestral relationship of different Indian
population groups, irrespective of linguistic and social
divisions or alternatively by some degree of recent gene
flow between these groups, not clear at the moment.

Conclusion
The age estimations made using a small sample size need
to be increased which is not feasible at the moment, keeping in mind a very low frequency of Y-HG Q in India. The
age estimation for haplogroup Q in India was carried out
on the bigger cluster bearing Q* and Q5 in the median
joining network. The calculated age of 47,101.5 (34,210.5
– 75,581.4) Years at 95% CI appears to be an over estimate than the age of haplogroup Q (15,000–18,000 Years
Before Present) in literature[2,3,6]. This probably has
occurred due to the enhanced diversity, probably as an
effect of population expansions and severe bottlenecks or
might be due to later migrations and admixture. A further
estimation of the age of Y-HG Q5 alone, using similar
parameters, provided an age estimate of 14,492.7
(10,526.3 – 23,255.8) Years at 95% CI.
The compilation of distribution pattern of Y-HG Q in
Indian population (Table 1) from the present study as
well as from literature, points out that this HG is distributed widely, ranging from Indo-European castes and

Interestingly, apart from assigned Y-HG Q5 (33.3%, 5/15)
samples and the only one individual representing Q1 lineage, there were Y-HG Q bearing (60%, 9/15) samples,
representing none of the known Q subgroups and designated as Q*. It was quite interesting to observe Y-HG Q in
Indian subcontinent though in low frequency but with
ancestral Q* state and a novel sub-branch Q5 not
reported elsewhere. A novel subgroup Q4 was identified
recently which is also restricted to Indian subcontinent
[4]. The most plausible explanation for these observations
could be an ancestral migration of individuals bearing
ancestral lineage Q* to Indian subcontinent with an autochthonous differentiation to Q4 and Q5 sublineages later
on. However, other explanations of either the presence of
both the sub haplogroups (Q4 and Q5) in ancestral
migrants or recent migrations from central Asia, cannot be
ruled out till the distribution and diversity of these subgroups is explored extensively in Central Asia and other
regions. To conclude, this study presents a novel polymorphism, adding another sublineage Q5 in the already existing arrangement of Y-HG Q in literature.

Methods
Samples
We screened 630 Y-chromosomes belonging to various
linguistic families, castes and tribes throughout the Indian
region (Table 1) to know the status of Y-HG Q and its sublineages and compared it with the data available in literature for different regions of the world [2-4,6,7] and also
for Indian population groups [2,4,8].

Markers and their analysis
The binary markers: M45, 92R7, P36, MEH2, M120, M3,
M25 [1], M242 [2] and M346 [4] were used to dissect out
known Y-HG Q upto its subgroups. Samples were amplified, checked in 2% agarose gel and then sequenced to
detect polymorphisms (using ABI 3100 sequencer, USA).
We used primer set [Forward: ttgtccagagaaacagccaat and
Reverse: atccatctacctacatacctgtcatc] to define the novel 4
bp (GGAT) deletion/insertion polymorphism 'ss4 bp'
[details submitted in the dbSNP (BUILD 127); NCBI
Assay ID: ss65713825; refSNP ID: rs41352448 and amplicon sequence provided as Additional file 1] at 72,314
position of human arylsulfatase D pseudogene (ARSDP
gene). The total PCR reaction mix made was 12.5 µl, containing 50 ng of template DNA, 6.25 pmoles of each
primer, 200 µM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1× reaction
buffer and 0.3 units of Taq pol enzyme (Bangalore Genei,
India). The cycling conditions were: denaturation at 94°C
for 1 min, followed by annealing at 56°C for 1 min, and
then extension at 72°C for 1 min, repeated for 30 cycles
followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. PCR
products were initially checked in 2% agarose gel,
sequenced (using ABI Prism 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, USA) and analyzed in SeqScape software v2.1.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA). These
samples were also genotyped for 12 Y-microsatellite
markers (Y-STRs): DYS388, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390,
DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS394, DYS426, DYS437,
DYS439, DYS448 described elsewhere[9,10] to estimate
haplotype variation within the HG defined by binary
markers (Additional file 2).
Statistical and Phylogenetic analysis
Although 12 Y-STR markers were analysed by us (Additional file 2), however, to keep uniformity in evaluation,
data of 10 overlapping Y-STR markers from present study
and from different population groups of central Asia and
India bearing Y-HG Q was used to construct median joining network[5]. Age estimation[11] was carried out using
averaged variance (calculated by MICROSAT software,
version 1.5d) of the Y-STRs and mutation rate[12] (µ) =
6.9 × 10-4 and 95% CI [9.5 × 10-4 - 4.3 × 10-4] per generation (g = 25 years).
