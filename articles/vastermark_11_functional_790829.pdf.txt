Functional specialization in nucleotide sugar
transporters occurred through differentiation of
the gene cluster EamA (DUF6) before the
radiation of Viridiplantae

Abstract
Background: The drug/metabolite transporter superfamily comprises a diversity of protein domain families with
multiple functions including transport of nucleotide sugars. Drug/metabolite transporter domains are contained in
both solute carrier families 30, 35 and 39 proteins as well as in acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme proteins. In this
paper, we present an evolutionary analysis of nucleotide sugar transporters in relation to the entire superfamily of
drug/metabolite transporters that considers crucial intra-protein duplication events that have shaped the
transporters. We use a method that combines the strengths of hidden Markov models and maximum likelihood to
find relationships between drug/metabolite transporter families, and branches within families.
Results: We present evidence that the triose-phosphate transporters, domain unknown function 914, uracildiphosphate glucose-N-acetylglucosamine, and nucleotide sugar transporter families have evolved from a domain
duplication event before the radiation of Viridiplantae in the EamA family (previously called domain unknown
function 6). We identify previously unknown branches in the solute carrier 30, 35 and 39 protein families that
emerged simultaneously as key physiological developments after the radiation of Viridiplantae, including the “35C/E”
branch of EamA, which formed in the lineage of T. adhaerens (Animalia). We identify a second cluster of DMTs, called
the domain unknown function 1632 cluster, which has non-cytosolic N- and C-termini, and thus appears to have
been formed from a different domain duplication event. We identify a previously uncharacterized motif, G-X(6)-G,
which is overrepresented in the fifth transmembrane helix of C-terminal domains. We present evidence that the
family called fatty acid elongases are homologous to transporters, not enzymes as had previously been thought.
Conclusions: The nucleotide sugar transporters families were formed through differentiation of the gene cluster
EamA (domain unknown function 6) before Viridiplantae, showing for the first time the significance of EamA.

Background
Transmembrane helix (TM) proteins form 27% of the
human proteome [1,2]. Solute carriers (SLCs) constitute
the second largest family of TM proteins [3]. There are
51 SLC classes, according to sequence similarity and
functional properties, containing at least 386 human

SLCs [3,4]. Three of the largest SLC families, SLC30,
SLC35 and SLC39, comprising at least 10, 23, and 14
human proteins, respectively, contain protein domains
that are members of the drug/metabolite transporter
("DMT”) clan CL0184 in Pfam 24.0 [5]. A recent study
presented evidence that the DMT-containing proteins
are relatively dissimilar from other SLCs, and were present before the divergence of Bilateria [6].
The DMT clan comprises transporter proteins that
have a remarkably wide substrate range, from proteins

that transport nucleotide-sugar conjugates in the Golgi
apparatus (SLC35), to metal ion transporters (SLC30,
SLC39) and bacterial proteins that transport toxins,
such as camphor, chloroquine, or ethidium bromide
[7-9]. Interestingly, the SLC35 proteins could constitute
one of the evolutionary bottlenecks of the emergence of
multicellularity that depends on proteoglycans, which
are built from nucleotide sugar-conjugates and exported
to the extracellular matrix. Thus, evolutionary steps in
cell surface molecule-dependent human biology may be
reflected in DMT domain evolution [10,11]. For example, the Notch receptor, involved in cell fate determination, as well as T-cell lineage development commitment,
intercellular communication and neuronal development,
requires fucosylation and GDP-fucose transport by
SLC35C1, SLC35C2 to function [12]. Gene expression
and copy number variation studies have identified
SLC35E2 as a tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastoma
[13], and SLC35E3 as an overexpressed gene in glioblastoma [14]. SLC35F1 and SLC35F3-4 are uncharacterized
but have been found to be expressed in brain, specifically in the cerebellum [15].
The superfamily of DMTs was defined and expanded
using iterative homology search, using 14 pre-existing
families, of which 6 are exclusively prokaryotic by Jack
DL, Yang NM, Saier MH, Jr. (2001) [16]. In the transporter classification database, there are 26 DMT families
[17], using nomenclature adapted from the enzyme
commission. Jack DL, Yang NM, Saier MH, Jr. (2001)
presented a theory from their observations of TM structures in microorganism and bacteria-based phylogenies,
that the DMTs have undergone duplications such that 4
TM proteins (i.e. proteins with 4 transmembrane-spanning regions) gained an extra helix, and then duplicated
to a 10 TM state, or possibly duplicated first and then
gained 1-2 extra helices [16,18]. Subsequently, Pfam, the
most widely used domain database, introduced its DMT
clan (CL0184), by applying a standard clan definition
scheme on the iterative homology data set of Jack DL,
Yang NM, Saier MH, Jr. (2001). In its present form,
CL0184 has 19 member families, including the large and
diverse EamA family, which is named after the O-acetylserine/cysteine export gene in E. coli and was previously
known as “DUF6” [19]. The Pfam DMT clan encompasses data from more species than Jack DL, Yang NM,
Saier MH, Jr. (2001), but does not explicitly recognize
that DMT-encoding genes have either single or double
copies of DMT domains. This means that Pfam has
been instrumental in defining the DMT superfamily
through an automated scheme that does not incorporate
the current evolutionary model of DMT proteins. The
consequence is that the inclusion criteria is based on
full-length sequence data, and may cluster sequences
incorrectly.

Alphabetical nomenclature of SLC classes was introduced by HUGO/HGNC [20-22]. The work was, analogously to Pfam, performed independently of the original
DMT phylogeny, and has been elaborated since 2004 in
databases such as SLC tables (http://www.bioparadigms.
org/slc/menu.asp). The SLC classification system has
been shaped on the level of complete proteins -not
domains- and is not specifically based on work that
incorporates the two domain conjecture. In this paper,
we delineate the evolution of these protein domain
families considering the two parallel classification systems, one used for bacteria (DMT), and one for animals/H. sapiens (SLC). Until now, no comprehensive
study has been published on DMT that is based on the
two domain conjecture and uses all the 19 DMT
families in Pfam, in animals, plants and bacteria. To
focus our study, we will primarily investigate the evolutionary origin of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) in
the context of the DMT evolution. The term nucleotide
sugar transporter is taken here to apply to all transporters of nucelotide sugars, not only the Pfam DMT family
explicitly called “NST”, but also other DMT families that
transport such substances. The main difference between
the DMT and SLC terms is that DMT is a type of
domain, referring to the original study of Jack DL, Yang
NM, Saier MH, Jr. (2001), and the machine annotated
Pfam superfamily, whereas SLC is a large family of fulllength proteins, which contains some subfamilies that
contain DMT domains.
There are at least four reports that strengthen the theory that single domain proteins gain a helix and duplicate to a ~10 TM configuration. Firstly, it has been
shown that if DMTs exist in a single domain form, their
lysine and arginine residues (but not other positive residues; personal communication Prof. von Heijne) are
carefully balanced in the membrane to enable ‘dual
topology’ insertion [23,24]. ‘Dual topology’ means that a
single domain DMT protein can insert into the membrane facing either direction, and implies that transport
activity would necessitate interaction between two oppositely oriented DMT single domain units. Secondly, if
DMT proteins exist in paired form in the same gene,
the halves have permanent and opposite orientations,
having their positive residues on the cytoplasmic side.
The insertion direction of the EmrE gene product (Multidrug resistance family) can be controlled in a model
system, to show that interaction between two oppositely
oriented single DMT domains is responsible for protein
activity [25]. Thirdly, in confirmation there are genomically paired but un-fused single domain genes in the
DUF606 family that are already locked in their lysine
and arginine bias. Nine independent duplication events
in DUF606 (5 paired, and 4 fused) can be demonstrated
with evidence of evolution from 4 TM units to paired

supplementary table S1] - and then searched the proteomes of each for matches to the ten human DMT
families [additional file 2: supplementary table S2]. This
was done using standard Pfam tools (see Methods).
Within the organisms selected, the representation of
families ranges from high (e.g. EamA/Zip/Cation efflux
families each have ~10 proteins per species) to low (e.g.,
UPF0546 ~1 protein per species). All sequences are
listed in [additional file 3: supplementary table S3].
For each DMT family, the members found in the 12
selected organisms were aligned at the protein level
using MAFFT-EINSI [28]. Manual editing was then performed to realign/remove poorly aligned sequences
using Maxalign (v1.1) [29], with the additional goals of
retaining all human protein sequences and retaining
regions with conserved transmembrane characteristics
(defined here as regions in which over 80% of the
sequences are predicted to be transmembrane according
to Phobius, a leading transmembrane topology predictor
[30]). The alignments can be found in the additional
material (additional file 4: dmt.aln.tgz).

or fused genes that give fixed and opposite membrane
orientation of the two DMT domains and resulting protein activity [26]. Finally, a consensus of the EmrE structure was established from a 4 + 4 TM asymmetric
structure, by cryoelectron microscopy and a revised Xray structure, which differ by only 1.4 Ångström in root
mean square deviation, confirming the asymmetric
paired structure [27].
The current study defines the first and second
domains in relation to the TM segments in the ten
DMT families containing human proteins, henceforth
referred to as the “human DMT families” in this paper.
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees are made
for the first domains, to find models of DMT subfamily evolution. The phylogenetic trees are resolved, and
the oldest model organism sequence in each branch is
used to estimate the age of the subfamily. To identify
the origin of human 5 + 5 TM architecture DMTs,
hidden Markov model (HMM) comparison was applied
on first and second domains. The use of both maximum likelihood bootstrap forests and hidden Markov
models is particularly applicable to DMTs, as they constitute a large and diverse Pfam clan. Here we give a
detailed definition and description of the human
DMT/SLC35 family and present an intriguing evolutionary history which supports an ancient internal
duplication in EamA.

Domain architecture of human DMT families

The conception of a “domain” as a stably folding protein
segment is not technically applicable to membraneinserted proteins, and we will in this paper use “domain”
to describe a part of a membrane inserted protein that
has an independent evolutionary history [31].
Seven of the human DMT families were cut into Nterminal and C-terminal domains by symmetry. Cutting
by symmetry means that we divide a 10 TM family as 5
+ 5 TM structure, or that it is a single domain family
that will not be subject to cutting. When we refer to
‘single domain’ DMT families, this can either mean that
the domain tends to exist in single copy inserted in a

To ascertain the distribution of DMT families [Table 1]
in a diverse set of kingdoms and phyla and to obtain a
representative set of protein sequences for further analysis, we selected a dozen model organisms - 9 animals, 1

longer sequence (e.g. TPT) or that the whole sequence
is only that domain (e.g. UPF0546).
The three remaining (’asymmetric’) human families
that could not have domains defined in this straightforward way are: DUF803, Cation efflux, and Zip. In the
case of Zip, there is considerable length of aligning
sequence after the last TM block that is part of Pfam’s
Zip domain.
Canonical example sequences of these anomalous
(’asymmetric’) families were analyzed with DLP-SVM
(an SVM that recognizes domain linker peptides) and
TMHMM [Figure 1], suggesting a 4 + 5, 4 + 2, and 3 +
5 TM architecture in relation to the DMT domain border, respectively. Finally, placement of the domain

boundary in the Zip and Cation efflux families was
determined by the concurrent location of Pfam low
complexity regions as well as a large gapped region in
the alignment, and in the case of DUF803 by use of a
generic HMM recognizing the DMT-1 and DMT-2
domains. Tables S4 [additional file 5: supplementary
table S4] and 2 list different evidence type used to locate
domain border and the final conclusion for each family.
Resolved dendrograms of DMTs identify stable
subfamilies in EamA, Cation efflux, and Zip

Using the knowledge of the domain architecture, we
then extracted just the first domain (here termed DMT1) from the overall alignments obtained previously. We
made 10 DMT dendrograms, such as the one shown in
Figure 2, using the DMT-1 domains with RAxML [32].
We resolved the trees [additional file 6: supplementary
figure S1; figure 2], i.e. ensured that they do not contain
any nodes with bootstrap support <50%, using tools to
edit the bootstrap forests (Methods; additional file 7:
human_dmt-1.dendr.tgz). The number of sequences in
the resolved tree is smaller than the original number of
sequences because of the editing process [additional file
8: supplementary table S5].
The organisms found in the branches can in theory be
treated as markers of the age of the branch system, but
due to the possibility of excessive sequence deletion or
polychotomous tree formation, these trees should be
viewed as hypothesis generating material, rather than
accurate date estimates.
Only three of the dendrograms are found to contain
stable independent branches that exist in at least 6
organisms: EamA, Zip (PF02535), Cation efflux
(PF01545). The EamA, Zip, and Cation efflux dendrograms each contain four distinct branches [additional
file 9: supplementary table S6]. In the other seven
families the low number of sequences in the analysis
limits the number of identifiable branches.
In Cation efflux and Zip, the SLC39A11 and the so
called ‘chicken-specific branch’ were formed in or before
T. adhaerens. This could be related to the ion transport
needs of the proto-synaptic system of T. adhaerens, and
the subsequent emergence of a primitive nervous system
in N. vectensis [additional file 1: supplementary table
S1].
Visualization of the similarity relationships between
nucleotide sugar transporter domains reveals the key role
of the EamA family

Before further detailed analysis of the individual family
dendrograms, we sought to identify which DMT family
was the most likely origin of the nucleotide sugar
transporters. The aim was to find which of the DMT
families having a nucleotide sugar transporter function

displayed most similarity to the other nucleotide sugar
transporters with respect to its DMT-1 and DMT-2
domains.
To obtain a quantitative measure of similarity, we
trained HMMs on each domain halve of the nucleotide
sugar transporter families (EamA, TPT, DUF914, UAA,
NST), and then found the similarity between every pairwise combination of domain HMMs using the
HHsearch program. The HHsearch probability [33]
values indicate the probability that the two HMMs are
significantly related. Two complementary methods were
then employed to visualize the relationships embedded
within that matrix.
Non-metric multidimensional scaling [34] was used
(see Methods) to construct a two-dimensional representation of the similarity data (Figure 3A) in which
the domains are positioned so that the distances
between them reflects as much as possible the original
dissimilarity values. The resulting configuration shows
a striking bipartitioning of the domains that recapitulates whether they are first or second domains.
Furthermore, the domains nearest the notional
“boundary” between the two clusters are EamA-1
(DUF6-1) and EamA-2 (DUF6-2). Our interpretation of
this is that it suggests that EamA was the original
family from which the other four nucleotide sugar
transporter families evolved.

The second method was to select the most highly
similar pairs of domains, connect them by “edges” in a
graph, and seek a visual representation of that graph.
We used 99.05% HHsearch similarity as a threshold to
define edges, because empirically 99.05% is the lowest
threshold we could set and still obtain a connected
graph between all ten nucleotide sugar transporter
domain halves. A 99%-cutoff translates to a p-value of
5.20E-18, in the HHsearch conversion.
The result (Figure 3B) was a planar graph (v-e + f =
2), where v is the number of vertices, e the number of
edges and f the number of faces. It can be seen from
Figure 3 that the EamA (and TPT) family nodes have
the highest degree: d(EamA-1) = 5, d(EamA-2) = 6, d
(TPT-1) = 3, and d(TPT-2) = 5. These results suggests
that the nucleotide sugar transporters may have differentiated from EamA.
In addition, if we plot the closest DMT-2 neighbors of the
DMT1s and vice versa, we note that this also results in a
graph (data not shown) with highest degree assigned to
EamA/TPT. The closest DMT-2 neighbor of NST-1 is
TPT-2 (98.1%), and the closest DMT-2 neighbor of
DUF914-1/UAA-1 is EamA-2 (98.7 and 97.7% HHsearch
prob.). The closest DMT-1 neighbor of NST-2/UAA-2/
DUF914-2 is EamA-1 (95.2, 98.5, and 98.5% HHsearch
prob.). Our interpretation of these results is that the nucleotide sugar transporters have differentiated from EamA.

domains. Figure 3A: Two-dimensional representation of the similarity relationships between the domains of the nucleotide sugar transporter
DMT families with human members, as obtained by non-metric multidimensional scaling. First domains are represented by red circles, second
domains by blue triangles. The MDS fit measures (s-stress = 0.08, RSQ = 0.97) indicate that the inter-domain distances in this configuration
reflect well the original inter-domain similarity values. Figure 3B: HHsearch all-against-all clustering is done, using a 99.05% probability cutoff,
because this was the highest cutoff we could use and still retain a connected graph. The results are organized as a pivot table in Open Office 3
and viewed as a graph in Cytoscape (v2.6.3). The graph is arranged manually to achieve maximum separation between first and second
domains, and to achieve no overlapping edges (planarity). The HHsearch values quoted between two DMT domains may fluctuate slightly
depending on which domain is used as query; if so, the number presented is the average result.

Comparing inter-domain and EamA distances of human 5+5
TM structure DMTs reveals likely ancestral position of EamA

We produced a “divergence process table” [Table 2], using
the values from HHsearch for the first and second
domains of DUF914, EamA, NST, TPT, UAA families.
The table shows the increasing distance from 0.6 to 96.6%,
measured in units of 100-HHsearch probability, between
the first and second domains, as well as the increasing distance to EamA from zero to 2.4%, measured in units of

100-HHsearch probability. Note that the ordering of the
interdomain distances exactly replicates the ordering of
the distance from EamA, and that the NST interdomain
halve similarity is surprisingly low (96.6% expressed as distance, despite close relationship with EamA).
Thus the data is consistent with a scenario in which
the nucleotide sugar transporters were formed from a
duplication event in EamA. Next we examine the
HMMs for the human 5+5 TM nucleotide sugar

to the resolved dendrogram for EamA to study its component sequences.
Using the consensus sequences of HMMs for human
EamA-derived 5+5 TM DMTs to study sequence evolution

Table 3 shows the matching TM segment-internal residues for pair-wise comparisons of HHsearch consensus
sequences of pairs of DMT domain halves that are presumed, from Results, to have evolved from each other. A
recurrent motif is identified in the 5th TM helix of the
second DMT domain, G-X(6)-G. It appears to have been
lost in NST, but exists in both the first and second
domains of EamA, and in the second domain of TPT,
DUF914, and UAA. The consensus sequence residues in
the HHsearch models have a conservation of ~33%
(depending on the amount of gaps - personal communication with Johannes Söding), but could be much higher.
Inspection of the EamA alignment (additional file 4: dmt.
aln.tgz) reveals that the conservation of these glycines are
81% and 68%, respectively, in the glycine-6-glycine motif,
making it the most conserved intra-helical motif in the
EamA alignment. A MEME motif search returned G-X
(6)-G as a constituent of a motif, having the regular
expression K[VI][VL]GT[LI][VLI][CS][VI][GA]GAL[VL]
[ML]T[LF]YKGP and the e-value 3.0e-338.
Oldest model organism sequence in subfamilies in the
edited EamA bootstrap forests reveals origin in Animalia
of AMAC and SLC35C/E subfamilies

Both versions of the EamA tree contain the AMAC and
SLC35C/E clusters, suggesting that the removal of
sequences does not affect the main subfamilies of
EamA. We selected EamA for exact dating of independent branches because it is established in Results that it
is one of three human DMT families that display distinct branches, and in Results that EamA is the origin of

human 5 + 5 TM structure DMTs. The following EamA
subfamilies were found: AMACs, SLC35Fs, SLC35C/Es
and PUPs. The subfamilies are named from their human
sequence constituents.
The oldest model organism represented in the AMAC
and SLC35C/E branches are respectively: D. discoideum
(sequence [Dictybase:DDB0184471]) and T. adhaerens
(sequence [JGI:e_gw1.7.147.1]). Because excessive editing
of the bootstrap forests could result in erroneous deletion of ancient organism sequences, the steps 2.8-2.10
are undertaken to confirm these results. The oldest
model organism sequence of the SLC35Fs is an A. thaliana sequence [TAIR:AT4G32140.1-P], thus making it
impossible to date the SLC35F subfamily using this
model organism selection.
We used third party annotation (TPA) in DNA databank
of Japan, DDBJ, to supplement annotation to the oldest
model organism sequence in the independent branches of
the resolved bootstrap forest of EamA: D. discoideum
TMEM20 (sequence [Dictybase:DDB0184471]) was superannotated as [DDBJ:BR000891], and T. adhaerens
SLC35E1 (sequence [JGI:e_gw1.7.147.1]) was super-annotated as [DDBJ:BR000889].
TBLASTN analysis confirms age of subfamilies in the
resolved EamA dendrogram

We extend the analysis to a new set of 12 species (9 new
species, T. adhaerens, D. discoideum, and A. thaliana; see
Figure 4), because a dozen species obviously represents a
rather limited sampling of species, making our ability to
resolve the time of emergence of any subfamily limited. We
compared TimeTree divergence time data (measured from
H. sapiens) for the new set of 12 species to the TimeTree
divergence time data from the old set of 12 species (reporting the difference between the corresponding ordinal measurements in the right hand margin of Figure 4) [35].

Pairwise comparisons are made for HMM consensus sequences of DMT families that are presumed, from Results, to have evolved from each other (pairs are
listed in 1st column). The aligning residues in the consensus sequences are obtained from HHsearch. Aligning HHsearch consensus residues (representing ~33%
sequence conservation) are counted if they are located in TM segments. In the first TM segment of the second domain, a motif G-X(11)-A is found, and in the 5th
TM segment of the second domain, G-X(6)-G is discovered. Some of the TPT-1 sequences are EamA sequences, because TPT is not found in the DMT-1 slot; we
assume that DUF914-1 evolved from EamA-1 directly.

Figure 4 TBLASTN 2.2.24+ confirmatory search of oldest model
organism sequence identified in subfamilies in edited EamA
dendrogram. Using TBLASTN 2.2.24+, the human sequences of
TMEM20 and SLC35E1, representing the “AMAC” and “SLC35C/E”
subfamilies, are used as query against a set of 12 new model
organisms (left column). Any shift in divergence time (from H.
sapiens), compared to the corresponding organism in the (ordinal)
set of model organisms (Methods), is indicated in the right hand
column, with data from TimeTree [35].

oldest model organism sequences against the “nr” database
(limiting the search to one model organism at a time)
show that D. discoideum TMEM20 and T. adhaerens
SLC35E1 sequences are indeed the oldest constituents in
their respective subfamilies [Figure 4], because there is a
sharp drop (to ~1/3 of its score) in sequence quality of
hits in model organisms with a higher divergence time to
H. sapiens than the oldest model organism sequences.
SLC35C1, TMEM22 are absent in Viridiplantae

We took the other human constituents of the branches,
i.e. SLC35C1, TMEM22 and queried them against “nr”
plants (taxid:3193); the quality of the hits is 45-57 (Evalues: 4E-04 and 5E-09), with a coverage of 40-67% for
the respective best hit, for H. sapiens SLC35C1 [Genbank:AAH01427] and H. sapiens TMEM22 [GenBank:
AAH22557]. AMAC is not represented in plants at all.
These hits are not of comparable quality to those
obtained between the human sequence and the oldest
model organism sequences identified above, where we
had scores above 100 and cover the full-length
sequences. Thus, it appears that our oldest model
organism sequence from the branches found in EamA
in the hypothesis generating section of the study agrees
with the result from BLAST-based method.
Molecular clock analysis of eukaryotic EamA branches
estimates SLC35E1 and TMEM20 emergence to 779 and
1567 Mya

We determined molecular clock distances between the
oldest model organism sequence in the AMAC and
SLC35C/E subfamilies of EamA and the respective

Page 8 of 18

orthologue sequences in human. The simpler (clocklike) tree is rejected on a significance level of 5%. The
following distances were obtained: TMEM20 (1.79
units from oldest model organism sequence to human
orthologue in the AMAC subfamily; this measurement
refers to a pairwise sequence comparison), SLC35E1
(0.89 units), and SLC35F5 (1.86 units - as a reference
measurement). These distances theoretically correspond to the divergence time estimate of H. sapiens-D.
discoideum (1628 Million years ago; Mya), H. sapiensA. thaliana (1628 Mya - using the Fungi/Metazoa
group/Viridiplantae divergence time estimate), and H.
sapiens-T. adhaerens (1009 Mya), using TimeTree
divergence time estimates. Thus, using the SLC35F5
distance as a reference, the Mya estimates for the
other sequence pairs are: TMEM20 (~1567 Mya) and
SLC35E1 (~779 Mya). The divergence time of these
sequences is congruent with an emergence of the
AMAC and SLC35C/E subfamilies in Animalia, rather
than in Viridiplantae.
Distribution in plants and bacteria provides strong
evidence for EamA’s ancestral position in nucleotide
sugar transporter evolution

To gain a wider perspective on the evolution of the
entire DMT clan, we also investigated the representation
of all of the 19 DMT families listed in Pfam (i.e. the 10
families that have human members, and the other 9
families that do not). Using a separate extraction of 10
+9 DMT families [additional file 2: supplementary table
S2; additional file 10: supplementary table S7] in plants
and bacteria, we compare the distribution of the number
of sequences found [Table 4 and additional file 11: supplementary table S8].
The distribution of sequences between DMT families in
plants and bacteria differs dramatically (compare Table
4 and additional file 11: supplementary table S8). In
plants, the human DMT families we have discussed earlier are present in large numbers, using the sequence
retrieval procedure presented in the methods section:
TPT (512 sequences in plants), DUF914 (58 sequences),
UAA (368 sequences), NST (75 sequences), DUF803 (90
sequences). In bacteria we obtain the following counts
for the same families: TPT (3 sequences), DUF914 (1
sequence), UAA (0 sequences), NST (1 sequence),
DUF803 (35 sequences). The DMT families not represented in human, presented in Table S7 [additional file
10: supplementary table S7], display the opposite distribution pattern, having large numbers in the bacteria and
small numbers in plants. For details about the sequences
used to analyze DMT families not represented in
human, see Table S9 [additional file 12: supplementary
table S9] and the additional alignments (additional file
4: dmt.aln.tgz).

Table lists number of full-length sequences found in Pfam full sequence data, using the organisms in [additional file 16: supplementary table S12]: Zma = Zea
mays; Osa = Oryza sativa (subsp. japonica/indica); Vvi = Vitis vinifera; Ptr = Populus trichocarpa; Psi = Picea sitchensis; Ppa = Physcomitrella patens; Olu =
Ostreococcus lucimarinus; Ota = Ostreococcus tauri. The DMT families are represented by letters: EamA (A); TPT (B); DUF914 (C); UAA (D); NST (E); DUF1632 (F);
DUF803 (G); UPF0546 (H); Zip (I); Cation (J); CRCB (K); CRT-like (L); DUF486 (M); DUF606 (N); FAE (O); MDR (P); RhaT (Q); SugT (R); UPF0060 (S).

The number of EamA sequences differs between the
different plant species: poplar, maize, rice, and grape
have more than 100 EamA proteins per species. Moss,
algae and spruce have 20-50 copies per species. Peas,
beans, and grass have less than 10 EamA proteins per
species. Purple false brome, which is a monocot, has zero
copies of EamA, using the sequence retrieval in Methods.
The observation that EamA is the only 5+5 TM nucleotide sugar transporter that is present in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes provides convincing evidence (stronger
than the HMM evidence) that EamA is the origin of the
nucleotide sugar transporters found in H. sapiens.
MDR (Multi drug resistance) is identified as the likeliest
single domain progenitor to EamA

In the EamA MAFFT-EINSI alignment (see Methods and
additional file 4: dmt.aln.tgz), 97.5% of the sequences
have EamA in the first domain position. In addition,
44.2% of the sequences have EamA in the second domain
position. The most prevalent non-EamA domain in the
second position in the EamA alignment is TPT (found in
26.3% of sequences in the second position). This shows
that EamA can exist in single copy form.
It also illustrates the high tendency for TPT to exist in
heterogeneous constellation with other DMT domains.
In the TPT alignment, all 138 sequences except one
have TPT in the second DMT position. Of the
sequences containing a TPT copy (the criteria for inclusion in TPT alignment), 43 are paired with an EamA
domain in the first slot, and 3 sequences are paired with
one each of UAA, NST or CRT-like. One sequence has
a long C-terminal tail containing multiple non-DMT
domains, and 91 sequences have no Pfam domain definition for the first “DMT slot”, even though that area
contains the same DMT-like TM helices as other annotated sequences.
Two HMMs were trained: one called ‘EamA-1’ trained
on the first domain position in the EamA alignment

(containing 97.5% EamA), and the second HMM on the
first domain position in cases where the second position
is not filled by EamA. The specialized single copy EamA
HMM (called ‘1 × EamA’) was taken to represent a
more ancestral “unpaired” form of EamA.
Subsequently, ‘EamA-1’ and ‘1 × EamA’ were queried
against all single domain families having 4 or 5 TMs.
Both of these EamA HMMs scored highest against
MDR (97.5 and 96.4% HHsearch probability for ‘EamA1’ and ‘1 × EamA’, respectively). This result may indicate
a close evolutionary relationship between EamA and the
single domain family MDR [Table 5]. MDR has a G-X
(6)-G motif in its fourth trans-membrane region, with
prevalence in the G positions of 47-88%, indicating that
the 4th TM in MDR may correspond to the 5th TM in
EamA.
Further identification of recurrence of G-X(6)-G motif in
paired DMT domains, excluding EamA-derived cases and
Cation efflux (PF01545), confirms the importance of the
motif

To buttress previously presented results concerning G-X
(6)-G (Results), we identified G-X(6)-G in the remaining
two domain DMTs. A measurement of >65% glycine
frequency in TM-internal positions are recorded (Methods) [additional file 13: supplementary table S10]. Three
observations of G-X(6)-G are found in the 5th TM helix

of either DMT-1 or DMT-2 of DUF1632, DUF803, Zip,
CRT-like, SugT, RhaT, and FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA
synthase 1 family. Six additional observations of G-X(6)G are found in the remaining TM segments of DMT-1
of DUF1632, DUF803, Zip, CRT-like, SugT, RhaT, and
FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1 family.
The total frequency of G-X(6)-G (3 + 6 copies) in TM
segments is almost twice as high as expected (~5 copies)
from a simulation of random sequence, assuming a TM
length of ~20 residues and a glycine frequency of 7%
matching that found in our consensus sequences (Methods). Furthermore, if we consider only the 5th TM segment, where we expect to see ~0.5 G-X(6)-G, we have a
6-fold increase (we have 3 copies). Cation efflux
(PF01545) does not contain any intra-helical glycine
residues that are represented at a conservation level
>65%, implying that this family differs in this structurally important aspect.
Creation of “breadth-first” clustering of first domains of
19 DMTs reveals three major groups: the EamA, DUF1632
and metal transporter clusters

Three clusters are discovered in a “breadth-first” clustering made using HHsearch probability to closest neighbor for the DMT-1 domain. These clusters are named
EamA, DUF1632, and metal transporters [Figure 5],
from their human or most notable member family. The
clustering principle is to join any nearest neighbor, making the clustering independent of any cutoff.
Three clusters are defined: EamA (purple; based on
nearest neighbor principle), DUF1632 (green; based on
membrane orientation), and metal transporters (turquoise; based on TM and substrate profile).
The connections between DUF606/DUF1632 and
FAE/SugT/RhaT are in the 70-80% HHsearch probability range, and DUF1632-1 displays 93.45% HHsearch
probability to be related with TPT-2. DUF1632-2 displays 96.6% HHsearch probability to be related with
EamA-1. The metal transporters display good similarity
between DMT-1 and DMT-2 within the same faimily
(93.8% for Cation and 75-97% for Zip). The similarity
between Cation/Zip and other DMT families falls below
1% HHsearch probability (see additional file 14 ‘ALL
HHS.ods’ in HMM tar archive). CRCB is only very
weakly similar to DUF606 (2.2% HHsearch probability).
All symmetrical two domain DMTs in the EamA cluster have cytosolic N- and C-termini, whereas all symmetrical two domain DMTs in the DUF6132 cluster have
Golgi/endocytoplasmic reticulum/extracellular spaceoriented (i.e. non-cytosolic) N- and C-termini, thus providing structural evidence corroborating the quality of
the clustering. The membrane insertion is determined
using Phobius prediction, but also agrees with the positive (K, R) inside rule. For example, in the DUF1632

Page 10 of 18

alignment, 7 out of 9 K, R positions are placed between
inbound and outbound (cytosolic segment) Phobius-predicted TM helices. Large TM variation could be
observed in DUF606 [26].
The membrane orientation illustrated using
TMRPres2D [36] in Figure 5 shows, using example
structures listed in the corresponding figure legend, the
membrane orientation >50%. The lowest score for a
two-domain case is Zip (58% non-cytosolic insertion),
suggesting that this family differs substantially in this
respect, and is unusually prone to variability in membrane insertion for a double domain DMT.
Examination of FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1 (PF07168)
shows that it is unlikely to be correctly annotated as
homologous to enzymes

FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1 is a member of the
newly found DUF1632 cluster (Methods). The annotation on the PF07168 is: “This family contains fatty acid
elongase 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1, a plant enzyme
approximately 350 residues long.” In the five seed
sequences of PF07168, however, all sequences are found
to have the 5+5 TM structure typical of DMT solute
carriers, raising doubts if the enzyme annotation in
Pfam is correct. A search of “PF07168” in UniProt
returns six sequences that have status “reviewed”, which
are annotated as “ureide permease 1-5”, and “ureide permease A3”, thus raising further doubts if the enzyme
annotation in Pfam is correct.
To compare the alleged FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase
1 sequences with expert annotated FAEs, the B. napus
ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) sequence [GenBank:
AF009563] and L. annua KCS sequence [GenBank:
EU871787] were obtained [37]. These proteins are only
attached to the membrane by 2 TMs in the N-terminal
fifth of the sequence, thus presenting a completely different TM architecture.
A protein sequence search on the NCBI website, limiting the search field to “title” and “fatty acid elongase 3ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1”, returned 11 hits. The TM
structure of these sequences in six cases was the KCSlike structure with N-terminal transmembrane attachment through 2 TMs. In the remaining cases, transmembrane helices could not be reliably predicted, and
in one case [GenBank:AAM64564.1], there was a conflicting “ureide permease” annotation. In the next release
of Pfam (25.0), the above results will form the basis of
re-annotation of PF07168 from fatty acid elongase 3ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1, to ureide permease (communication with Pfam).
A possible background to the anomalous annotation
may be the fact that e.g. SLC35F5 in M. musculus and B.
taurus have an extended gap between the first 2 TM segments and the remaining 8 TM segments, meaning that

Figure 5 Breadth-first clustering of first domain of 19 DMTs using HHsearch HMMs. This figure was prepared using HHsearch all-against-all
comparison of first domain of DMTs, to establish closest neighbor of each DMT. The arrows indicate in relation to which family the neighbor is
closest, and the HHsearch score is printed in red next to the arrow (giving the uni-directional HHsearch score when the query family is used). Bidirectional arrows indicate cases where there is a reciprocal nearest neighbor relationship; in such cases the HHsearch score represents the average
of the two measurements. The gingerbread man icons indicate which families are present in H. sapiens. No arrows are drawn from Cation and Zip,
because their nearest neighbors (DUF1632 and DUF486) are very distant: only 3.2 and 5.4% HHsearch probability. Using the Phobius (v1.04)
prediction [30], the prevalent membrane orientation is indicated in the figure as the cytosol being in the upper direction of the figure, and the
lower direction representing Golgi/endoplasmatic reticuluum/extracellular space. Three clusters are defined: EamA (purple; based on nearest
neighbor principle), DUF1632 (green; based on membrane orientation), and metal transporters (turquoise; based on TM and substrate profile). The
schematic figure of example structures were drawn using TMRPres2D [36] and InkScape vector graphics editor (v0.47): SLC35B3 (UAA); C1ORF91
(UPF0546); [WormBase:ZC250.3] (NST); SLC35C2 (TPT); SLC35C1 (EamA); SLC35F1 (DUF914); NIPAL1 (DUF803); BOTT52 (DUF486); [UniProt:Q13PK0]

with incomplete sequence data, the overall N-terminal TM
structure of SLC35F5 resembles the overall N-terminal
TM structure of many plant fatty acid elongases.

Discussion
In this paper we present a comprehensive hierarchical
order for the different clusters of human DMT containing proteins that is based on the suggestion that DMTs
consist of either one or two DMT domains. It has been
our ambition to identify the independent branches of
DMT families and trace how they have evolved in key
model organisms, and to compare the relationship

between DMT families to understand how they have
been formed by domain duplications, presumably meiotic unequal crossing over. To this end, a bioinformatics
strategy that combines the strengths of hidden Markov
models and resolved maximum likelihood dendrograms
was found to be the most successful approach to gain
these results.
EamA is the likeliest progenitor of human 5+5 TM
structure nucleotide sugar transporters

Here we propose that the DMT families were formed
from EamA, most likely through a domain duplication

event before the radiation of Viridiplantae. The evidence supporting this statement is that the sequence
dissimilarity between domain 1 and 2 in the 5+5 TM
structure nucleotide sugar transporters successively
increases from 0.6 to 96.6% HHsearch probability (given
as 100-p) between the two domain in each of: EamA,
TPT, DUF914, UAA, and NST [Table 2]. Furthermore,
the average sequence dissimilarity between each human
5+5 TM structure DMT family and EamA increase from
0.7 to 2.4% HHsearch probability, in the exact same
order: TPT or DUF914, UAA, and NST.
The EamA-derived 5+5 TM structure families that are
represented in H. sapiens, change their sequence number distribution pattern in Pfam greatly between bacteria
and plants [Table 4 and additional file 11: supplementary table S8]. In bacteria, the EamA-derived families are
present in very small numbers: TPT (3 sequences),
DUF914 (1 sequence), UAA (0 sequences), NST (1
sequence). This can be compared to EamA, which has
13,428 sequences in the bacterial phylum listed in [additional file 11: supplementary table S8], providing further
-and probably stronger- evidence that EamA was the
bacterial ancestor of TPT, DUF914, UAA, and NST.
It can be noted in UniProt that there is some limited
evidence pointing to a trend of increased specialization
in known substrate repertoire for human, EamA-derived
nucleotide sugar transporters, corresponding to the suggested evolutionary distance from EamA (Figures 3A
and 3B). For instance, SLC35A1-A3 (NSTs) have one
documented substrate each, whereas SLC35B2-3 (UAA)
both share the same substrate, and SLC35D1 and D2
(TPT) have multiple substrates per transporter [additional file 15: supplementary table S11].
Thus, the EamA-derived families encompass all
human SLC35 sequences: SLC35A1-5 (NST), SLC35B14 (UAA), SLC35F1-2 (DUF914), SLC35C1-2 (EamA,
TPT), SLC35D1-3 (TPT), SLC35E1-4 (EamA, TPT),
SLC35F3-5 (EamA).
The DMT-1 dendrograms of EamA indicate that two
independent branches containing cancer-related genes
formed in Animalia

We found that “AMAC” and SLC35C/E form two independent subfamilies, exhibiting bootstrap support >50%
within the EamA tree [Figure 2]. Moreover, the oldest
model organism sequences within each subfamily indicate that the AMAC subfamily (but not AMAC itself)
was formed in the lineage of D. discoideum [DDBJ:
BR000891], and that the SLC35C/E subfamily was
formed in the lineage of T. adhaerens [DDBJ:BR000889].
The human orthologues of these sequences are
TMEM20 and SLC35E1 respectively.
By using H. sapiens TMEM20 and SLC35E1 as
TBLASTN 2.2.24+ queries against a set of eukaryotic

Page 12 of 18

model organisms, it was confirmed that there is a sharp
drop in sequence similarity after the presumed divergence time of the oldest model organism sequences
[Figure 4], well after the radiation of Viridiplantae.
As further evidence supporting that “AMAC” and
SLC35C/E were formed in Animalia, a TreePuzzle
Molecular Clock experiment shows that the estimated
divergence time between TMEM20 in H. sapiens and D.
discoideum is 1567 Mya. The Mya estimate between
SLC35E1 in H. sapiens and T. adhaerens is 779 Mya.
These results use the TreePuzzle divergence time estimate between H. sapiens and A. thaliana SLC35F5 as
reference measurement, assuming that they diverged
1628 Mya.
These results indicate that the SLC35C/E lineage,
which contains SLC35C1-2 transporters necessary for
fucosylation of the Notch receptor [12], and the
SLC35E1-4 transporters known to function as oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes in e.g. neuroblastoma
[13] and glioblastoma [14], was probably formed in Animalia. TMEM22, from the “AMAC” subfamily, is also
involved in cancer [38].
The AMAC (acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme) subfamily was formed in multicellular organisms, with a
smaller divergence time from human than Viridiplantae.
It is suspected “AMAC” is an incorrect enzyme annotation on a 5+5 TM structure DMT transporter [1],
because of its high similarity to solute carriers, especially
EamA domain containing proteins such as TMEM20. It
should be noted however, that AMAC has a G-X(5)-G
motif (not G-X(6)-G) in its final TM segment in DMT2, showing that if it is a DMT, it differs in this structural
respect. AMAC is an interchangeable, but more general
biochemical term than FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1,
which would refer only to synthase #1. HGNC has
informed that, based on this study, the AMAC1 and
AMAC-like (AMAC1L1, AMAC1L2, AMAC1L3)
sequences, will be re-named to SLC35Fs in RefSeq for
Human and Mouse in the future.
A recurrent glycine motif, G-X(6)-G, is over-represented in
the 5th TM helix of the DMT-2 domain, and constitutes
the most widely conserved motif between all DMT
families

Glycine, which is a helix breaker in globular proteins, is
found in TM helices [39]. The G-X(6)-G motif is found
in both EamA domains, the TPT-2 domain, the
DUF914-2 domain, and in UAA-2 in the HHsearch consensus sequences [Table 3]. For two domain DMTs that
are not EamA-derived, nine TM-internal G-X(6)-G are
found that have a >=65% frequency, of which three are
found in the 5th TM helix of DMT-2 [Table 3]. This
motif may have the role of introducing flexibility, or
permit ion passage in the helix, considering that a shift

Västermark et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/123

of seven residues would be the optimal distance to orient two residues one helix turn apart. It is stated on the
DMT Pfam entry (CL0184) that many sequences contain a characteristic glycine-rich motif in the C-terminal
sequence, but we have reported a more detailed characterization of this feature. Apart from the G-X(6)-G feature, and the two domain structure, it can be noted that
DMTs (except metal transporters) tend to have short
loops (~10 amino acids) between the TM segments,
making the occurrence of any secondary structure in
such linker peptides unlikely.
DMT families form three main clusters (EamA, DUF1632,
and metal transporters), of which the metal transporters
(SLC30s and SLC39s) are the most divergent

Three main clusters are defined by “breadth first” clustering of the first domain of 19 DMT families, connecting nearest neighbors [Figure 5]. The DUF1632 and
EamA clusters are reinforced by conserved membrane
insertion orientation in 6 out of 11 of the families in the
EamA cluster, and 4 out of 6 of the families in the
DUF1632 cluster. Furthermore, the EamA cluster is
reinforced by the fact that all nucleotide sugar transporters (TPT, DUF914, UAA, NST) are contained within
the cluster. The strongest relations between the
DUF1632 and EamA clusters (93.5 and 96.6% HHsearch
probability between each halve of DUF1632 and TPT-2
or EamA-1) is >100-fold stronger than the intercluster
edge between the metal transporter cluster and any
member of the EamA cluster. The lower limit for
sequence composition as measured by HHsearch
“edges” between the families in the EamA cluster is
>55% HHsearch probability (UPF0060 to MDR), compared to >1% in the metal transporter cluster. The
paired, but asymmetric transmembrane structure of the
metal transporters, and metal ion substrates, highlights
the fact that the metal transporters differ substantially
in these respects from the other DMTs. The high similarity between DMT-1 and DMT-2 in the metal transporters highlights that they appear to have been formed
by domain duplication.
FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1 (PF07168) domaincontaining proteins are homologous to transporters, not
enzymes

The annotation of PF07168 as fatty acid elongase 3ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1 appears incorrect because the
proteins containing this DMT domain have the same 10
TM configuration and sequence similarity with other
solute carriers in the DMT superfamily, and not the 2
TM configuration of well documented fatty acid elongases. The UniProt reviewed annotation for FAE containing proteins is “ureide permease”. In the next release
of Pfam (25.0), this result will form the basis of re-

Page 13 of 18

annotation of PF07168 from fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1, to ureide permease (communication
with Pfam).

Conclusions
We have established that the SLC35 nucleotide sugar
transporters were formed from a duplication event in
EamA, probably before the radiation of Viridiplantae. A
cluster of DMTs, called DUF1632, have non-cytosolic
N- and C-termini and appear to come from a different
duplication event than the nucleotide sugar transporters.
We have discovered two independent branches within
EamA that formed after the radiation of Viridiplantae.
These independent branches are called “AMAC” and
“SLC35C/E”, from their human constituents. The
AMACs (and fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-CoA
synthase 1) are probably not enzymes, but solute carriers similar to nucleotide sugar transporters. A new
motif has been characterized, G-X(6)-G, strongly overrepresented in the 5th TM helix of DMT-2.
Methods
Identification of DMT proteins in 12 model organisms

Complete protein sequence data for 12 model organisms
was obtained on August 1, 2009 from the following
databases: Ensembl, JGI, Dictybase, TAIR. A Pfam
script, ‘pfam_scan.pl’ (v1.21), was then used to search
the protein sequences with the Pfam-A (v23) hidden
Markov models [40] for each of the ten DMT families
represented in human, using Pfam’s default parameters,
assuring that hits did not overlap.
Alignment construction and editing

The sequences were aligned, family-by-family, using
MAFFT-EINSI (v6.624b) [28], producing 10 alignments.
The settings used were: defaults, 10 rebuilds. Transmembrane predictions with Phobius (v1.04) [30], a leading transmembrane topology predictor, using default
settings, were made for all sequences. The alignments
and transmembrane predictions were viewed in Jalview
(v2.5.1) [41]. The alignments were edited to remove
poorly aligned sequences, using the Maxalign (v1.1) [29]
exclude selection, with the additional goal to retain all
human sequences and achieve aligning TM segments in
>80% of the sequences for each conserved TM block.
All editing was done by sequence removal, i.e. not by
allowing insertion of gaps. The edited alignments can be
found in the additional material (additional file 4: dmt.
aln.tgz), and the new number of sequences after this
step is indicated in parentheses in Table 1.
New domain border

Assuming, from previous theory [16], that DMT containing proteins consist of either one or two units of 4-5

Västermark et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/123

TM segments, two domain-containing alignments were
divided in two halves, using the following methods.
Seven out of ten of the human DMTs can be divided by
symmetry, except: DUF803, Cation efflux, and Zip
families. DLP-SVM [42] was applied on canonical
sequences from the asymmetric families, with offset 30,
threshold 0.5, and rank 1 [see Figure 1].
To successfully divide the DUF803 alignment, two
“generic” HMMs (one for DMT-1 and one for DMT-2),
were first trained on the first and second domains in
the seven symmetric human DMT families using
HMMER 3. We used hmmbuild, hmmpress, hmmscan
–tblout against the sequences. Each of these generic
HMMs were then applied to the sequences in the
DUF803 alignment using the criteria for classification as
having more than 50% of the sequences in the proposed
domain exceeding a 1e-10 E-value cutoff. In the Cation
efflux and Zip families, a domain border was determined
using identification of ~100 residue length alignment
gaps concurring with low complexity regions in the
dominant Pfam architecture [Table 6].
Resolved phylogenetic trees of DMT-1s

RAxML-III [32] was used via the ‘easyRax.pl’ script with
the ‘fast & easy’ settings as described in the manual:
bootstrap (BS) maximum likelihood protocol, WAG
model, estimate proportion of invariable sites, empirical
base frequencies, generating 100 bootstraps. The BS forests were edited with aid of two tools, Summary Tree
Explorer (v1; STE), an open-source Java application for
interactively exploring sets of phylogenetic dendrograms
developed by Mark Derthick, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, and “P4” (v0.88.r142), a Python package
for phylogenetics developed by Peter G. Foster, The
Natural History Museum, London.
The goal was to produce 10 phylogenetic trees that do
not contain any nodes that have bootstrap support falling
under 50%, by removing sequences that do not stably

integrate in any branch system (subfamily). Ten dendrograms having bootstrap >50% were made by iteratively
removing a group of <10 unstably clustering sequences,
re-aligning the sequences and re-generating the bootstrap
forest, and making a new assessment of the phylogenetic
tree. This process was repeated until the dendrograms
were resolved. STE can be used to see the probable effect
of a certain sequence removal operation in advance, to
save the time and effort of realigning and re-generating
the bootstrap forest. The experimental work in STE is
based on Leaf Support Values from P4, showing which
sequences are most likely to be unstably clustered.
HHsearch was used to train HMMs to generate
hypothesis of origin of human 5+5 TM structure DMTs

Assuming that the human nucleotide sugar transport
families (based on UniProt annotation) that have a 5+5
TM structure are likely to have a common origin, we
used HHsearch [33] to train hidden Markov models
(HMMs) on the first and second domains of human 5+5
TM structure nucleotide sugar transport DMTs:
DUF914, EamA, NST, TPT, UAA. The alignments were
converted to ‘a3m’ format (using reformat.pl with the
-M 50 flag) and also subjected to buildali.pl (using 0
PSI-BLAST iterations), to enable calculation of probability of homology. We used a common calibration database containing SCOP folds which was provided with
HHsearch, to be able to calculate E-values and generate
comparable models. We compared HMMs against
HMMs, not against sequence. We used a 99.05%
HHsearch probability cutoff to count so called “edges”,
because 99.05% was the highest cutoff that retained a
connected graph. We then applied Euler’s planar graph
theorem to test if the graph was planar. We loaded the
planar graph in Cytoscape 2.6.3 [43], and organized the
graph such that it had no overlapping edges [Figure 3].
From this, we postulated a hypothesis as to which of the
five families (DUF914, EamA, NST, TPT, UAA) was

most likely to be the origin of the other four families,
based on which family had the highest degree, d.
Multidimensional scaling of NSTs

Non-metric multidimensional scaling was performed
using the ALSCAL algorithm [44], as implemented in
SPSS v.14, with the s-stress convergence parameter set
at 0.0001. Similarity values were transformed into dissimilarities through the rule (100 - similarity %) prior to
ALSCAL analysis.
Using the consensus sequence of HMMs for human 5+5
TM DMTs to study sequence evolution

We used the HHsearch (HMM) consensus sequences
from each pair-wise comparison of nucleotide sugar
transporters, comparing domain halves presumed (from
Results) to have evolved from each other, to study how
this was reflected on the sequence level. We recorded
matching conserved residues in the aligned consensus
sequences, as can be found in the ‘.hhr’ files generated
by HHsearch. Furthermore, MEME (http://meme.sdsc.
edu/meme4_6_0/cgi-bin/meme.cgi) was used, with
default settings on the EamA alignment, to identify the
three most common motifs in EamA.
Third party annotation in DDBJ

Two branches that lack proteins from A. thaliana, and
hence appear to have formed in Animalia, have been
found in our resolved EamA dendrogram: AMAC and
SLC35C/E (see Figure 2). The oldest model organism
sequences, [Dictybase:DDB0184471] and [JGI:
e_gw1.7.147.1], were used as queries in TBLASTN
2.2.24+ searches of the “nr” database. The results
showed that [Dictybase:DDB0184471] is a TMEM20-like
sequence and [JGI:e_gw1.7.147.1] an SLC35E1-like
sequence, confirming their identity as seen in the
resolved EamA phylogenetic tree. These sequences were
annotated in DDBJ, using third party annotation (TPA),
according to §15 of INSDC TPA policy.
Confirming the approximate age of independent
branches in the resolved EamA dendrogram using
TBLASTN 2.2.24+

We took the full-length TMEM20 and SLC35E1
sequences from H. sapiens [Ensembl:NM_001134658,
Ensembl:NM_024881], and used them as queries in
TBLASTN 2.2.24+ searches of “nr”, limiting the search
to a set of 12 model organisms (different from selection
in Methods - except retention of the species containing
oldest model organism sequences (underlined)): P. troglodytes (Ptr), R. norvegicus (Rno), T. guttata (Tgu), C.
milii (Cmi), S. purpuratus (Spu), N. vitripennis (Nvi), T.
castaneum (Tca), H. magnipapillata (Hma), T. adhaerens (Tad), C. albicans (Cal), D. discoideum (Ddi),A.

thaliana (Ath). We recorded the TBLASTN 2.2.24+
score for these hits, and observed a drop in score (of
approx. 1/3) in or after the organisms containing the
oldest model organism sequence found in our resolved
dendrogram, i.e. T. adhaerens and D. discoideum.
Testing possible presence in Viridiplantae of TMEM22,
SLC35C1

We established in Methods that the AMAC and
SLC35C/E subfamilies were present in D. discoideum
(TMEM20) and T. adhaerens (SLC35E1), respectively.
To confirm that no other constituent of the AMAC and
SLC35C/E subfamilies, such as TMEM22 or SLC35C1,
are actually older, we performed TBLASTN 2.2.24+
searches with full-length TMEM22 [GenBank:
AAH22557] and SLC35C1 [GenBank:AAH01427]
against “nr” plants (taxid:3193).
Molecular clock analysis of eukaryotic EamA branches

We took the oldest model organism sequences from
each subbranch of AMAC, SLC35C/E and SLC35F: D.
discoideum [DDBJ:BR000891] (TMEM20), T. adhaerens
[DDBJ:BR000889] (SLC35E1), and A. thaliana SLC35F5
[NCBI RefSeq: NP_187364]. We compared these
sequences with their human counterparts ([GenBank:
AAI04815.1], [SwissProt: Q96K37.2], [GenBank:
AAH18537.1]) in the following way.
The second DMT domain of the sequences were first
aligned in MAFFT-EINSI (v6.624b) with default settings,
using 10 rebuilds, and converted to Nexus format. A
guide tree is made using TreePuzzle (v5.2), using the
tree reconstruction option, quartet puzzling tree search
procedure, clocklike branch lengths off, approximate
parameter estimates, “VT” substitution model, and a
uniform model of rate heterogeneity. Secondly, the
guide tree was fed to TreePuzzle with the following
options to calculate distances. Tree reconstruction
option, uses user defined tree search procedure, clocklike branch lengths on, exact parameter estimates, “JTT”
substitution model, mixed model of rate heterogeneity
(1 invariable + 8 gamma rates). The A. thaliana
SLC35F5 orthologue was specified as outgroup.
Extending the study to 19 DMT families, and comparing
distribution in plants and bacteria

Selecting 9 additional DMT families not found in
human, and selecting 9 plant organisms [additional file
16: supplementary table S12], we downloaded the full
sequence set for 19 DMT families [additional file 2: supplementary table S2; additional file 10: supplementary
table S7] using UniProt accession numbers as queries,
to undertake a brief survey. Because this exercise is only
performed for qualitative comparison purpose with bacteria, pfam_scan.pl is not used.

Västermark et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/123

We also recorded the number of sequences in the
Pfam species distribution on the Pfam website for Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria,
Firmicutes, Archaea [additional file 11: supplementary
table S8]. These sequences were aligned as in Methods,
and domain architecture was determined in relation to
TM structure as in Methods.
Identifying the likeliest single domain progenitor to
EamA

In addition to the abovementioned retrievals in 4.12, we
also obtained all seed sequences for each of the nonhuman DMT families and used this as the basis for the
ensuing HMM work with non-human DMTs.
HMMs were trained on bacterial DMT domains, using
HHsearch as in Methods [additional file 14: dmt-hhm.
tgz]. The sequences were taken from Pfam full or “seed”
data sets, if the “seed” contained >= 10 sequences.
These sequences were aligned and a first domain HMM
was trained on them, as in previous methods. A HMM
was trained on subsections of EamA alignment that contained only single copy of EamA (1 × EamA). The full
set first domain EamA and 1 × EamA HHsearch HMMs
were queried against the single domain families:
UPF0546, UPF0060, DUF486 and MDR.
Identification of G-X(6)-G motif in all DMTs containing
two domains, excluding EamA-derived cases

From the alignments of two domain DMT families,
excluding EamA derived cases that have been analysed
by HMM consensus sequence comparison, any glycine
(G) position with >=65% frequency inside a TM segment, was recorded in [additional file 13: supplementary
table S10]. The hypothesis from the EamA HMMs was
an enrichment of G-X(6)-G constellations in the 5th TM
segment of DMT-2 domains.
Assuming a glycine frequency of 7-8%, and simulating
in a Perl script random sequences of glycines and nonglycines, in TM helices ~20 residues long, we established that on average, 7-8% of the TM helices should
have at least one G-X(6)-G. Thus, in the ~70 (67) TM
segments in [additional file 13: supplementary table
S10], we expected to see ~5 TM segments with G-X(6)G. Furthermore, in the 5th TM segment of DMT-2
domains (7 TM segments), we would expect to find
only ~0.5 TM segments with G-X(6)-G.
Breadth-first clustering of first domains of 19 DMTs

A breadth-first clustering was made using HHsearch
similarity score to closest neighbour for first domain,
using 19 DMT families. “Breadth first” is defined as a
clustering strategy where clusters are expanded breadthwise. In the cartoon representation (Figure 5), the spatial
orientation of nearest domain family to a given query

Page 16 of 18

domain family is arbitrary. Note that this strategy obviates the need to use a clustering cutoff and deterministically returns the same number of clusters for the same
input data.
The Phobius prediction for each alignment is used to
determine the prevalent membrane orientation. Intercluster distance, i.e. the highest scoring intercluster connector of all possibilities, was determined from
HHsearch scores. Furthermore, we identified the DMT
family having the lowest HHsearch similarity score to its
nearest neighbour, thus defining the lower limit of similarity of any DMT family to the other families.

domains for the DMT families that have a second domain. The archive
also contains ‘ALL HHS.ods’, a spreadsheet containing the values for all
pairwise comparisons between the HMMs.
Additional file 15: Known substrates in H. sapiens of DMT
nucleotide sugar transporters. The data are taken from UniProt
annotation, having “reviewed” status.
Additional file 16: Table listing 13 plant organisms, used in a
separate extraction of DMT in plants. The table lists UniProt identifier,
species name, common name, and reason for inclusion. The average
divergence time, taken from TimeTree, is the average distance to the
other representatives of Monocots, Dicots, Gymnosperms, Bryophytes, and
Algae, from current example excluding its classification from the average.

Abbreviations
AMAC: acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme; FAE: fatty acid elongase; DUF:
domain unknown function; UPF: unknown protein function; DMT-1: first
DMT domain; DMT-2: second DMT domain.
