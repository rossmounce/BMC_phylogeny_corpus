Investigating Eucalyptus – pathogen and pest
interactions to dissect broad spectrum defense
mechanisms

Background
Eucalyptus species, hybrids and clones are attacked by
various fungal and bacterial pathogens and pests during
their life-time. Global climate changes are predicted to
create favourable environments for such pathogens and
pests and increase incidence of host jumping from other
crops, resulting in increased losses to the forestry industry [1]. The use of tolerant or resistant plant varieties as
part of an integrated disease management strategy is
recognised as a desirable means to curb disease incidence. Vertical resistance mediated by resistance (R)
genes, may be easily overcome by a pathogen and is
thus not adequate on plantation species such as Eucalyptus, which would be exposed to various pathogens
during its life-time. Broad spectrum resistance on the
other hand, would be desirable to provide resistance
against multiple challenges [2].
The aim of this study is to investigate mechanisms
involved in host resistance with an emphasis on broadspectrum resistance. The availability of the complete
genome sequence of Eucalyptus grandis (http://www.
eucagen.org) and the transcriptome sequence of a
E. grandis X E. urophylla (GU) hybrid [3] has provided
resources to investigate defense responses in the natural
host. When a pathogen attacks a plant, the plant
launches a sophisticated defense response involving phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ethylene (ET). These responses are
finely tuned and tailored to the invader [4]. Downstream of the signalling cascade is the production of
pathogenesis related (PR) genes and antimicrobial genes
which serve to limit the pathogen and afford protection.

PR genes, such as PR-1 and PR-5, are known markers of
the salicylic acid defense pathway, while PR-3, PR-4 and
the lipoxygenase (LOX) genes are known markers of the
MeJA and ET signalling pathways. The discovery of PR
genes in Eucalyptus is desirable as these genes have previously been shown to afford broad spectrum resistance
in other crops. We present our progress in exploiting
the Eucalyptus genomic and transcriptomic data for the
discovery of tree defense genes and explore the application thereof in determining which pathways are
activated in response to various pathogens.

Materials and methods
Infections and infestations

E. grandis clones were treated with Chrysoporthe austroafricana in the following manner: wounds were created using a 0.3cm cork borer to expose the cambial
tissue and an agar plug containing fungal mycelia were
applied to the wound and sealed with parafilm. As a
control, plants were mock inoculated. E. nitens plants
were inoculated with Phytophthora cinnamomi using a
0.3cm cork borer, and a mycelial plug applied. The
wound site containing the pathogen was sealed with
moist cheese cloth and parafilm. A set of plants received
no inoculumn. E. grandis clones were maintained in the
FABI nursery and were naturally infested with Leptocybe
invasa. A set of plants were maintained under similar
conditions but were not exposed to the insect pest.
Expression analysis

RNA was harvested from from stem tissue (from C.
austroafricana and P. cinnamomi interactions) and leaf
tissue (for L. invasa interactions) at two time points
after challenge in order to detect early and late
responses. RNA was isolated using the CTAB method

Results and discussion
Reliable pathosystems were established for Eucalyptus
with P. cinnamomi and C. austroafricana. Figure 1A
and 1B show the lesions which developed after pathogen
challenge compared to mock inoculated plants. Figure
1C shows the results of natural infestation of young
leaves of E. grandis clones under nursery conditions
compared to plants not exposed to the pest. The oviposition sites are evident on the leaf midrib (indicated by
the white arrow).
Using a bioinformatic and phylogenetic approach, the
putative orthologs for PR-1, PR-2, PR-3, PR-4 and PR-5
were identified. The basal expression level of PR-3 in
the GU hybrid transcriptome is indicated in Figure 2 as
an example.

The high basal expression of PR-3 in the GU hybrid
may indicate that the MeJA and ET pathway is activated
in this genotype. PR-3 genes are chitinases, enzymes
that are able to hydrolyze chitin, a component of fungal
cell walls [6]. Further expression profiling of the diagnostic marker genes for the two main defense pathways
during C. austroafricana challenge suggests that the SA
pathway is important for defense against the pathogen
in the tolerant interaction.

Conclusions
We have established important pathosystems between
Eucalyptus and a fungal pathogen, Eucalyptus and an
oomycete pathogen and between Eucalyptus and an
insect pest. Genes diagnostic of the main defense signaling pathways have been identified and are being
exploited to determine which pathways are activated in
tree-pest/pathogen interactions. It is expected that transcriptome sequencing of each of these interactions will

not only reveal the suite of genes important for defense
against specific pathogens and pests, but the overlap of
the responses at the molecular level, would be informative for broad spectrum resistance. These genes are
potential future candidates for genetic improvement of
disease tolerance in eucalypts.
