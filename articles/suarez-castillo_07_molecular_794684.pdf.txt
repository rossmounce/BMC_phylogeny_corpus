Abstract
Background: Ependymin (Epd), the predominant protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of teleost
fishes, was originally associated with neuroplasticity and regeneration. Ependymin-related proteins
(Epdrs) have been identified in other vertebrates, including amphibians and mammals. Recently, we
reported the identification and characterization of an Epdr in echinoderms, showing that there are
ependymin family members in non-vertebrate deuterostomes. We have now explored multiple
databases to find Epdrs in different metazoan species. Using these sequences we have performed
genome mapping, molecular phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian
methods, and statistical tests of tree topologies, to ascertain the phylogenetic relationship among
ependymin proteins.
Results: Our results demonstrate that ependymin genes are also present in protostomes. In
addition, as a result of the putative fish-specific genome duplication event and posterior divergence,
the ependymin family can be divided into four groups according to their amino acid composition
and branching pattern in the gene tree: 1) a brain-specific group of ependymin sequences that is
unique to teleost fishes and encompasses the originally described ependymin; 2) a group expressed
in non-brain tissue in fishes; 3) a group expressed in several tissues that appears to be
deuterostome-specific, and 4) a group found in invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes, with
a broad pattern of expression and that probably represents the evolutionary origin of the
ependymins. Using codon-substitution models to statistically assess the selective pressures acting
over the ependymin protein family, we found evidence of episodic positive Darwinian selection and
relaxed selective constraints in each one of the postduplication branches of the gene tree.
However, purifying selection (with among-site variability) appears to be the main influence on the
evolution of each subgroup within the family. Functional divergence among the ependymin paralog
groups is well supported and several amino acid positions are predicted to be critical for this
divergence.
Conclusion: Ependymin proteins are present in vertebrates, invertebrate deuterostomes, and
protostomes. Overall, our analyses suggest that the ependymin protein family is a suitable target
to experimentally test subfunctionalization in gene copies that originated after gene or genome
duplication events.

Background
Ependymin (Epd), a glycoprotein that is found in high
concentrations within the cerebrospinal fluid of teleost
fishes was originally associated with learning processes in
fishes [1]. Although the original protein sequence was
obtained in the 1980's by classical methods of protein
purification, with the advent of molecular biology the epd
genes of many fish species were sequenced [2-6]. epd
sequences have been determined to be a useful tool for
studying the phylogeny of teleost fishes [6], based on high
conservation of piscine sequences in certain regions (i.e.,
in the overall protein domain, specially near the potential
glycosylation sites) and high divergence at others (i.e., at
the amino and carboxyl ends) while retaining enough
phylogenetic signal to resolve with confidence the relationship among distantly related taxa.
More recently ependymin-related proteins (Epdrs) have
been identified in other vertebrates including amphibians
and mammals [7,8]. Since Epds and Epdrs had been
found only in vertebrate species, this protein family was
considered unique to this group [9-11]. However, the discovery by our group of an epdr gene in echinoderms
showed that the family extends to non-vertebrate deuterostomes and questioned whether Epds could be a deuterostome specific protein family [12].
Differences in sequence and tissue expression between
fishes and mammals also surfaced in our previous work.
Whereas in fishes the known Epd proteins are brain-specific [13-15], in mammals the Epd protein is expressed in
several different tissues [7,8]. Moreover, according to our
initial phylogenetic analyses, the echinoderm sequences
clustered with those from mammals and the epd transcript
showed a broad pattern of expression in echinoderm tissues [12].
The availability of new sequence data from piscine
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) projects, allowed us to
identify additional epd members that interestingly were
isolated from non-brain tissue. Some of these "new" epd
sequences came from fishes such as zebrafish, whose
brain-specific epd gene had been well characterized [16].
Zebrafish non-brain derived epd ESTs showed significant
differences (at the expression and amino acid levels) from
the previously known brain associated epd. This fact suggested that the Epd protein family was larger and more
complex than previously thought, and encouraged us to
undertake a systematic search in multiple databases for
new members of this protein family in different metazoans. Our focus was twofold. First, we investigated if the
non-brain specific piscine Epd proteins were evolutionarily more related to the previously known brain-specific
piscine sequences, or if, as suggested by their broader
expression pattern, they were closer to mammal and echi-

noderm Epds. Second, we looked for the presence of Epd
domain-containing proteins in protostomes.
New Epd proteins were identified in our survey from multiple metazoan ESTs and genome databases. Using these
sequences and all the previously well-known epds, we
assembled the most comprehensive Epd dataset to date
for phylogenetic analyses and assessment of natural selection pressure. It was in this context that we attempted to
determine what relationship, if any, exists between the
evolutionary history of this gene family and tissue-specific
patterns of gene expression.
Our findings clearly demonstrate that Epd domain-containing proteins are present in vertebrates, invertebrate
deuterostomes, and protostomes. In addition, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that two fish-specific genome
duplications shaped the evolution of the Epds. The resulting gene duplicates have undergone functional divergence
either by positive selection or relaxed purifying selection,
as indicated by an increased rate of nonsynonymous substitution. Based on our evolutionary analyses we classified
Epds into four protein groups. The absence in tetrapods of
two of these groups provides further support for fish-specific genome duplications [17-20] that resulted in the
appearance of teleost-specific duplicate genes. Our data
suggest that a combination of the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model [21,22] and adaptive evolution in the coding regions [23] contributed to
evolution of both teleost-specific gene copies and a deuterostome-specific Epd protein group. Our analyses identify several codon/amino acid sites that appear to account
for the escape from pseudogenization of these genes and
their gaining of rapid functional divergence [24,25].
The results presented here provide some important clues
to the functional differences of Epds. While the originally
described brain-specific Epds have been associated with
neuroplasticity and optic nerve regeneration in fishes [1],
the mammalian Epds are expressed in a variety of tissues
and specifically the human epd have been shown to be
overexpressed in colon cancer [8] and in hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells just before the onset of proliferation
and differentiation [7]. Moreover, our own studies [12]
demonstrated that the echinoderm epds are expressed in
several tissues and its overexpression suggested its
involvement in intestinal regeneration. Thus, it seems
likely that the structural differences shown here to occur
among Epds, that serve to group them in evolutionary
terms, can also be used to identify their particular functions in the tissues, organs and species where they are
expressed.

Results and Discussion
Identification of new members of the ependymin protein
family
The InterPro [26] Epd protein family (IPR001299) is composed of protein sequences bearing only the Epd domain.
The architecture and signatures defining this domain are
very distinctive [6,7,12]. The fact that there are no
domains/families known to be related to [InterPro:
IPR001299] means that a protein can be assigned to the
Epd family if it displays the sequence patterns established
for the domain.

Taking advantage of recently sequenced genomes and
ongoing EST projects, we were able to find 39 new members of the Epd protein family [see additional file 1:
Table_S1]. The assignment of each sequence to this family
was corroborated by searches in the Conserved Protein
Domains (CDD) database [27], detection of potential Nglycosylation sites [28], comparison of hydropathic profiles [29], prediction of cysteines participating in disulfide
bond formation [30], and the presence of certain amino
acids in conserved positions as compared to previously
well-known Epd proteins. Most of the sequences passed
every one of these tests. Cases where candidate ESTs possessed an N-terminal sequence were also verified by signal
peptide screening [31]. All the newly identified epd
sequences had significant similarity only with other Epd
proteins as determined by Position-Specific Iterated Blast
(PSI-BLAST) and standard BlastP searches [see additional
file 2: Additional_Text for detailed methods].
Interestingly, four of the new epd sequences found during
this study were from protostomes [see additional file 1:
Table_S1]: the mollusks Crassostrea gigas (Oyster_Cgi),
Crassostrea virginica (Oyster_Cvi),Aplysia californica (Aplysia), and Biomphalaria glabrata (Biomphala). The working
names used here are given in parenthesis. The finding of
Epd proteins in mollusks is remarkable since the Epd proteins were once thought to be chordate specific [9-11] and
later deuterostome-specific [12]. The presence of Epd in
mollusks clearly indicates that this family is older than
previously thought and its origin can be traced at least to
the origin of the protostomes. We failed to find Epd
domain-containing proteins in other protostomes for
which genome and EST data is available, such us Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, but this does not rule
out the possibility of finding additional family members
in other protostomes once more metazoan species are
sequenced. In addition, it has recently been proposed that
model species such as Drosophila and C. elegans have suffered extensive gene loss during their natural history and
that this hinders their utility in big scale genome comparisons [32]. An alternative explanation is that the Epd protein family is restricted to the deuterostomes and
lophotrochozoans while absent from the ecdysozoans.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

Additional new members of the Epd protein family were
found in the taxonomic groups: Echinodermata, Urochordata, Cephalochordata, Amphibia, Aves, Elasmobranchii,
and fishes [see additional file 1: Table_S1]. In the latter
group, it is notable that this gene was previously known to
be only expressed in the brain of teleost fishes [13-15].
However, we found several new members of the protein
family expressed in other fish tissues that appear to be
duplications of the previously described brain genes.
Thus, besides the genes known to be expressed in brain,
we found three additional epd genes in zebrafish and Fugu;
two additional copies in Tetraodon, medaka, and salmon;
and an additional copy in the catfish Ictalurus punctatus.
All these new genes have a broader expression pattern
(non-restricted to brain tissue), as can be inferred from
the tissue source information deposited by the authors in
the corresponding ESTs databases.
The 39 newly identified Epd proteins [see additional file
1: Table_S1] were combined with the 35 previously recognized members [see additional file 3: Table_S2] to produce an alignment of 74 members of the family which
served as the basis for our molecular evolutionary analyses.
The protein sequence logo [33,34] representing the alignment of all the 74 Epd sequences (Figure 1) confirmed
that amino (N) and carboxyl (C) ends are not well conserved, increasing similarity in the Epd domain region as
pointed out in previous studies [6-8,12]. Inside the
domain, several amino acids provided a hallmark of Epd
molecules. The most relevant were four cysteines within
the molecule primary sequence at positions 45, 118, 188
and 232 (numbered according to the WebLogo; Figure 1).
These residues have also been predicted by the Disulfind
server [30,35] to participate in disulfide bond formation,
pointing to a key role in protein folding and/or dimeric
interactions and ultimately to the biological function of
the Epds [2,4,36]. Two proteins (Ictalur_GS and
Danio_Tj) were found to lack one of these Cys but this
was probably due to sequencing errors on these ESTs. Pro
residues were usually found one to three residues from the
Cys, particularly next to the first and fourth Cys. In addition, all Epds showed an Asp about 29 residues down
from the initial Cys (D74 in the WebLogo alignment; Figure 1). A Tyr residue (Y73) was found to precede the common Asp in all species except for echinoderms which
showed a Phe at this position. Other residues common to
Epds included: (i) the Gly (G146) at about 28 residues
from the second Cys, (ii) the Pro (P134) at a halfway distance between the second Cys and the common Gly, and
(iii) the Trp (W160), 11–14 residues after the common
Gly. Only 3 species lack this Trp (Oysters have either a Tyr
or a Phe, and the tunicate Diplosoma listerianum has a Tyr).
Also notable was the high conservation of the residues

P44, P48, G53, R81, K120, L123, T184, F226, and P229. In view of
their high positional conservation, and the yet to be determined tridimensional structures of Epd proteins, we can
only suggest that these amino acids are especially important to the overall Epd function.
The Epd protein family members can show highly divergent amino acid sequences but still maintain very similar
hydropathy profiles, suggesting that the overall functional
properties of the proteins are conserved [6]. These hydropathic profiles have been used to link Epd amino acid
similarity with their properties as secreted glycoproteins
[6-8,12]. As shown in Figure 2, the hydropathic profiles of
Epd proteins are very similar. Thus, this family of proteins
is mainly hydrophilic without transmembrane domains,
but possesses a small, highly hydrophobic, region corresponding to the N-terminal signal peptide typical of
secreted proteins.
Virtual mapping
Four epd sequences were found in the zebrafish genome,
all of which mapped to different linkage groups (LG) in
the zebrafish assembly Zv6. The first sequence was the
previously well-known zebrafish epd gene Danio_Bra
(mapped to the LG 5). The other zebrafish Epd genes analyzed were: Danio_Tj (LG 7), Dan_LvItEm (LG 21) and
Danio_MERP (LG 2) [see additional file 4: Table_S3 for
detailed results from mapping]. Two of the zebrafish protein sequences (Danio_Bra and Danio_MERP) had higher
similarity to other vertebrate Epd sequences such as the
goldfish and the human Epd protein than to the other
zebrafish sequences (Figure 3). For instance, the amino
acid similarity between the Danio_Bra and the goldfish
Epd (1Carassius) expressed in brain was 97.2%, the similarity between the Danio_MERP and the human Epd protein (Epdr1_Homo) expressed in several tissues was
75.9%, while the similarity between Danio_Bra and
Danio_MERP was only 60.5%.

Using genome and ESTs information from Tetraodon, we
found that three different epd genes (Tetraod_Br,
Tetraod_Tj, and Tetrao_MEL) mapped to different genomic
locations [see additional file 4: Table_S3]. Pairwise comparisons of the three Tetraodon protein sequences yielded
percentages of similarity ranging between 35% and 43%,
much less than the similarity expected if they were the
same gene. Since the Tetraod_Br and Tetraod_Tj genes were
predicted from genome sequence and are not well supported by Tetraodon cDNAs (as is the case of the
Tetrao_MEL gene), we have proposed that they are
expressed by different tissues (i.e., brain and non-brain
tissue), according to their location in the preliminary gene
trees that we generated from the gathered data.

We found four Fugu Epd sequences (Fugu_Brain,
Fugu_HerGi, Fugu_Tj, and Fugu_MERP) localized to different scaffolds of the current Fugu genome assembly [see
additional file 4: Table_S3]. Amino acid similarity in pairwise comparisons among them ranged from 50.7% to
66.1%.
Three different medaka Epd sequences (Medaka_LW1,
Medaka_LW2, and Medak_MERP) were found and
mapped to different scaffolds in the draft assembly of the
medaka (Oryzias latipes) HdrR genome [see additional file
4: Table_S3]. Medaka_LW1 and Medaka_LW2 Epd proteins were 80% similar and only 46.5% identical, and
each one of them differed from Medak_MERP by 41.3%
and 43.11%, respectively.
Two Ciona epd domain-containing genes (Ciona_Tun1,
Ciona_Tun2) were predicted from the Ciona intestinalis
genome assembly [see additional file 4: Table_S3].
Although the two Ciona Epds were located on the same
chromosome (12q), they were mapped to different
regions and each one was encoded by several non-overlapping ESTs. The identity between the Ciona Epds was
only 33%, providing further support for being different
genes.
We were able to map only one epd gene for the frog (Xenopus tropicalis), chicken, human, mouse, rat, and chimpanzee genomes [see additional file 4: Table_S3]. Although
two different mouse Epd proteins were available on the
databases, our analyses indicated that they may not be
two different genes [see additional file 2: Additional_Text
for details on this issue]. We doubt that the Epdr1_Mus
[GenBank:AY027861] is a mouse gene, but we included
this sequence as well as the reliable mouse sequence
Epdr2_Mus [GenBank:AF353717] in subsequent analyses
since they are both currently acknowledged in GenBank as
separate mouse epd genes.
Phylogenetic distribution and relationships of ependymins
Since previously published phylogenies included only 25
sequences expressed in fish brain [6], a few sequences
from mammals, one from an amphibian [7], and three
from echinoderms [12], our dataset of 74 family members
represents a substantially more comprehensive sample of
Epd diversity. Our results using various methods for phylogenetic inference (Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood,
Neighbor-Joining, and Maximum Parsimony) showed
essentially the same topology (Figure 4). The sole difference was that with maximum parsimony, several unresolved polytomies were obtained in the more derived
branches within each main clade (data not shown). We
note that bootstrap values and posterior probabilities
were low for certain branches. However, an assumption
for the bootstrapping method is even distribution of the

phylogenetic signal throughout the data set [37]. In gene
families like epd, with complete conservation of some sites
and large divergence in others across the phylogeny, this
assumption is not met. Thus, high bootstrap values are
not always expected to be obtained for many nodes,
because the sites supporting the existence of the main
clades may differ from the sites that are useful for resolving the relationships among more derived groups [38].

became divided into the FishBrain and FishTj paralog
groups. Since this part of the tree resembles the duplication topology described by Meyer and colleagues [18], it
could reflect the whole genome duplication postulated to
have occurred during the natural history of teleost fishes
[41]. Thus, it will be important to determine if the shark
position remains unchanged after the addition of more
sequences.

Four clade groups could be inferred from our phylogenetic analyses (Figure 4): a first group that we have called
"FishBrain" is composed of Epd proteins specifically
expressed in teleost fish brain. The original Epd sequences
were located in this group which has been the best studied
group with more than 30 member sequences. In fact, most
of the available Epd sequences from fishes came from an
extensive study [6] which used brain tissue to clone orthologues of goldfish epd in other teleost fishes.

The monophyly of the third group that can be recognized
from the tree (Figure 4) was highly supported. This group
was composed of protein sequences isolated from echinoderms, amphibians, birds, mammals, an Elasmobranchii [Raja_erina], and four sequences from teleost
fishes [Danio_MERP, Medak_MERP, Fugu_MERP, and
Tetrao_MEL]. Since the first acknowledged member of
this group was the human gene epdr1 formerly called
MERP1 [7], we have named this clade the "MERPs" group.
According to published experimental evidence [7,8,12],
and to information deposited in the databases, these
sequences were isolated from a variety of tissue sources,
including but not restricted to brain, heart, skeletal muscle, prostate, kidney, liver, small intestine, colon, spleen
and gonads in human and mouse, and in intestine,
esophagus, mesenteries, gonads, respiratory trees, and
tentacles in echinoderms. Clearly, the expression pattern
of the Epd proteins in the MERPs group is not tissue-specific.

A second group that we named "FishTj" has remained
unnoticed until now. This group is only present in fishes,
but unlike the FishBrain group, its expression is not
restricted to the brain. This group was represented by
twelve Epd sequences that we placed as a putative sister
clade to the FishBrain group (Figure 4). The FishTj group
was composed of complete genes obtained from genome
and ESTs sequencing projects in which the tissue was not
brain derived. In fact, recently the EST sequences Salmo_Tj
from Salmo salar and Medaka_LW2 from the medaka fish
Oryzias latipes were shown to be upregulated in immunologically challenged liver: in the case of the salmonid
sequence, after being exposed to the pathogen Aeromonas
salmonicida [39], and in the case of medaka, after being
exposed to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist TCDD
[40]. Thus, from the response displayed by these animals
under toxic stress, we suggest that these FishTj Epds might
be involved in repair following hepatic injury.
All the teleost fish species that have an epd gene in the
FishTj group also have an unlinked epd copy in the FishBrain group (Figure 4). The only exception to this observation is the medaka where no brain-specific Epd protein
was found, probably due to incomplete sequencing or
assembling. In our results, the bootstrap value and posterior probability that support the FishTj group as a monophyletic clade are low, but the cohesion among the FishTj
proteins is graphically strong. We predict that as more piscine epd sequences isolated from tissues other than brain
become available, the support value for this group will
raise dramatically.
It is interesting to note the position of the shark Epd
sequence [Shark_Squa] (Figure 4). With the current information, this sequence was placed as the putative root of a
big clade containing sequences only present in fishes that

Although statistical support was poor (Figure 4), we also
postulate the existence of a fourth Epd group that includes
the evolutionary more basal species. This group, that we
named "Basal", clusters epd genes from protostomes (mollusks) and deuterostomes (tunicates and amphioxus).
Since all Basal group Epds are from invertebrates, we
expected echinoderm sequences to fall within this group
as well. Therefore, we performed the SH [42], KH and
RELL [43] tests to compare the expected placement of
echinoderm sequences within the Basal group as opposed
to their placement inside the MERPs group observed in
the inferred tree topology (Figure 4). However, all tests
indicated significantly better support (p < 0.0001) for
their assignment to the MERPs group. A notable misplacement in the Basal group was the location of the epd gene
from oysters as sister to the amphioxus epd gene; instead
of being sister group of the other mollusks: Aplysia californica [Aplysia] and Biomphalaria glabrata [Biomphala]. This
misplacement (Figure 4) did not fit the data significantly
better than the expected phylogenetic placement of the
oysters as sisters of the other mollusks (pKH = 0.107, pSH
= 0.112, pRELL = 0.101).
Interestingly, the epd sequence isolated from the oyster
Crassostrea gigas [Oyster_Cgi] has been recently shown to
be up-regulated in the digestive gland of these animals

The dashed and thick branches represent 91 – 92 % and >95% Bayesian posterior probability respectively. Only the ML and NJ
bootstrap values >50% are shown. The labels on the tips correspond to the working names given to the sequences used in this

the gray circles) and postspeciation branches (PS; postdating divergence of the species). To facilitate interpretation of PD and
PS branches, this tree has been rooted at the proposed Basal group composed by the mollusks, tunicates, and amphioxus. The
other proposed groups are also indicated as PD and PS branches (i.e., PSFishTj, PSFishBrain, PSMERPs). All analyses were done using
unrooted trees. The branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale bar in the figure).

after a week of exposure to hydrocarbon contamination
[44]. Since the digestive gland, similar to the liver, is
known to plays major roles in metabolism and detoxification, this may imply that Epds in mollusks and vertebrates
have conserved functions.
We expected that within each Epd paralog group, the species gene tree would be obtained after phylogenetic reconstruction. This was achieved for the FishBrain group where
the branching pattern agreed considerably with previous
studies focused on the phylogenetic relationship of teleost
fishes [6,45,46]. In spite of the awkward, but statistically
well supported positioning of the Epd sequences from
echinoderms, the overall branching pattern inside the
MERPs group also agreed satisfactorily with the expected
species tree. However sampling bias against the metazoan
groups that may carry genes belonging to any of the previously unidentified Epd groups (FishTj and Basal) appears
to be the main impediment to obtain good statistical support for their monophyly and resolve the species relationships among the proteins inside each group. Thus, our
reconstruction of the Epd phylogeny strongly agrees with
the 2R hypothesis [41], providing a good example for the
two rounds of genome duplications proposed to have
occurred early in the vertebrate lineage; all exceptions
found in the inferred topology are highlighted by low support values.
Descriptive analysis of the ependymin protein family
subgroups
To analyze the particular characteristics of each Epd group
we selected only complete sequences with the initial
methionine and the final stop codon. These included 13
Epds from the FishBrain group, 11 from the MERPs, 9
from the FishTj, and 6 from the Basal. Table 1 shows the
major findings of these comparisons. If we use the Basal
group to represent the putative original molecule it serves
as a point of comparison on how the other group molecules have diverged. We are conscious that this Basal
group contains species from three different phyla that
might be quite distant from one another. Nonetheless, if

we do the same analysis using only the two mollusk complete sequences, the variability they show between them is
similar to that when compared with the other two phyla,
thus essentially the same results are obtained.
When compared to the Basal group, Epds from the other
three groups show an increase in size. This increase is particularly evident in the MERPs with an average increase in
size of 25 residues (or about 13%) over the Basal group.
Our sequence comparisons show that it is in terms of the
amino acid composition that the groups show highly significant differences. The predicted isoelectric point of the
Basal group varies from 5 to 6.45. However, the FishBrain
Epds show an acidic isoelectric point of around 5.1, while
the isoelectric point of MERPs and FishTj Epds is around
6.5. The different isoelectric points are mainly due to a
larger number of acidic residues and a decrease in basic
residues found in FishBrain Epds, making the ratio of
acidic to basic residues almost double that of other Epds.
Other differences among the Epd groups are noticeable.
FishTj Epds have a significantly higher aliphatic index
than the other groups. However, at the amino acid level,
it is surprising that the number of Phe residues is almost
halved in the MERPs in comparison to other groups. Similarly, the number of Trp residues in the molecules shows
significant differences among the groups. The Basal species and the FishBrain molecules have an average of 2 Trps
in their sequences, which increases to 3.2 in FishTj and to
6.6 in MERPs; this latter change is astonishing given that
Trp is the largest and rarest amino acid. A similar trend is
observed with the number of Pro residues, although the
number only increases 50% between the Basal group and
the MERPs. An additional comparative analysis of the predicted amino acid modifications in Epd proteins, including
N-myristoylation,
N-glycosylation
and
phosphorylation sites is available [see additional file 2:
Additional_Text].
Apart from the amino acid residues that characterize the
protein family (Figure 1); there are several amino acid fea-

tures that typify each one Epd subgroup. These group-specific signatures were revealed using sequence logos
generated from sub-alignments containing only the members of each group (Figure 5) [see additional file 2:
Additional_Text]. This analysis clearly shows a divergent
pattern of amino acid usage and conservation among the
Epd family subgroups. This pattern suggests differences in
selective constraints, likely arising from divergence in
structural and functional aspects of the proteins phenotype.
Analysis of selective pressures acting over the ependymin
protein family
The fact that some Basal group sequences were found in
protostomes (mollusks), lead us to suggest that this group
represents the evolutionary origin of the Epd molecules.
Alternatively, it may indicate that the Epd protein evolved
in an ancestor of the protostomes and deuterostomes, but
expanded into a gene family only within the deuterostomes. Under either scenario, the MERPs, FishBrain and
FishTj groups represent the more derived members of the
Epd protein family.

Different selective pressures acting over each Epd paralog
group could have favored fixation of different sequences
in each metazoan genome. To investigate the divergence
of Epd groups, we used the rate of nonsynonymous (dN)
and synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitution ratio (ω), as
implemented in codon models of molecular evolution
[47,48]. In this statistical approach, an ω < 1 indicates the
action of purifying selection (i.e., a selective constraint
against mutations that negatively impact the function of
the protein); ω = 1 is consistent with neutral evolution,
and ω > 1 indicates positive Darwinian selection (i.e.,
favoring the fixation of beneficial amino acid changes)
[49].
We used the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic to determine if the selective pressure is significantly different
between postduplication (PD) and postspeciation (PS)
branches in the Epd phylogeny (Figure 4). We fitted two
different PD-PS models to our data (see Methods) and
contrasted each PD-PS model against a one-ratio model
(M0) that assumed that PD branches as well as PS
branches were subjected to the same selective pressure.
The LRTs gave significantly higher support (p ≤ 0.0003) to
all the tested PD-PS models over the M0 model [see additional file 5: Table_S4]. Estimates of PD-PS model parameters suggest that (i) just after the duplication events, the
fixation of amino acid changes increased in PD branches,
and (ii) the rate of amino acid evolution decreased in PS
branches, presumably due to more stringent levels of purifying selection. For instance, estimates under the Mps1
model were: ω(PD) = 1.139, ω(PS) = 0.161 and background

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

ωb ratio = 0.056. In both tested PD-PS models dN values
averaged 0.089 and dS values averaged 0.741.
Furthermore, our branch based analyses suggest that each
Epd paralog group has been subjected to a different selective pressure during their natural history. The paralog
models (Mp1, Mp2, and Mp3; see Methods) that allow for
paralog-specific differences in selection pressure provided
a significantly better explanation of the data (p < 0.0001,
[see additional file 5: Table_S4]) than did the one-ratio
model (M0) assuming no differences in selection pressure
among Epd paralog groups.
Since each Epd group has particular amino acid features
that differentiate it from other paralogs (Figure 5); we also
expected the selective pressure to vary among sites and
among Epd paralog groups. Therefore, we applied sitemodels of codon evolution to evaluate this scenario using
each of the Epd groups (FishBrain, FishTj, MERPs and
Basal) as separate data sets. When we applied the oneratio site-model (M0) to each sub-dataset, the estimates of
the ω ratio averaged over all sites for each paralog group
(i.e., ωMERPs = 0.115, ωFishBrain = 0.182, ωFishTj = 0.195, ωBasal
= 0.051) were all consistent with the ω estimates previously obtained under the Mp1 Paralog model [see additional file 5: Table_S4]. However, a LRT contrasting these
separate analyses under M0 to M3, which allows amongsite variation in the selective pressure, revealed significant
heterogeneity in selective pressures within each member
of the Epd family (p < 0.0001, [see additional file 5:
Table_S4]). We note that this is not an unexpected result,
as genes encoding functional protein products typically
exhibit significant variation in selection pressure among
sites. In addition, all Epd paralogs had a class of sites subjected to a rather strong purifying selection (ωo ranging
form 0.003 to 0.014) but the fraction of such sites varies
widely among paralogs (from 10% to 30%, [see additional file 5: Table_S4]).
Signature residues for the entire Epd family (Figure 1),
such as the four strictly conserved Cys, are predicted to be
critical for the common biological function of all Epd
genes. In this context, we expected such residues to be
localized in codon sites subjected to very strong purifying
selection against nonsynonymous changes. When we
applied the codon site models to the data set comprised of
70 Epd proteins (see Methods), we found that a LRT contrasting the site-models M0 and M3 was highly significant
(p < 0.0001, [see additional file 5: Table_S4]), providing
support for considerable variability in the selective pressures acting within the member genes of the Epd family.
When we plotted the approximate posterior mean of the
ω ratio at each codon site of the whole Epd protein family
(Figure 1), the amino acids present in the most evolutionarily constrained positions with a ω ≤ 0.04 were: C45, P48,

G53, Y73, D74, E98, I100, F109, T115, C118, K120, P134, S137,
G146, W160, C188, F226, P229 and C232. For all these residues
except for E98, the finding of strong evolutionary constraint is corroborated by our previous comparative analysis of sequence logos (Figure 1 and Figure 5). The E98 site
appears to be evolutionarily selected for acid residues in
the more derived members of the Epd protein family;
since this site is occupied by a Glu in all the members of
the MERPs group, by an Asp in all the members of the
FishBrain and FishTj groups. But in the Basal group this
position is occupied by the aliphatic amino acid Leu.
The analysis of selective pressure acting in average over all
sites of the entire data set and sub-datasets [see additional
file 5: Table_S4], suggest that purifying selection (with
among-site variability) has been the main influence on
the evolution of the entire Epd protein family (ω0 =
0.1553) and their sub-groups (ωMERPs = 0.115, ωFishBrain =
0.182, ωFishTj = 0.195, ωBasal = 0.051). Moreover, none of
the site-specific codon models (suitable for detecting
adaptive evolution) implemented to the datasets, suggested the action of positive selection when the appropriate LRTs were performed (M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8. data
not shown). However, these site models averaged the
selective pressure over all sites of the whole phylogeny or
subgroups, and might have failed to detect short episodes
of positive selection taking place over a few amino acid
sites after a duplication event. Therefore, we implemented
the branch-site models A and B [50-52] to detect if positive selection was driving the evolution of some sites
along specific branches of the Epd phylogeny. These models let the ω ratio vary among sites and among lineages.
We performed the Test 2 or "branch-site test of positive
selection" [51,52] (see Methods) contrasting the model A
against itself with ω2 fixed to 1 for each PD branch as
defined in Figure 4 (FishBrain, FishTj, or MERPs). We
found evidence of episodic adaptive evolution acting
along the MERPs branch (p < 0.0001; [see additional file
5: Table_S4]). Five sites (86, 128, 196, 224 and 231 -numbered according to the WebLogo on Figure 1) had a high
posterior probability (> 0.95) of being positively selected
considering the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) method as
implemented on model A [51]. The site 86 is occupied in
the MERPs group by basic amino acids with positively
charged side chains (Arg, Lys, or His). In the FishBrain
group this position is occupied only by polar amino acids
being the more common Asn, Asp and Ser. Quite the
opposite is observed for this position in the FishTj group,
in which this site is occupied only by hydrophobic amino
acids. However, in the Basal group this site is very variable
and can be occupied by either polar or hydrophobic
amino acids. The site 128 is strictly occupied by the aromatic amino acid Trp in all members of the MERPs group;
it is preferentially occupied by aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr
or Trp) in the FishTj and Basal groups. In contrast, in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

FishBrain group this site is highly variable and usually
occupied by Arg and Lys. The same analysis can be done
for the sites 196, 224 and 231 that are preferentially occupied in the MERPs group by the hydroxylic amino acids
Thr (sites 196 and 231) and Ser (site 224); while these
sites are highly variable in the other paralog groups, being
occupied mostly by non-hydroxylic polar residues.
Along the FishTj branch, we also obtained significant evidence for positive selection according to the Test 2 (p =
0.0233; [see additional file 5: Table_S4]), but only the
amino acid site 144 was predicted with the BEB method
under Model A. In the FishTj group, this site is occupied
by an aliphatic amino acid (Val or Ile). In contrast, in the
FishBrain group an aromatic residue (either Tyr or Phe) is
usually present, except in the Fugu_Brain and the
Tetraod_Br sequences that have a Ser. Interestingly, in the
MERPs group, all the mammalian sequences have a Ser at
position 144, but all other taxa within this group (i.e.,
fishes, amphibians, birds and echinoderms) have aromatic residues. Position 144 is highly variable in the Basal
group and shows no clear pattern of amino acid replacement.
In contrast to the MERPs and FishTj groups, the evidence
for positive selection affecting the FishBrain lineage was
not as clear (p = 0.0747; [see additional file 5: Table_S4]),
and can be considered only to be marginal support for
adaptive selection or relaxed selective constraints at three
sites (51, 126 and 186). In the FishBrain group, the residue in position 51 is almost always occupied by the
hydroxylic amino acid Thr, except in the sequences Rhamphicht and 2Carassius which have Ile in this site. This
position is occupied by non-polar amino acids in all other
groups, and is always Trp in the MERPs group. The site
126 in the FishBrain group can be occupied by polar (Tyr,
Ser or Cys) and non-polar amino acids (Phe); but in the
MERPs group this position is only occupied by polar
amino acids such as Gln, and specially the acidic amino
acids Glu and Asp. The amino acid composition of this
site for the FishTj and Basal groups is highly variable,
without a clear pattern. Position 186 is one of four contiguous amino acids conserved in all FishBrain and FishTj
groups (but not in the fish sequences belonging to the
MERPs group), and in the sequences Sea_cucumb and
Ciona_Tun2. These amino acids appear to be specifically
inserted in FishBrain and FishTj sequences and later on by
convergence, the sequences from echinoderms and one of
the Ciona epd genes might have acquired it. Alternatively,
these four amino acids could have been lost specifically in
the ancestral MERP sequence and also in certain Basal
groups, with exception of the echinoderms and one of the
Ciona sequences.

Almost all the available sequences from the FishBrain
group have a Cys in position 186, which is one amino acid
before the third common Cys (C188). Only in Percomorpha and Salmoniformes is this Cys substituted by Gly.
These cysteines, which are very close together in the Epd
linear structure, are predicted by the Disulfind server
[30,35] to form disulfide bonds. The consistent occurrence of Gly, a small amino acid with a very high conformational flexibility, between the C186 and C188 would
permit a disulfide bridge between them, since Gly does
not present a steric obstacle. Alternatively, although with
a lower confidence of connectivity, C186 may participate in
shuffling reactions forming potentially an array of
disulfide intermediate species as result of its binding with
other cysteines [53]. Only when the crystallographic structure of proteins belonging to the different Epd protein
subgroups is obtained and careful functional assays are
performed, we will be able to test if the different possible
transition stages of disulfide bonding are having an
impact on the functional divergence among Epds paralogs.
Detection of functional divergence among ependymin
paralogs
Detectable differences in the site-rate of amino acid
replacement between Epd paralog groups can give us an
idea of the grade of functional divergence generated since
the duplicated genes diverged, splitting ancestral functions or generating new ones, and consequently succeeded avoiding pseudogenization. The coefficient of
evolutionary functional divergence (θ) obtained for each
Epd paralog pair comparison was significantly greater
than zero (Table 2), indicating that there is significant heterogeneity in the amino acid site-specific rate of evolution
among Epd paralogs. This result further supports the estimates obtained at the codon level by applying Paralog
models and site-models to separate datasets of the paralogs (see previous section). That is, that each Epd group
has been subjected to different functional constraints in

specific amino acid sites and therefore, functional divergence among them can be inferred.
The six possible pairwise comparisons among Epd paralog
groups were performed (Table 2). The comparison
between the FishBrain and MERPs groups showed the
highest value for θ (0.85 ± 0.12), suggesting that these two
groups have diverged considerably more at the functional
level. This estimate is supported by the fact that the
expression pattern of these proteins is the more dissimilar,
being the proteins belonging to the FishBrain group
expressed exclusively in brain tissue [13-15], and the ones
from the MERPs group expressed in several tissues including brain [7,12]. High θ values are also found for each one
of the pairwise comparisons that can be done against the
Basal group, suggesting that if the proteins belonging to
the Basal group are in fact the root of the epd gene tree, the
derived groups have significantly diverged functionally
from the ancestral gene function, expression pattern or
both. This measure of functional divergence among the
groups (FishBrain, FishTj and MERPs) that were contrasted with the Basal group was not equidistant: the predicted functional divergence between the FishTj group
and the Basal group (θ = 0.81 ± 0.15) is higher than that
for FishBrain vs. Basal (θ = 0.63 ± 0.13) or MERPs vs. Basal
(θ = 0.70 ± 0.21). As could be expected from the gene tree
(Figure 4), the smallest θ value (being however also significantly greater than zero) was obtained for the FishBrain
vs. FishTj comparison (θ = 0.35 ± 0.09). The inferred phylogenetic gene tree suggests us that the duplication that
gave rise to the FishBrain and FishTj paralog epd genes was
posterior to the appearance of the MERPs group. Thus, the
FishTj and FishBrain shared more time together and
although the FishBrain group already has a very restricted
pattern of expression that contrasts with the ample array
of tissues from which FishTj genes have been isolated, we
might suppose that some functional overlap may remain.
Of course, it will be interesting to corroborate this
assumption with experimental data where knocking out

one of the genes is compensated (at least partially) by the
other. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient of functional
divergence between the FishTj and the MERPs group (θ =
0.52 ± 0.09) is not as high as we could suppose from the
gene tree, although this would suggest different functional
roles it can not exclude that some of these functions overlap.
Posterior Bayesian analysis predicted several amino acid
positions that may account for the inferred functional
divergence among the Epd paralog groups (Figure 6).
Even though, sites with an estimated posterior probability
(PP) < 0.8 have been experimentally proved to be important for the observed functional divergence between the
two major Caspase subfamilies [54]; the cutoff value for
residue selection is an empirical decision and is expected
to depend on the intrinsic properties of the protein family
being analyzed. Thus, while in [54] they obtained 21 candidate functional divergence-related sites using 0.61 as
cutoff value, the same cutoff value predicts 53 sites for the
Epd data. Since no 3D structure of any Epd protein is yet
available, we lack a way to verify where these sites would
be located nor how the rate-shift in these sites contributed
to structural and functional divergence among the Epd
paralogs. Nonetheless, we can further narrow our criteria
for site prediction expecting that in the case of the Epd
data, sites predicted with a more stringent PP (i.e., > 0.9)
be in fact functional divergence-related sites that can serve
as a discrete starting point for future functional character-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

ization of the Epd proteins. Twenty-three rate-shifted
amino acid sites (8.8% of total sites) were predicted with
a PP > 0.9 of being functional divergence-related sites for
any of the six possible pairwise comparisons among Epd
paralog groups (Figure 6). The rate-shifted site 161 (the
amino acid after the common Trp of the Epds -see Figure
1), for example, is predicted with a PP = 0.99 to be able to
functionally distinguish the members of the FishBrain
from the members of the MERPs group, with a PP = 0.93
to distinguish the FishTj from the MERPs group, and with
intermediate PPs to distinguish FishBrain from Basal (PP
= 0.68), FishTj from Basal (PP = 0.79) and MERPs from
Basal (PP = 0.82); but this same site only has a PP = 0.14
to discriminate FishBrain from FishTj proteins. When this
site was localized in the subgroups alignments (site indicated by an arrow in the Figure 5), it is clear that being
highly variable, the site is not useful for discriminating
between FishBrain and FishTj proteins. In contrast, the
MERPs Epd proteins have a Ser fixed in this position
which is within the stretches of amino acids diagnostic of
this group (QEWSDR--aR--E-WXGxyT, underlined in the
MERPs WebLogo, Figure 5C). In addition, in the Basal
group site 161 is occupied with almost equal occurrence
by Ser, Asn, His, Tyr, or Arg. Consequently, once the 3D
structure of Epd proteins from the differences subgroups
are available, and site-directed functional experiments can
be done, we expect to be able to corroborate that the rateshifted site 161 is somehow important to the particular
function of the MERPs Epds.

A similar analysis can be performed for all the other 22
rate-shifted predicted sites. It is worth noting that sites
128 and 144, predicted to be under positive selection in
the MERPs and FishTj lineages respectively by using
branch-site codon models (see previous section), were
also predicted to be functional divergence-related sites
using this very different approach. As previously noted,
the site 128 is preferentially occupied by aromatic residues in the FishTj, Basal and MERPs groups, being always
occupied by a Trp in the latter; but in the FishBrain group
this site is very variable. This explains why this site has a
PP = 0.90 of being related with the type 1 functional divergence between the MERPs and FishBrain groups, and has
intermediate PPs for the other possible comparisons: FishBrain vs. FishTj (PP = 0.72), FishBrain vs. Basal (PP =
0.77), FishTj vs. Basal (PP = 0.74), MERPs vs. Basal (PP =
0.63) and FishTj vs. MERPs (PP = 0.43). It is also noteworthy that the presence of aromatic amino acids at this site
can distinguish the Epd proteins that are exclusively
expressed in the brain, from the proteins that have a wider
expression pattern. Additionally, the presence of a Trp at
this site appears to be important for the function of the
Epds belonging to the MERPs group as suggested by the
convergent results obtained using codon models and the
search for type 1 functional divergence related sites (see
Methods).
Position 144 was predicted to be under positive selection
and additionally to be related to functional divergence.
This site has a PP = 0.92 for discriminating between the
FishBrain and the MERPs groups and with less confidence
can distinguish between other groups: FishTj vs. Basal (PP
= 0.78), FishTj vs. Brain (PP = 0.77), FishBrain vs. Basal
(PP = 0.64), MERPs vs. Basal (PP = 0.61) and FishTj vs.
MERPs (PP = 0.22). Contrary to what occurs with site 128,
the relationship of aromatic amino acids and tissue specific expression appears to be inverse in site 144. Thus, the
preferential occurrence of aromatic amino acids in the
FishBrain group (particularly Tyr) appears to be important
for the functional divergence of FishBrain group as compared with the others.

Conclusion
The Epd protein family is not deuterostome-specific as
previously thought. We provide evidence that Epds are
also present in protostomes. Our results suggest that fishspecific gene and/or genome duplications triggered diversification of the Epd protein family into four groups. Two
of these groups (FishBrain and FishTj) are unique to
fishes; a third appears to be deuterostome-specific
(MERPs), and the fourth (Basal) has been only found in
invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes. Statistical
analyses of selective pressures indicate that episodic positive selection and relaxed selective constraints have
shaped the evolution of the Epd proteins. However, puri-

fying selection (with among-site variability) appears to be
the main influence on the evolution of each subgroup
within the family. We detected functional divergence
among the Epd groups and amino acid sites that account
for it. Taken as a whole, our phylogenetic results and the
tissue-specific patterns of expression of the different Epd
proteins, suggest that this protein family is a suitable target to experimentally test subfunctionalization in gene
copies resulting from duplication events [55,56]. We reiterate that protein structural information and more experimental data including functional knocking out assays
remains to be obtained from representative members of
the four Epd protein groups described here. Thus, we
hope that our findings encourage and serve as useful
guidelines to further research on how evolution shaped
the Epd protein family, their conserved and divergent
gene functions.

Methods
Gathering of sequences
Thirty five sequences previously used in phylogenetic
analyses of the Epd protein family [6,7,12] were used in
the present study as starting material to search several data
bases for additional family members. The taxonomic
group, working names, species names, accession numbers
and bibliographic information of these sequences are provided [see additional file 3: Table_S2]. [See additional file
2: Additional_Text for a detailed description of the methods used for searching and identifying new Epds, including the tests performed to substantiate the placement of
each one into the Epd protein family].
Virtual mapping
For genome searches and cross mapping of epd genes we
used publicly available databases. This included the
Ensembl release v40 [57] and the specific genome browsers for each sequenced species such as Genome Browser at
Genoscope [58] for Tetraodon and Genome Browser at
University of Tokyo [59] for medaka. To find exact
matches to a chromosome location, contig or scaffold we
used the Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing
Algorithm (SSAHA tool in Ensembl) [60] to align DNA
sequences to the current assembly within Ensembl. Once
two or more paralog epd genes from the same species were
found, a ClustalW alignment was performed, and the percentage of similarity among them was determined.
Sequence alignments
All the Epd sequences were aligned with the software
ClustalX v.1.81 [61] using the BLOSUM30 matrix. GeneDoc v.2.6.002 was used for manual improvement of the
alignment by eye. This led to an alignment of 74 Epd
domain-containing proteins (35 previously known and
39 new sequences) having 261 amino acid positions.

and subsets) were created online using WebLogo Version
2.8.2 [33,34]. All the multiple sequence alignments are
available upon request.
Phylogenetic analysis
We carried out phylogenetic inference on the full alignment of 74 sequences. Protein trees were built using Maximum-likelihood (ML), Bayesian inference, NeighborJoining (NJ), and Maximum Parsimony (MP). The ML
optimality criterion as implemented in PHYML v2.4.4
[62] was used applying the WAG amino acid substitution
matrix, empirical model for globular proteins [63],
accounting for site-to-site rate variation using a discrete
gamma distribution with four rate categories and invariable sites; the proportion of invariable sites was estimated
from the data and support for individual branches was
inferred by bootstrap analyses (100 replicates). For Bayesian inference we used MrBayes v3.0b4 [64] making five
independent runs using the same settings: starting with a
random tree, using mixed models of amino acid substitutions, generating trees for 5 million generations with sampling every 100 generations, and with four chains (three
with the heating parameter set to 0.2). The first 1,250,000
generations (12,500 trees) were discarded from every run
and the remaining trees were concatenated. The remaining 187,500 trees were used to compute the final (consensus) tree, and to determine the posterior probabilities at
the different nodes. The convergence of the five independent runs was calculated and confirmed as described in
[65]. NJ and MP trees were built using PAUP* v.4.0b10 for
Unix [66]. The NJ tree [67] was constructed based on
mean character differences (distance) and bootstrap support values were determined based on 10,000 neighbor
joining replicates. The MP tree [68] was obtained using
the heuristic search method. All the 261 amino acid characters had equal weight and 239 of them were parsimonyinformative. The MP tree was built via random stepwise
addition of the sequences and the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm (NR = 10) with
100 bootstrap replicates.
Tests of tree topologies
The inferred gene tree topology was tested against the
expected species tree [69] for the cases in which they were
not coincident. For a given comparison between the gene
tree topology and the alternative topology derived from
the expected species relationships, the Kishino-Hasegawa
(KH) [43] and Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) [42] tests were
performed in both cases using a time-saving approximation, the RELL method with 10,000 replicates of nonparametric bootstrapping [43]. Two trees were compared each
time; the ML tree in Figure 4 and a tree modified using the
tree editor of TreeView v.1.6.6 [70] to relocate misplaced
taxa in agreement with the species phylogeny [71]. Tests
were carried out as implemented in Codeml (PAML pack-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

age V.3.14b) [72,73] by using unrooted trees, and assuming the empirical model WAG.
Statistical analyses of selective pressure
To study the selective pressure on the Epd domain-containing proteins, we excluded the Paracheiro, Sea_urchin,
Chicken_Gg, and Epdr_Chimp sequences to avoid small
sectors of uncertainty due to the presence of scattered Ns
in their nucleotide sequences. These nucleotide uncertainties, however, do not affect their amino acid translation,
allowing their inclusion on the amino acid-based analyses
described above. The nucleotide sequences for the
remaining 70 lineages were aligned according to their
translated protein sequence using CodonAlign 2.0. With
the codon alignment and the corresponding unrooted ML
protein tree, we implemented several Markov models of
codon evolution (which describe the substitution process
between 61 of the 64 codons) to statistically estimate the
selective pressures acting over all codon sites, specific
branches, and sites within given branches of the Epd protein family phylogeny. In these analyses, maximum likelihood estimates of the selective pressure (ω) were obtained
as the nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitution rate ratio (dN/dS) with a dN/dS (ω) = 1
meaning neutral evolution, ω < 1 purifying selection, and
ω > 1 diversifying positive selection [49]. The first and
simplest model considered was the M0 (one-ratio model),
which assumes the same ω ratio for all branches in the
phylogeny and all codon sites in the alignment. Branch
models allow for different values of ω along branches in
the tree [74,75]; we applied them to analyze the outcome
of the putative duplication events that occurred during the
natural history of the Epd protein family. We implemented the PD-PS model [71] that estimates different ω
ratios for postduplication (PD) and postspeciation (PS)
branches in a tree and allows to test if the rate of amino
acid replacement along PD branches is significantly
higher compared to PS branches. Specifically, we were
interested if fixation of nonsynonymous amino acid
changes has been favored by positive selection following
a duplication event (PD branches), and then decreased
once a new function had evolved due to the dominance of
purifying selection (PS branches) [76,77]. We fitted two
PD-PS models to our data (Figure 4). The first model
(Mps1) assigned one ω ratio to the PD branches in the tree
[ωMERPs(PD), ωFishBrain(PD), and ωFishTj(PD)], a second ω to
their corresponding PS branches [ωMERPs(PS), ωFishBrain(PS),
and ωFishTj(PS)], and a third ω to all remaining branches
(background ratio ωb). The second PD-PS model (Mps2)
assigned one ω to the PD branches immediately postdating the putative gene duplication event D2 [ωFishBrain(PD)
and ωFishTj(PD)], a second ω to their corresponding PS
branches [ωFishBrain(PS) and ωFishTj(PS)], and a third ωb, for
all other branches. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was done
to compare the M0 one-ratio model [ω(PD) = ω(PS)] with

Page 16 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:23

each one of the PD-PS models [i.e., ω(PD) ≠ ω(PS) in Mps1
and Mps2]. The LRT statistic was calculated as twice the
difference between the log likelihood scores of the two
nested models, and was compared to the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom (df) equal to the difference in number of free parameters between the two
models [see additional file 5: Table_S4].
We also implemented the Paralog model [71]; which
allows testing for divergent selection pressures among paralogs following a gene duplication event. Hypothetically,
if this subfunctionalization [21] involved both the regulatory sequences and the protein coding sequences, there
could be differential loss of selection pressure on different
parts of the protein detectable with a Paralog branch
model [71]. We fitted three Paralog models to our data.
The first model (Mp1) estimated one ω ratio for each of
the paralog clades derived from the Basal Epd group
(ωMERPs, ωFishBrain and ωFishTj) and one ωb background
ratio. The second Paralog model (Mp2) assumed one ω for
each of the paralog piscine clades originating after the D2
duplication (ωFishBrain and ωFishTj), and another ωb for all
other branches. The third Paralog model (Mp3) estimated
one ωb background ratio, one ω for the MERPS paralog
clade (ωMERPs), and one (ωNon-MERPs) for all others. A LRT
comparing the M0 one-ratio model (ωMERPs = ωFishBrain =
ωFishTj) with each one of the Paralog models (e.g., Mp1:
ωMERPs ≠ ωFishBrain ≠ ωFishTj) was then performed to test for
significant differences in selective pressure among Epd
paralogs [see additional file 5: Table_S4].
We also implemented site-based models of codon evolution that allowed the ω ratio to vary among sites (among
codons or amino acids in the protein) [51,78,79]. A
model (M3) that allows for three discrete classes (k = 3) of
ω within the gene was contrasted with a LRT against a oneratio model (M0) in which the ω ratio averaged over all
gene sites. Other LRTs contrasted additional site-models
evaluated to detect positive selection acting in average
over all sites in the phylogeny: M1a (NearlyNeutral)
against M2a (PositiveSelection), and M7 (beta) against
M8 (beta&ω). Given that these site models might not
detect positive selection affecting only a few sites along a
few lineages after a duplication event, we also implemented the branch-site models A and B which let the ω
ratio vary both among sites and among lineages [50-52].
The Models A and B had four ω site classes with three estimates of the ω ratio: site class 0 included strongly conserved codon sites in all branches (0 <ω0 < 1); site class 1
included neutrally evolving sites across all branches (ω1 =
1); and site classes 2a and 2b included those sites that
were either conserved (0 <ω0 < 1) or neutral (ω1 = 1) on
background branches but with a ω2 > 1 on the foreground
branch of interest (i.e., PD branches in the Epd tree topology). Model A estimated ω0 (0 <ω0 <1) from the data and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/23

fixed ω1 = 1, while model B estimated the ω0 and ω1
parameters from the data. Based on these models we were
able to conduct the following LRTs: (i) model B versus a
discrete model M3 with (K = 2) site classes, (ii) model A
versus M1a [Test 1], and (iii) model A with ω2 as a free
parameter versus model A with ω2 fixed at 1. This test [Test
2] is known as "the branch-site test of positive selection";
see [51,52] for a detailed description of these latter two
tests.
These analyses of selective pressure were performed by
using the Codeml program of the PAML package V.3.14b
[72,73]. All tree topologies were unrooted. For each
model, convergence of the ML estimates was always
checked by running all analyses three times with different
starting ω values. We also used alternatively the CodonFreq = 2 (F3 × 4) or CodonFreq = 3 (F61) to run the analyses. Similar LRTs results were obtained when either
CodonFreq option was used. Given an ω > 1 and a significant LRT under model A, the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB)
approach was used to infer amino acid sites under positive
selection [51]. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses were run on the Espresso Linux cluster at the High Performance Computer Facility of the University of Puerto
Rico (HPCf-UPR).
Test of functional divergence
We estimated the functional divergence among the four
proposed paralog groups (i.e., Basal, MERPs, FishBrain,
and FishTj). The ML protein alignment and topology
showing the relationship among 70 Epd domain-containing proteins were used as input for the program DIVERGE
v1.04 for calculating the coefficient of functional divergence (θ) between pairs of paralog groups [80]. The
parameter θ is a maximum likelihood estimator of type 1
functional divergence between two members of a protein
family and is based on the detection of altered rates of
amino acid replacements for a given position between the
two paralog groups. That is, when an amino acid configuration is very conserved in one of the paralogs and is
highly variable or fast evolving in the other, it implies that
this site-specific rate difference originated because the paralogs experienced different functional constraints at these
residues [54]. A LRT was then done to test the null hypothesis θ = 0 against the alternate hypothesis of θ > 0. If the
estimated θ was significantly greater than zero, functional
divergence between the paralog pair was highly supported. A Bayesian approach was then followed to statistically predict which sites were likely to be responsible for
the type 1 functional differences found between the paralogs [81]. For our analyses, those positions with posterior
probabilities > 0.9 in the site-specific profile for each pairwise comparison were considered to be potential functional divergence-related amino acid sites.
