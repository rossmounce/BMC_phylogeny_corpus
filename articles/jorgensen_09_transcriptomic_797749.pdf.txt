Abstract
Background: The filamentous fungus, Aspergillus niger, responds to nutrient availability by modulating secretion
of various substrate degrading hydrolases. This ability has made it an important organism in industrial production
of secreted glycoproteins. The recent publication of the A. niger genome sequence and availability of microarrays
allow high resolution studies of transcriptional regulation of basal cellular processes, like those of glycoprotein
synthesis and secretion. It is known that the activities of certain secretory pathway enzymes involved Nglycosylation are elevated in response to carbon source induced secretion of the glycoprotein glucoamylase. We
have investigated whether carbon source dependent enhancement of protein secretion can lead to upregulation
of secretory pathway elements extending beyond those involved in N-glycosylation.
Results: This study compares the physiology and transcriptome of A. niger growing at the same specific growth
rate (0.16 h-1) on xylose or maltose in carbon-limited chemostat cultures. Transcription profiles were obtained
using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis of six replicate cultures for each of the two growth-limiting carbon sources.
The production rate of extracellular proteins per gram dry mycelium was about three times higher on maltose
compared to xylose. The defined culture conditions resulted in high reproducibility, discriminating even low-fold
differences in transcription, which is characteristic of genes encoding basal cellular functions. This included
elements in the secretory pathway and central metabolic pathways. Increased protein secretion on maltose was
accompanied by induced transcription of > 90 genes related to protein secretion. The upregulated genes encode
key elements in protein translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), folding, N-glycosylation, quality control,
and vesicle packaging and transport between ER and Golgi. The induction effect of maltose resembles the unfolded
protein response (UPR), which results from ER-stress and has previously been defined by treatment with
chemicals interfering with folding of glycoproteins or by expression of heterologous proteins.
Conclusion: We show that upregulation of secretory pathway genes also occurs in conditions inducing secretion
of endogenous glycoproteins – representing a more normal physiological state. Transcriptional regulation of
protein synthesis and secretory pathway genes may thus reflect a general mechanism for modulation of secretion
capacity in response to the conditional need for extracellular enzymes.

Background
The black-spored mitosporic fungus, Aspergillus niger, is
specialized to grow on plant cell wall- and storagepolysaccharides such as xylans, pectins, starch and inulin
[1,2]. It does so by secreting high levels of a wide range of
substrate degrading enzymes into its habitat. Enzyme
mediated degradation of plant polysaccharides results in
liberation of monomeric carbohydrates, which are efficiently taken up and metabolised by the fungus. The
inherent high enzyme secretion capacity of A. niger and its
high productivity of organic acids, like citric acid, has
made it an interesting organism to study processes such as
protein production and primary metabolism [3,4]. Members of the genus Aspergillus, including A. niger, are also
reputed for biosynthetic potential of a variety of mycotoxins [5], such as the carcinogenic aflatoxins [6,7] and
ochratoxins [8] and, as discovered recently in A. niger, also
the carcinogenic fumonisins [3,9].
In eukaryotic cells, protein secretion involves ER-associated translation, folding and modification of proteins,
which are then transported via vesicles to the Golgi apparatus or other compartments for further modification. The
mature glycoproteins are finally transported with secretory vesicles to the cell membrane and secreted into the
environment. The components and mechanisms of the
secretory pathway in eukaryotes are highly conserved.
Main elements of the secretory pathway in fungi and
mammals are described in recent reviews [10-13]. A
genomic comparison of genes encoding secretory pathway components in A. niger, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
mammals has not revealed major differences in the
number of genes involved in protein secretion and the
analysis did not explain why A. niger is a more efficient
secretor of extracellular proteins than the yeast S. cerevisiae
[3]. However, it has been shown that activity of certain
secretory pathway enzymes involved N-glycosylation is
elevated in response to overexpression of the glycoprotein
glucoamylase in A. niger [14]. There is also a positive correlation between glucoamylase expression and activity of
glycosylation enzymes when comparing growth on maltodextrin, which induces glucoamylase expression, to
growth on xylose, which is a non-inducing carbon source
[14]. These observations suggest that A. niger can adapt
the activity of at least parts of its secretory pathway to handle the increased load of secreted proteins induced by a
given environment. In the present work, we have investigated whether carbon source dependent enhancement of
protein secretion can lead to upregulation of secretory
pathway elements, which extend beyond those involved
in N-glycosylation.
Consequently, we have compared transcriptomic profiles
of A. niger cultures, expressing the endogenous glucoamylase gene, growing on a glucoamylase-inducing carbon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/44

source, maltose, to profiles from cultures growing on
xylose (non-inducing). We have used carbon-limited chemostat cultivation to control the specific growth rate (μ)
during growth on the two different carbon sources and to
obtain highest reproducibility in well defined culture conditions.
We show that the rate of protein secretion is 2–3 times
higher on maltose compared to xylose, and that the
increased protein secretion by A. niger on maltose is
accompanied by upregulation of transcription of more
than 90 genes encoding elements of the secretory pathway. Most of the upregulated secretory pathway elements
reside in the ER or are involved in vesicle trafficking
between ER and Golgi. The transcriptional response to
maltose resembled the unfolded protein response (UPR)
induced by diverse types of artificial ER-stress [15]. We
suggest that the transcriptional regulation of the secretory
pathway is part of a physiological mechanism, which has
evolved to allow varying output of substrate degrading
enzymes.

Results and discussion
Physiology of xylose- or maltose-limited chemostat
cultures of A. niger
Steady state cultures, growing on xylose or maltose, were
homogenous and characterized by dispersed filamentous
hyphae (Fig. 1), and during the whole cultivation only
minimal amount of biomass adhered to surfaces in the
reactor (< 0.5 g dry biomass in the end). Carbon was
accounted for in carbon balances of the influent medium
and effluent culture broth and exhaust gas. The carbonrecoveries were approximately 100% (Table 1), thus validating that μ was equal to the dilution rate (D = 0.16 h-1)
in all 12 steady state cultures. In addition, the relatively
large volume (4.3 l) and steady-state biomass concentration of the cultures allowed sampling of sufficient material for analyses without perturbations of the steady state.

Growth physiology of two A. niger strains was evaluated
from triplicate chemostat cultures. The duration of initial
xylose-grown batch cultures was approximately 21 h, followed by approximately 63 h of continuous cultivation.
After five volume changes (5 × D-1) of xylose-limited
growth, the xylose-containing growth medium was
replaced with a medium containing maltose. Growth was
then followed for another five residence times. As shown
in Fig. 2, the shift of carbon source led to a transient
decrease of the biomass concentration, indicating that the
cells were unable to grow at the same specific growth rate
on maltose during the first hour after the shift. Once the
metabolic machinery necessary for consumption of maltose was induced, growth rate increased and approximately eight hours after the shift the biomass
concentration stabilized at a new steady state value. RNA

for transcriptome analysis was isolated from steady state
cultures on xylose or maltose after at least four residence
times on each carbon source. Growth profiles and sampling events are shown in Fig. 2.
The results listed in Table 1 summarize steady state physiology of xylose- and maltose-limited chemostat cultures.
The reproducibility of the triplicate cultures was very high.
The coefficient of variation (CV) of steady state biomass
concentrations was approximately 0.02 for both carbon
sources. While replicate variability was low, there were
marked differences between cultures grown on xylose or
maltose. Notably, specific productivity of extracellular

protein (qprotein-EC) was 2 to 3 fold higher on maltose than
on xylose, indicating increased protein-secretory activity
of maltose-limited cultures. The biomass yield on carbon
(YxC) was lower on maltose, probably at the expense of
increased product formation. The carbon concentration in
the culture filtrate and the acidification rate of maltoselimited cultures were higher compared to xylose-limited
cultures (results not shown). These observations, taken
together with a respiratory quotient (RQ) lower than 1 of
maltose-limited cultures, most likely reflect higher productivity of organic acids in addition to increased protein
secretion on maltose.

carbon source after 5 RT with xylose as the growth-limiting substrate. Arrows indicate time-points, where mycelium was harvested for transcriptomic analysis.
Reproducibility of steady state gene-expression
Microarray analysis revealed, that less than 50% of the
14,165 predicted open reading frames (ORF) were transcribed on any of the two substrates, xylose or maltose
(raw signal intensities and detection calls for all genes are
given in [Additional file 1]). The high reproducibility of
replicate chemostat cultures was reflected by a very low
degree of replicate variation in transcript levels (Fig. 3).
The average CV of all genes expressed was 0.14–0.15 and
0.17–0.22 in triplicate xylose- and maltose-limited chemostat cultures, respectively. This is fully comparable to the
level of reproducibility reported for genome-wide transcription in chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae [16]. A
closer look at some (14) of the genes with most variable
transcript level on maltose, reveals interesting correlations
(Fig. 3B, D). Five of the genes are involved in metabolism/
degradation of xylose or xylans and had varying transcript
level in replicate cultures. Transcription of xylose-related
genes, in absence of xylose, indicates derepression or
influence of previous growth conditions under xyloselimitation, where all five genes were highly expressed.
However, after 25 h or 4 residence times (RT) of continuous cultivation with maltose, more than 98% of the culture from xylose-limited steady state had been removed
and any residual xylose depleted.

Nine other genes with a CV higher than 1 were all more
expressed in a replicate culture of AB94-85 (culture "#95")
on maltose. These genes are all part of the putative fumonisin gene cluster in A. niger [3]. In total, twelve genes in the
fumonisin gene homolog cluster were expressed on mal-

tose [see Additional file 2]. This appears to correspond to
all homologous genes needed for biosynthesis of fumonisins in Fusarium verticillioides. Recently, Frisvad et al. [9]
reported of fumonisin B2 production by progenitors of
three genome sequenced A. niger strains, including the
source of the strains in this study (A. niger N400). The variable transcription of homologs in a putative mycotoxin
gene cluster demonstrates the need for careful evaluation
of a given strain s mycotoxin-producing ability.
Carbon source dependent gene expression
Analysis of variance (Two-Way ANOVA) identified
approximately 1,250 genes differentially expressed (significance: p < 0.005) in response to the carbon source,
xylose or maltose, and independent of strain background
[see Additional file 3]. Transcription of 57% of these were
higher on maltose compared to xylose in steady state cultures. Most changes in gene expression were characterized
as low-fold differences; for expression of about 890 genes
the difference was less than 2-fold. Low-fold differences (<
2) are often precluded from studies due to limitations set
by sample size and reproducibility. Generally, one would
expect that differences in transcript levels of genes encoding basal functions and elements of basal pathways consisting of many interdependent processes will be small.
Transcription of genes encoding functions specific to one
condition display high-fold differences, as evidenced by
genes involved in conversion of the sole carbon source,
xylose, to the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate,
xylulose-5-phosphate (Table 2), whereas central metabolic processes, also needed in the other condition

(growth on maltose) are characterised by low-fold differences. The latter is exemplified by the low but significant
differences in transcription of genes in the pentose phosphate pathway itself (Table 2). Large differences are also
found when comparing transcript levels of genes encoding extracellular enzymes, expression of which are specifically induced by particular carbon sources (Table 3).
Whereas the basal process of protein secretion is governed
by a multitude of proteins and protein complexes, many
of which are conditionally expressed, but only with small
differences in transcript level (Table 4). A solid context of
identical specific growth rates has allowed us to study
such small, but significant, differences in gene expression

between two similar growth conditions. Andersen et al.
[4] defined, for three Aspergillus species (incl. A. niger), a
conserved transcriptional response to xylose as carbon
source compared to glucose (degradation product of maltose). This list does not include pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) genes, showing that the substrate-effect on
expression of these genes may be specific for A. niger or
simply that it is difficult to observe such effects without
control of the specific growth rate.
Using the FunCat annotation tool [3,17], an overview of
up- or down-regulation of major functional classes during
maltose-limitation (compared to xylose-limitation) is

given in Fig. 4A. "Metabolism (01)" and "Transport facilitation (67)" were represented as two major functional
classes with differentially expressed genes, reflecting need
for uptake and metabolism of two different carbon
sources. The efficient energy-metabolism on xylose, evident from the high biomass yield and high specific oxygen
consumption rate of xylose-limited cultures (Table 1),
may be rooted in enhanced expression of genes encoding
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, xylose conversion
enzymes and the nonoxidative phase of pentose phosphate pathway (Table 2).
In the carbon metabolism category were also genes encoding secreted carbohydrases (Table 3). Highly expressed
genes on maltose include genes encoding the acid amy-

lase (AamA), glucoamylase (GlaA) and the alpha-glucosidase (AgdA), enzymes which have also been identified as
highly induced genes, when grown on maltose in batch
cultures [18]. On maltose, glaA displayed the highest transcript level of all genes. Array signals and Northern blot
analysis indicated that probes for glaA were saturated,
resulting in an underestimation of fold difference [see
Additional file 4]. The list of highly-induced genes on
xylose, contains enzymes involved in xylan degradation.
Induction of xlnD, eglA and aguA by xylose in a XlnRdependent way have been described [19]. High expression
of axlA on xylose supports its proposed function as an
alpha-xylosidase [18]. Strong induction of xynB on xylose
has not been reported before, but its function as an endoxylanase fits well with its expression profile.

Fig. 5(A, B) clearly illustrate the uniform upregulation of
genes in secretory processes on maltose compared to
xylose. Genes in "Protein synthesis (05)" were only upregulated on maltose. Among these are several genes
involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation
and polypeptide elongation (Fig. 5C and [Additional file
6]). Thus, the FunCat overview reveals that upregulation
of genes involved in protein synthesis and secretion on
maltose is a major difference between the two substrates.

Lipid and sterol biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolic
genes also constituted a large group in differentially
expressed metabolic genes [Additional file 5]. Perhaps
most striking in this group, was the 12-fold increase in
transcript level on maltose of a highly expressed and
apparently secreted lipase (An16g01880; FDR = 2.9·10-4).
In general, several genes involved in biosynthesis of ergosterol and phospholipids were upregulated on maltose,
while inositol and choline biosynthesis genes were downregulated. Among these genes, we find a homolog of ino1
(An10g00530), encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase,
a key enzyme in inositol biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. The
differential expression of genes in this category indicate
changes (proliferative and/or compositional) in membrane components or energy storage. Intermediates of
phospholipid and inositol metabolic pathways also play
important roles in cell signalling and global regulatory
pathways [20].
"Protein fate (06)" and "Cellular transport and transport
mechanisms (08)" comprise most genes of the secretory
pathway, and were the second and third largest functional
categories of genes with higher transcript level on maltose
than on xylose (Fig. 4A). "Subcellular localization (40)"
also points to maltose-induced upregulation of the secretory pathway, since many genes are associated with
organelle compartments, like the ER, Golgi, transport vesicles, nuclei and mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Subcategories in

Maltose induces expression of secretory pathway genes
Maltose induces transcription of at least 90 defined secretory pathway genes (Table 4), consistent with higher productivity of extracellular protein and very high expressionlevel of glucoamylase observed in maltose-limited chemostat cultures (Table 1 and 3). We could only identify a
few genes (six) in the secretory pathway, which were
higher expressed on xylose (Table 4). Among the genes
with most significant (FDR ≤ 0.005) higher transcript
level on maltose are those encoding essential subunits of
the Sec61/-63 translocation complex; subunits of the signal peptidase complex; N-glycosylation enzymes like
dolichol-phosphate-mannosyl flippase and most subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex;
important chaperones and foldases (bipA, pdiA and clxA)
with well characterized functions in A. niger [10,21,22];
calnexin (clxA) is involved in folding and quality control
of N-glycosylated proteins together with glucosidase I and
II, which also display some of the most significant upregulation. The transcriptomic profiles support the recent
phylogenetic prediction [18] that An09g05580 encodes
the alpha subunit of glucosidase II; since the significance,
fold difference (maltose/xylose) and expression level of
this ORF is almost identical to the known beta-subunit,
while these variables are quite different in the five other
candidate ORFs given by Pel et al. [3]. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is represented among genes with maltose-induced transcription. ER to Golgi vesicular transport
of glycosylated proteins is upregulated on maltose, shown
by higher transcript levels of genes encoding key COPII
coat proteins and lectin cargo receptor proteins.

Genes involved in retrograde vesicular transport (COPI
coatamers) and recycling of ER proteins are also higher
expressed, and together with upregulation of ER associated degradation (ERAD) of glycoproteins genes, this suggest a general increase in capacity of at least the ER related
processes in the secretory pathway. The functions, upregulated during higher protein secretion on maltose, are
thus mainly localised in the proximal part of the secretory
pathway. Whereas, there was little differential expression
of genes encoding components in the more distal parts of
the secretory pathway, i.e. trans-Golgi, late secretory vesicles and exocytosis, and endocytosis (Table 4).

It has been suggested, that efficient protein secretion in filamentous fungi may be obtained through existence of
alternative secretory pathways [23]. Our study, on the
other hand, suggests that A. niger can adapt the secretory
capacity by transcriptional regulation of central processes
in synthesis, folding and transport of glycoproteins to permit efficient secretion of extracellular proteins, like e.g.
glucoamylase (even at wild type levels of secretion). This
conclusion is consistent with the observation that the
activities of three N-glycosylation enzymes(N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate transferase, dolichol phosphoglucosyl synthase and dolichol phosphomannosyl synthase)
are 2–3 folds higher at growth on maltose-containing
medium (maltodextrin) of a glucoamylase hyper-producing A. niger strain compared to a wild type strain [14]. Furthermore, the hyper-producing strain displays wild type
activity (low) of N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate transferase, when both strains are cultivated on xylose [14],
which is non-inducing for glaA expression. Some notable
analogies to maltose-induction of secretory pathway
genes and glaA expression in A. niger were observed by
Saloheimo et al. [24] in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. They showed that expression of pdi-1 is induced
by cellulose and that this correlates with increased expression of cellulase genes and secretion of their gene-products. In mammals it has been observed that glucose
induces expression of several secretory pathway genes in
pancreatic β-cells [25]. Furthermore, differentiation into a
dedicated secretory cell (e.g. a plasma cell), involves concerted transcriptional upregulation of the secretory pathway via the unfolded protein response (UPR). This
phenomenon has been termed a physiological UPR. It is
mediated by the master regulator of secretion, Xbp1,
which is an ortholog of the Hac1 UPR-regulator in fungi
[26,27]. From the functional classification and subcellular
localization of differentially expressed genes, it is concievable that similar changes take place in the maltose-limited
cultures of A. niger.
Comparison with ER-stress and UPR in fungi
In S. cerevisiae, the UPR effect on gene transcription has
been described for induction with the chemical ER-stressors, DTT and tunicamycin [28], and forced expression of
the active form of the UPR transcription factor, Hac1p
[29]. A common response to ER-stress in yeast and growth
on maltose (this study), is transcriptional upregulation of
genes involved in ER-associated processes, such as translocation, N-glycosylation, ERAD and anterograde vesicle
transport. The present study even adds to the list of ERassociated genes which are upregulated in response to
increased load on the secretory pathway (Table 4). Kitama
et al. [29] reported that the UPR led to down-regulation of
15 genes. Of these, a ferrous iron transporter homolog
(An01g08960) was significantly lower expressed on maltose (fold difference maltose/xylose = 0.07, FDR = 3.7·104).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/44

UPR in S. cerevisiae does not seem to induce transcription
of genes involved in trimming and quality control of glycoproteins or in retrograde vesicular transport of proteins
from Golgi to ER [28,29]. Travers et al. [28] suggested, that
this observation indicates that the UPR in S. cerevisiae
functions to relieve stress – not to mediate a general
increase in secretion capacity. This is in contrast to the
present study, where calnexin, subunits of glucosidase I
and II and several genes involved in retrograde transport
were consistently upregulated during growth on maltose
(Table 4). A common theme of the UPR is also changes in
transcription of lipid and inositol metabolism. Although
growth on maltose led to many significant changes in
transcription of both lipid and inositol pathway genes,
the changes did not resemble those induced by UPR in S.
cerevisiae [28,29]. Transcription of ino1 was upregulated
during constitutive Hac1p-induced UPR [29], while the
homolog (An10g00530) of this gene was down-regulated
in A. niger growing on maltose. However, similar observations of ino1 transcription have been made in S. cerevisiae
strains with secretory pathway defects, which induce the
UPR [30].
A recent extensive study of the UPR in A. niger [15]
defined common transcriptional responses to treatment
with the chemicals, tunicamycin or DTT, and forced secretion of a heterologous protein; conditions, which lead to
accumulation of unfolded proteins and ER-stress. The
three types of ER-stress induced expression of many genes
encoding major functions in the secretory pathway. The
11 genes induced by all three ER-stress conditions [15]
were all higher expressed on maltose in this study. In fact,
of the genes listed in Table 4, 29 are represented in the list
of 34 secretory pathway genes induced by two or all three
of the above mentioned stress conditions. Comparing the
functions encoded by the ER-stress-induced genes to those
with increased expression on maltose, we find that most
of the 29 genes are involved in processes early in the protein secretion pathway. These functions are similar to the
yeast UPR response and encompass subunits of the translocation complex, signal peptidase, N-glycosylation proteins, foldases and chaperones. In addition to the yeast
profiles, calnexin and glucosidase I and II subunits were
also upregulated by ER-stress in A. niger. Interestingly, a
homolog (An11g11250) of the mammalian interferon
induced protein kinase, p58IPK, was significant higher
expressed both on maltose (Table 4) and in two of the
three previously described ER-stress conditions [15]. In
mammals, Xbp1 enhances expression of p58IPK. This has
been suggested as a mechanism to antagonise PERK-mediated repression of global protein synthesis during physiological UPR in secretory cells [26]. A. niger lacks an
obvious homolog of PERK. It consequently seems probable, that the target of the p58IPK-like protein is a homolog
of another mammalian protein kinase, like PKR (in Homo
sapiens) [31]. The protein encoded by the A. niger PKRPage 10 of 16

homolog (An17g00860) has high identity (31% over
1682 residues) to the protein kinase, Gcn2p, in S. cerevisiae. It has been shown in other ascomycete fungi, that
Gcn2p homologs have roles in regulation of global protein synthesis and cell cycle progression [32,33]. It is
tempting to speculate that p58IPK in A. niger can exert derepression of protein synthesis through a homolog of
Gcn2p. In S. cerevisiae, Gcn2p plays additional role as a
positive regulator of translation of the amino acid starvation transcription factor Gcn4p, which apparently regulates transcription of many UPR induced genes [34]. In
our study, CpcA (An01g07900), a homolog of Gcn4p, was
down-regulated on maltose, much in contradiction with
its putative function as positive regulator of transcription
of several UPR target genes in the secretory pathway. The
differential expression of key elements of the UPR, such as
homologs of p58IPK and Gcn4p (CpcA), suggests that
upregulation of the secretory pathway on maltose occurs
via Gcn4p-independent mechanisms.
There were clear differences between the UPR induced by
artificial ER-stressors [15], and the physiological response
to maltose. For example, during artificially induced ERstress, very few genes, encoding ERAD, COPII and especially COPI vesicular transport proteins, were commonly
upregulated. Guillemette et al. [15] also observed changes
in expression of fatty acid and lipid metabolism genes.
One gene (An02g13420) with similarity to an acetylcoenzyme A transporter was consistently upregulated in
all three stress conditions and during growth on maltose;
again indicating relation between lipid metabolism and
the secretory pathway. This similarity is in contrast to the
remaining of the differentially expressed genes in this category; of the seven genes down-regulated by ER-stress we
observed four upregulated on maltose. This included the
on maltose highly-expressed, secreted or organelle-associated, lipase (An16g01880). This gene was upregulated
during ER-stress caused by expression of a heterologous
protein, but not in presence of DTT or tunicamycin [15].
A homolog of erg24, a gene involved in ergosterol biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae, was opposite many other putative
ergosterol biosynthesis genes down-regulated on maltose,
and its transcription was also lower during expression of
the heterologous protein [15]. This shows that although
the ER-stress responses share a core of similarly expressed
functions, expression of other functions are specific to the
nature of the ER-stress.
UPR – part of a differentiation programme in development
of high secretion capacity?
Despite many similarities to the fungal ER-stress
responses defined by treatment with harsh chemicals or
constitutive active expression of the UPR transcription factor, Hac1, or of heterologous proteins, the physiological
state of the fungal cells in our study was very different as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/44

maltose induced overall protein secretion and transcription of highly expressed hydrolases. Notably, differences
in expression of genes in lipid metabolism and in protein
synthesis show clear differences between maltose-induced
transcription of secretory pathway genes and the chemical-induced UPR. This indicates that what looks like a
response to secretion stress, may reflect a more general
mechanism not only to alleviate accumulation of
unfolded proteins in more extreme conditions, but also to
modulate secretion capacity in response to the conditional need for extracellular enzymes. The higher expression level of secretory pathway genes on maltose
resembles physiological UPR as described in mammalian
cells with high secretion activity a feature which could
partly explain why filamentous fungi are efficient enzyme
secretors. However, the HacA transcription factor is an
integral part of the UPR, and simple evaluation of splicing
of HacA mRNA, using RT-PCR [Additional file 7], did not
reveal a difference between growth on maltose or xylose
nor was there any difference in transcription of hacA. This
indicates that the carbon source dependent differential
expression of secretory pathway genes involves additional
factors than HacA.
This investigation not only presents supporting evidence
for a concerted transcriptional regulation of many secretory pathway genes, but also a challenging task with
respect to identification of key regulators. Regulatory elements of basal cellular processes may be involved, as
many genes involved in RNA-processing and basal regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II were differentially expressed [Additional file 8]. One very intriguing
gene (An07g03760) was upregulated on maltose with
same level of significance and fold difference as the most
significant upregulated secretory pathway genes. It
encodes a highly conserved homolog of the P100 EBNA-2
transcriptional co-activator, which is abundantly
expressed in endo-and exocrine tissues in mammals
[35,36]. The homolog of this gene was also higher
expressed in T. reesei during secretion stress [37], indicating that this transcriptonal profile is conserved among filamentous fungi. Despite a high degree of conservation in
all eukaryotic lineages no homolog is found in the yeast S.
cerevisiae. Elements of some cellular functions, like protein secretion, may be more conserved between higher
eukaryotes and filamentous fungi, compared to the in
many ways reduced ascomycete, S. cerevisiae. Consequently, a better understanding of processes and regulation of protein secretion in filamentous fungi may require
comparison to secretory cells of higher eukaryotes.

Conclusion
We provide evidence for carbon source induced, growth
rate independent and concerted transcriptional regulation
of genes encoding proteins in the secretory pathway in A.

niger. We hypothesize that the fungal cell has a principal
mechanism for co-ordinated regulation of basal anabolic
pathways to modulate capacity of the secretory pathway.
The main perspectives of our results are identification of
putative regulatory elements, which coordinate expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and secretion,
and increased understanding of transcriptional regulation
of the secretory pathway in more normal physiological
conditions. We show that an appropriate experimental
approach allows study of subtle changes in expression of
genes involved in important cellular processes. Furthermore, studies of lower eukaryotes, like A. niger, can be
used to study functions and processes which are conserved in higher eukaryotes, with advantages in ease of
propagation and ability to control growth and environmental variables.

Methods
Strains and inoculum
Aspergillus niger AB94-85 [38] and ABGT1026 [39] were
cultivated in triplicate xylose- and maltose-limited chemostat cultures. Both strains are derived from N400 (=
NRRL3, ATCC9029, CBS120.49).

Conidia for inoculation of bioreactor cultures were harvested from solidified Complete Medium (CM), which
contained (per liter): 6.0 g NaNO3, 1.5 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g
KCl, 0.5 g Mg SO4·7H2O, 1.0 g casamino acids, 5.0 g yeast
extract, 20 g agar and 1 ml trace metal solution. The trace
metal solution contained per liter, 10 g EDTA, 4.4 g
ZnSO4·7H2O, 1.01 g MnCl2·4H2O, 0.32 g CoCl2·6H2O,
0.315 g CuSO4·5H2O, 0.22 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O,
1.47 g CaCl2·2H2O and 1 g FeSO4·7H2O (modified from
composition given by Vishniac and Santer [40]). pH of
CM was adjusted to 5.8 with NaOH and autoclaved. The
major carbon source, xylose, was autoclaved separately
and added to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v).
Conidia from a -80°C stock culture were spread over
moist sterile filter paper discs, which were placed on CM
plates. Filter paper discs facilitate spore harvest and
increase yield of conidia. The solid medium cultures were
incubated for three days at 30°C and then for five to seven
days at 25°C to enhance conidiation. Spore plates were
stored for no more than six months at 4°C. Conidia were
harvested from filter paper discs with a sterile detergent
solution containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 and 0.9% (w/
v) NaCl.
Continuous cultivation
Carbon-limited chemostat cultures were performed in a
Variomixing Bioreactor [41]. This bioreactor was designed
especially for cultivation of filamentous microorganisms,
which have a tendency to adhere to and grow on surfaces.
The Variomixing Bioreactor possesses a number of features, which reduce biomass adhesion and wall growth,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/44

and thus maintains high culture homogeneity during prolonged cultivation of filamentous fungi. A more detailed
description of the Variomixing Bioreactor and associated
equipment used for continuous cultivation is available
elsewhere [41,42]. The medium for batch and continuous
cultivation was Minimal Medium and contained per liter:
4.5 g NH4Cl, 1.5 g KH2PO4, 0.5 KCl, 0.5 MgSO4·7H2O
and 1 ml trace metal solution. 0.01% polypropyleneglycol (PPG 2000, Fluka Chemika) was added to the medium
used for continuous cultivation as antifoam agent. The
final cell density limiting (growth-limiting) substrate was
7.5 g xylose or maltose (monohydrate) per liter. Carbon
sources were heat sterilized separately from the Minimal
Medium. During cultivation, temperature was set at 30°C
and at pH 3, and kept constant by computer controlled
addition of 2 M NaOH. Acidification of the culture broth
was used as an indirect measure for growth [43]. Dissolved oxygen tension was always above 40% of air saturation.
Batch cultivation was initiated with inoculation of 4.3
liter minimal medium with 109 conidia liter-1. Germination was induced by addition of 0.003% (w/w) yeast
extract. During the first six hours of cultivation the culture
was aerated (air flow = 1 l min-1) through the headspace
of the reactor and stirrer speed kept low at 450 rpm to
avoid exhaust of the hydrophobic conidia. After six hours
and germination of most conidia (now hydrophilic), air
was sparged into the culture broth, mixing was intensified
(750 rpm) for more efficient oxygen transfer and 0.01%
(v/v) PPG was added.
Xylose was the growth-limiting substrate in the batch culture and during the first five residence times of chemostat
cultivation. Continuous cultivation was started after 80
mmol of NaOH had been added to the batch culture
(80% of the xylose exhausted or appr. 3.5 g dry weight
biomass formed per kg culture). The dilution rate (D) was
set to 0.16 h-1, which corresponds to 80% and 60% of the
maximum specific growth rate (μmax) on xylose (≈ 0.20 h1) and maltose (≈ 0.25 h-1), respectively. After five residence times (≈ 32 h), the xylose-containing influent
medium was replaced with maltose-containing medium.
Continuous cultivation was performed for additional five
residence times on maltose. Steady-state, a situation
where the specific growth rate (μ) is equal to the dilution
rate (D), was defined by constant alkali addition rate and
constant CO2, O2, biomass and substrate concentrations
after four residence times.
Samples were drawn regularly to monitor culture growth
and for determination of steady-state. A special sampling
device was used to sample up to 100 ml culture broth in
less than a second. The technical principle of the sampling
device was previously described [44]. All samples were

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:44

quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Culture filtrate used in
substrate and protein determinations was obtained by
rapid filtration of culture broth through cotton wool
before freezing. 10 mM NaN3 was used to conserve samples for determination of organic carbon. Mycelium harvested during steady-state was used in gene expression
studies. Mycelium was separated from culture broth by filtration through sintered glass and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 15 sec after sampling.
Determination of substrate and biomass concentration
Xylose was determined by the modified orcinol reaction
described by Standing et al. [45]. Residual maltose and
glucose (degradation product) was determined enzymatically as glucose, after incubation of culture filtrate with
added a-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) [46]. Glucose was
determined according to the method of Bergmeyer et al.
[47] with a slight modification; 250 mM triethanolamine
(TEA) was used as buffer (pH 7.5). Dry weight biomass
concentration was determined by weighing freeze dried
mycelium separated from a known mass of culture broth.
Culture broth was filtered through GF/C glass microfibre
filter (Whatman).
Carbon recovery
Influent carbon (continuous culture) was accounted for
by carbon-analysis of effluent culture broth (biomass and
filtrate) and measurement of CO2 in exhaust gas. Biomass
carbon was determined according to the method of Kristensen and Andersen [48]. The gas composition of dry
mycelium oxidized at 1020°C was determined by gas
chromatography with a Carlo Erba 1100EA Elemental
Analyzer using acetanilide as standard. Organic carbon in
culture filtrate was determined with a TOC-5000 Total
Organic Carbon Analyzer (Shimadzu). Malonic acid was
used as standard and samples diluted with Millipore
water. Content of CO2 and O2 was measured in exhaust
gas of the bioreactor with a Binos 100 M gas analyzer
(Rosemount Analyticals).
Protein determination
Bio-Rad Protein Assay (microassay procedure) was used
to determine extracellular protein concentration in culture filtrate. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard.
RNA isolation and quality control
Total RNA was isolated by modified Trizol extraction. Frozen ground mycelium (≈ 100 mg) was directly suspended
in 500 μL Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and vortexed vigorously for 5–10 min. After centrifugation for 5 min at
13,000 rpm, 450 μL of the supernatant was transferred to
a new tube. Chloroform (90 μL) was added and extraction
continued as recommended in the Trizol protocol. RNA
was purified on NucleoSpin RNA II columns (MacheryNagel), including a DNaseI digestion step. RNA was
eluted in 60 μL miliQ water. RNA quantity and quality

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/44

was determined on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and
integrity was tested on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser.
Micro-array analysis
Probe synthesis and fragmentation were performed at
ServiceXS (Leiden, The Netherlands) according to Affymetrix protocol [49]. DSM (Delft, The Netherlands) proprietary A. niger genechips were hybridised, washed, stained
and scanned according to Affymetrix protocol [49]. The 3'
to 5' signal ratio of probe sets of internal control genes,
like gpdA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase),
pkiA (pyruvatekinase), hxk (hexokinase) and γ-actin, were
below 3 on all arrays (12 arrays). Percentage of probe sets
evaluated as present (%P of 14,555 probe sets) was 41 on
xylose (6 arrays) and 39 on maltose (6 arrays).
Normalization, filtering, statistical significance and
comparisons
Handling of microarray results and statistical comparisons were performed with GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics,
2004) software. Genes with detection call Present or Marginal in at least one of three replicate measurements were
accepted as expressed and used in further analyses. Raw
signal values were normalized Per-chip to 50th percentile
and Per-gene to median prior to comparison of conditions. Four experimental conditions were compared (maltose- and xylose-limited chemostat cultures of two
strains); each condition represented by independent triplicate measurements. Replicate variation of transcript levels was characterized as CV of 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th
percentiles (P) of expressed genes with least variable signal intensities. Xylose-limited cultures (AB94-85/
ABGT1026): P25 = 0.08/0.07, P50 = 0.12/0.12, P75 =
0.19/0.18 and P90 = 0.28/0.27. In maltose-limited cultures the corresponding values were 0.13/0.10, 0.19/0.15,
0.27/0.22 and 0.37/0.31. Genes expressed differentially
on carbon source were identified by 2-way ANOVA (variances were not assumed equal) with a cut-off p-value of
0.005. Benjamini Hochberg False Discovery Rate [50],
FDR, was < 0.05 for genes identified as differentially
expressed. Fold change of gene expression from xylose to
maltose (maltose/xylose) was calculated for genes with
significantly different expression on the two carbon
sources.
