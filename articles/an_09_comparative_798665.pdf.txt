Abstract
Background: Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are Gram-negative, phylogenetically related, enterobacteria, forming
mutualism with the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively. The mutualistic bacteria
living in the intestines of the nematode infective juveniles are pathogenic to the insect upon release by the nematodes
into the insect hemolymph. Such a switch needs activation of genes that promote bacterial virulence. We studied in vivo
gene expression in Photorhabdus temperata and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi upon infection of the white grub Rhizotrogus
majalis using selective capture of transcribed sequences technique.
Results: A total of 40 genes in P. temperata and 39 in X. koppenhoeferi were found to be upregulated in R. majalis
hemolymph at 24 h post infection. Genomic presence or upregulation of these genes specific in either one of the
bacterium was confirmed by the assay of comparative hybridization, and the changes of randomly selected genes were
further validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The identified genes could be broadly divided into seven functional
groups including cell surface structure, regulation, virulence and secretion, stress response, intracellular metabolism,
nutrient scavenging, and unknown. The two bacteria shared more genes in stress response category than any other
functional group. More than 60% of the identified genes were uniquely induced in either bacterium suggesting vastly
different molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity to the same insect host. In P. temperata lysR gene encoding
transcriptional activator was induced, while genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were induced in X.
koppenhoeferi. Lipopolysaccharide synthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata. Except tcaC
and hemolysin related genes, other virulence genes were different between the two bacteria. Genes involved in TCA cycle
were induced in P. temperata whereas those involved in glyoxylate pathway were induced in X. koppenhoeferi, suggesting
differences in metabolism between the two bacteria in the same insect host. Upregulation of genes encoding different
types of nutrient uptake systems further emphasized the differences in nutritional requirements of the two bacteria in
the same insect host. Photorhabdus temperata displayed upregulation of genes encoding siderophore-dependent iron
uptake system, but X. koppenhoeferi upregulated genes encoding siderophore-independent ion uptake system.
Photorhabdus temperata induced genes for amino acid acquisition but X. koppenhoeferi upregulated malF gene, encoding a
maltose uptake system. Further analyses identified possible mechanistic associations between the identified gene
products in metabolic pathways, providing an interactive model of pathogenesis for each bacterium species.
Conclusion: This study identifies set of genes induced in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi upon infection of R. majalis,
and highlights differences in molecular features used by these two closely related bacteria to promote their pathogenicity
in the same insect host.

Background
Entomopathogenic Gram-negative enterobacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus form symbioses with the entomopathogenic
nematodes
Heterorhabditis
and
Steinernema, respectively [1]. These bacteria not only have
similar biology but are also phylogenetically related based
on 16s rDNA sequence identities [2]. They naturally colonize intestines of the nematode infective juveniles which
invade susceptible insects to release the bacteria into the
hemolymph. The bacteria multiply in the hemolymph,
killing the insect host within 24-48 h and converting the
cadaver into a food source suitable for nematode growth
and reproduction. After 1-3 rounds of nematode reproduction, the bacteria recolonize the emerging infective
juveniles ensuring their transmission to a new host [1].
Available evidence suggests that Photorhabdus and
Xenorhabdus encode specific factors to engage in a pathogenic relationship with the insect host [3]. The published
genome sequence of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 strain
indicates that virulence genes are encoded within a
number of pathogenicity islands located on the bacterial
chromosome [4,5]. Besides producing toxins to cause
insect death, Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus have to first
evade the insect's immune response to establish a successful infection. The two bacteria differ in mechanisms by
which they evade host immune responses. For example, in
Photorhabdus, mutational inactivation of phoP gene results
in increased sensitivity to insect immune response and
decreased virulence towards insects [6,7], while in X.
nematophila, phoPQ mutants are more susceptible to
immune response but are fully virulent [3]. P. luminescens
produces a signaling molecule AI-2 to resist reactive oxygen species [8] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to
inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [9], but the strategy used by
X. nematophila appears to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [10-12]. In
addition, P. luminescens encodes a type III secretion system
and one of the effectors, LopT, suppresses phagocytosis
and reduces nodulation by haemocytes [13,14]. However,
the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do
not show homologues of LopT or a dedicated type III
secretion system [3], and Xenorhabdus likely uses flagellar
regulatory cascade to control cellular immunity [15].
Despite the identification of the above regulatory and virulence factors from Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, the full
profiles of genes expressed during insect infection by these
two closely related bacteria are unknown. Münch et al.
[16] identified 29 promoters induced by P. luminescens in
the presence of isolated Galleria mellonella homogenate
using a differential fluorescence induction approach.
However, treatment with insect homogenate might
neglect physicochemical parameters as inducers which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

could result in different sets of genes being upregulated
during natural infection of live insects. We used selective
capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) technique to
study in vivo gene expression in Photorhabdus temperata
(associated with the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora GPS11) and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi (associated
with the nematode Steinernema scarabaei AMK001) during
infection of the same insect host Rhizotrogus majalis. They
were selected according to their distinct pathogenicity in
insects of the family of Scarabaeidae - S. scarabaei is more
virulent to R. majalis than H. bacteriophora. However,
unlike their nematode partners, both bacterial species are
highly virulent to Rhizotrogus majalis. In addition,
although X. koppenhoeferi grows slower than P. temperata
both in vitro and in vivo, the LD50 and LT50 value do not
differ between these two bacteria [17]. We hypothesize
that the two bacteria species will use both common and
distinct molecular mechanisms during infection of the
same insect host.

Results
Isolation of bacterial transcripts induced in Rhizotrogus
majalis
To isolate bacterial genes induced upon infection, total
RNA was isolated from live grubs at 24 h post injection
with P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi, as well as from 48 h
log-phase bacterial cultures grown in Brain Heart Infusion
(BHI) broth that were used to inject R. majalis. Randomprimed bacterial cDNAs were normalized by hybridization to biotinylated bacterial genomic DNA that had been
blocked beforehand using bacterial ribosomal RNA
operon, resulting in sampling of bacterial mRNA transcripts apart from its ribosomal and insect transcripts. The
normalized bacterial cDNAs representing total mRNA
transcripts produced by bacteria grown in vitro or within
the infected insects were named as normalized in vitro and
in vivo cDNA libraries, respectively. To isolate bacterial
mRNA transcripts preferentially induced during infection
of the insect compared to the culture, normalized in vivo
cDNAs were enriched by hybridization to biotinylated
bacterial genomic DNA that had been pre-hybridized with
rRNA operon and in vitro normalized cDNAs. The
enriched cDNAs representing in vivo-induced genes,
which were either lower in abundance or absent in 48 h in
vitro bacterial cultures were then cloned into a TA cloning
vector to construct in vivo enriched cDNA libraries. A total
of 384 clones (192 for each bacterium) derived from
enriched cDNA libraries were randomly picked for screening. Out of these, the clones (150 for P. temperata and 140
for X. koppenhoeferi) that showed stronger signal upon
hybridization with in vivo-derived cDNAs compared to in
vitro-derived cDNAs (Fig. 1) were sequenced and analyzed
using the non-redundant algorithms of BLAST in NCBI
and database of Xenorhabdus Genomes. These sequenced
clones were therefore considered to represent reliable

loaded with the same amplicon of each individual clone from the enriched cDNA library, and the concentration of probes was

transcripts specifically expressed in P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi after 24 h infection of R. majalis.
Analysis of bacterial genes induced in Rhizotrogus majalis
Most identified transcripts were either similar to
sequences from P. luminescens or X. nematophila, suggesting that bacterial transcripts were successfully enriched
from the infected insects. For both bacteria, each isolated
transcript was identified at least twice from the sequenced
clones. The coverage of in vivo enriched libraries was then
evaluated using Analytic Rarefaction according to the
redundancy of each identical transcript in the sequenced
clones. As indicated by the rarefaction curves (Fig. 2), saturation was achieved for the sequenced clones, indicating
that most of representative genes in the in vivo enriched
cDNA libraries were identified. Totally, we isolated 40 different sequences from P. temperata (Table 1) and 39 from
X. koppenhoeferi (Table 2). Based on homology searches,
the genes corresponding to distinct sequences could be
divided into seven functional groups: cell surface structure
(Class I), intracellular metabolism (Class II), nutrient
scavenging (Class III), regulation (Class IV), stress
response (Class V), virulence (Class VI) and uncharacterized genes (Class VII). Genes involved in metabolism constitute about 25% to 33% of the total number of in vivoinduced genes (Fig. 3), showing large numbers of metabolic changes during insect infection. Semi-quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR performed on 10 randomly
selected identified genes (five from P. temperata: cysK, fliA,
lysR, pchC and pmt1 and five from X. koppenhoeferi: aceE,
dacC, cobJ, malF, and yijC) showed that these genes were
detectable from the in vivo-derived cDNA but not from in

population before normalization, but not after normalization, suggesting that bacterial cDNAs were successfully
purified from the insect cDNAs after SCOTS normalization. Also gyrase A gene, a prokaryotic housekeeping gene,
was not detected from the enriched in vivo cDNAs, but was
detected in all other cDNA populations including in vitro
and in vivo cDNAs before and after normalization, indicating that only differentially expressed genes were captured
after enrichment.

Identification of Photorhabdus temperata or Xenorhabdus
koppenhoeferi specific genes
To identify genes that were distinctive in P. temperata or X.
koppenhoeferi genome or exclusively induced in one or the
other bacterium, comparative hybridization was performed based upon the identified genes. Twenty nine of
the 40 distinct P. temperata transcripts have similar
sequences in X. koppenhoeferi genome, thus 11 were P. temperata specific; 30 of the 39 distinct X. koppenhoeferi transcripts share sequence similarity with P. temperata
genome, thus 9 were specific to X. koppenhoeferi (Tables 1

and 2). Although these 59 transcripts (29 + 30) corresponding to genes present in the genome of both bacteria,
21 from P. temperata and 22 from X. koppenhoeferi were
identified to be exclusively induced in each of them. Only
a small number of transcripts were induced in both bacteria, and most of them corresponded to genes required for
stress response. Further, the level of changes in the tran-

scripts exclusively induced in one or the other bacterium
during infection of R. majalis was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on following representative
genes: cysK, def, dnaB, lysR, pchC, pckA, phoP, ptst1, sctL,

the SCOTS assay. Most tested genes displayed 6-16 fold
induction in qRT-PCR assays, and a few genes including
sctL, phoP, rtxC and clpP exhibited about 3-fold induction
(Fig. 4).
Analysis of biological associations of in vivo-induced genes
To understand the function and interactions of the identified gene products, interactive networks were built to provide an overview of how gene products relate to each
other by leveraging databases of published literature.
Using PathwayStudio (Ariadne, Rockville, MD, USA) program, we were able to distill all published information
about biological relationships of bacterial homologs of
the identified genes. Molecular interactions linking each
identified gene product in terms of binding, direct molecular regulation, effects on expression, transportation, and
molecule synthesis were elucidated in PathwayStudio.
Based on this analysis, the biological significance of each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

gene was inferred. Linkage between proteins shows how
upregulated genes may influence other genes or gene
products. For example, gene rpoB, induced in both bacteria, interacts with many gene products, suggesting its overall importance during insect infection (see Additional files
1 and 2). Other identified genes with multiple connections to different gene products were different between P.
temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, indicating distinct biological processes used by the two bacteria for insect infection.
Moreover, linkages with small molecules indicate how
normal functions in gene regulation networks are influenced by small molecules that may be available in the
insect body. For example, regulation of genes yncB and
purH in P. temperata are influenced by aromatic compounds and formate, respectively (see Additional file 1).
In X. koppenhoeferi, gene trxB is influenced by arabinose
and selenium, and gene znuA is influenced by etoposide
(see Additional file 2). Compared to the biological interactions (see Additional files 1 and 2), molecular pathways
or networks in which identified genes link to each other
were further illustrated (see Additional file 3). In total, 20
genes from P. temperata and 18 from X. koppenhoeferi (see
Additional file 3) were found to be part of the dense protein interaction networks, indicating that these genes may
act in concert to achieve successful infection. Some products encoded by induced genes were found to interact
with as many as eight other gene products in the network.
For example, P. temperata pckA and X. koppenhoeferi aceE
both influence 8 other genes in the network (see Additional file 3). As a whole, the protein networks of the identified genes were different for the two bacteria except that
NAD synthetase gene nadE was found to be common to
both bacteria.

Discussion
Our gene expression data reveal similarities and differences in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity by the
two bacteria with apparently similar biology. As depicted
in the conceptual molecular model (Fig. 5), apart from a
relatively small number of common strategies used by P.
temperata and X. koppenhoeferi to cause infection of R.
majalis, most upregulated genes were different between
the two bacteria, suggesting vastly different pathways to
bring about infection of the same insect host.

Genes involved in cell structure modification
As the physical contact between bacteria and their host is
accomplished by the outer surface, the bacterial cell envelope is crucial for communication and interaction with
host cells during infection. Genes involved in the synthesis of outer membrane proteins (skp in P. temperata and
ompF in X. koppenhoeferi) and flagella (fliA in P. temperata
and fliM in X. koppenhoeferi) were induced in both bacteria, indicating the importance of surface proteins in this
bacteria-insect interface. Outer membrane proteins may

functions. The detailed possible functions for individual gene products are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

contribute to the modulation of bacterial cell surface
properties during interaction with the host, thus playing a
role in evading host immune response [18]. Flagellummediated motility may provide an advantage for infection
by attachment to the host surface [19,20], whereas it has
been reported in X. nematophila that the expression of virulence factors is not controlled by the regulation of flagella motility [21]. Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan
synthesis enzyme D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase
was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata,
implying that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that probably add to its fitness
when residing in the host. As a well-defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia
[22], lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was
induced in X. koppenhoeferi, but not in P. temperata, which
may explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did not differ from P. temperata in virulence to
R. majalis in our previous studies [17].
Genes involved in regulatory networks
Facing stimuli, different regulatory genes were upregulated in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, reflecting their
unique ability to respond to environmental challenges.
phoP and cpxR genes identified from P. temperata, encode
response regulators in two-component regulatory systems
PhoPQ and CpxRA, respectively [23,24]. PhoP and CpxR
are dual transcriptional regulators that are activated in
response to environmental stimuli and then act to modulate activity of other genes [23,24]. Responding to low
Mg2+ levels, phoP expression is auto-regulated by PhoP
and PhoQ proteins and phoQ is constitutive [25]. Autoregulation of phoP likely regulates expression of other
genes that mediate various cellular functions such as LPS
modification, cell structure [26], and type III secretion systems [27]. phoP has been previously identified to be
involved in virulence as mutational inactivation of this
gene rendered P. luminescens avirulent to Spodoptera littoralis larvae [6]. Similarly, the regulatory protein CpxR can be
activated in response to signals associated with growth
and metabolic pathways [28]. By sensing cell envelope
stress CpxR appears to control expression of other genes
involved in envelope stress response, secretion, motility
and multidrug resistance [29]. Sometimes, CpxR acts to
modulate other transcriptional factors [30]. Although
there is no evidence showing links between phoP/cpxR and
other isolated genes, overexpression of these two response
regulator genes may possibly relate to genes involved in
stress responses (gshB, gor, msrA and surA), cell structure
(skp, dacC and ompF) and type III secretion systems (sctL)
identified in this study. Further, in P. temperata, lysR gene
encoding a transcriptional activator protein was found to
be upregulated during infection of R. majalis, while two
genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors
were identified in X. koppenhoeferi. The pathway network

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

analysis indicates that the product of yijC may function as
a repressor to potentially control the expression of the
fabB gene, which in turn, modulates the physical properties of the membrane by altering the level of unsaturated
fatty acid production. Besides transcriptional regulatory
genes, gene tilS, encoding a putative cell cycle protein [4],
was induced in X. koppenhoeferi. Upregulation of distinct
regulatory genes in these two bacteria indicates the different stress response mechanisms between the bacterial species in the same host. However, none of these regulatory
factors were identified in P. luminescens exposed to G. mellonella homogenate in a previous study [16], suggesting
that regulation of these factors either depends on host (R.
majalis not G. mellonella) or bacteria themselves.
Genes involved in virulence and secretion
Identification of genes encoding hemolysin related proteins in P. temperata (fhaC) and X. koppenhoeferi (xhlA)
may suggest their role in dealing with the insect cellular
immune response and iron scavenge [31,32]. Subsequently, bacterial virulence factors actively contribute to a
successful infection by colonization of and toxicity
towards the insect host. Among the virulence genes identified in this study, tcaC was identified to be induced in
both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of
R. majalis. The tca gene family encodes four toxin complexes TcaA, TcaB, TcaC and TcaD [33], and has been
found in several bacterial pathogens including P. luminescens, Yersinia and Xenorhabdus [34]. Interestingly, Tca
toxin encoding genes were also found to be induced in a
related species P. luminescens treated with the homogenate
of G. mellonella [16]. This leads us to speculate that TcaC
serves as either an activator or a chaperone in secretion of
toxin complex from the cell as proposed by ffrench-Constant et al. [35] and Waterfield et al. [36]. Induction of
gene pplA, encoding a phospholipase, in P. temperata is
expected to contribute to its faster growth rate [37] compared to X. koppenhoeferi in R. majalis. Further, genes
encoding components of different types of secretion
machineries were isolated in this study. Upregulation of
gene sctL, encoding components of type III secretion
machinery, possibly coordinates protein secretion system
in P. temperata for translocating effector molecules across
the bacterial cell envelope into host cells [38-40]. Unlike
Photorhabdus, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X.
nematophila do not encode homologues of a dedicated
type III secretion system [3], indicating that Xenorhabdus
likely uses different effectors or secretion systems. Notably, in X. koppenhoeferi, virH with sequence similarity to a
gene encoding putative toxin secretion transporter in
Vibrio cholera, was upregulated during infection of R. majalis. In addition, several other genes encoding proteins with
putative virulence functions identified in this study may
represent novel toxin candidates involved in insect infection. These include pmt1, toxC and virB from P. temperata,

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:433

and virH from X. koppenhoeferi. Differences in expression
of virulence and secretion related genes imply the differential virulence mechanisms employed by the two bacteria.
Genes involved in adaptation to host-induced stresses
Compared to all other functional classes, more stress
response genes were identified to be shared by P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, suggesting common themes in
adaptation to host-imposed stresses. Upregulation of
both surA and uspB in both bacteria indicates their importance in bacterial adaptation to global stress during insect
infection. Gene surA is important for bacterial survival
during infection [41,42] to avoid accumulation of nonnative protein conformations [42-44], and uspB gene
product is usually accumulated in the stationary phase
and probably important for ethanol stress [45]. Similarly,
induction of a chaperone protein encoding gene dnaK in
both bacteria may picture common stress responses
between P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi in a number of
cellular processes including rescue of misfolded proteins
and control of the activity of folded regulatory proteins
[46]. The glutathione synthetase gene gshB which mediates condensation of gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione [47,48] was induced in P.
temperata, but glutathione reductase gene gor which
reduces glutathione disulfide to the sulfhydryl form of
glutathione [47,48] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi. Glutathione plays a major role in protection against oxidative
stress and in detoxification of hazardous chemicals or
heavy metals [49]. Thus, although gshB and gor corresponding products are involved in different glutathione
biosynthesis pathways, expression of these two genes may
suggests possible role of detoxification mechanism in P.
temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis. Further, as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria can
switch their phenotypes upon insect infection, we speculate that upregulation of transposase genes in both bacteria may contribute to genetic variability for better
adaptation and survival in a particular niche [50]. Apart
from the common mechanisms handling stresses, gene
msrA encoding a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase
was unique to X. koppenhoeferi. As an important antioxidant enzyme, peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase
mediates the repair of proteins damaged by sulfoxidation
of methionine residues [51,52]. Products of msrA are
found to interact with several other gene products (see
Additional file 2), also suggesting its importance during
insect infection.
Genes involved in intracellular metabolism
Induction of different metabolism genes in Photorhabdus
and Xenorhabdus during insect infection highlights the differences in metabolic changes between the two bacteria.
Three genes, aceE, aceK and dld, whose products catalyze

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

subsequent steps of the glyoxylate pathway [53], were
induced in X. koppenhoeferi. In contrast, two genes kdgK
and pckA involved in energy metabolism in the TCA cycle
were upregulated in P. temperata [54,55]. Genes related to
the TCA cycle have been also found to be induced in other
bacteria upon host infection, for example in P. luminescens
in the presence of G. mellonella homogenate [16] and in
Vibrio cholerae upon infection of infant mice [56,57]. Further, as a cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and leucine, biotin plays a role in TCA cycle by assisting in
metabolic reactions and helping to transfer carbon dioxide [58]. Therefore, upregulation of bioB encoding a biontin synthetase protein further suggests that TCA cycle is
involved in P. temperata. Induction of different amino acid
biosynthetic genes may suggest the differences in amino
acid requirements in the two bacteria during infection.
Induction of cysK gene in P. temperata suggests that
cysteine may be required when growing in the insect, but
lysine may be needed for X. koppenhoeferi as lysC gene was
induced. Isolation of P. temperata def, encoding an amino
acid tRNA synthesis enzyme N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase, may reflect the importance of specific amino acids involved in the translation process
during growth in the insect host. Indeed, the pathway
analysis reveals that def gene product interacts with CysS,
a cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (see Additional file 1), also
suggesting the requirement for cysteine in P. temperata
during infection. Genes involved in protein synthesis and
degradation can also be distinguished between the two
bacteria. A protease gene, clpP, involved in protein degradation, was induced in X. koppenhoeferi upon infection. In
fact proteases have been identified as virulence factors in
some other bacterial pathogens [59]. The signal peptidase
II encoded by lspA gene induced in P. temperata belongs to
a class of aspartyl proteases. Since the product of lspA has
been suggested as an important virulence factor operating
via maturation of several lipoproteins [60], we postulate
that the product of lspA may play a pathological role in P.
temperata by cleaving some core proteins and thus influencing bacterial life cycle in the insect host.
Genes involved in nutrient scavenging
Induction of different types of nutrient uptake systems in
Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus further emphasized the
possible differences in nutritional requirements of the
two bacteria in the insect host. Ion scavenging systems
induced in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi are completely different. In P. temperata, pchC, a gene involved in
the biogenesis of pyochelin type of siderophore [61], was
upregulated indicating the importance of iron, whereas a
siderophore-independent zinc ion transport system
encoded by gene znuA [62] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi indicating the importance of zinc. Also supported
by the pathway analysis, product of glnD identified from
P. temperata likely controls the production of siderophore

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:433

(see Additional file 1). In addition to ion scavenging systems, artM, encoding a putative ABC amino acid transport
system [63] was identified in P. temperata, but not in X.
koppenhoeferi. Besides transporting L-arginine across the
inner membrane [63], the pathway network reveals that
the product of artM participates in cystine transport (see
Additional file 1), suggesting that this gene may also
mediate cystine amino acid acquisition. Upregulation of
artM in P. temperata also suggests that amino acids may be
available for uptake in the insect. Similarly, it has been
discussed previously that histidine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the possible components presented in the
insect host hemolymph, may be important food sources
used by P. luminescens for growth within the insect host
[64]. As cysteine synthesis gene cysK was also identified
from P. temperata as discussed above, it may indicate that
the level of cysteine either synthesized by P. temperata or
acquired from the insect host is not sufficient during
infection. Interestingly, X. koppenhoeferi seems to require
sugar as malF gene which is involved in uptake for maltose
and lactose was upregulated. Further, P. temperata but not
X. koppenhoeferi induced tolB gene that encodes a Tol protein upon insect infection. As a periplasmic protein, TolB
is an extra member in the Tol system. In E. coli, Tol system
stabilizes the outer membrane structure and mutations in
Tol encoding genes result in hypersensitivity to deleterious agents [65]. Despite unknown mechanistic details of
Tol system, upregulation of P. temperata tolB gene suggests
that it may be involved in importing biomolecules by
somehow supplying energy or transport as noted by
Nikaido [66] in other bacteria.
Genes with unknown function
Ten genes encoding products with unknown functions
were identified to be upregulated in both bacteria during
infection of R. majalis. These include two P. temperata and
three X. koppenhoeferi genes which show sequence similarity to genes encoding hypothetical proteins with
unknown functions, and two P. temperata and three X.
koppenhoeferi sequences that exhibit no similarity to any
gene or gene product in current databases. These
unknown genes may represent novel pathogenicity factors
used by bacteria during insect infection and thus require
further investigation.

Conclusion
This research indicates that selective capture of transcribed
sequences (SCOTS) is a powerful technique to study in
vivo gene expression in bacterial pathogens of insects.
Results reveal that phylogenetically related bacteria with
similar biology differ dramatically in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity in the same host. Photorhabdus and
Xenorhabdus bacteria appear to share more genes in hostinduced stress protection category, including tolerance
against universal stresses, glutathione-mediated protec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

tion against oxidative stress, and protection against
nucleic acid damage, compared to genes in all other categories. While genes encoding TcaC toxin and hemolysin
related proteins were identified to be induced in both P.
temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, the two bacteria seem to
use different regulatory genes, secretion systems and virulence factors to achieve infection of the same insect host
R. majalis. Further, P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi displayed different metabolic adaptations in the same insect
host as reflected by the high proportion of identified
genes involved in metabolism. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the evolution of bacterial
pathogenesis and provides molecular targets for genetic
manipulation of these economically important nematode
symbiotic insect pathogens.

Methods
Bacteria, insects, and culture conditions
The symbiotic bacteria P. temperata strain GPS11 [17] and
X. koppenhoeferi strain USNJ01 [67] were isolated from
nematodes H. bacteriophora strain GPS11 [68] and S. scarabaei strain AMK001 [69], respectively. The H. bacteriophora
GPS11 were obtained from our liquid nitrogen frozen
stock, and of S. scarabaei AMK001 were obtained from Dr.
Albrecht M. Koppenhöfer (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey). The bacteria were cultured in BHI broth
at 25°C unless otherwise stated. The second instar larvae
of the white grub R. majalis were collected from Sunleaf
Nursery (Madison, Ohio). The field collected insect larvae
were kept at room temperature for 10 days, and only
healthy, actively moving larvae were used in all experiments.
General techniques
Bacterial genomic DNA was prepared using standard
method for Gram negative bacteria [70]. Biotinylation of
bacterial genomic DNA was obtained with EZ-Link Psoralen-PEO-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I
(Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's
guidelines, and were checked by spectrophotometer and
gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was converted to firststrand cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen RT-PCR kit) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. First strand cDNA was made double-strand
with Klenow fragment (NEB, Beverly, MA) as described by
Froussard [71].
Isolation of bacterial transcripts induced in Rhizotrogus
majalis
SCOTS technique was used to identify in vivo gene expression of P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection
of R. majalis. For the control, three 5 μg total RNA samples

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:433

isolated from 48 h bacterial cultures were used to make
double-strand cDNAs using the random primer SCOT09
(5-ATCCACCTATCCCAGTAGGAGNNNNNNNNN). The
synthesized cDNAs were PCR amplified using the primer
SCOT0 (5-ATCCACCTATCCCAGTAGGAG) for 30 cycles.
For the treatment, 10 μl suspension of 48 h P. temperata or
X. koppenhoeferi cultures containing 1 × 104 cells was
injected into the hemolymph of R. majalis from the base
of the foreleg and incubated at 25°C. We evaluated bacterial colonization and found that bacteria of P. temperata
and X. koppenhoeferi were 5 × 105 and 2 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU) per insect, respectively, at 24 h post injection, suggesting development of septicemia. Total RNA
was isolated from the whole insects at 24 h post injection
when the insects were still alive (The insects died within
24 - 48 h). Three 5 μg RNA samples obtained from three
infected insects for each bacterium were used to made
double-strand by the random primer SCOT189 (5-GACAGATTCGCACTTAACCCTNNNNNNNNN).
Doublestrand cDNAs were then PCR amplified for 30 cycles by
primer SCOT18 (5-GACAGATTCGCACTTAACCCT). Bacterial cDNA normalization was done as described below.
In this study, the ribosomal operons (rRNA) of P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi were amplified and used to block
the abundant rRNA sequence in order to effectively capture the cDNA molecules representing mRNA transcripts.
The rRNA operon was added to biotinylated genomic
DNA at a ratio of 10:1. The genomic DNA-rRNA mixture
was sonicated to a size range of 1 to 5 kb. The sonicated,
biotinylated genomic DNA-rRNA mixture containing 6 μg
rRNA and 0.6 μg genomic DNA was denatured and
hybridized for 30 min at 65°C. PCR amplified cDNAs (6
μg) were denatured and added to the genomic DNA-rRNA
prehybridized mixture, and hybridized at 65°C for 24 h.
Streptavidin magnesphere paramagnetic particles (Invitrogen) were used to capture the bacterial cDNAs that
hybridized to biotinylated genomic DNA according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Captured cDNAs were then
eluted, precipitated, and amplified by PCR with the
primer SCOT0 for additional two successive rounds of
SCOTS. After three rounds of SCOTS, the three amplified
cDNA samples for each bacterium were pooled, and the
pooled cDNA mixtures were considered to be normalized
in vitro or in vivo cDNA library.
To enrich the normalized in vivo cDNAs, the normalized
in vivo cDNAs from each bacterium were hybridized to
biotinylated genomic DNA that has been prehybridized
with both rRNA and normalized in vitro cDNAs. After
hybridization, the bacterial cDNAs were captured and
PCR amplified for next round of enrichment. Finally, the
amplified enriched bacterial cDNAs were cloned into an
original TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) to construct the
enriched in vivo cDNA library.

Southern blot screening of SCOTS enriched transcripts
Inserts from the enriched in vivo cDNA library were
screened to confirm to be upregulated by southern blot
hybridization which has been used as a confirmatory test
in most other SCOTS-based studies [72-76]. Individual
clones from each subtractive library were randomly
picked and amplified by PCR using M13 primers. Ten
micro liter of each amplified product was mixed with 70
μl 20 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium
citrate), and then 80 μl sample mixture was transferred to
each well of dot-blot containing the positively charged
nylon membrane at the low vacuum. The nylon membrane with samples was denatured with denature buffer
(3 M NaCl, 0.4 M NaOH) for 10 min at room temperature, and neutralized in 1 × PBS buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 7 mM
Na2HPO4, and 3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8) for 10 min at
room temperature. The membrane was dried by baking at
80°C for 2 h, and then the baked membrane was rinsed
with 2 × SSC and soaked in 2 × SSC for 5 min. The membrane was transferred into a hybridization bottle for
hybridization using Dig easy hyb granules (Roche)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. Normalized,
insect-derived and broth-derived cDNA pools were
labeled using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis kit (Roche) for
use as probes. The probes were denatured and added to
the hybridization bottles containing the membrane and
the hybridization buffer. Hybridization continued at
65°C for approximately 24 h. The membrane was washed
briefly with 2 × SSC at room temperature and then twice
with 1 × SSC - 0.1% SDS for 15 min each time; these
washes were done at 65°C. A final brief rinse with 0.1 ×
SSC at room temperature completed the washing process.
The membrane was incubated at room temperature with
4 ml 1 × SSC with 8% dry milk for 30 m. Four milliliter
dilution of anti-digoxigenin-HRP conjugate (1: 800) was
added, and incubation continues 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was briefly washed as describe above,
and successful hybridization was detected by Amersham
ECL Plus western blotting detection reagents (GE healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ) using chemiluminescent detection. The individual clones that only
hybridized to the probe made from normalized in vivo
cDNAs were chosen for sequence analysis.
Analysis of bacterial genes induced in Rhizotrogus majalis
The samples were sequenced at the Biotechnology Center,
Madison, WI, USA. These sequences were edited and
assembled using Editseq (DNASTAR) and Contig (Vector
NTI). Similar sequences were identified using BLAST algorithms (blastx and tblastx) in GenBank of National Center
for

dancy of each gene was counted cumulatively and the
library coverage was calculated using Analytic Rarefaction
(http://www.uga.edu/strata/software/Software.html[77]
which has been used for estimation of total transcript
diversity in the cDNA library [78-81].
Validation of SCOTS procedure
Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed as described previously [82] to verify results
obtained by SCOTS analysis. To confirm that the identified genes were differentially induced during infection of
the insect hemolymph compared to the culture, RNA was
prepared from either infected insect or broth cultured logphase bacterial cells and DNAse treated. RT-PCR was carried out using 5 μg of RNA in the presence of 5 pmol of
gene specific reverse primers and the primer targeting 16S
rRNA gene for an internal positive control together in the
same reaction. The cDNA template was then diluted 1:100
with sterile ddH2O for use in subsequent PCR. Twentyfive cycles of PCR were performed using primer pairs for
specific genes and 16S rRNA gene in separate vials, but
from the same master mix, using 5 μl of diluted cDNA as
template. In addition, a eukaryotic housekeeping gene
18S rRNA was used as a control to evaluate if bacterial
cDNAs were purified apart from the insect cDNAs after
SCOTS normalization. For this purpose, presence of 18S
rRNA gene in the in vivo cDNA populations before and
after SCOTS normalization was measured by PCR amplification using 50 ng cDNA samples and primers 18SF (5GGAATTGACGGAAGGGCACCA) and 18SR (5-CCAGACAAATCGCTCCACCAAC). Also, a prokaryotic housekeeping gene gyrase A (gyrA) was used as another control
to validate that only differentially expressed genes were
captured after enrichment. The presence of gyrA in cDNA
populations of enriched in vivo cDNAs, and in vitro and in
vivo cDNAs before and after SCOTS normalization was
evaluated by PCR using primers gyrAF (5-ACGCGACGGTGTACCGGCTT) and gyrAR (5-GCCAGAGAAATCACCCCGGTC). All experiments were performed at least
three times.
Comparative hybridization and quantitative real-time
PCR
Comparative hybridization was performed to assess exclusivity of the identified genes to P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi. This approach has been validated for cross-species
comparisons of gene expression in many studies [83-86].
To determine the genomic presence of the identified
genes, genes identified from one bacterial species were
individually screened by cross-hybridization to the sonicated biotinylated genomic DNA of the other, followed by
PCR amplification of the eluted hybrids using the defined
primers SCOT18. The genes with sequence present in both
bacterial genomes were singled out to further evaluate
their induction specificity to P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi. The selected genes induced in one bacterial species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/433

were individually screened by cross-hybridization to a
heterologous probe made by pre-hybridization of sonicated biotinylated genomic DNA with the respective rRNA
operon and normalized in vitro cDNAs of the other, and
subsequently amplified using the defined primer
SCOT18. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was further used to validate and quantify the change of genes
identified exclusively in one or the other bacterium,
excluding genes without sequence similarity between the
two bacteria but with similar functions. These representative genes were chosen for analysis based on the availability of designing qRT-PCR primers using identified
sequences. Total RNA was prepared from bacteria grown
in intro or in vivo as described above. Real-time PCR was
performed in an IQ5 machine (Bio-Rad) using QuantiTect
SybrGreen PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific gene primers for real-time
PCR were listed in the Additional file 4. All reactions were
run in triplicate with three independent cDNA samples
and a no cDNA template negative control. According to a
previous study on Photorhabdus bacteria [87], 16S rRNA
gene was chosen as an internal control for normalization.
The calculated threshold cycle (Ct) was normalized to the
Ct of the 16s rRNA gene amplified from the corresponding sample, and the relative change in expression of a gene
in vivo as compared to in vitro was calculated as previously
described [88].
Pathway analysis
To depict biological interactions influenced by identified
genes, we built information rich predicted interaction networks using the ResnetCore bacterial molecular database
of the PathwayStudio 5.0 (Ariadne, Rockville, MD, USA).
PathwayStudio is a program for visualization and analysis
of biological pathways and gene regulation networks. This
program comes with the ResNet database of more than
500,000 functional relationships and the MedScan tool
for automatic extraction of information from the scientific
literature. First, the direct interaction with proteins and
small molecules for each identified gene was visualized
using PathwayStudio. Then, the interaction network of
identified genes was built based on relationships between
gene products or small molecules in form of binding,
direct molecular regulation, effects on expression, molecule transport, protein modification, and molecule synthesis.
