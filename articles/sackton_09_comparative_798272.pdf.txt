Abstract
Background: Homology-based comparisons of the genes involved in innate immunity across many
insect taxa with fully sequenced genomes has revealed a striking pattern of gene gain and loss,
particularly among genes that encode proteins involved in clearing pathogens (effectors). However,
limited functional annotation in non-model systems has hindered understanding of evolutionary
novelties in the insect innate immune system.
Results: We use short read sequencing technology (Illumina/Solexa) to compare the
transcriptional response to infection between the well studied model system Drosophila
melanogaster and the distantly related drosophilid D. virilis. We first demonstrate that Illumina/
Solexa sequencing of cDNA from infected and uninfected D. melanogaster recapitulates previously
published microarray studies of the transcriptional response to infection in this species, validating
our approach. We then show that patterns of transcription of homologous genes differ
considerably between D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and identify potential candidates for novel
components of the D. virilis immune system based on transcriptional data. Finally, we use a
proteomic approach to characterize the protein constituents of the D. virilis hemolymph and
validate our transcriptional data.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the acquisition of novel components of the immune
system, and particularly novel effector proteins, may be a common evolutionary phenomenon.

Background
Host-pathogen interactions are ubiquitous in nature,
leading to coevolutionary dynamics that are predicted to
drive rapid evolution of the immune system. It is now
increasingly clear that this coevolutionary "arms race"
leads to increased rates of protein evolution in genes
encoding components of the immune system across a
large number of taxa [1-7]. Recent work in mosquitoes
[8,9] and fruit flies [5] has suggested that the immune system may also be unusual in the rate at which new genes

are recruited into the system, and existing components of
the system turn over by gene duplication or loss. Genes
encoding effector proteins (proteins involved in bacterial
killing and clearance), and particularly antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), often have lineage-restricted patterns of
homology and show very rapid rates of gene turnover
within gene families [5]. Most strikingly, two multigene
families – the Drosomycin antimicrobial peptide family
[10] and the Turandot family [11,12] of induced but otherwise uncharacterized proteins – appear to be evolutionPage 1 of 17

ary novelties restricted to D. melanogaster and related
species in the Sophophora subgenus of drosophilids [5].
This pattern is in contrast to genes encoding components
of immune-related signaling pathways, which are typically found as single copy orthologs even among distantly
related insects [8,9,13], and have identifiable homologs
in mammals [14]. Together, these observations suggest
that disruption of stoichiometry, dosage, and other conserved interactions among signaling pathways is usually
deleterious, leading to very low tolerance of gene copy
variation among signaling pathways and preservation of
single-copy orthologs across deep evolutionary time.
Conversely, these observations suggest that pathway outputs retain flexibility, allowing novel effectors to be easily
recruited into the system, potentially leading to rapid, and
perhaps advantageous, proliferation of effector components across evolutionary time.
If this model is correct, effector proteins should be
recruited and lost from the immune system at a relatively
high frequency, which implies that novel components of
the immune system remain to be discovered in species of
Drosophila distantly related to D. melanogaster. It has long
been recognized that highly divergent insect clades often
harbour unique antimicrobial peptides: gambicin in mosquitoes [15], lebocin in Bombyx [16], thanatin from the
bug Podisus maculiventris [17], and many others [reviewed
in [18]]. However, the evolutionary dynamics of the
acquisition of novel effector components in the innate
immune system have not been considered previously.
While the genome sequences of twelve Drosophila species
[19] have allowed the discovery of many novel genes
across this phylogeny, functional annotation still depends
largely on homology to known D. melanogaster genes.
Thus, our knowledge of the gain and loss of immune function genes has a strong ascertainment bias, and is
restricted to genes that are paralogous to known genes in
D. melanogaster.
In this study, we used short-read sequencing technology
to characterize the transcriptional response to infection in
D. virilis, a member of the Drosophila subgenus that last
shared a common ancestor with D. melanogaster and the
rest of the Sophophora subgenus 40 million years ago [20].
Short-read sequencing technology allows identification of
differentially expressed genes without the need for prior
annotations, and thus is ideal for detecting induced components of the D. virilis immune system that lack
homologs in D. melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate that
short-read sequencing of oligo(dT)-primed doublestranded cDNA provides a robust and accurate method to
identify differentially transcribed regions of the genome.
We then use this approach to sequence cDNA from
infected and uninfected samples of D. virilis to characterize the genes that are induced by infection, and use that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/259

sequencing data to annotate novel components of the D.
virilis immune system. Furthermore, using a LC-MS/MS
proteomic approach, we identify immune-regulated protein constituents of the D. virilis hemolymph that validate
novel transcripts that had been identified by the shortread cDNA sequencing as being responsive to infection in
D. virilis.

Results and discussion
Aligning sequencing reads to the reference genome and
identified genes regulated by infection
We generated between 4.8 and 5.2 million 36 bp reads
from one lane of Illumina/Solexa sequencing for each of
four biological samples: naïve (uninfected) D. melanogaster iso-1 (DmelU), 12 hours post-challenge
(infected) D. melanogaster iso-1 (DmelI), naïve (uninfected) D. virilis 15010-1051.87 (DvirU), and 12 hourspost challenge (infected) D. virilis 15010-1051.87 (DvirI).
Infected flies were challenged by artificial infection with a
mixed culture of one Gram-negative bacteria (Serratia
marcescens) and one Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcos
faecalis); see Methods for details. Prior to mapping these
sequencing reads to the reference genome, we filtered low
complexity reads, low quality reads, and repetitive reads
(including polyadenylated mRNA tails), resulting in
between 1.6 and 2.6 million useable reads from each of
the four samples (Figure 1; see Methods for details). To
map reads to the reference, we used a combination of
Mosaik (a BLAT-like tool optimized for aligning shortread sequencing reads to a reference; http://bioinformat
ics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik) and BLAST [21], which
allowed us to map between 71.3% and 83.7% of the reads
that passed our filters, representing 1.2 to 1.9 million
reads (Figure 1; see Methods for details). We then identified expressed regions in each species as described in the
Methods. Overall, we identified 4,615 expressed regions
in D. melanogaster; 3,001 of those regions were associated
with a total of 2,540 annotated genes (Additional file 1).
In D. virilis, we identified 6,737 expressed regions, of
which 584 were associated with 579 genes (Additional file
2). Further details of our methodology are provided in the
Methods.

Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), we assigned each
expressed region to one of five states: strongly induced by
infection, induced by infection, not regulated by infection, repressed by infection, or strongly repressed by infection. Each state is defined in the HMM by the binomial
probability of observing the number of reads aligned to
each base from the infected sample, given the total
number of reads that align to each base; because the
number of reads that map from the infected and naïve
samples is not equal, the binomial probably for the unregulated class is not expected to be 0.50 (Table 1; see Methods for details). We infer that 841 (21.3% of all identified

induced by infection in D. melanogaster and D. virilis,

Additionally, we can quantitatively compare induction
between our study and the previously published microarray where the infection protocol and sampling time postinfection where most similar to our study ([24]; in which
D. melanogaster was infected by septic injury with a mixed
bacterial culture and assayed at 12 hours post infection).
Despite differences in the line (Oregon R vs. iso-1) and sex
(male vs. female) of the flies, and the species and pathogenicity of bacteria used (non-pathogenic E. coli and M.
luteus mixture vs. pathogenic S. marcescens and E. faecalis
mixture), we still find a significant correlation between
induction measured by microarray in DeGregorio et al.
[24] and induction measured by our method (r = 0.3225,
P < 2.2 × 10-16). However, this correlation is much weaker

Validation of cDNA sequencing by comparison to
published microarray data
Because the transcriptional response to infection has been
extremely well characterized in D. melanogaster [e.g. [2226]], we can validate our short-read cDNA sequencing
approach by comparison to previous studies. We compiled data from four microarray experiments published
between 2001 and 2005 [22-24,26] that compared gene
expression in infected and naïve D. melanogaster and characterized genes as up-regulated or down-regulated. Based
on the definitions from each study, we count how many
times a gene was defined as 'up-regulated' or 'down-regu-

lated' across the four studies. There are 294 genes that are
both present in our list of expressed regions and significantly regulated by infection on at least one of the four
microarrays; those that are up-regulated in multiple
microarrays are substantially more likely to be strongly
induced in our data (Figure 2). Furthermore, genes
induced in more microarrays are more likely to be
assigned to an induced state by our HMM (Figure 3).

when limited to genes that are weakly induced (2-fold or
less induction in both our data and the microarray data; r
= 0.0429, P = 0.0388), and much stronger when limited
to genes that are strongly induced (greater than 2-fold
induction in both datasets; r = 0.5053, P = 0.002). While
these results demonstrate considerable consistency
between induction measured by short-read sequencing of
oligo(dT) primed, double-stranded cDNA and induction
measured by traditional microarray methods, they also
suggest that higher depth of coverage may be needed to
accurately assay weakly induced genes. However, at least
for identifying strongly induced genes, short read
sequencing approaches appear to be robust and accurate,
suggesting that this approach may prove to be a simple
and cost-effective way to identify differentially regulated
genes in poorly annotated genomes in response to any
number of treatments of biological interest.
The transcriptional response to infection in D. virilis and
D. melanogaster
We identified 841 expressed regions that appear to be
induced by infection in D. virilis. Because of the 3' bias in
our cDNA preparation, the relatively low coverage of our
sequencing, and the lack of annotation of 3' UTR
sequence in the D. virilis genome, only about 5% of these
induced regions overlap with an annotated exon. To
attempt to associate a greater percentage of induced
regions with genes, we analyzed the genomic region in
more detail for these 841 regions, and preliminarily
assigned expressed regions to annotated gene models if
they were fewer than 500 bp from the 3' end of the nearest
gene model, and more than 1 kb from the 3' end of all
other gene models (see Methods for details). We eliminated from further analysis induced regions (but not
strongly induced regions) located on minor scaffolds (< 1
Mbp), leaving a total of 199 candidate induced regions in
D. virilis, 101 of which can be preliminarily associated
with 95 D. virilis genes.

In order to understand the similarities between the D. melanogaster and D. virilis immune responses, we focused on
the 490 genes in D. melanogaster (Additional file 3) and
the 95 genes in D. virilis (Additional file 4) associated with
induced regions. We used three approaches to identify
orthologs and paralogs of these gene models. First, for any
gene model included in the manual homology annotation of immune system genes [5], we used the homology
and orthology assignments from that work. For the
remaining genes, we used homologs annotated by FlyBase. If FlyBase reported no homolog, we verified the
absence of homologs by reference to the homology
assignments generated by the Drosophila 12 Genomes
Consortium [19].
Of the 490 induced genes in D. melanogaster (Additional
file 3), 19 have no identifiable homologs in D. virilis, 444

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/259

have homologs in D. virilis, and 27 have ambiguous
homology. Genes associated with expressed regions
assigned to state 1 (highly induced) are significantly more
likely to lack homologs in D. virilis that genes associated
with expressed regions assigned to state 2 (Odds ratio =
5.22, Fisher's Exact Test P-value = 0. 001). As highly
induced genes are much more likely to represent effectors,
this result is expected based on the analysis of Sackton et
al. [5], which showed that effector proteins are much
more likely to have lineage restricted patterns of homology than immune system genes as a whole.
This same pattern seems to hold in D. virilis, suggesting
that the high rate of turnover in effector proteins may be
quite general. In D. virilis, the 95 gene models associated
with induced regions (Additional file 4) include 8 with no
identifiable homologs in D. melanogaster and 87 with
homologs in D. melanogaster. Like in D. melanogaster,
genes associated with expressed regions assigned to state 1
are more likely to lack homologs that those associated
with expressed regions assigned to state 2, although this
pattern is not significant (Odds ratio = 3.08, Fisher's Exact
Test P-value = 0.15).
In both species, gene models that are highly induced
(state 1) encode significantly shorter predicted polypeptides than induced (state 2) gene models (Mann-Whitney
U; D. melanogaster P = 1.7 × 10-9, D. virilis P = 2.3 × 10-4).
Furthermore, in both species gene models that lack
homologs in the other species are significantly shorter
than those gene models that have homologs (Mann-Whitney U; D. melanogaster P = 7.4 × 10-7, D. virilis P = 0.006).
Because it can be difficult to infer homology patterns
between highly divergent short peptides, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the deficiency of gene models with
detectable homologs among the highly induced class
reflects high rates of divergence rather than lack of
homologs, although the observation that immune effector proteins tend to be highly conserved at the protein
sequence level among Drosophilids [5] suggests against
this interpretation.
The putatively induced genes that have identifiable
homologs between species reveal broad similarities in the
transcriptional response to infection between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. As expected based on our comparison of the D. melanogaster induced genes to previous
microarray studies, most of the highly induced genes are
antimicrobial peptides, Turandots, and other immuneinduced peptides such as the IMs [Drosophila immune
molecule, [27]]. We also see other immune genes such as
PGRP-SB1, Transferrin 1, and TepII strongly induced after
infection in D. melanogaster. In D. virilis, homologs of
many effectors or putative effectors are identified as
induced in our sample. The genes associated with
expressed regions assigned to state 1 in D. virilis encode

Attacins, Cecropins, Metchnikowin, Diptericins, PGRPSB1, and a protein with homology to IM1. We also find
evidence for induction of homologs of two additional
peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP-LB and PGRPLC) and the D. virilis homologs of Relish, MP1, and necrotic
(Additional file 4). Given the limitations of our sequencing strategy in detecting weakly induced genes, we have
almost certainly not detected all induced signalling and
recognition genes in D. virilis. Thus, in the next section, we
focus on the most strongly induced category of genes in
both species, the AMPs.
Differences in the members of AMP families induced after
infection
Despite the overall similarity of the transcriptional
response to infection in D. virilis and D. melanogaster,
notable differences exist in the pattern of induction of
members of AMP gene families. The D. melanogaster
genome encodes 20 antimicrobial peptides that are members of seven gene families. These peptides can be broadly
grouped into three categories: cysteine-rich peptides characterized by pairs of disulfide bonds (Defensin: Def; and
Drosomycins: Drs, Drs-l, Dro2, Dro3, Dro4, Dro5, Dro6),
peptides with an amphiphilic α-helical conformation
(Cecropins: CecA1, CecA2, CecB, CecC), and proline or
glycine rich peptides (Attacins: AttA, AttB, AttC, AttD;
Drosocin: Dro; Metchnikowin: Mtk, and Diptericins: Dpt
and DptB). Five of these families – Diptericins, Cecropins,
Attacins, Metchnikowin, and Defensin – have homologs
in D. virilis, encoding total of 15 known antimicrobial
peptides; Drosocin and Drosomycins are absent from the
entire Drosophila subgenus [5].

Most of these AMPs are strongly induced after infection
(Table 3 and Table 4). In D. virilis, 10 of the 15 AMPs are
highly induced (state 1) after infection; the remaining 5
are not expressed in our sample. In D. melanogaster, 10 of
the 20 AMPs are highly induced, an 11th is moderately
induced (state 2), and a 12th appears to be very weakly
expressed, but not induced (state 3). Among the homologous AMP families, the Diptericins are the most strongly
induced in both species: marginally so in D. melanogaster
(Table 3), and strikingly so in D. virilis (Table 4). Furthermore, in both species Diptericins represent the largest
fraction of total AMP transcription in the infected sample
(as measured by average coverage of the infected sample),
and Diptericin expression is dominated by a single paralog (Figure 4), although when non-homologous AMP
families are included, Dro dominates overall transcription
in the infected D. melanogaster sample. The extent to
which one AMP predominates is strikingly different
between species, however: in D. melanogaster, Dro, Mtk,
Drs and Dpt are all transcribed at high levels in the
infected sample, whereas no other AMP is transcribed at
nearly the level of Dpt in D. virilis (Figure 4), suggesting
that the spectrum of antimicrobial peptides produced
after infection may be narrower in D. virilis than in D. melanogaster. There are also differences in the relative transcription level of paralogs within the Cecropin, Attacin,
and Diptericin AMP families. In the D. virilis sample, one
member of each family tends to dominate transcription
(Figure 4 and Table 4), whereas in D. melanogaster the relative transcription of paralogs within a AMP family is less
skewed (with the exception of Dpt; Figure 4 and Table 3).

On a broader scale, in both species the proline- and glycine- rich peptides represent most of the total AMP transcription (D. virilis: 93.6%, D. melanogaster: 81.9% of the
total coverage across all AMPs, normalized for length).
Again, though, D. melanogaster appears to transcribe a
broader spectrum of antimicrobial peptides in response to
infection, with a substantial fraction of the total transcription of AMPs in D. melanogaster associated with cysteinerich (Drs/Def; 13.5%) AMPs. This analysis of course
excludes any uncharacterized AMPs in D. virilis. However,
as discussed below, the most promising candidates for
novel D. virilis AMPs appear to be in the glycine- and proline- rich family, suggesting that D. virilis may in fact produce a narrower range of AMP types in response to our
artificial infection protocol. In is possible that this observation could be attributable to differences in the ability of
the bacterial species used to replicate efficiently between
D. virilis and D. melanogaster, resulting in differences in
the nature of the infection experienced by the two species
of Drosophila. Alternatively, D. virilis and D. melanogaster differ at a number of ecological traits, any of
which could potentially lead to different selective pressures for the diversity of AMPs produced: D. melanogaster
is tropical, D. virilis is Holarctic; D. melanogaster breeds
on a wide range of substrates, typically rotting fruit, D. virilis breeds on sap fluxes [20]. While it is tempting to speculate, a fuller understanding of the diversity of D. virilis
AMPs and the persistence of differences in transcription in
response to multiple challenges will be needed before the
hypothesis that D. virilis responds to infection with a narrower and less diverse range of AMPs can be established.

Novel components of the D. virilis immune system
As noted above, a number of D. virilis gene models associated with induced regions do not have identifiable
homologs in D. melanogaster or other species of the melanogaster species group. In this section, we discuss these
putative novel components of the D. virilis immune system in more detail (Table 5). Broadly speaking, these ten
gene models fall into three classes: those encoding predicted proteins that are apparently not secreted (lack a signal peptide); those encoding predicted proteins that are
short, secreted, negatively charged, and appear to be distantly related to the IM proteins in D. melanogaster; and
those encoding short, positively charged, secreted proteins that are often proline or glycine rich and may represent novel AMPs. Predicted proteins were considered
secreted if SignalP [28] predicted a signal peptide.
Gene models lacking a signal peptide
Two putatively induced D. virilis gene models lack a signal
peptide. One, dvir_GLEANR_13841 is a short protein
(155 aa) that is moderately induced (corrected induction
2.04,
assigned
to
state
2).
The
second,
dvir_GLEANR_15023, is somewhat longer, 280 amino
acids, but is highly repetitive, consisting of 20 repeats of a
12–17 amino acid motif. The repetitive nature of this predicted gene makes identifying putative homologs difficult; we fail to detect any via BLAST, and no homologs in
any species are reported in Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium [19]. This gene model is flagged as potentially
representing a repeat-contaminated gene model, suggesting that this result may be artefactual.

For proteins with a predicted signal peptide, molecular weight and net charge of the predicted mature peptide were computed using the ExPASy
web server.

Secreted, IM-like peptides
Two gene models in D. virilis that are putatively associated
with an induced region, dvir_GLEANR_345 and
dvir_GLEANR_5361, have strong evidence for a signal
peptide, and are short (fewer than 50 amino acids), suggesting the possibility that these are novel effector proteins. However, they are unlikely to be antimicrobial
peptides. Almost all antimicrobial peptides have a net
positive charge; the predicted proteins encoded by these
two GLEANR models both have a negative net charge. The
proteins with the closest homology are the IM proteins of
D. melanogaster. These are a family of short, strongly
induced peptides of unknown function.
Putative novel AMPs
The remaining three GLEANR models, plus the two nonGLEANR gene models (which are paralogs of each other)
that appear to be strongly induced by infection, are all
secreted peptides with predicted molecular weights
between 4 and 6 kD and predicted positive charge at physiological pHs (Table 5). All three have homologs in D.
mojavensis and D. grimshawi, the two species with
sequenced genomes that are most closely related to D. virilis, but not in any other species of Drosophila with
sequenced genomes. In addition dvir_GLEANR_3774 and
the non-GLEANR gene model are both ~18% proline,
which combined with their patterns of induction, size,
and charge suggests that they might be similar in function
to the proline-rich family of AMPs, including abaecins
and apidaecins from bees (~30% proline), as well as Mtk
and Dro from Drosophila (~25% proline).
Protein constituents of the D. virilis hemolymph
In order to further characterize the D. virilis immune
response, we used a proteomic approach (iTRAQ/tandem
MS) to analyze the protein constituents of D. virilis hemolymph, in both naïve (uninfected) and immune-challenged flies. Previous work in D. melanogaster has focused
on identifying proteins that increase in concentration in

the hemolymph after immune challenge [27,29-32], characterizing the proteins involved in clotting [33,34], and
mapping the proteins present in larval hemolymph in an
unchallenged state [35,36]. This wealth of information
about the protein constituents of hemolymph in D. melanogaster thus provides a comparative context for proteomic studies of other species of Drosophila.
In order to characterize the protein content of the D. virilis
hemolymph, we used two methods. First, we assessed the
relative concentration of each identified protein using the
emPAI statistic implemented in MASCOT [37]. This statistic is calculated based on the fraction of potentially
observable peptides that are in fact observed in the sample
for any given protein. Second, we used the iTRAQ chemistry (Applied Biosystems), which uses tags to mark each
sample (in this case, infected and uninfected hemolymph), to estimate the relative abundance of each identified protein in the infected and uninfected samples using
the software ProteinPilot (Applied Biosystems).
In general, the protein constituents of the D. virilis hemolymph show substantial homology to previously identified components of the D. melanogaster hemolymph
(Figure 5). In the total (combined infected and naïve)
sample, 47.3% of the total protein is composed of D. virilis proteins with D. melanogaster homologs that have been
identified as present in the D. melanogaster hemolymph.
Another 30.2% of the total protein in D. virilis hemolymph is consists of proteins with D. melanogaster
homologs that have not been previously characterized as
components of the D. melanogaster hemolymph. Finally,
22.6% of the D. virilis hemolymph is composed of proteins without D. melanogaster homologs. Surprisingly, one
of these proteins (FBpp0227890) represented 20% of the
total protein content of the D. virilis hemolymph; this protein has identifiable homologs in D. mojavensis and D.
grimshawi, but no other species of insect with sequenced
genomes, and has no significant BLAST similarity to any

other proteins in Genbank. Thus, while the most common
protein in D. virilis hemolymph appears to be an evolutionary novelty, the general spectrum of hemolymph proteins between D. melanogaster and D. virilis appear broadly
conserved.
The changes in protein concentration in the D. virilis
hemolymph we observe after infection are largely consistent with our expectations based on our transcriptional
data. We see a significant correlation between transcriptional induction and changes in protein concentration
(Spearman's ρ = 0.672, P = 0.0008; Figure 6), although
only a small fraction of the total expressed regions we
observe in our transcriptional data can be associated with
proteins identified in the D. virilis hemolymph. Consistent with our observation that genes encoding homologs
of Diptericin are the most strongly induced AMPs in D.
virilis (Figure 4B), we find that Diptericin homologs are

also the proteins that increases most in concentration
after infection (Additional file 5; note that the Dpt
homologs FBpp0234332 and FBpp0234333 cannot be
distinguished at the protein level in D. virilis). Finally, one
of the putative novel AMPs identified in our transcriptional
analysis
(dvir_GLEANR_7739,
encoding
FBpp0236872) is the protein that increases in concentration second most in our hemolymph sample (after the
Dpt homologs FBpp0234332/FBpp0234333), providing
further evidence for a potential antimicrobial or immune
role for this protein.

Conclusion
In this study, we used short read cDNA sequencing to
characterize the transcriptional response to infection in D.
virilis and D. melanogaster. We show that even a relatively
small number of sequencing reads (1 lane per sample,
about 5 million reads before filtering and about 1.2 mil-

lion mapped reads) can produce reliable estimates of
induction, at least for strongly induced genes, consistent
with recent results suggesting high technical repeatability
of this approach [38]. By comparing the relative induction
of AMP gene families in D. melanogaster and D. virilis, we
show that significant differences in the relative induction

of different peptides exist between species. The striking
increase in induction of Dpt homologs in D. virilis relative
to D. melanogaster is supported by the observation that
Dpt homologs represent 11.5% of the protein in D. virilis
hemolymph from infected flies, far higher than any other
AMP. Finally, we show that some predicted D. virilis genes

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:259

that lack homologs to D. melanogaster share characteristics
with the proline-rich AMP superfamily, and the protein
encoded by at least one of these genes is detectable in the
hemolymph of infected flies, suggesting that D. virilis
likely possesses lineage-restricted immune system components, and that the pattern we observe in D. melanogaster
is general. Taken together, these results suggest that novel
downstream components of the immune system can be
rapidly integrated of relatively short time scales. The adaptive potential of gene gain and loss should not be overlooked in the evolutionary dynamics of host immune
systems.

Methods
Biological samples for transcriptional analysis
The Drosophila stocks used in this experiment were the
sequenced strains of D. melanogaster (iso-1) and D. virilis
(15010-1051.87). Flies were maintained in bottle cultures
on a rich dextrose medium at 25° and in 12 hr:12 hr light/
dark for the duration of the experiment. We infected 50
females of each species with a mixed bacterial culture of
Serratia marcescens and Enterococcos faecalis by pricking the
thorax with a 0.1-mm dissecting pin (Fine Science Tools,
Foster City, CA) dipped in bacterial culture, as previously
described [39]. We chose to use a mixed culture, consisting of one Gram-negative bacteria and one Gram-positive
bacteria, in order to maximize our ability to detect a diversity of immune-inducible proteins. At 12 hours after infection, infected flies and a sample of 50 naïve flies were
frozen in liquid nitrogen. We extracted total RNA from
frozen flies using standard protocols (Trizol). After extraction, total RNA was treated with DNase to remove potential genomic DNA contamination, according to the
manufacturer's protocols. We synthesized first strand
cDNA using oligio-d(T) primers, and then synthesized
second strand cDNA, according to standard protocols.
Sequencing was done by the Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center on an Illumina GA2
sequencer.
Aligning reads to the reference genome
Prior to mapping reads to the reference genome, we filtered low quality, low complexity, and repetitive reads.
We first removed any read having fewer than 24 bases
with a Phred quality score (Q) greater than 20; this is our
'low quality' filter. Next, we removed any read with low
nucleotide complexity (80%+ of the sequence composed
of only 2 bases) or repetitive elements (more than half the
sequence composed of dinucleotide or trinucleotide
repeats). Finally, we removed any reads with a mononucleotide run greater than 24 bases.

After filtering, we did an initial round of mapping to the
repeat-masked D. virilis or D. melanogaster reference
genome with Mosaik, a software program written by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/259

Gabor Marth lab (A. Quinlan and G. Marth, http://bioin
formatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik, unpublished) that
uses a BLAT-like approach. The program hashes the
genome into unique n-mers (where n, the hash size, can
be specified by the user; we used 17 bp), which it uses as
seeds to align the sequencing reads to the reference. We
required all matches to align for at least 91% of the read
length (33 of 36 bp) and have no more than 3 mismatches.
To supplement the mapping from this initial Mosaik run,
we took two approaches. First, we noticed that some reads
fail to map because low quality ends or partial polyA
sequence cause them to fail to pass our alignment length
filter. In order to get around this, we trimmed up to 10 bp
from the end of any read where average quality across a 5
or 10 bp segment was less than Phred Q20. We also
trimmed any mononucleotide run from the end of a read.
After trimming, we rejected any read that was shorter than
20 bp, or that failed to pass our QC filters (which we reran
on the trimmed sequence). The remaining reads were
then rerun in Mosaik, using the same parameters
described above.
Finally, we attempted to map the remaining sequences
using BLAST. Any reads that passed all our quality control
filters, but could not be mapped using Mosaik even after
end-trimming, were run through a BLAST pipeline: we
used blastn with a word size of 7 and an E-value cutoff of
1 × 10-6, and considered any read mapped if either 1)
there was only a single BLAST hit to the reference genome,
or 2) there were fewer than 10 hits and the best hit aligned
over at least 90% of the read length and had a lower Evalue than the next best hit. Any read with more than 10
hits was considered repetitive and was not mapped.
After mapping, we combined the output from both
Mosaik runs and the BLAST pipeline to produce a single
file for each contig containing the depth of coverage at
each base in the genome (using the program ace2dep,
from the Marth lab, to convert Mosaik output into depth,
and custom Perl scripts to convert BLAST output into
depth information). The depth of coverage at each base
along a scaffold was then the input to our pipeline to
identify expressed regions of the genome regulated by
infection.
Identifying regions regulated by infection
We first defined an expressed region as any contiguous
stretch of DNA along a scaffold where the minimum coverage of the combined infected and uninfected samples at
any one base is 1, and the average combined coverage
across the region is at least 10. Based on this definition, we
identified 4615 expressed regions in D. melanogaster
(Additional file 1) and 6737 in D. virilis (Additional file

2). The median length of an expressed region in D. melanogaster is 237 bp (Figure 7A), compared to a median
length in D. virilis of 104 bp (Figure 7B). Approximately
the same number of reads map to D. virilis and D. melanogaster (Figure 1), so it is unclear why we identify more
regions that are on average shorter in D. virilis.

tionally, so that the highest probability in the matrix was
equal to 0.999. Empirically, this tuning appeared to
increase the consistency of our results, with fewer
expressed regions being assigned to multiple states.
To determine the most likely state for any given expressed
region, we weighted the Viterbi estimate of the state of
each base in an expressed region by the summed coverage
of that base. If one state had a majority of this measure, we
assigned the expressed region to that state. For the 5.2% of
expressed regions in D. virilis and 13.5% of expressed
regions in D. melanogaster for which either the weighted
sum assigned to the best state was not at least 50% of the
total weighted sum, or for which no single base had sufficiently high coverage to be included in our HMM, we consider the state as "not determined" (Table 2).

To determine the extent to which each expressed region
responds to infection, we developed a Hidden Markov
Model, with five hidden states representing the degree of
induction (highly induced, moderately induced,
unchanged, moderately repressed, highly repressed),
where the emission probability for each state is the binomial probability of observing x infected coverage given n
total coverage at each base pair, and the observed data is
the coverage of infected reads at each base. We used the
HiddenMarkov package in R to optimize our HMM using
the Baum-Welch algorithm, and to calculate the most
probable set of states using the Viterbi algorithm. The
optimized emission probabilities for each state are given
in Table 1. Before running the HMM, we removed sites
with less than 10× coverage pooled across samples, as
there is very little power to distinguish between states with
so few reads. In order to increase the number of expressed
regions for which all sites are assigned to the same state,
we tuned the transition probabilities by increasing the
probability of remaining in the same state, and decreasing
the probabilities of transitioning between states proporA. D. melanogaster

Associating expressed regions with genes
We used two methods to associate expressed regions with
annotated genes. First, we used an automated first-pass
method, where we simply asked whether any base in an
expressed region also falls into an annotated exon, based
on the D. melanogaster release 5.7 annotations and the D.
virilis release 1.1 annotations available as GFF files from
FlyBase (downloaded 4/24/2008). However, given the 3'
bias inherent in oligo(dT) primed cDNAs, plus the relatively low coverage to which we sequenced, our identified
expressed regions are short (Figure 8). In D. melanogaster

this does not pose much of a challenge, as the genome
annotation is quite mature and includes fully annotated 3'
UTRs. In D. virilis, however, 3' UTRs are generally not
annotated, leading to any expressed region that falls
entirely in a UTR failing to be associated with any gene.
Given the length distribution of 3' UTRs in D. melanogaster
(Figure 8), we expect a substantial fraction of our
expressed regions in D. virilis to suffer from this problem.
As a partial remedy, we analyzed the 841 induced
genomic regions in D. virilis in more detail. For these 841
regions, we extracted the nearest 3' end of a gene to the
start of the expressed region on the positive strand and the
nearest 3' end of a gene to the end of the expressed region
on the negative strand. We consider one of these
expressed regions to be putatively associated with a annotated gene in D. virilis if the smaller distance was less than
500 bp and the larger distance was greater than 1 kb, or if
the smaller distance was less than 200 bp and the larger
distance was greater than 500 bp. Regions more distant
that 500 bp from any other gene were declared "putatively
unassociated," and the remaining regions were declared
"ambiguous." The number of regions assigned to each
class is listed in Table 6.

with annotated genes between the two induced classes in
D. virilis, we divided the D. virilis scaffolds into "major"
scaffolds (the 23 scaffolds with at least 1 Mb of sequence,
which represent 77% of the total D. virilis sequence) and
the remaining "minor" scaffolds. Induced regions
assigned to state 1 are much more likely to be on a major
scaffold than induced regions assigned to state 2 (Odds
ratio = 14.3, Fisher's Exact Test P-value = 4.85 × 10-12). As
expected, regions on minor scaffolds, irrespective of class,
are much more likely to fail to be associated with an annotated gene (Odds ratio = 144.6, Fisher's Exact Test P-value
< 2.2 × 10-16). However, the difference between minor and
major scaffolds does not seem to fully explain the difference between state 1 and state 2, as even when restricted
to just the major scaffolds expressed regions assigned to
state 1 are more likely to be associated with genes (Odds
ratio = 4.4, Fisher's Exact Test P-value = 0.0027). It could
be that highly induced genes are more likely to have
homologs in D. melanogaster, increasing the probability
that those genes would be annotated in D. virilis. However, among just the regions that are associated with
genes, it is actually state 2 that is more likely to have
homologs in D. melanogaster (based on fuzzy reciprocal
BLAST calls downloaded from FlyBase under the
"Genomes FTP" section; Odds ratio = 3.60, Fisher's Exact
Test P-value = 0.0176). Because of the difficulties in annotating genes on minor scaffolds, we have limited our primary analysis to the 33 expressed regions in state 1, plus
the 166 expressed regions in state 2 that are on major scaffolds: this sample of 199 expressed regions includes 101
that can be associated with an annotated gene, as
described above, and 98 that cannot.
Sample preparation and iTRAQ labeling for proteomic
studies
We extracted hemolymph from approximately 200 D. virilis females 24 hours after infection with a mixed culture
of E. faecalis and S. marcescens (infected sample) and 200
uninfected controls (uninfected sample). Hemolymph
extracts were spun for 10 minutes at low speed to pellet
cellular material. Equal amounts of each sample (40 μg
protein) were then aliquoted in duplicate, reduced,
cysteine-blocked and digested by trypsin. Each aliquot
was labeled with a different iTRAQ tag according to the
manufacturer's instructions (document #4351918A and
4350831C downloaded from http://docs.appliedbiosys
tems.com/search.taf, Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The 114 and 115 tags were used to label the peptides
in the two identical samples from control (uninfected)
sample and the 116 and 117 tags were used for two
extracts from the infected sample. After labeling, the four
samples were pooled and subjected to cation exchange
chromatography as described below.

Strong Cation Exchange Fractionation
Strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation was completed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC with UV detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA). The tryptic
peptides labeled with iTRAQ tags were reconstituted in
buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate pH 3.0, 25%
ACN), prior to SCX LC. The samples (~400 μg) were
loaded onto a PolyLC Polysulfoethyl A column (2.1 mm
× 150 mm) purchased from PolyLC Inc. (Columbia, MD).
Buffer B was composed of 10 mM potassium phosphate
pH 3.0, 25% ACN with 1 M KCl. Sample fractionation was
completed using the gradient 0% B, 15 min, 0–25% B in
40 min, 25–50% B in 10 min and hold 50% B for 10 min.
During this elution, forty fractions were collected at a flow
rate of 200 μl/min on the basis of the UV trace at 214 nm.
Several fractions were pooled post-collection to yield a
total of 10 sample containing fractions. Salts were
removed via solid phase extraction using Waters SepPak
C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and purified peptide
fractions were dried and reconstituted in 2% ACN, 0.05%
formic acid and injected on the nLC-MS/MS.
Reverse-Phase Separation and Tandem Mass
Spectrometry
The 10 SCX fractions were partially evaporated to remove
ACN and desalted by solid phase extraction. All SPEextracted and gel-extracted peptide samples were reconstituted in 50 μl of 0.1% formic acid with 2% acetonitrile
prior to mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. NanoLC was
carried out by an LC Packings Ultimate integrated capillary HPLC system equipped with a Switchos valve switching unit (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). An aliquot of peptide
fractions (5.0 μl) were injected using a Famous auto sampler onto a PepMap C18 trap column (5 μm, 300 μm × 5
mm, Dionex) for on-line desalting and then separated on
a PepMap C-18 RP nano column, eluted in a 90-minute
gradient of 5% to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at
250 nl/min. The nanoLC was connected in-line to a
hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, 4000 Q Trap from ABI/MDS Sciex (Framingham, MA)
equipped with Micro Ion Spray Head ion source. MS data
acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.4.2 software
(Applied Biosystems) in the positive ion mode for information dependant acquisition (IDA) analysis. The nanospray voltage was 2.0 kV used for all experiments in

positive ion mode. Nitrogen was used as the curtain
(value of 10) and collision gas (set to high) with heated
interface at 150°C. The declustering potential was set at
50 eV and Gas1 was 15 (arbitrary unit). In IDA analysis,
after each survey scan for m/z 400 to m/z 1550 and an
enhanced resolution scan, the three highest intensity ions
with multiple charge states were selected for tandem MS
(MS/MS) with rolling collision energy applied for
detected ions based on different charge states and m/z values.
Data analysis and protein identifications
MS/MS spectra generated from nanoLC/ESI-based IDA
analyses were interrogated using ProteinPilot™ software
2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for database
search against the FlyBase FB2008_06 D. virilis peptides
database by Paragon method. The default setting for
trypsin with MMTS modification of cysteine and a
methionine oxidation was used for quantitative processing and rapid ID. The protein identifications are reported
with total ProtScore >1.3 for each protein representing >
95% statistical significance in ProteinPilot. In order to
estimate abundance ratios and statistical significance for
each identified protein, we created custom R scripts (available upon request) that extended the ProteinPilot statistical approach to account for the technical replication
included in our experiment. Briefly, for each peptide we
calculate an average infected/uninfected ratio as well as an
average error (based on the reported ratio error for each of
the two technical replicates per treatment). These ratios
are then averaged using 1/Error as a weighting factor, and
significance is determined using the weighted standard
deviation as described in the ProteinPilot manual (ABI).

For the estimated abundance analysis of each identified
protein, the MS/MS data were also submitted to Mascot
2.2 for database searching using in-house licensed Mascot
local server against the same FlyBase FB2008_06 D. virilis
peptides database with one missed cleavage site by trypsin
allowed and iTRAQ-4-plex quantitation. The peptide tolerance was set to 1.2 Da and MS/MS tolerance was set to
0.6 Da. MMTS modification of cysteine and iTRAQ modification of N-terminal and lysine were fixed and a
methionine oxidation and iTRAQ modification of tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Only significant

analysis

scoring_help.html#PBM greater than "identity" were considered for the protein identifications. The exponentially
modified protein abundance index (emPAI) is obtained
for each identified protein from Mascot searching and the
corresponding protein content in mol percent is calculated as mol % = emPAI/Σ(emPAI) * 100 as reported previously [40]. For our analysis, we focus on the 144
proteins identified by both MASCOT and ProteinPilot, for
which we can calculate both a infected/uninfected ratio
and emPAI.
