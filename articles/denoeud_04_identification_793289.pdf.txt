Abstract
Background: Polymorphic tandem repeat typing is a new generic technology which has been
proved to be very efficient for bacterial pathogens such as B. anthracis, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa,
L. pneumophila, Y. pestis. The previously developed tandem repeats database takes advantage of the
release of genome sequence data for a growing number of bacteria to facilitate the identification of
tandem repeats. The development of an assay then requires the evaluation of tandem repeat
polymorphism on well-selected sets of isolates. In the case of major human pathogens, such as S.
aureus, more than one strain is being sequenced, so that tandem repeats most likely to be
polymorphic can now be selected in silico based on genome sequence comparison.
Results: In addition to the previously described general Tandem Repeats Database, we have
developed a tool to automatically identify tandem repeats of a different length in the genome
sequence of two (or more) closely related bacterial strains. Genome comparisons are precomputed. The results of the comparisons are parsed in a database, which can be conveniently
queried over the internet according to criteria of practical value, including repeat unit length,
predicted size difference, etc. Comparisons are available for 16 bacterial species, and the orthopox
viruses, including the variola virus and three of its close neighbors.
Conclusions: We are presenting an internet-based resource to help develop and perform tandem
repeats based bacterial strain typing. The tools accessible at http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr now
comprise four parts. The Tandem Repeats Database enables the identification of tandem repeats
across entire genomes. The Strain Comparison Page identifies tandem repeats differing between
different genome sequences from the same species. The "Blast in the Tandem Repeats Database"
facilitates the search for a known tandem repeat and the prediction of amplification product sizes.
The "Bacterial Genotyping Page" is a service for strain identification at the subspecies level.

Background
Molecular epidemiology, the integration of molecular
typing and conventional epidemiological studies, is likely
to add significant value to analyses of infections caused by

pathogenic bacteria (see [1] for review). Multilocus
Sequence Typing (MLST) for instance is now a major reference method for the molecular epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis and other human pathogens [2]. In this

The procedure to find polymorphic tandem repeats for use

data-management steps.

kind of assay, a set of typically 7 genes is partially
sequenced, and the resulting data is converted into
sequence types, which can be easily stored in databases,
and compared to others. However a number of significant
pathogens, including M. tuberculosis [3], B. anthracis and
Y. pestis [4] are not amenable to this approach, because of
the recent emergence of these pathogens and the resulting
rarity of sequence variations. In these pathogens, tandem
repeats (TRs) are a source of very informative markers for
strain genotyping [5-10]. Tandem repeats in pathogenic
bacteria were initially identified within genes associated
with bacterial virulence [11,12]. In other instances, the
contribution of tandem repeats to genome polymorphism
was established after extensive searches based for instance
on AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) profiling. This is well illustrated by B. anthracis, in which polymorphic bands in AFLP patterns [13] were subsequently
demonstrated by sequencing to be due to tandem repeat
variations [14]. Eventually, some of these tandem repeats
have been shown to directly contribute to phenotypic variations of the B. anthracis exosporium which makes the
outer layer of the spores [15]. The frequent observation
that tandem repeat-containing genes are often associated
with outer membrane proteins suggests that such genes
help bacteria adapt to their environment, and may be to
some extent mutation hotspots as a result of positive
selection.

TRF in the locus. "Number of alleles" refers to the number of predicted sizes differing by at least 5 bp among the strains

Polymorphic tandem repeats (VNTRs, for Variable
Number of Tandem Repeats), once identified, provide
convenient tools requiring ordinary molecular biology
equipment and the data can be easily exchanged and compared. The resulting assay, called MLVA (for multiple
locus VNTR analysis) can even be automated [16]. We
have developed tools which facilitate the bioinformatics
step of genome analysis required to start a project. A previously described Tandem Repeats Database enables the
identification of tandem repeats across entire genomes
[9,10,17-19]. It has been constantly updated, with now
more than a hundred bacterial genomes available, compared to 35 at the onset of the database. We present here
a new and major development of this resource which
takes advantage of the fact that more than two different
strains from the same species have now been sequenced at
least for a number of major human pathogens. As a result,
the tools accessible over the Internet at http://minisatel
lites.u-psud.fr now comprise four complementary parts.
The newly added resource, the Strain Comparison Page,
takes advantage of the availability of genome sequences
from more than one strain from a growing number of species to directly identify tandem repeats differing between
the sequenced strains. This is of interest because the vast
majority of tandem repeats is often not polymorphic [19].
The "Blast in the Tandem Repeats Database" page facilitates the search for a known tandem repeat, the prediction
of PCR amplification products size, and the verification of
primer specificity. Once an MLVA assay has been set up,
and carefully validated by typing collections of isolates, it
is relatively easy to construct databases of genotypes to be
used locally or which can be queried across the Internet.
The "Bacterial Genotyping Page" illustrates a freely accessible, fast and easy to use internet-based service for strain
comparisons, in which a user can compare a genotype
produced for one of his isolates to the existing data.

Construction and content
The Tandem Repeats Database main page
Tandem repeats were identified from finished microbial
genome sequences (as listed by the Genome OnLine
Database [20]) using the tandem repeats finder (TRF)
software [21,22] with the following options: alignment
parameters, "2,3,5" (these parameters are the less stringent ones), minimum alignment score to report repeat, 50
(this score allows to detect short structures), maximum
period size, 500 base-pairs. When the program reported
redundant (overlapping) repeats, the redundancy was
eliminated as described in [23], before import in the database. The database uses Microsoft Access 2000 and the
querying process uses Active Server Pages (ASP, Microsoft)
with Perlscripts or VBscripts. Perl was obtained from the
ActiveState Programmer Network [24]. The database is
hosted on a server running under Windows 2000 server

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/4

(Microsoft). The tandem repeats database main page is
described in more detail in [9].
The Strain Comparison page
Sequence comparisons used BLAST [25]. The BLAST software was obtained from the NCBI FTP site [26]. The flanking sequences of TRs from one strain were compared to
the whole sequence of the other strain (and reciprocally,
to avoid missing some tandem repeats that would not
appear in the tandem repeats database for one strain
because they were not detected by the Tandem Repeats
Finder [21] -for instance because there is only one copy of
the repeated unit in the considered strain). The resulting
list of matching tandem repeats was then imported in the
database, where it can be queried. The comparison of
more than two strains was made possible through a supplemental step before import in the database: the synthesis of several 2-strains comparisons, of the same
"reference" strain against each of the others (matching
between TRs of the different strains was deduced from the
positions on the reference strain).
The Blast page
The Blast Page allows users to run BLAST [25] in the tandem repeats and flanking sequences from the database via
Perlscripts. The Blast outputs are linked to the database, in
order to easily obtain the description of identified tandem
repeats.
The Bacterial Genotyping page
The web-page site performing identifications was developed using the BNserver application (version 3.0,
Applied-Maths, Belgium) and ASP (Microsoft) using Perlscript. The typing results (gel images and resulting data)
were managed using the Bionumerics software package as
described in [10]. The output of a query is a list of strains
and genotypes from the database together with similarity
scores.

Utility
The procedure to find polymorphic tandem repeats (TRs)
for use in strain typing
Figure 1 shows the steps leading from a genome sequence
to the exploitation of polymorphic tandem repeats for
bacterial strain genotyping. Although Tandem Repeats are
easily identified using the Tandem Repeats Database, TR
polymorphism must be evaluated by typing across a set of
relevant strains. If the sequences of several strains of the
species of interest are available, the Strain Comparison
Page can be used to directly identify tandem repeats predicted to be polymorphic in size between the two (or
more) sequenced strains. However, it is important to keep
in mind that the tandem repeats predicted as being polymorphic will depend on the sequenced strains and wellplanned surveys of isolates will still be necessary. The

available tools do not replace this validation step, as the
value of each marker must be carefully established on an
appropriate set of isolates. The definition of an appropriate set of isolates depends upon the question which is
being addressed, i.e. large scale or local epidemiology. The
Blast Page has been implemented in the tandem repeats
database in order to easily determine the size of the
expected PCR amplification products. The database is also
manually updated to contain PCR conditions as well as
polymorphism index, and links to the original reports
[27] (input from users is welcome). Eventually, when an
MLVA assay has been fully developed and validated, typing data can be made accessible so that individual queries
can be run. The Bacterial Genotyping Page illustrates how
this could work. The genotyping data for a strain can be
entered and submitted via this page. The output is the
description of the closest strains. The data which has been
submitted is not incorporated in the database itself, since
this would require stringent data validation steps. In the
following sections, we are presenting the web-based
resources associated with this procedure.
The "Strain Comparison" pages
The strain comparison pages are available via [28]. The
comparison of two strains is based on a pre-computed
BLAST [25] analysis of the flanking sequences of tandem
repeats from one strain against the other, and vice-versa.
Figure 2 summarizes the results of this first step for 23
comparisons. Three indexes are scored (see figure legend):
(1) the "mean %identity" between the flanking sequences
is a measure of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)
frequency (not insertions-deletions), (2) the proportion
(%) of flanking sequences that matched the flanking
sequence of its homologue in the other strain on more
than half of the 500 bp assayed here – i.e. that were not
rearranged, by insertion of mobile elements for instance , (3) the proportion (%) of tandem repeats that were
found to be of a different length between the two strains
being compared. In addition, the positions of matching
tandem repeats in the two genomes is plotted to reveal
large-scale genome rearrangements. A number of situations are observed: for instance Yersinia pestis orientalis
strain CO-92 [29], and medievalis strain KIM5 P12 [30]
show a very high "mean %identity" (99.96 %), in agreement with the recent emergence of Yersinia pestis [4]. In
spite of this, the two strains differ by a high number of
large rearrangements (as seen on the plot), which reflects
the high genome plasticity observed in this species [31],
together with a relatively high rate of polymorphic tandem repeats (8.47%). In contrast, Listeria monocytogenes
strain EGD-e and Listeria innocua strain Clip 11262 have a
lower homology (90.19%) and only 3.99% of polymorphic tandem repeats in spite of the evolutionary distance
(see Figure 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/4

The strain comparison page allows queries in the tandem
repeats database according to the tandem repeat length
difference between the two strains compared, and also to
other tandem repeats characteristics (unit length, copy
number, etc...). Figure 3 illustrates a query done for Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Rv and CDC1551 [32]:
the query "length difference ≥ 5 bp" identifies 58 tandem
repeats (8 are shown on Figure 3). This prediction has
been tested for the 30 loci amenable to PCR analysis and
polymorphism has been confirmed in all cases [10].
When more than two strains have been sequenced, a synthesis of the results of several 2-strains comparisons is also
available. Figure 4 illustrates a query made for Escherichia
coli strains O157:H7 Sakaï, O157:H7 EDL933, K12, and
UPEC-CFT073 [33-35]: 87 tandem repeats were found
with 2 to 4 alleles among the 4 strains (18 of which are
listed in Figure 4).
The "Blast in the Tandem Repeats Database" page
To facilitate the identification of already studied tandem
repeats, we implemented BLAST [25] against the tandem
repeats from the database, i.e. the tandem repeats themselves and their flanking sequences. The Blast page is
available at [36]. All bacteria can be queried at once,
which allows the identification of tandem repeats families, conserved in several bacterial species. Another page is
dedicated to the Blast of PCR primers and provides the
size of the PCR products in all the species/strains where
the primers match. Figure 5 shows the results of searching
the PCR primer pair from tandem repeat H37Rv_0024_18
bp [10] in all bacteria: as expected, the PCR primer pair
matches Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Rv and
CDC1551, providing different PCR product lengths.
The Bacterial Genotyping page
The Bacterial Genotyping page [37] provides one illustration on how tandem repeat typing data can be made available via internet to allow external users to query
genotyping data (Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the
moment) and compare a new strain to existing data as
previously described in [10]. For each locus, allele sizes
can be selected among a list of possibilities (observed
sizes). The results of the query indicate a similarity score
and include links to the complete data recorded for each
strain listed. This page is just meant as an illustration and
prototype. MLVA reference data could also be made available for downloading as tabular data files, or can be copied from published datasets, which can then be
complemented by in-house data, and analyzed by the
appropriate clustering software.

Discussion
Bacterial genomes evolution
As shown by the indexes from Figure 2, there are different
ways to represent the divergence/similarity between two
strains. They are not correlated, suggesting independent
evolution processes. First, the "mean %identity" between
two genomes reflects point mutations, and is an indicator
of the time passed since the two strains diverged. For

instance, Yersinia pestis is known to be of recent emergence
[4] and shows a high "mean %identity" between strains
CO-92 (orientalis) and KIM5 P12 (medievalis). In contrast, and as shown by the dot plot, large genome rearrangements occurred in this genome, which is
representative of a high genome plasticity [31]. The index
"% of flanking sequences not rearranged" is an indicator
of small-scale genome rearrangements, such as the inser-

tions of mobile elements. This index is low for genomes
rich in mobile elements, like Streptococcus agalactiae, in
which such elements significantly contribute to strain
diversity [38]. Finally, the index "% of polymorphic tandem repeats" between two strains represents the tandem
repeats evolution rate. For the moment, the mechanisms
of bacterial VNTRs mutations have not been precisely
investigated, but it seems likely to be independent of the
other processes mentioned, as there are no correlations
between the indexes. Figure 2 provides clues to assess
which typing method(s) will be efficient in the different
species. For instance, the two bacterial species Salmonella
typhimurium strain LT2 [39] and Shigella flexneri strain
2a301 [40] share only 86.06% of sequence identity,
clearly making the identification of matching tandem
repeats between the two species difficult and of low significance. MLVA analysis appears to be of highest interest for
the subspecies typing of highly monomorphic species
including Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and Brucella [9,10,41].
Strain comparison efficiency
The sequencing of more than one strain for some bacterial
species allows direct identification of polymorphic tandem repeats, assuming that no sequencing errors
occurred. Earlier investigations provide good reasons to
believe that tandem repeats in the size range considered
here (a few hundred base-pairs) are correctly sequenced,
and consequently, that the strain comparison data is reliable. As a negative control, the comparison of two independent sequences from the same strain of Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strain (C58), one from Cereon genomics [42]
and the other from Washington University [43], shows
that no length polymorphism is detected among tandem
repeats (Figure 2) between the two independent
sequences. As a positive control, the tandem repeats predicted to be polymorphic by genome sequence comparison between the two strains of M. tuberculosis have indeed
been proved polymorphic by PCR typing of isolates [10].

Selection based on comparison of sequence data from two
strains will miss some polymorphic loci. Indeed, the
results provided by the approach rely upon the phylogenetic distance between the two strains being compared. If
the strains are very closely related, only a few TRs will be
found different between them, but these tandem repeats
will probably be the most polymorphic ones. Conversely,
if the strains are distant in the phylogenetic tree, a larger
number of polymorphic TRs will be found, some of them
will be only moderately polymorphic. Obviously, when a
few well-selected strains have been sequenced, it is likely
that very few polymorphic tandem repeats are undetected
in the Strain Comparison pages.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/4

It is of course still going to be very important to determine
the TR allele frequency for isolates carefully selected to be
representative of the global diversity of a given pathogen
before suggesting the configuration of an MLVA assay to
use in subsequent studies. In addition, those TR markers
that are highly polymorphic in diverse test panels of isolates may be monomorphic when applied to isolates
responsible for local outbreaks. The configuration of TR
markers used to make up an assay needs to be determined
empirically with representative local isolates and tailored
to the study population and study questions.
Polymorphic tandem repeats selection for species with
only one sequenced strain
The identification of simple criteria able to predict tandem repeat polymorphism when genome sequence data is
available for only one strain would indeed greatly facilitate the development of MLVA assays. It would seem reasonable for instance to expect that the number of copies
and the internal homogeneity of tandem arrays are strong
predictors [23]. We take advantage here of the many strain
comparisons which are made available via the strain comparison pages to evaluate such criteria.

We have analyzed bacteria with at least three sequenced
genomes (Staphylococcus aureus: 6 strains, Escherichia coli: 4
strains, Streptococcus pyogenes: 4 strains and Salmonella
typhi and typhimurium: 3 strains). We assume that in such
cases, only a few polymorphic tandem repeats are missed
in the comparisons. We compared the distribution of tandem repeats sequence characteristics among the group of
"polymorphic" loci (differing in at least two of the strains
compared, excluding length differences between strains
that resulted from microdeletions in the flanking
sequences) and the others. Comparisons were performed
for the following sequence characteristics: unit length,
copy number, total length, %GC, GC bias (=|%G-%C|/
(%G+%C)), %matches, and HistoryR (a score derived
from tandem repeat history reconstruction algorithm [44]
as described in [23]). None of the variables were normally
distributed, as tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, so a
non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare the
distributions, which were judged significantly different at
the .05 level of the statistic (2 tailed). Distributions were
significantly different for all 4 species studied for
%matches, total length and copy number. As shown on
Figure 6, polymorphic TRs have a higher internal conservation and total length than monomorphic ones. Copy
number, which is correlated with total length, is also
higher among polymorphic TRs.
Selecting the longest and most conserved tandem repeats
should thus improve polymorphic TRs identification.
Table 1 illustrates the query "total length ≥ 80 bp and
%matches ≥ 80%" applied to the four species used to find

predictive criteria. For all four species, the group fulfilling
the criterion is, as expected, enriched in polymorphic (at
least two alleles) tandem repeats: in Staphyloccocus aureus,
polymorphic tandem repeats represent only 8.5% of the
whole population of tandem repeat loci but are predominant (87%) in the criterion positive group. The enrichment is even greater for highly polymorphic TRs, i.e. with
3 alleles or more: for example from 4.5% in the whole set
to 66% in the positive group for Staphylococcus aureus.
However this simple criterion misses more than half of
the polymorphic loci. In addition, the efficiency of the criterion is highly variable in the different species: it is rela-

tively satisfying in Staphylococcus aureus (54% of
polymorphic tandem repeats would be missed) but very
inefficient in Streptococcus pyogenes (almost 90% are
missed). The results for highly polymorphic loci (3 alleles
or more) are more consistent (the proportion of TRs with
3 alleles or more detected by the criterion ranges from
58% for Escherichia coli to 100% for Salmonella).
It is tempting to speculate that these observations are
applicable to other species. Subsequently, we applied the
criterion to ten of the 2-strains comparisons available on
the Strain Comparison Page (Table 2). In all ten instances,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/4

the criterion positive group is enriched in TRs with different lengths between the two strains, compared to the
whole set. This proportion varies from less than 3% in
Streptococcus agalactiae to more than 20% in Xylella fastidiosa in the whole set. It is increased to 33% and 93%
respectively among the set of loci which satisfy the criterion (these percentages correspond to the predictor's specificity), but the vast majority of polymorphic loci will be
missed (90% and 80% respectively). Sensitivity, that is %
of the TRs with different lengths that were detected by criterion varies from 6.90% for Brucella to 44.26% for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Availability

The finding that polymorphic tandem repeats have, on
average, a higher internal conservation, total length, and
copy number than monomorphic ones is in agreement
with previous observations that TR polymorphism is correlated with conservation in Yersinia pestis and with total
length in Bacillus anthracis [9]. It is also reminiscent of the
behavior of microsatellites (also called short sequence
repeats: SSR, see [45] for review), which are stabilized by
internal variations [46] and by reduction of the number of
repeats [47]. Unfortunately, we show here that such simple prediction criteria may miss a very large proportion of
polymorphic tandem repeats, and provide highly variable
results in different species. This indicates that, in the
absence of sequence data from two strains or more, the
systematic testing of tandem repeats polymorphism
across a set of relevant strains remains the most appropriate way to develop an MLVA assay. Consequently, the
Strain Comparison page is of great use when two strains
or more have been sequenced.

Conclusions
Bacterial strain typing at the subspecies level is essential
for epidemiological issues in the context of disease control. This can be used to determine if an S. aureus or P. aeruginosa infection for instance has been acquired in an
hospital environment or not. On a larger scale, it can be
used to trace the emergence of new, more virulent or drug
resistant M. tuberculosis strains. It is also of interest in the
field of bioterrorism and bioweapons control, as was
shown by the investigations following the 2001 B.
anthracis attacks. Tandem repeats typing has recently
emerged as one way to address this issue. Indeed, in the
case of a number of highly monomorphic bacterial species, including B. anthracis and Y. pestis, tandem repeats
typing is the method of choice for subspecies typing. In
addition to the fact that these loci represent an important
fraction of the existing polymorphism, it offers a number
of practical advantages, including the ease of typing, and
of data exchanges among different countries. It is hoped
that the tools which are described here will help evaluate
the potential of tandem repeats typing assays for a larger
range of pathogens.
