Abstract

Reconstructing the tree of life is one of the major challenges
in biology [1]. Although several attempts to derive the phylogenetic relationships among eukaryotes have been published
[2,3], the validity of many taxonomic groupings is still heavily

debated [1]. The major reason for this is the fact that molecular phylogenies based on single genes often lead to apparently
conflicting results (for a review, see [4]). Only recently has the
application of genome-scale approaches to phylogenetic
inference (phylogenomics) been introduced to overcome this

Conclusion: Our analysis of the myosins allowed combining phylogenetic information derived
from class-specific trees with the information of myosin class evolution and distribution. This
approach is expected to result in superior accuracy compared to single-gene or phylogenomic
analyses because the orthology problem is resolved and a strong determinant not depending on
any technical uncertainties is incorporated, the class distribution. Combining our analysis of the
myosins with high quality analyses of other protein families, for example, that of the kinesins, could
help in resolving still questionable dependencies at the origin of eukaryotic life.

Results: Here, we have reconstructed the tree of eukaryotic life based on the analysis of 2,269
myosin motor domains from 328 organisms. All sequences were manually annotated and verified,
and were grouped into 35 myosin classes, of which 16 have not been proposed previously. The
resultant phylogenetic tree confirms some accepted relationships of major taxa and resolves
disputed and preliminary classifications. We place the Viridiplantae after the separation of
Euglenozoa, Alveolata, and Stramenopiles, we suggest a monophyletic origin of Entamoebidae,
Acanthamoebidae, and Dictyosteliida, and provide evidence for the asynchronous evolution of the
Mammalia and Fungi.

deposited research

Background: The evolutionary history of organisms is expressed in phylogenetic trees. The most
widely used phylogenetic trees describing the evolution of all organisms have been constructed
based on single-gene phylogenies that, however, often produce conflicting results. Incongruence
between phylogenetic trees can result from the violation of the orthology assumption and
stochastic and systematic errors.

limitation [5,6]. In this context, large and diverse gene families are often considered unhelpful for reconstructing ancient
evolutionary relationships because of the accompanying difficulties in distinguishing homologs from paralogs and
orthologs [7]. However, if the different homologs can be
resolved, the analysis of a large gene family provides several
advantages compared to a single gene analysis, because it
provides additional information on the evolution of gene
diversity for reconstructing organismal evolution. In addition, direct information on duplication events involving part
of a genome or whole genomes can be obtained. Such an analysis requires a large and divergent gene family and sufficient
taxon sampling. It is advantageous if the taxa are closely
related, to provide the necessary statistical basis for subfamilies, as well as spread over many branches of eukaryotic
life, to cover the highest diversity possible. Today, sequencing
of more than 300 genomes from all branches of eukaryotic
life has been completed [8]. In addition, many of these
sequences are derived from comparative genomic sequencing
efforts (for example, the sequencing of 12 Drosophila species), providing the statistical basis for excluding artificial
relationships.
The myosins constitute one of the largest and most divergent
protein families in eukaryotes [9]. They are characterized by
a motor domain that binds to actin in an ATP-dependent
manner, a neck domain consisting of varying numbers of IQ
motifs, and amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of
various lengths and functions [10]. Myosins are involved in
many cellular tasks, such as organelle trafficking [11], cytokinesis [12], maintenance of cell shape [13], muscle contraction
[14], and others. Myosins are typically classified based on
phylogenetic analyses of the motor domain [15].
Recently, two analyses of myosin proteins describing conflicting findings have been published [16,17]. Both disagree with
previously established models of myosin evolution (reviewed
in [18]). These analyses are based on 150 myosins from 20
species grouped into 37 myosin classes [17] and 267 myosins
from 67 species in 24 classes [16], respectively. However, the
number of taxa and sequences included was not sufficient to
provide the necessary statistical basis for myosin classification and for reconstructing the tree of eukaryotic life.
Here, we present the comparative genomic analysis of 2,269
myosins found in 328 organisms. Based on the myosin class
content of each organism and the positions of each organism's single myosins in the phylogenetic tree of the myosin
motor domains, we reconstructed the tree of eukaryotic life.

Results
Identification of myosin genes
Wrongly predicted genes are the main reason for wrong
results in domain predictions, multiple sequence alignments
and phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, we have taken special

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R196

care in the identification and annotation of the myosin
sequences. We have collected all myosin genes that have
either been derived from the isolation of single genes and submitted to the nr database at NCBI, or that we obtained by
manually analysing the data of whole genome sequencing and
expressed sequence tag (EST)-sequencing projects. Gene
annotation by manually inspecting the genomic DNA
sequences was the only way to get the best dataset possible
because the sequences derived by automatic annotation processes contained mispredicted exons in almost all genes (for an
in-depth discussion of the problems and pitfalls of automatic
gene annotation, gene collection, domain prediction and
sequence alignment, see Additional data file 1). These predicted genes contain errors derived from including intronic
sequence and/or leaving out exons, as well as wrong predictions of start and termination sites. Automatic gene prediction programs are also not able to recognize that parts of a
gene belong together if these are spread over two or several
different contigs. Often they also fail to identify all homologs
in a certain organism. The only way to circumvent these problems is to perform a manual comparative genomic analysis. In
addition, datasets with automatically predicted model transcripts are available for only a small part of all sequenced
genomes.
The basis of our analysis was a very accurate multiple
sequence alignment. In cases of less conserved amino acid
stretches, the corresponding DNA regions of several organisms have been analyzed in parallel, aiming to identify coding
regions and shared intron splice sites. Thus, our dataset was
generated by an iterative gene identification (using
TBLASTN) and gene annotation process, meaning that most
of the myosin sequences have been reanalyzed as soon as data
from closely related organisms or further species specific data
(new cDNA/EST data or a new assembly version) became
available. In addition to manually annotating the myosins
from genomic data, it was also absolutely necessary to reanalyze previously published data, as these also contain many
sequencing errors (especially sequences produced in the last
century) and wrongly predicted translations.
The myosin dataset contains 2,269 sequences from 328
organisms (Table 1), of which 1,941 have been derived from
181 whole genome sequencing (WGS) projects. Of all myosin
sequences, 1,634 are complete (from the amino terminus to
the carboxyl terminus) while parts of the sequence are missing for 635. Sequences for which a small part is missing (up to
5%) were termed 'Partials' while sequences for which a considerable part is missing were termed 'Fragments'. This difference has been introduced because Partials are not expected
to considerably influence the phylogenetic analysis. Indeed,
even long loops like the approximately 300 amino acid loop1 of the Arthropoda variant C class-I myosins can either be
included or excluded from the analysis without changing the
resulting trees (data not shown). Eight of the myosins were
termed pseudogenes because they contain proven single

information

Class-I and class-II by far comprise the most myosins (Figure
1a). Class-I myosins were found in almost all organisms, and
class-II myosins have undergone several gene duplications
(either resulting from whole genome or single gene duplications), leading to up to 22 class-II myosins per vertebrate
organism. Although the total numbers of myosins per class
are biased by the sequenced species, we expect class-I and
class-II to remain the largest classes even if many other spe-

cies not containing any of these classes (for example, the
plants and Alveolata) are sequenced in the future (Figure 1b).
For example, the numbers of species of the Chordata and the
Viridiplantae lineage for which myosin data are available are
similar. However, the number of myosins for each of these
species is very different, with the Chordata species encoding
up to three times more myosins. In contrast, the number of
sequenced Fungi species (over 90 organisms) is almost twice
as high as the number of Chordata species, but the number of
Fungi myosins is only a quarter of that of the Chordata
myosins.

Nomenclature
The amount of produced data spread over all eukaryotic kingdoms now allows and demands a consistent, systematic, and
extendable nomenclature. Here, we introduce the following
nomenclature, which builds on the already established system [15,18-20] and tries to keep as many of the existing
names as possible. Nevertheless, it changes some of the
already used names, thus getting rid of sequence-specific and
species-specific exceptions. We are aware of the confusion

that this might introduce about the names of some sequences,
but given the fact that the amount of annotated data known
before finishing this analysis (about 250-300 sequences) was
very small compared to the data presented here, it was necessary for us to introduce an appropriate nomenclature. Otherwise the number of exceptions would soon exceed the number
of consistently named sequences. We are also aware that different names and classifications have recently been introduced in the literature [16,17]. However, these results were

Classes are numbered according to their discovery. Thus, we
keep all previously accepted class designations [18]. Recent
further class designations [16,22] are based on data analyses
of very small datasets of wrongly annotated myosins and will
not be considered. Richards and Cavalier-Smith [17] have
also used wrongly annotated myosins in their analysis and
have developed a completely new classification not consistent

The abbreviation of the protein is Myo. In the case of the
class-II myosins, the abbreviations Mhc and Mys are used in
the literature. As class-II comprises by far the most sequences
and as numbers have very often been introduced as variant
designations (for example, human Mys1, Mys2, and so on),
we decided to keep the class-II abbreviation as an exception
of the proteins general abbreviation. We decided to use Mhc
as protein abbreviation for class-II myosins as the abbreviation Mys has been used only for mammalian members while
all other class-II myosins have been named Mhc. If the classII myosins were named Myo2 (in accordance with the other
myosin classes) we would have to also rename their variant
designations to avoid confusion with other classes (for example, Myo21 could be a class-II myosin variant 1 or a class-XXI
myosin).

Abbreviation of the protein

reports

In general, species are abbreviated by using the first letters of
their systematic names (for example, Dm for Drosophila melanogaster). However, there are many species, that would
have the same abbreviation, and in these cases we added the
second letter of the first part of the name (for example, Drm
for Drosophila mimetica). Different strains of the same species are differentiated by adding lowercase letters separated
by an underscore (for example, Pf_a for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, Pf_b for Plasmodium falciparum Ghanaian Isolate, Pf_c for Plasmodium falciparum HB3, Pf_d for
Plasmodium falciparum Dd2).

with any previous classification. As has been agreed upon in
the past, new classes should be designated only if members of
different organisms contribute. We have been very conservative in our analysis in designating new classes, assigning new
classes only if several species contribute (for example, classXXI, all Arthropoda), or very divergent species contribute (for
example, class-XXIX, Thallassiosira pseudonana, Phytophthora sp. and others), or, if the species are closely related, several homologs of each species contribute (for example, classXXX, Phytophthora sp. and Hyaloperonospora parasitica).
It is obvious, that class separation improves as more and
more divergent sequences are added. In particular, the
myosins of very divergent species (for example, Phytophthora sp., Thallassiosira pseudonana, Tetrahymena thermophila, Paramecium tetrarelia) tend to group mainly with
the homologs of the same organism. Our experience showed
that if more sequences of closely related species are added
(for example, sequences of Phytophthora ramorum, Phytophthora infestans, and Phytophthora sojae), the class separation improves, and improves further if sequences of more
divergent species are added (Hyaloperonospora parasitica).
But in most of these cases the separation is still not good
enough to distinguish between a class separation and just a
variant separation. Thus, we designated only classes that are
well-supported and separated. There are 24 classes supported
by bootstrap values higher than 985 (out of 1,000; Additional
data file 2) and 5 are supported by bootstrap values higher
than 874. Class-I has the widest taxonomic distribution and is
supported by a bootstrap value of 788. Class-XXVIII (bootstrap value of 750), class-V (593) class-XXIII (463) and classXV (305) show the lowest bootstrap values, but are well separated from any neighboring class. We left groups of
sequences (for example, the Tetrahymena thermophila and
Paramecium tetrarelia myosins) unclassified, although their
first node in the tree might be supported by a relatively high
bootstrap value. A similar situation would exist if only five
sequences of class-VII, class-X, and class-XV myosins were
known; in this case, these sequences would certainly group
together, supported by a high bootstrap value of the first
node, as they are far more similar to each other than to the
other myosins. Adding more homologs showed these myosins
to be separated into three classes, and we expect a similar
class separation for the myosins of, for example, Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetrarelia if more
sequences of closely related species are added.

reviews

The nomenclature is simply as follows and in agreement with
what most people in the field already use. The names of the
sequences consist of four parts: the abbreviation of the species' systematic name; the abbreviation of the protein; the
class designation; and the variant designation.

comment

derived from analyses of small datasets based on many incorrectly assembled sequences and, thus, wrongly annotated
myosins, and we have not found a way to incorporate the
small part of matching data into our system. We also think
that even if we introduce some confusion to certain researchers in the field, there is a strong necessity to have an appropriate nomenclature to manage existing and upcoming data.
CyMoBase, which we have developed to provide access to all
myosin sequence data [21], uses the new nomenclature, provides links to previously used names, and can be used as
reference.

sequence name. Alternative splice forms of the same gene get
the same protein name. All myosins that cannot be classified
at the moment will be considered as 'orphan' myosins. If several orphans exist in a species, they get a variant designation.
Orphan names are considered to be preliminary names. Thus,
orphan myosins will be renamed as soon as more sequences
are available that allow a well-supported classification.

Classification
The basis for the classification of the myosins is the phylogenetic relation of their myosin motor domains [15,18]. The
data for the myosins is now strong enough that all designated
classes are well supported. Including or excluding sets of
myosins (for example, the orphans) does not change the phylogeny of the other classes as has been observed for the small
dataset used in previous analyses [16]. Also, including or
excluding large insertions like the loop-1 insertion of the
class-I variant C myosins of Arthropoda does not change the
tree.
In contrast to other suggestions, we do not agree with the idea
that the tail domain architectures should also be considered
in the classification process [16,17]. Our analysis shows that
the motor domains and the tails coevolved in most of the
assigned classes, but there are many exceptions now where
the separation of organismal lineages occurred before the
adaptation of further tail domains. It does not make sense to
artificially 'force' sequences together only because there is not
enough sequence data for a better classification. If, for example, the class-XII myosins should be related to the class-XV
myosins only because they also contain MyTH4 and Ferm
domains [16], then they could also be grouped with the classVII, class-X, or class-XXII myosins. Many other myosins
from Stramenopiles or Amoeba would also have to be
grouped with these classes as they also contain MyTH4 and
Ferm domains. This seems very arbitrary. Also, several
domains, such as the PH domain, Ankyrin repeats or the Pkinase domain, are found on either the amino terminus or the
carboxyl terminus of the myosins. Many of the tail regions
have also not been analyzed specifically (domains have not
been defined yet). Thus, as soon as further domains are
defined other myosin classes might unexpectedly share tail
regions. It is also not reasonable to consider the organismal
distribution of myosins as a classification helper as has been
proposed [16]. The species sequenced cover only an extremely
small part of all organisms, and their selection has also been
biased in favor of financial, medical and other interests. It is
not reasonable, therefore, to assume that the organisms that
we have data for are the best representatives with regard to
the myosin diversity of their taxa. For example, even the wellstudied Drosophila melanogaster has lost the class-XXII
myosin that the closely related species Drosophila willistoni
and other Drosophila species still have. Other Arthropoda
(Daphnia, Apis, Anopheles) have additional myosins belonging to well established classes (for example, a class-III myosin
and a class-IX myosin) that all Drosophila species (that have

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R196

been sequenced so far) have lost. The same is true for nematodes, where a class-XVIII myosin is found in Brugia malayi
and not in Caenorhabditis species. It is very unlikely, therefore, that myosins that do not group to any of the other
assigned metazoan myosins (for example, the class-XII
myosins) are closely related to one of the metazoan classes,
although they might share some domains in the tail regions.
It is far more likely that a class-XII myosin will be found in
another metazoa species (as, for example, a class-XX myosin
has been found in Echinodermata in addition to Arthropoda),
or that a class-XV myosin, to which the class-XII myosins
have artificially been grouped [16], will be found in another
nematode (as, for example, a class-XVIII myosin has been
found in Brugia malayi). Both possibilities will support the
current class designation. Nevertheless, at the moment it
seems that all sequenced lineages have developed their own
specific myosin, for example, the class-XVI myosins in vertebrates, the class-XXI myosins in Arthropoda, and the classXII myosins in Nematoda.
Fragments have been classified and named based on their
obvious homology at the amino acid level. Those Fragments
that did not obviously group to one of the assigned classes
have sequentially been added to the dataset used to construct
the major tree. Some of these Fragments could subsequently
be classified; others have to be considered as orphans. Note
that even very short fragments of only 100 amino acids are
sufficient for proper classification. Thus, it is very unlikely
that the orphan Fragments will group to one of the established 35 classes if their full-length sequences become
available.

Renamed myosins
Change of previous classification
Class-IV contains only one myosin. According to the nomenclature guidelines outlined above, this myosin would not be
designated as a class but would be considered as an orphan.
So as not to cause confusion, we did not change its classification from class-IV myosin, expecting that more members will
be added as soon as further genomes are sequenced. However, our phylogenetic tree shows that the former class-XIII
myosins (of the algae Acetabularia cliftonii) belong to the
class-XI myosins, supported by a bootstrap value of 999.
Therefore, we reclassified the former Acetabularia class-XIII
myosins as class-XI myosins, and assigned the class-XIII to a
Kinetoplastida specific myosin class. The Drosophila melanogaster NinaC protein has previously been classified as a
class-III myosin. However, other Arthropoda contain real
class-III myosins (or more precisely, homologs to the mammalian class-III myosins) and NinaC as well as the NinaC
homologs of the other Arthropoda form a distinct class. We
decided not to rename all the mammalian class-III myosins
but to rename NinaC and introduce the new class-XXI.

The domain organizations of the orphan myosins of the
Fungi/Metazoa lineage are shown in Figure 4. The Microsporida have two myosins, one class-II myosin and an orphan
myosin containing a DIL domain that is also shared by classV and class-XI myosins. In contrast to these classes, the
Microsporida orphan myosins do not have any IQ motifs,
thus lacking the ability to bind calmodulin-like light chains.
The wasp Nasonia vitripennis has an orphan myosin that has
a similar domain organization to the class-V and class-XI
myosins, although it has less IQ motifs and its coiled-coil
region is considerably shorter. This myosin is unique to all
Arthropoda species sequenced so far. A myosin very similar in
domain organization to the fungal class-XVII myosins has
been found in the mollusc Atrina rigida. It has 12 transmembrane domains separated by a chitin synthetase domain. The

The analysis of the phylogenetic tree of the 2,269 myosin
motor domain sequences resulted in the definition of 35
myosin classes (Figures 2 and 3; Additional data file 2), of
which 19 classes have been assigned and described previously
[18]. Our analysis supports and retains the existing classification except for the former class-XIII, which consisted of two
myosins from the chlorophyte Acetabularia peniculus
(Acetabularia cliftonii). The former class-XIII was substituted by a Kinetoplastide-specific class consisting of myosins
with an amino-terminal SH3-like domain, a coiled-coil
region, and two tandem UBA domains. Five new classes,
class-XX, class-XXI, class-XXII, class-XXVIII, and classXXXV, are specific to Metazoan species. So far, class-XX has
been found only in arthropods and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and consists of myosins with a long,
coiled-coil region containing an amino-terminal domain and
a short neck composed of one IQ motif. The myosins of classXXI are very similar to the class-III myosins in their domain

Thirty-five myosin classes

Five of the new myosin classes (class-XXIII to class-XXVII)
are composed solely of Apicomplexan myosins. The domain
organizations of these myosins have been described elsewhere [16] but classes have not been assigned yet. Another six
new myosin classes were attributed to Stramenopiles myosins
(class-XXIX to class-XXXIV). Class-XXIX shows the highest
taxonomic sampling, consisting of members from all Stramenopiles species. Class-XXIX myosins have very long tail
domains consisting of three IQ motifs, short coiled-coil
regions, up to 18 CBS domains, a PB1 domain, and a carboxyterminal transmembrane domain. The myosin classes XXX to
XXXIV contain only members from Phytophthora species
and the closely related Hyaloperonospora parasitica.
Although the taxonomic sampling is quite low, these classes
have distinct motor domains and unique tail domain organizations. Myosins of class-XXX are composed of an amino-terminal SH3-like domain, two IQ motifs, a coiled-coil region
and a PX domain. Class-XXXI myosins have a very long neck
region consisting of 17 IQ motifs and two tandem Ankyrin
repeats separated by a PH domain. Class-XXXII myosins do
not contain any IQ motifs but a tandem MyTH4 and FERM
domain. The myosins of class-XXXIII have long amino-terminal regions with an amino-terminal PH domain. ClassXXXIV myosins are composed of one IQ motif, a short coiledcoil region, five tandem Ankyrin repeats, and a carboxy-terminal FYVE domain.

reports

Some of the plant and algae myosins were given arbitrary
names in the past, especially those from Helianthus annuus
and Arabidopsis thaliana. This happened before genome
data became available but has not been changed since [25].
We have renamed these few myosins. Some of the vertebrate
class-II myosins have also been renamed based on their homology to myosins from closely related organisms. In particular, descriptive names (for example, 'nonmuscle myosin II' or
'fast skeletal muscle myosin') have been disbanded in favor of
numerical variant designations as suggested [18].

organization but contain distinct motor domains. The classXXII myosins are defined by two tandem MyTH4 and FERM
domains. Most Metazoan species have lost their class-XXVIII
myosin. So far, class-XXVIII myosins have been identified
only in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, the frog
Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, and some fishes. From the
data available it seems that the species of the Acanthopterygii
branch of the fishes (including Takifugu rubripes and Gasterosteus aculeatus) have lost the class-XXVIII myosins. The
tail regions of class-XXVIII myosins consist of an IQ motif, a
short coiled-coil region and an SH2 domain.

reviews

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae myosins have previously been
named numerically [24], thus leading to confusion with class
numbers. In addition, several yeast species have now been
sequenced that separated before some of the gene and whole
genome duplication events happened during yeast evolution.
Most of the sequenced yeast species contain only one version
of the class-I and class-V myosins, and Naumovia castellii
contains one class-I but two class-V myosins. It is not possible
to name the newly identified yeast myosins according to the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae myosins. Therefore, we renamed
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae myosins according to our
nomenclature.

Odronitz and Kollmar R196.7

comment

The apicomplexan myosins have traditionally been named
alphabetically [16,23]. However, even different splice forms
of the same gene received different protein names. In
addition, gene and genome duplication events have led to,
and will continue to lead to, confusing naming. Thus, it is not
possible to name these myosins consistently in an alphabetical manner and to provide consistency for the future. We
renamed the apicomplexan myosins according to our nomenclature, introducing some apicomplexan-specific myosin
classes. Nevertheless, we tried to keep the former letters as
variants where possible.

Alveolata lineage

For the phylogenetic analysis of the myosin motor domains
we created a structure-guided manual sequence alignment
whose quality is far beyond any computer-generated alignment. It is obvious that all secondary structure elements of
the class-II myosin motor domain structure remain conserved in all myosins, even in the most divergent homologs.
Sequence motifs that would not have been aligned at first
glance were placed based on the analysis of their supposed
three-dimensional counterparts, which always maintained
the structural integrity of the respective region. Thus, strong
sequence variation and sequence insertions were limited to
loop regions. Based on the phylogenetic tree constructed from
1,984 myosin motor domains, 35 classes have been assigned
(Figures 2 and 3; Additional data files 2 and 3). There are 149
myosins that still remain unclassified due to our conservative
view on designating classes but it is anticipated that sequencing of further genomes will result in their classification and
will substantially increase the existing number of classes. For

Orphan myosins from other taxa are shown in Figure 7. The
Dictyostelium discoideum orphan myosins have been discussed elsewhere [26]. The amoeba-flagellate Naegleria gruberi has three orphan myosins having only coiled-coil regions
in the tail. The unicellular red alga Galdieria sulphuraria
contains one myosin with a unique domain organization consisting of at least nine IQ motifs followed by an AAA domain

All myosin protein sequences have been derived by manually
inspecting the corresponding DNA, either the published
cDNA or genomic DNA, or the genomic DNA provided by
sequencing centers. Published sequences contained errors in
many cases, either from sequencing or from manual annotation, while automatic annotations provided by the sequencing
centers resulted in mispredicted exons in almost all transcripts. For many sequences, the prediction of the correct
exons was only possible with the help of the analysis of the
homologs of related species. Thus, not only has the quantity
of myosin data increased as more and more genomes have
been analyzed but also the quality as all ambiguous regions
could be resolved for those sequences for which data from a
closely related organism are available. Therefore, mispredicted exons may be limited to a few orphan myosins.

Discussion

refereed research

Although they share only the class-I myosins, the Stramenopiles species show a similar myosin diversity as the metazoan
species (Figure 6). So far, three Phytophthora species and the
closely related Hyaloperonospora parasitica have been
sequenced; all share the same set of myosins. The orphan
myosins of this group have not been classified because it is
not clear from the phylogenetic tree where to draw class
boundaries. However, it is obvious that the Myo-A to Myo-H
and the Myo-Q to Myo-U orphans form distinct groups. The
domain organizations of the myosins within these groups are
also very different. To resolve their classification, further data
from more distantly related species are needed. The genome
sequences of two diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and
Thalassiosira pseudonana, have also been finished. Both
species share several sequences, but Thalassiosira pseudonana has a higher myosin diversity, having myosins with
HEAT or Mis14 domains that do not exist in any other
myosin.

There are three species whose genome sequences are available and that do not contain any myosin: the unicellular red
alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the flagellated protozoan
parasite Giardia lamblia, and the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.

Several of the Alveolata myosins could not be classified (Figure 5). All Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium
tetraurelia myosins remain ungrouped. The tails of the Paramecium tetraurelia myosins contain only IQ motifs, coiledcoil regions, and RCC1 domains, while some of the Tetrahymena thermophila myosins also contain FERM or MyTH4
domains. However, the FERM and MyTH4 domains never
appear in tandem like in class-VII, class-X, or class-XXII

been assembled independently, providing two slightly different versions for each myosin gene. The seven orphan myosins
of Trypanosoma cruzi contain amino-terminal SH3-like
domains, IQ motifs, or coiled-coil regions.

reviews

choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis has 16 orphan myosins
of different domain organizations. Due to missing genome
sequence data of closely related species, all these gene predictions are preliminary (especially the tail regions) and might
change in the future. Some of the predicted orphan myosins
contain domains unique to all myosins analyzed so far, like
the SAM and the Vicilin-N domains. Seven sequences contain
SH2 domains as have been found in the class-XXVIII
myosins.

The second myosin class to develop during the evolution of
the Fungi and Metazoa kingdoms was class-V. The plants
have developed two kingdom-specific classes. However, the
domain organization of the plant-specific class-XI is similar
to that of class-V, suggesting that both had a common ancestor. In contrast to the class-I myosins, the class-V and classXI myosins have diverged so far that a common ancestry is
not visible beyond their general domain organization. After
separation of the plant lineage, the class-II myosins arose.
The protists Entamoeba sp., Acanthamoeba castellanii, Naegleria gruberi, and Dictyostelium discoideum have closely
related myosins, suggesting that they share a common ancestor that diverged shortly before the Fungi and Metazoa split.
While the Entamoebidae have lost their class-V myosin,
retaining only a class-I and a class-II myosin, the Acanthamoebidae, Dictyosteliida, and Heterolobosea have developed several additional specific myosins with unique domain
organizations, in addition to the increase in the number of
myosin genes through single gene or whole genome
duplications. The Acanthamoebidae and Dictyosteliida
already contain the combination of the myosin motor domain
and the MyTH4 domain that is also widely found in the
metazoan lineage. However, a lack of genomic data prevents
the designation of a common myosin motor domain-MyTH4
containing ancestor. The fungi developed the class-XVII

Our survey of the myosin gene family now allows the reconstruction of the tree of 328 eukaryotes (Figure 8). The organisms of the major clades Fungi/Metazoa, Euglenozoa,
Stramenopiles and Alveolata have distinct sets of myosin
classes (except class-I), showing that horizontal gene transfer
of myosins has not happened in later stages of eukaryotic evolution. However, we cannot exclude yet that horizontal gene
transfer of myosins has not happened at the origin of eukaryotic evolution. Hence, only paralogs and orthologs have to be
resolved. Figure 8 represents a schematic reconstruction of
both the phylogenetic relationships of major taxa reconstructed from class-specific trees as well as the information
on myosin class evolution and distribution. For example, Tetrahymena thermophila, Perkinsus marinus, Toxoplasma
gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Babesia bovis have all
been classified as Alveolata. However, the relation between
Ciliophora (Tetrahymena thermophila), Perkinsea (Perkinsus marinus), and Apicomplexa (Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Babesia bovis) has not been
resolved yet. Tetrahymena thermophila does not share any
myosin with the other Alveolata and should, therefore, have
diverged before the other species. Perkinsus marinus shares
two myosin classes with the Apicomplexa. Thus, they must
have had a common ancestor. The Apicomplexa developed
three further common classes, of which single classes have

reports

The highest number of myosins in a single organism has been
found in Brachydanio rerio (61 myosins grouped into 13
classes) while the broadest class distribution is expected for
the Phytophthora species (25 myosins grouped into at least 15
classes). The high numbers of vertebrate myosin genes in
general are due to several whole genome duplications that
happened after the separation from the Craniata and Urochordata [27].

The class-I myosins show the widest taxonomic distribution
and are devoid of the amino-terminal SH3-like domain and
are thus suggested to be the first myosins to have evolved (see
below). Only two major lineages, the Viridiplantae and the
Alveolata, do not contain class-I myosins (Figure 8). The
Alveolata have either lost the class-I myosin, or their class-I
myosin diverged so far that a common ancestor could not be
reconstructed. The Apicomplexa developed several specific
classes, while the Ciliophora myosins cannot be classified yet.
The evolutionary history of the Euglenozoa and
Stramenopiles cannot be further resolved because both do
not share any further myosin classes with other species, and
their taxonomic sampling is not high enough for a more precise grouping.

generating the tree it does not matter whether long loop
regions (for example, the 300 amino acid loop-1 of the
Arthropoda Myo1C proteins) are included in the alignment or
not (data not shown). So far, almost all orphan myosins
belong to taxa that have not undergone large-scale comparative sequencing efforts. Only short sequence fragments have
been found for 277 myosins. These sequences were excluded
from the phylogenetic analysis but have been classified based
on their similarity in the multiple sequence alignment. Nevertheless, these data are important for defining myosin diversity in as many organisms as possible.

Two different models can be proposed for the further evolution of the Metazoa (Figures 8 and 9). In both models a con-

siderable boost of myosin diversity happened at the early
evolution of Metazoa. The most reasonable model based on
the myosin class distribution suggests an increase of the
myosin diversity in three steps. After separation of the Fungi,
the Metazoa developed four new classes, class-VI, class-VII,
class-IX, and class-XVIII. These classes are shared by species
of all Metazoa taxa sequenced so far, except the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, which does not contain class-IX
and class-XVIII myosins. However, single species of the other
taxa have also lost their members of these four classes; for
example, the nematode Trichinella spiralis contains only a

ble, this placement could also be the result of long branch
attraction effects in the phylogenetic tree. Sequencing of further species of the lineages Choanoflagellida, Cnidaria, and
Echinodermata, which are as yet represented only by single
species, will provide a better picture of these taxa, as has been
obtained for the nematodes, Arthropoda, and vertebrates,
which show a wide distribution of the myosin content
between their member species. For example, during the evolution of the Arthropoda, the Insecta lost the class-XIX
myosin. Later in evolution the ancestor of all Drosophila species lost the class-III and class-IX myosins, and finally most
Drosophila species lost the class-XXII myosin. Most of the
lineages like the Nematoda, Arthropoda and Vertebrata have
developed further branch-specific myosins. We propose that
sequencing of related organisms to Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Monosiga brevicollis will result in the classification of their orphan myosins and, thus, also of branch-specific
myosins for these lineages.

class-XVIII myosins, and the Drosophila species have lost
their class-IX myosin. Our model places the choanoflagellates
to the Coelomata that invented the related class-X, class-XV,
and class-XXII myosins. After separation of the choanoflagellates, the Bilateria gained another three classes, class-III,
class-XIX, and class-XX. The Deuterostomia, to which we
placed the Cnidaria, invented the class-XXVIII myosins and
lost class-XXII myosins. Later in evolution, the Chordata lost
class-XX myosins. This model proposes the continuous
invention of new myosin classes over a relatively long time
and the subsequent loss of single myosin classes by certain
species and lineages. The placement of the Cnidaria to the
Deuterostomia is surprising as the Cnidaria are commonly
considered to be a sister group of the Bilateria. However, the
analysis of the Nematostella vectensis genome showed that,

Schematic diagram of the domain structures of the orphan myosins of species not belonging to one of the other taxa. Both alleles of Trypanosoma cruzi
have been assembled independently, providing two slightly different copies of each myosin gene. None of the Myo-F versions is complete and the
presented domain organization of Myo-F is the result of a merged version of both myosins. The sequence names of the ophan myosins are given in the
motor domain of the respective myosins. Color keys to the domain names and symbols are given on the right except for the myosin domain, which is
colored in blue. Myosin names next to domain representations list orthologs from closely related species or orthologs from the same species. These
sequences have a similar domain organization. Sequences that are not orthologs and have not resulted from recent gene duplications are shown separately,
although their domain organizations might be very similar. Abbreviations for the domains are: AAA, ATPase family associated with various cellular
activities; DnaJ domain, named after the prokaryotic heat shock protein DnaJ; RhoGEF, Rho GDP/GTP exchange factor.

deposited research

The comparative analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of
the species in single myosin classes showed several
incongruities. We hypothesized that the myosin genes of the
corresponding organisms might have evolved asynchronously, as has been observed for a number of yeast genes [31].
From the phylogenetic tree we therefore determined the distances between pairs of sequences. To compensate for differ-

reports

In both models, the tree of myosin diversity gives clear support for the classical Coelomata hypothesis that groups
Arthropoda with Deuterostomia in a monophyletic class. The

Nematoda sequenced so far lack four classes that the Arthropoda share with the vertebrates. It is very unlikely that the
Nematoda have lost just these four classes and not one or
more of the others. The class specific phylogenetic trees show
that the Nematoda myosins always separate before the
Arthropoda-Deuterostomia split, except for the class-IX
myosins, where the Nematoda and Arthropoda homologs
group separately from the Deuterostomia homologs. These
findings illustrate the advantage of analyzing the diversity of
a large protein family in contrast to looking at single-gene
phylogenies that have supported the monophyletic grouping
of Nematoda and Arthropoda in some cases [30].

reviews

In contrast, the metazoan tree based on classical taxa and
nodes shows the invention of ten myosin classes in a very
short time scale (Figure 9). The evolution of the Metazoa
would thus mainly be characterized by gene losses. While the
Anthozoa Nematostella vectensis shares all its 12 myosin
classes with vertebrates, the nematodes must have lost 6 of
the 13 common Metazoa myosin classes. The nematode
Trichinella spiralis has lost another three of the remaining
classes, sharing only four classes with the other Metazoa. The
Arthropoda must also have lost at least two of the common
Metazoa myosin classes. This scenario, the invention of ten
myosin classes during the evolution of only two taxa nodes
and the subsequent major losses of myosin classes until the
final speciation, seems very unlikely compared to the other
model that proposes the invention of new myosin classes over
a long period with the subsequent loss of single classes.

ences in general diversity within each class, all distances were
normalized. Asynchronous evolution is visualized by the
comparison of the deviation from the mean distances. As
examples we analyzed the myosins of completely sequenced
mammalian (Figure 10) and fungal (Figure 11) genomes. As
expected, all primates are very closely related, with the chimpanzee generally closer to Homo sapiens than to macaca. The
myosin proteins from dog and cow are more closely related to
those of the primates than to those from rodents. The opossum Monodelphis domestica is, in general, the most divergent mammal with respect to myosins, although in the case of
Myo1E and Myo16, it is most closely related to the dog and the
primates than to the rodents. The myosin proteins from cow
show the most asynchronous phylogenetic relationship of the
analyzed mammalian genomes. They either diverge before
the split of the rodents and primates/dog, after this split, or
form a monophyletic class with the corresponding dog
orthologs. Hence, it is not possible either to resolve the phylogenetic grouping of the cow in general, or to do so by using
the myosin proteins, or sequences from additional mammals
have to be added to better resolve the tree.

the myosins, the Saccharomycotina should be considered as
an independent clade that evolved from Fungi, in parallel
with the Ascomycota, the Basidiomycota, the Zygomyocota,
and the Schizosaccharomycetes. These clades developed very
asynchronously so that their phylogeny cannot be resolved. In
addition, the species in these clades have undergone considerable asynchronous development. Yarrowia lipolytica,
which has been considered a yeast species, is more closely
related to the Ascomycota than to the Saccharomycotina,
based on both the phylogenetic relation of the respective
myosin homologs and its myosin content as it contains a
class-XVII myosin that all Saccharomycotina have lost.
What did the very first myosin look like? In the beginning of
eukaryotic evolution, the myosin motor domain had been
developed (Figure 12). During subsequent early evolution, an
extensive process of domain fusions started, during which the
carboxy-terminal IQ motif was added first. After duplication
of this gene, the amino-terminal SH3-like domain was fused
to the motor domain. These two domain organizations are
shared by myosins of all species. The class-I myosins show the
widest taxonomic distribution, are devoid of the amino-terminal SH3-like domain and, thus, are suggested to be the first
distinct myosin class to have evolved. We propose that the
most ancient myosin motor domain had a sequence very close
to that of the class-I myosins.

The fungal myosins show several distinct groups that are
related to the established taxa. However, the analysis resolves
some so far unrecognized relationships. The Saccharomycotina do not group to the Ascomycota in all myosin classes,
but have evolved asynchronously. Based on our analysis of

Evolution of the first myosins. The first myosin, called ur-myosin, is expected to consist only of the myosin motor domain. By domain fusion it generated
the IQ motif either directly carboxy-terminal to the motor domain (2), or after a gene duplication event (1). After a further gene duplication event, this
myosin developed to the class-I myosins as well as the ancestor of most of the other myosin classes after fusion with an SH3 domain (which developed
into the amino-terminal SH3-like domain).

Conclusion

interactions

The phylogenetic tree was built based on a manually constructed and maintained structure-guided multiple sequence
alignment. The phylogenetic tree is unrooted and was generated using neighbor joining and the bootstrap (1,000 replicates) method as implemented in ClustalW (standard
settings) [33]. The phylogenetic tree presented in Additional
data file 2 was visualized using TreeDyn [34]. The schematic
tree was constructed using the following criteria. The myosins
are separated into 35 classes. Thus, we assigned a class inventory to every organism. The myosin classes are not only wellseparated based on their motor domains but also due to the
unique composition of their tail domains. Thus, we conclude
that species having myosins of the same class must have had
a common ancestor. It is extremely if not completely unlikely
that myosins with these distinct features were invented independently. The other criterion is the analysis of the different
trees of the myosin classes. Looking at the tree of a single
class, for example, the class VI myosins, it is obvious that certain taxa always separated earlier than others, for example,
the Arthropoda myosins always separated before the mammalian myosins. In the next step we ordered all species
according to their class inventory, minimizing the number of
myosin class inventions and losses. If taxa have the same class
inventory we used the data from the single class trees to
resolve their phylogenetic relationship. If the phylogenetic
relationships of taxa in single classes contradicted each other,
we hypothesized asynchronous evolution and did not resolve
the relationship between these taxa.

were obtained from the distance matrix produced by ClustalW using default substitution matrix BLOSUM62 [35]. We
collected the distances between all sequences of each class/
variant. The distances within each class/variant were normalized by dividing by the mean distance of the class/variant.
This set the mean distance of each class/variant to 1. In the

information

Myosin genes were identified in iterated TBLASTN searches
of the completed genomes of 181 organisms starting with the
protein sequence of DdMhcA. All hits were manually
analyzed at the genomic DNA level. The correct coding
sequences were identified with the help of the multiple
sequence alignment of the myosins. As the amount of myosin
sequences increased (especially the number of sequences in
classes with few representatives), many of the initially predicted sequences were reanalyzed to correctly identify all
exon borders. Where possible, EST data have been analyzed
to help in the annotation process. Now, all designated myosin
classes contain enough members to correctly predict any
additional member sequence in the future. However, some of
the orphan myosins (for example, from Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia) might still contain
wrongly predicted exons in the tail regions, because sufficient
comparative genomic data are not yet available. For some
organisms only EST data are available to date, and myosin
sequences identified in these databases have been included in
the analysis as long as the sequences contains at least 100 residues. These short sequences cannot be, and have not been,
used in the phylogenetic analysis but are important to define
the myosin inventory with as many organisms as possible. In

considered independently in the analysis but in all cases the
same splice forms were taken for homologous myosins. All
sequence-related data (names, corresponding species,
GenBank IDs, alternative names, corresponding publications, domain predictions, and sequences) and references to

reviews

The presented tree will increase in resolution as more organisms are sequenced. To increase the fine resolution, more
sequences of intermediate taxa, for example, in the metazoan
lineage, are needed. For some major taxa a significant
amount of species has to be sequenced to get the resolution
already obtained for the fungi and metazoans. For example,
only eight species of the Viridiplantae have completely been
sequenced so far. In particular, sequencing of further underrepresented taxa will increase myosin diversity. The myosin
data presented here will allow the correct annotation and
classification of all upcoming homologs. We hope that CyMoBase [21,32], which stores and presents all related information, will be an invaluable tool in all areas of myosin and
motor protein research, and in classical taxonomy.

comment

Here, we present the phylogenetic analysis of 2,269 manually
annotated myosin proteins. The previously assigned 19
myosin classes were confirmed and 16 new classes with
unique domain organizations defined. A phylogenetic tree
has been constructed that includes information about the
class distribution and evolution in certain taxa as well as the
phylogenetic information contained in class-specific subtrees. The analysis shows the Choanoflagellida as part of the
Metazoa lineage and the cnidaria (Nematostella vectensis) as
having diverged after the separation of Deuterostomia and
Protostomia. The myosin data show that several taxa have
evolved asynchronously, for example the Mammalia and the
Fungi.

Domain and motif predictions
Protein domains were predicted using the SMART [36,37]
and Pfam [38,39] web server. The prediction of coiled-coils is
based on the coils program. The IQ motifs and amino-terminal domains were predicted manually based on the homology
to similar domains of the other myosins. The recognition
motifs included in the SMART and Pfam databases are too
restrictive, as the motifs have been created based on the small
datasets available some years ago. The domain profiles of the
other domains have not been revised yet.
