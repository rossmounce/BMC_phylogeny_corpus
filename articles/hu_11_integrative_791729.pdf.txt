Abstract
Background: Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by
allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about
the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are
available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always
straightforward.
Results: We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog
Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing
approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila,
and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease
in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different
goals to appropriately ‘cast a wide net’ or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays
protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps
users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model
organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence
orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association
study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool (DIOPT-DIST;
http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt-dist).
Conclusions: DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially
those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human
disease genes.

Background
It is well established that the evolutionary conservation
of proteins correlates with conservation at the level of
biological and/or biochemical functions. Thus, identification of putative orthologs among species can be a
helpful first step in functional genomics studies, as functional information obtained in one species can be used
to formulate testable hypotheses about function in
another. Indeed, for many approaches, identification of
orthologs is the first step to using model systems such
as S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster

(Drosophila) to study human genes, such as the set of
disease genes in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) database [1-4] or the results of a genomewide association study (GWAS) [5,6]. Similarly, orthologs of genes functionally characterized in model organisms may identify as yet unknown candidate genes
relevant to human health. Thus, in addition to its value
in evolutionary studies, mapping of orthologs among
species can serve important purposes for functional
analyses.
To date, a large number of approaches and corresponding databases have been developed to predict putative
orthologous genes among various species. Most of these
are based on either phylogeny-based algorithms (e.g.
TreeFam, Phylome, Ensembl Compara) or on sequence

similarity (e.g. InParanoid, orthoMCL and OMA) [7-12].
More recently, additional tools have been reported based
on functional similarity among ortholog groups identified
using protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (e.g.
NetworkBLAST, IsoBase) [13-15]. Notably, PPI-based
tools have strong potential to improve in performance
over time, as PPI data sets are improving in coverage and
quality at a rapid pace. Because of their differing
approaches, user interfaces, output formats and so on,
these otherwise powerful tools and algorithms can be difficult to use by a biologist without expertise in bioinformatics, particularly when handling large-scale data sets
such as the results of a full-genome RNAi screen or
large-scale proteomics analysis.
Furthermore, determining the sensitivity and specificity
of a given ortholog prediction approach is not easy. Only
a few studies have compared the relative quality of results
obtained with different tools. Evaluation efforts are hindered by the very reason that motivates a researcher to
develop an ortholog prediction tool–i.e. we simply do not
have enough functional data. Nevertheless, some studies
have looked at the comparative quality of some tools
using available approaches. Altenhoff et al., for example,
assessed several tools, including OMA, orthoMCL, Inparanoid and Compara, using gene ontology (GO), enzyme
category (EC), gene expression profile and gene neighborhood conservation. The results of their comparison
and corresponding estimate of the relative quality of the
tools suggest that simple bidirectional best hit (BBH)based ortholog predictions are more likely to yield functionally consistent predicted orthologs. Their results also
highlight that different tools have different advantages
[16].
As each of the existing tools has different strengths,
combining results generated by more than one tool
might be the best way forward. At least two such integrative methods have been reported. HCOP is a human-centered ortholog prediction tool that in its original
published form, facilitated comparison of ortholog assertions made by PhIGs, HomoloGene, Ensembl Compara,
Inparanoid and MGI [17,18]. Currently, the HCOP website also includes predictions from Evola, HGNC, OMA,
OPTIC, TreeFam, UCSC and ZFIN and has removed
PhIGs http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/hcop.pl.
Another tool, COMPARE, is not limited to humancentered relationships and combines results from Inparanoid, orthoMCL, Ensembl Compara and TreeFam [19].
These combined approaches are useful in that they allow
for identification and comparison of ortholog results
from various sources, allowing the end-user to make
informed choices. However, neither tool incorporates the
full range of approaches available (i.e. sequence-based,
tree-based and network-based approaches) and facilitates

Page 2 of 16

comparison among any pair of common model organisms. For example, HCOP only provides predictions relevant to human genes, and COMPARE provides
predictions among human, mouse, worm, fly, chicken,
zebrafish and sea squirt genes but not yeast genes. Thus,
room for significant refinement of integrative approaches
remains.
After successful ortholog prediction, a next challenge
can be to combine functional information obtained in
multiple organisms to uncover conserved functions that
provide insights into human diseases. Insight into disease using ortholog prediction tools can be twofold.
First, identification of orthologs can make model organisms available to perform molecular genetic studies of
conserved disease genes that are not possible to perform
in other organisms. Second, conserved genes first identified in a model organism can become candidate disease
genes and/or provide new insights relevant to disease.
We also note that genes that are not conserved among
specific groups of species or have distinct differences
may be important for evolutionary studies, and may be
good targets for the development of biocides, such as to
control disease vector, parasite, or crop pest populations
[20,21].
The increasing number of human genes that have been
directly or indirectly associated with diseases provides a
good starting point for identification of conserved orthologs in model organisms for disease-focused studies. To
date, a large number of disease-associated genes have
been reported and the information compiled into various
resources. Perhaps top among these is the NCBI Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database [1-4].
Since the completion of the human genome and following various technological advances, an increasing number
of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for possible disease association of many previously
uncharacterized genes [5,6]. In addition, there have been
several automated efforts to evaluate the links between
human diseases and genes, such as based on gene annotations or the published literature. The Disease Ontology
project, for example, assigns disease information based
on GeneRIF annotation [22], and resources such as
BITOLA, MedGene and HuGE Navigator [23-25] provide
systematic summaries of disease-gene relationships culled
from the literature in NCBI PubMed.
Facilitating the identification of orthologs between a
model organism and humans is of particular relevance
to genes associated with human diseases. Drosophila is a
model organism of particular interest for which a wide
variety of molecular genetic tools are readily available.
Moreover, Drosophila models have been developed for a
number of human diseases. For example, Drosophila is
an established model for a wide variety of nervous

Hu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:357

system-related diseases (reviewed in JEIBMANN and
PAULUS 2009)[26]; various muscular dystrophies
[27-29]; responses to infection by human pathogens (e.g.
[30-34]); multi-symptom inherited disorders [35,36];
heart disease [25,37,38]; and cancer [9,39-42]. Drosophila is an emerging model for the study of asthma
[43], lipotoxicity [44], and metabolism [45-47], and is
being used to study responses to therapeutic treatments
and natural products [48-50]. Overall, conservation
between humans and Drosophila at the gene, pathway,
cognate organ and behavioral levels, together with available tools and assays, suggest that Drosophila can serve
as an excellent system for rapid functional characterization of GWAS candidates and other disease-associated
genes, such as by placing them in specific conserved
pathways or implicating them in specific metabolic, physiological or developmental roles.
Despite the utility and potential of Drosophila in studying disease, however, the number and scope of resources
linking human disease genes to known or putative Drosophila orthologs is still limited. OrthoDisease and Homophila are two tools aimed at translation of OMIM disease
gene annotations to genes of other organisms. OrthoDisease maps orthologous gene relationships among human
genes and genes in 100 genomes, including Drosophila,
using the Inparanoid tool [51]. Homophila was designed
specifically for Drosophila and uses BLASTP to compare
human protein sequences to the Drosophila proteome
[52,53]. Both approaches have value and are used extensively. Nevertheless, each has important caveats. For example, OrthoDisease may miss relevant orthologs due to the
limited coverage provided by use of just one approach to
ortholog mapping, and Homophila can generate inappropriate gene mapping via uncurated one-way BLASTP
results. Moreover, neither tool currently accommodates
the increasing amount of GWAS data available to the
community. Thus, we have developed a new online tool
that integrates the results of several ortholog-mapping
tools based on different algorithms, and used the approach
to create an online-searchable analysis of relationships
among genes in OMIM or GWAS data sets and genes in
the mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae genomes.

Results and Discussion
An integrative tool to identify putative orthologs among
several model organisms

More than three dozen large-scale ortholog prediction
tools or resources have been developed in the past decade,
and more than a dozen of these are currently available
online in relatively accessible formats. Based on published
reviews and comparative studies evaluating different tools,
we selected nine tools that provide a reasonable balance of

Page 3 of 16

specificity and sensitivity [7-12,15,16,54-59]. We excluded
tools that were developed prior to the availability of fullgenome sequence and/or that have not been maintained
and updated. However, we note that the data available
from tools we included are based on different genome
releases (see the Documentation Page, http://www.flyrnai.
org/DRSC-OPT.html). Three of the nine tools we selected
are representative of the phylogenetic tree approach and
five are representative of tools that cluster genes based on
genome-wide sequence comparison. In addition, the
recent availability of large datasets and networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has opened the doors to
proteomics-based approaches to identification of functional orthologs, i.e. predictions based on the similarity of
the PPI networks surrounding the potentially orthologous
proteins. A leading resource for ortholog prediction based
on this approach is IsoBase [15,60,61], which is aimed at
identification of functionally related proteins based on
integration of sequence similarity and protein-protein network-based information. As our principle goal in developing the tool is a focus on functional orthologs, we
included IsoBase in addition to the other eight tools in our
integrative approach.
Integration of the results of these nine tools required a
number of pre-processing steps and decisions, as the outputs from the different tools differ both in terms of their
use of gene and protein identifiers, and in terms of the format and complexity of output files. The major identifiers
used by the nine tools are Ensembl protein identifiers,
NCBI gene or protein identifiers, Uniprot identifiers, and
species-specific identifiers such as from FlyBase and
WormBase (Additional file 1). Another difference among
the tools that we had to address was that some tools make
predictions based on comparison with all protein isoforms
of a gene, whereas others first normalized the proteins at
the gene level by selecting the longest isoform for inclusion in the analysis. To facilitate merging and comparing
the outputs from the nine tools we included, we first programmed an algorithm to standardize different identifiers
to Entrez gene IDs using mapping files, such as from
NCBI or species-specific databases. Our use of gene IDs
eliminated redundancy due to inclusion by some tools of
multiple isoforms. Recognizing that many users of our
tool would prefer to be inclusive rather than to inadvertently exclude genes that might be relevant to a given disease-focused or other study, we chose to include not only
ortholog predictions but also inparalog or co-ortholog predictions. Although paralogous genes may have diverged in
function more than orthologs, those that have arisen from
recent gene duplications may be members of a functionoriented ortholog group [57,62]. When building the tool,
we first obtained the data from each site; then standardized various identifiers and converted the different output

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/357

formats; next integrated all the predictions into our FlyRNAi database [63]; and finally launched an online application (see Materials and Methods).
The new tool is named DIOPT, for DRSC Integrative
Ortholog Prediction Tool, and it is freely accessible
online at http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt (Figure 1). Using
Drosophila or human data as inputs, we find that DIOPT
identified 28605 fly and human orthologous relationships, of which 2537 are one-to-one relationships. As
expected, DIOPT identified more human-fly many-toone relationships than one-to-many relationships (i.e.
5504 versus 1672), consistent with the lower redundancy
of the fly genome. DIOPT achieves an approximately
70% to 428% increase in the number of Drosophilahuman gene relationships identified as compared with
use of any individual tool. This corresponds to 20% to
116% more coverage of the Drosophila genome and 30%
to 172% more coverage of the human genome (Table 1).
DIOPT allows users to use all nine tools or any subset in
a search. Although a small number of differences in predictions might be due to the use of different genome
release versions by different tools, most differences will
be due to the specific algorithms and approaches used in
the various tools. DIOPT calculates a simple score indicating the number of tools that support a given orthologous gene-pair relationship, such that the maximum
score for most species pairs is nine (see the Document
Page, http://www.flyrnai.org/DRSC-OPT.html), assuming
that the user selects to accept outputs from all tools (i.e.
the default setting). Because all nine sources cover the
entire genome of each species included in the search, we
reasoned that this simple count of how many tools agree
with each other is an appropriate first indicator of confidence (see below). We next focused on methods for evaluation and improved display of the results, towards the
goals of generating higher-confidence outputs, making
the tool user-friendly for biologists, and providing additional gene- or protein-associated information and
functionality.
Assessment of functional consistency of ortholog pairs
predicted using DIOPT

As the field lacks a commonly accepted “gold-standard”
test set for assessment of quality, we opted to test a few
approaches that together help give an overall picture of
the quality of DIOPT results. Our first assessment was
based on molecular function annotation of gene ontology
(GO MF). GO MF is widely used to assess the functional
consistency of two genes. As a first test of DIOPT performance, we examined the similarity of GO MF annotations for all Drosophila-human ortholog pairs predicted
using the default DIOPT settings (i.e. incorporating
results from all nine tools). We recognized that a

Page 4 of 16

potential caveat to using GO MF annotations to analyze
performance is the danger for ‘circular arguments’, as
some GO MF annotations are themselves based on information about orthologs. Indeed, 40% of GO functional
annotations for Drosophila genes and 55% for human
genes were assigned based on sequence similarity without
manual inspection. We were able to address this by taking into consideration the evidence codes for GO MF
assignments. Namely, we opted to perform the analysis
with two subsets; i.e., the subset of GO MF annotations
supported by experimental data or curator/author statements, and applying an even more stringent rule, only
those GO MF annotations that are supported by experimental data. We used GOSemSim [64], an R package
http://www.r-project.org/ for semantic similarity computation, to calculate the functional similarity score for
each orthologous pair by considering the set of selected
GO terms assigned to each gene. The results of our analysis demonstrate that ortholog pairs with lower scores
(i.e. predicted by fewer tools) have nearly comparable
functional consistency as compared with ortholog pairs
with high scores. However, higher score pairs do show a
slightly higher level of functional similarity (Figure 2a).
Thus, DIOPT scores provide one means of prioritizing or
limiting gene list outputs.
The lack of a standardized benchmark remains a significant challenge in comparing and evaluating ortholog
prediction tools. The “Quest for Orthologs” initiative is
currently attempting to provide benchmarking for orthology predictions but that resource is not yet available [65].
To obtain some measure of DIOPT performance relative
to individual tools, we used two different approaches
based on available resources. First, we used a manually
assembled set of high-confidence Drosophila-human
orthologous pairs made up of 159 orthologous pairs of
trans-membrane proteins generated by manual phylogenetic analysis [54], 89 pairs of kinases generated manually
based on kinase domain similarity as well as phylogeny
[66] and 71 pairs of oxidative phosphorylation genes
assembled manually by sequence alignment and analysis
of exon/intron structures [67,68]. All these data sets, with
the exception of the OXPHOS set, have been previously
used for evaluation of ortholog prediction tools. The idea
here was to identify a set of proteins where orthology
relationships can be established with high confidence by
approaches other than those discussed here. To this end,
the dataset’s composition is biased towards types of proteins for which such independent verification is feasible.
However, such a bias can distort the evaluation results:
the coverage of the selected proteins (especially, transmembrane proteins) in PPI data is low and consequently,
the performance of a PPI-based method like IsoBase is
likely to be underestimated. Nevertheless, we believe that

Figure 1 DIOPT facilitates identification of predicted orthologs based on various approaches, with flexible inputs and outputs. The
DIOPT graphical user interface facilitates input of small or large gene or protein lists and is compatible with one or more of a variety of
identifiers. Three filters are available: two of them exclude relationships that are predicted by < 2 or < 3 tools unless the only match score is
equal to or lower than the threshold. The third one and most stringent filter limits outputs to the best-matching ortholog(s) per gene, as judged
by the number of tools supporting the prediction. DIOPT provides a score based on the number of tools supporting the prediction and a
weighted score based on the average of GO semantic similarity of orthologous pairs predicted by each tool using high quality GO functional
annotation. In addition, DIOPT also provides the option to view the original score of each tool and a protein-protein alignment based on an
updated proteome annotation (RefSeq release 44). Percent protein identity is calculated for both the overall alignment and domain regions.

testing with this set can provide one useful way to ask if
as predicted, the integrative approach provides improved
results as compared with use of individual tools.
DIOPT is able to identify 301 of the total of 319 relationships in the high-confidence manually assembled test
set. Thus, DIOPT achieved 94% sensitivity, comparing
favorably to the 39% to 81% sensitivity observed with
individual tools. We also used this test set to look at specificity and observed the classical trade-off between specificity and sensitivity. (See Figure 3 for definitions of
these terms.) Without filters, the specificity of DIOPT is
38%, as compared to 48% to 71% observed with individual tools (Figure 3a). This decrease may be acceptable
for some applications of the tool; however, for other
applications, users may prefer to limit the results. As
mentioned above, we reasoned that the simple DIOPT
score (i.e. the number of tools supporting the prediction)
might provide a way to achieve higher specificity, and
this indeed proves true. If we filter out the relationships
with score equal to one, i.e. relationships supported by
only one of the 9 tools, the sensitivity of DIOPT remains
at about 90% but specificity increases from 38% to 53%.
To take best advantage of this or of a user’s own assessment, we provide users with several options for filtering
results. Users can include any subset of the nine tools in
a search; apply a filter that removes predictions supported by only one tool (i.e. scores < 2 are removed); or
apply a filter that returns only the predictions with the
best score (i.e. if a query gene matches to more than one
ortholog, only the ortholog(s) with the highest score are
displayed).
We performed a different type of test for specificity
using a negative test set; i.e. a set of 1,130 human genes
defined as human lineage-specific by Eukaryotic Clusters
of Orthologous Groups (KOG) [37]. We found that
DIOPT shows lower specificity (82%) as compared to
individual tools using this test set (93%-99%) (Figure 3b).

This may be partially due to the fact that the ‘lineagespecific’ set in KOG was assembled over a decade ago,
when the available approaches may not have been sensitive enough to detect meaningful gene relationships that
exist in this group. This idea is supported by the observation that 34% of the genes from the KOG set that were
identified as not human specific by DIOPT are predicted
by multiple tools to have orthologs in the fly.
Online Features of DIOPT

More than a dozen ortholog prediction tools are currently
available online. However, most tools do not allow for
searching in batch mode (i.e. with a long list of genes or
other identifiers), making them impractical to use for
many types of analysis, including analysis of the typically
long lists of genes or proteins resulting from the increasing
number of high-throughput RNAi, proteomics and other
studies. Although many of the tools do allow a researcher
to install the program locally, potentially facilitating batch
searches, this is a significant hurdle for a researcher without expertise in bioinformatics, and even after installation,
large datasets may still be difficult to process and subsequently manage as outputs. To make searching with short
or long lists of identifiers possible online, we developed
DIOPT to have the flexibility of accepting one or a few
typed entries, a long list of entries, or an uploaded list of
gene or protein identifiers (Figure 1). Moreover, we built
gene and protein mapping into DIOPT and accommodate
a large number of NCBI, species-specific and other different identifiers. Thus, after choosing the input and output
species of interest, researchers can use most common
identifiers, or even mix different types of identifiers, in
their input lists. For expert users, we also provide the
option of specifying the type of identifier, such that other
matches may not be included. We also make it possible to
search with RNAi reagent IDs (i.e. amplicon IDs) from the
Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (DRSC) or fly stock

results can easily be excluded, such as by sorting data by
that column following download. To further help users

Page 7 of 16

evaluate orthologs we have also calculated weighted
scores. To do this, the nine tools were weighted based on
average GO semantic similarity of orthologous pairs
annotated with high-quality GO MF annotation (GO
MF2, see above). The average GO semantic similarity
scores are very similar for each of the 9 tools, ranging
from 0.612 to 0.691 (Figure 2b). To assign weights, we
normalized the scores by setting the median to one and
defined the weights accordingly (0.903 to 1.019).
Weighted scores serve as an additional way for users to
make informed decisions when multiple orthologs with
the same simple count score are retrieved.
We have added the option to view the original prediction/evaluation scores from each of the tools, along with
the protein alignment. To help address the caveat that the
original predictions were made by various tools using different genome releases, the protein-protein alignments we
provide are based on a current proteome annotation for
any given output pair, including highlighting of regions that
correspond to domain annotations (RefSeq release 44;
Figure 1). The sequence identities of the entire aligned
sequence, as well as identity within the annotated domain
regions, which typically have higher identity, are summarized and displayed. For example, for the fly gene par-1
(FlyBase ID FBgn0260934) and its human ortholog
MARK4 (NCBI Gene ID 57787), DIOPT shows that the
overall protein identity is 47% whereas the identity of the
kinase catalytic domain is 88% (Figure 1). This feature
allows researchers to quickly zoom in on functionally critical motifs, amino acids, etc. based on their specific expertise
and interests. Finally, the database and application of
DIOPT were designed in a way that it is easy to be updated
and expanded, such as when new and improved ortholog
prediction tools become available, or when existing tools
are updated.
Using DIOPT results to identify genes in model organisms
related to human diseases

High-throughput genomics technologies generate a vast
amount of data, making it possible for researchers to
search for genetic causes of human diseases. Concomitant with the rise in disease genomics is an increase of
publicly accessible resources that associate loci, mutations and genes with putative or known roles in disease.
Perhaps top among these is Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), which focuses on inherited diseases. The information contained in OMIM has been
extracted from publications and undergone manual curation [1-4]. GWAS data sets, such as those cataloged by
the National Genome Research Institute (NHGRI; see
http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/), provide associations among loci or genes and diseases or traits based on
linkage analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms
as markers. Due to technological advances in genotyping,

the amount of GWAS data now available has increased
dramatically [5,6]. With GWAS data, identification of a
specific disease-causing mutation in a gene may be missing, with the results pointing to one or more candidate
genes that may be relevant. These candidates require
further functional characterization, and the wealth of
phenotypic information available in Drosophila and other
model organisms may be of help to narrow down the list
of genes in a disease-associated locus.
Drosophila has been used extensively to study human
diseases but as discussed previously, resources linking fly
or other model organism genes to human diseases are still
limited. The tools OrthoDisease and Homophila were
developed to help identify disease genes in model organisms. These tools incorporate OMIM but not GWAS
information and their use of OMIM data sets differ from
one another. OMIM annotation includes both gene/locus
terms and disease phenotype terms. OrthoDisease includes
most phenotype terms, whereas Homophila is focused on
gene/locus terms, with neither tool fully incorporating all
available terms at OMIM. Moreover, OrthoDisease uses
Inparanoid predictions to map human genes to genes in
model organisms, such that some ortholog pairs identified
using DIOPT-DIST are missed when searching OrthoDisease (e.g. mapping of human TP53 to Drosophila p53). By
contrast, Homophila uses one-way BLASTP, which is so
inclusive that it tends to include erroneous predictions.
For example, ALDH2 is identified in OMIM as ‘causing
acute alcohol sensitivity’ (OMIM IDs 610251 and 100650).
For ALDH2, OrthoDisease predicts one corresponding
gene in Drosophila (Aldh) and Homophila predicts 11 corresponding genes in the fly. In contrast, DIOPT predicts
two fly genes: Aldh, which is also predicted using OrthoDisease and Homophila, and the additional gene
CG31075, which shares 59% identity and 74% similarity
with human ALDH2 and is predicted to be an ALDH2
ortholog by four tools.
Thus, we reasoned that developing a tool based on
DIOPT might improve upon results from existing tools, as
well as provide an opportunity to incorporate newly available GWAS data. The tool we developed was named
DIOPT-DIST as it combines DIOPT ortholog mapping
with disease and trait information http://www.flyrnai.org/
diopt-dist. With DIOPT-DIST, we linked C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mouse or yeast genes to human diseases
by extracting disease-gene information at OMIM http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim and GWAS data cataloged
by NHGRI http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies and then
using DIOPT to map orthologs (Figure 4 & 5; see also
Materials & Methods and the Documentation Page, http://
www.flyrnai.org/DRSC-OPT.html). DIOPT-DIST includes
both disease phenotype terms and gene/locus terms from
OMIM. At the DIOPT-DIST website, users can query

Page 9 of 16

with one or more genes from a model organism to get a
list of human orthologs along with their disease or trait
annotations. Conversely, users can query with a disease
term, disease category (see below) or OMIM IDs to get a
list of human genes as well as their corresponding orthologs in a specified model organism. The DIOPT score in
the results table links to a page displaying a protein alignment and details about the DIOPT results.
To develop the DIOPT-DIST tool, we first had to normalize the disease and trait information using a standardized classification of disease terms. The 5700 disease or
trait descriptions from the OMIM and GWAS data sets
are in free text and show significant variation in word
choice, phrasing and sentence structure in describing
diseases. Indeed, in some cases the terminologies vary
even within one resource, including spelling variations
or typing errors. These variations hinder systematic
searches for disease phenotypes. By contrast, Medical
Subject Heading (MeSH) terms are a previously established controlled vocabulary describing disease phenotypes (C01-C27) and mental disorders (F03) with a
hierarchal structure allowing more general disease terms
to be distinguished from sub-classes. MeSH accommodates most disease synonyms and is used to index medical literature in PubMed [71]. Thus, we chose to classify
OMIM and GWAS disease terms based on MeSH general disease categories in order to facilitate disease
search and data mining.
To do this, we took advantage of OMIM clinical
synopsis heading/sub-heading text [72], and were able
to map about 3000 OMIM disease terms to the corresponding MeSH terms. Using MeSH synonym annotation, we were able to classify most of the remaining
OMIM and GWAS terms. Some cannot be mapped
using MeSH clinical synopsis heading/sub-headings or
synonyms because they are traits rather than diseases
(e.g. eye or hair color) or they are disease risk factors,
diagnoses or treatments, and neither of those categories
is covered by MeSH disease annotations. Therefore, we
created two additional categories, “Disease risk factor,
diagnosis or treatment” and “Trait”, and mapped to
these categories as appropriate (Table 2). Because both
OMIM and GWAS are updated periodically, and particularly as GWAS data is accumulating at a rapid pace,
we plan to regularly update DIOPT-DIST, including
conversion to our standard MeSH-based terms. The
date of the last update will be indicated on the DIOPTDIST search page.
We found a total of about 6000 human genes from
OMIM and GWAS data associated genetically with a
wide range of diseases and traits. Using DIOPT without
any filter, we can identify 4282 corresponding orthologs
in Drosophila. The numbers drop to 3620 and 3382

organisms. 4b. Summary of disease genes from OMIM and GWAS and predicted orthologous relationships for Drosophila.

Drosophila genes, respectively, when we apply filters
that exclude predictions supported by scores of < 2 or <
3. Of these high-confidence orthologs, 33% were from
both OMIM and GWAS, 37% were from OMIM only,
and 30% were from GWAS only (Figure 4). Our results
suggest that molecular functions relevant to a large
number of human disorders and GWAS associations
could potentially be studied using Drosophila. Table 2
summarizes the distribution of these Drosophila genes
over 25 disease categories in MeSH, plus our two added
categories. The categories with the most genes are
“Congenital, Hereditary, and Neonatal Diseases and
Abnormalities”, “Nervous System Diseases”, “Disease
risk factor, diagnosis or treatment” and “Musculoskeletal
Diseases”. As expected, DIOPT-DIST also performs well
with examples such as those mentioned above, i.e.
human TP53 mapping to Drosophila p53 (e.g. p53
appears among results of a disease full text search for
“cancer” with Drosophila as the output species) and the

mapping of ALDH2 to Drosophila Aldh and CG31075
(e.g. resulting from search with OMIM ID 610251).
The annotated results of our analysis should be a useful resource for prioritizing genes from Drosophila and
four additional model organisms (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, zebrafish, or mouse). Users can query with a disease or disease category to generate a corresponding list
of predicted orthologs of the human genes in one of the
five model organisms included in the tool (Figure 5).
For example, a search using “diabetes” currently identifies 217 predicted Drosophila orthologs corresponding
to human diabetes-related genes (see Additional file 2).
This list includes 30 genes that have previously been
studies in metabolic diseases in fly, including Akt1, InR
and chico (reviewed in [45,73]). This list also provides
additional candidates such as sima and Spargel. The
availability of a wealth of molecular genetic tools for
Drosophila makes it possible to study candidate diseaseassociated genes identified using DIOPT-DIST.

Comparing disease associations in the literature for
Drosophila and human orthologs

In addition to curated sources like OMIM, information
about gene and disease associations also exist in the form
of millions of published literature citations in free text
format. For example, Bodenreider and Burgun recently
showed that the MeSH index of biomedical articles provides a framework for comparing disease phenotypes of
mouse and human orthologous genes [71]. Moreover,
they showed that the categories “Neoplasms” and “Nervous System Diseases” have the most disease annotations
in common between mouse and human orthologs. For
our analysis, we extracted disease phenotypes based on
MeSH indexing of biomedical articles in PubMed literature citations for the 28605 orthologous gene pairs
between Drosophila and humans (Table 1). We identified
3557 fly genes with at least one disease phenotype associated in the literature. Of these, 2739 (77%) have at least
one putative human ortholog as revealed by DIOPT. In
addition, 2283 Drosophila genes share at least one disease
category with their human orthologs based on independent studies (Additional file 3). These Drosophila genes
cover 23 of the 26 disease categories (Table 3). “Cancer”,
“Digestive system diseases” and “Nervous system diseases” have the highest percentages of orthologous genes
sharing the same disease phenotype(s), whereas parasitic
diseases, eye diseases and infectious diseases have the

lowest percentages of orthologous genes with the same
disease phenotype(s).
We further looked at the publications for the 4282 fly
disease genes identified by mapping human OMIM and
GWAS data. 1534 of them have been published as related
to disease using the fly model and 888 (58%) are associated with the same disease category in the literature as
that assigned by OMIM/GWAS mapping (Table 4). This
supports the idea that orthologous genes are likely to
have similar disease phenotypes across species and also
validates disease category assignments made when we
mapped OMIM/GWAS annotation. This analysis also
demonstrates that there are still many disease candidate
genes to be studied in model organisms. OMIM and
GWAS annotation are ongoing efforts, enriching for
genes mutated in the germ-line and associated with
inherited human diseases, traits, predisposition, etc. Conversely, literature mining uses existing information to
identify additional disease-gene associations, and provided more than 2000 additional candidate diseaserelated genes in Drosophila, a useful supplement to the
set of genes annotated at OMIM and GWAS.

Conclusions
Existing approaches to identification of predicted orthologs provide an excellent starting point for the development of integrative tools. DIOPT provides a simple but

effective method for integrating ortholog predictions and
viewing the results in user-friendly formats. DIOPTDIST builds on this further by filling a growing need to
build links from human diseases to genes to putative
orthologs in model organisms such as Drosophila that
can be used to analyze gene function. Various sources of
test sets provide ways to assess the quality of the tools
and demonstrate the utility of both DIOPT and DIOPTDIST. These tools and approaches should be particularly
useful to researchers interested to use model organisms
to study known or putative human disease genes.

Methods
Data source

Genome-wide orthologous prediction results of the 9
tools selected were retrieved from their corresponding
websites (see the Document Page, http://www.flyrnai.org/
DRSC-OPT.html). The test set of manually assembled
orthologous pairs was retrieved from three resources and
fly-human relationships were selected. The trans-membrane proteins were retrieved from Multi-Paranoid
http://multiparanoid.sbc.su.se/stats.html; protein kinase

annotations were retrieved from OrthoInspector http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3024942/bin/
1471-2105-12-11-S1.XLS; and the oxidative phosphorylation nuclear genes were extracted from MitoComp2
http://www.mitocomp.uniba.it/. The set of putative
human-specific genes were retrieved from KOG http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/. Human disease genes were
extracted from OMIM morbidmap and mim2gene at
NCBI. A clinical synopsis for each disease was extracted
from the omim.txt file using an in-house developed
JAVA program. GWAS information was extracted from
the NGRI GWAS publications list http://www.genome.
gov/gwastudies/, which can be downloaded via FTP
http://www.genome.gov/admin/gwascatalog.txt[5]. The
MeSH entry term lookup file was generated using an inhouse developed JAVA program from a MeSH annotation file (d2011.bin), downloaded at the MeSH web site
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html. Gene and literature associations were extracted from gene2pubmed
at NCBI ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/. Disease
MeSH indexes were extracted from a local copy of
PubMed with an in-house developed JAVA program.

Categorizing the disease terms

CS headings of OMIM terms were manually matched to
MeSH disease category terms. For GWAS disease/trait
terms and OMIM phenotype terms without CS headings,
terms were first simplified and then mapped to MeSH
using the MeSH entry term lookup file (e.g. “breast cancer”, “breast tumor” are the entry terms for the MeSH
term “breast neoplasms”). Terms corresponding to traits
(e.g. “hair color”) or disease risk factors, diagnoses and
treatments (e.g. terms as divergent as “HDL cholesterol,”
“hip bone size,” “telomere length,” and “tanning”) could
not be mapped in this way because they are not covered
by MeSH terms (i.e. they are not diseases). Therefore, we
created two additional MeSH term-like categories, Y01
for “Disease risk factor, diagnosis or treatment” and Y02
for “Trait,” and mapped terms to these categories as

appropriate (Table 2). Following mapping to existing
MeSH categories and the two new categories, about 100
terms remained unmapped. These turned out to be rare
disorders and were mapped to MeSH terms manually.
Implementation of the DIOPT user interface and disease
gene query interface

The DIOPT user interface is implemented as a collection of CGI scripts written in Perl. They are hosted on a
shared server provided by the Research IT Group
(RITG) at Harvard Medical School. The database is
hosted on a MySQL server also provided by RITG.
Protein alignments

Protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI RefSeq
database release 44. The longest isoform was selected if
