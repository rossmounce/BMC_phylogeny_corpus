Abstract
Background: The ability of emerging pathogens to infect new species is likely related to the
diversity of pathogen variants present in existing reservoirs and their degree of genomic plasticity,
which determines their ability to adapt to new environments. Certain simian immunodeficiency
viruses (SIVcpz, SIVsm) have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species, including
humans, resulting in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics. Although SIV diversification has been studied
on a population level, the essential substrates for cross-species transmission, namely SIV sequence
diversity and the types and extent of viral diversification present in individual reservoir animals have
not been elucidated. To characterize this intra-host SIV diversity, we performed sequence analyses
of clonal viral envelope (env) V1V2 and gag p27 variants present in individual SIVsm-infected sooty
mangabeys over time.
Results: SIVsm demonstrated extensive intra-animal V1V2 length variation and amino acid
diversity (le38%), and continual variation in V1V2 N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence
frequency and location. Positive selection was the predominant evolutionary force. Temporal
sequence shifts suggested continual selection, likely due to evolving antibody responses. In contrast,
gag p27 was predominantly under purifying selection. SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversification is at
least as great as that in HIV-1 infected humans, indicating that extensive viral diversification in and
of itself does not inevitably lead to AIDS.
Conclusion: Positive diversifying selection in this natural reservoir host is the engine that has
driven the evolution of the uniquely adaptable SIV/HIV envelope protein. These studies emphasize
the importance of retroviral diversification within individual host reservoir animals as a critical
substrate in facilitating cross-species transmission.

Background
Most newly emerging human pathogens are zoonotic [1],
yet little is known about the natural reservoirs from which
these zoonoses emerge. RNA viruses, due to their extraordinary genomic variability, have been particularly capable
of establishing infection in new host species [1-5]. As
examples, the transfer of avian influenza A [6-8] and
rodent hantavirus [9-12] from their natural reservoirs to
create novel human outbreaks has been documented on
several occasions [13,14]. Nonetheless, successful breaching of the host range barrier is relatively rare, with self-sustaining outbreaks in a new host species presumably
requiring multiple mutational events. Two different simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from Central African
chimpanzees and West African sooty mangabeys (SM) are
inferred to have been transferred to humans by several
independent zoonotic events, resulting in the introduction to humans of HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively [15-18].
Although phylogenetic analyses of SIV sequences reveal
considerable viral genetic diversity between different
infected individuals [19], the magnitude of intra-animal
viral diversity, the substrate for selection in cross-species
transmission events, has not been studied. Furthermore,
the mechanisms and tempo of the generation of viral variation in natural reservoir hosts are poorly understood.
Over 40 different species of African non-human primates
harbor the CD4+ T cell tropic lentiviruses [20]. In these
natural reservoir hosts, the SIVs do not cause AIDS,
despite high viremia. Disease only develops upon transmission of SIV to new non-natural hosts such as humans
or Asian macaques [21]. We have been studying the virologic and immunologic aspects of natural SIV infection in
a colony of SIV-infected SMs at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center [22-24]. Although SIV-infected SMs
are highly viremic, they manifest far lower levels of aberrant immune activation and apoptosis than are seen in
pathogenic SIV and HIV infections and maintain preserved T lymphocyte populations and regenerative capacity [22,23]. Studies of the SIVsm viral variants obtained
from different SMs demonstrate magnitudes of inter-animal viral diversity similar to that observed with different
HIV-1 group M subtypes [19].

Variation in the viral surface proteins of zoonotic viruses
is likely key to the ability of these agents to engage new
host cell receptors and gain a foothold in new species. For
influenza virus, amino acid changes and changes in glycosylation patterns in the viral hemagglutinin affect receptor binding specificity and host range [25,26]. For the
SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) discreet variations in the
spike protein are proposed to be important for viral tropism and animal-to-human transmission [27]. The HIV
and SIV envelope (Env) proteins are extraordinarily genetically variable and highly glycosylated. HIV Env has
evolved to tolerate considerable aa sequence flexibility,
including variation in N-glyc sites, and to conformationally shield key receptor-binding domains [28]. This
genetic and functional flexibility enables Env to escape
from antibody responses and to utilize different co-receptors to gain efficient entry into target cells [29-35]. In our
studies of the adaptation of SIVsm from a naturally
infected SM to a new simian host (rhesus macaques) we
observed that one of three phylogenetically distinct env
variants could replicate to high levels in the newly
infected macaques. These variants encoded a shorter variable region 1 loop and lacked two specific N-linked glycosylation sites (N-glyc sites) [24]. The pre-existence of
viral env variants in naturally infected SMs that are capable
of replicating to high levels in a new host species pointed
to the importance of SIVsm diversity in the reservoir host
in enabling cross-species transmission.
Studies of zoonotic RNA virus diversity have not focused
on the variation that already exists in the source reservoir
hosts; rather, the focus has largely been on the genetic variation and specific adaptive mutations that are observed
in the newly emerged human pathogen [36,37]. While
adaptive mutations are critical for efficient host-to-host
propagation in the newly-infected species, viral diversity
that is already extant in reservoir hosts is another important source of the genetic variation necessary for successful
cross-species transmission. Here we describe extraordinarily high intra-host SIVsm env V1V2 diversity in naturally
infected SMs, maintained by its high replication rate and
positive selection most likely mediated by antibody
responses. Ongoing evolution of an extremely mutable
SIV env in the natural host explains the ease with which

these lentiviruses can adapt to divergent host cellular environments and evade Ab responses in new host species.

Results
Magnitude of intra-host SIVsm diversity in naturally
infected SMs
Five naturally SIV-infected SMs (Table 1) were sampled
three times over a 2-year period. Viral RNA in plasma
obtained in 3/99, 5/99, and 5/01 was measured by a realtime RT-PCR assay designed to quantitatively detect the
diverse SIVsm variants [23]. Time points were chosen so
that evolution could be assessed over both shorter and
longer time intervals. Viral load averaged 1.5 × 106 SIV
RNA copies/ml plasma, and fluctuated modestly over the
2-year period (Figure 1). No clinical signs of AIDS were
observed in any of the infected SMs over the study period.

Multiple V1V2 env clones (range 15–29) and p27 gag
clones (range 5–19) were sampled from each animal at
each time point (Genbank Accession numbers AY733102AY733566). Env and gag were chosen for analysis since

they were thought to represent the extremes of diversity in
SIV populations. These genes also differ in how the
immune system detects them, with env V1V2 being
exposed primarily to neutralizing antibodies [38] and gag
p27 being recognized mostly through cellular immune
responses [39]. The number of individual viral sequences
analyzed (Table 1) combined with the sampling of variants over a short time interval (2 months) and a longer
time interval (2 years) exceeds that reported in previous
studies of SIV diversity in natural hosts [40-43].
To characterize the overall evolutionary dynamics of natural SIV variation, we built maximum likelihood trees of
both env V1V2 (Figure 2A) and gag p27 (Figure 2B)
sequences. The SIVsm variants from each SM formed distinct clades in both genes, and the env and gag trees
showed the same relationship between virus populations
of the 5 animals. These results demonstrate that each host
harbors a phylogenetically distinct population of SIVs,
presumably as the result of infection with distinct viral
populations and subsequent host-specific viral evolution.

numerous predicted N-glyc sites (NXS/T, where X can be
any aa but proline). Considerable V1 length variations
were observed (Table 2 and for example, Figure 3), such
that alignment of this region required manual adjustment, and may not represent precise homology. There
were no trends in V1V2 sequence length variation over
time (data not shown). Gag aa alignments (available from
THV) showed significantly less aa variation reflecting its
highly conserved nature.
Pairwise nt and aa diversity was calculated after removing
regions of uncertain homology (gap-stripping) in V1,
such that the values obtained for intra-host diversity represent minimum values. Average pairwise aa diversity was
high in env V1V2 (average: 5.6%, range: 0 and 37.7%;
Table 1) and low in gag p27 (average 1%; range: 0 and
7.1%, data not shown). The minimal diversity detected in
gag, which was amplified under identical conditions, confirms that the observed V1V2 diversity is not the result of
PCR-introduced mutation. In individual animals, the
magnitude of nt and aa diversity did not change significantly over the 2-year observation period (Table 2). However, there appeared to be animal-to-animal variation in
the extent of V1V2 diversity, with animals FFj and FDo
exhibiting lower V1V2 nt and aa diversity than FJo and
FBo (ANOVA p < 0.01, with Bonferroni adjustment). Nt
and aa diversity were not correlated with viremia, suggesting that mechanisms other than or in addition to the magnitude of virus replication determine the extent of viral
diversity. We cannot rule out that reduced diversity in FFj

Positive selection maintains env V1V2 diversity
Although the magnitude of sequence diversity did not
change over time, it was likely that env sequences at later
time points had diverged from those sampled earlier. To
investigate the temporal pattern of sequence evolution
within each animal, all available samples from all three
time-points for each animal were pooled and analyzed by
maximum likelihood (Fig. 4; FQi). Sixteen of the nineteen
(85%) bootstrap-supported clades from FQi contain variants from a single time point only. This pattern was
repeatable amongst variants from all other animals;
100%, 80%, 69%, and 63% of bootstrap supported clades
consisted of a single time point in animals FDo, FFj, FJo,
and FBo, respectively. In an analysis of random trees, the
number of matching time-point sequences that comprise
a monophyletic group showed a Poisson distribution;
86% of variants did not form monophyletic clades with
any other matching time-point variant (i.e., these

sequences stood alone). Thus, the observed temporal clustering of SIVsm viral populations does not occur by
chance alone (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.01).
Temporal phylogenetic structure in V1V2 suggested that
continual V1V2 diversification was occurring. To look for
evidence of positive selection, dN and dS were calculated
at each site and averaged over a 3-codon sliding window
for VIV2 (Fig. 5A) or 30-codon sliding window for p27
(Fig. 5B). These results confirmed that dN-dS>0 (p =
0.003, t-test) in V1 (aa's 25–55) in all animals, indicating
positive selection. For p27, the same test showed that
dS>dN along this gene (t-test, p < 0.001), indicating that
purifying selection limits its diversity. V1 was consistently
found to be under significant positive selection in all animals, except FFj (data not shown). By contrast, the few aa
changes in p27 sequences in the different animals over
time appeared random in nature except for a single partially fixed mutation in FDo.

in the sequence titles. The glycosylation consensus motifs (NXT/S) are highlighted in yellow.

SIVsm env V1V2 sequences predict a highly glycosylated
protein, with N-glyc site density being inversely correlated
with Env diversification
Up to 10 N-glyc sites are contained within the SIVsm
V1V2 regions sequenced in this study. In multiple locations overlapping consensus motifs (aa's 42–44, 52–54,
and 95–107) are present, such that the exact site of glycosylation varies (Fig. 3). These overlapping consensus
motifs are in particularly diverse regions of V1V2 and in
regions of strong positive selection.

V1V2 clones from the five SMs contained variable numbers of N-glyc sites, ranging from 3 to 10. The average
number of N-glyc sites among all animals was 7.2. There
was no clear pattern of increased or decreased V1V2 env
glycosylation with time. However, the mean number of
N-glyc sites for FFj and FDo (7.8 and 8.2, respectively) was

significantly higher than the other animals (average
between 6.5 and 6.9; ANOVA, Tukey B, p < 0.001). An
additional N-glyc site is found in V1 in the majority of
sequences in FFj and FDo at position 45, but not in the
other animals. There was also a smaller range of N-glyc
sites per set of sequences in FFj and FDo (6–9) compared
to other animals (3–10). As described, the FDo and FFj
SIVsm populations were less diverse and had lower average dN compared to the virus populations found in the
other 3 animals (Table 2). A significant inverse correlation
between the mean number of N-glyc sites and both pairwise nt diversity and nonsynonymous substitutions was
observed when combining data from all five SMs (p <
0.001, Fig. 6).

in HIV-1-infected humans, especially given that the archival nature of proviral sequences may overestimate the
diversity of the actively replicating viral RNA population
[47-49].

Modes of selection in V1V2 and gag
Modes of selection in V1V2 and gag. (A) Positive selection (dN>dS) in env V1 and (B) purifying selection (dN<dS) in
gag p27 within animal FQi is shown through a sliding window
analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution
rate.

Env adapts not only through raw nt sequence variability,
but also through variation in both sequence length and Nglyc site density and position. Substantial changes in these
phenotypic parameters will affect the ability of env to utilize different co-receptors [50,51], evade neutralizing antibodies [52,53] and establish new infections in naïve hosts
[54,55]. To elucidate differences in SIVsm and HIV-1
V1V2 sequence length and N-glyc site density variation, a
pooled estimate of variance within each species was compared. Neither the variances of sequence length nor glycosylation density differed significantly between species at
time point 1 although although humans had a greater variance in both parameters at time point 2 (Fmax test, p <
0.01). The variance of sequence length of SIVsm V1
decreased between the two time points (Fmax test, p <
0.005) suggesting that the magnitude of selection in SMs
shifts over time, while in humans the variance remained
stable (Figure 7C). The variation in glycosylation density
(Figure 7D-E) remained relatively stable over time within
both species except for a slight but non-significant expansion of variance in humans at time point 2.

Discussion
Comparable levels of lentiviral env V1V2 diversification in
SIVsm-infected natural hosts and HIV-infected humans
Diversification of the HIV genome in humans underlies
its success in evading pharmacologic and immunologic
selection pressures, and likely facilitates human-tohuman transmission events. It has also been suggested
that extensive virus diversification actually drives disease
progression and the destruction of the immune system
[44,45]. To compare the SIVsm genome diversity observed
in natural hosts with that of HIV-1 in humans, longitudinally sampled env aa sequences from proviral DNA representing 9 untreated, chronically HIV-infected humans
[46] were compared to our plasma RNA-derived SIVsm
env data. Two time points were chosen from both the SM
and the human dataset so that the interval between observations was approximately 2.5 years.

For the comparison of nucleotide sequence diversity,
homologous regions surrounding V1V2 were aligned and
gap-stripped. Average pairwise nucleotide diversity was
calculated separately in each host at both time points (Figure 7A). Measures of SIVsm and HIV-1 nt diversity were
not significantly different from each other within each
time point (Figure 7B; p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test).
Thus SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversity in the natural SM

To identify viral characteristics that may explain how the
SIVs have successfully infected other primate species, we
analyzed the types and extent of SIVsm diversification in
naturally infected SMs. Our findings of high intra-host
extremes of SIVsm V1V2 nt diversity extend previous studies of naturally SIV-infected SMs and African green monkeys (AGMs) [56-63] by demonstrating that viruses found
within a single animal can vary by greater than 35% at the
aa level. The ranges of aa diversity in some intra-host pairwise SIVsm V1V2 sequence comparisons in this study rival
that of inter-animal comparisons [40]. As our diversity
calculations exclude V1V2 length variation, they represent
an underestimate of the true magnitude of viral diversity.
V1V2 length polymorphisms would be predicted to have
dramatic effects on SIVsm Env conformation and phenotypic diversity [64,65].
Positive selection in V1V2 appears to explain the observed
env diversification. Specific sites in V1 were consistently
selected for in four of the five animals. Our results agree
with other studies of SIV and HIV selection, in which dNdS was consistently greater than 0 [66-68]. However, the
majority of previous studies of nonpathogenic SIV infection [56,69,70] calculated dN and dS by averaging over all
sites, obscuring variation in selective pressure between aa
sites. In addition to positive selection in V1V2, we

detected temporal shifts in SIVsm populations, some of
which involved the gain or loss of N-glyc sites.
Beyond aa sequence variation, the extensive glycosylation
of the HIV and SIV envelope glycoprotein is thought to
reduce protein epitope exposure and to facilitate viral evasion of antibody neutralization [28,52,53,55]. Ten potential N-glyc sites were recognized in the SIVsm V1V2
region, with the average virus encoding 7.2 N-glyc sites.
The neutralization resistant SIVmac239 strain contains 8
predicted glycosylation sequences in the same region,
while some other macaque-adapted SIVs appear to have
fewer N-glyc sites, especially in the V1 region [28]. Thus,
like SIVcpz in a naturally infected chimpanzee [71],
SIVsm appears to be highly glycosylated in naturally
infected SMs. Presumably, continually evolving antibody
responses in these natural hosts maintain a highly glycosylated surface protein, albeit without effectively suppressing virus replication. Our observation of an inverse
relationship between N-glyc site density and SIVsm V1V2
sequence diversity might result from the more highly gly-

cosylated viral variants being better shielded from the
diversifying selection pressures of anti-SIV antibodies
than less glycosylated variants, as recently suggested for
HIV [55]. Thus, antibody-mediated pressures on the
SIVsm envelope glycoprotein appear to exist in this natural host reservoir species, and serve to continually select
for adaptations in envelope sequence and structure.
In contrast to env, SIVsm gag p27 was under strong purifying selection in infected SMs. Temporal analyses of gag
p27 demonstrated no evidence of the fixation of specific
aa substitutions, suggesting that gag p27 is not the target
of strong selective pressures such as those that might be
expected if anti-Gag cellular immune responses were
present. These observations corroborate our findings that
natural SM hosts mount limited cellular immune
responses to SIV infection [22,23,72].

Comparison of SIVsm and HIV-1 V1V2 sequences
Comparison of SIVsm and HIV-1 V1V2 sequences. Longitudinal SIVsm and HIV-1 env sequences were aligned and
homologous regions were compared with respect to nucleotide diversity, sequence length, and glycosylation density at an early
time point (Time 1) and a time point approximately 2.5 years later (Time 2). (A) Standard box and whisker plots of the distributions of intra-animal pairwise nucleotide diversity. Time 1 is in white, time 2 is in gray, and circles represent outliers of the

comparison, demonstrates that natural SIVsm V1V2 diversity is as great, if not greater than that observed in HIV-1infected humans. Since average pairwise diversity is an
indirect measure of viral effective population size [73],
these results suggest that an equivalent number of target
cells are infected in both SM and human immunodeficiency virus infections. The similar levels of viral variation
may also indicate that selective forces acting on env V1V2
are comparable in both SIVsm-infected natural mangabey
reservoir hosts and in HIV-infected humans. A caveat of
these SIV and HIV sequence comparisons is that this protein is quite divergent between the two viruses, and it is
possible that this region of env could be under different
functional and immune selection pressures in the two
hosts.
As V1V2 is primarily a target of the antibody response, it
will be important to more thoroughly characterize in natural hosts SIVsm variation in viral genome regions known

to encode multiple cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes
in non-natural hosts (such as humans and macaques).
Such studies could help to elucidate the selective pressures
exerted by the natural host on other genome regions and
inform us as to the potential for genetic plasticity in viral
genes that are targeted by current CTL-focused HIV vaccine strategies.
The observation that high-level virus replication and
extensive sequence diversification do not harm SMs is
consistent with the notion that the direct effects of SIV
replication are not sufficient to explain AIDS [44,45,74].
Instead, our studies of natural host responses to infection
indicate that indirect mechanisms, such as host inflammatory immune responses elicited by virus infection,
likely play a role in the development of AIDS in new nonnatural hosts [22,23]. Because the humoral immune
responses in naturally infected SMs do not significantly
suppress virus replication, they may actually serve to pro-

mote the continuous selection of env sequences and structures [75]. This helps to explain how the unique SIV/HIV
Env structure has evolved in lower primates, resulting in a
virus that is extremely difficult to neutralize [75,76]. This
continuous diversifying selection pressure likely also
serves to generate variants with expanded cell tropisms
that are well suited to adapt to new host cellular environments [24]. For instance, a spectrum of variant SIV Env
conformations with differing requirements for the levels
of CD4 on target cells might help to breach species differences in CD4 molecules, which are generally not as well
conserved as the viral co-receptors such as CCR5 [77,78].
Thus, high viral variability and recombination within a
natural reservoir host or host population will increase the
likelihood that variants with the ability to replicate in new
host species exist. The ongoing intra-host diversification
of human-adapted RNA viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis
C virus, enables these viruses to continually respond to
changing pressures, such as those imposed by immune
responses and antiviral therapies, making treatment of
these human diseases a formidable challenge [52,79,80].

Conclusion
The extent of intra-host SIVsm env diversification in its
natural reservoir likely underlies the ease with which certain SIVs infect new host species [20,24]. As new human
pathogens emerge, much focus is placed on viral evolution in the newly infected hosts, such as adaptive mutations that facilitate robust replication and pathogenesis.
However, our studies of SIVsm demonstrate that an
important source of viral variation and thus adaptive
potential can be found within the viral populations of
individual reservoir host animals. This extensive intra-animal viral variation, which is likely key to facilitating crossspecies transmission events, may be a common zoonotic
signature among diverse emergent pathogens.

Materials and methods
Specimens and RT-PCR
Five age-matched, naturally SIV-infected SMs from the
colony at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center,
Atlanta, GA were chosen for study. Individual animals
were between 8 and 12 years of age and were estimated to
have been infected for approximately 3 to 9 years, based
on available HIV-2 seroconversion data. Thus, all animals
were born in, and acquired their SIVsmm infection in,
captivity. Group housing of the animals confounds identification of potential donor-recipient pairs. Plasma from
animals FQi, FJo, FFj, FDo, and FBo was obtained on 313-99, 5-12-99, and 5-10-01 and viral RNA was extracted
and quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay designed to
quantitatively detect the diverse SIVsmm variants [23].
Viral RNA was diluted such that approximately 2500 copies of viral RNA were used in a Superscript™ First-Strand
Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen Corporation,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/19

Carlsbad, CA.), following the protocol provided, primed
by random hexamers. 2 µL of cDNA from the RT-PCR was
used for PCR amplification of both env V1V2 and gag p27
with Qiagen HotStar Taq (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA.).
The env V1V2 region was amplified with the forward
primer V1V2DF (5'-TTTGATGCNTGGAAYAAYAC-3') corresponding to bp 6774–6792 of the SIVsmmH4 genome
(GenBank accession no. X14307), and the reverse primer
V1V2DR (5'-CATAGCATCCCARTARTGCTT-3') corresponding to bp 7217–7238 of the SIVsmmH4 genome.
The primer pair amplified a 421 bp fragment spanning the
V1–V2 hypervariable region of envelope. The gag region
was amplified using shortgagF1 (5'TTAAGTCCAAGAACATTAAATGC-3') and shortgagR (5'GTAGAACCTGTCTACATAGCT-3') which correspond to bp 1493–1515 and
19371957 of SIVsmmH4, respectively, yielding a 421 bp
product of the 5' end of the p27 capsid protein. Primers
were designed by choosing highly conserved regions from
an alignment of all SIV and HIV2 env and gag sequences
from the HIV sequence database [81]. Conditions for each
reaction were 30 min. at 50°C, 15 min. at 95°C, followed
by 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min., 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 1 min. A final extension time was carried out for 5 min.
at 72°C. No-template controls and negative controls from
the RNA extraction were used in each set of reactions, both
RT and PCR, to ensure that no cross contamination
occurred at either step. RT-PCR sensitivity was determined
to be = 500 copies per reaction.
Cloning and DNA sequencing
PCR products from each sample were run on a 1.5% lowmelt agarose gel. The resulting 425 bp V1V2 or 421 bp gag
product was extracted and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO
vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). From Rodrigo
et al. [82] it was determined that if 2500 copies of viral
RNA are used in the RT-PCR reaction, 20 clones picked
from the PCR product will be unique. Therefore, approximately 20 clones from V1V2 and 10 from gag (due to
lower expected diversity in this conserved gene) at each
time point and each animal were randomly selected and
sequenced using the M13F and M13R primers using the
dye terminator cycle sequencing method with an MJ
Research automated sequencer.
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned using the program CLUSTAL X
[83], followed by manual adjustment using MacClade 4.0
[84] and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [85]. Nonaligned regions of length variation in V1 and V2 were
removed (corresponding to nucleotides 6932–6974), and
sequences containing internal stop codons or frame shifts
were also excluded from analysis as these are thought to
be PCR artifacts [86].

For tree construction, the Modeltest program [87] was
used to construct and evaluate the DNA substitution models used. Based on the Modeltest results phylogenetic
analysis on sequences obtained from successive time
points during the acute infection was performed by maximum likelihood (ML) using the program Treefinder [88].
The general-time-reversible model, which allows for rate
variation between sites [89-91], was used, and the shape
parameter (α) of the gamma distribution used in this
model was estimated, as were base frequencies and substitution rate parameters. Bootstrap support was determined
with 1,000 resamplings of the ML tree using distance
methods in PAUP4.0b10*, incorporating the estimated
rate parameters. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from
all clones obtained from V1V2 and gag and also separately
on V1V2 and gag sequences obtained from each animal at
each time point by maximum likelihood (ML) using the
program Treefinder.

tion, and predicted N-linked glycosylation site diversity.
For V1V2 nt diversity comparisons, sequences from both
SMs and patients were aligned and stripped of gaps. Pairwise estimates of intra-host nt diversity were calculated
using Mega 2.1 [96]. For sequence length variation, alignments (including gaps) of both SIVsm and HIV-1 were
pared down to the V1V2 region as defined by the flanking
regions of extreme conservation. For this test, homology
of each amino acid site was not as important as the overall
homology of the region. Mean-squared error variance was
determined by ANOVA in R [97] for both glycosylation
density and sequence length in each species at each time
point. Variances were compared manually using an Fmax
test.

The cumulative number of nonsynonymous (dN) and
synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions was estimated
using SNAP, Synonymous/Non-synonymous Analysis
[81] which calculates rates of nucleotide substitution
based on the method of Nei and Gojobori [92], and incorporating a statistic developed in Ota and Nei [93]. Viral
diversity at each time point was determined by calculating
the pairwise nucleotide distances for each of the clones
using the method of Tamura and Nei [94], and pairwise
amino acid distances using the Gamma distance method
in the program MEGA 2.1 [95]. Average dN and dS were
calculated using the modified Nei-Gojobori method in
MEGA 2.1. Phylogenetic trees constructed with synonymous or nonsynonymous sites only were constructed in
MEGA 2.1 using distance methods, incorporating the
Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution with
gamma-distributed rates. All statistics were computed
using SYSTAT 10.
Temporal analysis of V1V2 sequences from individual
animals
In order to show that viral populations do not vary randomly through time, random trees of all variants from
each animal were generated and the number of matching
time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic clade
was counted for each random tree. For the random trees,
the number of matching time-point sequences that comprise a monophyletic group are Poisson distributed. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare our
observed trees with those built from randomly sampled
sequences.
