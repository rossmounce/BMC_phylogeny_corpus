Abstract
Background: Difference in severity of dengue outbreaks has been related to virus serotype, genotype and clades
within genotypes. Till the 1980 s, India and Sri Lanka reported low number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
cases despite circulation of all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Since the 1990 s the occurrence of DHF has
increased. The increase has been attributed to changes in virus lineage especially with regard to DENV-2 and
DENV-3. DENV-1 has been associated with dengue fever (DF) outbreaks and DENV-4 reports have been rare. The
emergence of DENV-4 was reported recently in 2003 in Delhi and in 2007 in Hyderabad. The last report of DENV-4
from Maharashtra was in 1975 from Amalner.
Results: We report on the detection of DENV-4 in Pune, Maharashtra after an absence of almost 30 years. Two
cases were detected in 2009-10, serotyped by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Both the cases were recorded as severe dengue (Category 3) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level of treatment.
Depending on the hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody titres the 2009 case was characterized as a primary
infection and the 2010 case as a secondary infection. Both the cases presented plasma leakage and neither
showed any kind of haemorrhage. The 2009 case survived while the 2010 case was fatal. An isolate was obtained
from the 2009 case. Based on envelope (E) gene sequence analysis, the virus belonged to genotype I of DENV-4,
and clustered with isolates from India and Sri Lanka and was distant from the isolates from Thailand. The
nucleotide and amino acid diversity of the E gene of the Indian isolates increased from 1996 to 2007 to 2009 in
context of the E gene sequences of other isolates belonging to genotype I.
Conclusion: The increasing diversity in the circulating DENV-4 calls for close monitoring of the DENV-4 serotype.

Approach
The National Institute of Virology is the WHO Collaborating Centre For Arbovirus And Hemorrhagic Fever
Reference And Research. We work in close collaboration
with clinicians in providing dengue diagnosis. Samples
from suspected dengue cases are tested for dengue specific IgM, using NIV MAC-ELISA kit [1], viral RNA
using dengue-specific real time RT-PCR [2] and serotyped by multiplex nested RT-PCR test [3]. As a gold
standard, virus isolation is attempted by infecting C6/36
cells (Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line) with patient

sera. The infected cells are examined for the presence of
virus by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and RT-PCR.
Sequencing of viral RNA is carried out using big dye
terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA,
USA). The infection is characterized as primary or secondary based on the HI antibody response.

Findings
Our studies on Dengue in Pune from 2002 to 2008
revealed that DENV-1, 2 and 3 were co-circulating in
Pune (unpublished data). From May 2009 to September
2010, 56 cases could be serotyped by the multiplex RTPCR test. Thirteen cases of DENV-1, 21 of DENV-2,
20 of DENV-3 and two of DENV-4 were detected.
The serotype was confirmed by sequencing the

amplicon. The first DENV-4 case, Case 1, occurred at
the end of the seasonal outbreak period in November
2009. The second case, Case 2 was in the early phase of
the season in June 2010. The two cases were hospitalised patients and underwent standard daily clinical evaluation and physical examinations. The case history
forms of the patients were filled from the time of admission. Neither of the patients had any recorded history of
dengue infection in the past. Both cases presented
severe manifestations and required ICU level of care.
They could thus be considered as Category 3 (patients
requiring bed rest, intensive care-unit level observation
protocol) according to the new WHO classification system, which depends on the intervention protocol [4].
Both the cases presented the common symptoms of
dengue and symptoms indicative of plasma leakage
(Table 1). Case 1 recovered while Case 2 died. Both
cases had thrombocytopenia, however the counts normalized by day 5 (post hospitalisation) in Case 1 while it
continued to decline in Case 2. Both cases had no symptoms of haemorrhage. There was mild ascites in Case 1,
who survived and pleural effusion in Case 2, who died.
Respiratory distress has been reported in death cases of
dengue [5,6]. Case 2 had severe liver damage as

indicated by the dramatic increase in the ALT/AST
levels (>1000 IU/L). Liver damage is one of the major
symptoms reported for DHF/DSS cases in India [7].
DENV-specific IgM antibodies were assessed in serum
samples collected on 5 th day post onset of illness for
Case 1 and 4th day post onset of illness for Case 2. Case
1 was positive for IgM while Case 2 was negative. The
titre of HI antibodies in the serum was determined to
define whether the individuals had suffered primary or
secondary infections. HI antibody titre of >1:2560 in the
acute phase of infection is considered confirmatory of
secondary infection [8]. Case 1 had very low levels of HI
antibodies (1:40 to 1:80) indicating a primary infection.
Case 2 had HI titre of 1:2560 indicating a secondary
infection. The serum samples were also tested in the
dengue IgG capture ELISA (Panbio Ltd.) and showed
the presence of 31 units of IgG in Case 1 and 78 units
in Case 2.
DENV-4 as the aetiological agent was confirmed by
multiplex RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplicon.
Sequence analysis of the 500 bp fragment, which represented the core-prM region, revealed that the 2009 and
2010 viruses had high similarity with each other (>99%).
An isolate was obtained from Case 1 by infecting C6/36

obtained from the serum of Case 2. The envelope (E)
gene was sequenced from the virus obtained after a single passage (HQ600557) and analysed in context with
other sequences of DENV-4, present in the GenBank
using Maximum Likelihood method, PhyML_3.0 [9]. To
date, four genotypes of DENV-4 virus have been
described consisting of viruses from Southeast Asia

The 2009 isolate belonged to genotype I or the South

India/2009) showed a diversity of >4% as compared to
the other Indian isolates of cluster A and 7% as
compared to a Thailand isolate from cluster B. The
amino-acid diversity ranged between 1.6% to 3.1%. The
diversity in nucleotide as well as amino acid sequence of
the E gene of Indian isolates increased from 1996 [GenBank: AB111086] to 2007 [GenBank: HM237348] to
2009 (0952326/India/2009) as shown by the arrows in
Additional file 1: Table S1, when compared to the other
isolates from the region i.e Sri Lanka, Malaysia and
Thailand. The nucleotide diversity observed between the
DENV-4 isolates was much higher than that reported
for DENV-2 isolates within a particular genotype [11].
To strengthen the data and carry out in depth analysis,
isolates from the other centres of India reporting the
circulation of DENV-4 need to be sequenced.

Conclusion
The high degree of diversity in the envelope gene
observed for the DENV-4 viruses circulating on the subcontinent indicates that the serotype is evolving and
that close monitoring of the serotype is needed.
