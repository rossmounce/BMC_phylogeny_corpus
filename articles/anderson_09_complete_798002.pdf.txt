Abstract
Background: Staphylothermus marinus is an anaerobic, sulfur-reducing peptide fermenter of the
archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota. It is the third heterotrophic, obligate sulfur reducing
crenarchaeote to be sequenced and provides an opportunity for comparative analysis of the three
genomes.
Results: The 1.57 Mbp genome of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Staphylothermus marinus
has been completely sequenced. The main energy generating pathways likely involve 2oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases and ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthases. S. marinus possesses
several enzymes not present in other crenarchaeotes including a sodium ion-translocating
decarboxylase likely to be involved in amino acid degradation. S. marinus lacks sulfur-reducing
enzymes present in the other two sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes that have been sequenced –
Thermofilum pendens and Hyperthermus butylicus. Instead it has three operons similar to the mbh and
mbx operons of Pyrococcus furiosus, which may play a role in sulfur reduction and/or hydrogen

production. The two marine organisms, S. marinus and H. butylicus, possess more sodiumdependent transporters than T. pendens and use symporters for potassium uptake while T. pendens
uses an ATP-dependent potassium transporter. T. pendens has adapted to a nutrient-rich
environment while H. butylicus is adapted to a nutrient-poor environment, and S. marinus lies
between these two extremes.
Conclusion: The three heterotrophic sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes have adapted to their
habitats, terrestrial vs. marine, via their transporter content, and they have also adapted to
environments with differing levels of nutrients. Despite the fact that they all use sulfur as an
electron acceptor, they are likely to have different pathways for sulfur reduction.

Background
Crenarchaeota is one of the two major phyla of the
domain Archaea. Many crenarchaeotes are heterotrophic,
anaerobic, sulfur-reducing hyperthermophiles, but the
crenarchaeotes with completely sequenced genomes are
primarily aerobes. Of the archaea with published
genomes, only Hyperthermus butylicus and Thermofilum
pendens are heterotrophic, obligate sulfur-reducing anaerobes [1,2]. More genomes are needed from anaerobic crenarchaeotes in order to determine if their phenotypic
similarities are reflected in their genomes.
Staphylothermus marinus was isolated from a black smoker
and from volcanically heated sediments [3]. It is a hyperthermophile, with a maximum growth temperature of
98°C. Its name reflects its proclivity to form clusters of up
to 100 cells. At high concentrations of yeast extract it
forms large cells up to 15 μm in diameter. It is a strict
anaerobe and grows heterotrophically on complex media.
H2S, CO2, acetate and isovalerate are metabolic products,
suggesting a metabolism similar to that of the Thermococcales of the phylum Euryarchaeota. Dark granules
observed within the cytoplasm may consist of glycogen.
While S. marinus can survive in the absence of sulfur and
produce hydrogen rather than H2S, it requires sulfur for
growth [4]. An unusual cell surface protein named tetrabrachion has been characterized from S. marinus [5], and
a 24-subunit phosphoenolpyruvate-utilizing enzyme with
a unique structure has also been studied [6].
Here we report the complete genome of the anaerobic,
sulfur-reducing archaeon S. marinus and a comparative
analysis with other sulfur-reducing heterotrophic crenarchaeotes. While some features in S. marinus are similar to
H. butylicus [7] and T. pendens [8], including peptide fermentation enzymes, there are also major differences, particularly in the electron transport machinery.

Results
General features
The genome of S. marinus F1 consists of a circular chromosome of 1.57 Mbp. There is one copy each of 5S, 16S, and
23S ribosomal RNA. About 59% of protein-coding genes

begin with an AUG codon, 8% with GUG, and 33% with
UUG. The low number of GUG start codons reflects the
low GC content of this genome (35.7% GC). The ribosomal protein L12ae gene (Smar_1096) does not have a
valid start codon, but this is likely to be an essential gene.
Based on alignment with L12ae proteins from other
archaea, it appears that the S. marinus gene begins with an
ATC start codon. S. marinus has 12 regions of CRISPR
repeats containing between 5 and 17 repeats. Twelve
CRISPR-associated proteins are found in the vicinity of
three of the repeats, between coordinates 323,400 and
345,500 (Smar_0308-Smar_0325), and one other
CRISPR-associated protein is found at a different location
not close to any repeats (Smar_1195).
The genome statistics for S. marinus and the two other sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes are presented in Table 1.
While the genome of H. butylicus is larger than that of S.
marinus, they both have approximately the same number
of genes due to the lower coding percentage of H. butylicus. T. pendens has a larger genome and a greater number
of genes than the other two (discussed below). The GC
content of S. marinus is much lower than the others, but
this is not unusual for a hyperthermophile. It is in the
same range as the GC content of the Sulfolobus genomes,
while Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Nanoarchaeum
equitans have lower GC contents (31% and 32% respectively). T. pendens has a much higher percentage of genes
in paralog clusters than the others, suggesting that gene
duplication and divergence have been more prevalent in
this genome. S. marinus has a smaller percentage of genes
with signal peptides. In all three genomes the predicted
exported proteins are primarily ABC transporter substratebinding proteins and hypothetical proteins. S. marinus
has approximately the same number of ABC transporters
for uptake of nutrients as H. butylicus, but they both have
fewer than T. pendens.
T. pendens has about 270 more protein-coding genes than
the other two, but only about 150 more genes with COG
hits, suggesting that 120 of the additional genes in T. pendens are hypothetical proteins. We compared COG categories [9] between the three crenarchaeotes to determine

what categories were more prevalent in T. pendens compared to the other two (Table 2). T. pendens has a higher
number of genes in many categories, suggesting that the
additional genes are spread out among a number of cellular processes. The three categories with the greatest additional genes in T. pendens are carbohydrate metabolism
and transport, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis,
and function unknown. The greater number of carbohydrate-associated genes is mainly due to a larger number of
transporters. T. pendens has more ABC transporters than
the other two and a phosphotransferase (PTS) system
transporter, as well as a higher number of transporters
assigned to COG2814, arabinose efflux permease, which
are transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. In
addition, T. pendens has three sugar kinases of COG1070,
while the other two have none. Thus T. pendens can probably take up and utilize a greater number of carbohydrates
than the other two. The greater number of cell wall-associated genes in T. pendens is mainly due to a greater
number of glycosyltransferases (COG0438) and nucleotide sugar metabolic enzymes. This suggests that T. pendens has a greater variety of sugars attached to lipids and/
or proteins on the outside of the cell.

The S. marinus genome contains several protein families
not found before in crenarchaeotes, and these are discussed below. S. marinus is the first crenarchaeote found
to have an arginine decarboxylase belonging to COG1166
(Smar_0204), which includes the speA gene of E. coli. This
protein family is also found in one euryarchaeote, Methanosaeta thermophila. Most euryarchaeota have a pyruvoyldependent arginine decarboxylase [10]. T. pendens and
Cenarchaeum symbiosum also contain this type of enzyme.
No arginine decarboxylase has been identified in other
crenarchaeote genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the S.
marinus arginine decarboxylase (not shown) does not
indicate a clear case of lateral gene transfer, and this
enzyme was not identified during the search for laterally
transferred genes (see below).
S. marinus contains a probable cell surface protein
(Smar_0566) with 4 copies of the pfam03640 repeat,
which has not been found in any other crenarchaeal
genome. This repeat is present in two methanogens, Candidatus Methanoregula boonei and Candidatus Methanosphaerula palustris. It is also found in a wide variety of
bacteria, but its function is unknown.

S. marinus is unique among crenarchaeotes in having a
sodium ion-translocating decarboxylase for energy generation (Smar_1503-1504). It also has three putative operons containing subunits of multisubunit cation/proton
antiporters, although these are likely to belong to large
membrane-bound ion-translocating enzyme complexes
rather than acting as cation antiporters (see below). S.
marinus is the first crenarchaeote found to have a type I
restriction-modification system (Smar_0761-0763).
S. marinus has 5 putative transposable elements. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all of them belong to family
IS607 (not shown). The characterized members of this IS
family contain two ORFs. In S. marinus one of the elements contains two ORFs while the other four contain
only one ORF. In the S. marinus element with two ORFs,
the first (Smar_0846) is truncated relative to other members of the family, and is likely to be a pseudogene, while
the second (Smar_0847) is intact. The four elements with
one ORF share a high degree of similarity to each other
(Smar_0083, Smar_0767, Smar_1150, Smar_1546), suggesting that they have been recently duplicated. In addition, there are 14 copies of a repeated sequence of
approximately 260 nucleotides, although some of the
repeats are truncated at one or both ends. These repeats
are likely to be miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) as they are flanked by inverted repeats and
have similarity to a region of DNA upstream of the group
of four transposase ORFs (Figure 1). MITEs have previously been identified in some archaeal genomes [11]. Two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/145

ORFs are disrupted by MITEs, a protein with ABC transporter
ATPase
and
acetyltransferase
domains
(Smar_0733) and a PIN domain protein (Smar_0327/
0328). The presence of disrupted genes suggests that the
MITEs have been active recently, although they do not
appear to have had a major impact on the genome content.
Twenty-one probable laterally transferred genes were
identified using the program SIGI-HMM [12]. One gene is
by itself (Smar_0375), there are three pairs of genes
(Smar_0568-0569, Smar_0846-0847, and Smar_11441145) and there is one cluster of 17 genes (Smar_15251541) in which 14 of the genes are predicted to be laterally transferred. Twelve of the laterally transferred genes
are predicted to have come from other Crenarchaeota, six
from Euryarchaeota, and the remaining three have
unknown donors. Six of the 17 genes are likely to be pseudogenes, suggesting that they were transferred but then
are degrading. From these findings we conclude that lateral transfer has not played a large role in shaping S. marinus gene content, and most if not all gene transfers have
come from other archaea.
Metabolism/transport
The presence of transporters for peptides and carbohydrates suggests that both types of compounds can serve as
carbon and energy sources. S. marinus has four ABC transporters for carbohydrates (Smar_0088-0091, Smar_01080111, Smar_0299-0302, Smar_1146-1149) and two for

peptides (Smar_0270-0274, Smar_0342-0346). It has a
carbohydrate secondary transporter of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide (GPH) family (Smar_0710), and it is
the first crenarchaeote found to have a peptide transporter
of the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family
(Smar_1400). There are no ABC transporters for amino
acids, but a probable amino acid transporter of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family is present
(Smar_0285). The presence of secondary transporters
(GPH, OPT, and NSS), which have low affinity and high
capacity, suggests that there are times when S. marinus is
exposed to high levels of nutrients, and it can conserve
energy by using secondary transporters instead of ATPdependent transporters.
S. marinus has a glycolysis pathway similar to Aeropyrum
pernix, with ATP-dependent glucokinase (Smar_1514)
and phosphofructokinase (Smar_0007). Glycogen synthase (Smar_1393) and phosphorylase (Smar_0246) are
present, suggesting that the dark granules observed in S.
marinus cells are composed of glycogen. Similar to other
crenarchaeotes and thermococci, S. marinus has pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Smar_1447-1450) and
ADP-forming
acetyl-CoA
synthase
(Smar_0449,
Smar_1241-1242) for ATP synthesis from pyruvate. Three
other 2-ketoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases are present
(Smar_0291-292, Smar_0997-1000, Smar_1443-1444)
that are probably involved in amino acid degradation.
S. marinus is unique in Crenarchaeota in having a sodiumtranslocating decarboxylase. Smar_1504 and Smar_1503
encode the beta and gamma subunits (beta and delta in
methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase). There are two possibilities for the activity of this decarboxylase (Figure 2).
With Smar_1426 and Smar_1427 these genes could form
a methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Smar_1426 and
Smar_1504 are closely related to predicted methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase subunits of Pyrococcus species. This
enzyme would be involved in catabolism of succinyl-CoA
resulting from glutamate degradation via a 2oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Figure 2). However,
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and epimerase were not
found in the genome. The other possible function is
oxaloacetate decarboxylase with Smar_0341 as the alpha
subunit. This would be involved in catabolism of aspartate (Figure 2). However Smar_0341 is also related to
pyruvate carboxylase B subunits of euryarchaeotes, and
could interact with Smar_0140 to form this enzyme
instead of or in addition to a sodium-transporting decarboxylase.
S. marinus, like the other heterotrophic crenarchaeotes H.
butylicus and T. pendens, has lost almost all amino acid
biosynthetic enzymes, although it has retained a few pathways for specific physiological reasons. For instance,

glutamine is needed for its function as a nitrogen donor.
Like the other heterotrophic crenarchaeotes, S. marinus
can make pyrimidines but not purines. Enzymes for synthesis of several cofactors are present in S. marinus, in contrast to T. pendens, which lacks many cofactor synthesis
pathways. S. marinus can likely synthesize riboflavin, pyridoxine, and coenzyme A, but it probably must acquire
heme from the environment.
Electron transport/sulfur reduction
S. marinus requires sulfur for growth and reduces it to
sulfide [4], but it lacks homologs of proteins implicated in
sulfur reduction in other organisms. It has no genes similar to sulfhydrogenases [13,14] and the recently discovered NADPH:sulfur oxidoreductase [15] from P. furiosus.
It also lacks genes with similarity to the molybdoenzymes
polysulfide reductase of Wolinella succinogenes [16], sulfur
reductase of Acidianus ambivalens [17], sulfur reductase of
Aquifex aeolicus [18], and thiosulfate/sulfur reductase of
Salmonella enterica [19]. S. marinus has a gene
(Smar_1055) with 56% similarity to sulfide dehydrogenase SudA subunit from P. furiosus [20], but this gene is
shorter than the P. furiosus gene by 120 amino acids and
the beta subunit is not present in S. marinus. Thus, this

enzyme is unlikely to be present in S. marinus. However S.
marinus has three putative operons similar in composition
to the mbh and mbx operons of Thermococcales (Table 3).
These multisubunit complexes are not found in any other
sequenced crenarchaeote. The mbh operon from P. furiosus
encodes a membrane-bound hydrogenase that oxidizes
ferredoxin [21], while the mbx operon has a yet to be
defined role in electron transfer. Its proposed function is
the transfer of electrons from ferredoxin to NADPH coupled with proton translocation across the cell membrane
[15]. A similar complex present only in Pyrococcus abyssi

(PAB1395-1401) is adjacent to formate dehydrogenase
subunits and has similarity to E. coli hydrogenases 3 and
4. Thus, it is likely to be a formate hydrogen lyase.
The S. marinus mbh/mbx-related complexes contain a set of
proteins similar to components of multisubunit cation/
proton antiporters and another set with similarity to
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits (Table 4).
The S. marinus antiporter-related subunits show high similarity to each other and to the corresponding subunits of
the P. abyssi putative formate hydrogen lyase. S. marinus

does not have an identifiable formate dehydrogenase, so
these complexes likely have a different function in S. marinus. The S. marinus and P. abyssi proteins form a distinct
cluster separate from mbh and mbx complexes and from
the related cation/proton antiporters (Figure 3). In contrast, the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase-related subunits in the S. marinus putative operons are not closely
related to each other or to the corresponding P. abyssi formate hydrogen lyase proteins. These findings indicate that
the antiporter-related subunits form a cassette that has
been duplicated in S. marinus and combined with
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase-related subunits that
are divergent in sequence.
S. marinus produces hydrogen when sulfur is limiting [4].
Two of the multisubunit complexes are potentially
involved in hydrogen production. One set of S. marinus
proteins (Smar_1060-Smar_1063) clusters strongly with
E. coli hydrogenases 3 and 4 in phylogenetic trees, and
may form a membrane-bound hydrogenase. Smar_0018
and Smar_0020 have similarity (61% and 39%, respectively) to subunits of Methanosarcina mazei ech hydrogenase subunits, and hydrogenase accessory proteins are
found in their vicinity (Smar_0012-0013, Smar_0015). It
is likely that at least one of these clusters is involved in
hydrogen production.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/145

The other complexes may be involved in sulfur reduction
either directly or indirectly. One of the clusters
(Smar_1057-1071) is close on the chromosome to a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase (Smar_1055). It
is possible that this cluster is involved in sulfur respiration, where Smar_1055 acts as a NAD(P)H-dependent
polysulfide reductase and the other ORFs are involved in
the generation of NAD(P)H through a membrane-based
electron transport system that oxidizes reduced ferredoxin
and translocates protons across the membrane. The system would allow energy generation from an overall sulfur-dependent oxidation of peptides and amino acids and
it would be similar to the mbx-NAD(P)H elemental sulfur
oxidoreductase (NSR) system that has been described for
P. furiosus [15].
Comparison of the three sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes
Spectral clustering was used to create protein clusters from
the three anaerobic sulfur-reducing heterotrophs, and the
clusters shared by all three or by pairs of the three were
derived (Figure 4) and [see Additional file 1]. The three
organisms share 571 core clusters, somewhat more than
the conserved crenarchaeal core of 336 determined by
Makarova et al. [22]. Among the clusters conserved
among the three but not found in all Crenarchaeota are
the subunits of ABC transporters for sugars, peptides, and

antiporters

amino acids, which are required for their heterotrophic
lifestyle. Also falling into this group are the ferrous iron
transporter proteins FeoA and FeoB and the anaerobic
form of ribonucleotide reductase, proteins which reflect
their anaerobicity. S. marinus and H. butylicus have almost
twice as many shared clusters (225) as either one has with
T. pendens (119 or 126). This is due to their closer phylogenetic relationship. S. marinus and H. butylicus both
belong to the order Desulfurococcales while T. pendens
belongs to the order Thermoproteales.
The major difference in habitat between these three organisms is that S. marinus and H. butylicus were isolated from
marine environments [1,3] while T. pendens was isolated
from a terrestrial solfatara [2]. Marine environments have
relatively high concentrations of sodium and potassium
compared to terrestrial springs, and this influences the
complement of transporters encoded by the three
genomes. For example, S. marinus and H. butylicus use the
Trk type of potassium transporter (COG0168), which is a
proton or sodium symporter, while T. pendens uses the
more energy-intensive ATP-dependent kdp-type potassium transporter (COG2060, COG2216, COG2156).
Also, S. marinus and H. butylicus have a greater number
and variety of sodium symporters than T. pendens. They
both have sodium-dependent multidrug efflux pumps of
the MATE family (COG0534) and amino acid transporters of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family
(pfam00209), while only S. marinus has a transporter of
the sodium:solute symporter family (pfam00474).
Both T. pendens and H. butylicus have formate dehydrogenases while S. marinus lacks this enzyme. Formate can be
used as an electron donor with sulfur as electron acceptor
to generate energy. S. marinus also lacks the FdhE protein,
which is involved in formate dehydrogenase formation,
while the other two have it.
There are also differences in the ability to utilize carbohydrates among the three organisms. As discussed above, T.
pendens has a greater number of carbohydrate transporters
than the other two. According to the CAZy database http:/
/www.cazy.org[23], H. butylicus has no glycosyl hydrolases, while S. marinus has ten and T. pendens has fifteen.
Also H. butylicus apparently does not store glycogen as it
lacks glycogen synthase and phosphorylase, but the other
two have these. H. butylicus also lacks enzymes for utilization of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. Surprisingly
while S. marinus and T. pendens have probable glucokinases related to the characterized Aeropyrum pernix
enzyme [24], H. butylicus has a protein related to the
broad-specificity hexokinase from Sulfolobus tokodaii [25].
This suggests that, while it may not be able to break down
polysaccharides, it may be able to utilize simple sugars.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/145

There are similarities and differences among the three
genomes in the genes involved in biosynthesis. Many of
the genes shared by S. marinus and H. butylicus but missing
from T. pendens are involved in cofactor metabolism. T.
pendens appears to be unable to make riboflavin, coenzyme A, pyridoxine, and possibly other cofactors, and it
has transporters for biotin and riboflavin that are not
found in the other two. Among the three organisms only
H. butylicus has a heme biosynthesis pathway. On the
other hand, all three organisms are unable to make most
amino acids and purines, although they do have the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. S. marinus and H. butylicus
have ABC transporters of the basic membrane protein
family (pfam02608) that probably transport nucleosides
[26], but T. pendens lacks this type of transporter. In fact T.
pendens does not have any identifiable nucleoside or
nucleobase transporters, so it likely has undiscovered families to transport these compounds.
There are other differences between these three organisms
that do not directly reflect the habitats they live in. H.
butylicus is surprisingly lacking some enzymes of central
metabolism. It has no identifiable fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase and no phosphoenolpyruvate synthase or pyruvate phosphate dikinase. Since fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase is essential for hexose and pentose synthesis, it
likely has a new version of this enzyme. H. butylicus also
does not have an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase; however,
it is the only one of the three to have an Asp-tRNA(Asn)/
Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, but the A subunit of
this enzyme (Hbut_0594) has a frameshift. Since this
appears to be an essential enzyme for H. butylicus, the gene
may still be functional.

Discussion
The crenarchaeotes H. butylicus, S. marinus, and T. pendens
are similar phenotypically in that they all degrade peptides and/or carbohydrates using 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin
oxidoreductases, they are anaerobes, and they are dependent on sulfur reduction to dispose of electrons. They all
have genomes in the size range of 1.6–1.8 Mbp. Having
these three genome sequences allows comparative studies
to determine whether their phenotypic similarity is
reflected in their genome sequences.
While the central metabolic pathways for generation of
ATP from peptides appear to be similar between the three,
there are also differences. For instance there are different
sets of transporters used by the marine organisms versus
the terrestrial one. However the biggest differences
between the three relate to the availability of nutrients.
On one extreme is H. butylicus, which has no glycosidases
and is capable of synthesizing most if not all cofactors it
needs. This organism appears to be more specialized than

reductase, and it is the only crenarchaeote other than C.

T. pendens and H. butylicus also have putative NADPH:sulfur oxidoreductases similar to the P. furiosus enzyme [15],
which is also absent in S. marinus. However, S. marinus
has three mbh/mbx-related multisubunit complexes,
which are not found in the other two genomes. The overall picture of sulfur reduction shows that T. pendens and H.
butylicus may use similar pathways, while S. marinus uses
different ones. This is in contrast to the phylogenetic positions of these organisms: S. marinus and H. butylicus
belong to the order Desulfurococcales, while T. pendens
belongs to the order Thermoproteales. The molybdoenzymes are widespread within Crenarchaeota, missing only
in S. marinus, and may represent the ancestral path for sulfur reduction in Crenarchaeota. This analysis, however,
rests on comparison to sulfur reduction enzymes characterized in other organisms, and new sulfur reduction
pathways may be identified in the future.

the other two in that it is restricted to the use of peptides
and amino acids as energy sources, although formate can
also be utilized. On the other extreme is T. pendens which
has many glycosidases and relies on its environment for
most cofactors, thus it is used to being in a nutrient-rich
environment. Probably a terrestrial solfatara environment
allows nutrients to be concentrated as compared to
marine environments in which nutrients may be quickly
dispersed. S. marinus falls in the middle ground as it has
several glycosidases like T. pendens but it encodes most
cofactor biosynthesis pathways like H. butylicus. Its use of
secondary transporters and ABC transporters suggests that
at least at some times it is exposed to high levels of nutrients. It is adapted to an environment that contains carbohydrates as well as proteinaceous substrates, but in which
cofactors are not present at high levels.
Characterized membrane-bound sulfur and polysulfide
reductases have three subunits [16-19]. The A and B subunits are related in sequence, but the C subunits belong to
different protein families. T. pendens and H. butylicus have
putative three-subunit sulfur reductases in which all subunits are adjacent on the chromosome. These complexes
have the standard A and B subunits, but they differ in their
C subunits. The T. pendens C subunit belongs to the same
family as the W. succinogenes psrC subunit, while the H.

The three heterotrophic sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes
have adapted to their habitats, terrestrial vs. marine, via
their transporter content, and they have also adapted to
environments with differing levels of nutrients, with T.
pendens being adapted to a nutrient-rich environment and
H. butylicus adapted to an environment in which only peptides are present. S. marinus appears to have different electron transport pathways compared to the phenotypically
similar organisms T. pendens and H. butylicus, showing
that this phenotype is not encoded by the same genotype
in these organisms.

Methods
S. marinus strain F1 is available from the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(DSMZ) as DSM 3639T and from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) as ATCC 43588. T. pendens Hrk5
is available from DSMZ as DSM 2475, and H. butylicus is
available from DSMZ as DSM 5456. S. marinus F1 cells
were grown in a 300 liter fermenter at 85°C in SME
medium with 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% peptone, and 0.7%
elemental sulfur under a 200 kPa N2 atmosphere. Cells
grew to a density of 3 × 108 cells/ml in 3 days. Cell pellets
were stored at -85°C. DNA was extracted based on the
method of Zhou et al. [27]. One gram of cells was dissolved in 4.5 ml extraction buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0,
100 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium phosphate, and 1.5 M
NaCl). After 200 micrograms of proteinase K were added,
cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. A solution of
0.5 ml 20% SDS was added, and then the mixture was
incubated at 65°C for 2 hours. Proteins were removed by

extraction with 5 ml phenol. The sample was centrifuged
for 30 minutes at 19000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at
10°C, and the upper phase was discarded. The sample was
then extracted twice with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol
(24:1) to remove phenol. DNA was precipitated with 3 ml
isopropanol at room temperature overnight. The sample
was then centrifuged for 30 minutes. The pellet was
washed with 5 ml 70% ethanol and recentrifuged. The
pellet was dried and then dissolved in 1 ml LiChrosolv
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). RNA was removed by
addition of 20 μg DNAse-free RNAse and incubation for 4
hours at 37°C.
The genome of S. marinus was sequenced at the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) using a combination of 3 kb, 8–10
kb and 40 kb (fosmid) DNA libraries. For all three libraries, shearing is followed by blunt end repair; then the
DNA is isolated on an agarose gel and the appropriate section of the gel is cut out. For fosmid libraries, DNA is separated on a pulsed-field gel. DNA is extracted from the gel
and then cloned into the pUC18 vector for 3 kb libraries,
the pMCL200 vector for 8–10 kb libraries, or the
pCC1FOS vector for 40 kb fosmid libraries. Sequencing is
carried out from both ends of the inserts using BigDye Terminators and ABI3730XL DNA sequencers. More detailed
information about library construction and sequencing,
including protocols and reagents, is available at http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/protocols/
prots_production.html. Draft assemblies were based on
23766 total reads. All three libraries provided 13.3× coverage of the genome. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software
package http://www.phrap.com was used for sequence
assembly and quality assessment [28-30]. All mis-assemblies were corrected and all gaps between contigs were
closed by custom primer walk using subclones or PCR
products as templates. A total of 657 additional reactions
were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the
finished sequence. The Phred quality score for this
genome is Q50, which corresponds to one miscalled base
per 100,000 bases. The genome sequence of S. marinus
can be accessed in GenBank [GenBank: CP000575]. The
Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) accession number is
http://genomesonline.org/GOLD_CARDS/
Gc00511.html. Genes were identified using a combination of Critica [31] and Glimmer [32] followed by a round
of manual curation.
Analysis of the S. marinus genome was carried out with the
Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system [33]. Proteins unique to S. marinus or missing from S. marinus but
present in other crenarchaeotes were identified with the
phylogenetic profiler in IMG. Transposable elements were
identified by BLAST against the ISFinder database [34].
CRISPR repeats were identified with the CRISPR Recognition Tool [35].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/145

Laterally transferred genes were identified with SIGIHMM [12]. DNA and protein alignments were generated
with CLUSTAL W [36]. The phylogenetic tree was generated with MrBayes 3.1.2 [37] with 1,000,000 generations
sampled every 100 generations. The first 250,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. The tree was viewed and
manipulated with njplot [38].
To generate clusters for comparative genomics, we
retrieved all amino acid sequences for S. marinus, H. butylicus, and T. pendens along with their blastp [39] (e-value <
10-6) similarity scores, from the Integrated Microbial
Genomes database [33]. Thereafter, we divided the resulting network of protein similarities into distinct similarity
matrices. Each matrix (cluster of proteins) was then successively partitioned into two child clusters using a spectral clustering procedure [40,41]. This procedure is
analogous to a random walk of a particle moving over the
proteins of the network. At each transition, the particle
moves to an adjacent protein with probabilities corresponding to the similarity between proteins. The amount
of time the particle spends in a given sub-network will
determine whether this is indeed a cluster of its own or
not. The magnitude of the second eigenvalue of the similarity matrix for a network will determine how fast the
particle approaches its stationary distribution [42]. Here,
we chose to partition the network if the second eigenvalue
was 0.8 or more. This approach resulted in 1041 clusters
of a total of 2653 proteins with homologs within two or
more of the organisms.
