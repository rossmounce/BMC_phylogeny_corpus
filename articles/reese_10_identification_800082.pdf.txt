Abstract
Background: La Crosse virus (LACV) is a pathogenic arbovirus that is transovarially transmitted by Aedes triseriatus
mosquitoes and overwinters in diapausing eggs. However, previous models predicted transovarial transmission (TOT)
to be insufficient to maintain LACV in nature.
Results: To investigate this issue, we reared mosquitoes from field-collected eggs and assayed adults individually for
LACV antigen, viral RNA by RT-PCR, and infectious virus. The mosquitoes had three distinct infection phenotypes: 1)
super infected (SI+) mosquitoes contained infectious virus, large accumulations of viral antigen and RNA and
comprised 17 of 17,825 (0.09%) of assayed mosquitoes, 2) infected mosquitoes (I+) contained no detectable infectious
virus, lesser amounts of viral antigen and RNA, and comprised 3.7% of mosquitoes, and 3) non-infected mosquitoes (I-)
contained no detectable viral antigen, RNA, or infectious virus and comprised 96.21% of mosquitoes. SI+ mosquitoes
were recovered in consecutive years at one field site, suggesting that lineages of TOT stably-infected and
geographically isolated Ae. triseriatus exist in nature. Analyses of LACV genomes showed that SI+ isolates are not
monophyletic nor phylogenetically distinct and that synonymous substitution rates exceed replacement rates in all
genes and isolates. Analysis of singleton versus shared mutations (Fu and Li's F*) revealed that the SI+ LACV M
segment, with a large and significant excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, evolves through disruptive selection
that maintains SI+ alleles at higher frequencies than the average mutation rate. A QTN in the LACV NSm gene was
detected in SI+ mosquitoes, but not in I+ mosquitoes. Four amino acid changes were detected in the LACV NSm gene
from SI+ but not I+ mosquitoes from one site, and may condition vector super infection. In contrast to NSm, the NSs
sequences of LACV from SI+ and I+ mosquitoes were identical.
Conclusions: SI+ mosquitoes may represent stabilized infections of Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes, which could maintain
LACV in nature. A gene-for-gene interaction involving the viral NSm gene and a vector innate immune response gene
may condition stabilized infection.
Background
La Crosse virus (LACV) (Family: Bunyaviridae, Genus:
Orthobunyavirus, Serogroup: California) is the leading
cause of arboviral neuroinvasive disease in children in the
United States [1,2]. LACV encephalitis occurs primarily

in the upper Midwestern and the Eastern United States,
reflecting the distribution of the mosquito vector, Aedes
triseriatus (Say), and its preferred vertebrate hosts, chipmunks and tree squirrels. LACV is transovarially transmitted by Ae. triseriatus and overwinters in the
diapausing eggs [3-5].
In the laboratory, the transovarial transmission (TOT)
rate (percentage of infected females that transmit virus to
their progeny) and filial infection rate (FIR, percentage of

infected progeny from a female) can each exceed 70% [6].
However, LACV infection rates in Ae. triseriatus collected as eggs or larvae from the field are much lower. For
example, LACV was isolated from only 10 of 1,698 (infection rate = 0.006) mosquitoes that were collected as larvae from overwintered eggs [5]. In another study, the
minimum field infection rates for LACV in larvae from
overwintered eggs ranged from 0.003 - 0.006 [7]. The dramatic difference in LACV infection rates between field
and laboratory studies could result from deleterious
effects of virus infection on embryos during stressful
periods, such as overwintering [8], or from virus clearance by the innate immune response of the vector [9-12].
Mathematical models developed to investigate parameters that condition transmission and persistence in nature
of LACV [13] and Keystone virus (KEYV) (Family:
Bunyaviridae, Genus: Orthobunyavirus, Serogroup: California) [14,15] suggested that the observed field infection
rates for LACV are insufficient to maintain the virus in
nature. For KEYV, the model suggests that the TOT rate
must be at least 0.1 and there must be vertebrate-mediated amplification in order for KEYV to be maintained in
nature. Infection rates detected in field collected larvae
are significantly less than 0.1 [4,5,7]. Even when using
infection rates obtained in the laboratory, the models
suggest that LACV could not persist by TOT alone for
more than a few generations [6,13]. Horizontal transmission would be necessary to complement TOT to maintain
a "stable" LACV prevalence from year to year in the vector population. However, herd immunity in chipmunks
and tree squirrels in forested areas can exceed 90%; thus
most mosquito feedings would be on dead end hosts,
interrupting horizontal amplification of the virus [13-15].
Alternate mechanisms must condition LACV persistence
in its endemic foci.
LACV could be maintained in nature by stabilized
infection of Ae. triseriatus. Stabilized infection was first
observed with Sigma virus (SIGMAV, Family: Rhabdoviridae) and Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies [16].
Infection of female D. melanogaster with SIGMAV by
inoculation resulted in a "nonstabilized" infection with a
small proportion of the developing oocytes and the resultant progeny becoming transovarially infected [17]. However, if germarium infection occurred, the progeny were
stably-infected, and SIGMAV was transmitted to nearly
100% of progeny. A relatively small number of stablyinfected females could maintain virus prevalence at a
constant level, assuming that any detrimental effects of
the infection (e.g., longevity, fecundity, and development)
are balanced by horizontal transmission [18,19]. Stabilized infection with California encephalitis virus (CEV)
(Family: Bunyaviridae, Genus: Orthobunyavirus, Serogroup: California) has been demonstrated in Ae. dorsalis

[19]. Stably-infected females transmitted the virus to
more than 90% of progeny through five laboratory generations. Analysis of field collected Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes suggested the possibility of stabilized LACV
infection [20]. Some Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes collected
as eggs from the field and processed individually contained large amounts of LACV antigen and LACV RNA
[20]. We designated these as super-infected (SI+) mosquitoes, and our current working hypothesis is that these
SI+ mosquitoes represent stably-infected lineages of Ae.
triseriatus.
To establish a stabilized infection in Ae. triseriatus,
LACV must avoid or perturb the vector innate immune
response. RNAi and apoptosis are potent anti-arboviral
innate immune responses in mosquitoes [9-12,21,22].
Recent studies revealed the fundamental role of
autophagy in D. melanogaster response to vesicular stomatitis virus infection [23,24]. Importantly, ovarian follicle
degeneration in D. melanogaster is conditioned by both
apoptosis and autophagy, which share some common signaling pathway caspase components [25,26]. Because of
the critical role of TOT, it would be especially important
for LACV to avoid induction of an autophagic response
in infected follicles [27]. Some viruses that infect arthropods have evolved viral inhibitors of RNAi [28]. Tomato
spotted wilt virus (Family: Bunyaviridae, Genus:Tospovirus), NSs protein suppresses RNA silencing in infected
plants [29]. Arboviruses in the family Bunyaviridae can
modulate the vertebrate host innate immune response.
For example, the LACV NSs protein can counteract the
RNAi response [30] and the Rift Valley fever virus (Family: Bunyaviridae, Genus: Phlebovirus) NSm protein can
suppress apoptosis [31] in vertebrate cells. However, little
is known about the role of these genes in perturbing vector innate immune responses. LACV induces an RNAi
response in both Aedes albopictus and Ae. triseriatus
mosquito cell cultures that is not suppressed by the NSs
protein [32], but nothing is known about this response in
vivo in tissues and organs of Ae. triseriatus.
The goals of this study were to investigate the prevalence of SI+ mosquitoes in sites in the LACV endemic
region, to determine the genetic relatedness of the SI+
virus isolates, and to characterize LACV genes potentially associated with perturbation of apoptotic/
autophagic and RNAi responses in SI+ mosquitoes.

Results
Detection of three LACV infection phenotypes in Ae.
triseriatus mosquitoes from field collected eggs

Mosquitoes were collected as eggs from field sites in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa (Figure 1), hatched and
reared to adults, and then assayed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), virus isolation, and reverse transcrip-

tion-PCR (RT-PCR). Based upon the results, mosquitoes
were assigned to three infection phenotypes: SI+ mosquitoes contained infectious virus and major accumulations
of viral antigen and nucleic acid, I+ mosquitoes contained
detectable amounts of viral antigen and nucleic acid but
no detectable virus in cell culture assays, and I- mosquitoes that contained no detectable viral antigen or nucleic
acid or virus.
IFA

The three infection phenotypes were detected in field
collections (Figure 2); the distribution and prevalence
rates of the SI+ and I+ mosquitoes in collections made
from the LACV endemic area in 2006 and 2007 are provided in Table 1. In total, 17,825 mosquitoes collected in
2006 and 2007 were assayed by IFA. Overall, 17 of 17,825
mosquitoes (prevalence rate: 0.0009) had the SI+ phenotype, 664 of 17,825 mosquitoes (prevalence rate: 0.037)
were I+, and 17,161 of 17,825 mosquitoes were I- (Table
1). In 2006, 2 of 6,761 mosquitoes (prevalence rate =
0.0003) were SI+ compared to 15 of 11,064 mosquitoes
(prevalence rate = 0.0014) in 2007.

Virus isolation and titer

IFA positive mosquitoes were assayed for infectious virus
in cell culture. LACV was isolated only from the SI+ mosquitoes (data not shown). The LACV titer of the abdomen of 11 SI+ mosquitoes from the 4 different collecting
sites ranged from 2.7 - 4.7 log10 TCID50/ml (average = 3.2
log10 TCID50/ml). This did not differ significantly from
the mean titer observed in the TOT-permissive laboratory colonized mosquitoes (3.9 log10TCID50/ml) (p >
0.05) [20].
In contrast to the SI+ mosquitoes, LACV was not isolated in Vero E6 or BHK-21 cells from any of 213 I+ mosquitoes assayed. To potentially increase virus isolation
sensitivity, supernatant fluid homogenates of 22 I+ mosquitoes were blind passaged [33] in BHK-21 and Vero E6
cell monolayers and some were assayed by intrathoracic
inoculation of Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes, but again no
isolates were obtained (data not shown).
RT-PCR

IFA positive mosquitoes were also processed by RT-PCR
to amplify viral RNA sequences for phylogenetic, gene

structure, and molecular evolution analyses. RNA was
readily amplified from all SI+ mosquitoes. Viral RNA was
also amplified from I+ mosquitoes, but the RT-PCR assay
and protocols needed further optimization, presumably
because of reduced amounts of viral RNA in some mosquitoes [34]. For later analyses, we developed a nested
RT-PCR system to more easily amplify sequences from I+
mosquitoes.

County (CAL-GA/Houston, MN/Mosquito/2007/Site 4
(Figure 1)) (Table 1). Prevalence rates of SI+ mosquitoes
differed between sites and years, ranging from 0.0009 at
one site in Vernon County, WI in 2006 to 0.015 at a site in
Lafayette County, WI in 2007. Notably the prevalence
rate for SI+ mosquitoes at one site in Crawford County,
WI was 0.018 in 2006 and 0.026 in 2007. This was the
only site to yield SI+ mosquitoes in both years of the
study.

Distribution of LACV SI+ and I+ mosquitoes in geographic
field collections of Ae. triseriatus

Prevalence of SI+ mosquitoes in selected "hot spots"

The prevalence of LACV-infected mosquitoes was determined in field collections from 2006 and 2007 (Table 1).
In 2006, SI+ mosquitoes were collected from Vernon
County (SVP/Vernon, WI/Mosquito/2006 Site 3 (Figure
1)) and Crawford County (NAT/Crawford, WI/Mosquito/2006 Site 2 (Figure 1)). In 2007, SI+ mosquitoes
were collected from Crawford County (NAT/Crawford,
WI/Mosquito/2007), Lafayette County (BEN2/Lafayette,
WI/Mosquito/2007 Site 1 (Figure 1)) and Houston

To further investigate the prevalence of SI+ mosquitoes,
eggs from multiple liners were hatched from "hot spots"
where >1 SI+ mosquito had been detected previously.
The SI+ and I+ prevalence rates were determined (Table
2). SI+ prevalence rates ranged from 0.012 to 0.121 in hot
spots. At the SVP/Vernon, WI/2006 site, 1 of 84 (prevalence rate = 0.012) was SI+ (Table 2). At the BEN2/Layfayette, WI/2007 site, 4 of 220 (0.018) were SI+. At the
CAL-GA/Houston, MN/2007 site, 7 of 58 mosquitoes

(see Methods and Materials).

(0.12) were SI+ (Table 2). Field collected mosquitoes from
the respective sites were tested throughout the summer
and interestingly, SI+ mosquitoes were only identified at
each collection site once a year (Table 2).
I+ mosquitoes were also more prevalent in hot spots.
The I+ prevalence rate for each site was compared to the
overall prevalence rate of 0.038 using a Fisher's exact test
to determine whether they differed significantly (Table 2).
The prevalence of I+ mosquitoes in NAT/Crawford, WI/
2007 and CAL-GA/Houston, MN/2007 differed significantly (p = 0.01) from the overall prevalence rate of I+
mosquitoes. The I+ prevalence rates observed in SVP/
Vernon, WI/2006 and BEN2/Layfayette, WI/2007 were
significantly greater (p = 0.05) than the overall I+ prevalence rate.
Phylogenetic analysis of virus isolates from SI+ mosquitoes

The three genome segments of plaque purified viruses
from selected SI+ mosquitoes were sequenced and

deposited in GenBank (Table 3). The sequences were
analyzed phylogenetically alongside previously published
LACV sequences (Table 3) using a maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis to test whether SI+ isolates represent 1) a
monophyletic group that is 2) phylogenetically distinct
previously published LACV sequences. One virus isolate
was analyzed from each of the four SI+ collection sites
(Figure 1). ML trees were created for the entire S, M and
L segments (Figures 3, 4, and 5, respectively) and for the
NSm gene (Figure 6).
The S segment ML tree (Figure 3) contained 3 well supported clades. One clade contained virus isolates from
Wisconsin and Minnesota with 89% support. Internal to
this, a clade with 87% support contained the MN Human
1960 and the WI Mosquito 1977 isolates. The third clade
with 100% support contained the NAT/Crawford, WI/
2006 and 2007 SI+ isolates. Note the long branch associated with NAT/Crawford clade demonstrating that these
SI+ isolates are genetically distinct. However, also note
that these two isolates collected from the same site in
consecutive years are very similar to one another. The
other three SI+ isolates are paraphyletic and therefore not
phylogenetically distinct from the previously published
LACV isolates. The S segment therefore suggests that SI+
isolates are not a monophyletic group. The trees in Figure
3 are not rooted and therefore do not suggest that SI+ lineages are basal.
The M segment ML tree (Figure 4) contains many well
supported clades. As with the S segment, M segments in
SI+ isolates do not form a monophyletic group and
instead arise four times independently on clades that
share a common ancestor with the previously published
LACV isolates. Further, unlike the S phylogeny, in no case
are SI+ isolate branch lengths long, suggesting sequence
similarity to the previously published isolates. Note again
that the NAT/Crawford isolates are very similar to one
another.
The L segment ML tree contained the same patterns
found in the M segment ML tree (Figure 5). One interesting additional observation is the phylogenetic placement
of the isolate Wisconsin/Mosquito/1977. In the S seg-

ment analysis, it is in a clade with all the LACV isolates
from Wisconsin and Minnesota, whereas in the L segment analysis the isolate is in a clade with the isolates
from NAT/Crawford, WI/2006 and/2007. This is likely
evidence for segment reassortment.
Phylogenetic analysis of the NSs and NSm genes from SI+
and I+ mosquitoes

The multiple functions of the NSs (S segment) and NSm
(M segment) proteins in the viral life cycle make these
proteins strong candidates for conditioning the I+ and
SI+ phenotypes. To examine this hypothesis, LACV NSs
and NSm genes from 8-12 mosquitoes of both phenotypes were sequenced and compared in an effort to correlate the SI+/I+ phenotypes with nucleotide and/or amino
acid differences. NSm genes were also sequenced from
SI+ and I+ mosquitoes collected from the same locations
in the same year. NSs and NSm nucleotide sequences
were deposited in GenBank (Table 3).

NSs sequences were determined for 10 I+ amplicons
and nine SI+ isolates collected in 2006 and 2007. No NSs
nucleotide differences were observed among the nineteen
isolates (Additional File - Figure 1). This analysis was
repeated with the NSm gene and the same phylogenetic
patterns as described for the S, M, and L segments were
noted (Figure 6). SI+ isolates are polyphyletic. Note that
despite the similarity of the M segments from NAT/
Crawford SI+ isolates (Figure 4), these isolates are very
genetically distinct from all other isolates.
Molecular evolution of LACV isolates and NSm sequences

The number of segregating sites (S), unique haplotypes
(Hap), and singletons Î·e for each gene in SI+ and previously published LACV isolates and between NSm
sequences from I+ and SI+ mosquitoes are listed in Table
4. Also listed are overall nucleotide diversity (Ï), Ïs
among synonymous sites and Ïa among replacement sites

in the 6 protein encoding genes. Theta from pair-wise
comparisons and F* are also listed.
Table 4 indicates five patterns. First, the numbers of
segregating sites are consistently larger in previously published isolates as compared to SI+ isolates (1.3, 2.2 and 1.6
fold higher in the S, M, and L segments, respectively).
The only exception was seen in the NSm gene where
there were 37 segregating sites among SI+ isolates as
compared with five sites in previously published isolates.
Similarly, the expected numbers of segregating sites (Î¸)

are consistently larger in previously published isolates
(1.3, 1.8 and 1.6 fold higher in the S, M, and L segments
respectively) but 8 fold higher in the NSm gene in SI+ as
compared with previously published isolates. Second, the
numbers of singletons were much larger in previously
published isolates (4.2, 12.4 and 3.6 fold higher in the S,
M, and L segments, respectively) as compared with the
SI+ isolates. This trend was especially pronounced in the
NSm gene in SI+ isolates. Despite having 37 segregating
sites, none of these were singletons in SI+ but four of the

five sites were singletons in previously published isolates.
Third, the three measures of nucleotide diversity (Ï) did
not differ greatly between previously published and SI+
isolates. Diversity was greatest in the M segment and
least in the S segment. The only exception was again seen
in the NSm gene where there was 9 fold greater Ï among
SI+ isolates as compared with I+ isolates. Fourth, the
ratio Ïa/Ïs was small in all comparisons indicating that
the majority of mutations are synonymous and the rate of
amino acid evolution is slow. Fifth, and most noteworthy,
F* was consistently positive among SI+ isolates and consistently negative among previously published isolates in

all three segments and in the NSm gene. However, this
difference was most pronounced (and significant) in the
M segment, particularly in the G2 and NSm genes. This
difference is most obvious when F* is plotted separately
for SI+ and previously published isolates across the entire
genome (Figure 7a) and between SI+ and I+ in the NSm
gene (Figure 7b).

ney's distance measure completely overlapped between
SI+ and previously published isolates indicating no general differential RSCU between the groups.

CUA codons appeared in SI+ mosquitoes but none
appeared in the I+ mosquitoes. The difference was significant using Fisher's exact test (P-value = 0.01437).

Nucleotide differences between LACV SI+ and previously
published isolates and between LACV NSm sequences from
I+ and SI+ mosquitoes

LACV NSm nucleotide and amino acid differences between
LACV SI+ and I+ mosquitoes from one site

The number of net nucleotide substitution differences/
site (Da = DI+/SI+ - ((DI+ + DSI+)/2)) [36]) between LACV
isolates from SI+ and previously published LACV
sequences were plotted for each site in the three segments (Figure 8a), and for the NSm gene from SI+ and I+
mosquitoes (Figure 8b) to test for large nucleotide differences. Figure 8a clearly indicates that the majority of differences arise on the M segment. Table 5 lists the
nucleotides at each site with a Da > 0.1. These appear as
nucleotides in non-coding regions or as codons in the
protein coding regions. The RSCU for the LACV isolates
are listed for each substitution. RSCU values that differed
by > 0.1 between the SI+ and previously published isolates are grey highlighted. The average RSCU for SI+ isolates and previously published isolates appear at the
bottom of the table. All of the substitutions with Da > 0.1
were synonymous. A pair-wise t-test of differences in
RSCU between SI+ and previously published isolates was
performed and was not significant.
In the overall analysis, a single large difference was
detected in NSm gene sequences from SI+ and I+ mosquitoes. The QTN identified in position 246 of the NSm
gene (Figure 8b) corresponds to a U to A transversion in
the third position of a CUN Leu codon. This codon shows
severe bias towards CUU (57 codons in 14 mosquitoes)
compared to a CUA (7 codons in 14 mosquitoes). All 7

Two SI+ and two I+ mosquitoes, respectively, were
detected at the NAT site (Figure 9). The SI+ and I+
sequences differed in numerous nts (Figure 9a). Four
LACV NSm amino acids differentiated the two SI+ mosquitoes (NAT/Crawford, WI, NAT/2007A and NAT/
2007B) from the two I+ mosquitoes (I+/NAT/Crawford,
WI/2008a) and I+/NAT/Crawford, WI/2008b) (Figure
9b). These four amino acid changes: D43E, L60F, I79T,
and A132T provide possible molecular correlates of I+ vs.
SI+ phenotype. In contrast, the LACV NSs sequences of
the four mosquitoes were absolutely conserved (Additional Files - Figure 1).

Discussion
The detection of SI+ in addition to I+ mosquitoes (Figure
2) was surprising. I+ mosquitoes were only detected
because we assayed individual mosquitoes by IFA and
PCR. They did not yield infectious virus and would not
be detected by cell culture bioassay [33]. I+ mosquitoes
are >10-fold more common in nature than SI+ mosquitoes, and thus could pose a significant risk to humans
(Table 1). When first detected, we thought I+ mosquitoes
might be a laboratory artifact resulting from less than
optimal collecting and processing conditions, which
could have reduced virus stability, infectivity, and titer,
resulting in the I+ phenotype. However, the finding was
replicated in multiple years. I+ mosquitoes may have low

Reese et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:76
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/76

titer infections in certain organs and tissues that could be
rescued by environmental and physiological stimuli. For
example, isolation of St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile
viruses from overwintering mosquitoes [37,38] is
enhanced when field collected Culex pipiens mosquitoes
are held at ambient insectary temperatures and provided
sugar meals before virus assay. However, I+ mosquitoes
were hatched and reared to adults in the insectary before
virus assay, which would have provided ample time and
metabolic and cellular activity for LACV to replicate to
detectable titer. Perhaps additional physiological stimuli
(e.g., mating, oogenesis, gonadotrophic cycles) would rescue infectious virus from I+ mosquitoes. The sensitivity
of virus isolation by cell culture bioassay may also be a
confounding factor. In early studies, virus was isolated by
inoculation of samples into suckling mice [5,7], which is
more sensitive than virus isolation in cell culture [33].
However, the equally sensitive method of intrathoracic
inoculation of Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes also failed to
yield infectious virus (data not shown). These observations suggest that I+ mosquitoes represent non-productive or abortive infections of the mosquito. The I+
mosquitoes must be controlling or clearing the infection.
If so, they could yield critical and fundamental information concerning the molecular, immunologic, and physiological bases of vector competence.
The SI+ mosquitoes are also of great interest. If they are
stably-infected, a relatively small number of these females
could maintain LACV in nature with a low general field
infection rate [18]. SI+ mosquitoes were detected in the
population at a low level (prevalence rate = 0.0009) (Table
1) but were widely distributed in the collection area (Figure 1). The prevalence of SI+ mosquitoes ranged from
0.0084 (NAT/Crawford County, WI/2007) to 0.12 (CALGA/Houston, MN/2007) (Table 2). The identification of
SI+ mosquitoes in the same NAT site in two different
years suggests that LACV is stabilized in mosquitoes in
this collection site. Stabilized infection of D. melanogaster with SIGMAV occurs when the germarium of
females become infected [16,17], resulting in virus TOT
to nearly 100% of progeny. A relatively low number of stably-infected females can maintain SIGMAV at a low prevalence indefinitely in nature [39,40]. Studies are needed
to determine if LACV infects the germarium of SI+ mosquitoes and is passed to all or most progeny in ensuing
generations.
This also raises the question of whether individual mosquito families or populations are responsible for the SI+
phenotype or whether some LACV quasispecies arise by
accident or at random in particular populations, and
cause SI+ infections in mosquitoes in geographic islands.
There is significant gene flow in Ae. triseriatus populations [41] including in our study area in the LaCrosse
region [42]. Nonetheless, it is possible that in geographic

Page 17 of 27

islands an innate immune arms race could emerge
between the virus and the vector resulting in stabilized
infection.
Our molecular evolutionary analyses strongly argue
that SI+ quasispecies evolve at random in particular
breeding sites or geographic islands. SI+ isolates are phylogenetically similar but are polyphyletic. Synonymous
substitution rates greatly exceeded replacement rates in
all genes and isolates. Overall, no general differences in
RSCU were detected between previously published and
SI+ isolates. However, the overall comparison of the
LACV NSm gene from I+ and SI+ mosquitoes did identify a single QTN (U A transversion) in a Leu (CUN)
codon in the NSm gene (Figure 8b). The significance of
this QTN remains to be determined.
A consistent and significant trend was detected by Fu
and Li's F* analysis of singleton versus shared mutations
(Figure 8a) and in direct comparison of I+ and SI+ mosquitoes (Figure 8b). S and L segments evolved in a manner consistent with purifying selection and subsequent
neutralism. But the SI+ M segment had a large and significant excess of intermediate-frequency alleles while the
M segment had a large, significant excess of singletons in
previously published LACV sequences and in sequences
from I+ mosquitoes. It is difficult to make any definite
conclusions from the previously published sequences,
which were collected over a period of 45 years and did
not arise from an intensive spatial or temporal field sample. Thus, the chances of finding intermediate frequency
Î·i alleles is small. Nevertheless, Figures 7a and 8a illustrate that most of the evolution of the past 45 years has
occurred in the M segment.
The patterns in direct comparison of NSm sequences
from I+ and SI+ mosquitoes in Figures 7b and 8b are consistent with an hypothesis that the error prone RNAdependent RNA polymerase generates a constellation of
genotypes and the majority of these generate I+ phenotypes in their mosquito host. The large accumulation of
singletons in I+ isolates in third codon positions reflect
the activity of error prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, filtered by purifying selection. In contrast, occasionally a SI+ genotype arises and, because they survive
and are maintained at a higher rate in stably-infected
mosquito lineages than I+ genotype, SI+ maintain an
excess of intermediate-frequency Î·i alleles. These intermediate-frequency alleles may confer reduced detection
and/or destruction via the RNAi or apoptotic/autophagic
pathways. Disruptive selection would then increase to
moderate frequencies those genotypes that avoided
destruction in the mosquito host and become manifested
as SI+ mosquitoes. A much larger proportion of novel
gene sequences in the M segment would yield viable virus
but which would only partially avoid detection and/or
destruction. Selection would not increase the frequencies

All codon substitutions are synonymous. The codon used and the associated RSCU are listed for each substitution. Grey highlighted values
differed by > 0.1 between the previously published and SI+ isolates. The average RSCU for previously published and SI+ isolates appears at
the bottom of the table. The probability value is from a pair-wise t-test of differences in RSCU between SI+ and previously published isolates.

of these genotypes and instead they would be manifested
as a large frequency of singleton Î·e alleles. This trend was
especially pronounced in the M segment in general and in
the NSm gene in SI+ isolates in particular. There was >9
fold nucleotide diversity in the NSm gene among SI+ isolates as compared with I+ isolates (Table 4). Despite having 37 segregating sites, none of these were singletons in
SI+ while four of only five sites were singletons in I+ individuals. This suggests that disruptive selection was
increasing the frequency of shared (Î·i) genotypes in SI+
mosquitoes while no such selection favored any of the I+
genotypes resulting in singletons (Î·e) in those mosquitoes. Overall, LACV NSm sequences in SI+ mosquitoes
differed between sites, suggesting that different polymorphisms in NSm may condition the SI+ phenotype. These
polymorphisms would be expected in a quasispecies
model of LACV infection in mosquitoes, and different
polymorphisms in NSm and Ae. triseriatus innate
immune genes could condition the same SI+ phenotype
in different sites or geographic islands in the endemic
area.
In one site (NAT), we were able to characterize NSs and
NSm gene sequences from SI+ and I+ mosquitoes (Figure
9). There were no differences in NT sequence in the NSs
genes (Additional File - Figure 1), but there were multiple
NT and four amino acid differences between LACV NSm
gene from SI+ and I+ mosquitoes in the site (Figure 9).
The role that these changes may have in conditioning the
establishment of the respective phenotypes remains to be
determined. Sequence analysis of the Ae. triseriatus
inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (AtIAP1) gene in mosquitoes
from our study area revealed extensive polymorphisms
(approximately 3 fold greater diversity than in a typical
mosquito gene). One would assume that this gene would
be highly conserved to prevent apoptosis [43].
In the D. melanogaster-SIGMAV system, the ref(2)P
gene, which determines stabilized virus infection of the
host, is also highly variable, presumably as a result of the
host counteracting genetic changes in the virus [44]. The
fly ref(2)P locus has two principal alleles, ref(2)PP and
ref(2)PO, respectively, which determine whether or not
the fly will restrict Sigma virus infection or be permissive
to stabilized infection [45]. There is a well characterized
innate immune arms race between the ref(2)p gene and
SIGMAV N protein epitopes [40], which determines productive infection of the host, TOT of the virus, and stabilized infection. The gene product of the ref(2)P locus is a
protein kinase in the Toll innate immune pathway [46].
Perhaps a similar major innate immune gene-for-gene
interaction conditions the LACV SI+ and I+ phenotypes
in Ae. triseriatus. The accumulating evidence suggests
that interactions between the LACV NSm and the
AtIAP1 gene may somehow condition the SI+ phenotype.

Page 20 of 27

In this regard, apoptosis and autophagy have been show
to share common caspase regulatory pathway components, autophagy and apoptosis both occur during degeneration of ovarian follicles, and autophagy has just been
recognized as a key antiviral response in D. melanogaster
[23-26]. All of this is especially provocative in the context
of the LACV-Ae. triseriatus system in which virus amplification and maintenance in nature is predicated upon
productive infection of ovarian follicles. Infection of Ae.
triseriatus ovarian follicles with West Nile virus, but not
LACV, induces an autophagosomic response in the follicles (BJB, unpublished data). Reverse genetics capability
is now available for LACV, and we can exploit this robust
approach to investigate and identify potential viral determinants of the SI+ and I+ phenotypes [47].
Mating efficiency studies with the newly discovered SI+
and I+ mosquitoes are also needed. Previous studies
demonstrated a fitness advantage with increased mating
efficiency for LACV-infected mosquitoes from the field,
but the mosquitoes were not phenotyped in terms of SI+
or I+ infection [48]. The mating advantage may be more
pronounced in SI+ mosquitoes. Mathematical models of
LACV and KEYV [13-15] need to consider such factors as
stabilized infection or mating advantages resulting from
such infection. These two factors may help maintain stable LACV prevalence from year to year in the vector population.

Conclusions
Processing of individual adult Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes
emerged from field collected eggs revealed the presence
SI+ and I+ mosquitoes in nature. SI+ mosquitoes could
represent stabilized infections. Such mosquitoes could be
present in low numbers, but could nonetheless maintain
the virus in an area. Understanding the molecular basis of
the SI+ phenotype would provide biomarkers for
improved risk assessment and for targeting control programs for LACV encephalitis and other arboviral diseases.
Methods
Egg collection

Aedes triseriatus eggs were collected by the La Crosse
County Public Health Department from five oviposition
traps in each of 119 sites in Minnesota (n = 30), Wisconsin (n = 83) and Iowa (n = 6) (Figure 1). Mosquito eggs
were collected between mid-June and October of 2006
and 2007 in Crawford (2006: 8 sites, 2007: 15 sites), La
Crosse (2006: 6 sites, 2007: 37 sites), Monroe (2006: 3
sites, 2007: 12 sites), Vernon (2006: 11 sites, 2007: 12
sites), Lafayette (2006 and 2007: 2 sites), and Iowa (2006:
2 sites, 2007: 4 sites) counties in Wisconsin, Winona
(2006: 7 sites, 2007: 13 sites) and Houston (2006: 10 sites,
2007: 17 sites) counties in Minnesota and Clayton county

Immunofluorescence assay

Approximately 2 - 4 days post-emergence, a mosquito leg
was removed, squashed onto an acid-washed microscope

slide, and fixed in cold acetone. Legs were then assayed
for LACV antigen by direct immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) [5]. Variation in the amount of LACV antigen was
evident among these mosquitoes. The degree of fluorescence was assigned quantitative scores to provide more
information about the nature of the infection in the
respective mosquitoes. An IFA score of 0 indicated no
detectable antigen; 1 - small amounts of antigen in some
tissues; 2 - small amounts of antigen in most tissues, 3 -

Virus isolation

SI+ and I+ mosquitoes, as identified by IFA, were triturated with a pellet pestle (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of
minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), 2% fetal bovine serum, 200 Î¼g/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 200 Î¼g/ml fungicide, 7.1 mM sodium bicarbonate,
and 1Ã nonessential amino acids. The homogenate was
centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 Ã g to form a pellet.
Monolayers of Vero E6 cells were grown in six-well
plates at 37Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Supernatant
from each centrifuged mosquito homogenate (200 Î¼l)
was added to one well of a six-well plate and incubated at
37Â°C for one hour. Following incubation, 5 ml of medium
were added to each well. The isolation of LACV was
revealed by the presence of cytopathic effects (CPE) five
days post-infection [33].
Titrations

The LACV titers of SI+ mosquitoes were determined by
endpoint titration in Vero E6 cells [33]. The mosquito
homogenates were serially diluted 10-1 - 10-6 and 200 Î¼l of
each dilution was added to one well of a 96 well plate. Five
days post-infection, the endpoint was determined as the
highest dilution causing CPE. The virus titer was calculated and expressed as log10 TCID50/ml [49].
Plaque purification

Monolayers of Vero E6 cells in six-well plates were used
for plaque purification of LACV isolates [33]. Virus isolates were serially diluted 10-1 to 10-6 and 200 Î¼l of each
virus dilution was added to one well and incubated at
37Â°C for 1 hour. The virus inoculum was then removed
and 5 ml of overlay (1% agar in Medium 199, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 7.1 mM sodium bicarbonate, 0.2% diethylaminoethyl-dextran in Hank's BSS, 1Ã Eagle basal
medium vitamins, 1Ã Eagle basal amino acids) were
added to the well. After six days of incubation at 37Â°C in
5% CO2, 200 Î¼l of the detection solution, methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/ml in PBS),
were added to each well. The plates were incubated overnight and wells were then examined for plaques. Isolated
plaques were individually picked and placed in 1 ml of
MEM with 0.2% FBS for 1 h at 37Â°C. The eluted virus was
added to a Vero cell monolayer in one well of a six-well
plate. The cells were then incubated for five to seven days
and the presence of virus was confirmed by CPE.
RNA purification from virus isolates and amplification by
reverse transcription PCR

Supernatant and cells from the wells containing plaque
purified virus were removed and placed in a 15 ml conical
tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The
supernatant was removed, the cell pellet was resuspended

Page 23 of 27

in 500 Î¼l of TRIzol, and total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The entire S, M, and L RNA segments were transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and amplified by
PCR using Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga,
Japan) according to manufacturer's instructions. The S
segment was amplified in two separate fragments, the M
segment in three fragments, and the L segment in four
fragments (Table 6). PCR was performed in a thermal
cycler with the following program: 94Â°C for 5 min, 37
cycles of [94Â°C for 1 min., 57Â°C for 1 min. and 72Â°C for 2.5
min] followed by a final extension at 72Â°C for 8 min.
Sequencing

PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1%
agarose gels with Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer,
stained with ethidium bromide, excised and extracted
using the Powerprep Express Gel Extraction kit (Marligen
Biosciences, Ijamsville, MD) according to manufacturer's
instructions. PCR products were sequenced using the
ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied
BioSystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI 310 DNA automated sequencer at Macromolecular Resources, CSU.
Amplification of NSs and NSm genes of LACVs from SI+ and
I+ mosquitoes

I+ and SI+ mosquitoes were triturated in 500 Î¼l TRIzol
LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and total RNA was
isolated from the homogenate per manufacturer's
instructions. NSs and NSm genes were transcribed and
PCR amplified in separate reactions using SuperScriptâ¢
III One-Step RT-PCR Kit with PlatinumÂ® Taq (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). External primers are listed in Table 6. The
thermal cycling conditions for the RT-PCR protocol
were: 55Â°C for 30 min, 94Â°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of [94Â°C
for 30 s, 56Â°C for 30 s, and 68Â°C for 1 min] followed by a
final extension at 68Â°C for 5 min. RT-PCR products were
further amplified by nested PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Internal
primers are listed in Table 6. The thermal cycling conditions were: 94Â°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of [94Â°C for 30 s,
56Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 75 s] followed by a final extension at 72Â°C for 5 min.
For virus isolates obtained from SI+ mosquitoes, 200 Î¼l
virus stock were added to 600 Î¼l TRIzol LS reagent and
viral RNA was isolated per manufacturer's instructions.
NSs and NSm were transcribed and PCR amplified in
separate reactions. Primers used in these reactions were
the same as those used for the nested PCR step of I+ and
SI+ samples. A nested PCR step was unnecessary and not
applied to SI+ isolates. PCR amplicons were purified with
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and sequenced bi-directionally as above. Sequences were

Phylogenetic analyses

LACV was isolated from five SI+ mosquitoes and RNA
was extracted from the isolates, amplified by RT-PCR,
and sequenced. The entire S, M and L segments were
sequenced and analyzed. Previously published LACV
sequences [50-54] were obtained from GenBank. The
viruses used in this analysis and their respective GenBank
Accession numbers are listed in Table 3.
Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees [55] were derived for
all three segments and for the NSm dataset using RAxML
(Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) [56,57].
RAxML performs sequential and parallel ML based inference of large phylogenetic trees. RAxML was initially
used to generate five fixed starting Maximum Parsimony
(MP) trees and these were then used as starting trees to
estimate ML trees using a fixed setting with GTRMIX
and then using the automatically determined setting on
the same five starting MP trees. We evaluated the final
trees under GTRGAMMA to compare the final likelihoods. The conditions that yielded the best likelihood
scores were used in further analyses. Next the optimal
number of parameters in the ML models was determined
by increasing the number of parameters by increments of
5 up to 55. Again GTRGAMMA was used to compare the
final likelihoods. GTRMIX located the Best-Known Likelihood (BKL) tree and GTRCAT performed bootstrapping with 100 pseudo-replications. This generated a
bipartitions Newick treefile with information on ML
topology, rates and bootstrap support. This bipartitions
Newick file was loaded into TreeGraph2 http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info/ to produce the final phylogeny
graphics.
Analyses of molecular evolution

DNAsp5.0 [58] was used to assign coding and noncoding
regions in the S, M and L segments and to subdivide each
sequence dataset into previously published versus SI+
groups. DNAsp5.0 then computed in each group the
number of segregating sites (S), unique haplotypes (Hap),
and singletons Î·e. Nucleotide diversity (Ï - Nei [36]), Ïs
among synonymous sites, Ïa among replacement sites, Î¸/
comp [36], and F* [59] were also computed with
DNAsp5.0.
F* is a normalized comparison of shared substitutions
(Î·i) relative to those appearing once, "singletons" (Î·e).
While no explicit examination of a genealogy is involved,
the F* test assumes that singletons arose recently and
appear on the tips of branches while shared mutations
(Î·i) are older and arose internally on nodes of the genealogy. When alleles are maintained at frequencies that
approximate the average mutation rate then F* = 0 and

Page 25 of 27

polymorphisms are assumed to evolve in a manner predicted by neutral evolution. Fu and Li [59] pointed out
that F* = 0 does not imply no selection because the neutral model implicitly assumes that the majority of novel
alleles are deleterious and removed through purifying
selection. In contrast, F* < 0 values reflect an excess of
singletons (Î·e) in a population and this pattern is consistent with positive selection wherein genetic variants
sweep throughout a population. Conversely, F* >0 values
indicate an excess of intermediate-frequency Î·i alleles and
can result from balancing selection or disruptive selection maintaining alleles at frequencies greater than the
average mutation rate. DNAsp5.0 was also used to compute confidence intervals of F* by simulations using the
coalescent algorithm and to compute differences in
nucleotide frequency (Da - Nei [36]) between previously
published and SI+ isolates across the LACV genome and
gene sequences using the Sliding Window method.
Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) was analyzed within and among previously published and SI+
isolates using the GCUA (General Codon Usage Analysis)
package [35]. The program was subsequently used to perform three analyses on the codon usage tables: 1) correspondence analysis (CA) [60]), 2) Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) and 3) a cluster analysis based upon
McInerney's distance measure [35], based on the differences in RSCU values.

Authors' contributions
SMR conducted mosquito rearing from field collected liners, mosquito IFA,
PCR, and virus isolation assays, and phylogenetic analyses. ECM conducted
LACV NSs and NSm amplifications from SI+ and I+ mosquitoes and analyzed
NT and AA variability in the respective phenotypes. MKB participated in mosquito rearing and IFA phenotyping of mosquitoes and in manuscript preparation and submission. ETB first detected SI+ mosquitoes and participated in
early studies to characterize the phenotypes. DG supervised all field crews for
identifying field sites, collecting of Ae. triseriatus eggs and processing and shipping of oviposition liners to Colorado. CDB and BJB were co-PIs of the NIH
grant that made these studies possible, established the overall studies and
experimental design, supervised laboratory and virologic investigations, analyzed data, and prepared the manuscript. WCB over saw and conducted
molecular evolution and phylogenetic analyses and prepared the manuscript.
All authors participated in the preparation of this manuscript and approve its
submission to Virology Journal.
