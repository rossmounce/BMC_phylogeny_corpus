Background
The recognition that HIV originated from nonhuman
primates (NHP) heightens concerns associated with
transmission of simian retroviruses to humans. Although
recent studies document frequent infection with simian
foamy virus (SFV) among primate hunters in Cameroon
and primate handlers in North America, little is known
about the spread and geographic distribution of SFV
outside these populations.
Materials and methods
We tested 3467 plasma samples collected in 2007 in a
population-based survey in 15 rural villages in central
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Participants completed a questionnaire about exposure to NHPs. Plasma
samples were screened for SFV antibodies using a new
Luminex-based EIA; reactive specimens were also tested
by a second EIA utilizing recombinant SFV Gag proteins. Specimens dually reactive in both EIAS were then
tested using a Western blot (WB) assay that can detect
monkey and ape-type SFV reactivity. PCR amplification
of DNA from buffy coats and phylogenetic analysis was
used to define the NHP species origin of SFV.
Results
54 (1.6%) plasma samples were dually EIA reactive and
25 (0.72%) were WB positive. Buffy coats were available
for PCR testing from 21 persons with WB positive or
indeterminate results. SFV polymerase and LTR
sequences were amplified from the DNA of three
women 23, 50, and 57 years old. Phylogenetic analysis

showed novel SFV infection in two women originating
from Angolan Colobus (Colobus angolensis) and in one
woman from a red-tailed guenon (C. ascanius), viral variants not previously seen in humans. Both monkeys are
native to DRC. Two of these women reported exposure
to NHPs via butchering and cooking, and specifically to
Angolan Colobus or red-tailed guenons. One woman
did not report exposure to NHPs. These women lived in
three separate villages, suggesting a wide and potentially
diverse distribution of SFV infections across DRC. The
younger woman reported a history of monkey pox-like
illness. All these women were married and had at least
three children but specimens were not available from
close contacts for testing. Animal exposure data were
available for 3034 persons; 2413 (79.3%) reported NHP
exposure.

Conclusions
Our study documents SFV infection in the DRC for the
first time and identifies human infection with new SFVs
from Colobus and red-tailed monkeys. Our findings suggest that SFV is prevalent across Africa in persons
exposed to NHPs inhabiting a specific region. Our
results highlight the importance of determining if SFVs
are transmitted from person-to-person and can cause
disease. SFV infection of humans exposed to NHPs also
highlights the increased potential for zoonotic transmission of other simian retroviruses with known pathogenic
consequences.
