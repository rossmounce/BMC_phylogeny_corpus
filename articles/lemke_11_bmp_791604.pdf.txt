transcriptomes of the hover fly Episyrphus
balteatus (Syrphidae)

Abstract
Background: In animals, signaling of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) is essential for dorsoventral (DV)
patterning of the embryo, but how BMP signaling evolved with changes in embryonic DV differentiation is largely
unclear. Based on the extensive knowledge of BMP signaling in Drosophila melanogaster, the morphological
diversity of extraembryonic tissues in different fly species provides a comparative system to address this question.
The closest relatives of D. melanogaster with clearly distinct DV differentiation are hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae).
The syrphid Episyrphus balteatus is a commercial bio-agent against aphids and has been established as a model
organism for developmental studies and chemical ecology. The dorsal blastoderm of E. balteatus gives rise to two
extraembryonic tissues (serosa and amnion), whereas in D. melanogaster, the dorsal blastoderm differentiates into a
single extraembryonic epithelium (amnioserosa). Recent studies indicate that several BMP signaling components of
D. melanogaster, including the BMP ligand Screw (Scw) and other extracellular regulators, evolved in the dipteran
lineage through gene duplication and functional divergence. These findings raise the question of whether the
complement of BMP signaling components changed with the origin of the amnioserosa.
Results: To search for BMP signaling components in E. balteatus, we generated and analyzed transcriptomes of
freshly laid eggs (0-30 minutes) and late blastoderm to early germband extension stages (3-6 hours) using Roche/
454 sequencing. We identified putative E. balteatus orthologues of 43% of all annotated D. melanogaster genes,
including the genes of all BMP ligands and other BMP signaling components.
Conclusion: The diversification of several BMP signaling components in the dipteran linage of D. melanogaster
preceded the origin of the amnioserosa.

Background
Across animals, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)
signaling pathway plays a major role in specifying the
dorsoventral (DV) axis [1,2]. However, the components
of the BMP pathway have been repeatedly modified
through lineage specific gene duplications and gene
losses [3,4]. Whether some of these genetic changes correlate with the origin of species-specific morphological
traits that develop under the control of the BMP pathway is unknown. Flies (Diptera) provide an excellent

opportunity to address this question firstly because the
BMP signaling pathway of Drosophila melanogaster has
been studied in great detail [5,6], and secondly because
tissue specification presumably under the control of
BMP signaling along the DV axis of dipterans has
undergone significant change [7]. In D. melanogaster,
dorsal blastoderm differentiates into a single extraembryonic epithelium, called amnioserosa, which closes the
developing embryo dorsally [8]. This tissue is found in
higher cyclorrhaphan flies (Schizophora), but in other
dipterans, dorsal blastoderm gives rise to distinct serosal
and amniotic epithelia [9-11]. Serosa and amnion
develop from an amnioserosal fold at the margins of the
gastrulating embryo. The outer cell layer of this fold

becomes the serosa, which closes about the embryo. Its
inner cell layer detaches from the serosa but retains
continuity with the embryo while closing dorsally (lower
cyclorrhaphan flies) or ventrally (non-cyclorrhaphan dipterans). The lower cyclorrhaphan syrphids represent the
closest relatives of D. melanogaster that have been
shown to develop distinct serosa and amnion tissues [9].
Therefore, they are of particular interest in efforts to
understand how the origin of the amnioserosa as a new
morphology is linked to changes in the underlying
developmental gene network.
In previous studies we have characterized the role that
the homeobox gene zerknüllt (zen) may have played in
the origin of amnioserosa development [reviewed in 7].
The transcription factor Zen is regulated by BMP signaling and essential in serosa specification in non-schizophoran insects and amnioserosa specification in D.
melanogaster [9,12-14]. In lower Cyclorrhapha and more
distant relatives of D. melanogaster, zen expression in
the serosa is maintained after gastrulation, i. e., when
the serosa begins to spread over the embryo [9],
whereas in D. melanogaster zen expression in the
amnioserosa is down-regulated immediately after gastrulation [13]. In lower cyclorrhaphan flies, postgastrular
down-regulation of zen abrogates serosa development
and results in the formation of a single extraembryonic
tissue with amniotic gene expression [15]. Thus, the
repression of this single transcription factor may
account for the morphological tissue reorganization that
accompanied the origin of the amnioserosa. However,
loss of postgastrular zen expression does not explain,
why in lower cyclorrhaphan and non-cyclorrhaphan dipterans the patterning of the dorsal blastoderm results in
the specification of two distinct extraembryonic tissues
types as opposed to one in schizophoran (i. e. higher
cyclorrhaphan) flies such as D. melanogaster.
In D. melanogaster, amnioserosa specification occurs
at the dorsal midline and requires peak-levels of BMP
activity [14,16], which are provided through the interaction of two extracellular ligands, Dpp and Scw [17-19].
Both ligands are secreted into the perivitelline space and
transported towards the dorsal midline [17,20-24],
where BMP-ligand dimers are released from antagonists
to activate a receptor complex and initiate intracellular
signaling [17,20,25-27]. A cell autonomous autoregulatory loop further increases the BMP signal at the dorsal
midline and generates a narrow and sharply delineated
domain of BMP peak activity [20,28]. Dpp is essential
for BMP activity and controls the specification of all tissues that develop under the control of this pathway in
the early embryo, including amnioserosa and dorsal
ectoderm [16,29]. Scw boosts BMP activity along the
dorsal midline and is in particular required for amnioserosa specification [19].

In other dipterans, the molecular mechanisms that
specify the amnion and serosa are not known. Expression studies in a mosquito suggest that a tighter expression of the Dpp antagonist short gastrulation (Sog) leads
to broader BMP signaling, which in turn may allow for
the specification of two versus one extraembryonic tissue type [11]. Additionally, Scw is absent from the genomes of mosquitoes and other insects, and it has been
suggested that its origin may correlate with the origin of
the amnioserosa [3]. Several other BMP signaling components of D. melanogaster resulted from gene duplications that have been mapped to the dipteran lineage,
while others - known from the BMP pathways of vertebrates - were lost in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster [4]. Here we use embryonic transcriptome data of
the hover fly Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae) to address
the question of whether evolutionary changes in the
complement of BMP signaling components occurred in
correlation with the origin of the amnioserosa. Specifically, we found that with the possible exception of one
gene-duplication (crossveinless/shrew) and one gene loss
(DAN), genes encoding known BMP signaling components, including scw, are conserved across the schizophoran boundary of the dipteran tree. Thus, most or all
of the gains and losses of BMP signaling genes in the
dipteran lineage do not correlate with the origin of the
amnioserosa, suggesting that the origin of amnioserosa
specification was probably achieved by rearranging the
interaction of established factors.

Results and Discussion
Putative Orthologues of 6013 E. balteatus Genes

We sequenced the transcriptome of E. balteatus embryos
at two successive time points during early embryogenesis:
0-0.5 hrs old embryos to sample pre-blastoderm stages
prior to the onset of zygotic transcription ("maternal
library”), and 3-6 hrs old embryos to sample blastoderm
and gastrulation stages after the onset of zygotic transcription ("zygotic library”). The cDNA libraries that we prepared from these developmental stages were normalized
(Additional file 1A,B) and sequenced using the 454 GS
FLX Titanium platform. Following removal of contaminants (see Material and Methods, Additional file 1C, D)
reads from both libraries were pooled and assembled
using the Newbler Assembler from Roche. Above our chosen cutoff of 100 nt, this assembly yielded a total of 16,950
contigs with an average length of 798 nt (13.5 MB) and
26,862 singletons with an average length of 264 nt (7.1
MB). This data set (20.6 MB total sequence data) was used
in subsequent analyses (Figure 1A).
To identify E. balteatus genes, we pooled sequence data
from both libraries and performed reciprocal BLAST
against annotated genes of D. melanogaster. Based on
reciprocal hits, we identified putative D. melanogaster

orthologues of 6013 E. balteatus genes. In total, about
8.1 MB (39%) of the assembled E. balteatus sequence
data could be annotated (red line in Figure 1A), corresponding to 43% of annotated D. melanogaster genes.
Specifically, we recovered 85% of genes annotated for
translational control, over 60% of the genes known to
encode gene-specific transcription factors (transcription
factor - strict [30]), 50% of the genes associated with
known and putative gene-specific transcription factors
(transcription factor - putative [30]), about 50% of genes
associated with structural functions (structure) and
enzymes, and 30-40% of genes associated with receptor
binding, molecular transporters, and signal transduction
(transducer) (Figure 1B).
Assessment of Coverage

To estimate the coverage of developmental genes, we
separately mapped the reads from each library back onto

all of 14 previously described E. balteatus segmentation
genes, which comprise orthologues of bicoid (Eba-bcd),
caudal (Eba-cad), nanos (Eba-nos), torso (Eba-tor), orthodenticle (Eba-otd), hunchback (Eba-hb), Krüppel (EbaKr), knirps (Eba-kni), giant (Eba-gt), hairy (Eba-h), evenskipped (Eba-eve), zerknüllt (Eba-zen), tailless (Eba-tll),
and huckebein (Eba-hkb) [9,31-33]. The combined maternal and zygotic coverage of all fourteen genes was on
average 8.6-fold (Additional file 2), slightly less than the
average coverage of the entire assembled transcriptome
(~12-fold). However, coverage of 5’UTR sequences (2.0fold) and 3’UTR sequences (1.6-fold) was considerably
lower than the coverage of ORF sequences (12.5-fold). As
the CG content of UTRs (20%) was notably lower than
the CG content of the ORFs (43%), a systematic bias
against AT rich sequences may have been introduced by
less efficient annealing of the random hexamer primers
during first strand cDNA synthesis. In any case, coverage

Lemke et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:278
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/278

of our E. balteatus transcriptome data set was high
enough to identify at least fragments of genes known to
be active during early embryonic development.
All fourteen genes were represented with at least one
read from the zygotic library (blue lines in Figure 2A-N),
which is consistent with our previous finding that all these
genes are expressed in the 3-6 hours time window of
embryonic development [9,31-33]. For six of these genes
(Eba-bcd, Eba-cad, Eba-nos, Eba-tor, Eba-otd, Eba-hb) we
also obtained reads from the maternal library (red lines in
Figure 2A-F). Previous and new (Additional file 3A-C) in
situ hybridization data indicated maternal expression of
Eba-bcd, Eba-cad, Eba-nos, Eba-tor and Eba-otd, but not
of Eba-hb. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) on non-normalized
cDNA suggested an 18-fold increase of Eba-hb expression
levels following the onset of zygotic transcription, whereas
expression levels both of Eba-otd and Eba-cad increased
by about 2-fold (orange bars in Additional file 3D). Coverage of these genes in the maternal and zygotic transcriptomes closely reflected our qPCR data (light grey bars in
Additional file 3D), suggesting that, despite cDNA normalization, the coverage of these genes remained roughly proportional to their expression levels.
BMP Signaling Components in the E. balteatus
Transcriptome Database

In D. melanogaster, BMP signaling at the dorsal side of
the blastoderm is required to specify the amnioserosa
as a single extraembryonic tissue (see Background).
Based on mosquito data, it has been suggested that in
lower dipterans restricted expression of the BMP
antagonist Short gastrulation (Sog) may account for an
expanded BMP signaling domain in the dorsal blastoderm, which resolves into serosa and amnion territories [11]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the
complement of BMP signaling components changed in
the dipteran lineage in parallel with the origin of the
amnioserosa [3]. We used our transcriptome database
as a tool to test the latter idea by searching for
E. balteatus homologues of specific BMP signaling
components of D. melanogaster.
Specific BMP signaling components include (1) extracellular ligands, (2) transmembrane receptors, (3) intracellular signal transducers, and (4) extracellular
modulators of ligands. The D. melanogaster genome
contains a total of three genes encoding BMP ligands:
decapentaplegic (dpp) [18], glass bottom boat (gbb) [34],
and screw (scw) [19]. These are selectively used depending on the developmental context [5]. In other insects,
only homologues of dpp and gbb have been found [3,4].
We identified E. balteatus homologues of all three
ligands (Figure 3A), indicating that these genes existed
prior to the origin of the amnioserosa. Consistent with
previous reports [3,4], our gene tree supports a sister

gene relationship between scw and gbb. As expected
based on a comprehensive survey of TGF-b signaling
components in the beetle Tribolium castaneum [4], we
also identified E. balteatus homologues for each of the
D. melanogaster TGF-b receptors Thickveins (Tkv) and
Saxophone (Sax) [35-38], Punt (Put) [39,40], Baboon
(Babo) [41], and Wishful thinking (Wit) [42,43], and the
SMAD transducers Mothers against Dpp (Mad), Medea,
and Smox [44-48], as well as other TGF-ß signaling
components (Figure 3B,C; Additional file 4).
In D. melanogaster, activity of BMP ligands is modulated
by Sog [22,23,26], which in turn is regulated by the related
metalloproteases Tolloid (Tld) and Tolkin (Tok)
[25,49,50]. We identified E. balteatus homologues of sog as
well as of tld. While we were not able to identify an orthologue of tok, the presence of a distinct tld orthologue in
E. balteatus suggests that the dipteran gene duplication
giving rise to tld and tok occurred before the origin of the
amnioserosa (Figure 3D). BMP ligand activity in D. melanogaster is additionally modulated by Twisted gastrulation
(Tsg) [51,52], Crossveinless (Cv) [53,54], Shrew (Srw)
[26,55], as well as the membrane associated factors Crossveinless-2 (Cv-2) [56,57], Kekkon 5 (Kek5) [58], Pentagone
(Pent) [59] and Larval Translucida (Ltl) [60]. We identified
E. balteatus homologues of cv-2, kek5 (Figure 3E) as well
as tsg, cv and an additional cv paralogue, Eba-cv-like
(Figure 3F). Previous studies have suggested that tsg, cv,
and srw originated by two successive duplications of a
cv-like ancestor in the dipteran lineage [3]. Our gene tree
analysis is consistent with this idea, but does not resolve
whether Eba-cv-like is orthologous to srw, or whether it
is the product of an independent gene duplication in
E. balteatus. We did not identify orthologues of pent and
ltl in E. balteatus, but putative orthologues of both genes
are present in the genome of T. castaneum (data not
shown). Thus, all currently known modulators of BMP
ligand activity in D. melanogaster may have existed prior
to the origin of the amnioserosa.
Putative orthologues of the vertebrate BMP ligands
BMP10 [61] and Anti-Dorsalizing Morphogenetic Protein (ADMP) [62-64], as well as the vertebrate BMP
inhibitors BAMBI [65], DAN and Gremlin [66] have
been found in beetles and/or wasps but not in D. melanogaster [4]. Among these, we were able to identify a
putative orthologue of DAN in E. balteatus (Figure 3G).
The loss of this gene may correlate with the origin of
the amnioserosa. However, the function of DAN in
insects remains unknown and its potential role in BMP
signaling is therefore speculative.
Differences in maternal expression of BMP signaling
components in D. melanogaster and E. balteatus

roughly proportional to their expected expression levels
(see above; Additional file 3D), we decided to globally
compare maternal gene expression between E. balteatus
and D. melanogaster. For this purpose, we approximated
the maternal expression profiles of all annotated E. balteatus genes based on their coverage in the maternal
transcriptome and compared them to maternal expression profiles of their D. melanogaster orthologues.
Maternal coverage levels of all annotated E. balteatus
genes were corrected for sequence lengths and sequencing depth (see Methods) and plotted against coverage
levels of their D. melanogaster orthologues, which were
estimated from available SOLiD total RNA sequencing
data of 0-2 hour old embryos (i.e. stages when the zygotic
transcriptome is still essentially silent) [67] (Figure 4).
Coverage levels derived from the non-normalized D. melanogaster transcriptome spread by 5.5 orders of magnitude, while those of the normalized E. balteatus
transcriptome spread by 3.6 orders of magnitude. A
reduced breadth in coverage levels of E. balteatus genes
was expected due to the normalization protocol. The
coverage levels of the maternal genes nanos, bicoid, torso,
and caudal were higher than 1 in the transcriptome of
D. melanogaster and E. balteatus. In contrast, the zygotic
genes huckebein, even skipped, giant, hairy, knirps, tailless, Krüppel, and zerknüllt showed coverage levels lower
than 1 in both species (Figure 4A). Notably, the scatter
plot correctly revealed the expression differences of
hunchback (maternally expressed in D. melanogaster but
not in E. balteatus) and orthodenticle (maternally
expressed in E. balteatus but not in D. melanogaster).
When restricting the data set to BMP components
(Figure 4B) or transcription factors (Figure 4C), we readily identified additional candidate maternal expression
differences in both gene groups. For example, the data
suggest maternal expression of crossveinless-2 or kekkon5 in E. balteatus but not in D. melanogaster, which might
reflect different interactions of BMP signaling molecules
and regulators in both species during early embryonic
development.

Conclusions
Comprising orthologous sequences of nearly half (43%)
of all annotated D. melanogaster genes, the newly generated transcriptome data of E. balteatus provide a convenient tool to identify putative orthologues of conserved
insect genes. Here we used the transcriptome data of E.
balteatus to show that the novel dipteran BMP ligand
Scw and other BMP signaling components of D. melanogaster existed prior to the origin of the amnioserosa
(Figure 5). These findings suggest that the origin of
amnioserosa development was accompanied by subtle
changes in the expression of conserved BMP signaling

Page 7 of 13

components, rather than on the origin or loss of individual genes. Modification of the BMP pathway is
expected to be constrained due to its multiple functions
in development. However, the duplicated genes (gbb and
scw; tld and tok; cv, tsg and srw) may have relaxed these
constraints, because BMP activity could now be provided by non-identical sets of genes in early (blastoderm) and later developmental stages. We suspect that
increasing the role of scw, tld, tsg and srw in early (blastoderm) development at the expense of gbb, tok and cv
facilitated genetic accommodation of early DV patterning following the origin of the amnioserosa. Conversely,
the entire complement of the duplicated BMP signaling
genes might still be required for early DV patterning in
lower cyclorrhaphan flies such as E. balteatus.

Methods
Preparation of Transcriptome Library

Total RNA was prepared by homogenizing embryos in
Trizol (Inivtrogen), treated with DNaseI, and enriched
for polyA containing transcripts using the Oligotex kit
(Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from
approximately 1 μg of mRNA. Annealing of random
hexamer primers (15 mM) was at 25°C for 10 minutes,
cDNA was synthesized at 50°C for 1 hour and followed
by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase (Superscript,
Invitrogen) at 85°C for 5 minutes. Second-strand cDNA
was synthesized using the first strand reaction with Klenow DNA Polymerase at 15°C for 1.5 hours, and terminated by the addition of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8. cDNA was
purified using the QIAquick MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). cDNA ends were filled in ("polished”)
using a mix of Klenow DNA polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase with dNTPs at 20°C for 30 minutes, after
which the reactions were purified again using the QIAquick MinElute Reaction Clean-up Kit. “A” overhangs
were created by incubating polished cDNA with 0.2 mM
dATP 0.3 U/μl Klenow exo- at 37°C for 30 minutes.
cDNA was purified using the QIAquick MinElute Reaction Clean-up Kit (Qiagen), ligated with a mix of AdaptorA and AdaptorB using T4 DNA ligase, and purified
again. Adaptors were generated by annealing equimolar
amounts of complementary oligos in 2x TNE buffer
(20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8, 100 mM
NaCl). Oligo sequences for both adaptors were adapted
from 454 Sequencing Technical Bulletin No. 004-2009,
ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies and HPLC
purified. Amplification of the library was performed in
triplicate using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase HiFi
with AdapterA and AdapterB primers. AdapterA FW
and AdapterB FW primers. Pooled volumes of the
library were purified using the QIAquick MinElute
Reaction Clean-up Kit.

Figure 4 Coverage of maternal E. balteatus genes in comparison with transcriptome data from 0-2 hours old D. melanogaster embryos.
(A) Scatter plot of orthologous genes for which we determined expression levels in E. balteatus (using 454 data from 0-0.5 hrs old embryos) and D.
melanogaster (using RNAseq data from 0-2 hrs old embryos) on a log2 scale. The 14 previously identified E. balteatus genes are circled in red (if
their D. melanogaster orthologues are known to have a maternal effect) or in blue (if their D. melanogaster orthologues are thought to lack a
maternal effect). Asterisks demark genes that have been manually annotated. Genes not detected at the indicated developmental stage in one of
the two species are plotted outside the scale (grey area). (B,C) Same as in (A) but limited to 15 identified genes encoding BMP signaling
components (B) or 89 genes of gene specific transcription factors (C, list of genes based on flyTF, see Material and Methods). Genes that might lack
significant maternal expression in one of the two species are indicated. Our analysis suggests that the zygotic D. melanogaster genes crossveinless2, kekkon-5, doublesex, abdominal-A, vrille and Optix are expressed maternally in E. balteatus, while the maternal D. melanogaster transcription factor
BEAF-32 may lack significant maternal expression in E. balteatus.

Library Normalization and Fragment Size Selection

Libraries were normalized using the TRIMMER
DIRECT cDNA Normalization Kit (Evrogen) and were
carried out essentially as described in the user manual.
Briefly, 400 ng of each library were suspended in hybridization buffer and split into four tubes. Following 5 hr
incubation at 68°C, the aliquots were treated either with
4 units, 2 units, 1 unit, or no duplex-specific nuclease
(DSN). After DSN digestion, the normalized cDNA
libraries were amplified by PCR. Optimal amplification
within the exponential phase of the PCR was determined visually after electrophoresing different amplification runs of the non-DSN treated sample, after which
all aliquots were amplified by a total of 20 cycles. The
normalization efficiency was assessed by quantitative
PCR (qPCR) of hunchback (Eba-hb, 5’-CTCAGCCCGAATCCAAAT/5’-GGTTGTGGGAGTTGATGTTG,
amplicon 137 bp), caudal (Eba-cad, 5’-GAAAGAAT
ACTGCACCTCCC/5’-GTCGTTCCGATAGTTGAAGC,
amplicon 79 bp), and alpha-tubulin as reference (Ebatub, 5’-TGAGGCTCGTGAGGATTT/5’-TCACCATCT
CCAGAATCCA, amplicon 71 bp). Primer efficiency was
estimated from a standard curve using five different
template concentrations (12.5-200 ng); all analyses were
run simultaneously in triplicates. For both libraries, the
normalization with 4 units DSN were chosen for
sequencing. Based on optimal cycle numbers for amplification and degree of normalization, these libraries were
size fractionated using agarose gel electrophoresis, excising fragments at roughly 500 bp, and then purifying
them using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen)
prior to sequencing.
454 Sequencing

Transcriptome library sequencing was performed on the
Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform at the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology’s (IGSB) HighThroughput Genome Analysis Core (HGAC) at
Argonne National Laboratory according to the Roche

Page 9 of 13

GS-FLX XLR70 Titanium emPCR and amplicon sequencing protocols. Each transcriptome library was
sequenced on one region of a two region GS-FLX gasket
using Roche GS-FLX XLR70 titanium sequencing
reagents. An emPCR titration was initially performed on
each library to determine the proper bead:library copy
ratio that yielded optimal clonal bead percent enrichment to be used in the final bulk XLR70 emPCR
reaction.
Sequence Assembly

Sequencing raw data was processed with gsRunProcessor (software release 2.0.00.20) using standard quality filtering and trimming as defined by the default settings.
We obtained 417,735 reads with a mean length of 243
nt for the maternal time point and 406,580 reads with a
mean length of 278 nt for the zygotic time point, totaling 214.6 MB of sequence data. This raw data set was
contaminated with sequences of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, because E. balteatus requires aphids for
egg deposition, and embryos were collected in batch
from leaves heavily infested with aphids. For subsequent
analyses, we removed all reads that matched published
A. pisum sequences (mRNA + genomic, NCBI, 2009-0713) [68] with 95% or higher identity. Removal of A.
pisum sequences reduced the total sequence data by
about 26% to 158.1 MB and the number of reads from
each library by about 22%, resulting in 325,200 reads
from the maternal library with a mean read length of
228 nt, and 311,906 reads from the zygotic library with
a mean read length of 269 nt. The distribution of read
lengths displayed two peaks, one at about 400 nt (360
nt for reads from the zygotic library) and one at less
than 100 nt (Additional file 1C,D). The peak at 400 nt
corresponded to the expected mean length using the
Titanium chemistry. The peak slightly below 100 nt presumably resulted from our cDNA preparation protocol,
which had not yet been optimized for the Titanium
chemistry at the time of library preparation and lacked,
for example, any additional size exclusion steps following gel electrophoreses.
All reads have been deposited as the E. balteatus transcriptome at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA,
SRP005289). Assembly was based on combined SFF
sequence files of the maternal and zygotic libraries using
Newbler Assembler (software release 2.3). Newbler parameters were default except: minimal identity of 90% in
overlaps (-mi 90), overlaps to be at least 30 nt in length
(-ml 30), minimal length of contigs to be 100 nt (-l
100). Newbler was run as cDNA assembly (-cdna),
which includes processing of contigs that are found to
be variants of the same transcript into distinct isotigs.
From a total of 637,080 reads, 544,776 reads (85.5%)
were assembled (fully assembled reads: 432,160 reads,

Lemke et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:278
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/278

67.8%; partially assembled reads: 112,616 reads, 17.7%).
The remaining reads were singletons (56,625 reads;
8.9%) or excluded as either originating from repeat
regions (221 reads; 0.03%), outliers (23,060 reads; 3.6%),
or too short (< 50 base pairs: 12,398 reads; 1.9%) (see
Additional file 4 for comparison with Newbler 2.5.3).
Sequence Annotation

Reported isotigs (12,296; 12.9 MB) and singletons of at
least 100 nt length (26,862; 7.1 MB; identified from
454ReadStatus.txt) were combined, and reciprocal
BLAST searches of the E. balteatus transcriptome were
carried out against the translated transcriptome of D.
melanogaster (dmel-all-translation-r5.29.faa, flybase.org)
using blastx (E. balteatus query against D. melanogaster
database) and tblastn (D. melanogaster query against E.
balteatus database). Annotation was performed with an
e-value threshold of 10 to screen for all putative orthologues ("no cutoff”) and with an e-value threshold of 1e10 to obtain a conservative list of high confidence
orthologues ("1e-10”) (see Additional file 5 for comparison of annotation based on assemblies with Newbler 2.3
and Newbler 2.5.3). Reciprocal hits of E. balteatus with
D. melanogaster were assigned with the same flybase D.
melanogaster CG identifiers. Gene ontology terms were
assigned based on the current D. melanogaster gene
ontology, with the exception of ‘transcription factor strict’ and ‘transcription factor - putative’, which were
based on a curated list of genes of known and putative
gene specific transcription factors [30].
Sequence Coverage

To determine coverage levels for individual published E.
balteatus genes, associated reads of the maternal and
zygotic library sequences were identified by BLAST
search (blastn) and assembled with the published
sequence using CAP3 with standard parameters [69].
Coverage levels were then calculated for each nucleotide
position of the published gene sequences. Fold-coverage
in the maternal library was used to approximate maternal expression levels of all annotated E. balteatus genes.
The assembled E. balteatus transcriptome (isotigs and
singletons) was blasted against all maternal reads
(blastn). Coverage of annotated transcripts was then calculated from all reads that matched with at least 95%
identity and over the length of at least 50 nt. To approximate levels of gene expression, coverage of each gene
was divided by its sequence length and the total RNAseq data of the maternal library (74 MB). Fold-coverage
in the 0-2 hr time point of the D. melanogaster development transcriptome was used to approximate maternal
expression levels of D. melanogaster genes [67]. Expression data of D. melanogaster genes in 0-2 hrs old
embryos was downloaded from modEncode as coverage

Page 10 of 13

data mapped onto the entire genome (BC1_plus.wig,
BC1_minus.wig). Expression of gene transcripts was
retrieved from this genomic map by extracting coverage
information of all exons for each annotated gene (BDGP/
dm3). To account for potentially mis-annotated exonintron structures of computationally predicted genes,
gene expression was approximated by the coverage of the
most strongly expressed exon longer than 500 nt, or by
the coverage of the most strongly expressed transcript
variant, whichever was higher. To approximate levels of
gene expression, coverage of each gene was divided by its
sequence length and the total RNAseq data of the 0-2 hr
time point (3.4 GB, SRP001696).
Gene Discovery of BMP Signaling Components

A list of D. melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum BMP
signaling compounds was matched against assembled
and unassembled E. balteatus transcriptome data
(tblastn, e-value of 0.001). Identified E. balteatus
sequences were assembled in Sequencher, assemblies
were manually corrected for ORF frame shifts by alignment with D. melanogaster protein sequence, and
sequence orthology was confirmed by reciprocal blast
against a D. melanogaster database. To exhaustively
search for putative duplicates specific to the E. balteatus
lineage, blast searches were repeated using lower cut-offs
(increasingly higher e-values) until all newly identified
and assembled E. balteatus reads matched a clearly nonorthologous sequence in available insect protein databases. All T. castaneum sequences were retrieved from
BeetleBase (ftp://bioinformatics.ksu.edu/pub/BeetleBase/
latest/Sequences/Tribolium_Official_Gene_Sequences/
mRNA.fa).
Phylogenetic Gene Trees

Protein alignments were created using the Clustal algorithm with standard parameters (MegAlign). When more
than half of the aligned sequences carried a gap at a given
position, these positions were removed from the alignment. The amino acid substitution model was estimated
using AIC in ProtTest [70]; maximum likelihood trees
were calculated using PhyML [71]. Bootstrap values were
based on 1000 replicas. Trees were plotted with drawtree
(Phylip package) [72] and the newick-utils package [73].
Custom scripts (Perl, R) were used to automate blast
searches and evaluation, calculate E. balteatus and
D. melanogaster gene coverage, and prune sequence
alignments. Scripts are available on request. Plots were
prepared with gnuplot and finished with Freehand.
Assembly, blast searches, and bootstrap analysis were
computed on the computer cluster of the Department
of Ecology & Evolution at the
University of Chicago (http://biocomputing.uchicago.
edu).

Additional file 4: Schematic overview of TGF-b signaling in D.
melanogaster. TGF-b ligands bind as dimers to a transmembrane
receptor complex, which activates signal transducing protein that
translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene activity (modified after [74]).
Components of the BMP signaling cascade are shown in red,
components of the Activin-b signaling cascade in blue, shared
components in purple. In the case of generalized BMP signaling,
extraecellular ligands (Dpp, Scw, Gbb) are regulated by BMP antagonists
Sog and Tsg/Cv/Srw(?), and metalloprotease activity of Tld/Tok, which
cleaves Sog and frees BMP. Additional BMP specific regulators are
transmembrane protein CV-2, which directly binds BMPs, and membrane
associated protein Kek5. Active BMPs signal through the receptor
complex composed of Tkv, Sax and Put, which phophorylates Mad.
Phophorylated Mad recruits Medea and translocates to the nucleus. For
abbreviations, see legend to Figure 3.
Additional file 5: Comparison of sequence annotation following de
novo transcriptome assemblies produced by Newbler v2.3 and
Newbler v2.5.3. During manuscript preparation, a new version of
Newbler became available (v2.5). To address the concern of a potential
underperformance of Newbler v2.3 in the case of our data set, we
repeated the assembly and annotation with the latest available Newbler
assembler (v2.5.3) and compared the results to the assembly with
Newbler v2.3. We found the total number of assembled bases with
Newbler v2.5.3 (10.5 Mb) decreased by almost 20% when compared with
the number of assembled bases with Newbler v2.3 (12.9 Mb), suggesting
that for our dataset Newbler v2.5.3 performed with more stringent
assembly conditions. The observed differences did not affect our
identification of BMP signaling components in E. balteatus as these
genes were all identified by Blast and subsequent manual assembly.
