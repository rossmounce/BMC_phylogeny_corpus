Abstract
Background: Centromeres represent the last frontiers of plant and animal genomics.
Although they perform a conserved function in chromosome segregation, centromeres are
typically composed of repetitive satellite sequences that are rapidly evolving. The
nucleosomes of centromeres are characterized by a special H3-like histone (CenH3), which
evolves rapidly and adaptively in Drosophila and Arabidopsis. Most plant, animal and fungal
centromeres also bind a large protein, centromere protein C (CENP-C), that is characterized
by a single 24 amino-acid motif (CENPC motif).
Results: Whereas we find no evidence that mammalian CenH3 (CENP-A) has been evolving
adaptively, mammalian CENP-C proteins contain adaptively evolving regions that overlap with
regions of DNA-binding activity. In plants we find that CENP-C proteins have complex
duplicated regions, with conserved amino and carboxyl termini that are dissimilar in sequence
to their counterparts in animals and fungi. Comparisons of Cenpc genes from Arabidopsis
species and from grasses revealed multiple regions that are under positive selection, including
duplicated exons in some grasses. In contrast to plants and animals, yeast CENP-C (Mif2p) is
under negative selection.
Conclusions: CENP-Cs in all plant and animal lineages examined have regions that are rapidly
and adaptively evolving. To explain these remarkable evolutionary features for a single-copy
gene that is needed at every mitosis, we propose that CENP-Cs, like some CenH3s, suppress
meiotic drive of centromeres during female meiosis. This process can account for the rapid
evolution and the complexity of centromeric DNA in plants and animals as compared to fungi.

Background
Centromeres are the chromosomal loci where kinetochores
assemble to serve as attachment sites for the spindle microtubules that direct chromosome segregation during mitosis

and meiosis. Despite this essential conserved function in all
eukaryotes, centromere structure is highly variable, ranging
from the simple short centromeres of budding yeast, which
have a consensus sequence of approximately 125 base

pairs (bp) on each chromosome, to holokinetic centromeres that span the entire length of a chromosome [1].
In plants and animals, centromeres are large and complex,
typically comprising megabase-sized arrays of tandemly
repeated satellite sequences that are rapidly evolving [2] and
may differ significantly between closely related species [3-5].
The failure of conventional cloning and sequencing assembly tools to adequately characterize rapidly evolving satellite
sequences at centromeres has made them the last regions of
most eukaryotic genomes to be well understood [1].
Although there is no discernable conservation of centromeric
DNA sequences in disparate eukaryotes, considerable
progress has been made in identifying common proteins that
form the kinetochore [6]. A universal protein component of
centromeric chromatin found in all eukaryotes that have
been examined is a centromere-specific variant of histone H3
(CenH3), which replaces canonical H3 in centromeric
nucleosomes [7,8]. CenH3s are essential kinetochore components yet, like centromeric DNA, they are rapidly evolving
[1]. In both Drosophila [9] and Arabidopsis [10], this rapid
evolution of CenH3s is associated with positive selection
(adaptive evolution), and involves regions of CenH3 that are
predicted to contact the centromeric DNA [9,11,12].
The finding of positive selection in a protein that is required
at every cell division is remarkable. Ancient proteins with
conserved function are expected to be under negative selection because they typically have achieved an optimal
sequence, so new mutations tend to produce deleterious
variants that are quickly eliminated from populations. The
canonical histones are extreme examples of this type of
protein. In contrast, recurrent positive selection generally
occurs as a consequence of genetic conflict, for example in
the ‘arms race’ between pathogen surface antigens and the
immune-cell proteins that recognize them. In this case, a
mutation in a surface antigen that allows the pathogen to
escape detection and proliferate will trigger selection for a
new immune receptor to fight the mutated pathogen, which
can then mutate again, and so on. The evidence for positive
selection of CenH3 proteins specifically in the regions that
contact DNA thus suggests a conflict between centromeric
DNA and a histone component of the nucleosome that
packages it. Is it commonplace for eukaryotes to have such
a conflict at their centromeres? Is the conflict unique to
centromere-specific histones, or are other proteins that bind
centromeres also involved in this conflict? Is conflict
responsible for centromere complexity? To answer these
questions, we investigated the evolution of a second
common DNA-binding kinetochore protein.
Of the handful of essential kinetochore proteins that are
widely distributed among eukaryotes, only one class other

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

than CenH3 has been shown to bind centromeric DNA:
centromere protein C (CENP-C), a conserved component of
the inner kinetochore in vertebrates [13-16]. Human CENP-C
binds DNA non-specifically in vitro [17-19] and binds centromeric alpha satellite DNA in vivo [20,21]. Vertebrate
CENP-C and the yeast centromere protein Mif2p [22,23]
share a 24 amino-acid motif (CENPC motif) that has also
been found in kinetochore proteins in nematodes [24] and
plants [25]. As expected for kinetochore proteins, disruption
or inactivation of genes encoding proteins containing a
CENPC motif (CENP-Cs) results in the failure of proper
chromosome segregation [16,23,24,26-28].
Other than the defining CENPC motif, these proteins are
dissimilar in sequence across disparate phyla. Such a small
stretch of sequence conservation, accounting for less than
5% of the length of these 549-943 amino-acid proteins, is
unexpected considering that CENP-Cs are encoded by essential single-copy genes that are expected to be subject to
strong negative selection. We therefore wondered whether
the same evolutionary forces responsible for the rapid evolution of CenH3s cause divergence of CENP-Cs outside of
the CENPC motif.
Here, we describe coding sequences from several unreported
Cenpc genes and test whether Cenpc genes are in general, like
CenH3 genes, subject to positive selection. We find evidence
for adaptive evolution of CENP-C in plants and animals,
but we find negative selection in yeasts. Our results provide
support for a meiotic drive model of centromere evolution.

Results and discussion
CenH3s evolve under negative selection in some
lineages
Previous work has shown that CenH3s are evolving adaptively in Drosophila and Arabidopsis [9,10], but their mode
of evolution in mammals is not known. Selective forces
acting on proteins can be measured by comparing the estimated rates of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution
(Ka) and synonymous substitution (Ks) between coding
sequences from closely related species. These rates are
expected to be equal if the coding sequences are evolving
neutrally (Ka/Ks = 1). Negative selection is indicated by
Ka/Ks < 1, and positive selection is indicated by Ka/Ks > 1.
To obtain a pair of closely related mammalian CenH3s, we
used the sequence of the mouse (Mus musculus) CenH3,
CENP-A [29], to query the High Throughput Genomic
Sequences portion of the GenBank database [30] with a
tblastn search, and identified a rat (Rattus norvegicus)
genomic clone (AC110465) that contains the predicted rat
CENP-A coding sequence. The predicted CENP-A protein is

encoded in four exons and is 87% identical in amino-acid
sequence to mouse CENP-A, excluding a 25 amino-acid
insertion that appears to derive from a duplication of the
amino terminus (Figure 1). This gene model is partially supported by an expressed sequence tag (EST; BF561223) that
includes the first three exons, but which terminates in the
predicted intron 3.
To determine whether Cenpa is evolving adaptively in
rodents, we compared Ka and Ks between mouse and rat
using K-estimator [31]. Positive selection in single-copy
genes that are essential in every cell is expected to be localized and more difficult to detect than in nonessential genes
or members of multigene families because of simultaneous
negative selection to maintain their essential functions. In
Drosophila and Arabidopsis, CenH3s are under positive

The rat CENP-A protein. (a) Alignment of predicted CENP-A proteins
of mammals. Relative to other mammalian CENP-As, rat CENP-A has a
25 amino-acid insertion that arises from a duplication of the amino
terminus, shown as over-lined regions. The boundary between the tail
and the histone-fold domains (HFD) is indicated below the alignment,
along with the position of Loop 1. (b) Alignment of duplicated regions
of the rat Cenpa gene (rat1 and rat2) with Cenpa genes of mouse and
Chinese hamster. The region that became duplicated in rat extends
from upstream of the start codon to codon 22 in mouse and hamster,
and is bounded by a conserved dodecamer repeat. The encoded amino
acids are shown above (rat1) or below (rat2) the duplicated sequence.

selection in their tails, but also under negative selection in
much of their histone-fold domains. We therefore used the
sliding-window function of K-estimator to scan through the
coding sequences using 99 bp windows every 33 bp in an
effort to find regions of positive selection. This analysis
detected statistically significant negative selection for all of
the windows except one that failed to rule out neutrality,
indicating that CENP-A is under negative selection (Ka = 0.11,
Ks = 0.33; Ka < Ks with p < 0.001) in both the tail and the
histone-fold domains. Similar results were obtained when
comparing either sequence with the Cenpa gene from
Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) [32], although the
greater divergence (Ks = 0.45 rat, 0.67 mouse) makes the
statistical conclusion near the limit of reliability (Ks Յ ~0.5)
because of the increased likelihood of multiple substitutions. Thus, CENP-A appears to have been under negative
selection throughout its length in multiple rodent lineages.
We also compared the human Cenpa gene [33] with the
Cenpa gene from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). A blastn
search of the Genome Sequencing Center’s assembly of the
chimpanzee genome [34] using human Cenpa identified the
chimp Cenpa gene encoded in four exons in Contig
286.218. We searched the NCBI trace archives [35] to verify
the sequence and the existence of appropriate putative
intron splice sites. The predicted chimpanzee Cenpa gene
differs from the human gene by six synonymous nucleotide
substitutions and an indel (insertion or deletion) of two
codons. This excess of synonymous substitutions indicates
negative selection of CENP-A (p < 0.01). Overall negative
selection of CENP-A appears also to extend to the bovine
(CB455530) protein, given the relatively high degree of
conservation seen for all regions, including the tail and
Loop 1 regions that evolve adaptively in Drosophila
(Figure 1a).
We also found overall negative selection in CenH3s of
grasses. We used the CENH3 gene (AF519807) of maize
(Zea mays) [36] to search ESTs [37] from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), and identified three that encode fulllength CENH3 genes (CA119873, CA127217, and
CA142604). The CenH3 proteins encoded by these ESTs
differ from each other by 2-4 amino acids. Because sugarcane is thought to be octaploid, these variants may represent co-expressed homeologs. The coding regions of ESTs
CA119873 and CA127217 differ by four synonymous and
four nonsynonymous substitutions (Ks = 0.03, Ka = 0.01),
suggesting negative selection. Comparison of either of these
sequences with maize CENH3 by sliding-window analysis
found that all windows had Ks > Ka, with overall negative
selection (Ks = 0.24, Ka = 0.13; p < 0.01). Thus, in contrast to
CenH3s in Arabidopsis and Drosophila, CenH3s of rodents,
primates, and grasses appear not to be evolving adaptively.

Talbert et al.

The evident lack of positive selection on CenH3 in mammals
and grasses raises the possibility that another kinetochore
protein is evolving in conflict with centromeric DNA in
these organisms, in which centromeric satellite sequences
are known to be evolving rapidly [2,38]. We focused on
CENP-C, which is found to co-localize with CenH3 to the
inner kinetochore in humans [13] and maize [36].

Mammalian CENP-C is evolving adaptively
To address the possibility that CENP-C is adaptively evolving in mammals, we used the mouse sequence [14] as a
query in a tblastn search to identify Cenpc ESTs from rat.
From these ESTs (see Additional data file 1, with the online
version of this article), we obtained and sequenced a fulllength cDNA (see Additional data file 2, with the online
version of this article), and compared its coding sequence
with that of the mouse Cenpc gene (68% predicted aminoacid identity). We found positive selection over most of the
amino-terminal two-thirds of the coding sequence, interrupted by one region of significant negative selection
(mouse codons 208-273), one region of nearly significant
negative selection (mouse 410-464), and three short regions
without significant selection (Figure 2a; Table 1). Most of
the carboxy-terminal one-third of the protein, including the
CENPC motif and an additional region that is homologous
to the budding yeast CENP-C protein Mif2p [22,23], has
been under negative selection. We conclude that at least
some regions of Cenpc genes are evolving adaptively in
rodents.
To determine whether any of these regions is also under
positive selection in primates, we identified the Cenpc gene
of chimpanzee by using the human Cenpc coding sequence
(GenBank accession number M95724) to search the assembled chimpanzee genome and the NCBI trace archives. We
found that the chimpanzee genome contains a single copy
of the Cenpc structural gene (contigs 375.88-375.100), as
well as a processed Cenpc pseudogene (contigs 76.64276.643), as has been found in humans [14,18,39]. The predicted chimpanzee Cenpc coding sequence differs by 17
nucleotide substitutions from the human cDNA sequence,
with Ks = 0.0054 and Ka = 0.0063. The > 99% identity of the
human and chimp coding sequences provides little opportunity to detect selection, but using sliding-window analysis
we found a single region of significant positive selection
(human codons 278-585) that overlaps the central regions
of positive selection found in the more divergent rat-mouse
comparison, indicating that the central portion of CENP-C
is under positive selection in both rodents and primates.
To confirm these results, we applied the codeml program
of PAML [40] to a multiple sequence alignment of mammalian CENP-Cs. PAML calculates the likelihood of models

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

for neutral and adaptive evolution based on a tree and estimates Ka/Ks ratios. We compared the null model with two
fixed site classes (Ka/Ks = 0 or 1) to a ‘data-driven’ model in
which two classes of sites were estimated from the data.
The data-driven model was found to be significantly more
probable than the null model (␹2 = 8.7; p = 0.01) with
Ka/Ks = 0.20 for 57% of the 685 sites in the multiple alignment and Ka/Ks = 1.64 for 43% of the sites (data not
shown). Similar results were obtained using either a DNAor a protein-based tree, or testing more complex models.
When the same tests were applied to the core region of 11
aligned Brassicaceae (mustard family) CenH3s, only 17%
of residues were estimated to be in the positive selection
class (Ka/Ks = 2.54) ([11] and data not shown), which indicates that positive selection on mammalian CENP-C has
occurred more extensively than on CenH3s.
Amino-acid sites of positive selection in mammalian
CENP-Cs were identified as those with significant posterior
probabilities. These were found to be scattered throughout
the multiply aligned region with 5 of the 18 highly significant sites prominently clustered within 25 residues (human
codons 424-448) in a region of positive selection identified
by K-estimator analysis. Therefore, pairwise K-estimator
and multiple PAML analyses yield similar results and reveal
that large regions of mammalian CENP-Cs have been adaptively evolving.

Adaptively evolving regions overlap DNA-binding
and centromere-targeting regions
The regions of positive selection in rodent and primate
CENP-Cs overlap some protein landmarks identified in functional analyses of human CENP-C. The binding activity of
human CENP-C to DNA in vitro has been mapped by two
groups of investigators. Sugimoto and colleagues [17,18]
found that the region including amino acids 396-498 bound
DNA and was stabilized by including flanking amino acids
on one or both sides (330-498 or 396-581; Figure 3a), suggesting that at least two regions in the central portion of the
protein contribute to DNA binding. Yang and colleagues
[19] identified two non-overlapping DNA-binding regions:
amino acids 23-440 and 459-943. They found a weak DNAbinding activity at the carboxyl terminus in region 638-943,
which includes the CENPC motif (737-759) and the conserved Mif2p-homologous region (890-941). This suggests
that region 459-943 itself contains at least two DNAbinding regions, a weak one at region 638-943, and a
stronger one that may correspond to region 396-581
described by Sugimoto and colleagues. Both the central
region and the carboxyl terminus have been shown to bind
DNA in vivo [21]. Comparison of the regions of positive
selection found in rodents and primates with these DNAbinding regions reveals extensive overlap with the central

DNA-binding regions (Figure 3a), including the cluster of
highly significant sites between codons 424 and 448 identified by PAML analysis. This is consistent with previous
evidence that adaptive evolution of CenH3s occurs in
regions that have been implicated in DNA binding [9,11].
No positive selection was observed for the poorly mapped

carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain in our slidingwindow analysis, suggesting either that this DNA-binding
domain is not evolving adaptively or that strong negative
selection on the CENPC motif can obscure detection by
our sliding-window analysis of positive selection on
nearby amino acids that contact centromeric DNA. In the

DNA-binding Loop 1 region of Arabidopsis CenH3, adaptively evolving codons are found in close proximity to
codons under strong negative selection [11].
In human CENP-C, three regions have been reported to
confer centromere targeting. One targeting signal was
recently reported in region 283-429 [41]. A second targeting
region was mapped by mutation to region 522-534, with
arginine 522 crucial for localization [42]. Targeting by the
conserved carboxyl terminus (728-943) occurs for species as
distant as Xenopus [21,41-43]. A segment that includes both
the first and second targeting regions (1-584) failed to confer
targeteting to centromeres in hamster BHK cells, however
[43]. We find that these two targeting regions are within the
region of positive selection in primates and overlap with
three of the regions of positive selection in rodents. A correspondence between centromere targeting and adaptive evolution has been noted for Drosophila CenH3, where the
adaptively evolving Loop 1 region has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for targeting when swapped between
native and heterologous orthologs [44]. Therefore, the lack
of centromeric targeting of a human CENP-C fragment containing the first and second targeting regions in the heterologous hamster system might be attributed to adaptive
evolution of DNA-binding specificity in these regions.
Targeting of native CENP-C proteins depends on other centromere proteins that vary according to species [45], but the
dependence of CENP-Cs on CenH3s for targeting appears to

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

be universal [24,46-49]. This dependence suggests that
CENP-C proteins contain a conserved CenH3-interacting
region, for which the CENPC motif is the only obvious candidate. The first half of the CENPC motif is rich in arginines,
whereas the second half has mixed chemical properties
including three aromatic residues (Figure 3c). In the nonspecific binding of nucleosome cores to DNA, 14 DNA contacts are made by arginines binding to the minor groove
[50]. This suggests that the weak DNA binding of the carboxyl terminus of CENP-C may be mediated by the
arginines of the CENPC motif, with the remainder of the
motif contacting a conserved structural feature of centromeric nucleosomes.
Not all regions of CENP-C that display positive selection correspond to regions that bind DNA in vitro or that are sufficient for targeting centromeres. For example, the region
comprising the most amino-terminal 200 or so amino acids
of rodent CENP-C has been evolving adaptively, but the
orthologous region in human CENP-C fails to bind DNA in
a southwestern assay [17,19] or to localize to centromeres of
human embryonic kidney cells [21]. This suggests that the
amino-terminal region of CENP-C plays a supporting role in
packaging centromeric chromatin. A parallel situation
appears to hold for the adaptively evolving amino-terminal
tail of Drosophila CenH3, which was found to be neither necessary nor sufficient for targeting in vivo to homologous centromeres. In this case, Loop 1 was identified as the targeting
domain, and the amino-terminal tail was hypothesized to
help stabilize higher-order chromatin structure by binding to
linker DNA, similar to the known binding activity of canonical histone tails [44]. If CENP-C in mammals is subject to
the same evolutionary forces that shape the adaptive evolution of the CenH3 tail in Drosophila, then CENP-C might be
playing a comparable role in the stabilization of higherorder centromeric chromatin.
Positive selection in the central DNA-binding and centromere-targeting region of CENP-C offers an explanation for
the lack of conservation of this region between chicken and
mammals [51]: as positive selection acts on the amino
acids that contact rapidly evolving centromeric satellites
and that serve to target the protein to a specific but everchanging substrate, it may eventually erase all recognizable
homology in these protein regions.

Cenpc gene structure and conservation in plants
Our finding that adaptive evolution is occurring in animal
CENP-Cs encouraged a similar survey of plant CENP-Cs,
because centromeres from both animals and seed plants
comprise rapidly evolving satellite sequences. At the time
we began this study, Cenpc genes in plants had been characterized only in maize (Z. mays), so we needed first to

whether or not the gene is evolving adaptively.
Three Cenpc homologs have been described in maize:
CenpcA, CenpcB, and CenpcC [25]. Immunological localization of CENP-CA to maize centromeres indicates that it is

probably functional, so plant relatives of maize CENP-CA
should also represent CENP-Cs. We used the CENP-CA
protein sequence (AAD39434) as a query in a tblastn search
of GenBank, and identified a single Cenpc homolog

(Figure 4). Isolation and sequencing of a full-length Cenpc
cDNA (Additional data file 2) revealed that the 705 aminoacid CENP-C protein of Arabidopsis is encoded in 11 exons,
with the CENPC motif encoded in exon 10 (Figure 5).
Recently, Arabidopsis CENP-C has been found to localize to
Arabidopsis centromeres [52].
We searched the GenBank EST database, querying with
the predicted protein sequences of maize CENP-CA and
Arabidopsis CENP-C. We identified ESTs from putative plant
Cenpc genes in 20 angiosperm species representing eight families and in the moss Physcomitrella patens (see Additional data

these ESTs and sequenced them completely (see Additional

data file 2). An alignment of the carboxyl termini encoded by
cDNAs representing six angiosperm families revealed that the
final 80 or so amino acids of CENP-C, including the CENPC
motif, are highly conserved in plants (Figure 4b). For comparison, the carboxyl termini of vertebrate CENP-C proteins
have approximately 180 amino acids following the CENPC
motif (Figure 3a), including a block of 52 amino acids that is
conserved in yeast Mif2p [22,23], but not in nematodes [24].
The carboxyl termini of plant CENP-Cs do not show significant similarity to animal and fungal CENP-Cs except for the
CENPC motif.
As an aid in identifying other conserved regions of
angiosperm CENP-Cs, we developed gene models for fulllength Cenpc cDNAs by aligning them with available genomic sequences (Additional data file 1). A full-length cDNA
from barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) encodes a protein
of 697 amino acids, which corresponds to a gene model of
eleven exons when aligned to a genomic pseudogene
(Figure 5). We also predicted gene models for Cenpc genes
in the grasses using cDNAs and genomic sequences from
rice (Oryza sativa), maize, and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)
(Figure 5). The maize gene model of 14 exons suggests an

Journal of Biology 2004,

explanation for the anomalous maize cDNA ‘CenpcC’
(AF129859) [25], which differs from all other plant Cenpcs
in encoding an unrelated carboxyl terminus. CenpcC is
99.9% identical to maize CenpcA until it diverges downstream of the CENPC motif at the point corresponding to
the end of exon 13 in our gene model. On the basis of an
overlap with maize and Sorghum genomic sequence that
spans the intron between exons 13 and 14, we conclude
that the divergent 3´ end of CenpcC derives from the
unspliced intron 13 of CenpcA, and that all angiosperm
CENP-Cs share a highly conserved carboxyl terminus.
Comparing the gene models of Arabidopsis, barrel medic,
maize, Sorghum, and rice, the limited conservation of the
encoded amino-acid sequences and approximate correspondence of exon sizes suggest that the exons in the aminoterminal half and the final two exons of plant CENP-C are
conserved (Figures 3,5). The middle region does not show
conservation of intron position or encoded peptide
sequence, indicating rapid evolution within angiosperms.
We assumed conservation of the first five intron positions in
the 5´ half of the coding sequence to generate an aminoterminal alignment that represents five families, including
the protein encoded by a beet (Beta vulgaris) cDNA that
appears to contain an unspliced intron. Our alignment
reveals short regions of conservation throughout the amino
terminus, as well as a high relative incidence of the dipeptide
SQ in the poorly conserved exon 5 (Figure 4).
Despite these short regions of conservation within
angiosperms, no sequence similarity between plant and
animal CENP-Cs could be detected outside of the CENPC
motif. Nevertheless, plant and animal CENP-Cs appear to
share an overall architecture (Figure 3). Both angiosperm
and vertebrate CENP-Cs [16] have regions of conservation
at the amino and carboxyl termini, with little or no conservation in the middle region of the protein. Remarkably,
plant and animal CENP-Cs also share the same modular
exon organization for the CENPC motif, which lies within a
105-108 bp exon (encoding 35-36 amino acids) that is
spliced in the same frame in both plants and animals (see
Additional data file 3, with the online version of this
article). Considering the similar overall lengths of plant and
animal CENP-Cs, the arrangement of conserved regions,
and the common location of the CENPC module, it appears
that corresponding regions of the protein are evolving similarly and may serve similar functions.

Recurrent exon duplications in the grasses
Multiple alignment of plant Cenpcs revealed that one region
of the gene is subject to duplication, but only in grasses.
One part of the poorly conserved middle region of the gene
has been repeatedly duplicated and deleted, thus encoding

proteins of different sizes. In rice, an ancestral pair of exons,
corresponding to exons 9 and 10 in maize CenpcA, has been
triplicated in tandem (Figure 5). To facilitate comparison
with maize and other grasses, we designated the rice exons
as 9a-10a, 9b-10b, and 9c-10c. Exon 9c has an additional
internal tandem duplication of its first 14 codons. Consensus sequences derived from overlapping truncated ESTs
(Additional data file 1) and cDNAs (Additional data file 2)
from the closely related species wheat (Triticum aestivum)
and barley (Hordeum vulgare) indicate that there are two
tandem copies of exons 9 and 10 in these species (designated 9p-10p and 9q-10q in Figure 5). We confirmed the
sequence of these exons by designing primers and amplifying the corresponding regions from wheat and barley
genomic DNAs. Single copies of exons 9 and 10 were found
in full-length cDNAs from sugarcane, Sorghum bicolor and
Sorghum propinquum (Table 2; Figure 5).
Exon duplications were also found for Sorghum species but,
surprisingly, these involved a different pair of exons, 11 and
12. One full-length cDNA from S. bicolor has only a single
copy of exons 11 and 12, whereas a truncated pseudogene
from S. bicolor and a full-length cDNA from S. propinquum
are duplicated for exons 11 and 12 (designated 11a-12a and
11b-12b). The S. bicolor pseudogene has a deletion that
joins sequences just upstream of the initiation codon in
exon 1 to sequences upstream of exon 2. Despite the presence of tandemly duplicated exons, the S. bicolor truncated
pseudogene is more closely related to the full-length
S. bicolor gene than it is to the S. propinquum gene. Exons
11 and 12 in the S. bicolor full-length gene are identical to
11b-12b in the pseudogene, but have 7 differences from
11a-12a. This suggests that the duplication of exons 11 and
12 preceded the divergence of S. propinquum and S. bicolor,
and that the full-length S. bicolor gene may have been
derived by loss of exons 11a-12a from a full-length ancestral
gene similar to the truncated pseudogene.
We wondered why two different pairs of exons, 9-10 and
11-12, were each independently subject to duplication in
the grasses. When we examined multiple alignments of the
peptide sequences encoded by both exon pairs in Logos
format, it became apparent that they resembled each other
in length and composition (Figure 6a). Exons 9 and 11 both
encode peptides of 25-28 residues that are rich in acidic
amino acids, whereas exons 10 and 12 encode peptides of
30-38 residues that are rich in basic amino acids. We compared alignments of exons 9 and 11 and alignments of
exons 10 and 12 using the Local Alignment of Multiple
Alignments (LAMA) program, and found that these exon
pairs appear to be homologous (E < 0.0001 for both comparisons). We conclude that exon pairs 9-10 and 11-12
derive from a more ancient duplication event.

To trace the likely ancestry of these duplication events, we
used an alignment of the exons from multiple species to
construct phylogenetic trees of duplicates of exons 9-10
and 11-12 (Figure 6b). This phylogeny suggests that there
have been numerous duplication events in the history of
the grasses (Figure 6c and data not shown): first, a duplication generating exons 9-10 and 11-12 in an ancestor of the
grasses; second, a duplication generating exons 9p-10p and
9q-10q; third, a duplication generating exons 11a-12a and
11b-12b in the Sorghum lineage; fourth, two duplications
generating rice exons 9a-10a, 9b-10b, and 9c-10c all within
the rice 9q-10q lineage; and fifth, a partial duplication in
rice exon 9c.
There also appear to have been at least three losses of
duplications: one of exons 11a-12a in the lineage leading to
the full-length S. bicolor gene, one of exons 11b-12b in the
sugarcane genes, and one of the hypothetical rice 9p-10p.
Alternatively, it is possible that the latter loss and one of
the rice-specific duplications resulted from gene conversion
of rice 9p-10p by a derivative of rice 9q-10q. Regardless of
the exact number of duplication and deletion events, it is
clear that the exon pair ancestral to grass exons 9-10 and
11-12 has been subjected to repeated episodes of duplication and deletion.

Plant CENP-Cs are adaptively evolving
The delineation of gene models for plant Cenpcs allowed us
to analyze them for evidence of adaptive evolution. First, we
compared Cenpcs from Arabidopsis species in which we had
previously found adaptively evolving CenH3s. Using the
A. thaliana genomic sequence to design primers, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced a Cenpc cDNA from A. arenosa
(Additional data file 2). Comparing this sequence with that
of A. thaliana, the predicted proteins differ by 87 amino-acid
subtitutions out of 703 alignable residues, plus five indels of
1-3 amino acids.
We applied the sliding window option of K-estimator to the
aligned coding sequences of A. thaliana and A. arenosa
Cenpc. At three regions, Ka exceeded its 99% confidence
interval for the null hypothesis, indicating that these regions
are under positive selection (Figures 2b,3). These regions
correspond approximately to exon 5 (codons 178-221 in the
A. thaliana sequence), the 3´ half of exon 6 (codons 376-441),
and exons 8 and 9 (codons 486-618). In addition, a region
encompassing most of exons 1 and 2 (codons 24-89) was
found to be under positive selection with p < 0.03. We also
determined that the 5´ half of exon 6 (codons 255-386) and
the conserved exons 10 and 11 (codons 595-703) are under
negative selection with p < 0.01.

Talbert et al.

Curiously, an indel at the beginning of exon 9, where the
A. arenosa cDNA has a CAG (glutamine) codon that is
absent in the A. thaliana cDNA, appears to be caused by the
species-specific use of alternative acceptor splice sites,
because the genomic sequence (data not shown) at this
intron-exon boundary is identical in both species (...cag cag
^GAG GGT... or ...cag ^CAG GAG GGT...). The presence of
species-specific alternative splicing of the same codon in an
adaptively evolving region suggests that splicing variation
can contribute to adaptive variability.
To examine whether positive selection in Cenpc is unique to
Arabidopsis or occurs more generally in plants, we compared
Cenpc genes from the two Sorghum species. We removed the
duplicate exons 11a and 12a from the S. propinquum coding
sequence in order to compare the sequence with the fulllength gene from S. bicolor. For this comparison, Ka = 0.014
and Ks = 0.003. Ka exceeds the 99% confidence interval of
the null hypothesis, and neutral evolution can be rejected in
favor of positive selection. The limited divergence between
these two sequences did not allow statistically significant
conclusions to be drawn about positive selection in particular regions of the gene.
To address which regions are under positive selection, we
compared the S. bicolor sequence with the maize CenpcA
coding sequence (75% amino-acid identity). Between maize
CenpcA and S. bicolor, Ka = 0.12, Ks = 0.14, and there are
seven indels of 1-11 codons. We identified positive selection for a single window in exon 1, for a region including all
of exon 5, for a region in the second half of exon 6, and for
a region from the end of exon 12 through most of exon 14
(Table 2 and Figure 2c). Negative selection was found for a
region from exons 1-4, a region in the middle one-third of
exon 6, and a region from the end of exon 6 through exon
12 (Table 2 and Figure 2c). The regions of positive selection
seen in exons 1 and 5 clearly overlap the corresponding
regions in Arabidopsis (Figure 3b). Although the region of
positive selection seen in exon 6 of the grasses cannot be
aligned with that in exon 6 of Arabidopsis because of
sequence divergence, they occur in the same general area of
the protein.
The region of positive selection in exons 12-14 was somewhat
surprising given the strong conservation around the CENPC
motif, and we wondered if this selection was specific to the
maize or Sorghum lineage. To test this possibility, we compared maize CenpcA and S. bicolor Cenpc with a Cenpc gene
from sugarcane. Of three sugarcane cDNAs that we obtained
(Additional data file 2), two had identical coding sequences
(Cenpc1), and the third (Cenpc2) differed by 13 nucleotide
substitutions, suggesting that Cenpc1 and Cenpc2 may be
homeologous genes in the polyploid sugarcane genome. We

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

compared Cenpc1 to maize CenpcA and S. bicolor Cenpc.
Regions of positive or negative selection identified in the
maize/Sorghum comparison were generally found to coincide
with regions under selection in the corresponding direction
in maize/sugarcane and Sorghum/sugarcane comparisons,
although in a few cases the selection was not found at the
p < 0.05 level of significance in all comparisons (Table 2).
We conclude that these regions are subject to recurrent
adaptive evolution.
In two cases, a region was found to be under significant
selection in opposite directions in different comparisons.
First, a region in exon 6 (maize codons 232-286) that was
not under significant selection in the maize/S. bicolor comparison was under negative selection in the maize/sugarcane comparison, but under positive selection in the
S. bicolor/sugarcane comparison; this suggests that positive
selection in S. bicolor and negative selection in maize combined to give a non-significant result in the maize/S. bicolor
comparison. Second, the region of positive selection in
exons 12-14 identified from the maize/Sorghum comparison
was under positive selection in the maize/sugarcane comparison, but under negative selection in the Sorghum/sugarcane comparison, indicating that the positive selection in
this region is unique to the maize CenpcA lineage (Table 2,
Figure 3b). Therefore, in some regions of CENP-C adaptive
evolution appears to be episodic, as has been seen previously for primate lysozymes [53].
Phylogeny-based PAML analysis confirms that plant
CENP-Cs are adaptively evolving and in an episodic fashion,
consistent with inferences based on pairwise K-estimator
analysis. As was found for mammalian CENP-C, the datadriven model for grass CENP-C was found to be significantly
more probable than the null model (␹2 = 12.0; p = 0.003)
with Ka/Ks = 0.00 for 51% of the 686 sites in the multiple
alignment and Ka/Ks= 2.00 for 49% of the sites (data not
shown). Using the PAML ‘free-ratio’ option that measures
Ka/Ks differences between branches in a tree [54], we found
that CENP-C is adaptively evolving (␹2 = 10.0; p = 0.007 for
the data-driven over the null model) along both Sorghum
lineages (Ka/Ks = 2.6) and along the sugarcane Cenpc2
lineage (Ka/Ks = 1.3) but not detectably along the sugarcane
Cenpc1 lineage (Ka/Ks = 0.23). PAML analysis also confirmed that the carboxy-terminal region of maize CenpcA is
adaptively evolving (␹2 = 7.8; p = 0.02 for the data-driven
model over the null model) with Ka/Ks = 1.4. Thus, different
methods of analysis demonstrate that CENP-Cs are adaptively evolving in an episodic fashion in grasses that have
multiple CENP-C copies.
Maize CenpcA is co-expressed with another Cenpc gene,
CenpcB [25], for which incomplete sequence information is

available (AF129858, AW062057, and AY109432). The
available CenpcB sequence begins in exon 5 and continues
through exon 14, and has seven in-frame indels relative to
CenpcA. We found negative selection in a region from the
end of exon 5 through the first half of exon 6 (CenpcA
codons 205-358, p < 0.01), and positive selection from the
end of exon 6 through exon 7 (codons 403-492, p < 0.01).
Elsewhere the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Comparing CenpcB with S. bicolor, Ka = 0.13 and Ks = 0.11, and
there are six in-frame indels between the sequences. We
found positive selection in the first half of exon 6 (Sorghum
codons 273-327, p < 0.03) and negative selection from exon
10 through the first few codons of exon 13 (codons 537-619,
p < 0.02). Elsewhere the null hypothesis could not be
rejected. In summary, regions under negative selection in
other grass Cenpcs can be under positive selection in CenpcB,
and regions under positive selection in other grass Cenpcs
are under negative selection or evolving neutrally in CenpcB
(Figure 3b), suggesting that CENP-CB has been subjected to
different selective forces since its divergence from CENP-CA.
Just as gene duplication can result in different selective
pressures on the two genes, duplications within a gene can
lead to specialization and thus can change selective pressures on the region. Such specialization appears to have
occurred between the anciently duplicated region encoded
by exons 9-10 and 11-12 (Figure 6a). In maize, sugarcane,
and Sorghum we detected negative selection for exons 9-12,
but in the more recent duplication of exons 9 and 10 in
wheat and barley we detected positive selection in a region
from the last codon of the first copy of exon 10 to the first
four codons of exon 12 (p < 0.01). Additional windows in
exons 9p-10p and 12 had Ka > Ks (p > 0.05), suggesting
that most of the duplicated region has been evolving adaptively (Figure 2d). In contrast, in the adjacent conserved
carboxy-terminal region (corresponding to CenpcA codons
625-690), we detected only negative selection (p = 0.01),
as though exon duplication allowed for adaptation.
We find an approximate correspondence between adaptively evolving regions in angiosperms and those in mammals that overlap DNA-binding and centromere-targeting
regions. Although no DNA-binding regions have been
experimentally determined for plant CENP-Cs, the correspondence with animal CENP-Cs suggests that the different
regions play comparable roles. One of the corresponding
adaptive regions is repeatedly duplicated in grasses, and the
distribution of basic residues in exons 10 and 12 suggests
that the repeat unit binds DNA. A parallel situation again
appears to be found for the amino-terminal tails of some
Drosophila CenH3s, which contain repeats of a minorgroove-binding motif that are thought to provide DNA
compositional preference [12]. Thus, both plant and animal

Volume 3, Article 18

Talbert et al. 18.13

CENP-Cs show adaptively evolving features that parallel
those found in CenH3s.

Yeast MIF2 is under negative selection
If positive selection for CENP-Cs in plants and animals is
related to centromere complexity, then we would expect conventional negative selection to operate in organisms such as
budding yeast, which have simple centromeres. The MIF2
genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [26] and S. paradoxus [55]
are 93% identical in amino-acid sequence, with Ka = 0.036
and Ks = 0.38. In sharp contrast to all pairwise comparisons of plant and animal Cenpc genes, Ka was much less
than Ks for all of the 99 bp windows of yeast MIF2, indicating that it is under negative selection throughout its length
(p < 0.001). In all pairwise comparisons among these two
species and the additional species S. mikatae and
S. bayanus [55], we consistently found evidence of negative selection with Ka << Ks (range of Ka, 0.036-0.093;
range of Ks, 0.38-0.82). We also found strong negative
selection for all 99 bp windows in pairwise comparisons of
yeast CenH3 (Cse4p; data not shown). Thus, adaptive evolution of both CenH3s and CENP-Cs appears to be limited
to organisms with complex centromeres.

Meiotic drive model of centromere evolution
We have demonstrated that CENP-C has been adaptively
evolving in multiple lineages of both plants and animals, a
feature that had been previously shown for some CenH3s.
Thus, the occurrence of adaptive evolution appears to be a
general feature of proteins that bind to complex centromeres. Recurrent adaptive evolution implies an arms race,
and an arms race involving centromeric DNA-binding proteins is remarkable given that centromeres have a conserved
function. But centromeric DNA is rapidly evolving in plants
and animals, so adaptation of the major centromere DNAbinding proteins would maintain an interface with the conserved kinetochore machinery. Indeed, regions of CENP-C
that show evidence of positive selection include DNAbinding and specificity regions, in parallel with previous
findings for Drosophila and Arabidopsis CenH3 [9,11,44].
A ‘meiotic drive’ model has been proposed to explain the
rapid evolution of centromeric DNAs and CenH3s [1].
According to this model, centromeres compete during
female meiosis for inclusion in the single meiotic product
that becomes the egg nucleus and so gets transmitted to the
next generation. In both animals and seed plants, which of
the four meiotic products becomes the egg nucleus is determined by its position in the female tetrad. A centromere
variant will increase in the population if it achieves an orientation in female meiosis resulting in its inclusion in the
egg nucleus more frequently than its competitors. For
example, an expansion of a satellite array may lead to a

Talbert et al.

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

‘stronger’ centromere variant with an expanded kinetochore
that attracts more microtubules and results in a slightly
greater probability of a favorable orientation in female
meiosis. The mechanism of such orientation is unknown,
but in some insects and plants the female meiotic spindle
has an asymmetric distribution of microtubules or is
monopolar [56], so a stronger centromere variant might
better capture the favored pole. The new variant will therefore increase in the population and eventually become
fixed. This meiotic drive process (‘centromere drive’) can
account for the rapid evolution and complex structure of
centromeric DNA. As a rare new variant spreads in the population, however, disparities in centromere strength may
interfere with fertility in males, where the four meiotic products contribute equally to the next generation. Mutations in
CenH3 that restore centromere parity in meiosis will therefore be selected in males, resulting in the adaptive evolution
of CenH3 and suppression of the meiotic drive of centromeric DNA. Recurrent cycles of meiotic drive by centromere
variants, or centromere drive, and suppression by CenH3
mutations would result in the observed rapid evolution of
both centromeres and CenH3s.

Centromere drive may have important consequences for
karyotypic evolution. Centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes frequently fuse (Robertsonian translocations),
and metacentrics often misdivide to yield two acrocentrics.
In humans, there is a bias in favor of Robertsonian
translocations over their homologous acrocentric pair when
transmitted by females, and male carriers have reduced fertility [58]. This general sterility of Robertsonian males is
consistent with centromere drive underlying post-zygotic
reproductive isolation in emerging species [1]. Centromere
drive provides a mechanism for the tendency of karyotypes
to be either mostly metacentric or mostly acrocentric [59]
and for the karyotype-specific accumulation of selfish B
chromosomes in mammals [60]. Our finding that CENP-Cs,
like CenH3s, evolve adaptively addresses a perceived shortcoming of the centromere drive model for post-zygotic
reproductive isolation: mutations that rescued hybrid sterility did not map to the Drosophila CenH3 gene [61,62]. The
fact that CenH3 is not the only adaptively evolving centromere protein indicates that there are multiple candidate
drive suppressors that might rescue hybrid sterility when in
a mutant form.

The lack of evidence for adaptive evolution in CenH3s from
mammals and grasses does not seem to fit this scenario.
But the extensive positive selection on the corresponding
CENP-Cs provides a ready explanation for the absence of
an adaptive signal for CenH3. The meiotic drive model predicts that over evolutionary time any mutation that restores
centromere parity will be selected, suggesting that proteins
besides CenH3 - and in particular other kinetochore proteins that contact centromeric DNA - may be positively
selected to suppress centromere drive. Our demonstration
of the adaptive evolution of CENP-C, especially in DNAbinding regions, fulfills this prediction of the centromere
drive model. Apparently, in mammals and grasses CENP-C
performs the function of a suppressor of meiotic drive.

In contrast to CENP-Cs of plants and animals, yeast Mif2p
appears to have evolved entirely under negative selection.
This is consistent with Mif2p interacting with a stable centromere, rather than one that is rapidly evolving. In accordance with this observation, budding yeast centromeres are
determined by the presence of a consensus DNA sequence
that includes binding sites for the Cbf1 and CBF3 proteins
[49]. The consensus DNA sequences and their binding proteins are recognizably similar in yeasts as distantly related as
Candida glabrata and Kluyveromyces lactis, which have greater
average divergence from budding yeast in protein sequences
than mammals have from fish [63]. We attribute this
extreme conservation of centromere sequence to optimization of the DNA-protein interactions at the centromere.
Such optimization would be inevitable in fungi that
produce equivalent gametes in a tetrad. No such optimization would occur when centromeres compete at female
meiosis I for a favored orientation. Seed plants and animals
evolved female meiosis independently, so the parallels that
we see for evolution of CenH3 and CENP-C would reflect
parallel evolutionary forces in these two ancient lineages.

The large size and lack of sequence conservation of CENP-Cs
make them much larger mutational targets for suppression
than CenH3s. Moreover, PAML analysis suggests that a
larger proportion of CENP-C than CenH3 residues are
evolving adaptively. Mammalian CENP-A consists of a wellconserved histone-fold domain with only a short unconstrained tail region. Conversely, Drosophila species have the
longest CenH3 tails known [12] but lack any identifiable
CENP-C homologs. It is tempting to speculate that the interaction of the long CenH3 tail of Drosophila with centromeric
satellites compensates for the absence of CENP-C and permitted its loss. This might explain why Drosophila CenH3s
localize in a species-specific manner [44], whereas human
CENP-A can be functionally replaced by its budding yeast
CenH3 counterpart [57].

Materials and methods
DNA clones and sequencing
Genomic DNAs and cDNAs were obtained from several
sources (Additional data file 2). The A. thaliana cDNA was
amplified from a cDNA pool from whole plants of the
ecotype Columbia, and the A. arenosa cDNA was amplified
from a cDNA pool from leaves of Care-1 [64]. Both of

Journal of Biology 2004, 3:18

http://jbiol.com/content/3/4/18

Journal of Biology 2004,

these cDNAs were amplified using the same primers:
5´-GGAATTTTCCGGTGATTTAGATG-3´, which terminates
in the initiation codon, and 5´-TGATCACAAGAGGATGGTTGA-3´, from the 3´ untranslated region of the A. thaliana
genomic Cenpc sequence. Genomic DNAs from wheat and
barley were generously provided by Andreas Houben. Exons
9p-10p and the intervening intron 9p were amplified from
both wheat and barley using the primers 5´-AGATGAACCAATCCATCCAC-3´ and 5´-AAATTCGTTTTCCTCTCTTTGCT-3´. Likewise, 9q-10q and intron 9q were amplified with
the primers 5´-AGATAAGCCAATCCATACATCA-3´ and
5´-CCCCTCTTTTCATTCTCTTCAA-3´. The first and last of
these four primers were also used to amplify both exon
pairs as a unit to confirm their contiguity and to determine
the genomic sequence around the junctions of intron 10p
with exons 10p and 9q. Amplifications used High Fidelity
Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The
amplified fragments were cloned using the pCR2.1-TOPOTA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Sequencing was carried out using ABI Big Dye
sequencing on both strands of all reported sequences.
Sequencing primers were standard vector primers or were
designed using Primer 3 [65]. Sequences were assembled
using Sequencher 4.1.2 software [66]. Accession numbers of
sequences are given in Additional data file 2, with the online
version of this article.

Sequence analyses
Sequence similarities of genes and their encoded proteins
were identified using the NCBI BLAST server [35,67], as well
as by use of Gramene [68] and the TIGR Gene Indices [69].
Translations and sequence manipulations utilized the
Sequence Manipulation Suite [70,71]. Alignments of coding
and amino-acid sequences were performed using the European Bioinformatics Institute Clustal W Server [72,73], with
adjustments by hand to take account of splice-site alignment. Conservation in alignments was displayed using
MacBoxShade 2.1 (MD Baron, Institute for Animal Health,
Surrey, UK). Protein blocks were made, displayed, and compared using the Multiple Alignment Processor, sequence
Logos, and LAMA [74] programs on the Blocks WWW Server
[75]. To make blocks from grass exons 9-12, gaps in
ClustalW alignments were first filled with Xs, which do not
appear in subsequent sequence Logos representations. Gene
models of exon-intron boundaries were made by alignment
of cDNAs with identical or homologous genomic

We estimated Ka and Ks for windows of 99 nucleotides,
positioned every 33 nucleotides. For candidate regions of
positive selection, we determined the confidence intervals
of Ka and Ks under the null hypothesis that Ka is equal to Ks
using the default parameters (1,000 replicates). For individual windows of 99 nucleotides, or for regions defined by
contiguous groups of overlapping windows, limited trial
and error suggested that statistically significant positive
selection was not supported if Ka/Ks < 1.5. Therefore, to find
evidence of positive selection, we determined the confidence
intervals for regions defined by sets of overlapping or immediately adjacent 99 nucleotide windows with Ka/Ks у 1.5.
For regions with Ks = 0, one or more flanking windows
with Ks > 0 were included in the region analyzed, regardless
of the value of Ka, so that a value for Ka/Ks could be
defined. Similarly, we looked for statistically significant
negative selection for regions defined by overlapping or
adjacent 99 nucleotide windows with Ka/Ks р 0.67. The
codeml program of PAML version 3.13d [40] was also used
to test for positive selection and to estimate Ka/Ks ratios as
previously described [11].
