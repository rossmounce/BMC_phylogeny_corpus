Expression of tung tree diacylglycerol
acyltransferase 1 in E. coli
Heping Cao*, Dorselyn C Chapital, Jay M Shockey and K Thomas Klasson

Abstract
Background: Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) catalyze the final and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol (TAG)
biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. Database search has identified at least 59 DGAT1 sequences from 48
organisms, but the expression of any DGAT1 as a full-length protein in E. coli had not been reported because
DGAT1s are integral membrane proteins and difficult to express and purify. The objective of this study was to
establish a procedure for expressing full-length DGAT1 in E. coli.
Results: An expression plasmid containing the open reading frame for tung tree (Vernicia fordii) DGAT1 fused to
maltose binding protein and poly-histidine affinity tags was constructed and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3).
Immunoblotting showed that the recombinant DGAT1 (rDGAT1) was expressed, but mostly targeted to the
membranes and insoluble fractions. Extensive degradation also occurred. Nonetheless, the fusion protein was
partially purified from the soluble fraction by Ni-NTA and amylose resin affinity chromatography. Multiple proteins
co-purified with DGAT1 fusion protein. These fractions appeared yellow in color and contained fatty acids. The
rDGAT1 was solubilized from the insoluble fraction by seven detergents and urea, with SDS and Triton X-100 being
the most effective detergents. The solubilized rDGAT1 was partially purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
PreScission protease digestion confirmed the identity of rDGAT1 and showed extensive precipitation following NiNTA affinity purification.
Conclusions: This study reports the first procedure for expressing full-length DGAT1 from any species using a
bacterial expression system. The results suggest that recombinant DGAT1 is degraded extensively from the carboxyl
terminus and associated with other proteins, lipids, and membranes.

Background
The functions of a considerable percentage of the proteins encoded by the sequenced genomes of many
organisms including human, mouse, Arabidopsis, and
rice are not clear. The immediate task of post-genomic
biology is to determine the biological functions of proteins coded for by these genes. Many endogenous proteins occur in extremely low abundance but
recombinant protein can be used as alternative sources
to endogenous proteins for studying protein structure
and function [1], for making high-titer antibodies [2-4],
and for producing pharmaceutical reagents. However, a
great number of proteins are difficult to express due to
protein insolubility, protein degradation, and low-level

protein expression [5]. Therefore, production of high
quality recombinant protein requires optimization of
protein expression and purification procedures.
Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) are responsible for the last and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol
(TAG) biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. DGAT
genes have been isolated from many organisms [6]. At
least two forms of DGATs are present in mammals [7,8]
and plants [9,10] with additional forms reported in
burning bush (Euonymus alatus) [11] and peanut [12].
DGAT isoforms have nonredundant functions in TAG
biosynthesis in plants such as tung tree (Vernicia fordii)
[10] and animals such as mice [13]. Tung tree genome
has two well-known DGAT isoforms (DGAT1 and
DGAT2) which are targeted to distinct subdomains of
the ER membrane, and likely carry out different roles in
seed lipid metabolism [10]. Mice deficient in DGAT1
are viable, have modest decreases in TAG, and are

resistant to diet-induced obesity [14,15]. Mice deficient
in DGAT2 have severe reduction of TAG and die
shortly after birth [13]. The fact that DGAT1 is unable
to compensate for the deficiency in DGAT2 knockout
mice indicates that each DGAT isoform has unique
functions in TAG biosynthesis during mammal
development.
Database search has identified at least 59 DGAT1
sequences from 48 organisms (Figure 1). However, there
is a gap of knowledge between the gene sequences and
the proteins coded for by the DGAT genes [6].
Although DGAT expression was reported in several studies, only limited success has been achieved due to the
facts that DGATs are integral membrane proteins
[10,16] and are difficult to express and purify using heterologous hosts [17,18]. Information regarding the
expression of DGAT1 gene in E. coli is limited. The
amino terminal 116 amino acid residues of oilseed rape
(Brassica napus) DGAT1 was expressed as a His-tag
protein in E. coli [18]. Similar studies reported on the
production of the amino terminal 95 residues of mouse
DGAT1 in E. coli [19]. However, the expression of
DGAT1 as a full-length protein in E. coli had not been
reported. The objective of this study was to develop a
reliable procedure for the expression of a full-length
DGAT1 in E. coli using tung tree DGAT1 (one of the
two isoforms from tung tree) as the model protein.

Results
Construction of bacterial expression plasmid

Plasmid pMBP-DGAT1-His was engineered to express
the full-length Vernicia fordii (tung tree) DGAT1 in an
E. coli protein expression system. The recombinant protein MBP-DGAT1-His (rDGAT1) contained a MBP
(maltose binding protein) at the amino terminus and 6
histidine residues (His) at the carboxyl terminus (Figure
2). A PreScission protease cleavage site was engineered
between the MBP and DGAT1 fusion partners. The
“Methods” section describes the details of the plasmid
construction.
Degradation of recombinant DGAT1 in the soluble
fraction of E. coli

The expression of rDGAT1 was induced by IPTG in E.
coli strain BL21(DE3) and detected by immunoblotting
using anti-MBP-hTTP and anti-MBP-mTTP polyclonal
antibodies, which were raised in rabbits against purified
recombinant human and mouse TTP proteins fused to
MBP [2,3]. These antibodies have been shown to react
with MBP and MBP fusion proteins with high specificity
[2,3].
Anti-MBP-mTTP antibodies detected a number of
bands ranging from approximately 40 kDa (corresponding to that of MBP, 42 kDa) to 60 kDa and a trace

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of DGAT1s. The evolutionary
relationships among the 59 DGAT1s from 48 organisms were
analyzed by phylogenetic analysis based on the Neighbor-Joining
method of Saitou and Nei [35]. The name of each protein sequence
consists of the initials of the organism followed by the assigned
subfamily of DGATs in the databases and the GenBank accession
number. The numbers in the parenthesis following DGAT names are
the calculated distance values, which reflect the degree of

rDGAT1 (909 amino acid residues, 102 kDa) (Figure
3A). There was no significant difference in protein
expression levels among different starting colonies of
the bacterium. The expression levels, judged from the
overall full-length and degradation products, were
decreased under longer expression time tested (Figure

degradation products were detected in the cells without
IPTG induction (Figure 3A), indicating a high basal
level expression of the recombinant protein under uninduced conditions. The 60 kDa band corresponds to protein smaller than the 80-kDa-sized MBP-mTTP fusion
protein (a positive control for the antibodies in lane 2 of
Figure 3A). Recombinant DGAT1 expression was not
significantly different when protein expression was
induced at 25°C or 37°C, nor under culture medium
with or without 0.2% glucose (data not shown). Similar
results were obtained using anti-MBP-hTTP antibodies
and the commercial anti-MBP antibodies (data not
shown). In agreement with the immunoblotting results
shown in Figure 3A, a protein staining gel showed that
no distinct band with a molecular mass corresponding
to the full-length rDGAT1 was observed in the 10,000g
supernatant from the uninduced and IPTG-induced
cells (Figure 3B).
As a control experiment, plasmid pMAL-c2X vector
was transformed into the same type of E. coli. Like
rDGAT1 expression in the uninduced cells described
above, MBP protein was clearly produced in the uninduced cells (Figure 3C). In contrast to the minimal
expression of rDGAT1 in E. coli (Figure 3A and 3B),
MBP was massively induced by IPTG in the same type
of cells (Figure 3C), which was specifically recognized by
the commercial anti-MBP antibodies [1] and the same
anti-MBP-hTTP antibodies [2] and anti-MBP-mTTP
antibodies [3] used in the current study. These results
suggest that rDGAT1 was expressed well but was extensively degraded in E. coli under the experimental
conditions.

Amylose resin affinity chromatography was used to
identify the trace amount of the full-length protein as
rDGAT1 shown in Figure 3. Based on the expression
studies described above, DGAT1 fusion protein expression in E. coli was scaled up. The 10,000g supernatant
was applied onto an MBPTrap HP column. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 20
mM maltose. However, no clear protein peak was eluted
with maltose as judged from UV absorbance at 280 nm
(data not shown). Immunoblotting confirmed that the
great majority if not all of the immuno-reactive proteins
did not bind to amylose resin and was enriched in the
unbound fractions (Figure 4A).
To investigate if the recombinant protein was in the
insoluble fraction, the 10,000g pellet was sonicated
extensively in the same homogenization buffer. This
supernatant was used for MBPTrap column purification.
The great majority of the “released” recombinant
DGAT1 did not bind to the column (as in the case with

Figure 4 Localization of recombinant DGAT1 in the insoluble fraction and membranes of E. coli. (A) Trace amount of rDGAT1 was in the
soluble fraction. The 10,000g supernatant of E. coli transformed with pMBP-DGAT1-His was loaded onto an MBPTrap HP column. The column
was washed extensively with amylose resin wash buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with amylose resin elution buffer containing 20 mM
maltose. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Recombinant DGAT1 was identified by anti-MBP-hTTP antibodies. (B) The majority of
rDGAT1 was in the insoluble fraction. The 10,000g pellet of E. coli transformed with pMBP-DGAT1-His was subject to extensive sonication
followed by centrifugation at 10,000g. This supernatant was loaded onto an MBPTrap HP column. Separation and detection of the recombinant
protein was identical to those in panel A. (C) Localization of rDGAT1 in the membranes. The 10,000g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000g.

the soluble rDGAT1) and was mainly recovered in the
unbound fractions (Figure 4B). However, immunoblotting showed that the full-length rDGAT1 was much
more enriched in the pellet than in the soluble fraction
of E. coli and some full-length protein was eluted from
the column (Figure 4A versus 4B, right lanes).
To localize the trace amount of the recombinant protein in the supernatant shown in panel A, the 10,000g

supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000g. Immunoblotting showed that rDGAT1 was mainly associated with
the membrane fraction and only a smaller fraction of
rDGAT1 in the cytosol (Figure 4C).
Figure 4A and 4B showed that rDGAT1 bound to
amylose resin poorly because little rDGAT1 was recovered in the eluted fractions. To provide a positive control for amylose resin affinity purification, E. coli extract

with overexpressed MBP shown in Figure 3C was
applied to amylose resin. Significant amounts of MBP
bound to the affinity resin and was purified to near
homogeneity by the affinity chromatography, although
lots of the recombinant MBP did not bind to the same
affinity beads (Figure 4D). These results suggest that
rDGAT1 may be folded in a way to prevent MBP fusion
partner from binding to the affinity resin.
Purification of recombinant DGAT1 with Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography

Ni-NTA beads were used to test the purification of the
recombinant protein using the 10,000g supernatant. The
bound proteins were eluted with successively increasing
imidazole concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 mM.
SDS-PAGE showed that the purified fractions contained

a number of proteins as shown by Coomassie blue staining (Figure 5A). The majority of the bound recombinant
protein (as detected by immunoblotting) was eluted
with 200-250 mM imidazole in the elution buffer and
no recombinant protein was detected in the washes
(Figure 5B). rDGAT1 only partially bound to Ni-NTA
beads because a significant amount of the full-length
rDGAT1 was recovered in the unbound fraction (data
not shown). As expected, MBP and most of the degradation products were not bound to the Ni-NTA beads
because the immunoreactive bands on the blot corresponded to the full-length rDGAT1 (Figures 3, 4 vs. 5B).
A protein band with approximately twice the size (>150
kDa) of the full-length rDGAT1 was seen in the eluted
fractions on the immunoblot after SDS-denatured gel
separation (Figure 5B). A similar immunoreactive band

with the higher molecular mass was also observed on
other immunoblots (see below).
Purification of recombinant DGAT1 with tandem Ni-NTA
and amylose resin affinity chromatography

The proteins eluted by 250 mM imidazole from NiNTA affinity beads (Figure 5A) were pooled and centrifuged at 10,000g. The supernatant was loaded onto an
amylose resin affinity column. FPLC chromatogram
showed that the great majority of proteins were washed
off the column and little protein was bound to the
MBPTrap column (data not shown), similar to those
observed using the 10,000g supernatant (Figure 5A).
Coomassie blue staining showed that the additional affinity purification step did not improve the purity (Figure
5C). Immunoblotting showed that part of the recombinant protein was precipitated (Figure 5D, lane P vs. line
S) and rDGAT1 was detected in the unbound fractions
(Figure 5D) but undetectable in the eluted fractions
(data not shown).
SDS solubilization and purification of recombinant DGAT1
from insoluble fraction

Immunoblotting showed that the great majority of
rDGAT1 was recovered in the 10,000g pellet (Figure 4B).

Therefore, SDS was used to solubilize rDGAT1 from
10,000g as well as the 25,000 g pellet fractions followed
by purification with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
Immunoblotting showed that full-length rDGAT1 was
barely detectable in the 25,000 g supernatant and the
wash (Figure 6A). Some full-length rDGAT1 and several
degraded protein bands were detected in the unbound
fraction and the major protein band was detected in the
eluted fraction (Figure 6A). The full-length rDGAT1 was
stable in cells under IPTG induction for 2-24 h as
demonstrated in the purified fractions from the SDSsolubilized pellet (Figure 6B).
Detergent and urea solubilization and purification of
recombinant DGAT1 from insoluble fraction

As the results indicated that rDGAT1 was associated
with the insoluble pellet, an attempt was made to solubilize the recombinant protein from the 10,000g pellet
with seven different detergents (Brij 35, CHAPS, NP-40,
SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 20 and Tween 80) and urea
followed by purification with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Immunoblotting showed that SDS was the most
effective detergent for rDGAT1 solubilization, while
only small amounts of the full-length rDGAT1 was
detected in the solubilized fractions by other detergents

Figure 6 SDS solubilization and purification of recombinant DGTA1 from insoluble fraction by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
Recombinant DGAT1 was induced by IPTG for various time. Cell extract was centrifuged at 10,000g resulting in the supernatant (S10) and the
pellet (P10). S10 was further centrifuged at 25,000g resulted in the supernatant (S25) and the pellet (P25). P10 and P25 were solubilized by 0.4%
SDS followed by centrifugation at 50,000g (S50). S50 and Ni-NTA purification fractions were used for detecting rDGAT1 by immunoblotting with

(Figure 7A, lanes 2-7). The optimal concentrations for
SDS solubilization were 0.3-1% (Figure 7A, lanes 11-13).
Ni-NTA affinity purification showed that solubilization
by both SDS and Triton X-100 resulted in the highest
yields of full-length rDGAT1 (Figure 7B, lanes 5-6 and
10-13). Therefore, various concentrations of Triton X100 were tested for the solubilization of rDGAT1 from
the pellet. Immunoblotting showed that 0.3-1% Triton
X-100 were the optimal concentrations for the extraction (Figure 7C, lanes 2-8) and purification (Figure 7D,
lanes 2-8). Urea at 4 M and 6 M also solubilized the
fusion protein to a significant level (Figure 7C, lanes 912). However, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography indicated that rDGAT1 from urea-solubilized samples
bound to the affinity beads poorly because much less of
the full-length protein was obtained in the urea-solubilized protein solution (Figure 7D, lanes 9-12). Silver
staining of the purified fractions indicated multiple

proteins co-purified with the recombinant protein (data
not shown). Extensive efforts were directed to purify
rDGAT1 from the Ni-NTA purified proteins following
SDS and Triton X100 solubilization. However, the protein could not be purified to near homogeneity by amylose resin affinity, Superose 12 size exclusion, and Mono
Q anion exchange chromatography (data not shown).
PreScission protease digestion of recombinant DGAT1

Immunoblotting results showed that MBP-TTP antibodies detected multiple protein bands from soluble fraction (Figure 3), insoluble fraction (Figure 4B),
membrane fraction (Figure 4C), Ni-NTA and amylose
resin affinity-purified fractions (Figure 5), and detergentand urea-solubilized fractions (Figures 6 and 7). To confirm the identity of the full-length rDGAT1, PreScission
protease digestion was performed using rDGAT1 purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Figure 5A)

by centrifugation at 20,000g for 10 min. The 20,000g supernatant was used for affinity purification with Ni-NTA beads. Recombinant DGAT1 was

because a PreScission protease cleavage site was engineered between MBP and DGAT1 fusion partners (Figure 2). The rDGAT1 sample was digested by the
protease overnight followed by centrifugation at 10,000g.
Immunoblotting showed that a protein band with the
size of MBP was detected in the soluble fraction but not
in the undigested protein sample (Figure 8, lane 1 vs.
lane 2). It also showed that the great majority of
rDGAT1 was recovered in the pellet following digestion
(Figure 8, lane 2 vs. lane 3). These results confirmed the
identity of rDGAT1 and showed extensive precipitation
of rDGAT1 following purification.

Discussion
Diacylglycerol acyltransferase families (DGATs) catalyze
the final and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol (TAG)
biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. Understanding the
roles of DGATs will help to create transgenic plants
with value-added properties and provide information for
therapeutic intervention for obesity and related diseases.
Database search has identified at least 59 DGAT1
sequences from 48 organisms (Figure 1), but the expression of any DGAT1 as a full-length protein in E. coli

Figure 8 PreScission protease digestion of recombinant
DGAT1. The Ni-NTA affinity-purified rDGAT1 was digested with
PreScission protease followed by centrifugation at 10,000g.
Equivalent amounts of protein in the undigested, the supernatant
and the pellet of the digestion mixtures were separated by 4-20%
SDS-PAGE and detected with anti-MBP-mTTP antibodies. The fulllength rDGAT1 and the released MBP are marked with arrows.

had not been reported. Here a procedure was described
for expressing recombinant full-length DGAT1 in a bacterial expression system. The hydrophilic amino termini
of DGAT1 from mouse and oilseed rape had previously
been expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli
[18,19]. However, the full-length DGAT1 was not
expressed in E. coli previously because it is an integral
membrane protein with 8 putative membrane-spinning
domains using topology modeling [18-20], although
mice DGAT1 has only three transmembrane domains
using protease protections assays and indirect immunofluorescence in conjunction with selective permeabilization of cellular membranes [21]. In this study, the fulllength DGAT1 was fused to MBP at the amino terminus
and His-tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The
full-length DGAT1 was successfully expressed in E. coli
and it is possible that the fusion to MBP contributed to
the results, as MBP has been shown to increase the
solubility of target proteins such as human and mouse
TTP [1,4,22].
Purification of recombinant DGATs from any source
represents a challenge. Only a few studies in E. coli have
been directly related to the purification of recombinant
DGATs [6]. Expression of soluble peanut DGAT
(DGAT3, 42 kDa) in E. coli resulted in high levels of
DGAT activity and the formation of labeled TAG [12].
The recombinant N-terminal region of Brassica napus
DGAT1 (BnDGAT1(1-116)His6) was purified from E. coli
with a predicted molecular mass of 13,278 Da, which
was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry;
however, the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE
was doubled and the native size was four times of the
size of the monomer due to self-association. Full-length
DGAT1 was not successfully expressed in E. coli [18,20].
In the study herein, we engineered double affinity tags
for facilitating purification of recombinant DGAT1 from
E. coli. Recombinant DGAT1 was only partially purified
from the extract by either type of affinity beads or both
kinds of beads, probably due to extensive precipitation
(Figure 8). Preliminary attempts to measure the activity
of rDGAT1 using cold oleoyl-CoA and sn-1,2-diolein
did not result in visible TGA spot on TLC plates (data
not shown), probably due to the low sensitivity of cold
substrate. Further experiments are required to demonstrate the biological activity of rDGAT1 using radioactive oleoyl-CoA. Our current data, together with the
various published reports cited here, underline the tremendous challenges that exist for the purification of
recombinant full-length DGAT proteins.
Several lines of evidence support the assignment of
the full-length rDGAT1 on various immunoblots despite
the facts that MBP-TTP antibodies detected multiple
protein bands from soluble fraction, insoluble fraction,
membrane fraction, Ni-NTA and amylose resin affinity-

Cao et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/73

purified fractions, and detergent- and urea-solubilized
fractions. First, MBP-TTP antibodies have been wellcharacterized in a number of previous publications
which cross-react specifically with both MBP and TTP
[2,3,23-25]. Second, the detection of MBP by anti-MBPTTP antibodies [2,3] is identical to the commercial antiMBP antibodies [1]. Third, the size of the full-length
rDGAT1 on immunoblots corresponded to the calculated size of the protein. Fourth, affinity purification
with Ni-NTA beads based on the His-tag at the carboxyl
terminus of rDGAT1 resulted in the full-length
rDGAT1 being the most predominant band on the
immunoblots (Figures 5B, 6, 7B and 7D). These results
also suggest that the multiple lower molecular mass
bands on immunoblots are degradation products from
the carboxyl terminus of rDGAT1 because they were
detected in amylose resin affinity-purified protein samples (Figure 4) but not if any in Ni-NTA affinity-purified
protein samples (Figures 5B, 6, 7B and 7D). Finally, the
full-length rDGAT1 was partially digested by PreScission
protease resulting in the release of MBP in the soluble
fraction (Figure 8).
During the purification process, we observed several
lines of evidence that suggest rDGAT1 is directly or
indirectly associated with other proteins, lipids, and
plasma membranes. First, rDGAT1 is associated with E.
coli plasma membranes, because the majority of DGAT1
fusion protein was detected in the 100,000g plasma
membranes instead of the 100,000g cytosol (Figure 4C).
Second, the partially purified proteins eluted from affinity beads contained multiple proteins even after extensive washes (Figure 5A and 5C). Finally, the purified
protein samples appeared yellow in color. Gas chromatography confirmed that Ni-NTA purified rDGAT1 fraction contained fatty acids (data not shown). These
observations are in agreement with several previous
reports showing that DGAT is associated with lipids or
lipid bodies [9,26-28], lipid droplets of cultured mouse
adipocytes (equivalent to oil bodies in plant seeds) [29]
and ER membranes [10]. As a positive control for the
expression and purification experiments, the MBP fusion
partner was massively induced by IPTG in the same
type of E. coli and purified from the soluble fraction to
near homogeneity by a single step of amylose resin affinity chromatography. Therefore, the direct or indirect
association of rDGAT1 with other proteins, lipids, and
plasma membranes may explain why tandem affinity
beads were not effective in the purification of rDGAT1
to homogeneity.

Conclusions
The current study reports the first procedure for expressing the full-length recombinant DGAT1 from any species using a bacterial expression system. The results

Page 10 of 13

suggest that recombinant DGAT1 is extensively
degraded from the carboxyl terminus and is directly or
indirectly associated with other proteins, lipids, and
membranes. Although the protein was not purified to
homogeneity in the current study, the ability to express
full-length DGAT1 in E. coli could provide the basis for
future purification of the protein.

Methods
Bacterial expression plasmid construction

The plasmid pMBP-DGAT1-His was engineered to
express the full-length tung tree (Vernicia fordii) type 1
diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1, GenBank Accession No. DQ356680[10]) in E. coli protein expression
system. The recombinant protein MBP-DGAT1-His
(rDGAT1) contained MBP (maltose binding protein) at
the amino terminus and 6 histidine residues (His) at the
carboxyl terminus. Plasmid pMBP-hTTP, the cloning
vector, was reported previously [1]. Plasmid pMBPDGAT1-His was constructed by replacing the hTTP
fragment in plasmid pMBP-hTTP with the PCR-amplified DGAT1 fragment at the KpnI and SpeI sites (Figure
2A). A previously constructed DGAT1 plasmid was used
as the template for PCR amplification of the DGAT1
DNA open reading frame [10]. The DGAT1 forward
primer contained a KpnI/Asp718I restriction enzyme
recognition site followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site (5’-CTGTTTCAGGGTCCG-3’) [1] which
codes for 5 amino acid residues (LFQGP) between MBP
and DGAT1 protein sequences (Figure 2B). DGAT1
reverse primer contained sequence coding for a His-tag
(5’-ATGATGATGATGATGATG-3’) at the carboxyl terminus of the recombinant protein (Figure 2B). The plasmid construction was confirmed by restriction enzyme
digestion and DNA sequencing using the GenomeLab
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing-Quick Start Kit and
CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter).
The commercial plasmid pMAL-c2X (New England BioLabs) was used as an empty vector control for the
expression and purification of MBP fusion partner.
Expression of recombinant DGAT1 in E. coli

Plasmid pMBP-DGAT1-His was transformed into the E.
coli BL21(DE3) strain by electroporation. The optimum
conditions for rDGAT1 expression were as follows:
three separate single colonies were inoculated into
Luria-Bertani (LB)-tetracycline (15 μg/mL) medium (LBTet) and grown overnight with shaking at 37°C. The
overnight culture was inoculated at a 1:20 dilution into
fresh medium and grown for about 4 h at 37°C to reach
an optical cell density of approximately 0.6-1.0 at OD600
nm. Isopropylthio-b-D-galactoside (IPTG) was added to
the culture medium (0.5 mM final concentration) and
protein expression was induced at 25°C for up to 4 h, or

Cao et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/73

in control experiments they were left uninduced for 2 h.
Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000g for 10
min and homogenized by sonication in homogenization
buffer (3-4 mL/g wet cells) containing amylose resin
wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl,
10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA) or nickelnitrilotriacetic agarose (Ni-NTA agarose from Qiagen)
resin wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 300 mM
NaCl, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Tween-20),
plus 0.2-1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
and 1:100-1:500 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma, cat #P8340). The homogenate was centrifuged
at 2,000g for 10 min to remove cell debris and the
resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10
min to remove inclusion bodies and protein aggregates
[30,31]. The supernatant and the pellet were evaluated
for the expression levels and solubility of rDGAT1.
Purification of recombinant DGAT1 with Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography

The rDGAT1 was partially purified from E. coli by batch
method from the 10,000g supernatant using Ni-NTA
beads according to similar procedures [2]. The 10,000g
supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen).
The mixtures were incubated at 4°C with rotation for 3
h followed by centrifugation at 1,000g for 5 min. The
beads were washed five times each with 5 bead-volume
of Ni-NTA resin wash buffer. The bound proteins were
eluted from the beads by gravity flow in a Bio-Rad minicolumn with increasing concentrations of imidazole
(Sigma) in Ni-NTA wash buffer.
Purification of recombinant DGAT1 with amylose resin
affinity chromatography

The rDGAT1 was subjected to purification with an amylose resin affinity column (MBPTrap HP column, GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). This
system had previously been used for purification of MBPTTP and MBP-ZFP36L1 fusion proteins [1,2,4]. The
10,000g supernatant or the partially purified rDGAT1
from Ni-NTA batch purification was loaded onto the column. The column was washed with 5 bed-volume of
amylose resin wash buffer and then eluted with 10 bedvolume of amylose resin elution buffer (20 mM maltose
in amylose resin wash buffer) followed by 0.5 M NaOH
wash of the column. MBP was also affinity-purified from
E. coli transformed with plasmid pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs) by amylose resin affinity chromatography
and used as a control in the experiments [2].
Localization of recombinant DGAT1 in E. coli

E. coli cells were homogenized by sonication as
described above. The homogenate was sequentially

Page 11 of 13

centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 min and 10,000g for 20
min. The 10,000g supernatant (2 mL) was subjected to
100,000g centrifugation to generate the cytosol and
plasma membrane pellet [32]. The 100,000g pellets were
suspended in 0.2 mL membrane suspension buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 M
sucrose. Anti-MBP-hTTP antibodies were used to identify rDGAT1 in various fractions.
Purification of recombinant DGAT1 from detergentsolubilized E. coli pellets

Cellular fractionation studies indicated that rDGAT1
could be recovered from the 10,000g and 25,000g pellet.
Therefore, the pellets were suspended in Ni-NTA sonication buffer and used for detergent solubilization at 4°
C for 1 h with 0.5% of detergents: Brij 35 (Aldrich Chemical Corp.), CHAPS (Sigma), NP-40 (Sigma), SDS
(Fisher), Triton X-100 (International Biotechnologies
Inc.), Tween 20 and Tween 80 (Sigma). The pellets were
further solubilized at 4°C for 1 h by various concentrations of SDS (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1%), Triton X-100 (0.12%), and urea (2-6 M). The solubilization mixtures were
centrifuged at 20,000-50,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for rDGAT1 detection and purification
with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described
above.
PreScission protease digestion of recombinant DGAT1

PreScission protease digestion was performed to confirm
the identity of the full-length rDGAT1 according to a
previous protocol [1]. Briefly, rDGAT1 purified by NiNTA affinity chromatography (Figure 5A) was mixed
with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
The digestion mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight with shaking followed by centrifugation
at 10,000g. Equivalent amounts of protein in the undigested, the supernatant and pellet of the digestion mixtures were separated with 4-20% SDS-PAGE and
detected with anti-MBP-mTTP antibodies.
Protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting

Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method using the Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) following 0.5 M NaOH
treatment of the protein samples [33]. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE (10%, 15%, or 4-20%) and
visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue
(Sigma) or silver staining reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
[2]. DGAT1 fusion protein was detected by immunoblotting following previously described procedures using
nitrocellulose membranes and SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) [2,33]. The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-MBP-hTTP antibodies
[2] and anti-MBP-mTTP antibodies [3], as well as the

commercial anti-MBP antibodies (New England BioLabs). The secondary antibodies were affinity-purified
goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (GAR-HRP) with human IgG absorbed (Bio-Rad
Laboratory).
