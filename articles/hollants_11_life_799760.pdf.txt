Life without a cell membrane: Challenging the
specificity of bacterial endophytes within Bryopsis
(Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta)
Joke Hollants1,2*, Helen Decleyre1, Frederik Leliaert2, Olivier De Clerck2 and Anne Willems1

Abstract
Background: The siphonous green macroalga Bryopsis has some remarkable characteristics. Besides hosting a rich
endophytic bacterial flora, Bryopsis also displays extraordinary wound repair and propagation mechanisms. This
latter feature includes the formation of protoplasts which can survive in the absence of a cell membrane for
several minutes before regenerating into new individuals. This transient ‘life without a membrane’ state, however,
challenges the specificity of the endophytic bacterial communities present and raises the question whether these
bacteria are generalists, which are repeatedly acquired from the environment, or if there is some specificity
towards the Bryopsis host.
Results: To answer this question, we examined the temporal stability and the uniqueness of endobiotic bacterial
communities within Bryopsis samples from the Mexican west coast after prolonged cultivation. DGGE analysis
revealed that Bryopsis endophytic bacterial communities are rather stable and clearly distinct from the epiphytic
and surrounding cultivation water bacterial communities. Although these endogenous communities consist of
both facultative and obligate bacteria, results suggest that Bryopsis owns some intrinsic mechanisms to selectively
maintain and/or attract specific bacteria after repeated wounding events in culture.
Conclusions: This suggests that Bryopsis algae seem to master transient stages of life without a cell membrane
well as they harbor specific - and possibly ecological significant - endophytic bacteria.

Background
The marine green alga Bryopsis has long been suspected
to harbor endogenous bacteria. These intracellular bacteria have been repeatedly observed in the cytoplasm as
well as vacuolar regions of algal thalli and gametes by
electron microscopy [[1,2] and personal observations see
additional file 1], suggesting the presence of bacterial
endophytes within Bryopsis is a natural phenomenon.
Recently, the first insights were provided into the identity and diversity of these bacterial endophytes within
two Bryopsis species from the Pacific Mexican coast [3].
Full length 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the
Bryopsis endophytic bacterial communities are quite low
in diversity (i.e. only 7 bacterial OTUs detected) but taxonomically wide-ranging with the presence of

Arcobacter, Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteriaceae, Mycoplasma, Labrenzia, Phyllobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae species. Moreover, the same Bacteroidetes,
Mycoplasma, Phyllobacteriaceae, and in particular Flavobacteriaceae bacteria, were detected in several Bryopsis
samples collected hundreds of kilometers apart. This
apparent spatial stability of the Bryopsis-bacterial endobiosis, however, raises the question whether these endophytes are a subset of the free-living bacterial
community or whether there is some specificity towards
the Bryopsis host. Although the distinctiveness between
free-living and macroalgal-associated bacterial communities is well established [4-8], the extraordinary morphological and physiological characteristics of the
Bryopsis host must have implications for the specificity
of its bacterial endophytes. Bryopsis is a marine siphonous macroalga composed of a single, tubular shaped
cell which contains multiple nuclei and chloroplasts in a
thin cytoplasmic layer surrounding a large central

vacuole [9]. While an organism composed of a giant,
single cell would be prone to damage, siphonous macroalgae possess an intricate defense network that operates
at various levels [7,10]. In Bryopsis, for example, the
metabolite kahalalide F, which shows in vitro therapeutic activities, protects the alga from fish predation [11].
Even if damage does occur, a complex, multistep wound
response is triggered [10,12] to which Bryopsis algae add
a surprisingly feature, i.e. the formation of protoplasts
[13]. These protoplasts are membraneless structures that
can survive in seawater for 10-20 minutes. Subsequently,
membranes and a cell wall are synthesized de novo surrounding each protoplast, which then develop into new
Bryopsis plants. This not only suggests Bryopsis can
exist - at least transiently -without a cell membrane, it
also questions the nature of the association between the
algal host and the endophytic bacterial communities
present. Are these bacteria Bryopsis-specific, obligate
endophytes (specialists) or are they rather generalists
(facultative endogenous bacteria) which are repeatedly
acquired from the local environment (epiphytic communities and/or surrounding sea water)?
To address this issue, we evaluated the temporal stability of the endobiotic bacterial communities after prolonged cultivation of Bryopsis isolates. We also
examined the diversity of the epiphytic and surrounding
water bacterial communities of five Bryopsis isolates in
culture using the DGGE technique and subsequently
compared these DGGE profiles with previously obtained
DGGE banding patterns of Bryopsis endophytic bacterial
communities [3].

Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction

Bryopsis hypnoides (MX19 and MX263) and Bryopsis
pennata var. leprieurii individuals (MX90, MX164 and
MX344) were collected in February 2009 at five different
sites along the Mexican west coast [3]. Living algal samples were transferred to the laboratory and unialgal
Bryopsis cultures were formed by repeatedly isolating
clean apical fragments. To preserve these unialgal cultures, apical fragments were monthly transferred to
fresh sterile 1 × modified Provasoli enriched seawater
[14]. All unialgal Bryopsis cultures were maintained in
the laboratory at 23°C under a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle
with light intensities of 25-30 μE m-2s-1.
One year after the first endophytic community screening [3], all five Bryopsis MX samples were resubmitted
to a total surface sterilization [15] and DNA extraction
[16] in October 2010 to evaluate the temporal stability
of the endophytic bacterial communities after prolonged
cultivation. To address the specificity of the Bryopsisbacterial endobiosis in culture, 50 ml of 30 day old cultivation water was collected from each Bryopsis MX

culture that had been cultivated for two years (i.e. in
February 2011). These cultivation water samples were
serially filtered over a syringe filter holder with sterile
11 μm and 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filters (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) to remove small Bryopsis
fragments and to retain the planktonic microbial fraction, respectively. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the
0.2 μm filters using the bead-beating method followed
by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation as
described by Zwart et al. [17]. Parallel with these cultivation water samples, washing water samples were
obtained from all five MX isolates by repeatedly vortexing the algae in 50 ml sterile artificial seawater (ASW).
These washing water samples, containing the loosely
Bryopsis-associated bacterial fraction, were processed as
described above. Subsequently, approximately 1 gram of
each washed Bryopsis MX sample was placed in 500 μl
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) lysis buffer
supplemented with 20 mg.mL-1 proteinase K and 2.5 μl
filter-sterilized Umonium Master (Huckert’s International, Belgium) to eliminate the epiphytic bacterial fraction from the Bryopsis surface [15]. Samples were
incubated for 30 minutes at 60°C and subsequently vortexed in 500 μl sterile ASW for 2 minutes. Algal material was removed by centrifugation and the
supernatants’ DNA originated from the epiphytic bacterial fraction was extracted using a CTAB protocol modified from Doyle and Doyle [16].
DGGE and sequence analysis

The endophytic (EN-2010), epiphytic (EP), washing
water (WW) and cultivation water (CW) bacterial community extracts were subjected to a nested-PCR DGGE
approach. First, full length 16S rRNA gene amplification
was carried out with the universal bacterial primers
27F/1492R following the protocol outlined in Lane [18].
PCR amplicons were purified using a Nucleofast 96 PCR
clean up membrane system (Machery-Nagel, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subsequently submitted to a second PCR with primer pair
F357-GC/R518 targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA
gene. The latter amplification reaction and subsequent
DGGE analysis were carried out as previously described
[15], with a denaturing gradient of 45-65%. DGGE banding patterns were normalized using BioNumerics 5.1
software (Applied Maths, Belgium). As standard, a marker containing the V3 16S rRNA gene fragments of all
bacterial endophyte and chloroplast OTUs formerly
obtained from the five Bryopsis MX samples [3] was
used (see additional file 2). The temporal stability of the
endophytic communities was explored by visually comparing the normalized endophytic community profiles of
MX sample’s DNA extracts made in October 2009 (EN2009) versus October 2010 (EN-2010). To study the

specificity of the Bryopsis-bacterial endobiosis, normalized EP, WW and CW bacterial community profiles of
each Bryopsis sample were comparatively clustered with
previously obtained endophytic (EN-2009) DGGE banding patterns [15] using Dice similarity coefficients. A
dendrogram was composed using the Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) algorithm in BioNumerics to determine the similarity
between the EP, WW, CW and EN-2009 samples. The
similarity matrix generated was also used for constructing a multidimensional scaling (MDS) diagram in BioNumerics. MDS is a powerful data reducing method
which reduces each complex DGGE fingerprint into one
point in a 3D space in a way that more similar samples
are plotted closer together [19]. Additionally, EP, WW
and CW DGGE bands at positions of endophytic
(including chloroplast) marker bands were excised,
sequenced and identified as described by Hollants et al.
[3]. To verify their true correspondence with Bryopsis
endophytes, excised bands’ sequences were aligned and
clustered with previously obtained endophytic bacterial
sequences [3] using BioNumerics. Excised DGGE bands’
V3 16S rRNA gene sequences were submitted to EMBL
under accession numbers :HE599189-HE599213.

Results

DGGE fingerprint cluster analysis: inside ≠ outside

DGGE cluster analysis showed that the endophytic (EN)
banding patterns were significantly different from the
epiphytic (EP), washing water (WW) and cultivation
water (CW) community profiles of all five MX Bryopsis
cultures studied. In the dendrogram (Figure 2), the cluster containing the EP, WW and CW community profiles
is clearly separated from the endophytic banding patterns (indicated in bold, Figure 2). Also the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot (Figure 3A), which reduces
the complex DGGE patterns to one point per sample,
shows that the EN samples (right) are clearly apart from
the epiphytic and surrounding water samples (left).

The endophytic bacterial communities showed little
time variability after prolonged cultivation when visually
comparing the normalized EN-2009 and EN-2010
DGGE fingerprints (Figure 1). The band patterns of the
different MX90, MX263 and MX344 endophytic extracts
were highly similar, whereas Bryopsis samples MX19
and 164 showed visible differences between the community profiles of their EN-2009 and EN-2010 DNA
extracts. Both the MX19 and MX164 sample had lost
the DGGE band representing the Phyllobacteriaceae
endophytes (black boxes in Figure 1) after one year of
cultivation.

(reduced into one point in the plot) of Bryopsis samples MX19, MX90, MX164, MX263 and MX344, respectively.

Besides this, the MDS diagram showed that the EN
samples did not cluster together and are distributed
over the y-axis of the three-dimensional plot (Figure
3A), while the EP, WW and CW samples were more or
less grouped per Bryopsis MX sample (Figure 3B).
Within one Bryopsis sample EP-WW-CW cluster (clusters 1-5, Figure 3B), however, no general grouping mode
can be observed. Whereas the epiphytic community
samples within clusters 2, 3 and 4 (representing Bryopsis
samples MX90, MX164 and MX263) were more apart
from their corresponding WW and CW samples, this
was not the case for clusters 1 and 5 (i.e. Bryopsis cultures MX19 and MX344). These observations corresponded to the results of the cluster analysis of all
DGGE patterns (Figure 2). In addition, Figure 2 also
shows a much larger diversity of DGGE bands in all epiphytic and surrounding water samples in comparison
with the endophytic DGGE profiles.

DGGE band cluster analysis: inside ≈ outside

Although the community fingerprints of all EP, WW
and CW samples were distinct from the EN community
profiles, some overlap was noticeable between individual
bands from the EP, WW and CW DGGE profiles and
the EN (including chloroplast) marker bands. To examine this potential overlap, EP, WW and CW DGGE
bands at positions of marker bands (Figure 4, bands 127) were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and
sequenced. Table 1 outlines the excised bands’ taxonomic identification and their phylogenetic affiliation.
The last column in Table 1 shows the correlation (positive+ or negative-) between the position of a certain EP,
WW or CW DGGE band towards the marker bands
and its sequence identification. From this column we
can deduce that most bands at positions of marker
bands M1m, M2, M8 and M10 showed sequences that
matched those of the marker bands and were thus identified as Mycoplasma, Arcobacter, Phyllobacteriaceae
and Labrenzia species, respectively. All EP, WW or CW
bands at the height of Bacteroidetes (M1b), chloroplast
(M3 and M4), Flavobacteriaceae (M5-7) and Xanthomonadaceae (M9) marker bands, however, showed a mismatch. Instead of being related to Bryopsis endophytic
bacterial sequences, these latter band sequences were
affiliated with Alphaproteobacterial (Caulobacterales,
Rhizobiales and Sneathiellales), Gammaproteobacterial
(Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales) and Acanthopleuribacterales sequences (see Table 1). To validate the
true correspondence of excised EP, WW and CW bands
with endophytic sequences, band sequences were clustered with previously obtained endophytic bacterial full
length 16S rRNA gene sequences [3]. The UPGMA dendrogram (Figure 5) confirms that every one of the positively related bands (indicated with +) was highly similar

This dendrogram illustrates that Arcobacter, Labrenzia,
Mycoplasma and Phyllobacteriaceae endogenous
sequences are also present in the epiphytic, washing
water and/or cultivation water bacterial communities of
Bryopsis cultures, whereas Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae sequences were strictly
endogenous. In addition, Arcobacter and Mycoplasma
sequences were only present in the EP, WW and/or
CW bacterial communities of those Bryopsis MX samples in which they are also endogenously present. Labrenzia and Phyllobacteriaceae sequences, on the other
hand, were also found in the EP, WW and/or CW bacterial communities of algal samples in which these species were not identified as being endophytic.

Discussion
The existence of highly specific macroalgal-bacterial
associations is no longer doubted [7]. Various studies
revealed that bacterial communities living on macroalgae clearly differ from those occurring in the

surrounding seawater [4,5,8,20]. These studies, however,
focused on the distinctiveness of the epiphytic bacterial
communities from the free-living environmental communities and never studied the specificity of the endophytic bacteria associated with macroalgae. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the temporal
variability of the endogenous (EN) bacterial communities of Bryopsis isolates and their distinctiveness from
the epiphytic (EP) and surrounding water (WW and
CW) bacterial communities after prolonged cultivation
using the DGGE technique. Taken the inherent limitations of the DGGE technique into account [21], we
observed that the endophytic bacterial community profiles were notably different from the fingerprints of bacterial communities on and surrounding Bryopsis
cultures. DGGE fingerprint cluster analysis (Figure 2)
and MDS (Figure 3) clearly indicate that the epiphytic
and surrounding water samples in all Bryopsis cultures
were more similar to each other than to their corresponding endophytic community profile. This suggests
the existence of specialized endophytic bacterial communities within Bryopsis algae which are clearly distinct
from the outer surface and environmental bacterial
communities. This apparent specificity is supported by
the observation that Bryopsis harbors rather stable endophytic bacterial communities, which showed little time
variability after one year cultivation of the algal samples
(Figure 1). However, examination of individual DGGE
bands did reveal some similarities between intra- and
extracellular bacteria. While Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae species seemed exclusively endobiotic, sequence cluster analysis confirmed
that Arcobacter, Labrenzia, Mycoplasma and Phyllobacteriaceae endophytes were also present in the epiphytic,
washing water and/or cultivation water extracts. This
latter observation is consistent with the outcome of a
study conducted by Maki et al. [22] which revealed
similar intracellular and extracellular bacterial populations in and on the harmful marine microalga Heterocapsa circularisquama in culture.
Although the Bryopsis cultures used in this study have
been kept in the laboratory for almost three years due
to experimental restrictions [3], our data allow us to put
forward some hypotheses regarding the nature of the
endophytic communities within natural Bryopsis populations. Whereas we cannot rule out selection by artificial
laboratory growth conditions, Arcobacter, Labrenzia,
Mycoplasma and Phyllobacteriaceae endophytes can at
least survive without the Bryopsis host, suggesting they
might be facultative endogenous bacteria which are
acquired from the local environment. This is consistent
with the general perception that most plant endophytes
originate from the surrounding environment and the
outer
plant
surface
[23,24].
Bacteroidetes,

Flavobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae endophytes,
on the other hand, appear well adapted to an endobiotic
lifestyle as they persist within the Bryopsis interior after
prolonged cultivation. Especially Flavobacteriaceae endophytes, which are present in all five MX samples collected hundreds of kilometres apart, might be obligate
endophytes which are strictly dependent on the Bryopsis
host for their growth and survival. This co-occurrence
of multiple facultative and obligate bacterial endophytes
is also well documented in many land plant and insect
hosts [23,25].
Furthermore, the Bryopsis endophytic communities
seem also rather specific as the EP, WW and CW
extracts contained numerous Alphaproteobacterial,
Gammaproteobacterial and Acanthopleuribacterales species which are not present in the EN samples. This
apparent specificity is confirmed by our observations
that EP, WW, CW (data not shown) and EN (see Figure
1) extracts made at different time points revealed largely
consistent banding patterns even after the algal specimens were repeatedly wounded and transferred to fresh,
sterile cultivation medium (see material and methods
section). Consequently, the Bryopsis host seems able to
selectively maintain its endophytic flora and/or to attract
specific facultative endophytes after wounding. Although
this may be the result of more general physiological and
biochemical processes [7], the characteristic properties
of Bryopsis might also contribute to this selectiveness.
An interesting characteristic of Bryopsis is that following
cell wounding, the protoplasm can aggregate and regenerate into a mature individual. This process involves a
transient state of membrane-free protoplasts in seawater
[13]. Although this transient ‘life without a membrane’
state might seem anything but selective, Klotchkova and
coworkers [26] showed that an incompatibility barrier is
present during protoplast formation to exclude foreign
inorganic particles or alien cell components. Only some
chosen cells or particles could be incorporated into
Bryopsis protoplasts. Moreover, the lectins which play a
key role in the aggregation process during protoplast
formation [27-30] might actually be ‘specificity mediators’. The description of the Bryopsis specific lectin
Bryohealin by Kim et al. [29], which contains an antibiotic domain that protects the newly generated protoplasts
from bacterial contamination [30], supports this hypothesis. Lectins are known symbiosis mediators in, for
example, legume-rhizobia and sponge-bacterial symbioses [31,32].
Besides the endophytic bacterial communities, also the
epiphytic and the surrounding cultivation water bacterial
communities seemed unique to each Bryopsis culture as
the EP, WW and CW fingerprints of a given Bryopsis
sample clearly clustered together. This is consistent with
the general perception of highly specific macroalgal-

bacterial interactions as discussed above [7]. Additionally, since all five Bryopsis cultures were maintained
under similar laboratory conditions, the above observation suggests that factors other than cultivation conditions contributed to the observed specificity (see
Material and methods section).

Conclusion
Our results indicate that Bryopsis samples harbor specific and rather stable endophytic bacterial communities
after prolonged cultivation which are clearly distinct
from the epiphytic and surrounding cultivation water
bacterial communities. Even though Bryopsis algae are
repeatedly being exposed to a mix of marine bacteria,
they seem to selectively maintain and/or attract their
endophytes after repeated wounding events in culture.
Despite the limitations of the experimental design, this
indicates that Bryopsis has some intrinsic mechanisms
to favour the entry of certain bacteria of possible ecological importance within its cell, suggesting macroalgalbacterial endobioses might be as or even more specific
than macroalgal-epiphytic bacterial associations. The use
of species-specific primers and probes may open the
way to investigate the specificity, both spatially and temporally, of the endophytic communities in natural
Bryopsis populations.
