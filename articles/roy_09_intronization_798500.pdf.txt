Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic pre-mRNA gene transcripts are processed by the spliceosome to
remove portions of the transcript, called spliceosomal introns. The spliceosome recognizes intron
boundaries by the presence of sequence signals (motifs) contained in the actual transcript, thus
sequence changes in the genome that affect existing splicing signals or create new signals may lead
to changes in transcript splicing patterns. Such changes may lead to previously excluded (intronic)
transcript regions being included (exonic) or vice versa. Such changes can affect the encoded
protein sequence and/or post-transcriptional regulation, and are thus a potentially important
source of genomic and phenotypic novelty. Two recent papers suggest that such changes may be a
major force in remodeling of eukaryotic gene structures, however the rate of occurrence of such
changes has not been assessed at the genomic level.
Results: I studied four closely related species of Cryptoccocus fungi. Among 28,256 studied introns,
canonical GT/C...AG boundaries are nearly universally conserved across all four species. Among
only 40 observed cases of cDNA-confirmed non-conserved intron boundaries, most are likely to
involve alternative splicing. I find only five cases of "intronization," intron creation from an internal
exonic region by de novo emergence of new splicing boundaries, and no cases of the reverse
process, "de-intronization." I find no more than ten clear cases of true movement of an intron
boundary of a possibly constitutively spliced intron, and no clear cases of true "intron sliding," in
which changes in the positions of both intron boundaries could lead to a movement of the intron
position along the coding sequence.
Conclusion: These results suggest that intronization, de-intronization, and intron boundary
movement are rare events in evolution.

Background
The spliceosome is a large RNA-protein complex that
processes pre-mRNA transcripts to remove some regions
of transcripts, called spliceosomal introns (hereafter simply 'introns'; included regions are called 'exons'). Some
genes exhibit alternative splicing, with some genic regions
being included in some but not all mRNA transcripts [1].

Intron-exon structures also change through evolutionary
time [2]. Changes can occur either by gain or loss of a
large amount of genomic sequence (for instance by complete or nearly complete loss of one or more complete
intron or exon; [3-8]), or by the evolution of new splicing
patterns for existing sequence due to small-scale sequence
changes ([9,10]; more complex cases are also possible).

Intron-exon structures can change due to large-scale gain/
loss of sequence in several ways. Precise loss of an intronic
sequence can occur by genomic recombination with a
reverse transcribed mRNA [3-5]. Introns or exons can also
be lost by exact or inexact genomic deletion, leading to
loss of splicing in that region [11,12]. Exons, and conceivably introns, can arise by insertion of a transposable element or by tandem duplication of a genic region [10,1317].
Smaller-scale sequence changes may also lead to changes
in intron-exon structure, with formerly exonic sequence
becoming intronic or vice-versa. Transcript splicing patterns are determined by generally short sequence motifs,
including intron boundary motifs (minimally a 5' GT/C
and a 3' AG) and an internal 'branch point' motif which
plays a key role in the splicing reaction (typically TNA,
where N is any nucleotide), as well as various more diffuse
intronic and exonic sequence signals [18]. As such, smallscale mutations may either disrupt splicing signals or create cryptic splicing signals, leading to changes in splicing
patterns, converting formerly intronic sequence into
exonic sequence or vice versa [19-22].
Such sequence changes can increase or decrease the total
number of introns/exons in the gene, or simply change
the position of an existing splicing boundary. Intron/exon
number can increase by emergence of new splice boundaries, either (i) within an intron, leading to 'exonization' of
an internal portion of an intron (studied extensively previously, see for instance reference 12); or (ii) within an
exon, leading to 'intronization' of an internal portion of
an exon [9,23]. Intron/exon number can decrease by (i)
loss of splicing of an intron ('de-intronization,' converting
an intron into an internal portion of an exon; [9]); or (ii)
loss of splicing of an exon ('de-exonization,' converting an
exon into an internal portion of an intron). Alternatively,
specific sequence changes can affect boundaries of existing introns, leading to movement of intron-exon boundaries along the sequence, converting sequence near
intron-exon boundaries from exonic to intronic, or vice
versa.
Recently, two sets of authors suggested that sequence
changes leading to changes in splicing patterns could be
important forces in the evolutionary remodeling of
eukaryotic gene structures. First, Tarrio-Rodriguez et al.
[22] presented a model by which the boundaries of an
intron could migrate along a gene by compensatory
changes at both ends of the intron, with alternative use of
ancestral and new boundaries providing a viable evolutionary intermediate. They suggested that such 'intron
sliding' events could be a major contributor to the
observed diversity of intron positions among eukaryotic
homologs [2,4,6,7]. Second, Catania and Lynch [23]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/192

argued that intronization could be a major force in the
shaping of gene structures. However, the actual evolutionary rates at which intronic sequence becomes exonic and
vice versa remain unknown.
In order to understand tempo and mode of evolution of
intron boundaries, I studied four-species genomic alignments of Cryptococcus neoformans species (Figure 1; [24]).
Unlike ascomycetous fungi, Cryptococcus genes are very
intron-rich, and show considerable alternative splicing
[25,26], and thus are of interest in comparing and contrasting with the better-studied intron-rich genomes of
animals and plants. Several studies focusing on these species have elucidated the evolution of intron-exon structures in this group. It has previously been shown that
intron loss and gain by insertion/deletion of a complete
or near-complete intronic sequence from the genome is a
very rare event among these species [27,28]. Myself and
others studied introns in the untranslated regions of transcripts, and found a high level of conservation of splicing
boundaries both upsteam and downstream of the coding
region, indicating the action of purifying selection in
maintaining splicing in non-coding regions [29]. Hughes
et al. studied indels within Cryptococcus introns, and
reported evidence for selection driving introns towards an
optimum length [24]. Other insights come from more
phylogenetically broad many-species studies. Warnecke et
al. showed skewed amino acid usage near intron-exon
boundaries in Cryptococcus, suggesting that splicing in
Cryptococcus, as in animals and plants, makes use of socalled exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing
silencers. In their study of transcript variation across
eukaryotes, McGuire et al. [26] showed that alternative
splicing in Cryptococcus is dominated by intron-retention
events (in which the entire sequence that is spliced out of
one transcript of a gene is entirely retained in another
transcript).
I studied genomic regions corresponding to cDNA-confirmed introns in the reference species JEC21, previously
studied by Hughes et al. [24]. Intron boundaries are
almost universally conserved, with the GT..AG intron
boundaries retained across all four species for 99.9% of
introns studied. Among the 40 introns for which boundaries are not conserved, only ten are likely cases of change
of a constitutive boundary; other cases are consistent with
alternative splicing. I find only five apparent cases of
intronization, and no cases of de-intronization. Thus
changes of intron-exon structures by small-scale sequence
changes may be rare events in evolution.

sponding regions from three other Cryptococcus species
(Figure 1; [24]). I found only 40 cDNA-confirmed introns
in which GT/C...AG boundaries were not preserved in the
corresponding position across all species (see Methods).
Thus, roughly 99.9% of intron boundaries examined here
are conserved across the entire clade.
Introns with boundary changes
The 40 observed exceptions are summarized in Table 1. In
24/40 cases, the non-conserved JEC21 intron boundary
falls within 9 bp of a possible alternative in frame boundary (that is, an GT or AG), such that each species has at
least one potential splicing boundary (Figure 2). In 14/24
of these cases, the alternative boundary is conserved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/192

across all four species (e.g., Figure 2a). This pattern is consistent with usage of alternative boundaries in JEC21
(supported by cDNA evidence for usage of alternative
boundaries in 4 cases), and with usage of only a single
boundary in some relatives. Given the large number of
cases examined, and the small number of available ESTs
per gene, it remains possible that the evolutionarily conserved boundary is in fact the more commonly used splice
site in JEC21 as well.
In the other ten cases, the in frame candidate alternative
boundary is not conserved across all four species, however
the sequence appears to be intronic across species: the
sequence interrupts the coding frame and/or exhibits
indel frameshift mutations between species, strongly suggesting that the region is spliced across all four species
(e.g., Figure 2b). These are candidates for true boundary
movement, in which different species constitutively utilize different sites for intron splicing.
I also uncovered five apparent examples of 'intronization'
[9,23] in which an internal portion of an exon is converted to a new intron by acquisition of splicing boundaries (Figure 3). In each case, only JEC21 exhibits GT...AG
splicing boundaries; in 4/5 cases, cDNA evidence indicated that the intronic sequence was alternatively spliced
(i.e., 'intron retention' – cDNAs were found both containing and lacking the intronic sequence). Consistent with
the ancestral exonic character of the sequence, coding
frame and amino acid sequence encoded were highly conserved across species within these regions, and all new
introns were a multiple of 3 nts, thus conserving coding

frame (Figure 3). In addition, I found two cases with conserved coding frame and amino acid sequence within the
spliced region, in which the JEC21 splicing boundaries
were shared with one other species. In one case (Figure
4A), H99 also shares the JEC21 splicing boundaries, consistent with either intronization in the H99-JEC21 ancestor, or ancestral alternative splicing and loss of splicing in
the R265-WM276 ancestor (de-intronization). In the
other case, splicing boundaries are present only in JEC21
and the more distant relative, consistent with either convergent gain or loss of splicing (Figure 4B).
In the remaining cases, the utilized intron boundaries in
JEC21 were absent in some of the other three species,
without nearby candidates for alternative splicing boundaries, however the high observed degree of evolutionary
change within the sequence, generally including
frameshift-causing indels, suggested that the sequence
was ancestrally intronic. These are possible examples of
long-range changes in intron boundaries within the clade.
In addition, in some cases long indels overlapping the
intron/exon boundaries attested to more profound rearrangements of gene and intron-exon structures. An example of such a complex change are given in Figure 4C.
No de-intronization
Intronization is the conversion of a single exon into two
exons and an intervening intron. What of the reverse process, 'de-intronization,' with loss of intron splicing converting two exons and an intervening intron into a single long
exon? (It is worth distinguishing de-intronization from
exonization, in which an internal portion of an intron,
but not the whole intron, becomes exonic.) Could some
of the above 'complex' cases represent de-intronization
events? In de-intronization, newly exonic sequence would
be expected to respect coding frame – thus in all species
without splicing boundaries the corresponding regions
would expected to be a multiple of three basepairs and to
lack in frame stop codons. This pattern is not found for
any of the complex cases (Table 1), thus there are no clear
candidates for de-intronization events.
Features of boundary changes
Among the 40 introns with changed boundaries, five
introns exhibited changes at both boundaries, and 35 had
changes at only one. 3' changes were much more common, with 83% (29/35) of changes at the 3' boundary (P
= 5.8 × 10-5 by a binomial test for equal probabilities). In
66% (24/35) of cases, there was a candidate alternative in
frame boundary (GT or AG) within 9 nts of the JEC21
boundary position (and one case of an alternative boundary 12 nt away), and many of these alternative boundaries
had extended consensus sequences (i.e., a 5' GT/CRAG or
3' YAG; Table 1). The difference in numbers of non-conserved 5' and 3' boundaries may be understood in this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/192

context: given the greater information content to 5'
boundaries (with an extended GTRAGT consensus), truly
alternative 5' boundaries are less likely to occur at random, thus loss of an ancestral boundary is less likely to be
compensated by an alternative boundary.
Alternative boundaries were slightly but not significantly
more likely to fall downstream of the JEC21 boundary ('+'
changes Table 1; 16/25 in all; P = 0.12) for both 5' changes
(4/5) and 3' changes (12/20). Use of the alternative
boundary was observed (i.e. alternative splicing) for 4 out
of 15 cases for which multiple spliced cDNA transcripts
were available, and an additional out-of-frame 3' boundary was found to have been used in a single cDNA for one
additional case. In addition, cDNAs with the intron
sequence retained were found in 2/25 cases (Table 1).
I compared the 40 introns with observed boundary
sequence changes with 10,000 randomly generated sets of
40 introns chosen from among all JEC21 introns. Introns
undergoing changes were longer than expected (only 252
sets had greater or equal mean length: P = 0.025), and
showed weaker overall adherence to 5' boundary consensus (average number of matches to the GTRAGT consensus was lower than for all but 96 random sets: P = 0.096).
The difference was not significant when intronic sequence
positions were considered separately, except for the sixth
position, at which introns undergoing changes were less
likely to contain a consensus T than expected, at a P =
0.017 level, correcting for multiple comparisons.

Discussion
No intron sliding or de-intronization
Intron positions often differ across conserved regions of
homologs, attesting to evolutionary plasticity of intronexon structures. Here I study three possible contributing
mechanisms to this remodeling of gene structures: intron
sliding [22,30,31], by which an intron may migrate a
short distance along a gene, for instance by sequential
changes of intron boundaries facilitated by alternative
splicing [22]; intronization, conversion of an internal portion of an exon into a new intron); and de-intronization,
loss of splicing of an intron. This study is the first to systematically evaluate the incidence of such events among
species that are closely related enough to confidently infer
sequence changes. I found only five cases of intronization
and no cases of intron sliding or de-intronization. The
excess of intronization over de-intronization echoes the
case in Caenorhabditis nematodes found in our previous
study [9], and contrasts with the excess of intron loss (by
loss of the actual intron sequence) over insertion of new
introns in the same species studied here [27].

The lack of de-intronization is striking. In the Cryptococcus
genome, approximately 6.2% of intron sequences do not

Complex cases of intron boundary evolution
Complex cases of intron boundary evolution. A. Intron 5 of CNM00170. Both boundaries of the intron in JEC21 are
non-conserved, however the presence of gaps inducing frameshifts suggests that the region is intronic across all species. B.
Intron 1 of CND00470. Only WM276 shares the JEC21 5' intron boundary, suggesting either convergent intronization in
JEC21 and WM276 or convergent loss of splicing in the other two species. C. Intron 5 of CNM00170. The 5' intron boundary
is not conserved, and there is no nearby alternative candidate boundary, however the presence of coding frame-interrupting
indels suggests that the sequence is ancestrally intronic.

interrupt coding frame. These non-frame-interrupting
introns have a mean of 63.3 bp, thus loss of splicing of
any of these introns would amount to an insertion of 21
codons on average. Using the estimated dS (0.46) as an
estimate of the amount of mutation within the history of
these species, 0.46 × 4 changes interrupting the canonical
GT/C..AG splicing boundaries would be expected per
intron in the history of these species, or a total number of
splicing interrupting mutations equal to 28,256 introns ×
6.2% × 0.46 × 4 = 3235 de-intronization events. While
this estimate is clearly quite rough, that no such events are
observed indicates nearly universal efficient selection
opposing such insertions of moderate length.
Alternative splicing and the evolution of intron-exon
structure
In most cases, non-conserved splicing boundaries lie near
clear candidates for alternative splicing boundaries. In
some cases cDNAs confirm alternative use of the two
boundaries in JEC21. The non-conserved JEC21 boundary

may dominate, but the alternative boundary may be used
(at some level of efficiency) in the absence of the non-conserved boundary. Indeed, given the low overall level of
transcript coverage, the 'alternative' boundary may be
most frequently used even in JEC21, and by chance the
few available transcript sequences reflect the less frequent
boundary, thus loss of frequently-used splicing boundaries may be even less common than this study suggests.
General applicability of the present results: boundary
constraints and population size
Is lack of changes at intron boundaries likely to be common across eukaryotes? Presumably, selection against
boundary changes will be inversely related to the availability of true alternative boundaries, and the overall efficacy of selection in general (effective population size).
Alternative boundaries are likely to be less frequent in
intron-poor species such as S. cerevisiae, which require
extended splice boundaries (e.g., GTATGT) for splicing,
and more frequent in species with more lax splice bound-

aries, which tend to rely on more distant splicing factors
(Cryptococcus is somewhat intermediate among eukaryotes
in the degree of adherence to the splicing boundary consensus sequence; see references [32,33]).
The case for strength of selection is less straightforward.
Recently, Lynch and colleagues have presented a series of
arguments for a major role of slightly deleterious events in
the evolution of genome structure (e.g., [23,34,35]).
Within this paradigm, slightly-deleterious mutations may
be tolerated in species with small effective population
size, but not in larger populations, since the overall effectiveness of selection is dependent on the difference in fitness multiplied by the effective population size. Thus,
boundary changes that are effectively selected against in
Cryptococcus, which is estimated to have a relatively large
effective population size [34,35], might be tolerated (i.e.,
be able to drift to fixation) in a smaller population.
In discerning the role of effective population size in determining genome structures, it is important to keep in mind
that the selective effects on different mutations, even
superficially similar ones such as analogous mutations at
different intron boundaries, are likely to vary widely. Different intron boundaries do or do not have available alternative splice boundaries, alternative boundaries will have
different splicing efficiencies across introns, the impacts of
intron boundary shifts on mRNA transcripts and resulting
proteins will vary across introns, strength of selection
against inefficient splicing is likely to vary across introns,
and so forth.
What is notable, then, is that nearly all boundaries in
Cryptococcus – relatively weakly and relatively strongly
selected – are preserved by selection. As any of the above
variables seems likely to vary by at least an order of magnitude, overall strength of selection on intron boundaries
is likely to vary by multiple orders of magnitude. Thus,
while a large decrease in effective population size relative
to Cryptococcus could lead to some intron boundaries
becoming effectively neutral, it would likely require a tremendous change in effective population size to lead to a
significant rate of change for a substantial fraction of
boundaries.
Change of intron boundaries through eukaryotic evolution
These results allow us to make rough estimates of the contribution of these processes to modern intron-exon structures. Among the species studied, divergence at
synonymous sites is roughly 0.46, and degree of intron
boundary change is roughly 10 changes for 28,256
introns, or 0.00077 times the rate of divergence at silent
sites, per intron. Rates of divergence at synonymous sites
have been estimated for a few divergent eukaryotic lineages, and are typically around 5 × 10-8 to 5 × 10-9, per year

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/192

[36-40]. This would suggest a rate of boundary sliding for
Cryptococcus introns of around 4 × 10-11 or 4 × 10-12 per
year. Thus, over roughly two billion years of eukaryotic
evolution, the probability of a given intron in a given lineage having undergone a boundary change would be on
the order of 0.008 to 0.08. On the simplest model, the
probability of an intron undergoing 'sliding,' by change at
both boundaries, would be the square of this probability,
or 0.00006 to 0.006 (and the probability of changes of the
exact number of nucleotides of the exact number of bases
at both boundaries, obscuring the change, would presumably be rarer still). These very rough estimates suggest that
intron sliding may not be a major contributor to intron
position diversity among homologs.
We can similarly ask about the contribution of intronization to modern genomes. Introns arising from intronization appear to be initially alternatively spliced (i.e., the
sequence is either spliced or retained; [9]). Over time, the
sequence may either revert to the non-spliced form by losing the new splicing boundaries, or may become a constitutively spliced intron (it is also possible that the
alternative spliced form could persist, however such
'intron retention' alternative splicing events are not
known to be preserved over long evolutionary times; see
reference [9]). If the intronized sequence become constitutively spliced, it is then presumably vulnerable to subsequent intron loss. Thus, the probability that an initial
intronization is responsible for an observed modern
intron is equal to c(1-L), where c is the probability that the
intron becomes constitutive (rather than reverts) and L is
the probability that it is subsequently lost. Thus the total
contribution of intronization events to a modern species
would be equal to I × c(1-L), where I is the number of initial intronization events occurring in the history of the
species (i.e., since the origin of spliceosomal introns).
Here, I found five intronization events occurring over an
evolutionary time period corresponding to 0.10 of silent
site divergence (that is, the external branch leading to
JEC21, since the study was only able to detect intronization events in JEC21; see Figure 1), suggesting roughly 5/
0.10 = 50 intronization events per genome per unit of dS,
or a per-genome rate of roughly 2.5 × 10-6 to 2.5 × 10-7 per
genome per year. This suggests that a modern species may
have experienced roughly I = 500 to 5000 intronization
events since early eukaryotic history. Very intron-rich
modern species have upwards of one hundred thousand
introns [41,42], in which case intronization is unlikely to
explain a large fraction of modern introns. Moderately
intron-rich species have thousands or tens of thousands of
introns, and appear to have lost the majority of their
ancestral introns even over timescales significantly shorter
than eukaryotic history (e.g., dipterans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, euascomycetous fungi, Caenorhabditis nematodes, apicomplexans, ciliates, phytophthora; [4,6,7],43–

Page 8 of 10

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:192

45), suggesting high L values, in which case intronization
may also not be a major contributor to the genomic
intron complement of modern species. Intron-poor modern species have very large L values (greater than 99% in
some species [4,6,7,43,35], in which case few introns due
to intronization events are likely to remain in these species. These arguments suggest that intronization may not
be a major overall contributor to modern gene structures.
However, it is important to keep in mind that these estimates are necessarily quite rough.
Quality of assembly and annotations
How robust are the present results likely to be to the limitations of current genome assemblies and annotation?
There are three major potential concerns: intron prediction, sequencing errors, and genome alignments. First, the
presence of cDNA transcripts reflecting that splicing event
confirms that annotated 'intron' is in fact spliced, whether
constitutively or alternatively. Second, sequencing errors
at intron boundaries are unlikely to be a major contributor to these results, since for the vast majority of observed
apparent changes either (i) there is a nearby alternative
boundary, providing a simple explanation for the absence
of the boundary; or (ii) at least two species lack GT..AG
boundaries, which cannot be explained by rare sequence
errors. Third, the low degree of divergence across these
species leads to clear sequence similarity across the entire
studied region: as is clear in the figures, changes in boundaries often represent single nucleotide changes within a
long region of conserved sequence, allowing confidence
in the true homology and quality of alignment of the
studied regions overall. Notably, each of these concerns
involve false positives, potentially inflating numbers of
boundary changes; thus the central finding of very little
change of intron boundaries is robust to such concerns.

It is also important to be clear about what sorts of changes
are and are not detectable in this study. A change in
intron-exon splicing boundary need not require change in
GT...AG boundaries, but instead could simply be due to
the emergence of a more robustly recognized boundary
that overshadows the ancestral boundary. While the initial boundary movement in such a case would not be
detectable in the current study, the now defunct boundary
would be expected to eventually incur a mutation, which
would be detected by this study. Given that for each such
change both a true (unobserved) boundary change and a
mutation knocking out the initial boundary are expected,
the rate of mutations knocking out initial boundaries is
expected to equal the true rate of boundary change, thus
this scenario cannot explain the lack of observed change.
Conservation of intron-exon structures in Cryptococcus
These results attest to the slow general rate of change of
intron-exon structures in Cryptococcus. Previously it has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/192

been shown that intron loss and gain are very infrequent
among these species [27], and that splicing boundaries of
even UTR introns, the splicing of which is not required to
regenerate coding sequences in transcripts, are largely conserved across the clade [29]. The present results extend
this conservation to the level of conservation of the specific splicing boundaries.
Total branch length in terms of rate of silent site substitutions (dS) has previously been estimated as 0.46 across
the entire clade [13], thus most neutral pairs of adjacent
sites (dinucleotides) are expected to have undergone a
change (specifically [1-(1-0.46)×(1-0.46)] = 0.71). That
~99.9% of boundaries are conserved thus suggests that a
similar fraction are conserved by selection. Presumably, in
the absence of candidate alternative boundaries, there will
be strong selection for splicing, and thus to retain the single available boundary. More mysterious is selection
retaining boundaries in the significant fraction of cases in
which there is a nearby boundary-like motif (in particular
for the simple C/TAG 3' boundary). In such cases, it could
be the case that such boundary-like motifs are not able to
act as alternative boundaries, leading to efficient purifying
selection on the single efficient splice boundary. Alternatively, natural selection could oppose even small changes
in boundary position, perhaps due to consequent indels
in the encoded protein.

Conclusion
These results show that intronization, de-intronization,
and intron sliding have been rare events in the recent evolution of a genus of intron-rich fungi. Along with previous
findings that intron loss and intron gain is rare among
these species, this finding shows a picture of highly static
intron-exon structures in Cryptococcus. These results suggest that genic sequence changes have not played as large
a role in the evolution of intron-exon structures as previously suggested.

Methods
I obtained genome-level alignments for regions corresponding to 28,256 coding sequence introns, previously
studied by Hughes et al. [24], and identified cases where
GT/C...AG splicing boundaries were not conserved at all
four species at the positions corresponding to the JEC21
intron boundaries. Intron splicing was confirmed by
BLAST searches of flanking exonic sequences (100 nts on
each side) against 59,041 available JEC21 cDNA
sequences, downloaded from NCBI, and all introns with
a hit lacking the intervening sequence (i.e. ungapped)
were retained. Manual inspection showed that many of
the remaining cases were due to alignment ambiguities
(many associated with expansion/contraction of intronic
microsatellites), or to long sequencing gaps (often a long
series of N's in one species, usually H99). A few other

cases involved ambiguous or complex patterns involving
multiple very long insertions/deletions, and were
excluded. This manual filtering yielded 40 cases of nonconserved boundaries.
