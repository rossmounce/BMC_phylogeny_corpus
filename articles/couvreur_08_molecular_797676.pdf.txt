Abstract
Background: Tropical rain forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems on the planet. How
this diversity evolved remains largely unexplained. In Africa, rain forests are situated in two
geographically isolated regions: the West-Central Guineo-Congolian region and the coastal and
montane regions of East Africa. These regions have strong floristic affinities with each other,
suggesting a former connection via an Eocene pan-African rain forest. High levels of endemism
observed in both regions have been hypothesized to be the result of either 1) a single break-up
followed by a long isolation or 2) multiple fragmentation and reconnection since the Oligocene. To
test these hypotheses the evolutionary history of endemic taxa within a rain forest restricted
African lineage of the plant family Annonaceae was studied. Molecular phylogenies and divergence
dates were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock assumption
accounting for both calibration and phylogenetic uncertainties.
Results: Our results provide strong evidence that East African endemic lineages of Annonaceae
have multiple origins dated to significantly different times spanning the Oligocene and Miocene
epochs. Moreover, these successive origins (c. 33, 16 and 8 million years – Myr) coincide with
known periods of aridification and geological activity in Africa that would have recurrently isolated
the Guineo-Congolian rain forest from the East African one. All East African taxa were found to
have diversified prior to Pleistocene times.
Conclusion: Molecular phylogenetic dating analyses of this large pan-African clade of Annonaceae
unravels an interesting pattern of diversification for rain forest restricted trees co-occurring in
West/Central and East African rain forests. Our results suggest that repeated reconnections
between the West/Central and East African rain forest blocks allowed for biotic exchange while
the break-ups induced speciation via vicariance, enhancing the levels of endemicity. These results
provide an explanation for present day distribution patterns and origins of endemicity for African
rain forest trees. Moreover, given the pre-Pleistocene origins of all the studied endemic East
African genera and species, these results also offer important insights for setting conservation
priorities in these highly diversified but threatened ecosystems.

Background
Tropical rain forests harbor outstanding levels of biodiversity. Numerous studies have focused on how such high
levels of species richness might be maintained through
time [1-3]. Much less is known about the evolutionary origins that have led to the generation of these hyper-rich
ecosystems [4,5]. Understanding the evolutionary history
and biogeographic processes behind the origin of such
areas plays a central role in setting conservation priorities
[6,7]. In Africa, rain forests of the Guineo-Congolian floristic region [8] occur in a coastal band in West Africa and
occupy vast areas in Central Africa (Figure 1A). In East
Africa, rain forests occur in small, highly fragmented
patches near the coast and in the adjacent Eastern Arc
Mountains (Figure 1A), covering a small surface area (c.
7000 km2). Despite the relatively small size of the area,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/54

the East African rain forests harbor an exceptional density
of endemic plant species [9,10], which is one of the highest on the planet [7], and have been identified as one of
25 global biodiversity hotspots [7]. The Guineo-Congolian and East African regions are geographically isolated
by a c. 1000 km-wide North-South arid corridor creating
an effective barrier to dispersal for rain forest-restricted
taxa. Nevertheless, floristic comparisons indicate strong
affinities between the two rain forest regions within
numerous distantly related plant families [8,9,11,12].
Indeed, many endemic species are representatives of widespread genera co-occurring in the Guineo-Congolian and
East African rain forest regions. In addition, the endemic
East African genera are thought to be closely related to
Guineo-Congolian genera. These strong affinities are gen-

erally explained by the presence of a continuous rain forest across tropical Africa during the Eocene [9-16].
One hypothesis for explaining the high levels of endemicity suggests that this pan-African rain forest broke up only
once at the onset of East African aridification during the
Oligocene-Early Miocene (c. 33-20 Myr) [11-13,15,17]
and that the c. 30 Myr of isolation of the East African rain
forests coupled with a highly fragmented habitat led to
the high levels of endemicity observed in East Africa. In
contrast, an alternative hypothesis suggests that from the
mid-Tertiary onwards (c. 33-2 Myr) African rain forests
expanded and contracted on multiple occasions after the
initial break-up [9,12,14,16]. Expansion and reconnection would have allowed new lineages to spread from
West-Central Africa to East Africa or vice versa. Subsequent contraction and isolation would have resulted in
diversification by vicariance or allopatric speciation, thus
enhancing the levels of biodiversity and endemicity.
In the context of studying the origins of East African dryadapted endemic species in the genus Acridocarpus (Malpighiaceae), dated molecular phylogenies have proven to
be a powerful tool [17]. Here we use a similar approach
on a rain forest-restricted clade with disjunct West-Central
and East African distributions, which provides a way to
test the above hypotheses. If a single break-up of the panAfrican rain forest is responsible for the observed distribution, then all the splits between Guineo-Congolian and
East African lineages should be dated to the same period
(Figure 1B). In contrast, in an oscillating forest scenario
we expect to find a chronological sequence of multiple
vicariance events, with splits dated at significantly different time periods (Figure 1C).
We studied the evolutionary history of the largest monophyletic African clade of rain forest trees [18] within the
diverse pan-tropical family Annonaceae. Annonaceae is
one of the best examples of a tropical plant family for
which strong positive correlations were found between
abundance and species richness, and temperature and
rainfall, respectively [see [19]]). This implies that Annonaceae are mainly restricted to tropical rain forests and thus
provide an ideal model family to test hypotheses on the
evolution of rain forests. The studied African clade is composed of three genera endemic to the East African rain forests, two endemic to the Guineo-Congolian region, and
six disjunct genera with numerous species endemic to
either East or West-Central African rain forests [20]. These
genera are not found in arid parts of Africa and are
restricted to forests with high rainfall regimes and relatively short dry seasons. Moreover, the comparatively
large fruits found within this group are not adapted to
long-distance dispersal. Within this clade, monocarps are
sessile in genera with apocarpous fruits [18] and differ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/54

from the stalked monocarps that are more common in
Annonaceae. So, even though individual fruitlets are free,
in the context of dispersal these genera have fruits that
functionally are equivalent to syncarpous fruits, far too
large for effective long-distance dispersers such as birds.
Rather, they are dispersed by mammals that are restricted
to rain forests, such as gorillas [21], and their crossing
wide arid corridors is a highly improbable event. This low
dispersal capacity as well as the restriction and abundance
of this clade in both the Guineo-Congolian and East African rain forests [11,20,22] renders this clade suitable for
testing the above hypotheses.
Two dated, well-resolved molecular phylogenies were
generated using plastid DNA sequences, focusing specifically on two different taxonomic levels within the African
clade. The first phylogeny contained representatives of all
eleven African genera and was used to date the deeper
splits within this clade. Second, a species-level phylogeny
was estimated for two sister genera, Isolona and Monodora,
each of which has endemics in both Guineo-Congolian
and East African rain forests [20,23]. Both trees were dated
under a Bayesian relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock
assumption.

Methods
Taxon sampling and sequence data
For this study two different chloroplast DNA sequence
datasets were used. First, in order to date the origin of the
East African endemic genera, a previously published DNA
sequence data matrix (dataset A in Additional file 1) of the
African clade was used (Couvreur et al., 2008, treeBASE
SN3554). This dataset, totaling 64 taxa, included all the
genera of the African clade (11 genera) and presented a
thorough sampling of the genera within the long branch
clade [24]. The family Eupomatiaceae was used as the outgroup [Eupomatiaceae has been recovered as sister to
Annonaceae, [25,26]]). The dataset was composed of six
plastid markers, three non-coding (trnL-trnF, trnSG, and
psbA-trnH) and three coding (ndhF, rbcL, and partial
matK), totaling 7945 characters.

Second, in order to date the splits within genera, a specieslevel phylogeny of the two sister genera Isolona (15 out of
20 species) and Monodora (13 out of 14 species) was generated (dataset B, see Additional file 1, treeBASE number
SN3633). For both genera all the known East African species were included.
A modified cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
protocol of Doyle and Doyle [27] following Bakker et al.
[28] was used for DNA extraction. The universal primers
C/D and E/F [29] were used to amplify and sequence the
trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer. The psbA-trnH intergenic
spacer was amplified and sequenced using primers psbA

BMC Biology 2008, 6:54

and trnH (GUG) [30]. The trnS-trnG intergenic spacer was
amplified and sequenced using primers trnS (GCU) and
trnG (UCC) [30] and the trnD-trnT marker was also
amplified and sequenced using primers trnTGGU and trnDGUC [31]. In addition, the second part of the ndhF gene was
sequenced as it has been shown to be more variable than
the more conserved 5' region and is thus more appropriate for species-level analyses [32]. The Annonaceae specific primer LBC-intF [32] was used in combination with
the usual 2110R primer [33] amplifying a region of c. 620
bp. PCR reactions were performed with 30–50 ng of
genomic DNA, 0.4% of BSA, 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2
mM dNTP PCR mix (Promega, Madison, WI), 3 μM
MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 U
of Taq DNApolymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a total
volume of 50 μl. The PCR program was as follows: 35
thermal cycles at 94°C for 1 minute, 50–55°C for 50 seconds, 72°C for 50 seconds and a final extension at 72°C
for 3 minutes.
For both datasets, sequences were edited using the program Staden [34] and aligned manually using PAUP*
[version 4.10b; [34]]. Gaps were coded following the simple coding model of Simmons and Ochoterena [35]. Microsatellites were excluded from the analysis, as these
structures probably originate through slipped-strand mispairing [36] and are likely to be highly homoplasious.
Phylogenetic analysis and divergence date estimates
In order to test whether the estimated dates of the origin
of the East African endemic lineages are significantly different the molecular trees were dated under a Bayesian
framework using the software BEAST v. 1.4.7 [37,38]. The
method implemented in BEAST simultaneously estimates
divergence times, tree topology, and rates, thereby providing a clear advantage over previous relaxed clock methods
[39] that estimate tree topology and divergence dates separately [e.g. [40-42]]). Both datasets were partitioned into
the number of markers used by directly editing of the XLM
file and following Couvreur [44]. The best performing
evolutionary model for each marker was identified under
two different model selection criteria, the hierarchical
likelihood ratio test (hLRT) and the Akaike information
criterion [AIC; [43]]) as implemented in MrModelTest
[44]. For both datasets two independent analyses were
undertaken to check for convergence of the MCMC
chains. Analyses were undertaken by sampling every
1000th generation, and were considered complete once
the effective sampling size (ESS) of each parameter was
above 200, as suggested in the BEAST manual. In order to
assess that the MCMC chain reached stationarity we examined the lnL plots using Tracer v. 1.3 [45]. In particular, we
searched for evidence that the model likelihood and
parameter estimates had reached stationarity after a burnin period.

Calibration
The testing of the two alternative hypotheses presented in
Figure 1 can be viewed under a relative time scale [46], i.e.
with no reference to any absolute timing. However, fossil
information is available and was used in order to calibrate
trees in an absolute time frame. The fossil taxon Archaeanthus [98 Myr, [47]]) is characterized by distinctive derived
stipules, an elongated receptacle, and fruits with numerous well spaced follicles, all of which are interpreted as
synapomorphies shared with the family Magnoliaceae
[47-49]. Thus, this fossil provides a minimum age for the
stem of Magnoliaceae of 98 Myr. Even though the correct
placement of this fossil within the Magnoliales has been
questioned in the past [50], recent studies [24,48,51] have
largely relied on Archaeanthus to date this family. Fossil
information within Annonaceae is limited ([e.g. [52,53]])
and is thought [24,48] to be unreliable with respect to
their exact placement and was thus not used in this study.
One other relevant fossil is the Early Cretaceous
Endressinia taxon (112 Myr [56]). This fossil is characterized by broad staminodes with lateral glands, which
implies a possible sister relationship to Eupomatiaceae
and would thus provide an older minimum age of 112
Myr for the split between Eupomatiaceae and Annonaceae
than with Archaeanthus. However, the method used to
assign Endressinia to Eupomatiaceae (see [57]) has been
criticized and is thought to be unreliable [58]. Thus, we
deemed Archaeanthus the most reliable fossil calibration
point and this was used to assign a minimum age to the
Magnoliaceae stem node.

Using the age of Archaeanthus as well as a wider taxon
sampling within Annonaceae (80 genera out of c. 110,
205 OTUs) and rbcL and trnLF sequences, Pirie [59] provided an age estimate of 91 Myr (± 1.5 Myr) for the stem
of Annonaceae (split between Eupomatiaceae and
Annonaceae) when using the Penalized Likelihood
method of Sanderson [43]. This estimated date is in
accordance with previously published date estimates for
the origin of Annonaceae [24,60]. Thus, 91 Myr was used
as a calibration point for dataset A. Secondary calibration
(calibrating a node with a date provided by a previous
analysis) is a commonly used alternative given the
absence of a method for direct calibration (e.g. fossil or
geological [61-63]). However, it has been shown that,
unless particular care is taken, secondary calibration can
generate internal inconsistencies leading to unreliable
dates [64]. BEAST accommodates for calibration uncertainty by applying a prior probability distribution on the
age, e.g. a prior distribution defined in terms of its mean
and standard deviation [38]. A wide variety of prior probability distributions are available [65]. For this study a
normal probability distribution was used as it is thought
to better reflect uncertainty related to secondary calibration points [65]. For dataset A, a mean of 91 and a stand-

BMC Biology 2008, 6:54

ard deviation of 1.5 were specified. This effectively
encloses a range of possible ages from c. 89 to 93 Myr. In
dataset B, a normal distribution was also used for the age
of the stem node of Isolona and Monodora, with the mean
taken from the analysis of dataset A. The standard deviation was set to contain the lower and higher boundaries of
the 95% highest posterior density values effectively
accommodating for age uncertainty.
Both sequence datasets (A and B) deviated from a strict
molecular clock and rates between adjacent branches were
uncorrelated as shown by the values of the parameters
'coefficient of variation' and 'covariance', respectively [66]
(Table 1). Thus divergence times were estimated under a
lognormal non-correlated relaxed clock method and
using the Yule model of speciation as implemented in
BEAST 1.4.7. In all cases user-specified chronogram trees
were used as starting trees and were obtained using the r8s
program [67]. Finally, taxon subsets were specified for
each clade of interest allowing recording of the mean time
of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA), the 95%
highest posterior density intervals (HPD), and the effective sampling size (ESS). Dates were considered significantly different only when the 95% HPDs were not
overlapping.

Results
Divergence times
Our results provide strong support for the multiple connection-reconnection hypothesis with relative ages of
splits occurring at three significantly different periods in
time (Figure 2). The estimated absolute ages for all of the
major clades recognized within Annonaceae are in perfect
agreement with recent studies [24,50]. Within the African
clade five different origins of endemic East African lineages were identified (Figure 2A and 2B, nodes a-e). Node
'a' represents the origin of the Sanrafaelia/Ophrypetalum
clade with a mean age of 32.9 Myr (95% HPD: 42.9–23.6
Myr) and node 'b' that of Asteranthe with a mean age of
16.8 (HPD: 23.4–10.5). Node 'c' indicates the origin of
the East African endemic species Uvariodendron kirkii, with
a mean of 8.4 Myr (HPD: 13.2–3.7). Two further nodes
are indicated in Figure 2B, with the first one corresponding to the origin of the East African species of Monodora

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/54

(node 'd'), with a mean of 8.4 Myr (HPD: 12.2–4.7). The
lack of phylogenetic resolution makes it impossible to distinguish the origin of the East African species of Isolona
(Figure 2B). Therefore, only a minimum age for this
potential split can be provided corresponding to node 'e'
with a mean of 5.4 Myr (HPD: 8.4–2.5). Each age estimate
(Figure 2C) for these nodes is dated to three significantly
different periods of time as the 95% HPDs do not overlap.
For node 'c', 'd', and 'e' the 95% HPDs do largely overlap,
indicating no significant differences in the age estimates.
Phylogenetic analyses
The chronograms and phylogenetic relationships resulting from both analyses are presented in Figure 2A and 2B.
At the generic level (dataset A) the resulting phylogenetic
relationships as well as corresponding branch support
were identical to those found in Couvreur et al. [18]. The
species-level chronogram (dataset B) of the two sister genera Isolona and Monodora is represented in Figure 2B. Monodora has two well-supported sister clades (Bayesian
posterior probability – PP = 1.00): a West African clade,
and an East African clade. Relationships within the West
African clade are weakly supported except for the sister
position of Monodora angolensis (PP = 1.00) to the remaining West African species. In the East African clade, Monodora grandidieri is strongly supported as sister to the rest of
the taxa. Moreover, Monodora globiflora with Monodora
carolinae and Monodora stenopetala, as well as Monodora
hastipetala with Monodora junodii form well-supported
subclades (PP = 1.00). The Malagasy species of Isolona
form a highly supported, nested clade. The East African
taxa are also strongly supported as nested within Isolona;
however, their relationship with the other clades remains
unresolved.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the splits between the
Guineo-Congolian and East African Annonaceae lineages
have multiple origins at significantly different times (Figure 2), which is congruent with the hypothesis presented
in Figure 1C. Given that the majority of species found
within this clade are restricted to rain forests and present
no long-range dispersal potential, we interpret the
observed pattern as a likely consequence of a series of con-

nection-isolation events between the East African and
Guineo-Congolian forests. Our results were obtained with
just one plant group, but the biogeographic patterns
observed in Annonaceae are common amongst many
other tree families in Africa in terms of ecology (taxa
restricted to rain forests) and distribution (disjunct
between West/Central and East Africa) [8,11,12]. Therefore, we predict that the evolutionary process of divergence by vicariance on multiple occasions could be a
common pattern for numerous other plant taxa in Africa,
thus explaining much of the plant distribution and endemicity within African rain forest tree families. Interestingly, multiple splits between East and West-Central rain
forest dwelling lineages at different times were also found
to have occurred in African caecilian amphibians [48].
Thus, it would appear that this process could also be the
main factor behind present day distribution patterns for a
wide range of African rain forest restricted organisms,
including animals.
Our results also provide important insights into the absolute time scale of these events, especially for the origin of
the East African endemic lineages. The dates inferred from
our study were obtained based on time calibration using
the fossil taxon Archaeanthus (see Methods) as it is generally accepted to represent a minimum age constraint for
the stem of Magnoliaceae [24,49,50,53,58,59]. Even
acknowledging the complex history of vegetation change
in East Africa [16] and the uncertainty in age estimates, the
estimated origins of these splits using the Archaeanthus
fossil calibration coincide well with known periods of
renewed aridity and/or continental uplift in East Africa.
These phenomena are generally thought to have played a
role in the break-up of the pan-African rain forest, thus
providing an explanation for the observed splits, which
can be looked upon as further support of their correctness.
The first split is dated to the Oligocene (mean: 32.9 Myr;
Figure 2A – a), which corresponds to a period of drastic
global cooling resulting, in part, from the development of
permanent continental ice-sheets in Antarctica [68]. This
cooling induced a drier climate at equatorial levels in
Africa, fragmenting the pan-African Eocene rain forest
[14]. The second split, dated to the Late-Early Miocene
(mean: 16.8, Figure 2A – b), post-dates an Early Miocene
warmer and moister climate during which rain forest is
thought to have extended again from coast to coast
[13,15], and coincides with the Miocene climatic optimum (17-15 Myr) characterized by high global temperatures [68]. This period also witnessed the closure of the
Tethys sea when the African plate collided with the Eurasian one (c. 18-17 Myr), bringing an end to the moist
influence of the latitudinal oceanic circulation system
[15,69]. These drier conditions, as well as higher global
temperatures, induced a new period of marked aridity,
allowing the spread of savannas at the expense of rain for-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/54

ests [15,69]. This is visible at the paleobotanical level by
an increase in grass abundance across Africa by 16 Myr
[16]. The third significant split (mean: 8.4–5.4 Myr)
occurred in three lineages, Uvariodendron (Figure 2A – c),
Monodora (Figure 2B – d), and Isolona (Figure 2B – e), and
took place after the initiation of geological activity in the
western East African Rift System that uplifted the central
Tanganyikan plateau (c. 10 Myr) [12,70]. Such uplifting
has been shown to have played a significant role in the
aridification of eastern Africa [70]. Moreover, this estimated date also coincides with a period of significant
extension of savannas in East Africa [16,69], as judged by
an increase in biomass of plants using C4 photosynthetic
pathways (8-6 Myr) [71].
Furthermore, even with our fossil-based minimum age
estimates most speciation events in East African Isolona
and Monodora (Figure 2B) have a pre-Pleistocene origin
indicating a lack of diversification in the East African rain
forests during the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene
(e.g. [72]). For East Africa, this pattern was also documented in clawed frogs where all extant East African taxa
were found to have originated before the Pleistocene [73].
Paleoecological records from the Eastern Arcs in Tanzania
spanning the last 38,000 years provided evidence of ecosystem stability during the last glacial maximum period
[74]. This lack of diversification during the Pleistocene is
generally thought to be due to the stabilizing moist influence of the Indian Ocean on tropical rain forests in parts
of coastal and montane East Africa, allowing them to persist throughout glacial periods without any important
fluctuations in size [12,75]. Therefore, our results provide
strong evidence that a larger Oligocene-Miocene continental-scale fragmentation between, rather than within,
East and West-Central rain forest regions has played a
major role in generating the patterns in plant distribution
and endemicity that are currently observed across Africa.
However, it may be that other, possibly herbaceous,
groups diversified in East Africa as a result of Pleistocene
climatic change but this is certainly not the case for
Annonaceae and is likely also not true for other woody
representatives of the East African rain forest flora.
Finally, our results indicate that the highly fragmented
and threatened rain forests of Eastern Africa contain large
amounts of pre-Pleistocene derived endemic lineages having evolutionary histories that date back to the Early Oligocene. A large majority of these lineages are species-poor
[11], making them vulnerable to extinction. Additionally,
most of the endemic species or genera are highly vulnerable to extinction because of small distributional ranges
[9]. Subsequently, they have been red-listed with some
level of threat to their survival (an estimated 22–25% of
the total number of endemic species [Roy Gereau, personal communication]). Thus, because of their ancient

Page 7 of 10

BMC Biology 2008, 6:54

origins and species-poor composition, the extinction of
just a handful of species could result in the loss of significant phylogenetic diversity [6]. This information should
be carefully and urgently taken into consideration in
future conservation planning within the East African
region as knowledge of the presence of such ancient lineages allows us to prioritize areas with high phylogenetic
diversity [6,76,77].

Conclusion
Our molecular phylogenetic study on the evolutionary
history of this pan-African Annonaceae rain forest clade
provided numerous important insights into the evolutionary origins of African rain forest trees. We show that
the East African lineages within this large clade have significantly different temporal origins. This would suggest
that present day distribution and endemicity in African
rain forest is a likely consequence of a series of connection-isolation events between the East African and
Guineo-Congolian forests. Moreover, all the East African
taxa appear to have diversified before the Pleistocene climatic oscillations. This provides evidence for the increasingly probable hypothesis that East African rain forests
have been ecologically stable during those times. Finally,
the old pre-Pleistocene origins of the endemic East African
taxa suggest that these biodiversity hotspot regions contain high levels of phylogenetic diversity, an important
factor to take into account for conservation priorities.
