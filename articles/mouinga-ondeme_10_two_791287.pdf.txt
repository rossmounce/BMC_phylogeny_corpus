Abstract
Background: Each of the pathogenic human retroviruses (HIV-1/2 and HTLV-1) has a nonhuman primate
counterpart, and the presence of these retroviruses in humans results from interspecies transmission. The passage
of another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from apes or monkeys to humans has been reported.
Mandrillus sphinx, a monkey species living in central Africa, is naturally infected with SFV. We evaluated the natural
history of the virus in a free-ranging colony of mandrills and investigated possible transmission of mandrill SFV to
humans.
Results: We studied 84 semi-free-ranging captive mandrills at the Primate Centre of the Centre International de
Recherches Médicales de Franceville (Gabon) and 15 wild mandrills caught in various areas of the country. The
presence of SFV was also evaluated in 20 people who worked closely with mandrills and other nonhuman
primates. SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the
integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70/84 (83%) captive and 9/15
(60%) wild-caught mandrills and in 2/20 (10%) humans. The 425-bp SFV integrase fragment was detected in
peripheral blood DNA from 53 captive and 8 wild-caught mandrills and in two personnel. Sequence and
phylogenetic studies demonstrated the presence of two distinct strains of mandrill SFV, one clade including SFVs
from mandrills living in the northern part of Gabon and the second consisting of SFV from animals living in the
south. One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a
macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The second man had a sequence close to
SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus from the first man and from the mandrill showed
nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time.
Conclusion: Our results show a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with
the presence of two different strains. We also showed transmission of SFV from a mandrill and a macaque to
humans.

Introduction
Foamy viruses are members of the Spumavirus genus of
the Retroviridae family [1]. These complex exogenous
retroviruses are highly prevalent in several animal species, including nonhuman primates, felines, bovines and
equines, in which they cause persistent infection [2-7].
Simian foamy virus (SFV) infection has been reported in

1-6% of people occupationally exposed to nonhuman
primates in zoos, primate centres and laboratories,
mainly in North America but also in Europe [8-14].
Recently, naturally acquired SFV infections were
described in a group of hunters living in Cameroon,
central Africa [15,16], and in people in frequent contact
with various macaque species in Asia [17,18]. In Cameroon, 3.6% of people who were severely bitten and otherwise injured while hunting gorillas and chimpanzees had
detectable SFV infection [16].

Foamy viruses are considered to be non-pathogenic in
naturally or experimentally infected animals
[10,11,16,19,20]. This apparent lack of pathogenicity
strongly contrasts with the cytopathic effect seen in
vitro in infected cell cultures, with the characteristic
foamy appearance of vacuolized cells [19,21,22]. It was
suggested recently that the non-pathogenicity of SFV
infection in nonhuman primates in vivo is due to replication in a superficial cell niche of the oral mucosa [23].
In contrast to lentiviruses, such as HIV and simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), foamy viruses show little
genetic drift in vivo [2,24-27]. Phylogenetic analysis has
shown species-specific distribution of foamy viruses,
indicating long-term co-evolution with their natural
hosts. Switzer et al. suggested that foamy viruses have
co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30
million years [28].
While the molecular features of foamy viruses in vitro
have been studied extensively [19,21,22,29,30], little
information is available on their epidemiological and
viral characteristics in vivo [3,4,18,20,24-26,31]. The
published epidemiological studies indicate that the seroprevalence of antibodies to SFVs in captive adult nonhuman primate populations can reach 75-100% [4,20,24].
Although several reports have been published on the
prevalence of SFV in semi-free-ranging colonies and
wild troops of nonhuman primates [2,17,27,32-40], the
timing and modes of primary infection in vivo, especially
in natura, are still poorly understood.
A semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills (Mandrillus
sphinx) was created at the Primate Centre of the International Centre for Medical Research (CIRMF) in
Gabon in 1983, and more than 140 mandrills are now
housed in the Centre [41]. Mandrills are found in the
wild in a restricted area of central Africa, in the tropical
forests of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and
southern Congo [41]. It has been reported previously
that mandrills are naturally infected with SIV (SIVmnd)
and simian T-cell leukaemia virus (STLV-1) [41-48], but
little information is available on SFV infection in mandrills. Calattini et al. reported that a small series of wildborn, wild-caught mandrills in Cameroon as well as five
mandrills in the Primate Centre in Gabon were infected
with SFV [3]. Furthermore, recent studies showed that
interspecies transmission of SFV from mandrills to
humans is possible [15,16,34].
The aim of our study was to evaluate the natural history of mandrill SFV in this free-ranging colony, including the prevalence, modes of transmission, genetic
diversity and origin. We also investigated cross-species
transmission of mandrill SFVs to people occupationally
exposed to these animals.

Results
SFV is highly endemic among mandrills, and the
prevalence increases significantly with age

The seroprevalence of SFV was evaluated in 84 mandrills (mean age, 8 years; range, 1-29), comprising 38
males (mean age, 7 years; range, 1-20) and 46 females
(mean age, 8.6 years; range, 2-29). Of these, 28 were
juveniles (< 4 years); 36 were sub-adults (5-10 years); 6
were adults (11-15 years), and 14 were old adults (>16
years) (Table 1). We found by Western blot analysis
that 70 of the 84 mandrills had gag doublet reactivity,
and they were thus considered SFV seropositive (Figure
1), for an overall seroprevalence of 83%. Four were of
indeterminate seropositivity, and the 10 others were
considered seronegative. As seen in Table 1 the seroprevalence increased significantly with age (p <0.001), from
57% in juvenile monkeys to 94% in adults and 100% in
older mandrills. No significant difference was found
between males (84%) and females (82%).
Molecular detection of SFV and genetic diversity in
mandrills

The DNA samples obtained from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the 84 mandrills were
examined by nested PCR targeting a 425-bp fragment of
integrase, a region in the polymerase gene. The 14 seronegative and indeterminate samples were PCR negative.
SFV DNA was detected in 61 of 70 seropositive samples
(87%); although the other nine mandrills were serologically positive, no SFV DNA could be detected. The
sequence of the integrase fragment was obtained for 53
PCR-positive samples (Table 1). Nucleotide sequence
comparison showed that 52/53 sequences were closely
related, with 94-100% sequence similarity, and they were
also closely related to the five SFV sequences previously
obtained by Calattini et al. [3]. The one divergent sample, Mnd31CDP, from a wild-born mandrill introduced
into the colony at the age of 2 years, showed greater
nucleotide divergence (8-9%) than all the other mandrill
SFV sequences.
The phylogenetic analysis confirmed these findings, as
shown in Figure 2. This tree represents the 11 main
SFV strains circulating in the colony and, in the insert,
all 53 sequences, including the 11 main strains (in colour). These 53 newly obtained SFV strains belong to a
large clade comprising all the available sequences from
mandrills and drills, with a high bootstrap value (100%).
This clade contains two main clusters. The first comprises most of the new sequences and others previously
obtained from mandrills, including the five sequences of
Calattini et al. [3], from the same breeding centre. The
second consists of the unique Mnd31CDP strain, which

Mandrills in Gabon are naturally infected with two
distinct variants of simian foamy virus

To determine the origin and distribution of the different
clades in the mandrill colony, a 267-bp portion of the
cytochrome b sequence was amplified and sequenced
from 21 SFV-infected monkeys in the colony and from
eight mandrills caught in the wild (Figure 3) in various
regions of Gabon (Figure 4).

As seen in the phylogenetic tree, two distinct clusters
could be distinguished, with perfect correlation between
cytochrome b sequences and the origin of the wild mandrills. One cluster consisted of mandrills from regions
north of the Ogooué River and the second of animals
from regions south of the Ogooué. The Mnd31CDP
cytochrome b sequence clustered with sequences
obtained from mandrills originating in southern Gabon,
as did 14 of 21 analysed sequences of cytochrome b
from our colony. Only six sequences from other mandrills in our colony clustered with sequences from mandrills from northern Gabon (above the Ogooué River,
see Figure 4).
To confirm the hypothesis that mandrills are infected
naturally with two different SFV strains, we amplified
and sequenced SFV from DNA in blood or tissue samples collected from eight mandrills (pets or ‘bush meat’)
from northern Gabon and seven from the southern part
(Figure 4). Eight SFV sequences were obtained and compared with the SFV in our colony. Phylogenetic analysis
confirmed that mandrills are infected with two SFV
strains (Figure 5). Mnd31CDP clustered with the SFV
obtained from wild monkeys from the south, whereas
the other strain clustered with newly obtained viruses
from wild northern animals. Cytochrome b phylogenetic
analysis also confirmed the geographical separation of
the wild mandrills (Figure 3).
Transmission of SFV from mandrills to humans

We evaluated the possible transmission of mandrill SFV
to humans by examining 20 people (15 men and 5
women; mean age, 39 years; range, 20-54) occupationally
exposed to mandrills as animal caretakers or veterinarians at the Primatology Centre. The mean duration of
exposure to nonhuman primates was 12 years (range,
5 months to 27 years). Two of these people (10%) were
found to be SFV-seropositive by Western blotting
(Figure 1). The SFV integrase sequence was detected by
nested PCR in PBMCs from the two seropositive persons, who were found to be the only ones who had

been bitten by nonhuman primates during their work at
the Centre. The first person (H1CIRMF) was bitten by a
chimpanzee on a finger in 1996 and by a mandrill
(Mnd2ACDP) on a shoulder during the same year. The
second person (H2CIRMF) recalled a bite on a finger by
an unknown monkey in 1985. SFV sequences were
obtained from amplified 425-bp integrase fragments in
PBMC DNA from the two SFV seropositive persons as
well as from the chimpanzee and the mandrill
Mnd2ACDP. Phylogenetic analysis (Figure 6) showed
that the viruses from H1CIRMF and from mandrill
Mnd2ACDP were almost identical, with only one base
difference (99.7% nucleotide identity). This sequence was

not related to the sequence obtained from the chimpanzee. Phylogenetic analysis of the SFV obtained from the
second person showed that the virus was located in the
clade of Asian SFVs (bootstrap, 96%) and clustered with
Macaca fascicularis (Figure 6). The two SFV-infected
humans are healthy and show no clinical signs related to
a retroviral infection, 15 years after the bites.
SFV shows extremely low genetic drift in mandrills and
humans

To evaluate the genetic variability of SFV in vivo, we
investigated the virus population in one mandrill at an
interval of 10 years, and we also studied the genetic

13 clones from the same animal 10 years later, and 11
clones from the bitten person 10 years after the bite.
Comparative sequence analysis showed strong nucleotide sequence similarity (data not shown), with a major
identical strain (12/18 and 9/13 clones identical) among
the sequences obtained in the mandrill on day 0 and 10
years later. The major strain (4/11 clones) in the
infected person differed by one base from the major
mandrill strain. The other clones in the two mandrill
and the human samples differed only slightly, with a
divergence of one or two bases. Also, as seen in Additional file 1 clones sequenced from H1CIRMF clustered
mainly at the top of the tree, while sequences of the
clones from Mnd2ACDP clustered in the middle, close

to some published sequences. Only one clone sequence
from H1CIRMF, CIRMF1C9, was closely related to a
clone sequence from Mnd2ACDP (Mnd2AC10Y10).

Discussion
We found a high seroprevalence of SFV in a semi-freeranging colony of mandrills originating from and living
in Gabon, central Africa. The habitat of mandrills is
restricted to western central Africa, which is highly
endemic for other retroviruses, such as SIV and STLV
[42-47]. A seroprevalence of 89.5% was found in a small
free-ranging macaque population (mostly adults) living
in a temple in Bali, Indonesia, with a higher prevalence
in adults than in juveniles [18,31,39]. A larger study provided evidence that Macaca tonkeana acquire SFV
mainly through severe bites, mainly when young adults
aged 5-8 years compete for sex partners [27]. In a study
of free-ranging colonies of chimpanzees, Liu et al. found
a significant increase in SFV infection with age, with no
evidence of vertical transmission to the young [32]. In
our study, there was a clear increase in SFV infection at
4-5 years of age. Altogether, these findings indicate horizontal rather than vertical (perinatal) transmission as the
predominant route of SFV infection in these nonhuman
primate communities. Nevertheless, some species or colony specificity may be found in natura among troops of
nonhuman primates, which might change the relative
importance of different modes and thus the timing of
SFV transmission.

Figure 5 Phylogenetic confirmation of the presence of two
circulating SFV strains among mandrills. Phylogenetic tree of the
425-bp fragments of a region of the integrase region in the SFV
polymerase gene. All 11 representative strains newly identified from
mandrills in the colony (in red) at the CIRMF and the 8 new strains
identified from wild mandrills (in blue) located in various regions of
the country are shown in the tree. The new strains from mandrills
were analysed with SFV sequences obtained from various species of
nonhuman primates available in Genbank. The phylogenetic tree
was obtained by the Bayesian method implemented in MrBayes
version 3.1 software as described in the legend to Figure 2. The
names of the different nonhuman primate species included in the
tree are listed on the right side of the tree.

It is known that a similar virus can be transmitted
quite differently in different nonhuman primate species:
STLV-1 appears to be acquired mainly in breast milk in
M. tonkeana [27] but is acquired mainly in adulthood in
chimpanzees [18,33,49]; in mandrills, it is probably
acquired through bites [42,46-48,50] and to a lesser
extent by sexual contact, and a predator-prey system
may sometimes be also involved [49]. In our mandrill
colony, about 50 animals were SFV-positive at the age
of 1 year, perhaps due to exchange of saliva with their
mother during feeding. It was reported recently that
mandrills have a prominent muzzle-muzzle behaviour,
usually between young naive and older individuals

[51,34-44]. It has also been reported that salivary glands
are the major reservoir of SFV replication in monkeys
[23,26,29]. We did not observe any difference in
seroprevalence according to the sex of the animals.
SFV seroprevalence increased significantly with age.
These findings are similar to those on the seroprevalence of STLV-1 in this colony, which was evaluated at
13.4% [52].
Our study indicates that all except one integrase
sequence of the SFV strains circulating in the colony are
closely related, and some are identical. The probable
explanation is related to the history of the colony, which
was founded in 1983 with only a few animals, some of
which probably harboured a virus originating from
northern Gabon. The virus was therefore transmitted
and spread in the colony during the past 25 years by the
founders from the northern part of the country. Ten different strains are circulating in the northern group, with
96-99% sequence similarity. Similar observations have
been made with regard to the circulation of several
strains in other nonhuman primates, including monkeys
and apes [2,17,27,53].
The animal that harboured the eleventh strain circulating in the colony, which is quite different from the
other strains, was a wild-born mandrill brought to
the Primate Centre in 2003 from the southern part of
the country at the age of 2 years. It was kept in quarantine for 6 months and then introduced into the mandrill
colony. Dissemination of the virus could occur in several
ways, as indicated above, but also because one of the
infected mandrills is a dominant male in the colony.
This hypothesis cannot, however, be confirmed, since
no sample was available from the first mandrills introduced into the colony.
Our finding that two different strains exist in the
colony suggests that mandrills living currently in
northern and southern Gabon are infected by two different SFV strains. Similar situations have been
reported for two other retroviruses that infect these
monkey species, SIV [43] and STLV-1 [47]. As seen in
Figure 3 the cytochrome b study showed that most of
the mandrills are from the south but are infected with
a SFV strain from the north. This suggests that they
were infected in the breeding colony by a SFV virus
from a mandrill originating from the north (Figure 2),
except for mandrill 31 (see above). In contrast, the origin of each wild mandrill (Figure 3) was concordant
with the virus they harboured (Figure 5), confirming
infection in their natural area. Furthermore, studies of
cytochrome b polymorphism suggest that the Ogooué
River separates mandrill populations into two different
phylogenetic groups: one in the north (northern
Gabon and Cameroon) and the other south of the
River (southern Gabon and Congo) [54].

Figure 6 Phylogenetic tree of the 425-bp fragments of the SFV integrase sequences obtained from two workers at the Primate Centre
of the CIRMF. The two cases of SFV infection are in colour: red for the first and blue for the second. The origin of the first SFV sequence
(H1CIRMF) is clearly defined as a mandrill (Mnd2ACDP), shown in the same colour. The second SFV sequence (H2CIRMF) clusters with Asian
macaque sequences. The tree was inferred as described in Figure 2. Identified by an asterisk are the three published mandrill sequences known
to infect humans. Human sequences are indicated by H (for human), a number (1 or 2) and CIRMF (Centre International de recherches Médicales
de Franceville), where the study was performed.

Monkeys have a long co-existence with their SFV
[2,24,28,32,33,53,55,56], which would have started when
mandrills in both the north and the south had a common ancestor and has persisted since their separation,
about 800 000 years ago [54]. These results for SFV
infection in mandrills are supported by the fact that the
same mandrills are infected with SIV [43] and STLV
[47]. Our analysis of the results for 15 wild mandrills
caught in the northern and southern parts of Gabon
clearly indicates the existence of two different variant
strains of SFV. The discrepancy in our study between
serological data and the absence of the SFV sequence in
mandrill PBMCs may be due to a low viral load in
blood samples. In some juveniles, it could be the result
of high levels of maternal antibodies against SFV [2].
We also found that two of 20 people working at the
Primate Centre were infected with SFVs: one with a
mandrill strain and the second with a macaque virus.
Only about 50 people worldwide have been shown to be
SFV-infected (both serologically and molecularly)
[13,14], including people occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates [12,25] and people at risk in natural
settings, such as hunters in central Africa [15,16].
Furthermore, only three other human infections with
mandrill SFV have been reported. In the first case, a
hunter living in Cameroon was found to be infected by
a mandrill strain, but the route of infection was not
documented [15]. The second case was in a blood
donor in Cameroon, also with no information on the
route of infection [34]. In the third case, a man aged 26
years had been bitten by a small monkey while hunting
1 year before the presence of mandrill SFV was found
[16]. We demonstrated the identity of the viral foamy
strain in the donor (Mnd2ACDP) by molecular sequencing at the time of the bite that probably transmitted
the virus, and in the human recipient 10 years later,
with 99% similarity between the two sequences.
This person had been bitten only once by mandrill
Mnd2ACDP and not by other mandrills. The presence
of a sequence from the clones of H1CIRMF
(CIRMF1C9) among clone sequences from Mnd2ACDP,
particularly Mnd2AC10Y0 (Additional file 1), sustains
the hypothesis of the origin of H1CIRMF virus from
Mnd2ACDP. No close sequence similarity was found
between the H1CIRMF sequence and the three other
sequences previously found in humans infected by a
mandrill SFV [15,16,34] (Figure 6).
Only one molecular demonstration of SFV interspecies
transmission has previously been reported, due to a bite
by a chimpanzee to a zoo worker [12]. Although the
person infected by the mandrill virus in our study had
also been bitten during his professional activity by a
chimpanzee, we were unable to detect any chimpanzee
SFV sequence in his PBMCs. ‘Dual’ risks with only one

Page 8 of 12

virus detectable by PCR have also been reported in hunters in south Cameroon [16]. Co-infection with two different simian viruses was demonstrated recently in
chimpanzees infected not only with their own chimpanzee SFV, but also with a Colobus strain [49]. The second human was infected with a strain related to a
macaque SFV. Despite the use of thousands of macaques in biomedical research, primate facilities and institutions for decades (in both Europe and North
America), only one case of human infection with a
macaque foamy virus has been reported (in a worker in
Canada after a severe bite) [9]. In contrast, recent studies in Asia showed transmission of macaque SFV to
nine people, including zoo workers, owners of nonhuman primate pets, ‘bush meat’ hunters and temple
workers [17,18]. Mathematical modeling shows that, in
Bali, about six of every 1000 visitors to monkey temples
will be infected with SFV [39].
In our work, we also observed high stability of the
integrase sequence of SFV over time (10 years in an
infected mandrill as well as in an infected human), with
neither genetic drift over time nor the presence of
quasi-species. Foamy viruses are genetically very stable
[57] and, with the exception of cross-species transmissions, have co-evolved with their hosts [28]. Their high
genome conservation often allows attribution to a particular monkey or ape subspecies through analysis of the
appropriate foamy virus sequence [27,32,33]. Furthermore, in cross-species transmission to humans or apes,
the transmitted virus can be easily traced back to the
transmitting monkey species and appears to be genetically stable in the new host for decades [53,58,59].
In conclusion, we have shown that SFV is highly endemic in mandrills in Gabon, and this virus can be transmitted to humans. Further studies are being conducted
to evaluate the prevalence of this virus in larger samples
from various monkey species in central Africa. We are
also studying the natural transmission of these viruses
to human populations living in this geographical area,
where consumption of ‘bush meat’ and hunting are
common.

Materials and methods
Mandrills and biological samples

We studied 84 mandrills in the semi-free-ranging colony
housed at the Primatology Centre of the International
Centre for Medical Research in Franceville, Gabon.
Wild-born, wild-caught animals and animals born at the
Centre were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health.
The six male and eight female mandrills that founded
the colony were brought from various parts of Gabon
and released into the enclosure in 1983 [43,46]. A small
colony of macaques (M. fascicularis) was also founded

Mouinga-Ondémé et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:105
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/105

in 1983. Blood samples from monkeys in this colony are
collected every year, stored at -80°C and tested for different retroviruses, including SFV. Thus, between
November 2006 and January 2007, 7 ml of blood were
collected from mandrills in EDTA-K2 tubes under ketamine HCl anaesthesia (10 mg/kg body weight). Plasma
and PBMCs obtained after Ficoll separation were kept
frozen.
Wild mandrills were collected in cities and villages
throughout the country and in the Lopé Reserve. We
collected blood samples from locally captured live animals (pets) and from wild mandrills as previously
described [43]. Small amounts of tissue (donated by
hunters) were also collected from fresh cadavers in villages or on markets [54]. No money or favours were
exchanged for these samples in order to prevent any
increase in demand for ‘bush meat’. All samples were
collected with the approval of the Gabonese Government and in accordance with national laws. Tissue samples were immediately preserved and then stored at -20°
C until tested.
To evaluate possible transmission of SFV from mandrills to humans, blood was collected from caretakers or
veterinarians working at the Primatology Centre. The
participants were volunteers, and fully informed consent
was obtained from each person before testing. The samples were anonymous, but age and information about
the contact, such as a bite, scratches or other wounds,
were retained (for 12 years of mean length of potential
exposure to animals). The study obtained ethical clearance from the public health authorities.
Serological studies

Plasma from mandrills was screened for the presence of
foamy virus antibodies as described previously [4,25,60].
Briefly, a Western blot assay was performed with an
SFV-infected BHK-21 cell line as the source of foamy
viral antigens [27]. Plasma was tested at 1:100 dilution.
Western blot seropositivity was defined as the presence
of reactivity to the Gag doublet of 70 kDa and 74 kDa,
as previously described [4]. Samples without reactivity
to either Gag protein were considered seronegative, and
those with reactivity to a single band in the 70- to
74-kDa molecular mass range were considered indeterminate. The Western blot positive control was serum
from an SFV-positive chimpanzee, used by Calattini
et al. [16]. The negative serum was obtained from a
human who had never been in contact with a nonhuman primate.
Molecular studies

High relative molecular mass genomic DNA was
extracted from PBMCs from the tested animals and
tested against several positive and negative controls with

Page 9 of 12

the Qiagen kit (QIAmp blood Mini Kit, Courtaboeuf,
France). The first round of PCR involved a described set
of primers [61] (primer 1: GCC ACC CAA GGG AGT
TAT GTG G, and primer 2: GCT GCA CCC TGA
TCA GAG TG) for amplifying an integrase fragment of
590 bp (a region in the polymerase gene), under the following conditions: 40 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at
94°C, 30 s of annealing at 55°C and 1 min of extension
at 72°C. A 425-bp fragment corresponding to another
portion of the integrase was amplified under the same
conditions with nested primers (primer 3: CCT GGA
TGC AGA GTT GGA TC and primer 4: GAA GGA
GCC TTA GTG GGG TA), as reported previously
[25,60,61].
The presence and quality of the extracted DNA were
verified by amplifying an albumin gene fragment.
Amplification and detection of albumin were carried out
as described for SFV pol sequences, but with specific
primers (forward: AlbF: GCT GTC ATC TCT TGT
GGG CTG T and reverse: AlbR: ACT CAT GGG AGC
TGC TGG TTC) [62]. Molecular amplification was also
performed, with the same program, to study the 267-bp
cytochrome b region, which was sufficiently variable to
differentiate the northern and southern populations of
mandrills [54] with these specific primers: L14725: CGA
AGC TTG ATATGA AAA ACC ATC GTT G and
H15149: AAA CTG CAG CCCCTC AGA ATG ATA
TTT GTC CTC A [63]. Positive PCR products were
directly sequenced. In order to evaluate genetic drift in
vivo, purified PCR products were cloned with the
pCR2.1 TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,
USA), and various positive clones were selected,
extracted, purified and sequenced with an automatic
sequencing system (GATC, Germany).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

All the SFV and cytochrome b sequences from mandrills
and humans obtained in this study have been submitted
to GenBank as cytochrome b (accession numbers
GU169713 to GU169741) and SFV (accession numbers
GU169742 to GU169847).
Phylogenetic analysis

For the phylogenetic analysis, the new SFV sequences
were aligned with the ClustalW (1.81) program [64] and
then analysed and edited with Bioedit http://www.mbio.
ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html. The final alignment was
submitted to the the Bayesian method implemented in
MrBayes version 3.1 software (2005) [65] with the Jones,
Taylor and Thornton model [66] and the rtREV model
[67] of evolution and gamma distributed rates at sites,
with one million generations and burn-in of 2.5%. Bayesian parameters were examined with the Tracer program http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Evolve/Software.html to

Mouinga-Ondémé et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:105

determine convergence to a stable log likelihood value.
Likelihood traces between replicate runs were compared
for convergence to similar log likelihood values. All estimated sample sizes were greater than 545 [68]. If replicate runs converged, all trees after burn-in were
combined to create a single consensus tree. BMCMC
posterior probability values represent the proportion of
MCMC samples that contain a particular node. The
final phylogenetic tree was obtained by majority rule
consensus and after editing with the graphic resources
contained in the FigTree v1.2 software http://tree.bio.ed.
ac.uk/software/figtree.
Statistical analysis

SFV serological status in relation to sex and age group
was analysed statistically by the chi-squared test with
Yates correction, and prevalence and odds ratios were
calculated. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals
were reported as measures of statistical significance. The
Mann-Whitney U test was also used for statistical analysis. Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. All analyses
were performed with Statistica software v7.1 (StatSoft
France, http://www.statsoft.fr).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S. Phylogenetic tree of all clones from
H1CIRMF and Mnd2ACDP. SFV clones of 425 bp of integrase fragments
obtained from H1CIRMF (in red) were aligned with those from
Mnd2ACDP (in blue). Phylogenetic analyses were done as described in
the legend to Figure 2. Clones from H1CIRMF were identified as CIRMF
(see Figure 6), a number, C (for clone) and another number (vg:
CIRMF1C9). Clones from Mnd2ACDP are in two groups: on the day of
injury: Mnd2A (the mandrill), followed by C (for clone, with a
corresponding number) and ending with J0 (day of injury). The clones
obtained 10 years after the injury have Y10 (10 years after) at the end.
An outgroup is the sequence Mnd203SFV (reported by Calattini et al. [3]
as originating from a drill, but clustering with Cercocebus species).
