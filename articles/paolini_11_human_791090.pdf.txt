Abstract
Background: The pathogenic role of beta-HPVs in non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), is not still completely
understood, and literature data indicate that they might be at least cofactors in the development of certain
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. However, only few reports contain data on basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The
HPVs interact with many cellular proteins altering their function or the expression levels, like the p16INK4a and Akt.
Our study aimed to determine the presence of different beta -HPV types and the expression of p16INK4a and Akt in
BCC, the commonest NMSC, in the normal appearing perilesional skin and in forehead swab of 37
immunocompetent patients.
Methods: The expression of p16INK4a and Akt, by immunohistochemistry, and the HPV DNA, by nested PCR, were
investigated in each sample.
Results: No correspondence of HPV types between BCC and swab samples was found, whereas a correspondence
between perilesional skin and BCC was ascertained in the 16,7% of the patients. In BCC, 16 different types of beta
HPV were found and the most frequent types were HPV107 (15,4%), HPV100 (11,5%) and HPV15 (11,5%) all
belonging to the beta HPV species 2. Immunohistochemistry detected significant p16INK4a expression in almost all
tumor samples (94,3%) with the highest percentages (> 30%) of positive cells detected in 8 cases. A statistically
significant (p = 0,012) increase of beta HPV presence was detected in p16INK4a strongly positive samples, in
particular of species 2. pAkt expression was detected in all tumor samples with only 2 cases showing rare positive
cells, whereas Akt2 expression was found in 14 out of 35 BCC (40%); in particular in HPV positive samples overexpressing p16INK4a.
Conclusions: Our data show that p16INK4a and pAkt are over-expressed in BCC and that the high expression of
p16INK4a and of Akt2 isoform is often associated with the presence of beta-HPV species 2 (i.e. HPV 15). The
association of these viruses with the up-regulation of p16INK4a and Akt/PI3K pathway suggests that in a subtype of
BCC these viruses may exert a role in the carcinogenesis or in other, still undefined, biological property of these
tumors. If this particular type of BCC reflects a different biology it will remain undisclosed until further studies on a
larger number of samples will be performed.

Background
The family of the Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) comprises more than 120 different genotypes, 112 (HPV1 to
HPV112) of which were characterized after cloning and
sequencing of their genomes [1-3]. Currently, HPVs are

classified into five genera: Alpha(a)-, Beta (b)-, Gamma
(g)-, Mu(μ)- and Nu(ν)- papillomavirus, according to
their genomic DNA sequence [1]. The phylogeny of PVs
indicates that these viruses have evolved by multiple
mechanisms including, but not exclusively, recombination events between the virus and the corresponding
host [4]. Many a-HPVs, in particular HPV 16, can
induce papillomatous proliferations with a high risk for
malignant progression and are associated with cancer of

the cervix uteri, other anogenital cancers, and a subgroup of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma [5-7].
The first link between HPV and skin cancers was
demonstrated in a rare autosomal-inherited disease
called Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV) [8]. This
disease is characterized by an abnormal predisposition
to infection by certain HPV types (now classified as the
genus b-HPVs) as well as cutaneous lesions that display
a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC). Although genus b-HPVs have been frequently
detected in non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in
immunosuppressed individuals, very little is known
about the presence of the virus in immunocompetent
individuals [9-11]. No firm correlation between clinical
and pathological NMSC characteristics and HPV DNA
prevalence was found. However, it was recently shown
that high-risk cutaneous HPV8 early genes enhance
tumorigenesis rates in transgenic mice [12], further supporting the hypothesis that b cutaneous HPVs can be
tumorigenic [13]. The DNA of these HPV was detected
in 30-90% of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinomas of non-EV patients [14,15] but few data exist on
basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the commonest NMSC. Our
study aimed to determine a large spectrum of b-HPV
types in BCC of immunocompetent patients by comparing the HPV analysis in the lesional and perilesional
skin as well as to investigate whether less invasive technique like forehead swab can be predictive of the HPV
presence in skin tumors.
In addition, in order to evaluate the role of b-HPV in
neoplastic proliferation, the expression of two host genes,
p16INK4a and Akt, were investigated. The expression pattern of p16INK4a in dysplastic squamous and glandular cervical cells in tissue sections and in cervical smears has
been extensively investigated and linked [16,17] to anogenital a-HPV gene expression. The same a-HPVs are also
able to interact with the Akt pathway [18]. Cutaneous
HPVs can modulate epidermal Akt activity using the same
mechanisms as anogenital HPVs with the differences that
b-HPV downregulates the Akt1 during infection and do
not affect the up-regulation of the Akt2 isoform during
cancerogenesis. Indeed Akt activity is associated with stratum corneum function [19], and it was reported that cutaneous HPVs also modulate stratum corneum properties
acting through Akt1 down-regulation.
However few data reported the involvement of b HPV,
p16INK4a and Akt expression in BCC and therefore in
the present study their possible relationships were
investigated.

Methods
Patients

The patients enrolled in the study were attending

Institute (IRCCS) of Rome, Italy. This study was
approved by the local medical ethical committee and
patients signed an informed consent. In brief all patients
answered a standardized interview and underwent a
physical examination. During physical examination, the
dermatologist recorded the skin type (Fitzpatrick’s
Scale), the possible presence of skin cancers and their
anatomical localization (Table 1). Only the patients with
histological confirmed skin cancer were further evaluated. In brief, 37 paraffin-embedded blocks, microscopically diagnosed as BCC by expert pathologists were
analyzed at the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute
(IRCCS) of Rome, Italy. Safe margin was defined as a
part of perilesional skin that had no evidence of involvement by BCC. This group was considered as controls. In
addition, from the same patients material by forehead
swab was obtained, recovered in 1 ml of preservCyt
medium (Cytyc Corp., Rome, Italy), and stored at 4°C
until analysed.
DNA isolation from different sample types

Ten-micron sections were prepared from paraffin blocks
and were stored in sterile tubes. Chances of contamination during section cutting were minimized by removing
the initial section that was cut to remove any environmental contamination which had occurred while blocks
were stored and by changing cryostat blades in between
samples. In the tubes containing the sections 1,2 mL of
xylene were added to remove the paraffin, subsequently
the tubes were centrifuged at high speed for 1 minute
and the liquid layer was removed. The pellet was suspended in 1,2 mL of 100% ethanol and after high-speed
centrifugation the supernatant was discarded. If necessary, a second ethanol wash was performed. Next, the
pellet was processed by the QIAamp DNA Mini kit
(QIAGEN, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Swab samples stored in preservCyt medium
were centrifuged and the DNA was extracted with the
same QIAamp DNA mini kit. The final elution was performed in 100 μL of tris/EDTA buffer.
HPV DNA detection by PCRs

HPV DNA detection was carried out using the primers
located in the late L1 ORF as previously described.
Briefly, CP65/70 [11] and MY09/11 [20] primers were
utilized in the first PCR and CP66/69 [11] and GP5+/6+
[21] for the nested PCR. The quality of the isolated
DNA was checked by amplifying b-globin gene [22].
Five μL of purified DNA was used in each PCR mixture.
In short, the PCR assay was carried out in a 50-μL mixture containing the primer sets at 25 pmol each, 3.6
mM MgCl2, a mixture of deoxynucleoside triphosphates
2.5 mM each and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen,
Italy). Cycling conditions were as follows: 2.30 min of

denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min of
denaturation at 95°C, 1.5 min of annealing at 50°C
(CP65/70 and GP5+/6+) or 55°C (CP66/69 and MY09/
11), and 2 min of extension at 72°C. An additional incubation for 10 min at 72°C was performed at the end of
cycling. All temperature transitions were performed with
maximal heating and cooling settings (5°C/s). For every
PCRs, a reaction negative control (sterile water only) was
included. These controls were processed in the same way
as the tissue specimens and they were never found to be
positive for HPV. Twenty μL aliquot of the PCR mixture
was visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose
gel electrophoresis. The amplified products were purified,
and sequenced in an automated apparatus (BioFab,
Rome, Italy). The determination of specific genotypes
were done analyzing the sequences with BLAST programme (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).
p16INK4a, p-Akt and Akt2 immunohistochemistry

The p16INK4a, p-Akt and Akt2 immunostaining was carried out on 5 μm thick sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks.
p-Akt and Akt2 immunohistochemistry was performed
using the rabbit monoclonal antibodies Ser473 and 54G8
(Cell Signaling, SIAL, Rome, Italy), respectively. Antigen
retrieval was carried out by pretreating the dewaxed and
rehydrated slides in a water bath at 96°C for 40 minutes
in sodium citrate buffer (citric acid monohydrate 10 mM
adjusted to pH 6.0 with 2 N sodium hydroxide), followed
by cooling at room temperature for both antibodies.
Immunoreactivity was revealed by means of a super sensitive multilink streptavidin-enhanced immunoperoxidase
system (Novocastra, Menarini, Florence, Italy), using 3,3’diaminobenzidine as a chromogenic substrate. p16INK4a
expression was revealed by means of a commercially
available kit (CINTec Histology Kit, Mtm, Italy), which
includes the monoclonal antibody E6H4, following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

and clearly different from that of the surrounding normal epithelium, independently of the number of positive
cells [24]. Staining intensity was not graded to avoid
subjective interpretation.

Results and discussion
HPV DNA in different specimens

Thirty-seven immunocompetent patients referred to the
Dermatology Clinic at San Gallicano Institute and
affected by BCC were included in the study. The mean
age was 62 ± 15 years. Data for each patient are
reported in Table 1. Ten and fifteen BCC were from the
trunk and back respectively, 7 from the extremities and
5 from the head and neck region. Each bioptic skin
sample underwent to immunohistochemical analysis and
HPV nested PCR on consecutive slices. In all samples
the HPV DNA was detected in 26 of 37 (70,3%) lesional
skins and in 19 of 37 (51,3%) perilesional areas. No alfa
or gamma papillomavirus was detected. Forehead swabs
showed positivity for beta-HPV in 34 of 37 (91,9%) samples. Similar proportions of HPV positive forehead samples were already described in individuals with skin
cancer [25,26]. No statistically significant association
was revealed among HPV presence, phototype, or anatomical localization. Among the detected papillomaviruses
in all analyzed samples, HPV38 was the most frequent
type (Figure 1).

Scoring of the p16INK4a immunostaining

Nuclear stain, with or without cytoplasmic reactivity,
was considered positive and a percentage of positive
nuclei was calculated. Samples were then divided in
three categories according to the number of p16 INK4a
-positive atypical keratinocytes: negative (< 1% positive
nuclei), moderate: less than 30% positive nuclei, and
strong: 30% or more positive nuclei. Similar scoring was
already employed to ascertain p16INK4a expression in
NMSC [23]. Staining intensity was not graded to avoid
subjective interpretation.
Scoring of the Akt immunostaining

Cases were considered positive for p-Akt and Akt2
when cytoplasmic as well as nuclear staining was strong

In the HPV DNA-positive BCC samples, 16 different
types of beta-HPV were found and the most frequent
types were HPV107 (15,4%), HPV100 (11,5%) and
HPV15 (11,5%) all belonging to the b-HPV species 2,
while in perilesional samples the different HPV types
detected were 9 and the most frequent was the HPV38
(26,3%) (Figure 2). Forslund et al [27] found that in sunexposed skin, cutaneous species 2 HPVs were predominating in SCC. Although the number of specimens analyzed in this study is not suitable to state the prevalence
rate of HPV species, our data can lead to hypothesize a
correlation between beta-HPV species 2 and BCC. However some serological studies showed no firm association of both cutaneous and genital HPV with BCC
[28,29].
The HPV types found in forehead swabs were 18 and the
most frequent type was HPV100 (17,6%). No correspondence of HPV type between BCC and swab samples was
found, whereas a correspondence between perilesional normal skin and BCC was found in three samples (Table 1).
Rollison et al. [30] evaluating BCC patients reported that
HPV DNA in the cutaneous swabs of normal skin was a
poor specific marker to predict the HPV type in the tumor
tissue. However, specificity improved when combinations
of different biomarkers were evaluated, especially among
SCC cases [31]. In our study only a single non-invasive
technique was employed and the results confirm that cutaneous swabs cannot be utilized as a single method for epidemiological studies on HPV associated skin cancer.
Immunohistochemistry analysis
p16INK4a immunostaining

Immunohistochemistry detected p16INK4a expression in
33 of 35 (94,2%) tumor samples. In particular a higher

Page 5 of 9

score (≥ 30% of p16INK4a positive dysplastic keratinocytes) was detected in 8 cases (Table 1 and Figure 3).
Absent or weak p16INK4a expression was documented in
rare cells of few perilesional skin samples (Figure 3).
These data contrast with those showing that an inactivation of p16 INK4a is commonly associated with more
malignant features in many tumors [31], including BCC
[32-37]. However other reports stated a strong p16INK4a
mRNA expression in BCC skin [38-40]. Eshkoor et al.
[39] found a significant protein and mRNA expression
in BCC cells when compared with normal skin tissue. In
particular the samples they tested were paraffinembedded skin BCC as our samples. Indeed conflicting
results could be attributed to different methods used,
which need further optimization of experimental conditions. Furthermore, there appears to be a strong relationship between the level of invasiveness and
expression of p16INK4a. Svensson et al. [40] showed that
p16INK4a expression is associated with a highly invasive
BCC subtype with infiltrative growth patterns. In the
mean time the results of Conscience et al. [38] contradict those of Svensson et al. [40], as they did not
observe any difference in the expression of p16 INK4a
among different histological types of carcinoma suggesting that p16 INK4a expression does not correlate with
malignancy or proliferation. On the contrary the
p16INK4a over-expression was found significantly associated with the BCC location on sun-exposed areas. Our
data did not evidence such association and are more
consistent with those of Eshkoor et al. [39] and Svensson et al. [40].
Akt 1/2 immunostaining

Immunohistochemistry detected pAkt1 expression in 30
out of 32 (93,7%) tumor samples (Table 1 and Figure 4).

with only 2 cases showing rare positive cells. Most of
the positive cells showed signal in the cytoplasm and in
the nucleus, suggesting that pAkt properly translocates
in the nucleus to exert its activity. Thus the PI3K ⁄Akt
pathway is activated in BCC examined in our study.
This result suggests that activation of this important
pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer. Similar observations have been
reported previously. In one study, 11 SCC and 17 BCC
were stained for pAkt and both tumors showed expression of pAkt [41]. Another immunohistochemical study
included 50 SCC and 20 BCC and found also a higher
pAkt expression in SCC than in BCC [42]. Finally in a

recent report including 30 SSC and 31 BCC no significant difference regarding pAkt expression was detected
between SCC and BCC even though all BCC showed
positive signal for pAkt in immunohistochemistry [43].
Therefore, our immunohistochemical results confirm
previous reports about the role of the PI3K ⁄Akt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin
cancer, including BCC. However, it was reported that
Akt1 isoform may be down-regulated in human SCC,
while Akt2 isoform is up-regulated in most cases [13].
This increased phosphorylation of pAkt in NMSC may
be caused by activating mutations of Akt2, but these
mutations appear to be very infrequent events with no

clear functional relevance [44-46]. On the contrary
experimental evidences indicate that Akt2 up-regulation
occurs mostly in the b-HPV/+ve tumor [13]. Therefore,
the detected increased phosphorylation of pAkt in our
BCC may be also caused by beta-HPV induced activation of Akt2. Indeed Akt2 expression was detected in 14
out of 35 BCC (40%) and in particular in samples in
which the presence of beta HPV was associated with an
over expression of p16INK4a (Table 1 and Figure 3).
HPV, p16INK4a, and Akt

Many studies investigated the correlation between HPV
infection and skin tumor pathogenesis but so far HPV
types with a putative increased malignant potential have
been observed mostly only in SCC, in a few EV patients
and in some cases of NMSC of immunosuppressed
transplant recipients. Data on the relationship between
BCC and HPV infection are still not consistent with a
causative role. Nevertheless our data indicate an association between b-HPV and the expression of p16INK4a and
Akt that are involved in cell cycle deregulation.
The immunohistochemistry data showed the activation
of Akt/PI3K pathway in BCC and literature data suggest
that HPV can interact with this pathway by activating
the isoform Akt2 [13,42]. The simultaneously up-regulation of p16INK4a may reflect the interaction of E7 oncogene of b-HPV species 2 with pRb, with a mechanism
similar to that already reported for a-HPV [16]. Indeed
recent reports indicate that the E7 protein of b HPV
may interact in vitro with pRb (Cornet I., personal communication) causing an elevation of p16INK4a expression.
In particular we detected and defined the expression of
p16 INK4a as moderate with less that 30% positive

Page 7 of 9

keratinocytes or high with 30% or more positive cells.
As shown in Figure 5, on the basis of this cut-off, a statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test; p = 0,012) difference in the percentage (88% versus 68%, respectively) of
HPV positive samples was detected between high and
moderate p16INK4a positive samples, indicating that an
association may exist between b-HPV and BCC. A direct
link will be proved in further studies by detecting the
co-localization of beta-HPV expression and p16INK4a in
dysplastic cells.
In alternative the up-regulation of Akt2 and p16INK4a
in some samples may be indicative of the presence of an
active b-HPV and may represent surrogate markers of
viral infection without a direct involvement into
carcinogenesis.

Conclusions
Our data demonstrate that p16INK4a and pAkt are overexpressed in BCC and that this high expression of
p16INK4a and of the Akt2 isoform is associated with the
presence of b-HPV species 2 (i.e. HPV 15). Our study
was not performed to give information about prevalence
of HPV, therefore the results cannot be considered for
the identification of putative high risk beta papillomavirus. Nevertheless, the association of these viruses with
the up-regulation of p16 INK4a and Akt/PI3K pathway
suggests that in a subtype of BCC these viruses may
exert a role in the carcinogenesis or in other, still undefined, biological property of these tumors. If this particular type of BCC reflects a different biology it will
remain undisclosed until further studies on a larger
number of samples will be performed.
