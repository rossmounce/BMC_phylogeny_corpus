Abstract
Background: Transcript profiling of closely related species provides a means for identifying genes potentially
important in species diversification. However, the predictive value of transcript profiling for inferring downstreamphysiological processes has been unclear. In the present study we use shotgun proteomics to validate inferences from
microarray studies regarding physiological differences in three Pachycladon species. We compare transcript and protein
profiling and evaluate their predictive value for inferring glucosinolate chemotypes characteristic of these species.
Results: Evidence from heterologous microarrays and shotgun proteomics revealed differential expression of genes
involved in glucosinolate hydrolysis (myrosinase-associated proteins) and biosynthesis (methylthioalkylmalate
isomerase and dehydrogenase), the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate (carbonic anhydrases), water
use efficiency (ascorbate peroxidase, 2 cys peroxiredoxin, 20 kDa chloroplastic chaperonin, mitochondrial succinyl CoA
ligase) and others (glutathione-S-transferase, serine racemase, vegetative storage proteins, genes related to translation
and photosynthesis). Differences in glucosinolate hydrolysis products were directly confirmed. Overall, prediction of
protein abundances from transcript profiles was stronger than prediction of transcript abundance from protein profiles.
Protein profiles also proved to be more accurate predictors of glucosinolate profiles than transcript profiles. The
similarity of species profiles for both transcripts and proteins reflected previously inferred phylogenetic relationships
while glucosinolate chemotypes did not.
Conclusions: We have used transcript and protein profiling to predict physiological processes that evolved differently
during diversification of three Pachycladon species. This approach has also identified candidate genes potentially
important in adaptation, which are now the focus of ongoing study. Our results indicate that protein profiling provides
a valuable tool for validating transcript profiles in studies of adaptive divergence.
Background
It has been postulated that genes of co-ordinated function that offer an organism some selective advantage
(adaptive gene sets) might be identifiable in studies that
examine differential gene expression (DGE) across species ranges and heterogeneous environments [1,2]. Similarly, DGE studies that compare expression profiles of
closely related species, such as those that have formed
during Late Tertiary radiation of New Zealand's alpine
genera, might also help to identify candidate genes that

have played a role in species diversification. To investigate this approach, in an earlier study we compared
microarray expression profiles for natural populations of
two closely related alpine plant species from the largely
endemic New Zealand genus Pachycladon (Brassicaceae).
Analyses of logfold ratios and ontology analyses in this
experiment suggested that secondary metabolite profiles
differed among and between populations of these two
species. HPLC-UV/GC-MS analyses confirmed these
predictions, leading to the hypothesis that herbivory was
a major driver of diversification of P. fastigiatum and P.
enysii [3]. These results provided encouragement that
transcriptome profiling used in a predictive sense pro-

vided a promising approach for helping to identify putative adaptations between closely related species.
However, a potential shortcoming with this approach is
that gene expression differences between species may
also result from genetic drift [4]. Moreover, due to posttranslational modifications, transcript abundances may
not correlate with protein abundances [5]. Profiling of
proteomes, which have different underlying evolutionary
dynamics from transcriptomes [6], provides an alternative approach for the prediction of downstream physiological processes. In the present study we have compared
findings from gene expression profiles obtained using
heterologous microarrays [3] with findings from protein
expression profiles generated by shotgun proteomics.
During shotgun proteomics, proteins levels are calculated
by determining the number of spectral counts that identify a protein [7] and proteins are identified by searching
MS-MS spectra of peptides against reference protein data
bases. Our aim was to determine to what extent gene
expression profiles were indicative of protein expression
profiles and vice versa, and to evaluate both methods
with respect to their potential for predicting physiological
differences among New Zealand Pachycladon species.
For this purpose, we also characterized glucosinolate
chemotypes and evaluated the extent to which these were
predicted from the protein and transcript expression
data.
The genus Pachycladon is of allopolyploid origin (< 2
Mya:[8]) and has diversified into ten morphologically and
ecologically diverse species within the last million years.
Nine of the species are endemic to the Southern Alps of
New Zealand and one is native to Tasmania. The nine
New Zealand species form three distinct groups distinguished by their genetic characteristics, morphological
features and habitat preferences [9]. Species differ markedly in their preference for certain soil types. For example, the group consisting of P. novae-zelandiae and P.
wallii are restricted to soils derived from schist whereas
another group consisting of P. fastigiatum, P. enysii and P.
stellatum are confined to greywacke soils. There are also
the limestone specialist P. fasciarium and the basicole P.
exile. The remaining two species, P. cheesemanii and P.
latisiliquum are geological generalists. These preferences
have led to the hypothesis that adaptation to different
soils has to a large part driven diversification and evolution of distinct Pachycladon species. Since species also
differ in their altitudinal ranges [10], adaptation to different altitudes has been suggested as another possible
driver of diversification.
In this study, we compared three Pachycladon species
with distinct ecological attributes. These species were P.
cheesemanii (CH), P. exile (EX) and P. novae-zelandiae
(NZ). The former two are sister species [9] and resemble
close overseas Pachycladon relatives Transberingia and

Crucihimalaya [11]. P. cheesemanii and P. exile are both
polycarpic perennials with a woody caudex, exhibit leaf
heterophylly with ovate to broadly elliptic early (basal)
leaves with branched hairs on the lamina and petiole and
serrate to lobed later (cauline) leaves; they have slender
and terminal inflorescences and narrow petals and terete
(cylindrical) siliques with uniseriate wingless seeds. P.
exile is much smaller in all parts than P. cheesemanii. P.
cheesemanii occurs along a wide altitudinal range (101600 m) on greywacke, semi-schist, schist and plutonics
substrates, it is a true generalist. P. exile is a lowland species (25-500 m) that grows on base-rich soils. It was previously recorded from a few sites in Central Otago but is
now known with certainty from only one limestone site
and has recently been classified as nationally critical in
New Zealand [12]. P. novae-zelandiae is also a polycarpic
perennial with a semi-woody caudex but is morphologically distinct from P. cheesemanii and P. exile. It does not
produce heteroblastic leaves. Rather it produces oblong
to elliptic leaves that are either lobed or crenate and are
either hairy (simple or branched trichomes) or glabrous;
it has lateral inflorescences, and laterally compressed
siliques with biseriate wingless seeds. P. novae-zelandiae
grows at much higher altitudes (1080-2031 m) and is confined to schist soils. In summary, P. cheesemanii and P.
exile are morphologically similar, lower altitude species
that are very closely related but which differ in their soil
substrate specificities (generalist and basicole respectively). In contrast, P. novae-zelandiae is a more distantly
related alpine species restricted to schist. Given their different ecologies and degrees of relatedness, the three species are expected to differ in their gene and protein
expression profiles. In the instances that protein profiles
corroborate inferences from comparative transcript analyses, these observations have been used to predict physiological differences between species as well as candidate
genes for adaptive diversification.

Results
Transcriptome - proteome correlations

To investigate the extent to which transcriptional patterns were congruent with protein expression patterns,
we calculated correlation coefficients for 1074 genes surveyed by both transcript and protein profiling (table 1, A).
Given the non-normal distributions of both the log2
spectral abundance factors and the log2 fluorescence
intensities, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Each species' proteome correlated most strongly
with its own transcriptome with the highest correlation
observed in P. cheesemanni (0.52) and the lowest in P.
novae-zelandiae (0.34). The transcript profile (for 1074
genes) for each species correlated most strongly with the
proteome (for 1074 genes) of P. cheesemanii. This was
largely due to the fact that the three transcriptomes cor-

related very strongly with one another (0.74-0.91, table 1,
B) and the P. cheesemanii transcriptome had the highest
correlation with its own proteome. The three proteomes
correlated much more weakly with each other (0.59-0.75,
table 1, C) than did the three transcriptomes, indicating
greater differences between the protein profiles than
between the transcript profiles. Correlations between
both transcriptomes and proteomes mirrored phylogenetic relationships with the profiles of sister species P.
cheesemanii and P. exile being most similar. Interestingly,
both the transcriptome and proteome of P. novae-zelandiae were found to be more similar to those of P. exile
than to those of P. cheesemanii.
Overlap in transcript and protein up-regulation

For each of the three Pachycladon species, we identified
up- and down-regulated transcripts and proteins using
linear model analysis and Wilcoxon rank and t-tests,
respectively. The number of up- and down-regulated
transcripts and proteins are summarized in table 2 and
gene identifiers, descriptions, transcript and protein
expression statistics are provided in additional file 1, table
S1. We compared expression in each species with expression in the other two species combined (6 group comparisons) and separately (6 pair wise comparisons). For
example, expression in CH was compared to expression
in EX+NZ (group comparison) but also to EX and NZ
separately (pair wise comparisons). For each of the twelve
comparisons, we intersected the lists of up-regulated
transcripts with lists of up-regulated proteins and found
significant overlap (i.e. different from random expectations given the size of our data sets) in seven cases (figure
1). The extent of overlap between transcript and protein
profiles is limited partially as a result of relative sizes of
the different data sets (transcript data set: 9404 genes,
protein data set: 1489 genes, overlap of both data sets:
1074 genes). For example, of the 371 transcripts up-regulated in P. cheesemanii when compared with NZ+EX
combined, only 126 were present in the protein data set.
This means the 29 genes found up-regulated by both
transcript and protein profiling in P. cheesemanii repre-

sent an overlap of 23% (29 of 126). Conversely, of the 124
proteins up-regulated in P. cheesemanii only 90 were
present in the transcript data set. In this case we have
found 32% (29 of 90) of the transcripts maximally identifiable by transcript profiling. Interestingly, across the
three Pachycladon species, an average of 23.6% of the
transcript patterns were confirmed by protein patterns
(average of upper percentages in figure 1) whereas on
average only 12.6% of the protein patterns were predicted
by transcript patterns (average of lower percentages in
figure 1). These percentages did differ greatly between
species (figure 1). Transcript patterns were best confirmed by proteins patterns in P. novae-zelandiae (average of 30.2%) and protein patterns were best confirmed
by transcript patterns in P. cheesemanii (average of
24.5%). The disagreement of transcript and protein profiling remaining after correcting for different numbers of
genes captured by both analyses presumably is explained
by the different kinetics of protein and transcript accumulation and degradation.
Our goal was to identify genes specifically up- and
down-regulated in each species with respect to the other
two (group comparisons) in the set of 1074 genes that
were covered by both transcript and protein profiling. In
these comparisons the greatest overlap between transcript and protein profiles was found for P. cheesemanii
(29 genes up-regulated, 2 genes down-regulated), followed by P. exile (4 genes up-regulated, 4 genes downregulated) and P. novae-zelandiae (8 genes up-regulated,
no overlap in down-regulation). Gene identifiers,
descriptions, and expression statistics for these are compiled in table 3. From the genes equally identified by both
approaches, some interesting observations and predictions can be derived. For example, three isoforms of carbonic anhydrases were differentially expressed in P.
cheesemanii (At3g01500, AtÎ²CA1, chloroplast-located,
At5g14740, AtÎ²CA2, cytosol-located) and P. novae-zelandiae (At1g23730, AtÎ²CA3, cytosol-located) (table 3).
These genes catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate and have been shown to be involved

Expression of transcripts (T) and proteins (P) in each species (P. cheesemanii, CH, P. exile, EX, P. novae-zelandiae, NZ) was compared with
expression in the remaining two species combined (6 group comparisons) and separately (6 pairwise comparisons). For example, 371
transcripts and 124 proteins were up-regulated in CH when compared with EX and NZ combined and 74 transcripts and 173 proteins were
down-regulated in CH when compared with EX and NZ combined. Sixty nine transcripts and 60 proteins were up-regulated in CH when
compared only to EX and 936 transcripts and 141 proteins were up-regulated in CH when compared only to NZ. The total numbers of
transcripts and proteins investigated by microarray analysis and shotgun proteomics were 9601 and 1489, respectively. Locus IDs, gene
descriptions, logarithmized expression ratios and adjusted p-values of differentially expressed transcripts and proteins for each of the 12
comparison are compiled in additional file 1, table S1.

in photosynthesis, respiration, pH regulation, inorganic
carbon transport, ion transport, and water and electrolyte balance [13]. Other genes found up-regulated by both
approaches in P. cheesemanii are genes involved in translation, photosynthesis light reactions, the calvin cycle,
pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid beta oxidation, serine metabolism, oxidative stress, protein folding and others (table 3). The four commonly up-regulated genes in P.
exile are associated with very different processes such as
Calvin cycle, S-adenosylmethione biosynthetic process,
carbohydrate metabolism and others (table 3). In P.
novae-zelandiae, two genes encoding vegetative storage
proteins are up-regulated which have been implicated in
responses to insects and other stress factors. Also up-regulated in P. novae-zelandiae are genes involved in transport, toxin catabolism and response to oxidative stress
(table 3). Two and four genes were found to be down-regulated by transcript and protein profiling in P. cheesemanii and P. exile, respectively. The former two are
involved in cell wall modification (pectinmethylesterase)
and carbohydrate metabolism (glycosyl hydrolyase) and
the latter four represent the two vegetative storage proteins up-regulated in P. novae-zelandiae, a universal stress
protein and a phosphoglucomutase (table 3). Since none
of the down-regulated transcripts in P. novae-zelandiae

(table 2) were captured by the common set of 1074 genes,
no overlap in down-regulated transcripts and proteins
was observed in P. novae-zelandiae.
Glucosinolate profiles and hydrolysis products

To test how faithfully both transcript and protein expression patterns would predict physiological differences
between species, we examined a trait, which we had previously shown to vary greatly in Pachycladon, namely,
glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis [3]. Glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis genes found to be differentially regulated in the twelve comparisons by either
transcript or protein profiling are summarized in table 4.
Expectations for glucosinolate profiles were that P.
cheesemanii would have higher levels of alkenyl and
hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates (suggested by up-regulation
of AOP2 and AOP3 transcript levels) than P. exile and P.
novae-zelandiae and P. cheesemanii would have higher
levels of four carbon (C4) glucosinolates than P. exile
(suggested by the up-regulation of methylthioalkylmalate
isomerase protein levels, MAM-I, At2g43100) (table 4).
Conflicting predictions were made for P. novae-zelandiae
since the up-regulation of methionine chain elongation
proteins, such as MAM-I (At2g43100) and two proteins
of methylthioalkylmalate dehydrogenase (MAM-D,
At5g14200, At1g31180, [14]) suggests higher levels of C4

Figure 1 Overlap in differential expression patterns from both transcript and protein profiling. Numbers of differentially expressed genes in
P. cheesemanii (CH), P. exile (EX) and P. novae-zelandiae (NZ) identified by transcript (T) profiling, protein profiling (P) or both (TP). Differential expression
is defined as significantly higher or lower expression in one species compared with the other two combined (panel A - 6 group comparisons) or separately (panel B - 6 pair wise comparisons) and was determined by linear model analysis (transcripts) or Wilcoxon rank and t-tests (proteins). Numbers
are corrected for relative sizes of transcript and protein data sets. In other words, only a subset of all differentially expressed transcripts and proteins is
given. This subset consists of genes found amongst the 1074 loci surveyed by both transcript and protein profiling. For a summary of all differentially
expressed transcripts and proteins refer to table 2. Upper percentages depict the proportion of transcripts confirmed by protein analysis and lower
percentages depict the proportion of proteins confirmed by transcript analysis (see text for details). Statistically significant overlap (p value < 0.05%)

glucosinolates in P. novae-zelandiae than in the other two
species. However, up-regulation of MAM-I and methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM1, At5g23010) transcript
levels in P. cheesemanii when compared to P. novae-zelandiae suggests higher levels of C4 glucosinolates in the former (table 4). Contradictory predictions were also
derived for P. exile, as up-regulation of MAM1 transcripts
indicated higher C4 levels in P. exile than in P. novaezelandiae and down-regulation of MAM-I proteins suggested higher levels of C4 glucosinolates in P. novaezelandiae and P. cheesemanii when compared to P. exile
(table 4). To verify these predictions we analyzed glucosinolate profiles in the same specimens that had been
used for transcript and protein profiling. Fourteen compounds were identified across the three species (additional file 2, figure S1). Interestingly, P. cheesemanii and P.

exile had very distinct glucosinolate profiles whereas P.
cheesemanii and P. novae-zelandiae, despite being less
closely related than P. cheesemanii and P. exile, shared
their two major compounds allyl and S -2-hydroxy-3butenyl glucosinolate (figure 2). This high similarity in
glucosinolate profiles between P. cheesemanii and P.
novae-zelandiae was also surprising given that P. cheesemanii and P. exile had been found to have more similar
transcript and protein profiles than P. cheesemanii and P.
novae-zelandiae (table 1). P. exile did produce almost no
alkenyl glucosinolates (allyl, 3-butenyl, S-2-hydroxy-3butenyl combined) and P. cheesemanii and P. novaezelandiae did not differ significantly in their production
of alkenyl glucosinolates (85 Î¼mol/g vs. 77.8 Î¼mol/g, p
value >0.05) (additional file 2, figure S1). Thus the prediction from AOP2 gene expression suggesting higher levels

Locus, description, log fold change (logFC), and gene ontology terms (biological process) for genes found specifically up- and down-regulated
in P. cheesemanii, P. exile and P. novae-zelandiae when compared to the two remaining species combined. Only genes for which both transcripts
(T) and proteins (P) have been found to be differentially expressed are listed (P. cheesemanii: 29 up-regulated genes, 2 down-regulated genes; P.
exile: 4 up-regulated genes, 4 down-regulated genes; P. novae-zelandiae: 8 up-regulated genes; compare Venn diagrams in left panel of figure 1).

of alkenyl glucosinolates in P. cheesemanii when compared to P. exile and P. novae-zelandiae was only fulfilled
for P. exile. Hydroxy alkenyl glucosinolates were not
detected in any of the three species contrary to the upregulation of AOP3 transcripts in P. cheesemanii. As previously discussed [3], AOP3 expression might be an artefact of cross-hybridization of AOP2 transcripts with the
AOP3 probe and as such constitute a drawback of using a
heterologous microarray. P. novae-zelandiae however
produced slightly more C4 glucosinolates than P. cheesenmanii (59 Î¼mol/g vs 48 Î¼mol/g, p value = 0.059, additional file 2, figure S1) and also accumulated three
additional C4 glucosinolates (4-methylthiobutyl, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl, 3butenyl) compared to P. cheesemanii
which only accumulated the C4 compound S-2-hydroxy3 butenyl glucosinolate (figure 2). P. exile did not produce
any C4 glucosinolates. Thus the differential expression of
MAM-I and the two MAM-D proteins (up in P. novaezelandiae, up in P. cheesemanii, down in P. exile) proved
to be a reliable indicator of metabolite profiles whereas
up-regulation of MAM-I transcripts in P. cheesemanii
and MAM1 transcripts in P. exile did not. Neither array
nor protein profiling captured the expression of 2oxoacid-dependent dioxygenase which has recently been
shown to catalyze the production of 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl
glucosinolates from 3-butenyl glucosinolates [15] and
which we predict to be up-regulated in P. cheesemanii and
P. novae-zelandiae when compared with P. exile.
Expectations for glucosinolate hydrolysis were that during glucosinolate hydrolysis P. exile would produce isothiocyanates (predicted by up-regulation of ESM1
transcripts, At3g14210, and down-regulation of ESP proteins, At1g54040) and P. novae-zelandiae would produce

nitriles (predicted by strong up-regulation of the ESP
protein, At1g54040 and the down-regulation of ESM1
transcripts, At3g14210) (table 4). There were no particular expectations for P. cheesemanii although in the
absence of myrosinase-associated enzymes, glucosinolates will most likely convert into isothiocyanates. Interestingly, transcript and protein profiling revealed other
myrosinase-associated genes to be up-regulated in P. exile
(At1g54000, At1g54010, At1g54030) and P. novae-zelandiae (At1g54000, At1g54030, At3g14220) and down-regulated in P. cheesemanii (At1g54000), P. exile (At3g14220)
and P. novae-zelandiae (At1g54030) (table 4). All of these
additional loci are located in close proximity to ESP
(At1g54040) or ESM1 (At3g14210) in A. thaliana. Due to
being recently classified as nationally critical in New Zealand, no plants of P. exile were available for glucosinolate
hydrolysis analysis. However, the comparison of glucosinolate hydrolysis products of P. cheesemanii and P.
novae-zelandiae, confirmed our predictions. Both species
have the same major glucosinolates but whereas in P.
cheesemanii all compounds hydrolyzed into isothiocyanates, in P. novae-zelandiae, the two major compounds
were converted into their corresponding nitriles and epithionitriles (table 5). This ESP-associated polymorphism
in glucosinolate hydrolysis products had been found earlier in two other closely related Pachycladon species,
namely P. enysii (up-regulates ESP and produces nitriles)
and P. fastigiatum (up-regulates ESM1 and produces isothiocyanates) [3]. However, P. enysii and P. fastigiatum's
glucosinolate profiles were different from those of P.
cheesemanii and P. novae-zelandiae in that both of the
latter produced S-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl, a compound neither present in P. enysii nor P. fastigiatum. The strong dif-

ferential expression of myrosinase-associated transcripts
and proteins is consistent with the hypothesis that glucosinolate hydrolysis has been under selection during the
divergence of Pachycladon species.
In summary, predictions of glucosinolate metabolism
from protein profiling were more accurate than predictions from transcript profiling. Based on protein profiles
we predicted that P. novae-zelandiae would accumulate
more C4 glucosinolates than the other two species and
would produce nitriles in hydrolysis instead of isothiocyanates. Both predictions were confirmed. In contrast, the
prediction from transcript profiles that P. cheesemanii
would produce more alkenyl glucosinolates than P. novaezelandiae and P. exile was only validated for P. exile.

Discussion
In this study we compared protein profiles with transcript
profiles for three species of New Zealand alpine Pachycladon. We employed a heterologous approach to obtain
both transcript and protein profiles using Arabidopsis
microarrays for transcript quantification and the Arabidopsis genome as a reference for the quantification of
peptide spectra. Such a heterologous approach may limit
the number of transcripts and proteins that can be unambiguously identified and whose expression can be reliably
quantified. Thus we cannot rule out that these limitations
contributed to some of the incongruence we found
between transcript and protein patterns. However, the
fact that we obtained both transcript and protein data for
a set of 1074 genes and that we found significant correlations and overlap in differential transcript and protein
expression demonstrates that the benefits of using heterologous approaches outweigh their drawbacks. Heterologous microarray studies have long been perceived as a
valuable tool for the study of species diversity [16]. Our
study is one of the first that combines the use of heterologous microarrays with heterologous shotgun proteomics
in the context of ecological prediction.
We adopted two approaches to estimate congruence
between transcript and protein profiles. First, we determined 'overall congruence' through correlations of transcript and protein abundance for a set of 1074 genes
surveyed by both microarray analyses and shotgun proteomics. These correlations differed between species and
the highest correlation was found in P. cheesemanii (0.52).
The coefficients we observed were consistent with those
found in other, non-plant systems (0.2-0.5, [17,18]). We
then determined congruence in differential expression by
investigating down- stream prediction (from transcriptome to proteome) and up-stream prediction (from proteome to transcriptome). We found that transcript
patterns predicted protein patterns best in P. novaezelandiae (30.2%), followed by P. exile (20%) and P.
cheesemanii (19.2%). Up-stream prediction was on aver-

Page 8 of 15

age much weaker (12.6%) than down-stream prediction
(23.6%), and the results differed markedly between the
three species (P. cheesemanii 24.5%, followed by P. exile
10% and P. novae-zelandiae 3.2%). Given considerable
incongruence of transcript and protein patterns, we suggest that for the prediction of physiologies consideration
needs to be given to both transcript and protein profiles.
Although more minor in scope than transcript profiling,
protein profiling not only proved to be a valuable tool for
validation of transcript profiling but, in this study, was
also a more accurate predictor of metabolite patterns
than transcript profiling.
Interestingly, proteomes were more dissimilar between
species than transcriptomes. This may be due to different
protein turnover rates in these species, or it may be
explained as a consequence of a greater divergence of the
species' proteomes. In other words, depending on downstream processes such as translation, post-transcriptional
modification and protein degradation, relatively similar
transcription profiles may give rise to relatively dissimilar
protein profiles. Thus small differences in transcript levels may manifest themselves in large differences in protein levels and vice versa, which may also be an
explanation for the relatively large degree of discordance
between transcript and protein profiles. Transcript and
protein profiles largely mirrored inferred phylogenetic
relatedness among species [8,9] with the profiles of P.
cheesemanii and P. exile being more similar to each other
than each was to the profiles of P. novae-zelandiae. Interestingly, P. cheesemanii and P. novae-zelandiae had more
similar glucosinolate profiles than did P. cheesemanii and
P. exile. The former species shared their main two compounds allyl and S-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl. P. exile neither
produced alkenyl nor C4 glucosinolates, thus its profile is
most similar to that of the P. fastigiatum chemotype 2 [3].
In contrast to P. cheesemanii and P. exile, P. novae-zelandiae produced a complex blend of glucosinolates. The
finding that similarity patterns in glucosinolate profiles
do not correspond to phylogenetic relationships might be
explained by selection for glucosinolate metabolism during diversification of Pachycladon species, and is an
hypothesis that requires further investigation.
In the present study, a number of candidate genes have
been identified as having been potentially important during diversification of Pachycladon species. These include
myrosinase-binding proteins two of which, namely, ESP
(At1g54040) and ESM1 (At3g14210) have been shown to
direct glucosinolate hydrolysis towards nitriles and isothiocyanates and thus directly affect the toxicity and palatability of plant tissue to herbivores [19,20]. We found
the ESP protein up-regulated in P. novae-zelandiae (and
confirmed nitrile- and epithionitrile-specifying activity)
along with genes that in A. thaliana are physically linked
to ESP, such as At1g54030 and At1g54000, as well as

Loci involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis (italicised) found up-regulated in each of the twelve comparisons by either transcript
or protein profiling. Glucosinolate biosynthesis: At4g03050 (oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase 3, AOP3) and At4g03060 (oxoglutarate
dependent dioxygenase 2, AOP2) catalyze the accumulation of hydroxyalkyl and alkenyl glucosinolates, respectively. At5g23010
(methylthioalkylmalate synthase), At2g43100 (methylthioalkylmalate isomerase), At5g14200 (methylthioalkylmalate dehydrogenase), and
At1g31180 (methylthioalkylmalate dehydrogenase) are involved in the chain elongation of methionine and thus can be considered indicators
for the accumulation of C4 glucosinolates as opposed to C3 glucosinolates. Glucosinolate hydrolysis: At3g14210 (epithiospecifier modifier 1,
ESM1) and At1g54040 (epithiospecifier proteins, ESP) determine the outcome of glucosinolate hydrolysis in that ESP is necessary for nitrile
formation whereas ESM1 promotes the formation of isothiocyanates. Other myrosinase-binding/associated proteins (At1g54000, At1g54010,
At1g54030, At3g14220) whose biological function remains to be determined are also found up-regulated in some of the species. Loci whose
expression is in agreement with profiles of glucosinolates (figure 2, additional file 2, figure S1) and glucosinolate hydrolysis products (table 5) are
highlighted in bold.

At3g14220 which is physically linked to ESM1. In P. exile,
there was evidence for up-regulation of At1g54000,
At1g54010, At1g54030 and ESM1. Given previous observations [3] of up-regulation of ESM1 in P. fastigiatum
(and confirmed isothiocyanate-specifying activity),
At1g54030 and At1g54020 in P. fastigiatum and ESP in P.
enysii (and confirmed nitrile-specifying activity), we
hypothesize that at least two gene clusters have been
under selection during Pleistocene species radiation of
Pachycladon [8]. These two clusters correspond to five
loci on A. thaliana chromosome one (At1g54000At1g54040) and two loci on chromosome three
(At3g14210, At3g14220) which are all annotated as myro-

sinase-associated proteins. We have begun to characterize both clusters in several Pachycladon species regarding
their gene structure and nucleotide diversity patterns.
Other genes of potential adaptive significance in Pachycladon are genes which mediate differences in the glucosinolate profiles of Arabidopsis. These include
methylthioalkylmalate synthase (At5g23010), methylthioalkylmalate isomerases (At2g43100, At3g58990) and
methylthioalkylmalate dehydrogenases (At5g14200,
At1g31180), which specify side chain lengths of aliphatic
glucosinolates and oxo-acid-dependent-dioxygenases
which catalyze the synthesis of alkenyl (At4g03060) and
hydroxyalkenyl (At2g25450) glucosinolates. Their poten-

tial importance in divergence of Pachycladon species is
suggested in the present study by the up-regulation of
At2g43100, At1g31180 and At5g14200 in P. novae-zelandiae and of At4g03060 and At2g43100 in P. cheesemanii.
Previous findings of up-regulation of At5g23010,
At2g43100,
At3g58990,
At5g14200,
At1g31180,
At4g03060 in P. enysii [3], as well as the presence of strikingly different glucosinolate profiles among Pachycladon
species (this study and [3]) are also consistent with an
hypothesis of adaptive diversification of glucosinolate
metabolism
in
Pachycladon.
In addition to the potential significance of glucosinolate
biosynthesis and hydrolysis genes during Pachycladon
diversification, we observed expression patterns that may
be indicative of ecophysiological differences among
Pachycladon species. For example, the up-regulation of
different beta carbonic anhydrase genes in P. cheesemanii
(At3g01500, AtÎ²CA1, chloroplast-located, At5g14740,
AtÎ²CA2, cytosol-located, [13]) and P. novae-zelandiae
(At1g23730, AtÎ²CA3, cytosol-located, [13]) suggests differential recruitment of carbonic anhydrases during
Pachycladon diversification and regulation of physiological processes requiring the interconversion of carbon
dioxide and bicarbonate. Chloroplast isoforms may contribute to maintenance of adequate carbon dioxide concentration for Rubisco whereas cytoplasmic isoforms
may provide bicarbonate to phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase [21]. This is the primary carboxylating enzyme
in C4 and CAM plants and is also an enzyme replenishing
tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in leaves of C3
plants [21]. Reports of co-localization of carbonic anhydrases with phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase and
pyruvate kinase in roots indicate a role of carbonic anhydrases in re-assimilation of carbon dioxide into metabolic
intermediates also in non-photosynthetic tissues [21].
Thus the differential expression of three beta carbonic
anhydrases suggests that P. novae-zelandiae and P.
cheesemanii may regulate carbon dioxide and bicarbonate supply to Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase differently.
Interestingly, a suite of genes up-regulated in P. cheesemanii have recently been found important in the drought
responses of Populus genotypes that exhibit contrasting
leaf carbon isotope discrimination measurements (an
estimate of intrinsic water use efficiency, [22]). These are
genes involved in oxidative stress (ascorbate peroxidase
and 2 cys peroxiredoxin) and protein folding (20kDa
chloroplastic chaperonin (table 3, [22]). Other genes
involved in drought response in Populus were genes
involved in carbon fixation (chloroplast glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase B), photosynthesis (oxygen
evolving enhancer 1), ATP synthesis (chloroplast ATP
synthase alpha) and protein folding (heat shock cognate
70kDa protein). Up-regulated in P. cheesemanii was a

Page 10 of 15

similar set of genes: for carbon fixation (chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A subunit 2),
photosynthesis (oxygen evolving enhancer 3), ATP synthesis (chloroplast ATP synthase gamma) and protein
folding (chaperonin 60). In Populus, abundances of some
proteins, amongst them a mitochondrial succinyl CoA
ligase protein, was found to be correlated with leaf carbon
isotope discrimination [22]. The same gene is among the
few genes specifically up-regulated in P. exile (table 3).
Oxidative stress genes and chloroplast-localized molecular chaperones have also been found up-regulated or constitutively higher expressed in drought resistant
genotypes of potato [23] and barley [24]. Among these
were homologues of glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione transporters which were also up-regulated in P.
novae-zealandiae as well as a homologue of thioredoxin
which was up-regulated in P. cheesemanii. Given that
many elements of the transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of drought response in Populus, Solanum and
Hordeum are found in differential transcript and protein
patterns of Pachycladon, we hypothesize differences in
drought resistance and water use efficiency between
Pachcyladon species. These differences may have evolved
in response to differences in soil water availability
between species' habitats. Based on our findings we have
initiated comparisons of carbon dioxide assimilation
rates and carbon isotope discrimination to characterize
photosynthesis and water use efficiency in Pachycladon.
Furthermore, efforts are underway to measure soil moisture levels and other environmental parameters at native
Pachycladon sites.
Other genes potentially interesting for species diversification in Pachycladon are serine racemase (At4g11640,
up-regulated in P. cheesemanii ) and two vegetative storage proteins (At5g24770, At5g24780, up-regulated in P.
novae-zelandiae, down -regulated in P. exile ). However,
their biological roles in plant metabolism are not fully
understood, hindering the interpretation of their differential expression in Pachyladon in the context of diversification. Serine racemase is primarily expressed in
elongating and developing cells such as root tips, developing leaves and shoot meristems in A. thaliana [25]. The
enzyme has been demonstrated to have a higher dehydration than racemisation activity leading to the hypothesis
that it has a role in providing pyruvate from serine in
highly dividing cells. Pyruvate is a key metabolic intermediate of many pathways, such as glycolysis and the biosynthesis of amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids.
Thus, similarly to carbonic anydrase, serine racemase
may act in the regeneration of metabolic intermediates.
One of the vegetative storage proteins (At5g24770) has
been shown to have an 'anti-insect' activity that is associated with its phosphatase activity, and is primarily
expressed in Arabidopsis flowers. It is induced by wound-

ing, methyl jasmonate, phosphate deprivation and insect
feeding and assumed to also play a role in temporary
amino acid storage [26]. Given these multiple roles in abiotic and biotic stress responses, the preferential expression in P. novae-zelandiae may confer this species an
advantage in coping with stress compared to P. exile and
P. cheesemanii.

Conclusion
In summary, although shotgun proteomics provided
information on fewer genes than transcript profiling, it
provided a valuable means for validating high throughput
gene expression data and predicting physiological attri-

butes of plants. The combined application of transcript
and protein profiling has allowed us to identify candidate
genes potentially important in adaptive diversification. In
Pachycladon we identified genes with confirmed or predicted roles in glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis,
carbon dioxide bicarbonate conversion, water use efficiency and general stress-related processes. From these
gene sets we predict that adaptation to herbivores and
pathogens and soil moisture have been important in driving diversification of Pachycladon species. Differences in
photosynthesis and carbon fixation may indicate selection for different growth rates. Characterization of gene
clusters, physiological and habitat differences in Pachycladon are underway to follow up predictions from this
comparative profiling study. Microarray analyses of
Pachycladon roots are also underway to help test the
hypothesis that adaptation to different soil types has been
a major driver of diversification in Pachycladon.

Methods
Sampling

Five Pachycladon species were initially sampled (P.
cheesemanii: accession Bob's cove, CH; P. exile: accession
Awahokomo, EX; P. novae-zelandiae: accession Old man
range, NZ; P. fastigiatum, accession Serpentine creek, FA;
P. enysii, accession: Avalanche peak, PE). Seeds were
stratified at 4Â°C for a week and then germinated on potting soil in early July 2007. Plants were grown in shade
houses at Landcare Research (Lincoln, NZ) for seven
months. In February 2008, roots and above-ground plant
tissues of each plant were separately flash frozen and
ground in liquid nitrogen. Ground material was partially
allocated to RNA analysis and partially freeze-dried for
protein and metabolite analysis. Replicate plant numbers
were as follows: CH, n = 12; EX, n = 13; NZ, n = 12; FA, n
= 8; EN, n = 8. P. cheesemanii, P. exile and P. novae-zelandiae were grown until all three species started producing
their first seeds. By sampling leaves, flowers and siliques
we expected to increase the probability of capturing
expression differences. P. fastigiatum and P. enysii were
harvested in rosette stage to enable a valid comparison
with a previous field study [3]. Here we will only report
the results for the comparisons of the three fruiting species (CH, EX, NZ) whereas the results for the P. enysii - P.
fastigiatum comparison will be reported elsewhere.
Five descendants of one P. cheesemanii (from Bob's

Note that P. novae-zelandiae is capable of converting its main glucosinoalates (S-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl and allyl) into its corresponding nitriles ((S)3-hydroxy-pent-4-enenitril) and epithionitriles (diastereomers 1 and 2 of (S)-3-hydroxy-3-((R, S)-thiiran-2-yl)propanenitril, 2-((R, S)-thiiran-2yl)ethanenitril) whereas P. cheesemanii is not. Despite minor glucosinolates being converted to isothiocyanates in P. novae-zelandiae, 65% of its
glucosinolate breakdown products are nitriles/epithionitriles. In P. cheesemanii, 99.5% of glucosinolates are converted to isothiocyanates
indicating nitrile/epithionitrile forming activity in P. novae-zelandiae but not P. cheesemanii.

servation status to 'nationally critical' [12] prevented the
collection of further plants in the wild.
Microarray analysis

RNA was isolated, quantified and quality checked as
described in [3] separately for each plant and subsequently pooled for each species. CDNA synthesis, labelling and hybridization were done according to [27]. An
Arabidopsis thaliana genome-wide array (spotted with
the AROS version 1.0 genome set available from Operon
Biotechnologies) was provided by Plant and Food
Research (Auckland, NZ). The array had been successfully used in heterologous hybridizations involving FA
and EN previously [3]. Hybridizations with DNA from P.
enysii, P. fastigiatum and P. novae-zelandiae yielded no
differences in signal intensities across species [3]. Moreover, sequence divergence between P. exile and P. fastigia-

tum, the most distant species in the Pachycladon
radiation, has been found to be less than one per cent
(0.0088 Â± 0.0016 substitutions/site, unpublished data).
The diversification of Pachycladon has been estimated to
have occurred within the last 0.8 mya [8] which is consistent with the low level of genetic divergence between species. For these reasons, we did not expect the genetic
distance between individual Pachycladon genomes to
contribute to the differences in gene expression measured
using A. thaliana microarrays. A total of 36 two channel
microarrays were hybridized: five root samples were
hybridized in a loop-wise fashion using ten arrays; five
leave samples were hybridized in a loop-like fashion using
fourteen arrays; five root and three leaf samples were
hybridized in a loop-like fashion using twelve arrays
(additional file 3, table S2). Each sample was thus hybridized multiple times while being labelled either with Cy3

Voelckel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/151

or Cy5 (additional file 3, table S2). Data analysis used the
R-based package limma [28]. The statistical analysis made
use of three loop designs (additional file 3, table S2)
involving additional replicates for some species. All 36
arrays were subjected to data pre-processing, e.g. filtering
of low intensity signals, background correction, within
array normalization and between array normalization.
Linear models were fitted to the log2 Cy5/Cy3 ratios separately for each gene. Since the focus of this study was on
CH, EX and NZ, the number of differentially expressed
genes was calculated for six contrasts. These contrasts
involve all pair wise comparisons between the three species (CH vs. EX, EX vs. NZ, CH vs. NZ) as well as comparisons of each species against the remaining two
species combined (CH vs. EX+NZ, EX vs. CH+NZ, NZ
vs. CH+EX). Each of the six contrasts was determined
three times using different pre-processing parameters
(data not shown) and the number of differentially
expressed genes was determined conservatively by
reporting only those genes that had been identified as differentially expressed in all three analyses. P-values were
adjusted using the method by Benjamini and Hochberg
[29] as implemented in limma. Microarray data have
been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus genomics data repository hosted by NCBI (GEO accession nr:
GSE19017).
Shotgun proteomics

Three randomly selected plants of each species (CH, EX,
NZ, FA, EN) were selected to provide triplicates for proteome analysis.
Protein extraction and SDS-PAGE

20 mg freeze dried leaf powder was suspended in 600 Î¼l
of 10% TCA in acetone, 0.07% Î²-mercaptoethanol, and
incubated at -20Â°C for 45 minutes. The extract was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 16,000 Ã g, and the pellet was
collected and washed with 600 Î¼l 100% acetone followed
by the centrifugation for 30 minutes at 16,000 Ã g. The
acetone washing step was repeated three times for the
complete removal of pigments, lipids and other lipophilic
molecules. The colourless resulting pellet was lyophilized
in a vacuum centrifuge and protein quantification was
performed by Bradford assay. Extracted proteins in
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (50 Î¼g per
well) were separated on 7.5% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels
at 180 V for 1 h. After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized using Coomassie Blue. The gels were then washed
twice in water (10 min per wash), before individual lanes
were cut into 16 slices of equal sizes from top to bottom.
Proteins in each slice were reduced, alkylated and subjected to trypsin digestion as previously described [30].
Nanoflow liquid chromatography - tandem mass

spectrometer (Thermo, CA, USA). Reversed phase columns were packed in-house to approximately 7 cm (100
Î¼m i.d.) using 100 Ã, 5 mM Zorbax C18 resin (Agilent
Technologies, CA, USA) in a fused silica capillary with an
integrated electrospray tip. A 1.8 kV electrospray voltage
was applied via a liquid junction up-stream of the C18
column. Samples were injected onto the C18 column
using a Surveyor autosampler (Thermo, CA, USA). Each
sample was loaded onto the C18 column followed by initial wash step with buffer A (5% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) for 10 min at 1 Î¼L min-1. Peptides were
subsequently eluted from the C18 column with 0%-50%
Buffer B (95% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) over 58
min at 500 nL min-1 followed by 50-95% Buffer B over 5
min at 500 nL min-1. The column eluate was directed into
a nanospray ionization source of the mass spectrometer.
Spectra were scanned over the range 400-1500 amu.
Automated peak recognition, dynamic exclusion, and
tandem MS of the top six most intense precursor ions at
35% normalization collision energy were performed using
the Xcalibur software (version 2.06) (Thermo, CA, USA)
[30].
Protein identification

Raw files were converted to mzXML format and processed through the global proteome machine (GPM) software using version 2.1.1 of the X!Tandem algorithm,
freely available from http://www.thegpm.org[31,32]. For
each experiment, the 16 fractions were processed
sequentially with output files for each individual fraction,
and a merged, non-redundant output file was generated
for protein identifications with log (e) values less than -1.
MSMS spectra were searched against the A. thaliana
protein database within GPM containing 30480 protein
sequences as of April 2008. The database also incorporated common human and trypsin peptide contaminants.
The search was performed against a reversed sequence
database to evaluate the false discovery rate (FDR).
Search parameters included MS and MS/MS tolerances
of Â± 2 Da and Â± 0.2 Da, tolerance of up to 3 missed tryptic
cleavages and K/R-P cleavages. Fixed modifications were
set for carbamidomethylation of cysteine and variable
modifications were set for oxidation of methionine. Only
proteins that were present in all replicates and had a minimum of 2 peptides were included in further analysis.
After filtering, protein level false discovery rates were calculated at less than 1% (M. Mirzaei, D. Pascovici, T.
Keighley, C. Voelckel, P. B. Heenan, P. A. Haynes: Shotgun
proteomic profiling of five species of New Zealand Pachycladon, submitted).
Quantitative proteomic analysis

Protein abundance data were calculated based on normal
spectral abundance factor (NSAF) values as described
previously [7]. For each sample, i, the number of spectral
counts (SpC ) identifying a protein, k, was divided by the

Voelckel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/151

molecular weight of the protein in kDa. (SpC/MW)k values were then divided by the sum of (SpC/MW) for all (N
) proteins in the experiments to give the NSAFi values.
Spectral counts identifying more than one isoform of a
gene locus were combined and expressed as NSAF per
locus. For each protein k, the sum S of all spectral counts
obtained from the three replicates was calculated, and the
corresponding NSAFS were deduced and used as a measure of protein abundance. Proteins reproducibly present
in all three replicates of at least one of the five species
were included in further analyses (1489 proteins). Here
we focus on proteome differences between the three
fruiting species CH, EX and NZ. Using NSAFi, we performed Wilcoxon Rank tests to determine species-specific expression (CH vs EX+NZ, EX vs CH+NZ and NZ
vs CH+EX) and t-tests to determine up- and down-regulation in all pair wise comparisons of the three species
(CH vs EX, EX vs NZ, CH vs NZ). The use of t-tests in the
pair wise comparison was possible because once a spectral fraction was added to the spectral count data, the
resulting NSAF values were normally distributed. However, NSAF distributions in the three species comparisons were not sufficiently normal to warrant the
application of a t-test. Hence the Wilcoxon test has been
used instead. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing
using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [29].
Transcript-protein correlations

Correlation of transcript and protein levels was estimated
by correlating abundances of a common set and by intersecting lists of species-specific transcripts and proteins.
For the former approach log2 fluorescence intensities for
transcripts were determined by a separate channel analysis as implemented in the limma package [33]. Three such
analyses with different pre-processing parameters were
done with the most conservative approach yielding log2
fluorescence intensities for 9404 genes. This list was
intersected with the list of 1489 proteins and their respective NSAFS, resulting in a common set of 1074 loci. Given
the non-normal distributions of transcript and protein
data, Spearman-correlation coefficients were calculated
to estimate correlations within transcriptomes, within
proteomes and within transcriptomes and proteomes of
each species. Lists of differentially expressed transcripts
and proteins were obtained as described above and intersected to determine the overlap between them (figure 1).
Statistical significance of this overlap was evaluated by
comparison with a distribution of overlap values generated from 10000 random calculations.
Metabolite analysis
Glucosinolates

For glucosinolate analysis, 100 mg of freeze-dried leave
tissue from 8-13 plants of each of the five species was

Page 14 of 15

extracted with 80% methanol (v:v) and HPLC-UV-quantified after conversion into desulfoglucosinolates as previously described [3]. Only glucosinolate profiles from the
three fruiting species were analyzed. Profiles from individual plants were clustered using Euclidean distance and
the Ward clustering algorithm as implemented in the R
package cluster [34].
Glucosinolate hydrolysis products

Glucosinolates along with their glucosinolate hydrolysis
products were determined from five P. cheesemanii
(accession: Bob's cove) and P. novae-zelandiae (accession:
Old man range) plants after autolysis of fresh plant samples in water, extraction of glucosinolate hydrolysis products into dichloromethane and analysis by gas
chromatography-flame ionisation detection as described
in [3].
