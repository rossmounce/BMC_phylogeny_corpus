Abstract

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R87

information

Conclusion: Expression data suggest specialized roles or subfunctionalization for each PG gene
member. PGs derived from whole genome duplication tend to have more similar expression
patterns than those derived from tandem duplications. Our findings suggest that PG duplicates
underwent rapid expression divergence and that the mechanisms of duplication affect the
divergence rate.

interactions

Results: We found that both tandem and whole-genome duplications contribute significantly to
the expansion of this gene family but are associated with substantial gene losses. In addition, there
are at least 21 PGs in the common ancestor of Arabidopsis and rice. We have also determined the
relationships between Arabidopsis and rice PGs and their expression patterns in Arabidopsis to
provide insights into the functional divergence between members of this gene family. By evaluating
expression in five Arabidopsis tissues and during five stages of abscission, we found overlapping but
distinct expression patterns for most of the different PGs.

refereed research

Background: Polygalacturonases (PGs) belong to a large gene family in plants and are believed to
be responsible for various cell separation processes. PG activities have been shown to be
associated with a wide range of plant developmental programs such as seed germination, organ
abscission, pod and anther dehiscence, pollen grain maturation, fruit softening and decay, xylem cell
formation, and pollen tube growth, thus illustrating divergent roles for members of this gene family.
A close look at phylogenetic relationships among Arabidopsis and rice PGs accompanied by analysis
of expression data provides an opportunity to address key questions on the evolution and functions
of duplicate genes.

Background

The functions and regulation of cell wall hydrolytic enzymes
have intrigued plant scientists for decades. These enzymes
cleave the bonds between the polymers that make up the cell
wall, and include polygalacturonases (PGs), beta-1, 4-endoglucanases, pectate lyases, pectin methylesterases, and
xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases [1]. As a consequence of
their action, cell wall extensibility and cell-cell adhesion can
be altered leading to cell wall loosening that results in cell
elongation, sloughing of cells at the root tip, fruit softening,
and fruit decay [2-4]. Cell separation processes also contribute to important agricultural traits such as pollen dehiscence
and abscission of organs including leaves, floral parts, and
fruits [5-7]. In addition, these enzymes are hypothesized to be
involved in general housekeeping functions in plants [8].
Among these hydrolytic enzymes, the PGs belong to one of the
largest hydrolase families [9,10]. PG activities have been
shown to be associated with a wide range of plant developmental programs such as seed germination, organ abscission,
pod and anther dehiscence, pollen grain maturation, xylem
cell formation, and pollen tube growth [5,11-13]. Over-expression of a PG in apple (Malus domestica) has resulted in alterations in leaf morphology and premature leaf shedding [14].
Interestingly, the functions of PGs are not restricted to the
control of cell growth and development as they are also
reported to be associated with wound responses [15] and
host-parasite interactions [16]. These findings illustrate the
divergent and important roles of PGs in plants.
PGs have been identified in various plants including Arabidopsis, pea and tomato [5,17]. In both tomato and Arabidopsis it has been determined that many PGs are located within
tandem clusters [9,18]. In addition to tandem duplication, the
Arabidopsis genome contains large blocks of related regions
derived from whole genome duplication events [17,19,20]. In
this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of PGs from
Arabidopsis and rice to address several key questions on the
evolution and function of this gene family. We compared the
PGs from Arabidopsis and rice to determine the pattern of
expansion and the extent of PG losses prior and subsequent to
the divergence between these two species. To uncover the
mechanisms that contributed to the expansion of this gene
family, we examined the distribution of PGs on Arabidopsis
chromosomes in conjunction with the large-scale duplicated
blocks. Torki et al. [9] have suggested that a group of related
PGs tend to be expressed in the flowers and flower buds, while
PGs expressed in vegetative tissues belong to other groups.
The implication is that the diverse functions of PGs may be a
consequence of differential expression. This expression
divergence and/or subfunctionalization most likely contribute to the retention of PG duplicates [21,22]. To evaluate the
degree of spatial expression divergence between PGs, we conducted RT-PCR analysis on all 66 Arabidopsis PG genes in
five non-overlapping tissue types. To supplement the RT-PCR
expression data, we also examined expression tags generated

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/9/R87

from other large-scale sequencing projects. Finally, we analyzed expression at five stages of floral organ abscission to
assess the degree of temporal expression divergence among
members of this gene family.

Results and discussion
Expansion of the PG family in Arabidopsis and rice
To investigate the relationships among PGs and the extent of
lineage-specific expansion in rice and Arabidopsis, we identified PGs from the GenBank polypeptide records and the
genomes of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa subsp.
indica). All PGs identified contain GH28 domains that are
approximately 340 amino acids long and encompass approximately 75% of the average PG coding sequence (for lists of
genes used in this analysis, see Figure 1 and Additional data
files 1,2 and 8). According to the phylogenetic relationships of
bacterial, fungal, metazoan, and plant PGs (Additional data
file 3), we found that the 66 Arabidopsis and 59 rice PGs fall
into three distinct groups (Figure 1, groups A, B, and C). Sixteen of the rice PGs contain more than one glycosyl hydrolase
28 (GH28) domain and were regarded as mis-annotated tandem repeats. It should be noted that the rice PGs were derived
from the shotgun sequencing of the O. indica genome that
was estimated to be 95% complete [23]. We identified the
nodes that lead to Arabidopsis-specific and rice-specific
clades and predict that these represent the divergence point
between these two species. We have designated the clades
defined by such nodes as AO (Arabidopsis-Oryza) orthologous groups. For example, in the A3 clade there exists one
Arabidopsis subclade and one rice subclade, and we predict
that only one ancestral A3 sequence was present before the
divergence between Arabidopsis and rice. However, gene
losses could have occurred and therefore some PGs may be
present in the Arabidopsis-rice common ancestor but later
lost in either Arabidopsis or rice (Figure 1, arrowheads).
Therefore, Arabidopsis (A, indicating loss(es) in rice) and rice
(O, indicating loss(es) in Arabidopsis) clades were also identified based on their sister group relationships to the AO
clades. Since the clades that we defined are most likely orthologous groups (Figure 1, red circles), the number of clades
reflects that there were at least 21 ancestral PGs before the
Arabidopsis-rice split. Further expansion of this gene family
occurred after the split as suggested by the duplication events
in the lineage-specific branches that reside within each clade.
It should be noted that some clades such as the A1 clade were
not defined based on the AO clade-based criteria because the
nodes within had relatively low bootstrap supports (<50%). If
we assumed these less well-supported nodes are correct,
there are 27 ancestral PGs.

replicates. Sequences are color-coded according to the key. The plant PGs
are classified into three major groups and multiple clades. The clades were
defined by identifying nodes representing speciation events (circles, see
Results section for criteria). For these nodes, red circles indicate that the
bootstrap support for the subtending branches is higher than 50% and
indicate the criteria for least number of common ancestral PGs between
rice and Arabidopsis. The nodes are labeled with white circles if the

Within these 26 duplicated blocks, 29 PGs are found in both
duplicated regions of ten block pairs. To investigate the origin
of PGs in these ten block pairs, we conducted similarity
searches between regions of each pair to determine if PGs
mapped to the corresponding duplicated regions, and if their
neighboring genes were arranged collinearly (Figure 3; see
also (Additional data file 4) for all comparisons). Sixteen PGs
in five of these block pairs are clearly located in such collinear
regions, indicating that they were derived from large-scale
duplication of their associated blocks. For example, AGI block
23a contains nine PGs in six corresponding duplicated
regions that show extensive collinearity (Figure 3). In Figure

In addition to tandem duplications, it has been shown that
the Arabidopsis genome is the product of several rounds of
polyploidization or whole-genome duplications [17,19,20]. To
determine the contribution of these large-scale duplications,
we mapped Arabidopsis PGs to the duplicated blocks established in two independent studies. The first dataset from the
Arabidopsis Genome Initiative [17] contains 31 blocks (AGI
blocks), and forty Arabidopsis PGs fall in 16 of the AGI blocks
(Figure 2, indicated in red and green). Blocks from the second
dataset from Blanc et al. [20] are designated as BHW (after
Blanc, Hokamp, Wolfe) blocks, and 19 PGs were found in 10
BHW blocks (Figure 2, shaded). The AGI and BHW blocks
were identified using different approaches and their combined use increases the coverage of duplicated regions. As a
result, nearly 90% (59 out of 66) of Arabidopsis PGs are covered in the 26 AGI and BHW blocks.

PGs (24 of 66) have at least one related sequence within ten
predicted genes, and these 24 genes fall into nine clusters that
range from two to four genes per cluster (Figure 2, column
cluster). In most cases, these physically associated PGs are
from the same clades; however, there are five exceptions
including genes in clusters 1d, 2b and 3a (Figure 2). In these
cases, some members within the cluster are not closest relatives. Besides these 24 tandem repeated sequences, all
remaining PGs are at least 100 genes apart. This bimodal distribution of PG physical distances and relationships between
closely linked genes suggests that the 24 closely linked PGs
are derived from tandem duplications.

Mechanisms of Arabidopsis PG family expansion. The locations of
Arabidopsis PGs are indicated on the Arabidopsis chromosomes. The
tandem clusters are also indicated. They are color-coded based on the
following scheme: PGs found in both duplicated regions of a block pair
(green); PGs found in only one duplicated region of a block pair (red); and
no PG is located in these blocks (gray). PGs covered by AGI blocks are
either red or green, while PGs covered by BHW but not AGI blocks are
with white text and black-boxed background. If PGs are found in both
duplicated regions of a block, the gene names are linked. In addition, these
gene names are italicized if they belong to the same clade. PGs that are not
found in either AGI or BHW blocks are shown in black text. Tandem
duplications are indicated by cluster designation. BHW block names were
modified from the original designations of Blanc et al. [20]. BHW block
names with a prime indicate that they overlap with AGI blocks of the same
names. The reference for the block names can be found in Additional data

products of a block duplication. This is also true for a tandem
cluster of four PGs and a PG singleton shown in Figure 3d.
Interestingly, At3g57790 corresponds to At2g43210, a potential pseudogene lacking the signal peptide and the bulk of the
PG catalytic domain (Figure 3c). We also observed that there
are 23 duplicated block pairs with asymmetrical distribution
(Additional data file 4). Among them, 16 block pairs have PGs
on only one of the blocks (Figure 2 and (Additional data file
4)): ten for AGI and six for BHW blocks. For the remaining
seven block pairs, the PGs are found on both blocks but are
not arranged in a collinear fashion. Taken together, these
findings clearly indicate that many members of the PG family
are derived from large-scale duplication events. However,
quite a few of them were not retained.

The size of the plant PG family and the patterns of PG duplication in Arabidopsis indicate that the PG family expanded in
both Arabidopsis and rice after their divergence. The continuous expansion of this gene family raises an intriguing question on the mechanisms of duplicate retention and their
functions in plants. Since retention may be due to functional
divergence between duplicate copies, it is possible that PG
functional divergence can be, in part, attributed to expression
divergence. To evaluate the degree of expression divergence
between PG duplicates, we analyzed the expression of all 66
Arabidopsis PGs in five tissue types (flowers, siliques, inflorescence stems, rosette and cauline leaves, and roots) with
RT-PCR (Figure 4 and Additional data file 5). PCR reactions
were repeated at least three times for each gene in each tissue
type, and all primers were tested using genomic DNA as a
positive control (see Figure 5). In addition, PCR products of
40 of the 43 PGs were sequenced to verify their identity. We
found that 23 PGs did not have detectable RT-PCR products
in any of the five tissue types tested. We further tested the
expression of these 23 PGs in a T87 suspension culture cell
line that had been previously shown to have >60% genes
expressed [24]. Only one PG (At2g43860) was detected. To
rule out the possibility of faulty primer designs, a second

reports

To complement the RT-PCR approach, we also examined the
expression tags that were publicly available including fulllength cDNAs, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and massive
parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) tags (Additional data
file 6). The presence of RT-PCR products or other expression
tags is shown in Figure 4 (far right-hand panel). Among these
four different expression measures, the RT-PCR approach
detects the highest number of PGs. In the 43 PGs with RTPCR products, other expression tags support only 30 of them.
In addition, only three PGs have cDNA, ESTs, and/or MPSS
but not RT-PCR products. These findings indicate that RTPCR is the most sensitive approach with a relatively low falsenegative rate. For further analyses, we consider a PG
expressed if two out of three of the RT-PCR reactions had
detectable products (42) or if its expression is supported by
the presence of either cDNA or EST (three). Based on these
criteria, 45 PGs had detectable expression (Figure 4). Approximately 50% of these expressed PGs are found in all five tissues and 20% have relatively higher level of expression in
more than one tissue. In addition, more than 50% of
expressed PGs have high level of expression in floral tissues,
40% in root tissue, 16% in stem and 12% in silique. Only nine
PGs (approximately 20%) are found in only one tissue type
(Figure 4). These findings indicate that most PGs have rather
wide expression patterns and the expression level seems to be
generally higher in floral tissues. The complexity of expression patterns represented in Figure 4 emphasizes the need for
additional interpretation, and is the basis for the statistical

best matches (r = -0.4389, p = 0.12). This finding indicates
that expression patterns have diverged quickly after PG duplications. In particular, significantly fewer PGs in tandem clusters were expressed when compared with those not in clusters
(Table 1; Fisher's exact test; p = 0.0326). In several cases, the
tandem duplicated regions have one relatively highly
expressed gene while the rest have either low expression levels or no RT-PCR products. For example, in the 1b tandem
cluster of clade A14, At1g23460 is highly expressed while
At1g23470 does not have any detectable expression. Curiously, we found that related PGs found in duplicated blocks
tend to have similar expression patterns at the tissue level.
For example, in block 11d clade A14, At1g23460 and
At1g70500 have nearly identical expression profiles (Figure
4). We selected 18 PG pairs that were derived from tandem or
large-scale block duplication to compare their expression
divergence. Among nine pairs in large-scale duplicated
blocks, the expression pattern is significantly different in only
one pair (Table 2). Among the nine pairs derived from tandem duplications, the t-test could only be conducted for four
pairs because several of the tandem duplicates had no detectable expression. In addition to two pairs with significant differences (p < 0.05), three pairs with only one of the tandem
duplicates expressed are also classified as pairs showing
expression divergence. Therefore, excluding two pairs with
no expression for both duplicates, five out of seven tandem
pairs have divergent expression. Significantly fewer PG pairs
derived from tandem duplications have similar expression
patterns compared with those derived from large-scale duplications (Fisher's exact test; p < 0.01). Therefore, tandemly
duplicated PGs have higher levels of expression divergence
compared with PGs derived from large-scale duplications.
These findings suggest that duplication mechanisms contribute to divergence of expression patterns differently.

the abscission zones of flowers and developing siliques at five
developmental stages during floral organ abscission (Figure
7a). During the abscission process there are discrete stages
when cell wall loosening and cell wall dissolution occurs, thus
providing an excellent biological system to look at more subtle changes in the regulation of cell separation. And indeed,
this analysis allowed us to discern differences in expression
between PGs that had been initially regarded as similar due to
limitations in resolution (Figure 7). For example, at the tissue
level, At1g23460 and At1g70500, from block 11d clade A14
were regarded as having nearly identical expression profiles.
However, when we examined five stages of abscission, these
genes have distinct profiles (Figure 7c and 7e, Additional data
file 7).
We determined that there are nine unique patterns of expression for the PGs during the five stages of abscission that are
shown in Figure 7 and Additional data file 7. Eight PGs display high levels of expression at anthesis, low levels during
the events of cell separation, and high levels post abscission
as depicted in Figure 7b. These genes are all from
independent clades except two sets: At1g19170 and
At3g42950 (B8), and At2g23900 and At3g48950 (B6). In
Figure 7c, 7 PGs show initial high expression at anthesis that
decreases steadily during abscission, while in Figure 7d, PG
expression (At1g02460, At1g56710, and At3g61490) initially

decreases right before abscission and then increases after the
loss of floral organs or during what is described as post abscission repair. In Figure 7e, two PGs (At1g23460 and
At1g10640) have very low or undetectable expression during
anthesis that goes up continually during abscission. Other
patterns include ten PGs with constitutive expression (Figure
7f), and six PGs with no expression (Figure 7g). Last, we
observed three patterns of expression that correlated with
unique changes during the process of abscission (Figure
7h,i,j). In Figure 7h, high levels of gene expression correlate
with cell wall loosening or the earliest steps of abscission,
while in Figure 7i highest levels of gene expression correlate
with cell separation or loss of floral organs. In Figure 7j, it is
only at around positions 10 and 11 that we observe detectable
gene expression, and this correlates with predicted stages of
cell repair [25].
Taken together, expression divergence between PGs that
show no difference at the tissue level were revealed when we
examined PG expression at different developmental stages of
abscission, thus indicating duplication mechanisms contribute to divergence of expression differently. Our findings also
provide candidate PGs important for different abscission
stages. More importantly, the expression divergence between
duplicate genes in general appears to be under-estimated in
expression studies due to the limitations in resolution.

Conclusion
PG family expansion history

Divergence of expression pattern after duplications
Although a large number of PG duplicates were lost, there is a
net gain in the PG family size after the split between Arabidopsis and rice, and thus, the immediate question is how were
these duplicates retained? The fate of duplicated genes varies
and depends on the selection constraints [21,22]. Since one
third of the Arabidopsis PGs do not have any evidence of
expression, these genes could be pseudogenes. However,
some of them have diverged substantially from their closest
relatives with large synonymous substitution rates and have
most likely persisted beyond the time frame of pseudogenization in Arabidopsis proposed to be a million years [30].
Meanwhile, PGs without evidence of expression may be
present in tissues not sampled or induced under untested
conditions. A closer look at other developmental events
involving cell wall degradation, cell separation or cell wall
loosening may provide additional insights.

There is mounting evidence that retention of duplicated genes
may be due to acquisition of novel functions, partitioning of
original functions, or both. The contribution of differential
expression in retaining duplicated genes has been hypothesized more than 25 years ago [31,32]. More recently, Force et
al. [33] proposed the DDC (Duplication/Degeneration/Complementation) model predicting that genes sharing overlapping but distinct expression patterns will be retained due to
the partitioning of ancestral expression profiles. In our study,
we found that two thirds of the Arabidopsis PGs are
expressed and almost three quarters of these expressed PGs
are detected in at least three tissues. If the AtGenExpress
microarray data for Arabidopsis is considered [34], five additional PGs are likely expressed using a stringent intensity cutoff (data not shown). Among the PGs that are expressed
rather ubiquitously, related PGs in general have overlapping
but distinct expression profiles, consistent with the prediction of the DDC model, although it is possible that some
expression differences are due to gain of expression rather
than loss. In any case, divergent expression among closely
related PGs is evident in the different developmental stages of
abscission. It has also been reported more recently that duplicated genes tend to have more similar expression patterns
when the Ks is relatively small [35,36]. However, in the PG
family, the more recent duplicates do not necessarily have
more similar expression patterns. The expression correlation
breaks down even more when we examine the expression profiles of PGs in different developmental stages of the abscission process. This lack of correlation may be attributed to
relatively long divergence time (large Ks value) between PG
duplicates and the lack of statistical power, because a much

reports

In the cases where PGs were present in only one of the collinear regions, it is likely that the absence of PGs was due to
gene losses, and almost 80% of the PGs generated by largescale duplications could have been lost in Arabidopsis. These
findings are consistent with the high duplicate loss rate in the
Arabidopsis genome [28,29]. In addition, the collinear
regions flanking PGs are generally larger than the corresponding regions without PGs (considering the numbers of
genes or physical distances between the two genes flanking

the PGs that were collinear), thus suggesting that the deletion
of chromosome regions contributes to PG loss. Another
explanation for the asymmetrical distribution of PGs in
blocks is that they were inserted de novo through an alternative mechanism such as retro-transposition; however, this is
unlikely, as all of the plant PGs have multiple introns.

reviews

By examining the physical locations of Arabidopsis PGs and
their relationships to the proposed large-scale duplication
patterns, we found that tandem duplications and large-scale
duplications were two of the major factors responsible for the
expansion of the PG family in Arabidopsis. This is similar to
other gene families such as the NBS-LRR [26] and the RLK/
Pelle gene family [27]. Among duplicates in the same tandem
cluster, nearly all belong to the same PG clades or are close
relatives of each other. The only exception is At1g80140 and
At1g80170 in cluster 1d, suggesting that they are tandem
duplicates that formed before the Arabidopsis-rice split.
Most of the PGs (59) are located within 26 duplicated block
pairs (Table 1). However, the comparison of gene contents
between duplicated blocks in each pair indicates that 22 PGs
are distributed asymmetrically in ten of these duplicated
block pairs, thus suggesting gene losses. The rest of the duplicated block pairs contain PGs in both duplicated regions.
Since only 13 of these PGs are collinear, our findings suggest
that large-scale duplications did contribute to some expansion of the PG family but gene losses occurred frequently.
Members of each PG pair (either one-to-one or one-to-many)
located in collinear regions are from the same clade. Since a
clade is defined as the PG ancestral unit right before the
divergence between Arabidopsis and rice, the blocks harboring these PGs would be duplicated after the split between
these two plants. Blanc et al. [20] assigned duplicated gene
pairs to blocks and used synonymous substitution rates to
establish the block age. We found that 17 PGs were in 'recent'
blocks that duplicated after the split between the Arabidopsis
and rice lineages (Additional data file 4). This correlation is
consistent with our interpretation based on a phylogenetic
approach.

comment

PGs fall into several taxon-specific clades where eubacterial,
fungal, and plant PGs organize into different clusters [10]. We
have hypothesized that there were approximately 21 PGs
present in the immediate common ancestor of Arabidopsis
and rice, and when additional monocots and dicots are
sequenced, we will be able to have a more accurate estimate
of the ancestral family size. Since Arabidopsis and rice
diverged more than 150 million years ago (MYA), gene conversion events that occurred soon after divergence of these
two lineages will be much rarer than those that occurred in a
lineage-specific fashion.

smaller number of genes are examined compared with an
analysis of the whole genome. In addition, we suggest that the
mechanism of gene duplication appears to contribute differently to expression divergence. The number of expressed PGs
is significantly lower if they are located in tandem repeats. On
the other hand, PGs with similar tissue expression patterns
tend to be localized to corresponding large-scale duplicated
blocks. One possible mechanism for this difference in expression pattern conservation may be the fact that tandem duplication may or may not allow the duplication of whole

promoter regions and coding sequences. On the other hand,
large-scale duplication involves the duplication of multiple
genes together with their promoter and/or enhancer elements. Thus, tandem duplications will result in faster expression divergence than large-scale duplications, and that largescale duplications ultimately lead to "fine tuning" of gene
expression. Another potential explanation for the differences
in expression may be due to differences in gene silencing.
Homology-dependent gene silencing is a common phenomenon in plants [37]. Since the average sequence divergence

Two large-scale duplication datasets were used. The first is
based on the analysis of the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative
[17] that was provided by Heiko Schoof and MIPS/Institute of
Bioinformatics, Germany. The correspondence between
block names given in this study and those in the original analysis, and the starting and ending gene names for these blocks
are given in Additional data file 2. The second is based on
Blanc et al. [20] and is available from [45]. The collinearity of
blocks that contain PGs in corresponding duplicated regions
was determined using tBLASTn. For these blocks, the nucleotide sequences of one of the duplicated regions were used as
query to search against a translated database built from the
nucleotide sequence of the other region. To increase the
number of High Scoring Pairs recovered, the query sequences
were split into 5 kb windows. The matching areas (at least 50
amino acids long and 60% identical) of blocks that contain
PGs in the corresponding duplicated regions are shown in
Additional data file 4. After identifying the collinear regions
surrounding PGs, we took at least 100 kb regions surrounding
PGs and their corresponding duplication regions, regardless
of the presence of PGs, and repeated the BLAST analysis splitting query sequences into 1 kb windows. Matching areas were
defined as similar regions at least 30 amino acids long.

reviews

Functional studies have established that plant PGs are
involved in diverse roles including plant growth and development, wounding responses, and plant-microbe interactions
[4]. Although the PG family members have substantial overlap in tissue-level expression even between distantly related
members, when we analyzed distinct developmental stages of
abscission we were able to discern unique patterns of expression. These findings suggest that although even if there may
be functional overlap between PGs, substantial expression
divergence contributed to their retention and probably their
functions. Given the number of PGs and the complexity of
plant tissues and cell types, it is likely that PGs expressed in
the same tissues have subtle differences in their temporal or
spatial profiles. This is consistent with the PG expression patterns in different developmental stages of abscission.
Alternatively, these seemingly co-expressed PGs may have
also diverged at the biochemical levels, such as their catalytic
properties. In this study, we used genome sequence information combined with gene expression to provide a framework
to unravel the complexity of gene family function. By careful
analysis we have been able to take a family of 66 genes and
identify four members (Figure 7i) that have unique changes
just as cell wall loosening and cell wall dissolution is predicted
to occur; thus presenting a small subset of genes for further
studies on abscission. Additional analyses in the temporal
and spatial patterns of expression in other tissues, their biochemical properties, and in the biological functions of these
genes will lead to novel insights regarding functional divergence and conservation in this gene family.

between tandem repeats is smaller than that of large-scale
duplications (data not shown), one might also argue that tandemly duplicated genes tend to be silenced at a higher
frequency.

PCR products were excised from the gel, cleaned using a Qiagen Gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and
sequenced directly as described below. Cycle sequencing
reactions with a thermostable DNA polymerase and fluorescently labeled dideoxy terminators (BIG DYE Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) were carried out on each purified
product or subcloned fragment. At2g43870 was subcloned
into the PCR 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
before sequencing. All reactions were outsourced to the UWMadison Biotechnology Center and run on an ABI automated
DNA sequencer.

Expression tags of PGs and analysis
The cDNA sequences released by the SIGnAL database [49]
were retrieved from GenBank. The predicted protein

information

A quantity of 1 µg of each RNA sample was used to prepare
cDNA by modifying standard procedures [48]. First strand
synthesis was carried out using 500 µg/ml of an 18 mer oligo
dT primer (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). Resulting cDNAs were
diluted 1:2 and 1 µl was added as template for a standard 20
µl PCR reaction. For each gene, primers were designed that
flanked an intron in the genomic DNA similar to that
described by Wang et al. [48]. Since the mRNA and genomic
copy of a gene share identical primer sites, they had comparable amplification efficiencies in the PCR reaction and were
distinguishable by size. Reactions were incubated at 95°C for
5 minutes, and cycled 28 or 36 times as follows: 94°C for 3

minutes, annealing temperature for 30 seconds, 72°C for 2
minutes. After the last cycle, reactions were incubated at 72°C
for 7 minutes. Annealing temperatures and cycle numbers
were optimized and are shown in Additional data file 5. A
quantity of 10 µl of each PCR reaction was analyzed by gel
electrophoresis, and the relative levels of PCR products were
recorded.

alcohol (24:1). Nucleic acids were precipitated at 4°C with isopropanol and 10 M NH4OAc (one-third volume) and resuspended in TE. One-half volume of 6.0 M LiCl was added to the
sample, incubated at 4°C for 4 hours, and then centrifuged 15
minutes at 12,000 g. DNA (supernatant fraction) was precipitated by adding 10 M NH4OAc (1/3 volume) and ethanol, and
RNA (pellet) was washed with ethanol and resuspended in
DEPC-treated H20 (1 µg/µl). DNA and RNA yields were
quantified using a Smart Spec 3000 Biorad (Hercules, CA,
USA). Nucleic acid quality was assessed by gel
electrophoresis.

The phylogeny and expression patterns of Arabidopsis PGs. The phylogeny was generated using all Arabidopsis PGs with Erwinia peh1 as the outgroup. The
clade classification, cluster and block designation are also shown. The levels of transcripts are classified into five categories as shown in the key. The tissue
source abbreviations are as follows: Fl, flower; Si, silique; St, stem; Lf, rosette and cauline leaf; Rt, root; gDNA, genomic DNA. For each gene, three
colored rectangles represent the level of RT-PCR products from three independent biological replications for each tissue type. On the right, the solid
black circles indicate the presence of the four different expression tags. RT-PCR data are from this study and a solid circle represents repeatable
expression from one or more of the six tissue types analyzed including expression in At2g43860 from suspension cultures. Open circles represent
expression that was only detected in one of the RT-PCR reactions yet verified by sequencing. cDNAs, ESTs and MPSS tags were obtained from SIGnAL,
GenBank, and the Arabidopsis MPSS project websites, respectively. Branches that were shortened are intersected with a solidus (/).

sequences. The cDNAs for PGs are listed in part I of Additional data file6. The Arabidopsis ESTs were retrieved from
GenBank (part II of Additional data file 6), and a BLAST
search was conducted using the predicted coding sequences
of PGs. All matches with more than 80% identity were
inspected. After eliminating gaps longer than three from the
alignments, cognate ESTs were defined as those that were top
matches to the gene in question with at least 97% identity.
The accessions, source tissue information for the matching
ESTs, can be found in part II of Additional data file 6. The
MPSS tags matching the PG genes were retrieved using a
batch query script from the Arabidopsis MPSS database [50].
Only tags matching exons in the crick strand with levels significantly different from 0 were regarded as evidence of
expression.

The PG expression levels as determined by RT-PCR were converted into 5 categories: high (4), medium (3), low (2), trace
(1), and none (0). For each gene, the median (M) of the converted expression levels was used for all subsequent analyses.
For each gene pair, the synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rates were determined using the yn00 phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood program PAML [51].
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was determined for
each gene pair and transformed into ln [(1+R)/(1-R)] for linear repression analyses [35,36]. For determining the differences in expression patterns between tandemly duplicated
and block-duplicated genes, we conducted t-tests for 18 PG
pairs. For each tissue, the expression levels were considered if
both or either one of the genes in a pair were expressed.

Expression of PGs shared among tissues and the correlation between
expression patterns and the Ks. (a) Overlapping expression of PGs - the
majority of expressed PGs are found in all five tissues tested. (b) Pairwise
comparisons of tissues with PGs - the numbers in black boxes represent
the number of PGs expressed in indicated tissues. The numbers in the
upper-right half are the number of PGs expressed in both tissues specified
in the top row and in the leftmost column. The numbers in the lower-left
half are the percent overlap between two tissues. (c) The relationships
between the Ks and transformed correlations in expression patterns - the
Ks values were determined for all PG pairs. The correlations between
expression patterns were calculated for all PG pairs and transformed as
described in the Materials and methods. The formulae for the best fit and
the correlation coefficient determined by linear regression are shown on
the top right corner.

RT-PCR on floral organ abscission zones representing five unique stages of development. Expression of 43 PGs is examined in the abscission zones at five
different stages of floral organ abscission as determined by position on the inflorescence, where position one represents anthesis and larger numbers are
progressively older flowers (a). Five developmental stages were examined with the RT-PCR; i (position1/2) and ii (position 4/5), pre-abscission, iii (position
7/8), during abscission, iv (position 0/11), and v (position 13/14) post-abscission. Expression during the abscission process is classified into nine different
unique patterns shown in (b) to (j); the gene names are provided in Additional data file 7. PGs specifically up-regulated during the abscission process are
shown with RT-PCR products (k).
