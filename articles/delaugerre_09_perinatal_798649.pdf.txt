Abstract
Background: Primary-HIV-1-infection in newborns that occurs under antiretroviral prophylaxis
that is a high risk of drug-resistance acquisition. We examine the frequency and the mechanisms of
resistance acquisition at the time of infection in newborns.
Patients and Methods: We studied HIV-1-infected infants born between 01 January 1997 and
31 December 2004 and enrolled in the ANRS-EPF cohort. HIV-1-RNA and HIV-1-DNA samples
obtained perinatally from the newborn and mother were subjected to population-based and clonal
analyses of drug resistance. If positive, serial samples were obtained from the child for resistance
testing.
Results: Ninety-two HIV-1-infected infants were born during the study period. Samples were
obtained from 32 mother-child pairs and from another 28 newborns. Drug resistance was detected
in 12 newborns (20%): drug resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was seen in
10 cases, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in two cases, and protease inhibitors in
one case. For 9 children, the detection of the same resistance mutations in mothers' samples (6
among 10 available) and in newborn lymphocytes (6/8) suggests that the newborn was initially
infected by a drug-resistant strain. Resistance variants were either transmitted from mother-tochild or selected during subsequent temporal exposure under suboptimal perinatal prophylaxis.
Follow-up studies of the infants showed that the resistance pattern remained stable over time,

regardless of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting the early cellular archiving of resistant viruses. The
absence of resistance in the mother of the other three children (3/10) and neonatal lymphocytes
(2/8) suggests that the newborns were infected by a wild-type strain without long-term persistence
of resistance when suboptimal prophylaxis was stopped.
Conclusion: This study confirms the importance of early resistance genotyping of HIV-1-infected
newborns. In most cases (75%), drug resistance was archived in the cellular reservoir and persisted
during infancy, with or without antiretroviral treatment. This finding stresses the need for effective
antiretroviral treatment of pregnant women.

Background
Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 mainly
occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy or at delivery, in the absence of breastfeeding [1]. Transmission can
be prevented by treating the pregnant woman during the
third trimester and at delivery, and by giving the child prophylactic treatment during the first weeks of life. The efficacy of this approach was first demonstrated in 1994 with
zidovudine [2], and the transmission rate has gradually
fallen in Europe and the United States from 25% to below
2% [3,4]. French guidelines published in 2004 recommend starting combination antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) at the end of the second trimester and adding
intravenous zidovudine (ZDV) during labor. Infants
receive ZDV orally for 6 weeks, alone or combined with
other antiretroviral drugs if the risk of transmission is high
[5].
Situations of particular risk of HIV-1 MTCT [4] include
unknown maternal HIV-1 serostatus; ineffective maternal
ART; maternal primary HIV-1 infection during pregnancy;
and suboptimal MTCT prevention.
Infants may be at an increased risk of infection by drugresistant HIV-1 strains when the mother harbors such
viruses or when drug pressure during MTCT prophylaxis is
suboptimal.
Vertical transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 was first
reported sporadically [6-8], but it is now known that 9%
to 30% of infected infants exposed to MTCT prophylaxis
with ZDV acquire ZDV-resistant viruses [7,9-12]. Masquelier et al. reported finding viruses with ZDV genotypic
resistance in 20% of 34 HIV-1-infected infants who were
born in France between 1994 and 1996 and were enrolled
in the ANRS-EPF French national cohort [7]. In New York
State, drug resistance mutations were detected in 12% of
perinatally infected infants born in 1998 and 1999 [13]
and in 19.1% of such infants born in 2001 and 2002 [14].
In France, between 1997 and 2004, the estimated MTCT
rate was 1.8% (92 newborns). Here we report the current
rate of HIV-1 drug resistance in French neonates born to

infected mothers. We also report our investigation as to
how these resistant viruses were acquired by the newborns, and the outcome of resistance during infancy.

Patients and methods
Study population
Since 1985, the ANRS French Perinatal Cohort (CO 01ANRS-EPF, Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDAEnquête Périnatale Française) has prospectively collected
data on HIV-infected pregnant women and their children
in 90 centers throughout France. Informed consent is
obtained from the mothers during pregnancy or at the
time of delivery. The children receive standard care,
including clinical and biological examinations at birth
and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18-24 months, as previously reported
[15]. The cohort study was approved by the Cochin Hospital Institutional Review Board and by the French computer database watchdog commission (CNIL). Mother
and infant plasma and cells were collected between 1990
and 2005 and stored in Necker hospital virology laboratory.

HIV-1 infection was diagnosed in the newborn when at
least two separate samples were positive by HIV-1 RNA/
DNA detection or by a viral culture. A positive test at birth
or before 7 days of age indicates intrauterine transmission, while a negative test at birth and a positive test more
than 7 days later indicate intrapartum transmission. An
infant is considered uninfected when two tests performed
one month after discontinuation of antiretroviral prophylaxis are negative.
Newborns were included in this analysis if: (1) they were
born and enrolled in metropolitan France in centers participating in the EPF cohort between 1997 and 2004; (2)
they were HIV-1-infected; and (3) if frozen samples were
available for resistance testing.
For each mother-child pair, we analyzed the first available
HIV-1-positive sample(s) from the infant's delivery sample and the mother's. If drug resistance was detected in the
newborn diagnostic sample, available follow-up samples
from the infant were tested for genotypic resistance.

Other data, including the mothers' viral load values and
the mothers' and infants' antiretroviral treatment histories, were obtained from the ANRS-EPF database.
HIV-1 RNA quantification
Plasma HIV-1 RNA was quantified with the Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor 1.5 assay kit (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France; detection limit 400 or 40 copies/mL).
Resistance genotyping
The ANRS consensus method was used for populationbased nucleotide sequence analysis of the whole protease
gene (codons 1 to 99) and codons 1 to 305 of the reverse
transcriptase gene on HIV-1 RNA in plasma and HIV-1
DNA in PBMC [16]. Drug resistance mutations were identified by following the International AIDS Society-USA
2007 Drug Resistance Group guidelines [17]http://
www.iasusa.org. Specifically, we considered the following
mutations (relative to the reference wild-type (WT) strain
HXB2): protease inhibitors (PI): D30N, L33F/I, M46I/L,
G48V, I50L/V, V82A/F/L/S/T, I84A/C/V, and L90M; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI): M41L,
A62V, K65R, D67N, K70R, L74V, V75I, F77L, Y115F,
F116Y, Q151M, M184V, L210W, T215Y/F/C/D/E/S/I/V/
A/G/H/L/N and K219E/Q/R; and non nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI): L100I, K103N, V106A/
M, V108I, Y181C/I, Y188C/H/L, G190A/S, P225H,
M230L, and P236L. Mixtures of WT and mutant
sequences were considered drug-resistant. Interpretation
of genotypic drug susceptibility was done according to the
2007 French ANRS algorithm http://www.hivfrenchresist
ance.org.
Clonal analysis of resistance in three mother-child pairs
In order to characterize the plasma and cellular viral quasispecies, clonal analyses were performed on samples
from three mother-child pairs. The maternal samples were
obtained at delivery and the children's samples were
obtained both at birth and subsequently. These three pairs
were chosen as being representative of three different situations, and because suitable plasma/cell samples for
them were available. The RT or protease gene was amplified. Purified PCR products were cloned into the pCR
Topo 2-1 plasmid (TOPO TA Cloning kits, Invitrogen BV,
the Netherlands) as recommended by the manufacturer.
DNA was purified with the Mini-Prep kit (Qiagen) and
clones were analyzed by dye terminator sequencing on an
ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer.
Phylogenetic analysis
Mother-child clustering of pol sequences was confirmed
by phylogenetic analysis. All sequences of HIV-1 RNA and
DNA clones from each mother-child pair were aligned
with Clustal W 1.7 software. Pairwise evolutionary distances were estimated with DNADist using Kimura's two-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/85

parameter method. The phylogenetic trees were then constructed with a neighbor joining method (Neighbor program implemented in the Phylip package) [18]. The
reliability of each tree topology was estimated from 100
bootstrap replicates [18].

Results
Study population
From January 1997 to December 2004, 6170 motherchild pairs were enrolled in the ANRS-EPF cohort, representing approximately 70% of births to HIV-1-infected
mothers in France. 92 newborns were infected during this
period despite prophylaxis. It is important to note that the
newborn samples were used to diagnose HIV infection
and that the remaining stored samples were usually very
limited.

HIV-1-positive plasma and/or PBMC samples from 60
children (33 boys and 27 girls) were available for drug
resistance studies. Samples were also available from 32 of
these children's mothers. The children's samples were
obtained at a median age of 29 days (1 to 313 days), and
72% of plasma samples were collected less than 60 days
after birth. The children's median HIV-1 RNA viral load at
diagnosis was 4.5 log10 copies/ml (2.1 to 7.3 log10).
Drug resistance at HIV-1 diagnosis in the infant
Twelve (20%) of the 60 newborns had resistant variants at
diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, according to the 2007 IAS
(International AIDS Society) list (Table 1). Six of these
children were infected in utero and four intrapartum; the
timing of infection could not be determined in the
remaining two children as no birth sample was available.
The mutations were associated with resistance to NRTI in
10 cases [thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) in six cases,
T69N in one case, M184V in one case, and both mutations
in two cases], NNRTI in two cases, and PI in one case.

According to the 2007 ANRS algorithm, 6 of the 12 children had variants with resistance to at least one antiretroviral drug [overall frequency 10% (6/60)]. Resistance to
NRTI, NNRTI and PI was observed in four children, two
children and one child, respectively. One child had variants resistant to both NRTI and NNRTI (child #10, Table
1).
In all but one case, the neonates' drug resistance profiles
were related to the antiretroviral drugs received by the
mother and/or by the child (Table 1). Infant #10 harbored
viruses with mutations associated with NNRTI resistance,
without being exposed perinatally to this drug class. His
mother had never received NNRTI, but she had probably
been infected with NNRTI-resistant virus transmitted by
her husband, who was treated with a regimen containing
nevirapine, stavudine and lamivudine.

The viral subtypes were determined in 53 children, and
were subtype CRF02_AG in 23 cases (43%), B in 19 cases
(36%), A in 5 cases (9%) and another subtype in 6 cases
(11%). Among the 10 subtyped resistant viruses, 5 (50%)
belonged to subtype B, three (30%) to CRF02_AG, one to
A and one to F.
DNA-based resistance results were available for 8 of the 12
children with resistant viruses in plasma. In 6 cases HIV-1
RNA and DNA harbored the same resistance mutations
(Table 1), while no mutation was detected in HIV-1 DNA
in the other two cases.
Comparison of resistance mutations in the children and
their mothers
Samples from 32 mother-child pairs were available,
including 10 of the 12 children with resistant virus in the
plasma (Table 1). The resistance pattern was the same in
six mother-child pairs. In the remaining four cases the
mothers harbored different mutations or no mutation.
Interestingly, child #9, whose mother harbored PI resistance mutations L10I, L63P and L90M and RT resistance

mutations Y181C, L210W and T215D, only harbored the
PI resistance mutations. The mother was receiving didanosine, saquinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, probably leading to the selection of a dominant PI-resistant
quasispecies. Among the 22 remaining mother-child
pairs, 20 mothers had wild-type viruses (in plasma), while
the other two mothers harbored resistant viruses that were
not transmitted to the child.
Longitudinal resistance analysis in infected children
Longitudinal resistance studies were performed in 8 of the
12 cases in which serial samples were available (median 4
samples per child), over a median period of 52 months
(Table 2). The same resistance mutations persisted in the
plasma and PBMC for 6 months to 5 years, regardless of
the antiretrovirals used in six children. Additional mutations had accumulated in the RNA and the DNA during
failing regimens. In two children (#6, #12), no zidovudine resistance mutations were detected when zidovudine
prophylaxis was discontinued. Interestingly, no resistance
mutations were detected in mother samples and in birth
children cells (Table 1 and 2).

Clonal and phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 in three mothernewborn pairs
To better understand how drug-resistant HIV-1 strains
detected in newborns are acquired, we conducted clonal
analyses of plasma and PBMC viral populations in three
mother-child pairs. The maternal samples were taken at
delivery, and the children's samples were taken both at
birth and at a later time.

In mother-child pair #9, 110 protease gene clones were
sequenced (Figure 1). In the mother, all 21 plasma clones
harbored the L90M major mutation and other minor
mutations. Her PBMC harbored heterogeneous variants
(12/21 wild-type, 8/21 L90M and 1/21 I84V), according
to the temporal archiving of resistant variants in lymphocytes during therapeutic regimens that contrasted
with the homogeneity reported in the plasma under selective therapeutic pressure. In her child, who was infected in
utero, all plasma and cellular variants harbored the L90M
mutation (40/40 at birth and 28/28 at month 30), even
during the period without PI selective pressure. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the homogeneity of the child's
specimens at birth with a genetic intravariability of protease gene that increased over time (from 0.003% to
0.01%). This case suggests the perinatal transmission of
L90M variants with early archiving in the child's lymphocytes and persistence over time.
In mother-child pair #11, 70 RT gene clones were
sequenced (Figure 2). The mother acquired HIV-1 infection during pregnancy and was rapidly treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir/ritonavir. The child was
infected in utero, despite elective Cesarean section and the
intensification of postnatal zidovudine prophylaxis by the
addition of lamivudine. All plasma and cellular quasispecies detected in the newborn (35/35 at month 3 and 26/
26 at month 7) harbored the M184V lamivudine resistance mutation. However, this mutation was not detected
in the mother's delivery plasma sample (9/9 wild-type).
Phylogenetic analysis confirmed low genetic intravariability (mean 0.006%) of the RT gene in the mother and her
child, in keeping with the high homogeneity due to the
primary infection in the child and his mother. M184V variants may have arisen during lamivudine treatment of the
mother and prophylaxis of the infant, leading to the massive early lymphocyte infection and persistence of lamivudine resistance. However, we cannot exclude an abacavirselective pressure on the M184V resistance-associated
mutation or a minor maternal M184V variant transmission.
In mother-child pair #12, 61 RT gene clones were
sequenced (Figure 3). The mother had advanced HIV-1
disease and poor adherence to treatment as reflected by
high viral load (4.4 log10 copies/mL). Resistance was

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/85

undetectable even by clonal analysis (28/28 wild-type).
Zidovudine prophylaxis was initiated at birth and continued for 6 weeks despite the diagnosis of HIV-1 in utero
infection in the newborn. In the child, the K70R mutation
was detected in 42% of clones (10/24) at month 1 and in
0% at month 12. Genetic intravariability was low
(0.005%) in the child, as expected, during primary infection. In this case, wild-type viruses were detected concomitantly in the RNA from the mother and in the DNA from
the child (only 1/10 resistant clones), suggesting that
most archived viruses in the child were WT viruses transmitted by the mother. Zidovudine resistance, present at
the time of diagnosis, occurred during suboptimal zidovudine pressure. Zidovudine discontinuation led to the
re-emergence of wild-type variants in the plasma at month
12, confirming that the reservoir consisted mainly of wildtype viruses.

Discussion
In France, early strategies intended to prevent vertical HIV
transmission are now considered suboptimal until the
recommendations of HAART in 2004 [5]. Indeed, newborns are at a high risk of acquiring drug resistant variants
emerging from their primary HIV-1 infection under
antiretroviral selective pressure [19].
In this study, we retrospectively detected resistance mutations in 20% of children born between 1997 and 2004
who were enrolled in the ANRS-EPF cohort. Interestingly,
the same frequency (7 of 34, 20%) was noted in the same
cohort during the period 1994-1996 [7], even though the
rate of vertical transmission was lower in the more recent
period. However, whereas only zidovudine resistance was
detected in 1994-1996, more varied resistance profiles
were found in 1997-2004, owing to the increased diversity
of antiretroviral combinations used to treat pregnant HIV1-infected women. Resistance to NRTI remained predominant throughout the study period. The most frequent
mutations were those associated with resistance to zidovudine and lamivudine, which are the only antiretroviral
drugs licensed for use in neonates. Only 3% of the children (n = 2) harbored variants resistant to NNRTI, compared to 12% in American studies [13,14], probably
owing to more widespread use of NNRTI-containing regimens to treat pregnant women in the USA [20]. In our
study, only one child had PI resistance mutations, reflecting the recent recommendation of PI-containing regimens
for PMTCT and a higher genetic barrier to resistance with
ritonavir-boosted PI-containing regimens.
In most of the children studied here, the resistance profiles were related to antenatal and post partum antiretroviral drug exposure. This contrasts with the lack of
relationship between antiretroviral drug resistance in
newborns and perinatal antiretroviral exposure observed

RT: reverse transcriptase; P: protease; Persistent mutations in bold; Empty line: resistance test was not done

in New York State [13,14]. However, no information on
maternal antiretroviral treatment and no maternal resistance genotyping were available in the latter studies.
The comparison of the maternal and neonatal drug resistance profiles pointed to two different mechanisms of
acquisition of resistant variants by infants in the perinatal
period (Figure 4). First, the infant could acquire drugresistant variants directly from the mother (A), in one of
two situations: i) the dominant variant in the mother also
became dominant in the child, ii) a minor resistant variant transmitted by the mother was selected in the child
during perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis, particularly in
the case of drugs such as nevirapine and lamivudine that
have a low genetic barrier to resistance. Indeed, a single
mutation is enough to confer high-level resistance to lamivudine or nevirapine. Moreover, selective pressure in the
fetus is facilitated by the high transplacental diffusion of
both these drugs [21,22]. Resistant mutations were
detected early in infant lymphocytes. Clonal and longitudinal analyses showed that primary acquisition of resistant viruses was associated with long-term persistence in
the infant's cellular reservoir; no matter what the subsequent treatment was.
In the second mechanism, the newborn initially acquires
wild-type virus from the mother (B) (figure 4). Drug
resistance can then arise during suboptimal zidovudine
prophylaxis. Cloned viruses from the infants' cellular
compartment were indeed wild-type, and wild-type
viruses re-emerged when prophylaxis ended. Alternatively, minor resistant variants circulating in the mother
may be undetectable at the clonal level in maternal samples, and/or resistant strains present in the female genital
tract could be different from those circulating in the
plasma [23].
Persaud et al. reported that drug-resistant HIV-1 in perinatally infected infants can fully populate the resting CD4+
T cell reservoir early in the course of infection and persist
for years in replication-competent form [24]. Moreover,
resistance acquisition and long-term persistence have

been described after PMTCT with a single dose of nevirapine or lamivudine in resource-poor settings [25-27]. This
long-term persistence in the cellular reservoir is reminiscent of the situation described in adults initially infected
by resistant viruses [28-32]. As in adults, new resistance
mutations can be acquired during suboptimal treatment
with residual viral replication [31]. Our results underline
the advantages of using HAART for PTMTC instead of suboptimal regimens that include drugs with a low genetic
barrier to resistance and a long pharmacological half-life,
as currently used in developing countries.
In the second mechanism, withdrawal of zidovudine
prophylaxis led to the re-emergence of wild-type virus that
had been archived during the primary infection. Once
again, this resembles the situation in adults who acquire
drug-resistant viruses during antiretroviral failure and in
whom a dominant wild-type viral population re-emerges
when antiretroviral therapy is stopped [33].
Our clonal analysis suggests that all archived viruses arising from the first mechanism are resistant (100% resistant
cellular clones in children #9 and #11), compared to
about 10% resistance in those arising from the second
mechanism (10% resistant cellular clones in child #12).
Importantly, the main difference between primary-infection in infant and adults was the use of sub-optimal
antiretroviral prophylaxies in infants that could select for
resistant viruses if the infection occurs.
We observed mutations associated with resistance to at
least one antiretroviral drug in six children (10%), with
NRTI resistance in four, NNRTI resistance in two, and PI
resistance in one. Recently, Lockman et al. showed that
virologic failure of Triomune® was more frequent in
infants who were previously exposed to a single dose of
nevirapine rather than a placebo [34]. In contrast, Persaud
et al. reported that RT resistance-associated mutations did
not preclude the suppression of HIV-1 replication after 24
weeks of lopinavir/ritonavir-based HAART [24]. This
result together with our findings supports the use of

boosted-PI regimens in children with resistance mutations or unknown resistance status.
In conclusion, our findings support resistance genotyping
for children at diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, before treatment initiation, including children born to untreated
mothers [35]. This approach could avoid jeopardizing
drug treatment efficacy as demonstrated in adults [36].
Importantly, resistance testing in both the infant's plasma
and lymphocytes would help to show whether resistance
is likely to persist, with major implications for long-term
treatment.

Our results also support current French recommendations
to perform resistance genotyping in HIV-1-infected pregnant women in order to formulate both maternal and
neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis [5]. Finally, it is essential to use HAART and to avoid suboptimal regimens
because early resistance acquisition can have drastic longterm consequences.
