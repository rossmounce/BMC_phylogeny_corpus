Investigating the global genomic diversity of
Escherichia coli using a multi-genome DNA
microarray platform with novel gene prediction
strategies
Scott A Jackson1*, Isha R Patel1, Tammy Barnaba1, Joseph E LeClerc1 and Thomas A Cebula2

Abstract
Background: The gene content of a diverse group of 183 unique Escherichia coli and Shigella isolates was
determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, originally designed for transcriptome
analysis, as a genotyping tool. The probe set design utilized by this array provided the opportunity to determine
the gene content of each strain very accurately and reliably. This array constitutes 10,112 independent genes
representing four individual E. coli genomes, therefore providing the ability to survey genes of several different
pathogen types. The entire ECOR collection, 80 EHEC-like isolates, and a diverse set of isolates from our FDA strain
repository were included in our analysis.
Results: From this study we were able to define sets of genes that correspond to, and therefore define, the EHEC
pathogen type. Furthermore, our sampling of 63 unique strains of O157:H7 showed the ability of this array to
discriminate between closely related strains. We found that individual strains of O157:H7 differed, on average, by
197 probe sets. Finally, we describe an analysis method that utilizes the power of the probe sets to determine
accurately the presence/absence of each gene represented on this array.
Conclusions: These elements provide insights into understanding the microbial diversity that exists within extant
E. coli populations. Moreover, these data demonstrate that this novel microarray-based analysis is a powerful tool in
the field of molecular epidemiology and the newly emerging field of microbial forensics.
Keywords: genome, diversity, microarray, Escherichia coli, Shigella, O157:H7, gene content, pathogenic determinants

Background
Escherichia coli is a Gram negative bacterium that is
commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded
organisms. Most E. coli strains are harmless. As such,
commensal strains of E. coli are part of the normal
microbiota of the lower gastrointestinal tract (GI), benefitting their hosts by producing vitamin K2 and also by
preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria
within the intestine through a “colonization barrier
effect”. Yet some strains can cause infections in humans.
Six major categories of diarrheagenic E. coli exist:

enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli
(EIEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC),
and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). Furthermore various types of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)
are known to cause infections outside the gastrointestinal
tract; namely uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and newborn
meningitis-associated E. coli (NMEC).
E. coli O157:H7, an EHEC pathotype, was first recognized as a human pathogen in 1982 [1]. It has emerged as
a major enteric pathogen capable of causing outbreaks of
food poisoning in humans and often responsible for costly
food product recalls. The primary clinical manifestation of
an E. coli O157:H7 infection is hematic diarrhea that can
progress into more severe sequelae of hemolytic-uremic

syndrome and thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura,
which then can lead to renal failure and death [2-4]. An
estimated 75,000 cases of E. coli O157:H7 infections occur
annually in the United States, making it the principal serotype of enterohemorrhagic E. coli isolated from patients
[5]. Infections with this serotype usually have a food borne
etiology. In 2006, for example, three multi-state and 24
single-state foodborne outbreaks were confirmed to be
due to E. coli O157:H7 [6].
The extent of genomic diversity existing in E. coli and
other microbial pathogen populations has been the subject of debate. Recent studies including several genomic
methods like DNA microarrays, optical mapping, and
whole genome sequencing have shed new light on the
level of diversity within bacterial populations, making it
clear that the level of genomic diversity had been grossly
underestimated previously [7-9]. A comprehensive sampling of this diverse species, however, has not been
addressed in any single study using an advanced wholegenome analysis method such as microarray analysis.
Previous microarray studies have been limited to sampling a relatively small and/or undiverse collection of E.
coli strains. Moreover, traditional microarrays used in
these studies have had limited gene content and typically
utilize a single probe for determining whether a gene is
present or absent within a given strain [10]. This makes
gene detection calls questionable and absolutely requires
the inclusion of a reference strain for making accurate
gene calls.
Current array technology allows the design of microarrays containing greater than six million features. Arrays
thus can be designed to probe the genomes of multiple
organisms, a prerequisite of great value to an investigator
who may study closely related strains or species. However,
a caveat in multiple genome array design is that it is not
often possible, nor desirable, to define unique probes that
match every gene target with 100% sequence homology. It
is therefore necessary to establish a consensus sequence
for allelic variants. When a consensus sequence is represented on the array, consideration of the level of sequence
homology of a particular target sequence is important to
accurately determine the status of that gene following a
hybridization experiment.
The Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array
represents the genic and intergenic sequences of four
sequenced strains of E. coli: enterohemorrhagic (EHEC)
O157:H7 strains EDL933 and Sakai, the uropathogenic
(UPEC) O6:H1:K2 strain CFT073, and the laboratory
attenuated K12 strain MG1655 (OR:H48:K-) [11]. The
array consists of 228,484 25-mer oligonucleotides that
represent a total of 10,208 probe sets. Each probe set
contains approximately 22 oligonucleotide probes; 11
perfect match (PM) probes and 11 mismatch probes
(MM). Mismatch probes are identical to the perfect

Page 2 of 17

match probe with the exception of a one nucleotide (nt)
mismatch located at the 13th (middle) position of the
oligo sequence. These mismatch probes are designed to
allow for an approximation, and correction, of non-specific hybridization signal. We presumed that a probe
design strategy such as this would be ideally suited for
genotyping studies for two reasons: i) the probe redundancy for each genomic target sequence and ii) the
excellent specificity afforded by hybridization of short
25-mer probes. Previous microarray studies have used
either long oligos (50-mers to 80-mers) or PCR-derived
cDNA amplicons. Inherent to these array designs are
the disadvantages that i) only a single probe signal is
used to measure the presence of each genomic target
and ii) relatively high non-specific hybridization signal is
observed when using longer DNA probes [12,13].
In this study, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip® E.
coli Genome 2.0 Array to investigate the gene content
of 207 diverse isolates of E. coli and Shigella. This
multi-genome array provided us the opportunity to survey genes from different pathogen groups [11]. Strains
of E. coli and Shigella interrogated in this study consist
of approximately 60 different serotypes and 75 isolates
of the O157:H7 serotype (Table 1). Moreover, the entire
ECOR collection [14] was included in this study and
contains a set of 72 reference strains isolated from a
variety of hosts and geographical locations that is presumed to represent the range of phenotypic and genotypic variation in the E. coli species as a whole. Finally,
four sequenced strains of Shigella, believed to be in the
same species division as E. coli, were included in this
study. In summary, this strain collection was chosen
both to i) represent the global diversity of E. coli and ii)
to capture a diverse collection of a single pathogen type
(EHEC O157:H7). In doing so, we were able to not only
evaluate the ability of this array to measure the global
genomic diversity of this species, but also to assess
whether this array was useful for discriminating among
individual, and closely related, strains of the same
pathogen type. The latter is an important feature for the
newly emerging fields of microbial forensics and molecular epidemiology, where the ability to uniquely identify and discriminate among closely related strains is of
great importance in conducting attribution investigations of foodborne outbreaks or of covert biocrimes and
potential bioterrorism activities [15,16].
The probe set design utilized in this expression array
allowed highly accurate determination of a gene allele
presence. These data, combined with a unique custom
analysis approach, eliminate the need of a reference
strain, which previously has been an absolute requirement for accurate comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) studies. The comprehensive wealth of data
derived from this study has been used to identify groups

When a strain history is unknown, we used a “NA” designation.

of genes that define a particular pathogen type. The use
of this microarray approach, combined with the large
sampling size, gives insight to global E. coli diversity on a
previously unexplored scale.

Methods
Bacterial strains and preparation of genomic DNA

Strains of E. coli and Shigella used in this study are listed
in Table 1. Strains EDL933, MG1655, and CFT073 are
E. coli O157:H7, K-12, and uropathogenic strains, respectively, for which the genome sequences are available
[17-19]. Sakai is a Japanese enterohemorrhagic O157:H7
outbreak strain, and likewise the genome sequence is
available [20].
Strains were grown overnight in 3 mls of Luria Broth at
37°C in a shaking incubator. Genomic DNA was isolated
from 2 mls of the overnight culture using the Qiagen
DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Typically, 5-10 μg of purified genomic DNA
was recovered in a final elution volume of 200 μl. The
purified DNA was further concentrated using Microcon
YM-30 microcentrifuge filters to a final volume of

approximately 10 μl. 5 μg of the genomic DNA was fragmented by incubating at 37°C for 10 minutes in a 50 μl
reaction containing 1X One-Phor-All Plus Buffer (GE
Healthcare) and 0.1 units DNase I (GE Healthcare). The
fragmentation reaction was heat-inactivated at 95°C for 10
minutes. Following fragmentation, the DNA was 3’-end
labeled by adding 4 μl of 5X terminal transferase buffer
(Promega), 1 μl of 1 mM biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer
NEL508), and 2 μl (60 units) of terminal transferase
enzyme (Promega) (final volume 27 μl). Labeling was carried out for at least 2 hours at 37°C followed by heat inactivation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
Array hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning

Hybridizations were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual for
the 169 format array [21]. Briefly, 80 μl hybridizations containing 5 μg of fragmented/labeled DNA, 100 mM MES, 1
M [Na+], 20 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20, 50 pM control
oligo B2, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 7.8%
DMSO (Sigma), and 0.5 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) were hybridized onto the Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0

Jackson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/349

Array, incubated at 45°C, with rotation (60 rpm) for 16
hours in a hybridization oven.
Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedure
was carried out on an Affymetrix FS-450 fluidics station
using the mini_prok2v1_450 fluidics script [21]. Wash
and stain reagents were prepared according to the GeneChip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual [21]. The
following exceptions were made to the wash and stain
procedure: Streptavidin solution mix (vial 1) was
replaced with SAPE solution mix. Arrays were scanned
using a GeneChip ® Scanner 3000 7G running GCOS
v1.4 software.
Analysis Considerations for Genotyping with the
Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 Array

Adapting an expression array for genotyping purposes
required a novel data analysis approach, given that the
use of the Affymetrix probe set design produces 22
independent measurements for each genome target.
These 22 measurements are derived from a single probe
set, consisting of 11 probe pairs. Each probe pair is
composed of a single 25-mer perfect match (PM) oligo
and its corresponding 25-mer mismatch (MM) oligo.
The mismatch oligo is identical to the perfect match
with the exception of a single nucleotide mismatch
located at the central (13 th ) position of the oligo
sequence. Therefore summarizing these independent
measurements into a single probe set intensity value
that is indicative of the status of a particular gene can
be problematic. This can be further complicated when
one or more of the individual probes (25-mers) in a
probe set is able to hybridize to another genomic region,
thereby giving rise to a “partially specific” probe set.
Secondly, the Affymetrix array is a multi-genome array.
Previous CGH studies have required a reference strain
in order to accurately detect whether a particular gene
target was present/absent. For a multigenome array,
however, it is not possible to use data from any single
hybridization experiment as a reference data set. Therefore the status of each gene target should, ideally, be
determined by considering only raw probe intensities
from an individual experiment.
Parsing CEL Files and Data Analysis Tools

All 207 Affymetrix CEL files generated in this study
were parsed using the Robust MultiArray Averaging
(RMA) method (Bioconductor affy Package and Affymetrix Power Tools) [22-25]. Hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis was done using
Spotfire and the MADE4 package of Bioconductor
[26,27]. MAS 5.0 gene present/absent calls were determined using Affymetrix Power Tools as well as the affy
Bioconductor Package [24,28]. All data files, including

Page 7 of 17

207 Affymetrix CEL files, the RMA-summarized probe
set intensities, and the MAS 5.0 gene present/absent
calls, can be accessed at http://www.mrscentral.com
Probe Set Summarization Methods

It is desirable to determine the summarized intensity of
each probe set (consists of 11 PM and 11 MM oligos).
In all of our analyses, summarized probe set intensities
were calculated for each strain by using the Robust MultiArray Averaging (RMA) [23] method as implemented
in the affy package of Bioconductor or Affy Power
Tools. In brief, RMA summarization of probe level data
is done by performing three individual treatments on all
of the experimental CEL data simultaneously. First,
probe specific correction of the PM probes is done
using a model based on the observed intensities being
the sum of signal and noise. Secondly, quantile normalization is performed on the corrected PM probe intensities. Finally, a median polishing algorithm is used to
summarize the background-corrected, normalized probe
intensities to generate a final probe set value.
We also evaluated the utility of the MAS 5.0 probe set
summarization algorithm [28]. Briefly, the signal is calculated as follows: i) global background correction, ii)
ideal MM value is calculated and subtracted to adjust
the PM intensity, iii) adjusted PM intensities are logtransformed to stabilize the variance, iv) biweight estimation to provide a robust mean of the resulting values,
and finally v) probe set intensity signal is scaled using a
trimmed mean.
Making Accurate Gene Present/Absent Calls

In addition to summarizing probe set intensities, it is
also desirable to make absolute gene present/absent
calls. We assessed two novel methods for determining
the status of each gene using the hybridization intensities from the four E. coli strains that are represented on
this array. The first method was included in the standard Affymetrix GCOS analysis package and is referred
to as the MAS 5.0 Gene Detection approach [28]. Here
gene targets are determined to be either present, absent,
or marginal as determined by a p-value calculated from
the discrimination score (R) for each probe pair. The
discrimination score is a basic property of a probe pair
that describes its ability to detect its intended target. It
measures the target-specific intensity difference of the
probe pair (PM-MM) relative to its overall hybridization
intensity (PM+MM). The discrimination score (R) is
PM − MM
therefore defined as: R =
and approaches 1.0
PM + MM
as the mismatch probe intensity approaches 0.
The next step in calculating a detection p-value is to
compare each discrimination score to the user-definable

Jackson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/349

threshold Tau. Tau is a small positive number that can
be adjusted to increase or decrease sensitivity and/or
specificity of the analysis.
Increasing the threshold Tau can reduce the number
of false positive (present) calls but may also reduce the
number of true present calls. We found that the most
accurate gene detection calls were made when using a
Tau value of 0.20. Next, the one-sided Wilcoxon Signed
Rank test is employed to generate the detection p-value.
It assigns each probe pair a rank based on how far the
probe pair discrimination score is from Tau. The detection p-value is then compared to a user-definable cutoff
value that results in the final present/absent call for
each gene. Here again, we evaluated several cut-off
values for the detection p-value and found that a value
of 0.050 provided highly accurate gene detection calls.
That is, probe sets with detection p-values <0.05 were
scored as “present”, and greater than, or equal to, 0.05
as “absent”.
The second method that we used for determining the
status of a particular gene target is analogous to the
more conventional methods of CGH where a reference
strain is used to determine relative hybridization intensities. Here, we calculated a “RefMax” value for each
probe set by determining the maximum hybridization
intensity (RMA summarized) from each of the four
reference strains represented on the array. Therefore,
“RefMax” represents the maximum observed hybridization intensity for each probe set as determined by the
appropriate reference strain to which the probe set was
designed (for example, the RefMax for probe set j is calculated as: RefMax j = Max(CFT073 j , EDL933j , Sakai j ,
MG1655j)). Absolute probe set intensities for each of
the 207 hybridization experiments performed were compared to the RefMax data. For strain i, probe set j,
RefMax Ratio is defined as:
Re fMaxij Ratio = log2

strainij
refMaxj

For each probe set, gene targets were scored as
“absent” if their hybridization intensities were greater
than 4-fold lower from the RefMax value. Otherwise,
genes were scored as “present”.
Phylogenetic Analysis of E. coli Genome Data

Tables containing 10,208 MAS 5.0 Present/Absent calls
(described above) were transformed into A/T binary
nucleotide calls for each isolate. Tables were then
wrapped/concatenated into fasta-formatted text files.
Fasta text files were then used directly as input for the
MEGA5 software package [29]. Phylogenetic analysis
was performed using the maximum likelihood method.

Results
In the present study, we interrogated the genomic content of 207 isolates of E. coli and Shigella using the
Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, choosing to explore both the level of diversity that existed
among closely related strains of the same pathotypes (i.
e. independent O157:H7 strains) and the level of genomic diversity that existed among a globally diverse collection of E. coli strains (i.e. the ECOR collection). From
this analysis, we were able to determine, with high accuracy, the gene content of each of these strains relative to
those probes represented on the array.
Probe Set Summarization Methods: RMA vs. MAS 5.0

In Figure 1, we demonstrate the advantage of using
RMA over MAS 5.0 by comparing summarized probe
set intensities from the two reference O157:H7 strains,
EDL933 and Sakai. From the scatter plots in Figure 1, it
is apparent that the RMA probe summarization method
(Figure 1A) yields a much lower variance in probe sets
where intensities are less than 8 (log2) as compared to
MAS 5.0 probe set summarization method (Figure 1B).
This decrease in variance allows for a more accurate
determination of actual gene differences between these
two strains. This is even more apparent when relative
probe intensities (log 2 [Sakai]/[EDL933]) are plotted.
Summarized probe set intensities from the MAS 5.0
method result in large fold-change differences (Figure
1D), suggesting, incorrectly, the presence of genomic
differences at these loci (false positives). However,
RMA’s ability to reduce this variability (Figure 1C) provides a much higher confidence in accurately identifying
true genomic differences (fewer false positives). Because
we feel that RMA is a better method for summarizing
probe set intensities, we performed all downstream analyses (hierarchical clustering, Pearson correlation matrix,
and PCA) using RMA summarized probe set intensity
data.
Determining the Status of Gene Targets: RefMax vs. MAS
5.0

Using RefMax we found that >99.85% (5653/5654) of
the target genes that shared >98% sequence homology
to a particular probe set were accurately detected as
“present” as shown in Table 2. Also, 64% of the genes
sharing 96%-98% sequence homology are called “present” and when homology decreases to between 94%96%, only 27% of the probe targets are called “present”.
Here we are not always attempting to score these present/absent calls as either “correct” or “incorrect” but
rather simply report our finding that the probe set
design used here is capable of discriminating among closely related genes sharing >90% sequence homology

Gene present/absent calls were determined for the 4 sequenced reference strains represented on the array using either the RefMax or MAS 5.0 gene detection
methods. Genome corresponds to the accession number of the genome/strain being interrogated. Homology Bin corresponds to the percentage by which a
probe set consensus sequence matches the target genome sequence. Genes Present corresponds to the number of genes present on the array which fall into a
particular Homology Bin (this is also the maximum number of correct “present” calls). Present or Absent calls were determined from either the MAS 5.0 or
RefMax method and are shown under the “MAS5” and “RefMax” headings. Strains MG1655, EDL933, and Sakai were each performed in duplicate to show the
reproducibility of each method. Independent measurements are indicated by a “/” under the Present and Absent headers.

[30]. Also shown in Table 2, using MAS 5.0, 99.83% of
the probe sets having >98% homology to their target
gene were scored correctly as “present”. Further, 55% of
the probe sets having between 96%-98% sequence
homology to their gene target were called as “present”.
In comparison to the MAS 5.0 method, the RefMax
method is more sensitive to sequence variation between
the probe set and its gene target. This clearly can be
seen when sequence homologies between probe sets and
gene targets are relatively low (between 90%-92%). In
these instances, the MAS 5.0 method called 22.4% of
the gene targets as “present” whereas our RefMax
method only called 5.6% of these gene targets as “present”. Furthermore, a clear advantage of using the MAS

5.0 method for scoring genes was its ability to accurately
call genes as being “present” regardless of the overall
probe intensities. For example, in three instances, where
gene target lengths were below 100 nt and corresponding probe set intensities were in the bottom 2% of all
probe set intensities on the array, the Affymetrix MAS
5.0 method correctly predicted the status of these gene
targets in each of the reference strains a total of 19 out
of 21 times. This corresponds to an accuracy of 90%
(10% false negatives) for probe sets having intensities in
the bottom 2% of all probe sets.
While having the advantage of being able to detect
genes correctly despite sometimes having low absolute
probe intensities, the MAS 5.0 method was found to be

Jackson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/349

only 95% reproducible when comparing replicate experiments of a single reference strain. When “absent” and
“marginal” calls were not considered separately, however, this reproducibility increased to 97% (i.e. “A” or
“M” = “A/M”) (as in Table 2). When examining the
reproducibility of our RefMax method, we observed that
well over 99.9% of all gene status calls from replicate
experiments agreed. This level of reproducibility was
based on whether at least a 4-fold difference was
observed for any probe set from replicate experiments.
The lack of reproducibility in the MAS 5.0 method
appears to be a function of the level of gene homology
and not necessarily absolute probe signal, whereas our
RefMax method was independent of either of these
factors.
When using our RefMax method for making gene status calls, it is necessary to apply a user-defined cut-off
value for RefMax in order to account for probe sets that
are present on the E. coli v2.0 array, yet absent in all
four of the reference strains represented on this array.
We have observed a total of 145 probe sets on this E.
coli 2.0 array which do not appear to have target genes
present in any of the four reference strains. This was
confirmed by BLASTing these probe set sequences
against the reference genome sequences. As expected,
the RefMax intensity was found to be in the lower 1.5%
of all probe intensities which suggests an “absent” gene
target. Of these 145 probe sets, 72 corresponded to
Affymetrix control probes (probe sets designated with
“AFFX-” prefix). The remaining 73 probe sets corresponded to genes encoded by various phages, transposons, plasmids as well as several known antibiotic
resistance genes. These probe sets were included by
Affymetrix due to their relevance to microbial pathogens. Therefore, RefMax values whose absolute probe
set intensities were < 9 were considered to be absent in
the reference strains. We therefore scored all probe sets
from non-reference strains that differed by less than 4fold from RefMax as “absent”. Only when a non-reference strain was found to have an absolute probe set
intensity 4-fold greater than the RefMax value were
these genes scored as “present”.
Likewise, one can use the MAS 5.0 technique
described above to make present/absent calls. Upon
doing so, we found that among the four reference
strains, there were a total of 151 probe sets that were
consistently called absent. Of these 151 probe sets, 73
corresponded to Affymetrix control probe sequences,
leaving 78 other (non-control) probe sets. One can then
expand this analysis from the four reference strains to
all 207 isolates analyzed in this study. Upon doing so,
we found 44 (non-control) probe sets that were consistently absent in all 207 E. coli and Shigella isolates
examined in this study. Again, these genes were mainly

Page 11 of 17

antibiotic resistance elements from species other than E.
coli or Shigella. Two notable exceptions were nine independent probe sets targeting Phage M13 genes as well
as the EDL933 gene Z2261 (and unknown protein associated with Rhs element).
As an additional confirmatory method, we compared
our MAS 5.0 gene present/absent calls with those determined by confirmatory PCR. The stx1 and stx2 genes
were chosen as targets. We interrogated 195 isolates for
the presence of these two genes by confirmatory PCR.
We found an agreement between present/absent calls in
193/195 cases (99%). The two discrepancies are thought
to be due to primer/probe specificity towards different
stx alleles (data not shown).

Discussion
Strain Attribution, Identification, and Discrimination
within the O157:H7 Pathotype

The genomic content of 63 unique strains (75 isolates)
of E. coli O157:H7 was assessed in order to determine
whether we could accurately distinguish between independent isolates of the same serotype. From this study,
we found that, on average, individual strains of O157:H7
differed by 197 gene targets (Additional File 1). Moreover, among this same group of isolates, we found that
a maximum of approximately 750 gene targets differed
among any two independent O157:H7 isolates (EC1214
vs. EC885). When individual strains were examined in
replicate, we found that a maximum of three gene target
differences may occur between replicates. Note, however, that these “replicates” could often be independent
isolates of the same strain and the observed gene differences may sometimes be due to known deletions that
are present in strains that were derived from a parent
strain (i.e. EC536 and EC1212 are isogenic). Next we
tested if any of our independent isolates were indistinguishable using this array-based method, i.e., were there
multiple isolates of the same strain. We found several
instances where there were fewer than 10 gene target
differences between two independent isolates (e.g.
EC1423 vs. EC423, EC514 vs. EC515 from Additional
File 1). In fact, we were able to make correlations
between isolates that were previously unknown and presumed to be independent. For example, strain 86-24 (a
human isolate from Washington State in 1986) differed
from strain EC533 by a single gene difference. Upon
further inspection of the history of these strain designations, we found that EC533 was also a human isolate
from Washington State, also obtained in 1986. It is
therefore likely that these two isolate designations actually refer to the same strain that were received by our
laboratory from two different repositories. This precipitated a closer examination of the history of our strain
collection, which showed a few similar examples of this.

Jackson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/349

From a forensic perspective, this is a very important
finding as it suggests that this array-based method is not
only a powerful tool for discriminating among different
strains of the same serovar but also provides, with a
high level of confidence, a robust means for strain identification and attribution.
Exploring the Global Genomic Diversity of E. coli

The ECOR collection is a set of 72 reference strains of
E. coli isolated from a variety of hosts and geographical
locations [12]. It was established for use in studies of
variation and genetic structure in natural populations
and is representative of the range of phenotypic variation in the species as a whole. We therefore used this
well-studied collection to analyze the performance of
our array-based method in measuring the global diversity of E. coli. Among this collection, we found that individual strains differed, on average, by approximately
1900 gene target differences. Moreover, a maximum of
4002 gene target differences was observed between any
two strains (ECOR57 vs. ECOR37). This represents
approximately 40% of the probe targets present on this
array. In addition to the ECOR reference collection and
our O157:H7 reference collection, we included 50 other
E. coli and Shigella isolates in our analysis (Table 1). It
is interesting to note that some of the most diverse
strains included in this study were among the latter
non-ECOR, non-O157 strains. For example, the greatest
number of probe set differences, 4890, was observed
between an O157:H7 strain EC885 and the UPEC
CFT073 strain EC1521. While this number may seem
impossibly high, it is in fact representative of gene differences and allelic differences that exist between these
two evolutionarily distinct lineages of E. coli. Different
alleles are often represented by different probe sets on
the E. coli Genome 2.0 Array. Therefore, probe set differences do not always directly correspond to true gene
differences. A gene differences matrix was prepared by
calculating the number of gene differences that exists
among all 207 isolates examined in this study (Additional File 1). Similarly, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis on all of the strains included in this study
based on their RMA probe set summarized values.
Results from this analysis depict a strain-to-strain relatedness quantified from 0 to 1 (1 being identical). A
visual representation of this correlation matrix is shown
in Additional File 2 and is color-coded based on
relatedness.
In order to better understand the global diversity of E.
coli, we performed several cluster-based analyses. Using
the RMA-summarized data generated from all of the
probe sets, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis (Euclidean means) on the strains and gene targets to
demonstrate graphically the level of genomic diversity

that exists within this species (Additional File 3). The
dendrogram in Additional File 3 shows that the 207 isolates examined in this study cluster into three major
groups. The first cluster (left most) represents EHEC1
strains. The other two clusters cannot be clearly defined
by a particular set of traits and contain an assortment of
both serotypes and pathotypes.
To further demonstrate the relatedness and diversity
of the strains examined in this study, we performed a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on RMA-summarized probe set intensities from all 207 isolates. Upon
plotting the first three dimensions of the PCA data, we
color-coded the strain identifiers based on their serotype
(Figure 2A). From this, we observed that strains belonging to the same serotype often, but not always, cluster
together. It is worth noting that all serotypes are not
equally represented in the collection of isolates that
were examined in the current study, therefore it is not
possible to make conclusions regarding the clustering of
some serotypes. As pathotype information was available
for 128 of our isolates, a PCA was performed on these
isolates independently (Figure 2B). This PCA plot
showed strong clustering of isolates from the EHEC1
and EHEC2 pathotypes. Though these pathotypes have
similar clinical manifestations, their genomes are quite
distinct. While some strain of the same pathotype often
co-clustered, this was not universally true, therefore suggesting that virulence traits are inherited horizontally.
Indeed, this phenomenon has been reported previously
[31,32].
Examining the Conserved, Core, Backbone Genes of E. coli

Our array-based technique is well suited for determining
which genes are conserved in various types of E. coli.
Initially, we wanted to determine which gene targets
were present in all strains of E. coli and Shigella
included in this study. We found 2256 gene targets,
using the MAS 5.0 technique described above, that were
consistently present in all 207 isolates examined (Additional File 4). We define these gene targets as being the
core/conserved genic regions that make up the E. coli
genomic backbone. Similar analyses have been performed previously on whole genome sequence data [33].
From these in silico analyses, approximately 2200 conserved core genes were identified. Therefore, previous in
silico analyses correlate well with our microarray-based
approach.
Moreover, because the Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli
Genome 2.0 Array represents intergenic regions from
the MG1655 genome, we were also able to assess the
conserved intergenic regions as well. In total, there are
686 unique probe sets representing 240.9 kb of intergenic sequences (Additional File 5). Of these, we found
232 unique probe sets that were conserved (always

present) in all 207 isolates analyzed. These 232 probe
sets represent 76.8 kb of conserved intergenic
sequences. Assuming an average genome size of 5 Mb,
this suggests that strains of E. coli share approximately
1.5% of conserved intergenic sequences.
Defining the EHEC Pathotype-Specific Genes

Because we examined a large number (63) of O157:H7
strains and a large number of non-O157:H7 strains, we
are also able to make conclusions on which genes are
responsible for defining the O157:H7 serotype. That is,
which genes are always present in O157:H7 strains but
never present in non-O157:H7 strains. For this analysis,
we included only O157:H7 strains and excluded O157:
H- and “O157” (EC1522, EC1523, EC510, EC1427)
strains. As might be expected, most genes fitting this
criterion engender information for the biosynthesis of
the O and H antigens (Table 3).
Phylogenetic Analysis of E. coli Genomes Using
Microarray Data

Extant populations of E. coli are structured into main
phylogenetic groupings. The evolutionary history of E.
coli has usually been recapitulated employing Multi
Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis of the ECOR
collection. However, it has been shown that a correlation
exists between the phylogenetic history of the strains and
the presence/absence of genes. We compared our whole-

genome microarray analysis approach to the main phylogenetic groups of the ECOR collection previously defined
and based on MLST data. For the most part, our whole
genome analysis of the ECOR collection correlated well
with previous designated phylogenetic groups as shown
in Figure 3. There were, however, several notable exceptions. For example, strains ECOR70, ECOR71, and
ECOR72 that were previously defined in group B1 were,
by our analysis, found to be part of group A (shown in
Figure 3 as A*). And, notably, as with MLST, array analysis showed group D strains to be more heterogeneous
than other groupings, seemingly reflecting diverse and
distinct lineages of Group D strains.
One might a priori expect disagreement between our
whole-genome approach and previous MLST analyses.
That is, whereas MLST is an approximation of the
mutation rate of the genomic backbone based on
sequence analysis of a relatively small number of housekeeping genes, analysis of whole genome differences is a
measure of both the rate of mutation and horizontal
gene transfer that exists among this species. These two
analyses are quite different and distinct. So it is therefore interesting to find such a remarkably high level of
correlation between these two different approaches.

Conclusions
The current study is an in depth analysis of the genomic
content of a large and diverse collection of E. coli

Using the MAS 5.0 gene detection method, we filtered those probe sets that were consistently called “present” in all O157:H7 strains yet were called “absent” in
all non-O157:H7 strains. The 14 probe sets shown here correspond to O157:H7-specific genes.

Figure 3 Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method: The evolutionary history was inferred by using the
Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model [35]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-282250.6332) is shown. Initial
tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When the number of common sites was < 100 or less than one fourth of
the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is
drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. There were a total of 10208 positions in the final dataset.

strains, including strains of the closely related genus Shigella. By utilizing a high-density oligo array representing
10,112 unique probe sets, we were able to qualitatively
describe the complete gene repertoire of each of 183
unique strains. In so doing, we found that diverse strains
can differ by as many as 4890 probe set targets, e.g.,
CFT073 strain EC1521 and the O157:H7 strain EC885.
We found that, among the 207 independent isolates
examined in the present studies, individual strains differed, on average, by 2276 probe sets, and the median
number of probe set differences was 2597. When one
focuses on only the EHEC-like isolates (Additional File
3, cluster 1), we found that there are 2321 probe sets
that are variable among this EHEC cluster. On average,
EHEC cluster 1 strains differed by 197 probe sets.
We also examined how our microarray-based method
was able to recapitulate the phylogenetic history of isolates. Using the maximum-likelihood method, we found
a remarkable level of correlation between previous
MLST-based results and our current microarray-based
results. While these two approaches differ, in some
cases however, these two analyses may be regarded as
highly similar. Many of the probe sets on the E. coli
Genome 2.0 array are in fact representatives of different
alleles of the same gene. We give as an example the
mutS gene: the mutS gene is >95% conserved in nucleotide sequence in strains Sakai, MG1655, and CFT073.
However, on the E. coli 2.0 array, there are three different probe sets that represent these three allelic variants
of mutS. Importantly, the hybridization-based strategy
utilized here is capable of discriminating between these
three alleles [30]. So, indeed, our microarray approach
is, in some cases, is also a measure of allelic diversity
that exist among housekeeping genes. This is highly
analogous to an MLST-based assay.
It is tempting to speculate on the minimal number of
gene differences observed between any two independent
isolates derived from the same culture. However, we will
refrain from making any specific qualitative remarks to
this regard. The reason is simply one of semantics in
that the definition of “independent isolates” varies based
on perspective. For example, a clinician might refer to

two isolates derived from the same patient on different
days as being “independent”. Yet from a genomics point
of view, these two isolates may well be the same strain
as measured by their genomic content.
The concept and definition of “independent isolates”
and “different strains” came to light in our investigation
of the 2006 outbreak of O157:H7 associated with fresh
spinach. During this outbreak, we interrogated >200
“independent isolates” that were geographically diverse
(different clinical isolates from different states across the
country or various food isolates). Collectively, we
referred to these isolates as the “outbreak population”.
All of the isolates contained within this outbreak population, with the exception of two, were genomically
indistinguishable (no probe set differences). The two
exceptions differed by a single phage-related insertion.
This difference resulted in the appearance of approximately 40 probe set differences, a result later confirmed
independently in our laboratory by optical mapping and
whole genome sequencing [34]. So, the question of
minimal gene differences can only be answered accurately in the context of the whole genome. Whereas
these 40 gene differences might indicate a new strain,
clearly they were derived from the same population of
E. coli O157:H7 that caused the outbreak; i.e., they were
indeed siblings within the outbreak population.
It is imperative to consider, as technology allows us to
delve deeper into the bacterial genome, that individual
strains and independent isolates are not synonymous
terms. That deriving isolates from a single sick individual
on different days; diluting and plating a single cultured
sample onto several plates and subsequently deriving isolates from different plates; deriving isolates from different
patients sickened during a single foodborne outbreak; or
obtaining isolates from different environmental samples,
are all valid examples of what “independent isolates”
denote. These independent isolates, however, may, but
need not, be individual strains. That is, if differences, no
matter how subtle, are observed in genome comparisons
of two independent isolates, sensu stricto, they are two
individual strains. In contrast, if no distinguishing differences are seen between two isolates, then they are

technologies and their attendant discriminatory powers
are utilized in such investigations.

While our manuscript was under peer review, Clermont et al. reported similar
findings based on an MLST analysis (Infect Genet Evol., 2011, 11:654-662). By
our analysis, we suggest that ECOR strains 70, 71, and 72 have the same
lineage as ECOR phylo group A (not B1, as reported previously). Clermont et
al. state that ECOR strains 70 and 72 belong in an entirely different lineage
(group C). Also, Clermont et al. reports ECOR71 strain still belonging in group
B1, just as previous MLST data had suggested, and contrary to our findings.
