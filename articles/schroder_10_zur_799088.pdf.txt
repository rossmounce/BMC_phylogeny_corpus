ATCC 13032

Abstract
Background: Zinc is considered as an essential element for all living organisms, but it can be toxic at large
concentrations. Bacteria therefore tightly regulate zinc metabolism. The Cg2502 protein of Corynebacterium
glutamicum was a candidate to control zinc metabolism in this species, since it was classified as metalloregulator
of the zinc uptake regulator (Zur) subgroup of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) family of DNA-binding transcription
regulators.
Results: The cg2502 (zur) gene was deleted in the chromosome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 by an allelic
exchange procedure to generate the zur-deficient mutant C. glutamicum JS2502. Whole-genome DNA microarray
hybridizations and real-time RT-PCR assays comparing the gene expression in C. glutamicum JS2502 with that of
the wild-type strain detected 18 genes with enhanced expression in the zur mutant. The expression data were
combined with results from cross-genome comparisons of shared regulatory sites, revealing the presence of
candidate Zur-binding sites in the mapped promoter regions of five transcription units encoding components of
potential zinc ABC-type transporters (cg0041-cg0042/cg0043; cg2911-cg2912-cg2913), a putative secreted protein
(cg0040), a putative oxidoreductase (cg0795), and a putative P-loop GTPase of the COG0523 protein family (cg0794).
Enhanced transcript levels of the respective genes in C. glutamicum JS2502 were verified by real-time RT-PCR, and
complementation of the mutant with a wild-type zur gene reversed the effect of differential gene expression. The
zinc-dependent expression of the putative cg0042 and cg2911 operons was detected in vivo with a gfp reporter
system. Moreover, the zinc-dependent binding of purified Zur protein to double-stranded 40-mer oligonucleotides
containing candidate Zur-binding sites was demonstrated in vitro by DNA band shift assays.
Conclusion: Whole-genome expression profiling and DNA band shift assays demonstrated that Zur directly
represses in a zinc-dependent manner the expression of nine genes organized in five transcription units.
Accordingly, the Zur (Cg2502) protein is the key transcription regulator for genes involved in zinc homeostasis in C.
glutamicum.

Background
Corynebacterium glutamicum is a gram-positive soil
bacterium that is well-established for the industrial production of several L-amino acids [1,2]. The complete
genome sequence of the type strain C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 is available [3], and it was screened by
bioinformatic tools to predict the repertoire of DNAbinding transcription regulators in this organism [4,5].
Transcription regulators represent key components in
the control of bacterial gene expression and permit the
cell to sense and respond to environmental changes [6].

Amongst others, metal ion homeostasis in bacterial cells
is tightly regulated by specific metal-sensing transcription regulators. These metalloregulatory proteins, in
principle, sense the intracellular levels of specific metal
ions by binding them to a metal binding site, which
leads to conformational changes affecting the regulator’s
ability to bind operator sites in regulatory DNA regions
[7]. Prominent protein families of metalloregulators are
DtxR [8], MerR [9], SmtB/ArsR [10], and Fur [11]. The
ferric uptake regulator Fur was originally described as
iron-sensing repressor of genes involved in siderophore
biosynthesis and iron transport in Escherichia coli
[12,13], but Fur also activates the expression of many
genes by either direct or indirect mechanisms and can

be regarded as global transcription regulator of iron
homeostasis in E. coli [14]. Numerous studies indicated
a tremendous diversity in metal selectivity and biological
function within the Fur protein family that can be
divided into sensors of iron (Fur), manganese (Mur),
nickel (Nur), and zinc (Zur) [14].
Zinc is considered an essential nutrient for all living
organisms. As zinc can be toxic at large concentrations
[15], zinc uptake, efflux, storage, and metabolism is in
general tightly regulated in bacteria [16]. During our
work on reconstructing the transcriptional regulatory
network of C. glutamicum [5,17], we recognized the
Cg2502 protein as candidate to control the zinc metabolism in this species, since it was classified as DNA-binding transcription regulator of the Fur family [4] and iron
metabolism is under global control of the dual regulator
Cg2103, a member of the DtxR protein family [18]. In
this study, comparative whole-genome DNA microarray
hybridizations revealed a set of differentially expressed
genes that are under transcriptional control by Cg2502
(now named Zur). Comparative genomic analysis of Zur
regulons in actinobacteria detected candidate Zur-binding sites within the mapped promoter regions of potential target genes in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. The
DNA binding of Zur to these operator sites occurred in
a zinc-dependent manner and was verified by DNA
band shift assays, providing clear evidence that Zur is
involved in zinc-dependent transcriptional regulation of
gene expression in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032.

Results
Annotation of the corynebacterial zinc uptake regulator
Zur

The Cg2502 (Zur) protein of C. glutamicum ATCC
13032 has a predicted size of 144 amino acids, a theoretical molecular mass of 15.7 kDa and belongs to the
small core set of 24 transcription regulators that were
detected in all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial genomes [5,19]. Protein domain predictions performed with
the SUPERFAMILY [20] and the Conserved Domain
Database tools [21] showed that the Zur protein contains an amino-terminal helix-turn-helix motif of the
winged-helix type and is a member of the Zur (zinc
uptake regulator) subgroup of the Fur (ferric uptake regulator) family of metalloregulatory proteins [14].
According to BLASTP data [22], the C. glutamicum Zur
protein revealed high amino acid sequence similarities
to orthologous proteins encoded in other sequenced
corynebacterial genomes, ranging from 56% to 80%
identical amino acids (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Zur orthologues in other actinobacteria are well conserved and
corroborated by the phylogenetic tree for these proteins
(Fig. 1B). The Zur orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (57% identity with Cg2502) is the zinc

metalloregulator FurB, whose crystal structure has been
elucidated recently [23]. The multiple alignment of Zur
proteins from actinobacteria demonstrates the conservation of all amino acid residues forming three distinct
zinc binding sites in the FurB protein (Fig. 1A). The
zinc binding site 1 is surrounded by conserved aspartate,
cysteine and histidine residues, whereas the zinc binding
site 2 is represented by a cluster of four cysteines. The
putative zinc binding site 3 is build by three histidines
and one glutamate, but the exact biological function of
this protein site remains to be determined [23]. These
structural protein data strongly suggested that the
Cg2502 (Zur) protein of C. glutamicum is a zinc-binding
protein and involved in the transcriptional regulation of
zinc metabolism in this species.
According to comparative genomic analysis, the
cg2502 (zur) gene of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 is
located in a conserved gene region in all hitherto
sequenced corynebacterial genomes (Fig. 2A). In the
genomes of C. glutamicum, C. efficiens, C. diphtheriae,
C. aurimucosum, and C. accolens, all representing members of the main lineage of the genus Corynebacterium
[24,25], the zur gene is located downstream of another
regulatory gene (znr) encoding a putative metal-sensing
transcription regulator of the SmtB/ArsR protein family
[4,10]. In genomes of corynebacteria belonging to the C.
jeikeium and C. kroppenstedtii branches, the overall
location of the zur gene is also conserved, but an orthologue of znr is lacking in front of the zur coding region
(Fig. 2A). Since the orthologous protein of Znr from M.
tuberculosis H37Rv (Rv2358) is apparently involved in
zinc-dependent transcriptional (auto)regulation of the
rv2358-furB operon [26], the homologous znr-zur gene
region of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 may also encode
the regulatory switches involved in controlling the zinc
homeostasis in this organism.
Transcriptional organization of the znr-zur gene region in
C. glutamicum

Operon predictions for C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
suggested that the znr-zur genes are expressed as bicistronic transcript [27]. To provide experimental support
for this prediction, the transcription of the znr-zur
region was analyzed by marker gene expression using
the green fluorescent protein encoded on the promoterprobe vector pEPR1 [28]. Both the znr upstream region
and the znr-zur intergenic region were tested for promoter activity in E. coli DH5a MCR and C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 (Fig. 3). For this purpose, a 141-bp DNA
fragment covering the znr upstream region and a 107bp DNA fragment containing the 40-bp znr-zur intergenic region were amplified by PCR and cloned in front
of the promoterless gfp gene present on pEPR1. The
expression of gfp was detected by fluorescence microscopy only with a pEPR1 derivative containing the znr

upstream region, indicating the presence of a promoter
in front of znr and supporting the view that znr and zur
are organized as operon. This observation was further
strengthened by detecting with RT-PCR a 309-bp cDNA
fragment that encompasses the intergenic region on the
znr-zur transcript (data not shown). The promoter in
front of the znr gene was deduced from RACE-PCR
experiments with total RNA purified from C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 cultures, showing that transcription
starts at a guanine residue located 45 nucleotides
upstream of the GTG start codon of znr (Fig. 2B). Based
on the known consensus motif for corynebacterial promoters [29], potential -10 (TAAAAT) and -35
(CTCATA) promoter regions with an 18-bp spacing and
a putative up-element [30] were detected (Fig. 2B).
Computational identification of actinobacterial Zur
regulons

We applied comparative genomic techniques such as
cross-genome comparison of shared regulatory sites [6]
to reconstruct Zur regulons in the genomes of eight
Corynebacterium species, as well as other representative
members of the taxonomic class Actinobacteria (four
Mycobacterium species, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptomyces coelicolor, Leifsonia xyli, Thermobifida fusca,
and Bifidobacterium longum). Initially, we collected the
upstream regions of candidate zinc uptake genes
(znuACB) in the analyzed actinobacterial genomes and
applied the motif recognition program SignalX. The
identified 21-bp palindromic motif (Fig. 4B) was similar
to previously identified Zur-binding motifs in M. tuberculosis and S. coelicolor [31-33]. We constructed a positional-weight matrix for the identified Zur-binding motif
and applied it to scan the genomes of actinobacteria for
additional candidate Zur-binding sites. After filtering of
false-positive sites by the consistency check approach
and accounting for possible operon structures, we combined the final list of predicted members of the Zur regulons in the analyzed genomes of actinobacteria (see
additional file 1) (Fig. 4A).
Overall, a conserved core of the reconstructed Zur regulons includes one or multiple paralogues of the zinc
ABC-type transporter ZnuACB and a putative P-loop
GTPase of the COG0523 family [34], orthologues of the
B. subtilis YciC protein [35]. In Mycobacterium species,
P. acnes, S. coelicolor, and L. xyli, the Zur regulon
includes paralogues of various ribosomal proteins
(RpmB, RpmG, RpmE, RpmF, RpmJ, RpsN, RpsR).
These observations are in agreement with the previously
described Zur-dependent regulation of ribosomal protein genes in M. tuberculosis and S. coelicolor [31-33].
The znr-zur operon is preceded by a candidate Zurbinding site only in two Mycobacterium species (Fig.
4A). The C. diphtheriae Zur regulon includes the candidate ABC-type metal transporter operon troA-sapD-

DIP0439-DIP0440-DIP0441-DIP0442 and the cmrA gene
encoding a surface-associated protein [36]. Additional
candidate Zur-binding sites were detected upstream of
the adhA gene encoding zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase in C. glutamicum [37] and adhA orthologues
in C. accolens and C. diphtheriae (Fig. 4A).
Global gene expression profiling of the zur-mutant C.
glutamicum JS2502

To identify C. glutamicum genes that are under transcriptional control by Zur, the zur gene was deleted in
the chromosome of the wild-type strain C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 by an allelic exchange procedure, resulting
in the mutant strain C. glutamicum JS2502. Growth of
the zur-deficient mutant C. glutamicum JS2502 in minimal medium CGXII was indistinguishable from the parental wild-type strain (data not shown), indicating that
deregulation of the Zur regulon is not detrimental to
any basic physiological functions in C. glutamicum. The
genome-wide expression profile of C. glutamicum
JS2502 was compared with that of C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 by DNA microarray hybridizations. The
resulting ratio/intensity (m/a) plot of the normalized
data, based on two hybridization experiments with label
swapping, is presented in Fig. 5. By applying a ratio cutoff of ± 1, which is equivalent to relative expression
changes of at least two-fold, 23 genes exhibited higher
transcript levels in the zur mutant when compared to
the wild-type strain, whereas three genes showed lower
transcript levels in C. glutamicum JS2502.
Among the genes that are up-regulated in the zur
mutant, we detected five C. glutamicum transcription
units that are preceded by candidate Zur-binding sites:
cg2911-cg2912-cg2913, cg0040-cg0041-cg0042/cg0043 and
cg0794/cg0795 (Table 1). The first two operons encode
components of the putative zinc/manganese ABC-type
transporter ZnuACB and the putative secreted protein
Cg0040, whereas the latter genes encode a P-loop
GTPase of the COG0523 protein family (Cg0794 or
YciC) and a putative oxidoreductase of unknown physiological function (Cg0795), respectively. The adhA
gene, encoding a zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase
[37] and predicted to be a candidate member of the Zur
regulon with a conserved candidate Zur-binding site
(AATTGAAAAACATTTCCATTA), was not detected
as differentially expressed by DNA microarray hybridizations. In summary, genome-wide expression profiling
and motif searches revealed six transcription units of C.
glutamicum ATCC 13032 that were considered as
potential targets for a direct transcriptional control by
the zinc-sensing repressor Zur (Table 1).
The DNA microarray hybridization revealed 15 additional genes that were differentially expressed in the zur
mutant C. glutamicum JS2502 (Table 2). As most of the
corresponding m-values were close to the detection

limit of the DNA microarray, expression of this gene set
was furthermore examined by real-time RT-PCR. Using
this more sensitive detection method, the expression of
nine genes turned out to be significantly up-regulated in
the zur mutant (Table 2). Among several coding regions
of unknown function, this gene set includes cg1447 coding for a putative cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux transporter and cg3096 (ald) encoding acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase. In conjunction with the zinc-dependent
alcohol dehydrogenase, the Ald protein is involved in

the two-step utilization of ethanol as sole carbon and
energy source by C. glutamicum [38]. As none of the
genes is preceded by a candidate Zur-binding site, differential expression in C. glutamicum JS2502 is most
likely a secondary effect of the zur gene deletion.
Verification of differential gene expression and promoter
mapping

To support the conclusion that Zur is involved in transcriptional regulation of the potential target genes, control assays with a complemented C. glutamicum zur

mutant were performed, thereby measuring the differential gene expression by RT-PCR. For this purpose, the
zur gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the C.
glutamicum expression vector pEC-XK99E, resulting in
plasmid pEC-XK99E_zur (Table 3). First, the differential
expression of potential Zur target genes in C. glutamicum JS2502 was verified by real-time RT-PCR assays. As
expected, the mRNA levels of all genes were clearly
enhanced in the zur mutant when compared with the
wild-type strain (Table 1), with the exception of the
adhA gene (data not shown). Additional RT-PCR assays
with the complemented strain C. glutamicum JS2502
[pEC-XK99E_zur] showed that the expression of potential target genes was indistinguishable from that of the
wild-type strain ATCC 13032 carrying the empty cloning vector pEC-XK99E (data not shown). These results
clearly demonstrated that the observed deregulation of
gene expression can be attributed to the defined deletion of the zur gene in C. glutamicum JS2502.

To elucidate whether the detected candidate Zurbinding motif is relevant for transcriptional regulation of
the respective genes by Zur, the transcription start sites
were determined by 5’ RACE-PCR (Fig. 6). The mapped
transcription sites were used to deduce thereof the
respective promoter regions according to the corynebacterial consensus sequences for - 10 and - 35 regions
[29]. The transcription start sites in front of cg0042,
cg0043 and cg2911 were identical to the adenine residue
of the respective ATG start codons, indicating the presence of so-called leaderless transcripts that were
detected previously in C. glutamicum [29]. In all cases,
the candidate Zur-binding motif overlaps the deduced
core promoter regions (Fig. 6). Due to the short intergenic region (29 bp) between cg0042 and cg0043, a single candidate Zur-binding motif can be used to control
the expression of the divergently oriented transcription
units. The genetic organization of the cg0794-cg0795
intergenic region (118 bp) is more remarkable, as the

motifs overlapping the - 35 region in front of cg0794 or
cg0795 are both simultaneously located downstream of
the - 10 region belonging to the other gene (Fig. 6).
These locations of the candidate Zur-binding motifs are
consistent with the positions of operators used by
repressor proteins to exert negative transcriptional control of gene expression [39]. As the Zur binding sites
always overlap either the - 35 region or the entire - 10/-

35 region of its target promoters, Zur binding can block
the entry of the RNA polymerase and thereby repress
the transcription of the target genes. On the other hand,
the candidate Zur-binding motif detected in the adhA
gene region is located 167 nucleotides upstream of the
mapped transcription start site [37]. These experimental
data therefore indicated that five transcription units

cg0794/cg0795) are under negative transcriptional regulation by Zur in C. glutamicum.
Verification of zinc-dependent expression of the putative
cg0042 and cg2911 operons

As the putative operons cg0042 and cg2911 are apparently under negative control by the Zur protein in C. glutamicum, we investigated their zinc-dependent
expression in vivo by using again the promoterless gfp
reporter system. For this purpose, the mapped promoter
regions were amplified by PCR and cloned into the promoter-probe vector pEPR1. The resulting plasmids
pEPR1_prom_cg0042 and pEPR1_prom_cg2911 (Table 3)
were transferred into the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
wild-type strain and into the zur mutant C. glutamicum
JS2502 to detect differential gfp expression by real-time
RT-PCR, using high, low and chelated zinc conditions in
the growth medium (Fig. 7). C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
carrying the empty cloning vector pEPR1 served as reference for calculating the differential gene expression. In
the wild-type strain, the cloned promoters are apparently
repressed under high-zinc condition and are derepressed
under zinc-depletion, i.e. low-zinc condition and during
growth in the presence of the chelator N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN). A similar
deregulation of gene expression was detected in the zur
mutant C. glutamicum JS2502, irrespective of the presence or absence of zinc ions in the growth medium (Fig.
7). These in vivo data suggested that the lack of zincdependent regulation of gene expression is caused by the

absence of the Zur protein in C. glutamicum JS2502.
Furthermore, the data indicated that the Zur protein is
sensing zinc ions and that it binds to operator sequences
in the presence of zinc, thus acting as a repressor of the
cg0042 and cg2911 operons.
Verification of predicted Zur binding sites by in vitro DNA
band shift assays

To demonstrate experimentally the direct interaction of
Zur with the candidate Zur-binding motifs detected in
front of potential target genes, EMSAs were performed
using fluorescein-labeled 40-mer oligonucleotides containing the 21-bp motif in the center of native genomic
sequences (Fig. 8). For this purpose, the C. glutamicum
Zur protein was tagged with streptavidin and purified by
means of Strep-Tactin sepharose-packed columns (data
not shown). Retardation of the respective doublestranded 40-mer DNA fragments was observed when
the purified Zur protein and 50 μM ZnCl2 were added
to the DNA band shift assays (Fig. 8A). In the absence
of ZnCl2 no in vitro interaction of the purified Zur protein with the 40-mer DNA fragments was detected. A
40-mer sequence representing a regulatory gene region
with a LexA binding site located in front of cg0841 [40]
served as additional negative control. Likewise, Zur did
not interact in vitro with the 21-bp motif located
upstream of the adhA promoter region (Fig. 8A).
Furthermore, mutated versions of the 21-bp motifs were
generated by introducing transitions (Fig. 8B). In these
cases, the purified Zur protein failed to shift the

are shown as grey boxes. A stretch of ten nucleotides (boxed), located upstream of the cg2911 promoter region, revealed similarity to the right

mutated DNA sequences. On the other hand, transitions
introduced into the DNA segments flanking the 21-bp
motifs did not affect the in vitro binding of Zur (Fig.
8B). To better define the role of metals in the ability of
Zur to interact with its operators, EMSAs were performed in the presence of either 50 μM ZnCl2, MgSO4,
NiCl2, CuSO4, MnSO4, or FeSO4 using exemplarily the
21-bp motif located upstream of cg2911 (Fig. 8C). These
assays showed that the purified Zur protein was able to
interact with this DNA fragment in vitro in the presence
of either zinc or manganese ions. Similar observations
were reported from DNA binding assays with Zn-dependent regulators from M. tuberculosis [31] and B. subtilis
[41]. The four 21-bp motifs recognized by the purified
Zur protein in vitro were used to delineate their consensus sequence in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, which is
highly similar to the FurB (Zur) consensus binding site
from M. tuberculosis that was defined experimentally by
DNase I footprint analysis [31] (data not shown). In
summary, these results demonstrated the specific interaction of the Zur protein with the 21-bp operator motif
in the presence of zinc, thereby negatively controlling
the expression of nine genes belonging to the Zur regulon in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032.

Discussion
The zur gene encoding a zinc uptake regulator is
conserved in genomes of actinobacteria

In the present study, we have examined the regulatory
role of the C. glutamicum Zur protein (Cg2502) in the

direct transcriptional control of gene expression. Zur
was classified by protein domain pattern analysis as
member of the Zur subgroup of the Fur protein family
[4]. Fur proteins form a ubiquitous group of metalresponsive transcription regulators in many diverse bacterial lineages [14,42-44]. Comparative genomics
revealed the presence of more than one fur homologue
in most members of the taxonomic class Actinobacteria
whose genome sequences have been completely determined, indicating that a gene duplication event predated
the appearance of the last common ancestor of the actinobacteria [45]. A corresponding evolutionary model
suggested that the resulting paralogues maintained the
main biochemical properties of the ancestor regulator,
but became specialized for coordinating different metal
ions [45,46], including iron (Fur), manganese (Mur),
nickel (Nur), and zinc (Zur) [14]. An apparent gene loss
event occurred in the common ancestor of the corynebacteria, as Corynebacterium genomes do not contain
the furA gene encoding a regulator for oxidative stress
genes, but have the orthologous furB (zur) genes [45].
Accordingly, the zur gene product of C. glutamicum
belongs to the small set of 24 transcription regulators
that were detected in all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial genomes [5,19]. Moreover, synteny analyses
revealed a conserved chromosomal region surrounding
the zur gene in corynebacteria and other actinobacteria,
including Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Rhodococcus
species [45]. In these species, the zur gene is located
downstream of another regulatory gene encoding a

might be similar to that of Rv2358, i.e. both transcription regulators work together to optimally balance the
zinc concentration in the C. glutamicum cell. To verify
this conclusion, the target genes of Znr and its zincdependent interaction with the corresponding regulatory
DNA sites have to be determined in C. glutamicum in
future studies.
The set of genes differentially expressed in the zurmutant C. glutamicum JS2502 partially overlaps with the

putative metal-sensing transcription regulator of the
SmtB/ArsR protein family [10,45]. Both regulators might
be involved in controlling the balanced expression of
genes involved in zinc uptake and metabolism in some
actinobacteria [26,47]. In M. tuberculosis, the rv2358furB operon is (auto)regulated by Rv2358 [26] and functions as the regulatory interface between the control of
zinc uptake and efflux [47]. At low zinc concentrations,
Rv2358 negatively regulates expression of the zitA gene
for a zinc efflux system [31] and the transcription of
furB, thereby enabling the expression of FurB-regulated
genes, including genes for zinc uptake systems [26]. At
high zinc concentrations, Rv2358 does not bind to the
operator site in front of the rv2358-furB operon and, as
a consequence, zinc uptake is prevented by the regulatory action of FurB and an excess of zinc is pumped out
of the cell. Since the genomic localization and the transcriptional organization of the znr-zur operon in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 is similar to that of M.
tuberculosis H37Rv, the regulatory role of Cg2500 (Znr)

The combination of genome-wide transcriptional profiling by DNA microarray hybridization and in vitro DNA
band shift assays clearly demonstrated that the C. glutamicum Zur protein negatively controls the expression of
five transcription units with genes that are involved in
the zinc metabolism in this species. A comparison of
the transcriptomes of the zur-deficient mutant C. glutamicum JS2502 and the wild-type strain C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 revealed 18 genes with increased expression in the zur mutant JS2502. This gene set, representing the cellular response to zur-deficiency in C.
glutamicum JS2502, partially overlaps with a stimulon
detected recently in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 cells
grown with ethanol as the sole carbon and energy
source [38]. Growth of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 on
ethanol was characterized by enhanced expression levels
of 36 genes when compared with acetate- and glucosegrown cultures. The set of differentially expressed genes
detected in both genome-wide profiling studies include:
(i) cg0040 to cg0043 and cg2911 to cg2913 encoding
putative ABC-type uptake systems for zinc ions, (ii)
cg3096 encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and (iii)
cg3195 encoding a putative flavoprotein. On the other
hand, an enhanced expression of the Zur regulon members cg0794 and cg0795 was not deteced during growth
of C. glutamicum on ethanol. The genes for the putative
zinc uptake systems showed the largest increase of
mRNA levels in ethanol-grown cells of C. glutamicum,
which was explained by the higher demand of zinc due
to its incorporation into the zinc-dependent alcohol
dehydrogenase (AdhA) of C. glutamicum [38]. A candidate Zur-binding site was detected by cross-genome
comparisons in the upstream region of adhA (cg3107),
but the purified Zur protein did not bind to a corresponding 40-mer DNA sequence in vitro. In addition,
the adhA gene was not detected as differentially
expressed in the zur-deficient mutant C. glutamicum
JS2502. Therefore, our results did not provide any evidence that the candidate Zur-binding site is involved in
transcriptional regulation of adhA gene expression. The
integration of the detected regulatory interactions into
the database CoryneRegNet [48,49] revealed that the
Zur regulon forms a separate module in the transcriptional gene regulatory network model of C. glutamicum

and is thus not linked to the currently known network
supercluster [17]. Whether an additional carbon sourcedependent control of the Zur regulon by any kind of
coregulation or hierarchical interaction is established in
C. glutamicum remains to be elucidated.
Physiological function of genes belonging to the Zur
regulon of C. glutamicum

Since the metal ions sensed by members of the Fur protein family are considered, on the one hand, fundamental for bacterial growth and, on the other hand, toxic at
elevated levels, a strict balance between metal ion
uptake and efflux is essential for homeostasis [14]. The
target genes of the C. glutamicum Zur protein detected
in this study include two putative ABC-type transport
systems (Cg0041-Cg0043 and Cg2911-Cg2913), a putative secreted protein (Cg0040), a putative oxidoreductase
(Cg0795), and a putative P-loop GTPase of the
COG0523 family (Cg0794) that may specifically bind
Zn2+ ions [50]. We also showed that Zur binds to the
predicted operator sequences located in the mapped
promoter regions of the respective genes, which are
therefore under direct negative transcriptional control.
The deduced genetic organization of the cg0794-cg0795
intergenic region and the common transcriptional control of both genes via two Zur operator sites suggests a
functional link between the respective proteins. Since
some experimentally characterized members of the
COG0523 protein family of P-loop GTPases are socalled metallochaperones, such as HypB from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [51] and UreG from Helicobacter
pylori [52], the C. glutamicum P-loop GTPase Cg0794
may also function (eventually in conjuction with the oxidoreductase Cg0795) as a zinc-specific metallochaperone/insertase to enable the in vivo assembly of zinc-

containing proteins under environmental conditions of
zinc deficiency. Furthermore, Cg0794 is similar to YciC,
an abundant protein from B. subtilis postulated to function as a metallochaperone [35]. Expression of yciC in
B. subtilis occurs in a zinc-dependent manner that is
exerted by the B. subtilis Zur orthologue [49]. YciC-like
proteins are often members of the Zur regulons in proteobacteria and firmicutes and may be involved in the
specific binding and allocation of Zn2+ ions [53]. The
Cg2911 (ZnuA1) and Cg0041 (ZnuA2) proteins of C.
glutamicum belong to the TroA superfamily of metalbinding proteins that are predicted to function as initial
receptors in ABC-type transport systems of metal ions
[21], supporting the view that both systems are involved
in transport of divalent metal ions, such as Zn2+. The
transcriptional regulation of genes encoding zinc uptake
systems by Zur proteins seems to be common in actinobacteria, as the zur gene is located adjacent to znu operons in Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Acidothermus,
Nocardioides, Streptomyces, Thermobifida, and Rubrobacter species [45]. Likewise, genes encoding zinc ABCtype transport systems are under transcriptional control
by Zur in Streptococcus suis [54], Xanthomonas campestris [55] and Yersinia pestis [56].
The transcriptional regulation of znu operons was characterized during genome-wide analyses of zinc-responsive
regulators in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [31-33]. The genes regulated by Zur Mtub
encode three putative metal transporters, a group of ribosomal proteins and proteins belonging to the early secretory antigen target 6 (ESAT-6) cluster and the ESAT-6/
CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein 10) family [52]. Likewise,
Zur Scoe controls the expression of znuACB, located
upstream of zur and encoding a zinc uptake transporter,

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/12

and of genes for paralogous forms of ribosomal proteins
that are devoid of zinc-binding motifs and can therefore
replace, during zinc deficiency, their zinc-binding counterparts that can serve as zinc storage forms [32,33]. Three
DNA binding sites of ZurScoe were determined by DNase I
footprinting analysis, revealing the 7-1-7 inverted repeat
TGAAAATGATTTTCA as consensus sequence of potential operator sites [33]. This consensus sequence is similar
to the central region of the 10-1-10 inverted repeat (candidate Zur-binding site) detected in the C. glutamicum genome in the present study. Likewise, DNA protection
assays were used to identify Zur binding sites in the M.
tuberculosis genome sequence [31]. The deduced 10-1-10
inverted repeat is also similar to the consensus sequence
of Zur binding sites detected in the genome of C. glutamicum. Accordingly, the Zur binding sites in actinobacteria
are apparently represented by a conserved 21-bp palindromic sequence with a 1-bp non-palindromic center, as
shown by the Zur-binding motif sequence logo (Fig. 4B).

Conclusions
The combination of cross-genome comparison of shared
regulatory sites and whole-genome expression profiling
with DNA microarrays allowed us to deduce the Zur
regulon of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. It consists of
five transcription units covering nine genes and encoding the components of two potential ZnuACB zinc
transporters, a putative secreted protein, a putative oxidoreductase, and a putative P-loop GTPase of the
COG0523 protein family. In vivo expression studies and
in vitro DNA band shift assays demonstrated that Zur
directly represses the expression of its target genes in a
zinc-dependent manner. Accordingly, the Zur (Cg2502)
protein is the key transcription regulator for genes
involved in zinc homeostasis in C. glutamicum.

DNA preparation and PCR techniques

The preparation of plasmid DNA from E. coli cells was
performed by the alkaline lysis technique using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The protocol was
modified for C. glutamicum cells by using 20 mg ml-1
lysozyme in resuspension buffer P1 and by incubating
the assay at 37°C for 3 h. Chromosomal C. glutamicum
DNA was isolated as described previously [59]. DNA
restriction, analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis and
DNA ligation were performed according to standard
procedures [57]. The transformation of plasmid DNA
was carried out by electroporation using electrocompetent E. coli and C. glutamicum cells [60,61]. The DNA
amplification by PCR was performed with a PTC-100
thermocycler (MJ Research) and BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline) or Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). The PCR products were
purified with the PCR Purification Spin Kit (Qiagen). All
Oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased
from Operon Biotechnologies (see additional file 2).
Construction of a defined zur deletion in C. glutamicum

The gene SOEing procedure [62] was applied to establish a defined deletion of 195 nucleotides in the zur coding region. The PCR primers used for gene SOEing were
cg2502del1 to cg2502del4 (see additional file 2). The
resulting pK18mobsacB derivative, pK18mobsacB_Δzur
(Table 3), was applied to perform an allelic exchange by
homologous recombination in the chromosome of C.
glutamicum ATCC 13032 [63], resulting in the mutant
strain C. glutamicum JS2502. To complement the zur
mutant phenotype, a DNA fragment covering the complete coding region of zur was amplified by PCR with
the primer pair cg2502_compl1 and cg2502_compl2 (see
additional file 2), digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and
cloned in E. coli into the corresponding sites of shuttle
expression vector pEC-XK99E (Table 3).

Methods

Testing in vivo promoter activity

Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions

The upstream region of the zur (cg2500) gene and the
znr-zur intergenic region were amplified from chromosomal C. glutamicum DNA by PCR with the primer
pairs cg2500_GFP1-cg2500_GFP2 and cg2502_GFP1cg2502_GFP2, respectively (see additional file 2). The
PCR products were digested with appropriate enzymes
and cloned into compatibel sites of the promoter-probe
vector pEPR1 [28] that contains the promoterless gfp
reporter gene coding for the green fluorescent protein.
The reporter gene of pEPR1 will be expressed only if
the DNA fragment cloned in front of gfp contains an
active promoter [28]. The expression of the gfp gene in
E. coli DH5aMCR and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 was
detected by fluorescence microscopy with an Axiophot
microscope (Zeiss) at a 400-fold magnification. All digital GFP pictures were taken with an exposure time of
four seconds.

Bacterial strains and plasmids used and constructed in this
study are listed in Table 3. E. coli DH5a MCR was grown
at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium [57] and used for standard cloning procedures as well as for heterologous
expression of the C. glutamicum Zur protein. The induction of gene expression on the pASK-IBA5+ plasmid was
carried out in E. coli DH5aMCR using 200 ng ml-1 tetracycline. The wild-type strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
and the zur mutant C. glutamicum JS2502 were routinely
grown at 30°C in CGXII minimal medium containing 30
μg l-1 protocatechuic acid and 420 μg l-1 thiamine [58].
Antibiotics for plasmid selection were kanamycin (50 μg
ml-1 for E. coli and 25 μg ml-1 for C. glutamicum) and
ampicillin (200 μg ml-1 for E. coli). The growth of shakeflask cultures was monitored by measuring the optical
density at 600 nm with an Eppendorf BioPhotometer.

Measurement of in vivo promoter activity for cg0042 and
cg2911

To detect a zinc-dependent expression of the cg0042
and cg2911 operons, approx. 200 bp segments covering
the respective core promoter regions were amplified
from chromosomal C. glutamicum DNA by PCR with
the primer pairs cg0042_GFP1-cg0042_GFP2 and
cg2911_GFP1-cg2911_GFP2, respectively (see additional
file 2). The PCR products were cloned in E. coli
DH5aMCR into the promoter-probe vector pEPR1, providing a promoterless gfp reporter gene for subsequent
measurements [28]. The plasmids were transformed into
C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and the zur mutant C. glutamicum JS2502 by electroporation. The resulting
strains were grown in CGXII minimal medium containing 1 mg l-1 ZnSO4 (high Zn condition) and in CGXII
without additional ZnSO4 (low Zn condition). Additionally, the cells were exposed to 10 μM of the chelator N,
N,N’,N’-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine
(TPEN) for 3 h in CGXII minimal medium (Zn-chelated
condition). Expression of the gfp reporter gene was measured by real-time RT-PCR using the primers LCPrimer1_gfp and LCPrimer2_gfp (see additional file 2).
RNA techniques and DNA microarray hybridizations

The isolation and purification of total RNA from C. glutamicum cells was carried out as described previously
[64]. The transcript levels of genes were measured by
real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with the
LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Scince), using
the SensiMix One-Step Kit (Quantace). The differences
in gene expression between C. glutamicum JS2502 and
the wild-type strain ATCC 13032 were determined by
comparing the crossing points of two biological samples,
each measured with two technical replicates. The measured crossing point (CP) is the cycle at which PCR
amplification begins its exponential phase and is considered the point that is most reliably proportional to the
initial RNA concentration (Roche Applied Science). The
amounts of the mRNAs of the genes were normalized
on total RNA, and the relative change in transcription
rate was determined as 2-Δ CP , with ΔCP equal to the
difference of the measured crossing points for the test
and the control condition. The crossing points were calculated by the LightCycler software (Roche Applied
Science). The quality of the measurement was ensured
by melting curve analysis.
Transcription start sites were determined by using the
5’/3’ RACE Kit second generation according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science). Starting with 1 μg of total C. glutamicum RNA, this
approach enables the transcription of gene specific
mRNA sequences into first-strand cDNA with the
cDNA synthesis primer SP1 (see additional file 2). This
initial cDNA synthesis was followed by a further

Page 15 of 18

amplification with nested PCR using the gene specific
primer SP2 (see additional file 2). All PCR procedures
were performed according to the recommendations of
the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) with a PTC100 thermocycler (MJ Research). The PCR products
were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), and the resulting
plasmids were transferred into chemically competent E.
coli TOP10 cells. The cloned RACE-PCR products were
finally sequenced to determine the 5’ end of the mRNA
(IIT Biotech).
For global transcription profiling, hybridization of
whole-genome DNA microarrays was performed with
total RNA probes isolated from two independently
grown C. glutamicum cultures. The respective cDNA
samples were labeled with Cy3/Cy5 in one experiment
and with Cy5/Cy3 in the other one (label swapping).
Since each C. glutamicum DNA microarray contains
four spots per gene, a maximum of eight spots per
gene provided data for calculating differential gene
expression. To minimize the number of false-positive
signals, hybridization data were stringently filtered to
obtain genes with at least six statistically significant
values out of the eight technical replicates, applying an
error probability of less than 5% for the t-test [64].
The data normalization was carried out with the
LOWESS function, and t-test statistics were calculated
with the EMMA2 software package [65]. The microarray hybridization data were deposited in the CoryneRegNet database with identifier “delta_zur” and can be
downloaded for further analysis by using SOAP-based
web services [66].
Overexpression and purification of the C. glutamicum Zur
protein

To fuse the C. glutamicum Zur protein with an aminoterminal streptavidin (strep)-tag, the coding region of
the zur gene was amplified by PCR with the primer pair
cg2502_fwd_5Strep and cg2502_rev_5Strep (see additional file 2), which were created by using the IBA Primer D’Signer1.1 software (IBA BioTAGnology). The
resulting PCR product was digested with BsaI and
cloned into pASK-IBA5+ to give plasmid pASK-IBA5
+_cg2502 (Table 3) that was transferred to E. coli DH5a
MCR. Cell culturing, overexpression of the recombinant
Zur protein and purification with Strep-Tactin sepharose-packed columns were carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The RiboLyser instrument
was used for cell disruption, with a speed rate of 6.5 for
two time intervals of 30 s and ice-cooling of 1 min inbetween. The concentration of the eluated protein was
determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories), and the eluate was analyzed by SDSPAGE. To verify the purification of the Zur protein, an
in-gel digestion with modified trypsin (Promega) was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/12

carried out. A peptide mass fingerprint of the purified
protein was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
spectrometry, applying an Ultraflex mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics) and the MASCOT software.
DNA band shift assays with streptavidin-tagged Zur
protein

Purified Zur protein was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine its ability to
interact with in silico predicted operators in dependence
on zinc. EMSAs were performed using fluoresceinlabeled 40-mer oligonucleotides that were annealed with
complementary oligonucleotides to double-stranded
DNA fragments by heating for 5 min at 94°C and cooling on ice for 15 min. The binding assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 0.05 pmol
of the double-stranded 40-mer, 40 pmol of strep-tagged
Zur protein, 0.06 μg herring sperm DNA, and binding
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 50
μg ml -1 bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol; pH 8.0).
EDTA was added to the binding reaction to a final concentration of 400 μM [31]. Ions (ZnCl2, MgSO4, NiCl2,
CuSO4, MnSO4, or FeSO4) were added to EMSAs in a
concentration of 50 μM. The assays were incubated at
30°C for 30 min and separated in 2% agarose gels prepared in gel buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM sodium
acetate, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.8). A voltage of 70 V was
applied for 1 h. The agarose gels were scanned with a
Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences Europe).
Bioinformatic methods and comparative genomic analysis
of Zur regulons

The complete genomes of actinobacteria were downloaded from GenBank [67]. The Actinobacteria-specific
training set for the identification of the Zur-binding
motif was composed of the candidate zinc transporter
genes znuABC. The DNA motif search profiles (a positional-weight matrix) were constructed using the SignalX program. Analyzed genomes were scanned with
the constructed Zur-binding motif profile using the
Genome Explorer software [68], and the identified genes
with candidate Zur-binding sites were analyzed by the
consistency check comparative procedure as previously
described [6]. Positional nucleotide weights in the recognition profile and Z-scores of candidate sites were calculated as the sum of the respective positional nucleotide
weights [69]. The threshold for the site search was
defined as the lowest score observed in the training set
(Z-score = 4.8). The sequence logo for the consensus
Zur-binding motif in Actinobacteria was constructed
using WebLogo 2.0 [70]. The phylogenetic trees were
constructed by the maximum likelihood method implemented in the PROML program of the PHYLIP package
[71] using multiple sequence alignments of protein

sequences produced by the Clustal W2 program [72].
The deduced regulatory interactions were stored in the
CoryneRegNet database [48].
