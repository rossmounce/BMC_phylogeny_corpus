Abstract
Background: The cladistic approach proposed by Templeton has been presented as promising for
the study of the genetic factors involved in common diseases. This approach allows the joint study
of multiple markers within a gene by considering haplotypes and grouping them in nested clades.
The idea is to search for clades with an excess of cases as compared to the whole sample and to
identify the mutations defining these clades as potential candidate disease susceptibility sites.
However, the performance of this approach for the study of the genetic factors involved in complex
diseases has never been studied.
Results: In this paper, we propose a new method to perform such a cladistic analysis and we
estimate its power through simulations. We show that under models where the susceptibility to
the disease is caused by a single genetic variant, the cladistic test is neither really more powerful to
detect an association nor really more efficient to localize the susceptibility site than an individual
SNP testing. However, when two interacting sites are responsible for the disease, the cladistic
analysis greatly improves the probability to find the two susceptibility sites. The impact of the
linkage disequilibrium and of the tree characteristics on the efficiency of the cladistic analysis are
also discussed. An application on a real data set concerning the CARD15 gene and Crohn disease
shows that the method can successfully identify the three variant sites that are involved in the
disease susceptibility.
Conclusion: The use of phylogenies to group haplotypes is especially interesting to pinpoint the
sites that are likely to be involved in disease susceptibility among the different markers identified
within a gene.

Background
With the development of molecular techniques to identify
genetic polymorphisms, numerous markers and in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) [1,2] are

now available within and between genes for establishing
their possible role in disease susceptibility. One recurrent
question in the literature is the way these markers could
be used to test for association with complex diseases [3,4].

Should one focus on one marker at a time and simply
compare allele or genotype distributions for the studied
markers in cases and controls or should one consider haplotypes formed by several linked markers? Haplotypic
methods have been suggested to be more powerful at
detecting the role of a given genomic region in disease susceptibility [4-7]. Indeed, disease susceptibility may be due
to the combined effects of variants at different markers.
Different methods have been proposed to test for association between markers located on the same reconstructed
haplotypes and disease susceptibility [4,7-10]. In these
tests, the number of haplotypes being large, the degrees of
freedom to compare cases and controls are also large,
decreasing the power to detect the association. Moreover,
as some haplotypes would only be carried by one or two
individuals, there could be statistical problems owing to
small sample sizes making difficult the evaluation of their
possible effect on the susceptibility to the disease.
A solution to reduce these problems is to group haplotypes in order to decrease the degrees of freedom and to
increase the number of individuals in the different haplotype groups. The cladistic method as described by Templeton et al. [11] is a method to carry out such groupings of
haplotypes and to determine which haplotype or group of
haplotypes is likely to be responsible for the phenotypic
variation observed among the population. It consists in
using parsimony methods to build a phylogeny of the
haplotypes, and to group haplotypes according to the
clades defined by the phylogenetic tree. When applied to
a case/control data set, the proportions of cases and controls in different clades are compared. If a clade shows a
significantly larger number of cases than the others, one
will conclude, first, that there is an association between
the disease and one haplotype or a group of haplotypes
belonging to the clade, and, second, that the mutations
defining the clade containing an excess of cases are good
candidates to be functional gene polymorphisms
involved in the disease susceptibility.
The cladistic analysis relies for a large part on the reconstruction of an accurate phylogenetic tree, but recombination is known to bias phylogenetic reconstruction
processes [12]. The recent discovery of the haplotype
block structure of the human genome [13] now provides
an interesting framework for cladistic methods. Indeed,
haplotype blocks define regions in which the recombination rate is quite low. Moreover, once a block is found to
be associated with a disease, it will not be suitable to use
classical methods based on recombination to fine map
susceptibility loci. Haplotype phylogenies being based on
the history of mutations may then help to identify disease
susceptibility loci.

The cladistic method was first described in a series of five
articles [11,14-17] and applied in different case-control
studies focusing either on quantitative or qualitative data.
For example, Haviland et al. used a cladistic analysis to
study the association between the apolipoprotein AI-CIIIAIV and plasma lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels [18]. Keavney et al. [19] used cladograms to localize
the sites that significantly influence Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme (ACE). Zhu et al. [20] worked on quantitative data simulated for the twelfth Genetic Analysis
Workshop (GAW). Using regression analysis and analysis
of variance (ANOVA), they were able to find a short
region containing the simulated mutation. Wang et al.
[21] used a nested linear model to analyze the association
between ApoA4 haplotypes and plasma lipid level in the
cladistic framework. Among the studies that consider discrete data is the one by Kittles et al. [22] who tested the
association between haplotype variations on the Y chromosome and alcohol dependence and related personality
traits. Lobos and Todd applied the same cladistic method
to four RFLPs in the tyroxine hydroxylase gene [23], and
to five SNPs in the dopamine receptor D2 gene [24]. Darlu
and Génin [25] applied the method to the GAW 12 simulated data and were able to identify some of the disease
susceptibility sites. For a more detailed review on the subject, see [26].
More recently Seltman et al. [27] developed a method that
can be applied on family-based data. They proposed a test,
the ET-TDT, that combines the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and the use of unrooted phylogenetic
trees to group haplotypes. They further extended their
method to the analysis of qualitative and quantitative
data from case-parent trios or population-based studies
[28]. Finally, an alternative method where phylogenetic
trees are reconstructed by a distance method was proposed by Durrant et al. [29] and implemented in the software CLADHC.
From these different examples, cladistic methods appear
to be innovative methods to detect an association
between a candidate gene and a disease and to localize
disease susceptibility sites. However, the validity and the
power of these methods to detect association have only
been tested in a very limited number of situations (fixed
pattern of linkage disequilibrium, fixed phylogenetic tree)
[27,29]. In this paper, we develop a new cladistic test
(CT), based on the analysis of a rooted tree, which allows
to make hypotheses about functional polymorphisms
that are involved in the susceptibility to the disease.
Through simulations on ten different tree topologies, we
evaluate the conditions in which this cladistic method is
efficient and compare it to other methods. Finally, we
apply this method to a real data set concerning Crohn disease and the CARD15 gene [30].

Results
Association test
As detailed in the method section, four different tests are
performed: a single locus allele-based test referred to as
SbST (Site by Site Test), an haplotype-based test referred
to as HT (Haplotypic Test), a test based on haplotype phylogenies referred to as CT (Cladistic Test) and a test based
on the clustering of haplotypes described by Durrant et al.
[29] and referred to as CLADHC. To compare their respective power to detect an association, simulations were performed under three disease models involving one (model

1) or two (model 2 and model 3) susceptibility sites for
ten different tree topologies.
Results for model 1 are presented in Table 1 and 2. When
the susceptibility site is included in the studied SNPs
(Table 1), SbST is the most powerful test for all trees but
one (tree 8) (between 99.1% and 99.5% depending on
the tree, 99.35% on average), while the other tests have a
weaker power (92.9%, 93.7%, and 91.2%, on average, for
CT, HT, and CLADHC respectively). CT and CLADHC
have almost the same average type I error, slightly but

significantly lower than the type I error of HT and SbST. In
these simulations, as the type I errors cannot be fixed a priori, powers may be difficult to compare. However, if the
type I errors of CT and CLADHC were increased, their
power would also be increased and, consequently, the difference in power with HT would be even more pronounced and the difference in power with SbST would be
more reduced. In the trees showing comparable type one
error (Trees 1, 5, 7), the power of SbST is clearly higher
than the power of CT. When the susceptibility site is
removed (Table 2), the performances of the four tests are,
on average, similar (about 89%), CT being the most powerful test for four trees, SbST for four other trees, HT and
CLADHC for one tree each. However, the type I errors
being slightly different, by adjusting them one expects
that CT and CLADHC could be on average, slightly more
powerful than HT and SbST.
As expected, the power is higher when the susceptibility
site is included than when it is removed. In this latter case,
the power depends on the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the susceptibility site and the other
sites as expressed by the maximum value of LD, referred to
as LDmax. Moreover, since the pattern of LD can be different from one tree to another, one expects more differences
in power between trees when the susceptibility site is
removed. Indeed the standard deviation of the power is
larger in this case. This standard deviation is also particularly large for SbST (σ = 9.81). This test, being an allelebased test, is more influenced by LD than the three others
tests that are haplotype-based tests, as proved by the high

positive correlation observed between the power of SbST
to detect association and the LDmax (Spearman rank correlation ρ equals 0.851, p-value < 0.01). For CT and
CLADHC, Spearman rank correlations are not significant
(p > 0.1) confirming that LD has a lesser impact on these
two tests. Therefore, the high standard deviations
observed for these two tests are probably more related to
the phylogeny of haplotypes than to the linkage
disequilibrium.
The results for model 2 and model 3, differing by the values of the penetrance vector, are presented in Table 3 and
in Table 4 respectively. There is no real difference in power
between the four tests for model 2 (about 97%). For
model 3, the power of the four tests is approximately half
the power for model 2 owing to the reduced value of the
penetrance for the genotype associated to the highest risk
in this model. In this case, SbST and CT are, on average,
the most and the less powerful test respectively
Localization of the susceptibility site(s)
The efficiency of SbST, CT and CLADHC to localize the
susceptibility site(s) when it is included among the SNPs
is presented in Figure 1 and 2. The efficiency of CT is plotted against the efficiency of SbST or CLADHC. To correctly
interpret these figures, it has to be noted that the criteria
used to compare the methods are not strictly identical.
Indeed, the identified SNP is always unambiguously
detected by the SbST method, since this is the site giving
the most significant chi-square and two chi-squares are
never exactly identical. On the other hand, the

susceptibility site may not be the only one detected by CT
because two or more sites could have the same values of
the criteria (Vi, see the Methods section). However, in our
simulations, the susceptibility site is the only one detected
in from 80% (for 1 tree) to 100% (for 5 trees) of the replicates. When the susceptibility site is not found alone, it
is almost always found with only one other site, rarely
with two other sites (<0.5% of the replicates).

For model 1 (Figure 1), CT is slightly less efficient than
SbST (for 9 trees out of 10) and more efficient than
CLADHC (for all 10 trees). For SbST, we note a high negative correlation between the efficiency to localize the
susceptibility site and the LDmax between the susceptibility
site and the other sites (Spearman rank correlation ρ equal
-0.88 with a p-value of 0.008). It shows that the presence
of a site in relatively high LD with the susceptibility site
disturbs the localization process, increasing the uncertainty of the susceptibility site's identification. Interestingly, there is no such statistically significant correlation
with CT and CLADHC (p > 0.08), due to the fact that these
last two tests use both the information on the whole haplotypes and on their history through the tree reconstruction. The presence of sites in high LD with the
susceptibility site does not prevent these two methods
from localizing correctly the susceptibility site.
For model 2 and model 3, (Figure 2A and 2B respectively),
CT is more or at least as efficient as SbST to localize the
two sites, whatever the penetrance model. For the detection of at least one of the two sites, we can observe that,

whatever the tree, CT is always more efficient than SbST
under model 2, whereas this is only true for 6 out of the

Application to CARD15/NOD2 polymorphisms and Crohn
disease
The reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree of the 33 haplotypes leads to a very high number of equally
parsimonious trees. One thousand of them were retained
and analyzed. In table 5, for the two rooting methods
mfH and consH, the SNPs are ranked from the least to the
most significant (based on the Vi parameter, see the Methods section). Association is detected with CT (pmfH = 2 ×
10-5, pconsH = 3 × 10-5) and SNP 8 is selected as potential
susceptibility site. If haplotypes carrying the susceptibility
allele at SNP 8 are removed, an association can still be
detected (pmfH = 4 × 10-5, pconsH = 3 × 10-5) and SNP 12 is
identified as potential susceptibility site. When removing
haplotypes with the susceptibility allele at SNP 12, there
is still a remaining association (pmfH = 8 × 10-5, pconsH = 3 ×
10-5) and depending on the rooting method either SNP 13
(with consH) or SNP 9 (with mfH) are retained. When
haplotypes with the susceptibility allele at SNP 13 are
removed, the association test is not significant (pmfH = 2.9
× 10-1, pconsH = 1.1 × 10-1). When haplotypes with the sus-

ceptibility allele at SNP 9 are removed, the association test
is significant (pmfH = 2 × 10-5, pconsH = 5 × 10-5) and the
identified site is SNP 13 for both rooting method. In the
end, the combination of SNP 8, SNP 12 and SNP 13 is the
most parsimonious combination that can explain the susceptibility to the disease. Moreover, we can note that these
3 SNPs are those showing the highest Vi on the whole data
set. So, we finally have identified three SNPs involved in
the susceptibility to Crohn's disease.

Discussion
In this paper, we have presented a method to perform
phylogeny-based nested haplotype analysis of case/control data and introduced the cladistic test (CT). We have
shown by simulations that the CT test is approximately as
powerful to detect an association as a test that compares
haplotype distributions in cases and controls with no
prior grouping. However, a major advantage of CT
towards other haplotypic tests is the possibility of making
inferences on potential susceptibility sites. Indeed the
method of parsimony used to build the phylogeny allows
the reconstruction of character state changes on the tree
and thus the identification of the most likely susceptibility
sites. Finding the polymorphisms responsible for the susceptibility to a disease is an important issue in genetic

epidemiology and in the past few years, different methods
have been proposed that use linkage disequilibrium to
fine-map candidate genes and to localize disease mutations ([31,32] and [33] for example) These methods are
based on the fact that a disease variant arises on a particular haplotype, the haplotype and the disease thus being
initially associated. Then, over time, this association is
broken by recombination and only a small region of the
ancestral haplotype is preserved around the disease
variant. In such models, recombination is the event of
interest. Other parameters such as mutations can be integrated in the models, but they are considered as nuisance
parameters. The cladistic test developed here is different in
the sense that it is based on the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the mutations that occur to form the
haplotypes. Contrary to the other fine-mapping methods,
the event of interest is mutation, and recombination is a
nuisance parameter. Through the simulation study, we
have shown that this test is a powerful tool to suggest etiological SNPs. This is also illustrated here on Crohn disease since the cladistic test was able to correctly identify
the 3 sites within the CARD15 gene that are already
reported to be involved in the disease susceptibility [30].
The cladistic test requires the building of a phylogeny of
the different haplotypes present in the sample. Different
methods are available to build haplotype phylogenies:
distance methods, parsimony methods and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods. A parsimony method was chosen here because it allows the reconstruction of apomorphies that can be used to define potential sites involved in
the disease susceptibility and because it runs faster than
ML methods, thus allowing a simulation study. We have
compared CT with another clustering method, CLADHC,
a distance-based method that also differs from CT in the
statistical analysis (CLADHC performs regression analysis, CT is based on chi-square tests). We have shown that
the power of these two tests to detect association is quite
similar, CT being slightly more powerful when one site is
simulated, and CLADHC when two sites are simulated.
For the localization of the susceptibility site, the efficiency
of the two methods is difficult to compare because CT
directly localizes the site on short sequences while
CLADHC localizes a window containing the susceptibility

site on longer sequences. The two test should thus be used
in different situations. Nevertheless CT appears to be
more efficient in our simulation conditions
In the phylogeny reconstruction, one is faced to different
problems. The first one is the choice of the ancestral
sequence to root the phylogeny. With real data, the ancestral sequence is usually not known, unless at least two outgroups can be postulated (in the parsimony context). In
the absence of ancestral sequences, hypotheses have to be
made, and they are numerous, like taking the most frequent haplotype, but this haplotype could be different
from one population to an other or from one sampling to
another, and this most frequent haplotype may not have
a significantly different frequency from the next most frequents. Or one can take the consensus haplotype, but this
sequence may not be observed in the sample, or not be
among the most frequent sequences. In this study, our
strategy was to consider the uncertainty of the ancestral
sequence as a nuisance parameter, since our goal was not
primarily to focus on this problem and because we must
be in the same situation for all the performed simulations.
Extensive further simulations will be needed to assess the
properties of the different rooting methods. However, several ancestral hypotheses should be considered, discussed,
and tested on real data, as we have done for the Crohn
data. Second, the presence of recombinations would
restrict the use of phylogenetic reconstruction. Indeed,
phylogenetic reconstruction is known to be biased by
recombinations [12] in a manner depending on how and
when the recombination events occur in the tree. This
context led us to simulate the history of mutations along
the haplotypes without introducing recombinations
between haplotypes. However, because in our method the
reconstructed tree has not to represent the exact history of
the haplotypes, but only gives a way to cluster them in an
appropriate way, we believe that our method can tolerate
some low degrees of recombination, as it is probably the
case for the Crohn data. Further simulations would however be required to better assess this point. Third, the
choice of the way characters are optimized on the tree is
another important point in cladistic analysis. Two classical options can be used to optimize the character state
changes along the tree: deltran, (delayed transformation)

Page 7 of 13

BMC Genetics 2005, 6:24

that favors convergences or acctran(accelerated transformation) that favors reversions. In this paper, only the
results performed with the deltran option are presented.
Simulations (one susceptibility site) have also been performed with the acctran option. For the association detection, the results are very similar to those obtained with
deltran showing that this parameter does not influence
the power of the CT method to detect association in our
simulation conditions. For the localization of the susceptibility site, the results are different. The method is more
efficient with the deltran option than with the acctran
option for eight trees out of ten, it is less efficient for one
tree and the results are equivalent for the last tree. It is
partly due to to the uncertainties of the character S and to
the frequency of the disease susceptibility allele. When the
frequency of the susceptibility allele is low, as in our simulations, and when S is coded "?" in some nodes of the
tree, one expects the change of S from 0 to 1 to occur later
in the tree, and the delayed option (deltran) will then be
more appropriate. Conversely, when the frequency of the
disease is large, the change of S from 0 to 1 has more
chances to occur earlier in the tree since the S mutation
can then include more cases, and the accelerated option
(acctran) will be more appropriate. However, when analyzing a real data set, it is advisable to compare the results
obtained with both options.
The variability of the results obtained with the cladistic
method is due for a minor part to the LD between the susceptibility site(s) and the other sites and for the major part
to parameters specific to the tree. Among these parameters, the position of the mutation in the tree (near the root
or the leaves, sample size of the clades near the mutations...) has already been reported to have an influence on
the power of cladistic methods to detect association [27].
Apart from the position of the mutation, the presence of
sites that co-mutate with the susceptibility site, the degree
of multiple mutations of the susceptibility site in the tree,
and the existence of one or more reversions for the susceptibility site influence the power of the cladistic test to
detect an association, and they have an even greater
impact on the efficiency of the cladistic test to localize the
susceptibility site. As all these factors are not independent,
the evaluation of their own effects remains problematic.
The four methods compared here (CT, HT, SbST and
CLADHC) suppose that haplotypic data are available,
which is not usually the case. The most likely haplotypes
for an individual have to be reconstructed using numerical methods (for a review of these methods, see [34,35]).
The availability of familial data may help to determine the
phase of the markers and then, to obtain the most likely
haplotypes by using the genetic information of the two
parents. However, even when these familial data are not
available, the numerical methods have been shown to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/24

very efficient to reconstruct haplotypes, except for rare
haplotypes that may either be missed or falsely created. In
this work, since we choose to focus on the comparison
between several methods, the problem of haplotype inference is ignored. Moreover, as the four studied methods are
all based on already known or inferred haplotypes carried
by the individuals, the uncertainty due to the haplotype
inference should not play differently from one method to
another. Further extension of the CT method will take this
uncertainty into account by using, for example, likelihood-based tests.

Conclusion
In conclusion, as proved by our simulations and the
Crohn example, the use of phylogenies to group haplotypes by clades and the nested analysis of case-control
data on the basis of these clades turns out to be an interesting and complementary strategy for the genetic study of
multifactorial diseases, especially to pinpoint the sites
that are likely to be involved in disease susceptibility
among the different markers identified within a gene.

Methods
Principle of the method
The material on which the method is based is a sample of
haplotypes composed of a combination of SNPs, each
haplotype being labeled either as control or as affected
depending on the phenotype of the individual. After
building the phylogenetic tree of these different haplotypes, a series of nested homogeneity tests are performed
to detect differences in the distribution of cases and controls in the different clades. Once an association is
detected, a new character is defined according to the proportion of cases carrying an haplotype. Then, it is optimized on the tree and the sites that significantly co-mutate
with this new character are putative susceptibility sites for
the disease.
Simulation study
To test the power of this method to detect an association
and its efficiency to precisely localize the susceptibility
site, we performed the following steps : i) simulation of
the haplotypes and choice of the susceptibility site(s) (one
or two susceptibility sites are considered) ; ii) attribution
of a status (case or control) to these haplotypes taking into
account the genetic model of the disease; iii) reconstruction of the phylogeny of haplotypes and inference of the
character state changes along the branches of the tree; iv)
association test: nested analysis of the case/control ratio in
the clades; v) localization of the susceptibility site using
the equiparsimonious (ie, all the trees that have the minimum number of character state changes) ; vi) estimation,
by simulations, of the power to detect the association
between haplotypes and the disease and comparison with

BMC Genetics 2005, 6:24

other methods; vii) estimation of the efficiency to localize
susceptibility sites and comparison with other methods.
Haplotype simulation
24 different haplotypes are simulated using the TREEVOLVE software (version 1.32) [36]. An ancestral haplotype sequence of 20 sites is randomly produced, a guide
tree is generated using the coalescent model without
recombination and the evolution of this ancestral
sequence along the tree is simulated to obtain a sample of
24 different haplotypes. Since TREEVOLVE can only simulate the evolution of DNA sequences (4 nucleotides) and
not the evolution of bi-allelic markers, we set the
frequencies for bases A and T to very low values (A = T =
0.001 and G = C = 0.498) in order to obtain an ancestral
sequence composed only of G and C, as an equivalent of
SNPs coded by 0/1 character states. The mutation rate is
set to 2 × 10-6, and the substitution rates are chosen so that
only G-C transversions could occur: A - C = 0.001, A - G =
0.001, A - T = 0.001, C - T = 0.001, G - T = 0.001, G - C =
0.995. No heterogeneity in the substitution rate among
sites is specified. The population size was set to 100,000
and its growth was stationary with no subdivision. Once
the haplotypes are obtained by simulation, the susceptibility sites are chosen among the 20 sites. For the simulations with only one susceptibility site, the program picks
up the first site in the sequence having a minor allele frequency (p) in the sample of haplotypes within the range F
<p <F + 0.01 where F is a predefined allele frequency (in
our simulations, F = 0.20). For two simulated sites, the
program picks up the first two simulated sites verifying a
user-defined constraint. In our simulations, the two sites
are chosen such that f (A1B1) = f (A1B2) = f (A2B1) = f
(A2B2) = 0.25, A1 and A2 being the two alleles at the first
site and B1 and B2, the two alleles at the second site. When
no site is found satisfying these conditions, a new set of
haplotypes is simulated until the required conditions are
obtained.

This entire procedure is repeated ten times to generate ten
different data sets. The pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2
measure, mean values for the 1000 replicates) and the tree
topologies corresponding to these ten data sets are provided as Additional file 1 and 2.
Attribution of disease status
To generate the genotypes of each individual, pairs of haplotypes are sampled at random with replacement and the
disease status (case or control) is determined by his genotype at the susceptibility site(s) and by the penetrances. In
our simulations, three disease models are studied, involving either one susceptibility site (model 1) or two interacting susceptibility sites (model 2 and model 3). The first
model is the disease model described in Bourgain et al.
[37] that roughly corresponds to the effect of ApoE4 in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/24

Alzheimer's disease [38]. We set the penetrance of the
three genotypes DD, Dd and dd to respectively PDD = 0.03,
PDd = 0.06, Pdd = 0.30, d being the disease susceptibility
allele. For model 2 and model 3, an at-risk haplotype
formed by the combination of the alleles A2 at the first
locus and B2 at the second locus is defined. The penetrance associated to the genotype A2B2A2B2 is set to 0.9 for
model 2 and to 0.6 for model 3. All the other penetrances
are set to 0.3 for both models.
The sampling process is carried on until N cases and N
controls are obtained (N = 100 or 200 in our simulations,
depending on the number of simulated susceptibility
sites). This constitutes a replicate. As the haplotypes are
sampled randomly from the set of 24 different haplotype,
they are almost equi-frequent in the sample of cases and
controls, and their frequencies are close to

1
= 0.042 .

Phylogeny of haplotypes
All the different haplotypes are used to build a phylogenetic tree by a parsimony method which consists in
choosing the tree that minimizes the number of mutation
events [39]. The PAUP software (version 4.0b10 [40]) is
used to reconstruct the tree. A heuristic search is performed, using stepwise addition and TBR (tree bisection
and reconnection). All sites are equally weighted, and
changes from allele 0 to allele 1 and from allele 1 to allele
0 are equally allowed for all sites, including the susceptibility site (unordered option). Among the list of all parsimonious trees, only the first one obtained is used for the
association test, for computation time reasons and
because we found that identical results are obtained for
more than 98% of the equiparsimonious trees (data not
shown). For the localization of susceptibility sites, all the
equiparsimonious trees (or up to 100 different trees if
there are too many equiparsimonious trees) are analyzed.
The trees are rooted using the real ancestor obtained with
TREEVOLVE. The character states are inferred along the
branches by using the classical option deltran (delayed
transformation), but acctran (accelerated transformation)
was also investigated.
Association test
Starting from the root of the tree, series of nested homogeneity tests comparing the number of cases and controls
in different clades are performed. The principle of the
method is explained in Figure 3. Briefly, at each level of
the tree, homogeneity in the distribution of cases and controls is tested among all the n clades defined at this level.
If the test is significant, an association is detected and the
analysis ends. If the test is not significant, one homogeneity test is performed between all the sub-clades descending from the n clades.

Localization of the susceptibility sites
For each replicate, several equiparsimonious trees may
exist. We will analyze the T first equiparsimonious given

reasons. For a tree t, a new character S is allocated to each
haplotype h. The state of S is "0", "1" or "?" depending on
the proportion (ph) of cases carrying the haplotype h compared to the proportion p0 of cases in the whole sample.

Estimation of power and efficiency
For each of the ten samples of 24 haplotypes simulated
along the ten different tree topologies, the process
detailed above (attribution of disease status, phylogenetic
reconstruction, association test and localization of the
susceptibility site) is repeated 1000 times to obtain 1000
replicates, each of them including N cases and N controls.
The power to detect the association is measured by counting the proportion of replicates in which a significant heterogeneity in the distribution of cases and controls is
detected between clades. The efficiency of CT to localize
the true susceptibility site is simply evaluated as the
number of times, among the 1000 simulations, the true
susceptibility site is among the detected sites. When two
susceptibility sites are simulated, we evaluate the number
of times the two sites are detected and the number of
times at least one of the two sites is detected.

The test using the cladistic method (CT) is compared to
three other association tests: i) a haplotypic test (HT) that
compares the haplotype distributions in cases and con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/24

trols: if h different types of haplotypes are observed, a chisquare test with h - 1 degree of freedom (df) is performed.
As with the CT test, when sample sizes are small, a permutation procedure is used to perform the chi-square test.
This HT test is only used to test for association and not to
localize the susceptibility sites. ii) An allelic test, referred
to as Site by Site Test (SbST), that compares the allele distributions in cases and controls at each site by a chisquare: if the number of sites is s, then s chi-squares, each
with one df, are performed. The site or the two sites that
give the most significant results are proposed as susceptibility sites. iii) A test based on CLADHC, the program
developed by Durrant et al. [29]. In this test, the data set
is analyzed by overlapping windows sliding along the
haplotypes. In each window, a tree is reconstructed using
a distance method, and a regression analysis is performed
at each level of the tree (nested analysis). The level of the
tree that maximizes the evidence of disease marker association in the likelihood-ratio test is selected. For each window, the program also provides a significant threshold
calculated using the Bonferroni correction. In our simulations, a window size of 6 is selected. We consider the association as detected when at least one of the windows is
significant. Concerning the localization of the susceptibility site, CLADHC can only find a window containing the
susceptibility site, but not the susceptibility site itself.
Therefore, we only use CLADHC in the case of one susceptibility site and we consider the localization as correct
when the window with the maximum value of the statistic
contains the susceptibility site.
For CT, SbST and CLADHC, we are confronted to a problem of multiple testing. When a real data set is analyzed,
a permutation procedure can be used to estimate p-values
of the association tests that are corrected for multiple testing. This procedure is very time-consuming and cannot be
used on the simulations we have performed here. As an
example, the 100,000 repetitions for the Crohn data run
in about 24 hours on a Pentium III, 930 MHz, 512 Mo of
RAM. Therefore, for SbST and CT, we estimate the nominal type I error required to obtain a global type-one error
of 5% by a simulation under the null hypothesis of no
association between the studied sites and the disease
(5000 replicates). We found that for the different simulation conditions studied here, these nominal errors are
equal to 1% for CT and varies from 0.2 to 0.4% for SbST.
For the analysis with CLADHC, the program provides a
significant threshold calculated using Bonferroni
correction. As the Bonferroni correction is very conservative, to obtain similar type I errors with CLADHC as with
CT, nominal type I errors were set to values varying from
15 to 17% for simulations with one susceptibility site and
from 20 to 25% for simulations with two susceptibility
sites.

Analysis of real data on Crohn disease
The data set is described in a paper of Hugot et al. (2001)
[30] and includes 232 nuclear families with two affected
children and their parents genotyped for 13 SNPs in the
CARD15/NOD2 gene. Haplotypes were reconstructed in
these families using GENEHUNTER 2.0b[41]. In each
family, one affected child is selected at random to create
the case sample (his two haplotypes are labeled cases).
The control sample is formed with the parental haplotypes non transmitted to the selected children. The phylogenetic reconstruction assumes that no recombination
has occurred between the SNPs. To determine if this was
true for the different SNPs tested here or at least for a subset of them, linkage disequilibrium (LD) is estimated
between all the SNPs. From the pairwise LD, a group of 7
SNPs (5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 9 and 13) can be identified as forming
a block in strong LD among which no or very few
recombinations are likely to have occurred (see Additional file 3). Interestingly, this same block of 7 SNPs was
described by Vermeire et al. [42] in the CARD15/NOD2
gene. Only these 7 SNPs that form 33 different haplotypes
are used in the cladistic analysis. The phylogenetic trees
are reconstructed using the same parameters as in the
simulations. However here, contrary to the simulations,
the ancestral sequence being not known, two different
analysis are performed using as ancestral sequence either
the most frequently observed haplotype in our sample
(mfH) or a consensus sequence formed by the combination of the most frequent alleles at each SNP (consH). For
the association test, p-values are estimated on the first
equiparsimonious tree obtained by PAUP, using an algorithm similar to the one described in a paper of Becker and
Knapp (2004) [43]. This permutation process corrects for
multiple testing in a lesser conservative way than the Bonferroni correction because it takes into account the
dependency between the tests. For the localization,
among all the equiparsimonious trees, 1000 of them are
retained and analyzed with CT.
