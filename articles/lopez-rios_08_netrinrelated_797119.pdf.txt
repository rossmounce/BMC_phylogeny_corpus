Abstract
Background: Secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) are multifunctional modulators of Wnt
and BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signalling necessary for the development of most organs
and the homeostasis of different adult tissues. SFRPs fold in two independent domains: the cysteine
rich domain (SfrpCRD) related to the extracellular portion of Frizzled (Fz, Wnt receptors) and the
Netrin module (SfrpNTR) defined by homologies with molecules such as Netrin-1, inhibitors of
metalloproteinases and complement proteins. Due to its structural relationship with Fz, it is
believed that SfrpCRD interferes with Wnt signalling by binding and sequestering the ligand. In
contrast, the functional relevance of the SfrpNTR has been barely addressed.
Results: Here, we combine biochemical studies, mutational analysis and functional assays in cell
culture and medaka-fish embryos to show that the Sfrp1NTR mimics the function of the entire
molecule, binds to Wnt8 and antagonizes Wnt canonical signalling. This activity requires intact
tertiary structure and is shared by the distantly related Netrin-1NTR. In contrast, the Sfrp1CRD
cannot mirror the function of the entire molecule in vivo but interacts with Fz receptors and
antagonizes Wnt8-mediated β-catenin transcriptional activity.
Conclusion: On the basis of these results, we propose that SFRP modulation of Wnt signalling
may involve multiple and differential interactions among Wnt, Fz and SFRPs.

Background
Secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) compose a family of soluble factors widely involved in the control of
embryonic development and the homeostasis of adult tissues. Members of this family were independently isolated
using a variety of approaches and immediately proposed
as Wnt signalling inhibitors because of their ability to
interfere with Wnt-induced embryonic axis duplication

and forebrain development in Xenopus [1,2]. Many studies
have thereafter confirmed that addition of SFRPs can
block Wnt-mediated signalling activation in different
experimental paradigms showing possible binding preferences between SFRP and Wnt pairs (reviewed in [3]).
Whether SFRP-mediated interference with Wnt signalling
activation is the result of a single biochemical interaction
between Wnt and SFRPs or instead reflects multiple bindPage 1 of 19

ing mechanisms among SFRP, Wnt and their Frizzled (Fz)
receptors is, however, a still unresolved issue.
Indeed, SFRP molecules fold in two independent
domains: an amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD)
and a carboxy-terminal Netrin-related motif (NTR) [4,5].
The SfrpCRD contains ten cysteines with a pattern of five
disulfide bridges identical to that of the extracellular CRD
of Fz [6,7]. Due to this structural relationship, it is generally assumed that Sfrp-mediated Wnt signalling inhibition results from the interaction between the ligand and
SfrpCRD, which has been actually shown to immunoprecipitate with Wnt1 and Wnt2 [8,9]. However, SfrpCRD can
also form homo- and heterodimers with the CRD domain
of Fz receptors [8,10], suggesting potential alternative
mechanisms of action.
The carboxy-terminal SfrpNTR is separated from the SfrpCRD by a linker region and is characterized by the presence of several conserved blocks of hydrophobic residues
and a pattern of six conserved cysteines. NTR domains
with similar features are found in a wide range of otherwise unrelated proteins, including Netrin-1, tissue inhibitors of metallo-proteinases (TIMPs), complement
proteins and type I procollagen C-proteinase enhancer
proteins (PCOLCEs) [11]. Despite an initial suggestion
that the SfrpNTR may interact with Wnt ligands [4], the participation of this domain in SFRP function has not been
addressed.
Here, we have combined biochemical studies, mutational
analysis and functional assays in cell culture and medakafish embryos to test the functional relevance of the SfrpNTR
in Wnt signalling modulation. We show that the Sfrp1NTR
mimics the function of the full-length Sfrp1, binds to Wnt
ligands and prevents Wnt canonical signalling activation,
effects shared by distantly related NTR domains such as
that of Netrin-1. In contrast, Sfrp1CRD fails to interact with
Wnt but binds to Fz receptors, possibly explaining the
potential that the CRD has to inhibit Wnt signalling. We
thus conclude that SFRPs modulate Wnt signalling by
interacting with both Wnt ligands and Fz receptors but
through different domains of the molecule and propose
possible models of SFRP function that may reconcile data
available in the literature.

Results
Sfrp1NTR mimics the effect of the full-length protein in the
anterior neural plate
Sfrp1 is expressed in the anterior neural plate and is
required to establish the prospective eye territory [12,13].
In line with this idea, Sfrp1 (Figure 1) over-expression in
the medaka fish leads to a morphologically evident
enlargement of the forebrain, posterior truncations and
axial duplications (Figure 2b; Table 1). These defects cor-

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/19

relate with the expansion of the expression domains of
telencephalic, optic vesicle and diencephalic markers such
as fgf8, rx3 and pax6 (Figure 2f,J,n), the alteration of the
axial mesoderm marker foxa2 (Figure 2j) and the loss of
the posterior domain of pax6 (arrow in Figure 2n). To
determine whether the NTR domain of Sfrp1 contributed
to this effect, we generated expression constructs encoding
truncated (Sfrp1CRD) or chimerical peptides (Sfrp1NTR;
harbouring its own signal peptide to ensure proper secretion; Figure 1) that comprised the two independent
domains in which the protein has been shown to fold [5].
Notably, injections of equimolar concentrations of
Sfrp1NTR mRNA led to the enlargement of the forebrain
and the expansion of anterior markers (Table 1; Figure
2d,h,l,p), as observed after the over-expression of fulllength Sfrp1. Although all peptides seemed to be produced at comparable levels (Figure 3; see below), higher
concentrations of Sfrp1NTR mRNA were necessary to
induce posterior truncations or axial duplications (data
not shown), suggesting a differential requirement of
Sfrp1NTR along the antero-posterior axis. Alternatively, the
peptide was less effective than the entire Sfrp1 protein,
perhaps due to a difference in maturation and half-life or
diffusion range. Another possible explanation is that
monomeric Sfrp1NTR is less effective than the full-length
protein, since protein dimerization through the CRD
motif has been previously described [8,10].
Quite surprisingly, over-expression of Sfrp1CRD, the
domain postulated to mediate SFRP-Wnt interactions, did
not result in comparable phenotypes (Table 1). Instead,
Sfrp1CRD mRNA injected embryos presented a small but
appreciable reduction of the forebrain (Figure 2c), which
was associated with a diminished expression of prosencephalic markers (Figure 2g,k,o). Forebrain reduction was
more evident at earlier stages of differentiation even with
lower doses of mRNA (data not shown), supporting that
the Sfrp1CRD gain-of-function phenotype did not reflect
lower levels of peptide expression. Accordingly, Western
blot analysis of embryos injected with haemagglutinin
(HA)-tagged versions of the peptides indicated that Sfrp1
and Sfrp1NTR mRNA were efficiently translated at comparable levels while the Sfrp1CRD mRNA was produced in a
larger amount, which existed in a monomeric and possibly a dimeric form (Figure 3).
Morpholino (Mo)-based knock-down of Sfrp1 expression
results in embryos with a reduced eye field associated, in
the most affected embryos, with a shortening and widening of the antero-posterior axis [13] (compare Figure 4b,b'
with Figure 4a,a'). Low concentrations of Sfrp1 mRNA are
sufficient to completely rescue this phenotype in a large
part of the embryos [13] (Figure 4c,c',f). If Sfrp1NTR can
mimic the effect of the entire molecule, it should also be
able to rescue the effects of Mo interference. Supporting

Embryos were collected at St26 and their lysates were precipitated with a polyclonal anti-HA and blotted with monoclonal anti-HA. To account for possible variations in the
amount of injected mRNA, the expression levels of Sfrp peptides were normalized against those of the co-injected EGFP
protein. Note that the normalised density values of the three
peptides (NDV) are very similar. Note also that SfrpCRD runs

this hypothesis, co-injection of Mo-Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR
mRNA rescued the size of the eye field of the treated
embryos with efficiency similar to that of Sfrp1 (Figure
4e,e',f). In contrast, Sfrp1CRD mRNA did not counteract the
Mo-Sfrp1 induced phenotype (Figure 4d,d',f) and even
appeared to exacerbate it, in line with the over-expression
studies.
Together, these data suggested that the molecular events
induced by the two domains of Sfrp1 were probably different in nature. The Sfrp1CRD-induced phenotype was difficult to explain according to the generally accepted view
that this domain binds Wnt ligands and antagonizes their
activity. In contrast, the strong anteriorisation observed
after Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR over-expression could be easily
explained as the result of an early and generalized antagonism of the canonical Wnt pathway, since inhibition of

To investigate this possibility, we next assayed whether
injection of Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR could alleviate the phenotypes caused by Wnt8-mediated activation of canonical
Wnt signalling. As previously shown in other species
[14,15], Wnt8 over-expression in medaka fish embryos
led to a strong reduction of the forebrain associated with
loss of the rx3-positive optic vesicles (Table 2; compare
Figure 5a,e with Figure 5b,f). These anterior defects were
similar to those observed after Sfrp1CRD injections (Figures
2c,k and 5c,g; Table 2) but opposite to those induced by
Sfrp1 or Sfrp1NTR over-expression (Figures 2b,d,j,l and
5d,h; Table 2). Upon co-injection, Wnt8 and Sfrp1 mRNAs
appeared to counteract each other's activity, resulting in
mildly anteriorised embryos (Figure 5i,l; Table 2) that,
however, still presented partial posterior truncations or
axis duplications (Figure 5i,l). This suggests that, in the
concentration range tested, Wnt8 cannot completely
counteract Sfrp1-induced axial defects. In agreement with
our previous observations, Sfrp1NTR mRNA abrogated the
Wn8-induced phenotype, restoring almost completely the
size of the rx3 expression domain (Figure 5k,n; Table 2;
compare to control embryos in Figure 5a,b). In contrast,
Sfrp1CRD, rather than counteracting, accentuated the
reduction of the forebrain induced by Wnt8 (Figure 5j,m).
Altogether, these results challenged the view that the CRD
domain of the Sfrp1 protein plays an important role in
Wnt antagonism. To exclude the possibility that inadequate folding or destabilization of the Sfrp1CRD construct
could mislead this interpretation, we designed an additional construct encoding the CRD and the entire linker
region (Sfrp1CRD2; Figure 1) to ensure proper folding of
the Sfrp1 CRD domain [5]. Over-expression of this new
construct, Sfrp1CRD2, caused phenotypes similar to those
observed upon Sfrp1CRD injection (Additional file 1). As
an alternative explanation, the behaviour of the Sfrp1CRD
could reflect a peculiarity of this specific member of the
SFRP family. Therefore, the CRD domain of Sfrp3
(Sfrp3CRD; Figure 1), the family member that diverges the
most from Sfrp1 [13], was also analyzed. Interestingly,
over-expression of Sfrp3CRD had no morphologically evident effects on embryonic development, even at high concentrations (Additional file 1; Table 1) and, in contrast to
Sfrp1CRD, failed to enhance Wnt8-induced phenotype
(Additional file 1; Table 2).
As a third possibility, we considered that our results could
reflect differential affinities between SFRPs and this particular Wnt ligand [16]. Therefore, co-injection studies were
repeated using two different Wnts: Wnt1, another canonical Wnt that, like Wnt8, can induce posteriorisation of
the embryos [17], and Wnt5, which is thought to activate

preferentially the non-canonical Wnt signalling pathway
[18]. As shown in Figure 6, injections of Sfrp1 and
Sfrp1NTR counteracted the phenotype caused by Wnt1induced phenotype with efficiencies that were very comparable to those observed with Wnt8, while Sfrp1CRD did
not. Wnt5 over-expression in fish and Xenopus embryos
leads to variable phenotypes [18,19], including defects in
axial extension and reduction of the optic vesicle size,
albeit less dramatic than those observed with Wnt8 (Additional file 1). Co-injection of Wnt5 with Sfrp1CRD or
Sfrp3CRD did not rescue the Wnt5-induced phenotype
(Additional file 1; Table 2), thus diminishing the relevance of the SfrpCRD as a Wnt ligand antagonist. In contrast, our results suggest a relevant role of Sfrp1NTR in
antagonizing Wnt activity.
Sfrp1NTR effects are shared by distantly related NTRs and
require intact tertiary structure
To explore this possibility further, we next investigated
whether the relevance of the NTR domain in antagonizing
Wnt ligands could be extended to other SFRP family
members or even to distantly related NTR domains [11].
According to phylogenetic analysis, the SFRP family is
composed of three subfamilies: Sfrp1/2/5, Tlc/Sizzled and
the very divergent Sfrp3/4 [13]. We thus compared the
activity of Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR with equivalent constructs
from Sfrp2 and Sfrp3 (Figure 1), close and a divergent
members of the SFRP family, respectively. Furthermore,
we also chose to analyze the NTR domain of Netrin-1 (Figure 1), a secreted protein involved in axon guidance where
the NTR domain was first identified [11,20] as a distantly

related module. When assayed for their ability to reproduce the Sfrp1 over-expression phenotype (Figures 2b and
7b), Sfrp2 and Sfrp2NTR displayed a significant anteriorising activity almost identical to that of Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR,
respectively (Figure 7c,f; Table 1), while Sfrp3 and
Sfrp3NTR had a much weaker activity and expansion of
anterior markers was only observed upon injection of
high mRNA concentrations (Figure 7d(inset),g; Table 1).
Intriguingly, Netrin-1NTR mRNA injections led to a mild
expansion of the forebrain at lower frequency than those
of Sfrp1NTR (Figure 7i; Table 1). These results indicate that,
despite the evolutionary distance, this module can mimic
SFRP function, presumably by binding to endogenous
Wnt.
We next asked whether the tertiary structure of Sfrp1NTR
was important for its function. The NTR motif is, in general, poorly conserved and mainly defined by the presence
of six conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide
bonds [5,11]. Mutations of the first two of these residues
(Cys177 and Cys180) are predicted to disrupt two
disulfide bonds, thus destabilizing the tertiary structure of
the NTR domain. Indeed, over-expression of such a
mutated construct (Sfrp1NTR-C177S;C180S; Figure 1) did not
alter medaka embryonic development (Figure 7h; Table
1), indicating that intact tertiary structure of the NTR
motif is required for Sfrp1 activity. Notably, analogous
mutations of the first two conserved cysteines of the
Netrin-1NTR (Netrin-1NTR-C471S;C475S; Figure 1) also interfered with, but surprisingly not totally abolished, the anteriorising activity of this domain (Figure 7j; Table 1).

Percentage of embryos showing a size reduction of the forebrain/optic vesicles upon injection of equimolecular amounts of mRNAs encoding Wnt8
or Wnt5 together with different variants of Sfrp1 and Sfrp3 mRNAs. Representative embryos are shown in Figure 2 and Additional file 2. Wnt8induced forebrain reduction is much more severe (optic vesicles are completely absent), than that observed upon wnt5 over-expression, where the
optic vesicles are, in general, significantly reduced in size but still visible. In the case of Wnt and Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR co-injections, the number shown
in brackets represents the frequency of appearance of the anteriorised phenotype (enlarged forebrain tissue), which is reduced compared to the
over-expression of the given Sfrp construct alone (Table 1).

Altogether, these data strongly support that the NTR
domain has a relevant role in mediating SFRP function
and that this role is conserved also in distantly related
domains.
Sfrp1NTR and Sfrp1CRD bind to Wnt8 and Frizzled,
respectively, antagonizing canonical signalling
In agreement with our finding that NTR domains of SFRPs
are functionally relevant to Wnt signalling modulation, in
vitro studies of the interaction between Sfrp1 and Wingless
have mapped the relevant SFRP binding site to the carboxyl terminus of the protein [4]. To assess whether a similar biochemical interaction between Wnt8 and Sfrp1NTR
could explain our over-expression experiments in medaka
fish embryos, we challenged Wnt8 interaction with the
two Sfrp1 domains.

To mimic the physiological conditions of the extracellular
interaction between Wnt and SFRPs, we collected conditioned media derived from HEK 293T cells separately
transfected with Wnt8-HA, Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1NTR-myc or
Sfrp1CRD-myc. The levels of proteins present in the conditioned media were carefully evaluated and equivalent
amounts of Wnt8 (Figure 8a(iii)) were incubated with
comparable quantities of either Sfrp1 or its derivatives
(Figure 8a(ii)) and used for co-immunoprecipitation
assays. Pull-downs with anti-HA IgG revealed that both
Sfrp1-myc and Sfrp1NTR-myc specifically interacted with
Wnt8-HA, while Sfrp1CRD-myc did not (Figure 8a(i)). Comparable levels of Sfrp1 and its derivatives were pulled
down with anti-myc monoclonal antibodies (Figure
8a(iv)), minimising the possibility that the lack of
Sfrp1CRD-Wnt interaction might be due to a less efficient
immunoprecipitation of the Sfrp1CRD. Reverse pull-

downs with a polyclonal anti-myc antiserum confirmed
these results (Additional file 2).
To further test the functionality of this interaction in β-catenin-mediated Wnt signalling and to compare it with that
of other NTR domains, we performed TCF-luciferase
reporter-based assays in embryonic retinal cells, where βcatenin-mediated transcriptional activity is physiologically low [12]. We thus transfected retina cells with Fz5, a
Wnt β-catenin associated receptor expressed in the anterior neural plate [21] to ensure Wnt8-mediated signalling
activation [22]. Fz5 alone or in combination with Sfrp1,
Sfrp1CRD or Sfrp1NTR did not modify basal β-catenin activity (Additional file 3). Instead, co-transfection or addition
of Sfrp1, Sfrp1NTR or Netrin-1NTR conditioned media
strongly inhibited reporter activity induced by Wnt8 and
Fz5 over-expression (Figure 8b; Additional file 3). Equivalent amounts of Sfrp3 or Sfrp3NTR were less effective (Figure 8b), in good agreement with what is observed in
medaka fish embryos (Figure 7). In apparent contrast with
immunoprecipitation experiments, co-transfection of
Sfrp1CRD also resulted in a significant decrease in reporter
activity (Figure 8b). Notably, co-transfection with Sizzled
or SizzledCRD, a SFRP family member that does not appear
to interfere with Wnt signalling [23], had a weaker activity
(Additional file 3).
Sfrp1 has been shown to form complexes with Fz6 [8] and
Fz2 [24], while crystallographic studies have shown that
Fz8CRD and Sfrp3CRD can form dimers [10]. It was possible,
therefore, that Sfrp1CRD-mediated inhibition of β-catenin
transcriptional activity could result from Sfrp1CRD binding
to the Fz5 receptor, thus preventing signal activation as
previously proposed [8]. To test this possibility, we per-

from HEK 293T cells transfected with Fz5-HA, Sfrp1-myc
or its derivatives or co-transfected with Fz2-HA, as a positive control [24], and Sfrp1-myc or its derivatives. As
shown in Figure 8c, both Sfrp1 and Sfrp1CRD, but not
Sfrp1NTR, interacted with Fz5-HA, supporting the possibility that Sfrp1CRD could impede Fz5 activation in TCF-luciferase reporter-based assays by competing with Wnt8 for
binding to the Fz receptor. A similar interaction was also
observed between Fz2-HA and Sfrp1CRD-myc as well as with
the entire protein (Additional file 2), confirming and
extending previous studies [24].

Discussion
Wnt signalling contributes to the regional specification of
the anterior neural plate. Acquisition of diencephalic, eye
and telecencephalic identities, however, require a differential contribution from canonical and non-canonical
Wnt pathways, which are regulated by different Wnt
antagonists, including Sfrp1 [25]. Accordingly, Mo-based
knock-down of Sfrp1, a Wnt antagonist broadly expressed
in the anterior neural plate, strongly reduces the eye field
size, concomitantly expanding the telencephalic but not
the diencephalic or mesencephalic territories in the
medaka fish [13]. Conversely, Sfrp1 over-expression leads

Distantly related NTR domains mimic the activity of Sfrp1NTR with different efficiencies. (a-j) Brightfield views of
embryos injected with different full-length or chimerical mRNAs as indicated. Insets in (c,d,f,g) correspond to embryos processed for double in situ hybridization for rx3 (red) and foxA2 (blue). Note that injections of Sfrp1 (b), Sfrp2 (c, and inset) lead to
similar expansion of anterior structures compared to control embryos (a), while Sfrp3 has a very weak anteriorizing effect (d)
observed only in 4% of the injected embryos (Table 1; inset in (d) shows an embryo injected with a high dose (500 ng/μl) of
Sfrp3 mRNA). Similarly, Sfrp3NTR induces a weak anteriorisation at a low frequency (embryo shown in (g); Table 1), whereas the
distantly related NTR motif from Netrin-1 (i) induces an expansion of the forebrain as observed with Sfrp1NTR. Note that the
functionality of the NTR domain depends on an intact tertiary structure, since cysteine to serine mutations in Sfrp1NTRC177S;C180S and Netrin-1NTR-C471S;C475S constructs (h,j) induce a total or partial loss of the effect. See Table 1. Scale bar: 0.1 mm.

Figure 8and Sfrp1CRD bind to Wnt8 and Frizzled-5, respectively, antagonizing canonical signalling
Sfrp1NTR (see previous page)
Sfrp1NTR and Sfrp1CRD bind to Wnt8 and Frizzled-5, respectively, antagonizing canonical signalling. (a) HEK
293T cells were transiently transfected with Wnt8-HA, Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1CRD-myc or Sfrp1NTR-myc expression constructs. Conditioned media containing similar amount of each of the Sfrp1-myc derivates (ii) were mixed with conditioned media from Wnt8HA (iii) or from mock transfected cells (Additional file 2). Proteins from mixed conditioned media were precipitated with a
polyclonal anti-HA and blotted with a monoclonal anti-myc (i). In these conditions, both Sfrp1-myc and Sfrp1NTR-myc (red asterisks) specifically co-immunoprecipitated with Wnt8-HA, while Sfrp1CRD-myc did not. Comparable levels of Sfrp1 and its derivatives were immunoprecipitated (iv). Note that Sfrp1NTR-myc migrates as a smear due to post-translational glycosylation.
Sfrp1CRD-myc likely suffers similar post-translational modifications and possibly forms dimers (arrow in (ii)) that do not completely dissociate. (b) Cells dissociated from E5 embryonic retinas were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid containing 4 ×
Lef-1 responsive element together with Wnt8, Fz5 (100 ng) in combination with the PCDNA plasmid alone (200 ng) or containing Sfrp1, Sfrp3, Sfrp1NTR, Sfrp3NTR, Netrin-1NTR or Sfrp1CRD constructs as indicated in the graph. Wnt8/Fz5 co-transfection
activated the reporter expression 140-fold. This activation was strongly inhibited by the addition of Sfrp1, Netrin-1NTR,
Sfrp1NTR or the combination of Sfrp1NTR and Sfrp1CRD. Equivalent amounts of Sfrp3, Sfrp3NTR or Sfrp1CRD alone were less effective. Data represent means ± standard error from three separate experiments performed in triplicates (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001; Student's t-test). (c) HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1CRDmyc or Sfrp1NTR-myc together with Fz5-HA expression vector (a) or PCDNA vector (Additional file 2). Proteins from cell lysates
were precipitated with anti-HA and then blotted with anti-myc antibody. Note that Sfrp1 and Sfrp1CRD (red asterisks) interacted with Fz5 while the Sfrp1NTR did not. IP, immunoprecipitation; WB western blot.

to expansion of the forebrain associated with posterior
truncations and axial duplications [13]. Taking advantage
of these activities, we have shown here that the NTR
domain of Sfrp1 mimics the function of the full-length
protein, binds to Wnt8 and antagonizes Wnt-canonical
signalling. This activity requires an intact tertiary structure
and is shared by the distantly related Netrin-1NTR. In contrast, the Sfrp1CRD does not mirror the effects of Sfrp1
over-expression but interacts in vitro with Fz receptors and
antagonizes Wnt8-mediated β-catenin transcriptional
activity, indicating that Wnt signalling modulation may
involve multiple and differential interactions among Wnt,
Fz and SFRPs.
These are somewhat surprising observations because it is
generally accepted that Wnt-SFRP interaction takes place
through the CRD domain due to its high degree of conservation with the extracellular portion of the Fz receptors
[8,9]. Several studies in fact have provided convincing evidence that, when used in large amounts compared to Wnt
protein concentration, SFRPs or their respective SfrpCRD
can efficiently block Wnt signalling in different contexts,
such as in Xenopus axis formation [1,9], neural tube [26],
somites [27] and heart formation [28], although a certain
specificity among SFRPs has been observed. Furthermore,
studies using cell lysates from co-transfected cell lines
have shown physical interactions between Wnt1 or Wnt2
and Sfrp3CRD [8,9].
In contrast with this view, we have provided evidence in
favour of the relevance of the NTR domain in SFRP-Wnt
interaction. Although our data suggest that SfrpCRD more
likely interacts with Fz receptors, there are several possibil-

ities worth considering as to why we may have failed to
observe a clear interaction between Sfrp1CRD and Wnt. In
the simpler scenario, the difference we have observed
between the Sfrp1NTR and Sfrp1CRD domains' abilities to
mimic the effect of the entire molecule could have been
related to a differential translation efficiency of their
respective mRNA within the embryos. However, this possibility seems quite unlikely because western blot analysis
of embryo lysates injected with equimolar amounts of
tagged molecules indicated that the different peptides
were produced with similar efficiency and, if any, the
Sfrp1CRD was expressed at higher levels. Similarly,
Sfrp1CRD-myc was retrieved at consistently higher levels in
the culture medium from transfected cell lines [29] and in
primary cultures from retinal cells (unpublished observations). Furthermore, the reduction of the eye field
observed after Sfrp1CRD injections was observed even with
low mRNA doses.
A second possibility may relate to the stoichiometry of the
SfrpCRD-Wnt interaction. It has been proposed that a
dimer of the CRD Fz8 domain binds Wnt8 [30] and dimerisation of the receptor may increase efficiency of signal
transduction [31]. If Sfrp1CRD dimers form and bind Wnt8
more efficiently, it is possible that we may have missed
this interaction since we noticed that we mostly immunoprecipitate the monomeric form (Figure 8a(iv)). This possibility, however, does not explain why in the reverse
inmunoprecipitations (Additional file 2) the Wnt8Sfrp1CRD immunocomplex was not observed. Similarly, it
does not explain why Sfrp1CRD cannot counteract Wnt1/5/
8 function in vivo, where both monomers and possible
dimers seem to be present in similar amounts (Figure 3).

Neural Development 2008, 3:19

As a third possibility, failure of the SfrpCRD to antagonize
Wnt signalling may reflect specificity of binding.
Although we have shown that SfrpCRD failed to interact
with Wnt8 and did not counteract the effect of Wnt1,
Wnt5 and Wnt8 overexpression, we cannot exclude that
Sfrp1 might show selectivity of binding through the two
domains with Wnts other than those we have tested.
In agreement with our view of the importance of the SfrpNTR domain in Wnt activity, several studies have provided
indirect evidence in favour of the relevance of this
domain. In Drosophila, the CRD motif of Dfz or Dfz2 is
dispensable for Wg signal transduction and Frizzled proteins lacking the CRD can fully rescue the simultaneous
loss of different Fz receptors or partially rescue the canonical signalling in fz/fz2 double mutants [32]. Furthermore,
a carrier function for the CRD has been suggested in studies where the CRD domain of the Drosophila fz receptor
has been substituted with the structurally distinct Wntbinding domain or with wingless itself [33]. A recent
study, aimed at demonstrating the interaction between
Norrin and Fz4, failed to reveal a positive interaction
between the CRD domain of all human SFRP family
members and Xwnt8, which instead interacts with the
CRD domain of Fz4, 5, 7 and 8 (see Figure 2 in [34]). Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the interaction between Sfrp1
and Wingless mapped the relevant SFRP binding site to
the carboxyl terminus of the protein [4]. Our biochemical
and functional data are in line with this set of data,
strongly supporting the proposal that the NTR domain
has a relevant role in mediating Sfrp function. This role is
conserved also in distantly related domains. Indeed, the
NTR of Sfrp1, 2, and 5 shares a quite similar pattern of
cysteine spacing, related to that of Netrin-1. Conformational similarities are, therefore, likely to explain why
over-expression of Sfrp1NTR, Sfrp2NTR and Netrin-1NTR
results in all cases in forebrain expansion and effective
inhibition of Wnt8-induced β-catenin activation. In contrast, Sfrp3NTRand Sfrp4NTR display a different cysteine
spacing and, thus, a distinct pattern of disulphide bonds
[5], supporting that variations in the NTR structural features could underlie the differences in activities observed
among the distinct subgroups of the family [5,16], as we
have observed with Sfrp3NTR.
The crystallographic resolution of the structure of the
mouse Sfrp3 and Fz8 CRD domains revealed the potential
for the different CRDs to homo- or heterodimerise [10].
This potential has also been demonstrated in biochemical
studies where SFRPs and Fzs and/or their CRDs have been
shown to form homo- and/or hetero-complexes
[8,24,31]. In line with these data, we have demonstrated
a physical interaction between Sfrp1CRD and Fz5 and Fz2.
This binding may very well justify the potential of the
Sfrp1CRD to antagonize, albeit with lower efficiency,

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/19

Wnt8-induced β-catenin activation, as we have observed
in our experimental conditions mimicking the physiological extracellular interactions among Fz, Wnt and SFRPs.
This interaction also provides a mechanism, based on
functional inactivation of the receptor, to explain why, in
many studies, addition of high levels of the CRD alone is
sufficient to prevent Wnt signalling activation. The reason
why, in our studies, Sfrp1CRD over-expression in medaka
fish embryos seems to synergize rather than prevent the
effect of Wnt8 over-expression (Figure 2) is, however,
unclear. As a tempting speculation, Sfrp1CRD may have
higher affinity for Fz receptors that, like Fz2 [35], are
involved in mediating non-canonical signalling, which, in
turn, has been shown to antagonize the Wnt canonical
pathway during eye field specification [36]. Alternatively,
in the embryo, Sfrp1CRD may interfere with other cell signalling pathways, as demonstrated for the CRD of Sizzled,
a related family member that binds and inhibits Tolloid/
BMP1, metalloproteases that normally degrade the BMP
inhibitor chordin, thereby promoting BMP signalling
[23,37].

Conclusion
We have provided functional and biochemical evidence
that the NTR, but not the CRD, domain of Sfrp1 mimics
the function of the entire molecule. These results challenge several reports implying that the CRD domain of
SFRPs, due to its homology with the proposed Wnt binding region on Fz receptors, interferes with Wnt signalling
by binding and sequestering the ligand [8,9]. These apparent contradictions can, however, be reconciled with two
assumptions. First, SFRPs of different subgroups have different biochemical interactions with Wnt ligands. In support of this assumption, plasmon resonance binding
studies using Sfrp1, 2, 3, 4 and Wnt3a and Wnt5 have
shown that Wnt5 binds preferentially to Sfrp1 and 2,
while Wnt3a binds at least two sites in Sfrp1, 2, 4 and one
in Sfrp3 [16]. Second, SFRP molecules interact with both
Wnt and Fz in multiple ways and these interactions can
modulate signal transduction in either a positive or negative manner. In this view, there are several possible mechanisms by which SFRPs can modulate Wnt signalling
(Figure 9). SFRP could sequester Wnt ligands through the
NTR domain, thus acting as antagonists (Figure 9a; this
study) or act in a dominant-negative manner through the
formation of inactive complexes with Fz receptors, preventing signal activation (Figure 9b; as proposed previously [8], and this study). Alternatively, SFRPs could
favour Wnt-Fz interaction by simultaneously binding to
both molecules and, thus, synergizing with signal activation (Figure 9c), as reported previously [4]. Finally, in the
absence of Wnt ligands, SfrpCRD-FzCRD heterodimer formation could trigger signal transduction (Figure 9d), as
proposed previously [24]. Notably, the activation of the
Fz receptors by a proposed ligand-antagonist is not

unique to SFRP1, as Dickkopf2, which belongs to a different family of Wnt antagonists, can activate Wnt canonical
signalling cooperating with at least three different Fzs
[38].
Genetic manipulations selectively eliminating one or the
other domain of SFRPs may provide further insights and
help resolve the accuracy of these models. Additional
studies characterizing the functionally relevant interactions among SfrpNTR-Wnt or SfrpCRD-Fz pairs are also
undoubtedly needed. Interaction with additional components of the Wnt signalling cascade also needs to be
addressed. Particularly relevant might be the contributions of proteoglycans, which are known to bind Wnts
[39] and may additionally interact with the SfrpNTR (PE,
unpublished observations). An accurate establishment of
SFRP mode of action is indeed particularly important
given the growing interest in these molecules raised by the
observations that their expression is altered in different
type of cancers, bone pathologies, retinal degenerations
and hypophosphatemic diseases, pointing to their potential value as therapeutic targets.

Materials and methods
Whole-mount in situ hybridisation
Whole-mount in situ hybridizations were performed in
medaka embryos using digoxigenin- and fluoresceinlabelled riboprobes. A minimum of 40 embryos were
hybridized for each marker and condition. All embryos
shown correspond to Iwamatsu stage 19–20 [40].
Construct generation
olSfrp1, mWnt8a, zWnt5 and zWnt1 expression constructs
have been described [13,36,41,42]. zSizzled was a kind gift
of Dr Hibi and xSizzled of Dr E De Robertis. Medaka Sfrp2
full length clone corresponds to the expressed sequence
tag MF01SSA080C03, kindly provided by Dr. Takeda.
zSfrp3 and olNetrin-1 where cloned by RT-PCR using specific primers. Full length, truncated and chimerical coding
sequences of Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp3 and Netrin-1 where cloned
by PCR into pCS2+. All chimerical constructs where
designed so that the signal peptide of the corresponding
protein was fused in frame with the linker region that precedes the NTR domain, ensuring proper secretion of the
corresponding peptide (Figure 1). Cysteine to serine
mutations were introduced into the NTR of both Sfrp1
and Netrin-1 by PCR. Given the structural similarity
between serine and cysteine, this substitution is expected
to disrupt di-sulphide bridge formation without altering
the secondary structure of the peptide. Carboxy-terminal
3xHA tagged constructs of Sfrp1, Sfrp1CRD and Sfrp1NTR
were generated with linker oligos. All constructs were fully
sequenced to ensure in-frame fusions.

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/19

mRNA and morpholino injections
pCS2 plasmids were linearised and transcribed in vitro
using the SP6 Message mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin,
TX, USA). The synthesized mRNA was purified and
injected into two-cell stage embryos at different concentrations (titration curve: 50–300 ng/μl) and the severity of
the induced phenotypes was dose dependent in all the
cases. Injection solutions included 30 ng/ml of hGFP
mRNA as a lineage tracer. Selected working concentrations correspond to equimolecular amounts of the different Sfrp mRNAs (full length, truncated and chimerical) to
obtain equivalent protein levels (Tables 1 and 2). Mo
studies were performed as previously described [13] using
the following tested Mo (Gene Tools, LLC, Philomath,
OR, USA) designed against olSfrp1: 5'-CTGTGTTT GTAGGAACCTCGACTGG-3'. Mo were injected at the final concentration of 0.3 mM into one blastomere of embryos at
the two-cell stage. For co-injection experiments, 60 ng of
Sfrp1 or 30 ng of Sfrp1CRD or 35 ng of Sfrp1NTR mRNAs
were used. At least three independent experiments were
conducted for each marker and condition.
Protein expression and immunoprecipitations
To determine the efficiency of translation of the Sfrp1 and
its derivatives, triply-HA tagged constructs were generated
(see above) and their respective mRNAs were injected into
medaka embryos in equimolecular amounts (Sfrp1-3HA,
200 ng/μl; Sfrp1CRD-3HA, 100 ng/μl; and Sfrp1NTR-3HA,
120 ng/μl) together with GFP mRNA as a tracer. For each
construct, 30 embryos were treated with lysis buffer (150
mM NaCl; 1% NP40; 50 mM Tris pH 8; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF). Lysates were precipitated
with a polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI,
USA) and Protein G-Sepharose for enrichment. The protein complex present in each of the pellets was re-suspended in 2 × SDS sample buffer containing 1 M urea. The
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE blotted and the
membranes probed with a monoclonal anti-HA (SigmaAldrich). Proteins from total cell extracts were subjected to
SDS-PAGE, blotted and the membranes probed with an
anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad CA, USA) and a secondary anti-rabbit-POD antibody.

Sub-confluent HEK 293T cells were transiently and separately transfected with constructs encoding chick Wnt8cHA, chick Sfrp1-myc or Sfrp1CRD-myc or Sfrp1NTR-myc in 2%
fetal calf serum. After 2 days, the conditioned media were
collected and clarified by centrifugation. The amount of
protein present in the conditioned media was evaluated
by western blot and similar amounts of peptides derived
from each Sfrp1-myc present in the conditioned media
were mixed with conditioned medium from Wnt8-HA or
mock transfected for 2 hours. Sample volumes were

adjusted to 600 μl with lysis buffer (as above). Proteins
from conditioned media were precipitated with 3 μg of an
anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and Protein
G-Sepharose. After four washes with lysis buffer, the protein complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted and the
membranes probed with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10) and a secondary anti-mouse-POD antibody.
Signal was detected with the Advanced ECL Western blotting detection Kit analysis (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Pollards Wood, Buckinghamshire, UK). Reverse inmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using similar
incubations of conditioned media. Proteins were precipitated with a polyclonal anti-myc antibody (SIGMA). The
immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted
and the membranes probed with a monoclonal anti-myc
antibody (9E10) and a secondary anti-mouse-POD antibody.
For Fz2 and Fz5 immunoprecipitations, HEK 293T cells
were transiently transfected with mouse Fz2-HA, chickSfrp1-myc or Sfrp1CRD-myc or Sfrp1NTR-myc or cotransfected
with mouse Fz5-HA and chick-Sfrp1-myc or Sfrp1CRD-myc or
Sfrp1NTR-myc expression constructs. After 2 days, cells were
scraped in lysis buffer (as above). Immunoprecipitations
were performed as previously described [24].
Reporter assays
Dissociated cells from embryonic day (E)5 central retinas
were prepared as described [29], seeded in 24-well plates
and transfected 3 hours later using the FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA). In each case the
700 ng/well of total DNA contained 200 ng of a plasmid
containing a 4xLef-1 responsive luciferase reporter and 50
ng of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) together with
variable amounts of the effector plasmids or the empty
vector. After 24 hours, luciferase activities were determined using a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega).
The LEF-1 reporter luciferase activity was normalized with
that of the Renilla luciferase to account for transfection
efficiency. Data were statistically evaluated using the SPSS
v15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) applying a one-way ANOVA test plus post hoc test (Dunnet test).

Authors' contributions
JLR, PE and PB conceived, designed and discussed the
study. JLR constructed most of the plasmids and performed and analysed the overexpression studies. PE constructed part of the plasmids, performed the reporter
assays and immnoprecipitation studies and participated
in the analysis of in vivo studies. JMR performed and analysed the Mo-rescue studies as well as Wnt1/Sfrp1 coinjection studies. JLR and PE wrote a draft of the manuscript. PB wrote the final version of the manuscript, which
was approved by all authors.

SFRPCRD peptides cannot rescue the Wnt8- or Wnt5-induced over-expression phenotype. All the panels are dorsal views of embryos at stage 19–20
(optic vesicle stage) injected with GFP mRNA alone or combined with
Wnt8, Wnt5, Sfrp1CRD-2, or Sfrp3CRD mRNA as indicated. Note that
Sfrp1CRD-2 (b) behaves as Sfrp1CRD (Figure 1c) in over-expression assays,
while Sfrp3CRD has no evident effect even at high concentrations (c; 300
ng/μl). Consistently, neither Sfrp1CRD nor Sfrp3CRD can rescue the phenotype induced upon Wnt8 (D-F) or Wnt5 (G-I) over-expression. See
Tables 1 and 2 for details. Scale bar: 0.1 mm.

Image acquisition
Live embryos were visualized at room temperature under
a Leica stereomicroscope equipped with a PLANAPO
objective. Embryos processed for in situ hybridization
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and equilibrated in 80% glycerol. After removal of the yolk, embryos
were mounted and visualized under a Leica microscope.
In all cases, images were captured with a Leica digital camera controlled by the Leica software.

Wnt8 binds to Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR while Sfrp1CRD binds to Frizzled 2. (a)
Mixed conditioned media used in Figure 8a (see legend) were precipitated
with a polyclonal anti-myc and blotted with a monoclonal anti-HA (upper
panel). Controls for inputs (middle and lower panels) are the same as
those described in Figure 8a(ii and iii). Wnt8-HA co-immunoprecipitated
with both Sfrp1-myc and Sfrp1NTR-myc while Sfrp1CRD-myc did not. (b)
HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with Fz2-HA constructs
together with Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1CRD-myc or Sfrp1NTR-myc. Proteins from cell
lysates were precipitated with anti-HA and then blotted with anti-myc
antibody. Note that Sfrp1 and Sfrp1CRD (red asterisks) interact with Fz2
while the Sfrp1NTR does not. (c) Conditioned media from mock transfected cells were mixed with Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1NTR-myc or Sfrp1CRD-myc conditioned media (as above). Addition of anti-HA polyclonal antibodies did
not cause unspecific immunoprecipitations as revealed by western blotting
with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. (d) Addition of anti-HA polyclonal
antibodies did not cause unspecific immunoprecipitations in cell lysates
from mock and Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1NTR-myc or Sfrp1CRD-myc co-transfected
cells as revealed by western blots with anti-Myc antibody.

Wnt8/Fz5 mediated activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity in dissociated embryonic retinal cells is inhibited by soluble Sfrp1 and Sfrp1NTR
as well as by the Sfrp1CRD. (a) E5 embryonic chick retinal cells were dissociated and co-transfected with a reporter plasmid containing 4xLef-1
responsive element, the control plasmid pRLTK and the effector plasmids
for each condition. In retinal cells, endogenous β-catenin transcriptional
activity is low and barely modified by transfection of Fz5 alone or by the
co-transfection of Fz5 with Sfrp1, Sfrp1CRD or Sfrp1NTR. In contrast,
strong reporter activation is observed upon Fz5 and Wnt8 co-transfection.
(b) HEK 293T cells grown in 2% fetal calf serum were transfected with
Sfrp1-myc, Sfrp1CRD-myc, or Sfrp1NTR-myc. Two days later the conditioned media were collected and similar amounts of proteins were added
to dissociated retinal cell cultures co-transfected with a reporter plasmid
(as above), pRLTK, Wnt8 and Fz5. TCF-luciferase activity was measured
after 24 hours of incubation. Note how the conditioned media strongly
inhibit reporter activities. Data represent means ± standard error from
three separate experiments performed in triplicates. (c) Cells dissociated
from E5 embryonic retinas were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid
containing 4xLef-1 responsive element together with Wnt8, Fz5 (100 ng)
in combination with the PCDNA plasmid alone (200 ng) or containing
Sfrp1, zSizzled, Sfrp1CRD or zSizzledCRD as indicated in the graph.
Wnt8/Fz5 co-transfection activated the reporter expression. This activation was significantly inhibited by the addition of Sfrp1 and Sfrp1CRD
while with less efficiency by the addition of zSizzled or zSizzledCRD. Similar results were obtained with the Xenopus sizzled constructs. *p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
