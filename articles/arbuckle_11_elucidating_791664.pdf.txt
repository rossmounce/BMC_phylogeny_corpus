Elucidating the domain architecture and
functions of non-core RAG1: The capacity of a
non-core zinc-binding domain to function in
nuclear import and nucleic acid binding

Abstract
Background: The repertoire of the antigen-binding receptors originates from the rearrangement of
immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genetic loci in a process known as V(D)J recombination. The initial site-specific
DNA cleavage steps of this process are catalyzed by the lymphoid specific proteins RAG1 and RAG2. The majority
of studies on RAG1 and RAG2 have focused on the minimal, core regions required for catalytic activity. Though not
absolutely required, non-core regions of RAG1 and RAG2 have been shown to influence the efficiency and fidelity
of the recombination reaction.
Results: Using a partial proteolysis approach in combination with bioinformatics analyses, we identified the
domain boundaries of a structural domain that is present in the 380-residue N-terminal non-core region of RAG1.
We term this domain the Central Non-core Domain (CND; residues 87-217).
Conclusions: We show how the CND alone, and in combination with other regions of non-core RAG1, functions
in nuclear localization, zinc coordination, and interactions with nucleic acid. Together, these results demonstrate
the multiple roles that the non-core region can play in the function of the full length protein.

Background
Development of the adaptive immune system relies on
the coordinated assembly of the genes encoding immunoglobulin and T cell receptor subunits in a process
known as V(D)J recombination [1]. In this process, one
of each type of component variable (V), diversity (D)
and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the
coding sequence of the antigen binding regions. Due in
part to the array of potential gene segment combinations, V(D)J recombination events lead to the vast
sequence diversity in the antigen receptor repertoire.
The site-specific DNA cleavage reactions in V(D)J
recombination are catalyzed by the lymphoid specific
proteins RAG1 and RAG2 in a cell lineage and stage
specific manner. The recombination signal sequence
(RSS) that flanks each gene segment directs the RAG

proteins to the appropriate DNA cleavage sites. The
RSS consists of both a conserved heptamer and a nonamer sequence separated by a poorly conserved spacer of
either 12 or 23 base pairs. Appropriate recombination
only occurs between gene segments flanked by RSSs of
dissimilar spacer lengths, a requirement referred to as
the 12/23 rule.
V(D)J recombination occurs in two distinct phases, the
first of which relies largely on the RAG proteins. During
the first phase of recombination, the RAG proteins
assemble on the RSSs of the two gene segments to be
recombined, forming a pre-cleavage synaptic (or paired)
complex. The proteins first generate a single-strand nick
5’ of the heptamer sequence of the RSS, producing a
free 3’ hydroxyl group on the coding gene segment.
This hydroxyl group subsequently attacks the opposing
strand in a direct transesterification reaction, generating
a double-strand break at the coding gene:RSS border
[2]. Under physiological conditions, hairpin formation
requires that the RAG proteins bind to both a 12-RSS

and 23-RSS in a paired complex [3-8]. The generation of
double-strand breaks is therefore coordinated at the two
RSSs undergoing recombination, assuring that doublestrand breaks are not made at isolated RSSs. The products of this first phase of recombination are bluntended RSSs and covalently sealed coding gene segments.
The second phase of recombination involves the opening, processing, and subsequent joining of the covalently
sealed hairpin structures and the RSS signal ends to
form coding and signal joints, respectively. This phase
relies on the action of the ubiquitously expressed proteins of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA
repair pathway [9], although the RAG proteins may
function in this phase by ensuring proper DNA repair
through the NHEJ machinery [4,10-13].
Early studies of the RAG proteins identified the minimal regions of the proteins required for catalysis
[14-17]. These regions, referred to as the core proteins,
demonstrated improved solubility over their full-length
counterparts and have therefore served as the basis for
most biochemical studies of the RAG proteins [18].
Murine core RAG1 consists of residues 384-1008 from
the 1040 residue full length protein, and murine core
RAG2 includes residues 1-387 from the 527 residue full
length protein. Core RAG1 consists of multiple structural domains, termed the nonamer binding domain
(NBD; residues 389-464) [19], and the central (residues
528-760) and C-terminal (residues 761-980) domains
[20]. Besides the ability to recognize the RSS nonamer
and heptamer through the NBD [19,21,22] and the central domain [20,23], respectively, core RAG1 contains
the essential acidic active site residues [24-26]. Core
RAG2 is predicted to adopt a six-bladed propeller structure [27] and functions to enhance sequence-specific
interactions of RAG1 to the RSS [28,29], and possibly
induce conformational changes in RAG1 to activate
DNA cleavage activity [30].
The non-core regions of both RAG proteins, though
considered “dispensable” for recombination, are wellconserved, suggesting that these regions have a functional role. Notably, a number of studies have shown
that core RAG1 and core RAG2 were significantly less
efficient in the recombination of both exogenous plasmid substrates and endogenous genetic loci when compared to their full-length counterparts [8,17,31-36]. The
impact of this decreased recombination efficiency was
shown in experiments using core RAG1 or core RAG2
knock-in mice. Mice expressing either core RAG protein
in place of its full-length counterpart demonstrated
impaired B and T cell development [35,36], with a
reduction in RSS cleavage and limited specific recombination events at both IgH and TCRb loci [34-36].
Furthermore, recombination products showed an
increased frequency of aberrant signal and coding joints,

indicating that the non-core regions of the RAG proteins are critical for appropriate recombination at endogenous genetic loci [37].
Multiple previous studies have shown that non-core
RAG2 contains a PHD module [38], which binds to Histone H3 di- or trimethylated on Lys 4 (H3K4me3)
[39-41]. The interaction with the methylated Histone
H3 is required for efficient recombination on chromatinized substrate [39], and also functions to stimulate the
catalytic nicking and hairpin formation steps [42]. In a
separate role, phosphorylation of Thr 490 is a prerequisite for ubiquitination and degradation of RAG2 at the
G1-S transition of the cell cycle [43].
The role of the N-terminal non-core region of RAG1
has been more elusive. There are three separate lines of
study that indicate important roles of the non-core
region in the function of the RAG1 protein. First, previous mutagenesis studies revealed regions in non-core
RAG1 that significantly impacted recombination of exogenous plasmid substrates [33,44], including a conserved
basic region (located between residues 218-224) [32]
and conserved cysteine residues within the N-terminal
250 residues [33,45]. Second, although most of the noncore region of RAG1 remains structurally undefined, the
crystal structure of a conserved zinc dimerization
domain (ZDD) between residues 265-380 has been
solved [46,47]. Further, the RING finger within this
domain exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, demonstrating autoubiquitination, as well as ubiquitination of an
artificial substrate in in vitro assays [48,49]. The RAG1
RING finger has also been shown to facilitate ubiquitination of the nuclear transport protein karyopherin
alpha 1 [50] and Histone H3 [51,52]. How the E3 ligase
activity on either of these latter targets affects the V(D)J
recombination process has yet to be established. Third,
regions N-terminal to the ZDD in full length RAG1
have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions. For example, full-length RAG1 co-purifies with
the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer under low stringency conditions, and this association requires the presence of
non-core RAG1 residues 211-383 [53]. In a separate
study, a yeast two-hybrid approach demonstrated that a
region of non-core RAG1, encompassed by residues
173-250, mediated interactions with the transcription
factor GMEB1 and the splicing factor SF3A2 [54].
Although the full implications of these protein-protein
interactions are not yet clear, these studies indicate that
non-core RAG1, like non-core RAG2, plays multiple
roles in the recombination reaction and its regulation.
To further our understanding of RAG1, we have utilized biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical
approaches to identify the domain composition of the
N-terminal non-core region of the protein. In this context, a domain is defined as an independently folded

Arbuckle et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:23

unit that can retain biological activity even if excised
from the full length protein. Since domains can participate in key functions of the intact protein, such as providing binding surfaces for macromolecular interactions,
it will be critical to determine the domain architecture
of non-core RAG1 to obtain a detailed understanding of
its function. Here, we have identified domain boundaries
that yielded isolation of a structurally independent
domain, termed the central non-core domain (CND),
which consists of residues 87-217. We show that this
domain interacts strongly with zinc ions, preferentially
binds double-stranded DNA, and in conjunction with a
neighboring non-core region contributes to nuclear
localization of the full length RAG1 protein.

Results
Identification of domain boundaries in non-core RAG1

To characterize the non-core region of RAG1, residues
1-380 of murine RAG1 were expressed as a maltosebinding protein (MBP) fusion construct in E. coli.
Expression of the non-core region in its entirety resulted
in extensive proteolysis and aggregation of the protein.
We therefore took a domain approach to characterize
the non-core region of RAG1, with the goal that identification and characterization of independent structural
domains would provide important insights into the
function of non-core RAG1. In this study, we identified
a structural domain in the N-terminal non-core region
of RAG1, which we term the central non-core domain
(CND). Our strategy is outlined in Figure 1.
Noting that proteolysis frequently occurs at domain
boundaries [55], we first identified the proteolytic product generated during the expression of MBP-RAG1(1380). Using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the size of
the cleavage product generated during purification was
found to be consistent with cleavage of the fusion construct occurring C-terminal to residue 86 (Figure 2A). A
fragment consisting of murine RAG1 residues 1-86 was
then expressed as an MBP fusion (MBP-RAG1(1-86)).
The resultant fusion protein formed a discrete monomeric species during size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) (Figure 2B).

Figure 1 Summary of steps in the identification of domains in
non-core RAG1.

Next, we expressed the remaining region of non-core
RAG1 as an MBP fusion construct (MBP-RAG1(87380)) (Figure 2C). Though a small portion of this construct remained full-length throughout purification
(peak 1), this protein also underwent extensive proteolysis. Analysis of the primary species observed by SEC
(peak 2) by mass spectrometry of MBP-RAG1(87-380)
indicated that the molecular weight of the cleavage products was consistent with cleavage occurring C-terminal
to residues 190, 217, 232, and 238 (Figure 2D). Subcloning and expression of fusion constructs terminating at
either residue 232 or 238 resulted in further proteolysis
during purification (not shown). In addition, termination
at residue 232 or 238 disrupts the previously described
basic regions within non-core RAG1 [31]. Thus, we
characterized the fragment consisting of residues 87-217
(the CND). This region contains the conserved cysteine
residues previously described [33]. MBP fused to RAG1
residues 87-217 was markedly well behaved, with no
detectable proteolysis or aggregation occurring during
purification (Figure 2E &2F).
Earlier studies of non-core RAG1 identified and characterized the ZDD, which is located between residues
265-380, and is at the N-terminal border to the core
region of the protein [46,47]. A previous study showed
that the non-core RAG1 fragment consisting of residues
218-389 catalyzes autoubiquitination at residue 233 [48].
To characterize the biophysical properties of this region,
we generated a fusion construct between MBP and residues 218-380 of RAG1 (MBP-RAG1(218-380)). We refer
to this fragment as the basic-zinc dimerization domain
(bZDD), as it contains both the conserved basic region
and the ZDD. Expression of this construct in E. coli
resulted in fusion protein that eluted from SEC in two
peaks, with the peak eluting at V o likely containing
aggregated protein and the second peak containing
more well-behaved protein (Figure 2G).
Bioinformatic analysis of non-core RAG1

Next, we used bioinformatics methods to analyze the
non-core region of RAG1 in order to obtain additional
corroboration as to the multi-domain architecture of
this region of the protein. First, phylogenetic analysis of
the N-terminal non-core region was performed using
Intrepid [56] and ConSeq [57], with both methods giving similar results. Figure 3A illustrates the results from
Intrepid. There is a strikingly higher level of conservation for the region encompassing residues 100-215 as
opposed to its flanking sequences. Specifically, the mean
z-score (see Figure 3A legend) for residues 100-215 is
0.41, whereas the 50 residues N-terminal and C-terminal
to this region have z-scores of -0.3 and -0.2, respectively.
The region corresponding to the ZDD is 0.41, also indicating a more highly conserved domain.

Figure 3 Bioinformatic analysis of the N-terminal non-core region of RAG1. (A) Sequence conservation of the N-terminal non-core RAG1
region based on phylogenetic analysis. The z-score (y-axis) for each residue is a comparison of the observed conservation at that residue to the
mean conservation across all sites in the sequence, and is the number of standard deviations away from the mean value [56]. Positions with a
more positive z-score are more highly conserved, whereas positions with a more negative score are less conserved. (B) Regions in the Nterminal non-core region of RAG1 predicted to be highly disordered are shown as thick bars. Each bar is labeled with N- and C-terminal residue
numbers. Predictions 1 and 2 are results from DripPred and Disopred programs (see Methods), respectively. (C) The domain architecture of noncore RAG1 based on the combined experimental results (in Figure 2) and the bioinformatic methods.

Multi-domain proteins can be altered through evolution by the acquisition of domains, which render additional functionalities to the protein [58]. The jawed
vertebrate RAG1 proteins have retained the N-terminal
non-core region, including that corresponding to the
CND, the basic region, and the ZDD. Within the last
decade, RAG1-like sequences have also been found in
invertebrate species [59-61]. The purple sea urchin
RAG1-like sequence contains an extended N-terminal
non-core region [60]. The alignment of sea urchin
RAG1-like protein and murine RAG1 has been shown
in detail in a previous study [60]. Notably, only the
region corresponding to residues 100-215 in murine
RAG1 is present in the non-core region of the sea
urchin RAG1-like sequence. In contrast, the ZDD is
replaced with an unrelated sequence consisting of 11
repeats of an 8-residue sequence [60]. Thus, the region

corresponding to residues 100-215 likely plays an early
role in the evolutionary history of the protein [60,61].
Aside from the zinc binding motifs in the ZDD (RING
and ZFA) of non-core RAG1, there is no sequence
homology to known protein domains. Difficulties remain
in ab initio prediction of domain boundaries [62]. However, structural domains are often embedded within disordered or unstructured regions in multi-domain
proteins, and methods to predict disordered regions in
proteins are proving to be reasonably accurate [63].
Here, we used multiple algorithms to predict disordered
regions in the non-core RAG1 sequence, with good
agreement between separate methods (Figure 3B). Specifically, the regions predicted to be highly disordered
immediately flank either side of residues 100-215. This
latter region, which closely corresponds to the CND,
and the ZDD are predicted to be highly ordered,

Arbuckle et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:23

consistent with these regions folding into compact
structural domains.
It is well acknowledged that the full length RAG1 protein is problematic to work with; and as such it has not
been feasible to show that the non-core domains are
proteolytically resistant in the mammalian expressed full
length protein. However, these bioinformatic results
combined with the experimental studies on the bacterially-expressed non-core region (Figure 2) strongly indicate that the domain architecture of the N-terminal
non-core region within the full length protein consists
of two major structural domains (illustrated in Figure
3C).
It is possible that the first 86 residues of full length
RAG1 also fold into an independent domain; however,
the low sequence conservation of this region suggests it
does not play a central role in RAG1 functions. Moreover, the basic region, which links the CND and ZDD,
is predicted to be disordered, consistent with our findings of multiple cleavage sites in this region (Figure 2D).
Biophysical analysis of the RAG1 CND in self-association,
zinc binding, and protein stability

Full length RAG1 likely functions as a dimer, or higher
oligomer [64]. Both the core region and the ZDD dimerize when expressed separately and when included in the
same fragment (residues 263-1008) [65]. To determine if
other regions in the N-terminal non-core region of
RAG1 besides the ZDD contributes to dimer formation,
SEC coupled with multi-angled laser light scattering
(MALLS-SEC) was performed. MALLS-SEC analysis of
MBP-RAG1(1-86) and the predominant MBP-CND species (Species 2 in Figure 2E) show that both fusion proteins are monomeric (Figure 4A &4B). The minor form
of MBP-CND (Species 1 in Figure 2E) does not appear
to represent a functional form of the domain, as the
aggregate did not dissociate upon reapplication to SEC
(not shown), and as the concentrated monomeric MBPCND did not form the aggregated species (Figure 4B).
MALLS-SEC analysis of a tagless form of the CND (see
Methods) confirmed that this domain does not self
associate, and that MBP did not interfere with CND oligomerization in the fusion protein (Figure 4C). As
expected, MBP-bZDD eluted as a predominantly dimeric
species, although with some polydispersity (Figure 4D).
The polydispersity of this fragment is likely due to the
basic region, as MBP-ZDD was previously shown to be
a monodisperse dimer [46]. Based on these results, we
conclude that the ZDD is the only domain in non-core
RAG1 that can self-associate and contribute to oligomerization of the full-length protein.
The CND contains multiple conserved cysteine and
histidine residues, and it was previously suggested that
this region of non-core RAG1 may coordinate zinc

Page 6 of 18

ions [33]. However, the spacing of these conserved
residues is not consistent with any previously
described zinc binding motif. To determine if the
CND participates in zinc binding, inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and flame atomic
absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) methods were used.
The two methods show that the CND (both the MBP
fusion protein and the tagless form) binds two zinc
ions (Table 1). As a control the zinc content of MBPbZDD was also determined, and measured at four zinc
ions per MBP-bZDD monomer, consistent with the
known zinc-binding stoichiometry for the ZDD (Table
1) [47]. Treatment of CND with the chelator DTPA
was sufficient to remove the majority of zinc from the
protein (Table 1). Subsequently, the zinc-free form of
CND, referred to as apoCND, failed to re-bind zinc
ions, indicating that the removal of zinc from CND
may cause an irreversible structural change in the
domain under the conditions used here. Potential
zinc-coordinated residues were mutated in three separate mutants, C110,113A, C175,178A, and C210,213A,
which were expressed and purified as MBP fusions
from E. coli BL21 cells. Although the mutants were
expressed in lon-deficient E. coli BL21 cells, each
CND mutant underwent significant proteolysis during
purification, consistent with the importance of these
residues in the structural integrity of the CND (not
shown).
To characterize the secondary structure of the CND,
the MBP portion of the fusion construct was removed
and tagless CND purified. Investigation of CND by far
UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (at 20°C)
demonstrated that the domain was structured, containing 28 ± 4% alpha helical and 25 ± 2% beta sheet content (Figure 5A). Changes in signal intensity at 222 nm
were monitored during thermal denaturation. A representative denaturation profile is shown in Figure 5B.
The Tm values from five separate experiments ranged
between 55°C to 62°C yielding an average Tm value of
59 ± 3.5°C. The changes in CD spectra observed during
thermal denaturation of CND were not reversible under
the conditions used here. To determine the impact of
zinc on the secondary structure of CND, apoCND was
also monitored using CD spectroscopy under conditions
identical to those used for the zinc-bound domain. The
CD spectrum of apoCND at 20°C showed a significant
loss of signal at 222 nm indicating a decrease in alpha
helical content (Figure 5A). The CD spectra of apoCND
remained unchanged after titration and incubation with
zinc (data not shown), consistent with our finding that
apoCND did not rebind zinc after dialysis into zinc-containing buffer (see above). Significantly, the changes in
CD spectra observed for apoCND closely resembled
those observed for thermally denatured CND (Figure

molar mass for the species with the longer elution time is ~47 ± 1 kDa, which is consistent with that of the MBP portion of the fusion construct
alone. (B) The predominant form of MBP-CND identified by SEC (see Figure 2E) was pooled, concentrated, and subjected to MALLS-SEC (using a
20 mL Superdex 200 column). The fusion construct eluted as a single species with an observed molar mass of 58,200 ± 700 Da (predicted
monomeric MWt is at 58,400 Da). (C) Tagless CND (at a loading concentration of 23 μM) eluted from a 120 mL Superdex 75 column as a single
species with an observed molar mass of 14,900 ± 300 Da (predicted monomeric MWt is at 15,317 Da). (D) MBP-bZDD eluted from a 20 mL

and cellular localization of the expressed protein in
fixed cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
GFP-full length RAG1 was localized primarily to
nucleoli, consistent with previous results (Figure 6A)
[31,66,67]. In contrast, the localization pattern of GFPcore RAG1 was somewhat more variable, with the
majority of cells (>70%) containing approximately half
(at 46 ± 6%) of the GFP fluorescence signal diffusely
localized in the nucleus (see for example leftmost cell in

Cellular localization and mobility of RAG1 non-core CND
and bZDD domains

Previously, immunofluorescence studies showed the cellular localization pattern of full length RAG1, as well as
various N-terminal non-core fragments [31]. The noncore fragments localized to varying degrees to the overall nucleus, as well as to nuclear subcompartments, such
as nucleoli and nuclear speckles. Although the previous
study used non-core RAG1 fragments [31], the fragments did not precisely coincide with the structural
non-core domains identified in the present study.
To analyze cellular localization properties of different
RAG1 regions, we generated GFP fusion constructs of
the CND, bZDD, and a combination of both domains
(CND+bZDD). In addition, constructs of GFP fused to
both full length and core RAG1 were produced. Each
GFP fusion construct was transfected into HeLa cells

both the nucleus and cytoplasm (see for example the
middle cell in Figure 6B). Lastly, there is a slight but
apparent enrichment of GFP-core RAG1 in nucleoli that
is observed in some cells, with bright nuclear spots evident above the fluorescence intensity of protein diffusely
distributed throughout the cell (see for example rightmost cell in Figure 6B).
In cells expressing GFP-CND, the localization pattern
was similar in all cells analyzed with the majority of the
protein localized to the nucleus in each cell (65 ± 6% of
the GFP fluorescence signal in the nucleus and the
remainder in the cytoplasm) (Figure 6C). The GFPbZDD fusion protein was predominantly localized to
nucleoli, with no protein evident in the cytoplasm (Figure 6D). The combined non-core domains fused to GFP
(GFP-CND+bZDD) also localized primarily to nucleoli
(Figure 6E). These data show that while the CND could
help direct nuclear localization of full length RAG1, the
strong nucleolar localization of the full length protein is
likely due to the basic region of the bZDD.
The relative mobilities of GFP fused to full length and
non-core RAG1 domains in live HeLa cells were evaluated using fluorescence photobleaching experiments
(Figure 7). In fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) experiments, a small region of the cell was
photobleached with a brief laser pulse. We monitored
fluorescence recovery within the photobleached region
over time by collecting a frame every 4 sec following
application of the laser pulse. For each GFP fusion protein, fluorescence recovery was essentially complete
within approximately 10 sec regardless of whether the
protein was diffusely localized in the nucleus (GFPCND) or predominantly in the nucleoli (GFP-full length
RAG1, GFP-bZDD and GFP-(CND+bZDD)). A representative FRAP experiment using a HeLa cell expressing
GFP-(CND+bZDD) is shown in Figure 7A. In this
example 80% of the fluorescence recovered at 12 sec
after photobleaching.
To determine the extent that nucleoli-localized GFP
fusion proteins could diffuse from these nuclear subcompartments, fluorescence loss induced by photobleaching (FLIP) experiments were performed with
HeLa cells expressing GFP-(CND+bZDD) (Figure 7B).
The cell nuclei were repeatedly photobleached with 5 s
pulses, with images acquired between pulses. Using this
method, the diffusion of fluorophore from all nuclear
regions into the path of the laser beam was determined.
The loss of GFP fluorescence signals occurred throughout the entire nucleus within the timeframe of the
experiment (Figure 7B), indicating that the fusion protein could readily exchange between nucleoli and
nucleoplasm subcompartments. Together these FRAP
and FLIP results indicate diffusion of the entire

population of labeled RAG1 construct, with a mobility
comparable to that of other nuclear proteins [68,69].
Assessing sequence-specific and structure-specific DNA
interactions by non-core RAG1 domains

Although non-core RAG1 is not essential for DNA cleavage and binding activity, it may enhance sequence-specific interactions with the RSS. We tested the ability of
non-core RAG1 domains to interact with the RSS using
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Increasing
concentrations of the isolated domains (fused to MBP)
were incubated with a radiolabeled 12-RSS and the
extent of complex formation analyzed by nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. First, we determined
that the CND bound to a ds DNA substrate containing
the wild type (WT) 12-RSS (Figure 8A). The ability of
CND to bind this DNA substrate (tagged with the Oregon Green fluorophore) was confirmed using fluorescence anisotropy experiments (data not shown). The
two independent means of analyzing protein:DNA interactions yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) in the range
of 0.8-3.0 μM. Furthermore, tagless CND demonstrated
a binding affinity for the DNA substrate comparable to
that observed for the MBP-fusion construct (Figure 8B),
confirming that the MBP portion of the fusion construct
did not contribute or interfere with CND:DNA complex
formation. Second, EMSA results showed that the
bZDD bound with relatively low affinity (~1-3 μM) to
the WT 12-RSS substrate (not shown). Although the
isolated ZDD does not associate with DNA [46], the
basic region between residues 218-264 (N-terminal to
the ZDD) gives the entire bZDD fragment a positive
charge (with a predicted pI value of 8.6), which appears
to facilitate DNA binding, as previously suggested
[31,32,70]. Lastly, MBP-RAG1(1-86) only showed negligible interactions with DNA (not shown).
Even though both the CND and bZDD could bind to
the RSS substrate, neither domain could form sequencespecific interactions with the RSS. EMSA assays using
nonlabeled WT or mutant RSS substrates as competitors demonstrated that the CND did not show significant specificity for the RSS nonamer (Figure 8C) or RSS
heptamer (not shown) of the RSS. Similarly, the bZDD:
RSS interaction was not specific for either element of
the RSS as judged by competition assays (not shown).
The observed dissociation constants of the isolated
CND and bZDD domains for the RSS are only of moderate affinity. If either domain recognized an as yet unidentified DNA sequence, it is likely the binding affinities
would be measurably higher to this DNA sequence. To
determine this possibility, a systematic evolution of
ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method was
used [71]. In this method, non-core RAG1 proteins

control, the fluorescence intensity of the nucleus of the adjacent cell that was not photobleached was measured in parallel.

(MBP fused to either the CND alone or to CND+bZDD)
were bound to an oligonucleotide duplex containing an
internal 25 base pairs (bp) of randomized sequence. The
protein-DNA complexes were immobilized on amylose
resin, washed extensively, the bound DNA eluted with
high salt and temperature, and subsequently amplified
by PCR. However, multiple rounds of binding, elution,
and amplification failed to increase the binding affinity
of either fusion protein to the amplified DNA, indicating
that a sequence-specific interaction was not detectable
under the conditions used here (not shown).
Recent evidence suggests that full-length versus core
RAG1 can more effectively retain the coding end hairpin
(hp) in the post-cleavage paired complex containing
both 12- and 23-RSS signal ends [72]. It is possible that
in the context of the full-length protein, the non-core
domains will be juxtaposed close to the coding flanks.
Thus, next we asked if the CND or CND+bZDD showed
structural specificity for different DNA substrates,
including ds, single stranded (ss), or fully complementary hp structures (resembling the coding ends). EMSA
analysis revealed that both MBP-CND (Figure 8D) and
MBP-CND+bZDD (not shown) bound to the ds and hp
substrates with similar affinity, and to ss DNA with significantly lower affinity. Lastly, binding of CND to the
DNA substrates was zinc-dependent, as DTPA-treated
MBP-CND showed significantly weaker complex formation with the DNA substrates (not shown).

Discussion
Though most studies of RAG1 have focused on the
truncated, core region, the non-core region represents
nearly a third of the full-length protein, is well conserved, and has been shown to influence the efficiency
and fidelity of recombination [45]. Nevertheless, its
structural topology is poorly defined, in large part due
to difficulties in characterizing the poorly soluble fulllength protein [18,73,74]. To address this issue, we
undertook the strategy where discrete structural
domains of proteins are defined by their resistance to
proteolysis [55], an approach we previously used to
identify two separate structural and functional domains
in the core region of RAG1 [20]. In the present study,
we identified a previously unknown structural domain
(the CND) within non-core RAG1, which is capable of
folding autonomously. In combination with the ZDD,
these domains represent two-thirds of the N-terminal
non-core region of RAG1. Notably, regions within the
RAG1 gene encoding for residues at/near the CND
boundaries do not contain codons rarely found in E.
coli (not shown). Thus, the formation of the C-terminally truncated MBP-RAG1(1-380) and MBP-RAG1(87380) fusion proteins during protein purification (see
Figures 1 &2) were not due to premature translational

Page 12 of 18

termination, but are instead likely due to increased
proteolytic susceptibility at the domain boundaries by
endogeneous E. coli proteases during cell disruption
and protein purification. Further, the ability of the
CND to form a discrete monomeric species, as
opposed to an extensively aggregated form, is further
evidence that bona fide domain boundaries have been
identified. Lastly, the bioinformatic analysis is fully
consistent with the CND as a conserved, structured
domain flanked by less conserved and highly disordered regions. The CND in relation to other known
motifs in the N-terminal non-core region of RAG1 is
shown schematically in Figure 9.
Significantly, this study expands the zinc-binding capability of full length RAG1. It has been suggested that
the non-core region that includes the CND may bind
zinc ions [33,60]. However, this had not been shown
directly. We show here that the CND coordinates two
zinc ions, which are essential for the folding, stability,
and DNA binding functions of this domain. Along with
the four zinc ions bound in the bZDD, and at least
three zinc ions bound in the core region of RAG1 [75],
the full length protein coordinates at least nine zinc
ions. These zinc ions are coordinated in distinct zincbinding motifs, including C 2 H 2 zinc fingers, a RING
domain, a binuclear zinc cluster, and as yet undefined
zinc motifs in both the CND and core regions. Along
with the PHD zinc-coordinating domain in the non-core
region of RAG2 [38], the RAG1:RAG2 V(D)J recombinase is dependent on zinc-coordination in nearly every
functional role carried out by the enzyme complex during the recombination reaction, including DNA cleavage
[75], macromolecular associations [39,76], and regulatory functions [45].
Here, cellular localization and mobility properties of
full length versus non-core and core regions of RAG1
were examined. Full length RAG1 (fused to the C-terminal end of GFP) strongly localized to nucleoli, with
some protein present in the nucleoplasm, but absent the

described previously [47], the RING finger in RAG1, labeled RING

the zinc binuclear cluster. Three motifs consisting of clusters of basic
residues are shown as red bars. These basic motifs are referred to as
BI, BII, and BIII, and consist of residues 141-146 (BI), residues 222-225
(BII), and 243-249 (BIII) [31].

cytoplasm, consistent with previous reports [31,66,67].
The nucleoli-localized GFP-RAG1 proteins showed relatively fast mobility between the nucleoli and nucleoplasm. Thus, even in the absence of RAG2, full length
RAG1 may gain access to antigen receptor loci, as was
indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays [77].
Association of full length RAG1 with nucleoli may be
mediated by interactions with RNA [31].
Within the library of RAG1 constructs tested, the core
region demonstrated the weakest nuclear localization
pattern, with nearly equal distribution between the
nucleus and cytoplasm in the majority of cells. These
results correspond to previous findings with a RAG1 Nterminal deletion, termed Δ(13-330), which diffusely
localized throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm [17].
Nucleolar localization was observed with both the
bZDD and core regions, with the bZDD showing the
strongest ability to localize to nucleoli. The bZDD and
core regions each contain clusters of basic residues,
which were previously shown to contribute to nucleolar
localization [31]. The bZDD contains the basic motif
BIII (Figure 9). The core region contains the basic
motifs BIV (residues 826-840) and BV (residues 969973), which may both influence nuclear and nucleolar
localization, albeit to weaker extent than BIII [31]. The
CND, which contains BI, another basic motif (Figure 9),
is predominantly nuclear with no obvious enrichment in
nucleoli. This finding differs somewhat from the mutagenesis studies of Spanopoulou et al. [31], in which BI
was reported to function as a major contributor to
nucleolar localization. Even with this latter discrepancy,
our results and others show that the predominant
nuclear localization signals of full length RAG1 lie in
the N-terminal non-core region.
Full length RAG2 appears to alter the localization pattern of full length RAG1. For example, transfection of
the RAG constructs into fibroblast cell lines resulted in
co-localization of both proteins to nucleoplasm, but
spared the nucleoli [31,67]. Interestingly, Spanopoulou
et al. [31] showed localization of both RAG proteins at
the nuclear periphery in primary thymocytes, as visualized by a-RAG1 immunofluorescence experiments. In a
fraction of cells, RAG1 also localized within the nuclear
interior in a speckled pattern. However, localization to
the nuclear periphery has not been consistently observed
in all lymphoid cells tested. For example, following
induction of RAG1 and RAG2 expression in Abelsontransformed pre-B cells, a-RAG1 immunofluorescence
showed diffuse localization of RAG1 throughout the
nucleoplasm, rather than at the nuclear periphery [78].
Additional studies will be important to elucidate factors
that may influence localization properties of the RAG
proteins.

Page 13 of 18

The observation that CND forms complexes with
DNA, albeit with moderate affinity, indicates that noncore RAG1 may participate in maintaining pre- and/or
post-cleavage complexes with the RSS and coding flanks
during V(D)J recombination. Although the CND and
CND+bZDD did not show specific recognition of hairpin ends, the non-core RAG1 region may interact with
ds regions of the coding end. Such an interaction could
function to properly orient the coding ends within the
post-cleavage paired complex, which may be necessary
in directing the DNA ends to the NHEJ DNA repair
pathway. Notably, Ku was recently shown to co-purify
with non-core regions of RAG1 under low stringency
conditions [53]. Although the Ku:RAG1 interaction may
be indirect, it may be critical for the proper processing
of DNA ends. Alternatively, the CND+bZDD region of
non-core RAG1 may associate with DNA within the 12and 23-RSS spacer regions or at the 3’ ends of the RSS
(adjacent to the nonamer), which could help to lock the
V(D)J recombinase on the DNA. A recent study has
shown that full length RAG1, in comparison to core
RAG1, enhances contacts with the RSS spacer regions,
as well as influences the structure of the intervening
DNA between the 12/23 RSSs, in a paired complex [72].
Given our results, it is feasible that the CND is at least
partially responsible for increased contacts of the full
length protein with DNA in the paired complex. Further
investigations into the contribution of the non-core
regions of RAG1 to the assembly of the RAG-DNA
complexes formed during V(D)J recombination will be
important to elucidate the configuration of the fully
intact V(D)J recombinase on the RSSs in the pre- and
post-cleavage complexes.

Conclusions
All together, these results provide a clearer picture of
the architecture of the non-core region of RAG1, as well
as the ability of the non-core domains to coordinate
metal ions, influence nuclear localization, and interact
with DNA. How these domains function together, and
with RAG2, to coordinate their activities in the catalytic
activity and regulation of V(D)J recombination will provide a significant advancement in our understanding of
this intriguing enzyme complex.
Methods
Molecular Cloning and Bacterial Expression of Non-core
RAG1 Domains

RAG1 constructs were generated as previously described
[20], with the following modifications. Briefly, non-core
regions of RAG1 were PCR amplified from the fulllength murine RAG1 gene using primers designed to
create a BamHI site and a SalI site at the 5’ and 3’ ends,

Arbuckle et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:23

respectively. Amplified gene products were then inserted
into the appropriate sites within the multiple cloning
region of the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs).
MBP fusion proteins of RAG1 residues 1-380, 1-86, 87217, 87-380, and 218-380 were encoded by plasmids
pJLA380, pJLA10, pJLA11, pJLA12, and pJLA218 respectively. Conserved cysteine residues within the pJLA11
vector were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange™
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 as
previously described [20]. Briefly, transfected cells were
grown at 37°C until an OD 600 of approximately 1.0.
Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of IPTG to final concentration of 1 μg/mL, and the
culture was grown for an additional 12-15 hours at 25°C.
Cells were then harvested and resuspended in Tris Purification Buffer (TPB) (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10% glycerol,
50 μM ZnCl2, and 5 mM bME) supplemented with 0.5 M
NaCl and PMSF at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.
Following sonication the cell lysate was incubated at 4°C
for 3 hours in the presence of 1 unit/mL RNase A
(Sigma) and 32 units/mL DNase I (Roche). Each MBP
fusion protein was purified by passing cell lysates over
amylose resin (New England Biolabs). The column was
washed sequentially with TPB plus 1.5 M NaCl, TPB plus
0.5 M NaCl, and TPB plus 0.2 M NaCl. Protein was
eluted from the column in TPB plus 0.2 M NaCl with 10
mM maltose. Subsequently, each MBP fusion protein was
then concentrated and fractionated by SEC using a
Superdex 75 or Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare).
Column buffer (GFB) contained 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2
M NaCl, 50 μM ZnCl2, and 5 mM bME. Fractions containing the fusion construct were pooled, concentrated,
and stored at -20°C in 50% glycerol or at -80°C. The
fusion proteins were judged to be > 95% pure based on
analysis of Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE gels.
To remove the MBP construct from the CND fusion
protein (residues 87-217), a PreScission™ Protease (GE
Healthcare) site was generated within the pMAL-c2 vector, 5’ of the multiple cloning site, using a QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
Purified MBP-CND was digested overnight at 4°C in the
presence of 5 units/mg of PreScission™ Protease. Complete digestion of the fusion construct was confirmed by
SDS-PAGE and tagless CND was purified by fractionation of the digestion reaction over an SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and elution with a 0.1-1.2 M
NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the RAG1 domain
were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed into GFB and stored
at -80°C.

volume) or Superdex 75 (with a 120 mL column
volume) columns to analyze the MBP fusion proteins
and tagless RAG1 domains, respectively. The proteins
were analyzed at a starting concentration ranging from
3-10 μM, unless noted otherwise. GFB was used as the
column buffer.
Zinc Analysis

Zinc binding ratios were determined by ICP-MS (Oxidor Corporation, Plano, TX) and by FAAS on a SpectrAA-5 spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA)
as previously described [75]. For the FAAS analysis,
standards of zinc concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20
μM were generated from an atomic absorption zinc
standard solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and used to establish
a standard linear calibration curve. The concentration of
zinc in each sample was determined by measuring the
absorbance at 213.9 nm after vaporization/atomization
of the sample in an air/acetylene-fueled flame. The concentration of zinc in the dialysis buffer was also determined and subtracted as background.
For both methods of measuring zinc content, proteins
were dialyzed into zinc-free buffer (ZFB) containing 20
mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, and 5 mM bME at 4°C
for approximately 40-48 hours with a buffer change at
24 hours. Where indicated, the first round of dialysis
was supplemented with 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, or 5
mM DTPA.
Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy

CD spectroscopy experiments were performed using a
JASCO J715 Spectropolarimeter with a PTC-348WI peltier temperature controller (Jasco, Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
in the OUHSC Physical Biochemistry Equipment Core
Facility. The spectral parameters used were as follows:
270-195 nm wavelength range, 0.1 cm cuvette pathlength, and 8-10 accumulations per spectrum. For the
wavelength scan analyses, spectra were acquired at 20°C.
Protein samples were dialyzed into CD buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1 mM bME). In
some cases, the dialysis buffer was supplemented with

Arbuckle et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/23

10 mM EDTA pH 8.0 or 5 mM DTPA. The protein
samples were dialyzed for 48 hours at 4°C in the CD
buffer with one to two buffer changes prior to acquiring
the CD spectra. Chelating agents were excluded from
the final buffer. Protein secondary structural content
was predicted using the CDPro software package as previously described [65,80]. Data presented represent the
average of results generated by the CDSSTR and CONTINLL programs using three soluble protein reference
sets, SP29, SP37, and SP43.
Thermal denaturation studies of CND were performed
in CD buffer (listed above). The temperature was raised
from 20°C to 90°C at a rate of 30°C/hour with constant
monitoring of the intensity of the signal at 222 nm.
With each 10°C increase in temperature, the sample was
held at a constant temperature for 5 minutes before
wavelength scans were taken. The spectral parameters
used for the scans during thermal denaturation
included: 270-195 nm wavelength range, 0.1 cm cuvette
pathlength, and 4 accumulations per spectrum. The
fraction folded (fn) for each data point was calculated as
follows: fn = (S§-S)/(S§-S°) where S is the signal intensity
at each intermediate temperature, S° is the signal intensity for the fully folded species and S § is the signal
intensity for the fully denatured species. The T m ,
defined as the point at which fn = 0.5, was determined
and averaged for five independent denaturation profiles.
DNA substrates for EMSA

Oligonucleotide substrates were commercially synthesized and PAGE purified (Integrated DNA Technology).
The sequence of the top strand of the WT 12-RSS is: d
(GATATGGCTCGTCTTACACAGTGATATAGACCTTAACAAAAACCTCCAATCGAGCGGAG) in which
the conserved heptamer and nonamer elements are
underlined. Mutant 12-RSS substrates were identical to
the WT 12-RSS sequence except with the heptamer
mutated from CACAGTG to GAGAAGC in the mutant
heptamer 12-RSS or the nonamer mutated from
ACAAAAACC to AGGCTCTGA in the mutant nonamer 12-RSS. Each top strand WT or mutant 12-RSS
was annealed to its respective complement by heating to
95°C for 1 min followed by slow cooling to room
temperature.
The sequence of the 16-nt ss DNA substrate is d
(GATATGGCTCGTCTTA). The 16 bp ds DNA substrate was formed by annealing the ss coding flank to its
complement as described above. The sequence of the
32-nt hp substrate is d(GATATGGCTCGTCTTATAAGACGAGCC ATATC). To form the hp substrate, a low
concentration (5 nM) of the oligonucleotide was denatured at 95°C and subsequently quick cooled on ice.
Formation of the annealed intramolecular hp substrate,
as opposed to an intermolecular duplex form, was

Page 15 of 18

confirmed by PAGE prior to each protein:DNA binding
experiment.
EMSA

Each DNA substrate used in EMSA experiments was
radiolabeled at the 5’ end using [g- 32 P]ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase. The top strands of the WT 12RSS and the 16 bp ds DNA substrates were radiolabeled
at the 5’ end, and subsequently annealed to their respective complement. The indicated RAG1 domain was
incubated with 1 nM 32P-labeled DNA substrate at 25°
C. The binding buffer (Buffer A) contained 10 mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol,
and 100 mM NaCl. Reactions were resolved on a discontinuous 3.5%/8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel
as described [65], and analyzed using ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health).
Competition assays were performed under the conditions described above. In these assays, purified MBPCND was incubated in the presence of 1 nM32 P-labeled
WT 12-RSS and 0-500 nM of either unlabeled WT 12RSS or one of the three mutant 12-RSS substrates
described above. Each reaction contained 1.5 μM MBPCND.
Construction of Green Fluorescent Protein Constructs and
Protein Expression in HeLa cells

Constructs encoding GFP-fused to different regions of
RAG1 were produced, which yielded expression of
GFP-core RAG1 (RAG1 residues 384-1008), GFP-CND
(RAG1 residues 87-217), GFP-bZDD (RAG1 residues
218-380), and GFP-CND+bZDD (RAG1 residues 87380). To produce these constructs, PCR products from
the corresponding regions of the RAG1 gene, engineered with SmaI sites at both the 5’ and 3’ ends of
the gene fragment, were sub-cloned 3’ to the GFP gene
in the mammalian expression vector pWAY5 [81].
GFP-full length RAG1 (RAG1 residues 1-1040) was
generated by subcloning the full length RAG1 gene
PCR product in frame with GFP into pAcGFP-C1
(Clontech).
HeLa cells were grown on cover slips in six-well plates
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum.
Each plasmid construct was transfected into cells using
FuGene6 (Roche). Cells transfected with GFP-CND and
GFP-bZDD were washed by PBS at 48 hours following
transfection; whereas cells transfected with GFP-CND
+bZDD were washed by PBS at 24 hours. Subsequently,
the cells were fixed in 2% PFA for 20 minutes at room
temperature. After three washes in PBS, cover-slips were
mounted in UltraCruz mounting medium containing
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Santa Cruz
Biotech).

Fluorescence Microscopy

Fluorescence cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss
LSM-510 META Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy
(Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Cell Imaging
Core Facility). GFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission
wavelengths between 530 and 560 nm were collected for
imaging. FRAP and FLIP measurements were performed
as previously described [69,82]. In brief, for FRAP measurements, a region of nucleus (as indicated) was photobleached using a 29 s pulse of laser illumination.
Recovery of fluorescence signal within the bleached
regions was monitored by collecting a frame every 4 s.
In FLIP experiments, a single spot of the nucleus (as
indicated) was repeatedly photobleached with 5 s pulses
of laser illumination. Each pulse was followed by image
acquisition between consecutive pulses. The same region
was photobleached in each pulse, and photobleaching
and image acquisition repeated until detectable fluorescence signal was extinguished. Image processing and
quantification were performed using iVision (BioVision
Technologies, Exton, PA). Decay constants for GFP
fluorescence signals were analyzed using nonlinear curve
regressions to a single exponential decay.
Bioinformatic Analysis

Phylogenetic Analysis: The Intrepid (http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/INTREPID/index.html) and Conseq
(http://consurf.tau.ac.il/) servers were used to identify
structurally and/or functionally important residues in
the murine RAG1 protein sequence (either non-core
only or full length sequence). Both methods collect and
align homologous sequences of an input sequence,
derive an evolutionary tree, and identify structurally and
functionally important positions based on phylogenetic
relations between sequence homologs [56,57].
Protein Disorder: The Drippred (http://www.sbc.su.se/
~maccallr/disorder/) and Disopred (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.
ac.uk/index.php?id=806) servers were used to predict
structurally disordered regions in murine non-core
RAG1 or full length RAG1. The methods predict
regions of disorder by searching for sequence patterns
that are not typically found in the protein databank or
by sequences that appear in the protein databank
sequence records but with coordinates missing from the
electron density map ([83] and http://www.sbc.su.se/
~maccallr/disorder/).
