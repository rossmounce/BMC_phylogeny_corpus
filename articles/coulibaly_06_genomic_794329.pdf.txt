Abstract
Background: Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) belongs to the superfamily of mitochondrial anion
carriers that dissociate the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis. It has been determined that
UCP2 plays a role in several physiological processes such as energy expenditure, body weight
control and fatty acid metabolism in several vertebrate species. We report the first
characterization of UCP2s in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
Results: Two UCP2 genes were identified in the rainbow trout genome, UCP2A and UCP2B. These
genes are 93% similar in their predicted amino acid sequences and display the same genomic
structure as other vertebrates (8 exons and 7 introns) spanning 4.2 kb and 3.2 kb, respectively.
UCP2A and UCP2B were widely expressed in all tissues of the study with a predominant level in
macrophage-rich tissues and reproductive organs. In fry muscle we observed an increase in UCP2B
expression in response to fasting and a decrease after refeeding in agreement with previous studies
in human, mouse, rat, and marsupials. The converse expression pattern was observed for UCP2A
mRNA which decreased during fasting, suggesting different metabolic roles for UCP2A and UCP2B
in rainbow trout muscle. Phylogenetic analysis including other genes from the UCP core family
located rainbow trout UCP2A and UCP2B with their orthologs and suggested an early divergence
of vertebrate UCPs from a common ancestor gene.
Conclusion: We characterized two UCP2 genes in rainbow trout with similar genomic structures,
amino acid sequences and distribution profiles. These genes appeared to be differentially regulated
in response to fasting and refeeding in fry muscle. The genomic organization and phylogeny analysis
support the hypothesis of a common ancestry between the vertebrate UCPs.

Background
In living cells, most energy is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation. In this process,
the electron flow from reduced substrates to oxygen gen-

erates an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner
membrane. This force drives the proton back into the
matrix and results in ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi.
Uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which are members of the

superfamily of mitochondrial anion-carrier proteins, are
capable of dissipating the proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane to generate heat while reducing
the efficiency of ATP synthesis [1]. The archetypical UCP1
is expressed in brown adipose tissue of mammals and is
involved in non-shivering thermogenesis [2,3]. UCP1
mRNA has been recently found in ectothermic organisms
such as carp, zebrafish and pufferfish [4]. Homologues of
UCP1 (UCP2, 3, 4, 5) have been identified from various
tissues in vertebrates [5-7] and plants [1,8].
UCP2 has been described in previous studies to play a role
in various physiological processes such as body weight
control [9-12], fatty acid metabolism [13,14], control of
reactive oxygen species [15,16], and negative regulation of
insulin secretion [17,18]. No clear thermogenic function
has been identified for UCP2 [19] but increases of muscle
UCP2 mRNA in response to fasting has been reported in
rat [20,21], human [22] and marsupials [23]. UCP2
appeared along with UCP3 to affect energy partitioning,
feed efficiency, body mass index and obesity [6,24].
The present study was designed to characterize UCP2
genes in the rainbow trout and investigate their potential
as candidate genes affecting traits associated with energy
balance and nutrition. To this end, we analyzed the
genomic structure, phylogenetic relationships with other
UCPs, tissue distribution and expression in muscle of
UCP2 in response to fasting.

Results and discussion
Analysis of cDNA and amino acid sequences
We identified two similar tentative consensus sequences
(TC78216 and TC78217) by homology search for UCP2
in the TIGR rainbow trout gene index (RTGI). Both
TC78216 and TC78217 were found to contain full-length
coding sequences from clones tcad0009a.o21 and
tcad0008a.b11, respectively. An additional cDNA clone
(1RT84B23) containing EST CA344639 which is assigned
to TC78216 was also picked, purified and sequenced. Full
sequences
of
tcad0009a.o21,
RT84B23
and
tcad0008a.b11 were deposited to GenBank and assigned
accession numbers [GenBank: DQ295326, DQ295327
and DQ295328].

Similarity analyses between cDNA sequences revealed
that the 1,612-bp 1RT84B23 was 90% identical with
1,455-bp tcad0009a.o21. An 157-bp insert in 1RT84B23
accounted for the 10% difference between both
sequences. The cDNA clone tcad0008a.b11 was 1418 bp
and was 78% and 88% similar to 1RT84B23 and
tcad0009a.o21, respectively. For ease of identification,
tcad0009a.o21 and tcad0008a.b11 were dubbed UCP2A
and UCP2B, respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/203

The deduced amino acid sequences of UCP2A and UCP2B
consist of 304 and 311 amino acid residues, respectively
(Figure 1). The peptide sequence deduced from
1RT84B23 is a truncated form of that obtained from
tcad0009a.o21. The deduced protein, which consisted
only of transmembrane domain I and one proton carrier
signature, most likely lacks the proton dissipation function as it has been demonstrated that the second transmembrane domain of UCP genes is essential for the anion
channel formation [25]. This sequence was therefore discarded from further analysis.
We found 93% similarity between the UCP2A and UCP2B
peptide sequences with both containing six transmembrane domains and three proton carrier signatures which
define the general triplicate structure of mitochondrial
uncoupling proteins [26]. The purine-binding domain
involved in the control of coupling efficiency was also
identified. Over the protein conserved domains rainbow
trout UCP2A and UCP2B diverged only by one aminoacid at position 189 in transmembrane domain IV. The
switch from alanine (UCP2A) to valine (UCP2B) should
not make any difference in the three-dimensional structure of the peptides as these are both hydrophobic amino
acids. On average, both rainbow trout UCP2s showed
83% amino acid similarity with zebrafish UCP2 and 78%
amino acid similarity with human, rat and mouse UCP2s.
UCP2 and UCP3 have been described to be fairly similar
in their peptide sequences and their physiological functions [23,27,28]. Our results showed 69% amino acid
similarity between rainbow trout UCP2s and mammalian
UCP3s.
The identification of two copies of UCP2 genes in rainbow
trout genome is consistent with the ancestral whole
genome duplication [29,30] and re-diploidization of salmonidae species. Several genes and microsatellite loci in
rainbow trout have been previously described to be
present in multiple copies [31,32] and Palti et al. estimated that approximately two-thirds of the rainbow trout
genes remained duplicated [33].
Phylogenetic relationships
We performed a phylogenetic analysis to classify rainbow
trout UCP2A and UCP2B and determine their relationships to UCPs from other species (Figure 2). The tree generated included 27 peptide sequences from the UCP gene
family retrieved from public databases. Trees with similar
topology to that of Figure 2 were drawn when either Minimum Evolution or Unweighted Pair Group algorithms
were performed. Both rainbow trout UCP2 duplicates
were grouped together with their UCP2 orthologs in the
same clade. Fish (D. rerio, C. carpio and O. mykiss) and
frog UCP2 peptides were assigned to a specific cluster,
with a high bootstrap (87%), as opposed to mammalian

rat [GenBank: AB006614] obtained using the ClustalW sequence alignment program and illustrated with Genedoc 2.6 [68].
Sequences are presented in single letter code. Gaps, illustrated with a dash, are introduced into sequences to optimize alignment score. Most conserved amino acids are highlighted in black, less conserved ones being in decreasing gray background.
Potential transmembrane conserved α-helices domains are boxed and numbered in roman numerals. Proton carrier signatures

UCP2 genes. Our data showed a close relationship
between UCP2 and UCP3 in agreement with previous
expression patterns and amino acid sequence similarity
suggesting that UCP2 and UCP3 are paralogs [23,27,28].
Moreover both genes have been mapped on the same
chromosome in endothermic vertebrates such as human,
bovine, porcine and mouse [34-37] and more recently the
same evidence was found in ectothermic vertebrates like
zebrafish. [4].

consisted of UCP2B-containing BACs. Two representative
BACs were selected from each contig for direct sequencing. Two BAC clones, 243P06 and 398G03, were selected
from C1 and C3 for further analysis based on their
sequence similarities with cDNA clones tcad0009a.o21
(UCP2A) and tcad0008a.b11 (UCP2B), respectively.
Genomic sequences for UCP2A and UCP2B genomic
sequences have been deposited at NCBI [GenBank:
DQ295324, DQ295325].

Overall, UCP genes were clustered in three major
branches at 100% bootstrap value leading to three groups
consisting of UCP1-3, UCP-4 and UCP-5. We suggest an
early divergence of the UCP family gene into three major
clades in agreement with the phylogeny described by
Sokolova and Sokolov [38]. These authors also demonstrated that this subdivision could be correlated with a
functional specialization among the UCP superfamily.

Alignment between cDNA and BAC genomic sequences
revealed the exon-intron structures of UCP2A and UCP2B
(Figure 3). In each alignment a TATA box was identified
on genomic DNA 47 and 45 bp upstream of the 5'end of
UCP2A and UCP2B, respectively. UCP2A and UCP2B span
4.2 kb and 3.2 kb, respectively. Both rainbow trout UCP2s
contain 8 exons and 7 introns. Coding sequences for both
genes covered 6 exons as described for mammalian UCP1
[39], UCP2 [40,41] and UCP3 [42] and each exon encodes
one transmembrane domain of the protein. The analysis
of genomic structure showed that 1RT84B23 is a splice
variant of tcad0009a.o21. Exon 4 was 157-bp longer and
intron 3 was subsequently 157-bp shorter in 1RT84B23
than in tcad0009a.o21 (Figure 3). Exon 4 of 1RT84B23 is
not fully translated as a stop codon is encountered in the
first 15 nucleotides. In human where UCP2 has been well

Genomic organization of rainbow trout UCP2
We identified 32 total BAC clones putatively containing
an UCP2 gene of which 16 where specific to UCP2A and
16 were specific to UCP2B. After fingerprinting, most of
these BAC clones were assembled into three contigs C1,
C2 and C3 containing 12, 7 and 2 clones, respectively. C1
consisted of UCP2A-containing BACs while C2 and C3

characterized, SNP and insertion/deletion variants of the
gene were identified [43-45] and no alternative splice variants have been reported to date.
Similarity between UCP2A and UCP2B was low in the
introns with 60% similarity on average while the average
similarity in the exon sequences was 86%. The number
and the size of the exons and introns of rainbow trout,
human, mouse and zebrafish UCP2s are represented in
Table 2. The number of exons was identical in these vertebrate organisms although exon lengths were observed to
be somewhat variable. Translated exons 4, 5, 6 and 7 were
the most conserved in size between species and within
rainbow trout. Exon 7 had the same size in all species.
These translated exons showed 93% average sequence
similarity between rainbow trout UCP2A and UCP2B
while untranslated exons were 79% identical. Mutations
apparently occur at a slower rate in the coding region than
in the untranslated region of duplicated genes. These
results show conservation of the structure of UCP2 genes

coding exons within vertebrates confirming the hypothesis of a common ancestry for UCP genes.
We examined introns 1 and 2, untranslated exons 1, 2,
untranslated part of exon 3 and approximately 300 bp of
genomic sequence upstream of each gene's transcription
initiation site as the putative promoter regions. This represented 1.6 and 1.3 kb-long sequence upstream of the
translation-initiation site (ATG) of UCP2A and UCP2B,
respectively. Similarity was 59% between overlaps suggesting differentiation between regulatory regions of
UCP2A and UCP2B. The promoter regions of rainbow
trout UCP2A and UCP2B, and the upstream non-coding
sequences identified in human (4.5 kb), mouse (3.5 kb)
and zebrafish (3.0 kb) UCP2 were searched for regulatory
element binding sites using the TFSearch engine version
1.3. The results for ten transcription factors frequently
identified are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The identification of regulatory conserved motifs upstream of the five
genes is consistent with the phylogenetic relationships

previously described between the UCP2 genes in human,
mouse, zebrafish and rainbow trout. The binding sites of
ADR1, CAP, CdxA and HSF were identified in upstream
region of all five genes although at different frequency.
AML1a (acute myeloid leukemia), MZF (Myeloid zinc finger protein 42) USF (Upstream Stimulatory Transcription
Factor) binding sites were identified in mouse and human
sequences and absent in fish (rainbow trout, zebrafish).
Among the fish UCP2 genes, the rainbow trout UCP2A
regulatory region appeared to be the most unique with
almost half of the binding motifs identified in UCP2B and
zebrafish UCP2. Among the regulatory motifs we identified for UCP2 genes, USF and CREB have been shown to
regulate the expression of UCP2 and UCP1, respectively
[47,48]. Our results suggest, in agreement with previous
data in the literature [49,50], that some transcription factor binding sites are conserved across species while others
are not.

Tissue distribution and response to fasting
The distribution of relative expression of rainbow trout
UCP2A and UCP2B was investigated on a panel of 23 tissues from adult fish (Figure 4). Both UCP2A and UCP2B
genes appeared ubiquitously expressed in the body as
described in marsupials [23], human [6,46], carp [4] and
mouse [7] making the genes likely to influence several
physiological processes. The highest relative expression
was observed in ovary, peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL),
gill, testis, spleen and trunk kidney. In all these tissues
except ovary, UCP2B mRNA relative amounts were at least
twice that of UCP2A. In brain, fat, pituitary and red blood
cells, UCP2A mRNA was more abundant than UCP2B
mRNA. High amounts of UCP2 mRNAs in reproductive
organs and in tissues rich in macrophages like PBLs,
spleen, and kidney have been reported in several studies.
Arsenijevic et al. [51] and Kizaki et al. [52] suggested a role
for UCP2 in immunity or inflammatory responsiveness

through the regulation of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. In mouse ovary, UCP2 mRNA levels have been
described to increase during ovulation as a result of the
increasing number of macrophages and neutrophils [53].
In trout, ovaries in maturation are characterized by the
presence of many macrophages inside the cytoplasm of
the oocytes [54]. The ovaries used in our tissue distribution panel were developing. Therefore, we suggest the
high amount of UCP2 mRNA in trout ovary could be due
to the macrophage-rich developmental stage of the tissue
used.
The initial average weight of the fish used in the current
study was 231 mg (225 for the fed group and 236 for the
fasted group). Following day 14, the fed fish weighed 475
mg and the fasted fish were 167 mg. At day 21 of fasting,
termination of the fasted group, the average weight of the
fish was 661 mg, 171 mg and 239 mg for the fed, fasted
and refed groups, respectively. Rainbow trout UCP2A and
UCP2B were differentially expressed in response to fasting
and refeeding in fry (Figure 5). UCP2A mRNA expression
was similar between all groups at the beginning of the
experiment. Three days after food deprivation, UCP2A
expression was three times higher in fed fish than in fasted
fish. The amount of gene expression remained significantly higher in fed fish than in fasted fish until day 21 of
the experiment. Refeeding of fasted animals started at day
14 and resulted in a 2-fold increase of UCP2A at day 21.
At day 28, refed and fed fish had the same amount of
UCP2A expression.
At day 0, UCP2B expression is similar in all fry. At day 3,
expression was 3-fold augmented in fasted fish while no
significant increase was found in the fed fish. UCP2B
expression drastically decreased in fasted fish to the level
observed in fed fish at day 7 before a significant increase
was observed again at day 14. At days 14 and 21, UCP2B
was expressed higher in fasted fry than in fed fry. In fed
animals, no significant differences were noted between
UCP2B expression levels throughout the experiment,
except at day 17. Refed fish showed the same level of
expression of the gene as the fasted fish at day 14. UCP2B

-1268; -872
-1281; -1260; -947; -490; -473; -119

expression then decreased in refed fish to reach the same
level expressed in fed animals at days 21 and 28. The
expression pattern of UCP2B in response to fasting is consistent with what has been described for other species in
the literature. The food deprivation induced-increase in
mRNA expression is one of the most spectacular features
of UCP2 and UCP3 in rodent and human [20-22,55-58].
The hypothesis is that during fasting when glucose is limiting, upregulation of muscle UCP2 is associated with the
shift in muscle substrate utilization primarily towards
lipid. On refeeding with a low-fat diet, UCP2 is down regulated allowing the re-use of glucose as major substrate. It
has been also demonstrated that a high-fat diet induces
up-regulation of UCP2 and UCP3 thus promoting fat utilization over storage [55,57]. The actual mechanism of
UCP involvement in fatty acid metabolism is not yet fully
understood, but Samec et al. [56] established a close relationship between expression of UCP2 and UCP3 and
well-known key regulators of lipid oxidation. Our study,
unlike most of experiments in the literature, monitored
UCP2 mRNA levels for a relatively long fasting time (four
weeks). Our results suggest that increase of UCP2B mRNA
is maintained during the whole fasting time, although the
higher expression is detected early.
The overall amount of expression of UCP2B genes in fry
muscle were much lower than what we observed for
UCP2A. Five times more cDNA was included in Real-time
PCR for UCP2B primers than was used for UCP2A to
detect readable amplification signals. As a result, the highest detected amount of UCP2B gene EF1-normalized
expression is 0.023 compared with that of UCP2A which
was 18.81. In adult fish, as described above UCP2B mRNA
expression was much higher relatively to UCP2A mRNA in
some of the tissues. In light of the expression data in
response to fasting, UCP2B is likely the homolog of the
UCP2 described in other vertebrates. UCP2A is a duplicate
form of the gene that has undergone a different evolutionary process leading to a different expression pattern. This
is illustrated by the sequence divergence and different cisregulatory elements identified in the promoter regions of
both genes. Further functional characterization of the pro-

moter region and identification of regulatory motifs could
help address the differences between mRNA expression of
UCP2A and UCP2B.

Conclusion
We have identified two UCP2 genes in rainbow trout.
Both genes were highly similar at the amino acid level and
widely expressed in the body. Analyses of the genomic
organization and phylogeny data based on protein
sequence similarity suggest a close relationship between
members of the UCP superfamily. In rainbow trout fry
UCP2A and UCP2B appeared downregulated and upregulated on fasting, respectively. Further characterization of
both genes in different physiological and dietary conditions, and developmental stages will assist in better testing
and understanding hypothesis related to their specific
functions and differentiation.

Methods
Search for rainbow trout UCP2 cDNA
UCP2 sequences from human, mouse and zebrafish UCP2
mRNAs [GenBank: NM_003355.2, NM_011671.2,
NM_131176.1] were T-BLASTed against the Rainbow
Trout Gene Index [59] to identify putative orthologues
from rainbow trout [60].
Identification and fingerprinting of UCP2 gene-containing BAC clones
Gene specific primers were designed from putative rainbow trout UCP2 cDNAs identified by homology searches
for screening of the NCCCWA Swanson 10× bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library [26] PCR pools according to the manufacturer's directions (Amplicon Express,
Pullman, WA). Two sets of primers were designed to
screen the BAC library, forward 5'-CACCATGGTGCGTACAGAG-3' and reverse 5'-TTGGGATGGTCTTGTAGG-3';

and forward 5'-TTTATCGGTGCTGGAACAGC-3' and
reverse 5'-TAAGAAGCGCGTCCTTGATG-3'. Primer specificities were checked by alignment between cDNAs and by
BLAST against NCBI databases.
BACs identified as positive for UCP2 genes were fingerprinted using HindIII to identify sets of overlapping
clones as previously described [33]. BAC DNA was
obtained using the Qiagen Large Construct Kit protocol.
Following digestion and electrophoresis, gel images were
captured using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 9210 Variable Mode Imager and exported as TIF files. Banding patterns were analyzed using Image 3.10b and FPC
(Fingerprinted Contigs) V6 software [61] to assemble
overlapping BACs into contigs [62].
Sequence analysis
DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye® Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI3100 automatic
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA
and genomic sequences were obtained by primer walking.
Sequences were analyzed using the Sequencher 4.1.4 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Exon-intron boundaries were identified by locating 5'
donor GT and 3' acceptor AG consensus sequences in a
cDNA-genomic DNA gap alignment.

Genomic sequence upstream of the rainbow trout UCP2
gene was obtained in order to perform a computational
prediction of cis-acting transcription factor binding sites
using the TFSearch engine [63] that uses the TRANSFAC
databases. Also for each human, mouse and zebrafish, we
downloaded the genomic and mRNA sequences from
GenBank and aligned them to retrieve the gene structure
and locate the translation-initiation site. The upstream
sequences including 300 bp upstream on the genomic
sequence were then selected for the prediction of transcription factors binding sites. The identifiers of human,
mouse and zebrafish UCP2 genomic sequence obtained
NT_039433,
are
[GenBank:
NC_000011.8,
NC_007116.1], respectively. Sequence obtained for promoter analysis was located on human chromosome
11q13 (73,363,064-73,367,806), on mouse chromosome
region 7E2 (18,239,174-18,242,911) and zebrafish chromosome 5 (60,833,577-60,836,877).
Experiment design and tissue collection
Experiments were conducted on rainbow trout fry
hatched at the National Center for Cool and Cold Water
Aquaculture (Leetown, WV). Thirty three fish at 32 days
post-hatching (dph) were placed into each of 18 × 2 4L
buckets. The buckets were supplied with flow-through
oxygen saturated well water at 12.5 + 0.2°C, and a photoperiod of 12 h light -12 h dark. Fish were fed a commercial diet, Finfish Starter Meal, (57% protein and 15% fat;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/203

Ziegler Bros. Inc., Gardner PA) at 2% body weight daily.
Fish were divided into three treatment groups: 1) fed fish
as controls, 2) fasted fish, and 3) fish fasted the first 14
days of the experiment and re-fed thereafter. The experiment was initiated 37 dph, shortly after the completion of
yolk-sac absorption. Muscle tissues were collected on days
0, 3, 7, 14, 17, 21 and 28 of the experiment. Each tank was
only sampled once and fish from two tanks for each treatment were sampled. At sampling, fish were anesthetized
with 200 mg/L Tricaine and mixed fiber type muscle pools
from four individuals were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction. All animal handling and sampling procedures
were reviewed and approved by the NCCCWA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tissues were collected from branchial arch, brain, eye, fat,
gill, heart, intestines, liver, ovary, pancreas, peripheral
blood leukocytes, red and white muscles, pituitary,
pyloric ceca, red blood cells, skin, spleen, stomach and
testis on healthy 2-year old adult fish (approximately 1 kg
in mass) for the survey of UCP2 mRNA expression in the
rainbow trout body.
RNA isolation and first strand cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent (Sigma, St
Louis, Missouri) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was precipitated in ethanol, washed and
dissolved in nuclease-free water. RNA was treated with
DNAse to eliminate genomic DNA contamination and reextracted using Tri-reagent. RNA concentrations were estimated by spectrophotometry and integrity was checked
on agarose gels. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed in a 40 µl reaction volume containing 2 µg total
RNA, 1 µg of Random Hexamer primers, 1× M-MLV reaction buffer, 500 µM of dNTPs, 200 units of M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, Madison, USA) and 25 units
Recombinant Rnasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega,
Madison, USA). The mix was incubated at 37°C for 60
min with a final denaturation at 95°C for 5 min. Reactions were stored at -20°C until further use.
Real-time PCR
Specific forward and reverse primers were designed for
each target and reference gene cDNA (Table 1) on the
boundary of two consecutive exons or in intron flanking
regions to prevent amplification of contaminating
genomic DNA or to make it detectable on a gel. Either
way, amplicons were run on gel to confirm their uniqueness and size expectation prior to real-time PCR runs.
Real-time PCR was performed in a 15 µl reaction volume
containing 1 µl of cDNA template, 250 nM of each forward and reverse primers and 7.5 µl of SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Amplifications were performed on the ABI PRISM 7900

Sequence Detection System real-time cycler using the following program: 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 15 s, 40
cycles of 95°C for 15s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30s and a
dissociation stage at 95°C for 15s, 60°C for 15 s and 95°C
for 15s. Dissociation curves were analyzed to detect nonspecific amplification. Non-template controls were
included in each run and checked for no amplification.
The amount of transcript in each sample was quantified
using the standard curve method [65]. The standard curve
was constructed using 10 dilutions (1 to 1/1000) of a pool
of cDNA. Gene expression in tissues was rendered as a
ratio of target gene versus rainbow trout Elongation Factor1α (EF1-α, GenBank Accession Number AF498320.1) as
reference gene. We surveyed EF1-α, β-actin, TATA box
Binding protein a (TBP-a) and 18S rRNA as potential internal control genes for RT-PCR (data not shown). Of the
housekeeping genes tested, EF1-α demonstrated the most
consistent Ct values between treatments (average 23.7 ±
1.1). EF1-α has been previously demonstrated to be a reliable housekeeper in several tissues of Atlantic salmon
[64].

The experiments performed in this study comply with the current USA
laws. Mention of trade names or commercial products in this publication is

The real time PCR mRNA expression data were analyzed
using the Statistica software version 6 (StatSoft. Inc.,
Tulsa, OK, USA). Differences in UCP2 mRNA expression
between treatments were assessed at each time point using
the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. A pair wise post
hoc comparison of means was performed when difference
between treatments was significant at the 0.05 threshold.

Phylogenetic inference
Twenty seven UCP peptide sequences were identified and
retrieved from public databases using keywords and
BLAST searches. Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using Clustal W [66]. Sequence alignments were
used as an input file to construct a consensus phylogenetic
tree by the neighbor joining method using MEGA version
3 [67]. Reliability of tree was assessed by bootstrapping
using 1,000 random replications.
