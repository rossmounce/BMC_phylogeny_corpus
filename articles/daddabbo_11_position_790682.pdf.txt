Position and sequence conservation in Amniota
of polymorphic enhancer HS1.2 within the
palindrome of IgH 3’Regulatory Region

Abstract
Background: The Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) 3’ Regulatory Region (3’RR), located at the 3’ of the constant
alpha gene, plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin production. In humans, there are 2 copies of the 3’RR, each
composed of 4 main elements: 3 enhancers and a 20 bp tandem repeat. The single mouse 3’RR differs from the
two human ones for the presence of 4 more regulative elements with the double copy of one enhancer at the
border of a palindromic region.
Results: We compared the 3’RR organization in genomes of vertebrates to depict the evolutionary history of the
region and highlight its shared features. We found that in the 8 species in which the whole region was included in
a fully assembled contig (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, panda, orangutan, chimpanzee, and human), the shared elements
showed synteny and a highly conserved sequence, thus suggesting a strong evolutionary constraint. In these
species, the wide 3’RR (~30 kb in human) bears a large palindromic sequence, consisting in two ~3 kb
complementary branches spaced by a ~3 kb sequence always including the HS1.2 enhancer. In mouse and rat,
HS3 is involved by the palindrome so that one copy of the enhancer is present on each side. A second relevant
feature of our present work concerns human polymorphism of the HS1.2 enhancer, associated to immune diseases
in our species. We detected a similar polymorphism in all the studied Catarrhini (a primate parvorder). The
polymorphism consists of multiple copies of a 40 bp element up to 12 in chimpanzees, 8 in baboons, 6 in
macaque, 5 in gibbons, 4 in humans and orangutan, separated by stretches of Cytosine. We show specific binding
of this element to nuclear factors.
Conclusions: The nucleotide sequence of the palindrome is not conserved among evolutionary distant species,
suggesting pressures for the maintenance of two self-matching regions driving a three-dimensional structure
despite of the inter-specific divergence at sequence level. The information about the conservation of the
palindromic structure and the settling in primates of the polymorphic feature of HS1.2 show the relevance of these
structures in the control and modulation of the Ig production through the formation of possible three-dimensional
structures.

Background
The immunoglobulin genes appeared, during evolution,
in vertebrates. Because of their increasing physiological
relevance, the evolution of these genes in fish, amphibian, birds and mammals witnessed several series of
duplications that ended in adding copies and complexity
to these genes. The class switch, in particular, was of

importance in producing diversity [1], and constituted a
crucial step in B cell maturation [2]. The region
involved by the somatic rearrangements, allowing the
class switch, is the Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
locus. This domain is in a single copy in the genome of
most extant species (as example, see the mouse locus in
Figure 1A). Hominoidea (human, chimpanzee, gorilla
and gibbon) are an exception, because the constant
genes of the IgH locus underwent duplication in their
common ancestor [3]. Studies in humans have shown
that the duplication of the IgH locus included the

Figure 1 Schematic map of the mouse and human IgH genetic
cluster. The IgH cluster and the closest genes (dark blue) are highly
conserved in the mouse and human chromosomes. The same
transcription direction was also detected in both species, with a
“telomere towards centromere” transcription versus. The mouse IgH
cluster harbors 8 constant genes and one copy of the 3’ Regulatory
Region (3’RR) with 7 enhancers, 3 of them (HS5, HS6, HS7) with
possible insulator function at the 3’ boundary of the cluster. The
human IgH region has some differences for the constant genes
since a wide duplication of gamma, epsilon and alpha genes
occurred in the ancestor of Hominoidea. This duplication included
also the 3’RR at the 3’ of the constant alpha gene. Both the two
copies of the 3’RR in humans have just three enhancers. In fact, the
human loci do not harbor both the duplicated HS3.B enhancer and
the insulators present in the mouse locus.

Regulatory Region (3’RR) located immediately downstream of the constant alpha exons [2]. Portions of the
3’RR were first cloned in 1990 and 1991 [4,5] but only
later were fully assembled as a complete contig sequence
because they are repeats-rich unstable regions, moreover
containing palindromic sequences [6,7]. In humans, the
2 copies of this 3’ Regulatory Region (3’RR) have been
reported as 3’RR1 and 3’RR2 (Figure 1B) [8]. Each
human 3’RR copy harbors three different enhancers.
The mouse and rat 3’RR possess 4 more boundary regulatory regions instead. Their existence in other organisms may be hypothesized but have not been
demonstrated yet [2] (Figure 1A).
The 3’RR has a crucial role in recruiting transcription
factors for the initiation of germ line transcription of
the constant genes to induce IgH switch [9]. The role of
the 3’RR enhancers was studied with mice transgenic for
the c-myc translocation, showing the active role of HS3.
B and HS4 in peripheral B-cell lymphomas progression
and not in pro-B lymphomas [10,11]. Relevant studies
demonstrate by chromosome conformation capture
techniques the presence of a three-dimensional structure
originated by a loop among Regulatory Regions during
class switch recombination [12]. New studies on 3’RR
transgenic deleted mice report impairment of class
switch and Ig expression [13,14]. Activation of the
mouse 3’RR begins with selective demethylation of

enhancers [15]. Binding sites variation affecting the
enhancers sequence can lead to different epigenetic
changes and bring cells to differently act. In our recently
performed population studies we found, in fact, that
some of the 3’RR enhancer HS1.2 variants (Figure 2)
were associated to a higher risk for autoimmune diseases onset and other immune-disorders as IgA defect,
systemic sclerodermia, Rheumatic arthritis, Psoriasis and
Celiac disease [16-20]. We hypothesized that the cause
was a change of a binding consensus for NF-B and
other transcription factors as “in silico“ predicted or
experimentally determined [16,21]. In humans the presence of an allele with the NF-B consensus site was
associated to increased haematic concentration of IgM,
suggesting a contribution to the mechanism of class
switch [16,17].
Little is known on the presence and organization of
the 3’RR in Amniota other than human and mouse
[22,23]. Comparative studies of this regulatory region
can provide hypotheses on which elements are crucial
with respect to their function [24]. To fill the gap, we
investigated the genomic organization of this region taking advantage of the sequence data present in GenBank
and Trace Archive (see Methods below). The most relevant achievement of the analysis was the discovering
that the palindrome surrounding the HS1.2 enhancer is
present in every mammal species for which enough
sequence data were available. This finding has important
implication on the understanding of HS1.2 functioning.
In addition, our data supports the view that HS1.2 polymorphisms are widely spread in the primate parvorder
of Catarrhini (Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea). The
improvement on the comparative studies on the non
coding genome is a relevant task for new insight in the
epigenetic and mechanisms of genome regulation [25].

Results
3’RR genomic organization

The mouse 3’RR region contains 7 enhancers (HS3.AHS1.2-HS3.B-HS4-HS5-HS6-HS7), while human has
only three enhancers (Figure 1). For this reason the
mouse was used as the reference genome for the preliminary analysis. The IgA class exons are the transcripted sequence closest to the 3’RR, so we included a
portion of this DNA in our analysis. It is to keep in
mind that the IgA was the last class to appear during
the evolution of IgH, because it is just shared among
Amniota species (reptiles, bird and mammals) [26].
Finally, we surveyed also a satellite repeat. This is a conserved stretch of DNA (812 bp in human) composed of
tandemly repeated 20 bp element and located inside the
3’UTR of the IgA gene, close to the 3’RR enhancer.

Figure 2 The polymorphisms of the human enhancer HS1.2. (A) The schematic representation of the human alleles shows the different
invariant and variable elements. Up to now 6 different alleles are reported in GenBank, each one identified for the number of copies (*1, *2, *3,
*4) of the 40 bp element (40 mer, in yellow). More variability was added by the presence of either a short stretch of cytosines (18 bp, in green)
or a different larger element (29 bp, in red) between the enhancer core (in fuchsia) and the first 40 mer. The 3’ end of the enhancer (in light
blue) also is highly conserved. The green stretches of cytosines parting the 40 mer ranged between 12 and 18 bp. (B) The sequence alignment
of four alleles of HS1.2 enhancer sequences colored according to the schematic elements reported in the upper part. The binding for the Oct1,
Sp1 and NF-B factors are reported on the sequence as determined by EMSA experiments.

between mouse and each one of 19 Amniota genomes
(rat, guinea pig, rabbit, human, chimp, orangutan, rhesus, marmoset, panda, dog, cat, horse, elephant, cow,
pig, opossum, platypus, lizard, chicken). Some of these
assemblies, human and mouse in particular, are very
accurate. At the contrary some others are based on relatively low sequence coverage, with several unresolved
gaps. This peculiar consideration has to be kept in mind
when dealing with negative results of sequences comparison among genomes drafts.
Results of our search for the mouse 3’RR main elements in Amniota genomes are summarized in Figure 3.
The full set of elements present in mouse (IgH alpha
exons, 20 bp tandem repeat and 7 enhancers) was
detected only in the rat genome. The HS5, HS6, and
HS7 were always absent in all the remaining species.
The HS3, HS1.2, and HS4 set was detected with
certainty in mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, panda, human,

chimpanzee, and orangutan. HS3 and the 20 bp repeat,
were present in 12 mammals, but were undetected in
cow, elephant, opossum, and platypus. The region
delimited by the alpha exons and HS3.A enhancer and
encompassing the 20 bp repeat, appeared to be highly
conserved in placental mammals. We remark that, at
the contrary, the Alpha marker remains entirely undetected in chicken and pig, because the similarity versus
rodent IgA is low even at the level of peptide sequence.
As expected, the search in the Neanderthal genome
[27] by inspection of related track in the UCSC human
genome browser demonstrated that HS3, HS1.2 and
HS4 were also present in the genome of our extinct
relative (data not shown).

Dot plot analysis of the 3’RR

Figure 3 Contig sequence alignment of the 3’RR of vertebrate
species with completed genome sequence. This figure shows the
region chr12:114,459,657-114,497,890 of the UCSC Mouse Genome
Browser (mm9 draft). The comparative genomic tracks were
inspected and the graphic was edited as in this figure. The species
common names are listed in the first column on the left. The black
blocks in the “Mouse main elements” section localize the positions
of the chosen tags, mapped by the BLAT tool of the site. The
colored blocks in the “Comparative Genomics” section show the
most similar region in each genome of the species listed, versus the
mouse genome. The color of each block represents a portion of a
chromosome (see the chromosome color legend below the
graphic) of the species similar to that portion of the mouse
chromosome 12. The “RepeatMasker” and “Tandem Repeat Finder”
sections show the position of repeats identified by the two
homonymous algorithms in this portion of mouse genome.

match, even though it is expected. These missing
sequences, however, can be present in the shot-gun
sequences databases, as unassembled short sequences.
We searched in GenBank genome-related databases, by
BLAST, for the presence of murine (data not shown)
and human IgH alpha exons (Table 1). Querying for this
transcripted sequence, we tested the method limits. All
the 35 positive species were mammals (8 primates).
Then we BLASTed the murine (data not shown) and
human (Table 1) enhancers against the same positive
databases. The analysis showed that at least one 3’RR
enhancer was present in 23 species, while all the three
enhancers were present in only 8 species (in bold in
Table 1), apart from human. The negative findings may
be ascribed either to the non-completeness of the available genomic drafts/wgs/htgs databases or to an actual
sequences divergence. It is worth noting that the longer
map distance between the 3’RR features and the IgA
gene, the less species detected (Table 1). Finally, the
analysis confirmed that the mouse HS5, HS6, and HS7
were detectable by sequence similarity only in rat (data
not shown).

It has been already reported, in man and mouse, that
each HS1.2 enhancer is flanked, at some distance on
both sides, by a 3 kb segment, and that these segments
are in opposite orientation (palindromic), as evident
from the dot plot analysis reported in Figure 4 (palindromic sequence in light blue). Very interestingly, we
found that this organization is shared by 8 species in
which the whole region was included in a fully
assembled contig. The human versus non-primate dotplots are reported in Figure 5. It is worth noting that,
while the similarity between the two components of the
same palindrome is always very high (94% in human,
Figure 4), the sequence itself almost completely varied
among species (Figure 5). Interestingly, HS1.2 always
lies in the center of the palindrome. In the human 3’
RR1, the region internal to the two components of the
palindrome is inversely oriented with respect to the corresponding sequence of 3’RR2, as shown by the secondary diagonal line present at the core of the light blue
frame (Figure 4). In addition, sequence comparisons of
the human 3’RRs with non-primate mammals harboring
a single copy of 3’RR (panda, rabbit, mouse, and dog)
showed that in 3 of them, with the exception of the
mouse, the orientation of the region internal to the
palindrome (containing the HS1.2) was identical to the
human 3’RR2 (Figure 5). This finding suggests that the
3’RR2 is ancestral with respect to the 3’RR1. The mouse
showed an opposite orientation of the region internal to
the palindrome. Moreover the mouse palindrome is larger than the human one, including the HS3 and the 20
bp repeat, thus originating HS3.A and HS3.B (Figure 5).
Very likely, an inversion event was triggered by the
palindrome both in the mouse 3’RR and in the human
3’RR1.
HS1.2 enhancer in Trace Archive

While no polymorphisms have been reported for the
enhancers HS3 and HS4 [28], the 2 human HS1.2 copies
share a set of variant forms (Figure 2) [21,29]. The main
polymorphic feature of human HS1.2 consists of a tandem repeated pair of elements, i.e. a 40 bp sequence (40
mer, yellow boxes in Figure 2) and a ~15 bp cytosinerich stretch (green boxes), that can or cannot be separated from the enhancer core (purple boxes) by a 29 bp
sequence (red boxes). The HS1.2 human variants with
more copies of the 40 mer showed an increasing effect
on the transcription of a reporter gene in transfected
cells [30]. In mouse there is just one copy of HS1.2 that
constantly harbors a single copy of the 40 mer.
The Trace Archive databases of primate species
sequences was searched by BLAST using the human
HS1.2 sequence as query, to investigate the evolutionary
history of this enhancer and to search for potential

along with all the available data from previous works [21]
and from our previously unpublished sequencing data.
This figure shows the organization of the HS1.2 in the different species. The highly conserved core of the enhancer
(113 bp, purple) is constantly flanked, in the 11 nonprimate mammalian species (olive green background), by
a partial 29 mer stretch (red element). The 102 bp terminal element (blue in Figure 6), constantly found in

primates, was entirely detected only in panda when
searched in non-primate mammals.
The most interesting finding of this analysis is the
presence of a variable number of copies of the 40 mer
(yellow in Figure 6) in all Catarrhini parvorder species,
i.e. in both Hominoidea and Cercopithecoidea superfamilies. On the contrary, the duplication of the whole
locus of the constant genes was found only in Hominoidea [3]. This observation strongly suggests that the

and the palindromic structure encompassing the enhancer HS1.2 (light blue frame). Each portion of the palindrome is extended for ~3 kb. The
black squares of spots indicate the presence of short stretches of DNA satellite tandem repeat. The two HS1.2 enhancers have inverted
orientation in the two 3’RR as a result of the inverted orientation of the sequence internal to the palindrome. The orientation of the other
enhancers is conserved and also the distances. The 20 bp repeat in dark blue appears to be larger in the 3’RR1.

emergence of the polymorphism occurred earlier with
respect to the duplication. The number of the 40 mer
varies from the 12 copies found in chimpanzee HS1.2,
to a single one, as detected in some alleles in human,
chimpanzee, and gorilla and in all the non-primate
mammals. An additional variability found in Hominoidea is the occasional absence of the 29 mer, replaced by
an 18 bp stretch of cytosine (green in Figure 6).
HS1.2 Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS)

All the HS1.2 forms found in the different species
(Figure 6) were searched for transcription factor binding
sites, using Alibaba2 software. Relevant results are summarized in Additional file 1 (full list in Additional file 2).
Four TFBS (C/EBPalp, AP-2alpha, SP1, Oct1) are present
in all the analyzed species; moreover, the NF variants are
almost ubiquitous. The Additional file 1 clearly indicates
that, while the number of C/EBPalp and Oct1 TFBS is
substantially constant in different HS1.2 forms, the number of AP-2alpha and SP1 TFBS is proportional to the
copies of the 40 mer present in that specific HS1.2 form.
Note that c-myc containing 40 mers appears only in the
Catarrhini HS1.2 forms and in dog.
Phylogenetic analysis

The four structures clustered in the 3’RR were analyzed
for their sequence variation in 9 species comprising

human, gorilla, orangutan, mouse, rat, rabbit, panda,
dog and cat (see Additional file 3). The phylogenetic
analysis obtained with the maximum likelihood method
for C-alpha, HS3, HS1.2 and HS4 (Figure 7A, B, C and
7D respectively), showed in all cases a similar variation
from the standard reconstruction of mammals’ phylogeny. Rodents and lagomorphs diverged from each other
and from primates and carnivores, confirming at the
nucleotide level the hypothesis of different evolutionary
routes taken from the different groups, as shown after
structural analysis. The concordance between the coding
region (C-alpha) and the three enhancers in the
observed divergence furthermore indicates that similar
forces shaped the evolution of the whole 3’ regulatory
region, suggesting potential functional constrains also
for the non coding sections.

Discussion
In the present article we have compared the genomic
structure of the 3’RR domain of the IgH gene cluster in
various species. We have confirmed that in all the analyzed species the 3’RR elements order is largely maintained. Two main results were also achieved: (i) a
palindromic structured sequence flanks each HS1.2
enhancer; (ii) HS1.2 is polymorphic in all analyzed Catarrhini species and therefore rose before of the IgH
locus duplication.

Figure 5 Dot plot of the human 3’RR-2 against 4 species. The comparison of the human regulatory region against the homologous
sequences of Ailuropoda melanoleuca (panda), Canis familiaris (dog), Mus musculus (mouse) and Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit) shows the
conservation of the enhancer positions and the high similarity in the sequence spanning from the alpha gene to the other extreme enhancer
HS4. In the mouse the two copies of the enhancer HS3 A and B have in the neighbor region also the 20 bp repeat. In the mouse palindrome
(light blue frame) are shown by the black segments with inverted orientation three copies of a region that is in two copies in humans. The
wider extension of the palindrome in mouse includes the two HS3 enhancers on the boundaries. The same structures are conserved along the
homologues 3’RR in these species and the palindrome is present in the cluster of all species as evidenced by the pale blue rectangle with the
central region represented by the HS1.2 enhancer. The black lines depict the internal repeats present in more than one copy. The lines when
parallel to the major diagonal have the same orientation, when are perpendicular have inverted orientation, as in the palindrome sequence.

Figure 6 Representation of the HS1.2 variants in 20 different species. The alignment of the HS1.2 enhancer clones of the different species
is shown by schematic representation. The conserved elements from the 5’ towards the 3’ are: the core constant part of the enhancer (fuchsia),
the 29 mer sequence (red), the 40 mer (yellow), the stretch of cytosines (green), and the 3’ end region (light blue) (see also Figure 2). The
number of 40 mer copies appears variable in most of the primates. In these species the alleles with different number of the 40 mer can harbor
either the 29 mer or the cytosine stretch between the core and the first 40 mer. Alleles with the 29 mer are present in the major part of the
species. We found only clones with the cytosine stretch at the place of the 29 mer just in Gorilla. The identification number (ID) of each
sequence is reported in the second column: the ID including a letter can be found in GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/, the others
in the Trace Archive database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi. The bold characters are used to indicate sequences obtained in our
laboratory.

Palindromic sequences flanking the HS1.2

The most relevant result of our analysis was the finding
that each HS1.2 enhancer, in all the examined species, is
flanked by two 3 kb segments forming a palindromic
structure (see Figures 4 and 5). Impressively, while the
similarity of each pair of segments is extremely high, the
similarity of the palindromic sequences among the different species is strikingly low. These findings suggest
that the evolutionary pressure was much higher in
maintaining the palindromic structure rather than the
sequence conservation. As a consequence, it can be concluded that the palindrome plays a conformational role
in the 3’RR functioning. The fact that the HS1.2 enhancer is constantly placed in the middle of the sequence
spacing the two inverted elements, further supports the
crucial role of the conformation of the region. We
hypothesize that the palindrome triggers the formation
of a hairpin structure externally exposing the HS1.2
enhancer (Figure 8). The orientation of HS1.2 is therefore irrelevant for the enhancer function. Indeed, it was
found in different orientation in different species and
also in different orientation in the two 3’RR human
domains. Moreover, the opposite orientations of the two
HS1.2 in human add support to the actual formation of
the hairpin in vivo. The paired inverted sequences could
form the stem of the hairpin. This is a fragile site that

could be involved in rearrangements and translocation
effect as in c-myc relocation [31]. An exchange involving the stem may result in the inversion of the loop
region, changing the HS1.2 orientation. We can
hypothesize that an inversion occurred at least two
times since the divergence between Homo sapiens and
Mus musculus (as suggested by dot plot analysis, see
Figure 5 and above in Results). The inversions limits at
least partially spanned the two palindromic regions, suggesting a cause/effect relationship. The palindrome
could facilitate the inversion event, and the latter could
contribute to perpetuate the palindrome.
HS1.2 polymorphisms

Population genetics of HS1.2 polymorphisms is available
only in humans, for which six distinct variants have
been sequenced (AY530201, AY530200, AJ544220,
AJ544219, AJ544218 [21]; HM756255, our previously
unpublished data). The human variants result from (i) a
variable number of the 40 mer and its flanking cytosinerich box (yellow and green, respectively, in Figure 6); (ii)
the sequence connecting the constant core of the HS1.2
(purple in Figure 6) to the stretches of 40 mer repeats,
that is constituted by a 18 bp cytosine-rich box or by a
29 mer (green and red, respectively, in Figure 6). HS1.2
polymorphisms have been detected also in 6 out of 8

100 replicate trees in which the taxa clustered together after the bootstrap analysis is shown at the root of the branches when significant (i.e. when
higher than 50%). As examples, the value ‘100’ at the base of the separation between the taxa Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus in panel D means
that the two taxa were clustered together in all the replicate trees, while ‘72’ between Homo sapiens and Gorilla gorilla in the same panel means that
72% of the 100 replicate trees clustered these two groups together.

non-human primates for whom this enhancer was identified in genomic databases (Figure 6). We acknowledge
that the number of individuals for each species present
in these archives is not known, as well as the sequence
coverage. We can suppose that very few individuals,
maybe a single one, are present in GenBank or Trace
Archive. The variants we have detected are, therefore,
very likely just the most frequent ones of each species.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the two Platyrrhini
(marmoset and titi) share the same HS1.2 form of the
panda. We then hypothesize that this shared form of
the enhancer was also at the base of all the Catarrhini
variants.
IgA and 3’RR have relevance in response to infections
and in diseases [3,16-18,20,32]. The more remarkable
polymorphism found in 3’RR lies within the HS1.2 that

has the central position in the palindromic structure, on
top of the hairpin (Figure 8). We hypothesize that it can
influence the modulation of the Ig switch through an
interaction between the extruded enhancer and peptidic
factors. The resulting molecular complexes may affect
the mobility of the entire 3’RR and finally the formation
of loops joining different constant and variable Ig portions. It could be interesting to investigate the role of
the variants we have found in differently modulating the
Ig switch and production in different species, especially
in animal models such as macaque and mouse.

Conclusions
We remark that both coding sequences and wide noncoding regulatory regions have undergone to some evolutionary pressure, and that part of this pressure was

Inspecting the homologous human region in the

not show the HS1.2 orientation in this graphic because it differs

Methods
Conserved synteny screening

We used the following list of mouse sequence tags from
[GenBank:NC_000078.5]: a 20 bp tandem repeat
(114493451-114493793), an alpha locus portion
(114496952-114497890) and seven enhancers, that is
HS1.2 (114483000-114483159), HS3.A (114470545114470747), HS3.B (114492057-114492261), HS4
(114466607-114466729), and HS5, HS6 and HS7. Those
last three were localized by their primers sequences,
listed in previous paper [33].
These sequences were aligned by BLAT (BLAST-Like
Alignment Tool, http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat)
versus the 2007 release of the Mus musculus (mouse)
genome, to identify the limits of the mouse 3’RR contig
(chr12:114,459,657-114,497,890 in mmu9 draft; size
38234 bp)(Figure 3). This region was used to investigate
the Amniota species of which the sequenced genome
was available in the “Comparative Genomics” group of
tracks at the UCSC mouse genome browser site http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=mm9. So the
list of the species we checked was in the order: rat (Rattus norvegicus, rn4), Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus, cavPor3), man (Homo sapiens, hg19), chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes, panTro2), orangutan (Pongo abelii,
ponAbe2), macaque (Macaca mulatta, rheMac2), marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, calJac3), dog (Canis familiaris,
canFam2), panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, ailMel1),

Database searches for enhancers

We searched for clones with the mouse (see previous
section) and human version of the Alpha portion, repeat
and enhancers (Alpha, GenBank:NC_000014:1060
53245-106054732, 1488 bp; repeat, GenBank:
NC_000014:106048991-106049802, 812 bp; HS3, GenBank:NC_000014:106048351-106048676, 326 bp; HS1,2,
GenBank:NC_000014:106041545-106042009, 465 bp;
HS4, GenBank:NC_000014:106032614-106032974, 361
bp), using the nucleotide version of BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi). The asked databases were from the “Others”
group (i.e. limiting results to non-human and nonmouse records), further specifying in the Taxonomy
field to exclude “Homo (taxid:9605)”. The three checked
databases were: refseq_genomic (fully-sequenced genome entries from NCBI’s Reference Sequence project);
wgs (whole genome shotgun sequence); htgs (high
throughput genomic sequences). To allow a better
matching among so divergent species, especially among
their 3’end tails, we chose a non-standard set of parameters: Match/Mismatch Scores 1/-1; Existence/Extension Gap Costs 0/2. Then we chose from the BLAST
output the relevant sequences (see Table 1 for the list of
species with sequences similar to the human queries) by
empirically setting the “Expect” threshold-value to 1e-05.
Dot plot analysis

We identified 2 genomic contigs of Homo sapiens
(3’RR1, [GenBank:NC_000014.8:106152458-106175002],
and 3’RR2, [GenBank:NC_000014.8:106032614-10605
4732]), and one contig of Mus musculus [GenBank:
NC_000078.5:114466607-114497890], Oryctolagus cuniculus [GenBank:AY386698.1:7160-21816] and Canis
lupus familiaris [GenBank:AC187024.23:146314165755]. Finally, we assembled a contig of Ailuropoda
melanoleuca, sewing the scaffold3005_4 [GenBank:
ACTA01092430.1:1574-6589] and the scaffold3005_5
[GenBank:ACTA01100430.1:1-7968] by a stretch of 600
N. We performed a series of pairwise comparisons
among these six genomic contigs, by use of two dot plot

Database hunting for HS1.2 polymorphisms

The search for HS1.2 polymorphisms was refined using
the specialized alignment tool Trace-Archive BLAST
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?BLAST_SPEC=TraceArchive&BLAST_PROGRAMS=megaBlast&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch. The Trace Archive http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi is a repository of
sequencing data from gel/capillary platforms, partitioned by genome and sequencing methods. There is a
daily-growing amount of available reads from thousands of WGS projects. We performed a BLAST
search on every available database referring to species
identified in the previous analysis for the presence of
this enhancer and to the 24 primates available in the
Archive (Aotus nancymaae, Ateles geoffroyi, Callicebus
moloch, Callithrix jacchus, Cercopithecus aethiops,
Colobus guereza, Eulemur macaco, Gorilla gorilla,
Homo sapiens, Hylobates concolor, Lemur catta,
Macaca fuscata, Macaca mulatta, Microcebus murinus,
Nomascus leucogenys, Otolemur garnettii, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Papio anubis, Papio cynocephalus,
Papio hamadryas, Pongo pygmaeus abelii, Saimiri boliviensis, Tarsius syrichta). The sequences detected were
selected for HS1.2 completeness and multi-aligned by
use of ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/
index.html [35]) and MAFFT (http://align.bmr.kyushuu.ac.jp/mafft/software/ [36]) and by use of Seaview
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html to manual revise the ClustalW/MAFFT outputs. See Figure 6
for a graphical representation of the detected HS1.2
variants.

inspected. The best-fitting substitution model was
selected using ModelGenerator [38], under the Akaike
information criterion (AIC1), as implemented in MultiPhyl online [39]. The following models were integrated
in the phylogenetic analysis: GTR + I + G for C-alpha;
HKY + I for HS3 and HS4; HKY + G for HS1.2.
An unrooted tree was constructed using the maximum
likelihood method applied to nucleotides, as implemented in Garli version 0.96 http://www.bio.utexas.edu/
faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html, with bootstrap percentages obtained as a consensus after 100 replicates.
