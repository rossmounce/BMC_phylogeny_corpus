Abstract
Background: Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are currently being explored as potential
candidate peptide drugs. Since antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of every
living organism, it is possible to discover new candidate peptides using the available genomic and
proteomic data. High throughput computational techniques could also be used to virtually scan the
entire peptide space for discovering out new candidate antimicrobial peptides.
Result: We have identified a unique indexing method based on biologically distinct characteristic
features of known antimicrobial peptides. Analysis of the entries in the antimicrobial peptide
databases, based on our indexing method, using Fourier transformation technique revealed a
distinct peak in their power spectrum. We have developed a method to mine the genomic and
proteomic data, for the presence of peptides with potential antimicrobial activity, by looking for
this distinct peak. We also used the Euclidean metric to rank the potential antimicrobial peptides
activity. We have parallelized our method so that virtually any given protein space could be data
mined, in search of antimicrobial peptides.
Conclusion: The results show that the Fourier transform based method with the property based
coding strategy could be used to scan the peptide space for discovering new potential antimicrobial
peptides.

Background
Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been discovered as
the first line of defense in almost all major groups of

organisms like animals, plants and microbes [1,2]. As an
integral part of the innate immune system, they also help
in immunological boosting, against harmful pathogens.
Several similar AMPs have been identified from different

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7(Suppl 2):S2

organisms, proving their evolutionary significance in the
defense mechanism [3]. These AMPs could serve as safe
and efficient drug candidates against the microbes that
become resistant to synthetic drugs. They offer a broad
spectrum of activity against diverse microbial systems, like
bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa [4]. Several modes of
actions of these AMPs have been suggested and identified,
like pore forming, inhibition of cell-wall/nucleic acid/
protein synthesis etc [5]. As with the modes of action, they
also show a diverse function, in addition to the primary
antimicrobial activity, such as tissue repair and tissueremodelling process etc [6]. Many AMPs have also been
identified with potential anticancer activities.
The significance of the study on AMPs is justified from
their prominent role in the host defense mechanism of
human beings. Researchers have identified AMPs in several parts of the body including skin, alimentary canal,
urogenital, respiratory, gastrointestinal, mammary, ocular, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems [7,8]. They have
been implicated in several diseases such as psoriasis, dermatitis, cystic fibrosis and inflammatory bowel diseases
[9]. A rat homologue of human antimicrobial peptide
Cathlicidin has been shown to play a critical role in the
innate immunity of the central nervous system. Cathlicidin has also been detected in sufficient quantity in human
and bovine milk [10]. In recent years, AMPs have been
implicated in several unexplained human inflammatory
disorders. This has led to the search for novel therapeutic
approaches.
Antimicrobial peptide properties
Currently there are about a thousand AMPs identified and
databased [11,12]. Broadly divided as those with or without disulphide bridges, they are usually cationic and possess amphipathic stereo geometry. In the Antimicrobial
Peptide Database [11], the AMPs are also grouped based
on their activity, as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and
anticancer peptides. While many of the properties such as
charge (cationic) and hydrophobicity are similar, AMPs
also have group specific properties such as highest
Cysteine (Cys) content in antiviral, and lowest Cys content in anticancer AMPs. In general AMPs are small in size,
typically <10 kDa, with less than 50 amino acid residues.
The majority of them have a net positive charge (cationic)
in the range of +2 to +7 at pH 7. The Glycine content is
high in almost all the AMPs while Methionine is the least
found amino acid. Sequence and structural motifs have
also been identified in AMPs [13].
Discovering new AMPs
Ever since the potential use of AMPs as natural antibiotics
has been envisaged, a lot of research has gone in to discovering and designing new AMPs for improved activity and
efficiency. Synthetic peptide variants of the known AMPs

have been synthesized in the laboratories and tested for
their activity [14]. The synthetic analogues to natural
AMPs are mostly generated by mutational experiments,
like single amino acid substitution [15,16]. Rational
design of novel AMPs, by the structural modification of
the natural ones has yielded good results [17-20]. Several
de novo design methods have also been shown to construct artificial AMPs with improved activity, enhanced
specificity and therapeutic index [21-24]. Peptide engineering based on the biophysical studies is also being
attempted, to create novel AMPs [25]. A new field of
study, peptidomics has come to help researchers who are
in search of identifying new peptides [26]. The APD (Antimicrobial Peptide Database) offers an interface to predict
the antimicrobial activity of any submitted peptide
sequences, based on a simple residue analysis and count
method.
Even though many new AMPs with improved activity
have been reported, seldom has any method been used to
tap the potential of huge amount of genomic and proteomic data, to discover hitherto unknown AMPs. As of
mid 2005, data is available to the public from 266 complete genomes, 1,226 ongoing genome projects [27],
184,304 experimentally verified protein sequences [28],
1,779,481 translated protein sequences [29], 44,202,133
reported nucleotide sequences [30] and 31,217 protein
structures [31]. This is the molecular space available for
screening for potential natural antimicrobial peptides.
We have developed a Fourier transform based screening
method that could mine the rich source of data available
in the genomic and proteomic databases, and identify
potential AMPs. The parallel version of our method could
also virtually scan the entire peptide space for any given
length, for the presence of AMPs. Using our established
method, we are currently working on to virtually mine the
whole human peptide space for the potential antimicrobial peptides.
Proteins and Fourier Transformation
Fourier transform (FT) has been extensively used to study
periodicities in introns, genes, repeats, coding and noncoding regions in DNA sequences [32-35]. In proteins,
Fourier transform methods have been used for classification and other structure based studies such as analysis of
symmetry and repeating structural units or patterns, prediction of secondary/tertiary structure prediction, prediction of hydrophobic core, motifs, conserved domains,
prediction of membrane proteins, prediction of cellular
localization etc [36-40]. FT methods have also been successfully used to study the phylogenetic relationships
between genetic sequences [41]. Most of the research in
protein science, using Fourier transform methods has
focused on structural aspects. The most often used meth-

ods to code biological sequences in to numerical
sequences, for signal processing, are the binary indicator
sequence method for DNA sequences, and the EIIP index
and hydropathy index [42,43] method for protein
sequences. Other index methods have also been tested for
protein sequence coding. In this study we propose a high
performance, protein property based function prediction
method using Fourier transform. We have shown that the
use of a combination of distinct protein property based
indices, in relation to its function, gives the best representation of the peptides function in the frequency domain.
We have successfully implemented and tested our method
for the prediction of antimicrobial activity.
In this paper we address 3 main areas, property based protein coding method, antimicrobial activity prediction
using Fourier transforms and a parallel environment to
data mine both naturally occurring and artificial peptide
space (virtually generated random sequences).

Results and discussion
The spectrum of each one of the indices Eq. (1–5) and
their representation as a whole Eq. (8) are plotted in Figure 1, where we could clearly visualize the effect of the
holistic approach (the combined spectrum represented by
all the contributing properties), in terms of a distinct peak
at period 5. In Figure 1, even though we could observe the
peak, in the individual plot of the spectrum obtained only
with hydrophobicity index, the magnitude of the peak is
higher and distinct in the total power spectrum. The Signal to noise ratio at the period 5 is distinctly higher in the
total power spectrum compared to that of the SNR at 5 of
the hydrophobicity spectrum. A clear boosting of the antimicrobial activity signal at period 5 and a great reduction
in the noise level are the two important outcomes that we
observe, as a result of the holistic approach. The individual Fourier spectrum of other indices sometimes showed
the peak at period 5, but failed to show up other times.
The Euclidean metric to screen the sequences based on the
similarity to the reference spectra was identified as D = 3.
The signal to noise ratio was also identified as >5 in period
4|5|6.
Mining the 10,000 random sequences yielded 3 positive
hits, predicted as containing antimicrobial activity. The
predicted peptide sequences are:
Hit1: AQQAQSRREVTHMVQH
Hit2:CIVYCMEIGAIRRCAK
Hit3:FFPEMREYARDCEQSP

All the three hits show a clear and distinct peak at period
5 (Figure 2).
For Hit 1 and Hit 2 APD's simple prediction tool predicted
that they might form alpha helices and might have at least
3|6 residues on the same hydrophobic surface, might
interact with membranes and has a chance to be antimicrobial peptides. But for the Hit 3, APD's prediction said
that the sequence has negative charge and has very little
chance to be an antimicrobial peptide. The sequence analysis details for the above predictions by APD are given in
the Table 1.
The BLAST similarity search results for all the 3 hits
against APD is given in the Table 2, with similarity scores
in percentage.
The Parallel scan for predicting the peptides with antimicrobial activity among the 165 random sequences gave a
huge reduction in the computing time, as the number of
processors was increased, as shown in the Figure 3. All our
3 hits predicted under serial scan were also among the 12
hits obtained in the parallel run.

Conclusion
In this work, we have established a method based on Fourier transformation, using property-based sequence coding approach, to predict antimicrobial activity of peptide
sequences. Fourier analysis of antimicrobial peptides
using the holistic approach yields the boosted signal at
period 5, the noise level is reduced and the signal to noise
ratio also increases compared to the Fourier spectrum of
the individual amino acid indices, particularly in comparison with the hydrophobicity indexed spectrum. As an initial step, we derived at a Euclidean metric threshold and
Signal to Noise Ratio threshold level, based on the analysis of a particular class of antimicrobial peptide (anticancer peptides). To test our method, we mined the randomly
generated 10,000 peptide sequences of 16 residue length,
using the above threshold value, in their respective frequency domain. This gave 3 positive hits. Analysis of these
potential antimicrobial peptide sequences (positive hits),
in comparison to the only available simple prediction
tool, validated our predictions. Out of the 10,000 random
peptides that we screened, many of them had helical structures and hydrophobic patterns (tested using the online
tool
http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/serrano/
agadir/agadir-start.html) but failed to pass through our
filter. This shows that antimicrobial property is determined by the complex "multidimensional signatures"
rather than by individual properties, as suggested by
Yount and Yeaman [13]. The 10000 random peptides did
contain many amphipathic, or membrane-spanning peptides. But those peptides that did not have significant AMP
activity were filtered out, as indicated by the period 5

behaviour. The remaining hits were examined individually and were found to have significant AMP property. It is
possible that some false negatives might have occurred. At
least among the 10000 random peptides that were
screened there were no false positives. We also showed the
use of a parallel version of our program in data mining
huge peptide space, for potential antimicrobial activity.
We are currently fine-tuning our method to include all the
different classes of antimicrobial peptides and also to classify the hits based on corresponding classes.
Our future work is aimed towards virtually generating and
data mining the whole peptide space for the antimicrobial
peptides. We are also working on the sequence input
method to mine, the available proteomic and genomic
data in the public databases.

Property based protein coding
The concept of structure-activity relationship is well established in the field of cheminformatics, where techniques
like Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR)
are used for predicting the biological activity of chemical
compounds. We propose a similar method for predicting
the functions of the proteins, based on their physicochemical properties. In this approach, we coded the antimicrobial peptide sequences, with numerical indices
based on their physicochemical properties in order to represent the function – antimicrobial activity. Most of the
Fourier transform methods in protein science have used
either hydrophobicity index or EIIP (electron-ion interaction potential) index. In our proposed property based
function prediction method, we used 5 different indices to
represent each peptide sequence, viz. hydrophobicity
index (xh [n]), charge index (xc [n]), polarity index (xp [n]),
cysteine index (xs [n]) and aminoacid distribution index
(xd [n]). Xh [n] was coded using Kyte-Doolittle scale [5], xc
[n] was coded based on the charge of the aminoacid, +1 if
positive, -1 if negative and 0 if neutral. Xp [n] was coded
based on the polarity of the aminoacids, +1 for polar residues and -1 for non-polar residues, xs [n] was coded as +1
for Cysteine and 0 for the rest of the residues and xd [n]
was coded based on the APD statistics of the residue distribution among various AMPs.

The initial coding was done in Matlab.
The spectra of the individual indicator sequences were
analyzed along with the power spectrum.
Metric
The initial analyzes involved several representative peptides from all the four classes of AMPs (anticancer, antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial), to identify the presence
of distinct signals that would be characteristic of the antimicrobial activity. We also studied the contribution of the
individual properties (different aminoacid indices), to the
nature of the antimicrobial activity.

With that initial analysis, we further went on to study only
a group of AMPs classified as anticancer peptides in APD.
This involved analysis of 18 anticancer peptides in their
frequency domain. Among these we took the power spectrum of all those peptides with 16 residue length (APD ID

The relative difference of each one of the original 18 anticancer peptide spectrum to that of the common reference
spectrum was measured in terms of Euclidean metric. The
power spectrum of all the 16 residue AMPs were averaged
for the purpose of generating a representative spectra. The

The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was also computed for all

representative power spectra. The SNR is computed using

Data mining the peptide space
To test the performance of our method, we generated
10000 random peptide sequences of 16 residue length,
using Perl scripts. For every sequence in the multiple
sequence file, the indicator sequences are generated based
on our proposed property based coding method, Fourier
transforms obtained and power spectrum calculated. The
power spectrum of every sequence was analyzed based on
signal to noise ratio as well as Euclidean metric with the
threshold value of 3. The sequences that contain the high
SNR at period 4/5/6 and D = 3, are captured as potential
antimicrobial peptides.

Every positive hit from the data mining was analyzed
through APD tools, to cross check the prediction accuracy.
These hits obtained from the random peptide sequences
were submitted to APD's simple antimicrobial activity
prediction tool. The positive hits were also used to perform BLAST similarity searches against the APD.
Parallel environment
Since the virtual peptide space is huge, to the order of 2016
(we only used 10000 random sequences to test our
method using the serial Matlab code) for the 16 residue
peptides, added to the 5 indicator sequences the number
for the 16 residue peptide space goes to 5 × 2016. The FFT
(Fast Fourier Transformation) computation complexity is
O(N log N) where N is the problem size for the aforementioned order of number of sequences and this would
require a huge amount of computing time.

A theoretical calculation of computing time for executing
the serial program would be:

machine, and to utilize the advantage of parallel processing, we developed our method to perform the screening in
a high performance environment. This would enable the
virtual screening of any given peptide space. The parallel
version was implemented in C and MPI. The program was
test executed on the SGI supercomputer with 128 processors, at the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing
Research (MCSR), using PBS (portable batch system)
scripts. We parallely screened 165 randomly generated 16
residue peptides for predicting those with the antimicrobial activity.
