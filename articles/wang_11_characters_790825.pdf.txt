pigment-producing Vibrio cholerae strains

Abstract
Background: Some microorganisms can produce pigments such as melanin, which has been associated with
virulence in the host and with a survival advantage in the environment. In Vibrio cholerae, studies have shown that
pigment-producing mutants are more virulent than the parental strain in terms of increased UV resistance,
production of major virulence factors, and colonization. To date, almost all of the pigmented V. cholerae strains
investigated have been induced by chemicals, culture stress, or transposon mutagenesis. However, during our
cholera surveillance, some nontoxigenic serogroup O139 strains and one toxigenic O1 strain, which can produce
pigment steadily under the commonly used experimental growth conditions, were obtained in different years and
from different areas. The genes VC1344 to VC1347, which correspond to the El Tor strain N16961 genome and
which comprise an operon in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, have been confirmed to be associated with a
pigmented phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of pigment production in these
strains.
Results: Sequencing of the VC1344, VC1345, VC1346, and VC1347 genes in these pigmented strains suggested that
a deletion mutation in the homogentisate oxygenase gene (VC1345) may be associated with the pigmented
phenotype, and gene complementation confirmed the role of this gene in pigment production. An identical 15-bp
deletion was found in the VC1345 gene of all six O139 pigment-producing strains examined, and a 10-bp deletion
was found in the VC1345 gene of the O1 strain. Strict sequence conservation in the VC1344 gene but higher
variance in the other three genes of this operon were observed, indicating the different stress response functions
of these genes in environmental adaption and selection. On the basis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing,
the pigment-producing O139 strains showed high clonality, even though they were isolated in different years and
from different regions. Additionally all these O139 strains belong to the rb4 ribotype, which contains the O139
strains isolated from diarrheal patients, although these strains are cholera toxin negative.
Conclusion: Dysfunction of homogentisate oxygenase (VC1345) causes homogentisate accumulation and pigment
formation in naturally pigmented strains of V. cholerae. The high clonality of these strains may correlate to an
environmental survival advantage in the V. cholerae community due to their pigment production, and may imply a
potential protective function of melanin in environmental survival of such strains.
Keywords: Vibrio cholerae pigment, homogentisate oxygenase, clonality

1. Background
Vibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of the severe
diarrheal disease cholera. It has caused seven pandemics
since 1817. The seventh pandemic, which began in
1961, was triggered by biotype El Tor, serogroup O1. In
1991, a new serogroup, O139, appeared, challenging the
common belief that only strains of the O1 serogroup
could cause epidemics [1,2]. Epidemics of cholera
caused by O1 and O139 V. cholerae are still a major
public health problem in most developing countries. In
addition to the known cholera toxin and colonization
factors of V. cholerae, many other factors contribute to
the pathogenicity of this organism, including hemolysin,
RTX toxin, and adaptive response systems [3-6]. The
environmental survival ability of this microorganism,
which has two life cycles, is very important. Climate and
environmental changes, including temperature of the
aquatic environment [7] and seasonal algal blooms [8],
have been confirmed to be related to the persistence
and outbreak of cholera in human populations [9].
In addition to the well-studied virulence factors, melanin has also been linked with pathogenicity and virulence in a variety of pathogenic microbes, including
Cryptococcus neoformans, Azotobacter chroococcum,
group B Streptococcus, and Burkholderia cepacia
[10-12], and its catabolic pathway has became an important herbicide target in plants [13,14]. Melanin is the
most widely distributed protective pigment in the biosphere and its production is thought to be of great significance [15-17]. Considerable interest has been shown
in melanin, apart from its association with severe
human diseases. Melanin is believed to contribute to
microbial virulence and provides a survival advantage by
increasing a pathogen’s tolerance to enzymatic degradation, radiation (UV, solar, or gamma), heavy metals, and
adverse temperatures (heat and cold); by reducing a
pathogen’s susceptibility to killing through host antimicrobial mechanisms; and by interfering with the host
immune response to infection [10-12]. For V. cholerae,
it has been reported that mutants induced by chemical
reagents or natural isolates subjected to stress, particularly hyperosmotic shock and elevated temperature, can
produce brown pigment [18-22]. Melanogenesis also has
a specific function with respect to the survival of V. cholerae in its natural habitats [20]. A further study has
shown that melanin pigment formation can enhance the
viability of V. cholerae strains in terms of UV resistance,
the production of major virulent factors, and colonization, and that mutants of V. cholerae that produce large
amounts of melanin are more virulent than their nonmelanogenic parental strain [23].
In the tyrosine catabolic pathway, melanin pigment is
produced [23,24] from homogentisate, which is the
main p-diphenolic intermediate of normal L-tyrosine

catabolism. After its formation through this pathway,
the aromatic ring undergoes an oxidative cleavage to
yield maleylacetoacetate, which is cis:trans isomerized to
fumarylacetoacetate, and this compound is finally split
into fumarate and acetoacetate. The enzymes involved
in this pathway are, successively, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (pHPD), homogentisate oxygenase
(HGO), maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAI), and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). It is known that disruption of the balance between the first two enzymes in
this sequence can cause homogentisate accumulation,
and leads to its spontaneous oxidation and the production of the so-called pyomelanins [15]. V. cholerae has
been proposed to be a useful prokaryotic model of
alterations in L-tyrosine catabolism and has been used
to study the molecular basis of diseases related to L-tyrosine catabolism [15]. However, to date, all the research
on melanogenesis in V. cholerae has been based on chemically induced mutants or mutants generated using
transposons.
During our cholera surveillance, some O139 and O1
strains that produced soluble brown pigments were isolated from environmental water samples and patients.
Unusually, these strains can produce pigment under the
normally used experimental growth conditions [LuriaBertani (LB) nutrient agar or broth without temperature
limitation]. Using transposon mutagenesis, we determined that the p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
(HPD; VC1344 in the N16961 genome) in the tyrosine
catabolic pathway was responsible for the pigment production in these strains [24]. Further, the three genes in
a cluster downstream of VC1344 were found to correspond to the other three enzymes involved in tyrosine
catabolism [23,24]. In this study, we analyzed the
sequence variance of the four genes involved in tyrosine
catabolism and the functions of the mutant genes to
determine the possible mechanism of pigment production in these isolates. We also found a close relationship
of clonality among these strains, even though they were
isolated in different years and from different areas. The
potentiality of clone selection and pathogenicity of such
strains should be considered.

2. Methods
2.1 Strains

In this study, 22 V. cholerae O1 and O139 toxigenic and
nontoxigenic strains were used (Table 1). Among these
isolates, 95-4, 98-200, JX2006135, JX2006136,
JX2006175, GD200101012, and 3182 are pigment-producing strains. These strains were isolated in different
years and from different provinces of China. The El Tor
strain 3182 was isolated from patients and the other six
O139 strains were isolated from environmental water. In
addition to the reference strains, including N16961,

Pigment which can be observed in the culture condition of LB medium and 37°C.

569B, and MO45, the controls included other non-pigment-producing strains that were isolated in the same
province or at the same time as the pigmented strains.
Strains were cultured in LB liquid medium shaking at
37°C or on LB agar plates (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast
extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 1.5% agar).
2.2 PCR and sequencing

Four genes of VC1344, VC1345, VC1345, and VC1347
(corresponding to the N16961 genome) were amplified
using the primer pairs listed in Table 2 (S-1344, S-1345,
S-1346 and S-1347 respectively). The PCR products
were purified and sequenced. Sequence alignments and
comparisons were performed using the CLUSTAL X
program (version 2.0).
Reverse transcription PCR was used to detect if these
four genes were transcribed together. Total RNA of
strains N16961 and 95-4 was extracted using an RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen), transcribed to cDNA and used as
templates. Four pairs of primers designed within of the
ORF of each gene, RT-1344, RT-1345, RT-1346 and
RT-1347 (Table 2), and three pairs of primers spanning
the intervals between these four genes, RT-1344-45, RT1345-46, and RT-1346-47 (Table 2), were used in the
amplification. The total mRNA without reverse transcription were used as negative control,

2.3 Filling in of the 15-bp gap in the VC1345 gene

Two pairs of primers were used to amplify the upstream
and downstream fragment of the 15-bp gap in the
VC1345 gene of pigment-producing strain 95-4. The
primers were as follows: 1345:1U, 1345:525L, 1345:555U
and 1345:1122L (Figure 1 and Table 2). The 5’ end of
primer 1345:525L overlapped with 1345:555U and contained the 15-bp gap sequence. Apart from the 15-bp
gap sequence, the PCR product has the same sequence
as the wild-type VC1345 gene of 95-4. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the NcoI enzyme site of the
expression vector pET15b (No. 69661-3; Novagen, Germany) and transformed into wild-type strain 95-4. The
original VC1345 gene of 95-4 was also amplified and
cloned into pET15b, then transformed into 95-4 as a
control.
2.4 Ribotyping

Chromosomal DNAs of the test strains were extracted
and digested with the enzyme BglI. DNA fragments
were separated and transferred to nylon membranes.
The membranes were prehybridized at 42°C for 2 h in
hybridization solution without probe (2× SSC, 1% block
reagent, 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 50%
formamide) and then hybridized with the freshly denatured labeled gene probes at 42°C for 12 h. Hybridized

membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC-0.1% SDS for
5 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in
0.1× SSC-0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68°C. The probe used
in this typing was the PCR product of the conserved
16S rRNA gene of Escherichia coli, which was amplified
by primers 5’-TTT AAT GAC CAG CAC AGT-3’ and
5’-TCT GCC AGT GTT ACA ACC-3’, and was labeled
using a random primer DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis,
IN). Detection was based on digoxigenin-anti
digoxigenin ELISA, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2.5 Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

The PFGE protocol used was based on the PulseNet 1day standardized PFGE protocol for V. cholerae [25].
The cell suspension in a polystyrene tube (Falcon; 12 by
75 mm) was adjusted to an optical density of 4.0-4.2
using bioMerieux DENSIMAT; V. cholerae slices were
digested with 20 U per slice NotI (New England Biolabs)

Page 4 of 10

for 4 h at 37°C. Electrophoresis was performed using a
CHEF-DRIII system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Images
were captured using a Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad)
and converted to TIFF files for computer analysis. The
BioNumerics software package (version 4.0; Applied
Maths, Inc.) was used to analyze the PFGE patterns.
Fragments smaller than 20.5 kbp were not taken into
account. Similarity analysis was performed by calculating
Dice coefficients (S D ), with customized tolerance for
each EP. SD was calculated as follows:
SD = [2(nxy )]/(nx + ny ),

where nxy is the number of bands common to isolates
x and y, nx is the total number of bands for isolate x,
and ny is the total number of bands for isolate y. The
tolerance was determined according to the value when
all the patterns obtained with the same EP were defined
to be indistinguishable. Clustering was created using the
unweighted-pair group method using average linkages
(UPGMA).
2.6 Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide
sequences determined in this study are as follows:
VC1344, GU930289 to GU930308; VC1345, GU942498
to GU942519; VC1346, GU942520 to GU942541; and
VC1347, GU942542 to GU942562.

3. Results
3.1 Sequence variation in the VC1344 to VC1347 gene
cluster

In most cases, the chromosomal location of the HPD
gene is next to other genes with no functional relationships; however, in V. cholerae, this gene is linked to the
other genes involved in tyrosine metabolism, which
were annotated as products of VC1344 to VC1347 [26].
Using the total mRNA of N16961 and 95-4 cultures as
templates, reverse transcription PCR showed that all the
three intervals of these four genes were amplified
(Figure 2), whereas the total mRNA without reverse
transcription (negative control) were negative, which
indicated that VC1344 to VC1347 were transcribed as a
single primary RNA and thereby constituted an operon
in V. cholerae.
The four genes VC1344 to VC1347 of the 22 strains
listed in Table 1 were sequenced. Each gene and the predicted proteins with the number of the mutant sites, and
the frequencies of mutation are shown in Figure 3. These
results show that the four genes within a single operon
exhibit different levels of variation. VC1344 is the most
conserved and VC1345 has the highest variance, with
mutation rates of 2.7% and 10.6% at the nucleotide level,
respectively. This difference in mutation rate was also

evident in the non-pigment-producing strains (Figure
3B). Although the VC1344 gene has 30 mutant sites in its
nucleic acid sequence, only one mutant residue was
found in its amino acid sequence at position 293, which
is either Ala or Val. This one residue substitution does
not cause polar or acid-alkaline change. On the basis of
this amino acid residue difference, the test strains can be
divided into two groups. Strains in the Val293 group
include O1 (classical and El Tor) and O139 strains,
whereas all of the strains in the Ala293 group belong to
serogroup O139, including all six of the O139 pigmentproducing strains. Because non-pigment-producing

strains are also placed in this group, it can be presumed
that this genotype is unrelated to pigment production.
Moreover, none of the mutant sites found in the VC1346
and VC1347 genes were consistently present in genomes
of the pigment-producing strains.
Among the pigment-producing strains, sequences of the
four genes in the O1 strain 3182 were the same as those
in N16961; the exception being VC1345, in which a 10-bp
sequence was missing between nucleotides 258 and 267.
This caused a frameshift mutation and complete change in
its protein sequence (Figure 1). Among the six O139 pigment-producing strains, the sequences of the four genes

were almost identical, with the exception of four nucleotide differences: in the VC1346 gene, C591 in JX2006135,
and A863 in JX2006135 and 95-4; and in the VC1347
gene, A1 in 98-200. Because of the high similarity identified in the cluster analysis of these four genes, all of the six
pigment-producing strains could be grouped into one
cluster, and, with the exception of the VC1344 gene, none
of the non-pigment-producing strains was included in the
clusters of the pigment-producing strains (Figure 4). In
VC1345, a 15-bp fragment deletion, from nucleotide 539
to 554, was found in all six of the O139 pigment-producing strains, suggesting that this deletion mutation may be
correlated with their pigment phenotype. In the borders of
the deletion region, a short direct repeat (GCGGTGTT)
was found (Figure 1).
3.2 Functional complementation of the VC1345 gene of
strain 95-4

Using overlap PCR (Figure 1), we obtained the fragment
which contain the complementary 15 nt which is absent
in the wild pigment production strain 95-4, corresponding to the filling in the 15-bp gap in the VC1345 and
retained the remainder of the gene sequence as in the
pigment production wild-type. We then cloned this fragment containing backbone of the wild-type VC1345
gene of strain 95-4 and the 15 nt filling, into the

expression vector pET15b and this recombinant plasmid
was transformed into the wild-type 95-4 strain. This
gene was expressed with induction of IPTG. After transcomplementation, strain 95-4 with the plasmid carrying
the 15 nt filling of VC1345 gene no longer produced
pigment, whereas the control strain 95-4 containing its
own VC1345 gene cloned in pET15b showed no change
in its pigment producing ability. This therefore showed
that providing HGO enzyme is sufficient to avoid the
pigment production and filling in of the 15-bp gap is
sufficient to recover VC1345 gene function.
3.3 Clonality of the pigment-producing strains

The pigment-producing strains, particularly those in serogroup O139, have the same mutation in the HPD gene;
however, these strains were isolated in different years
and from different areas. To explore the clonal relationships among these strains and the other strains, we used
molecular typing methods to compare the strains at the
genome level. In the PFGE analysis, the patterns of the
six O139 pigment-producing strains were compared
with the other nontoxigenic O139 strains in our V. cholerae PFGE database, which covers the O139 strains isolated in China from 1993 and the O1 strains isolated
from 1961. The cluster analysis (Figure 5) showed that
all of the 11 pigment-producing strains could be

grouped together and separated from other non-pigment-producing strains, including some strains isolated
in the same year and from the same province as the pigment-producing strains. Strain 3182 was not included in
the PFGE analysis since it has an O1 serogroup.
Previously, we analyzed the ribotyping polymorphism
of O139 isolates collected since O139 cholera appeared
in China [27]. Here, we also determined the ribotypes of
these pigment-producing strains. Hybridization showed
that all of the O139 pigment-producing strains had the
same ribotype, which was the same as the rb4 type identified in our previous study. The El Tor strain 3182 has
a similar pattern to the toxigenic strain N16961.

4. Discussion
Many environmental microbes produce melanins, and
melanin pigments are also an inherent phenotype of a

broad range of eukaryotic microorganisms. The melanin
in these strains may confer resistance to unfavorable
environmental factors, host immunity, and even play a
role in virulence expression. Therefore, melanin may
confer a survival advantage on these natural pigmentproducing V. cholerae strains in the estuary niche, and
pathogenicity in the host.
Previously, V. cholerae strains with a pigmented phenotype were induced under stress or by chemical mutagenesis. In this study, we describe certain O139 and O1
isolates that can produce pigment under normal experimental growth conditions. Though the mutations in
these O1 and O139 pigment-producing strains are different, both of them involve the dysfunction of HGO,
the product of the VC1345 gene of V. cholerae. In our
study, gene complementation of the mutant VC1345
confirmed the role of its dysfunction in pigment

production. As a consequence, the disruption of the balance between the enzymes encoded by VC1344 and
VC1345 causes homogentisate accumulation and spontaneous oxidation. The pigment production mechanism
in these wild-type strains is same as in the chemically
induced pigmented mutants [15,18].
With the exception of the 10-bp deletion in the
VC1345 gene of the El Tor strain 3182, which appears
to be a random mutation, it is interesting that the same
15-bp deletion in the VC1345 gene occurs in all the studied O139 pigment-producing strains, despite the fact
that these strains were isolated over a period spanning
the years 1995 to 2006. The deletion boundaries contain
short direct repeats; therefore, it is possible that these
commonly occurring recombinations gave rise to the
mutant strains. It is not clear, however, how the 15-bp
fragment affects the activity of the HGO enzyme. In the
crystal structure of human HGO [28], the homologous
amino acid residues encoded by this 15 bp form a small
turn in the protein surface. Although it is not included
in the predicted active sites or the 20 missense mutations that have been identified in the HGO from AKU
patients [28], structural change in this mutant protein
could be assumed.
The genes VC1344, VC1345, VC1346, and VC1347
comprise an operon, and the products of all four genes
are predicted to be involved in tyrosine catabolism. The
nucleotide and amino acid sequence variations in these
genes are, however, inconsistent; VC1344 is highly conserved, although its nucleotide sequence varies among
the different strains, only a single amino acid residue
difference is present at the protein level, which suggests
that it plays an important role in the tyrosine pathway,
and is conserved despite undergoing different stress
selections. In contrast, VC1345 is considerably more
variable, and different deletion mutations result in dysfunction of its product. This suggests that the accumulation of homogentisate, and the subsequent melanin
production instead of complete decomposition of the
amino acid in the routine pathway, may have survival
benefits for the mutants in certain specific environments, thus the mutations will be retained. Variation
and even dysfunction of the VC1345 product may shift
the metabolic production of tyrosine and produce
strains that are adapted to surviving in rigorous
environments.
It is also interesting that the molecular types of the
O139 pigment strains are indistinguishable or quite
similar, suggesting the high clonality of these strains,
even though they were obtained over a span of at least
12 years and from different regions. They have the same

mutation in the tyrosine metabolism pathway. Additionally, compared to the high variance of the VC1344 to
VC1347 genes, the sequences in all the six O139 pigment-producing strains were highly consistent. These
data suggest that the O139 pigment-producing strains
originate from one distinctive clone. The wide distribution of such strains in the environment may suggest
their survival advantage. The signature of the 15-bp

cholerae when the El Tor biotype is included, is one of
the biomarkers for the pigment-producing strains, and
may be of significance in biological research and epidemiological tracing.
We observed that the nontoxigenic O139 pigmentproducing strains exhibited a rb4 ribotype. In our previous study, the rb4 isolates were cholera toxin genenegative O139 strains, and this ribotype is clearly different from the other patterns of the toxigenic O139
strains that are cholera toxin gene positive [27]. All of
the rb4 strains were isolated from patients, and an
unknown pathogenic mechanism is presumed [27].
Though the O139 pigment-producing strains examined
in this study were isolated from environmental water
samples, their possible pathogenicity should not be
excluded, particularly since such strains are isolated successively in some years. The study showed that the pigment-producing strain expressed more toxincoregulated pilus and cholera toxin, by possibly mechanism which pigment production might cause induction of
the ToxR regulon due to generation of hydrogen peroxide [23]. Strain 3182 is the toxigenic strain associated
with the seventh pandemic, and it is speculated that this
strain is more virulent than other strains on account of
its pigment production, based on its role in V. cholerae
virulence factor expression [23].

5. Conclusions
In summary, in this study we demonstrate that the pigment-producing V. cholerae isolates have mutations in
the tyrosine metabolic pathway are highly clonal, and
suggest that pigment production may confer a survival
advantage to this clone in the environment. The possible
contribution of pigment production to V. cholerae
pathogenesis of those nontoxigenic O139 strains and
toxigenic El Tor strain in humans is of considerable
interest and worthy of further investigation.
