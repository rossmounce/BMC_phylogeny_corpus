by combining in silico predictions with shotgun
proteomics data

Abstract
Background: The ecological niche occupied by a fungal species, its pathogenicity and its usefulness as a microbial
cell factory to a large degree depends on its secretome. Protein secretion usually requires the presence of a Nterminal signal peptide (SP) and by scanning for this feature using available highly accurate SP-prediction tools, the
fraction of potentially secreted proteins can be directly predicted. However, prediction of a SP does not guarantee
that the protein is actually secreted and current in silico prediction methods suffer from gene-model errors
introduced during genome annotation.
Results: A majority rule based classifier that also evaluates signal peptide predictions from the best homologs of
three neighbouring Aspergillus species was developed to create an improved list of potential signal peptide
containing proteins encoded by the Aspergillus niger genome. As a complement to these in silico predictions, the
secretome associated with growth and upon carbon source depletion was determined using a shotgun
proteomics approach. Overall, some 200 proteins with a predicted signal peptide were identified to be secreted
proteins. Concordant changes in the secretome state were observed as a response to changes in growth/culture
conditions. Additionally, two proteins secreted via a non-classical route operating in A. niger were identified.
Conclusions: We were able to improve the in silico inventory of A. niger secretory proteins by combining different
gene-model predictions from neighbouring Aspergilli and thereby avoiding prediction conflicts associated with
inaccurate gene-models. The expected accuracy of signal peptide prediction for proteins that lack homologous
sequences in the proteomes of related species is 85%. An experimental validation of the predicted proteome
confirmed in silico predictions.

Background
Fungi are heterotrophs that utilize a plethora of bioorganic carbon sources through secretion of biomass
degrading enzymes. The fungal secretome is defined as
the sub-proteome of soluble secreted proteins. A large
part of this secretome consists of the many extracellular
hydrolytic enzymes necessary to digest potential substrates. Other extracellular proteins play crucial roles in
fungus-host interactions and in fungal pathogenicity.
Therefore, gene classes expressed in the fungal secretome to a large degree define the ecological niche

occupied by a fungal species, its impact on human
health and agriculture and its usefulness as a production
organism.
In the absence of direct experimental proof fungal
secretomes are usually directly predicted from the genome sequence by analysing the deduced proteome for
proteins with a putative N-terminal signal peptide (SP).
Experimentally identified eukaryotic signal peptides on
average have a sequence length between 17 and 30
amino acids and these SP are further characterized by a
central hydrophobic core region of 6-15 amino acids
flanked by hydrophilic N- and C- terminal regions.
These features have been used to develop highly specific
SP prediction tools, which all show very high prediction
accuracies of 93% or higher when applied to benchmark
data sets [1-3]. However, for predicted proteins the

accuracy of a SP prediction heavily relies on an accurate
gene-model that provides a correct N-terminal end
translation of the encoded protein. Since signal peptides
do not share an apparent sequence homology [2],
sequence variability between secreted homologous proteins of related species is usually significantly higher at
the N-terminal end. This N-terminal heterogeneity
proofs to be a serious problem for homology assisted
gene-finding algorithms to create a reliable gene-model
useful for accurate SP prediction. Therefore, the real
problem in predicting an in silico proteome is not the
accuracy of the present prediction tools, but are the
inaccurate gene-models used as input for these tools.
Furthermore, a number of proteins with a correctly predicted SP are in reality not secreted, for instance
because they are resident ER proteins [4]. Thus, in the
absence of direct experimental proof of secretion, an in
silico predicted secretome does not correctly represent
the actual secretome.
The genus Aspergillus represents an important group
of filamentous fungi with significant impact on many
facets of human welfare. Recently, genome-sequencing
projects of at least 10 Aspergillus species have been
completed or are nearing completion. The corresponding proteomes are usually inferred from gene-models
derived with automated gene prediction tools. Consequently, the large majority of the predicted protein coding sequences are hypothetical and have a variable
degree of accuracy. An encouraging exception is the
extensively manually annotated genome sequence of A.
niger [5]. Genome sequences are publicly available from
two A. niger strains [5,6], which allows for a direct
cross-validation of genome data and for a direct comparison of most of the independently derived genemodels. A. niger is an excellent producer of a suite of
extracellular enzymes and many of them have been
granted a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
These properties have made this fungus a preferred production organism for a range of secreted commercial
enzymes. Among the most important of them are amylases, asparaginases, beta-galactosidases, glucose oxidase,
glycosidases, lipases, phospholipases, proteases, phytases
and several hemicellulases [7]. Nevertheless, based on
the recently elucidated genomic sequence of A. niger, it
can be estimated that currently direct experimental
proof of secretion of only a fraction of the potentially
secreted proteins exists.
In this study we combined comparative in silico SP
predictions for classically secreted proteins with an
extensive set of experimental secretome data derived
from mass spectrometry analysis of A. niger secretome
enriched fractions. Cross-species validation of in silico
SP predictions produced a more accurate list of

Page 2 of 11

potentially secreted proteins and an improved annotation of the underlying gene-models. The secretomes of
A. niger associated with growth on sorbitol and galacturonic acid and upon depletion of the carbon source
were analyzed using a shotgun proteomics approach.
This analysis provided insight into the dynamics of the
A. niger secretome and direct experimental proof of
secretion for known and unknown signal peptide directed proteins (SP proteins).

Results and Discussion
In silico prediction and validation of the secretome of A.
niger

To estimate the prediction accuracy of an in silico secretome prediction, we compared in silico SP predictions
from two A. niger strains (A. niger CBS 513.88 and A.
niger ATCC 1015), and further compared them with SP
predictions of orthologous proteins from three closely
related functionally annotated Aspergillus species (A.
oryzae RIB40 [8], A. fumigatus Af293 [9], and A. nidulans FGSC A4 [10]).
Cross-validation of SP predictions between A. niger CBS
513.88 and A. niger ATCC 1015

The genome of the industrial production strain A. niger
CBS 513.88 was recently sequenced [5] and a total of
14.086 protein coding genes (CDS) were identified. Of
these CDS 191 are known to be N-terminally truncated,
because the corresponding loci are located at a contig
border. When the signalP3 signal peptide prediction
suite [2] is used, a classical signal sequence for secretion
is detected in at least 1831 predicted proteins (Table 1).
For reasons argued above, this in silico prediction is not
very accurate, because it depends heavily on the correctness of the underlying gene-models.
The genome of A. niger strain ATCC 1015 was annotated independently and is predicted to encode some
11.200 protein encoding genes [6]. The signalP3-NN
neural network algorithm predicts that 1540 A. niger
ATCC 1015 gene-models encode proteins with a SP
(Table 1). In total 1257 of those gene-models are orthologous to a single CBS 513.88 gene-model and are
undoubtedly derived from the equivalent locus. This
subset was used to compare the SP prediction results. In
as much as 30% of these predicted proteins conflicting
signalP3-NN prediction results were obtained due to
alternative start codon selection (Additional File 1).
Cross-validation of SP predictions using other Aspergilli
as classifier species

To improve the precision of the A. niger whole proteome SP prediction, signalP3-NN prediction results of
the A. niger CBS 513.88 proteome were also compared
to those of the best homologous proteins of three

closely related fully annotated Aspergillus species, i.e. A.
oryzae strain RIB40 [8], A. fumigatus strain Af293 [9],
and A. nidulans strain FGSC A4 [10]. A summary of the
single genome signalP3 predictions of these Aspergillus
sp. is presented in Table 1.
At such a close phylogenetic distance, clusters of
orthologous proteins not only are predicted to have the
same molecular function in the different species, but
also are expected to exert this molecular function at the
equivalent location. If this is true, SP prediction results
derived from individual signalP3 predictions for Aspergillus sp. proteins orthologous to an A. niger protein of
interest can be used as an independent majority rule
based classifier. The classifier was constructed in the following way. For each genome the complete list of predicted SP proteins and their reciprocal top BlastP hits
with A. niger CBS 513.88 proteins were sorted into A.
niger centred orthologous protein clusters as is detailed
in Methods. Subsequently, each cluster member was
also screened for a possible signal anchor (SA). In this
way 1527 A. niger centred orthologous clusters with at
least one putative SP protein could be formed. Of these
clusters 1274 are spanning three to five genomes and
253 are formed by bidirectional “best hit” protein-pairs
(Additional File 1). In total 669 thus formed
protein pairs and clusters showed a pan-genomic crossvalidation of SP prediction.
It should be noted that not all of these cross-validated
proteins are actually secreted. Proteins with a function
in the secretion pathway or related compartments such
as the vacuole may with this in silico approach be classified as (potentially) secreted proteins. For instance, we
have observed clustering of at least 12 resident ER proteins, which can be recognized by the presence of a
C-terminal ER-retention motif [4] (Additional File 1).
However, as for most of the here classified proteins a
molecular functional characterization is lacking, we have
not taken this into account in our analysis. A further
inspection of Additional File 1 suggests that for all five
analysed Aspergillus sp. the accuracy of a single genome
in silico SP prediction is approximately 85%.

Improved annotation of A. niger gene-models

In 33 protein clusters of the classifier an A. niger CBS
513.88 protein predicted to be a non-SP protein was
clustered exclusively with classifier SP proteins being
orthologous proteins from the other Aspergillus species.
Four of those likely false negative signalP3 predictions
were re-evaluated by aligning their N-terminal ends
(Additional File 2). In all cases selection of an alternative
start codon in the most likely reading frame would i)
bring the predicted protein sequence length in better
agreement with the predicted protein sequence length of
the close by orthologs and ii) add a predicted signal
peptide feature to the alternative N-terminal end of the
predicted CBS 513.88 protein.
Vice versa, in 55 cases a SP prediction for an A. niger
CBS 513.88 protein was not supported by predictions
for the orthologous classifier proteins in 55 of the protein clusters. While the molecular function prediction of
most of them clearly suggests an intracellular molecular
function, in some cases the classifier also showed an
ambiguous behaviour in separating SP and SA predictions. For instance, the protein sequences of
An15g01200 (A. niger CBS 513.88) and the equivalent
protein 137591 (A. niger ATCC 1015) differ both in
length and in their SP/SA prediction. However, compared to the best homologs of the other Aspergillus sp.
both proteins appear to be N-terminally truncated and
therefore both should be N-terminally extended. A
screen of A. niger ATCC 1015 EST sequence data available at the Broad institute (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/) demonstrated the presence of an alternative start
codon revealing a putative SA with a probability of
0.993 for the newly inferred protein (see Additional File
2 for details).
Proteogenome analysis of secretome enriched fractions

Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger N402 cultured
under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media
were analyzed by high-throughput mass spectrometry
(see Methods). The culture supernatants of three conditions were analyzed. In the first two conditions, samples

Braaksma et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/584

of secretome enriched fractions grown on sorbitol were
compared with samples from secretome enriched fractions grown on galacturonic acid (GalA). For induction
of the pectinolytic system sorbitol is considered to be a
neutral carbon source, while the carbon source GalA is
the major constituent of pectin and a specific inducer
[11,12]. In the third condition, prolonged carbon source
exhaustion was exploited. The Open Mass Spectrometry
Search Algorithm (OMSSA) search engine [13] was
used for the analysis of these tandem mass spectra. One
of the major causes for errors in protein identification is
incompleteness of the peptide sequence database due to
missed protein encoding genes and gene-models errors.
Therefore, tandem mass spectra obtained by shotgun
proteomics of the enriched secretome fractions were
independently matched with peptide databases derived
from the predicted proteome sequences of both A. niger
strains. To quantify false positive rates of peptide identification, all spectra were also independently searched
against a reverse peptide database constructed from the
reverse A. niger CBS 513.88 proteome (see Methods). At
the selected E-value threshold < 0.01 for acceptance of a
PSM, the spectrum level FDR was limited to 2% or less
under all conditions. The bioinformatics analysis workflow is presented in figure 1. The full list and functional
annotation of thus identified proteins and the conditions
under which they were detected are shown in Additional
File 3.
The genome of A. niger CBS 513.88 has been subject
of an extensive molecular function prediction, followed
by thorough manual verification. As a result, the genome sequence of this strain encompasses a higher number of protein-coding genes compared to A. niger ATCC
1015. Therefore, the CBS 513.88 proteome was chosen
as the primary database for further analysis. Overall,
7523 accepted PSMs identified 285 predicted A. niger
CBS 513.88 proteins. Additionally, we detected 7 more
A. niger ATCC 1015 proteins with no apparent matching locus in the genome of the other strain (Additional
File 3). Conversely, 25 identified A. niger CBS 513.88
proteins lacked an A. niger ATCC 1015 gene-model,
even though in most cases the corresponding locus was
present in the ATCC 1015 genome.
Wright et al. [14] and Tsang et al. [15] used a similar
shot-gun proteomics procedure to exploit the A. niger
proteome. Very recently also an A. niger proteome study
based on 2D-gel electrophoresis was carried out by Lu
et al. [16]. In the study of Wright et al. [17], where frozen mycelium was used as study material, 214 different
loci were identified. As expected by the differences of
source material the overlap with the present study is
limited to only eight proteins. In the study by Lu et al.
[19] about 70 proteins were detected in the secretome
of which the majority was also found in our data set.

Page 4 of 11

From these, only 3 SP proteins were not identified in
our data set. Similarly to our results, the shot-gun proteomics approach from Tsang et al. [18] identified
about 200 secretome-associated proteins, from which
the large majority correspond to in silico classified SP
proteins, confirming the validity of our approach. About
40 of the proteins identified by Tsang et al. were not
identified in our data set, whereas our experimental data
set identified more than 80 SP proteins not identified by
Tsang et al. [18].
Peptide spectrum matching requires a high quality
proteome. While by and large correct, gene-model predictions may suffer from exon-identification and exonborder errors, leading to a mismatch with identified
peptide spectra. Another reason for not obtaining completely matching peptide spectra may be due to the presence of genetic variation, small strain differences
leading to single amino acid polymorphisms between
the investigated strain A. niger N402 and the two annotated A. niger genomes used for mass analysis. In a systematic analysis of matching peptides that are only
present the peptide databases of the annotated genomes,
31 single proteome peptides were found to match with
a single amino acid polymorphism in the equivalent protein of the other strain. The large majority of these
amino acid polymorphisms (29 out of 31) was observed
between strain CBS 513.88 and strain N402, suggesting
that strain N402 is more closely related to ATCC 1015.
Functional analysis of secretome enriched fractions

Fungal secretome enriched samples are expected to contain a complex mixture of possibly hundreds of SP proteins with a minimal contribution of proteins acquired
through cell lysis.
A simple differential measure of relative protein abundance known as ‘spectral counting’ can be used to quantify the relative contribution of each protein to this
mixture. It has been shown that the total number of
spectra that identify peptides originating from a given
protein shows good linear correlation with the abundance of that protein [17,18] and a good sensitivity for
detecting changes in protein abundance [19,20]. The
major analytical caveats to using this approach is that
spectral count ratios can be biased by undersampling,
the fact that different peptides have different physiochemical properties that affect MS detection, and that in
complex mixtures for proteins with a low number of
spectral counts this correlation is not very strong [19].
To overcome such limitations in interpreting relative
presentation of proteins, functional annotation clustering was used to identify biological processes overrepresented among the proteins detected in the enriched
secretome fractions. For this, detected proteins were
clustered in nine groups. Seven groups were based on

Figure 1 Schematic of the Spectrum to Peptide matching pipeline. Forward and reversed (REV-CBS) databases were searched with local
implementation of the OMSSA MS/MS search engine. Threshold Expect values for matching peptides were estimated from the false discovery
rate (FDR). Best Accepted peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) selection was done by ranking for each MS/MS spectrum the output of each
individual peptide database by E-value and selection of the top hit identified peptide sequence.Insert: Detection of a single amino acid
polymorphism (SAP). A wildcard character (x) is introduced at each position of a single proteome matching peptide, followed by a pattern

equivalent peptide, derived from An18g03570 is retrieved from the complementary proteome. An18g03570 is 99% identical to ATCC 1015

molecular function prediction by using the FunCat
annotation scheme [21] and the predicted molecular
function as guidance. Functionally unclassified proteins
with an SP prediction and a functionally diverse group
of “non-SP proteins” formed two additional groups (figure 2). The group “C-compound and carbohydrate
metabolism” (CH) together with the enzymes of the pectinolytic system formed the largest functional annotation
cluster. From figure 2 it is obvious that compared to
growth on sorbitol the pectinolytic system is induced
upon growth on GalA. Therefore “pectin-modifying proteins” were put in a cluster separate from the CH cluster. FunCat category “extracellular protein degradation”
was used as a basis for the cluster “protein and peptide
degradation”. Furthermore, we distinguished “cell wall
components”, “oxidases”, “lipase-esterases” and “acid
phosphatases”.
Overall, 98% of the 2722 accepted PSMs obtained
from the sorbitol samples could be traced back to a SP
protein in one of the seven functional annotation

clusters or the hypothetical SP protein cluster. Almost
identical results were obtained for the GalA samples.
For the carbon source starvation conditions this
amounted to 88% of the accepted PSMs (figure 2 and
Additional File 3). These results suggest that the quantitative contribution of cell lysis to the secretome
enriched fractions demonstrated by the detection of an
array of functionally diverse non-SP proteins is indeed
limited. The contribution of non-SP proteins seems to
be significantly higher in secretome enriched samples
derived from starvation conditions, but this difference is
primarily caused by the specific expression of a single
non-SP protein An01g09980, with a strong similarity to
Asp-hemolysin from A. fumigatus. Asp-hemolysin has
been purified from the culture filtrate of A. fumigatus,
while no SP is detected [22]. The fact that the A. niger
homologous protein is detected in significant amounts
in the culture filtrate as well, suggests that this is a nonclassically secreted protein. If the Asp-hemolysin is
indeed intentionally secreted, the relative contribution of

cell lysis in secretome enriched fractions under starvation conditions is much more comparable to what is
observed for sorbitol and GalA.
More than 98% of the here-identified secreted proteins
are supported by both signalP3 and majority-rule

predictions. However, the list also includes an ATCC 1015
protein (128537), which is supported by the rule based
classifier based prediction only. Others, such as
An02g11390, are ambiguous in their signalP3 and classifiers based SP predictions, but are clearly present in

secretome enriched fractions. If we consider these proteins
to be genuinely secreted proteins the contribution of cell
lysis in our data set is even lower than discussed above.
Carbohydrate modifying enzymes

Three controlled fermentation conditions were chosen
to study the relative contribution of various classes of
carbohydrate modifying enzymes and proteases to the
secretome. To minimize the effect of undersampling,
sorbitol, GalA and starvation-specific samples were
pooled. Between the three conditions significant changes
were observed for all functional annotation clusters,
except for the cluster of acid phosphatases. Upon
growth on GalA “pectinolytic enzymes” are overrepresented. In contrast, proteins present in the CH cluster
are overrepresented upon growth on sorbitol.
Although some pectinolytic enzymes are found in all
sampled secretome fractions, pinpointing to constitutive expression [12], the pectinolytic system is strongly
induced under GalA growth conditions. Compared to
growth on sorbitol not only the number of spectral
counts related to the pectinolytic functions increase
upon growth on GalA, but also the diversity of enzymatic functions. To identify A. niger genes potentially
involved in galacturonic acid catabolism, we have previously compared A. niger N402 microarray data
obtained upon growth of the fungus on various carbon
sources. Fifteen highly correlating genes were found
that were specifically induced on galacturonic acid
[11]. GalA specifically activates the transcription rate
of six extracellular enzymes. In the GalA derived secretome five of those, pectin lyase A, three exoPGs
(PGAX, PGXB and PGXC) [23] and An02g02540, a
putative pectin acetylesterase, are detected, but only
under this condition. An08g01710, a putative alphaarabinofuranosidase with no apparent SP and part of
this transcriptional cluster, is not found in any of the
secretome fractions (Table 2).
Glucan is one of the major chemical components of the
Aspergillus cell wall and 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferases

therefore play an active role in fungal cell wall biosynthesis [24]. Overall eight 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase
genes from the GH72 family are present in the A. niger
genomes. All eight encoded proteins are predicted to
have a Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, that
becomes linked to the C-terminal residue after a proteolytic cleavage occurring at the so-called ω-site [25]. A
multiple alignment of the eight encoding protein
sequences suggest that they can be assigned to three subgroups (Table 3). Four of those 1,3-beta glucanosyltransferases representing each of these subgroups are detected
in the three main secretomes.
Proteases

Carbon source starvation conditions were chosen to
induce extracellular proteases. Indeed, where the fraction of spectral counts assigned to “extracellular protein
degradation” is 7% and 12% for growth conditions GalA
and sorbitol, respectively, under starvation conditions
this is 24%. The extracellular aspartic proteinase aspergillopepsin I (PepA) is by far most abundant under starvation conditions. Other high abundant proteases are
An08g04490 [26], and the putative serine proteases
An14g02470, An06g00190, and An03g05200, which
together with PepA account for over 75% of the
PSMs assigned to proteases under starvation conditions
(Table 4). In addition, under all tested conditions, a protease (53364) was detected specific to A. niger ATCC
1015 locus only. This aspartic-type endopeptidase has a
predicted SP and homologs are widespread in the genomes of other Aspergillus sp.
Overall, 20 proteases were identified in this study
(Table 4), of which all but An01g00370 have a SP prediction. An01g00370 is an aspartic protease with strong
similarity to aspergillopepsin ApnS of A. phoenicis, and
is only detected under starvation conditions.
An01g00370 is not a protein directed by a classical signal peptide for secretion nor can such signal peptides be
detected in orthologous (predicted) proteins from other
Aspergillus sp. Nevertheless, the number of spectra

making it unlikely that this protein was detected in
these fractions due to lysis. Therefore, in addition to the
highly expressed putative hemolysin homolog, this protease is the second likely candidate for non-classical
secretion and indeed, when subjected to the Secretome

Furthermore, disruption of this protease results in a significant increase of the secreted level of heterologous
laccase activity [28], suggesting it is in fact a functional
extracellular protease secreted by non-classical routing.

Conclusions
In this work we present an improved list of SP proteins
encoded by the A. niger genome. The list of SP proteins
as predicted by signalP3 was improved by the additional
implementation of a rule based classifier constructed
from single genome signalP predictions of the best
homologs combined with a simple decision rule. Conflicting SP predictions are mostly due to inaccurate
gene-models. Re-evaluation of the CDS by N-terminal
alignment showed that selection of an alternative start
codon in the same reading frame is in most cases sufficient to obtain an agreement. For putative SP proteins
that do not have clear homologs in the proteomes of
the related species and thus depend on signalP predictions only, an accuracy of 85% can be expected. Proteogenome analysis of secretome enriched fractions
subsequently provided experimental evidence for secretion of at least 209 of these predicted SP proteins in our
data set, whereas about 40 additional predicted SP proteins were identified in the data sets from Tsang et al.
[18] and Lu et al [19].
The A. niger secretome responds dynamically to
changes of the carbon source. The majority of the
detected carbohydrate modifying enzymes are present
under both sorbitol and GalA growth conditions. However, the relative contribution of the individual enzymes
significantly changed with the carbon source. As was
already evident from transcriptome data [11,12], the
pectinolytic system is most strongly induced under the
GalA growth conditions, where 22 of the 30 proteins
are either solely present or significantly more abundant
in samples from GalA cultures. The most prominent
difference between the growth and starvation conditions

Braaksma et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/584

is the relative contribution of a number of abundant
proteases which levels increase even further under starvation conditions. However, a few other proteases are
exclusively detected upon growth on sorbitol or GalA.
Although a broad spectrum of non-SP proteins was
identified in the secretome enriched fractions, the relative contribution of lysis was very limited, even under
starvation conditions. Still, relative high concentrations
of, two non-SP proteins with a putative extracellular
function, An01g09980 and An01g00370, were detected.
Most probably these proteins are exported outside the
cell by active transport mechanisms, indicating that a
non-classical secretion pathway operates in A. niger.
Further experimental validation of this pathway will be
required by more detailed analysis of trafficking of these
proteins.

Methods
Bioinformatics

Signal peptide predictions: SP predictions were done
with a local implementation of the signalP3 NN and
HMM algorithms [2]. Proteins were considered to be SP
proteins if the signalP-NN D-score was higher then
0.43. Additional signal anchor predictions were done
with a local implementation of the signalP3-HMM
algorithm.
Signal peptide cross-validation and construction of the
classifier: the predicted proteomes of A. niger strains
CBS 513.88 and ATCC 1015, A. oryzae RIB40, A. fumigatus AF293 and A. nidulans FGSC A4 were used as
input. For each individual protein a SP prediction was
done using the signalP3 algorithm. If the score was
above the set threshold D-value the tag SP was added to
the ordered locus name. Next, a bidirectional Blastp [29]
was done between the A. niger CBS 513.88 proteome
and the proteome of A. niger ATCC 1015, and between
the A. niger CBS 513.88 proteome and the proteome of
the three other Aspergillus sp. Each set of pair wise tabular outputs was stringently parsed for bidirectional best
hit pairs using the following criteria: i) between the two
sequences the percentage of identity must be above a
set threshold level of 40%, ii) the two aligned protein
sequences must be of similar size (a difference in size of
less than 20% was accepted) and iii) the aligned region
must include more than 70% of the smallest protein
sequence. Next, these bidirectional best hits were used
to form A. niger centered protein clusters. Protein clusters with at least one SP-tag added to an ordered locus
name were selected for the construction of the classifier.
Implementation: In comparison with single genome signalP3 predictions deviating classifier SP predictions
were considered to be of better-quality when the two
following criteria were met i) a cluster-size of at least
three species and ii) between the non-A. niger classifier

proteins a complete agreement in SP prediction. Muscle
[30] was used for protein multiple sequence alignments.
PredGPI [25] was used for GPI-anchor predictor of
putative 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase genes. The general prosite consensus pattern was used to identify Cterminal ER retention motifs in predicted SP proteins.
Mass spectrometry data analysis. The 98.150 MS/MS
spectra resulting from MS analysis of the A. niger secretome enriched samples (see below) were submitted to a
local implementation of the OMSSA search engine [13].
MS/MS spectra were independently searched against
peptide databases derived from the predicted proteomes
of A. niger strain CBS 513.88 and of strain ATCC 1015
and against a database of randomized sequences constructed from the reverse of the CBS 513.88 proteome.
All OMSSA searches used the following parameters: a
precursor ion tolerance of 0.03 Da, fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da, a miss cleavage allowance of up to and
including 2, all cysteines were considered to be carboxyamidomethylated, oxidation of methionine and deamination of glutamine and aspargine were treated as
variable modifications.
The set E-value threshold was determined iteratively
from the false discovery rate (FDR) and was set to 0.01.
With this setting an FDR of < 2% was obtained for all
samples.
FDR calculation was done as follows: for each identified spectrum with a threshold E-value < 0.01 accepted
peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) with each individual
peptide database were ranked by their E-value and the
top hit identified peptide sequence was selected. The
FDR was calculated from top hit spectral matches to
peptides in the reversed database as described by Elias
and Gygi [31].
The data is available in the PRIDE database [32]
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) under accession numbers
13662, 13663, 13664 and 13665.
Culture conditions

The fungal strain used in this study was A. niger wild
type N402, cspA1 (conferring short conidiophores) a
derivative of ATCC 9029 (alternative names NRRL 3,
CBS 120.49, N400)
Conditions for growth on sorbitol and galacturonic
acid: For pre-culture, 1.0 × 106 spores per millilitre
were inoculated into 2.5-L fermentors (Applikon) containing 2.2 L of minimal medium [33] with 0.05%
yeast extract and either 50 mM D-sorbitol or 50 mM Dgalacturonic acid as carbon source, at 30°C and pH 3.5.
Spore germination in bioreactors was as described previously [34], with headspace aeration and a stirring
speed of 300 rpm, and when dissolved oxygen levels
were below 60%, stirring speed was changed to 750 rpm
and aeration was through sparger inlet. The amount of

monomeric sugars remaining in the culture fluid was
assessed by standard HPLC techniques. Culture supernatants were taken 24 h, and 48 h after inoculation.
Conditions used for carbon source exhaustion: Cultures were grown in batch fermentations in a BioFlo
3000 (New Brunswick Scientific) bioreactor with a 5-L
working volume. Cultivations were performed with varying carbon source (glucose or xylose), nitrogen source
(ammonium chloride or sodium nitrate), nitrogen concentration (low (282.4 mM) or high (564.8 mM)), and
pH (4 or 5) (see Table 5). The medium composition,
cultivation conditions and operating procedure of the
bioreactor have been described in detail previously [35].
Samples for analysis of the carbon source concentration
were collected every six hours and analyzed as described
previously [35]. From each growth condition culture
supernatants were taken after carbon source exhaustion.
Analysis of total protein: The concentration of protein
in cleared culture supernatants (or secretome enriched
fractions) was measured by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay,
using BSA as a standard. The procedure was fully automated using a COBAS MIRA Plus autoanalyzer.
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric
analysis

For secretome enriched fractions obtained from growth
on sorbitol and galacturonic acid equal amounts of protein sample (250 μg) were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and stained with Colloidal Blue Staining
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Gel lanes were cut into
five slices, and each slice was treated with 50 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) for
1 h at 60°C. Next, slices were alkylated with 100 mM
iodoacetamide in NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) for 1 h at room
temperature, washed with NH 4 HCO 3 (pH 8.0). Slices
were rehydrated in 10 ng/μl trypsin (Sequencing grade
modified trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and

digested overnight at 37°C. LC-MS/MS conditions: samples were loaded on a preconcentration column and
peptides were eluted to an analytical column with an
acetonitrile gradient and a fixed concentration of formic
acid. The resulting eluent was subjected to an electrospray potential via a coupled platinum electrode. MS
spectra were measured on an LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo
Electron, San Jose, CA, USA) and MS scans of four
most abundant peaks were recorded in data-dependent
mode. To simplify the comparison between the two
growth conditions the two galacturonic acid and the
two sorbitol samples were pooled. Secretome enriched
samples obtained from carbon source exhaustion were
analysed with LC-ESI-MS-MS performed by Eurogentec
(Seraing, Belgium). From each sample a volume corresponding to 10-15 μg of total protein was digested with
trypsin, without prior separation of the proteins. To
simplify the comparison with growth, all samples were
pooled.
