gene conversion, positive selection and
co-evolution

Abstract
Background: The Toll-like receptors represent a large superfamily of type I transmembrane glycoproteins, some
common to a wide range of species and others are more restricted in their distribution. Most members of the Tolllike receptor superfamily have few paralogues; the exception is the TLR1 gene family with four closely related
genes in mammals TLR1, TLR2, TLR6 and TLR10, and four in birds TLR1A, TLR1B, TLR2A and TLR2B. These genes
were previously thought to have arisen by a series of independent gene duplications. To understand the
evolutionary pattern of the TLR1 gene family in vertebrates further, we cloned the sequences of TLR1A, TLR1B,
TLR2A and TLR2B in duck and turkey, constructed phylogenetic trees, predicted codons under positive selection
and identified co-evolutionary amino acid pairs within the TLR1 gene family using sequences from 4 birds, 28
mammals, an amphibian and a fish.
Results: This detailed phylogenetic analysis not only clarifies the gene gains and losses within the TLR1 gene
family of birds and mammals, but also defines orthologues between these vertebrates. In mammals, we predict
amino acid sites under positive selection in TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 but not TLR10. We detect co-evolution between
amino acid residues in TLR2 and the other members of this gene family predicted to maintain their ability to form
functional heterodimers. In birds, we predict positive selection in the TLR2A and TLR2B genes at functionally
significant amino acid residues. We demonstrate that the TLR1 gene family has mostly been subject to purifying
selection but has also responded to directional selection at a few sites, possibly in response to pathogen
challenge.
Conclusions: Our phylogenetic and structural analyses of the vertebrate TLR1 family have clarified their
evolutionary origins and predict amino acid residues likely to be important in the host’s defense against invading
pathogens.

Background
The innate immune response is the first line of defense
against invading pathogens and is required for an efficient adaptive immune response. Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) play a crucial role in innate immunity by recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns

including lipoproteins, lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharide,
flagellin, dsRNA, ssRNA and CpG DNA motifs (Akira
and Takeda 2004; West et al. 2006). Phylogenetic analysis has classified vertebrate TLRs into six major gene
families [1-3]: TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and
TLR11. Most vertebrates have a single gene for each
TLR gene family [1,2]; the major exception is the TLR1
gene family, which appears to have multiple, paralogous
genes. In mammals, the TLR1 gene family consists of
four members: TLR1, TLR2, TLR6 and TLR10. In birds,

there are also four paralogues with multiple names in
the literature, two TLR1-like genes: TLR1La (TLR1 type
1, TLR1.1, TLR1/6/10 and TLR16) and TLR1Lb (TLR1
type 2 and TLR1.2), and two TLR2-like genes: TLR2a
(TLR2 type 1 and TLR2.1) and TLR2b (TLR2 type 2
and TLR2.2). More distantly related members of the
TLR1 gene family are TLR14 and TLR15 found in mammals and birds, respectively. Phylogenetic and genome
analyses suggest that TLR1- and TLR2-like genes
diverged from a common ancestor early in vertebrate
evolution [1,2]. The genes of the TLR1 gene family are
usually in tandem in both avian and mammalian genomes and are likely to be the product of successive
rounds of tandem gene duplications from an ancestral
gene.
Gene duplication followed by sequence divergence is
one of the most important mechanisms for generating
new genes with novel functions [4,5]. Genetic drift and
positive selection have both played a role in the fixation
and early evolution of duplicated genes [6-9]. Many studies have classified genes showing evidence of positive
selection [10], where genes with roles in host defense/
immunity, chemosensory perception and reproduction
are particularly over represented. Analysis of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratio revealed the
presence of both strictly conserved and rapidly evolving
region in the TLR-related genes in primates[11-13]. A
recent comparative sequence analysis from a panel of
domestic chickens and wild jungle fowl suggest that
TLRs show positive selection [14]. More specifically, an
earlier study suggested that the leucine-rich repeats of
chicken TLR1La and TLR1Lb may have been subject to
positive selection. In contrast, the sequences of all other
avian TLRs were under purifying selection [15], which
appears to be the trend for all TLRs in mammals [1].
In mammals, TLR2 dimerizes with either TLR1 to
recognize microbial triacyl lipoproteins or TLR6 to
recognize diacyl lipopeptides found in Mycoplasma,
lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria or Zymosan
of yeasts [16,17]. Recently, human TLR10 has also been
shown to dimerize with TLR2 and to recognize triacyl
lipoproteins [18], although signaling by this complex
appears to differ from the other TLR1/6/2 complexes.
In chicken [19,20] expression of TLR1La or b, or TLR2a
or b alone fail to be activated by exogenous agonists;
however heterodimers of all four TLR1/TLR2 combinations were activated by both diacyl (Malp-2) and triacyl
(Pam3) lipopeptides, with the exception of TLR2a/
TLR1Lb, which was activated by Pam3 but not Malp-2.
In addition, TLR2a/TLRL1b was also activated by peptidoglycan. The interaction of these TLR1- and TLR2-like
proteins in the absence of any agonist was also shown
by immunoprecipitation. Thus, chicken TLR1-like proteins interact with TLR2-like proteins and recognize

Page 2 of 17

agonists identical to those used in mammals by heterodimers between TLR2 and TLR1, 6 or 10.
A recent study [21] showed sequence divergence in
the C-terminal regions of TLR1 and TLR6 in mammals
to be severely limited by gene conversion. This 300
amino acid region encodes the LRR16-19 motifs, the Cterminal cap motif, the transmembrane domain and
most of the intracellular TIR domain. The need to coevolve with binding partners, such as MyD88 and
TIRAP may explain the selective advantage for gene
conversion in the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR6. A
recent report also found evidence for gene conversion in
the N- and C-terminal regions of the duplicated TLR2A
and TLR2B genes found in the genomes of chicken and
zebra finch [22]. Thus, gene conversion may be a general mechanism that limits the divergence of critical
regions in these proteins, while allowing other domains,
such as the ligand binding domain, to evolve diversified
functions.
The aim of this work was to seek possible explanations for the apparent multiple, independent gene duplications proposed to account for the diversity and size of
the TLR1 gene family [23]. From a phylogenetic analysis
of many avian and mammalian TLR1-like and TLR2-like
genes we have defined the likely role of positive selection, gene duplication, gene conversion and gene coevolution in the evolutionary dynamics of this family.
Our phylogenetic and structural analysis of vertebrate
TLR1 gene family members also predicts amino acid
residues likely to be important in the primary function
of TLRs in the host’s defense against invading
pathogens.

Methods
Nucleic acid extraction

Total RNA from turkey spleen was extracted by TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacture’s protocol. The sample was re-suspended in a
final volume of 50 μl of RNAse-free water. A routine
phenol/chloroform extraction method was used to purify turkey genomic DNA. Both the quantity and quality
of total RNA and genomic DNA were assessed at OD260
and OD 280 using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA).
DNA cloning and sequencing

BAC clones containing TLR1A/TLR1B or TLR2A/
TLR2B sequence were screened by 4D, two-step PCR
from a HindIII, female Beijing duck genomic BAC
library with inserts from vector pIndig-5 (Epi-Center,
USA). The primers used to screen the duck BAC library,
were designed from the orthologous sequences in other
species such as chicken, pig, human or the partial
sequence of duck (AY838880) (Additional file 1, Table

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:149

S1) [24]. Positive clones were confirmed by sequence
analysis of PCR products, then subcloned into pUC118
and sequenced by the shotgun method, (with an average
of 6.38Х coverage) using Big Dye Terminator V3.1 (ABI,
Foster city, USA) on an ABI3130X Sequencer (ABI,
Columbia, MD). Base calling and quality assessment
were performed using Phred [25,26], Assembly was performed using Phred and Consed [27,28]. Sequence identity between duck and chicken genomic sequences was
analyzed using zPicture [29].
To clone the TLR1 gene family sequences from turkey, PCR reactions were carried out in 100ųl total
volume, containing 100 ng turkey genomic DNA, 50
mM Tris/HCl (pH8.3), 10 mM KCl, 50 mM (NH 4 )
2 SO 4 , 2.0 mM MgCl 2 , 200 mM dNTP, 10 U FastStart
Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany),
and 100 pmol each primer designed from the orthologous sequence in chicken and duck (Additional file 1,
Table S1). PCR reaction conditions were: denaturing
for 5 min at 94°C, followed by 94°C for 30s, annealing
for 30s, and 72°C for 1 min per 1 kb, 35 cycles, with a
final 7 min elongation step at 72°C. PCR products
were purified from agarose gels with the QIAEXII gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), ligated into
pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), transformed
into E. coli TOP10 competent cells and plasmid DNA
was sequenced using T3 or T7 universal primer. In
addition, the sequences at the 3`end of TLR2A and
TLR2B were cloned from turkey spleen RNA by 3`RACE using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion,
Austin, USA) and confirmed against the genomic
sequence of turkey.
Sequence analysis

Sequences from the TLR1 gene family were collected
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the
Blast search program [30], retrieved through searches
in ENSEMBL (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) and
identified by Blat searches on the UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). The
alignments of amino acid and nucleotide sequence
used for the analysis of gene conversion and the construction of phylogenetic trees, and for the calculation
of percentage identities were made using ClustalX
(version 2.0) [31]. Sequence homologies were displayed
using JalView 2.5.1[32].
Gene conversion analysis

Recombination analysis was performed using GENECONV (version 1.8) with default settings [33]. The
more conservative and accurate p-values from permutations (10,000 pseudo-replicates) were used and p-values
(p < 0.05) from global fragments were corrected for

Page 3 of 17

multiple comparisons. The aligned sequences were
examined for possible gene conversion events using the
sliding-window genetic diversity plot (Simplot) (version
3.5.1) by bootscan with a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree,
maximum-likelihood distance model, with 1,000 pseudoreplicates in a 200 bp window and with a step size of 20
bp [34].
Phylogenetic analysis

Molecular phylogenies based on sequence alignments
are only as accurate as the alignment data from which
they are produced; consequently it is important that the
alignment data quality is determined [35]. In order to
assess the alignment’s tree like structure, likelihood
mapping was carried out using Tree-Puzzle (version 5.2)
[36], which generally showed alignments to have strong
phylogenetic signals with 89-94% of quartets (1,000
pseudo-replicates) support a unique phylogeny (data not
shown).
Phylogenetic relationships among orthologues and
paralogues of TLR1 and TLR2 subfamilies were carried
out on the protein alignment using PHYML (version
2.4.4) [37]. After selection of the best substitution model
for the aligned protein or DNA sequence by comparing
the likelihood values of different models, two rounds of
analysis were used to search the maximum-likelihood
trees under the JTT model of molecular evolution with
4 substitution rates classes for protein sequences or
HKY85 for DNA sequences. The phylogenetic tree, the
proportion of invariable sites and Gamma distribution
for protein sequence or transition/transversion ratio for
DNA sequence parameters were estimated under the
above model in the first round. Then, the robustness of
the inferred tree was assessed using bootstrapping
(1,000 pseudo-replicates) by fixing the proportion of
invariable sites and Gamma distribution or transition/
transversion parameters in the second round. Gene
Trees were displayed using FigTree (version 1.3.1)
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/).
Estimation of the time of gene duplication events

The fossil calibration time of the orthologous TLRs was
inferred from species divergence times obtained from
the TIMETREE web site (http://www.timetree.org/index.
php). Divergence times of gene conversion and duplication were estimated under global and local clock models
with two runs using CODEML or BASEML within the
PAML package (version 4) [38]. Firstly, the “kappa” (the
transition/transversion rate ratio) and “omega” (the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio) for CODEML or
“alpha” (gamma-distributed rate) for BASEML were estimated, and then the divergence times were estimated
with fixed values for “kappa” and “omega” for CODEML
or “alpha” for BASEML.

Maximum likelihood tests of positive selection

Protein structure analysis

Multiple sequence alignment of coding sequences were
created using DAMBE [39], first on the translated DNA
sequences and then the nucleotide sequence of codon
triplets was recovered by back translation. DAMBE was
also used to check for saturation of nucleotide substitutions using a plot of the number of transitions and
transversions for each pairwise comparison against the
genetic distance calculated with the F84 model of
nucleotide substitution [40], which allows different equilibrium nucleotide frequencies and a transition ratetransversion rate bias. Multiple sequence alignments not
showing saturation of nucleotide substitutions were then
analysed further using CODEML[38]. A series of nested
likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were performed using
CODEML to investigate whether some sites were under
positive selection in each TLR group. The first test compared M1A (nearly neutral: p0, p1, ω0 < 1, ω1 = 1, NS
sites = 1) against M2A (positive selection: p0, p1, p2, ω0
< 1, ω1 = 1, ω2 < 1, NS sites = 2). The second test compared M7 (beta: p, q, NS sites = 7) with M8 (beta & ω:
p0, p1, p, q, ωs > 1, NS sites = 8). The third test was
between M8A (beta & ωs = 1: fix omega = 1, omega =
1, NS sites = 8) and M8.

The Uniprot protein database (http://www.uniprot.org)
was used as an initial resource to define the protein
domain locations of specific amino acid residues in TLR
proteins. If there were no annotated protein domains,
these were determined by aligning genes with their
human orthologues, and then inferring domains from
Uniprot. To examine potential functional or structural
significance of specific amino acid residues, their location was mapped onto the known or predicted threedimensional structures of TLR proteins. The known
structures of human TLR1/2/6 (Jin et al. 2007) were
used directly and as templates to predict the structures
of human TLR10 using CPHmodels (version 3.0), a protein homology modeling server [45]. Template recognition was based on profile-profile alignment guided by
secondary structure and exposure predictions. The
atomic coordinates for the PDB models of human TLR1
and TLR2 proteins suggested the secondary structure of
human TLR10 was similar to human TLR1 (E value 7.0
× 10-89). Amino acid residues were mapped onto these
structures using the protein BLAST alignment of each
group, and a PyMOL script file was generated for visualization using PyMOL (version 1.1) (http://www.pymol.
org).

Intra- and intermolecular co-evolution analysis

To identify co-evolutionary patterns, we used the parametric method based on correlated evolutionary patterns
among amino-acid sites [41] implemented in CAPS
(Version 1.0) [42]. The probabilities and significance of
the correlated evolutionary patterns among amino-acid
sites were estimated using a large number (10,000) of
random samplings and a small a value (0.001) to minimize a false-positive rate (type I error). CAPS implements the step-down permutation procedure [41] to
correct for multiple testing. The scores for the aminoacid substitutions were obtained using the appropriate
blocks substitution matrix (BLOSUM80) [43], depending
on the similarity of the protein sequences. Possible
interactions were also filtered based on cellular compartments: extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic. All amino-acid sites reported in the coevolutionary analyses refer to the positions in the protein sequences of human TLR1, TLR2, TLR6 and
TLR10.
Visualization of co-evolutionary networks

Cytoscape (Version 2.7.0) [44] was used to visualize the
co-evolutionary networks identified by CAPS, and to
generate the networks of correlation between co-evolving amino acids. The correlation coefficients generated
in CAPS were used to determine the color of the lines
between nodes (amino-acid residues).

Results
Isolation of Toll-like receptor-like 1 and 2 genes from the
turkey and duck genomes

The coding sequences for chicken and zebra finch members of the TLR1 gene family were extracted from
sequence databases. The coding sequences for turkey
TLR1-like and TLR2-like genes were cloned from genomic DNA by PCR using primers based on the chicken
orthologues. The 3`-end mRNA sequences of turkey
TLR2A and TLR2B were cloned by 3`-RACE with the
primers shown in Additional file 1, Table S1. Duck BAC
clones containing genes for TLR1A, TLR1B, TLR2A and
TLR2B were isolated by four-dimensional, two-step PCR
and sequenced (see Materials and Methods). A 67,954
bp BAC clone (DBS1203G04, GenBank accession
FJ477859) contained both TLR1A and TLR1B genes,
and a 75,080 bp BAC clone (DBS1405N01, GenBank
accession FJ477862) contained TLR2A and TLR2B
(Additional file 2). The coding sequences of the TLR1
gene family in duck and turkey are encoded by single
exons, as found in the chicken. Sequence alignment
revealed the average percentage identity for pair-wise
comparisons between the orthologues in chicken/duck
to be 85.3 ± 1.5% for nucleotide and 79.8 ± 2.5% for
amino acid sequences, and in chicken/turkey to be 93.0
± 1.2% for nucleotide and 90.3 ± 2.2% for protein
sequences. Sequences for the duck and turkey TLR1

genes were submitted to GenBank (Accessions
FJ477857-FJ477862).
Multiple gene conversion events during the evolution of
the TLR1 gene family

Maximum-likelihood (ML) trees for TLR1-like (Additional file 3, Figure S2A) and TLR2-like (Additional file
3, Figure S2B) genes were initially constructed using all
available vertebrate coding sequences (Additional file 4).
However, the results suggested that paralogues were
more similar than orthologues. Such a result could be
explained if one or more gene conversion events
between paralogues had occurred during their evolution.
To establish whether gene conversion has occurred
between paralogues and to identify its boundaries, we
analyzed the sequences of three groups using GENECONV [33] and SIMPLOT [34]. Group 1: avian
TLR1A/TLR1B (Additional file 5, Figure S3A), group 2:
avian TLR2A/TLR2B (Additional file 5, Figure S3B) and
group 3: mammalian TLR1/TLR6 (Additional file 5, Figure S3C). No gene conversion was detected between
mammalian TLR1/TLR10 or TLR6/TLR10 sequences
(data not shown). The results with GENECONV (Table
1) were highly significant (p values < 10 -27 -10 -66 )
between the paralogues of the same species in groups 1,
2 and 3 providing evidence of gene conversion between
ancestral sequences of paralogues. SIMPLOT also
showed high sequence identity between the paralogues
in these groups (Additional file 6). To examine whether
gene conversion had occurred outside the coding region,
we re-examined multiple alignments including 3`-UTRs
using SIMPLOT. The boundaries of gene conversion
were the same as those without the 3`-UTR except for
Bos taurus TLR1/6 genes (Additional file 7), which
extended into the 3’-UTR for ~200 bp.
We divided the sequences of groups 1, 2 and 3 into
regions predicted to have undergone gene conversion or
not (Table 1). Amino acid sequences encoded by these
regions were used to create separate ML phylogenies
using PHYML [37] for group 1, 2 or 3 genes. A TLR1
or TLR2 orthologue from zebrafish (Danio rerio) was
used as an outgroup gene to root these trees. The ML
trees of group 1, 2 and 3 genes calculated using the
gene conversion free regions (Additional file 8, Figure
S6A, Additional file 9, Figure S7B, Additional file 10,
Figure S8A) were as expected from the species tree. In
contrast, using group 1, 2 and 3 sequences in the
regions predicted to be susceptible to gene conversion,
showed paralogues to be more similar to each other
than the corresponding orthologues (Additional file 8,
Figure S6B, Additional file 9, Figure S7A, S7C). For
most species, except primates, group 3 paralogues were
more similar than orthologues and clustered together in
TLR1/6 pairs within each species (Additional file 10,

Page 5 of 17

Figure S8B). However, for most primates, except the
common marmoset (Callithrix Jacchus), we find orthologues to be more similar, indicating the last gene conversion event occurred prior to the Callithric Jacchus/
Macaca mulatta split, 45 million years ago (Mya).
The sequence identities in specific regions between
orthologues and paralogues are summarized in Additional file 1, Table S2. For groups 1 and 3 sequence
identities in the C-terminal regions of paralogues (within
the same species) were significantly greater than the
corresponding identities between orthologues (p < 0.05).
In contrast, sequence identities between the N-terminal
regions of paralogues were lower than orthologues (p <
0.05). For group 2 sequence identities of N- and Cterminal regions of paralogues were higher than orthologues (p < 0.05). However, the central region was more
conserved between orthologues (p < 0.05).
Amino acid sequences that remained invariant throughout evolution or became identical through convergent evolution are less likely to be encoded by the same codons
than sequences that became identical after gene conversion[21]. To discriminate between these possibilities as the
cause for the greater sequence identity between paralogues, we compared the codon usage of conserved (and
identical) amino acids in group 1, 2 and 3 genes. Overall,
paralogues share 71.5%, 82.5% and 62.0% amino acid identity in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Additional file 1,
Table S2). Analysis of codon usage for conserved amino
acids (Additional file 1, Table S3) in groups 1 and 3 indicated that identical codons were more frequently used in
the C-terminal (96-99%) than in the N-terminal (57-66%)
region. In group 2 identical codons in both N- and Cterminal regions were used more frequently (99%) than
those in the central region (56%).
Taken together these results support a process of gene
conversion rather than gene convergence, as the major
cause for increased sequence identity between
paralogues.
Identification of TLR2 pseudogenes in mammalian
genomes

Two functional copies of TLR2 (TLR2A and TLR2B) were
found in the genomes of chicken, turkey, duck and zebra
finch, extending the earlier observations [2]. To examine
the evolutionary history of the TLR2 gene duplication, we
searched all available vertebrate genome sequences for
possible functional or non-functional sequences. Two
functional copies of TLR2 were also detected in Xenopus
tropicalis but only one functional gene was identified in 5
species of fish and 14 species of mammals. Previous work
[1] detected a TLR2 pseudogene (TLR2P) in tandem with
the functional copy in the genomes of opossum, dog and
human. We have extended this observation to include an
additional five mammalian genomes: chimpanzee,

The boundaries of gene converted regions were based on GENECONV analysis with mismatches allowed (/g1 = 1). The avian species are chicken, turkey, duck
and zebra finch and the mammalian species are cattle, dog, marmoset, horse, hedgehog, human, rhesus monkey, mouse, orangutan, chimpanzee, rat and pig.
The positions of fragments are given with respect to the aligned sequences of avian TLR1A/B, avian TLR2A/B or mammalian TLR1/6. The gene-converted
fragments of the TLR1 gene family members are the C-terminal regions of avian TLR1A/B, avian TLR2A/B, mammalian TLR1/6, and the N-terminal regions of avian
TLR2A/B. “BC KA p-values": Bonferroni-corrected KA (BLAST-like) P values. “Number of Polymorphisms”, “Number of Differences” and “Total Differences” represents
the number of polymorphic sites within gene-converted fragments of each group, number of mismatched sites between gene-converted paralogous fragments
from the same species and total number of mismatched sites between aligned paralogous sequences from the same species, respectively.

orangutan, rhesus monkey, marmoset and horse (Additional file 4). The identification of multiple TLR2 genes
and pseudogenes on many mammals and Xenopus tropicalis suggests an early gene duplication event in the history
of the TLR2 gene family. In most cases, mammalian TLR2
functional genes and pseudogenes formed distinct clusters
(Additional file 11) as expected from the species tree. The
exception was the horse, where its functional gene was
more similar to its pseudogene, suggesting a recent gene

conversion event between these paralogues. This was supported by finding high sequence homology between these
paralogues using SIMPLOT (Additional file 6, Figure S4D).
A complex history of gene duplication and gene
conversion during the evolution of the vertebrate TLR1
gene family

To examine the evolutionary origins of the TLR1 gene
family we used the regions free of gene conversion

defined above (Table 1) to identify orthologues between
avian and mammalian genes. The ML tree based on the
region free of gene conversion of the TLR1 subfamily is
split into two distinct branches (Figure 1). In the first
branch, the mammalian TLR1 and TLR6 genes showed
closest similarity with the avian TLR1B genes (bootstrap
value = 750/1000). For the second branch, the mammalian TLR10 gene clustered with the avian TLR1A genes
(bootstrap value = 657/1000). These conclusions were
supported further by finding high sequence identity
between 3’-UTRs of human TLR1/chicken TLR1B
(Additional file 12, Figure S10A) and 5’-UTRs of human
TLR10/chicken TLR1A (Additional file 12, Figure S10B).
A ML gene tree based on the central sequence free of
gene conversion in the TLR2 subfamily showed the lineage for the single mammalian functional TLR2 gene to

be more closely related to avian TLR2A than TLR2B
(bootstrap value = 513/1000; Figure 2).
The dates for gene duplication were estimated from an
analysis of the sequences free of gene conversion using
CODEML [38] and summarized in Additional file 1,
Table S4. Either global or local clock models of nucleotide substitution were used and calibrated using dates
from the fossil record. For the TLR1 subfamily, we estimate an initial gene duplication event 359 Mya that
gave rise to the TLR1A-TLR10 and TLR1B-TLR1/6
lineages, which was prior to the common ancestor for
birds and mammals 310-325 Mya. Subsequently a
further gene duplication 270-282 Mya gave rise to the
TLR1 and TLR6 genes in mammals. The gene duplication event that gave rise to the TLR2 subfamily was estimated to be 341-356 Mya, which was prior to the

common ancestor for birds and mammals 310-325 Mya.
Similarly, the dates for gene conversion were inferred
from an analysis of sequences predicted to have undergone gene conversion. Predicted dates were very variable
between all species, varying from 0-47 Mya and generally older in mammals (Additional file 1, Table S4).
Positive selection in the coding regions of the TLR1 gene
family in birds and mammals

The estimation of substitution saturation from either the
TLR1 or TLR2 subfamilies suggested the number of
transitions reached a plateau when d > 0.7 (higher than
the number of 160 Mya). Beyond this time, positions
are saturated for pairs of nucleotide sequences (Additional file 13). Based on these comparisons we then
used site-specific CODEML analysis to detect evidence
of positive selection on the full length sequences of
TLR1 gene family orthologues[38,46]: four groups of

mammals (A: 12 TLR1, B: 12 TLR6, C: 15 TLR10 and
D: 27 TLR2 species) and four birds (E: 4 TLR1A, F: 4
TLR1B, G: 4 TLR2A, H: 4 TLR2B species).
Maximum likelihood estimates of parameters under
codon models of variable ω (the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates) values
across sites in the TLR dataset are listed in Table 2. For
mammalian TLR1 parameter estimates under M2A suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵ2 =
3.5. Estimates under M8 suggest 4% of sites to be under
positive selection with ŵs = 2.6. Four sites were inferred
to have ω > 1 with high posterior probabilities (p > 0.9)
under M8: residues 174T, 238A, 286Q and 599S. Similar
estimates were found for TLR6. Estimates under M2A
suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with
ŵ2 = 2.8. Estimates under M8 suggest 4% of sites to be
under positive selection with ŵ s = 2.0. Only, one site
was inferred to have ω > 1 (p > 0.9) under M8: residue

Avian TLR1A and TLR1B parameter estimates under

for the four avian TLR2A/TLR2B sequences. TLR2A
estimates under M2A suggest 4% of sites to be under

ŵs = 2.2. Three sites were inferred to have ω > 1 (p >

Co-evolution of heterodimers between TLR1/6/10 and
TLR2 in mammals

The CAPS analysis between 11 pairs of mammalian
TLR1/2 sequences identified 28 groups of co-evolving
amino acid residues (Additional file 14). Within TLR1,
35 residues were identified as co-evolving with 141 in
TLR2 with correlation coefficients between 0.50 and
0.82 (P < 0.001). Most co-evolving residues were located
in the extracellular region (33 in TLR1 and 130 in
TLR2) and far fewer (2 in TLR1 and 8 in TLR2) in cytoplasmic regions. Similarly, we identified 63 groups of coevolving amino acid residues using 12 pairs of TLR6/2
sequences (Additional file 15). Within TLR6, 76 amino
acid residues were identified as co-evolving with 300
amino acid residues within TLR2 with correlation coefficients between 0.50 and 0.88 (P < 0.001). All of the
inter-co-evolving sites of TLR1 and TLR6 were distributed in extracellular regions. Finally, we identified 76
groups of co-evolving amino acid residues using 12

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/149

pairs of TLR10/2 sequences (Additional file 16). Within
TLR10, 91 amino acid residues were identified as coevolving with 146 amino acid residues within TLR2 with
correlation coefficients between 0.50 and 0.95 (P <
0.001). Most co-evolving residues within TLR10 were
located in the extracellular region (56 in TLR10 and 102
in TLR2). However, inter-co-evolving sites were also
detected in transmembrane (1 in TLR10 and 1 in TLR2)
and cytoplasmic (2 in TLR10 and 4 in TLR2) regions.
We also looked for evidence of intra-molecular co-evolution using intra-protein CAPS analysis with the
sequences of TLR1 family genes. Within TLR1, 111 amino
acids from the extracellular region and 12 from the cytoplasmic region were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients between 0.72 and 1.00 (p < 0.001).
However, there was no evidence of co-evolving amino
acids from an analysis of 27 mammalian TLR2 sequences
(p < 0.001). Within TLR6, 130 amino acids from the extracellular region and 14 from the cytoplasmic region which
were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients
between 0.61 and 0.99 (p < 0.001). Within TLR10, 29
amino acids from the extracellular region, 1 from the
transmembrane domain and 6 from the cytoplasmic
region were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients between 0.75 and 1.00 (p < 0.001).

Discussion
TLRs play a crucial role in the host’s early defense
against invading pathogens [47,48]. In the past few years
our understanding of the mechanisms by which TLRs
recognize pathogens and induce distinct signaling pathways has increased significantly, particularly in mammals
[49,50]. The tertiary structures of various TLRs and
ligand complexes have also been determined [16,51]. In
contrast, studies on avian TLRs have been very limited
[2,15,19,20,52-54]. In this paper, we examined the evolution and selective constraints on members of the TLR1
gene family in both birds and mammals. Here we discuss the details of these evolutionary origins and the significance of selection constraints on the structure and
function of this family of cell surface receptors.
Evolutionary origins of the TLR1 gene family

Previous phylogenetic analyses of the TLR1 gene family
suggested there had been many independent gene duplications in birds and mammals [1,2,23]. This contrasts
with the TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR7 families where
gene trees generally recapitulate species trees [1].
Detailed analysis presented in this paper, together with
the previous studies by Kruithof et al. and Cormican et
al, [21,22] suggests gene conversion events between
paralogues had occurred during the evolution of the
TLR1 gene family in both birds and mammals, giving
rise to ambiguous orthologous relationships. We show

Page 10 of 17

that gene conversion events have occurred independently in most avian and mammalian lineages during
the last 45 million years. Generally gene conversion
events have been more recent in birds (0-20 Mya) than
mammals (5-45 Mya). Gene conversion occurred in the
mammalian TLR1/TLR6 genes 42-44 Mya in the common ancestor of four primate species (human, chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus monkey) and independently
in other mammals. Interestingly, gene conversion in the
N- and C-terminal regions of avian TLR2A/TLR2B may
have occurred independently. For example, in the duck
we predict these events to be separated by 14 million
years. These results suggest that N- and C-terminal
regions of avian TLR2 genes may be under different
selective constraints.
To understand more about the evolutionary origins of
the TLR1 gene family, we constructed gene trees based
on sequences from the TLR1 or TLR2 subfamilies free
from gene conversion. For the TLR1 subfamily, two
groups of orthologues were defined in birds and mammals as avian TLR1A/mammalian TLR10 and avian
TLR1B/mammalian TLR1/TLR6, predicted to be the
product of a gene duplication event 359 Mya. Subsequently in mammals, a further gene duplication event
270-282 Mya gave rise to the paralogues TLR1/6. This
orthology between TLR1A/TLR10 and TLR1B/TLR1/
TLR6 was strengthened by finding additional sequence
identity in the flanking, non-coding regions of avian and
mammalian genes (Additional file 12). Similarly, phylogenetic analysis strongly indicated that TLR2A to be
orthologous to the functional TLR2 gene in mammals,
sharing a common ancestor with TLR2B 341-356 Mya,
prior to the split of reptiles and mammals 310-325 Mya.
This analysis prompted us to search the genomes of
mammals for TLR2 paralogues, possibly missed by current annotations. TLR2P was found in tandem with the
functional TLR2 gene in human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus monkey, marmoset, horse and dog. Together
with the predicted time of divergence of the TLR2A/B
genes (341-356 Mya), these results supposed that the
TLR2B/2P genes were orthologues. In mammals, TLR2P
may have recently been functional and independently
pseudogenised in each species, possibly due to selection
pressure against duplicate TLR2 genes. If true, this
would suggest that different selective constraints are acting on the duplicate TLR2 genes in birds. This would be
consistent with the more broad responses found in avian
TLR1/2 heterodimers, possibly in response to a more
diverse set of pathogens.
Functional and structural significance of selection
constraints within the TLR1 family

Gene conversion is a process of non-reciprocal transfer
of genetic information between genes. It is favored by

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/149

high sequence homology, for example between tandem,
duplicated genes and leads to their concerted evolution.
Such a process has already been proposed to take place
between the closely related TLR1/6 genes in mammals
and the TLR2A/B genes in chicken and zebra finch
[21,22]. Structural analysis based on the reported crystal
structure of the TLR1-subfamily genes in human and
mouse [17,51] suggested that gene conversion regions
between the paralogues (avian TLR1A/B, mammalian
TLR1/6) were mapped to a single region ranging from
LRR14 to the TIR domain in birds and from LRR16 to
the TIR domain in mammals (Figure 3A and 3B). For
the TLR2 subfamily, gene conversion in avian TLR2A/B
mapped to two regions; the first stretching from the Nterminus to LRR8 and the second from LRR15 to the
TIR domain (Figure 3C). These results suggest that gene
conversion may have played an important role in maintaining the conservation of the dimerization domain,
transmembrane domain and the C-terminal intracellular
TIR domain in TLR1-gene family. This may have been a
selective advantage by maintaining co-evolution with
binding partners, such as MyD88, TRIF, TIRAF and
TRAM required for intracellular signaling [49,50]. In
birds, an additional region of gene conversion was
mapped in an N-terminal domain of the TLR2

subfamily. The function of this region is unknown and
may bind to an uncharacterized binding partner.
Many genes of the immune system and those involved
in host-pathogen interactions, such as the MHC complex, TRIM5alpha and HAVCR1, and show significant
evidence of positive selection [10,55,56]. However, work
so far suggests that most amino acid sites in TLRs are
subject to purifying selection [1]. Domain-switching
experiments between TLR1/6 showed the LRR9-12
modules to play crucial roles in lipopeptide recognition
[57]. These modules constitute a critical portion of the
central domain and form the ligand binding domain in
TLR1/6/10. They also represent the most divergent
regions and are likely to be subject to positive selection
in response to pathogen infection. In mammals, our
analysis detected positively selected (PS) sites in exposed
regions in both TLR1 (238A, 286Q Figure 3A) and
TLR6 (296D Figure 3B) at similar regions (suggesting
both regions are functionally important, and possibly
share a common function) in or near the central domain
but not in TLR2. There were other residues inferred to
be subject to positive selection, in the extracellular
domain of TLR1 (174T in LRR6 Figure 3A), TLR6 (90L
in LRR2 Figure 3B) and TLR2 (453G), and in the transmembrane domain of TLR1 (599S p > 0.99) and the
TIR domain of TLR2 (766M). Changes in these sites
may modify the ligand-binding activity of the TLR1/2
and TLR6/2 complexes. These results suggest that in
mammals, changes in the ligand-binding activity of
TLR1 and TLR6 may be modified through positive
selection. In contrast to mammals, PS sites were
detected in both avian TLR2A (304N in LRR10) and
TLR2B (260V in LRR9), which map onto an exposed
region (Figure 3C) in or near the ligand-binding domain
and shows species-specific response to lipopeptides. The
other sites are located at homologous positions in
TLR2A (184T, 506S) and TLR2B (175T, 496S) in the
extracellular domain at LRR6 and LRR19, respectively
(Figure 3C), also suggesting those regions shared important functions. These results suggest that in birds,
changes in the ligand-binding activity of TLR2A/B may
be modified through positive selection, which contrasts
with mammals where this appears not to be case. Also,
unlike mammals, we did not find any sites showing high
posterior probabilities in either the TLR1A/B molecules.
These results could be due to lack of power in the small
samples or they may indicate a difference in the selective constraints between TLR1 family proteins in birds
and mammals.
TLR2 initiates a potent immune response by recognizing diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides. Its ligand
specificity is controlled by whether it heterodimerizes
with TLR1/6/10 [16-18]. Therefore extensive proteinprotein interactions between TLR1/6/10 and TLR2 are

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/149

to be expected, which should be reflected in a network
of co-evolving amino acids. Intra-molecular CAPS analysis detected extensive co-evolution between residues
within TLR1, 6 and 10 consistent with their ability to
form homodimers. TLR2 does not form homodimers,
which was reflected in the lack of evidence for any coevolution between amino acid residues even with the
alignment of sequences from 27 species. Inter-molecular
CAPS analysis found extensive co-evolution between
amino acids in TLR2 complexes with TLR1/2/10. Interestingly, amino acid residues from different domains
within TLR2 were observed as co-evolving with the
same residues in TLR1, TLR6 or TLR10, suggesting that
there is a high codependence of evolution between the
functional domains of TLR2.
Most residues within TLR1 identified as co-evolving
with TLR2 were located in the extracellular region (33
TLR1 and 130 TLR2) and far fewer (1 TLR1 and 2
TLR2) between cytoplasmic regions. Similar numbers of
co-evolving residues were detected throughout the
dimerization domains of TLR1 (7/76) and TLR2 (8/81).
TLR2 however, has almost twice the number of co-evolving sites (17/90) in the lipid pocket compared to the
lipid channel in TLR1 (10/82), consistent with the predicted interactions based on tertiary structures [16].
There are also five other small clusters of co-evolving
amino acid residues, the largest involves residues in the
lipid channel of TLR1 and the dimerization domain of
TLR2 (Figure 4A) suggesting structural/functional codependence. In addition, the TIR domains of TLR1/
TLR2 show co-evolution between residue 653 in TLR1
and residues 709 and 769 in TLR2. These residues are
located between highly conserved regions thought to be
important in TIR signaling [58].
TLR10 has been shown to have a similar ligand specificity and structure to TLR1, but to use a distinct signaling pathway in these and other TLRs [18]. Like TLR1,
TLR10 has an extensive network of co-evolving sites
with TLR2 in the extracellular region (56 TLR10 and
102 TLR2) but has some sites in both the transmembrane (1 TLR10 and 1 TLR2) and cytoplasmic (2 TLR10
and 4 TLR2) regions. Computational modeling and
mutational analysis of the TLR10/TLR2 complex [18]
suggested the presence of a TLR2 dimer interface and
the lipopeptide-binding channel homologous to that
found in TLR1. We also find there is a cluster of 26 coevolving sites (Figure 5) involving four residues in ligand
binding and two in dimerization domains. Interestingly,
there were many more co-evolving sites within the TIR
domain of the TLR10/TLR2 complex than found in
TLR1/TLR2. Both complexes bind MyD88 but the signaling pathway for TLR10 seems to be distinct from
other TLRs. The extra constraints detected in the TIR

(2009). Co-evolving amino acids are shown as either network
diagrams (displayed using Cytoscape) or mapped onto tertiary
structures of protein domains (using PyMOL) for A: human TLR1/
TLR2 and B: mouse TLR6/TLR2 complexes. In the network diagrams
the TLR1/TLR6 and TLR2 amino acids are depicted by ellipse and
rectangle shapes, respectively. Cyan, pale green and pink amino
acid residues represent the ligand binding domain, a helices near
the ligand binding domain and the extracellular domain,
respectively. The color of lines in A(i) and B(i) represents the
correlation coefficients of co-evolving amino acids. In the tertiary
structures the peptide fragments from TLR1/TLR6 and TLR2 are in
pale green and yellow, respectively. Amino acids joined by the
same color of the broken lines are clustered to the one evolutionary
group.

domain may represent binding sites for, as yet, uncharacterized proteins.
TLR6 recognizes diacylated lipopeptides by the formation of a heterodimer with TLR2. Previous analysis suggested that TLR6 did not have a lipid-binding channel
as found in TLR1 [17]. This correlates with the lack of
co-evolving sites in the homologous region in TLR6 but
extensive co-evolution within the lipid binding pocket in
TLR2 (29/90 residues). Protein-protein interactions are
stronger in TLR6/TLR2 than TLR1/TLR2 where the
dimerization interface in TLR6/TLR2 is 80% larger than
TLR1/TLR2 [51]. This is consistent with there being
more co-evolving sites in TLR2 (35/81) than TLR6 (6/
79), which has a similar number to that found in TLR1
(7/76). There are also two other small clusters of coevolving amino acid residues, the largest also involving
residues in the lipid pocket of TLR2 and residues (459,
468, 470 and 490) elsewhere in the TLR6 protein (Figure 4B), which may represent other sites of functional

involved in ligand binding and dimerization. This analysis also predicts many other sites of functional and/or
structural significance, but further investigations are
required to define these roles. This analysis also suggests
divergence in the function of avian and mammalian
TLR1 gene family proteins, each under different selective constraints. In mammals, it appears that TLR1 and
6 are subject to positive selection more significant than
TLR2, where in birds the reverse seems to be the case
for TLR2-like genes. In contrast, the TLR10/TLR2 complex does not appear to be subject to positive selection.
Our phylogenetic and structural analyses of vertebrate
TLR1 family members has clarified their evolutionary
history and predicts amino acid residues likely to be
important in their primary function in the host’s defense
against invading pathogens.

and/or structural significance, but this awaits further
investigation.

Conclusions
The TLR1 gene family was previously thought to have
arisen by a series of independent gene duplications in
multiple vertebrates. However, we show here that the
true history of gene duplication events has been masked
by gene conversion between paralogous genes. Our
detailed phylogenetic analysis not only clarifies the gene
gains and losses within the TLR1 families of birds and
mammals, but also defines orthologues between these
vertebrates. TLR1 and 6 in mammals are the orthologues of avian TLR1B, and TLR10 in mammals is the
orthologue of TLR1A. The functional TLR2 gene in
mammals is the orthologue of the avian TLR2A genes.
The mammalian orthologue of avian TLR2B has been
lost in most mammals, with pseudogene fragments
(TLR2P) present in a few species. In mammals, we predict amino acid sites under positive selection in TLR1,
TLR2 and TLR6 but not TLR10 and detect co-evolution
of amino acid residues between TLR1/TLR2 proteins
that may be required to maintain their ability to form
functional TLR1/2 complexes. In birds, we were able to
predict positive selection in the TLR2A/B genes at functionally significant amino acid residues but not in
TLR1A/B. In both birds and mammals these amino acid
residues include known structural and functional sites,

Bootstrap values are only shown for nodes with large than 50% support.
A: TLR1 subfamily, avian TLR1A/B, and mammalian TLR1/6/10 clades are
highlighted in orange, green, pink, lilac and cyan, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis derived from full length peptide sequences
suggested that mammalian TLR1 subfamily diverged after the split of
mammals and birds. In mammals, one duplication event may have
occurred after the split of birds and mammals, but before the divergence
of Montremes and Theria, which led to the TLR10 and TLR1/6 lineages.
Subsequently, a further duplication event may have occurred during the
divergence of Montremes/Theria to Laurasiatheria/Euarchontoglires
giving rise to the TLR1 and TLR6 genes. In birds, a single duplication
event prior to the split of Passeriforme and Galloanserae gave rise to the
TLR1A and TLR1B genes. B: TLR2 subfamily, chicken TLR2A/B, turkey
TLR2A/B, zebra finch TLR2A/B and mammalian TLR2 clades are
highlighted in pink, cyan, green and lilac, respectively. The phylogenetic
tree suggested that many recent independent duplications gave rise to
the TLR2A and TLR2B genes in birds.

using SIMPLOT (Lole et al. 1999) with a sliding window size of 200 bp,
step size of 20 bp, 1000 pseudo-replicates and neighbour-joining tree
analysis. The avian and mammalian sequences are listed in Additional file
4, and the N, Central and C regions are defined in Table 1. The query
sequences for panels A, B, C and D are GgalTLR1A, GgalTLR2A, BtauTLR1
and EcabTLR2P. The vertical axis is the % of permuted trees from 1000
bootstrap replicates. The horizontal axis indicates the nucleotide
positions in base pairs. In panel D the suffixes “C” and “P” represent the
homologous regions in TLR2 for functional genes and pseudogenes,
respectively. A: TLR1A compared with TLR1B in birds. The N region of the
query sequence (GgalTLR1A) is more similar to that of its orthologue
(MgalTLR1A) than its paralogue (GgalTLR1B). However, the case in the C
region is the reverse. B: TLR2A compared with TLR2B in birds. Both the N
and C regions of the query sequence (GgalTLR2A) are more similar in the
orthologue (MgalTLR2A) than its paralogue (GgalTLR2B), whereas, the
reverse is true in the Central region. C: TLR1 compared with TLR6 in
mammals. The N region of the query sequence (BtauTLR1) is more
similar to its orthologue (EeurTLR1) than its paralogue (BtauTLR6).
However, the case in the C region is the reverse. D: TLR2 pseudogenes
compared with TLR2 functional genes in mammals. The query sequence
(EcabTLR2P) is more conserved with the C region (which is defined
according to the corresponding region of birds as shown in Table 1) of
its paralogue (EcabTLR2C) than its orthologues (TLR2P of the other 5
species). In summary, sequence similarity of coding and pseudogene
sequences of the TLR1 gene family indicate that orthologues are more
like each other than the paralogue from the same species in the N

region. However, the reverse is true in the C region, thus suggesting that
gene conversion occurred in the C region. For TLR2, paralogues from the
same species are more similar to each other than their orthologues in
both the N and C regions, whereas, the case in the Central region is the
reverse, implying that the N and C region have undergone gene
conversion.

were calculated using the SIMPLOT, as described in Figure S4. A: TLR1A
compared with TLR1B in birds with GgalTLR1A (coding sequence: 1-2462
bp) as query. The N- and 3`-UTR regions of the query sequence are more
similar to the corresponding regions of its orthologue (MgalTLR1A) than
its paralogue (GgalTLR1B). However, the reverse is true in the C region. B
and C: TLR1 compared with TLR6 in mammals, with SscrTLR1 (coding
sequence: 10-2407 bp) and BtauTLR1 (coding sequence: 10-2394 bp) as
queries, respectively. The N- and 3`-UTR regions of the query sequence
in panel B (SscrTLR1) are more like the corresponding regions of its
orthologue (BtauTLR1) than its paralogue (SscrTLR6), and the reverse is
true in the C region. For panel C, the N region of the query sequence
(BtauTLR1) is more similar to its orthologue (EeurTLR1) than its paralogue
(BtauTLR6). However unike any other comparison both the C- and 3`-UTR
regions of the query sequence (BtauTLR1) are more like to the
corresponding regions of its paralogue (BtauTLR6) than any of its
orthologues (TLR1 of the other 12 species). In summary, sequence
similarity of coding and 3`-UTR sequences of the TLR1 subfamily
indicates that orthologues are more similar to each other than the
paralogue from the same species in both of the N- and 3`-UTR regions.
However, the reverse is true in the C region. These results suggest gene
conversion usually occurred in the coding, C-region of members of the
TLR1 subfamily. The exception was BtauTLR1, where gene conversion
appears to have extended from the coding C-region into the non-coding
3’-UTR for ~200 bp.
