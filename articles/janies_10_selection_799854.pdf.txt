Abstract
Background: In Spring 2009, a novel reassortant strain of H1N1 influenza A emerged as a lineage distinct from
seasonal H1N1. On June 11, the World Heath Organization declared a pandemic - the first since 1968. There are
currently two main branches of H1N1 circulating in humans, a seasonal branch and a pandemic branch. The
primary treatment method for pandemic and seasonal H1N1 is the antiviral drug Tamiflu® (oseltamivir). Although
many seasonal H1N1 strains around the world are resistant to oseltamivir, initially, pandemic H1N1 strains have
been susceptible to oseltamivir. As of February 3, 2010, there have been reports of resistance to oseltamivir in 225
cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza. The evolution of resistance to oseltamivir in pandemic H1N1 could be due to
point mutations in the neuraminidase or a reassortment event between seasonal H1N1 and pandemic H1N1
viruses that provide a neuraminidase carrying an oseltamivir-resistant genotype to pandemic H1N1.
Results: Using phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase sequences, we show that both seasonal and pandemic
lineages of H1N1 are evolving to direct selective pressure for resistance to oseltamivir. Moreover, seasonal lineages
of H1N1 that are resistant to oseltamivir co-circulate with pandemic H1N1 throughout the globe. By combining
phylogenetic and geographic data we have thus far identified 53 areas of co-circulation where reassortment can
occur. At our website POINTMAP, http://pointmap.osu.edu we make available a visualization and an application for
updating these results as more data are released.
Conclusions: As oseltamivir is a keystone of preparedness and treatment for pandemic H1N1, the potential for
resistance to oseltamivir is an ongoing concern. Reassortment and, more likely, point mutation have the potential
to create a strain of pandemic H1N1 against which we have a reduced number of treatment options.

Background
In Spring 2009, a novel reassortant strain of H1N1 influenza A emerged as a lineage distinct from seasonal
H1N1. On June 11, the World Heath Organization
declared a pandemic - the first since 1968 [1]. There are
currently two main branches of H1N1 circulating in
humans, a seasonal branch and a pandemic branch. The
primary treatment for patients infected with influenza A
is the antiviral drug Tamiflu® (oseltamivir). Resistance to
oseltamivir can occur due to a point mutation in any of
several regions of the neuraminidase protein of the

virus. Although many seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated
around the world are resistant to oseltamivir [2,3], initially, most pandemic H1N1 isolates have been susceptible to oseltamivir. As of February 3, 2010, there have
been reports of resistance to oseltamivir in 225 cases of
H1N1 pandemic influenza [4]. Resistance to oseltamivir
in pandemic H1N1 can present itself in non-exclusive
patterns at various scales: 1) sporadic evolution within
an infected patient in response to treatment [5], 2) evolution of resistance to oseltamivir in an infected patient
infected and transfer of the strain among personal contacts [6] 3) maintenance of a genotype that confers
resistance to oseltamivir in a viral lineage due to selection pressure [7] and or 4) a reassortment event
between oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 and

pandemic H1N1 viruses. This event could provide a
neuraminidase segment that carries a genotype that confers oseltamivir resistance to pandemic H1N1 [7].
Resistance to oseltamivir in H1N1 can occur due to a
point mutation at one of several sites in the neuraminidase (NA) protein (e.g., D79G, S247G or S247N, and
H275Y) [8]. Resistance to Relenza® (zanamivir) in H1N1
can occur due to point mutations including H126N or
Q136K in NA [8,9]. We examined sequence diversity at
key sites, selective pressure on NA codons, and geographic co-circulation among H1N1 lineages causing
seasonal and pandemic influenza. Previous global surveys on seasonal H1N1 found low levels of resistance to
oseltamivir in the first three years of their use up to
August 31, 2002 [10]. We focused on high quality data
for NA genetic sequence, geographic, and temporal
information. We removed laboratory and host-adapted
isolates, as well as isolates that were partially sequenced
or caused mutations that broke the reading frame of the
multiple sequence alignment. We included 1210 seasonal H1N1 NA segments isolated around the world
between September 2004 and December 2009 (additional files 1 and 2). For pandemic H1N1, we included
1824 NA segments isolated between March 2009 and
December 2009 (additional files 3 and 4). We developed
a web application, called POINTMAP http://pointmap.
osu.edu, to plot the place of isolation of viruses and to
distribute our data and results. Our data reflect a nonoverlapping set of sequences available in data repositories including: The National Institutes of Health’s
GenBank http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and The Global Initiative on Sharing of All Influenza Data (GISAID; http://
www.gisaid.org).

Results
The best likelihood scores were as follows: for the pandemic H1N1 dataset ln - 9857.691488 (additional file 5)
and for the seasonal H1N1 dataset ln -13871.895684
(additional file 6).
To detect positive selection we used the criterion of
statistically significant bias of non-synonymous mutations (dN) relative to synonymous mutations (dS) at a
codon [11]. For the seasonal H1N1 lineage, we see evidence for positive natural selection for resistance to
oseltamivir conferred by the genotype 275Y (dN-dS =
6.097; p = 0.035). The codon corresponding to amino
acid position 275 is the sole region on the NA segment
currently exhibiting significant dN-dS bias.
In the pandemic clade of H1N1, we see evidence for
positive natural selection for resistance to oseltamivir as
conferred by genotype 275Y (dN-dS = 7.69; p = 0.006).
There is also significant dN-dS bias at codon 248 (dNdS = 5.18; p = 0.031). Of the 225 reports of cases of
resistance to oseltamivir among pandemic H1N1 [4], a

Page 2 of 6

subset of 28 isolates has been sequenced and put in
public databases as of January 4, 2010. Based on our NA
phylogeny, the members of the H1N1 pandemic lineage
containing the 275Y NA genotype include: isolates from
patients infected with pandemic H1N1 and treated with
oseltamivir in the United States (Washington State) [5],
two clades of isolates restricted to Japan (Yamaguchi
plus Chiba; Shiga plus Niigata), a clade of isolates with a
worldwide distribution (Japan, Denmark, plus the United
States), and various unrelated isolates from China, Israel,
Africa, the United States, Japan, and Europe. There are
also reports of oseltamivir resistance in pandemic H1N1
isolates from Singapore but their NA has not yet been
sequenced.
In the case of seasonal H1N1, some workers have dismissed the possibility of H1N1 responding to use of
drugs based on low sales of oseltamivir in Norway
between 2002 and 2007 [12]. However, large numbers of
doses of oseltamivir have been purchased by many entities around the world. These doses have been recently
used widely in treatment and prophylaxis of mild cases
[13], especially in Japan [14]. Moreover, any illegal trade
and use of drugs around the world will be difficult to
measure. There are reports of evolution of resistance
and spread among patients as a result of the use of oseltamivir in prophylaxis [5,6].
The mutations D79G, S247G, and S247N in NA also
confer resistance to oseltamivir [8]. For amino acid positions 79 and 247 there is very little variation in seasonal
H1N1. For amino acid position 79, most of the seasonal
clade contains the wild type, 79D. The pandemic clade
largely contains 79S. For position 247 in the seasonal
clade, most isolates contain the wild type, 247S. Two
seasonal isolates from humans in Montserrat contains
247N. Regarding position 247 in the pandemic clade, all
isolates thus far sequenced and put into public databases
contain the wild type, 247S.
The mutations H126N or Q136K in NA confer resistance to zanamivir in H1N1 [8,9]. For amino acid position 126 in NA, the seasonal clade contains the wild
type, 126H. The pandemic clade contains largely 126P,
which merits further study.
Due to the increasing importance of zanamivir, we
provide a Keyhole Mark-up Language (KML) file in
which we mapped isolates from Australia, Thailand,
New Zealand, Brazil, Nicaragua, and Macau that contain
the genotype 136K in NA for the seasonal clade (additional file 7). The pandemic clade uniformly contains
the wild type, 136Q in NA.
As either selection or reassortment can lead to strains
of pandemic H1N1 that are resistant to drugs, we complement analyses of selection with a map of co-occurrence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 and
pandemic H1N1 (Figure 1). We found 53 regions in

which these influenza strains co-circulate (Table 1). A
subset of six of these 53 regions contains pandemic
H1N1 isolates with NA segments that carry the genotype 275Y in NA. This subset includes regions within
Japan and the United States. To precisely illustrate the
53 areas of co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic
H1N1 we distribute a KML file (see http://pointmap.
osu.edu or additional file 8).

Discussion
Here we demonstrate positive selective pressure for
resistance to oseltamivir conferred by genotype 275Y in
NA in both seasonal H1N1 and pandemic H1N1. This
result shows the importance of judicious use of antiviral
medication. H275Y mutations in seasonal H1N1 began
to appear in 2007. A lineage of seasonal H1N1 became
fixed for the genotype 275Y in Europe in 2008 and
spread across the globe. H275Y mutations began to
appear in clades within the pandemic lineage of H1N1
in June 2009. Reports of resistance cases have steadily
increased through 2009 [4] and more sequence data is
expected.
As seasonal H1N1 is an older lineage, we expect selection for resistance to oseltamivir and subsequent fixation
of 275Y in seasonal H1N1 lineages to foreshadow the
evolutionary trajectory of pandemic H1N1. Based on
sequence data available to date, pandemic H1N1 is not
yet fixed for 275Y in NA. However, there is enough
non-synonymous mutation in pandemic H1N1 to measure positive selection with statistical significance.
Codon 275 is the only position exhibiting dN-dS bias
in the NA segment of seasonal H1N1. This contradicts

the argument that codon 275 is not changing due to
direct selection but rather is genetically linked ("hitchhiking”) to another position that is associated with a
phenotype other than drug-resistance that is under positive selection [15]. In the NA segment of pandemic
H1N1, there are two sites exhibiting dN-dS bias: codon
275 and codon 248. Thus we examined the possibility of
genetic linkage within NA. In doing so, we can also
refute the hitch-hiking argument for the evolution of
NA in pandemic H1N1. Under genetic linkage, one
would expect co-variation between H275Y and N248D.
However in contrast, the mutations N248D and H275Y
have very different phylogenetic distributions. The genotype 275Y, as described above, occurs in 28 isolates in a
few clades and multiple unrelated lineages. The N248D
mutation occurs in a handful of isolates from the origins
of the pandemic, but in later isolates the 248D genotype
becomes fixed in an immense clade of over 1000 isolates. A reversal mutation (D248N) occurs in another
large clade at the crown of the tree. The N248D mutation is reported to alter an antibody recognition site and
thus has implications for vaccine development [16]. Phenotypes associated with this polymorphism merit further
study.
In addition, a reassortment event in a co-infected host
could lead to emergence of a drug-resistant strain of
epidemic H1N1. Our map illustrates that there is abundant opportunity for co-infection and reassortment of a
NA segment from oseltamivir resistant seasonal H1N1
ancestors to pandemic H1N1 descendants. There are
reports of mixed infections of pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza viruses in China [GenBank: CY048942].

This lends support to the hypothesis that reassortment
has the potential for the evolution of drug resistance
and merits further study.
Based on limited testing, there are reports that pandemic H1N1 is becoming dominant in the Western
hemisphere, Japan, and Europe. However in China, seasonal strains remain in co-circulation with pandemic
H1N1 [17]. If seasonal H1N1 becomes infrequent, the
possibility of reassortment diminishes, as co-infections
will be rare. However the short-term lull in seasonal
H1N1 activity may not signal its complete extinction. A
study posted as a knol (unit of knowledge) on co-infection in ferrets that found no reassortment [18]. If ferret
studies model the behavior of the viruses in human
cells, this result conflicts with the hypothesis that reassortment will occur between pandemic and seasonal
H1N1.
Mathematical models have suggested that during a
pandemic, treatment with more than one drug may be
an effective “hedging” strategy to abate widespread drug
resistance among the population while still treating
patients [19]. These models have been challenged by
others who are skeptical about the presence of direct
selection on the drug target [20]. Here we demonstrate
direct selection for resistance to oseltamivir in both seasonal and pandemic lineages of H1N1. We also show
that resistance to zanamivir is currently low, thus use of
this drug is currently a sound alternative to oseltamivir.

Conclusions
Judicious prescription of antivirals is important in order
to maintain the ability to use antivirals to treat high-risk
patients. Furthermore, precise diagnosis of influenza A
informed by point-of-care genotyping of the pathogen
can help target the proper antiviral to each patient. This
study illustrates how genomics technology, bioinformatics, and geographic information systems can be of
immediate applicability to personalize treatment of
infectious diseases. In addition to data collection, analyses are needed to turn raw data into prospective public
health intelligence on drug resistance in a regionally
specific and easy to visualize manner.
Methods
We collected sequence data from GenBank http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and GISAID http://www.gisaid.org.

Janies et al. International Journal of Health Geographics 2010, 9:13

Geographic and temporal information was extracted
from the ‘TSeq_orgname’ field in GenBank’s TinySeq
XML records or from the FASTA label of a GISAID
record.
We converted place names to latitude and longitude
in decimal degrees corresponding to the centroid of the
place based on queries to geonames http://geonames.
org. We performed multiple sequence alignments on
nucleotide sequences using default parameters with
CLUSTALW-MPI (version 0.13) [21]. We then ran
MODELTEST version 3.8 [22] as implemented in PAUP
version 4.0b10 [23] to choose best-fit model models of
nucleotide substitution based on the Akaike Information
Criterion not using branch lengths as parameters. As
suggested by MODELTEST, phylogenetic analyses were
for both datasets were conducted under the GTRGAMMAI model of nucleotide substitution. Both datasets
were run for 100 replicates with RAXML-HPC-MPI
(version 4.0.4) [24]. Analyses of selection were performed using single likelihood ancestor counting
(SLAC) with HYPHY (version 0.9920070619 beta) [11]
to measure synonymous and non-synonymous substitution for each codon at the p < = 0.05 level for statistical
significance. For analyses of selection we used all isolates
in each dataset.
We used the following criteria for analysis of co-circulation. We selected only the clade of the seasonal lineage
in which the genotype 275Y (conferring resistance to
oseltamivir) is fixed. We reduced the oseltamivir-resistant fixed seasonal clade further by using isolates from
2009. We compared latitude and longitude data from
the 2009 oseltamivir-resistant fixed seasonal set to all
latitude and longitude data for the pandemic lineage
except for the outgroup.
The outgroup for seasonal data was [GISAID:
EPI182496] A/Berlin/6/2006 and for pandemic data was
[GISAID: EPI161647] A/swine/Italy/247578/2004. Outgroups were discovered based on searches of larger
datasets spanning back to 1918.
