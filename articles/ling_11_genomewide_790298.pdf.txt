Genome-wide analysis of WRKY gene family in
Cucumis sativus

Abstract
Background: WRKY proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators in higher plant. They are involved in
many biological processes, such as plant development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.
Prior to the present study, only one full-length cucumber WRKY protein had been reported. The recent publication
of the draft genome sequence of cucumber allowed us to conduct a genome-wide search for cucumber WRKY
proteins, and to compare these positively identified proteins with their homologs in model plants, such as
Arabidopsis.
Results: We identified a total of 55 WRKY genes in the cucumber genome. According to structural features of their
encoded proteins, the cucumber WRKY (CsWRKY) genes were classified into three groups (group 1-3). Analysis of
expression profiles of CsWRKY genes indicated that 48 WRKY genes display differential expression either in their
transcript abundance or in their expression patterns under normal growth conditions, and 23 WRKY genes were
differentially expressed in response to at least one abiotic stresses (cold, drought or salinity). The expression profile
of stress-inducible CsWRKY genes were correlated with those of their putative Arabidopsis WRKY (AtWRKY) orthologs,
except for the group 3 WRKY genes. Interestingly, duplicated group 3 AtWRKY genes appear to have been under
positive selection pressure during evolution. In contrast, there was no evidence of recent gene duplication or
positive selection pressure among CsWRKY group 3 genes, which may have led to the expressional divergence of
group 3 orthologs.
Conclusions: Fifty-five WRKY genes were identified in cucumber and the structure of their encoded proteins, their
expression, and their evolution were examined. Considering that there has been extensive expansion of group 3
WRKY genes in angiosperms, the occurrence of different evolutionary events could explain the functional
divergence of these genes.

Background
Transcription factors exhibit sequence-specific DNAbinding and are capable of activating or repressing transcription of downstream target genes. In plants, WRKY
proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors
that are involved in various physiological processes. Proteins in this family contain at least one highly conserved
signature domain of about 60 amino acid residues,
which includes the conserved WRKYGQK sequence followed by a zinc finger motif, located in the C-terminal
region [1]. The WRKY domain facilitates binding of the
proteins to the W box or the SURE (sugar-responsive
cis-element) in the promoter regions of target genes

[2,3]. As deduced from nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) analysis of the C-terminal WRKY domain of
Arabidopsis WRKY4 (AtWRKY4), the conserved
WRKYGQK sequence of WRKY domains is directly
involved in DNA binding [4]. WRKY proteins can be
classified into three groups (1, 2 and 3) based on the
number of WRKY domains and the pattern of the zincfinger motif. Group 1 proteins typically contain two
WRKY domains including a C2H2 motif. Group 2 proteins have a single WRKY domain and a C2H2 zinc-finger motif and can be further divided into five subgroups
(2a-2e) based on the phylogeny of the WRKY domains.
Group 3 proteins also have a single WRKY domain, but
their zinc-finger-like motif is C2-H-C [1].
Since the cloning of the first cDNA encoding a WRKY
protein, SPF1 from sweet potato [5], a large number of

WRKY proteins have been experimentally identified
from several plant species [6-17], and have been shown
to be involved in various physiological processes under
normal growth conditions and under various stress condition [18]. It has been well documented that WRKY
proteins play a key role in plant defense against various
biotic stresses including bacterial, fungal and viral
pathogens [19-27]. They also play important regulatory
roles in developmental processes, such as trichome
initiation [28], embryo morphogenesis [29], senescence
[30], and some signal transduction processes mediated
by plant hormones such as gibberellic acid [31], abscisic
acid [32,33] or salicylic acid [34]. There is also accumulating evidence that WRKY proteins are involved in
responses to various abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis,
microarray analyses have revealed that some of the
WRKY transcripts are strongly regulated in response to
various abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought and
cold [35-37]. In rice, under abiotic stresses (cold,
drought and salinity) or various phytohormone treatments, 54 WRKY genes showed significant differences
in their transcript abundance [18]. In barley, a WRKY
gene, Hv-WRKY38, is expressed in response to cold and
drought stress response [38] while in soybean at least
nine WRKY genes are found to be differentially
expressed under abiotic stress [15].
Because of their extensive involvement in various physiological processes, it is likely that the WRKY family in
angiosperms has expanded greatly during evolution.
There are at least 72 WRKY family members in Arabidopsis [1] and at least 109 in rice [17]. Gene duplication
events have played a critical role in the expansion of
WRKY genes. For example, in rice, 80% of WRKY genes
loci are located in duplicated regions [18]. Gene duplication events can lead to the generation of new WRKY
genes. It is worth noting that the three groups of
WRKY genes appeared at different times during evolution. Most members of groups 1 and 2 appear to have
arisen before the divergence of the monocots and dicots,
while group 3 WRKY genes seem to have had a relative
later origin [17]. In addition, a recent study showed that
expression divergence had occurred among duplicated
WRKY genes [18]. However, the reasons for expression
divergence among duplicated WRKY genes remain
unclear.
Cucumber is not only an economically important cultivated plant, but also a model system for studies on sex
determination and plant vascular biology [39]. A draft of
the Cucumis sativus var. sativus L. genome sequence
was reported recently [40]. In this study, we searched
this genome sequence to identify the WRKY genes of
cucumber (CsWRKY). Then, we analyzed the expression
of the identified CsWRKY genes under normal growth
conditions and under various abiotic stresses conditions.

We compared the structure of the encoded proteins and
the expression profiles of CsWRKY genes with those of
their putative homologs in Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY
(AtWRKY) genes, and found that there were notable difference between group 3 WRKY genes of Arabidopsis
and cucumber. The evolutionary analysis of group 3
WRKY genes indicated that, unlike cucumber, the
recent duplicated WRKY genes of Arabidopsis have
been under positive selection pressure. This may explain
the expression divergence of their orthologs. These studies will be useful for understanding the role of WRKY
genes in plant responses to abiotic stresses. In addition,
these results provide information about the relationship
between evolution and functional divergence of the
WRKY family.

Results
Identification of WRKY family in cucumber

A total of 57 genes in the cucumber genome were identified as possible members of the WRKY superfamily
and they encoded 57 WRKY proteins. Among these proteins, annotation of eight proteins revealed that they
have two complete WRKY domains each. A total of 52
WRKY genes could be mapped on the chromosomes
and were renamed from CsWRKY1 to CsWRKY52 based
on their order on the chromosomes, from chromosomes
1 to 7 (Figure 1). Five WRKY genes (Csa018657,
Csa018622, Csa018069, Csa018094 and Csa022995) that
could not be conclusively mapped to any chromosome
were renamed CsWRKY53-CsWRKY57 respectively. In
addition, the nucleotide sequence of Csa026380 was
completely identical to that of Csa014665, therefore; the
latter was eliminated from this study.
Next, to establish whether these WRKY genes are
expressed, we screened the cucumber EST database in
NCBI. Twenty-seven putative WRKY genes matched at
least one EST hits (Table 1). We cloned and sequenced
full-length cDNAs of 32 of the annotated CsWRKY
genes (Table 1). Consequently, annotation errors of 17
putative WRKY genes could be corrected (data not
shown). All CDSs of 32 CsWRKY genes have been submitted to GenBank and their accession numbers in GenBank were showed on Table 1.
Multiple sequence alignment, structure and phylogenetic
analysis

The phylogenetic relationship of the CsWRKY proteins
was examined by multiple sequence alignment of their
WRKY domains, which span approx 60 amino acids (Figure 2). A comparison with the WRKY domains of several
different AtWRKY proteins resulted in a better separation
of the different groups and subgroups. For each of the
groups or subgroups, 1, 2a to 2e and 3, one representative was chosen randomly. These were: AtWRKY20, 40,

length. To simplify the presentation, we renamed the putative WRKY genes from CsWKRY1 to CsWRKY52 based on their order on the
chromosomes. Five putative WRKY genes could not be localized on a specific chromosome, so we renamed them from CsWRKY53 to CsWRKY57
according to their raw scores in a search of cucumber WRKY proteins with the Hmmsearch program.

# Annotated CsWRKY9 and CsWRKY10 were actually one gene.
## CsWRKY15 and CsWRKY16 were two domains of one WRKY gene.

72, 50, 74, 65 and 54. As shown in Figure 2, the
sequences in the WRKY domain were highly conserved.
Sequence comparisons, phylogenetic and structural
analyses showed that the WRKY domains could be classified into three large groups corresponding to groups 1,
2 and 3 in Arabidopsis as shown by Eulgem et al., 2000
(Figure 3). It is worth noting that group 1 contained 12
CsWRKY proteins, eight of which contained two WRKY
domains. However, the other four (CsWRKY15,
CsWRKY16, CsWRKY38 and CsWRKY39) contained
only one WRKY domain but clustered with CTWD (Cterminal WRKY domains) and NTWD (N-terminal
WRKY domains) respectively. Our study further showed
that CsWRKY15 and CsWRKY16 were actually two
domains of one WRKY protein, while CsWRKY38 and
CsWRKY39 were two independent WRKY proteins.
Domain acquisition and domain loss events appear to
have shaped the WRKY family [41,42]. Thus,
CsWRKY38 and CsWRKY39 may have arisen from a
two-domain WRKY protein that lost one of its WRKY
domains during evolution. The structure and phylogenetic tree of the CsWRKY domain clearly indicated that
group 2 proteins can be divided into five distinct subgroups (2a-e). Compared with the group 3 proteins in
Arabidopsis (14 members), there are only 6 CsWRKY
proteins in group 3. Whereas genome duplication events
have resulted in the expansion of the WRKY genes in
Arabidopsis and rice [17], it appears that these events
have not occurred in the cucumber WRKY family.
Although Huang et al. [40] reported that the cucumber
genome shows no evidence of recent whole-genome
duplication and tandem duplication. We used the
method of Schauser et al. [43] to search for small duplication blocks in CsWRKY family, but none were found.
In addition, a rooted phylogenetic tree of WRKY
domains was also constructed to identify putative orthologs in Arabidopsis and cucumber (additional file 1). All
orthologs are listed in additional file 2.
Analysis of the structure of CsWRKY genes showed
that all WRKY genes except CsWRKY40 had at least

one intron insert. Two major types of intron splicing
were found in the conserved WRKY domains of
CsWRKY genes (Figure 2), which are similar to WRKY
domains in AtWRKY genes. However, the length of the
conserved introns was 2.8 times greater in cucumber
(~686 bp) than in Arabidopsis (~241 bp). Coincidentally,
this rate was very similar to the size difference (2.9
times) between the genome of cucumber (376 Mb) and
Arabidopsis (125 Mb). The conserved motifs of WRKY
family proteins in cucumber and Arabidopsis were
investigated using Meme version 4.4 as described in the
Methods (additional file 3), and a schematic overview of
the identified motifs is given in additional file 4. As displayed schematically in Figure 4, except for the members of group 2c and group 2e, one or more
conservative motifs outside of the WRKY domain motif
can be detected in a WRKY protein. The CsWRKY and
AtWRKY proteins from the groups 1 and 2, always
share the same conserved motifs. In contrast, the members of group 3 AtWRKY (AtWRKY63, AtWRKY64,
AtWRKY66 and AtWRKY67) show an Arabidopsis-specific conserved motifs (motifs 6, 7 and 8; additional file 3),
but other members of group 3 share the same conserved
motifs with other CsWRKY proteins.
Expression profile of CsWRKY genes under normal growth
conditions and under various abiotic stress conditions

We analyzed the expression of all CsWRKY genes under
normal growth conditions in seven different tissues:
cotyledons, leaves, roots, stems, female flowers, male
flowers and fruits. Not all of the predicted genes were
expressed in plants grown under normal growth conditions. Among 55 predicted genes, 48 genes (87%) were
expressed in at least one of the seven tissues (Figure 5).
The other seven genes did not show any detectable
expression as tested by RT-PCR in the above tissues,
but they may be expressed in other tissues, e.g., seeds.
Also, some of the CsWRKY genes may be pseudogenes.
The following ten genes were expressed in all tested tissues with relatively higher expression intensities:

CsWRKY2, CsWRKY7, CsWRKY14, CsWRKY17,
CsWRKY25, CsWRKY37, CsWRKY41, CsWRKY44,
CsWRKY49 and CsWRKY57. Five WRKY genes
(CsWRKY5, CsWRKY13, CsWRKY23, CsWRKY28 and
CsWRKY55) were expressed at relatively low levels in all
the tested tissues.
We used RT-PCR analyses to examine the expression
of CsWRKY genes in response to three different abiotic
stresses: cold, drought and salinity. Of the 48 expressed

CsWRKY genes, 23 showed differential expressions in
response to at least one stress, whereas the other 25 did
not (Table 2). It should be noted that none of the
stress-inducible CsWRKY genes belongs to group 3. We
conducted real-time PCR analyses to confirm and quantify the expression levels of the 23 stress-inducible
WRKY genes in response to abiotic stresses. As shown
in Figure 6, RT-PCR and real-time PCR generally gave
the same results for the expression profiles and

abundance of transcripts. However, in rare instances, the
difference in expression detected by real-time PCR was
more significant than that detected by RT-PCR (Figure
5E). As shown in Table 2, the results of real-time PCR
showed that most of the stress-responsive genes were
upregulated in response to abiotic stress (Figure 6A, B,
C), and only three genes were downregulated (Figure
6D). As determined by real-time PCR analysis, there
were no differences in the expressions of six group 3
CsWRKY genes in response to abiotic stress (Figure 6F).

and AtWRKY proteins from different groups (or subgroups).
Motif analysis was performed using Meme 4.0 software as described
in the Methods. The selected WRKY proteins are listed on the left.
The black solid line represents the corresponding WRKY protein and
its length. The different-colored boxes represent different motifs and
their position in each WRKY sequence. A detailed motif introduction
for all CsWRKY proteins is shown in additional file 4.

We compared the expressions of CsWRKY genes with
those of their possible orthologs in Arabidopsis under
abiotic treatment. As shown in additional file 5, except
for group 3 WRKY genes, Arabidopsis WRKY genes
whose orthologus CsWRKY genes were not induced by
abiotic treatments were also not stresses-inducible. In
addition, most of orthologous AtWRKY genes of stressinducible CsWRKY genes also responded to at least one
stress-type treatment. These findings imply a possible
correlation between the expression profiles of these
orthologs in Arabidopsis and cucumber in response to
abiotic stresses. Among the CsWRKY genes whose
expressions changed in response to abiotic stress, there
were 13 for which stresses-inducible orthologs existed in
Arabidopsis (additional file 5). To investigate whether
the expressions of these orthologs were correlated
between the two species, we compared the expressions

results indicated that there is a correlative expression
profile between stress-inducible CsWRKY genes and
their putative AtWRKY orthologs, except for the group
3 WRKY genes. This finding suggests that the expression of group 3 WRKY orthologs differ between cucumber and Arabidopsis. All expression data used to
calculate correlations are shown in additional file 6.

of these 13 pairs of orthologs under various stresses as
described in the Methods section. This analysis generated a total of 22 sets of data (one pairs of orthologs
may be induced by more than one abiotic stresses). As
shown in Table 3, the correlation coefficients of 12 sets
of data, more than half of the 22 sets of data, were
greater than 0.5, indicating a positive correlation
between the orthologous pairs under abiotic stresses
(Figure 7A-D). The expression profiles of only two sets
of data were negatively correlated (Figure 7G-H). Finally,
the average correlation coefficients of 22 datasets for all
the putative orthologous WRKY genes was 0.40 and differed significantly (p < 0.01) from the average expression
correlation of a control dataset composed of randomly
chosen gene pairs (0.04) (Table 3). In contrast, when the
correlation coefficients of group 3 CsWRKY and
AtWRKY orthologs were calculated, there was no clear
positive or negative correlation (Figure 7E-F). Our

Evolutionary analysis of group 3 WRKY genes in
Arabidopsis and cucumber

The group 3 WRKY genes seem to have greatly
expanded in angiosperms after the divergence of the
monocots and dicots (160 Mya) [44]. Here, we further
investigated the duplication and diversification of group
3 WRKY genes after divergence of the eurosids I group
(which include cucumber, soybean, and poplar) and the
eurosids II group (which include Arabidopsis) (110
Mya). A phylogenetic tree of WRKY proteins encoded
by group 3 WRKY genes of Arabidopsis (14), cucumber
(6), poplar (10), and soybean (7) was constructed using
the most primitive WRKY domain of Giardia lamblia
as an outgroup. This analysis showed that many members of the group 3 AtWRKY proteins clustered together
and displayed the close phylogenetic relationship (Figure
8), indicating that they arose after the divergence of the
eurosids I and II. Two types of gene duplication events,
tandem duplication and segmental duplication, were the
main factors in the expansion of group 3 AtWRKY
genes. The results of this phylogenetic analysis indicated
that no gene duplication events have occurred in
CsWRKY gene evolution because of no paralogs of
cucumber can be detected. Hence, the different evolutionary patterns of group 3 WRKY in cucumber and
Arabidopsis occurred after their divergence.
To determine whether selection pressure had affected
group 3 WRKY genes, we estimated the ω (dn/ds)
values for all branches of group 3 WRKY genes in Arabidopsis and cucumber (Figure 9 and Table 4). In Arabidopsis, the ML estimate of dN/dS values for all nodes
under model M0 were < 1, with a mean value of 0.276
(Table 4), indicating that group 3 AtWRKY genes have
been under purifying selection, which was the predominant force acting on the evolution of the group 3
AtWRKY genes. However, the log likelihood differences
between model M3 and model M0 were statistically significant for all nodes tested, suggesting that selective
pressure varied among branches and some genes might
have been under positive selection. We further used
model M7 and M8 of PAML to address whether positive selection has played a role in the evolution of group
3 AtWRKY genes. Of the eight nodes analyzed, log-likelihood values were significantly higher under the M8
model than under the M7 model for five nodes (nodes
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), which indicates that positive selection

Figure 6 Expression patterns of six selected WRKY genes under abiotic stresses. In A-F, the top panel shows the RT-PCR result and the
bottom panel shows the corresponding real-time PCR result. For real-time PCR, the relative amount of mRNA (y-axis) was calculated by
according to the description in Methods. The cucumber b-actin gene was used as an internal control to normalize the data. The 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6,
12, and 24 (x-axis) indicate the treatment time (hour) under corresponding abiotic stresses. The error bars were calculated based on three
replicates. A-C, significant up-regulated expression of WRKY genes can be detected under abiotic stresses. D, significant down-regulated
expression of CsWRKY53 can be detected under cold treatment. E, the expression difference detected by real-time PCR was more significant than
that detected by RT-PCR. F, no significant expression difference can be detected in group 3 WRKY gene CsWRKY50 under abiotic stress. Statistical
significance was obtained by using Student’s t-test.

has contributed to the evolution of group 3 AtWRKY
genes. Interestingly, the terminal nodes with clusters of
duplicated AtWRKY genes were all under positive position selection, suggesting a correlation between duplication of genes and positive selection. Furthermore, we
identified the positively selected sites under model M8
using the Bayesian method. Several positive selection
sites were detected in above five nodes but only one
positive selection site could be detected in the region of
WRKY domains. Thus, it appears that because of the
high degree of conservation in WRKY domains of the
WRKY genes, the positive selection contributed mostly
to the regions outside of the WRKY domains. In cucumber, although the log likelihood differences between
model M3 and model M0 suggest that selective pressure
varied among branches, there was no detectable positive
selection in any of the nodes. Assuming that there were

no duplication events in CsWRKY genes and that positive selection is associated with duplication of WRKY
genes as we described here, the extensive positive selection events were probably followed by the group 3
WRKY gene duplication events. This positive selection
might be the main evolutionary force for group 3
AtWRKY genes. Due to the absence of duplicated genes
and positive selection in cucumber, the functions of
group 3 CsWRKY genes might be more conservative
than those of AtWRKY genes.

Discussion
Whether the CsWRKY genes were underrepresented in
this study?

The WRKY gene family has 72 members in Arabidopsis
[1] and 109 members in rice [17]. In this study, we identified a total of 55 CsWRKY genes. Compared with

*Available expression data on AtWRKY genes from microarray analysis and that of CsWRKY genes generated by real-time PCR analysis were used to calculate the
Pearson correlation coefficient for the expression of orthologous WRKY genes under various abiotic stresses (after 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h treatment)(as
showed in Figure 7)as described in the Methods.
**a randomly chosen abiotic stress induced cucumber WRKY gene and a randomly chosen abiotic stress induced AtWRKY gene composed of a random gene pair.
This process was repeated a 100 times and produced 100 random WRKY gene pairs. The expression correlation of each of 100 random WRKY gene pair was
calculated as described in the Methods

Arabidopsis (genome size 125 Mb) and rice (genome
size 480 Mb), in cucumber (genome size 367 Mb), the
size of the WRKY family is small. We further compared
the number of WRKY genes in different subgroup
among Arabidopsis, rice, grape and cucumber (Table 5).
As showed in table 5, the key difference is that the
number of group 3 CsWRKY genes (6) was much lesser
than those of Arabidopsis (14) and rice (36). A problem
has arisen. Whether CsWRKY genes, especially group 3
CsWRKY genes, are underrepresented or not in our
study?
Complete and accurate annotation of genes is an
essential starting point for further evolution and function study in gene family. We identified a total of 55
CsWRKY genes from 26682 cucumber annotated genes
in cucumber genome. In addition, a total of 357882
cucumber EST sequences download from Cucumber
Genome DataBase and NCBI were used to test whether
there are new WRKY proteins encoded by these EST
sequences that were ignored in our annotation for
CsWRKY proteins. The amino acid sequences of the

open reading frame (ORF) of the EST were subjected to
HMM program search. The results were screened
manually for false positives at E values above 10 100 .
Even with this weak criterion, we failed to find any new
WRKY proteins in cucumber genome, which indicate
that the annotation for cucumber WRKY genes is complete. We further used experimental methods to test the
accuracy of annotation for CsWRKY genes. According to
the annotated WRKY genes sequence, we detected the
expression of 48 CsWRKY genes (87%), indicating that
the accuracy of annotation for CsWRKY genes is high.
Moreover, we cloned and sequenced full-length cDNAs
of 32 of the annotated CsWRKY genes (Table 1), and
some annotation errors were corrected. For example, we
found that predicted CsWRKY15 and CsWRKY16 were
actually two domains of one WRKY protein. Through
this process, the integrity and accuracy of annotated
CsWRKY genes were improved and were high enough
to use in our further study. Therefore, we believed that
CsWRKY genes would not be underrepresented in our
study.

Figure 7 Pairwise comparisons of the expression profiles of putative orthologous cucumber and Arabidopsis WRKY genes under
abiotic stresses. The relative expression of CsWRKY genes was obtained by real-time RT-PCR (indicated by triangles). Data are the means of
three replicates with standard errors represented by bars. The CsWRKY expression data were compared with the mean-normalized expression
data for their putative orthologous AtWRKY genes from a publicly available Arabidopsis microarray data set (indicated by circles) according to
the description in Methods. The relative amount of mRNA (y-axis) was the ratio of treated to untreated sample. The treatment time (h) under
the particular abiotic stress is presented on the x-axis. R indicates the correlation coefficient for expression between orthologs under the
corresponding abiotic stresses. A distinct positive correlation was detected in most orthologs (A-D), but no obvious correlation was detected in
group 3 orthologs (E-F). A negative correlation was detected in a small number of orthologs (G-H).

The quickly expansion of group 3 WRKY genes is
associated with the recent duplication events

Many angiosperms underwent whole genome duplication events (g, b, a). The g event appears to pre-data
monocots-dicots divergence. The b event pre-dated Arabidopsis divergence from the other dicots, but postdated divergence from the monocots about 170-235
Myr ago. The a duplication event (recent duplication
events) pre-dated Arabidopsis divergence from Brassica
about 14.5-20.4 million years (Myr) ago [45]. The recent
gene duplication events are most important in the

quickly expansion and evolution of gene families [46].
Therefore, in our manuscript, we only analyze the influence of recent duplication events to CsWRKY genes.
Both Arabidopsis and rice genome underwent the
recent duplication events, which lead to the large-scale
expansion of gene family in their genome [46,47]. Zhang
et al. report that group 3 WRKY domains appear to
have been duplicated independently after the divergence
of monocots and dicots (160 Mya) [44]. In this study,
we further study the duplication of group 3 WRKY
genes after divergence of the eurosids I group and the

eurosids II group (110 Mya). As showed in Figure 7, the
close paralogs WRKY genes of Arabidopsis, poplar and
soybean each clustered together respectively, indicating
that the expansion of the group 3 WRKY gene family
may have occurred after the divergence of the eurosids I
and eurosids II (110 Mya), and should be related to the
most recent genome duplication events(24-40 Mya).
Moreover, our result indicated that one of important

factor in the expansion of group 3 AtWRKY was the
occurrence of tandem duplication events. Four tandem
duplication genes were clustered together in phylogenetic trees, indicating that the tandem duplication
occurred after the divergence of the eurosids I and eurosids II and also related with recent duplication events.
Interestingly, tandem duplication was an important
recent gene duplication pattern in Arabidopsis genome
[46], but in AtWRKY gene family there were only four
AtWRKY genes from tandem duplication blocks and all
of them belonged to group 3 AtWRKY genes. From
these, we can see that the group 3 AtWRKY genes
expanded quickly in Arabidopsis genome by two duplication patterns: recent segmental duplication and recent
tandem duplication, which indicate that group 3 WRKY
genes may play important roles in the adaptability of
angiosperms.
As far as cucumber concerned, although Huang et al.,
reported that the cucumber genome was absence of
recent whole-genome duplication events and tandem
duplication [40]. The method of Schauser [43] was still
used to detect whether recent small duplication blocks
occur in CsWRKY family. We found no CsWRKY genes
locus on any recent duplication blocks (additional file 2).
In addition, from the Figure 1, we can see that there are

no tandemly arrayed WRKY genes on the same chromosomal location, which indicate the absence of recent tandem duplication event in CsWRKY genes. Therefore,
compared with Arabidopsis and rice, the size of group 3
CsWRKY proteins is small, which can be attributed to the
absence of recent duplication events in cucumber genome. To prove this hypothesis, we search the grape
WRKY proteins (VvWRKY) in grape genome. The grape
genome, like cucumber, has not undergone recent
duplication events [48]. As showed by table 5, there are
only five group 3 VvWRKY (GSVIVT01028718001,
GSVIVT01019511001,
GSVIVT01027069001,
GSVIVT01032662001 and GSVIVT01032661001) can be
detected in grape genome. Therefore, on the base of the
above discussion, we believe that compared with Arabidopsis and rice, the small size of group 3 CsWRKY can be
attribute to the absence of recent duplication events in
cucumber genome rather than the underrepresentation
of group 3 CsWRKY in our study.

CsWRKY proteins play important roles in various
biological processes

The reported WRKY gene (SE71, ID: AAC37515.1) of
cucumber shares 93% similarity with the CsWRKY37
reported here. The expression of SE71 increases in cotyledons as they expand and become photosynthetic, suggesting an involvement of SE71 in the development of
cotyledons and cucumber photosynthesis [7]. Our RTPCR results showed that CsWRKY37 was expressed in all
seven cucumber tissues at relatively high levels, which
indicates that CsWRKY37 could play a role not only in
development of cotyledons and photosynthesis but also
in the processes such as flower formation and fruit development. Besides CsWRKY37, some other CsWRKY genes
also showed relative high expression levels in all seven
organs, such as CsWRKY25 and CsWRKY49. The WRKY
genes that are highly expressed in plant organs often play
key roles in plant development [18]. The role of WKRY
gene in plant development is in transcriptional regulation

of expression of target genes that are involved in some
physiological pathway [3]. So, we speculated that the
highly expressed CsWRKY genes reported here may play
a regulatory role in cucumber development. However,
more research is needed to determine the functions of
the CsWRKY genes.
Evidence is accumulating that WRKY proteins are
involved into response to various abiotic stresses. At
least 54 OsWRKY genes of rice and 26 GmWRKY genes
of soybean were found to be differentially expressed
under abiotic stresses [18]. In this study, we showed
that 23 CsWRKY genes exhibited differential expression
in response to at least one abiotic stress, indicating that
CsWRKY genes may play an important role in cucumber
responding to abiotic stresses. In fact, previous studies
indicated that some of the WRKY proteins are stable
and resistant to environmental stresses. Huang et al.
reported that a WRKY gene of bittersweet nightshade
(STHP-64) encoded an anti-freeze protein, which contains a unique 13-mer repeat in the C-terminus, known
to be a common feature of animal antifreeze proteins
[9]. However, increasing number of studies indicate that
WRKY proteins are transcriptional factors that regulate
the tolerance of plant to abiotic stresses [38]. As shown
in Figure 6, some of the CsWRKY genes responded to
stresses at an early stage. For example, CsWRKY18
peaked at 0.5 h after drought treatment. These results
indicated that some CsWRKY genes possible may be as
a transcriptional factor to regulate the tolerance of
cucumber to stresses. To understand the biological
functions of WRKY transcriptional factors, the identification of target genes and the regulatory network of
WRKY transcriptional factors are necessary. The soybean GmWRKY54 expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis
showed that GmWRKY54 can regulate the expression of
DREB2A, which contains a W-box motif in the promoter region and is known to act as a transcriptional factor
regulated the expression of many drought-inducible
genes [15]. Other recent studies have revealed that two
co-regulated networks exist in rice regulating the
response to various abiotic stresses [49]. These results
indicate that the regulatory role of WRKY proteins
under abiotic stresses is complex and more work is
needed to understand the regulatory mechanisms.
The functional conservative and divergence of
orthologous genes between Arabidopsis and cucumber

In comparative genomics, the clustering of orthologous
genes highlights the divergence and conservation of
gene families among multiple genomes. Two strategies
have often been used to identify orthologs or paralogs:
phylogeny-based methods and BLAST-based methods
[50]. The comparison of results from phylogeny-based
methods contains widely orthologous pairs information

Page 15 of 20

but may lead to false positives error [51]. Therefore
strict criteria must be adopted in phylogeny-based methods. BLAST-based method (Bi-direction best hit) shows
a good overall performance but is restricted to 1:1
orthologs which may lead to omit the in-paralogs [51].
In this study, a rooted phylogenetic tree based on
WRKY domain of rice, cucumber and Arabidopsis was
used to arrange possible orthologs of cucumber and
Arabidopsis. In addition, a standard approach BBH
(bidirectional best hit) was also used as reference to
arrange possible orthologs. Relatively strict criteria were
used to arrange orthologus genes in this study. The
nodes of phylogenetic tree which the bootstrap support
values (1000 re-sampling) exceed 50% were used to
identify possible orthologs pairs. For example,
AtWRKY65 and CsWRKY6 were clustered together in
phylogenetic tree, but the bootstrap of their node is no
more than 50%. Therefore, AtWRKY65 and CsWRKY6
were excluded from the orthologous pair, so does
CsWRKY11 and AtWRKY18/60. In addition, the members of group 1 WRKY were considered as possible
orthologous pairs unless the same phylogenetic relationship can be detected between their N-domain and Cdomain in the phylogenetic tree. For example,
CsWRKY8 and AtWRKY25 /26 were excluded from
orthologous pairs because of the different cluster of
their N-domain and C-domain in the phylogenetic tree.
Totally, we found 38 orthologus pair between cucumber
and Arabidopsis (additional file 2).
We further analyze the correlation of orthologous
pairs under abiotic stresses. Our results show that correlative expression profiles in stress-inducible orthologous
WRKY genes between cucumber and Arabidopsis. Mangelsen et al. reported that in homologous organs the
average correlation coefficient of the orthologous
WRKY genes between monocots and dicots can reach
0.24 [52]. Because researches on the role played by
cucumber genes in abiotic stress tolerance are quite limited, our study provide a new starting point for investigating the function of cucumber genes by comparing
the orthologous genes between cucumber and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, in our study, orthologous WRKY genes
with different evolution patterns displayed a low correlation in their expression patterns. Almost half of
CsWRKY genes in our study responded to at least one
abiotic stresses, but none of them belongs to group 3. In
contrast, the expression data from microarray of
AtWRKY genes has revealed that all the gene orthologous to group 3 CsWRKY genes response to abiotic
stresses in Arabidopsis, and interestingly all of them are
located in a recent segmentally duplicated region. The
recent Segmental duplication occurs most frequently in
plants because most plants are diploidized polyploids

their genomes [53]. As discussed earlier in this paper,
after the divergence of eurosids I and eurosids II, the
group 3 AtWRKY genes experienced segmental duplication events. The long-term evolutionary fate of duplication genes will be determined by functions of the
duplicated genes. Four types of functional differentiation
may follow by gene duplication: pseudogenization, conservation of gene function, subfunctionalization and
neofunctionalization [54]. Many duplicated genes may
be lost from the genome after the duplication events,
and neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are
the major factors for the retention of new genes. In
addition, positive selection may play important roles in
the neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of
duplication genes. In the case of neofunctionalization of
duplicated genes, positive selection accelerates the fixation of advantageous mutations that enhance the activity
of the novel function. In the case of subfunctionalization
of duplicated genes, each daughter gene will inherit one
of functions of ancestral gene, and further substitutions
under positive selection can refine the functions [47]. In
Arabidopsis, the number of group 3 WRKY genes
increased significantly due to the duplication events
after divergence of the eurosids I and eurosids II, and
our results suggested that all duplicated group 3
AtWRKY experienced a positive selection after their
duplication events. The retention of new members of
group 3 AtWRKY could be contributed to their neofunctionalization. In rice, high expression divergence could
be one of the mechanisms for the retention of duplicated WRKY genes [18]. Due to the lack of gene duplication events in the CsWRKY family, the functions of
group 3 CsWRKY genes are probably more conservative
than that of AtWRKY. The functions of the group 3
CsWRKY genes likely resemble the functions of a common ancestor that existed before the divergence of eurosids I and II. Indeed, the common ancestor may not
have been responsive to abiotic stresses, and the stressresponsive ability of the group 3 AtWRKY genes could
be due to neofunctionalization following gene duplication event(s).

Conclusions
In this study, we identified a total of 55 cucumber
WRKY genes and analyzed the expression profile of 48
CsWRKY genes under normal growth conditions and in
response to various abiotic stresses. These new WRKY
sequences and expression information reported here will
be useful for further investigating the function of WRKY
genes under various stress conditions. Although the
genome sequence of cucumber has been reported, functional studies on cucumber genes are still lag behind.
Our results show that correlative expression profiles
exist between putative WRKY orthologs of cucumber

Page 16 of 20

and Arabidopsis. Hence, comparative genomics
approaches could be used to investigate gene function.
In addition, compared with group 1 and 2 WRKY genes,
the group 3 WRKY genes seem to have arisen more
recently in angiosperms, but have expanded rapidly. Our
results also indicate that positive selection could have
led to the functional divergence of duplicated genes during the expansion of group 3 WRKY genes. Based on all
the results presented here, we speculated that the functional divergence of WRKY proteins has played a critical
role in the responses of plants to various stresses.

Methods
Sequence database searches

Arabidopsis WRKY proteins sequences were obtained
from TAIR [55]. The rice WRKY proteins sequences
were obtained from rice genome annotation project
[56]. The WRKY proteins of poplar and soybean were
obtained from PFAM database [57]. The GenBank
accession numbers of WRKY protein sequences were
provided in additional file 7. The WRKY proteins of
grape were obtained from http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/
externe/Download/Projets/Projet_ML/data/12X/annotation/Vitis_vinifera_peptide.fa.gz.
The cucumber annotated (predicted) genes and proteins were obtained from Cucumber Genome Sequencing Project which we participated in. Now, this
annotated data can be downloaded from Cucumber
Genome DataBase [58]. We searched WRKY proteins
from a total of 26682 predicted cucumber proteins. We
used 72 Arabidopsis WRKY proteins as query sequences
and Blastp searches against the predicted cucumber proteins. The sequences were selected as candidate proteins
if their E value satisfied E was ≤-10. Based on the
HMMER User’s Guide, the Hmmsearch program was
then used to predict the WRKY domains (PF03106.7) of
all these candidate proteins and the E valve was set to
-10. The new WRKY-like sequences confirmed by
Hmmsearch in the cucumber genome were in turn used
reiteratively to search the cucumber predicted proteins
until no new sequences were found. The EST sequences
of cucumber were downloaded from NCBI and Cucumber Genome DataBase [58].
Multiple sequence alignment, gene structure construction
and phylogenetic analysis

The 60 amino acid spanning WRKY core domain of all
CsWRKY proteins and selected AtWRKY protein
(AtWRKY20 (At4g26640), 40 (At1g80840), 72
(At5g15130), 50 (At5g26170), 74 (At5g28650), 65
(At1g29280) and 54 (At2g40750)) was used to create
multiple protein sequence alignments using ClustalW
[59]. Default settings were applied for the alignment in
Figure 2. The gene structure was obtained by the

Ling et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:471
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/471

cucumber gene annotation GIFF3 file downloaded from
Cucumber Genome DataBase. The neighbor-joining
method was used to construct the phylogenetic tree
based on amino acid sequence of WRKY domains. Two
types of software, MEGA 4.0 and PHYLIP 3.2 were used
[60,61]. The MEGA 4.0 analysis was carried out according to the description by Zhang et al., [62] and the
PHYLIP 3.2 analysis was carried out according to the
description by Zhou et al., [15]. Motif detection was
performed with MEME 4.0 software [63]. A rooted phylogenetic tree based on WRKY domain of rice, cucumber and Arabidopsis was used to arrange possible
orthologs of cucumber and Arabidopsis. In addition, a
standard approach BBH (bidirectional best hit) was also
used as reference to arrange possible orthologs [51,64].
Microarray based expression analysis and correlation
calculation

For the expression analysis of AtWRKY genes, publicly
available microarray data of the AtGenExpress global
stress expression data set [37] were used. The microarray data of cold stress (ME00325), drought stresses
(ME00338) and salt stresses (ME00328) were downloaded from Weigel World database [65]. The meannormalized values of the expression data were used in
further analysis. The relative amount of mRNA was calculated by dividing the expression data of the stress
treatment by that of the control (0 h treatment).
Available expression data on AtWRKY genes from
microarray analysis and that of CsWRKY genes generated
by real time RT-PCR analysis described here were used to
calculate the Pearson correlation of the expression of
orthologous WRKY genes. All expression data (relative
amount of mRNA) are composed of seven treatment
points (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) under corresponding
abiotic stresses. For each of orthologous WRKY gene
pairs, the correlation of the expression data under their
corresponding abiotic stresses was calculated. The following methods were used to test the significance of correlation of the expression of orthologs pair: A randomly
chosen abiotic stress induced cucumber WRKY genes and
a randomly chosen abiotic stress induced AtWRKY gene
constituted a random WRKY gene pair. This process was
repeated a 100 times and produced 100 random WRKY
gene pairs. The expression correlation of each of 100 random WRKY gene pair was calculated as described above.
Lastly, the average correlation of orthologous WRKY gene
pairs and of randomly selected gene pairs was calculated.
Student’s t-test was used to obtain the statistical significance of the difference in average correlation of the two
datasets. The random WRKY genes pairs were obtained
using Perl scripts. Pearson correlation and P-values in ttest were calculated by using software R. All programs run
on a computer with Ubuntu Linux installed.

Detection of positive selection

The Amino acid sequence of group 3 AtWRKY and
CsWRKY proteins were used to construct phylogenetic
tree respectively, which in turn was used for detecting
positive selection. We used PAML4 [66] to analyze
codon substitution patterns with a maximum likelihood,
implementing a site-specific model. We detected variation in ω values among sites by employing a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) between M0 vs. M3 and M7 vs. M8
according to Yang et al. [67]. The nodes were considered to have undergone positive selection, if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) an estimate of ω > 1
under M8 (2) sites identified to be under positive selection by Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis and (3) a
statistically significant LRT.
Plant materials, growth conditions and treatments

Line 9930, a cucumber typical of northern China, was
used throughout the study. Seeds were germinated in
pots containing vermiculite, and 3-week old seedlings
were used in the following treatments. For dehydration
treatment, the plants were carefully pulled out, transferred on to filter paper and allowed to dry. For salinity
and cold treatments, seedlings were subjected to a 100
mM NaCl solution or incubated at 4°C, respectively.
Above-ground samples for RNA extractions were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after treatment. The
roots, stems, leaves, cotyledons of seedlings, female flowers, male flowers and fruits of mature plants were collected separately for RNA isolation and used for tissuespecific expression analysis.
RNA isolation, clone full-length cDNA, RT-PCR and Real
-time PCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated according to Zhang et al., [59].
For cloning the full-length cDNA of CsWRKY genes, we
first used the EST sequences of cucumber to correct the
annotated CsWRKY sequence and then used the Fgenesh, a web-base gene prediction method, as a tool to
re-annotate all 57 WRKY genes. Subsequently, combined the result of Fgenesh, GLEAN and EVM (GLEAN
and EVM were employed to annotate cucumber genome
in cucumber genome project), we amplified the fulllength sequence of CsWRKY coding region (CDS) genes
by PCR.
For RT-PCR, the specific primers were designed
according to the WRKY gene sequences by Primer 5
software (additional file 8). A cucumber b-actin gene
(ID: Csa017310), amplified with primers 5’-TCCACGAGACTACCTACAACTC-3’ and 5’-GCTCATACGGTCAGCGAT-3’, was used as a control. The following
program was used for RT-PCR: 94 for 2 min followed
by 35 cycles at 94 for 10 s, 55-59 for 10 s and 72 for 25
s, followed by a 2 min extension step at 72. While the

Ling et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:471
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/471

number of cycles of PCR for actin gene was set as 23.
The PCR products were separated on an agarose gel
and quantified using an Imaging System (Bio-Rad,
USA). The experiments were repeated three times with
independent RNA samples.
The real-time PCR analysis were performed using
BIO-RAD CFX96 real-Time PCR system(Bio-Rad, USA)
96 well formats with denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s and
annealing/extension at 55 or 60°C for 1 min. Three biological replicates were carried out and triplicate quantitative assays for each replicate were performed on 0.5 μl
of each cDNA dilution using TianGen SYBR Green PCR
Master mix kit (TianGen Biotech FP202, CHN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cucumber bactin gene was used as an internal control. Relative gene
expression was calculated according to Jiang et al., [68].
The ΔCT and ΔΔCT were calculated by the formulas
ΔCT = CT target - CT reference and ΔΔCT = ΔCT
treated sample -ΔCT untreated sample (0 h treatment).
The RNA relative amount as selected to evaluate gene
expression level as 2-ΔΔCT, which was used for all
chart preparations. At the same time, the standard
errors of mean among replicates were calculated. All
calculations were automatically carried on Bio-Rad CFX
Manager (Version1.5.534) of BIO-RAD CFX96. Student’s t-test was used to obtain the statistical significance of the difference between treated samples and
untreated samples (0 h treatment under abiotic stress).
If P-values < 0.01, we considered the WRKY genes as
differential expressed genes. The specific primers were
designed for WRKY genes and b-actin gene used in real
time PCR were listed in additional file 9. The data and
pictures produced by BIO-RAD CFX96 were presented
in additional file 10 and additional file 11, respectively.
