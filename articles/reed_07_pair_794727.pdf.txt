Abstract
Background: The parasitic sucking lice of primates are known to have undergone at least 25
million years of coevolution with their hosts. For example, chimpanzee lice and human head/body
lice last shared a common ancestor roughly six million years ago, a divergence that is
contemporaneous with their hosts. In an assemblage where lice are often highly host specific,
humans host two different genera of lice, one that is shared with chimpanzees and another that is
shared with gorillas. In this study, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of primate lice and infer
the historical events that explain the current distribution of these lice on their primate hosts.
Results: Phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analyses suggest that the louse genera Pediculus and
Pthirus are each monophyletic, and are sister taxa to one another. The age of the most recent
common ancestor of the two Pediculus species studied matches the age predicted by host
divergence (ca. 6 million years), whereas the age of the ancestor of Pthirus does not. The two
species of Pthirus (Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis) last shared a common ancestor ca. 3–4 million
years ago, which is considerably younger than the divergence between their hosts (gorillas and
humans, respectively), of approximately 7 million years ago.
Conclusion: Reconciliation analysis determines that there are two alternative explanations that
account for the current distribution of anthropoid primate lice. The more parsimonious of the two
solutions suggests that a Pthirus species switched from gorillas to humans. This analysis assumes that
the divergence between Pediculus and Pthirus was contemporaneous with the split (i.e., a node of
cospeciation) between gorillas and the lineage leading to chimpanzees and humans. Divergence date
estimates, however, show that the nodes in the host and parasite trees are not contemporaneous.
Rather, the shared coevolutionary history of the anthropoid primates and their lice contains a
mixture of evolutionary events including cospeciation, parasite duplication, parasite extinction, and
host switching. Based on these data, the coevolutionary history of primates and their lice has been
anything but parsimonious.

Background
Sucking lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) are permanent and
obligate ectoparasites of eutherian mammals. These
highly specialized blood-sucking insects live in close association with their hosts and complete their entire life cycle
on the host [1]. Anoplurans have modified mouthparts
for feeding on host blood and because mammalian blood
differs widely among species in terms of its suitability for
louse nutrition [2], sucking lice can be highly host specific
[1,3]. Host specificity could also be reinforced by interactions with the host's immune system. High host specificity
can arise from a long history of cospeciation between
hosts and their parasites. Cospeciation is speciation (or
cladogenesis) in a parasite lineage as a result of, or at the
same time as, host cladogenesis [4]. The current distribution of parasites on host taxa (the host-parasite associations) can be the result of cospeciation or various
historical events [5] such as host switching, sorting events
(extinction and lineage sorting), duplication events (parasites speciating on a single host lineage), and failure of
the parasite to speciate when the host speciates ('missing
the boat'; [6]). These historical processes can be detected
by comparing the phylogenies of hosts and their parasites
using methodologies such as reconciliation analysis [7].
Previous cophylogenetic studies of lice (both sucking lice
and chewing lice) have documented each of these historical events in various combinations (for a review, see [8]).
Humans (Homo sapiens) are parasitized by two genera of
sucking lice: one shared with chimpanzees (Pan spp.) and
the other shared with gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Human
head and body lice, as well as chimpanzee lice, are members of the genus Pediculus (Pediculus humanus and Pediculus schaeffi, respectively). There is no Pediculus species
known to parasitize gorillas. Human pubic lice and gorilla
lice belong to the genus Pthirus (Pthirus pubis and Pthirus
gorillae, respectively), and no Pthirus species is known to
parasitize chimpanzees. Pediculus and Pthirus are sister
taxa based on morphology and molecular data (Figure 1),
and primate lice are known to have cospeciated with their
hosts for at least 25 million years [9]. The curious distribution of these two genera raises an interesting question
regarding the evolutionary history of primate lice. Why do
humans retain both genera, but chimpanzees and gorillas
have only one genus each?
Given what is already known about the coevolutionary
history of the lice and their hosts, we can speculate that
there are two mutually exclusive explanations that can
account for the current distribution of Pediculus and Pthirus (Figure 2). The most parsimonious explanation (i.e.,
the explanation requiring the fewest number of steps) predicts perfect cospeciation between the primates and lice
with the addition of a single host switch. In this scenario,
the divergence between Pediculus humanus and Pediculus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/7

schaeffi occurred at the same time as the split between
their hosts, humans and chimpanzees, ca. 6 million years
ago (MYA; [10]), and the split between Pediculus and Pthirus occurred contemporaneously with the split between
gorillas and the lineage leading to chimpanzees and
humans (ca. 7 MYA; Figure 2A; [10]). These events were
followed some time later by one host switch of a Pthirus
species from gorillas to humans (Figure 2A). Host switching among lice is common in many groups of birds and
mammals [11-13]. This 'recent host switch' hypothesis
requires one evolutionary step and predicts that the divergence between Pthirus pubis and Pthirus gorillae is more
recent than the chimpanzee/human split (Figure 2A).
How we might have acquired our pubic lice from gorillas
is not immediately apparent, however it would be interesting to know whether the switch was very recent (say less
than 100,000 years old) or whether it was considerably
older.
The alternative hypothesis involves an ancient louse
duplication event that occurred on the ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans, which would have created
the lineages leading to the two extant genera, Pediculus
and Pthirus (Figure 2B). In this case, the timing of the
divergence between Pthirus pubis and Pthirus gorillae would
correspond to that of their hosts (ca. 7 MYA; [10]). In this
scenario, humans would have retained both genera, but
chimpanzees would have lost a Pthirus species and gorillas
would have lost a Pediculus species to extinction (Figure
2B). Such parasite duplications and extinctions are common in the lice of birds and mammals (e.g., [14]). This
parasite extinction or 'pair of lice lost' model is less parsimonious than the 'recent host switch' hypothesis listed
above because it requires at least three evolutionary steps
(a duplication of the parasite on a primate common
ancestor as well as the extinction of one Pediculus and one
Pthirus lineage, Figure 2B). Although the 'recent host
switch' hypothesis is more parsimonious, it is not necessarily more likely than the 'pair of lice lost' hypothesis.
Each of the historical events (host switch, duplication,
and extinction) has some probability of occurrence, the
quantification of which is beyond the scope of this paper.
There are additional hypotheses that can be postulated
that have more evolutionary steps than the two presented
above, however there are no other hypotheses that have
an equal number of steps or fewer steps. For instance, one
might assume that the current distribution of lice resulted
from a host switch of Pthirus from humans to gorillas (the
opposite direction of the switch in the 'recent host switch'
model). However, this evolutionary scenario would
require at least five evolutionary steps.
The two hypotheses of parasite distributions ('pair of lice
lost' and 'recent host switch') are based on the premise of
maximizing the number of cospeciation events and mini-

mizing the number of events that deviate from cospeciation, which are typical of analyses that attempt to
reconcile host and parasite associations that are based on
the concept of evolutionary parsimony (reconciliation
analysis as implemented in TreeMap; [7]). However, parsimony-based reconciliation analyses do not take into
account branch lengths and divergence times – information that is essential to distinguish between the 'recent
host switch' and 'pair of lice lost' hypotheses. In the presence of significant cospeciation we can use the timing of
speciation events to differentiate among alternative
hypotheses of host-parasite associations [15].
We have performed phylogenetic and cophylogenetic
analyses of two genes, the mitochondrial cytochrome c

oxidase subunit I (Cox1) gene and nuclear gene elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) gene, to determine the shared
evolutionary history of primate lice and their hosts. We
also investigate the use of standard phylogenetic methods
for reconstructing coevolutionary histories when standard
cophylogenetic methods (e.g., reconciliation analysis)
cannot always find the solution that best fits the observed
data.

Results
Phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analyses
The partition homogeneity test determined that the Cox1
and EF-1α genes did not differ significantly (p = 0.94),
therefore a combined analysis was performed in addition
to analyses based on single genes. The best-fit model for

each individual gene and the combined-gene analysis of
lice was a transversion model (TrN+I+Γ model) that permitted two nucleotide substitution rates for transversions,
one rate for transitions, unequal base frequencies, a rate
heterogeneity parameter (G), and a parameter for invariant sites (I). Similarly, the best-fit model for the Cox1
gene from the primate host taxa was also TrN+I+Γ. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of the combined Cox1 and
EF-1α dataset (as well as individual gene datasets) from
lice produced a single, well-supported phylogeny in agreement with results from previous analyses (Figure 3; [9]).
When the same ML analysis was performed enforcing a
molecular clock, the resulting tree topology did not
change and the resulting tree score was not significantly
different than the unconstrained score (p = 0.7625). The
ML analysis of the host Cox1 data also resulted in a single
phylogeny in agreement with known relationships among
these primate taxa (Figure 3).
Cophylogenetic analyses using TreeMap [7] produced two
reconciliations of host and parasite phylogenies in agreement with the 'recent host switch' and 'pair of lice lost'
hypotheses presented in Figure 2. The reconciliation concordant with the 'recent host switch' hypothesis (Figure
2A) included five cospeciation events and one host switch
for a total cost of 1.0. The reconstruction concordant with
the 'pair of lice lost' hypothesis (Figure 2B) was less parsimonious. While this reconstruction included five cospeciation events, there was also a single duplication event and
two losses resulting in a total cost of 3.0. Both reconciliations show significantly greater similarity between the
host and parasite trees than would be expected based on
chance alone (i.e., both reconciliations show significant
cospeciation, p < 0.05).
Divergence date estimation
Divergence date estimates differed little between r8s and
multidivtime analyses and between individual and combined genes (Table 1). For convenience we will refer to
divergence date estimates based on the combined gene
tree used in multidivtime (Table 1 and Figure 3). Mean
divergence date estimates for the split between the chimpanzee and human head/body lice (Pediculus schaeffi and
Pediculus humanus, respectively) averaged 6.39 MYA. The
divergence date estimates for the gorilla and human pubic
lice (Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis, respectively) averaged 3.32 MYA and are noticeably more recent than the
split between the two Pediculus species. The estimated
divergence date for the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of the two genera, Pthirus and Pediculus, was estimated to be 12.95 MYA (Table 1 and Figure 3), noticeably
older than the MRCA of chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas.

Discussion
Reconciliation analysis using TreeMap corroborates earlier reports of significant cospeciation between primate
lice and their hosts [9]. These cophylogenetic analyses
also result in two reconciliations of the host and parasite
phylogenies where the most parsimonious reconstruction
favors the 'recent host switch' hypothesis (Figure 2A).
However, divergence date estimates conflict with the
results of the reconciliation analysis because the 'recent
host switch' hypothesis predicts that the divergence of
Pediculus and Pthirus would be roughly contemporaneous
with the split between gorillas and the lineage leading to
humans and chimpanzees. Our estimates of the MRCA of
Pediculus and Pthirus dates to roughly 13 MYA, not
remotely consistent with the MRCA of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas (ca. 7 MYA; [10]). Given the much older
age of our MRCA of Pediculus and Pthirus, it is more appropriate, although less parsimonious, to assume that the origin of the two genera was the result of a parasite
duplication event rather than a cospeciation event ('pair
of lice lost' hypothesis; Figure 2B). It is curious that the
estimate of the MRCA of Pthirus and Pediculus (13 MYA) is
contemporaneous with the divergence of Orangutans
from other apes [10], however this is possibly coincidental. Lice do not parasitize orangutans; therefore, reconstructing their role in the evolutionary history of primate
sucking lice will be difficult.
The 'pair of lice lost' hypothesis is also unsatisfactory
when compared to divergence date estimates. For the 'pair
of lice lost' hypothesis to be correct we must assume that
divergence between Pthirus pubis and Pthirus gorillae is
roughly contemporaneous with the split of gorilla from
the lineage leading to chimpanzees and humans (i.e., ca.
7 MYA). Our divergence date estimates of roughly 3–4
MYA (Table 1) is much younger than the host divergence
of 7 MYA [10] and is even younger than the divergence
between chimpanzees and humans (ca. 6 MYA).
The estimates of divergence dates argue for a more complex evolutionary history than estimated by reconciliation
analysis. While reconciliation analysis serves to find the
most parsimonious reconstruction of host and parasite
evolutionary history by maximizing cospeciation events
and minimizing the cost of the reconstruction, it can only
identify possible scenarios describing the evolutionary
history between associated taxa. Incorporating branch
length data in other analyses is necessary to determine
which scenario best fits the observed data. For example,
post-hoc Mantel tests are commonly used to look for overall correlation in host and parasite data sets [16]. However, we have too few taxa to perform such an analysis,
and we have instead relied upon ad-hoc phylogenetic tests
to determine whether certain nodes of cospeciation were
contemporaneous.

To further examine the validity of the 'pair of lice lost'
hypothesis, we assessed whether the divergence of the two
Pthirus species was contemporaneous with the host divergence of roughly 7 MYA. The branch length between the
two Pthirus species in the best-fit ML louse tree was artificially lengthened to approximate a branch that is the same
age as the branch between Pediculus schaeffi and Pediculus
humanus, thereby representing the split between chimp
and human lice. It is widely known that the gorilla, chimpanzees, and human divergence times are very close in
age, so if our estimate is contemporaneous with the divergence of chimpanzees and humans (the most conservative
expected age), then we cannot rule out true contemporaneous times of divergence between the two Pthirus species
and their hosts. The likelihood score of this constrained

tree (with a branch length approximating a 6 million year
divergence between Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis) was
significantly worse than the true louse tree (where the estimated divergence was closer to 3–4 MYA; d.f. = 6, χ2 =
12.91, p = 0.044). We can therefore reject contemporaneous divergence events and we can conclude that the split
between the human and gorilla species of Pthirus diverged
much more recently than the split between humans and
gorillas or even humans and chimpanzees. The divergence
within Pthirus is therefore the result of a host switch from
gorillas to humans (loosely defined) roughly 3–4 MYA, as
predicted in the 'recent host switch' hypothesis.
We can similarly examine the divergence date estimation
for the branch between Pthirus and Pediculus, which the

Mean divergence date estimates (in millions of years) for the clades shown in Figure 3 (see Figure 3 for clade numbers). Divergence estimates using
a 20–25 calibration point for the split between Old World primate lice (Pedicinus) and Anthropoid primate lice (Pediculus and Pthirus) in multidivtime
are given in the first three columns (95% credibility intervals in parentheses). Mean divergence date estimates using 20 MYA and 25 MYA calibration
points for the split between Old World and Anthropoid primate lice using the Langley Fitch model in r8s are indicated in the final four columns for
the Cox1+EF1α combined analysis and the Cox1 gene alone.

'recent host switch' model would predict to be 7 MYA.
Our estimates were much older (Table 1), and shortening
the branch length artificially between Pthirus and Pediculus
to resemble a divergence near 7 MYA can be easily rejected
(p < 0.01). These analyses support an ancient duplication
at that node, consistent with the 'pair of lice lost' model.
Therefore, contrary to the results of the reconciliation
analysis, the divergence date estimates predict a much less
parsimonious explanation of current primate louse distributions: a combination of the 'recent host switch' and
'pair of lice lost' hypotheses.
Given our estimates of divergence dates, the most likely
evolutionary history is that Pthirus and Pediculus diverged
on an ancestor of chimpanzee, human, and gorilla
roughly 13 MYA (a duplication event), with each genus
then having the potential to cospeciate with descendent
hosts (Figure 4). However, only the gorillas retained Pthirus with an extinction of Pthirus on the branch leading to
both humans and chimpanzees (Figure 4). Pediculus was
maintained on the lineage leading to humans and chimpanzees but lost from the gorilla lineage, and the two
resulting species (Pediculus schaeffi and Pediculus humanus)
diverged in tandem with their primate hosts roughly six
million years ago (Figure 4). Approximately 3–4 MYA, a
Pthirus species switched from the gorilla lineage to the lineage leading to modern humans. It is important to note
that this happened after the divergence of chimpanzees
and humans and that these data suggest humans acquired
their pubic louse from gorillas not recently, but rather 3–
4 million years ago. In total, this coevolutionary scenario
requires four evolutionary steps (one duplication, two
losses, and one host switch), and is a combination of both
the 'recent host switch' and the 'pair of lice lost' hypotheses.

Conclusion
Evidence suggests that Pthirus pubis has been associated
with humans for several million years, and likely arrived
on humans via a host switch from gorillas. Despite the fact

that human pubic lice are primarily transmitted via sexual
contact, such contact is not required to explain the host
switch. Parasites often switch from a given species to a
predator of that species [17], and are sometimes found to
switch to unrelated hosts in communally used areas, such
as roosting or nesting sites [18]. The host switch in question could have resulted from any form of contact
between archaic humans and gorillas including, but not
limited to, feeding on or living among gorillas. Regardless
of how the transfer occurred, suitable habitat had to be
available on the new human host for the host switch to be
successful. For example, it is possible that the switch of
Pthirus from gorillas to humans coincides with a change in
available niche space in humans, such as the loss of body
hair. Further study, however, is required to test such a
hypothesis.
Because Pthirus has been associated with humans for several million years, this taxon can be examined in the same
way that Pediculus humanus has to study the evolutionary
history of its human host [9,19,20]. Pthirus pubis represents an independent, ecological replicate that went
through the same evolutionary history on humans as their
head/body lice, and can be used to test predictions made
from Pediculus humanus. Pediculus humanus shows genetic
evidence of population expansion out of Africa roughly
100,000 years ago, which is concordant with host evolutionary history [9]. However, in contrast to the shallow
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene history of humans
(human mtDNA coalesce to a common ancestor within
200,000 years, [21-23]), Pediculus humanus has three
deeply divergent mtDNA lineages that share a MRCA ca. 2
million years ago, which is far older than the age of their
modern human hosts [9]. Perhaps a worldwide sample of
Pthirus pubis will mirror that of Pediculus humanus, and
show both the population expansion 100,000 years ago
and the three deeply divergent mtDNA lineages. Understanding human evolutionary history from the perspective of its parasites may provide useful insight into a brief
period of history that is not fully recorded in the host fos-

sil record or in host DNA [24]. However, if parasites are to
provide much clarity, it will likely be only after many
human parasites have been examined.
The advent of parsimony-based reconciliation analysis
has permitted many researchers to assess phylogenetic
congruence in a wide array of host-parasite assemblages.
However, this method is more limited than Bayesian
approaches [25] to studying cophylogenetics, which evaluate not only topological congruence but also the comparative timing of host and parasite divergences. It is
imperative that we continue to put into practice the theoretical work that has propelled systematists forward in
recent years. Only then can we hope to uncover the more
complex interactions between hosts and parasites.

Methods

Samples of Pthirus gorillae (from gorillas), Pthirus pubis
(from humans), Pediculus humanus (from humans), Pediculus schaeffi (from chimpanzees), Pedicinus hamadryas

were collected for this study (Table 2). Lice in the genus
Pedicinus parasitize only Cercopithecoid monkeys (Old
World Monkeys; OWM) whereas the genera Pediculus and
Pthirus parasitize only the Anthropoid primates (apes). All
lice were preserved in 95% EtOH and stored at -80°C.
DNA was extracted from louse specimens using the technique of Johnson and Clayton [26] and Reed et al. [9],

which enabled extraction of whole genomic DNA from
each louse while retaining the entire louse body as a
voucher specimen. The Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, California) was used to isolate
genomic DNA from the body of each louse according to
louse-specific protocols [9,26,27]. After DNA extraction,
lice were mounted on slides and retained as vouchers.
Voucher specimens will be deposited in the Price Institute
for Phthirapteran Research collection (University of
Utah).
PCR and sequencing
PCR amplification and sequencing of a portion of the
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene
(Cox1; 858 bp) was performed using the primers
LCO1718 [9] and H7005 [16]. PCR amplification and
sequencing of 345 bp of the nuclear elongation factor 1
alpha (EF-1α) gene were performed using the primers
For3 and Cho10 [28]. Double-stranded PCR amplifications for both Cox1 and EF-1α were performed in 25 μl
reaction volumes using 10 μl of Eppendorf HotMaster
PCR Mix (Fisher Scientific), 1 μl of each primer (at 10
mM), and 2 μl of DNA template. The amplification protocol required an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 10
min, followed by 5 cycles of 94°C (1 min), 48°C (1 min),
and 65°C (2 min), then 30 cycles of 94°C (1 min), 52°C
(1 min), and 65°C (2 min) and a final extension of 65°C
for 10 minutes. Amplified fragments were purified using
ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation) and sequenced in both
directions. Sequences were edited using Sequencher v.

and aligned by eye using Se-Al v2.0a11 http://
evolve.zps.ox.ac.uk/Se-Al/Se-Al.html. Primer sequences
were removed and sequences were trimmed in reference
to the translated protein sequence using Se-AL v2.01a11
and MacClade 4.0 [29]. All sequences were submitted to
[Genbank: EF152552-EF152564] and alignments to
[TreeBase: #SN3269]. Sequences of the Cox1 gene from
the primate host taxa were downloaded [Genbank:
NC001643,
NC001645,
NC001992,
NC001807,
NC008219]. EF-1α sequences were not available for several primate taxa, and were therefore not examined.
Phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analyses
The partition homogeneity test [30] in PAUP*4.0b10 [31]
was used to evaluate phylogenetic congruence of the louse
Cox1 and EF-1α data sets. One thousand partition replicates were analyzed by maximum parsimony (heuristic
search option with random addition replicates and tree
bisection-reconnection branch swapping). Modeltest [32]
was used to determine the best-fit ML model for the
molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on
host and parasite data sets using maximum likelihood
(ML) with branch and bound searches using the best-fit
model in PAUP* 4.0b10 [31]. Nonparametric bootstraps
(100 replicates) were performed to assess nodal support
for the louse phylogeny. ML searches were performed with
and without the 'enforce clock' constraint in order to test
the hypothesis of a molecular clock in the Cox1 and EF-1α
louse datasets. The resulting ML host and parasite trees
with branch lengths estimated from the best-fit ML model
were then used in cophylogenetic analyses.

TreeMap (v. 2.0.2; [7]) was used to determine whether
host and parasite trees were more similar to one another
than would be expected by chance. Default costs for evolutionary events (codivergence = 0, host switching = 1,
duplication = 1, and loss = 1) were used. Significance values were calculated from a sample of 1,000 randomly generated trees.

Divergence date estimation
Because the lice and their primate hosts showed significant codivergence and because molecular data did not differ significantly from clocklike behavior, divergence dates
were estimated using methods that both adhere to and
relax the molecular clock. Divergence dates were estimated in the program r8s [33], using the Langley and
Fitch (LF) model which assumes a molecular clock. Dates
were also estimated using a parametric Bayesian approach
[34] in the program multidivtime. This method relaxes the
molecular clock and allows rate variation among genes
and lineages, and it is therefore appropriate for datasets
that utilize more than one molecular marker. The topology resulting from ML analysis of the combined 2-gene
data set was used in multidivtime. The Cox1 best-fit ML tree
and the combined 2-gene topologies were used in r8s.
Divergence dates were estimated using each individual
gene (with branch lengths optimized on the best ML tree)
as well as a combined 2-gene dataset.

For the parametric Bayesian analysis, model parameters
for the F84+Γ model were estimated for each gene separately using the baseml program in PAML v3.14 [35]. These
parameters were then used in the program estbranches
[34,36] to estimate the ML and the variance-covariance
matrix of the branch length estimates for each gene.
Lastly, the program multidivtime [34,36], utilizing the output files from estbranches and implementing Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, was used to estimate
prior and posterior distribution of rates and divergence
time estimates among lineages. The prior assumption for
the mean and standard deviation of the time of the
ingroup root node (rttm) was set to 3.0 time units, where
1 time unit represents 10 million years. This value corresponds to the upper limit of the split between hominoid
and cercopithecoid primates. The mean and standard
deviation for the prior distribution of the rate of evolution
at the ingroup node (rtrate and rtratesd) was determined
following the protocol of Jansa et al. (rttm; [37]). To avoid
violation of the definition of the prior, rtratesd was set to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/7

its maximum value (equal to rtrate). The Markov chain
was initialized by randomly selecting the initial parameter
value and each Markov chain was sampled every 100
cycles for 1,000,000 generations with a burn in of
100,000 cycles.

A calibration point of 22.5 ± 2.5 MYA was used for the
split between Pedicinus and Pediculus+Pthirus. This divergence of 20–25 MYA corresponds to the split between
OWM and apes [38-41]. Since lice and their primate hosts
show significant cospeciation, we can use this well-established host calibration based on fossil data to calibrate the
louse phylogenetic trees. It is preferable to use more than
one calibration point when estimating divergence dates
[42,43], however the small number of nodes in our trees
make that impossible. Furthermore, Reed et al. [9] showed
that the calibration point of 20–25 MYA yielded estimated clade ages that were very similar to those estimated
from a calibration of 5–7 million years between the
human and chimpanzee lice (P. humanus and P. schaeffi,
respectively).
