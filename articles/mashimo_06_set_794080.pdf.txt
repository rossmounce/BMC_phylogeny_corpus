Abstract
Background: The National Bio Resource Project for the Rat in Japan (NBRP-Rat) is focusing on
collecting, preserving and distributing various rat strains, including spontaneous mutant, transgenic,
congenic, and recombinant inbred (RI) strains. To evaluate their value as models of human diseases,
we are characterizing them using 109 phenotypic parameters, such as clinical measurements,
internal anatomy, metabolic parameters, and behavioral tests, as part of the Rat Phenome Project.
Here, we report on a set of 357 simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers and 122 rat
strains, which were genotyped by the marker set.
Results: The SSLP markers were selected according to their distribution patterns throughout the
whole rat genome with an average spacing of 7.59 Mb. The average number of informative markers
between all possible pairs of strains was 259 (72.5% of 357 markers), showing their high degree of
polymorphism. From the genetic profile of these rat inbred strains, we constructed a rat family tree
to clarify their genetic background.
Conclusion: These highly informative SSLP markers as well as genetically and phenotypically
defined rat strains are useful for designing experiments for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and
to choose strategies for developing new genetic resources. The data and resources are freely
available at the NBRP-Rat web site [1].

Background
Over the last several years, rat genomic data has grown
dramatically, including the genomic sequence [2], single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [3], and microarray
gene-expression profiles [4]. Several rat genetic markers,
such as simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs),

expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and sequence-tagged sites
(STSs), have also been developed and integrated into a
high-density rat radiation hybrid map [5], resulting in the
comparative mapping of different species, such as
between humans and mice. Such infrastructure development of rat genomic resources provides important inforPage 1 of 8

mation for improving the functional annotation of
genomic sequences underlying rat QTL and identifying
candidate genes for human complex diseases. Although
more than 1000 quantitative trait loci have been mapped
thus far onto rat chromosomal regions [6], only a few of
the mapped QTLs have been identified at the molecular
level, such as those for type-I [7] and type-II [8] diabetes,
arthritis [9], or fatty acid metabolism [10]. There is a need
for functional infrastructure improvement not only for
genomic resources and experimental tools, but also for
animal resources themselves.
The National Bio Resource Project for the Rat (NBRP-Rat)
was started in July, 2002 [11]. The major aim of this
project is to improve the experimental environment of rat
research by collecting existing rat strains, cryopreserving
their sperm and embryos, and distributing them to interested researchers. Until now, more than 300 rat strains
have been deposited into the NBRP-Rat. They are all
indexed in a publicly accessible database [12]. The biological resource at NBRP-Rat provides the opportunity to
supply any deposited rat strain on request to interested

scientists around the world, allowing researchers to accelerate their research pace, and to conserve animals and
money. Furthermore, to enhance the value of the collected strains and to supply well-characterized rats to the
research community, we are promoting the Rat Phenome
Project [13], which describes many deposited rat strains
with wide-ranging phenotypic measurements comprising
109 parameters: functional observational battery (neurobehavior), behavioral studies, blood pressure, biochemical blood tests, and hematological, urological, and
anatomical parameters. These data can be systematically
viewed by 'strain ranking' for each parameter, which
allows researchers to easily and simultaneously compare
phenotypic values of multiple strains and to identify new
rat models for specific experiments.
In parallel with the Rat Phenome Project, we are genotyping deposited rat strains. The two major objectives of this
study were (1) to choose highly polymorphic SSLP markers that would facilitate genome-wide scans in as many as
possible crosses between inbred strains of rat, and (2)
using these markers to genetically evaluate rat strains

deposited into NBRP-Rat. These highly informative SSLP
markers in combination with phenotypically defined rat
strains are powerful tools for researchers to design various
experiments, such as for assessing QTL phenotypes.

Results and discussion
Selection of rat SSLP markers
A panel of 384 SSLP markers was first selected from publicly available data in the Rat Genome Database [14] with
two objectives: (1) to obtain the maximum polymorphisms among the listed rat inbred strains and (2) to
cover the rat genome except for chromosome Y. Out of
384 markers, 18 failed to be or were poorly amplified by
PCR, 7 were amplified as double or multiple bands, and 2
turned out to be designed for the same microsatellite
region as other markers. A total of 357 markers were
finally used for subsequent genomic screening of rat
inbred strains (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1), of
which 323 were identified by their physical position in
two genome sequence databases, the Ensembl Genome
Browser [15] and UCSC Genome Browser [16]. All 34 unidentified markers of the rat genome sequence have been
mapped onto a previously reported linkage map (SHRSP
× BN cross) [17] or on the radiation hybrid map (RH map
version 3.4) [17] published by RGD [14]. The average distance of the marker was 7.59 Mb with the largest gap of
63.0 Mb around the center region of chromosome 6,
which roughly corresponds to 28 cM. Detailed information on the SSLP marker set used is available on our website [18].
Genomic profiles and chart tools
We genotyped 122 rat strains with 357 SSLP markers,
including 65 inbred strains, 22 substrains, 29 recombinant inbred (RI) strains, and 6 wild rats. The allele size
data for each strain are available as genetic profiles on our
SSLP database [18]. On the genomic profiles pages, the
genotyped strains can be sorted according to their allele
size for each marker to easily compare their genetic differences. Researchers can also select any pairwise combination or multiple strains to a maximum of 5 strains to
retrieve informative markers for each possible cross.

In addition to the genomic profiles, we have introduced a
pedigree-like charting tool that displays genetic differences among the genotyped rat strains (Fig. 2). By selecting one rat strain, its genetic background is instantly
compared against all of the strains genotyped at NBRPRat. This allows for the selection of a crossing partner
strain for QTL analysis or for the easy construction of congenic strains. For instance, BN strains would be good candidates to be crossed with SHR/Izm for genetic analysis,
owing to their large genetic diversity (Fig. 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/19

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
assumed to be the best source of genetic variations,
accounting for quantitative phenotypic differences
between individual strains, and thus became the most
promising genetic markers for QTL mapping on dense
physical maps [19]. Recently, more than 11,000 rat SSLP
markers have been constructed and are publicly available
[20]. However, SSLP markers have proved and continue to
be a useful genetic tool, particularly in initial mapping
studies, owing to their great variety in product size, their
easier detection and equal distribution on the genome. In
our project, we selected 357 SSLP markers which are
equally distributed through the whole rat genome for
genetic screening of various rat strains (Fig. 1). The average number of marker alleles among the 122 rat inbred
strains tested here was 9.78 ± 2.87, indicating high polymorphisms of the markers. This allows researchers to
select informative SSLP markers throughout the rat
genome to evaluate their genetic background.
A set of genetically defined rat strains
The 122 rat strains tested here comprise 7381 potential
crossing pairs. The polymorphic rate between all possible
pairs is shown in supplementary Table 2. Among all crossing pairs, 19.3% have more than 300 informative markers
and 87.9% have at least 200 informative markers out of
our set of 357 markers (supplementary Fig. 1). The greatest number of informative markers is 341 (96%), derived
from the pair between the German wild rat G3 and
SHRSR/Ta. The average number of informative markers
for a potential cross was 259 ± 21 SD (72.5% of 357 markers), indicating a higher polymorphic rate of our SSLP
marker set than that for previously reported data [21,22].

Table 1 indicates the polymorphic rate among 25 commonly used rat inbred strains. All pairs between the
strains have at least 107 polymorphic markers (more than
30%). The average number of markers for crosses between
25 commonly used laboratory strains was 271 ± 11 SD
(76.0%), which corresponds to an average marker density
of 10.0 Mb or 5.6 cM. The highest rate of polymorphisms
was 92% between BN and DON. BN, whose genome was
closely sequenced [2], has often been used as a crossing
partner for linkage and QTL analysis because of its genetic
diversity from other inbred rat strains. In contrast to this
general assumption, our data suggest it could be promising for certain genetic studies to use the IS strain because
of its higher average rate of polymorphisms and various
interesting phenotypes (hypotonic, low cholesterol, etc.),
compared to commonly used rat strains such as BN. Given
that the IS strain was established by crossing a Japanese
wild male and a Wistar female as a model for vertebral
malformation [23], this strain is a useful but almost
unused genetic resource.

Researchers can select a rat strain to instantly compare its
genetic background against all rat strains typed at NBRP-Rat.

Phenotype data are also available for the above genetically
defined rat strains on our phenome database [24]. A listing, known as 'strain ranking' (Fig. 3), allows the sorting
of more than 100 rat strains according to their phenotypic
values. For instance, Figures 3A and 3B indicate that commonly used inbred strains have a wide variability of values
for phenotypic parameters, such as body weight and
blood pressure, respectively. The charting tool can also
provide a column chart or a scatter plot for two selected
parameters to indicate the correlation between selected rat
strains (Figs 3C and 3D). These phenotype and genotype
data allow for the easy selection of appropriate rat strains
for various research fields [13].
A family tree of inbred rat strains
Information about the relationships between inbred rat
strains is useful for determining the extent of polymorphisms between strains when designing crosses and for
evaluating the genetic background of strains when assessing phenotypes. Using the genotype profile derived by our
357 SSLP marker set, we constructed a phylogenetic tree
for 93 rat strains (Fig. 4). This tree includes all genotyped
strains except for recombinant inbred (RI) ones. Although
German and Japanese wild rat strains have not yet been
deposited in NBRP-Rat, we used their DNA for phyloge-

As shown in Fig. 3, the phylogenetic relationships of rat
strains in the family tree were well resolved and appeared
to be mostly consistent with their known histories [26]
and previously reported rat family trees [21,22]. As
expected, Japanese and German wild rats as well as BN
strains, which originated from a brown mutant in a stock
of wild rats maintained by DH King and P Aptekman in
Philadelphia [26], were distant from each other and from
other strains of commonly used laboratory rats. It is
assumed that a large proportion of laboratory rat strains
originated from the Wistar strain, which were brought to
the Wistar Institute by Donaldson in 1906. However, the
origin of this strain is still unknown [27]. In the family
tree, all Wistar strains including those bred in Japan as
well as in other countries, are apparently very different
from the group of wild rat strains and BN strains. Further
genetic analysis of wild rats derived from other countries,
such as China or India, or fancy rats might clarify the origin of the laboratory rat, especially the Wistar-derived
strains. In mice, the majority of laboratory strains not
derived from wild species are assumed to have originated
from a relatively small group of ancestral subsets [28]. In
the rat family tree, the laboratory rat strain KZ-Leprfa,
which originated from Zucker-fatty rats, belongs to a subgroup of wild rats. Furthermore, IS and KYN strains are
historically known to be established by crossing Wistar
rats with Japanese wild rats [23]; [29], and this is supported by their longer branch length in our topological
tree and relatively higher polymorphic rate from other
laboratory strains (Table 1). These observations mean that
such inbred strains of rat can provide alternative genetic
variations when assessing QTL phenotypes.

Conclusion
The most unique and important point of this study is the
availability of many inbred rat strains, which have been
genetically defined with a set of equally distributed SSLP
markers present throughout the rat genome. Rat strains
have also been systematically characterized regarding phenotypic measurements comprising 109 parameters in the
Rat Phenome Project [13]. These genetically and phenotypically characterized rat strains can be freely acquired
from NBRP-Rat with a contracting material transfer agreement (MTA). Researchers can easily search for their strains
of interest according to their phenotypic and genetic
requirements by comparing more than 100 inbred strains
using visual charting tools in our Rat Phenome and SSLP
database. A catalogue of these rat strains provides the
opportunity to identify the most suitable parental strains
for setting up an appropriate cross to identify QTLs. In

examined rat strains.

Primers and PCR
Primers for the 384 SSLP markers tested here were selected
from the Rat Genome Database [14]. Detailed information on the primer set is available on our website [18].
PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 µl
under the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min for 1
cycle, 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1
min for 35 cycles. The final reaction conditions were 100
ng genomic DNA, 200 µM each dNTP, 1.0 mM MgCl2,
0.66 µM each primer, and 0.4 U Taq DNA polymerase
(GibcoBRL). The forward primer of each pair was labeled
on the 5' end with a fluorescent dye. The size of the PCR
products was determined with internal size standards in
each capillary on an ABI3100 DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree of rat strains was obtained through
maximum parsimony analysis implemented in PAUP
4.0b10 [25]. First, the allele size of the 357 SSLP markers
was transformed to discrete characters in such a way that
any size allele differed by one step. A heuristic search

All deposited rats at the NBRP-Rat are maintained in specific pathogen-free (SPF) areas or are cryopreserved.
Detailed information concerning deposited strains, the
depositor, origin, generations, references, deposition status, usage restrictions etc., can be obtained from our website [1]. MITB, MITC, and MITE are Japanese wild-rat
strains (partially inbred) of Mitake B, C, and E [30], while
HR2, G3, and RU1 are individual males of German wild
rats [31]. Although these wild-rat strains and some commercial strains have not yet been deposited in NBRP-Rat,
we used their DNA as controls and for genetic enrichment
for our phylogenetic analysis. For all markers that
appeared to be bi-allelic, in particular for the wild German
rats, we always considered only the shorter allele for phylogenetic calculations.

The genomic DNA of the deposited rat strains at NBRPRat was extracted from the tail. The tip of the tail was
digested with lysis buffer (100 mM Tris- HCl, 12.5 mM
EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
0.8 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50°C overnight. Genomic
DNA was extracted using the automatic DNA purification

Figure tree of 93 inbred rat strains
A family4
A family tree of 93 inbred rat strains. A phylogenetic
tree was developed through a heuristic search for maximum
parsimony implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 [25]. TreeView [32]
was used to display the radial tree.

method was used in PAUP to search for optimal trees
because the genotype data set for the 122 rat strains was
too large for single-step computer analysis. Unordered
characters were defined such that any state was capable of
transforming directly to any other state with equal cost
(Fitch parsimony). Two basic strategies are combined in
the heuristic search strategy: a stepwise addition to obtain
an initial tree, and branch swapping for rearrangement to
find shorter trees. Under the analysis, 100 random addition-sequence replications were done, followed by a tree
bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm
with the COLAPSE option on to collapse any zero-length
branches and with the STEEPEST DESCENT option off.
Tree stability was estimated by bootstrap analysis of 100
replicates, sampling characters with equal probability.
TreeView [32] was used to display the radial tree.

supplementary Figure 1The number of informative markers per cross.
Pairwise combinations of 122 inbred rat strains were analyzed to determine the number of markers that were polymorphic for each cross. The
number of informative crosses was plotted against the number of informative markers for each pair of strains. The tail on the left side of the histogram displays crosses between closely related substrains, including a
cluster of ACI, BN, F344, and SHR strains. The mean number of informative markers per cross for all pairs of strains analyzed was 259 ± 21 SD
(72.5% of 357 markers).
