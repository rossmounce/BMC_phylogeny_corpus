Abstract
Background: The ubiquitin 26S/proteasome system (UPS), a serial cascade process of protein
ubiquitination and degradation, is the last step for most cellular proteins. There are many genes
involved in this system, but are not identified in many species. The accumulating availability of
genomic sequence data is generating more demands in data management and analysis. Genomics
data of plants such as Populus trichocarpa, Medicago truncatula, Glycine max and others are now
publicly accessible. It is time to integrate information on classes of genes for complex protein
systems such as UPS.
Results: We developed a database of higher plants' UPS, named 'plantsUPS'. Both automated
search and manual curation were performed in identifying candidate genes. Extensive annotations
referring to each gene were generated, including basic gene characterization, protein features, GO
(gene ontology) assignment, microarray probe set annotation and expression data, as well as crosslinks among different organisms. A chromosome distribution map, multi-sequence alignment, and
phylogenetic trees for each species or gene family were also created. A user-friendly web interface
and regular updates make plantsUPS valuable to researchers in related fields.
Conclusion: The plantsUPS enables the exploration and comparative analysis of UPS in higher
plants. It now archives > 8000 genes from seven plant species distributed in 11 UPS-involved gene
families. The plantsUPS is freely available now to all users at http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/
plantsUPS.

Background
The ubiquitin/26S proteasome system (UPS) is the major
pathway of protein degradation. UPS can affect all aspects
of cellular function, and plays an important role in physiological processes like hormonal responses, biotic stress
and photomorphogenesis. In UPS, substrate proteins destined for degradation are tagged with 76-residue ubiquitin
proteins through a serial cascade process of so-called
ubiquitination, and finally hydrolysed by 26S proteas-

ome. There are three steps in ubiquitination, catalyzed by
three different enzymes or enzyme complexes: ubiquitin
activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
(E2), and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). There are approximately 1300 E3s in the Arabidopsis genome, and similarly large numbers in other plants. However, in most
plant species, the genome-wide classification and annotation of UPS genes, especially E3 families, are not yet available. The rapidly accumulating genome sequences has

made those of seven important higher plants: Arabidopsis
(Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), Populus trichocarpa, Medicago truncatula, grape (Vitis vinifera), soybean (Glycine max), and maize (Zea mays) publicly
available. Consequently, analysis work is now inevitable
and urgent. However, until now there was no available
database concerning higher plants' UPS. The only comprehensive UPS database is PlantsUBQ [1], which provides information for only a single Arabidopsis species. To
help researchers interested in plants' UPS, we developed
the platform 'plantsUPS'. This archives > 8000 genes from
the above seven plant species, belonging to 11 UPS gene
families (one each for E1 and E2, and nine for E3).

Construction and content
Genome sequence data acquisition
Arabidopsis genome data used in plantsUPS is from TAIR
([2] release 8, and rice data is from the Rice Genome
Annotation Project [3] release 5. Populus, soybean, grape,
Medicago and maize genome data are compiled from the
Populus genome project [4], Soybean Genome Project
[5], Genoscope [6], MGSC [7] and MaizeSequence.org
[8], respectively, and all used the latest versions available
in February 2009. We used maize protein-coding genes for
analysis; however, due to the highly complex and unfinished annotation of the maize genome, genes in plantsUPS should not be considered as an integrated UPS
profile of maize.
UPS genes identification
In plantsUPS, we used BLAST [9] and InterproScan [10]
searches in computational prediction to identify UPS gene
members for 11 gene families. We used BLAST (E-values ≤
10.0) as the primary search before performing InterproS-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/227

can. However, for RBX (Ring-Box) and DDB which is a
component of CDD (CUL4-RBX1-CDD complex) families there is no consensus IPR (Interpro Scan) accession
for identification. Thus only BLAST was used (E-value ≤
1e–30). We used InterproScan results as the main evidence in estimation. Gene families and the corresponding
IPR accessions used are presented in supplement Table S1
[see Additional file 1]. Subsequently, we did manual curation to reduce the false-positive rate, based on published
reports.
Database architecture
We constructed and configured plantsUPS upon a typical
LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) platform. Dataset was stored in MySQL 4.1 [see Additional file 2], and
web interface was achieved by PHP scripts (PHP version
4.4) on Red Hat Linux, powered by an Apache server.

Utility and discussion
Web function and comparative tools
We designed a user-friendly website interface. Users can
browse or search different levels of content taxa by various
choices. Using the basic browse function, users can
browse every species of UPS genes by setting a limit of
gene family or chromosome number. Location distribution maps, multi-sequence alignments, and phylogenetic
trees can also be browsed quickly (Figure 1). The chromosome maps containing gene loci located on the chromosomal linkages were generated and visualized using
GenomePixelizer [11], which give users a direct scope to
the distribution of UPS genes on chromosomes and are
especially useful in observing tandem duplications [see
Additional file 3]. The plantsUPS supports a comprehensive search function, for example, searching more than

one species or gene family simultaneously, or specifying
certain inquiries like gene model name, GO (gene ontology) ID or IPR accession. The association with a brief summary on the page can provide users a useful platform for
searching and also for comparative study of different level
information. For Arabidopsis and rice, we further provided a Gbrowser tool for comparative study of UPS and
non-UPS genes, and provided a graphical way to explore
expression of Arabidopsis genes under stress treatments.
Extensive gene annotation
To better facilitate users inspecting each single UPS member, we collected and organized exhaustive information
for genes in plantsUPS. In the gene browsing page (Figure
2), users can find a gene's basic information, gene and
protein structure features with brief model figures, GO
annotation, as well as identified probes on different
microarray platforms. Also on this page, pre-computed
top-matched hits by BLAST search against genes from
plantsUPS, Refseq and UniProt databases can be useful
for cross-organism study. The best reciprocal hits are
marked for use in identifying putative orthologs.
Microarray expression value
To explore expression of UPS genes, we retrieved and categorized microarray expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [12]. We picked out eight different

GEO platforms (GPL) including 89 GEO series (GSE) data
from 11 GPLs in plantsUPS (Table 1), and collected most
parts of GSEs for these GPLs in GEO. For GPL198 of Arabidopsis, we mainly used AtGenExpress Consortium's
data because of its high quality and experimental continuity. To provide better understanding, we classified 89
GSEs into five different aspects: tissue, stress, development, treatment and other, based on their experimental
descriptions [see Additional file 4]. Users can directly
inspect gene expression values by choosing any one of the
above five classes.

Discussion
Six of the seven organisms contained > 1000 members
(Table 2), except for grape. This result matched our primary expectation and infers the importance and complexity of UPS in plants. The UPS genes took up around 2.2%
of genomic genes in most species, except Arabidopsis with
much higher at 4.1%. At the gene-family level, F-box and
RING finger families of E3 were the most abundant
groups. In Xu's newly published paper [13], F-box genes
in Arabidopsis, Poplar and rice were identified as 692, 337
and 779, respectively. These numbers are similar to our
result in plantsUPS (654, 335 and 702, respectively), and
the unmatched parts may be caused by applying different
automated prediction methods or stringency criteria.
We chose the BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, Bric-aBrac) family from Poplar, Medicago, grape and soybean for
phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 3) [also see Additional
file 5, 6, 7, 8]. Individual members of the trees were further clustered and color-coded, based on the nature of
protein domains/motifs. There were 11 classes characterized: ankyin, armadillo, meprin and TRAF homology
(MATH), NPH3, TAZ type Zn Finger, tetratricopeptide
(TRP) repeats, pentapeptide, F5/8 type C domain, BTB/
Kelch-associated (BACK) domain, other domains, and
BTB domains only. Ankyin, armadillo, MATH, NPH3 and
F5/8 type C domains were recognized in all four organisms appended to the BTB domain, while other domains
may be absent in one or two species. The numbers of

Six species have > 1000 UPS members. F-box and RING finger families are the most abundant gene families.
*BLAST search for RBX or DDB families may find no qualified hits in some species, and we present 'null' for such situations.
**For reasons of ongoing annotating and unexpected complexity in maize, the numbers here may not reflect the integrated UPS profile for maize.

Supplement Table S1. IPR accessions for each gene family used in
identifying BLAST and InterproScan search are used in identifying
genes involved in UPS. The IPR accessions presented were mainly used
for different families. No consensus IPR accession was plausible for RBX
and DDB families, thus we mainly used BLAST search in these cases.

Phylogenetic trees of
Phylogenetic trees of Poplar, grape, Medicago and
soybean BTB protein families. BTB domains in the BTB
family of four organisms identified by InterproScan were used
to generate a midpoint-rooted NJ (neighbor joining) tree.
The trees were created by Mega 4.0 with 1000 bootstrap
replicates. Solid boxes on the nodes of the trees present
higher bootstrap support (≥ 90%), and hollow ones indicate
moderate (≥ 60%). Individual branches are color-coded by
the nature of protein domains. We characterized all BTB
proteins into 11 classes. Expanded views of trees with more
detail can be found in supplement Figures S3–6 [see Additional file 5, 6, 7, 8].

MATH domains in Poplar and Medicago were similar to
previous results [14], but interestingly as many as 24
MATH-domain-containing genes were identified in the
dicotyledon soybean.
In the future, we will continue to incorporate new information, develop more comparative tools for plantsUPS,
and extend the available species. Regular update and relative analysis will provide users up-to-date UPS information.

Conclusion
The plantsUPS is the first platform concerning UPS in
seven sequenced higher plants. It will assist searchers in
related fields by providing comprehensive information on
UPS gene families and members of these families. The
plantsUPS resource is freely available via http://bioinfor
matics.cau.edu.cn/plantsUPS.
