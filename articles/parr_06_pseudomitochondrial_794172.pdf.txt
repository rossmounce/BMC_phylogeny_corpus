Abstract
Background: Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) are a potential source of
contamination during mitochondrial DNA PCR amplification. This possibility warrants careful
experimental design and cautious interpretation of heteroplasmic results.
Results: Here we report the cloning and sequencing of numts loci, amplified from human tissue
and rho-zero (ρ0) cells (control) with primers known to amplify the mitochondrial genome. This
paper is the first to fully sequence 46 paralogous nuclear DNA fragments that represent the entire
mitochondrial genome. This is a surprisingly small number due primarily to the primer sets used in
this study, because prior to this, BLAST searches have suggested that nuclear DNA harbors
between 400 to 1,500 paralogous mitochondrial DNA fragments. Our results indicate that multiple
numts were amplified simultaneously with the mitochondrial genome and increased the load of
pseudogene signal in PCR reactions. Further, the entire mitochondrial genome was represented by
multiple copies of paralogous nuclear sequences.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that mitochondrial genome disease-associated biomarkers
must be rigorously authenticated to preclude any affiliation with paralogous nuclear pseudogenes.
Importantly, the common perception that mitochondrial template "swamps" numts loci precluding
detectable amplification, depends on the region of the mitochondrial genome targeted by the PCR
reaction and the number of pseudogene loci that may co-amplify. Cloning and relevant sequencing
data will facilitate the correct interpretation. This is the first complete, wet-lab characterization of
numts that represent the entire mitochondrial genome.

Background
The unique maternal inheritance pattern of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), its small genome size, accelerated
mutation rate, lack of recombination, and multiple copy
number per cell, in comparison to nuclear DNA, are ideal
biological traits for investigating evolution, population
genetics and for forensic and medical applications. Thus,
the mitochondrial genome has been used as a biosensor
for the timing and movement of human populations in
antiquity [1,2]. MtDNA analysis is routinely used in forensic biology to type biological material when degradation
prevents nuclear STR amplification [3]. In addition, the
entire mitochondrial molecule has potential medical utility because it can serve as a repository of cancer mutations
and as a biosensor indicative of genetic alterations [4-13].
Frequently, identifying legitimate mtDNA mutations is
confounded by heteroplasmy, a condition in which wildtype and mutant mitochondrial genomes co-exist in a cell.
The interpretation of heteroplasmy can further be confounded by the widespread integration of portions of the
mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome [14,15].
These homologous, yet divergent nuclear and mtDNA
sequences can be co-amplified in PCR reactions intended
to replicate targeted mtDNA sequences only. Although
this problem has previously been considered to be muted
because of the high copy number of mtDNA over corresponding nuclear loci, caution is warranted [16]. For
example, there are specific regions of the mitochondrial
genome that have corresponding nuclear mitochondrial
pseudogenes (numts) distributed across multiple chromosomes. Hence, there are regions of the mitochondrial
genome that have a high nuclear copy number, which are
not completely "swamped" during amplification. We
report that some heteroplasmies detected in prostate cancer samples are a result of co-amplification of these multiple loci.
A large number of manuscripts addressing errors related
to the interpretation of mtDNA and mtDNA heteroplasmy has been published [17-25]. Notably not all these
errors are due to pseudogene co-amplification; however,
mistakes from pseudogenes may increase with improved
sequencing methods and highly sensitive re-sequencing
microarray technologies that have a lower detection limit
than traditional sequencing and which readily detect lowlevel heteroplasmy [11,26]. In some cases, if the heteroplasmy is inherited, it substantially increases the power of
mutation detection, which becomes an important aspect
since heteroplasmy has been reported as an early indication of disease [27-31]. In addition, if the disease process
invokes mitochondrial depletion, this could increase
nuclear pseudogene signal in reactions as a result of
reduced mitochondrial genome copy number [32]. Loss
of mitochondria has been described in several human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/185

cancers [33-36]. As well, the number of mitochondria and
mtDNA copy number vary for different cell types [37-39].
These important matters relating to sequence interpretation have been generally neglected, in part, due to the lack
of numt reference material, which would help investigators determine the relevance of detected mtDNA sequence
variations. Hence, the need to validate somatic mitochondrial mutations is a pressing one.
Heteroplasmic issues have already complicated data
obtained from other species. For example, in elephant
hair, low mtDNA content is the reason why numts were
co-amplified and misinterpreted as authentic mtDNA. In
contrast, numts were not detected in DNA derived from
elephant blood due to the presence of mitochondria-rich
platelets [40]. Moreover, the hominid, Gorilla, is well
known for significant numt interference with mitochondrial sequences, highlighting the need for diligence when
interpreting human mtDNA heteroplasmy [41]. Not surprisingly, the effort for using mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase as a primate "barcode" is plagued by numt amplification as well [42].
Further, laser capture microscopy has improved the ability
to separate and analyze cancer cells, but because of the
decreased amounts of sample DNA, many primer pairs are
required to obtain a robust amplification of the entire
mitochondrial genome [43]. Moreover, a sufficient
number of cells must be captured to avoid incorporation
errors associated with low template quantity [44]. This
will also be relevant to studies that use formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples [45]. The use of many primers
means that smaller amplicons will be synthesized translating into a higher risk of co-amplification of numts and
the potential misinterpretation of heteroplasmic calls.
There is limited in silico and wet-lab evidence indicating
that fragments of the human mitochondrial genome are
embedded in the nuclear DNA archive [46-50]. These
findings emphasize the critical need to minimize erroneous interpretation of heteroplasmy, a vital necessity for
precise forensic discrimination, evolutionary studies, and
potential diagnostics. We provide evidence of numts for
the entire mitochondrial genome by the amplification,
cloning, and identification of numts from rho-zero (ρ0)
cells and clinical cancer specimens. Here we present
results from overlapping primers, which co-amplified
nuclear embedded, paralogous mitochondrial sequence.
Surprisingly, our data shows a relatively small number
(when compared to hypothetical sequence information
obtained from BLAST searches) of multiple nuclear loci
that co-amplify with the mitochondrial genome. These
findings demonstrate that accurate interpretation of heteroplasmy not only requires careful primer design and testing, but also indicates that a compendium of the sequence

information from multiple-copy number numts is an
important reference tool that will facilitate correct mtDNA
interpretation and support reliable mitochondrial
genome sequencing data.

Results

ρ0 cells lack mtDNA
Rho-zero cells were evaluated for the presence of mtDNA.
To ensure that total DNA extracted from ρ0 cells were
indeed devoid of mtDNA, we first performed Southern
blot analyses on DNA extracts from ρ0 cells. Blood was
used as a positive control. No full length mitochondrial
genome signal was observed in ρ0 lanes when the blots
were probed with mtDNA-specific probes (Figure 1a). We
next performed PCR on the DNA extracts with primers
specific to the mitochondrial coding regions. Again, there
were no amplifications observed in the ρ0 templates,

while DNA isolated from blood was amplified, as
expected (data not shown). We used RT-PCR to provide
further evidence that ρ0 cells are indeed devoid of mtDNA
[51]. RT-PCR analysis was performed on RNA samples
from ρ0 cells and normal human skin tissue (epithelial
cells) samples with primers to OXPHOS genes and a
nuclear gene (positive control), 5-aminolevulinate synthase (hALAS) (Table 1). Whereas the hALAS primers
amplified nuclear targets in template from ρ0 and epithelial cells, there was no observable product with mtDNA
primers for the ρ0 cDNA template (Figure 1b), independently confirming the absence of mtDNA in these cells.
Co-amplification of numts and mtDNA
Amplification of the complete mitochondrial genome was
performed on human formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer samples using a set of 34 primers (Table 2). Due to the amount and quality of DNA
recovered, the average amplicon size was limited to 625
bp. Surprisingly, 24 (71%) of the primer sets co-amplified
mitochondrial pseudogenes (Figure 2, and data not
shown). A similar ratio was previously reported by an
independent group using 38 primers (26/38 or 68%)
[16]. In an effort to fully characterize numts that represent
the entire mitochondrial genome, we redesigned the
remaining 10 primers to co-amplify nuclear loci. Thus, we
amplified template from ρ0 cells and subsequently identified (via sequencing) the cloned fragments from the
nucleus. A region of the D-loop (base pairs 16211-420
and 15-711) was recalcitrant to co-amplification using
our mitochondrial primers. Therefore, two chromosome
17 specific primers were designed to capture this D-loop
fragment (Table 2). Hence, a total of 36 primer sets were
used to recover the entire mitochondrial genome from the
nucleus. The sequences representative of the entire mitochondrial genome are provided as an additional material
(additional file 1). Figure 3 is an example of an alignment
to rCRS of three numt clones recovered using primer set
1488F/2084R (Table 2). These three clones were recovered form three separate chromosomes (Chr11 –
NT_009237, Chr5 – NT_006713, and Chr3 –
NT_005612). Similar alignment of our consensus cloned
sequences enabled the assembly of a pseudo-mitochondrial genome (Figure 4).

The following chromosomes were represented in the data:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 20 and X. The number of
paralogous sequences, in some instances, was lower than
the number predicted from BLAST searches (Figure 3, 5).
We demonstrate that there are only a limited number of
multiple copy numts that potentially contribute to a heteroplasmic signal. Subsequently, we systematically
inspected heteroplasmic sites observed in sequences from
the prostate cancer samples for numt contribution using
our cloned ρ0 data as a reference. We discovered false het-

sistently amplified numts from ρ0 cells generating high
molecular weight amplifications in addition to the
expected mtDNA fragments (Figure 7). These findings
confirm the presence of multiple numts loci in the
genome and translate into real concern that numts are
present in amplifications that produce more that one
band or different size amplicons.

Numts co-amplify from clinical samples
Numts co-amplify from clinical samples. A representative gel picture showing amplification of clinical samples with
primers that also amplify ρ0 template is shown. Unlabelled
lanes are the clinical samples. Subsequent analysis of
sequences from this amplification (see Figure 5) revealed the
presence of pseudogene contamination.

Survey of mitochondrial genome mutations associated
with disease suggests caution
Based on our findings that false heteroplasmic sites
occurred when there was co-amplification of multiple
numt loci with the same nucleotide at that particular site,
we compared our cloning data to possible disease associated mutations listed on MITOMAP [52] and common
sites were noted. In addition, a BLAST search was performed for these sites and hits held in common between
the marker and cloning information were scored as well.
Numerous commonalities were noted, which is cause for
concern (Table 3).

Discussion
eroplasmic sites occurred when there was co-amplification of multiple numt loci with the same nucleotide at
that particular site. Base pairs 1709, 1711 and 1719 in one
specific amplicon (1488–2084, 16S rRNA) illustrate this
point. The amplification of this specific region of the
mitochondrial genome also co-amplified numts on chromosomes 3, 5 and 11 (Figures 3, 6). All three chromosomes have an A as opposed to a G, which correspond to
mitochondrial positions 1709 and 1719. Using automated DNA sequencing, these multi-copy numts were
detected as heteroplasmies at positions 1709 and 1719
(Figure 6). At position 1711, chromosomes 5 and 11 have
a C as does the tissue; however, chromosome 3 has a T. A
weak heteroplasmic signal is evident by a minute T peak,
but because of the poor detection limit of fluorescent
sequencing, this peak is virtually equivalent to background (Figure 6). Heteroplasmic signals were detected
for other sites as well. For instance, the primer pair for the
amplicon (3230–3893) co-amplified homologous numts
on 5 different chromosomes (2, 4, 16, 17 and X). This
region is evident in the pseudo-mitochondrial genome
assembly from our clones (Figure 4).
Multiple numt copies exist in the genome
To cross-validate our cloned data, we analyzed genomic
DNA from ρ0 cells, blood, and human placenta using
mitochondrial primers that co-amplified nuclear loci in
the prostate cancer specimens. In blood and human placenta samples, a single mtDNA amplicon was consistently
observed (Figure 7, and data not shown). Although
sequence analysis of the prostate specimens detected
numts, their signals were below the detection limit of agarose gel electrophoresis. In contrast, several primers con-

In this study, we recovered and assembled the entire mitochondrial genome from nuclear loci. Moreover, this
"pseudo-mitochondrial genome" involves numts from
over half of the human complement of chromosomes,
including the X chromosome. This suggests a widespread
allocation of numts in the human nuclear genome. Surprisingly, this distribution was achieved with primers routinely used to amplify mtDNA, yet designed without
consideration for numts. Seventy-one percent (24/34) of
the primers co-amplified numts in prostate cancer tissue
samples. This validates prior suggestions that numts are a
potential source of misinformation and serves to illustrate
the ease of co-amplification of both mtDNA and nuclear
embedded paralogous mitochondrial DNA sequences
[16]. Our data demonstrate that contrary to a consensus
of opinions that the copy number of the mitochondrial
genome "swamps" the signal from numts loci, there are
circumstances which favor PCR recovery of numts, such as
multiple pseudogene copy number [18]. For instance, heteroplasmic mutations had been associated with late-onset
Alzheimer's disease [17,53]; however, these false heteroplasmies resulted from co-amplification of numts
[19,54,55]. Indeed, human numts perplexed ancient DNA
studies as well when it was reported that DNA had been
recovered and amplified from a Cretaceous dinosaur bone
[56]. This sequence corresponded to a human numt containing cytochrome b sequence [57], probably from reagent or sample contamination.
Direct pseudogene contribution is not always obvious
and can confound suggested mtDNA biomarkers. For
example, one set of primers in our data set amplifies
tRNAleu and ND1 (3230–3893). Subsequent cloning data

identified co-amplification of paralogous numts on five
chromosomes with this amplicon. Of specific interest are
bases 3316, 3496, 3697 and 3796, which are reported as
potential disease associated sites [52]. These sites are
problematic since the reported base changes are consistent with pseudogene presentation in our data. Further,
results from new sequencing technologies have suggested
that homoplasmic signals may indeed be heteroplasmic
in nature [11]. In addition, the heteroplasmic patterns
seen at bps 3697 and 3796 are mirrored by the nuclear
pseudogene patterns (Table 3).
Re-examination of the raw data from the above studies
could address if the disease mutations are actually due to
co-amplified numts. Potential markers must be thoroughly investigated to preclude the inclusion of false
mutations in the interpretation of mtDNA mutations.
BLAST searches of nuclear pseudogenes belie the possibility of widespread integration and/or replication of these
sequences, since primers may amplify homologous numts
embedded elsewhere in the genome. Thus, high copy
numbers for these nuclear segments can produce potential misleading heteroplasmic signals.
Comparative marker studies require the same conditions
and primers for meaningful results. For example, proposed MELAS sites T3250C and T3291C (tRNAleu) have
paralogous nuclear sites [58-60]. Follow-up work by Akanuma et al. (2000) [61], demonstrate a corollary numt
associated site for T3250C, but not T3291C. A BLAST
search shows that these competing sequences are on sep-

arate chromosomes (17 and 20) indicating comparison of
dissimilar data. In addition, the cloning data here identifies similar regions on chromosomes 2, 4 and 17 (Table
3). Clearly there are numerous paralogous loci for mitochondrial tRNAleu, the amplification of which depends on
location and homology of primer sets.
Because of this association in our data, we compared our
cloning results to the suggested mitochondrial genome
disease associated sites listed on MITOMAP [52]. Results
suggest that many mutations require meticulous scrutiny
because of paralogous nuclear commonalities. Although
many of these mutations may well be actual disease markers, the possibility of numt association may confound
detection. For example, proposed prostate cancer mutations (G5913A, G5973A and G6081A) are identified, by
cloning data, as resident on chromosomes 1 (2 homologous copies) and 17 even though the authors exercised
precautionary measures by scanning a database of known
nuclear pseudogenes [49,62]. A locus on chromosome 6
was identified as a potential co-amplification product, yet
chromosomes 1 and 17 were not detected. Co-amplification of numts is primer dependent, which may explain the
differences seen here; however, database limitations and
the absence of extensive wet-lab numt data obscure the
meaning of the marker. Particularly suspicious are those
sites which demonstrate heteroplasmy in both normal
and disease tissue. This may reflect a consistent pattern of
numt amplification, an unintended characteristic of
primer design. A subset of the marker work prior to the
seminal numt work of Lopez et al. (1994) [14] may need

and medical merit, much of the data requires critical follow-up from a pseudogene perspective. Amplification of
ρ0 DNA template with primers to identify and eliminate
those which co-amplify nuclear pseudogenes is a vital and
necessary procedure [16]. For example, mitochondrial
PCR protocols were simultaneously run on clinical samples and nucleic acid recovered from ρ0 cells to identify
and exclude co-amplification of numts in work by Coskun
et al. [64]. Alternatively, data may be screened by amplifi-

cation and sequencing of ρ0 derived DNA and conflicting
sites then backed out of actual data generated with identical primers; however, this approach is labor-intensive
[43]. Phylogenetic analysis of the data would also help
distinguish polymorphisms from authentic mutations
[22]. In general, and unfortunately the advice by Parfait et
al. has been largely ignored [16].
Our surprising results are not limited to short amplicons,
but are also detected in much larger amplicons. For example, the overlapping amplification of chromosome 5 from
bp 8816 to 15051 cautions against assuming that long
amplicons are pseudogene free. These possibilities and
characteristics of the nuclear genome must be considered
when using mitochondrial sequence data for population,
forensic or disease studies. Although designing and testing
primers to avoid co-amplification of numts is a good laboratory practice, compilation of numts representative of
the entire mitochondrial genome is valuable to catalog
and characterize the overall nuclear burden of these
sequences.

Conclusion
Amplification of overlapping numts paralogous to the
mitochondrial genome indicates that co-amplification of
nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes is a real problem for
accurate sequence interpretation. Not only is co-amplifi-

cation dependent on the particular amplicon used, but
the copy number of these loci is also important. Only certain positions across the mitochondrial genome are associated with multiple copies of numts. Mitochondrial DNA
heteroplasmy should be interpreted with caution since
they can be the result of nuclear/cytoplasmic co-amplification. Herein, we have demonstrated the robust amplification of numts. This paper is the first to fully sequence
the 46 paralogous DNA fragments that represent the
entire mitochondrial genome using 36 primer pairs. This
is a surprisingly low number, but reveals that only a limited number of paralogous numts are relevant when considering if heteroplasmic call are authentic mutations.
Compilation of a complete data set of numt sequences
will help others distinguish paralogous nuclear based heteroplasmy in forensic, population and medical applications.

Methods
Nucleic acid extraction
All research involving human tissue was approved by the
Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre Ethics
Committee in accordance with the Tri-Council Policy
Statement for Research Involving Humans http://
www.nserc.ca/programs/ethics.htm. Archived formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy samples were laser capture microdissected (LCM) and DNA
isolated by proteinase K digestion. DNA was isolated from

blood using the UltraClean™ DNA BloodSpin kit (MO
BIO laboratories, Inc). Human placenta DNA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (D4642). ρ0cells were prepared from a human osteocarcoma cell line 143B (ATCC
CRL-8303) treated with ethidium bromide to deplete
cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA(kindly provided by Eric
Shoubridge) [65]. Cells were grown to confluence in high
glucose DMEM with pyruvate, L-glutamine, uridine (50
µg/ml) and 5% FBS. At confluence cultures were harvested
and DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA Mini Kit.
Amplification, cloning and sequencing
Template from FFPE tissue samples and ρ0 cells were
amplified using 34 mitochondrial and 2 chromosome 17
primers. Using TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara
Bio Inc.), PCR reactions were performed using the following conditions: 1X LA PCR Buffer II (Mg2+plus), 0.4 mM
each dNTP mixture, 1X BSA (New England Biolabs Inc.),
0.6 µM each primer, 1.25 Units LA Taq, 0.5% Ficoll 400
and 1 mM tartrazine (20,195-2, Aldrich). Total reaction
volume was 25 µl. Cycling parameters were 94°C for 2
minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds, 30
seconds annealing at primer-specific optimized temperatures, and 72°C for 90 seconds. Cycling was performed on
a DNA Engine Tetrad 2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). PCR
products were purified, cloned and sequenced at Lark™
Technologies using in-house standard operating procedures (Houston, Texas). In general, 40 clones from each
ρ0 amplicon were selected and sequenced in both forward
and reverse directions.
Analysis
Sequences were analyzed using the Phred-Phrap-Consed
software package [66]. The sequences were then grouped
based on similarity and a megaBLAST search of NCBI
database was performed (using default parameters) to
identify all the nuclear co-ordinates of the fragments. This
enabled the chromosomal location and nuclear copy
number of each amplicon to be determined. Pairwise
sequence alignment was performed between the revised
Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)[67] and the ρ0
clones from the suite of amplicons covering the entire
mitochondrial genome using the Sequencher™ software(Gene Codes Corporation).
Southern Blotting
Mitochondrial genomes were cut with PvuII from 2 ug of
total DNA extracted from normal blood and ρ0 cells.
Digested product was electrophoresed through a 0.4%
agarose gel and blotted onto a membrane (Hybond-N+,
Roche Applied Sciences). Probes were generated from full
length mtDNA (16.5 kb) by random primer labeling
using the DIG System (Roche Diagnostics). Blots were
incubated with probe, washed, blocked, incubated with
anti-digoxigenin-AP fragments (Roche Applied Science)

and reacted with a chemiluminescent substrate (CDPStar®) and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak) as recommended by the DIG Application Manual for Filter Hybridization (Roche Diagnostics, 2000).

To examine for multiple copy numts, 50 ng of genomic
DNA from ρ0 cells, blood and human placenta were
amplified as described above, using primer sets to
OXPHOS genes,.

PCR
For reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, total RNA was
extracted from ρ0 cells and a snap frozen skin sample
using standard protocols outlined in the RNeasy Micro Kit
manual (Qiagen). A DNase1 treatment step was included
in the RNA extraction process to ensure the complete
removal of all genomic DNA. We assessed RNA quantity
and quality with the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® technologies) and by gel electrophoresis. First
strand DNA was synthesized with the Omniscript® RT
(Qiagen) kit. 2 ul of the cDNA was amplified with primer
sets to coding mitochondrial genes and a nuclear gene, 5aminolaevulinate synthase (hALAS) (Table 3), using the
PCR conditions described above except the annealing
temperature for these primers was 54°C.

Authors' contributions
RLP conceived of and supervised the study, and drafted
the manuscript, JM, BR AA, and KR conducted experiments and participated in sequence alignment and data
analysis, RW co-coordinated sample collection, GDD conducted experiments and helped draft the manuscript, JPJ
provided intellectual insight and helped draft the manuscript, RET designed experiment and helped draft manuscript. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.
