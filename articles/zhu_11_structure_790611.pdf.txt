evolution of duplicated fiber developmental
genes in Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum

Abstract
Background: Both Gossypium hirsutum and G. barbadense probably originated from a common ancestor, but they
have very different agronomic and fiber quality characters. Here we selected 17 fiber development-related genes
to study their structures, tree topologies, chromosomal location and expression patterns to better understand the
interspecific divergence of fiber development genes in the two cultivated tetraploid species.
Results: The sequence and structure of 70.59% genes were conserved with the same exon length and numbers in
different species, while 29.41% genes showed diversity. There were 15 genes showing independent evolution
between the A- and D-subgenomes after polyploid formation, while two evolved via different degrees of
colonization. Chromosomal location showed that 22 duplicate genes were located in which at least one fiber
quality QTL was detected. The molecular evolutionary rates suggested that the D-subgenome of the allotetraploid
underwent rapid evolutionary differentiation, and selection had acted at the tetraploid level. Expression profiles at
fiber initiation and early elongation showed that the transcripts levels of most genes were higher in Hai7124 than
in TM-1. During the primary-secondary transition period, expression of most genes peaked earlier in TM-1 than in
Hai7124. Homeolog expression profile showed that A-subgenome, or the combination of A- and D-subgenomes,
played critical roles in fiber quality divergence of G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. However, the expression of
D-subgenome alone also played an important role.
Conclusion: Integrating analysis of the structure and expression to fiber development genes, suggests selective
breeding for certain desirable fiber qualities played an important role in divergence of G. hirsutum and
G. barbadense.

Background
Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the world’s most important
fiber crop plant. While most of the > 50 Gossypium species are diploid (n = 13), five are allopolyploids (n = 26),
originating from an interspecific hybridization event
between A- and D-genome diploid species. Humans
have independently domesticated four different species
for their fiber, two of which are diploids, Gossypium herbaceum and G. arboreum, and two are allopolyploids,
G. hirsutum and G. barbadense [1].
Alhough G. hirsutum and G. barbadense probably
originated from a single hybridization event between

A- and D- diploid species, the two have very different
agronomic and fiber quality characteristics. The high
yield potential and diverse environmental and production system adaptability of G. hirsutum make it the
most widely cultivated species, accounting for about
97% of the world’s cotton fiber [2]. G. barbadense is a
more modern species possessing superior fiber quality.
Novel alleles are responsible for the improved fiber
quality in G. barbadense. Despite its higher fiber quality,
however, the narrow adaptation range and low yield of
G. barbadense limit its cultivation. The two Gossypium
species are sexually compatible, although partial sterility,
longer maturity, and hybrid breakdown are often
observed in later generations [3]. Nonetheless, the introgression of favorable alleles from G. barbadense to
G. hirsutum would likely improve the fiber quality of

G. hirsutum while simultaneously maintaining its high
fiber yield [4].
The cotton fiber is a single cell without the complex
cell division and multicellular development that develops
from ovule’s epidermal cells. Fiber development occurs
in four distinct, but overlapping stages: initiation, elongation, secondary wall synthesis, and maturation [5]. To
date, many of the genes predominantly expressed in cotton fiber development have been isolated and characterized. Gh14-3-3L was found to be predominantly
expressed during early fiber development, and may be
involved in regulating fiber elongation [6]. Yoder et al.
[7] defined pectate lyase (PEL) as a cell wall modification enzyme. GhPel was found to play an essential role
in fiber cell elongation by degradation of the deesterified pectin for cell wall loosening [8]. Ruan et al.
[9] suggested the sucrose synthase gene (Sus) played an
important role in the initiation and elongation of singlecelled fibers by inﬂuencing carbon partitioning to cellulose synthesis. GhBG (b-1,4-glucosidase), one of three
cellulases, was specifically expressed in fiber cells and
plays an important role in degradation of the primary
cell wall and promotion of secondary cell wall synthesis
[10]. Cotton CelA1 and CelA2 genes, encoding the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase, are expressed at high
levels during active secondary wall cellulose synthesis in
developing cotton fibers [11]. Two cotton Rac genes,
GhRacA and GhRacB, expressed in the fibers at the
initiation and elongation stages, might play an important
role in early fiber development [12]. In addition, several
genes are expressed specifically or preferentially in fibers
[13-18], although their exact functional roles remain
unclear.
In theory, there are two homologs in tetraploid cotton
species, representing descendants from the A-genome
and D-genome donors at the time of polyploidy formation. The goals of this study were to: 1) better understand the genetic basis of cotton fiber development,
2) identify the structural difference of duplicated genes,
and 3) reveal the expression and evolution of fiber quality differences between upland and sea-island cotton. To
complete this study, we selected 17 fiber development
genes accessioned in National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to
study structure and expression differences of the two
cultivated tetraploid species. To investigate their frame
and sequence divergence, we initially cloned these genes
in the genome DNA of the G. hirsutum accession TM1, the G. barbadense cultivar Hai7124, and their two
putative diploid progenitors. The chromosomal locations
of each homeolog of several studied genes, having effective single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or amplification polymorphism loci between TM-1 and Hai7124
were determined by linkage analysis in allotetraploid

cotton using an interspecific BC1 mapping population
(TM-1×Hai7124)×TM-1] [19-22]. Finally, expression
patterns of each gene and each homeolog were explored.
A more thorough understanding of interspecific divergence of cotton will provide a solid foundation from
which key fiber quality genes may be exploited in cotton
molecular breeding.

Results
Sequence and structure analysis of fiber development
genes

The orthologs of each of the 17 genes were cloned and
sequenced (GenBank accession numbers (GQ340731GQ340736, HQ142989-HQ143048, and HQ143055HQ143090; Table 1). Phylogenetic groupings and
sequence comparisons allowed the copy number for all
genes, except Exp1 in the Hai7124 cultivar, to be independently isolated with a single copy from the diploid
species and two homeologs from each tetraploid species
for each gene. There was a single copy of Exp1 in the
diploid species and two distinct copies in TM-1, however, the Exp1 sequence from Hai7124 was of only one
type, though more than 10 clones were selected randomly to sequence. This result was further validated by
a different primer pair of this gene (see Additional file
1: Supplemental Table S1 for list of primer pairs). The
sequence from Hai7124 has a closer relationship with
G. raimondii than with G. herbaceum. Further, southern
blotting of Exp1 performed on the four species, showed
two distinct hybridizing bands after digestion with EcoRI
and HindI in Hai7124 and TM-1, and one hybridizing
band in G. herbaceum and G. raimondii (Figure not
shown), which indicated that Exp1 had two copies in
both TM-1 and Hai7124. Combining sequence and
southern blot analysis, the homeolog of Exp1 in the
A-subgenome of Hai7124 was colonized to a type
resembling that of the D-subgenome via nonreciprocal
homoeologous exchange [23].
The lengths of the genomic DNA sequences isolated
from the four species varied from 1020 bp (Exp1) to
6126 bp (CelA3) (Table 2). Based on the alignments
between the genomic DNA and the cDNA sequences in
orthologs, twelve genes (70.59%) shared the same
intron/exon structures in different genomes, and variations in length were mainly caused by insertion/deletion
events within introns (Additional file 2: Supplemental
Figure S1A). The remaining five genes (29.41%), CIPK1,
CAP, BG, ManA2 and CelA3, produced some structure
differences caused by different exon length or numbers
(Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S1B).
Seventeen gene trees were constructed using the NJ
method to distinguish the duplicated genes independent
of evolution or local interlocus recombination after tetraploid formation. Two major clades, one including

High bootstrap values supported duplicated genes independent of evolution after tetraploid formation. Two

genes were determined to have local interlocus recombination or colonization after tetraploid formation (Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S2B). ACT1 from
G. raimondii was more closely related to ACT1s from
G. herbaceum and the A-subgenomes than with ACT1s

ACT1s from the D-subgenomes evolved at an accelerated rate, relative to ACT1s from the A-subgenomes.
The Exp1 sequence in Hai7124 was closer to that found
in G. raimondii.
To locate all 17 homeolog gene pairs on our backbone
genetic map [23], the subgenome-specific PCR primers
(Additional file 4: Supplemental Table S2) and singlenucleotide amplified polymorphisms (SNAP) primers
(Additional file 5: Supplemental Table S3) were used to
detect polymorphisms between TM-1 and Hai7124.
Polymorphic primer pairs were also used to survey 138
individuals of the ([(TM-1×Hai7124)×TM-1]) BC1 mapping population (Table 3). Eight gene pairs were located
on their corresponding homeologous chromosomes, and
each of six pairs were located on one of their homeologous chromosomes, while three pair of genes, Exp, Exp1
and CelA1 could not be mapped because no available
polymorphic loci were found between TM-1 and
Hai7124. A large body of data was compiled by integrating previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative

trait locus (QTL) [24-34] with the 22 identified fiber
quality-related genes within 20 cM. Most genes had at
least one fiber quality QTL; some had several (Table 3),
indicating important fiber quality roles.
Rates of sequence evolution

With only a few exceptions, purifying selection, as indicated by Ka/Ks < 1, appears to be in place for most of
pairwise comparisons (Table 4). The exceptions include G.
herbaceum (A1 genome, A1) vs G. hirsutum A-subgenome
(Ath) of POD2 and D5 vs Dth of RacA, which demonstrated positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1), as well as D5 vs Dtb
of RacA, A1 vs Atb of 14-3-3L, A1 vs Ath and A1 vs Atb of
CAP, which had exceptionally strong positive selection
(Ka/Ks >> 1).
Because there were no nucleotide substitutions in A1
vs Atb of RacA, A1 vs Atb of EXP, D5 vs Dth and D5 vs
Dtb of LTP3, and all RacBs pairs, it was not possible to
compare their evolutionary rates. Although those particular “not applicable” comparisons (NA vs NA) were

excluded from our analysis, the “NAs” were considered
zero when they were compared with others whose Ks
were not NA. In all pairwise comparisons of nucleotide
diversity for each gene between subgenomes within a
species [32 pairs, 16 in TM-1 and 16 in Hai7124 (RacB
was excluded)], 62.5% (10 in TM-1 and 10 in Hai7124)
had a higher evolutionary rate in the D-subgenome than
in the A-subgenome. Furthermore, in the 16 gene pairs
(excluding RacB) from the A-subgenomes of TM-1 and
Hai7124, 62.5% (10 out of 16) had a higher evolutionary
rate in TM-1 than in Hai7124, 31.25% (5 of 15) and were
reversed and 6.25% (1 of 16, ACT1) showed an equivalent
evolutionary rate between TM-1 and Hai7124. Similarly,
in the 15 gene pairs (RacB and LTP3 were excluded)
from the D-subgenomes of TM-1 and Hai7124, 60% (9 of
15) had a higher evolutionary rate in TM-1 than in
Hai7124, 26.67% (4 of 15) and were reversed and 13.33%

(2 of 15, Pel and Exp) showed an equivalent evolutionary
rate between TM-1 and Hai7124.
Phylogenetic relationships are reflected in the nucleotide substitution results (Additional file 3: Supplemental
Figure S2). Based on branch length, all of homeologs
from the two tetraploid species had unequal rates of
sequence evolution following allopolyploid formation.
The rates at which the deviations occurred in allopolyploids are sufficient to generate branch length inequality
between the A- and D-subgenomes [35].
Ka/Ks ratio comparisons showed that selection had
altered the molecular evolutionary rate of some genes
due to allopolyploid formation. Four genes, Pel, RacA,
Exp and Sus1, in TM-1, and five genes, Pel, CIPK1, 143-3L, CAP and CelA3, in Hai7124, yielded higher Ka/Ks
ratios in A-At, D-Dt and At-Dt comparisons than in the
A-D comparison, indicating that selection for some

Zhu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:40

genes related with fiber development had acted at the
tetraploid level.
Differential expression fiber development genes

After the specificity of homeolog-specific primer pairs were
confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from
G. herbaceum (A-genome), G. raimondii (D-genome),
TM-1 and Hai7124 (Figure 1), their homeolog transcripts
in young tetraploid cotton fiber were further detected by
qPCR analysis. The relative expression values at 10 different fiber development stages were obtained by combining
the homeolog transcripts of each gene at the same stage.
Expression for the 17 genes could be broken down into
five categories (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3):
1) fiber initiation and early elongation (0-8 DPA), such as
Exp, POD2 and ManA2 (Additional file 6: Supplemental
Figure S3A); 2) fiber elongation (3-17 DPA), such as Exp1,
Pel, and LTP3 (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3B);
3) primary-secondary transition period (17-23 DPA), such
as BG, CEL and CelA1 (Additional file 6: Supplemental
Figure S3C); 4) both at fiber initiation and early elongation

Page 6 of 15

period (0-8DPA) and secondary cell wall thickening period
(20-23DPA), such as Sus1, 14-3-3L and RacB (Additional
file 6: Supplemental Figure S3D); 5) the whole fiber developmental period, such as CelA3, CAP, ACT1, RacA and
CIPK1 (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3E). In the
last category, however, transcript preference was shown at
some stages. For example, CelA3 and CAP were expressed
preferentially at the fiber elongation and secondary cell
wall thickening stages (8-23 DPA), but had moderate
expression at 0-5 DPA.
Gene expression differences in TM-1 and Hai7124
were further clarified by statistical analysis of least signification difference (LSD). Greater expression in
Hai7124 than in TM-1 was observed for 14-3-3L except
at 20 DPA, and for CelA3 except at 5, 17 and 23 DPA.
Other gene transcripts showed different expression
advantages in the two cotton species at various fiber
developmental stages.
At fiber initiation and early elongation (0-8 DPA),
most genes, including Exp, ManA2, Sus1, RacB, CelA3,
CAP and RacA, had significantly higher expression levels

in Hai7124 than in TM-1. During fiber elongation (5-14
DPA), the expression profiles of genes preferentially
expressed during that period were either biased to TM1 or Hai7124 or were equally expressed between the
two. Five genes, Exp1, Pel, CAP, CIPK1 and RacA, were
expressed preferentially in TM-1 or equally between
TM-1 and Hai7124, except at 8 DPA, that these same
genes showed significantly greater expression levels in
Hai7124; LTP3 and ACT1 showed significantly higher
expression levels in TM-1 than in Hai7124; expression
of CelA3 was higher in Hai7124.
During primary-secondary cell wall transition (17-23
DPA), peak expression occurred earlier in TM-1 than in
Hai7124 for most genes (CAP, CelA3, CIPK1, CEL, BG,
RacB, Sus1 and 14-3-3L). ACT1 and RacA expressed
equally in TM-1 and Hai7124 at 17 and 20 DPA, but
significantly greater in Hai7124 at 23 DPA. The
extended fiber development period, as indicated by
higher expression at a later DPA, may help explain why
G. barbadense has an extra long staple cotton. One
gene, CelA1, showed no significant expression difference
between TM-1 and Hai7124.
Genome-specific expression of the homeologs

Based on the homeolog expression profile, 17 diagnostic
genes in TM-1 and 17 in Hai7124 were further evaluated. Of the 34 genes, 32.35% (11) were equally
expressed between the A- and D-subgenomes, 41.18%
(14) were A-subgenome biased, 20.59% (7) were D-subgenome biased and 5.88% (2) were A- or D-biased at
different stages.

Page 7 of 15

The 17 fiber development genes were clustered into
three comparison patterns between TM-1 and Hai7124.
First, homeologs for CelA3, Exp, Exp1 and CIPK1 in both
TM-1 and Hai7124 were equally expressed between the
A- and D-subgenomes in the preferentially-expressed
stages (Figure 2). Of these, Exp1 had equal transcript levels
from the two homeologs in TM-1 and Hai7124, with two
distinguishable copies in TM-1 and two undistinguishable
copies in Hai7124. These data were consistent with the
fact that the duplicated loci for Exp1 in Hai7124 had the
same sequence as the D-subgenome (Figure 2).
Second, the transcripts of 11 genes, CEL, Pel, Sus1, 14-33L, RacA, CelA1, ManA2, RacB, CAP, LTP3 and POD2,
were A- or D-subgenome biased (Figure 3). Among these,
CEL, Pel, Sus1, 14-3-3L and RacA were A-subgenome
biased and CelA1, ManA2 and RacB were D-subgenome
biased in both TM-1 and Hai7124 at all stages. The transcripts of the homeologs of CAP, LTP3 and POD2 were
significantly altered in the preferentially expressed stages
in TM-1 and Hai7124. In TM-1, the transcripts of CAP
and LTP3 were significantly A-subgenome biased. However, the transcripts of the two genes in Hai7124 were
equivalently expressed at most stages, only D-subgenome
bias in LTP3 in the primary-secondary cell wall transition
period detected. Expression of POD2 was A-subgenome
biased at 0, 3 and 10 DPA and D-subgenome biased at 1
DPA in TM-1. In Hai7124, POD2 expression was A-subgenome biased at 0, 3 and 10 DPA and D-subgenome
biased at 1, 5 and 8 DPA.
Third, BG was significantly (P < 0.001) affected only
from the A-subgenome, and ACT1 was significantly (P <

0.001) affected from the D-subgenome at all stages in
both TM-1 and Hai7124 (Figure 4). Based on the comparison patterns and the structural analysis of the two
genes, we proposed that the homeolog of BG from the
D-subgenome might be silenced and that of ACT1 from
the A-subgenome may have novel roles in other species
(neofunctionalization).

Differences between TM-1 and Hai7124 in transcriptome contributions of the subgenome at key fiber developmental stages were detected. During initiation and
early elongation of the fiber, 10 gene transcriptions
showed greater expression levels in Hai7124 than in
TM-1. Of those, the D-subgenome contributed higher
amounts of ACT1, RacB and Man2, while the A-

subgenome contributed higher amounts of Sus1, CIPK1
and 14-3-3L. CelA3, Exp, CAP and RacA were equally
supplied by both subgenomes.
At 8 DPA, corresponding to the close of fiber plasmodesmate [36], the transcriptions of 12 genes (Exp1, Pel, POD2,
CelA3, BG, Sus1, CAP, Exp, RacA, RacB, 14-3-3L and
CIPK1) were sharply accumulated in Hai7124. Of those,
the transcripts of RacB and POD2 were contributed mainly
from D-subgenome, that of BG, Pel, Sus1 and RacA from
A-subgenome and others by both A- and D-subgenomes.
At the primary-secondary transition period, the
expression of 10 genes, CelA3, CAP, ACT1, RacA,
CIPK1, 14-3-3L, Sus1, RacB, CEL and BG, occurred earlier in TM-1 than in Hai7124. The transcripts of ACT1
and RacB were mainly from D-subgenomes; those of
BG, CEL and Sus1 were mainly from A-subgenomes,
and other genes were from both A- and D-subgenomes.
Based on these data we inferred that the expression
accumulation of the A-subgenome, or the combination
of A- and D-subgenomes, played critical roles in fiber
quality divergence of G. hirsutum and G. barbadense.
However, the expression of D-subgenome alone also
played an important role.

Discussion
Evolutionary fate of duplicated genes

For each gene that was studied, allopolyploid species
should have two homelogs, representing descendants
from the A-genome and D-genome donors at the time
of polyploidy formation. Cronn et al. [35] indicated that
most duplicated genes in allopolyploid cotton evolved
independently of each other. Our phylogenetic analyses
support this hypothesis, and the independent evolution
of several genes was distinctively evident in their structure, in our study. For example, CAPs and RacBs had
the same structure between each diploid and its counterpart in allopolyploid cotton (A- and At-subgenome,
D- and Dt-subgenome), but the different structures
were apparent in the A-D comparison (Additional file 2:
Supplemental Figure S1B). Though expression of ManA2

from the At-subgenome of Hai7124 ceased rather early
in the growth process, the structure difference between
the A-, At-subgenomes and D-, Dt-subgenomes was also
distinct. The fact that the structure of the At- and
Dt-subgenomes mirrored their putative ancestral diploid
species suggested the difference may have occurred before
allopolyploid formation and evolved independently in allopolyploid cotton. CelA3s from At-subgenome of TM-1
and Hai7124 displayed the same mutation, which altered
their coding regions, indicating not only independent evolution, but also parallel evolution between TM-1 and
Hai7124. This change, however, was not detected in their
putative ancestral diploid species, suggesting accelerated
evolution of CelA3 in the At-subgenome after allopolyploid formation. Though most genes independently
evolved in allopolyploid cotton, there were some exceptions. For example, Exp1 from At-subgenome were
colonized in Hai7124 by Dt-subgenomes.
Relative to expression, duplicate genes can follow one of
three evolutionary paths. First, one copy may evolve into a
nonfunctional pseudogene [37-41]. Second, the multiple
copies can contribute to an increase in the gene expression
level [42,43] or both copies can suffer mutations but the
combined action of both gene copies is necessary to maintain original function and expression levels (subfunctionalization) [40,44,45]. Third, one copy may gain a novel
beneficial function (neofunctionalization) that is selectively
maintained within the genome [40,46-48]. We measured
homeolog-specific contributions to the transcriptome in
allopolyploid cotton fiber by Q-PCR analysis. Because the
majority (64.70%) of diagnostic genes exhibited subgenome-specific bias to the A or D-subgenome, subgenomebiased expression in cotton fiber developmental stages was
considered commonplace. This result was consistent with
previous studies [49-55]. Most of genes in our study exhibited the same expression bias in the two cultivated cotton
species, TM-1 and Hai7124. However, some inconsistencies were detected in three genes (CAP, LTP3 and POD2),
suggesting that these genes may have had different roles in
the interspecific divergence between G. hirsutum and G.

Zhu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/40

barbadense. Artificial selection by humans of certain desirable fiber traits may have also influenced G. hirsutum and
G. barbadense genetic structure [55].
Synthesizing structures and expression profiles of the
duplicates, their possible fates are inferred. BG accumulated solely in A-subgenome transcripts (D-subgenome
silenced), in both TM-1 and Hai7124 (Figure 4). BGs
obtained from the D-subgenomes of TM-1 and Hai7124
had a nucleotide deletion and a nonsense mutation, respectively, which altered the ORFs (Table 2). The structure difference suggests that BG in the D-subgenomes of TM-1
and Hai7124 may be pseudogenes. On the other hand,
while CAP and CelA3 had different A- and D-subgenome
structures in both TM-1 and Hai7124 (Additional file 2:
Supplemental Figure S1B), their A- and D-subgenome
expression profiles were active (Figure 2, 3). Therefore, the
duplicated genes of CAP and CelA3 may be subfunctionalized. Similarly, the functions of duplicated genes from
CEL, Sus1, 14-3-3L, RacA, RacB, Exp, Exp1, CIPK1, CelA1,
Pel, ManA2, LTP3 and POD2 were also subfunctionalized
(Figure 3). Because ACT1 transcripts of A subgenomes
could not be detected at all stages of fiber development
(Figure 4), they may have evolved new functions.
Domestication of allopolyploid cotton

Numerous plant species have been selectively bred over
the course of human social evolution [56]. Allopolyploid
cotton species are believed to have formed about
1-2 million years ago, by hybridization between a maternal Old World diploid A-genome G. herbaceum [57]
and paternal New World diploid D-genome G. raimondii [57-59]. The allotetraploid lineage gave rise to five
extant tetraploid species, including G. barbadense and
G. hirsutum, known for their superior fiber quality and
high yield, respectively. In the present study, the Ka/Ks
ratios among four cotton species indicated that selection
of fiber development genes occurred at the tetraploid
level. By comparing the nucleotide diversity between
TM-1 and Hai7124 within the same subgenome, most
genes (62.5% in A-subgenome and 60% in D-subgenome) had a higher evolutionary rate in TM-1 than in
Hai7124, which may be associated with longer and
more frequent cultivation of TM-1. Given these data,
we propose that diversity evolution between A- and
D-subgenomes within a species or between TM-1 and
Hai7124 within the same subgenome was due to both
natural and artificial selection pressure [55].
Gene expression differences between TM-1 and Hai7124

G. hirsutum and G. barbadense are two domesticated
cotton species possessing very different agronomic and
fiber quality characteristics with G. barbadense having
superior fiber quality. Rapp et al. (2010) studied the transcriptomes of cotton fibers from wild and domesticated

Page 10 of 15

accessions (G. hirsutum) and found that human selection
during the initial domestication and subsequent crop
improvement had resulted in a biased upregulation of
components of the transcriptional network during fiber
development [60]. In this study, of the 17 fiber development-related genes, 14 had the similar expression pattern
and three that did not, in TM-1 and Hai7124 (Figure 2,
3, 4). Of three genes, the transcripts of homeologs were
significantly A- or D-subgenome biased in TM-1. However, in Hai7124, homeolog transcripts were equally
expressed between the two subgenomes or D-subgenome
biased. Though 14 genes had the same expression patterns between TM-1 and Hai7124, the relative expression
levels were different at most stages. While the same Aor D-biased or equal expression profile in the two cultivated cotton species might be related to functional partitioning of genomic contributions during cellular
development after allopolyploid formation, significant
alternation of homoelog A/D ratio and expression difference at the same fiber developmental time points
between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense indicated that
domestication for different fiber qualities may play an
important role in fiber quality divergence of G. hirsutum
and G. barbadense.
In previous study, fiber growth curves have shown longer
fiber elongation phases in domesticated G. hirsutum than
that in wild G. hirsutum, and further comparative gene
expression profiling of isolated cotton fibers over a developmental time course of fiber differentiation indicated that
domesticated TM-1 displayed a much higher level of transcriptional variation between the sampled time points than
the wild accession did [60]. In the study, the expression peak
of transcripts in most genes was earlier in TM-1 than in
Hai7124, especially at the primary-secondary transition
period, which indicated that most genes related to fiber
development expressed longer and more intensely in
Hai7124. Resulting differences in mRNA levels may lead to
changes in enzyme activity, further contributing to phenotypic differences between the two cotton species. Several
genes that are differentially expressed in TM-1 and Hai7124
should be further mined.
The 14-3-3 protein is an important regulatory protein.
Shi et al. [6] proposed that the Gh14-3-3L transcripts
are highly accumulated during early cotton fiber development, suggesting that Gh14-3-3L may be involved in
regulating fiber elongation. Our data showed that,
although 14-3-3L is expressed preferentially in the early
development stages of cotton fibers in both TM-1 and
Hai7124, the relative expression values were significantly
different. The expression of 14-3-3L was significantly
higher in most stages in Hai7124 (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3E), than in TM-1. Furthermore in
the primary-secondary transition period of fiber development, a secondary expression peak of 14-3-3L was

Zhu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/40

also detected, indicating 14-3-3L may also be involved in
thickening of the secondary cell wall, a function that has
been reported in other species [61]. At 23 DPA, the
expression of 14-3-3L decreased in TM-1, but was still
increasing in Hai7124, suggesting a longer transcriptional period.
CelA1 was solely expressed during secondary wall cellulose synthesis, with no significant expression difference
between TM-1 and Hai7124 (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3C). The importance of CelA genes in
secondary wall cellulose synthesis in developing cotton
fibers has been reported by other researchers [16].
Expression of CelA3 at 17 DPA was significantly higher
in TM-1 than in Hai7124. However, strength dropped
much faster in TM-1 (e.g., at 20 DPA, Additional file 6:
Supplemental Figure S3E) than in Hai7124 after that,
which more stable expression was detected over a longer
period of time in Hai7124.
Rac genes (coding for GTP-binding Rac proteins) are
involved in various physiological processes, including
cell polar growth [62-65], synthesis of the secondary
wall [66-68], resistance response [69,70] and signal
transduction [71-73]. In the present study, RacAs were
predominantly expressed at the fiber elongation and secondary wall synthesis stages (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3E), indicating that the role of RacA
may be similar to that of Rac13, which is involved in
the signal transduction pathway for cytoskeleton organization [66]. Similarly, RacB was predominantly
expressed at the secondary wall synthesis stage in TM-1,
and preferentially expressed at the initiation of fiber
development and secondary wall synthesis in Hai7124
(Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure S3D), suggesting
multiple roles for RacB. Because RacA and RacB expressions were consistently higher at most stages in Hai7124
relative to TM-1, the two genes may be contributing to
fiber quality diversity.
Sucrose synthase (Sus) affects initiation and elongation
of the single-celled fibers, and also has a major role in
cell wall cellulose synthesis [9,74-77]. Cotton fiber cell
initiation and elongation are very sensitive to changes in
Sus activity [9]. The expression peak of cotton sucrose
synthase genes transcripts was earlier in wild cotton than
in TM-1[60]. Our study showed that greater Sus1 expression in Hai7124 than in TM-1 at initiation (0 and 1 DPA)
and 8 DPA and at 3 and 5 DPA was reversed. At 20 DPA,
Sus1 expression was significantly higher in TM-1, possibly as a result of earlier termination of fiber elongation
and earlier initiation of cell wall synthesis in TM-1.
Recent studies of comparative gene expression profiling of isolated cotton fibers [60,78] have identified genes
controlling differences in fiber growth between wild and
domesticated cotton [e.g., genes encoding tubulin isoforms, endotransglycosylase/hydrolases, cytochrome

Page 11 of 15

P(450) monooxygenase, and antioxidant enzymes].
These studies will provide new clues in the future studies to better understand the interspecific divergence of
fiber development in the two cultivated tetraploid cotton
species, G. barbadense and G. hirsutum.
Putative role of D-subgenome in interspecific divergence

Most genes (62.5% in TM-1 and 62.5% in Hai7124) exhibited a higher evolutionary rate in the D-subgenome than
in the A-subgenome, indicating that the D-subgenome of
the allotetraploid evolved faster than the A-subgenome
[59,79-82]. Considering the weight of evidence provided
by genome-specific expression of homeologs, chromosome
location of genes and QTL distribution for fiber qualities
(Table 3), we also determined the subgenome transcriptome contribution in interspecific divergence between
TM-1 and Hai7124. In the integration interval of genes
and QTLs, the gene transcripts were significantly A-subgenome biased, and the QTLs associated with fiber qualities
were detected in corresponding A-subgenome chromosome bins. Similarly, the gene transcripts were significantly
D-subgenome biased and relative fiber QTLs were
detected in corresponding D-subgenome chromosome
bins. While the transcripts of CAP was significantly
A-subgenome biased in TM-1, but equally expressed in
Hai7124 in the fiber developmental period, implying an
important D-subgenome contribution for elite fiber quality
traits in Hai7124. Integration of CAP duplicated loci with
fiber length and strength QTLs in D13, indicates domestication and artificial selection of tetraploid plants for superior fiber quality resulted in more significant evolutionary
dynamics in the D-subgenome than in the A-subgenome.

Conclusion
The study provided us the systematic report on the
interspecific divergence for fiber development between
Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum by analyzing
structures, molecular evolution and transcripts levels of
fiber development-related genes. The results indicated
that selective breeding for certain desirable fiber qualities may have played an important role in divergence of
the two cultivated tetraploid cotton species.
Methods
Plant materials

Of the 17 genes selected for this study (Table 1) were
described in previous reports as being expressed in
developing cotton fibers; their sequence information was
deposited in GenBank. The orthologous loci of each of
the 17 genes were isolated from two allotetraploid cottons, G. hirsutum acc. TM-1, G. barbadense cv.
Hai7124, and living models of their two ancestral genome donors, G. herbaceum var. africanum (A-genome)
and G. raimondii Ulbrich (D-genome). For expression

analysis, developing cotton ovules and attached fibers
were harvested from three replicates of TM-1 and
Hai7124 on 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 17, 20 and 23 days postanthesis (DPA). The mapping population was comprised
of 138 BC1 individuals generated from the cross [(TM1×Hai7124) ×TM-1] [19].
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

Based on GenBank deposited sequences, gene-specific
PCR primer pairs were individually designed for PCRamplification of full-length sequences of the 17 genes.
For the smaller genes, we designed one primer pair; at
least two nested primer pairs were designed for the larger genes (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S1).
Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was completed using High-fidelity ExTaq DNA polymerase
(TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd., China). The
PCR products were cloned into pMD18-T Vector
(TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and sequenced from plasmid DNA templates. In order
to obtain the sequence from both the A-subgenome and
D-subgenome, at least 10 clones for each gene from each
of the tetraploid species, TM-1 and Hai7124, were picked
randomly and sequenced. Homeologs were identified by
comparison to sequences from their diploid progenitors.
To avoid possible complications originating from PCR
recombination in allopolyploid cotton [83], a minimum of
three clones was used to determine the gene sequence in
each duplicated copy. In cases where PCR recombination
occurred, 10 additional clones were sequenced to verify
the corresponding correct sequence [83]. When the copy
number of genes was difficult to identify by sequencing, it
was confirmed by southern blot analysis.
Lengths were determined using alignment analysis,
which was applied to each relevant sequence of applicable gene. For genes with one primer pair, the A- and
D-subgenome sequences were clustered using the
Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA3.1 http://www.
megasoftware.net/. For those genes having more than
one primer pair, sequence segments from the same genomes and subgenomes were contiged by CAP3 software.

Chromosomal location

In order to locate all 17 pairs of homeologs on our
genetic map, PCR primers were designed according to
the sequence size difference between the two allotetraploid cottons (Additional file 4: Supplemental Table S2).
For homeologs with no size polymorphism, singlenucleotide amplified polymorphism (SNAP) primers
were designed based on a SNP between the TM-1 and
Hai7124 sequences at a putative locus (Additional file 5:
Supplemental Table S3). SNAP is a modified allele-specific amplified method, it introduce an additional base
pair change in the primer to increase the specificity of
the primer [84]. All SNAP primers was designed following Drenkard et al. [84] and using SNAPER http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu.
All the primer pairs exhibiting polymorphisms
between TM-1 and Hai7124 were used to survey 138
individuals of the BC1 mapping population. The polymorphic loci were integrated in our backbone map [22]
using Joinmap 3.0 software [85].
Evolution and ratios of sequence forms

For each gene, synonymous substitution rates (Ks),
nonsynonymous substitution rates (Ka) and their ratios
(Ka/Ks) in various comparisons among the four species
(A1 VS D5, A1 VS At, D5 VS Dt, At VS Dt) were calculated for the coding region using KaKs_Calculator
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kakscalculator2/. Ks is
the rate of evolution and the Ka/Ks ratio indicates the
selective force acting on the protein [86]. A Ka/Ks
ratio of 1 represents neutral evolution, that is, the
number of nonsynonymous changes at each possible
nonsynonymous site is the same as the number of
synonymous changes per synonymous site. Ka/Ks < 1
indicates a purifying selection (selection generally eliminates deleterious mutations and maintains protein status quo); Ka/Ks > 1 indicates positive selection, where
selection may be modifying the protein. The higher the
ratio is, the stronger the evidence that selection is
occurring.
Development of homeolog-specific PCR primer pairs

Gene structure and phylogenetic analyses

Six DNA sequences for each gene, including homeologs
and orthologs, isolated from the four species (A-,
D-genome and the A and D subgenome from the allotetraploid), were aligned by ClustalX http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/msa/clustalw2/. Based on the sequences of genomic DNA and the cDNA, the structure of each gene
was illustrated by the Gene Structure Display Server
(GSDS, http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/chinese.php). Phylogenetic analyses of the orthologs for each gene were performed using the Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA3.1
http://www.megasoftware.net/.

Homeolog-specific primers were designed and applied
based on sequence differences between duplicated loci
(Additional file 7: Supplemental Table S4). Specificity of
those primers was detected by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from G. herbaceum (A-genome), G. raimondii
(D-genome), TM-1 and Hai7124. Primers specific for the
A-genome resulted in amplifications from G. herbaceum,
TM-1 and Hai7124, but not from G. raimondii, which
indicated that the amplification products of TM-1 and
Hai7124 were from their A-subgenomes. Conversely,
the D-genome specific primers only amplified from
G. raimondii and D-subgenome of the allopolyploid.

RNA isolation and Q-PCR analysis

Total RNA was extracted from young fibers of G. hirsutum
acc. TM-1 and G. barbadense cv. Hai7124 at 0, 1, 3, 5, 8,
10, 14, 17, 20 and 23 DPA using the CTAB-acid phenol
extraction method [87]. RNA samples were treated with
DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions to remove trace contaminants of
genomic DNA. Total RNA samples (1 μg per reaction)
were reversely transcribed into cDNAs by avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase, and the cDNAs
were used as templates in Q-PCR reactions.
For each gene, the homeolog-specific primers were
designed based on the SNP between A- and D-subgenome homeologs (Additional file 7: Supplemental Table
S4). A cotton elongation factor (EF1a) gene was used as
a standard control in the Q-PCR reactions (Additional
file 7: Supplemental Table S4). The Q-PCR reaction and
calculated relative value for expression level of each
homeolog were determined as described by Wang et al.
[8]. The information of the Q-PCR analysis based on
the MIQE checklist was submitted in Additional file 8.
