Abstract
Background: Endo-1,4-beta-glucanases or cellulases from the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5)
have been found in numerous bacteria and fungi, and recently also in higher eukaryotes, particularly
in plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). The origin of these genes has been attributed to horizontal
gene transfer from bacteria, although there still is a lot of uncertainty about the origin and structure
of the ancestral GHF5 PPN endoglucanase. It is not clear whether this ancestral endoglucanase
consisted of the whole gene cassette, containing a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate-binding
module (CBM, type 2 in PPN and bacteria) or only of the catalytic domain while the CBM2 was
retrieved by domain shuffling later in evolution. Previous studies on the evolution of these genes
have focused primarily on data of sedentary nematodes, while in this study, extra data from
migratory nematodes were included.
Results: Two new endoglucanases from the migratory nematodes Pratylenchus coffeae and
Ditylenchus africanus were included in this study. The latter one is the first gene isolated from a PPN
of a different superfamily (Sphaerularioidea); all previously known nematode endoglucanases belong
to the superfamily Tylenchoidea (order Rhabditida). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with
the PPN GHF5 endoglucanases and homologous endoglucanases from bacterial and other
eukaryotic lineages such as beetles, fungi and plants. No statistical incongruence between the
phylogenetic trees deduced from the catalytic domain and the CBM2 was found, which could
suggest that both domains have evolved together. Furthermore, based on gene structure data, we
inferred a model for the evolution of the GHF5 endoglucanase gene structure in plant-parasitic
nematodes. Our data confirm a close relationship between Pratylenchus spp. and the root knot
nematodes, while some Radopholus similis endoglucanases are more similar to cyst nematode genes.
Conclusion: We conclude that the ancestral PPN GHF5 endoglucanase gene most probably
consisted of the whole gene cassette, i.e. the GHF5 catalytic domain and the CBM2, rather than
that it evolved by domain shuffling. Our evolutionary model for the gene structure in PPN GHF5
endoglucanases implies the occurrence of an early duplication event, and more recent gene
duplications at genus or species level.

Background
Endo-1,4-beta-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), or endoglucanases, can degrade the beta-1,4-linkages of cellulose, the
most abundant component of plant cell walls. The endoglucanases are classified in different glycosyl hydrolase
families (GHF) on the basis of sequence similarity and
hydrophobic cluster analysis [1]. Animal endoglucanases
belong to three structurally and presumably phylogenetically unrelated families: GHF5, GHF9 and GHF45 [2].
GHF5 genes are found in various plant-parasitic bacteria
and nematodes [3-6] from the order Rhabditida (infraorder Tylenchomorpha), which is part of one of the three
evolutionary independent plant-parasitic nematode
clades [7]. In the other two clades (Dorylaimida and Triplonchida), no GHF5 endoglucanases have been found so
far. Next to plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN), some protists, plants and fungi, as well as two beetle species [8,9]
have GHF5 endoglucanases. The domain structure of
GHF5 PPN endoglucanases shows remarkable similarity
to particular bacterial genes that consist of a GHF5 catalytic domain, a linker and a carbohydrate-binding module
of family 2 (CBM2) [10,11]. Interestingly, some GHF5
PPN endoglucanases lack the CBM. Other bacterial
endoglucanases as well as those from plants and fungi
contain different types of carbohydrate-binding modules,
while currently known GHF5 endoglucanases of protists
and beetles comprise no CBM.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria has been
proposed to explain the origin of GHF5 endoglucanases
in nematodes [12]. However, although HGT was also suggested to lie at the origin of GHF9 cellulases, this hypothesis was rejected based on recent evidence showing that
there was a GHF9 cellulase gene in the last common
ancestor of bilaterian animals [2]. At present, no hard evidence for the HGT hypothesis of GHF5 endoglucanases
has been found. An evolutionary scheme proposed for
GHF5 genes of sedentary nematodes by Ledger et al. [13]
hypothesized that after the possible HGT event, the
endoglucanase genes must have been duplicated several
times, and in some cases a sequential loss of the linker and
CBM occurred. This model assumes that the domain
structure of the ancestral PPN GHF5 endoglucanase consisted of a catalytic domain, a linker and a CBM, although
the structure of this ancestral gene has never been firmly
established. A possible HGT event from bacteria could
have involved the whole cassette as well as only the
CBM2. The fact that the GHF5 domain has also been
found in other eukaryotic lineages can be seen as evidence
for its presence in the ancestral eukaryote, and a subsequent combination with a horizontally-acquired CBM2
through 'early' (i.e. in one of the ancestral nematodes)
domain shuffling could have resulted in the presence of
proteins with both domains in PPN. For bacterial genes,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/305

domain shuffling between GHF5 and CBM2 domains has
already been proven [14].
Domain shuffling [15] is a special form of exon shuffling,
in which new combinations of exons (encompassing a
complete protein domain in the case of 'domain shuffling') from unrelated genes can be created by recombination within the intervening intron sequences, yielding
rearranged genes with altered function [16]. Since the discovery of introns there has been considerable debate concerning their origin and possible involvement in exon/
domain shuffling events.
The original introns-early concept states that (nearly) all
introns have been inherited by eukaryotic genes from
prokaryotic ancestors [16-19]. The difference in exon/
intron-structure among homologous genes is then considered to be mostly due to differential intron loss. Observed
relationships between intron locations and protein structures (module boundaries) are used as evidence for the
ancient origin of introns and for their role in exon/
domain shuffling [20].
Cavalier-Smith strongly disagrees with the introns-early
view [21]. On the basis of phylogenetic considerations
and the unique requirements of the eukaryotic nucleus, he
suggests that the original genes were uninterrupted. He
and other proponents of the introns-late theory argue that
the introns observed in extant genes occur at far too many
positions to have been present all together in a common
ancestral gene [22]. In addition, they argue that the
introns-early idea is hard to reconcile with the absence of
spliceosomal introns and the spliceosome itself in
prokaryotes (explained by 'introns-early' debaters as the
result of genome streamlining in prokaryotes). The
introns-late concept states that introns are an invention of
eukaryotes and new introns have been continuously
emerging during eukaryotic evolution [23]. This theory is
supported by the discovery of a conserved sequence at
exon-intron boundaries, called the protosplice-site
(MAG/R) [24], which is believed to be a specific target site
for newly gained introns, or a preferential site for intron
fixation.
A synthetic theory of intron evolution has been put forward by de Souza [25]. This intermediate position proposes that a subset of present-day introns is ancient, but
in addition, allows the emergence of some new introns.
The so-called 'many-introns-early-in-evolution' theory
places the origin of numerous spliceosomal introns during (and maybe playing a role in) eukaryotic radiation
[26]. Recent studies provide high support for this theory
[27-29]. The lack of conserved intron positions in ancient
paralogues was suggested to demonstrate that the invasion of group II self-splicing elements (which were to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:305

become spliceosomal introns in the future) occurred during gene duplication, most probably in the earliest phase
of eukaryotic evolution [30].
In order to determine the domain structure of the ancestral PPN GHF5 endoglucanase gene present in the PPN of
the phylum Tylenchomorpha, the evolution of the GHF5
catalytic domain and the CBM2 cassette was investigated
through phylogenetic analyses including sequences from
fungi, plants, protista and bacteria.
To study the subsequent evolution of the GHF5 endoglucanase gene family within nematodes, intron positions
were used as phylogenetic characters and a model was
developed for their evolution.
Until now, evolutionary models for PPN GHF5 endoglucanases focused on genes from cyst and root knot nematodes and one migratory nematode, all belonging to the
Tylenchoidea superfamily. In order to have a broader
overview of the endoglucanase evolution in the infraorder Tylenchomorpha, the gene structure of six additional genes was incorporated in our study. These include
the four Radopholus similis genes that were recently
described [6] and two novel GHF5 endoglucanases from
the migratory endoparasitic nematodes Pratylenchus coffeae and Ditylenchus africanus. The latter gene is the first
GHF5 endoglucanase isolated from the superfamily
Sphaerularioidea [31].

Results and discussion
Glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) endo-1,4-beta-glucanase genes have been identified in various plant-parasitic
nematodes (PPN). These genes have different structures:
all have a signal peptide and a catalytic domain, some
have an additional linker and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM, type 2 or CBM2) and others only have a linker
but no CBM2. This modular domain structure could have
arisen by exon or domain shuffling, a process by which a
chimeric protein is created by domains or segments of two
different genes through recombination in intron regions.
In bacteria, all endo-1,4-beta-glucanases are supposed to
originate from a few progenitor sequences by mutation
and domain shuffling [10] and Quillet et al. has proven
the validity of this hypothesis for an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus [14]. The
authors suggest that the catalytic domain and the CBM of
this endoglucanase were acquired by independent horizontal transfers from different soil bacteria, and that these
domains were assembled by exon shuffling to form a new
gene.
While the ancient origin of the PPN GHF5 endoglucanases (horizontal gene transfer or not [12]) still is a matter
of debate, in this study no support for an early exon/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/305

domain shuffling event after the independent gain of a
catalytic domain (e.g. through evolution from an eukaryotic ancestor) and a CBM2 (e.g. through HGT from bacteria) in an ancestral PPN species could be found in the
currently available sequence data.
Endoglucanase genes of Ditylenchus africanus and
Pratylenchus coffeae
Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase fragments were amplified by a
degenerate PCR on genomic DNA of D. africanus and P.
coffeae. This resulted in a fragment of 605 bp for D. africanus and a fragment of 443 bp for P. coffeae. Sequence analysis confirmed them to be endoglucanase fragments and
the genes were named Da-eng1 and Pc-eng1 respectively.
Full length sequences of the genes were obtained by
genome walking. The length of these sequences from start
till stop codon is 2007 bp for Da-eng1 and 1527 bp for Pceng1. The corresponding coding sequences were amplified
from a cDNA pool and have respective lengths of 1395 bp
and 1377 bp. Da-eng1 contains 5 introns whereas Pc-eng1
only has 3.

The putative endoglucanase proteins Da-ENG1 and PcENG1 have an estimated molecular weight of 49 and 47
kDa respectively. Both have a predicted N-terminal signal
peptide for secretion. A conserved domain search confirmed that the proteins are endoglucanases belonging to
the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5, pfam00150). In
addition to the catalytic domain, both proteins have a
linker and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of family 2 (pfam00553).
Phylogenetic analyses
In addition to the already known endoglucanase genes
from PPN and the newly identified sequences in this
study, we searched for the most homologous endoglucanase genes from other major lineages. Based on their
sequence similarity to the PPN endoglucanases, one or
more representative sequences were selected per lineage
for further analyses. These included GHF5 endoglucanase
sequences from the kingdom of Plantae, Animalia, Fungi,
Protista and Bacteria (See additional file 1). Some of these
genes consist of both a catalytic domain and a CBM, while
others lack the CBM.

Separate alignments were made for the catalytic domain
and the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of the
genes. Since not all GHF5 endoglucanase genes include a
CBM, the alignment and hence also the phylogenetic tree
for the CBM contained less taxa. For both domains, alignment of the sequences was performed at both DNA and
protein sequence level.
Alignments showed that plant sequences are not sufficiently similar to PPN GHF5 endoglucanases to be useful

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:305

for phylogenetic analyses. Preliminary unrooted phylogenetic tree construction with the other endoglucanases
revealed fungal sequences to be most divergent from PPN
GHF5 endoglucanases. Therefore they were chosen as outgroup to construct rooted trees. All alignments were analyzed using Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum
Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods.
No data from linker sequences have been included in this
study (except for the presence of intron 22 in the linker of
Mi-eng1, see further) because linkers show very little largescale sequence homology. At DNA level, only linkers from
very closely related genes show some degree of homology.
This is not surprising as the same observation has been
made for linkers from bacterial endoglucanases [10]. In
general, nematode linkers, as well as bacterial linkers, are
short and mainly composed of small or tiny amino acids
like glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, proline, and
lysine.
All evolutionary trees, whether based on DNA or protein
data, showed similar clustering, independent of the
method used.
Figure 1 shows the Bayesian tree based on the protein
alignment of the catalytic domain, using the fungal genes
as outgroup. Protist genes form a well-confirmed monophyletic group nested in the paraphyletic bacterial cluster.
Animal genes also form a monophyletic group in which
beetle genes cluster separately from the PPN genes.
Within the PPN, Mi-ENG2, Da-ENG1 and Hg-ENG6 are at
the base of the protein family but do not show a well-supported clustering. This grouping is correlated with their
aberrant exon/intron structure (see further). The divergence of Da-ENG1 at sequence and structural level is not
surprising since Ditylenchus africanus is the only species in
our study belonging to the Sphaerularioidea and not to
the Tylenchoidea.
A well-confirmed cluster groups the GHF5 endoglucanases of Pratylenchus coffeae and P. penetrans with those of
the root knot nematodes (genus Meloidogyne). Cyst nematode (Heterodera and Globodera) endoglucanases are
grouped together with some endoglucanases from Radopholus similis (classified in the Pratylenchidae family), RsENG1B and Rs-ENG3. Although the positions of RsENG1A and Rs-ENG2 are unresolved, these observations
partially confirm recent phylogenetic trees derived from
28SrRNA data [32] revealing a closer relationship of Radopholus similis to Heteroderidae than to Pratylenchidae.
This distinction was also observed on a morphological
level by Luc [33], who found that the genus Radopholus
can be distinguished from other genera in Pratylenchidae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/305

by its strong secondary sexual dimorphism and the distinctive lip pattern.
Paralogy between groups of proteins is well-confirmed by
high posterior probabilities. For instance, Rs-ENG3 and
Hg-ENG5 are paralogous to each other and to two orthologues from Globodera rostochiensis (Gr-ENG3 and GrENG4). Also, Rs-ENG1B is paralogous to some intra-species or intra-genus duplicates from Heterodera and Globodera spp.
The Bayesian tree based on the CBM (Figure 2) reveals a
similar clustering, and grouping of most PPN paralogues
is again supported by maximum probability values (eg.
Hs-ENG1 and Hg-ENG1; Pc-ENG1 and Pp-ENG1). However, posterior probabilities show low support for the relationships between genes from bacterial and PPN taxa.
This lack of support for evolutionary relationships
between nematode genes and genes from other major lineages precludes drawing conclusions about possible HGT
events between bacterial and eukaryotic genomes.
Congruency between the obtained phylogenetic trees
from the catalytic domain and the CBM was evaluated
under the parsimony and likelihood criterion using the
partition homogeneity and Shimodaira-Hasewaga (SH)
tests. These analyses were run for all genes with a CBM as
well as for a limited set excluding non-nematode taxa
(PPN dataset). Interestingly, no statistical incongruence
between all trees based on the GHF5 catalytic domain and
on the CBM2 was found for the whole and the PPN dataset (Table 1). This observation suggests that these
domains have evolved together.
Figure 3 shows a comparison between the evolutionary
trees of the GHF5 catalytic domain and the CBM domain
for all PPN genes that contain both domains. Support values from Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood
and Bayesian analysis are shown on the nodes. This representation demonstrates the possible congruent evolutionary tracts of both domains. Most clades are confirmed by
both evolutionary trees with high posterior probabilities
and/or bootstrap values.
Investigation of gene/domain structure and intron
properties
The exon/intron gene structure of the PPN GHF5 endoglucanases was compared with the multiple protein
sequence alignment. All introns and their properties are
represented in Figure 4.

The ORF (Open Reading Frame) of PPN GHF5 endoglucanase genes is interrupted by maximum 8 introns (Hgeng1) (Figure 4) with an average of 5.28 introns. The average length of each intron is 132 bp, making a total of 697

67% of the analysed introns are in phase 0, while only
17% correspond to phase 1 or phase 2. Phase 0 is highly
over-represented in PPN endoglucanases, as also observed
by Ledger et al. [13], with twice the expected value for an
addition of intron with equal probability for the three
codon sites. This is also considerably higher than the
observed prevalence in C. elegans (47% [34]). 49% (54/
110) of the exons are symmetrical. As a consequence of
this high over-representation of phase 0 introns, symmetrical exons of type 0-0 (44%, 48/110) are largely in excess
compared to symmetrical exons of type 1-1 (4%, 4/110)
or type 2-2 (2%, 2/110). The observed excess of phase 0
introns can be due to the preferential retention of these
introns by natural selection [37] or as a consequence of
the burst of domain shuffling that has been shown to
coincide with the big bang of metazoan radiation in the
Cambrian period [15,38].
Exon-intron boundaries were compared for all introns
observed in the available PPN GHF5 endoglucanase gene
sequences. The great majority of the detected introns are
of the GU-AG type. Only three intron positions (intron
13, 17a and 17b) show the alternative, but rare (0.6% in
C. elegans) GC-AG splice site in a minority of the homologues. This non-classical splice site was already reported
by Yan et al. [39].
A consensus 5' and 3' splice site was deduced from the
exon-intron boundaries and is shown in Figure 5. Comparing this consensus with the previously described C. elegans splice site consensus [40] shows a low degree of
conservation both at the 5' and 3' side. Low 5' splice site
conservation has been shown to be correlated with a large
intron number and the ability to generate alternatively
spliced mRNAs [41].

endoglucanase genes (n = 23) is 22%, whereas for R. similis introns (n = 13) it is 42%. This is probably related to
the overall GC% of the coding sequences of a certain species. M. incognita coding sequences generally have a relatively low GC content (37%) [35], whereas R. similis
coding sequences have a high GC content (54%) [36].

Protosplice site tendency in PPN GHF5 endoglucanases is
moderately high as 46% (11/24) of the introns show a
consensus splice site that is completely consistent with the
protosplice site (MAG/R), pointing to a probable recent
origin of these introns.
Even though many clusters of closely spaced introns were
detected in the aligned sequence, no evidence was found
in our study, or in other studies, that proves their possible
homology. Although intron sliding cannot be completely
ruled out, the influence of this process is considered to be
negligible (except for sliding by one base), and intron

Figure 4 overview of the exon/intron structure of all available genomic sequences from PPN GHF5 endoglucanase genes
Schematic
Schematic overview of the exon/intron structure of all available genomic sequences from PPN GHF5 endoglucanase genes. Introns are considered to be homologous when they appear at exactly the same location in the amino acid
alignment. Phase of the introns is shown by gray-scale boxes. Length of the introns (in bp) is given inside each box. Domains, as
identified by the SMART tool (PFAM database), are represented above the genes. Exon/intron and domain length are not
drawn to scale.
position diversity is indicated to be primarily arising by
the gain or loss of introns during eukaryotic evolution
[22]. Therefore, a pair of introns was required to occur in
the exact same position in the aligned sequence of the
orthologous/paralogous genes to be considered homologous.
Noteworthy, there is a strong conservation of the location
and phase of introns within the PPN GHF5 gene family
[13]. This conservation is evident among orthologous
genes, but also among paralogues. Some intron positions
are very well conserved (intron 2, 10, 13, 16, 17b, 21 and
23) while others only occur in one gene (intron 3, 6, 7, 8,
11, 12, 15, 19, 22).
Since spliceosomal introns diverge so rapidly that
sequence similarity indicative of homology quickly vanishes, significant intron sequence conservation can only
be expected in genes resulting from very recent duplications. Sequence comparisons between introns that are
conserved in the majority of the dataset indeed showed
similarities between paralogous genes. For instance,
introns of Gr-eng1 and Gr-eng2 as well as Gr-eng3 and Greng4 reveal remarkable similarity. This is also the case for
introns in Hg-eng2, Hg-eng3 and Hg-eng4. The conserved

introns of the Meloidogyne endoglucanase genes are also
very similar, confirming the homology of these conserved
introns and the paralogy of the genes.
As could be expected based on the low number of informative sites (14), Wagner Parsimony of the 1/0-data for
intron presence/absence shows very low resolution (See
additional file 2). Only some paralogous and orthologous
genes with very similar exon/intron structure are grouped
together with relatively high bootstrap support. For
instance, Mi-eng2 and Hg-eng6 form a well-confirmed
cluster. This is also the case for some groups of paralogues
and orthologues from H. glycines, G. rostochiensis and R.
similis. Generally, resolved branches show similar clustering as catalytic domain and CBM-based trees implying
that intron presence data reflect the evolutionary tract of
PPN GHF5 genes.
Objections against an early domain shuffling event
With the currently available endoglucanase sequences, no
evidence for the domain shuffling hypothesis could be
found. No statistical incongruence between the evolutionary history of the GHF5 catalytic domain and the CBM2 in
the whole dataset as well as in PPN only (Table 1 and Fig.

3) was detected. Some additional trends in the gene structure data also decline the domain shuffling idea.

same terminal branches, although the length and
sequence of introns have diverged.

Gilbert [42] proposed that correlation between intron
locations and structural elements implies a role for
introns in the evolution of proteins. The intronic architecture of the GHF5 endoglucanase genes was mapped onto
a multiple protein sequence alignment in the context of
the overall secondary structure of an archetypal GHF5
endoglucanase (See additional file 3), but there appears to
be no general correlation.

Our working hypothesis proposes that the divergence of
the gene structure of the PPN GHF5 gene family is associated with the expansion of the number of members from
an ancient or early eukaryotic ancestral gene. The possible
congruent evolutionary tract of modules, as observed in
this study (Table 1 and Fig. 3), suggests that the ancestral
PPN GHF5 gene probably contained a CBM2. Bacterial
endoglucanases show significant sequence homology in
both domains and if the HGT hypothesis is true then the
analyzed GHF5 endoglucanases likely evolved from a bacterial orthologue containing both domains. Present-day
PPN GHF5 endoglucanase genes exhibit a large diversity
of exon/intron structures, but protein sequences in the
catalytic domain are relatively well-conserved. Generally,
PPN GHF5 endoglucanases contain a rather high number
of introns. It is known that paralogues undergo functional
diversification, which tends to be accompanied by a weakened selection and the acceleration of sequence evolution
[43]. Babenko et al. [44] observed two clear trends in the
evolution of paralogous gene families: the evolution of
their gene structure is notably dynamic, and this evolution
involves more intron gains than losses. In addition,
Logsdon et al. noticed that nematodes have a particularly
high rate of intron turnover compared to other animals
[45]. These tendencies are also recognizable in the PPN
GHF5 gene family. Based on the recent indications that
introns emerged during the earliest phases of eukaryotic
evolution [30] our model starts from an intronless ancestral PPN GHF5 endoglucanase gene.

However, some conserved intron positions are specifically
located at the border of the catalytic domain and could
therefore be implicated in domain shuffling. Introns 20
and 21 are found in the transition zone between the catalytic domain and the linker region in many genes. Intron
1 is located after the signal peptide, and before the start of
the catalytic domain, but is only present in two genes. Successful domain shuffling requires that the domains are
bordered by introns that are of the same phase, that is,
that the domain is symmetrical [15], because shuffling of
asymmetrical exons/domains will result in a frame-shift.
The only possible symmetric, and hence movable,
domain would be a 1-1 domain bordered by intron 1 and
intron 21. Although 1-1 symmetrical domains are suggested to be frequently associated with domain shuffling
events [38], the low conservation of intron 1 among the
investigated gene structures (it is only present in 2 genes)
as well as its well-conserved protosplice site point to a
quite recent origin, and therefore make its involvement in
a possible domain shuffling event very unlikely.
Finally, exon or domain shuffling is more likely to involve
large introns as the frequency of recombination is known
to be proportional to DNA length. Although we cannot
exclude the possibility that larger introns were present in
an ancestral GHF5 PPN endoglucanase, introns in the
present-day nematode genes are extremely small (also for
introns 20 and 21) and are therefore less likely to be
involved in recombination.
A model for the evolution of introns in the PPN GHF5
endoglucanases
A model was constructed by combining the sequencebased evolutionary tracts with the intron data. Figure 6
shows a Bayesian tree obtained from the catalytic domain
for all genes for which the exon/intron structure is available. The gene evolution model plotted onto this tree is
based on the parsimony principle, meaning that the
occurrence of intron gain and loss events during evolution
is minimized.

The evolutionary tree based on the catalytic domains
shows the genes with the same structure grouped in the

The exon/intron structure of Hg-eng6 and Mi-eng2 and
their sequence divergence from the other genes indicate
that they have probably originated from a different type of
GHF5 gene (type A). This implies that the ancestral PPN
GHF5 endoglucanase must have been duplicated already
early in the Tylenchomorpha lineage. This early duplication event was also suggested by Ledger et al. [13]. During
or shortly after this duplication one of the copies (type A)
must have lost its linker and CBM2. All other genes are
proposed to have evolved from the second copy (type B)
containing linker and CBM2. Selection might have played
a role in the preferential conservation of this type, possibly due to a positive effect of the CBM2. Whether intron
23 has been gained before, during or shortly after the
duplication cannot be evaluated based on the available
sequence data.
In the ancestral nematode of the lineage leading to the
cyst nematodes and Radopholus similis, a second gene
duplication took place. These nematodes all contain two
divergent types of GHF5 endoglucanases within their
genomes.

Proposed model for GHF5 endoglucanase gene structure evolution in plant-parasitic nematodes
Proposed model for GHF5 endoglucanase gene structure evolution in plant-parasitic nematodes. The model was
constructed by phylogenetic mapping of gene structure changes applying the parsimony principle (reducing the number of
intron gains/losses during evolution), onto a Bayesian tree obtained from those PPN GHF5 genes for which gene structure
information was available (Posterior probabilities are indicated in red for each node). Introns are numbered as specified in Figure 4. Assumed gene structures are schematically drawn for certain interesting nodes: the catalytic domain is represented by a
white box, the linker is shown as a grey box and the CBM2 is shown as a green box; Intron presence is shown by dotted lines.
RT: Reverse Transcription. See text for a more detailed explanation.
At intra-species level, the conserved gene structure of certain paralogues and the observation of some sequence
conservation in their introns indicate a history of recent
duplication events in the present-day genomes of plantparasitic nematodes.
Ledger et al. [13] also proposed an evolutionary scheme
for the evolution of GHF5 endoglucanases in plant-parasitic nematodes. Their model proposed two ancestral copies of the GHF5 endoglucanase gene: one with and one

without CBM, which is in agreement with our data. However, the model of Ledger et al. [13] does not take duplication events in ancestral taxa (e.g. as we have detected in
the ancestor of Radopholus similis and the cyst nematodes)
into consideration and is therefore confusing in regard of
gene and species evolution.
In some cases, intra-species duplicates lost their CBM and
occasionally also their linker region. Generally, the
observed variation in exon/intron structures between

homologous and paralogous genes implies that introns
have been gained and lost along all major lineages of the
tree and at different time points during evolution. Concordant with the fact that the conservation of protosplice
sites strongly supports the recent origin of an intron [46],
recently gained introns in our model (intron 5, 6, 12, 15,
19 and 22) show a stronger conservation of the protosplice site (MAG|R) than older introns.
Our model implies some special evolutionary gene structure processes for which little information is available and
that are therefore difficult to prove.
The phylogenetic hallmark of intron sliding is a distribution in which one intron is nested within the distribution
of another [22]. We propose the occurrence of intron sliding for two introns in our model, namely sliding of intron
17a to intron 17b and intron 2 to intron 3, and this
hypothesis is based on their close vicinity (1 nucleotide
between 17a and 17b and 3 nucleotides between 2 and 3)
and the apparent nested distribution. While the nested
clustering theory of Stoltzfus et al. [22] pertains for these
introns and they are located in very close vicinity, the fast
evolution of intron sequences precludes the ability of
finding significant sequence similarity at intron-level. In
literature, the few established reports of intron sliding all
involve very recent events [47-50]. Alternative mechanisms like separate gain and loss events might equally
likely have been involved in the observed pattern of
intron distribution.
The genes with no or only one intron probably have lost
their introns by reverse transcription and subsequent
homologous reinsertion of the synthesized cDNA, affecting either the whole gene or only a part of it. Hg-eng5 is an
example of a gene where this process might have happened. We propose a similar mechanism for Rs-eng1A and
Rs-eng2, involving a reverse-transcribed mRNA containing
only a catalytic domain, but in this case the recombination must have been followed by a duplication event. The
loss of introns through reverse transcription of mRNAs
followed by the recombination of the synthesized cDNA
in the genome [51-53] is hard to prove and an alternative
gene duplication event cannot be ruled out because the
genomes of plant-parasitic nematodes probably contain
more GHF5 endoglucanase genes than currently available
in databases. If a gene duplication would have given rise
to these genes, then a closely related paralogue, generated
in the same duplication event, should be found in the
genome [54]. The impossibility to establish a clear relation between the intronless gene Hg-eng5 and any other
gene from the same species suggests that reverse transcription followed by a homologous reinsertion is most probable. For Rs-eng1A and Rs-eng2, the reverse transcription
event is supposed to have taken place earlier in evolution,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/305

involving only the 5' end, and should have been followed
by a duplication event, the loss of linker and CBM and a
gain of intron 21 in one of the paralogues.

Conclusion
This study integrates previously known sequence information from mainly sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes
and new data from different migratory nematode species.
With the available data from PPN GHF5 endoglucanases
and other major prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages no
evidence for an early domain shuffling event between the
two domains (GHF5 catalytic domain and CBM2) present
in these genes was found, suggesting parallel evolutionary
tracts. Moreover, the phylogenetic data confirmed that
some endoglucanases of the migratory species Radopholus
similis are more related to genes from the Heteroderidae,
while Pratylenchus spp. show a close relationship to the
root knot nematodes.
Our evolutionary model for the PPN GHF5 gene family
proposes an intronless ancestral GHF5 endoglucanase
gene in plant-parasitic nematodes, consisting of a catalytic
domain and a CBM2. Early in the evolution of plant-parasitic nematodes, the ancestral gene must have been
duplicated, and numerous introns were gained. Later in
evolution, some introns were lost, gained or shifted in certain lineages, and additional duplication events frequently took place. Our data reveal that loss of the CBM2
and in some cases also the linker region almost certainly
occurred independently in different lineages.
While our data show that exon shuffling most probably
did not lie at the origin of the emergence of the PPN GHF5
endoglucanase domain structure, more recent exon/
domain shuffling events at lower taxonomic levels cannot
be ruled out.
In this study the HGT hypothesis can neither be accepted
nor rejected. Additional sequence data from other major
eukaryotic lineages are awaited before a thorough and
sound investigation of this problem can be realized. However, evidence was provided that it is very unlikely that an
ancestral eukaryotic GHF5 catalytic domain was joined
with a horizontally-acquired CBM2 in the early evolution
of the PPN GHF5 domain structure. Therefore, HGT of the
whole structural cassette (GHF5-linker-CBM2) remains
one of the most likely explanations for its presence in
both bacteria and PPN.

Methods
Nematode culture
Pratylenchus coffeae and Ditylenchus africanus were maintained on carrot disks in small petri dishes at a constant
temperature of 25°C [55]. Nematodes were collected by
rinsing the petri dishes with sterile demineralized water

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:305

approximately 5 weeks (for D. africanus) or 8 weeks (for P.
coffeae) after inoculation of the carrot disks. Collected
nematodes of mixed stages were stored as a pellet at -20°C
for DNA or RNA extraction.
Cloning of endoglucanase genes
Genomic DNA was isolated from the nematodes according to Bolla et al. [56]. RNA extraction was done with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg
RNA, 4 mM dNTP's, 0.5 μM oligodT primer (T25VN), 10
mM DTT, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM
MgCl2 and 200 U Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). This reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h
at 42°C.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate
primers ENG1 (TAYGTIATHGTIGAYTGGCA) and ENG2
(GTICCRTAYTCIGTIACRAA) [4] was performed on
genomic DNA of P. coffeae and D. africanus. The reaction
mixture contained 150 ng DNA, 0.5 μM of each primer, 4
mM each of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH8.3), 50 mM KCl and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: 2' at
94°C followed by 35 cycles of 1' at 94°C, 1' at 52°C and
1' at 72°C. Resulting fragments were separated on a 0.5×
TAE 1.5% agarose gel, excised and purified by the
QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified fragments
were ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) and transformed in
E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). A colony PCR under
standard conditions revealed the presence or absence of
inserts. Plasmids of positive colonies were isolated using
the Nucleobond AX kit (Machery-Nagel) and the insert
was sequenced at the VIB Genetic Service Facility (VIBGSF, Antwerp, Belgium).
To obtain the 5' and 3' genomic sequences of the endoglucanase fragments, the Genome Walker Universal kit
(Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Primers used for the P. coffeae fragment were
Pc-eng1-up1 (TTGGAGTCAATGGCCCGGATGG), Pceng1-up2 (GATGTTCGGATTGGAGCCATATTGC) to walk
upstream en Pc-eng1-down1 (TCAAATCTCTGCTACACTCTCCAC) and Pc-eng1-down2 (CAAACAATCCCTCAGGGATAAGGC) to walk downstream. For the D.
africanus fragment, Da-eng1-up1 (CCAGCGTATTTTTGTGCCATTTGG), Da-eng1-up2 (CTCTCAACCAATATCTTTGACTTAACAGC),
Da-eng1-down1
(AATAGTCGCGTTTAGGACGTGGACGTC) and Da-eng1down2 (TCCACTTCTACGCCGGCACTCAC) were used to
walk up- and downstream respectively. The longest
obtained fragments were cloned and sequenced as
described above. Corresponding cDNA sequences of the
endoglucanase genes were amplified by PCR using genespecific
primers

TCGCCAGCCTCG) and Da-eng1-stop (TCAGCAATATCCATAAGACACAACGC) on the cDNA pool of D. africanus
and Pc-eng1-start (ATGGCATTCACTTTGCTTTCC) and
Pc-eng1-stop (TGTGAGCGCCACTGCCTGCTAA) on P.
coffeae cDNA. These cDNA sequences were cloned and
sequenced as described above. Obtained sequences were
submitted to the GenBank database (Da-eng1: EU180235;
Pc-eng1: EU176871).
Putative protein sequences were obtained by translating
the cDNA sequences using the EMBOSS program
"Transeq" [57]. The molecular weight of the proteins was
estimated by the "pI/Mw" tool of the Expasy server http:/
/us.expasy.org. Signal peptides were predicted using SignalP 3.0 [58].
Sequence searches and alignments
Using BlastX, a GenBank search for all available endoglucanase gene sequences from nematode species was performed on May 21, 2007. For comparison, the most
homologous endoglucanases from other eukaryotic and
prokaryotic lineages were included in the dataset (See
additional file 1).

Protein, DNA and mRNA sequences were downloaded.
Domains were identified using the SMART tool [59],
which is based on the PFAM database. Sequences were
aligned using ClustalW [60] and then manually adjusted
in BioEdit [61].
Exon-intron structure analyses
The presence, location and phase of introns were evaluated for each open reading frame (ORF) by comparing
DNA and mRNA sequences. Intron positions were
mapped onto the sequence alignments. Intron phase was
named 0 when the intron was located in-between two
consecutive codons; 1 if an intron was located between
the first and second codon nucleotides and 2 if an intron
was found between the second and third codon nucleotides. The intron positions were mapped onto the secondary structure (See additional file 3). Positions of alpha
helices and beta strands in the catalytic domain were
deduced from an alignment of all nematode endoglucanases with an endoglucanase from Erwinia chrysanthemi
(1EGZC), which has a known 3D structure. For the carbohydrate-binding module, the location of the beta strands
was inferred by aligning the sequences to a CBM from an
endoglucanase from Cellulomonas fimi (1EXG). GC percentages of the introns were calculated with the internet
tool GC calculator http://www.genomicsplace.com/
gc_calc.html.
Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses were executed using
PAUP* v4.0b10 [62], on the informative characters of the

mRNA and protein alignments using the heuristic search
option with random sequence addition (100 random replications) and TBR branch-swapping. Support for the different clusters was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (100
replicates).
Intron presence was coded by binary scoring (1/0) for
presence/absence. Introns were only considered to be
homologous when they appeared at exactly the same position and the same phase in the orthologous/paralogous
genes. Although Dollo Parsimony is frequently used in
intron evolution [26], recent evidence shows that this
method tends to underestimate the number of introns in
ancestral nodes and to overestimate the number of gains
in branches leading to extant species [63] since it is based
on the assumption that intron presence originated only
once in the tree. Considering the fact that no consensus
has been reached about the dominance of intron gain or
loss during eukaryotic evolution, our 1/0-data were analysed using Wagner Parsimony [64].
Congruence between the obtained Maximum Parsimony
trees based on catalytic domain and CBM was tested using
the partition homogeneity test (HTF) as designated by
Johnson & Soltis [65], which is analogous to the ILD
(incongruence length difference) test of Farris et al. [66] as
implemented in PAUP* v4.0b10 using the heuristic
search option with random sequence addition (100 random replications) and TBR branch-swapping.
Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Tests were performed on all
datasets using Modeltest 3.5 [67] to determine the best-fitting evolutionary model. Estimated model parameters
were applied in a Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis in
PAUP* v4.0b10 using the heuristic search option with
random sequence addition, for DNA sequences. Tree-puzzle 5.2 [68] was used for ML analysis of protein sequences.
Support for the different clusters was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (100 replicates).
In order to compare trees obtained from ML analyses,
congruence between tree topologies derived from catalytic
domain and CBM, was statistically evaluated using the
likelihood-based test of Shimodaira & Hasewaga (SHtest) [69] as implemented in Tree-puzzle 5.2.
Bayesian analysis was run using MrBayes version 3.1.2
[70].
For the DNA datasets the best-fitting evolutionary model,
as identified using Modeltest 3.5, was applied. For the
protein datasets a mixed model of amino acid evolution
was applied to allow model-jumping for fixed-rate models. Bayesian inference was run for 1,000,000 generations,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/305

and the first 25,000 generations were discarded as burnin.

Intron positions of a typical PPN GHF5 endoglucanase in relation to
the secondary gene structure. The position of alpha helices and beta
strands was derived from comparison to known crystal structures of a
GHF5 catalytic domain (1EGZC) and a CBM2 (1EXG). The signal peptide, catalytic domain, linker and CBM, are indicated in red, blue, yellow
and green respectively. Transition zones are white. Arrows represent beta
strands; boxes alpha helices. Introns are represented by a vertical black line
and numbered in order of their occurrence, as specified in Figure 4.
