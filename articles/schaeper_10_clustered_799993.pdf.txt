A clustered set of three Sp-family genes is
ancestral in the Metazoa: evidence from
sequence analysis, protein domain structure,
developmental expression patterns and
chromosomal location
Nina D Schaeper, Nikola-Michael Prpic, Ernst A Wimmer*

Abstract
Background: The Sp-family of transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved zinc finger proteins present in
many animal species. The orthology of the Sp genes in different animals is unclear and their evolutionary history is
therefore controversially discussed. This is especially the case for the Sp gene buttonhead (btd) which plays a key
role in head development in Drosophila melanogaster, and has been proposed to have originated by a recent gene
duplication. The purpose of the presented study was to trace orthologs of btd in other insects and reconstruct the
evolutionary history of the Sp genes within the metazoa.
Results: We isolated Sp genes from representatives of a holometabolous insect (Tribolium castaneum), a
hemimetabolous insect (Oncopeltus fasciatus), primitively wingless hexapods (Folsomia candida and Thermobia
domestica), and an amphipod crustacean (Parhyale hawaienis). We supplemented this data set with data from fully
sequenced animal genomes. We performed phylogenetic sequence analysis with the result that all Sp factors fall
into three monophyletic clades. These clades are also supported by protein domain structure, gene expression, and
chromosomal location. We show that clear orthologs of the D. melanogaster btd gene are present even in the
basal insects, and that the Sp5-related genes in the genome sequence of several deuterostomes and the basal
metazoans Trichoplax adhaerens and Nematostella vectensis are also orthologs of btd.
Conclusions: All available data provide strong evidence for an ancestral cluster of three Sp-family genes as well as
synteny of this Sp cluster and the Hox cluster. The ancestral Sp gene cluster already contained a Sp5/btd ortholog,
which strongly suggests that btd is not the result of a recent gene duplication, but directly traces back to an
ancestral gene already present in the metazoan ancestor.

Background
Zinc finger transcription factors are a large and widespread family of DNA binding proteins and play an
important role in transcriptional regulation (e.g. [1]).
The general transcription factor Sp1 (named after the
original purification method through sephacryl and
phosphocellulose columns) was the first identified and
cloned binding-specific human transcription factor [2-4].

In the meantime a number of additional genes related
to Sp1 have been identified in the human genome, and
homologous genes have been isolated from several other
animal species as well (e.g. [1,5]). The members of this
Sp-family of transcription factors share three highly conserved Cys2His2-type zinc fingers, which bind to G-rich
DNA elements, such as GC-boxes (GGGGCGGGG) and
GT/CACC-boxes (GGTGTGGGG) [4]. These binding
sites are present in many control regions of both tissuespecific and ubiquitously expressed genes [6,7] indicating that Sp-family transcription factors potentially regulate a large number of target genes. Indeed, it was

shown that Sp-family transcription factors have diverse
functions throughout the embryonic development of
humans and other animals. For instance, in vertebrates
they are involved in cell cycle regulation, the control of
morphogenetic pathways, the development of several
organ systems, and they also have been linked to the
development of cancer (e.g. [5,8-17]). In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the gene buttonhead (btd) codes for
a member of the Sp-family, which represents an important factor for the formation of several head segments
and is also involved in the development of the central
and peripheral nervous system [8,18-20].
The number of Sp-family genes present in the genome
varies in the Metazoa. Humans and mice, for example,
have nine Sp-family genes [5], and some teleost fishes
have even more (11 in the pufferfish Fugu rubripes [21],
13 in the zebrafish Danio rerio [22]). From D. melanogaster two Sp-family genes have been reported, btd and DSp1 [8], but a third one is present in the fully sequenced
genome sequence [23]. This variable complement of Spfamily genes and their evolutionary diversification made
it difficult to assign orthology between the genes of different species. Therefore, the ancestral number of Spfamily genes and the evolution and orthology of the
hitherto identified Sp-family genes was unclear. This
situation also led to a considerable confusion in the
nomenclature of the Sp-family genes and to several
unfortunate designations of not directly homologous Spfamily members with homonymous names thus misleadingly suggesting orthology. For example, D. melanogaster D-Sp1 is not most closely related to human Sp1 but
to Sp8 [24] and the gene originally termed mouse mBtd
is in fact orthologous to Sp8 [13].
Especially the origin and orthology of the D. melanogaster head gap gene btd has been debated. Previous
studies discovered functional similarities between btd
and some vertebrate Sp genes, but could not confidently
identify a genuine btd orthologue in vertebrates
[13,15,25], and it had been proposed that the btd gene
might be the result of a recent gene duplication when
another Sp-family gene, D-Sp1, in the vicinity of btd was
discovered in D. melanogaster [8,20]. This gene is not
only located directly next to btd, but the two genes also
have similar postblastodermal expression patterns and
partially overlapping developmental functions [8,20]. All
this suggested that btd evolved by a tandem duplication
in the phylogenetic lineage leading to D. melanogaster.
In order to reconstruct the evolution of the Sp-family
genes, we have first tried to trace homologs of btd in
other insects. We have surveyed not only additional dipterans and other holometabolous insects, but we have
also searched for Sp-family genes in representatives of
hemimetabolous insects (the heteropteran Oncopeltus
fasciatus) and the primitively wingless ectognathous and

Page 2 of 18

entognathous hexapods (the zygopteran Thermobia
domestica and the collembolan Folsomia candida,
respectively). We could identify clear orthologs of the D.
melanogaster btd gene in these basal hexapods, indicating that the proposed gene duplication did not take
place recently within the insects. We have therefore performed a comprehensive study of Sp-family gene evolution based on phylogenetic sequence analysis, protein
domain structure characteristics, spatio-temporal mRNA
expression analysis, as well as genomic localisation analysis. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the available
Sp-family factors fall into three large clades and that a
true btd ortholog is already present in the basal metazoans Trichoplax adhaerens and Nematostella vectensis.
The proteins in each clade also display similar structural
characteristics and often form a cluster of three genes in
the genome. Intriguingly, the available data suggest that
this Sp gene cluster has been ancestrally linked to the
Hox gene cluster and in the vertebrates appears to have
been affected by the multiple duplications of this cluster.
This synteny and co-evolution of the Hox and the Sp
clusters in the vertebrates also explains the high number
of Sp-family genes in this animal group.

Results and Discussion
A search for Sp-family genes in insects and crustaceans

As mentioned in the introduction, previous work had suggested that D. melanogaster possesses two closely related
Sp genes, btd and D-Sp1 [8,19]. However, a search in the
fully sequenced D. melanogaster genome revealed the presence of an additional gene, CG5669, with high similarity
to btd and D-Sp1. This complement of three Sp-family
genes could be the result of a recent gene duplication
[8,20]. In order to identify when such a gene duplication
event might have occured, we sought to identify the number of Sp-family genes in additional insect species.
We searched the genome sequence of selected insect
species with fully sequenced genomes. In addition we performed PCR-based surveys in specially selected additional
species. In the Diptera, a complement of three Sp-family
genes seems to be the rule: in the genome sequences of
Drosophila pseudobscura and the mosquito Anopheles
gambiae we found three different Sp-family genes each.
We then searched in the genomes of species outside the
Diptera. In the lepidopteran Bombyx mori (silk moth), the
hymenopterans Apis mellifera (honeybee) and Nasonia
vitripennis (jewel wasp), and the coleopteran Tribolium
castaneum (flour beetle) we also detected three Sp-family
genes each. This taxon sampling included only holometabolous insects and we have therefore also isolated cDNA
fragments of Sp-family genes from representatives of the
hemimetabolous and the primitively wingless hexapods. In
the higher hemimetabolous heteropteran O. fasciatus
(milkweed bug), we were able to isolate two different

Schaeper et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/88

Sp-family gene fragments. The Zygentoma represent the
youngest branch of the primitively wingless insects [26].
We have used the zygentoman T. domestica (firebrat),
from which we could isolate three different Sp-family gene
fragments. The Collembola are members of the most basal
branch of the primitive hexapods (Entognatha) [26]. In the
collembolan F. candida (white springtail), we were also
able to detect three different fragments of Sp-family genes.
These results show that a complement of three Spfamily genes is present in all studied hexapod species,
except for O. fasciatus for which the genome sequence
is not available and a third Sp-family member could
have been missed in our PCR-based search. We have
then tried to establish the number of Sp-family genes in
the Crustacea, which phylogenetically is the sister group
of the insects according to recent analyses (e.g. [27-30]).
The waterflea Daphnia pulex is a member of the Branchiopoda. In the fully sequenced genome of D. pulex we
detected the presence of three different Sp-family genes.
The Malacostraca (higher crustaceans) are a group of
primitively marine species. We have used PCR to isolate
Sp-family gene fragments from the malacostracan Parhyale hawaiensis (beachhopper), which yielded two different fragments. However, as with the results for O.
fasciatus the PCR survey may have missed an additional
Sp-family gene in P. hawaiensis.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a
complement of three different Sp-family genes is ancestral in the arthropods. Interestingly, three different
Sp-family genes are also present in the fully sequenced
genomes of the basal chordate lineage Branchiostoma
floridae, and the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Three different Sp-family genes are also present in
the fully sequenced genomes of the cnidarian N. vectensis, and the placozoan T. adhaerens - both representing
basal branches in the metazoan phylogenetic tree. This
could be taken as evidence that the possession of three
Sp-family genes is ancestral in the Metazoa. On the
other hand, the high number of Sp-family genes in
the genomes of vertebrates (e.g. nine Sp-family genes in
humans and mice, 7 in the chicken, and more than 10
in fish), indicates that the Sp-genes can be subject to
frequent duplications. Thus, the “triplets” in insects,
cnidarians, placozoans, echinoderms, and basal chordates might potentially have originated independently.
Phylogenetic analysis of Sp-family genes supports three
large clades

In order to distinguish between a possible ancestral set of
three Sp-family genes and the alternative possibility of several independent duplication events, we reconstructed the
evolutionary history of identified Sp-family factors and
assigned orthology by phylogenetic sequence analysis. We
used the amino acid sequence of the region including the

Page 3 of 18

Btd box, the three zinc fingers and the sequence in
between these two domains of all available Sp-family factors of Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse),
Gallus gallus (chicken), D. rerio (zebrafish), F. rubripes
(pufferfish), B. floridae (lancelet), S. purpuratus (sea
urchin), T. adhaerens (placozoan), N. vectensis (sea anemone), and the insect and crustacean species mentioned
above in a maximum likelihood analysis with the Tree
Puzzle program package. The resulting unrooted tree is
shown in Fig. 1a and the alignment is shown in Additional
File 1. The tree comprises three large monophyletic
groups. One clade contains Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4 of the
vertebrate species and a single Sp representative of each of
the invertebrate species. We term this clade the Sp1-4
clade. The second clade contains Sp5 of the vertebrate
species and again a single Sp representative of each of the
invertebrate species, except for O. fasciatus and P.
hawaiensis for which we failed to obtain three different
Sp-family genes in our PCR survey. Because this clade also
contains the well-known Btd from D. melanogaster, we
call this clade the Sp5/Btd clade. The third clade contains
Sp6, Sp7, Sp8, and Sp9 of all vertrebrate species and a single Sp representative of each of the invertebrates. We call
this clade the Sp6-9 clade. In order to facilitate the unique
identification of the genes, we refer to all genes (except
those that already have an official name) using the clade
name to which they belong in this phylogenetic analysis.
The distribution of a single Sp factor of each invertebrate
species to each of the three clades strongly suggests that a
set of three Sp-family genes, namely one Sp1-4, one Sp5/
btd and one Sp6-9 gene, is the ancestral state in the Metazoa and that the higher number in vertebrates resulted
from further duplications in the vertebrate lineage due to
the whole genome duplications that occured early in vertebrate evolution (discussed below).
We have in addition performed a Bayesian analysis of
the same dataset. The resulting unrooted tree is shown in
Fig. 1b. The Bayesian tree differs from the quartet puzzling
tree in several places, but the only marked differences are
Sp5/Btd and Sp1-4 from T. adhaerens, which are not
included in the Sp5/Btd and Sp1-4 clade, respectively. The
inconsistent placement of these T. adhaerens sequences in
the two analyses might be explained by the phylogenetically old age of this lineage. Importantly, the three monophyletic clades Sp1-4, Sp5/Btd, and Sp6-9 are also
recovered with this method and all three clades have very
high support values. Thus, this additional analysis over all
supports the quartet puzzling analysis.
Protein structure supports the existence of two large
groups of Sp factors

It has been noted previously that the Sp proteins contain additional structural domains besides the zinc fingers and Btd box (e.g. [31]). A large portion of the

N-terminal end of the proteins is enriched for certain
amino acid residues. We have therefore compared the
composition of Sp proteins from human, sea anemone,
and selected arthropods (Fig. 2). The proteins of the
Sp1-4 clade are longer proteins characterized by a
(mostly) bipartite glutamine-rich region divided by a
region enriched mostly for serine and threonine. These
proteins form a well recognizable grouping that we call
Sp1-4 group. The structure of the Sp1-4 group is clearly

different from the Sp proteins of the Sp5/Btd and Sp6-9
clades (Fig. 2). These latter two clades contain shorter
proteins (on average), and are more similar to each
other than each is to the Sp1-4 group and we therefore
group the two clades together in a grouping that we call
Sp5-9/Btd group. The N-terminal end of these proteins
contains only a single long region enriched for serine
and/or proline. However, we note a trend in the Sp5/
Btd clade towards the accumulation of more proline,

in the phylogenetic sequence analysis (Sp1-4 clade, Sp5/Btd clade, Sp6-9 clade). All proteins are oriented with their amino-terminus (N) to the
left, and the carboxy-terminus (C) to the right. The length of each protein is given next to the C-terminus (number of amino acids), and the
name of the protein is given above the protein. Incomplete termini of proteins are indicated by dashed lines. Structural domains are indicated

whereas in the Sp6-9 clade there is a clear trend
towards accumulating serine and threonine in the Nterminal portion. Thus, the protein structure data also
support the existence of three different groups of Spfactors, but suggest that the Sp5/Btd clade and the Sp69 clade are more closely related.
Embryonic expression patterns of insect and crustacean
Sp genes

All available data collectively and consistently suggest
that a small Sp gene cluster comprising three Sp genes

is ancestral in the Metazoa and that the triplets present
in the insects derive from these ancestral three genes,
i.e. the genes in the respective clades are orthologous.
This argues against the alternative hypothesis that the
sets of three Sp genes in the different insect species originated by independent duplication events. As an additional test of the orthologous nature of the three Sp
genes in the different insect species we compared their
expression patterns during embryogenesis by in situ
hybridization. We reasoned that the genes of the same
clade should show similar expression patterns in all

Schaeper et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/88

species if they were true orthologs, but show different
patterns if they originated through unrelated duplication
events. In the following we compare the expression data
from insects, the crustacean P. hawaiensis and published
data from vertebrates arranged according to the three
Sp-gene clades.
The genes of the Sp1-4 clade

CG5669, which is the D. melanogaster representative of
this clade, is maternally contributed (Fig. 3a) and then
expressed ubiquitously throughout development (Fig. 3b,
c). In T. castaneum the Sp1-4 gene (in [32] previously
termed Tc-SP1234) is expressed ubiquitously throughout
development as well (Fig. 4a-c). The same is true for the
Sp1-4 gene of O. fasciatus (Fig. 5a-c), T. domestica (Fig.
6a-c) and F. candida (Fig. 7a, b). In the crustacean P.
hawaiensis the Sp1-4 gene is also expressed ubiquitously
throughout all studied developmental stages (Fig. 8a-c).

Page 6 of 18

The members of this clade from the mouse have not all
been studied as to their embryonic expression pattern,
but data are available for murine Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
[33-37]. All three genes are expressed ubiquitously during development. Taken together, these data show that
all analyzed members of this clade are expressed in a
similar ubiquitous fashion, strongly supporting the
orthology of the genes.
The genes of the Sp5/btd clade

The expression of btd (the D. melanogaster representative of the Sp5/btd clade) has been reported previously
[8,19]. The gene is first expressed in an anterior head
stripe (Fig. 3d) and a dorsal spot appears slightly later
(Fig. 3e). The head stripe is roughly located in the area
of the intercalary and mandibulary segment and later
abuts the cephalic furrow (Fig. 3f). Later a metameric
(segmentally repeated) pattern emerges that might be

correlated with segment formation and peripheral nervous system development (Fig. 3g-i) [8,20]. Furthermore,
Dm btd is expressed in the imaginal discs of legs and
antennae [8,38]. The expression of the T. castaneum btd
gene has been published before [32] and is very similar
to the D. melanogaster btd pattern: Tc-btd is expressed
in an early head stripe in the area of the intercalary and
mandibulary segment (Fig. 4d) and later a metameric
pattern emerges (Fig. 4e). In older stages the gene is
also expressed in the appendages and in the nervous
system (Fig. 4f). The expression pattern of Sp5/btd in T.
domestica is very similar to the T. castaneum btd pattern. In the early blastoderm the gene is expressed in an
anterior stripe (Fig. 6d), that lies in the intercalary/mandibulary area in slightly more advanced germ band stage
embryos (Fig. 6e). Later a metameric pattern emerges
(Fig. 6f, g) and in older stages expression in the nervous
system and, weakly, in the appendages is detected (Fig.
6 h). In F. candida we were not able to detect an early
head stripe for Sp5/btd, because our fixation protocol
did not allow us to fix blastoderm stages of this species.
The later expression pattern of Sp5/btd in F. candida is
very similar to the other insects: there is a metameric
expression (Fig. 7c, d), a weak expression in the appendages (Fig. 7d), and expression in the nervous system
(Fig. 7e).
There are 3 genes related to Sp5 in the zebrafish genome. Sp5 (also known as bts1) [25], Sp5-like (also

known as spr2) [39] and similar-to-Sp5. Sp5 in zebrafish
is expressed in a head stripe along the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, in the otic vesicles, diencephalon, tail
bud, and in the somites [25]. Zebrafish Sp5-like expression is partially overlapping the Sp5 expression in ectodermal and mesodermal tissue, the brain, trunk neural
crest cells, and somites [39]. Mouse Sp5 is also
expressed in a head stripe at the midbrain-hindbrain
boundary, in the primitive streak, and later in the tail
bud, otic vesicles, limb buds, the developing central nervous system, somites and pharyngeal region [12,40]. In
summary, the expression of the genes in this clade are
highly similar in the insects and clear similarities also
exist to the expression in the vertebrates. This again
supports the orthology of the genes in this clade.
The genes of the Sp6-8 clade

The expression of D-Sp1 (the D. melanogaster representative of the Sp6-9 clade) has been published previously
[8,20]. The gene is maternally contributed (Fig. 3j), and
earliest embryonic expression is seen in the brain (Fig.
3k, l). Later, strong expression is seen in the limb primordia of the antennae and legs (Fig. 3m, n) and in a
punctate pattern in the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 3o). The
expression of the T. castaneum Sp8 gene has been
reported earlier [24]. Like the D. melanogaster D-Sp1
gene, the T. castaneum Sp8 gene is expressed in the
brain, ventral nerve cord, and the limb buds (Fig. 4g, h).
In the growing legs the gene is expressed in a pattern

comprising several rings (Fig. 4h) [24]. The gene Sp8/9
from O. fasciatus has been published recently [41]. Sp8/
9 is expressed in the brain, in a punctate pattern in the
ventral nerve cord and in the limbs (Fig. 5d). Similar to
the legs in older T. castaneum embryos, the O. fasciatus
Sp8/9 gene is expressed in several rings in the legs (Fig.
5e). The Sp6-9 gene from T. domestica is expressed in
the limb buds (Fig. 6i, j) and later in at least two rings
in the legs (Fig. 6k, l). In young segments that have just
separated from the growth zone there is a stripe of
Sp6-9 expression and in older segments the gene is
expressed in a punctate pattern in the ventral nerve
cord. There is also an expression domain in the brain.
In the springtail F. candida the Sp6-9 gene is expressed
in the brain and in a punctate pattern in the ventral
nervous system (Fig. 7f-h). The gene is also expressed in
the limb buds (Fig. 7f-h) and at later stages in two separate rings in the legs (Fig. 7i). These data show that the
embryonic expression pattern of the Sp6-9 representatives is very similar in all studied insect species. These
similarities extend to the crustaceans as shown by Sp6-9

expression in P. hawaiensis. In this species the gene is
expressed in the limb buds (Fig. 8d, e) and at later
stages in the peraeopods and in the two branches of the
pleopods and the first two pairs of uropods (Fig. 8f). In
addition, there is a punctate expression pattern in the
ventral nerve cord (Fig. 8f).
Expression data for the members of this clade are also
available from vertebrates. Intitial RT-PCR analysis of
mouse Sp6 expression suggested expression in all tissues
studied [42], but later studies showed a specific expression pattern in hair follicles and the apical ectodermal
ridge (AER) of the developing limbs [15,43]. Consequently, Sp6 null mice are nude and show defects in
skin, teeth, limbs (syndactyly and oligodactyly), and lung
alveols. Sp7 (also known as osterix) is so far only documented to be expressed in the osteoblasts. Bone formation fails in Sp7 deficient mice due to impaired
osteoblast differentiation [44-46]. Apart from expression
domains in the nervous system (brain) both Sp8 and
Sp9 are predominantly expressed in the AER of the
limbs in mouse, chick and zebrafish and are essential

for limb and fin outgrowth [13,14,47,48]. In summary,
the expression patterns of the genes in this clade are
strikingly similar in the insects and crustaceans and very
similar expression patterns also exist from some vertebrate representatives of this clade, again supporting the
orthology of the genes in this clade.
Summarizing the available gene expression data it is
evident that the gene expression profiles of the arthropod
and vertebrate members within each clade are very similar. This lends further support to our notion that the Spfamily genes in the Metazoa fall into three monophyletic
clades that each derives from a single ancestral gene
from a cluster comprising three genes. The ubiquitous
pattern of the Sp1-4 genes separates them from the Sp5/
btd and Sp6-9 genes that display more complex expression patterns frequently comprising at least domains in
the nervous system, limbs and segments. This observation fully agrees with our analysis of protein structure
that also suggests that the Sp5/btd clade and the Sp6-9
clade form a larger grouping (the Sp5-9 group).

Chromosomal location of Sp genes suggest an
ancestral triplet

We have also established the location of the Sp-family
genes in the genomes of fully sequenced and sufficiently
annotated metazoan species; a schematic overview is
shown in Fig. 9 and the exact locations are given in
Additional File 2. Intriguingly, in the basal metazoan N.
vectensis all three Sp-family genes are located next to
each other on a single scaffold (scaffold 53). This situation is fully compatible with the notion that a triplet
consisting of one Sp1-4, one Sp5/Btd, and one Sp6-9
gene is ancestral in the Metazoa. The close proximity of
the genes on a single scaffold suggests that the Sp-family
genes form a gene cluster of closely related genes
evolved by tandem gene duplication similar to the genes
in the Hox gene cluster. Ryan et al. [49] and Putnam
et al. [50] have used the scaffold data of N. vectensis
to reconstruct ancestral metazoan linkage groups (a
kind of “ur-chromosomes”). Interestingly, the Sp cluster
of N. vectensis is located next to the majority of the

N. vectensis Hox genes on the hypothetical ancestral
linkage group PAL A (Fig. 9, top) [50]. Only the two
Hox genes on scaffold 4 are not included in the PAL A.
This suggests that the Sp gene cluster and the Hox gene
cluster were ancestrally located next to each other and
might have conserved their close linkage in Cnidaria
and vertebrates, and to a lesser extent in arthropods
(Fig. 9). The Sp genes are located close to the Hox gene
cluster in other animals as well (see also [31,51]. Intriguingly, in humans, a triplet of one Sp1-4, one Sp5/btd,
and one Sp6-9 gene, namely Sp3, Sp5, and Sp9, is linked
to the Hox D cluster and the remaining human Sp
genes are arranged in duplets of one Sp1-4 and one
Sp6-9 gene, which are linked to the remaining 3 Hox
clusters, respectively (Fig. 9, center). In D. melanogaster
and A. gambiae only the Sp6-9 clade gene is linked to
the Hox gene cluster, while the remaining two genes are
located close to each other on the X chromosome (Fig.
9, bottom). These two genes are also located close to
each other on another chromosome than the Hox gene
cluster in A. mellifera, T. castaneum and the crustacean
D. pulex. In addition, the Sp1-4 gene representative is
also not linked to the Hox cluster, although this is not
fully established for A. mellifera and T. castaneum,
because the Sp1-4 gene is annotated within unassembled
reads not placed to the assembled chromosome. The
genomes of S. purpuratus, B. floridae and T. adhaerens
are not assembled to the chromosome or linkage group
level, but preliminary analysis provided additional evidence for Sp-family gene clustering in these species as
well. In S. purpuratus the Sp1-4 and Sp5/btd genes are
located on the same scaffold. In both B. floridae (see
also [52]) and T. adhaerens the Sp5/Btd and Sp6-9
genes are located on the same scaffold (see also [53]).
Whether the Sp-family genes are also linked to the Hox
genes in S. purpuratus (see [54]), B. floridae (see
[55,56]), or T. adhaerens (see [57]) has to await the full
assembly of the scaffolds.

Conclusions
All available data suggest that a set of three Sp-family
genes comprising one Sp1-4 gene, one Sp5/btd, and one
Sp6-9 gene, is ancestral in the Metazoa (Fig. 10). No
data are yet available from the most basal metazoan
group, the Porifera (sponges), but at least two Sp-family
genes are linked in the basal metazoan T. adhaerens.
This can serve as evidence that the Sp-family triplet
formed a small gene cluster already in the basal
metazoan (Fig. 10, “metazoan grade”), but it is unclear
whether this Sp gene cluster was initially linked to the
Hox gene cluster. It is still debated whether T. adhaerens has any true Hox genes since it has only one Hoxlike gene (Trox-2) along with one further, very derived
gene with potential Hox-like affinities [57,58]. But it is

Page 12 of 18

yet unclear whether the single T. adhaerens Hox-like
gene is physically close to the Sp-family genes.
The eumetazoan ancestor already possessed a triplet
cluster of Sp-family genes (Fig. 10, “eumetazoa grade”)
as evidenced by the three closely linked Sp genes in the
genome of the sea anemone N. vectensis. This cnidarian
species has eight Hox genes. It is debated whether the
Cnidaria represent a grade before or after the formation
of a true Hox gene cluster, but recent analyses strongly
suggest that the ancestral Cnidarian had indeed a genuine Hox gene cluster comprising at least one anterior
and one posterior Hox gene [49,59]. This cluster apparently has broken apart during cnidarian evolution leading to the dispersed set of 8 Hox genes in N. vectensis
[49]. None of these Hox genes in N. vectensis is on the
scaffold that contains the Sp genes, but comparative
genomics studies suggest that the four clustered Hox
genes and the Sp gene cluster are located next to each
other on the so called “PAL A” linkage group [50].
Thus, the Eumetazoa ancestor likely possessed a Sp
gene cluster linked to the primordial Hox gene cluster
(Fig. 10, “eumetazoan grade”).
In the Bilateria the Hox cluster underwent further elaboration by gene duplications, whereas the nearby Sp
gene cluster preserved the ancestral number of three
genes. Nevertheless, the evolution of the Hox cluster
also had an impact on the evolution of the Sp cluster in
different ways in different bilaterian lineages. In the
insects for example, the Sp gene cluster became partially
independent from the Hox gene cluster by the relocation of the Sp5/btd and the Sp6-9 genes (Fig. 10, top
right). In the dipterans the Sp1-4 gene is still linked to
the Hox gene cluster, but in other insects (and in the
crustacean D. pulex) the Sp1-4 gene appears to have
become detached from the Hox gene cluster as well. In
the vertebrates, the Hox gene cluster was duplicated
several times leading to a total set of four Hox gene
clusters in tetrapods [60], and the nearby Sp gene cluster evidently was duplicated along with the Hox gene
cluster (Fig. 10, top left). Additional partial genome
duplications have occurred in the teleost fishes [61,62]
likely accounting for the additional Sp genes (e.g. in D.
rerio and F. rubripes). In summary, our results show
that the btd gene did not originate from a recent gene
duplication, but traces back to an ancient Sp5/Btd gene
already present in basal metazoans.

Figure 10 Evolution and orthology of the Sp genes in the Metazoa. The ancestral state in the Metazoa (metazoan grade) is hypothesized to
have been a cluster of three Sp genes (one of each clade, color coded as in Fig. 9) linked to a single Hox gene (small red box; no Hox cluster is
present yet). This is consistent with the data from T. adhaerens. Linkage data for the Sp1-4 gene, however, are missing and the nature of Trox2
gene is debated (indicated by the dashed lines and the question mark). In addition, data from the most basal metazoan group, the Porifera, are
not yet available. The Sp gene cluster is conserved in the Eumetazoa (eumetazoan grade) and is linked to the Hox cluster. This is consistent with
data from N. vectensis, and is further supported by comparative genomics [50]. Further evolution in the Vertebrata lineage lead to the
multiplication of the Sp gene cluster along with the Hox gene cluster. The number of Sp gene clusters, their chromosomal location and Sp gene
complement is fully compatible with the sequence (D(A(C, B))) of vertebrate Hox gene cluster duplication proposed by Bailey et al. [88]. We
propose that the ancestral Sp gene cluster was duplicated, the duplicate lost the Sp5/btd gene, and this reduced cluster served as template for
two additional Hox/Sp duplications. In the Insecta lineage the ancestral linkage of the Sp cluster with the Hox cluster was partially disbanded by
the relocation of the Sp5/btd and Sp6-9 genes.

T. domestica (firebrat) were cultured as described in
Rogers et al. [66] with some modifications: Firebrats were
kept in plastic containers in an incubator at 36°C and fed
with oatmeal. For better handling especially of very
young embryos during the dissection procedure, firebrat
eggs were first boiled for 1 min in a waterbath and cooled
on ice for 1 min. Afterwards, embryos were fixed for 1 h
in fixative (4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline
and 0,1% Tween-20). Embryos were stained with SYTOX
Green nucleic acid stain and dissected as described for O.
fasciatus [65]. F. candida (white springtail) were raised at
room temperature in plastic containers with a thin layer
of plaster mixed with charcoal. Springtail embryos from
0-5 days were collected with a fine brush and put into a
1,5 ml reaction tube filled with 500 μl water. Embryos
were boiled for 1 min in a waterbath, cooled on ice for
1 min, then put into a 50 μm mesh net and treated with
50% bleach for 6 min. Afterwards, embryos were washed
with water and put into 100% Methanol. These embryos
were then sonicated for 45 sec in Methanol, vortexed several times and stored at -20°C until use. P. hawaiensis

(amphipod beachhopper) were cultured in shallow plastic
boxes at 26°C filled with a thin layer of crushed coral
substrate and artificial seawater (30 g/l of synthetic sea
salt) and fed with dry fish flakes twice a week. Membrane
pumps ventilated the water. Gravid amphipod females
were anaesthesized with clove oil (10 μl per 50 ml seawater) and embryos were collected out of the brood
prouch with forceps. Dissection and fixation was performed as described in Browne et al. [67].
Gene cloning and sequence analysis

D. melanogaster embryos from 0-20 h, T. castaneum
embryos from 0-72 h, O. fasciatus embryos from 0-96 h,
T. domestica and F. candida embryos from 0-5 days,

were used for mRNA isolation using the MicroPoly(A)
Purist kit (Ambion). Double-stranded (ds) cDNA and
RACE template synthesis was performed using the
SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis kit and SMART RACE

Additional file 3: Sequence information about the gene specific
primers used in this study. The first column gives the species and the
gene. The second column gives the primer sequences in 5’ to 3’
orientation. The third column gives the length of the cloned fragment
resulting from the PCR with the given primers. The fourth column gives
the clone ID number. The fifth column gives the polymerase used to
transcribe the RNA probe used for in situ hybridizations. The primers for
D. melanogaster and T. castaneum have been designed as gene specific
pairs using the genome sequence information. For O. fasciatus, T.
domestica, F. candida, and P. hawaiensis we first isolated a small fragment
of the genes using degenerate primers specified in the Materials and
methods section. The gene specific RACE primers were designed on the
basis of this sequence information and were used in conjunction with
the commercial RACE adaptor primers. The cloned fragment of Ph Sp6-9
resulted from priming of the given primer pair. Abbreviations: Fwd,
forward; Rev, reverse.
