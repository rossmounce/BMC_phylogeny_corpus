Abstract
Background: The availability of complete genome sequences of versatile Pseudomonas occupying
remarkably diverse ecological niches enabled to gain insights into their adaptative assets. The
objective of this study was to analyze the complete genetic repertoires of metal transporters (metal
transportomes) from four representative Pseudomonas species and to identify metal transporters
with "Genomic Island" associated features.
Methods: A comparative metal transporter inventory was built for the following four Pseudomonas
species: P.putida (Ppu) KT2440, P.aeruginosa (Pae) PA01, P.fluorescens (Pfl) Pf-5 and P.syringae
(Psy)pv.tomato DC3000 using TIGR-CMR and Transport DB. Genomic analysis of essential and toxic
metal ion transporters was accomplished from the above inventory. Metal transporters with
"Genomic Island" associated features were identified using Islandpath analysis.
Results: Dataset cataloguing has been executed for 262 metal transporters from the four spp.
Additional metal ion transporters belonging to NiCoT, Ca P-type ATPase, Cu P-type ATPases, ZIP
and MgtC families were identified. In Psy DC3000, 48% of metal transporters showed strong GI
features while it was 45% in Ppu KT2440. In Pfl Pf-5 and Pae PA01 only 26% of their metal
transporters exhibited GI features.
Conclusion: Our comparative inventory of 262 metal transporters from four versatile
Pseudomonas spp is the complete suite of metal transportomes analysed till date in a prokaryotic
genus. This study identified differences in the basic composition of metal transportomes from
Pseudomonas occupying diverse ecological niches and also elucidated their novel features. Based on
this inventory we analysed the role of horizontal gene transfer in expansion and variability of metal
transporter families.

Findings
Background
Metal ions play a variety of critical roles in the prokaryotic
metabolism. Biological management of metal ions is

accomplished by a complex interplay between metal ion
transporters (transmembrane importers, transmembrane
exporters) and their regulatory components [1]. In the
post-genomic era, genetic landscapes of the organisms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/88

have unveiled the hidden facets of metal ion transporters
and associated regulatory cascade thereby paving way for
study of their metal transportomes.
The genus Pseudomonas is one of the most versatile and
ecologically significant groups of bacteria on the planet
that thrives well in metal rich biotopes. In recent studies,
the unexpected capacity of Ppu KT2440 and Ppu CD2
genomes to endure exposure to heavy metals has been
unraveled [2,3]. In Ppu KT2440 metal transporters
acquired through HGT were also reported [4]. However, a
systematic study of complete metal transportomes is unavailable for any of these Pseudomonas species. The availability of complete genome sequences for saprophytic
P.putida (Ppu) KT2440, commensalistic P.fluorescens (Pfl)
Pf-5, pathogenic P.aeruginosa (Pae) PA01 and P.syringae
pv. tomato (Psy) DC3000 [5-8] provided an opportunity
for analyzing their complete repertoire of metal transporters along with the role of HGT in their acquisition.

Methods
Compilation of metal transporter inventory
The genome sequence information of the four sequenced
Pseudomonas spp Ppu KT2440, Pae PA01, Pfl Pf-5 and Psy
DC3000 employed in this study were selected from TIGRCMR database [9]. TransportDB, a relational database
describing the predicted cytoplasmic membrane transport
protein complement for organisms was used as a substrate
for building the metal transportomes [10]. In order to
search for homologs of a transporter family the best-annotated hit was used in a subsequent BLASTP search against
the four genomes and retrieved the members. PFAM
domain search was also carried out with the retrieved
homologs, using CLC HMM algorithm [11] and PFAM
database [12]. Transmembrane helix prediction for the
membrane transporters was performed using TMHMM
version 2.0 [13]. Genomic location and gene organization
of transporters were identified from TIGR-CMR database.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the characterised prototypes using CLC protein workbench [11]. For
this analysis, multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were
produced using progressive alignment algorithm. The
generated pair wise alignments were used for finding the
evolutionary distance between the pairs. Pair wise distances thus calculated was used to create a phylogenetic
tree-employing neighbour joining (NJ) algorithm with
1000 bootstrap replicates.
Sequence Clusters
Metal transporters located in sequence clusters, were identified by cluster viewer from PEDANT database [14]. Cluster viewer aided us in identifying clusters of genes in the
same organism that are paralogs. Sequence clusters thus
obtained provided us with data regarding the metal transporters that have a BLAST similarity score greater than 45
bits in PSI-BLAST and also possess a similar Pfam domain
with a significant E-value (typically 0.001). This tool
helped us in determining paralogous genes of a family
and aided in phylogenetic analyses.
Island Path Analysis
Island Path Analysis was used for the detection of metal
transporters acquired through HGT [15]. After generating
the complete inventory of metal transporters, we
inspected the genomes of four Pseudomonas species with
island path software (IPA version 1.0 tool) for the identification of those transporters located in GI's or exhibiting
GI associated features like anomalous %G+C, dinucleotide bias above 1 STD DEV, presence of RNA genes
(tRNA, rRNA genes) and mobility genes (transposons,
insertion sequences). A putative GI can be identified with
certainty by the presence of eight or more consecutive
ORF's with dinucleotide bias alone or dinucleotide bias
plus a mobility gene in proximity.

Results and discussion
Protein sequence analysis
CLC protein workbench has been employed to analyse
the metal transporter proteins [11]. Genchek™ Graphical
Viewer was used to represent GTPase signature motifs G1G5 in the alignment generated for FeoBEco and FeoBPae.

From genome to metal transportome in Pseudomonas
Based on the global features of the four Pseudomonas
genomes we could draw a comparison among the genome
size, number of genes, transporter proteins and total
number of metal transporters (Table 1). Among the four
spp, Pfl has the largest metal transporter inventory (75

metal ion transporters) while Psy has the smallest (54
metal ion transporters). Other pathogenic species, Pae has
more number of genes and transporter proteins but relatively less metal transporters (63 metal ion transporters)
than Ppu (70 metal ion transporters).
Based on the TransportDB [10] we compiled the metal
transportomes for the entire complement of alkali/alkaline earth metals (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), transition metals
(Zn2+, Mn2+ Cu+, Ag+, Mo2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+) and
heavy metals (Cr3+, As3+, Pb2+, Cd2+) in Pseudomonas
(Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4). These transportomes furnish
information for class/family/subfamily, transporter classification number (T.C.No), TIGR locus, protein name,
genomic location, orientation, length of the protein,
TMD's, substrate and the predicted role of the above metal
transporters. Sequence cluster analysis helped in identifying paralogs for the transporter families (see Additional
file 5). In this study we employed the Transporter Classification system-TC system for systematic classification of
Pseudomonas metal transporters into the following four
groups: ATP-dependent (ABC superfamily, P-type ATPase
super family) Ion-channels, Secondary transporters and
Unclassified. A comparative analysis depicting the basic
differences in the composition of transporter classes and
metal transporter families from the four Pseudomonas species is represented in Table 2 (This table also provides
expanded names of the transporter families).
Salient Features of Pseudomonas metal transportomes
Apart from executing the dataset cataloguing, our analysis
of Pseudomonas databases identified additional metal
transporters belonging to Ca, ZIP, NiCoT, MgtC, ABC
(copper), P-type ATPase (copper) families. Distinct features of transporters belonging to CPA3, CaCA, ZnuABC,
MntABC, ZntA, Nramp, FeOB, OFeT, NikABC, Chr, PbrT,
RND, CDF families and ABC super family were also
reported.

Search for primary ATP-dependent calcium pumps in
Pseudomonas using two characterized members (SP1551
and SP1623) of S.pneumoniae [16] identified a Ca P-type
ATPase (PA1429) in Pae alone with no reciprocal BLAST
hits from other three species.
ZIP family of transporters in Pseudomonas were retrieved
using the experimentally characterized transporter ZupTEco [17]. Psy and Pae have single entities PA4467 and
PSPTO_2053 while paralog expansion is seen for Ppu
(PP_1836, PP_0947) and Pfl (PFL_4718, PFL_0910).
Using the experimentally characterized efflux member
RcnAEco of NiCoT subfamily 2 [18] as a BLAST query
against Pseudomonas databases, we identified two new

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/88

efflux members PP_2968 (RcnAPpu) and PSPTO_4280
(RcnAPsy).
The experimentally characterized MgtC family transporter
Pae (PA4635) [19] was used in the BLAST P analysis to
identify the following MgtC homologs: PP_3244,
PP_3541 (Ppu), PFL_4077, PFL_2871 (Pfl), PA4635 (Pae).
No hits were identified for this family in Psy.
Pae uniquely harbours an ABC copper transporter PA3393
that is related to periplasmic copper binding protein
NosD in Rhizobium meliloti whose function was presumed
to insert copper into the exported reductase apoenzyme
(NosZ) [20]. All the CuPATP1 transporters of Pseudomonas
(PFL_0710, PP_0586, PA3920, PSPTO_0750) were found
to be the best BLAST hits for experimentally characterized
CopAEhi, while the other group of CuPATP2 transporters
(PP_4261, PA1549, PFL_1915, PSPTO_1996) did not
show significant BLAST identities with the characterized
proteins of CopA, CopB.
CPA3 family members constituting multicomponent K+
efflux system are present in all the three species except in
Pae where this component is involved in sodium ion
homeostasis. Ppu (PP_2225 to PP_2230) and Pfl Pf-5
(PFL_2606 to PFL_2611) have six component K+ efflux
systems while it is a five-component system in Psy.
CaCA transporters i.e. secondary calcium transporters in
Pfl and Psy (PFL_0722 and PSPTO_0764) are annotated as
Ca2+/H+ (ChaA) antiporters that exhibit significant
homology to ChaA of E.coli [21]. Proteins resembling
mammalian Na2+/Ca2+exchangers (YrbG) [22] are present
in Ppu (PP_0928), Pfl Pf-5 (PFL_0891) and Psy
(PSPTO_4477). Pae PA01 lacks a distinct homologue for
CaCA transporter. Representative Zinc transporters of
Pseudomonas species are presented in table 3. ABC zinc
transporters (ZnuABC) that recognize Zn2+ as their substrate and ABC manganese transporters (MntABC) that
recognize Mn2+/Zn2+, were included in the phylogenetic
profiling to study their overlapping specificities (Figure
1). Search for ZntA homologs in the Pseudomonas
genomes using experimentally characterized ZntAEco [23]
resulted in identification of CadA as the closest homologue with 37% identity from all the four species. However in Pseudomonas, only CadA proteins with five
(PFL_5892, PSPTO_5279, PA3690) or six TMD's
(PP_0041, PP_5139, PA2435) were identical to ZntA. The
other CadA proteins with seven TMD's (PFL_6191,
PSPTO_5532) did not show any significant identity in
BLAST analysis (less than 24% identity) and appear to be
unrelated to ZntA.
Only one Nramp member, MntH (PFL_2262) was
observed for Pfl while Pae has two members MntH1

three distinct members MntH1 (PSPTO_2464), MntH2
(PSPTO_2499) and MntH3 (PSPTO_5377) in this family.
No conserved motifs characteristic for Nramp super family were observed for PSPTO_5377. However, phylogenetic analysis with Nramp family members confirmed its
position in this family (Figure 2). Analysis of Lineage Specific Regions (greater than 2 Kb, enriched in mobile
genetic elements and has genes specific to Psy DC3000) of
Psy showed that PSPTO_5377 is the only metal transporter located in its LSR's (LSR no: 42).
Three types of iron transporters (ABC, FeOB and OFeT)
were found in the Pseudomonas species with the restriction
of FeOB transporter (PA4358) to Pae and OFeT transporter (PFL_3255) to Pfl (Figure 3). Based on the previous
reports of GTPase motifs in FeoBEco [24] highly conserved
G1-G5 GTPase motifs were present in FeoBPae (Figure 3).
In OFeTPfl two REXXE motifs (10REGIE14, 129REGLE133)
were identified basing on the characterised prototype YcdNEco [25]. No iron transporters were reported for pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum while we
reported substantial number of iron transporters for the
pathogenic Pae and Psy (six and four respectively).
In Ppu and Psy there are high affinity nickel uptake systems
(Nik) of ABC family whose PBP's (PP_3342 and
PSPTO_3088) belong to nickel/peptide/opine ABC transporter family. Two IMP's were identified for each of the
two Nik systems, in NikPpu (PP_3343, PP_3344) and

NikPsy (PSPTO_3089, PSPTO_3090). They displayed a
characteristic
transmembrane
topology
of
five
(PSPTO_3089, PP_3344) and six TMD's (PSPTO_3090,
PP_3343).
Chromate transporters of Chr family mediating chromate
resistance are present in all the three Pseudomonas species
(PP_2556, PA4289, PFL_3149) except Psy. PbrT members
conferring lead resistance are also present in all the four
Pseudomonas species (PA5248, PFL_5990, PP_0180). As
an exception Psy possess two PbrT systems, PbrT1 and
PbrT2 (PSPTO_0141, PSPTO_3596). PbrT2Psy did not
show the conserved motifs found in other lead transporters of this group. Uniquely there is one ABC family member for Pb in Ppu (PP_5165) with no existing sequence
homology to PbrTPpu.
The best-characterized heavy metal resistant strains R.metallidurans have eight HME-RND proteins on chromosome. In comparison, Ppu has six RND chromosomal
determinants (PP_0043, PP_2410, PP_3302, PP_5173,
PP_1517, PP_5387), Pfl and Pae have two determinants
each (PFL_2558, PFL_5218 PA0158, PA2520) while no
RND determinant was identified in Psy. Pfl Pf-5 has a maximum of four CDF transporters (PFL_2508, PFL_5419,
PFL_0604, PFL_5222) while they are three in Pae PA01
(PA0397, PA1297, PA3963) and two in Ppu KT2440
(PP_0026, PP_4774). However Psy DC3000 has only one
distinct ortholog (PSPTO_4790) in this family.

All the four Pseudomonas species were found to possess
paralogs for PBP's of ABC Zn2+ and Mn2+ transporters. Psy
alone has paralogs for PBP of ABC Mo2+ transporter.
Ppu has two paralogs for CitMHS family, which are presumed to facilitate transport of Citrate-Mn2+ complex
while in Pfl this family has three paralogs with specificity
for Mg2+/citrate.
All the four Pseudomonas species have paralogs for MIT
family and P-type ATPases. Except for Psy all the three species possessed paralogs for RND and CDF families.
Psy and Pfl have paralogs for ILT family, mediating lead
transport alone in the former while both ferrous iron and
lead transport are mediated in the later.

Analysis of ABC super family members from the above
inventory unravelled a distinct transmembrane topology
for their integral membrane proteins (IMP's) that varied
with the metal ion specificity of their associated PBP's.
Accordingly, five/six TMD's were observed for nickel
transporters, twelve for iron transporters, seven for zinc,
eight for manganese and five for molybdenum
Multiplicity of paralogs in metal transporter families
Pseudomonas species has multiple paralogs for most of the
metal ion transporters that are briefed out in Additional
table 5. Some of the significant features of paralog distribution are highlighted in this section.

Sodium ion transporters constitute the bulk of secondary
transporters and has maximum number of paralogs distributed in different families (Table 4).
A multitude of K+ transporters are present in Pseudomonas
species among which Kdp system (in Pfl), VIC super family (in Pae and Psy), CPA2 family (in Ppu, Pae, Pfl, Psy) and
Trk family (in Ppu) possessed paralogs.

In Ppu ArsB family has two paralogs that are part of separate arsRBCH operons while in Pfl out of the two paralogs
(PFL_2185, PFL_3288) only former is located within an
arsRBCH operon.
Horizontal Gene Transfer: a source of gene innovation in
metal transportomes
In view of the mosaic nature of genomes of the Pseudomonas spp we identified metal transporters with GI
associated features from our inventory (see Additional
files 6, 7, 8, 9). In our analysis we identified three distinct
categories of transporters: those with anomalous composition (%G+C) alone, anomalous composition plus other
GI associated features, normal %G+C plus GI associated
features (Additional files 6, 7, 8 and 9). We identified
thirty-two transporters (45.71%) in Ppu possessing highly
significant GI features while they were twenty-six
(48.10%) in Psy, nineteen (26%) in Pfl and seventeen
(26%) in Pae.

Families with strong GI features that were present
uniquely in a species were: CPA3 family (sodium ion
homeostasis), ABC family (Cu transporter), P-type ATPase
(Cu transporter) in Pae, NhaB family, NiCoT family in
Ppu, NSS, MScS and CitMHS families in Psy. ABC transporter for Molybdenum was found to have GI features in
the three Pseudomonas except for Pfl. Strong GI features
were observed only for certain paralogs of metal transporter families indicating that paralog expansion could
have occurred through HGT (Additional 10). These results
show how different metal transporter families vary in
their propensity for HGT among the four spp.

Conclusion
In this article we performed a dataset cataloging for 262

tant insights into the fundamental molecular aspects and
novel facets of Pseudomonas metal transportomes.
Our comparative inventory identified and analyzed novel
metal transporters belonging to the following families:
NiCoT (PP_2968, PSPTO_4280), Ca P-type ATPase
(PA1429), Cu P-type ATPases (PP_4261, PA1549), ZIP
(PP_1836, PP_0947, PFL_4718, PFL_0910, and
PSPTO_2053) and MgtC (PP_3244, PP_3541, PA4635,
PFL_4077, PFL_2871).
Psy possessing least number of metal transporters showed
maximum percentage (48%) of transporters with strong
GI features. Our data is substantiated by the previous
observations where majority of Psy ORF's shared features
with horizontally transferred genes [26]. Ppu has 45% of
its transporters possessing strong GI features. On the contrary, Pfl and Pae have only 26% of their metal transporters exhibiting GI features.
This comparative inventory can therefore provide a window for Pseudomonas community in mining large and heterogeneous data sets obtained from metagenome projects
to identify new biologically relevant patterns of metal
transporters resembling those in this study. A combinatorial approach of transcriptomics and functional genomics
will aid in deducing the functions of these diverse metal
transporters and assembling a complete picture of metal
homeostasis.
