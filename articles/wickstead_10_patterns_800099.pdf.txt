Patterns of kinesin evolution reveal a complex
ancestral eukaryote with a multifunctional
cytoskeleton
Research article

Abstract
Background: The genesis of the eukaryotes was a pivotal event in evolution and was accompanied by the acquisition
of numerous new cellular features including compartmentalization by cytoplasmic organelles, mitosis and meiosis, and
ciliary motility. Essential for the development of these features was the tubulin cytoskeleton and associated motors. It is
therefore possible to map ancient cell evolution by reconstructing the evolutionary history of motor proteins. Here, we
have used the kinesin motor repertoire of 45 extant eukaryotes to infer the ancestral state of this superfamily in the last
common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA).
Results: We bioinformatically identified 1624 putative kinesin proteins, determined their protein domain architectures
and calculated a comprehensive Bayesian phylogeny for the kinesin superfamily with statistical support. These data
enabled us to define 51 anciently-derived kinesin paralogs (including three new kinesin families) and 105 domain
architectures. We then mapped these characters across eukaryotes, accounting for secondary loss within established
eukaryotic groupings, and alternative tree topologies.
Conclusions: We show that a minimum of 11 kinesin families and 3 protein domain architectures were present in the
LCEA. This demonstrates that the microtubule-based cytoskeleton of the LCEA was surprisingly highly developed in
terms of kinesin motor types, but that domain architectures have been extensively modified during the diversification
of the eukaryotes. Our analysis provides molecular evidence for the existence of several key cellular functions in the
LCEA, and shows that a large proportion of motor family diversity and cellular complexity had already arisen in this
ancient cell.
Background
The transition from prokaryote to eukaryote was a hugely
important event in the evolutionary history of life and
provided the foundations for the evolution of numerous
complex organismal forms. Present day eukaryotes differ
fundamentally from prokaryotes in having much higher
complexity of cell organization. This complexity cannot
have appeared fully-formed, but arose by stepwise elaborations of cell structure - implying that certain lineages of
extant eukaryotes might have retained "simpler" ancestral
features (see [1,2]). However, the order and relative

importance of many of the acquisitions that must have
occurred to allow the cellular features now seen in extant
eukaryotes remain controversial. By comparing the
genomes of a wide taxonomic range of eukaryotes, and
including sufficient taxon sampling to account for secondary loss, we can reconstruct the likely genomic composition of the last common eukaryotic ancestor. In this
way, it is possible to reconstruct the ancestral repertoire
for some of the molecular components of key eukaryotic
features and identify evidence for intermediate states, if
they exist. This in turn helps us to understand the biology
of the ancestral eukaryote and how the prokaryoteeukaryote transition proceeded.
One of the key changes that enabled increased cellular
complexity in eukaryotes was the evolution of the
cytoskeleton - based ancestrally on actin filaments and
tubulin-based microtubules (intermediate filaments most

probably only appearing later in a specific lineage). This
network and its associated motors, plays an essential role
in several eukaryote-defining cellular processes, including division of genetic material at mitosis and meiosis,
inheritance of cytoplasmic organelles, intracellular transport of vesicles, and cellular motility based on either
crawling or beating of cilia/flagella. In keeping with this
central role, cytoskeletal motor proteins arose early in the
eukaryotic lineage [3-5]. Of the three superfamilies of
motors - kinesins, dyneins, and myosins - only the kinesins are ubiquitous to all eukaryotes thus far analyzed [69]. To shed light on the cellular complexity of the last
common eukaryotic ancestor, we analyzed the kinesin
motor protein superfamily using comparative genomics,
protein domain architecture analysis and the most comprehensive supported kinesin motor domain phylogeny
to date. From these data, we look at the evolution of the
kinesin superfamily across eukaryotes. We also reconstruct the kinesin repertoire of the LCEA and infer some
of the biological features of this ancestral cell.

Results and Discussion
Diversification of kinesin paralog families

To map the ancient evolutionary history of the kinesin
gene family we surveyed 45 eukaryotic organisms for
which complete or near-complete genome was publicly
available. These organisms represent a wide taxonomic
diversity of eukaryotes and encompass five of the six proposed eukaryotic 'supergroups' [10,11]. To survey for
kinesins, we used a hidden Markov model-based strategy
[12] using the Pfam kinesin motor domain model
(PF00225; see Material and Methods for details). This
approach identified 1624 encoded kinesin-like protein
sequences (Additional file 1). To improve phylogenetic
resolution and analysis speed we removed 166 sequences
with scores <100 (expectation value > 10-25), representing
the most divergent kinesin-like sequences. This threshold
is lower than used in previous work [8] and sufficiently
liberal to include all the previously identified kinesins
from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (including the divergent kinesin Smy1) - and
also include all kinesins from Drosophila melanogaster
except the atypical Cos2 (which may have no motor activity, binding to microtubules in an apparently ATP-independent manner [13]) and all but the very-highly
divergent VAB8 (klp5) from Caenorhabditis elegans. We
aligned the motor domains from these 1458 protein
sequences, trimmed the alignment to 330 well-conserved
characters and removed 195 near-identical sequences
(>95% identity). From this alignment we calculated a
Bayesian phylogeny by combining 8 independent runs of
MrBayes3.1.2 [14]. To evaluate support for the inferred
tree, we used two approximate Likelihood Ratio Test
(aLRT) methods [15,16]. These methods estimate sup-

port for each node by systematically measuring the ratio
of the likelihood of the given tree to an alternative topology in which that node has been collapsed (see Materials
and Methods). We considered as well-supported only
those tree topology nodes with p > 0.95 by both aLRT
methods. The identities of these well-supported nodes
are largely independent of the amino-acid substitution
matrix used in the test (see Material and Methods).
Additional file 2 contains a 1263-sequence Bayesian
phylogeny for the kinesin repertoires encoded by the 45
diverse eukaryotes. Each of the 14 kinesin families
defined previously by Wickstead and Gull [8] in a smaller
analysis of 19 genomes (i.e. Kinesin-1, 2, 3, 4/10, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) were also retrieved here with
strong topology support (>0.95 by both aLRT methods).
In addition, based on the criteria set out by Lawrence et
al. [17], our analysis supports the existence of three new
kinesin families, which we name Kinesin-18, 19, and 20 to follow on from previously identified families (Figure 1
and Additional file 2). Each of these new kinesin families
has strong support and a wide taxonomic distribution
amongst the eukaryotes sampled. As in previous work
[8], in this extensive phylogeny - which includes full kinesin repertoires from a broad range of eukaryotes - we find
no support for kinesin families -10, 11, or 12 [17].
Our phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for an
additional 14 paralog groups, which were not part of
kinesin families on our phylogenetic tree. Each of these
paralog groups was well supported, but none are considered bona-fide kinesin families at this stage, either
because they lacked sufficient membership (<1% of
sequences examined) or contained only sequences from
one eukaryotic supergroup. We designated these additional tentative paralog families X1-X14 (Figure 1 and
Additional file 2). Names, unique identifiers and kinesin
family/subfamily for all the 1624 identified kinesins in
this study can be found in Additional file 3.
By definition, each kinesin family is shared by at least
two eukaryotic supergroups [17] and is therefore most
likely anciently derived (although not necessarily ancestral). In addition to these families, our analysis shows that
there are multiple paralogs within at least 10 kinesin families (Kinesin-1, 2, 3, 4/10, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14 and 16; Figure 1)
that are most likely the products of additional ancient
gene duplication events. In keeping with the standardized
nomenclature of Lawrence et al. [17] we have identified
well-supported subfamilies by appending a letter to the
family name (e.g. Kinesin-9A and 9B). In this analysis we
have considered two levels of "ancient" paralogy: 1) wellsupported kinesin families shared by at least two eukaryotic supergroups, and also 2) subfamilies for which there
is evidence at least for the paralog being present at the
root of a major taxonomic group (with the exception of
Kinesin-2B, for which only the metazoan members form

Figure 1 Distribution of ancient kinesin paralogs in 45 diverse eukaryotes. Using the results of our comprehensive kinesin motor domain phylogeny (Additional file 2) we identified 51 kinesin paralogs, encompassing 17 kinesin families and 34 subfamilies. Presence of paralog(s) in a genome
is indicated by a filled circle, absence/not-found is indicated by an open circle. Only paralogs from well-supported nodes were considered (p > 0.95
by both aLRT methods; see Additional file 2). Dark blue circles indicate presence of members of a full kinesin family (corresponding to the deepest
well-supported nodes for kinesin groups containing sequences from eukaryotes belonging to more than one eukaryotic "supergroup"), whilst subfamily paralogs are indicated by light blue circles beneath (suffixed A, B, C etc.). Kinesins falling within a particular kinesin family, but outside of all the
contained well-supported subfamilies are suffixed '-X' (e.g. Kinesin-1-X). Groups of kinesins that do not have sufficient membership to be considered
full kinesin families (see Results and Discussion) are numbered X1 to X14 (green circles). Species analyzed are grouped into higher taxonomic groups.
Paralog families used in Dollo parsimony analyses are marked 'c' (character) adjacent to the first column.

a well-supported clade, but for which there is a probable
ortholog in Monosiga; see Additional file 2). All subfamilies have good topological support (p > 0.95 using both
aLRT methods, as above).
The identification within several kinesin families of
paralogs shared by multiple eukaryotic supergroups suggests that the use of family name alone does not accurately reflect the evolutionary (or functional) complexity
of the kinesin motor families. Our analysis suggests that
the evolutionary diversification of the kinesin gene family
has been extremely complicated, encompassing at least
51 ancient paralogs (Figure 1). The majority of these paralog forms arose from gene duplication events that at
least predate the major taxonomic units of eukaryotes
[10,11] and therefore most likely arose in an early phase
of eukaryotic evolution. It is worthy of note that our phylogeny (Additional file 2) also shows evidence of paralogs
in closely related organisms that are the result of relatively recent lineage-specific duplication events. These
paralogs are not the focus of this work and will not be discussed at length here, but they demonstrate that kinesin
diversification is not restricted to events very early in
eukaryotic evolution and gene duplication has generated
novel kinesin genes throughout the diversification of the
eukaryotes.
Diversification of kinesin protein architectures

Motor proteins are generally composed of a motor head
domain that converts chemical energy to force, and a
range of additional domains that bind cargo, filaments or
accessory proteins (e.g. [18,19]). Since regions outside of
the motor head domain direct many interactions, considerable functional diversification might be achieved
through the evolution of the protein domain combinations. To further investigate the diversification of the
kinesin superfamily, we identified putative domain architectures for all 1624 identified kinesin proteins using
Pfam and CDD database searches [20,21]. In total we
found 105 different kinesin protein domain architectures
(Additional file 4; domain architectures for all 1624 identified kinesins are available in Additional file 3). Surprisingly, most domain architectures were specific to only
one organism in our analysis, indicating that these
domain combinations were relatively recent acquisitions.
It is also noteworthy that most kinesins in our analysis
(1300/1624) possess no identifiable protein domains outside of the motor itself. This implies that the great majority of the interactions between these motors and other
proteins is controlled either by poorly conserved
stretches of peptide or protein domains that are not yet
described in protein domain databases.
Of the 105 kinesin domain architectures, 28 are found
in two or more genomes suggesting an origin predating
the last common ancestor of the species that possess this

specific domain architecture (the distribution of these is
shown in Figure 2). By annotating the motor domain phylogeny with the protein domain architectures (Additional
file 2) it is possible to identify cases where different architectural forms are the result of secondary loss of domains
(e.g. Kinesin-3D family KIF13B orthologs from human
and chicken lack the CAP_GLY domain). Accounting for
these secondary loss events, 21 protein domain architectures that were found in multiple genomes were specific
to a paralog or family on the kinesin phylogeny, suggesting that they represent derived character states (Additional file 5). However, in several cases the phylogeny
suggested that the similar protein domain architectures
occupied very distant branching positions in the kinesin
phylogeny, and were absent from all species that occupied
intermediate branches. We investigated this further by
comparing the results of Pfam and CDD searches and
aligning the relevant protein domains. In 7 cases we
found no convincing alignment between the domains
suggesting that these features are not homologous. These
domain architectures were therefore excluded from further analysis (Additional file 6; marked 'd(ex)' on Figure
2). In a further 4 cases, following the same principle, we
corrected the taxon distribution of a specific domain
architecture because the domain found connected to the
kinesin motor did not appear to be homologous to the
other protein sequences included in that architecture
type (Additional file 6; marked 'd/c' on Figure 2).
After the exclusion of unreliable and convergent kinesin architectures (Additional file 6), a total of 21 architectures were identified that potentially represent shared
derived characters. These 21 characters (see Additional
file 5; marked 'c' on Figure 2), were included in our analysis of kinesin protein evolution (below). Several of these
domain combinations are widely distributed among the
species analyzed, suggesting that the protein domain
architecture had an ancient ancestry within the eukaryotes and that shuffling of protein domains linked to the
kinesin motor has played an important role in the early
diversification of many kinesin protein families.
The kinesin repertoire of the last common eukaryotic
ancestor

To investigate the minimum complement of kinesin
forms present in the LCEA, we mapped the ancestral repertoire of kinesin characters under four alternative
eukaryotic evolutionary trees (Figure 3A-D). We coded
the presence and absence of kinesin families (marked 'c'
Figure 1) and reliable protein architectures (marked 'c'
and 'c/d' Figure 2) as binary characters. In both cases,
these selections included characters that were strongly
suggested to be monophyletic (see discussion above). To
further ameliorate patterns of secondary loss we coded
the presence and absence of kinesin paralogs and archi-

Figure 2 Distribution of kinesin protein architectures in 45 diverse eukaryotes. Pfam and CDD searches were used to identify putative gene architectures for the 1624 kinesin proteins identified in the genome datasets. All unique gene architectures identified in two or more genomes are
shown here while all 105 different gene architectures identified are shown in Additional file 4. Presence of a gene architecture in a genome is indicated
by a filled circle, absence/not-found is indicated by an open circle. Species analyzed are grouped into higher taxonomic units. Architectures used in
Dollo parsimony analyses are marked 'c' (character), while architectures, which appeared not to be homologous based on further investigation (see
Additional file 6), are marked 'd(ex)' (discounted and excluded), while this analysis adjusted the taxon distribution of some architecture characters
marked 'd/c' (discounted and corrected) adjacent to the first column. Domains found more than once are numbered to indicate the multiples in which
the domains are found (e.g. x2-7 indicates the protein contained between 2 and 7 copies of the domain).

tectures by combining the species data into 8 higher taxonomic groups (as marked on Figures 1 and 2). These
taxonomic groups are based upon those recovered in several multi-gene phylogenies [22-26], which have demonstrated a consensus higher level grouping of the
eukaryotes. At least 2 of the suggested supergroups
within eukaryotes (Excavata and Chromalveolata) remain
contentious [22]. To control for this we only used subgroupings within Excavata and Chromalveolata that are
currently strongly supported. The combination of paralogs and architectures produced a binary data matrix of 8
'taxa' and 39 characters. To further investigate the ancestral diversification of kinesin gene families we generated
an alternative character matrix based on 51 characters

produced from only the kinesin subfamily data. We used
a Dollo parsimony analysis method [27,28] to investigate
the possible branching order of the 8 higher taxonomic
units and the minimal ancestral repertoire of kinesin
characters present in the LCEA. Dollo parsimony
explains the presence of a state by allowing only one genesis event for a character, and as many losses as are necessary to explain the pattern of characters seen [27]. The
method makes the assumption that the ancestral state is
character absence and therefore generates a tree topology
that provides the minimum complement of kinesin types
present in the common ancestor of all 45 genomes sampled.

Figure 3 Defining the kinesin repertoire of the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA). We considered 5 rooted eukaryotic trees to infer conservative estimates of the minimal ancestral repertoire of kinesins present in the LCEA using Dollo parsimony: A) 'Metamonada-first'; B) 'Discicristatafirst'; C) 'Excavata-first'; D) root between unikonts and bikonts; E) Dollo most parsimonious tree necessary to explain the extant distribution (boxed in
red). The unconstrained most parsimonious tree gives an unrealistic eukaryotic tree topology and therefore is likely to underestimate the LCEA repertoire (see Results and Discussion). The parsimony scores under the two alternative datasets are shown for all 5 topologies. Also shown are the results
of SH alternative topology tests for the four alternative models under the polytomy favored by the analysis of Burki et al. [26] (see Results and Discussion). Paralog families and kinesin architectures, which must have been present in the LCEA given the tree topology are shown beneath each tree.
Kinesin paralogs are colored blue for families (K1-20) and green for non-families (X1-14; see Figure 1). Kinesin protein domain architectures are shown
in black (see Figure 2). These analyses indicate minimally 18 to 29 kinesin characters (paralogs/architectures) in the LCEA. Kinesin characters present
in the LCEA under the 4 leading models of the eukaryotic tree topology, A-D (the minimal ancestral repertoire - MAR) are marked in bold.

The phylogenetic branching order and root position of
the eukaryotes is a contentious issue. Burki et al. [26]
have recently performed large-scale phylogenetic analysis
of concatenated sequence and suggest three major
eukaryotic branches: excavates (which in their analysis
included the discicristate group containing Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Naegleria) [29], unikonts (containing Metazoa, Fungi and Amoebozoa) [7,30] and a
major clade, which encompasses the majority of phototrophic or ancestrally phototrophic eukaryotes (containing Archaeplastida, stramenopiles and alveolates)
[26]. Many aspects of these groupings are also consistent
with other concatenated multi-gene phylogenetic analysis
[22,23,31,32]. The results of the Burki et al. analysis [26],
however, did not sample the metamonad genomes
(Trichomonas and Giardia) [33,34], which have also been
tentatively classified as excavates [29] (see [22,32,35] for
phylogenetic evidence of monophyly if not holophyly),

but were excluded because these taxa often produce long
branches within phylogenetic trees and are therefore
potentially a source of artifact in tree inference [36].
As it has been suggested that the metamonad branch
may represent the first branch in the eukaryotic phylogeny and the excavates may be paraphyletic to the root of
the eukaryotes, the consensus view of the eukaryote phylogeny is a polytomy of four major clades: 1) metamonads
(e.g. Trichomonas and Giardia); 2) discicristates, (e.g.
Trypanosoma, Leishmania and Naegleria); 3) unikonts
(including Metazoa, Fungi and Amoebozoa); and 4) a
large 'ancestrally phototrophic' clade (including Archaeplastida, stramenopiles, and alveolates) [26]. Therefore, a
number of primary branch groups are possible. We used
a Dollo parsimony approach to compare four topological
variations possible within this polytomy (Figure 3A-D)
with the results of an unconstrained Dollo parsimony
analysis (Figure 3E). These alternative topologies

Wickstead et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/110

included a tree that placed the metamonads (Trichomonas and Giardia) as the first branch [37-39] and a tree
topology equivalent to the bikont-unikont model
[7,30,40,41].
For comparison we have included the most parsimonious tree generated when using the Dollo method without
any topological constraint (Figure 3E). This is the simplest possible explanation for the extant distribution of
the characters if no assumptions are made with regards to
the branching order of that tree. The resultant tree is very
unlikely to be a realistic eukaryotic phylogeny. However,
even given this topology, the LCEA possessed a complex
repertoire of minimally 11 ancestral kinesin families and
5 kinesin architectures (Figure 3E).
Each of the 4 likely alternative topologies for eukaryotic
evolution implies a slightly different ancestral kinesin
repertoire in the LCEA (Figure 3A-D). However, our
analysis identifies a complex core set of ancestral characters that were present in the LCEA under any of these 4
tree topologies. These include 11 kinesin paralogs namely, Kinesin-1, 2, 3, 4/10, 5, 8, 9A, 9B, 13, 14, 17 - and
3 protein domain architectures - KISc, KISc-FHA, SAMKISc. This core set will here be referred to as the minimal
ancestral repertoire (MAR and are marked in bold on Figure 3). These results show that a large proportion of the
extant diversity of the kinesin superfamily was already
established before the radiation of eukaryotes from the
LCEA. They also strongly suggest that the ancestral
eukaryotic cell had a complex biology built around a
microtubule-based cytoskeleton.
It is clear that several kinesin families are linked to specific cellular functions [17,42]. However, for some families pleiotropy and a lack of knowledge of function across
a broad taxonomic base makes it difficult to unambiguously infer ancestral function. Of the 11 paralog families
in the MAR, at least three have conserved functions in
nuclear division (mitosis and/or meiosis; Kinesin-5, -13
and -14) that are most likely ancestral to the whole family.
From this, we can infer that the LCEA built a bidirectional spindle containing both plus-end directed (Kinesin-5) and minus-end directed (Kinesin-14) motors [4346]. The presence of these antagonistic motors suggests
that, even in early eukaryotic cells, spindle construction
relied on generation of counteracting pole-to-pole forces
(see [47-49]). Alongside these spindle motors, the LCEA
encoded a Kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerizing motor
[50,51], possibly embedded in the kinetochores, as it is in
several extant species examined [52-55]. It is credible to
suggest that the Kinesin-8 and Kinesin-4/10 (also part of
the MAR) were also part of this ancestral nuclear division
mechanism. However, the identification of significant
alternative roles for these families outside of nuclear division [56-58], makes the possibility of this being the ancestral function tentative.

Page 7 of 12

The presence of Kinesin-1 and -3 paralogs in the MAR,
suggests strongly that the LCEA had the capacity to traffic membrane-bound bodies within the cytoplasm [5963]. This implies that the ancestral cell built cytoplasmic
microtubules and processed vesicular traffic - in agreement with the wide taxonomic distribution of many additional components of the eukaryotic membranetrafficking system in extant eukaryotes [64].
Notably, none of the four trees representing alternative
hypotheses encompassed by the eukaryotic ancestral
polytomy model represents the most parsimonious topology under the Dollo approach. The most parsimonious
explanation of the observed data (Figure 3E) is clearly
inconsistent with any current views of the eukaryotic
branching order. The placing of Amoebozoa as the primary eukaryotic branch is almost certainly an artifact
caused by the lack of flagella/cilia and the associated loss
of kinesins with ciliary function in the two amoebozoa for
which complete genome data is publicly available. Such
artifact has been described previously [8]. Consistent
with the hypothesis that the positioning of the Amoebozoa in unconstrained trees is an artifact of ciliary loss, the
ancestral repertoire implied by the most parsimonious
unconstrained tree is the MAR set without the families
associated with cilia/flagella [8] (Kinesin-2, 9A, 9B and
17; Figure 3E/F). We investigated what evidence for kinesin paralogs might be available from expressed sequence
tag sequencing of amoebozoan organisms which build
flagella. However, only 2 and 1 kinesin motor fragments
are contained in the expressed sequence tag libraries for
Mastigamoeba and Hyperamoeba, respectively from
TBestDB [65]. Of these, the Mastigamoeba sequences
could be placed with reasonable confidence into the
Kinesin-14A and Kinesin-13 groups (the fragment of
kinesin sequence from the two Hyperamoeba datasets
could not be grouped; data not shown).
Finally, the MAR, as defined by comparison of 4 alternative eukaryote topologies above, shows that the LCEA
had a cilium/flagellum. Kinesin-2 is the anterograde
motor of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery - a
series of components critical for building and servicing
cilia/flagella (see [66,67]). In Chlamydomonas, the protein KLP1 (Kinesin-9A) is a part of the central apparatus
of the cilia [68], although the level of conservation of this
function is yet to be widely assessed. For two of the MAR
paralogs - Kinesin-9B and Kinesin-17 - there is currently
no published functional data at all. However, the presence
of Kinesin-2, 9A, 9B and 17, and also the non-MAR family Kinesin-16, only in organisms which build flagella/cilia
at some stage in their lifecycle ([8] and Figure 1) predicts
an ancestral role associated with this organelle.

Conclusions
The microtubule-based cytoskeleton in extant eukaryotes
- with its motors and accessory proteins - is vastly more

Wickstead et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/110

complex than the prokaryotic FtsZ-based system from
which it evolved (see [69]). It is used in many of the cellular processes that define eukaryotes. Yet there is little
molecular evidence for the timing of the acquisition of
several of these key features. Here, we have explored the
evolution of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton through the evolution of its kinesin motors. We have used genomic information from 45 diverse eukaryotes to produce the most
extensive kinesin phylogeny to date, for which we have
derived statistical support. We have used this to define 51
anciently-derived kinesin paralogs, contained within 17
kinesin families and 34 subfamilies. We also defined 105
gene architectures for the 1624 kinesin sequences
included in the analysis - of which only 6 architectures
are shared between the major taxonomic groups in our
analysis.
The branching order of the major lineages of eukaryotes is still a contentious issue. However, by accounting
for multiple possible topologies, as well as secondary loss,
we have shown that a minimum of 11 kinesin families
were present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor.
The prevailing trend in current models of early eukaryotic cell evolution is the proposal of stepwise acquisition
of cellular complexity with particular extant eukaryotic
lineages being identified as derived from intermediary
and primitive phases of early eukaryotic evolution
(reviewed in [1]). This idea is contradicted by the results
presented here, which demonstrate that, at least for the
kinesin-driven cytoskeleton, the LCEA already possessed
a highly complex cellular form before giving rise to any of
the sampled extant eukaryotic groups. This protoeukaryotic cell was surprisingly highly developed in
terms of kinesin motor types - containing the majority of
families now found in eukaryotes. In contrast, the
domain architectures of these motors have been much
more extensively modified during diversification of lineages, such that only 3 can be unambiguously traced back
to the LCEA. These results are consistent with a growing
body of literature which suggests that the LCEA had a
highly complex cellular form. Alongside the complex
kinesin repertoire shown here, this ancestral cell possessed genes encoding the major cellular components of
meiosis [70], a derived and complex DNA replisome [71],
and many components required for endocytosis [64,72]
and probably phagotrophy [30].
The kinesin types present in the LCEA provide molecular evidence for some of the cellular processes present in
the proto-eukaryote. The LCEA had nuclear division
machinery that included antagonistic motors to generate
tension and kinetochore-associated microtubule depolymerizing agents. It also trafficked vesicles along cytoplasmic microtubules and built an axoneme with a
central apparatus (and which, on the basis of dynein distribution, was motile [9]). The data presented here also

Page 8 of 12

show that, although there have been significant gene
duplication events within the kinesin families (for example deep within the metazoa and also the land plants), the
history of kinesins is in many cases a history of paralog
loss from an ancestral form which possessed a motor repertoire more complex than many extant organisms.

Methods
Kinesin motor domain phylogeny

Predicted protein datasets were obtained for 45 diverse
eukaryotes for which complete or near-complete genome
sequence data is publicly available. Additional file 7 provides a comprehensive list of sources and versions for
these datasets. From these datasets, we extracted complete kinesin repertoires using HMMERv2.3.2 [22] to find
all predicted proteins with a match to the Pfam 'kinesin
motor domain' profile (PF00225; [69]). In total, 1624
sequences match the kinesin motor model at or above the
'gathering threshold' (score = -135; expectation value < 2
Ã 10-4). However, for phylogenetic reconstructions, highly
divergent sequences cause problems with both sequence
alignment and tree inference [73] and we found that
inclusion of the most divergent kinesin sequences hindered tree reconstruction (data not shown). For this reason, 166 sequences with scores < 100 (expectation value >
10-25), representing the most divergent sequences, were
excluded from phylogenetic analyses (Additional file 1).
The remaining 1458 sequences were trimmed to 80 aa
either side of the kinesin motor domain (as defined by the
Pfam model) and the motors domains aligned using
MAFFT6.24 [74] adopting the E-INS-i strategy [75]. This
alignment was then trimmed to well-aligned blocks (330
characters) and we reduced redundancy in the dataset by
removing 195 sequences from duplicated genes that
encode proteins predicted to be identical or nearly identical (>95% identity at the amino acid level) to other
sequences from the same organism. Both untrimmed and
trimmed alignments are available in Additional file 8 and
9, respectively.
Bayesian phylogenies were inferred from the protein
alignment using metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) method as implemented in
the program MrBayes3.1.2 [14]. The WAG substitution
matrix was used [76] with a gamma-distributed variation
in substitution rate approximated to 4 discrete categories
and shape parameter estimated from the data (mean Î± =
0.927). Ten runs were preformed each consisting of 4
Markov chains heated to a 'temperature' of 0.2 and run
for 12,000,000 generations. All runs were initiated from a
starting tree inferred from BLASTp scores as described in
[8] - a strategy which gave significantly better stationary
phase tree likelihoods than those using starting trees
inferred by either maximum parsimony or neighbor-joining (data not shown). Chains were sampled every 8,000

Wickstead et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/110

generations. Two runs, which did not reach apparent stationary phase by halfway through the run, were discarded. For the remaining 8 runs, the first 6,400,000
generations of each was discarded as burn-in and the
remaining generations were used to construct the majority-rule consensus tree shown in Additional file 2.
Assessing topological support for the kinesin tree

Since the scale of the phylogenetic analysis (1263
sequences) made bootstrap replication unfeasible, we
tested the level of support for the inferred topology using
the approximate Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT) method of
Anisimova and Gascuel [15]. Both non-parametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like (SH) and parametric Ï2-based pvalues were generated using the aLRT implementation in
PhyML 3.0 [16] with the LG substitution matrix [77]. It is
likely that both aLRT methods provide a better estimate
of branch support than do Bayesian posterior probabilities. aLRT methods directly test the inferred topology by
comparing it to an alternative topology where each node
has been systematically collapsed. In contrast, Bayesian
methods rely on adequate sampling of the posterior distribution of topologies to provide a good estimate of the
posterior probabilities. Because our dataset is highly
complex and the tree topology was calculated from a very
large MCMCMC search, the resulting trees sampled for
the consensus tree will include numerous trees with slight
variations in topology by virtue of stochastic error within
the MCMCMC sampling procedure. This has the effect
of increasing the frequency of recovery of low posterior
probabilities in large and complex datasets, as is evident
when compared to the results of the aLRT topology
assessment methods (Additional file 10). Kinesin families
(K1-20) were defined as encompassing all sequences
within the most basal clans having p > 0.95 support in
both aLRT tests. To test the affect of a change in amino
acid substitution matrix, we repeated the aLRT test using
the WAG [76] and JTT matrices [78]. Of the 485 nodes
recovered in the phylogenetic analysis supported with p >
0.95 for both Ï2- and SH-based approximate likelihood
ratio tests using the LG matrix, 461 (94.5%) and 463
(94.9%) were recovered with p > 0.95 for both tests when
using the WAG or JTT matrix, respectively - demonstrating that a change in matrix had a relatively minor effect in
the clade support values used to classify kinesin paralogues.
Unsurprisingly, the proportion of sequences falling into
one of the well-supported kinesin families decreases as
the 'quality' (as assessed by Pfam score) of the kinesin
motor domain decreases (Additional file 11). This implies
that a large proportion of the highly divergent kinesin
motors excluded from tree inference do not belong to
established kinesin paralog families, and it is unlikely that

Page 9 of 12

large numbers of bona fide family members were
excluded from our analysis.
Identifying kinesin protein architectures and ancient
patterns of kinesin evolution

We used all 1624 sequences identified from the HMMER
search as separate search seeds for PfamA [20] and CDD
[21] searches in order to identify the presence and relative order of conserved protein domains. The results of
the two protein architecture searches were compared,
noting the relative position of the domains within the
amino acid sequence. Using these comparisons consensus putative domain architecture were identified for each
protein sequence. All architecture types were mapped
onto our comprehensive phylogeny in order to identify
the phylogenetic distribution of the protein architectures
(Additional file 2). Kinesin protein architectures specific
to paralog families or specific phylogenetic clusters were
judged as the product of a single protein domain rearrangement or domain acquisition event (Additional file 5;
see Additional file 6 for exclusions). We identified several
kinesin domain architectures, which include domains
present in a low number of distantly related genomes or
for which the kinesin motor domains belong to distantly
related paralog families. In these cases, we conducted further analysis to investigate whether these sequences were
composed of domains related by either convergence or
vertical inheritance, or if the domain classification was
artifactual. For each candidate domain architecture
marked 'd' on Figure 2, functional and annotation data
was accessed from Pfam and CDD [20,21], domain alignments were made using MUSCLE and manually edited
using the SEAVIEW alignment platform [79,80]. 11 cases
of domain classification, for which no good evidence of
homology could be found, were either excluded as likely
artifact or adjusted for taxon distribution as appropriate
(Additional file 6). SAM1 and SAM2 domains are homologous and were classified as one domain for the purposes
of this study (Additional file 6).
Evaluating kinesin evolution under alternative eukaryotic
tree topologies

To investigate the minimum complement of kinesin
forms present in common ancestor of all 45 genomes
sampled, we coded the presence and absence of kinesin
families (marked 'c' Figure 1) and reliable protein architectures (marked 'c' Figure 2) as binary characters. In
both cases we were careful to include only characters that
were strongly suggested to be monophyletic by the phylogenetic analysis, allowing for some secondary loss of
domain architectures within established kinesin families.
To further ameliorate patterns of secondary loss we
coded the presence and absence of kinesin across the 8
higher taxonomic units (marked on Figures 1 and 2) to

Wickstead et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/110

produce a matrix of 8 'taxa' and 39 characters. We used a
Dollo parsimony analysis method [27] implemented
through Phylip 3.68 [28] to assess the ancestral repertoire
implied by several alternative eukaryotic topologies, the
best scoring Dollo parsimony tree topology (see Figure 3).
To further investigate these alternative topologies we
used a second coding of the data; in this case we used
only the kinesin subfamilies in Additional file 2 (or kinesin families where no subfamilies had been identified),
producing a matrix of 8 taxa and 51 characters. Kinesin
family member that did not fall into any of the subfamilies were coded as uncertainty in any absences for the
other subfamilies.
