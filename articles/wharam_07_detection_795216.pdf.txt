Abstract
Background: Signal-Mediated Amplification of RNA Technology (SMART) is an isothermal nucleic
acid amplification technology, developed for the detection of specific target sequences, either RNA
(for expression) or DNA. Cyanophages are viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Marine cyanophages
are ubiquitous in the surface layers of the ocean where they infect members of the globally
important genus Synechococcus.
Results: Here we report that the SMART assay allowed us to differentiate between infected and
non-infected host cultures. Expression of the cyanophage strain S-PM2 portal vertex gene (g20)
was detected from infected host Synechococcus sp. WH7803 cells. Using the SMART assay, we
demonstrated that g20 mRNA peaked 240 – 360 minutes post-infection, allowing us to characterise
this as a mid to late transcript. g20 DNA was also detected, peaking 10 hours post-infection,
coinciding with the onset of host lysis.
Conclusion: The SMART assay is based on isothermal nucleic acid amplification, allowing the
detection of specific sequences of DNA or RNA. It was shown to be suitable for differentiating
between virus-infected and non-infected host cultures and for the detection of virus gene
expression: the first reported use of this technology for such applications.

Background
The Signal-Mediated Amplification of RNA Technology
(SMART, developed by Cytocell Ltd., Banbury, UK), also
referred to as CytAMP® (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) was originally developed for the medical diagnostics industry [1]. Public Health Laboratory trials have
compared CytAMP® with more conventional methods for
the specific detection of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) [2]. A review, outlining guidelines for

the laboratory diagnosis and susceptibility testing of
MRSA, reported that the sensitivity and specificity of
CytAMP® was comparable to those of PCR for this purpose
[3].
The SMART assay, summarised in figure 1, has been
described in detail elsewhere [1,4]. Briefly, the assay uses
two oligonucleotide probes which hybridise specifically
to the target, at adjacent sites, and also to each other to

form a "T" structure known as a three-way junction (3WJ)
(Fig. 1a). The efficiency of 3WJ formation is greatly
enhanced by the use of facilitator probes that anneal to
the target adjacent to the 3WJ. Only when specific target
nucleic acid is present, a T7 RNA polymerase promoter
sequence within the 3WJ structure becomes double
stranded, and hence activated. T7 RNA polymerase then
produces large amounts of an RNA transcript. This RNA is

The SMART assay
The SMART assay. (a) Specific probes hybridise with the target to form a three-way junction (3WJ), assisted by facilitator
probes (f1 & f2). The 3WJ initially contains a single-stranded,
inactive T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The promoter is made double stranded (active) by extension (by Bst
DNA polymerase) off the 3' of the extension probe, leading
to the generation of large amounts of RNA signal (by T7
RNA polymerase), which may itself be amplified if required.
(b) Detection of RNA signal by ELOSA (Enzyme Linked OligoSorbant Assay). The assay uses 2 specific probes: a biotinylated capture probe and enzyme (Alkaline phosphatase,
AP) linked detection probe. Non-specific nucleic acid and
3WJ probes are removed, following binding in a streptavidin
coated well, and RNA signal is detected via a colour change.
Quantification of signal takes place in a 96 well plate, allowing
multiple samples to be analysed simultaneously.

the assay signal and it can be further amplified by the
same process if required, and detected by an enzymelinked oligosorbant assay (ELOSA) (Fig. 1b). Amplification and signal detection processes have been fully
described and explained previously [1,4].
Here, we report the first application of this isothermal
nucleic acid amplification assay for the detection of viral
DNA and RNA within infected host cells. This is also the
first report of the assay being used to detect gene expression.
The viruses chosen for this study were cyanophages. These
are viruses that infect cyanobacteria, which are globally
important photosynthetic microorganisms. Cyanophages
have a wide spectrum of host ranges, are ubiquitous and
can be easily isolated from a range of aquatic environments [5]. Marine cyanophages are extremely numerous
in surface seawater [6-9]. Their hosts, Synechococcus spp.,
are marine cyanobacteria, which also have a widespread
distribution throughout the world's oceans and are
thought to contribute up to 25% of primary productivity
in the open ocean [10]. There is great interest in marine
cyanophages, as they are key components of microbial
communities and influence host populations [11] and
biogeochemical cycling [12-14], as well as primary productivity.
Much of the emphasis of research on marine cyanophages
has focussed on the dynamics (or propagation strategy)
between phage and host in situ and on determining their
genetic diversities [15-20]. Until recently, very little had
been reported about marine cyanophage gene expression,
gene function or phage assembly apart from what could
be deduced from sequence information [21-25]. However, following the discovery of photosynthetic genes in
marine cyanophages [26-28], studies on their expression
using microarrays [29] and quantitative real-time PCR
[30], were used to help determine functionality (see
review by Clokie et al [31]).
Cyanophage strain S-PM2 was originally isolated by
plaque assay from coastal water off Plymouth, UK and
belongs to the family Myoviridae, a group of doublestranded DNA phages with contractile tails. S-PM2 has
been classified into a sub-group of phages termed the 'exo
T-evens' based on a phylogenetic analysis of the structural
components, encoded on a 10 kb module, from a range of
T-even phages, [22]. One of these structural components
is the portal vertex protein (gp20). The g20 gene was originally identified in cyanophages in order to develop a
PCR-based assay to analyze natural cyanophage populations [21].

Sequence analysis of g20 in S-PM2 revealed significant
similarity to g20 from the enteric coliphage T4, therefore
it is likely that the function of gp20 in S-PM2 is similar to
that in T4 where it is involved in head assembly. T4 head
assembly takes place in several phases and is reviewed
extensively in Black et al. [32]. Briefly, a prohead is assembled, starting from a membrane-bound initiation complex, the prohead then undergoes proteolysis and is
detached from the membrane. The head is then packaged
with DNA and final maturation steps occur. At the membrane attachment (proximal) vertex of the prohead shell,
there is a dodecameric ring of gp20 protein, termed connector or portal protein. Formation of this structure is
essential, and is thought to be the rate-limiting step in T4
prohead initiation. The prohead portal proteins do not
undergo proteolysis (as opposed to other prohead proteins which do) and they form the site at which the tail is
attached and through which DNA will eventually pass.
The g20 gene is now widely used as a marker to study the
diversity and population dynamics of both marine and
freshwater cyanophage [19,20,33-38]. Despite such wide
scale exploitation of the g20 gene sequence, there have
been no previous studies on cyanophage g20 gene expression.
Sequence information from cyanophage g20 was used to
develop a set of probes designed for use in the SMART isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology. We have
previously reported that the assay discriminated between
similar g20 target DNA sequences from two different
marine cyanophage strains [4]. Earlier trials also showed
the assay, as well as detecting DNA targets, could generate
signals from specific RNA (using E. coli as a model target
organism and a high copy number ribosomal RNA as the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/52

target sequence) [1]. The assay conditions are identical,
regardless of whether an RNA or DNA target is to be
detected.
Here we report that we can detect cyanophage strain SPM2 g20 mRNA from infected Synechococcus sp. WH7803
using a technology based on isothermal nucleic acid
amplification. In addition, the SMART assay was used to
monitor g20 expression and the subsequent increase in
cyanophage DNA in the infected culture. This is the first
use of the assay in looking at gene expression, and in
detecting viral nucleic acid in an infected host. It is also
the first study looking at cyanophage g20 gene expression.

Results and discussion
Detection of S-PM2 g20 mRNA from infected host cells
Different sets of SMART probes were designed to detect
the coding and non-coding strands of DNA in the S-PM2
g20 target, (Table 1). Probes for the coding strand could
generate signal from both DNA and RNA, those for the
non-coding strand from DNA only.

A preliminary experiment was performed to determine
whether SMART could detect viral RNA from an infected
culture. In order to detect S-PM2 g20 mRNA from infected
host cells, RNA and DNA were extracted from infected
Synechococcus sp. WH7803 approximately 24 hours prior
to lysis, when viral RNA was predicted to be detectable.
Nucleic acid was also extracted from an uninfected culture, for use in controls.
Probes designed against the coding strand (to detect DNA
+ RNA) of g20 generated a SMART assay signal from both
DNA and RNA extracted from infected host cells from
flask 2 (24 hours prior to culture lysis) (Fig. 2a). Low,

Studying g20 gene expression during the cyanophage
infection cycle
Further experiments were set up to determine whether the
SMART assay could monitor S-PM2 g20 expression during
the cyanophage infection cycle. Samples collected over a
time series were used to detect changes in the levels of g20
mRNA and DNA following infection of Synechococcus by
cyanophage S-PM2 (Fig. 3). Results from a preliminary
experiment had indicated when the intracellular viral
RNA and DNA was likely to peak (i.e. after the 4-hour
time point: data not shown), hence the collection of samples increased in intensity from the 4-hour (240 minute)
time point. Since the focus was g20 expression, the majority of samples were taken for RNA analysis, but some samples were also analysed for viral DNA, to determine how

the sets of data would relate to each other. SMART assays
[1,4] were used to detect g20 target mRNA and DNA.
Cyanophage S-PM2 g20 expression was only detected at a
low level up to the 240-minute post-infection (i.e. after
addition of cyanophages to the host culture) time point.
Despite variation in the data, S-PM2 g20 mRNA concentration increased sharply at 240-minutes post-infection,
with maximum g20 mRNA detected at 260-minutes post
infection (Fig. 3a). At 10 – 11 hours post-infection, g20
mRNA had dropped back to lower concentrations. g20
DNA started to increase 6-hours post-infection, to a maximum level 10-hours post-infection (Fig. 3b).

background signals were produced from flask 3 (uninfected control). Probes designed against the non-coding
strand (to detect DNA but not RNA) of g20 generated a
signal from DNA extracted from infected host cells in flask
2 (24 hours prior to culture lysis) (Fig. 2b). Probes for the
non-coding strand only produced a very weak signal from
the RNA extractions from flask 2 (Fig. 2b). This result confirmed that the coding strand probes were able to detect
cyanophage strain S-PM2 g20 mRNA from infected Synechococcus sp. WH7803 host cells (Fig. 2a).

Data obtained using the SMART assay fit with what is
already known about the kinetics of cyanophage infection. In cyanophage strain S-PM2 the onset of lysis occurs
after a 9 hour latent period in infected Synechococcus sp.
WH7803 cells [39]. Maximum g20 expression was
observed at 4 hours 20 minutes after infection (Fig. 3a),
which is just under half way through the S-PM2 latent
period. If compared to phage T4 infection, which has a
latent period of 25 minutes [40], this would characterise
S-PM2 g20 mRNA as a mid to late transcript. However,
recent work by Clokie et al [30] demonstrated that S-PM2
only has 2 (early and late) classes of transcripts rather than
the 3 (early, mid and late) observed in T4. In T4, late
mRNA is known to direct the synthesis of phage T4 structural proteins as well as proteins that help with phage
assembly and are involved in cell lysis. S-PM2, structural
genes g18 and g23 were characterised as late transcripts
[30] and their expression increased to maximum levels
between 4 – 6 hours; this is consistent with S-PM2 g20
(another structural gene) expression data in figure 3 here.
Evidence from electron microscopy and other studies on
T4 suggests that the prohead and mature head contain
960 copies of gp23, the major capsid protein, compared
with only 12 copies of gp20. Indeed, gp20 is the least
abundant of the prohead proteins compared to the others
that have copy numbers of between 55 (gp24) and 576
(gp22) [32]. If expression levels are similar in cyanophage
S-PM2, it is encouraging that the SMART assay has the necessary sensitivity for detecting g20 gene expression. Therefore, it is likely that the assay would be highly suitable for
future expression studies.
The increase in signal from S-PM2 g20 DNA (Fig. 3) is
consistent with the continuous replication of cyanophage
DNA for eventual packaging into proheads during the
infection cycle [41]. The peak of g20 DNA within the host
cells 10 hours post-infection is consistent with previous
observations that the onset of Synechococcus cell lysis
occurs from 9 hours post-infection with the burst period
continuing to 12 – 15 hours post-infection [39].

Conclusion
The SMART assay successfully differentiated between
infected and non-infected host cultures and detected gene
expression. SMART is a simple and sensitive assay, which
may be a suitable alternative to more conventional techniques such as Northern analysis and RT-PCR for a range
of applications. Also, since is it relatively simple to adapt
the assay for the detection of other target sequences, it
would be possible to use a set of different specific probes
to simultaneously study the expression of different virus
and host genes, or assay for different viruses. The equipment used is relatively simple and start up costs low, so for
many applications (where there is interest in a relatively

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/52

small number of genes) it could be developed as a simple
alternative to the use of microarrays.
Interest in isothermal nucleic acid amplification is currently increasing. One possible future application of these
techniques includes in situ work, for example for use in
the identification and quantification of infected cells. The
repeated rounds of high temperatures involved in thermal
cycling can create problems with in situ PCR, due to cellular damage. In addition, isothermal amplification techniques are potentially more robust, and have lower energy
requirements than methods involving thermal cycling.
These are significant benefits for certain applications, such
as developing assays for use in remote areas, or for autonomous systems with applications which might include
environmental monitoring and assessing public health
risks.
The SMART assay, based on isothermal nucleic acid
amplification, allows the detection of specific sequences
of DNA or RNA. It was shown to be suitable for differentiating between virus-infected and non-infected host cultures and for the detection of gene expression: the first
reported use of this technology for such applications.

Methods
Cyanophages, host strain and media
Technical details concerning host strain Synechococcus sp.
WH7803, growth media, culturing, cyanophage strain SPM2 stock preparation and propagation have been
described previously [4,21,39].
Reagents
Oligonucleotide probes synthesised by phosphoramidite
chemistry using a model 380A synthesiser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and purified using standard HPLC or FPLC techniques were obtained from Oswel
Research products (Southampton, UK).
Probe design
The sequences of cyanophage-specific probes are listed in
table 1. Probes for the S-PM2 g20 coding strand are identical to those used previously [4]. A further set of probes
was designed to detect the non-coding strand of g20. The
sequences of targets, probes, and RNA signals were
designed to minimise potential secondary structure, and
their melting temperatures were determined, as described
previously [4]. The template probes include a hexaethylene glycol (HEG) linker molecule to reduce non-specific
background signal. Sequences of probes for the amplification of signal RNA, capture and detection of SMART signal, and of synthetic product for ELOSA standard curve
have all been published previously [1,4].

Sampling infected host 24 hours prior to lysis
An exponentially growing culture of Synechococcus sp.
WH7803 was split into 3 × 100 mL aliquots in sterile glass
conical flasks and incubated at 25°C under constant illumination (5 to 36 microeinsteins m-2s-1). At time zero,
cyanophage strain S-PM2 was added to flask 1 at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1 (= 1 mL of fresh
lysate); 24 hours later, the same volume of cyanophage
lysate was added to flask 2; flask 3 remained uninfected as
a control. Flask 1 lysed (indicated by clearing of the culture) 3 days after initial infection, therefore, we predicted
that virus mRNA would be detectable in flask 2 at this
time point (24-hours prior to culture lysis). RNA and
DNA were extracted from the cultures sampled at this time
point as described below.
Sampling to follow g20 gene expression during the
cyanophage infection cycle
A 1 L culture of exponentially growing Synechococcus sp.
WH7803 host cells was infected with cyanophage strain SPM2 at a MOI of approximately 1 and incubated for 12
hours at 25°C under constant illumination. Duplicate 4
mL and 2 mL aliquots of infected cells (for RNA and DNA
extraction respectively) were pelleted, snap frozen in liquid N2 then stored at -80°C at various time intervals over
the 12 hour period. Frozen cell pellets were defrosted at
37°C and DNA and RNA were extracted as described
below.
Extraction of viral nucleic acid from infected host cells
RNA was extracted from 4 mL of pelleted cells using a Qiagen RNeasy® Mini kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). The protocol
included a DNase treatment step. RNA was eluted in a
final volume of 50 µL RNase-free sterile water. DNA was
extracted from 2 mL of pelleted cells using a Qiagen
DNeasy™ Tissue kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). DNA was eluted
in a final volume of 100 µL RNase-free sterile water.
SMART assays [1,4] were conducted on 5 µL target nucleic
acid, as described below.
The SMART assay: isothermal amplification from specific
target
Use of the SMART assay for the specific detection of cyanophage DNA has been described previously [4]. Target
DNA was added to a mixture containing 2 µL 10× transcription buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), extension
probe (5 fmol), template probe (1 fmol), facilitator
probes 1 and 2 (100 fmol each) and ultra-pure, sterile,
RNase-free water to a final volume of 15 µL. Samples were
mixed, heated at 90°C for 3 min on a PTC-200™ thermal
cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA), ramped down
to 41°C (0.1°C/s) and held at this temperature for 1 h. A
5 µL volume of solution containing dNTPs (5 µM each),

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/52

NTPs (2 mM each) (both from Amersham Biosciences,
Aylesbury UK), 4 U Bst (3' to 5'exo-) DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and 240 U T7
RNA polymerase (Ambion) was then added, and the reaction was incubated at 41°C for an additional 2 h.
To amplify the RNA signal further, the samples were
brought to room temperature before the addition of 20
fmol RNA amplification probe, followed by a mixture
containing 4.5 µL 10× transcription buffer, dNTPs (50 µM
each dNTP), NTPs (2 mM each NTP), 4 U Bst (3' to 5'exo) DNA polymerase, 160 U T7 RNA polymerase, and ultrapure, sterile, RNAse-free water to give a final volume of 17
µL. The samples were mixed and then incubated at 37°C
for 2 h. The samples could be stored at -20°C before the
signals were quantified.
The SMART assay: capture and detection of the assay
signal
The RNA signal was assayed by an Enzyme Linked OligoSorbent Assay (ELOSA). The RNA sequence includes
regions for capture, via a biotinylated probe, and detection using a further probe linked to alkaline phosphatase
(Fig. 1b). Biotinylated capture probe (0.9 pmol) and alkaline phosphatase-labelled probe (6 pmol) were added to
each well of a streptavidin-coated Combiplate (Thermo
Life Sciences, Hampshire, UK), in hybridisation buffer [50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 1%
(w/v) BSA]. An aliquot (5–20 µL) of the sample to be
quantified was then added, bringing the total volume to
150 µL per well. Samples were incubated at room temperature on a platform shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h. Unbound
material was removed from wells by washing 4 times with
200 µL wash buffer [1× TBS/0.1% Tween-20], then once
with 200 µL alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer (SCIL
Diagnostics, Martinsried, Germany). Substrate (4-Nitrophenyl phosphate, Boehringer-Mannheim UK, Sussex,
UK), at 5 mg/mL in substrate buffer, was then added (180
µL/well) and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured
using a plate reader (Labsystems integrated EIA Management system, Thermo Life Sciences) pre-warmed at 37°C,
reading absorbance at 405 nm every 2 minutes for 30
minutes. Rates of alkaline phosphatase activity for each
sample were compared to a standard curve, generated
using dilutions of a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide with
the same sequence as the RNA product. This allowed the
amount of RNA produced in each extension/transcription
reaction to be calculated.
