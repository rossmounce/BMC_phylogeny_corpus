Identification of new polymorphic regions and
differentiation of cultivated olives (Olea europaea L.)
through plastome sequence comparison

Abstract
Background: The cultivated olive (Olea europaea L.) is the most agriculturally important species of the Oleaceae
family. Although many studies have been performed on plastid polymorphisms to evaluate taxonomy, phylogeny
and phylogeography of Olea subspecies, only few polymorphic regions discriminating among the agronomically
and economically important olive cultivars have been identified. The objective of this study was to sequence the
entire plastome of olive and analyze many potential polymorphic regions to develop new inter-cultivar genetic
markers.
Results: The complete plastid genome of the olive cultivar Frantoio was determined by direct sequence analysis
using universal and novel PCR primers designed to amplify all overlapping regions. The chloroplast genome of the
olive has an organisation and gene order that is conserved among numerous Angiosperm species and do not
contain any of the inversions, gene duplications, insertions, inverted repeat expansions and gene/intron losses
that have been found in the chloroplast genomes of the genera Jasminum and Menodora, from the same family
as Olea.
The annotated sequence was used to evaluate the content of coding genes, the extent, and distribution of
repeated and long dispersed sequences and the nucleotide composition pattern. These analyses provided essential
information for structural, functional and comparative genomic studies in olive plastids. Furthermore, the alignment
of the olive plastome sequence to those of other varieties and species identified 30 new organellar polymorphisms
within the cultivated olive.
Conclusions: In addition to identifying mutations that may play a functional role in modifying the metabolism and
adaptation of olive cultivars, the new chloroplast markers represent a valuable tool to assess the level of olive
intercultivar plastome variation for use in population genetic analysis, phylogenesis, cultivar characterisation and
DNA food tracking.

Background
Olive is the main cultivated species belonging to the
monophyletic Oleaceae family, within the clade of Asterids, in which the majority of nuclear and organellar
genomic sequences are unknown. The Olea genus
includes two sections, Olea and Ligustroides. The former
comprises the six recognised subspecies of the olive
complex, which can be found throughout the Mediterranean area as well as the temperate and subtropical
regions of Africa and Asia. The Mediterranean form

(Olea europaea, subspecies europaea) includes the wild
(var. sylvestris) and cultivated (var. europaea) olives [1].
Recently, chloroplast genome sequencing of species
belonging to this family from the tribe of Jasmineae
revealed that two genera, Jasminum and Menodora,
carry several distinctive rearrangements, including inversions, gene duplications, insertions, inverted repeat
expansions and gene/intron losses [2]. One of these
genomic features involves the duplication of the rpl23
protein-coding gene in Jasminum. A similar duplication
has also been detected in the Poaceae, and in both Oleaceae and Poaceae, the duplicated copy has been inserted
into the intergenic region between rbcL and psaI [3]. By

comparative gene mapping and sequencing, Lee and
co-workers also demonstrated that all other Oleaceae
genera, including Olea, have an identical gene content
and order as Nicotiana tabacum. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the entire family, based upon the sequences
of the ndhF and rbcL genes, partially confirmed previous
results obtained by the analysis of the trnL-F and rps16
chloroplast regions [4].
Intraspecies variation within other Oleaceae genera,
such as Syringa [5], Forsythia [6], Ligustrum [7] and
Fraxinus [8,9] has also been examined.
Different chlorotypes have been identified among the
six subspecies of O. europaea. Lumaret et al. [10] identified 12 distinct chlorotypes by RFLP analysis of DNA
isolated from the purified chloroplasts of a wide set of
O. europaea taxa. In other O. europaea subspecies Baldoni et al. [11] identified nine nucleotide substitutions,
one insertion-deletion (indel) and a polymorphic poly-T
SSR in the trnT-L region. Besnard et al. [12] in the
O. europaea complex identified fourteen polymorphisms
in three chloroplast regions (trnT-L, trnQ-R and matK),
including five microsatellite motifs, two indels and eight
nucleotide substitution sites. Recently, the analysis of
four regions (trnL-F, trnT-L, trnS-G and matK) was
used to demonstrate the polyphyletic origin of the Olea
genus and estimate the divergence times for the major
groups of Olea species and subspecies during the Tertiary period [13].
In cultivated olives chloroplasts are maternally inherited [14] and, in contrast to that seen at the subspecies
level, a low plastidial variability was detected. A strong
linkage disequilibrium between the chloroplast and
mitochondrial genomes has been demonstrated, particularly for the Mediterranean cultivated and wild olives
(subspecies europaea), suggesting that a low level of
recurrent mutations occurs in both organellar genomes
of the olive [15].
In particular, RFLP analysis of chloroplast DNA isolated from 72 cultivars revealed that most cultivars have
a common chlorotype [16]. Besnard et al. [17], using
two microsatellites and 13 RFLPs on more than 140
olive cultivars, were able to distinguish only four chlorotypes. The majority of cultivars was characterised by the
chlorotype CE1, which likely originated from the wild
olive populations of the Eastern Mediterranean and was
spread to the Western part through cultivar dispersal by
humans. Polymorphisms at the varietal level have been
detected in the trnD-T locus [18], but only one polymorphism in this locus was found within a set of 12 cultivars [19].
Chloroplast DNA represents an ideal system for plant
species DNA barcoding, and some chloroplast regions
have been indicated as ideal for use in tests that discriminate between different land plants. Based on assessments

of recoverability, sequence quality and discriminatory
abilities at the species level, the two-locus combination
of rbcL-matK has been recommended as a universal
framework for plant barcoding [20]. The combination of
trnH-psbA coupled with rbcL has been recommended for
DNA barcoding to discriminate between lower taxonomic ranks such as genera or related species [21]. In
highly valuable crop species, such as the olive, that
have a variety of cultivars available in the market, however, typing at the species level is not sufficient. Thus,
the development of reliable methods to rapidly and
efficiently discriminate between cultivars has become a
pressing need. In addition, DNA barcoding may have
useful applications to tracking food products [22] and
the analysis of archaeological remains [23].
In this respect, the availability of complete chloroplast
genome sequences from a growing number of species
offers the opportunity to evaluate many potentially polymorphic sites and identify new regions that could be
used to define cultivar DNA barcodes.
There are numerous approaches to sequence chloroplast genomes: traditional sequence analysis of highly
purified chloroplast DNA, as applied for Solanum
lycopersicum [24], Lolium perenne [25], Trachelium
caeruleum [26], Jasminum nudiflorum [2] and Parthenium argentatum [27]; Rolling Circle Amplification
(RCA) of high-purity chloroplast DNA, as demonstrated in Cicer arietinum [28], Platanus occidentalis
[29] and Welwitschia mirabilis [30]; shot gun sequence
analysis of BAC clones containing chloroplast genomic
inserts, as demonstrated in Vitis vinifera [31], Hordeum vulgare [32] and Brachypodium distachyon [33];
and the use of universal primers based on chloroplast
sequences highly conserved among most Angiosperm
species to amplify overlapping fragments [34-36],
as demonstrated in Cycas taitungensis [37] and two
Bambusa species [38]. For this study, the last approach
was used to sequence the entire chloroplast genome of
the O. europaea subsp. europaea cv. Frantoio. The
resulting availability of the entire plastome allowed to
evaluate the sequence arrangement of the plastid genome in O. europaea and to identify new organellar
polymorphisms that could discriminate between cultivated olive varieties.

Results and Discussion
Size, gene content and gene order of the olive
chloroplast genome

The complete plastome of olive, cv. Frantoio has a total
length of 155,889 bp (GenBank Accession Number
GU931818), with the typical structure found in the
unrearranged chloroplast genomes of Angiosperms. It
includes an 86,614-bp Large Single Copy (LSC) and a
17,791-bp Small Single Copy (SSC) region separated by

(Table 2, Figure 2). These long interspersed repetitive
sequences included two tandem repeats in the ycf2 gene
and five palindromic sequences (two in the LSC, one in
the SSC and two in the IR regions). Three of the four
repeats found within the ycf2 exon were tandem repeats,
as previously observed in V. vinifera [31]. There were
only two inverted repeats, all the others were direct
repeats. Five repeats were located within CDS, two
repeats were found in the introns of the ycf3 and ndhA
genes and all others were in the intergenic spacers
(Table 2). Interspersed repeats did not cause any uncertainty during the sequencing process because they were
quite short (<61 bp), with a low number of repetitions
and primers were never constructed on the repeats.
The actual size of the olive plastome is larger than the
size estimated on the basis of RFLP analysis, which predicted a range from 132 to 134 Kb [16].

a pair of Inverted Repeats (IR), each 25,742 bp long
(Figure 1). Coding DNA (92,095 bp) accounts for
59.08% of the genome and includes protein coding
genes (80,252 bp), tRNAs (2,793) and rRNAs (9,050),
while noncoding DNA (63,794 bp) accounts for the
remaining 40.92% and includes introns (20,130 bp) and
intergenic spacers (43,664 bp). The olive plastome contains 114 unique genes (80 CDS, 30 tRNA and 4 rRNA),
with 19 of these genes (8 CDS, 7 tRNA and all 4 rRNA)
duplicated in the IR for a total of 133 genes. In addition,
the duplicated region includes a partial CDS for ycf1, as
in other species like Typha [39]. There are 18 introncontaining genes, 15 of which contain one intron and 3
(ycf3, clpP and rps12) with two introns. The rps12 gene
is trans-spliced, with the 5’ end located in the LSC and
the 3’ end duplicated in the IR regions. The nucleotide
composition of the olive chloroplast genome comprises
37.81% GC and 62.19% AT.
The in silico search for repetitive elements identified
633 mono-nucleotide SSRs with 5 or more repeat units
(Table 1), with 276 poly-A, 303 poly-T, 31 poly-C and
23 poly-G repeats. In addition, six di-nucleotide SSRs
with five or six repeat units, no tri-nucleotide SSRs,
three tetra- and two penta-nucleotide SSRs were identified, for a total of 644 repetitive sequences. The distribution of SSRs across the chloroplast genome was as
follows: 400 in the LSC (density = 0.0046), 126 in the
SSC (density = 0.0071) and 59 (x2) in the IR region
(density = 0.0022).
The repeat analysis also identified 14 interspersed
repetitive sequences longer than 30 bp, each having 2-6
repetitions and a sequence identity higher than 85%

Olive chloroplast genome organisation

The sequence of the olive chloroplast genome represents one of the first contributions to deciphering the
genetic background of this important tree crop species
and was used to verify that rearrangements observed in
the plastomes of other genera of Oleaceae, such as
Jasminum and Menodora, were not represented in
O. europaea. In fact, in contrast to what observed in the
Jasminum and Menodora plastomes [2], the olive chloroplast maintains a size range, organisation and gene
order typical of most land plants, such as members of
the Vitis, Populus, Citrus, Eucalyptus, Coffea and Arabidopsis genera. Based on the phylogeny of Oleaceae
inferred from the ndhF and rbcL genes [2], Jasminum

and Menodora were already known to be unusual genera within the family, and all other tribes, including
Oleae, to which the Olea genus belongs, do not share
their combination of multiple mutational events. The
highly conserved plastome organization of the olive
allowed universal primers and genome walking with
consensus primers to be used to amplify most of the
LSC region.
Identification of new plastid markers to discriminate
between olive cultivars

To detect intervarietal polymorphisms, a preliminary
screening of the intergenic spacer trnS-GCU - trnGUCC, previously demonstrated to be polymorphic
among olive varieties [40], was performed on a set of
30 cultivars having different geographical distributions
and representing a wide range of morphological and

agronomical phenotypes (data not shown). A sub-set of
eight highly variable cultivars (Table 4) was further
examined for 100 potentially polymorphic regions.
The tested potential variant domains have shown different levels of variability. Fifteen of the analyzed intergenic spacers contained mutations within the sequence
of the eight cultivars, ranging in number from one to
six per region. These mutations were microsatellites,
indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms (Table 3).
One SNP was located within the intron of the rpoC1
gene, and three others were located in the coding
regions (CDS) of the rpl14, ndhF and ycf1 genes. The
CDS-SNPs resulted in substitutions at aminoacidic position 109 in rpl14 (leucine to phenylalanine), at 32 aa in
ndhF (valine to alanine), and at 995 and 1,161 aa in ycf1
(leucine to isoleucine and isoleucine to arginine, respectively). Blast analyses revealed that the ndhF alanine and

the ycf1 leucine, widely represented in other species, are
present in Farga and Frantoio cultivars, respectively.
Also the rpl14 polymorphism can be found in other species, as is the case for the phenylalanine aminoacid,
present in the V. vinifera cv. Pinot Noir in the mitochondrial copy of this gene, due to the incorporation of
more than 42% of the Vitis chloroplast genome into
its mitochondrial genome [41]. On this respect, the
risk that our chloroplast olive markers may reside on
mitochondrial or nuclear genes has been prevented by

amplifying coding regions anchored on the intergenic
spacers and confirmed by the absence of sequence
ambiguities.
The comparison of the Frantoio chloroplast sequence
with ESTs deriving from fruits of cvs. Coratina and Tendellone showed some sequence mismatches, but they
were not confirmed by resequencing the corresponding
genomic regions in Coratina and Tendellone cultivars.
Overall, the analysis of cpDNA sequences from the eight
cultivars resulted in the identification of 40 polymorphic

within the SSC (Figure 2). The indel P32 was identified
within the repeat of the rps8 - rpl14 spacer, but none
of the other repetitive regions was polymorphic
between cultivars.
The chloroplast sequence of cv. Frantoio was also
compared with all previously sequenced regions of the

olive chloroplast, particularly with the plastome
sequence of cv. Bianchera, which has been recently
deposited in the Genbank database (NC_013707.1).
More than 200 mismatches were detected between the
Bianchera and Frantoio sequences. Surprisingly, not one
of these polymorphisms fell within the previously

Mariotti et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/211

identified cultivar-specific polymorphic regions. To verify if these mismatches might represent real sequence
differences between the two varieties, most of the
ambiguous regions were reamplified and resequenced in
both cultivars (Bianchera sample was provided by the
CRA-OLI of Spoleto, Perugia, Italy). These analyses confirmed the sequence of cv. Frantoio and showed an
absolute sequence identity with that obtained from the
cv. Bianchera in all of these regions, including the exons
of the rpoC1 and ndhF genes, carrying 27- and 9-bp
indels, respectively. The differences detected between
the two olive plastome sequences can not derive from
an incorrect identification of the Bianchera genotype
because, in that case, mutations should have been found
in the polymorphic sites and not randomly along the
chloroplast genome. More likely, divergences may be
attributed to sequence uncertainties in the Bianchera
plastome sequence deposited in GenBank.
The new markers identified in this study can distinguish
six haplotypes among eight cultivars. Therefore, these new
markers hold great promise for the identification of new
cultivar haplotypes and for use in DNA barcoding systems
to distinguish between different cultivars.
Comparison of plastome variation between cultivars and
with other Olea taxa

Based on previous chloroplast sequence analyses, olive
cultivars belong to the cp-II lineage and have been classified into three sublineages (E1, E2 and E3) and four
chlorotypes (1, 2, 9 and 13) [19,40]. These chlorotypes
were defined by evaluating length variations in the
psbK-psbI, trnS-trnG, rps2-rpoC2, trnE-trnT and atpBrbcL regions among more than 140 cultivars [17,19,40].
Several polymorphisms had been previously identified
in the partial sequence of the trnK intron (AF359497AF359504) by analysing the subspecies cuspidata, laperrinei, maroccana, cerasiformis, guanchica, europaea var.
sylvestris (wild olive) and the Cornicabra cultivar, but
none of these polymorphisms were found among the
cultivars we have analysed. The psbK-psbI and trnSGCU-trnG-UCC regions, spanning the polymorphic
sites P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13 and P14, were analyzed
by Besnard et al. [12] as fragment length variation on a
set of different O. europaea taxa including cultivars.
That analysis revealed intercultivar variability only at
P11, P12 and P13 but was unable to keep the C/T and
G/T SNPs in the P9 and P14 sites, respectively. We
treated the A/T/- polymorphism, closely linked to P11,
as a different polymorphism (P10) because the A/- indel
is present in most varieties while the T is a rare mutation carried by few cultivars.
The spacer rps2-rpoC2, spanning the polymorphic
sites P16, P17 and P18, generated five different chlorotypes among the eight varieties analysed, demonstrating

Page 9 of 13

a high level of rearrangement within cultivars. This
region corresponds to the ccmp5 microsatellite [42,43],
but previous studies that analysed only length polymorphisms were unable to capture the complexity of this
region. P28 includes ccmp7 [40,42] and an additional
SNP polymorphism (P27) captured in the flanking region.
Intrieri et al. [18] reported the identification of 5 SNPs
and 4 indels in the trnD-trnT region of 13 cultivars.
Analyzing a different set of cultivars, Besnard [19] did
not detect these polymorphisms. Similarly, only two
polymorphisms were confirmed in our cultivar set: the
poly-A SSR (P20) and the C/T SNP (P21).
Other regions previously analysed in different Olea
taxa, such as trnL-F and rps16 [4], trnL-trnF [13], and
trnT-trnL [11] were not polymorphic among our cultivars.
No differences between the eight cultivars were found
within the matK and psbA exons or the rps16 intron,
regions used for species barcoding. In contrast, the
psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA barcoding regions, both representing markers for plant species identification [44,45],
correspond to our P8, P2, P3 and P4 polymorphisms.
This observation indicates that these markers may not
accurately discriminate between some species, given
their potential intra-specific genetic variations [46].

Conclusions
The low level of cpDNA variation detected up to now
within olive cultivars represented a serious obstacle to
the widespread use of cpDNA markers for cultivar characterization, parentage analysis and population genetics.
The most probable causes of the high level of sequence
conservation may be related to the domestication process, by which most cultivars were likely derived from
only a few different wild plants, and the low generation
turnover resulting from the long life span of the trees,
which reduces the rate of emergence of new mutations.
In this study, using eight cultivars, 30 new cpDNA
markers were identified from the olive plastome
sequence and 10 markers previously reported were confirmed. In fact, the availability of the entire chloroplast
genome and systematic sequencing of candidate regions
from selected cultivars resulted in the identification of
many new polymorphisms, mostly represented by
nucleotide substitutions and by rearrangements of different microsatellites. They were not discovered in previous analyses likely because these focused mostly on
fragment length variations.
The 40 markers applied to eight cultivars were able to
split them into six different chlorotypes. The ten known
markers are able to establish to which lineages the olive
varieties may correspond and to reconstruct their phylogeny with potential ancestors, while the new markers
should allow to break down cultivated olives into new
chlorotypes and to finely assign them to different

Mariotti et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/211

lineages within the Mediterranean O. europaea complex.
These markers could provide a valuable contribution to
understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes
involved in olive domestication as well as to increase
the knowledge about the function of plastid genes on
plant metabolism.
They could be used to screen olive genotypes, to
assess the chlorotype distribution among cultivars and
to better determine their phylogenetic relationships with
the wild populations as well as with other O. europaea
subspecies. This could help reconstruct the origin of the
cultivated olive and to determine the timeline involved
in the distribution of chlorotypes from traditional varieties throughout the Mediterranean region.
Most of these polymorphisms showed a high level of
reorganization among cultivars, particularly in the intergenic regions such as psaA-ycf3, rps2-rpoC2 and trnSGCU-trnG-UCC. This observation demonstrates that
after rearrangements occurred within the plastid genome, these changes were fixed and maintained within
cultivars by vegetative propagation. The putative functional role that these mutations may play in modifying
the metabolism of olive cultivars and in developing
adaptations to the environment, will also represent a
further contribution to understanding the genetic background of the olive, providing insights into the evolution
of plant phenotypes. The application of these polymorphisms as functional markers will also be considered.
Finally, these polymorphisms represent a new source
of markers for olive DNA barcoding to distinguish
between cultivars, for practical applications related to
DNA-based tracking of olive oil and the identification of
archaeological remains. One particular focus involves
their potential use in DNA tracking of food products
derived from the olive (e.g., olive oil and table olives),
based on the assumptions that: i) the high number of
chloroplasts per cell increases the probability that trace
amounts of DNA can be amplified from these food products; ii) their maternal origin excludes the risk that
DNA from pollinators would be amplified instead; iii)
the haploid chloroplast genome can produce cultivarspecific single signals.
The identification of 30 new polymorphic sites, most
of which are located in chloroplast regions previously
unexplored in cultivated O. europaea, demonstrates that
chloroplast variation in olive cultivars is higher than
expected and that new chlorotypes could be discovered
through the analysis of a larger number of cultivars.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction

For the plastome sequence analysis, leaves of cv. Frantoio were collected from the accession present at the
CRA-OLI olive cultivars collection (Collececco, Spoleto).

Page 10 of 13

For the detection of intervarietal polymorphisms, a
subset of eight cultivars was used, chosen among 30 cultivars pre-selected on the basis of their haplotypes for
the intergenic trnS-GCU - trnG-UCC spacer (Table 4).
Total DNA was extracted by the DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequencing strategy: primer design and PCR
amplification

Sequencing of the olive plastome was performed by
designing a series of PCR primer pairs that produced
partially overlapping amplicons and spanned the entire
chloroplast genome.
For the Large Single Copy (LSC) region, 38 primer
pairs located within conserved regions and designed by
Grivet et al. [34] were used, avoiding gaps between successive fragments along the cpDNA molecule. Five primer pairs (5-14-22-27-38) produced double bands, and
two (16-28) did not produce any amplification. Thus,
new primers for those regions were constructed, following the strategy used for the amplification of the IR and
SSC regions. For primer sequences see Additional File 1,
Table S2.
For the SSC and the IR regions, primers were constructed from conserved sequences derived by the alignment of the plant chloroplast genomes of Jasminum
nudiflorum (DQ673255), Populus tricocharpa (EF489041),
Vitis vinifera (DQ424856), Eucaliptus globulus
(AY780259), Arabidopsis thaliana (AP000423), Gossypium
hirsutum (DQ345959), Citrus sinensis (DQ864733), Cucumis sativus (AJ970307), Morus indica (DQ226511), Panax
ginseng (AY582139), Solanum lycopersicum (AM087200)
and Nicotiana tabacum (Z00044). These sequences were
retrieved from GenBank and aligned using Muscle V. 3.7
[47], and the primers were designed using PerlPrimer
v1.1.6 [48]. Because the average size of the amplified fragments was approximately 2,500 bp, internal primers
to sequence the entire amplicons were also designed.
The primer sequences and positions, along with their
respective amplicon lengths, are given in Additional File 1,
Table S1.
PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of
50 μL containing 1-20 ng of template DNA, 10× PCR buffer, 200 μM of each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer and 2
U of EuroTaq polymerase (EuroClone). For those fragments that were longer than 5,000 bp, 1 unit of LA Taq
polymerase (TaKaRa) was used instead. The amplifications
were performed with the PCR System 9600 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 25 sec and a final elongation step of 72°C for
30 min. For those amplifications including LA Taq

Mariotti et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/211

polymerase in the PCR mix, the following cycling conditions were used instead: an initial denaturation step of 94°
C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 60 s and 68°
C for 10 min and a final extension step of 72°C for 10
min. Negative controls (no template DNA) were included
in all experiments.
The PCR products were checked by electrophoresis on
2% agarose gels, then purified with the JetQuick PCR
purification kit (Genomed) and directly sequenced in
both directions using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator
V.3.1 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems) on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems-Hitachi). The sequences were assembled
using BioEdit v7.0.9 software (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad,
CA).
The DOGMA program [49] was used for the initial
genome annotation, which was then manually refined
using Artemis version 11 [50] and NCBI Blast searches.
The annotation of tRNA genes was checked using
tRNAscan version 1.21 [51]. The genome map was generated using OGDRAW software V. 1.0 [52].
Evaluation of repeat structures

Msatfinder v. 2.0.9 [53] was used to identify simple
sequence repeats (SSR), with the following settings: a
six-repeat threshold for mono-nucleotide SSRs, a fiverepeat threshold for di- and tri-nucleotide SSRs and a
three-repeat threshold for tetra-, penta- and esa-nucleotide
SSRs. The SSR density in the different regions of the
chloroplast genome was calculated by dividing the number
of SSRs by the length of the given region. Interspersed
repeats were identified with REPuter [54] by setting the
minimum repeat size to 30 bp and the Hamming distance
to 3. The presence and distribution of the repetitive element were verified manually using Artemis and computationally by performing an intragenomic Blast search. For
this purpose, the sequence was interrogated using a local
installation of NCBI Blast and a Blast database created
with formatDB software http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
staff/tao/URLAPI/wwwblast/.
Identification of polymorphic regions among olive
cultivars

To identify sequence polymorphisms, the following
potentially variant domains were tested: i) regions containing mono-, di-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide microsatellites; ii) regions previously reported as polymorphic
among Olea subspecies, iii) regions containing high
sequence variations among 12 species (see materials and
methods for chloroplast sequencing strategy); iv) barcoding regions previously identified for species discrimination that had never been tested in olive cultivars; and v)
plastid ESTs derived from massive sequence analyses of
fruit cDNAs [55].

Page 11 of 13

Candidate SSRs were selected among those having the
highest number of repeats (Table 1 and Figure 2).
Although no mono-nucleotide SSRs with repeats shorter
than 10 bp were considered, some were indirectly
included in the analyses of other regions.
PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume
of 25 μl containing 25 ng of template DNA, 2,5 μl of
10 × PCR buffer, 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 1 μM of each
primer and 1.5 U/μl of PerfectTaq DNA Polymerase
(5-PRIME). The amplifications were run on a thermal
cycler Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf) using the
same conditions as previously indicated for plastid
sequencing.
After an initial evaluation by electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel, amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator V.3.1
Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit and run on an
ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied BiosystemsHitachi).
The sequences of each region were aligned to evaluate
the presence of SNPs, indels or polymorphic microsatellites among the six cultivars. To use these polymorphisms as chloroplast markers able to distinguish olive
cultivars from each other, specific primers localizing
within conserved flanking regions were constructed
(Additional File 1, Table S1). The resulting fragments
ranged in size from 145 to 688 bp and could be amplified at an annealing temperature of 60°C. Some amplicons included from two to five polymorphisms. All 40
polymorphisms can be amplified by a set of 21 primer
pairs.
