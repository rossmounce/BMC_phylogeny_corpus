Abstract
Background: Brucella species include economically important zoonotic pathogens that can infect
a wide range of animals. There are currently six classically recognised species of Brucella although,
as yet unnamed, isolates from various marine mammal species have been reported. In order to
investigate genetic relationships within the group and identify potential diagnostic markers we have
sequenced multiple genetic loci from a large sample of Brucella isolates representing the known
diversity of the genus.
Results: Nine discrete genomic loci corresponding to 4,396 bp of sequence were examined from
160 Brucella isolates. By assigning each distinct allele at a locus an arbitrary numerical designation
the population was found to represent 27 distinct sequence types (STs). Diversity at each locus
ranged from 1.03–2.45% while overall genetic diversity equated to 1.5%. Most loci examined
represent housekeeping gene loci and, in all but one case, the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous change was substantially <1. Analysis of linkage equilibrium between loci indicated a
strongly clonal overall population structure. Concatenated sequence data were used to construct
an unrooted neighbour-joining tree representing the relationships between STs. This shows that
four previously characterized classical Brucella species, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. ovis and B.
neotomae correspond to well-separated clusters. With the exception of biovar 5, B. suis isolates
cluster together, although they form a more diverse group than other classical species with a
number of distinct STs corresponding to the remaining four biovars. B. canis isolates are located on
the same branch very closely related to, but distinguishable from, B. suis biovar 3 and 4 isolates.
Marine mammal isolates represent a distinct, though rather weakly supported, cluster within which
individual STs display one of three clear host preferences.
Conclusion: The sequence database provides a powerful dataset for addressing ongoing
controversies in Brucella taxonomy and a tool for unambiguously placing atypical, phenotypically
discordant or newly emerging Brucella isolates. Furthermore, by using the phylogenetic backbone
described here, robust and rationally selected markers for use in diagnostic assay development can
be identified.

Background
Members of the genus Brucella are causative agents of brucellosis, a widespread disease of various animal species,
and a common zoonotic infection of man [1]. While
some countries have eliminated or substantially reduced
the disease by extensive eradication programs it remains
endemic in many areas of the world [2]. There is thus a
substantial economic burden of brucellosis reflecting,
either the costs of attaining and maintaining disease free
status, or the cost of disease in terms of loss of productivity and control costs. Over many years Brucella taxonomists developed a classification system that recognized six
classical species based on subtle phenotypic and antigenic
differences and differential host specificity. Thus traditionally B. abortus (bovine), B. melitensis (caprine and
ovine), B. ovis (ovine), B. canis (canine), B. suis (porcine,
rangiferine, leporine) and B. neotomae (rodent) are recognised. Some of the classical species are divided into biovars although the distinction of some of these biovars is
based on very slight differences and can be difficult and
somewhat subjective. Multiple biovars of B. abortus, B.
melitensis and B. suis are recognized currently [3] although
the status of some biovars, particularly those of B. abortus,
remains unresolved.
The traditional view on Brucella taxonomy was challenged
some time ago on the basis of the high level of genetic
relatedness indicated by DNA hybridization experiments
[4]. This genetic conservation has since been confirmed by
a variety of approaches including multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) [5] and 16S rRNA sequencing [6].
Reflecting this, comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in three complete Brucella genome
sequences (representing three distinct classical species)
indicates mean diversity between genomes of around
0.22% [7]. It was proposed that only one species, Brucella
melitensis, should be recognized in the genus Brucella [3].
However, reflecting practical considerations, this option
has not found widespread support with most opting to
retain the nomenspecies designations. Formal moves to
reverse this decision were initiated recently [8]. In recent
years it has become clear that Brucella isolates are more
widely dispersed than originally thought with the identification of isolates in various marine mammal species [912]. These isolates appear distinct from those previously
seen in terrestrial mammals and diversity within this
group of isolates has been identified by a variety of
approaches [13,14]. As a result of these findings it has
been suggested that these isolates represent one or more
new Brucella species [11,15]. However, in part reflecting
the ongoing debate regarding Brucella nomenclature, the
new species designations have not yet been validly published and currently have no standing in bacterial taxonomy.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/34

The genetic conservation within Brucella has resulted in
past difficulties in establishing the true relationships
between some classical Brucella species and biovars and in
identifying molecular markers for some groups. For example, B. canis has long been considered very closely related
to B. suis on the basis of a number of approaches including chromosomal maps [16], omp profiling [17,18], MLEE
[5], AFLP [19] and insertion sequence typing [20] and its
status as a distinct species has been questioned. Similarly,
studies using AFLP and MLEE have indicated that B. suis
biovar 5 is distinct from other B. suis isolates [5,19] and
thus it is not clear whether there is justification for including B. suis biovar 5 in a taxonomic group with B. suis.
Indeed, the status of B. suis as a single species has been
questioned in light of a broader host specificity and
because, in contrast to other classical species, no speciesspecific markers for B. suis have been identified [21].
In recent years the sequencing of multiple genetic loci in
bacteria, usually but not exclusively housekeeping genes,
(multilocus sequence typing or MLST) has rapidly gained
acceptance as a tool for the characterization of microbial
populations. The approach has been applied widely to
microbial typing and epidemiological studies at both
local and global levels as well as generating data that is
ideal for studies of population structure and phylogenetic
relationships [22]. In light of the conserved nature of the
Brucella genomes MLST is likely to be of little value for
local epidemiological studies. Tools such as VNTR based
typing [23-25], indexing variation at more rapidly evolving markers, are likely to be far more informative in such
scenarios. However, the unambiguous and defined nature
of sequence typing is ideal to address the overall genetic
structure of the Brucella population and the development
of such a tool will provide a firm foundation on which to
address the outstanding taxonomic issues
The aim of this study was to determine the sequences of
multiple genetic loci in order to examine the relationships
between Brucella isolates representing a geographically,
and temporally, diverse collection of 160 isolates belonging to all the currently recognized classical Brucella species
and biovars. The availability of such an extensive and
unambiguous dataset facilitates a robust assessment of
relationships within and between the classical species and
biovars. It will also identify polymorphisms that are of
potential value as diagnostic markers and provide a preliminary validation of their distribution. Furthermore the
data generated in this study will help address some of the
issues raised by the ongoing debate on the taxonomy of
the group and will provide a database against which to
compare any new, emerging or atypical Brucella isolates.

Results
Choice of loci
We selected 9 distinct genomic fragments for characterization in this study. Seven of the nine selected loci represent
classic housekeeping genes of the type conventionally
used in MLST because accumulated changes occur slowly
and are believed to be selectively neutral (Table 1). The
remaining loci used are a fragment of omp25, encoding a
25 kDa outer membrane protein, included as a potentially
more variable surface marker that might facilitate discrimination between closely related classical species and a fragment, labelled int-hyp, that is largely intergenic though it
does include the extreme 5' of a hypothetical protein. As
shown in Table 1 the loci chosen are scattered around the
Brucella genomes and thus change at one locus should be
independent of other loci.
Diversity of housekeeping genes
In all 4,396 nucleotides spanning 9 loci were sequenced
from 160 isolates. For each isolate the sequences obtained
at each of the nine loci were compared with those of every
other isolate and sequences were designated distinct alleles if they differed at one or more nucleotide sites. Table 2
shows the sequence characteristics compiled from all 160
strains. The number of alleles detected ranges from 5 in
the case of int-hyp up to 10 in the case of glk and omp25.
The number of polymorphic sites present ranges from 5 in
gyrB (1.07%) and trpE (1.03%) up to 12 in omp25
(2.45%). The dN/dS ratio [dS = average frequency of synonymous substitutions per potential synonymous site; dN =
average frequency of nonsynonymous substitutions per
potential nonsynonymous site] was calculated to determine the degree of selection in the sequence population.
As expected in evolutionarily conserved genes the dN/dS

ratio is substantially <1 for all housekeeping genes except
glk (1.671). The dN/dS ratio for omp25 is also substantially
<1 (0.0161) while this calculation is not relevant in the
case of int-hyp as much of the sequence is intergenic. The
% GC content of the various loci ranges from 55.75% (inthyp) up to 62.67% (glk) in comparison to the overall
genomic GC content of approximately 57%.
Genetic relatedness of isolates
Each distinct allele at each locus identified by sequencing
was given an arbitrary numerical designation and each
unique allelic pattern over all nine loci was identified as a
sequence type or ST (Table 3). Overall 27 distinct STs were
identified. The positions of all polymorphisms that relate
to the 27 STs are shown in Fig. 1. The relationship
between STs was examined by constructing a neighbourjoining tree from the concatenated nucleotide sequences
of all 9 DNA fragments that comprised each ST (Fig. 2).
Examination of the unrooted phylogenetic tree shows that
STs fall into clusters that largely correspond to classical
taxonomic divisions. B. melitensis and B. abortus both fall
into well supported clusters although ST6 (corresponding
to the B. abortus biovar 3 reference strain Tulya) is divergent from the remaining B. abortus STs. There is no obvious relationship between biovar and ST in the case of B.
melitensis. There is some evidence of a possible relationship between biovars and ST in B. abortus but insufficient
numbers of most biovars were examined to reach firm
conclusions. Isolates of B. neotomae and B. ovis, both of
which were found to represent a clone by this approach
(i.e. a single ST) are both well separated from other
groups. The 46 marine mammal isolates examined in this
study fall into 5 STs that comprise a further cluster sepa-

rated from terrestrial Brucella isolates although this separation is supported by a bootstrap value of only 64%.
It is immediately apparent from examination of the tree
that the B. suis group appears rather genetically diverse in
comparison with other classical species groups. Thus,
there are 12 sites that are polymorphic within the B. suis
group (Table 4). In contrast no polymorphisms were
found in B. neotomae or B. ovis, 4 in the major B. abortus
cluster (i.e. excluding ST6), 5 in B. melitensis and 8 in the
marine mammal Brucella. However, all B. suis isolates
other than the B. suis biovar 5 reference strain, (ST19), do
comprise a distinct branch on the tree. In the case of B.
suis STs are biovar specific with the exception of ST17 that
consists of both biovar 3 and biovar 4 strains. There is
clear separation of these biovar specific STs into strongly
supported groups falling on this branch. Groups consist
of two biovar 2 STs, a single biovar 1 ST and two biovar 3
and/or 4 STs. Comparison of the tree and its component
sequence polymorphisms (Fig. 1) shows that biovars 3
and 4 are most closely related to biovar 1. Two B. canis
specific STs are located at the terminus of this branch.
These isolates differ from a B. suis biovar 3 and 4 ST
(ST17) by only 1 or 2 polymorphic sites both located in
omp25 (Fig. 1)
Assessment of recombination
An assessment of the linkage between alleles from the different loci was performed in order to determine whether
there is evidence for extensive recombination in the Brucella population (Table 5). Standardized IA (sIA) values
were determined using the LIAN software program as this
statistic is independent of the number of loci analysed in
contrast to the originally described IA measure [26]. Standardized IA values are expected to be zero when a population is at linkage equilibrium (free recombination).
Determination of sIA first involves computing the number
of loci at which each pair of taxa differs. From the distribution of mismatch values a variance (Vo) is calculated.

This is compared with the variance expected for a population at linkage equilibrium (Ve) in order to derive measures of sIA. LIAN also tests the null hypothesis of statistical
independence of alleles (linkage equilibrium) at all loci
by computer simulation. Input data is scrambled by resampling loci without replacement and computing a Vo
value for each resampled dataset. The significance of any
difference between Ve and Vo is the frequency with which
a Vo value greater or equal to the original Vo value is
returned from the randomisation procedure. All analyses
were carried out using both all isolates in a group and
reduced to the level of STs (i.e. including only one isolate
from each ST) to avoid potential bias due to a possible
epidemic population structure.
When considering all 160 isolates the sIA was significantly
different from zero both when including all isolates, (sIA
= 0.2286 P = 0.001), and when analysis was reduced to the
level of all STs (sIA = 0.1954 P = 0.001). This is consistent
with evidence of strong linkage disequilibrium between
loci and a clonal population structure with little or no
recombination. Equally when the sIA was determined
individually for all isolates of B. abortus, B. melitensis, B.
suis and the marine mammal Brucella to test for evidence
of recombination within the classical species there was no
statistical evidence of recombination. However, the sIA
was reduced to close to zero and the null hypothesis was
supported poorly when considering STs alone in the case
of B. melitensis, B. suis and the marine mammal Brucella.
Though these values need to be treated cautiously as the
number of STs in each group is very low this might suggest
that there is some recombination within some of the classical Brucella species. The overall picture of a clonal population structure was supported by split decomposition
analysis performed on a matrix of pairwise distances
between the allelic profiles of all STs. This showed a radial
distribution of strains with a tree-like structure (data not
shown). The only evidence of network like structure,

Discussion
Brucella genetic diversity
The data presented in this study represent a comprehensive study of genetic diversity within Brucella and the first
application of multilocus sequencing to the group. Most
of the data derive from housekeeping genes where genetic
variation is considered largely neutral and thus such
markers are considered to provide more reliable indications of genetic relatedness than genes subject to strong
selection [27]. The availability of 4,396 bp of sequence
data from each of 160 strains representing nine independent loci gives an unequalled resource with which to begin
to understand the extent and nature of genetic diversity
within the group. Furthermore, these data will further
understanding of whether the traditional taxonomic designations of the group have a sound genetic basis and
serve as a platform to assist and direct future taxonomic
proposals. The use of multilocus sequence data has two
particular advantages. Clearly, and of particular relevance
in the case of a genetically conserved group such as Brucella, the additive use of multiple loci increases the discriminatory capacity compared to that that can be
obtained when using a single target. Secondly, loci can be

selected that are spaced far enough apart such that any
pairs of alleles are unlikely to be inherited together by
recombination. This is important as recombination can
distort the apparent relationships between similar isolates
if they are characterized at only a single locus. Thus studies
based on multilocus approaches that buffer against possible recombination are more desirable than the characterisation of individual loci. It was recently suggested that
such an approach should be applied by taxonomists to
large samples of groups of closely-related bacteria, and
especially to those where species delineation has historically been difficult, to determine whether genotypic clusters can be delineated, and to guide the definition of
species [28].
Overall only 67/4396 nucleotide sites (1.5%) examined
here are polymorphic equating to a variable site approximately every 66 bp. As expected, this is substantially more
than the diversity detected based on the comparison of
only three genomes [7] but still clearly indicates that the
Brucella group is genetically rather uniform. This is in
agreement with the recent observation based on genome
sequences of a highly conserved genomic backbone
within which species-specific DNA sequences and pseudogene distribution might correlate with different host
preferences [29]. Within individual housekeeping gene

Figure 1
Polymorphic sites detected at the nine loci examined in this study
Polymorphic sites detected at the nine loci examined in this study. All polymorphic sites are shown relative to the
ST1 sequence. Polymorphic sites are shown, while dots indicate nucleotides identical to ST1. The number of strains possessing
each ST is shown at the end of each sequence string while the status of each site as a potential synonymous or non-synonymous change is shown by S or N respectively. The numbers above the gene designations represent the base number in the
4,396 bp concatenated sequence.

loci diversity ranges from as little as 1.03% in trpE up to
2.32% in glk a level only marginally less than that seen in
the outer membrane protein encoding fragment omp25
(2.45%). Nucleotide substitutions in genes coding for
proteins can be either synonymous (do not change amino
acid) or non-synonymous (change amino acid). Usually,
most non-synonymous changes are expected to be eliminated by purifying selection, but under certain conditions
Darwinian selection may lead to their retention. Therefore
investigating the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions provides information about the
degree of selection operating on a system. As housekeeping genes are considered to undergo change that is selectively neutral or be subject to purifying selection the rate
of synonymous change (dS) should be equal or greater
than that of non-synonymous change (dN) giving a dN/dS
ratio of <1. For 6 of the 7 housekeeping genes fragments
examined in this study this is the case. However the ratio
for glk is 1.671 suggesting that this gene fragment may be
subject to positive Darwinian selection. Interestingly this
fragment is by far the most variable of the housekeeping
fragments and also has a GC content of 62.67% representing the fragment furthest removing from the genome aver-

age of 57%. The reasons for the evidence for selection
operating on glk are unclear – it is possible that this gene
may somehow influence pathogenic potential, transmissibility or tissue tropism. Alternatively this finding may
reflect a hitchhiking effect where change at a locus subject
to selection can drive change in neighbouring genes that
are not themselves subject to selection [30]. The omp25
fragment encodes a surface marker potentially subject to
selection. However, although it is the most variable fragment examined, most change in this gene appears synonymous and the dN/dS ratio is among the lowest apparent
in this study.
The availability of multilocus sequence data enables an
assessment of the extent of genetic recombination to be
made by examining linkage equilibrium in a population.
This not only gives an indication of the process of evolution in the group but also allows an assessment of
whether meaningful phylogenetic interpretations can be
made from multilocus sequence data. Analysis of linkage
equilibrium in the complete population examined here
was consistent with a clonal population structure with little or no recombination. This finding gives confidence in

restricted by ecological isolation.

[28]. Although the figure of <97% identity in 16S rRNA
sequences is often quoted as a cut-off between species
pragmatic definitions have led to situation where the
extant genetic diversity in different species differs greatly
[32]. Clearly, on the basis of both DNA-DNA hybridization and the 97% 16S rRNA sequence diversity cut-off, all
Brucella could validly be considered members of a single
species. However, equally the dendrogram constructed on
the basis of concatenated sequence data (Fig. 2) does
clearly separate most of the classically identified species
on a genetic basis, albeit with low levels of diversity
between clusters. Thus, there is clear separation of B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. ovis, and B. neotomae into well defined
clusters or clones and therefore their identification as separate classical species does appear valid on both grounds
of genetic separation and host specificity. The one possible exception here is the B. abortus biovar 3 reference
strain Tulya (ST6) that branches off very early on the
branch to all other B. abortus isolates. This isolate has previously been shown to be atypical relative to other B. abortus by VNTR analysis [24]. Interestingly, two distinct

Implications for Brucella taxonomy
The traditional taxonomic designations of Brucella are in
large part based on the apparent host specificity of the
nomenspecies. As moves are ongoing to reverse the decision to define Brucella as a single species [8] and to formalize the taxonomic position of marine mammal Brucella
the data described here will allow informed decisions to
be to made that reflect genetic relationships as well as phenotypic properties and host associations. The definition of
bacterial species is a subject of constant debate [31]. The
gold standard approach is a 70% DNA-DNA hybridization cut-off though this method is infrequently used
today. Most designations are based on 16S rRNA
sequences though these are highly conserved with insufficient resolution to explore closely related populations

groups of B. abortus biovar 3 isolates were recently
described [33], one of which corresponds to Tulya, while
the other corresponds to local field isolates from Spain.
The situation with B. suis and B. canis is more complex. B.
suis has long been considered to be a more diverse group
of organisms than other classical Brucella species and this
is confirmed by the branch lengths within the B. suis cluster seen here (Fig. 2). The status of B. suis biovar 5 as a bona
fide B. suis isolate has been questioned. In support of this
the reference strain does not cluster with other B. suis isolates on the basis of sequence data described here and
appears more closely related to the marine mammal Brucella. The B. suis biovar 5 ST (ST19) has only two polymorphisms relative to the closest marine mammal ST (ST25)
while there are five polymorphisms relative to the closest
B. suis ST (ST15 – biovar 2). Isolates of the remaining four
B. suis biovars do fall into a single branch. In contrast to
B. melitensis there is clear separation of the distinct B. suis
biovars (with the exception of biovars 3 and 4 that could
not be separated by this approach). Thus, the phylogenetic tree generated here does support the classification of
B. suis biovars 1–4 in a single species. There have been
arguments for subdividing this group on the basis of distinct host specificities. This might be problematic from
two aspects. Firstly the overlapping host specificities of B.
suis biovars 1, 2, and 3, associated with pigs, makes separation on this basis difficult. Secondly, although there
would be grounds on the basis of host specificity for separating B. suis biovar 4 which appears confined to rangifers, this biovar is genetically very closely related to B. suis
biovar 1 being separated by only 2–3 polymorphisms.
However, and conversely, if the same criteria were applied
to B. suis biovar 4 as to B. canis, an argument could be
made in favour of its classification as a separate species. B.
canis has long been known to be closely related to B. suis
[34] although its host specificity appears virtually absolute. This study confirms the close relationship of B. canis
with B. suis biovar 3 and 4 isolates from which it differs at
only 1 or 2 polymorphic sites both located in the omp25
fragment.
This study also allows us to address the ongoing debate
surrounding the taxonomy of the recently discovered
marine mammal Brucella. Following early observations
that marine mammal strains varied both phenotypically
and molecularly from other Brucella and within the
'group' [11,13,15,35-38] a number of controversial names
that failed to follow the monospecific classification system were proposed. Initially a single marine mammal species, B. maris, was proposed [11]. Later, division into two
species representing isolates originating from porpoises,
dolphins and minke whales (B. cetaceae) and seals (B. pinnipediae) was proposed based on polymorphism at omp2
[15]. It was later acknowledged that a narrower host range

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/34

may exist than that suggested by the omp2 locus [21]. In
support of this genome profiling led to a suggestion that
three distinct groups of marine mammal Brucella characteristic of dolphins, porpoises and seals should be recognized [39]. Our study confirms that the marine mammal
Brucella do form a cluster distinct from all other species
(Fig. 2) on the basis of the sequence data presented here.
However, bootstrap support for this group is rather low
and more data are required to confirm this clustering.
While somewhat more diverse than B. abortus (excluding
ST6) and B. melitensis, the marine mammal group has a
similar level of 'intragroup' diversity as B. suis biovars 1–
4. On this basis classification within a single species might
be justified. However, this study also strongly supports the
division into three groups with clearly distinct, though
not absolute, host specificities (Table 3). Thus, in the
extensive collection of marine mammal isolates sampled
here, ST23 is strongly associated with porpoises (75% of
isolates), ST26 is associated only with dolphins, and ST25,
and its single locus variant ST24, are strongly associated
with seals (80% of isolates). Although the sequence distances between these groups are small (e.g. ST 25 and
ST26 differ by only two polymorphisms) if the criteria
applied for B. canis speciation were applied here (i.e. speciation on the basis of distinct host specificity rather than
substantial genetic separation) these groups could justifiably be classified as three distinct species. In this scenario
the status of the remaining marine mammal ST, ST27,
would remain unresolved. Although it appears genetically
most closely related to ST25 the natural host of this ST is
unclear. We found ST27 only twice, once in a bottlenose
dolphin isolate [9], and once in a human infection where
the source was not obvious [40].
Intraspecies diversity and species-specific markers
The number of intraspecies polymorphisms detected and
the presence of species-specific polymorphisms is shown
in Table 4. Both B. neotomae and B. ovis represent a single
clone in this study. The B. neotomae situation may simply
reflect the paucity of available isolates representing this
classical species but the B. ovis population used was more
extensive and obtained globally. The lack of diversity in B.
ovis relative to other classical Brucella species reflects
recent findings by PFGE [41] and VNTR analysis [24]. As
already discussed, if one excludes B. abortus Tulya, B. suis
is the most diverse of the remaining classical species with
biovars corresponding to STs. In contrast only a single
polymorphism was detected within B. canis isolates. The
remaining groups comprising B. abortus, B. melitensis and
the marine mammal Brucella have between 4 and 8
'intraspecies' polymorphisms. There was no clear relationship between biovar and ST within B. melitensis. This finding is in agreement with observations based on multiple
VNTR typing approaches where there appears not to be a
strong correlation between genotype and biovar [24,25].

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:34

This suggests either that B. melitensis biovars do not correspond to true genetic groups, or that biotyping is so subjective that isolates are often incorrectly assigned masking
any genetic relationship. B. melitensis biovars are notoriously difficult to distinguish as they are technically only
serovars and thus their identification is particularly
dependent on well trained staff and well-controlled preparation of monospecific sera. In contrast there is evidence
that some B. abortus STs correspond to particular biovars
but a much more extensive intraspecies study will be
undertaken to fully assess this.
Species-specific markers in Brucella have sometimes been
difficult to identify and for many years this hampered the
development of molecular diagnostics. Recently Moreno
et al. [21] noted that while the presence of various markers
uncovered in recent years support the validity of host
range as a criterion for defining Brucella species no species
specific marker for B. suis in omp genes or elsewhere had
been reported. As reported in Table 4 this study identified
at least one apparently species specific SNP in all classical
species except for B. suis. Thus, with further validation
above and beyond the 160 strains examined in this study
to confirm species-specificity, these SNPs represent potentially valuable diagnostic markers. While no species specific SNPs for B. suis were uncovered this in part reflects
the fact that the classical species groupings are not entirely
consistent with genetic groups. There are two SNPs that
are specific to the major B. suis/B.canis genetic group
(dnaK-1928; gyrB-2471). These SNPs are not present in B.
suis biovar 5 reflecting the fact that this ST does not lie
within the B. suis/B canis genetic group. In addition these
SNPs are shared with B. canis, reflecting the position of B.
canis as a terminal branch in the B. suis group. However,
B. canis can be differentiated from B. suis by the presence
of its own species specific SNP (Table 4).

Conclusion
The data presented here have broad implications both in
understanding the genetic diversity of the Brucella group
and generating a robust taxonomic description, and in the
development of potentially useful diagnostic tools. The
scheme provides the basis for more extensive sampling of
the Brucella group so that population diversity can be
more fully estimated and isolates assigned to existing or
new lineages. Clearly there are inconsistencies in the current taxonomy. We believe the data presented here will
help generate discussion in this area and assist in resolving these issues. A strong argument could undoubtedly be
made for reclassifying B. canis as an additional B. suis biovar, particularly given that the existing biovars already
have distinct host specificities. B. suis biovar 5 could justifiably be removed from this group. The marine mammal
isolates could be classified as a single species, but divided
into subtypes corresponding to the host-specific STs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/34

described here or alternatively be classified as three distinct species on grounds of both (limited) genetic separation and apparent distinct host specificity. The existing
classical species designations for B. abortus, B. neotomae, B.
ovis, and B. melitensis appear genetically valid although the
status of strain Tulya as an appropriate B. abortus biovar 3
reference strain needs investigation.
Clearly sequencing of the nine fragments described here is
a potentially valuable tool for the identification of
unknown Brucella isolates to classical species and/or biovar level the value of which can only increase as we add
additional data to the extensive database already in place.
Ongoing work is extending this database by both
sequencing more targets to identify additional markers
(particularly at the biovar level) and sequencing additional strains (particularly B. abortus and B. melitensis) in
order to clarify, in conjunction with ongoing VNTR based
studies [24], the relationships between genotype and biovar. Furthermore, the database provides a framework for
placing any new or emerging Brucella groups in relation to
current knowledge.
Finally, while sequencing the nine loci offers an excellent
way of categorising Brucella isolates it is somewhat tedious
and is not always a practical option. This study has identified a large number of well-defined species-specific markers, potentially useful for the development of diagnostic
assays, that would avoid the need for such sequencing.
The SNPs identified here have a number of advantages for
use in such assays. As Brucella represents such a conserved
group, and as most of the targets described here are housekeeping genes, SNPs are likely to have occurred only once
in evolution. Equally, they are unlikely to mutate to new
states or back to their ancestral state. Therefore, the phylogenetic framework presented here facilitates the confident selection of SNPs that define particular classical
species, biovars or other groups. Assays based on these
SNPs, that could offer a practical, robust and unambiguous alternative to biotyping, are under development in
our laboratory and will be described elsewhere.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
A total of 160 isolates of Brucella were examined in this
study. These represented all currently recognized classical
species and biovars of Brucella (including all type strains
and biovar reference strains) as well as an extensive collection of marine mammal isolates. The remaining sample
was made up of field isolates from diverse hosts and geographic sources. Isolates were biotyped following standard procedure [42] although in some cases biovar
designations reflect those provided by original strain suppliers. Templates for the PCR were prepared as described
previously [24].

PCR and sequencing
Nine distinct genome fragments were amplified by PCR
using the primers shown in Table 1. PCR reaction mixes
were prepared for each sample by mixing 5 μl FastStart
10× PCR Buffer with MgCl2 (Roche), 5 μl 2 mM dNTPs,
0.2 μl of each primer (at 100 pmol/μl), 0.25 μl of FastStart
Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and 39 μl of water. Routinely 0.5 μl of methanol extract or diluted genomic DNA
was used as template. Cycling parameters were as follows:
94°C for 5 min. followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min.,
53°C for 1 min. and 72°C for 1 min. and a polishing step
of 72°C for 10 min. Products were separated by agarose
gel electrophoresis to check for efficiency of amplification
and to ensure that only a single product of the expected
size (1) was present. PCR products were then purified by
passage through QiaQuick PCR purification columns
(Qiagen) and sequenced from either end using the same
forward and reverse primers as used in initial PCR amplification. The Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) was used according to
manufacturers instructions.
Computer analysis of data
Sequence data was edited using the Lasergene package –
manual editing was performed in the Editseq module
while the SeqMan module was used to generate contigs
from the forward and reverse sequences. Each distinct
allele at each of the nine loci examined was given a distinct arbitrary numerical designation and each unique
allelic pattern over all nine loci was identified as a
sequence type (ST). Allelic profiles and sequence data
were imported into the START package [43] to determine
mean % GC content. The same package was used to calculate the average frequencies of synonymous substitutions
per potential synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous
substitutions per potential nonsynonymous site (dN) by
the method of Nei and Gojobori [44] in order to test the
degree of selection on a locus. The standardized IA (sIA), a
measure that scales according to the number of loci analysed was calculated in the LIAN3.1 program [45,46].
LIAN3.1 was also used to test the null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium. A representative strain of each genotype
(ST) was used for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences of the
nine loci were concatenated to produce a 4,396 bp
sequence for each genotype. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed with the MEGA software, Version 3.1 [47].
Neighbour joining trees were constructed using the JukesCantor model and the percentage bootstrap confidence
levels of internal branches were calculated from 1000
resamplings of the original data. Split decomposition
analysis [48] of allelic profile data was performed using a
web-based version of the SplitsTree program [49].
