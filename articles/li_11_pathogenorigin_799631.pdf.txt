Pathogen-origin horizontally transferred genes
contribute to the evolution of Lepidopteran
insects
Zi-Wen Li1, Yi-Hong Shen1, Zhong-Huai Xiang1 and Ze Zhang1,2*

Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a source of genetic variation, is generally considered to facilitate
hosts’ adaptability to environments. However, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of the
transferred genes to the evolution of metazoan recipients is rare.
Results: In this study, based on sequence data accumulated to date, we used a unified method consisting of
similarity search and phylogenetic analysis to detect horizontally transferred genes (HTGs) between prokaryotes and
five insect species including Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and
Apis mellifera. Unexpectedly, the candidate HTGs were not detected in D. melanogaster, An. gambiae and T.
castaneum, and 79 genes in Ap. mellifera sieved by the same method were considered as contamination based on
other information. Consequently, 14 types of 22 HTGs were detected only in the silkworm. Additionally, 13 types of
the detected silkworm HTGs share homologous sequences in species of other Lepidopteran superfamilies,
suggesting that the majority of these HTGs were derived from ancient transfer events before the radiation of
Ditrysia clade. On the basis of phylogenetic topologies and BLAST search results, donor bacteria of these genes
were inferred, respectively. At least half of the predicted donor organisms may be entomopathogenic bacteria. The
predicted biochemical functions of these genes include four categories: glycosyl hydrolase family, oxidoreductase
family, amino acid metabolism, and others.
Conclusions: The products of HTGs detected in this study may take part in comprehensive physiological
metabolism. These genes potentially contributed to functional innovation and adaptability of Lepidopteran hosts in
their ancient lineages associated with the diversification of angiosperms. Importantly, our results imply that
pathogens may be advantageous to the subsistence and prosperity of hosts through effective HGT events at a
large evolutionary scale.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a process in which
exogenic DNA is introduced and integrated into a recipient genome. Any fraction of genetic materials can be
transferred in general, but in fact, most persistently
fixed sequences are transposable elements, functional
genes and some regulatory sequences [1-4]. Transferred

genes, as a type of genetic change at the level of “harbour or not”, increase divergence between HGT recipients and their closely related species, which may result
in innovations or improvements to physiological metabolism and other phenotypes of the hosts [5-8]. HGT is
ubiquitous and abundant among prokaryotic organisms,
and it is a major source of genetic variation in prokaryotes [9,10]. Making use of foreign genetic materials,
microorganisms acquire novel functions to promote
their fitness to particular niches [9,11]. Thus, HGT
events among bacteria have biological significance for

the evolution of prokaryotic organisms [11-13]. Compared with transfer frequency and amount in bacteria,
HGT events among eukaryotes and between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes are rare, especially for multicellular
eukaryotes. This is partly attributed to the development
of nuclear membrane and predominance of sexual
reproduction in eukaryotic organisms [14-17]. Studies of
HGT related to multicellular eukaryotes are not as prevalent as that among prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. One reason is that contribution of HGT to the
evolution of metazoan recipients may be small because
of its rareness in multicellular eukaryotes. Nevertheless,
case studies on HGT revealed that some of the transferred genes effectively participated in the biochemical
metabolism and phenotypic divergence of multicellular
eukaryotic hosts, implying that HGT may also have biological importance in the functional evolution of
metazoan recipients [8,18-20]. Convincing evidence supporting this issue is still lacking.
HGT involved in insects and nematodes has been
intensively investigated [17]. Based on population size
and metabolic diversity, prokaryotes are considered as
the major donor organisms for eukaryotic recipients
[21]. Indeed, the majority of horizontally transferred
genes (HTGs) have been found from endosymbiont bacterial species, Wolbachia, to their host insects [22-25]. A
recent study also revealed that two pseudogenes in the
aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, were horizontally transferred from Buchnera aphidicola (an aphid intracellular
symbiotic bacterium) and four types of genes were
obtained from other microorganisms [26]. Additionally,
a fungal origin gene with function of carotenoid metabolism was found in the aphid genome [8]. In the silkworm, several HTGs were detected and their functions
have been studied in detail [18-20,27]. A more recently
study revealed 9 bacterial-origin HTGs in the silkworm
genome, which was published just after submission of
our manuscript [28]. These results indicated that insects
have capability to integrate foreign genetic sequences
into their genomes. In other words, HGT is also a way,
seldom adopted but mostly efficient, by which insects
can increase their genomic variation either from endosymbiont bacteria or from other microorganisms. Given
that insects may be potential recipients of a relatively
large amount of HTGs from microorganisms, a systematic study on insect HGT may help understand the contribution of HGT to the evolution of metazoan hosts.
Bioinformatics methods are commonly applied to
detect candidate HGT events at genomics era
[2,12,26,28,29]. The accumulated genome data of nearly
1000 bacteria and several insects make it possible to
computationally detect HGT between microorganisms
and insects at a genome level. Typical methods used for
HGT detection in eukaryotes include homology search,

analysis of sequence component and codon usage bias,
distribution of homologous sequences, and phylogenetic
analysis. These methods have different powers in revealing recent and ancient HGT events. In general, phylogenetic incongruity between a gene tree and the
corresponding species tree is the most credible indicator
of candidate transfer event in the detection of HGT
[15,30]. However, sequence sampling bias and unsuitable
tree-constructed methods may also result in incongruent
topologies and false positives [14,21,30-32]. To avoid the
false positives as far as possible, in this study, we not only
perform a comprehensive homology search in public data
to compensate for the sampling bias but also use three
independent methods to reconstruct phylogenetic trees
for each candidate HTG. In addition to taking efforts to
improve the efficiency and accuracy of detection method,
we employ a comparative strategy to detect HGT in the
five insects with available genome sequences, Drosophila
melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera, which belong to four
different insect orders. Furthermore, the annotation
information of their genomes is relatively abundant. We
try to reveal the general features of bacteria-insect transferred genes such as transfer amount, transfer time, possible donor, evolutionary process and predicted
functions. These general features will help understand
the contribution and biological significance of foreign
variations to the evolution of metazoan hosts.

Methods
Data collection

The predicted gene and protein sequence data of D.
melanogaster, Ap. mellifera, T. castaneum, An. gambiae,
and 994 prokaryotic organisms were downloaded from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) web site (as of December 2009). The prokaryotic
organisms include 926 eubacteria (22 classes, 621 species; Additional file 1) and 68 archaebacteria (5 classes,
59 species; Additional file 2). The predicted gene and
protein sequences of the silkworm, B. mori, were
obtained from Silkworm Genome Database (SilkDB)
web site (as of December 2009) [33]. The predicted
gene sets of 142 eukaryotic organisms with genome
sequences available, including protista, fungi, plants and
other animals, as well as some insects, were all downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) web site (as of March 2010; Additional file 3).
The species taxonomic information was obtained form
NCBI taxonomy data (as of March 2010).
Similarity search

Identification of similar sequences between insects and
prokaryotes is the initial step of HGT detection pipeline
and it includes three steps (Figure 1).

and identity value than the corresponding top bacteria
hit in blast-I, the insect sequence was deleted from candidate gene set because of its possible close relationship
to gene in other eukaryotic species rather than bacteria.
Insect sequences with no similar gene in other insects
were recovered as candidate sequences.
The third step is using blast-III to search for similar
sequences in species that their genome sequences are
not available. We performed online BLASTP searches
with the candidate genes querying the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence data which was separated into 7
species groups (eubacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, plants,
arthropods, non-arthropod metazoans, and others). The
thresholds used were E value ≤ 10 -3 , overlap value ≥
25% and identity value ≥ 25%. Hit sequences containing
the same protein domain(s) as the insect protein
sequence were also selected as similar sequence when
identity value ≤ 25%. The domain information was
obtained from the NCBI DTT database.
Phylogenetic analysis

Insect candidate HTGs and their similar sequences were
used to construct phylogenetic trees, and judging standard of HGT or non-HGT event was based on a previous study in which phylogenetic topology patterns
were particularly divided into 6 types to distinguish
HTGs and others [30]. There are two steps in this
section.
The first step is tree-I in which the phylogenetic trees
were constructed using sequences obtained in blast-III.
Similar sequences of each insect candidate gene were
aligned using MUSCLE 3.6 [35], then the pairwise distance-matrix of aligned protein sequences was computed
using PROTDIST program in PHYLIP 3.6 software
package [36], and finally BIONJ [37] was employed to
construct neighbor-joining (NJ) tree with the distancematrix. We checked the topology of each candidate
insect gene by hand using previous standard [30]. Insect
genes with obvious topologies of vertical gene transfer
were deleted. Remaining candidates, including genes
with phylogenetic tree of HGT type as well as genes
with complicated and disordered topologies in the simple NJ trees, were prepared for further analysis.
The second step is tree-II. We performed a detailed
phylogenetic analysis by hand based on genes selected
in tree-I. For the remaining candidate sequences,

Figure 1 Flowchart used in this detection. In similarity search, E,
O and I represent the E value, overlap value and identity value used
in BLAST searches. In phylogenetic analysis, C/D/E-type topology
represents non-HGT event and A/B/F-type topology represents HGT
event, which are based on a previous study [30].

The first step is blast-I. BLASTP search (BLAST 2.2.8)
was performed to detect similar sequences between each
insect (D. melanogaster, An. gambiae, B. mori, T. castaneum, and Ap. mellifera) and 994 bacteria with E value
≤ 10-40, overlap value ≥ 25% and identity value ≥ 25%
[34]. The initial bacteria-insect similar amino acid
sequence data were identified (Table 1).
The second step is blast-II. Genome-wide predicted
protein sequence data of other eukaryotic species with
available genome sequences were separated into 6 sets:
protista (29 species), fungi (48 species), plants (13 species), insects (22 species), non-insect arthropods (8 species), and non-arthropods metazoan (22 species). Using
obtained bacteria-insect similar sequences as queries
and BLASTP program with the same thresholds used in
blast-I, we estimated the distribution spectrum of bacteria-insect similar sequences in the 6 sets of species. If
there were more than two species in either of the 5 species sets (except for insect set) showing higher score

CLUSTALX 1.8 and MEGA 4.0 were used for NJ tree
reconstruction [38,39], and 1000 bootstrap replicates
were performed. For remaining genes with complicated
topologies in tree-I, we selected similar sequences or
sequence fragments for phylogenetic reconstruction with
the same method above. After tree-II, insect genes with
explicit topologies of HGT type were considered as the
candidate sequences (Table 1).

of BI trees were displayed in the result figures including
support values displayed in ML and NJ trees. In the silkworm, a bacterial species for which a HTG clustered
with its homolog can be considered as the corresponding candidate donor clearly. If there are a set of bacteria
for which a HTG clustered with their homologs, then,
the bacterium that lists in top of their BLAST hits is
considered as the donor.

Determination of HGT events

Results

Phylogenetic analyses in tree-I and tree-II were based on
amino acid sequences of online available data. In addition, we used the detected insect candidate HTGs to
query the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide sequences
data to check for other species containing similar
sequences of these HTGs, which might be missed in
blast-III. The genomic contaminant sequences are one
major cause of false positive in HGT detection. Information of GC content, intron number, chromosome location, EST (expressed sequence tag) sequence and
expression information of the candidate HTGs were all
analyzed to determine whether the detected candidates
are contaminations or genes in the insect genomes.
Thus, the candidate sequences through all the analyses
above are considered as HTGs between bacteria and
insect.

HGT events from bacteria were detected only in the
silkworm

Detecting direction and donor of HGT event

We used three methods, NJ, Bayesian inference (BI), and
maximum likelihood (ML), to construct more refined
phylogenetic trees of the detected candidates for the
purpose of inferring the directions and possible donors
of HGT events. For each candidate, we selected representative homologous sequences from species sets of
bacteria, protista, fungi, plants and metazoan based on
NJ trees constructed in tree-I and tree-II. Their protein
domain regions were predicted in Pfam online services
subsequently. Multiple alignments of the reduced amino
acid sequences with domain regions were performed in
CLUSTALX 1.8 and MUSCLE 3.6, and the results were
checked by vision. ProtTest 2.4 was used to select a substitution model for tree construction for each HTGs at
first [40]. WAG+gamma+Inv model was selected for all
the HTGs. The Bayesian inference trees were constructed using MRBAYES 3.1.2 with WAG+invgamma
model and 20000-1500000 generations were performed
until the values of average standard deviation of split
frequencies were stably below 0.01, then proper proportions of “burnin generations” were deleted to acquire
topologies [41]. PhyML 3.0 was performed to construct
the maximum likelihood (ML) trees and model of WAG
+gamma+Inv was used [42]. MEGA 4.0 was used to
construct NJ trees with JTT+gamma model and 1000
bootstrap resampling replicates [39]. Finally, topologies

With the pipeline of similarity search and phylogenetic
analysis, we found 22 silkworm genes and 79 honeybee
genes that are the candidate HTGs between insects and
bacteria (Table 1). Unexpectedly, no candidate was
detected in the fly, mosquito, and beetle in this study
(Table 1). In the honeybee, none of the 79 genes has a
corresponding EST sequence based on public sequence
data, chromosomal location information, a neighboring
gene in the sequencing fragment or a homologous
sequence in the genome of wasp (another Hymenoptera
insect) [43]. Additionally, the amino acid sequence identities between these genes and their top BLAST hits in
bacteria are high (the average value is 69.5% with the
highest 96.1% and the lowest 47.1%). The above features
prompt us to doubt the existence of the 79 genes in the
honeybee genome. Based on available sequence data, the
most acceptable explanation for this question is that
these 79 sequences may be genomic contaminations primarily coming from prokaryotes. However, 44 of these
79 sequences were predicted as the honeybee genes in
the official gene set (OGS) downloaded from BeeBase in
version of release 2 [44]. These genes were listed in
Additional file 4 and were not included in the following
analyses because of their uncertainty of genetic origin.
In the silkworm, 14 types of 22 genes were detected as
the candidate HTGs (Table 2). The phrase “type of
gene” refers to a transferred event, because a transferred
gene may or may not duplicate in the recipients genome
after its transfer. All previously revealed silkworm HTGs
including 9 bacterial-origin HT genes in Zhu et al.’s
result are included in our results [18-20,27,28]. Twenty
one candidates were mapped in the silkworm chromosomes by SilkMap (a tool in SilkDB) [33], except for
BGIBMGA005696. Ten of 22 candidates have EST evidence while 4 candidates (BGIBMGA005555,
BGIBMGA005696,
BGIBMGA007146
and
BGIBMGA008709) were cloned in individual studies. In
addition, 21 genes have expression information in the B.
mori Microarray Database (BmMDB) [45] except for
BGIBMGA00011200 (Table 2, Figure 2). Furthermore,
13 types of candidates have homologous sequences in
other Lepidopteran insects except for BGIBMGA009498

homologous genes identified in blast-I, then the mean
value was estimated, 10,000 replications), and there are 7
averages larger than 50.36% in the 10,000 random sampling results (P < 0.0007; Additional file 7). This suggested that HTGs are more similar to their bacterial
homologs than vertically transferred genes. All of the
detected candidates are intron-free genes, which is a
trace of the bacteria-origin transferred genes. Simulations
based on intron number of these 1176 genes (116 genes
without intron) indicated that it is impossible to extract a
group of intron-free genes (14 or 22 genes are randomly
sampled each time) in 10,000 times of simulations (P <
0.0001). Thus, the detected 14 types of 22 genes should
be HTGs between prokaryotes and silkworm.
Among the 14 types of detected silkworm HTGs, the
functions of BmSuc (BGIBMGA005555 and
BGIBMGA005696), BmKynu (BGIBMGA007146) and
BmChi-h (BGIBMGA008709) were previously

Additionally, BGIBMGA005615, BGIBMGA007766 type,
BGIBMGA010285 type and BGIBMGA011199 type all
have the conserved catalytic residues and/or cofactor
bonding domains based on available crystal structure
information of their bacterial homologs, except for
BGIBMGA008215 whose substrate recognizing motifs
were replaced (Additional file 6, Figure S3, S5, S6, S8
and S9) [47-52]. The remaining 6 types of the detected
HTGs all have transcription evidence in BmMDB (Figure 2). Thus, the detected 14 types of silkworm HTGs
are active genes in the host.
The silkworm HTGs have homologs in other Lepidopteran
insects

Previous studies indicated BmSuc (BGIBMGA005555
and BGIBMGA05696) and BmChi-h (BGIBMGA008709)
have homologous genes in other Lepidopteran insects
[18,53]. Using the detected 14 types of silkworm HTGs

as queries, we searched for their homologous sequences
in other Lepidopteran insects (Figure 3, Additional file
5). Homologous sequences of each type of genes were
used to construct phylogenetic trees with bacterial
sequences in Additional file 6, respectively. The Lepidopteran sequences clustered with the silkworm HTGs
as monophyletic group are considered as homologous
sequences of the silkworm HTGs. We found that homologs of the detected HTGs are widely distributed in the
Ditrysia insects rather than only in the silkworm except
for BGIBMGA009498. Thus, the majority of them are
not HTGs between bacteria and silkworm as previously
thought, instead, they are bacterial genes fixed into the
ancient Lepidopteran insect genomes (Figure 4 and 5).
There are 4 hierarchies in Figure 3 based on the phylogenetic relationships of Lepidopteran superfamilies. The
first group is BGIBMGA008215 and BGIBMGA013995,
which have homologs only in Bombycoidea; the second

In fact, the distribution pattern of homologous
sequences shown in Figure 3 not only depends on the
real transfer time and evolutionary process of Lepidopteran HTGs, but also is affected by the extent and abundance degree of sequence data accumulated in public
database. Most of sequences in Figure 3 are ESTs downloaded from NCBI and ButterflyBase [54], thus we analyzed the components of NCBI EST data based on the
major taxonomical groups of Lepidoptera. Consequently,
in NCBI, there are 309,472 EST sequences in silkworm,
70,920 in Bombycoidea (excluding the silkworm ESTs),
166,569 in Noctuoidea, 163,963 in Papilionoidea, 21,208
in Pyraloidea, 79,438 in Tortricoidea, and 920 in Tineoidea. In total, 814,135 ESTs of Lepidopteran insects have
been accumulated in NCBI, 99.8% of which belong to
Ditrysia group. And this ratio is consistent with that
98% of extant Lepidopteran insect species are ascribed
to Ditrysia group [55]. It is clear from these data that
sequence number in Pyraloidea or Tortricoidea is less
than half of that in Noctuoidea or Papilionoidea, which
may reduce the detected distribution range of genes in
the second and third groups (BGIBMGA000070,
BGIBMGA002521 and BGIBMGA010285) in Figure 3.
The distribution of homologous sequences for an HTG
provides primary evidence to roughly infer its transfer
time, at least lower bounnd on the time. Considering
the effect of less sequence data for Pyraloidea and Tortricoidea, the tendency in Figure 3 is that at least 10
types of genes (including genes in the second and third
groups) may come from relatively distant HGT events
which are traced back to the ancestor of Bombycoidea
and Tortricoidea insects, and 3 types (BGIBMGA0
08215, BGIBMGA009498 and BGIBMGA013995) limited in Bombycoidea may come from relatively recent
events. Thus, most of these genes may be introduced
into Lepidoptera before radiation of Ditrysia or Apoditrysia group.
There is an exceptional case in the similarity search
based on ESTs. BGIBMGA012123 contains homologs in
Bombycoidea, Papilionoidea and Noctuoidea in Lepidopteran insects (Figure 3). Unexpectedly, three ESTs
belonging to three different non-insect arthropods (Folsomia candida, EV479859; Ixodes scapularis,
EW883321; Tetranychus urticae, GT984060) are similar
to BGIBMGA012123. The corresponding phylogenetic
analysis indicated that these three ESTs and
BGIBMGA012123 formed a monophyletic group that
clustered within bacteria. If these three ESTs are reliable, there may be gene loss events in other insect
orders. However, there is another hypothesis that this
type of gene would be acquired in ancestor of arthropods and it was lost in most of insect orders except for
Lepidoptera. It is also possible that this gene was independently transferred into Lepidoptera and those

Page 9 of 15

arthropods, respectively. As a candidate HGT, this gene
was also used in following analysis.
The majority of the predicted donors are
entomopathogenic bacteria

After constructing phylogenetic trees for 11 types of
silkworm HTGs (Additional file 6, Figure S1 to S11), the
donors of these genes were predicted (Table 3).
We found that there are 2 donor bacteria in class
Alphaproteobacteria of phylum Proteobacteria, 6 donors
in class Gammaproteobacteria of phylum Proteobacteria,
and 4 belonging to class Bacilli of phylum Fimicutes
(Table 3). Bacteria in four genera (Serratia, Photorhabdus, Pseudomonas and Bacillus) are the major source of
pathogenic microorganisms which induce diseases of
bacterial septicemia, toxinosis, and intestinal disease for
Lepidopteran insects and other insects [56-61]. The
virulent protein of Enterococcus faecalis V583 is a lethal
protein to the Lepidopteran insect, indicating that it
may be also an entomopathogenic bacterium [62,63].
BGIBMGA012123 clustered with Methylobacterium
radiotolerans JCM 2831, which is also the top BLAST
hit species, and most of Methylobacterium species are
plant symbiotic bacteria [64,65].
The prokaryotes used in this study include nearly one
thousand of organisms (994 organisms in 680 species),
which is just a small sample of the prokaryotic population in biosphere. Thus, we analyzed the species components of the 994 bacterial genomes with the purpose of
simply estimating the effect of the sample component
on the donor inference. There are 315 species (46.3% of
680 species) of 486 organisms (48.9% of 994 organisms)
in phylum Proteobacteria and 99 species (14.6%) of 184
organisms (18.5%) in phylum Fimicutes, which constitute two primary parts of bacterial organisms used. In
the data, class Gammaproteobacteria contains 125 species (18.4%) of 236 organisms (23.7%) and class Bacilli
contains 63 species (9.3%) of 133 organisms (13.4%),
and the proportions of them are still large. It is known
that Proteobacteria is the largest phylum in bacteria
(more than 40% published bacterial genera belong to it),
and Gammaproteobacteria is the largest class in Proteobacteria. Generally, species component of 994 genomes
used in this study corresponds to the real component of
bacteria phylum in some extent. Therefore, donor
results at phylum and class level are normal and reasonable. At the genus level, only 3.4% of bacterial species
used in this study are common entomopathogenic bacteria, including genera of Serratia (1 species), Photorhabdus (2 species), Pseudomonas (9 species) and
Bacillus (11 species). Additionally, 55 (4.7%) of these
1176 silkworm genes detected after blast-I have homologs in above four bacterial genera based on their top
BLAST hits. However, a half (BGIBMGA002521,

imply that insect pathogenic bacteria were the major
donors of Lepidopteran HTGs.

Discussion
Uneven transfer amount from bacteria to insects

Although the five available insect genomes were analyzed for HGT, significant HGT events were detected
only in the silkworm. Three reasons may explain this
observation. The first is utilization of incomplete
sequence data in this study. In general, before the
assembly of a genome sequence, the reads are checked
to get rid of contaminant fraction from symbiont, parasite and pathogen. As a result, HTG sequences coming
from other organisms may be deleted as contaminants.
The second is that the power of detection methods used
in this study is not high. Similarity search and phylogenetic analyses and other information were combined as
a detection pipeline to reveal HGT event; this reduces
the ratio of false positives. However, the complex steps
and strict standards in the pipeline may also reduce the
number of the detected candidates. The third is that the
contrast in HTG numbers between the silkworm and
other four insects may be true.
Wolbachia species are endosymbionts infecting 20% of
arthropods on Earth [66,67], and the genetic fractions of
this prokaryote were detected in the genomes of numerous insects [22,23,68,69]. This suggests that these insects
have ability to accept foreign genetic materials. Additionally, the D. melanogaster genome was first
sequenced among the five insects, and its annotation is
more complete and detailed. However, the trail of HTG
was not found in D. melanogaster based on its sequence
data. Consequently, incomplete data is not a reasonable
explanation. Various types and large amount of Lepidopteran HTGs do exist. In addition, we found 79 suspected sequences in Ap. mellifera, which are considered
as contaminants. Strikingly, all previously reported silkworm transferred genes were recovered in this study
[18-20,27], especially, a recent and independent study
on the silkworm HGT also confirmed the methods and
results in our study [28]. Thus, the detection pipeline
we used appears to be powerful and should not miss
real HTGs. In conclusion, HGT events may be distributed unevenly at least in four major insect orders of the
five insects. Silkworm (Lepidoptera) is a distinct case in
which HTGs are common and functional. The disparity
of the transfer number and ratio of HTGs in a certain
organism category has been shown previously in an
HGT study on fungi [29].

Page 11 of 15

The proportion (0.15%) of the transferred genes in
silkworm genome is comparable with the average level
(0.12%) in fungi [29]. In chromalveolates, a group of
protista, 16 types of bacteria transferred genes were
detected [70]. However, as simple eukaryotes, fungi and
protista are thought to accept foreign genetic sequences
into their genomes more easily. In aphid, 6 types of 12
genes including 3 pseudogenes were detected as HTGs
and its proportion ranges from 0.11% to 0.03% (0.08%
to 0.03% when deleting pseudogenes) [26,71]. Thus, the
amount of Lepidopteran HTGs is relative large.
Whether some ancient Lepidopteran insects have an
unusual ability of acquiring and fixing foreign genetic
materials is unclear. A previous study on prokaryotes
suggested that the proportion of distant HTGs is correlated to the genome sizes of donors and recipients [72].
Therefore, a large proportion of HTGs in Lepidopteran
insects may be, in part, attributed to the genome structure and component (e.g., genome size, transposable element, recombination rate, metabolic network and so on)
of these recipients. However, difference in selection
pressure among insects due to their surrounding niches
is another determinant and may result in uneven transfer amount among bacteria and insects.
The evolutionary characteristics of Lepidopteran HTGs

There are common features of HGT in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the sequence composition of
anciently transferred genes are often ameliorated to the
host genome [73]. As expected, GC contents of the
transferred genes in silkworm display a more centralized
distribution (mean: 43.83%, s.d.: 4.82%) compared with
that of the predicted bacterial donors (mean: 49.23%, s.
d.: 11.27%; Additional file 8). This also indicates that
most of these transferred genes have been integrated
into recipient genome for a long period of time, which
is consistent with the EST search results in Lepidoptera
(Figure 3). Three of the 14 types of Lepidopteran HTGs
(b-fructofuranosidase, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase and NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase) contain multiple genes. The glucose-1-phosphatase
consists of 6 tandem arranged genes (Table 2). However,
these gene duplication events were not revealed in a
recent study [28]. In aphid, the transferred gene of rare
lipoprotein A (RlpA) has 5 duplicated genes which are
also tandem arranged, and another gene type, LD-carboxypeptidase_1 (LdcA), includes 2 genes with one inactive [26]. At least more than a quarter of the detected
HTGs were duplicated after HGT events, either in Lepidoptera or in aphid. This tendency is consistent with
the findings in prokaryotes that the transferred genes
are more frequently duplicated than endogenetic genes
in hosts [74]. We also found that some detected HTGs

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:356
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/356

(BGIBMGA002521, BGIBMGA007766 type, BGIBMGA
008709) harbour respective homologs which are vertically transferred genes in the silkworm and other insect
genomes; that is, these HTGs and their homologs
belong to the same protein family. In a recent study, the
significant contribution of HGT to the expansion of
protein families in bacteria was revealed [13]. Thus,
HGT events also affect the evolution of protein families
in Lepidopteran insects, more or less.
There are some special aspects for the HTGs detected
in this study. Potential prokaryotic donors of insects
include symbionts, parasites, pathogens and bacteria in
diet and surrounding environments. Previous studies on
HGT between prokaryotes and insects mainly focused
on the insect endosymbiont bacteria [17]. In this paper,
we also found that one gene (BGIBMGA009498) might
be transferred from Wolbachia bacterium. However, the
experimental evidence indicated that extant silkworm
may be not infected by Wolbachia species [75]. Similar
results were found in Aedes aegypti and two filarial
nematode species [24,76]. At least 7 types of HTGs may
be introduced from entomopathogenic bacteria (pathogenic bacteria) and another donor is an endophytic bacterium (bacteria in food) (Table 3). Thus, donor pattern
of Lepidopteran HTGs is multifarious, which is different
from that in aphid and other insects. A recent HGT
event can be detected more easily than ancient ones,
because sequence similarity between donor and the
transferred sequence will decrease and base composition
of transferred sequence will ameliorate to the recipient
genome after the fixation [15]. In aphid, RlpA gene was
transferred from a relatively ancient HGT event about
50-70 MYA ago [26]. In HGT studies between insects
and Wolbachia, the majority of genes were transferred
from endosymbiont to hosts recently. Based on phylogenetic topologies and homolog distribution (Figure 3), we
found that most of Lepidopteran HTGs might be integrated into the hosts at least before the radiation of
Ditrysia or Apoditrysia group, about 100 MYA ago [77].
This indicates that the method we used is effective in
revealing ancient HGT events. Additionally, these
detected Lepidopteran HTGs, as a group of special-origin genetic fragments, can be used in the phylogenetic
reconstruction of Lepidopteran insects, especially for
Ditrysia insects among which the phylogenetic relationships are not clear in detail [55].
The biological significance of Lepidopteran HTGs in the
evolution of hosts

A question may arise: why do the transfer times of most
detected HGT events in Lepidoptera fall within a relatively narrow evolutionary period? Lepidopteran insects
are a relative young biological group in geology history
compared with other insect orders. Furthermore,

Page 12 of 15

Lepidoptera are the second largest order in insecta and
the largest group in plant-feeding insects. A generally
accepted opinion holds that the prosperity of Lepidopteran insects is associated with the diversification of
angiosperms on Earth in the late Cretaceous period
which is just about 100 MYA ago [77]. At that time,
developing angiosperms provide rich foods and living
environments for some ancient Lepidopteran insects
(may be the ancestor of Ditrysia insects). Thus, the
genetic changes that facilitated hosts to adapt to the
new niches predominated by angiosperm would be fixed
in the ancient Lepidopteran lineages. Biological traits
related to nutrition, reproduction, defense and immunization, are major targets of natural selection. Almost all
of the detected HTGs are functional enzymes except for
BGIBMGA000070 which may be a storage protein.
Furthermore, previous studies revealed that one HTG
BGIBMGA007146 in the silkworm participated in degradation, modification and combination of the toxins [20],
and another HTG BGIBMGA011204 improved the
metabolic pathway to get out of the toxic target site(s)
[46]. Again, the silkworm HTG BGIBMGA005696 is
involved in replacement of the targeted enzyme with a
resistant one [19]. Thus, the majority of Lepidopteran
HTGs might perform physiological functions in nutritional metabolism and detoxification. Detoxification is
related to the nutritional metabolism because toxins in
diet and toxins generated in normal endogenetic metabolisms can obstruct and reduce the ingestion and
digestion activities of consumers. In a long interaction
history between insects and their dietary plants, phytophagous insects might have developed some effective
strategies to protect the efficiency of nutritional metabolism from the detriments produced by plants. The
HTGs from bacteria may have contributed novel functions for Lepidopteran hosts to adapt to various diets
and niches.
It is interesting that a half of the detected HTGs are
pathogen-origin, while previous studies indicated that
bacteria of endosymbionts and parasites may be the primary donor group of HGT. It is well known that obligate symbiotic and parasitic bacteria are often
degenerated in some physiological metabolisms and
phenotypic traits [78-80]. Thus, potential genetic variations they could offer for recipients may be not plentiful
and effective to increase host’s adaptability in complex
niches, especially when surrounding environments
shifted [81,82]. This is probably a reason that most of
symbiont-origin HTGs in insects and nematodes are
nonfunctional or inactivated [23,25,26]. In contrast,
pathogenic bacteria in this study are more complex in
ecological niche and biological functions compared with
obligated symbiotic bacteria [56,58-60]. Previous studies
revealed several HGT events from non-endosymbiosis

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:356
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/356

organisms to multicellular recipients [9,16,26]. However,
the mechanism of foreign sequences transferred into the
recipient germline from non-endosymbiosis organisms is
unclear. Thus, how these pathogen genes integrated into
the Lepidopteran insects remains to be elucidated.
Whether HGT from other organisms to multicellular
eukaryotes has biological significance in the evolutionary
process of hosts is unknown. Two factors may affect the
evolutionary significance of the transferred genes: their
persistence in host genome and their integration in host
biology [83]. On the basis of previous individual cases,
some transferred genes certainly perform functions in
the host. However, in this study, we found a relative
large group of ancient transferred genes in Lepidopteran
insects, and these genes are predicted to have biological
functions since they were integrated into ancient Lepidopteran genomes. Furthermore, the integration of these
HTGs into Lepidoptera at least corresponds to the
expansion of angiosperm. Thus, it is most likely that
most of these HTGs facilitated Lepidoptera to adapt to
the evolution of their plant hosts. In short, our results
provide new evidence to support for exogenic variations
significantly contributing to the evolution of metazoan
organisms.

Conclusions
In this study, we applied a uniform method including
sequence similarity, homolog distribution, phylogenetic
incongruity and other information to detect HGT events
between bacteria and the five insects. Unexpectedly, 14
types of 22 HTGs were detected only in the silkworm.
Further study suggested that most of these HTGs are
Lepidoptera specific. Moreover, the estimate of the
transfer time of these HTGs into Lepidoptera corresponds to the evolutionary age of angiosperm expansion.
Since most Lepidoptera are phytophagous insects and
the majority of HTGs may perform physiological functions in nutritional metabolism and detoxification, these
HTGs facilitated Lepidoptera to adapt to the evolution
of their plant hosts. Thus, our results provide some
insight into understanding the biological significance of
HGT to the evolution of metazoan recipients.
