Abstract
Background: The type 1 (microbial) rhodopsins are a diverse group of photochemically reactive
proteins that display a broad yet patchy distribution among the three domains of life. Recent work
indicates that this pattern is likely the result of lateral gene transfer (LGT) of rhodopsin genes
between major lineages, and even across domain boundaries. Within the lineage in which the
microbial rhodopsins were initially discovered, the haloarchaea, a similar patchy distribution is
observed. In this initial study, we assess the roles of LGT and gene loss in the evolution of
haloarchaeal rhodopsin ion pump genes, using phylogenetics and comparative genomics
approaches.
Results: Mapping presence/absence of rhodopsins onto the phylogeny of the RNA polymerase B'
subunit (RpoB') of the haloarchaea supports previous notions that rhodopsins are patchily
distributed. The phylogeny for the bacteriorhodopsin (BR) protein revealed two discrepancies in
comparison to the RpoB' marker, while the halorhodopsin (HR) tree showed incongruence to both
markers. Comparative analyses of bacteriorhodopsin-linked regions of five haloarchaeal genomes
supported relationships observed in the BR tree, and also identified two open reading frames
(ORFs) that were more frequently linked to the bacteriorhodopsin gene than those genes
previously shown to be important to the function and expression of BR.
Conclusion: The evidence presented here reveals a complex evolutionary history for the
haloarchaeal rhodopsins, with both LGT and gene loss contributing to the patchy distribution of
rhodopsins within this group. Similarities between the BR and RpoB' phylogenies provide
supportive evidence for the presence of bacteriorhodopsin in the last common ancestor of
haloarchaea. Furthermore, two loci that we have designated bacterio-opsin associated chaperone
(bac) and bacterio-opsin associated protein (bap) are inferred to have important roles in BR
biogenesis based on frequent linkage and co-transfer with bacteriorhodopsin genes.

Background
The halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) are aerobic heterotrophs that dominate hypersaline ecosystems suRch as the
Dead Sea, Great Salt Lake and solar saltern facilities. Such
ecosystems are frequently found in arid climates characterized by low precipitation levels and intense exposure to
sunlight, which can lead to salinity levels as high as ten
times that of sea water [1]. Worldwide, hypersaline environments represent a broad range of niches, which is
reflected in the physiological properties of cultivated
haloarchaea. In addition to aerobic respiration, a number
of haloarchaea can ferment arginine, while others can use
sulfur, DMSO or nitrate as alternative electron acceptors.
Perhaps haloarchaea are most famous for their ability to
generate a proton gradient through the use of photo-reactive rhodopsin proteins that harness light energy [2-5].
The type 1 (microbial) rhodopsins are typically seven-pass
transmembrane proteins that use a retinal chromophore
to absorb light energy for ion transport or photosensory
functions [6]. First discovered in the haloarchaea in the
early 1970's [7], genomic and metagenomic sequencing
later revealed homologs in many disparate eukaryotes and
bacteria, and most recently in the marine group II euryarchaeotes [8].
Four functional types of haloarchaeal rhodopsins are
known. The H+ pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) uses light
energy to create a proton electrochemical gradient for ATP
production, flagellar rotation and other energy requiring
processes [7]. The light-driven transport of chloride ions
into the cytoplasm by the Cl- pump halorhodopsin (HR),
works to increase the electrochemical potential of the proton gradient, while the two types of sensory rhodopsins
present in the haloarchaea are used for phototaxis under
alternative maximum wavelengths of light (λmax) [9-13].
The model haloarchaeaon for rhodopsin studies, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 exhibits differential expression patterns
of its rhodopsins based on oxygen levels [2]. When oxygen is abundant, the expression of sensory rhodopsin II
(SRII) facilitates avoidance motility from sunlight presumably to protect itself from harmful photo-oxidative
damage. Under micro-oxic conditions Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 expresses three of its four rhodopsin types to harness solar energy and support periods of phototrophic
growth. Sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) directs phototaxis of
the cell into those wavelengths of light where both BR and
HR absorb maximally, and can be used most efficiently.
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is also one of the few haloarchaea known to produce a specialized area of its cell surface, called the purple membrane, where BR is the only
protein present and covers as much as 50% of the cell surface [14].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/79

Not all BR-producing haloarchaea produce purple membranes, however, and BR genes are themselves patchilydistributed among haloarchaea, as are genes for the different rhodopsin types [15-17]. In addition, despite BR's
excellent potential for generating energy, it has been
observed that among those isolates analyzed that harbor
the H+ pump, only a few are able to produce large
amounts of BR protein in culture [14-16,18,19]. Indeed,
in some isolates, the gene encoding BR appears to be
present but not expressed [16].
The wide but patchy distribution of rhodopsin genes
among haloarchaeal lineages led Ihara et al. to propose
that the four types of rhodopsin functionality (BR, HR,
SRI and SRII) were present in the last common ancestor of
all haloarchaea [20], a hypothesis that would suggest rhodopsin genes have been repeatedly lost in different lineages. However, a similar patchy distribution of type 1
microbial rhodopsin genes among bacteria and archaea
more generally has been interpreted as the result of lateral
gene transfer (LGT), sometimes spanning the boundaries
between the three domains of life [8,21-23]. We considered it likely that the patchy distribution of rhodopsin
gene contents might even more likely reflect episodes of
LGT and gene loss, the evidence for which would be
incongruent gene phylogenies and unstable gene arrangements within the haloarchaea, the later already evident
from comparative genomics but the former not yet
shown.
Here we present additional gene arrangement data, and
compelling evidence for instances of gene gain by LGT,
using phylogenetic analyses of the BR and HR functional
types and comparison to the RNA polymerase B' subunit
phylogeny (RpoB'). We interpret these results in terms of
the physiology of the organisms, and use comparative
genomics to infer involvement of certain additional loci
in regulation of rhodopsin biogenesis.

Results
RpoB' protein phylogeny
A phylogeny of RNA polymerase B' subunit (RpoB') was
constructed as a reference tree (Figure 1). The utility of this
marker for haloarchaea was demonstrated previously and
a significant collection of RpoB' sequences exists for comparative analysis [24]. The RpoB' phylogeny presented
here is similar to that previously inferred in Walsh et al.
[24] and reconstructed two strongly supported monophyletic groups, the Clade I and Clade II haloarchaea,
within a collection of less well resolved haloarchaeal lineages (Figure 1). Analysis of the RpoB' protein from the
recently sequenced genome of Haloquadratum walsbyii
DSM 16790 [25] places this organism among the Clade II
haloarchaea with strong bootstrap support. The position

on presence or absence is not available. The groups outlined
by shaded boxes represent well-supported clades of haloarchaea. Note that in most cases a single RpoB' sequence is
used to represent an entire genus and the representative
taxa and accession number can be found in the methods section.
of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 as sister to Clade II haloarchaea was unresolved [24].
Distribution of rhodopsin genes
The presence/absence of rhodopsins in different haloarchaeal genera determined from this study and others, was
mapped to the RpoB' phylogeny in Figure 1. Note that in
most cases a single sequence was used to represent an
entire genus. The identity of the specific sequence
included in the phylogeny is described in the methods. In
several genera rhodopsins are not present in all members.
For example, a bacteriorhodopsin gene PCR product was
not obtained from Haloterrigena turkmenica, however

other members of this genus have been found to harbor
this rhodopsin type, and therefore the presence of this
rhodopsin type in Haloterrigena is assumed. The presence/
absence of the bacteriorhodopsin gene, or the BR protein
itself as assayed in other studies [16,17], was known for
13 of the 17 genera represented in the RpoB' tree. We
attempted to amplify the bR gene from representatives of
those genera where the presence of BR was unknown. Partial rhodopsin gene sequences were obtained in this study
from Halorhabdus utahensis, Natronorubrum str. Tenzan 10,
and Halosimplex carlsbadense (the presence of BR in this
organism was noted by Dr. Kunio Ihara, personal communication). Additional sequences were also obtained for
additional haloarchaea (supplementary Figure 2). The
bacteriorhodopsin gene could not be amplified from Halogeometricum borinquense, Natronobacterium str. SSL6,
Natrinema versiforme, Haloterrigena turkmenica, nor various
isolates that display close relation to Halorubrum lacusprofundi cultivated in a salt spring [26]. Kamekura et al. previously documented that some members of the genus
Halorubrum are unable to produce BR and appear to lack
bacteriorhodopsin genes [16]. In some cases the presence/
absence of other rhodopsin types was known from
genome sequences. For example, H. walsbyi is non-motile
and lacks sensory rhodopsins but encodes the gene for hR
[25]. Natronomonas pharaonis encodes HR and SR types
but lacks a bacteriorhodopsin gene [16,27]. Organisms of
the genus Halococcus and Haloferax reportedly lack rhodopsin pigments entirely [3,17]. The ability to perform
nitrate reduction as an alternative energy source was also
mapped onto the RpoB' reference tree [17,28]. Nitrate
reduction is considered in the discussion as part of a
hypothesis for certain cases of variation in rhodopsin gene
content and expression.
Bacteriorhodopsin protein phylogeny
The mapping of rhodopsins and nitrate reduction onto
the RpoB' phylogeny indicate that these functions are
patchily distributed among the haloarchaea and are not
confined to any specific clade. Such a pattern of gene presence/absence is most easily interpreted in terms of LGT
and gene loss, but only complete genomes sequence data
can show that genes are truly absent. Strongly supported
phylogenetic incongruence provides independent and
often more compelling evidence for LGT. Figure 2a shows
a maximum likelihood phylogeny of inferred BR proteins
within haloarchaea. (Note that H. walsbyi DSM 16790
genome revealed a novel rhodopsin type, indicated in Figure 2a as H. walsbyi copy B, that did not cluster within any
of the four known functional groups, but branched basal
to the proton pumps (as originally indicated in Bolhuis et
al. [25])

Comparison of the BR phylogeny to RpoB' demonstrated
several similarities. For example, the Clade I haloarchaea

represented by Halobiforma lacisalsi and Haloterrigena sp.
Arg-4 were also monophyletic in the BR tree. The position
of the BR proteins from Haloarcula and Halomicrobium are
unresolved with respect to the rest of the haloarchaea, but
grouped together with strong bootstrap support. The
Clade II haloarchaea are represented by Halorubrum and
Haloquadratum, both of which formed a clade with Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 with moderate support. This grouping supported the relationship observed between these
three genera in the RpoB' tree, which can be corroborated
by physiological information regarding phototrophy that
will be discussed later. The placement of H. walsbyi copy A
among other Clade II related haloarchaea in the BR phylogeny was further supported by the addition of incomplete sequences recovered from a environmental BR
diversity study of the crystallizer pond in Santa Pola,
where Haloquadratum-type organisms are the dominant
haloarchaea [29]. These Haloquadratum-related sequences,
in addition to other incomplete BR gene sequences from
both the database and this study are presented in additional file 1 because their short lengths decreased the
number of amino acid positions available for phylogenetic analyses.
Well-supported discrepancies between the RpoB' and the
BR phylogenies were also observed, however. Most notably, the genome of Haloarcula marismortui [30] was found
to encode two proton-pump-like genes. One copy (H.

marismortui A) grouped amongst those BR proteins known
to be common to the genus Haloarcula, while the other
(H. marismortui B) formed a strongly supported clade with
H. walsbyi. In addition the BR sequence from an environmental fosmid clone (FLAS10H9) obtained in this study
formed a robust grouping within those BR proteins
derived from the Clade II haloarchaea. Evolutionary analyses of 5 ORFs spread across the genomic fragment (as
opposed to clustered) from FLAS10H9 (additional files 2
and 3) indicate that this genomic fragment did not originate from a Clade II haloarchaeon. In addition, the %GC
of FLAS10H9 (~70%) differs substantially from H. walsbyi
(~48%), the BR protein most closely related to that
encoded on FLAS10H9.
Bacteriorhodopsin sequence diversity
To assess the overall diversity of the BR sequence types
among the haloarchaea twenty incomplete BR sequences
referred to above were included in a separate phylogeny
(additional file 1). Note that the partial sequences
obtained in the study by Pašić et al. [31] were not included
here due to their decreased length in comparison to the
partial sequences used here. This phylogeny lacks 73 aa
positions that were present in the BR phylogeny in Figure
2a, resulting in a decrease in the resolution of the tree
topology. Although the relationships between groups of
haloarchaea were less clearly resolved, this analysis provided strong support for the existence of four clades that
reflect the evolutionary relationships observed in the
RpoB' tree (Figure 1) with the exception of the LGT events
discussed later. These clades contain both environmental
sequences from a previous study of the saltern in Santa
Pola, Spain, in addition to sequences amplified from
uncharacterized haloarchaeal strains cultivated from the
same location, indicating that the known diversity of BR
sequences from this location is well represented by
sequences from cultivated haloarchaea. Note that a similar pattern was observed for BR sequences from a solar
saltern facility in Slovenia [31], suggesting that BR diversity from thalassic solar salterns is relatively well
described.
Halorhodopsin phylogeny
To determine whether different rhodopsin types displayed the same evolutionary history, we constructed a
phylogeny for HR proteins (Figure 2b). The HR protein
phylogeny appeared incongruent with both the BR and
the RpoB' phylogenies. The most striking incongruence
was a grouping of Haloterrigena sp. Arg-4, a Clade I haloarchaeon, with H. walsbyi and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.
Although Haloterrigena sp. Arg-4 is not represented in the
RpoB' phylogeny, its 16S sequence (AB009624) was 94%
identical to the Clade I haloarchaeon Natrinema pallidum,
whose RpoB' sequence is present as the representitve for
Natrinema in Figure 1. The relationship between the Clade

II haloarchaea and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 observed in
both the RpoB' and the BR protein phylogenies (Figs. 1
and 2a) is disrupted in Figure 2b, where Haloarcula HR
proteins form a clade with the HR sequences from H. walsbyi and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 to the exclusion of Halorubrum encoded HR. These observations indicate an
alternative evolutionary history for HR, different from
that of BR and RpoB'.
Bacteriorhodopsin-linked regions of haloarchaeal
genomes
In the genome of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [32] the gene
encoding bR is adjacent to genes important to its function
and expression (Figure 3), all of which are transcriptionally co-regulated under micro-oxic conditions when
accompanied by exposure to light [33]. Under these conditions the bacterio-opsin activator protein (Bat) binds to
the upstream activator sequences of genes belonging to
the bR regulon, which include the bat gene itself, bacterioopsin related protein (brp) and phytoene synthase (crtB1).
The last two are responsible for catalyzing steps in the biosynthesis of the retinal chromophore required for rhodopsin function. The Bat protein also induces
transcription of the gene encoding the bacterio-opsin
linked protein (blp) whose function is unknown [34].

Bacteriorhodopsin-linked genomic regions are also available for two other sequenced haloarchaeal genomes (Figure 4), H. marismortui [30] (with two bR genes) and H.
walsbyi DSM 16790 [25]. Although the sequenced genome
of the haloarchaeaon Natronomonas pharaonis [27] does
not harbour a bR gene, it encodes a Cl- pumping rhodopsin (halorhodopsin, HR). The genomic context of hR
in N. pharaonis suggests that both HR and BR have converged on similar solutions in that the genes encoding
these rhodopsins are linked to others important to their
biogenesis (Figure 3). Note that there were no linkage patterns displayed among hR genes from the remaining
haloarchaeal genomes.
In addition we have sequenced bR gene regions from two
fosmid clones, one from Halorubrum strain TP009 (Clade
II haloarchaeaon) isolated from a solar saltern in Santa
Pola, Spain and the other, FLAS10H9, from metagenomic
library created from the same solar saltern sampled at the
same time. A cultured organism from the genus Halorubrum was chosen because of its relationship to the Clade
II haloarchaea, and in addition Halorubrum represents an
important haloarchaeal division for which no sequenced
genome is available [26,31,35]. Clone FLAS10H9 was
chosen because it encodes a bR gene highly similar to that
of H. walsbyi, although the surrounding genomic context
of this clone is different evolutionary relationships (additional files 2 and 3).

functionality is indicated in the text. The direction of transcription is indicated by the orientation of the arrow. The
structure of the bacteriorhodopsin gene cluster is variable
between haloarchaeal genera, but shares pronounced similarities between those lineages that group together in the RpoB'
phylogeny.

In these haloarchaeal genomes, the bR gene was observed
in three general linkage states (Figure 3). The first state is
that exhibited by Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, H. walsbyi
DSM 16790, and Halorubrum str. TP009, in which bR was
linked to genes required for its biogenesis, although there
were slight differences in the genomic structure and content. Rearrangement of these genes is observed in all three
organisms, and in some cases genes were substituted in or
out. For example, blp and bat are not linked to bR in the
gene cluster in H. walsbyi, although a second protonpump-like gene was present. Additionally, each organism
encodes genes for different steps along the carotenoid synthesis pathway in their bR gene cluster (genes indicated in
yellow, Figure 3).
These three genomes had three genes in common that
were linked to bR. The brp gene encodes the enzyme that
catalyses the final step in retinal synthesis [34]. Two others are open reading frames (ORFs) that were also implicated in BR biogenesis in previous studies limited to
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [36,37]. These ORFs encode a
paralog of Cdc48, a AAA-ATPase cell division cycle protein
that we have chosen to designate bacterio-opsin associated chaperone (bac, see next section) and a small open
reading frame (50–70aa) hereafter designated as bacterioopsin associated protein (bap). Although the presence of

these genes have been described in isolated instances, our
designation is based on common occurrence and likely
conserved function. Further analysis of the inferred Bap
protein with transmembrane prediction [38,39] and
amino acid backbone modeling (using 3D position specific scoring matrix fold recognition server, [40]) indicated
a two pass transmembrane protein structure.
The second general linkage pattern was simply the bR gene
clustered with bap and bac (Figure 3). This pattern was
observed for H. marismortui (copy B) and also the bR gene
from the environmental fosmid clone FLAS10H9. The
third pattern linked bR and genes encoding for the subunits of the H+-ATPase. This was observed only for the copy
of bR in H. marismortui (copy B) that appears ancestral to
the genus Haloarcula (Figure 2). A similar pattern has been
described for genomic fragment from Haloarcula japonica,
in which a gene encoding an H+-ATPase subunit lies
upsteam of a bR gene [18].

supported clusters within the Cdc48 phylogeny. Phylogenies within these clusters are generally congruent to each
other and well supported at most nodes, but disagree with
the well-supported Bac protein phylogeny.
The topology for the Bac protein is incongruent with the
RpoB' tree. For example the grouping between Haloarcula
marismortui, FLAS10H9 and Haloquadratum walsbyi supports a similar discrepancy in the BR phylogeny (Figure
2a). However, the phylogeny for the Bac paralog must be
considered with some caution due to long branch attraction (LBA) artifacts [42]. An additional phylogenetic analysis of a Cdc48 alignment constructed using only the
more conservative regions of the protein yielded similar
support and topology for the Bac encoding paralogs providing further support for the relationship shown in Figure 3 and its incongruence to phylogenies for those Cdc48
paralogs not associated with BR (data not shown).

Discussion
Cell division cycle 48 protein phylogeny
Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on the cdc48
paralogs frequently linked to the bR gene, which we designate bac (bacterio-opsin associated chaperone) (Figure 4),
in the context of a broad sampling of archaeal cdc48
genes. Cdc48 comprise a family of proteins described as
ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activites
(AAA-ATPases) [41]. Homologs of the Cdc48 protein family are present in all three domains of life, and as their
name suggests are associated with many different functions, such as membrane fusion, proteolysis, chaperonelike activites and cell division. The genes encoding these
proteins are widespread in archaeal genomes, where they
are usually present in multiple copies (Figure 4).

A phylogeny of selected archaeal Cdc48 homologs,
including all bR-linked bac genes, is represented in Figure
4. Sequences tend to fall into well-supported groups but
weak backbone support for the overall phylogeny leaves
relationships between these groups unresolved. For
instance, the separation into four groups of Cdc48 paralogs originating from the Halobacteriales are resolved
with regards to each other and well supported to the
exclusion of other euryarchaeotes, but their position
within the euryarchaeotes is uncertain. The protein
sequences of the Bac paralog of Cdc48 – those that are
linked to the gene encoding BR in haloarchaeal genomes
(Figure 4) – fall into one of these well-supported clusters
and are represented by the 5 sequences in the clade
marked by the black dot, which are associated with long
branches. Three Cdc48 paralogs not linked to bR are
found in the each of the sequenced genomes, including
Haloferax volcanii and Natronomonas pharonis, both of
which lack bR and the bac paralog of Cdc48. It is these
additional genes which make up the remaining three well-

In this study we performed comparative genomic and
phylogenetic analyses to address questions regarding the
evolution of BR-based phototrophy and the erratic distribution of rhodopsins among haloarchaea. The distribution of rhodopsins mapped onto the RpoB' phylogeny
(Figure 1) of the haloarchaea supported previous notions
that these proteins are patchily distributed rather than
present in a specific clade of haloarchaea and absent in
others. Here we attempt to explain potential factors
responsible for the patchy distribution of rhodopsins
within this lineage of archaea and place physiological
information of these organisms into an evolutionary context with regards to phototrophy.
Bacteriorhodopsin-based phototrophy in haloarchaea
The broad distribution of the different functional types of
rhodopsins, including BR, among haloarchaea has lead to
suggestions that these proteins were present in the ancestor of this archaeal group [20]. The phylogeny in Figure 2a
and its similarities to the RpoB tree (Figure 1) provides
evidence in favor of this hypothesis for the proton pumping BR types. Although BR may have been an ancestral feature of haloarchaea, our comparative and phylogenetic
analyses revealed a correlation between those isolates
capable of producing high concentrations of BR in the
membrane and evolutionary relatedness. The phylogeny
inferred from RpoB' (Figure 1) indicated that Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 forms a group with the Clade II haloarchaea, which contains both Halorubrum
and
Haloquadratum. Previous studies have documented that
isolates from these genera highly express BR, more so than
those
from
other
haloarchaeal
lineages
[3,15,16,25,42,43]. Additional evidence supporting this
correlation is seen in the structure and composition of the
bacteriorhodopsin gene cluster in the genomes of Halo-

bacterium sp. NRC-1, Halorubrum str. TP009 and Haloquadratum walsbyi, where bacteriorhodopsin is linked to genes
important for the synthesis of the chromophore retinal
and the biogenesis of the BR protein (Figure 3). Furthermore, in the BR protein phylogeny (Figure 2a), the
sequence from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 groups together
with Halorubrum species and Haloquadratum walsbyi in a
well-supported clade. While this might suggest that the
ability to efficiently incorporate BR into energy production evolved in the lineage that gave rise to Halobacterium
sp. NRC-1 and the Clade II haloarchaea, this hypothesis
should be considered with some caution due to the small
sampling of cultivars analyzed and the unknown influence of cultivation on their ability to grow phototrophically.
Interestingly, members of Halorubrum and Haloquadratum
were found to represent a significant fraction of solar saltern microbial communities in Slovenian [31] and Spanish
[44] crystallizer ponds respectively. The shallow crystallizer ponds represent the final stages of salt production
where precipitation occurs, thus resulting in the lowest
concentration of oxygen of all the ponds in the solar saltern environment [45]. The dominance of these groups
under such conditions hints that rhodopsin-based energygenerating photosystems may play a significant role in the
success of these organisms in such ecosystems. In addition, the most dominant bacterium in the Spanish crystallizer pond, Salinibacter ruber was shown to produce a
novel type of rhodopsin (xanthorhodopsin) that uses carotenoid antennae to absorb across a greater range of wavelengths of light [46].
The observation of refined rhodopsin-based energy-generating photosystems [5,17,25] in some groups is in contrast to those lineages that lack BR and rhodopsin
functionality altogether. For example, Kamekura et al.
documented that some Halorubrum species lack BR, suggesting patchy distribution even at the genus level [16]. If
it is assumed that BR was present prior to the divergence
of Clade II haloarchaea, then this patchy distribution is
best explained by multiple independent losses. Mukohata
et al. [47] previously suggested loss of rhodopsins in
Haloferax, a conclusion which is also supported by our
analyses here. Rhodopsin pigments have not been
detected in any of the members from the genus Haloferax
[16,47], or the genome of Haloferax volcanii, currently
being sequenced by TIGR [48]. Haloferax is also a terminal
member of the Clade II haloarchaea (Figure 1) suggesting
that rhodopsins were lost recently, prior to the divergence
of this genus.
Closer examination of the genus Haloferax reveals that
many of its members have an alternative mechanism to
generate energy that phototrophic members of Clade II

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/79

appear to lack [17,49]. The ability of certain Haloferax
members to perform nitrate reduction (Figure 1) suggests
they are able to cope with long periods of anoxic conditions, which is interesting in light of the inability of
haloarchaea to produce retinal in the complete absence of
oxygen [5]. One potential hypothesis for the loss of rhodopsins in Haloferax may be that the ancestor of this
group adapted to prolonged anoxic conditions, during
which rhodopsin-based energy would be frequently unavailable.
LGT and loss: the patchy distribution of rhodopsins
The probable loss of rhodopsins in Haloferax and Halorubrum highlights a general question regarding the evolution of this group of proteins in haloarchaea and their
patchy distribution. Previously, Ihara et al. [20] suggested
that the different types of rhodopsins were present in the
last common ancestor of the haloarchaea, which would
suggest that the patchy distribution of rhodopsins
observed among these organisms is the result of multiple
losses. More recently however, several studies have
revealed the genetic mobility of genes encoding type 1
rhodopsins among microbes. The work described here
provides at least three highly probable cases of LGT within
haloarchaea. These events are sketched in Figure 5 and
briefly discussed below. Note that the sensory rhodopsins
are less well represented in the database and therefore
were not included in this study.
bR gene transfer
The comparison of the BR protein phylogeny (Figure 2a)
to the RpoB' reference tree revealed two instances where
the phylogenies were incongruent. In both Haloarcula
marismortui and the environmental fosmid FLAS10H9 the
bacteriorhodopsin gene was observed in a similar linkage
state, where it was found adjacent to the genes bac and bap
(Figure 4). Phylogenetic analyses of the BR and Bac
sequences observed in this linkage state revealed that the
genes encoding these proteins were likely laterally transferred into both genomes as a unit. It is possible that these
LGT events may have occurred independently of each
other. However, the unresolved positions of both
FLAS10H9 and the genus Haloarcula in combination with
the grouping of some FLAS10H9 ORFs with Haloarcula
(additional file 2) suggests the most parsimonious interpretation as a single transfer into the ancestor of these
organisms from a Haloquadratum-releated lineage (Figure
5).

The co-transfer of genes encoding rhodopsins with their
linked complements was also observed in a recent study
by McCarren and DeLong [23]. In that study, genes encoding components of the retinal biosynthesis pathway were
shown to co-migrate with proteorhodopsin genes
between divergent microbial lineages to deliver a fully

Branch lengths are extended by dashed lines, and the environmental fosmid FLAS10H9 (brown) is given an arbitrary
position on the tree based on phylogenetic analyses on
selected ORFs encoded on the genomic fragment. Those
phylogenies (additional files 2 and 3) indicate that FLAS10H9
does not originate from a Clade II haloarchaeon, while some
ORFs group with the genus Haloarcula. The bacteriorhodopsin and bac genes of FLAS10H9 (Figure 2a and 4) share
affiliation with the Clade II haloarchaea, particularly Haloquadratum walsbyi. Given the limited amount of sequence data for
the HR types, it is difficult to resolve the donor and recipient
groups for transfer events that gave rise to the topology
observed in Figure 2b

functional photosystem to the recipient organism. While
the genes co-transferred with bacteriorhodopsin here do
not seem to play a direct role in retinal synthesis, perhaps
because the recipient haloarchaeal genome already
encoded such capabilities, the ability of Bac and Bap to
confer a rhodopsin specific selective advantage is discussed below.
Incongruence of tree topologies for BR and HR
Multiple scenarios infer a minimum of two LGT events
involving the Cl- pumping types to account for incongruent phylogenies between this protein and BR (figs. 2 and
5). The number and direction of hR transfers is difficult to
interpret due to the unresolved position of Haloarcula in
the RpoB' phylogeny (Figure 1) and the limited amount of
sequence data for the Cl- pumping types.

The phylogenetic evidence presented here strongly support our hypothesis that lateral gene transfer in conjunction with gene loss has contributed to the patchy
distribution of rhodopsins among haloarchaea. While
particular rhodopsin functional types (namely HR) may
have first arisen in different haloarchaeal lineages and
then spread amongst other members of this group by LGT,
we cannot rule out more complex scenarios in which all
rhodopsins were present in the haloarchaeal cenancestor
but also have a more recent history of between-lineage
LGT. The acquisition of additional sequence data for the
BR and HR proteins in addition to the sensory rhodopsin
types will provide a more accurate picture of this possibly
quite complex history. The haloarchaeal origin of certain
rhodopsin paralogs (halorhodopsin, sensory rhodopsin)
in the genome of the hyperhalophilic bacterium S. ruber
may represent an analogous example of the spread of rhodopsin-functionality by LGT [21].
Frequent linkage suggests Bac and Bap play a role in BR
function
The observation of the frequent linkage of gene sets over
broad evolutionary distances suggests shared function.
The genes we describe as bac and bap were linked to the
bacteriorhodopsin gene at a higher frequency (Figure 3)
than those genes previously shown to be important to the
function and expression of the proton pump, suggesting
an important role for these proteins in BR-based phototrophy. The Bac protein displayed homology to the
Cdc48 protein family, a multifunctional group of proteins
that belong to the AAA-ATPases [41]. The significance of
Bac to BR function is supported by multiple lines of evidence; frequent linkage, co-transfer with the bR gene (Figure 4) and the striking absence of Bac paralogs in those
haloarchaeal genomes that lack BR. In relation to other
Cdc48 proteins in the domain archaea, the Bac paralogs
are associated with unusually long branch lengths, suggesting that their function is being co-opted to a cellular
role that is uniquely haloarchaeal (e.g. BR). In addition to
this evidence, a recent bioinformatics analysis of the Halobacterium. sp. NRC-1 genome by Reiss et al. [36] found
homology for the transcriptional activation sequence for
the BR regulon upstream of the bac gene. The function of
Cdc48 proteins in archaea is relatively unexplored. Golbik
et al. [50,51] implicated a Cdc48 paralog of Thermoplasma
acidophilum in chaperone-like activities. How BR transverses the lipid bilayer has yet to be completely elucidated
[52], and we suggest that Bac plays a chaperone-like role
in BR protein translocation and membrane insertion.

The bap gene is also frequently linked to bR and encodes a
haloarchaeal-specific conserved protein that has only
been detected in a bR related genomic context. Using integrated microarray and proteomic data, Baliga et al. [37]
found a decrease in Bap protein expression when the tran-

scriptional regulator of the BR regulon (Bat) was knocked
out. While no functional role could be assigned to this
protein on the basis of sequence similarity, Bap shared
structural similarity with the two-pass transmembrane
component of sensory rhodopsin transducers. Transducer
proteins (Htr) have two main functions with regards to
sensory rhodopsins (SR). These proteins help to relay the
phototactic signal received from SR to the flagella and also
help to insert and align SR in the membrane in a higher
order structure (2:2 ratio of SR to Htr) [53]. In the absence
of Htr, SR is inserted into the membrane with far less efficiency, and membrane insertion activity can be restored
by the addition of the DNA sequence encoding the signal
sequence peptide of BR [54]. Perhaps Bap plays a similar
role to that of Htr in membrane insertion, although no
two-pass transmembrane protein has been observed in
the structure of the purple membrane, indicating that
such a role would be transient.

Conclusion
Bacteriorhodopsin and its several homologs have long
been considered defining features of the haloarchaea, and
have been developed into superb model systems by structural biologists and photophysiologists. But they are not
limited in their occurrence to haloarchaea, nor are they
universally present among the latter. Furthermore, these
functionally differentiated proteins play distinct physiological roles and appear to be regulated differently within
and between the haloarchaeal lineages in which they are
found.
In a recent review of photosynthesis Bryant and Frigaard
commented that the reaction centers employed by photosynthetic bacteria are a more efficient means of obtaining
energy than rhodopsin-based phototrophy, due to both
the efficiency of converting photon energy to ATP and the
presence of large amounts of chromophore in a single
unit of reaction center [55]. Consequently, BR-based phototrophy in haloarchaea likely acts as a supplementary
energy source, which some lineages may exploit better
than others. Presumably these differences in gene content,
organization and expression reflect such exploitation, are
adaptive and clearly, as we show here, they can arise
through lateral gene transfer.
Several recent studies suggest that rhodopsin genes should
be considered part of the "habitat genome", a pool of
genes useful for adaptation to a particular set of environmental constraints [8,21,23,56]. Clearly some haloarchaeal lineages have assembled refined rhodopsin-based
energy systems in response to such constraints, while others have adapted to different ecological niches where rhodopsin functionality may or may not be part of such a
habitat genome. Consequently, it should not be surprising that rhodopsin functionality is frequently lost, gained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/79

by LGT, or even that the broad distribution of certain
functional-types may be the result of rhodopsin gene
mobility.

BR gene PCR
The sequences of the primers used to amplify the BR gene
from Papke et al. [29] are as follows: 381–401 forward (5'GAC TGG TTG TTY ACV ACG CC -3') and 795–814
reverse (5'-AAG CCG AAG CCG AYC TTB GC-3'). PCR
amplification reactions were carried out in a final volume
of 50ul containing 1–5 ng of template DNA, 1 × PCR
buffer, 1 ul of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2 ul
of 50 mM MgCl2, 2 ul of a solution of each primer (F/R)
at a concentration of 10 uM and 0.5 ul of Taq polymerase
(Invitrogen).

BR gene fragments were amplified with an initial denaturation at 95 C for 3 minutes, 30 cycles with a denaturation
at 95 C for 45 seconds, primer annealing at 54.8 C for 45

out using the same approach. In most cases PCR products
were directly sequenced, except for Halorhabdus utahensis
where the PCR product was cloned before sequencing
(TOPO-TA; Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed using
ABI Big Dye-terminator chemistry on an ABI 377 instrument. The sequences were trimmed and analyzed using

Cultivation methods
Halorubrum str. TP009 and other strains used in this study
were isolated from a solar saltern in Santa Pola, Spain. For
cultivation methods see Papke et al. [64].
Fosmid library construction and sequencing
Genomic DNA was obtained from Halorubrum str. TP009
using the protocol of Wilson [65]. The fosmid FLAS10H9
was obtained from the environmental fosmid library of
the Santa Pola saltern described in Legault et al. [56]. Fosmid libraries were constructed using the CopyControl fosmid library production kit from Epicentre (Madison, WI)
following the protocol of the manufacturer. Fosmid
clones were miniprepped using either alkaline lysis prep
on grown cultures with the R.E.A.L. Prep 96 plasmid kit
(QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). Clones containing BR genes
were identified by PCR screening as described above. Subcloning of fosmids was done using the TOPO Shotgun
subcloning kit (Invitrogen). Subclones were sequenced
using DYEnamic™ ET Dye Terminator Kit (MegaBACE)
and a MegaBACE™ 1000 (Amersham). The level of
sequencing coverage for each fosmid was: 13.3X for
TP009 and 8.2X for Flas10h9. Low-quality regions and
gaps were fixed by PCR. The fosmids were assembled
using phredPhrap, and open reading frames (ORFs) were
