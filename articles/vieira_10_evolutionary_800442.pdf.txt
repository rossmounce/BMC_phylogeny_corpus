gametophytic self - incompatibility system in two
divergent Rosaceae groups (Maloideae and Prunus)

Abstract
Background: Within Rosaceae, the RNase based gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system has been studied at
the molecular level in Maloideae and Prunus species that have been diverging for, at least, 32 million years. In order to
understand RNase based GSI evolution within this family, comparative studies must be performed, using similar
methodologies.
Result: It is here shown that many features are shared between the two species groups such as levels of recombination
at the S-RNase (the S-pistil component) gene, and the rate at which new specificities arise. Nevertheless, important
differences are found regarding the number of ancestral lineages and the degree of specificity sharing between closely
related species. In Maloideae, about 17% of the amino acid positions at the S-RNase protein are found to be positively
selected, and they occupy about 30% of the exposed protein surface. Positively selected amino acid sites are shown to
be located on either side of the active site cleft, an observation that is compatible with current models of specificity
determination. At positively selected amino acid sites, non-conservative changes are almost as frequent as
conservative changes. There is no evidence that at these sites the most drastic amino acid changes may be more
strongly selected.
Conclusions: Many similarities are found between the GSI system of Prunus and Maloideae that are compatible with
the single origin hypothesis for RNase based GSI. The presence of common features such as the location of positively
selected amino acid sites and lysine residues that may be important for ubiquitylation, raise a number of issues that, in
principle, can be experimentally addressed in Maloideae. Nevertheless, there are also many important differences
between the two Rosaceae GSI systems. How such features changed during evolution remains a puzzling issue.
Background
In flowering plants, self-incompatibility systems can be
found that prevent self-fertilization, thus contributing to
the avoidance of inbreeding depression. In the widespread gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system,
when the S-pollen specificity matches that of the S-pistil
the pollen is recognized as S-locus has been shown to be
a S-RNase in Plantaginaceae, Rosaceae and Solanaceae
[2]. Phylogenetic evidence, as well as the conserved gene
structure (conserved and hypervariable regions, intron
number and position), suggest that RNase based GSI
evolved once before the separation of the Asterideae and

Rosideae [3-6]. In Prunus(Rosaceae) the S-pollen component is an F-box gene (SFB) [7-11]. In this species, synonymous and non-synonymous variability levels are similar
at the pollen and pistil S-genes. Furthermore, positively
selected amino acid sites have been detected at both Sgenes that may account for the large number of specificities known to be present in natural populations [11-13].
In Maloideae (Rosaceae) species, two (in Malus, called
SFBB- alpha and SFBB-gamma) and three (in Pyrus,
called SFBB- alpha, SFBB-gamma, and SFBB-beta) F-box
genes have been identified as putative S- pollen genes
[14]. These genes are located in the vicinity of the SRNase gene, show pollen-specific expression, and linkage
disequilibrium with the S-RNase[14], but present low
diversity levels [15].

In Petunia (Solanaceae) one F-box gene, located in the
S-locus region and that is responsible for competitive
interaction (pollen carrying two different pollen S-alleles
fails to function in SI) has been identified as the S-pollen
component [16,17]. Furthermore, the swapping of the Nterminal and C-terminal SLF protein regions between
SLFs from different specificity haplotypes leads to specificity changes [18]. Nevertheless, in another Solanaceae
species, namely Nicotiana, the S-pollen gene could not be
identified despite one attempt based on the assumption
that it is also an SLF-like gene [19]. It should be noted
that it is difficult to establish the phylogenetic relationships of F-box S-pollen and S-like sequences [19,20].
Although independent recruitments of the S-pollen gene
have been suggested based on phylogenetic evidence [19],
the hypothesis of a single recruitment cannot be discarded because inferred sequence relationships are highly
dependent on the alignment and phylogenetic method
used [20].
In order to avoid GSI breakdown the S-pistil and S-pollen loci must co-evolve. Low recombination levels are
thus expected in the S-locus region. Evidence for recombination has been, however, found at the S-RNase gene of
Solanaceae and Rosaceae species, as well as in Petunia
SLF and Prunus SFB genes [6,12,13,20-24]. Nevertheless,
recombination levels have been estimated at Prunus SRNase and SFB genes only [13,25,26]. Therefore it is
unclear whether the S-RNase gene experiences similar
recombination levels in distantly related species. Differences in recombination levels could, in principle, account
for some of the differences (for instance the very different
synonymous variability levels observed at the Solanaceae
and Rosaceae S-RNase gene, or the different number and
location of positively selected amino acid sites) observed
when comparing divergent species groups.
Vieira et al. [12] inferred 13, 17 and 27 positively
selected amino acid sites (those amino acid sites that
determine specificity differences) when analyzing 64, 88
and 37 S-RNase sequences from Solanaceae, Prunus and
Maloideae, respectively. The observed differences in the
number of positively selected amino acid sites may reflect
a true difference. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a
fraction of the positively selected amino acid sites may
have been missed when using PAML [27] and relatively
small number of lineages [28]. It should be noted that in
that study the size and location of the region analyzed is
similar but that there is little overlap between the positively selected amino acid sites identified in different species groups.
In Maloideae, the four regions (PS1 - PS4) identified by
Ishimizu et al. [29], for which the rate of non-synonymous substitutions exceeds that of synonymous substitutions (a sign of positive selection) are accessible to

Page 2 of 15

solvents, and located on either side of the Pyrus pyrifolia
S3-RNase active site cleft [30]. The first three PS regions
are hydrophilic and weakly basic, but PS4 is neutral and
hydrophobic. Matsuura et al. [30] argue that it is unlikely
that a single protein could interact with all four PS
regions. Therefore, these authors predict that multiple Spollen proteins should interact with the S-RNase simultaneously. It should be noted that the structure of the Pyrus
pyrifolia S3-RNase active site is similar to that observed
in other T2-RNases. Indeed, the entire S-RNase mainchain frame works superimposes well with T2- RNases, in
particular the core structures composed of three α-helices and four β-strands. Moreover, even the hypervariable
regions present the same secondary elements- one loop
and one α-helix.
Different pollen rejection mechanisms are observed in
Prunus and Solanaceae. SFB deletion or truncation is
observed in Prunus pollen-part mutants that confer unilateral incompatibility by loss of pollen function (Table 1
from [31]), suggesting that S-pollen expression is necessary for pollen rejection [32,33]. Furthermore in tetraploid Prunus species, heteroallelic pollen with two
different SFB genes is self-incompatible [34]. Therefore,
there is no evidence for competitive interaction in Prunus. In this system, the S-pollen protein is assumed to
protect self S-RNases from being inhibited by a general SRNase inhibitor [35]. Nevertheless, in Solanaceae, the
pollen S determinant is assumed to inhibit all S-RNases
except that of the corresponding S-haplotype [36,37].
This model would explain why heteroallelic pollen with
two different S-pollen genes is self-compatible (competitive interaction) [16,17,38]. Both models imply the inhibition of the S-RNase cytoxicity. A very different model has
been proposed in Nicotiana where S-RNases are compartmentalized in pollen tubes and other proteins such as
HT-B (a non-pollen protein) play a fundamental role in Sspecific pollen rejection, although they are not involved
in determining S-pollen specificity [39]. In this model,
however, it is not clear how S-RNase-SLF interaction controls HT-B degradation and membrane breakdown, but
pollen specificity is only determined by the SLF gene.
There is no information on the role of conservative and
non-conservative amino acid changes on the creation of
new specificities. Nevertheless, a model has been proposed where new specificities arise through a series of
intermediate mutational steps. The more divergent the
new protein is from the original one, less likely it is to be
misrecognized as the original one [40].
Despite the argument put forward by Raspé and Kohn
[41] that few alleles have evolved since the most recent
common ancestor of Maloideae species, estimates of the
rate at which new specificities arise, based on a large
number of sequences, are only available for Prunus [26].

Therefore, it is unknown whether specificities arise at
similar rates in distantly related species groups showing
RNase based GSI. It is also unclear whether similar specificity numbers are to be found in distantly related species
groups, the degree of specificity sharing between closely
related species, or the effect of the history of the species
group being considered.
In conclusion, although all these issues are clearly
important in order to understand GSI evolution, most of
them have been addressed for the Prunus species group
only [26]. Therefore, in this work we investigate them in
the Maloideae species group. The comparison of the two
divergent Rosaceae species groups that have been diverging for a minimum of 32 million years [42] may shed light
on which issues are likely to be general.

Methods
Datasets and sequence alignment

Sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database using
BLAST and GenBank accession AF016920 as a query.
Identical sequences were discarded. For the phylogenetic
analyses, two Maloideae S-RNase datasets were used,
namely a set of 69 complete sequences (D69) and a set of
104 partial sequences (D104) covering the same region as
that analyzed by Vieira et al. [12]. Accession numbers can
be found in Additional file 1 Table S1. Translated amino
acid sequences were aligned using the accurate CLUSTALW algorithm as implemented in DAMBE [43]. This
amino acid alignment was used as a guide to obtain the
corresponding nucleotide alignment. The resulting alignment is slightly different from that used in Vieira et al.
[12]. It should be noted, however, that alignment gaps
represent less than 4% of the number of aligned positions.
The same sequence alignment was used for the set of 69
and 104 sequences.

Divergence estimates

Per site non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) rates
were estimated using DNasp [44]. Values are Jukes-Cantor corrected for multiple hits.
Sequence relationships determination

Linearized Minimum Evolution trees were obtained
using amino acid sequences and the MEGA software [45]
while Bayesian trees were obtained using MrBayes [46],
and nucleotide sequences. The GTR model of sequence
evolution was used, thus allowing for among-site rate
variation and a proportion of invariable sites. For large
data sets containing very divergent sequences this is
almost always the best fit model of sequence evolution
[47]. Third codon positions were also allowed to have a
gamma distribution shape parameter that is different
from that of first and second codon positions. Two simultaneous and completely independent analyzes, starting
from random trees, were run for 500,000 generations
(each with one cold and three heated chains). Samples
were taken every 100th generation. The first 1250 samples were discarded (burn-in). Parsimony networks were
obtained using TCS1.21 [48] with the 90% connectivity
limit.
Evidence for recombination

In order to gather evidence for recombination in the
Maloideae datasets, phylogenetic methods were used (the
single breakpoint analysis and GARD), as implemented in
datamonkey server http://www.datamonkey.org/[49].
Estimating the relative importance of recombination and
mutation at the Maloideae S-RNase gene

We use the same approach as in Vieira et al.[25,26].
Briefly, in order to infer the number of independent
recombination events implied by a given data set, the
RDP software [50] was used. The following methods

Vieira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/200

(with default options) were used: RDP, Chimaera,
BootScan, 3Seq, GeneConv, MaxChi, and SiScan. A given
sequence was inferred to be recombinant if at least one of
the methods identified a recombination tract in that
sequence with a probability < 0.05. For each data set, the
total number of synonymous mutations implied by the
data was inferred using Yang's [27] methodology, under
the appropriate model (see below).
Identification of positively selected amino acid sites

Both a phylogenetic (PAML 3.13) [27], and a population
genetics approach (OmegaMap) [51] were used to identify positively selected amino acid sites. Amino acid sites
without alignment gaps were considered as positively
selected if one of the two methods used identifies them
with a posterior probability higher than 95% and the
other method identifies them with a posterior probability
higher than 50%. Amino acid sites with alignment gaps
are not considered for analysis by the phylogenetic
method. Therefore, amino acid sites with alignment gaps
are considered as positively selected if they are identified
by the population genetics approach with a posterior
probability higher than 95%.
When using PAML 3.13 [27], the maximum-likelihood
tree that was specified was obtained with PAUP [52] after
using Modeltest [53] to find the simplest model of nucleotide sequence evolution that best fits the data, according
to the Akaike information criterion.
When using OmegaMap, a total of 250000 iterations
and a burn-in of 25000 were used. Ten random sequence
orders were used and all codons were assumed to be at
equal frequencies. The size of the codon block used is 30.
One objective and one subjective approach were used
when specifying the priors. We used the same priors as in
Vieira et al. [25,26]. Therefore we are assuming low
recombination rates.
Protein surface estimates

The Surface Racer program [54] was used to calculate the
Accessible Surface Area (ASA) and the Molecular Surface
Area (MolSurf ) for the Solanaceae (1IOO; Nicotiana
alata) and Rosaceae (1IQQ; Pyrus pyrifolia) S-RNase
structures available on the PDB database http://
www.rcsb.org[55].
Locating positively selected amino acid sites on the SRNase structure

In order to determine the location of positively selected
amino acid sites on the S-RNase 3 D structure, the available structures on PDB http://www.rcsb.org[55] were
used, namely 1IOO (Nicotiana alata; Solanaceae), and
1IQQ (Pyrus pyrifolia; Rosaceae). When using sequences
from Prunus (Rosaceae) or Maloideae species (Rosaceae),
the 1IQQ structure was used. When using sequences
from Solanaceae species the 1IOO structure was used.

Positively selected amino acid sites were mapped on a reference sequence that was aligned with the sequence corresponding to the relevant crystal structure using
CLUSTALW
with
default
parameters
http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/. The VMD software http://
www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/[56] was used to obtain
graphical representations.
Locating lysine residues that might be important for
ubiquitylation on the S-RNase structure

For Solanaceae, the Petunia inflata S3 RNase sequence
(accession number: AAA33727) was used, since there is
experimental data for this protein regarding ubiquitylation [57]. For Maloideae and Prunus, there is no experimental data regarding ubiquitylation, and thus the degree
of conservation of lysine residues was used, under the
assumption that functionally important lysine residues
are expected to be conserved. Thus, one sequence from
Maloideae (the M. domestica St sequence from the 69
complete sequence dataset here used) and one from Prunus (the P. aviumS12 sequence from the 88 sequence
dataset [12]), showing the highest number of lysine residues were selected. Then, for each of the lysine residues
on those sequences the degree of conservation in the
entire dataset was determined. Lysine residues were then
located on the S-RNase structure, using different color
codes, in order to reflect their degree of conservation, as
described in the previous Material and Methods section.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses

Figure 1 shows the inferred relationship of S-RNase
sequences using a Bayesian approach. Alleles are
expected to be maintained for long periods of time when
under frequency dependent selection [58-60]. Based on
divergence at molecular level as well as inter-fertility,
meiotic pairing of chromosomes from different genera,
and graft compatibility [see references in [61]], Malus,
Pyrus, Sorbus and Crataegus could be closely related genera.
Moreover, the average terminal branch length of the
Maloideae S-RNases is small, and similar to those
observed in species whose S-alleles underwent a burst of
recent diversification, thus, suggesting a recent origin
[62]. The common ancestor to these genera, under the
assumption of 32 My for the split between the
Prunoideae and Maloideae lineages [42] and a molecular
clock for the trnL-trnF, RpoC1, rbcL, matk, 5.8 S ribosomal RNA, ITS1 and ITS2 genes, is on average, 6.5 million years (ranging from 2.25 to 11.81 million years;
Aguiar et al., unpublished). It should be noted that, under
the assumption of a mutation rate similar to other dicot
plants, Sanzol et al. [63] dates the Maloideae origin to
between 6-15 million years ago. In 2010, Dobeš and Paul

[64] dated the split between Prunus and Spiraea to 26.9
to 51.8 million years. Since Spiraea is more closely related
to Malus/Pyrus than to Prunus [65] the Malus/Pyrus split
must be younger than 26.9 - 51.8 million years. It should
be noted, however, that this interpretation is far from
being consensual. Based on the fossil record the
Maloideae lineage appears to extend back to the Middle
Eocene at 37-48 My [42,61,63]. The observation that a
fossil shares similarities with living species of a given
family does not indicate, however, that the fossil taxa is
part of the crown group of living species [42]. DeVore and
Pigg [66] note that fossils with rosaceous affinities sometimes demonstrate a mosaic of characters of several
extant taxa and are difficult to place systematically. Nevertheless, the young age here inferred for Maloideae,
based on molecular data and the assumption of a molecular clock, has dramatic biogeographic implications given
the distribution of the genera and the history of plate tectonic movements [67]. Campbell et al. [61] suggest that
the genera Malus, Pyrus and Sorbus, among others, are
the result of an ancient, rapid radiation associated with a
low mutation rate. This hypothesis can be tested because
an estimate of the mutation rate can be obtained independently of the fossil record using the formula θ = 4Neμ
where θ is the average genetic diversity, Ne is the effective
population size, and μ the mutation rate [68,69]. An estimate of the effective population size can be obtained
from the number of S-alleles present in natural populations, that, as shown in the Specificity numbers section
(see below), is smaller than 10000 individuals. The θ value
has been estimated for Malus [70] and Pyrus [71]. For
Pyrus, the average per site silent nucleotide diversity
ranges from 0.00466 to 0.11603. For Malus, where a large
number of ESTs were analyzed, one SNP was found every
149 bp. Under the assumption that most SNPs are likely
neutral and that third codon positions are nearly neutral,
an estimate of 0.02 (1/149 × 3) is obtained. These values
are similar to those estimated for Potentilla European,
North American and Asian populations (ranging from
0.0116 0.0219) [64]. When the diversity values are used in
the above mentioned equation, an estimate of 5 × 10-7 and
a minimum estimate of 1.2 × 10-7 is obtained for the
mutation rate (per site per generation) for Malus and
Pyrus, respectively. These values are much higher than
those obtained for Drosophila, for instance (on the order
of 10-9) [72,73].
It could be argued that overlapping generations and
between species hybridization could inflate within species variability levels and thus inflate the mutation rate
estimates. Nevertheless, Raspé and Kohn [41] found no
evidence for hybridization when looking at the Sorbus
aucuparia, Crataegus monogyna, Malus domestica and
Pyrus species S-RNase gene. It should be noted that

Page 6 of 15

under the assumption that the average generation time
for a Pyrus or Malus tree is on the order of 25 to 50 years,
when using the above calculated mutation rates, the
range of estimated silent site divergence for two species
that have been evolving independently for 5 million years
is in between 0.012 and 0.10, similar to the silent divergence values usually obtained for Pyrus and Malus gene
comparisons. In order to fit the molecular data to the
dates suggested by the fossil record for the Malus/Pyrus
lineage split (Middle Eocene, 37-48 My), an average generation time on the order of 500 years must be argued.
Given that, at present, the reasons for the observed discrepancy between the fossil record and the molecular
data are unknown, the dating of the Pyrus/Malus split
should be regarded with caution. It should be noted that,
in this work, the only place where this becomes an important issue is in this section. It should be noted that important discrepancies between the fossil record and
molecular dating are observed for other Rosaceae subtribes. For instance, Dobeš and Paul [64] find important
discrepancies between the fossil record and molecular
dating for the old Fragariinae lineages but not for the dating of the Fragariinae genera (see Table two of [64]).
Although few polytomies are shown in the tree shown
in Figure 1, most of the sequence relationships seem to be
well resolved. The oldest Maloideae specificity lineages
seem to be about 23 million years old, a number that
compares well with that observed for the Prunus species
group (15-20 million years old) [26] using the same methodology (a linearized amino acid Minimum Evolution
tree and the assumption that 1% amino acid divergence at
the S-RNase gene corresponds to one million years [26];
data not shown). Nevertheless, under the assumption
that the Malus/Pyrus lineage split occurred in Middle
Eocene at around 37-48 My), the oldest Maloideae specificity lineages must be much older. As noted above, the
maintenance of allele specificities for long periods of time
is a feature of self-incompatibility systems [58-60].
Evidence for recombination at the S-RNase gene

The S-locus is expected to be located in a region with
suppressed recombination levels. Furthermore, most of
the rare recombination events are expected to be short
gene conversion events because they are less likely to
result in specificity changes. Thus, at the S-RNase, gene
conversion is expected to be much less important than
mutation. When using the single breakpoint analysis, as
implemented in the datamonkey server [49] (see Material
and Methods), and the dataset of 69 complete sequences
(the alignment is 708 positions long and there are 54
gapped positions), a model that assumes a recombination
breakpoint at site 433 fits significantly better the data
(when using the cAIC (corrected Akaike information criteria) an improvement of 515.6 is obtained). When using

Vieira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/200

GARD a similar result is obtained. The cAIC score of the
best fitting GARD model, the one that allows for different
topologies between segments (22726.5), is preferred over
the model that assumes the same tree for all the partitions but allows different branch lengths between partitions (23358.9). Thus, at least one of the breakpoints
reflects a true topological incongruence (the one inferred
at position 414; P < 0.01; Kishino Hasegawa topological
incongruence test). The dataset containing 104 partial SRNase sequences is too large to be analyzed using the
datamonkey server.
Given the evidence for recombination, we estimated
the relative importance of gene conversion and mutation,
using the approach described in Vieira et al. [26]. The
number of inferred independent recombination events is
17 and six when using the dataset containing 69 complete
or 104 partial S-RNase sequences, respectively. The number of inferred synonymous mutations is 571.1 and 484.9,
respectively. Therefore, 0.030 and 0.012 recombination
events per synonymous mutation are inferred, respectively. In Figure 1, the inferred recombinant lineages
(when using the dataset containing 104 sequences) are
shown in bold. At least 19.2% of all sequences used seem
to show evidence for an ancestral recombination event.
Identification of positively selected amino acid sites

In the only report concerning the identification of positively selected amino acid sites in Maloideae S-RNases, 37
partial N- and C-terminal sequences were used [12]. In
order to make meaningful comparisons with the Prunus
findings, where large datasets have been used (N = 88;
[12]) it is important to infer most positively selected
amino acid sites in the Maloideae S-RNase protein. At
present, in GenBank, there are 104 partial and 69 complete non-redundant Maloideae S-RNase sequences.
Therefore we can also address if the first 39 and last 33
amino acid positions of the Maloideae S-RNase protein,
not analyzed before, harbor positively selected amino
acid sites. Using the same criteria as in Vieira et al.[12],
there is evidence for positively selected amino acid sites
all over the protein but not in the first 67 amino acid positions (Figure 2). Thus, an effort should be made in future
works to include the complete C-terminal end of the protein.
By performing simulations in EVOLVER, Castric and
Vekemans [28] revealed that the power for the maximum
likelihood analysis with CODEML is low when sequences
were only slightly divergent or when sequence divergence
reached saturation, and that it increases at intermediate
levels of divergence. Since it is difficult to determine how
many and what sequences should be used in order to be
able to detect all positively selected amino acid sites, here,
we use two different datasets (69 complete and 104 partial S-RNase sequences). In the ungapped region that

could be compared, four and one new positively selected
amino acid sites were identified when increasing the sample size from 37 (the dataset used in [12]) to 69 and from
69 to 104, respectively. Unexpectedly, five and six amino
acid positions were no longer recognized as positively
selected when increasing the sample size from 37 to 69
and from 69 to 104, respectively.
When the sample size is increased from 37 to 69, in two
out of the five cases the probability of the amino acid site
being positively selected drops from above 80% to below
50% when using the phylogenetic method. In the other
three cases the probability of the amino acid site being
positively selected remains high when using the phylogenetic method but drops below 50% when using the population genetics method. On the other hand, when the
sample size is increased from 69 to 104, in four out of the
six cases where the amino acid site is no longer recognized as being positively selected, the probability of the
amino acid site being positively selected drops from
above 95% to below 60% when using the phylogenetic
method. In the other two cases the probability of the
amino acid site being positively selected remains high
when using the phylogenetic method but, drops below
50% when using the population genetics method.
There is evidence for recombination in the datasets and
thus it could be argued that only OmegaMap [51] should
be used. When using only OmegaMap and amino acid
sites that have more than 95% probability of being positively selected, nine and four new positively selected
amino acid sites are detected when using the D69 and
D104 datasets, respectively. Nevertheless, these are
located within blocks of positively selected amino acids,
and thus, since a block of size 30 was used, these could be
false positives. It should be noted that 12 and five positively selected amino acid sites are no longer identified
when using this criteria and the D69 and D104 datasets,
respectively (Figure 2).
In order to be conservative and to be able to compare
with published results using the same criteria, we considered as positively selected only those amino sites that
obey to the criteria used in Vieira et al. [12], and that are
found when using the 104 sequence data set. Moreover,
we also considered as positively selected those amino acid
sites that were identified as such, in the regions not covered by the 104 sequence dataset, when using the dataset
with 69 sequences. In total, there are 33 non-gapped and
seven gapped positively selected amino acid sites (Figure
2).

of Vieira et al. [12]; D69 - the 69 sequence dataset (complete sequences); D104 - the 104 sequence dataset. The region that is not analysed when using
the D37 and the D104 datasets is shown in bold and italics, respectively. * - non-gapped positively selected amino acid sites; # - gapped positively
selected amino acid sites. In gray are shown the amino acids that are identified as positively selected when using OmegaMap only. It should be noted
that, the alignment used in Vieira et al. [12] is not the same as that used for the D69 and D104 datasets.

tively selected amino acid sites should be located at the
surface of the protein, the average exposed surface is
higher for positively selected amino acid sites than for
non-positively selected amino acid sites (for the
Maloideae D69, Maloideae D104 and Prunus datasets
and for both measures P <0.001; for Solanaceae and for
both measures P <0.01; non-parametric Mann-Whitney
test). For the Prunus and Solanaceae datasets, depending
on the method used, in between 19-22% of the S-RNase
exposed surface is occupied by positively selected amino
acid sites. In Maloideae, positively selected amino acid
sites represent in between 27.9 and 33.0% of the protein
surface. This difference is observed even when the same
region is analysed (compare the Maloideae D104, the
Prunus and Solanaceae datasets).
It could be argued that the exposed surface occupied by
positively selected amino acid sites is the same in the
datasets being compared, but that in some datasets not all
positively selected amino acid sites were identified. Nevertheless, the Prunus (88 sequences) and Solanaceae (64
sequences) datasets analysed in Vieira et al. [12] are large.
Thus, at least in the case of Prunus, it seems unlikely that
increasing the dataset from 88 to 104 sequences (as in the
Maloideae dataset) would lead to a substantial (about
20%) increase in the number of identified positively
selected amino acid sites.
Figure 3 shows the location of positively selected amino
acid sites on the 3 D structure. Positively selected amino
acid sites are found in clusters on the Pyrus crystal structure, mostly around the active site pocket region. The
data available for Solanaceae and Prunus is, so far, compatible with this view.
Distribution of lysine residues that may be important for
ubiquitylation

It has been suggested that, in Petunia inflata (Solanaceae), the S-pollen component may target non-self
RNases for ubiquitin/26 S proteasome-mediated degradation [36,37,57]. The recognition signal for degradation

by the 26 S proteasome is a polyubiquitin chain that is
usually attached to a lysine residue in the target protein
[74]. Therefore, Hua and Kao [57] mutated to arginine all
of the 20 lysine residues present at the Petunia inflata S3RNase. This approach led to the identification of six
lysine residues near the C-terminus that, when mutated,
significantly reduce ubiquitination and degradation of the
S-RNase.
Although RNase based GSI seems to have evolved only
once [3-6] there are no conserved lysine residues in all SRNases that could serve as common ubiquitylation sites
[75]. However, it is conceivable that in different species,
different lysine residues perform this function. Not all
lysine residues need, however, to be involved in ubiquitylation. Indeed, in Solanaceae S-RNases, the three most
well conserved lysine residues, located in conserved
regions C4 and C5, are not important for ubiquitylation
[57,76]. In Figure 4, in both Maloideae and Prunus there
are lysine residues that are present in more than 75% frequency that are located in the same region as those identified in Petunia inflata S3 RNase as being important for
ubiquitylation.
Amino acid changes observed at positively selected amino
acid sites

Little is known about the type of amino acid changes
involved in the creation of new specificities. While it
could be argued that conservative amino acid changes are
likely more viable given the constraints imposed by the SRNase 3 D structure, it could also be argued that nonconservative amino acid changes likely result in more
drastic changes and thus, could more easily be recognized as different specificities. This is an important issue
since, for instance, in the generator model not all amino
acid changes are supposed to be equally clearly distinguished as a new specificity [40].
In order to determine the type of amino acid changes
observed at positively selected amino acid sites, closely
related sequences must be used since this approach

Material and Methods).

reduces the risk of wrong inference, due to multiple
mutations at the same codon. Thus, for this analysis, we
used only those sets of sequences that could be connected
in a parsimony network with a connectivity limit of 90%.
The parsimony networks imply a minimum of 48 independent replacement mutations at positively selected
amino acid sites.
When charge, volume and polarity are considered the
following groups of amino acids can be defined RHK, DE,
NQ, C, AGPST, ILMV, and FWY. According to this classification, at positively selected amino acid sites, conservative amino acid changes represent 54% of all amino acid
changes. Based on a large number of proteins, about 35%
of the changes are expected to be conservative (see Figure
four in [77]).

Rate of appearance of new specificities

In order to confirm if two different S-RNase sequences
represent different specificities, ideally crosses should be
made between individuals harboring these sequences.
Although technically possible, these experiments are very
time consuming. Moreover, often, when studying individuals from natural populations this is not possible, since
individuals are not marked in the field, and/or because it
implies to cross different species [26]. In addition, when
crosses are performed between different species, factors
other than S-specificities may determine whether viable
progeny is obtained [1]. An estimate of the rate of appearance of new specificities can be, however, obtained under
the assumption that a single amino acid change at a positively selected amino acid site is enough to create a new
specificity. The same assumption has also been used in

Vieira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/200

Prunus [12]. It should be noted that in Prunus spinosa
two S-RNase alleles that differ in only one amino acid
position identified as being under positive selection have
been found in the same individual [11]. Since different
sets of positively selected amino acid sites are inferred
when using different data sets, in an attempt to be conservative we use only those sites inferred to be positively
selected, when using the largest data set. Thus, since this
data set does not cover the entire gene and positively
selected amino acid sites were identified in the regions
not included, this could be an underestimate. The
approach here used is identical to that in Vieira et al.[26].
Additional file 2 Table S2 shows the per site synonymous
(Ks) and non-synonymous values (Ka), number of amino
acid differences, and number of amino acid differences at
positively selected amino acid sites between closely
related sequences (pairs of sequences with an estimated
amino acid divergence smaller than 5% when using a linearized Minimum Evolution tree). Using this data the
estimated rate is one new specificity per 7.7% synonymous divergence, or alternatively 1.92% nonsynonymous
divergence. For comparative purposes, it should be mentioned that the estimated rate in Prunus is one new specificity per 5.1% synonymous divergence [26]. In
Maloideae, for pairs of closely related amino acid
sequences, 26.5% of all amino acid changes are observed
at positively selected amino acid sites. Nevertheless, at
the S-RNase, the fraction of positively selected amino
acid sites is only 14.6%.
Specificity numbers

The assumption that sequences with more than 5%
amino acid divergence represent different specificities, as
assumed in Vieira et al. [26], seems reasonable given: i)
the above estimate of one amino acid change at a positively selected amino acid site every 1.92% nonsynonymous divergence units; ii) assuming a Poisson
distribution, the probability that a sequence pair showing
more than 5.8% non-synonymous divergence does not
have a hit at a positively selected amino acid site is less
than 5%. Table 2 shows the number of estimated specificities for different Maloideae genera under this assumption. Inferences made using natural population samples
led to estimates of 40 or less alleles [41]. Such numbers
are compatible with effective population sizes smaller
than 10000 [26] and are close to our estimate of 35 specificities for the ancestral Maloideae population. Table 3
shows the percentage of ancestral specificities shared
between Maloideae genera. At least 15% of the ancestral
specificities are shared among genera. Nevertheless, this
number could be greatly underestimated due to the small
sample size for some genera. For instance, for the Malus/
Pyrus and the Malus/Sorbus comparison this number is
52% and 65%, respectively. This is not surprising given

that the number of specificities inferred to be present in
the ancestral Maloideae species (35 specificities) is not
much higher than the number found in each genus (Table
2).

Discussion
In order to avoid GSI breakdown the S-pistil and S-pollen
genes must co-evolve. Nevertheless, at the Maloideae SRNase gene, as well as in Prunus S-RNase and SFB genes,
and in Petunia S-RNase, there is evidence for recombination [6,12,13,20-24]. Indeed, 19.2% of the available
Maloideae S-RNase sequences show evidence of a recombination event. Since the sequences that show evidence of
the same recombination event are often from different
genera, the inferred recombination events must be old
(Figure 1). Most of the inferred recombination events are
assumed to be short intragenic gene conversion events
that did not result in amino acid changes at the positively
selected amino acid sites that determine specificity differences. For the Maloideae group of species, in between
0.012 and 0.030 recombination events are inferred per
synonymous mutation. The first estimate (0.012) compares well with the estimate obtained for the Prunus SRNase and SFB genes (0.013 and 0.011 respectively) [25]
while the second estimate is closer to that obtained for a
gene in the S-locus region that is not involved in specificity determination (the Prunus SLF1 gene; for this gene the
estimate is 0.022) [25]. Given the likely high variance
associated with these estimates, we can conclude that the
Prunus and Maloideae S-RNase genes experience similar
recombination levels. Given that Prunus and Maloideae
species have been diverging for at least 32 million years
[42,63,64], low levels of intragenic recombination (on the
order of one recombination event per 30 90 synonymous
substitutions) are likely to be a general feature of S-RNase
based GSI systems.
The effect of the use of different datasets, when using a
phylogenetic approach [27], on the identification of positively selected amino acid sites is here addressed. For the
ungapped region that could be compared, increasing the
sample size from 37 to 69 and from 69 to 104, leads to the

identification of five and one new positively selected
amino acid sites, respectively. Therefore, it seems that, at
least for Maloideae, a sample size on the order of 100
sequences is needed in order to be able to detect the vast
majority of positively selected sites. Positively selected
amino acid sites were identified in the last 41 amino acids
of the S-RNase protein, when using the set of 69 S-RNase
complete sequences. Thus, in the future an effort should
be made to include this region when characterizing SRNase alleles. When using smaller sample sizes, positively selected amino acid sites are identified that when
the sample size is increased are no longer identified. This
unexpected behavior is difficult to understand, since
there is no clear pattern in the results obtained, but
should be seriously considered, since it is observed even
when 69 sequences are used.
Here, for the S-RNase Maloideae sequences, we infer
the presence of 33 ungapped positively selected amino
acid sites. For comparison, when the same S-RNase
region is considered, 17 [12] and 24 ungapped positively
selected amino acid sites are detected in the Prunus and
Maloideae species groups, respectively. Taking into
account that about 100 sequences seem to be enough to
detect the vast majority of positively selected amino acid
sites, and that in the Prunus analyses 88 S-RNase
sequences were used [12], it seems likely that there are
more positively selected amino acid sites at the S-RNase
locus in the Maloideae than in the Prunus species group.
Ma and Oliveira [78] and Sassa et al. [14] suggested that
the S-RNase alleles of Maloideae diverged more recently
than those of Prunus. The higher Ka/Ks ratio in Maloideae
than in Prunus, observed by Ma and Oliveira [78] and
Vieira et al. [12], that is confirmed when using large sample sizes for the same region (for Maloideae based on the
104 sequence set here used: Ka = 0.219; Ks = 0.227; for
Prunus based on the 88 sequence set used by Vieira et al.
[12]: Ka = 0.143; Ks = 0.241), may be mainly due to the
presence of more positively selected amino acid sites in
Maloideae than in Prunus.
Positively selected amino acids seem to be spread over
the entire protein, as remarked before [12,79], with the
exception of the first 67 amino acids (Figure 2). Based on

these inferences, and the assumption that a single difference at a positively selected amino acid is enough to create a new specificity, one new specificity is estimated to
appear every 7.7% per site synonymous divergence or
alternatively every 1.92% per site nonsynonymous divergence. For comparative purposes, it should be mentioned
that the estimated rate in Prunus is one new specificity
every 5.1% per site synonymous divergence [26].
When charge, volume and polarity are considered, at
positively selected amino acid sites, 46% of all changes are
non-conservative amino acid changes. It is conceivable
that nonconservative amino acid changes at positively
selected amino acid sites are more strongly selected than
conservative amino acid changes at those same sites,
since the new specificity could be more easily recognizable as being different from the original specificity. Nevertheless, there are more conservative changes than
expected (54% rather than the expected frequency of 35%
[77]). It should be pointed out that, in the generator
model, new specificities are created through several steps
where intermediate steps have some chance of not being
recognized as a new specificity [40]. Very likely, old specificities are replaced by the newly evolved specificities,
due to the small effective population size of each specificity. Old specificities may, however, be brought back to the
population by migration from other populations [80].
Although less than 22 sequences are deposited in GenBank for the most studied Maloideae species (Additional
file 1 Table S1), for S. aucuparia 40 different specificities
have been inferred [41]. In the ancestral to the Malus,
Pyrus and Sorbus genera, at least 35 different specificities
are inferred to have been present. This observation is
compatible with no great changes in population size in
the recent history of the Maloideae species here studied,
in contrast with what seems to have happened in the
recent history of Prunus species [6,26].
Positively selected amino acid sites are found in clusters
on the Pyrus crystal structure, mostly around the active
site pocket region. Thus, we find no support for Matsuura et al. [30] conclusion that multiple S-pollen proteins must bind the S-RNase protein simultaneously. In
Maloideae, about 30% of the exposed protein surface is

Vieira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/200

made of positively selected amino acid sites. For comparison, in Prunus, where only one gene is responsible for
determining S-pollen specificity, only 22% of the exposed
protein surface is made of positively selected amino acid
sites. In Solanaceae, where a single S-pollen gene seems
to be involved [16,38,81,82] about 20% of the exposed
protein surface is made of positively selected amino acid
sites. It should be noted that the S-RNase crystal structure is very similar to the structure observed in other T2RNases.
Different pollen rejection mechanisms have been proposed for Solanaceae [36,37] and Prunus[35], while for
Maloideae, models involving one or several S-pollen proteins and multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed [14].
In Solanum/Petunia, the pollen S determinant is
assumed to inhibit all S-RNases except that of the corresponding S-haplotype [36,37]. This may be achieved
through the ubiquitylation of non-self S-RNases that are
targeted to the 26 S proteosome [57]. As shown in this
work, the relative locations of positively selected amino
acid sites and lysine residues experimentally verified to be
important for ubiquitylation [57] are compatible with the
view that the S-pollen protein (an F-box protein) could
ubiquitylate the S-RNase. It should be noted that under
this model, amino acid sites involved in specificity determination are the ones impeding the binding of the selfcompatible pollen protein. The compartmentalization
model inferred for Nicotiana (another Solanaceae genus)
also predicts an interaction between the non-self pollen
protein and the S-RNase. In the absence of such an interaction, the HT-B protein disrupts the vacuolar compartment where S-RNases are sequestered releasing them
into the cytoplasm of the growing pollen tube, thus leading to pollen tube growth arrest. When a non-self pollen
protein interacts with the S-RNase the HT-B protein is
degraded and S-RNases remain sequestered in the vacuolar compartment [39]. The role of protein ubiquitylation
is unclear in this model since there is no need to degrade
the S-RNase if it remains on the vacuolar compartment.
It should be noted, that Nicotiana S-RNase sequences
show at high frequency two lysine residues in the same
region where six lysine residues important for ubiquitylation have been identified in the P. inflata S3 RNase protein (data not shown).
In Prunus, the S-pollen protein is assumed to protect
self S-RNases from being inhibited by a general S-RNase
inhibitor [35]. It is conceivable that the general inhibitor
binds the S-RNase active site pocket, thus inhibiting
RNase activity. If true, then it could be predicted that selfcompatible S-pollen protein should bind the active
pocket region, thus impeding the binding of the general
inhibitor. It should be noted that, in the inferred Prunus

Page 13 of 15

S-RNase structure, there are lysine residues, that are
highly conserved, and that are located in the same region
where lysine residues important for S-RNase ubiquitylation have been described in Petunia. Given the relative
locations of positively selected amino acid sites and these
lysine residues, it seems plausible that the same protein
could interact with both. The role of protein ubiquitylation (if any) is unclear in this model. It can be, however,
hypothesized that the putative S-RNase inhibitor could
label the S-RNase protein for degradation by the proteasome through ubiquitylation of the above mentioned
lysine residues. This would explain why in Prunus, deletion of the S pollen component (the SFB gene) leads to
self-compatibility. Furthermore, by binding to the SRNase, the self S-pollen component would protect the SRNase from ubiquitylation and consequent degradation
by the proteasome. This model makes two important predictions, namely, that the so called general inhibitor is
able to ubiquitylate the S-RNase, that deletion of the general inhibitor should result in generalized self-incompatibility, and thus be lethal.
Maloideae species are more closely related to Prunus
species than to Solanaceae species. Therefore, it could be
argued that the model developed for Prunus should be
considered the working hypothesis. Nevertheless, there is
no evidence for competitive interaction in Prunus, in
contrast to what is observed in Solanaceae and Maloideae
species [1]. Thus, it seems more logical to consider the
models described in Solanaceae as working hypotheses
for Maloideae. It should, however, be noted that in
Maloideae multiple genes have been proposed as the Spollen [14]. So far, none of the models proposed for other
species include this possibility. There are highly conserved lysine residues in the region where six lysine residues important for ubiquitylation have been identified in
the P. inflata S3 RNase protein. Thus, the working
hypothesis being considered for Maloideae should take
into account the possible role of lysine ubiquitylation.

Conclusion
There are many similarities between the GSI system of
Prunus and Maloideae (variability levels at the S-RNase,
low levels of intragenic recombination, age, the possible
role of lysine ubiquitylation) as expected, since RNase
based GSI seems to have evolved only once before the
separation of the Asterideae and Rosideae [6]. Nevertheless, there are also many important differences between
the two model systems (specificity numbers in the ancestral populations, number of positively selected amino
acid sites, and competitive interaction, for instance). How
such features changed during evolution remains a puzzling issue.
