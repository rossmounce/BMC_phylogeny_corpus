Abstract
Background: Computational biology is often associated with genetic or genomic studies only.
However, thanks to the increase of computational resources, computational models are
appreciated as useful tools in many other scientific fields. Such modeling systems are particularly
relevant for the study of complex systems, like the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases.
So far, mathematical models remain the main tool for the epidemiological and ecological analysis of
infectious diseases, with SIR models could be seen as an implicit standard in epidemiology.
Unfortunately, these models are based on differential equations and, therefore, can become very
rapidly unmanageable due to the too many parameters which need to be taken into consideration.
For instance, in the case of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in wildlife many different potential
host species could be involved in the life-cycle of disease transmission, and SIR models might not
be the most suitable tool to truly capture the overall disease circulation within that environment.
This limitation underlines the necessity to develop a standard spatial model that can cope with the
transmission of disease in realistic ecosystems.
Results: Computational biology may prove to be flexible enough to take into account the natural
complexity observed in both natural and man-made ecosystems. In this paper, we propose a new
computational model to study the transmission of infectious diseases in a spatially explicit context.
We developed a multi-agent system model for vector-borne disease transmission in a realistic
spatial environment.
Conclusion: Here we describe in detail the general behavior of this model that we hope will
become a standard reference for the study of vector-borne disease transmission in wildlife. To
conclude, we show how this simple model could be easily adapted and modified to be used as a
common framework for further research developments in this field.

Background
In a reductive way, computational biology is often assimilated to the study of genomes, genetic networks, or other
subjects at intra-host level. In this field, a deep insight has

been reached in phylogenetic reconstructions for instance
[1]. However, oddly enough, computational biology is
rarely associated with the study of larger systems such as
ecosystem dynamics. More specifically, despite a huge

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:435

amount of mathematical models which increasing complexity, little work has been done in computational biology to understand the transmission of disease agents in
natural populations and communities of hosts. In the current context of disease emergence [2], computational
modeling could become the tool of choice for dissecting
the complexity of mechanisms that can be at work to produce disease outbreaks.
So far, mathematical models have been mainly used for
epidemiological modeling. The prolific development of
mathematical models has been mostly caused by the existence of a standard model, the so-called SIR (or SEIR)
model. This "toy" model has been extensively studied and
applied [3,4] and it has proved to be particularly accurate
for many different biological questions, both in epidemiology [5,6] and evolution [7,8]. The strength of this model
relies on its adaptability [3] and simplicity of formulation,
despite its current complexity in generated patterns [9].
Spatial modeling suffers of a dramatic lack of this type of
reference models except for directly-transmitted diseases.
These diseases, where pathogens are transmitted between
individuals by close contacts, can be spatially analyzed
using an implicit standard model based on cellular
automata [10-13]. Some more complex models exist for
avian influenza [14], but they have been done in a prospective way. Other kinds of diseases have been poorly
studied in a spatial context, especially vector-borne diseases. These pathogens are transmitted between reservoir
individuals, which are generally vertebrate hosts, by the
bite of one vector individual, which is generally an haematophagous insect, such as a tick or a mosquito. Despite
an huge literature in a non-spatial context [15,3,16], spatial models are rare for vector-borne disease [17-19].
However, these models, built upon the framework of cellular automata, involve very simple systems with only one
vector and one reservoir species, when typically vectorborne diseases can locally involve several vector and reservoir species [20]. Hence, current approaches, i.e. mathematical modeling or cellular automata modeling, seems
to be unable to study vector-borne diseases with a large
host spectra within an heterogeneous environment. We
thus develop a spatial model, based upon the framework
of multi-agent systems [21], for multi-host vector-borne
diseases in realistic environments.
Four main categories of spatial models can be distinguished [11,12], depending on the kind of tools used and
the biological questions considered. The first one is the
reaction-diffusion system that is based on physical processes, and has been mainly used for vector-borne diseases
and more specifically for vector spreading [22]. It assumes
a continuous diffusion of vectors but it is likely to be not
the most suitable for realistic environments. The second is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/435

a model based on the network theory [23]. This theory has
supported studies on the impact of transport networks in
disease dynamics [24,25] and focuses on the properties of
the network studied. The third method is based on metapopulation theory [26]. This conceptual framework has
been widely used for the study of spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases, especially childhood diseases
[27,28]. However, despite that this theory has been widely
applied in conceptual frameworks, it focuses mainly on a
nation-wide scale [29,30] or at least on large-surface areas.
The last available tools are multi-agent systems [31], that
are based on cellular automata [32], but that are applied
in a more "cognitive" way. Boundaries between multiagent and cellular automata often seem mostly philosophical and semantic. An extensive literature on multiagent systems exists, especially in social sciences [33] and
ecology [21]. In epidemiology, despite some individualbased models for directly-transmitted diseases [34,14],
multi-agent systems have not yet been used to study vector-borne disease dynamics in spatial contexts.
Here, we describe a simple and robust multi-agent model
which can be easily extended to the study of more complex situations. Then, we show three extensions of our
model in the section "Examples of adaptability". The first
one is the possibility to integrate a real landscape derived
from a Geographical Information System (GIS) software.
Since this kind of input often requires highly-intensive
computing, we have then developed a parallel version of
our model. Finally, we show how the evolutionary
dynamics dimension of host-parasite systems can be integrated into our model.

Methods
Philosophy of this model
Earlier individual-based systems [14,34] were quite complex and used the computational framework to produce
very complicated models. The main target of these models
was to make predictions about possible future dynamics
of a given disease. We followed a totally different
approach in order to build a very simple model, and in
this paper we will: (i) give a clear and detailed description
of our simple spatial model to be used as a "reference" for
vector-borne diseases, (ii) define the core mechanisms of
vector-borne diseases in a spatial context that, hopefully,
will be used as reference for future studies (Additional file
1, section 2.1) and (iii) explain how this model could be
easily adapted to other disease situations. The theoretical
analysis putted in the supplementary informations has
been done with an high (and unrealistic) value of pathogen transmission to allow us an analysis without an huge
number of host individuals, both vectors and reservoirs.

Our epidemiological framework was inspired by the classical model proposed first by Kermarck and McK-endrick

[35] and most popularized by Anderson and May [3].
Accordingly, we classified the two types of hosts, i.e. vectors and reservoirs, involved in disease transmission into
four categories. Individuals are born in a "Susceptible",
not infected, state. Upon infection, individuals become
"Infected", but at this stage they are unable to infect other
hosts. Then, after a given "latency period", those individuals become "Infectious" and can infect other subjects.
Finally, after an "infectious period", individuals become
"Recovered" and they are immune against the disease
agent, with the exception of vector individuals which
remain infectious until their death [36]. However, some
vector-borne pathogen, like Plasmodium falciparum, could
develop an immunity in mosquito species. To remove this
limitation, an adaptation of "step" function is needed. We
assume that an immunity is developed into reservoir individuals despite that some pathogens do not lead to immunity for reservoir individuals [3]. To remove this
immunity, the field "infectious period" could be filled
with zero. It is important to note that this model has been
developed to study, in its current form, a virus transmitted
by mosquitoes species. However, our model is easily
adaptable for other kind of vector-borne diseases as we
discuss for different assumptions.
This model could be analyzed in both ways : (i) a conceptual way to study, for instance, the structure of spatio-temporal dynamics of vector-borne diseases and (ii) an
applied way by integrating real data, from a GIS for
instance, which allow us to track, and eventually to predict, the spatio-temporal dynamics of a given disease in a
given environment, like West Nile Fever in Southern
France for instance.
From an ecological point of view, the present model is
supported by a strong theoretical and empirical framework [37]. We assumed that host species were distributed
spatially and clustered within different specific ecological
habitats. Hence, host species within a habitat could not
leave their original habitat except within a given range of
tolerance value. This important parameter will be further
developed, especially in Additional file 1, section 2.2.
We developed this model in order to be able to study
dynamics of vector-borne diseases when multiple host
species are involved (Additional file 1, section 2.3); however it might also be applied to assess other scientific questions with similar objectives.
Components of the multi-agent system
We used an oriented-object approach in which a "class" is
an abstract pattern of a physical representation and an
"object" an instance of a class. Each class could be linked
to other classes by "attributes", which represent the properties of a class, or by "methods", which represent the dif-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/435

ferent functions applicable to each object. Our model was
implemented with the support of the SWARM platform
[38] and was developed in Java language.
The structure of our model, i.e. the relationships among
classes, is described in Figure 1. This UML (Unified Modeling Language) modeling shows the different parts of our
model. A "Host", which could be a vector or a reservoir
individual, can host one "Parasite" agent. All "Host"
objects are contained within a "World" object, which
comprises the computing representation of that physical
world. "Parasite" agents are also contained within this
"World" object. All these parts, and the most important
functions and attributes used, will be detailed hereafter.
Parasite
The "Parasite" class includes different characteristics
related only to the disease agent and the illness, such as
"Infectious Period", "Latency Period" and "Virulence".
These features can be applied to both vector and reservoir
species individuals. Since disease characteristics are in
reality a by-product of host and parasite life history-traits,
this simplification leads to some limitations of the model,
as we assume that parasite characteristics are exactly identical within vectors and reservoirs species. This approximation is acceptable for diseases with multiple vector and
reservoir species if parasite's influences are similar among
the different host species [3,39]. However, this approximation needs to be reduced if we want to address disease
transmission by different strains of a given parasite. Since
the main goal of the current work is to deal with a simple
disease system without evolutionary dynamics, this issue
will be discussed in the final "Examples of adaptability"
section.
Host
The "Host" class is the most important class in our model
and has different groups of attributes. The first one concerns the geographic localization of individuals. Hence,
host contains "x and "y" attributes that represent its geographical localization. For update purposes, we added
also the "future X" and "future Y" attributes, which contain future positions of a given host individual. These
attributes will be dynamically updated over time. The second group concerns species characteristics that do not
change over time. Within this group, we can distinguish
ecological life-history traits, such as "Offspring Size",
"Lifespan" and "Biting Rate", and spatial features, such as
"Moving Capacity" and "Habitat Tolerance". "Moving
Capacity" represents the area in pixels in which one host
is allowed to move, and "Habitat Tolerance", a core
parameter of our model, quantifies for each host species
how far, in pixels, one host is allowed to diffuse outside
its original habitat. To distinguish between vector and reservoir individuals, the "Biting Rate" attribute will be equal

Static UML modeling of our model
Static UML modeling of our model. The "Model Swarm" class, which contains the representation of the virtual world
where the pathogen agent circulates, contains links to all "Host" objects. The "Host" object can contain, or not, one "Parasite"
object if Host is infected, infectious or has been infected. All attributes and functions are detailed in the main text.
to "-1" for reservoir individuals and to the corresponding
biting rate for vectors. This attribute is assumed to be constant for mosquito-borne pathogens, but it could evolve
dynamically for tick-borne disease regarding the abundance of reservoir hosts involved. To study this kind of
vector-borne pathogen, this attribute have to be replaced
by a function involving the reservoir abundance.
We could have distinguished two different "Vector" and
"Reservoir" classes which inherit from the "Host" class.
However, we think that new classes inheriting from a
super-class should be created only in the presence of certain conditions. The first case is when the number of
inheriting classes is high or could be high. This is clearly
not our case since only two classes are definitively needed.
The second case is when the number of functions, which
have to be inherited from a super-class, is high. In our
case, only the function "recovering" would have to be
developed differently and the function "Move" partly in a
different way. Moreover, many functions of the "Model
Swarm" class use general properties of the host and do not
need to know whether a given individual is a vector or a
reservoir. Therefore, we chose to integrate "Vector" and
"Reservoir" particularities into a single "Host" class.
Finally, the "Index Habitat" and "Index Species" attributes
are used for computational purposes. These different characteristics will be the same among all individuals within a
given host species. However, a given "Index Species"

could have links with different "Index Habitats" (see
Additional file 1, section 3, to understand how files are
loaded). As already said for the "Parasite" class, host reactions (e.g. immune responses, mechanical responses,...)
against the parasite are not considered here, and all hostparasite interactions are accepted as being static in the
"Parasite" class but not for the "Competence" parameter.
This parameter is integrated into the "Host" class and represents the probability for a host individual to become
"Infectious" after a contact with an "Infectious" individual.
Landscape of habitats
Finally, landscape will be simply an array with the size of
the virtual world. This array will be contained into a class,
"Model Swarm", which contains different functions that
impact on the landscape. This is an array of Integer values
that correspond to indexes of habitats that will be linked
to the Host's "Index Habitat" attribute. Thus, with these
two parameters, we can characterize the whole spatial distribution of the host species, and will be able to address
any landscape configuration. This array could be assimilated to a picture that describes the category of habitats
occurring at each pixel.
Dynamical interactions between components
So far we have defined the static part of our model. Now
we need to address the dynamic interactions among all
these attributes. Indeed, each object will interact with all

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:435

the others both in space and time using simple dynamical
functions. To keep our model as simple as possible, we
have modeled only three functions that are scheduled by
a main algorithm and are implemented in the "Host"
class.
Host with landscape: Moving function
There are two options in the moving function. The first
one is a basic type of movement and each individual has
a given "Moving Capacity" that will allow that subject to
move from its initial position to ((MovingCapacity + 1) *
2)2 new locations. At each time step, a new position will
be randomly selected. If it is not within the individual's
habitat (with respect to the "Tolerance value"), the nearest
position into the habitat will be then selected. We begin
with movement with a square, but this function could be
easily modified to take into account different behaviors.

The other option concerns only the vectors. Each vector
individual has a "Biting Rate" which is converted into the
probability of biting at each time step and is equal to 1/
BitingRate when "Biting Rate" is expressed with the time
step used in simulations. When this event is selected, the
number of available reservoir individuals in ((MovingCapacity + 1) * 2)2 possible positions is computed. A reservoir individual is then chosen randomly from a uniform
distribution, and the vector will move to this selected
position and bite the chosen reservoir individual for a
potential transmission between vector and reservoir.
Host with parasite: Infection function
Potential infection is the second function, and it could be
involved at each time step. Each individual, both from
vector and reservoir species, has a "Competence" value,
which represents the probability that an individual
becomes infectious after an infectious contact. Hence, a
random number will be generated according to a uniform
law and, if this number is inferior to the "Competence
Value", the "next Parasite" field receives a "parasite" input.
At each time step, "current Parasite" has a 1/latencyPeriod
probability to receive the "next Parasite" object if this
object is not null. If successful, "next Parasite" will receive
a "null" value. Similarly, at each time step, "past Parasite"
has a 1/infectiousPeriod probability to receive a "current
Parasite" object. Hence, the "next Parasite", "current Parasite" and "past Parasite" fields will determine the infectious status as follows: (i) if the three fields are "null", that
individual is in the "Susceptible" status; (ii) if "next Parasite" is not null and the others are null, that subject is
"Infected", but not infectious (iii) if "current Parasite" is
not null and the others are null, the individual is "Infectious" and can transmit the disease agent, and finally (iv)
when "past Parasite" is not null and the others are null,
the individual is "Recovered" and can not be infected
again.

Host: Birth and death functions
The last important functions concern demography. Each
individual from a same species has an "Offspring Size"
mean which represents the number of new hosts created
at each birth event. To simplify, we assume that each
"Host" object has, on average, only one birth event during
its life. Hence, at each time step, there is a 1/lifeSpan probability that new "Offspring Size" "Host" objects will be
created for each individual. In the same way, individuals
die with a probability equals to 1/lifeSpan at each time
step. To keep our populations constant, as we assumed in
the rest of this paper, we set "Offspring Size" to one. Thus,
on average, each host will produce one new host before its
death. This assumption could be easily relaxed by adding
a specific attribute representing a birth rate, which could
be also a function to cope with dynamical demography.
Main algorithm
Finally, each individual has a main algorithm which
schedules all the previously described different functions.
This algorithm is split in two main functions: "Step" and
"Update". The "Step" function is called first. In this function, the "Move" function will be applied for both vectors
and reservoirs. For vector individuals, a search of available
reservoir hosts will be launched only if the event "Bite" is
selected. Only three fields can be modified during this
function: "future X", "future Y", and "next Parasite". After
"Step" is done for all host individuals, the "Update" function is applied to each individual. The "x" and "y" fields
are filled by "future X" and "future Y" respectively, the
"current Parasite" field by the "future Parasite" value with
a 1/latencyPeriod probability. The "past Parasite" field is
filled by the "current Parasite" value with a 1/infectiousPeriod probability, and birth and death functions are called
with 1/lifeSpan probability.

All functions are detailed in the pseudo-code shown in
Additional file 1, section 2. All objects re filled from relevant case-studies. Data format is explained in Additional
file 1, section 3. The most important point of the data format features remains its capacity to quantify for each habitat a different moving capacity for each vector and
reservoir species, leading to the integration of heterogeneous environments. All parameters used in this model are
summarized in Table 2.

Results and Discussion
Adaptability examples: Outcomes for modifying system
studied
To simplify the identification and modeling of the core
mechanisms of our system, we have chosen a simple epidemiological context with only one vector species and
one (or two) reservoir species in a landscape with some
classes. However the main idea of our model is to be as
general as possible. Hence, we developed the possibility
to integrate real data coming from real epidemiological
situations. In this section, we propose three main (and
simple) additions to our basic model. The first one concerns the integration of maps from the Geographical
Information System (GIS). This integration allows future
studies to integrate real landscapes and to analyze how a
pathogen agent can be transmitted within that landscape.
However, often, landscapes from GIS require very high
resolution that could make impossible the computability
of our model. To overcome this problem, we have integrated the implementation of a parallel behavior that
transforms our model into a client/server software and
allows us to distribute host objects to several computers.
Thus, the computability of our model will only depend on
the number of available computers. Parallelization makes
our model suitable to be used to study disease transmission in really complex environments, and for that reason
we can integrate also the last extension which concerns
evolutionary dynamics. With the help of these three easy
to implement additions, our model becomes a very adaptable tool for the analysis of a wide range of ecological and
epidemiological situations.
Integration of data from a GIS
The way our model has been constructed allows data integration without additional developments. Moreover, as
most of the GIS software integrate an output in raster format, we could fill in our habitats, which represent the "virtual world", with the values contained in the GIS output
file. This output should indicate values, in terms of habitat
classification, for each pixel. Then, as a last step, we would

associate each habitat to each vector and reservoir species
involved in our landscape.
Outcomes for intensive computing: Parallelization
When the number of individuals increases too much or
when the space to be modeled is too detailed, like in the
case of high-resolution maps, computing resources
become quickly the limiting factor. To address this issue,
we present here a parallel version of our model. This is a
first version of parallelization which involves communication between different computers and does not accept a
"resume" of the current simulation. Thus different computers can be easily replaced by other chipsets just by substituting communication via "Socket" (a classical method
in network programming) by communication via internal
memory. The introduction of a "resume" function in a
future version of our model should integrate also a better
management of unexpected events. Similarly, implementing different moving behaviors requires to adapt the parallelization algorithm.

This parallelization is quite simple and is based on a classical multi-thread client/server model. As all operations to
access the "virtual world" are done by different functions
in the "Model Swarm Mother" class, we extended our
model to two new classes which inherited from the first
one (see Figure 2).
In the "Model Swarm Client" class, each client contains a
given number of individuals. These clients have also one
thread to receive requests from the server. There are four
synchronization messages for clients : (i) "GO STEP",
which indicates that the client can launch the "Step" function for each individual ; (ii) "END STEP" which is sent by
the client to alert the server when all its individuals have
completed the "Step" function ; (iii) "GO UPDATE"
which is received by the client to launch the "Update"
function for all its individuals and (iv) "END UPDATE"
which is sent by the client to indicate to the server that a
given time step is completed for that client.

Distributed behavior of our model
Distributed behavior of our model. Each function acting on the virtual world or on scheduling is in the "Model Swarm"
class. These are virtual functions and each behavior is implemented in one of the inheriting classes. "Model Swarm Alone" contains the same functions as the "Model Swarm" class and is applied in a stand-alone use. "Model Swarm Client" and "Model
Swarm Sever" are called in the case of parallelization. On the server side, a thread is created for each client and communication
is done via an established communication protocol (See Additional file 1, section 4). On the client side, each client can focus on
a given number of "Host" objects and a thread is created to communicate with the Server component.

In the "Model Swarm Server" class, upon loading of a GIS
file, each new individual is assigned to the less busy client
(i.e., the client with the lowest number of individuals).
Afterward, a thread is created for communication with
each client using the described synchronization messages.
When clients need to know some characteristics about
one neighboring host or about the habitat value of a given
pixel, the server receives a message indicating which value
is wanted. A communication protocol has been developed
and it is described in Additional file 1, section 4.
This implementation underlines the capacity of an oriented-object program. Indeed, the "Model Swarm Alone"
class is used in the case of a non-parallel model. This class
inherits from the "Model Swarm Mother" class and it is
filled only with "virtual functions" that allow accessing
the virtual world or managing task scheduling. These virtual functions will be developed differently for a stand-

alone execution, a server execution or a client execution.
In this way, we know that the model behavior has not
been modified upon parallelization because it is implemented in the Host class and only functions of scheduling
and space access can be modified in the parallel version.
Integration of evolutionary dynamics
So far, evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions in real landscapes have been poorly studied. However, our model could easily cope with this additional
complexity. To integrate evolutionary insights, we have to
relax the assumption that all disease characteristics are
contained in the "Parasite" class. Therefore, we have to
model the infection process as a by-product between the
host and the parasite. To do that, we have integrated the
theoretical framework proposed by Girvan and collaborators [40] to study pathogen evolution. Accordingly, we
represented the pathogen and host genomes as binary

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:435

strings (0 or 1) with a length n for the pathogen genome
and with a longer string for the host genome. We then
computed the Hamming's distance between the two
strings to measure the adequation between host and pathogen, and hence the probability of infection. If we then
integrate a mutation rate to the pathogen's genome,
applied at each new infection, we can also study the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in space and time.
Finally, if we apply also a mutation rate to the host's
genome at each new birth, we can analyze the co-evolutionary dynamics as well. This last extension shows once
again the adaptability of our model. Just by modifying the
"Infection" function and with a conceptual representation
of the host and parasite genomes, we can analyze a wide
range of evolutionary dynamics in space and time, for and
within different vector and reservoir species in a real landscape.

Conclusion
The model we describe in this paper is one of the simplest
for vector-borne diseases. This simplicity, which leads to a
model comparable to the classical SEIR stochastic model,
allows us to analyze the core mechanisms involved in the
spatial features of vector-borne disease dynamics. The
analysis of these spatial features (Additional file 1, section
2) show that the spatio-temporal dynamics of vector species are a crucial factor for disease understanding. Moreover, to decrease the intensity of disease transmission, a
drastic reduction of vectors' moving capacity has to be
applied to produce a significant effect on disease patterns.
The high flexibility of our model allowed us to easily integrate data coming from GIS, thus moving away from theoretical studies to handle real-life situations. However,
since real situations need often high-resolution GIS, we
have developed a parallel version of our model to cope
with all kinds of epidemiological situations. Finally, to
strengthen our model's adaptability, we integrated a simple way to study evolutionary and co-evolutionary
dynamics.

and the diversity of local habitats could impact on the
moving capacity of vector species, tractability of this
model could become a problem. Moreover, if the disease
studied involves several vector and reservoir species, the
number of equations then becomes a critical issue. This
limitation also exists for the metapopulation and network
models. Hence, the most generic model is probably represented by an individual-based model such as the one we
have developed in the present work.
Our main goal is to provide a generic and highly customizable model for vector-borne diseases. Its structure could
be applied on a wide range of vector-borne disease, but
the different functions and attributes have to be updated
to study specific cases. But our model opens new opportunities for the study of infectious diseases. As mathematical
epidemiology builds on SEIR framework, we hope that
our study has underlined how computational biology
could be also well applied to the study of vector-borne
diseases. Our model, freely accessible on http://
roche.ben.googlepages.com under GPL license, is proposed as a first standard version. This model could, and
should, be improved to increase the interest in the study
of spatio-temporal dynamics of vector-borne diseases in
realistic situations.

Authors' contributions
Of course, our model is not the "magic model" that could
be used to model anything, any time and anywhere. Nevertheless, the dramatic increase of vector-borne diseases
[41], such West Nile fever, Lyme disease, Chickungunya
or others, strongly justifies the generation of this kind of
models for a better understanding of complex-system diseases. These theoretical developments have to be continued to fully appreciate the overall impact of spatial
features on disease dynamics.

BR participated to study conception, carried out the
model programming, carried out the analysis of the
model and drafted the manuscript. JFG participated to
study conception and improved the manuscript. FB participated to study conception, model analysis and improved
the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

Other spatial modeling methods could be applied as well.
The most used model in vector-borne diseases is the reaction-diffusion framework that is really attractive for simple cases. However, when landscape is highly fragmented
