Abstract
Background: The genus Lactobacillus is characterized by an extraordinary degree of phenotypic and genotypic
diversity, which recent genomic analyses have further highlighted. However, the choice of species for sequencing
has been non-random and unequal in distribution, with only a single representative genome from the L. salivarius
clade available to date. Furthermore, there is no data to facilitate a functional genomic analysis of motility in the
lactobacilli, a trait that is restricted to the L. salivarius clade.
Results: The 2.06 Mb genome of the bovine isolate Lactobacillus ruminis ATCC 27782 comprises a single circular
chromosome, and has a G+C content of 44.4%. In silico analysis identified 1901 coding sequences, including genes
for a pediocin-like bacteriocin, a single large exopolysaccharide-related cluster, two sortase enzymes, two CRISPR
loci and numerous IS elements and pseudogenes. A cluster of genes related to a putative pilin was identified, and
shown to be transcribed in vitro. A high quality draft assembly of the genome of a second L. ruminis strain, ATCC
25644 isolated from humans, suggested a slightly larger genome of 2.138 Mb, that exhibited a high degree of
synteny with the ATCC 27782 genome. In contrast, comparative analysis of L. ruminis and L. salivarius identified a
lack of long-range synteny between these closely related species. Comparison of the L. salivarius clade core
proteins with those of nine other Lactobacillus species distributed across 4 major phylogenetic groups identified
the set of shared proteins, and proteins unique to each group.
Conclusions: The genome of L. ruminis provides a comparative tool for directing functional analyses of other
members of the L. salivarius clade, and it increases understanding of the divergence of this distinct Lactobacillus
lineage from other commensal lactobacilli. The genome sequence provides a definitive resource to facilitate
investigation of the genetics, biochemistry and host interactions of these motile intestinal lactobacilli.

Background
The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are low G+C, Gram-positive bacteria that produce lactic acid through the fermentation of hexose sugars [1]. The LAB are not a
monophyletic group, but rather a pragmatic phenotypic
division encompassing 13 genera. The largest of these is
the genus Lactobacillus, with over 171 currently recognized species [2]. The lactobacilli are considered a

subdominant element in the human gastrointestinal
tract (GIT) and have been extensively studied for both
their industrial application and health benefits [3]. The
genus Lactobacillus is highly diverse [4]. On the basis of
phylogenetic markers such as the 16S rRNA [5] or the
groEL gene [6], clades or clusters of species have been
defined within the genus Lactobacillus. In the most
recent comprehensive description of this genus, twelve
Lactobacillus and two Pediococcus clades were proposed
[5]. The process of assigning species to clades within a
larger genus is not novel, and cladistics has formed an

integral part of many Lactobacillus phylogenetic analyses [4,5,7-10]. As more species are identified, a clearer
resolution of the clades emerges. For example, the L.
plantarum group originally included twelve species [8],
but has since undergone significant reclassification, and
now contains only three species, namely L. plantarum,
L. paraplantarum and L. pentosus[5]. Furthermore, the
L. buchneri group that was a major clade in early Lactobacillus phylogenies [8] has since been revised, and
robust divisions within the group are evident [5]
The L. acidophilus group [4], formerly known as the
L. delbrueckii group [11], is one of the largest Lactobacillus clades. It harbours the “L. acidophilus complex”, a
cluster of several species including L. acidophilus, L.
amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. gallinarum, L. gasseri, L. helveticus and L. johnsonii[12-14] that were mistakenly
identified as L. acidophilus strains upon their original
isolation [13,15]. Members of this clade have been isolated from humans and environmental sources, and
represent some of the best characterised lactobacilli.
Similarly, the L. salivarius and L. reuteri clades were
named after the best characterised of their member species and may be considered as major phylogenetic units
within the genus Lactobacillus. The L. reuteri clade
includes member species that were isolated either from
humans (L. antri; L. coleohominis; L. gastricus; L. oris; L.
vaginalis), animals (L. reuteri) or birds (L. ingluviei) or
from foods such as rye-bran fermentations (L. frumenti)
and sourdough (L. panis; L. pontis and L. secaliphilus)
[2]. Likewise, the species comprising the L. salivarius
clade have been isolated from vertebrate intestine/faeces,
soil, water and plants or food [16]. This clade includes
L. ruminis which is phylogenetically close to L. salivarius[11] and which shares the same ecological niche
[17-19].
Application of genomic technologies has been very
beneficial for understanding the biology of commensal
lactobacilli [20]. The full genomes of 14 Lactobacillus
species have been sequenced and published [18,21-31]
and 140 Lactobacillus sequencing projects are on-going
[32]. There is a bias towards the analysis of species that
are phylogenetically close to L. acidophilus: of the 14
Lactobacillus genomes currently available, 6 are from
the L. acidophilus complex. Until recently, only one genome from a member of the L. salivarius clade had been
fully sequenced [30]. Additionally, while the development of next generation sequencing technologies has
led to a near exponential increase in the number of
sequenced bacterial genomes, the majority of these genomes remain at low quality level, have been assembled
and scaffolded without human intervention, contain
numerous sequence gaps and are poorly annotated. As a
consequence these draft genome sequences are often
unsuitable for whole genome comparative analysis,

particularly where the emphasis is on synteny, operon
structure, or plasmid configuration.
Lactobacillus ruminis was first isolated from the faeces
of humans in 1960 [33] and subsequently from the
bovine rumen [17]. L. ruminis has been identified as one
of 17 species of lactobacilli which are routinely isolated
from the faeces of humans [19], cattle [34] and pigs [35]
and is considered to be a member of the autochthonous
microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [18,19]. L.
ruminis is unusual among the lactobacilli as it is one of
only 14 members of this genus to be characterised as
being motile [36]. As well as being motile, L. ruminis is
of interest because the immunomodulatory characteristics of this species, specifically its ability to stimulate
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and nuclear-factor B
(NF- B) production in monocytes [37], has identified L.
ruminis as a candidate probiotic. In this study, we determined the genome sequence of Lactobacillus ruminis
ATCC 27782 (a motile strain isolated from cows), representing the first genome sequence of a motile Lactobacillus and the second completely finished [38] genome
from a member of the L. salivarius clade.

Results and discussion
General genome features

The genome of Lactobacillus ruminis ATCC 27782 consists of a singular circular chromosome of 2,066,657 bp
with an average G+C content of 44.4% (Table 1). Bioinformatic analysis of the genome identified 1901 coding
regions, representing a coding density of 80.5%, and
with an average gene length of 875 bp. Biological functions could be assigned to 1417 (72.2%) of the predicted
proteins. The remaining 473 (23.9%) were found to be
homologous to conserved hypothetical proteins in other
species or had no match to any known protein. The GC
% map of the genome of L. ruminis ATCC 27782 (Figure 1) identifies several regions with significantly deviating GC content. The first and largest of these regions
(100,290 to 166,099 bp) corresponds to an exopolysaccharide biosynthesis locus (see below). The second
region (563,932 to 574,637 bp) is flanked by integrases
and contains a number of hypothetical proteins. Also
located in this region are a recombinase and a DNA
cytosine-5-methyltransferase, both of which are classified as pseudogenes due to frameshifts. The third region
(1,068,439 to 1,077,247 bp) corresponds to the cas genes
of CRISPR region 2 (see below).
In addition to the 1901 protein-coding regions, the
genome of L. ruminis contains 85 predicted pseudogenes (4.3% of all coding sequences; Figure 1), characterized by the presence of in-sequence frame-shifts,
deletions, stop codons, or interruption by insertion
sequences (IS). A large proportion (29.4%), of the pseudogenes themselves were identified as being IS element

related. Inactivation of IS elements in this manner is a
common feature of bacterial genomes, and is considered
a mechanism for transposition regulation [39]. The
remaining 60 pseudogenes are catalogued in Additional
File 1: Table 1. IS elements are a common feature of
bacterial genomes. We identified eighty-three transposases (4.2% of coding sequences) representing 9 families
of IS elements in the genome of L. ruminis ATCC
27782, with 25 characterized as pseudogenes (Additional
File 2: Table 2). Seven of the nine families are present in
multiple copies, with IS256, IS66, IS3, IS200/IS605 having the largest numbers of replicates, 10, 16, 19, and 25
copies respectively.
Six rRNA operons, consisting of 16S, 23S and 5S
rRNA genes, were identified distributed throughout the
genome. All rRNA operons were orientated in the same
direction as DNA replication. Sixty seven tRNA genes,
representing all 20 amino acids, were identified in the
genome. Only 26 of the 67 tRNAs were located on the
lagging strand, with the majority clustered at, or close
to, the first of the two rRNA operons on this strand.
The remaining 41 were distributed throughout the leading strand with the majority clustered around the four
rRNA operons. Redundant tRNA genes were present for
18 of the 20 tRNA species, with the exceptions being
those for cysteine and tryptophan.
In addition to the complete genome of L. ruminis
ATCC 27782, we also generated a high draft-quality

Page 4 of 15

assembly [38] of the L. ruminis ATCC 25644 genome,
as described in Methods. Although not assembled, projection against the ATCC 27782 genome suggests that
the genome of ATCC 25644 consists of a slightly larger
circular chromosome of 2,138,893 bp, with an average G
+C content of 43.98%. A preliminary annotation of this
draft genome identified 2,251 coding regions representing a coding density of 87%. This may be an over-estimate due to the draft quality of the genome [40].
Comparative analysis of the two L. ruminis genomes
(Figure 2) revealed a high degree of synteny, but this is
disrupted by a large chromosomal inversion centered
around the replication terminus region.
L. ruminis is one of 12 species in the L. salivarius
clade which have been identified as being motile (only
14 species of the genus Lactobacillus are known to be
motile). Annotation of the L. ruminis ATCC 27782 genome identified all the motility and motility-associated
proteins required to produce a fully functional flagellar
apparatus. The genomics of L. ruminis motility and flagellar assembly are described in detail elsewhere [36].
To summarize, the motility-encoding regions of the
ATCC25644 and ATCC27782 genomes span 45,687 bp
and 48,062 bp respectively, constituting a single contiguous gene block. L. ruminis motility is conferred by a
total of forty-five predicted proteins involved in flagellum regulation, synthesis, export and chemotaxis, and
which conform to the expectations for flagellum

production in Gram positive bacteria [41]. The motility
locus of ATCC 27782 is larger because it includes a second copy of the gene for flagellin, fliC, and a glycosyltransferase pseudogene, the relevance of which for
motility is unclear. The closest homolog of most of the
L. ruminis motility genes was in Enterococcus casseliflavus or Enterococcus gallinarum, which is consistent with
phylogenetic relatedness of the enterococci to the lactobacilli [42], and distribution of the motility phenotype in
the phylum Firmicutes.
Genomics of L. ruminis metabolism

The in silico analysis of the L. ruminis genome suggests
that it is unable to synthesize the vitamins and cofactors
riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, nicotinamide and nicotinate. Partial pathways for both purine and pyrimidine
biosynthesis were annotated (Additional File 3: Figure 1
and Additional File 4: Figure 2, respectively). However,
while L. ruminis appears to lack the ability to synthesise
adenosine and guanosine, it is predicted to synthesize
the nucleotides adenine and guanine from adenosine
monophospate (AMP) and guanine monophosphate
(GMP) respectively.
In contrast to other Lactobacillus species such as L.
helveticus and L. sakei, which convert pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA through the intermediate acetyl phosphate,
L. ruminis cannot produce acetyl-CoA in this manner.
Instead L. ruminis appears to produce Acetyl-CoA
through the action of the enzyme pyruvate formatelyase (Additional File 5: Figure 3). Pyruvate formatelyase catalyses the non-oxidative cleavage of pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA and formate. An anaerobically induced pyruvate formate-lyase system has been fully characterised in
E. coli[43].
Through de-novo synthesis and inter-conversions, L.
ruminis can synthesize 8 of the 20 amino acids. Present
in the genome is a gene predicted to encode the enzyme
L-serine dehydratase (EC. 4.3.1.17) which catalyses the
conversion of pyruvate into serine. Serine in turn can be
converted by tryptophan synthase into tryptophan
(Additional File 6: Figure 4). Tryptophan can also be
synthesised de novo through the Shikimate pathway. L.
ruminis is also predicted to be capable of de novo synthesis of histidine. While the L. ruminis ATCC 27782 genome apparently encodes complete pathways for the
production of threonine and aspartate, it lacks the
enzymes threonine aldolase (EC: 4.1.2.5) and glycine
hydromethyltransferase (EC: 2.1.2.1). Consequently this
strain cannot synthesis glycine. L. ruminis is also predicted to lack the ability to synthesize glutamate. However, if extracellular glutamate is imported (two
glutamate ABC transport systems are present in the
genome of L. ruminis, LRC_13790-13800 and
LRC_18670-18680), L. ruminis could subsequently

Page 5 of 15

synthesize glutamine, arginine and proline. In summary,
L. ruminis is potentially capable of synthesizing 8 amino
acids and being auxotrophic for 12. This level of auxotrophy is greater than that exhibited by its nearest
sequenced neighbour Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118
[30] which is auxotrophic for only 8 amino acids. This
highlights the dependence this autochthonous bacterium
has on extracellular sources of amino acids that are
likely to be present in the intestinal milieu. However, L.
ruminis is considerably less auxotrophic than more distantly related Lactobacillus species such as L. acidophilus NCFM (auxotrophic for 14 amino acids) [44]and L.
sakei (auxotrophic for 18 amino acids).
Apart from carbohydrate metabolism (see below), preliminary analysis of the genome of L. ruminis ATCC
25644 revealed a near identical predicted metabolic profile to that described for L. ruminis ATCC 27782. However, some subtle differences were noted; for example
ATCC 25644 appears to lack the enzyme asparatate
aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.1) but possesses the enzymes
3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.85), succinyldiaminopimelate desuccinylase (EC:3.5.1.18) and arylalcohol dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.90). The two L. ruminis
strains are predicted to be auxotrophic for the same 12
amino acids and to have identical pyruvate metabolism
systems. Similar to ATCC 27782 and most other lactobacilli, L. ruminis ATCC 25644 cannot synthesize the
majority of vitamins and co-factors.
The ability of intestinal bacteria to utilize carbohydrates is an important factor for determining competitiveness and diet interaction in the host intestine, and
we describe this topic in detail elsewhere in this volume
[40]. Sixteen carbohydrate utilization pathways were
predicted in genomes of ATCC 27782 and ATCC
25644, including those for utilization of glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, starch and sucrose [40]. The
ATCC 25644 encodes six putative operons for the transport and utilisation of the prebiotics fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), soya-bean
oligosaccharides (SOS), and 1,3:1,4-b-D-Gluco-oligosaccharides [40]. Only three of these operons were identified in the ATCC 27782 genome, which were putatively
linked to the utilisation of SOS and 1,3:1,4-b-D-Glucooligosaccharides. Lack of an operon for FOS utilization
in the bovine isolate ATCC 27782 is consistent with the
inability of this strain to use FOS as a sole carbon
source. A predicted cellobiose utilization operon in the
L. ruminis 25644 genome is likely to be responsible for
the transport and hydrolysis of both cellobiose and
1,3:1,4-b-D-Glucan hydrolysates [40].
Environment-interaction traits

Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced
by many lactic acid bacteria, that may exhibit either a

Forde et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S13

narrow spectrum (affecting only closely related species)
or broad spectrum (affecting species in different genera)
[45]. The genome of L. ruminis ATCC 27782 includes a
6.1 kb region encoding seven bacteriocin-related and
two hypothetical genes (Additional File 7: Figure 5). In
silico analysis identified the bacteriocin (59 aa protein;
LRC_02417) as a Class II pediocin-like bacteriocin [46].
The bacteriocin shows significant residue identity to
Class II bacteriocins from Bacillus coagulans, Pedicococcus acidilacti, L. plantarum, and other LAB (Additional
File 8: Figure 6), and possesses a conserved N terminal
pediocin box region and the YGNGVXCXXXXCXV
motif [47]. In addition to the bacteriocin structural
gene, the locus also encodes two putative bacteriocin
immunity proteins (LRC_17030 and LRC_17110), a sensor histidine kinase and response regulator (LRC_1706017070) and transport apparatus comprising an accessory
protein and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
(LRC_17040 and LRC_17080). A preliminary analysis
has so far failed to show bacteriocin activity associated
with L. ruminis strain ATCC 27782, and it is not yet
known if this locus is active. Analysis of the genome of
ATCC 25644 also identified a region containing genes
associated with bacteriocin production. However, the
fragmented assembly means that it is presently unknown
if the genetic complement of this locus is complete.
Sequences associated with bacteriocin production were
distributed across three contigs, with the genes for two
sensor histidine kinases and a response regulator being
truncated by sequencing gaps. Although a gene for a
potential bacteriocin immunity protein (similar to PedB
from Lactobacillus gasseri) was identified, no genes
encoding bacteriocin peptides or transport apparatus
were identified.
CRISPR loci (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats) are a family of DNA repeats that
function like an adaptive immune response system, and
are found in only 40% of bacteria. This system provides
acquired immunity to exogenous DNA from viruses and
plasmids [48], and thus represent a barrier to attack or
genetic transformation. Two CRISPR/CRISPR-associated
sequence (cas) systems were identified in the genome of
L. ruminis ATCC 27782. The systems, CRISPR1 and
CRISPR2, are located 12.9kb apart and consist of 8 and
7 cas genes respectively. CRISPR1 consists of 8 cas
genes and is preceded by a 1059 bp CRISPR region
composed of a 36bp direct repeat and 14 spacers. The
CRISPR region is separated from the cas genes by a
small hypothetical protein and a transposase fragment.
CRIPSR2 consists of 7 cas genes and is proceeded by a
much longer CRISPR region composed of a 30 bp direct
repeat and 36 spacers. Analysis of both CRISPR regions
revealed no significant hits to any known plasmid or
phage sequences, emphasizing the phylogenetic distance

Page 6 of 15

of the L. ruminis genetic milieu from previously well
characterized systems.
We identified one CRISPR system in the draft genome
of L. ruminis ATCC 25644. CRISPR1 consists of 4 cas
genes proceeded by a CRISPR region containing a 36 bp
direct repeat (DR) and 16 spacers. The region is disrupted by a sequencing gap of 887 bp (inferred from
mate-pair information) dividing the region into direct
repeats with 11 and 5 spacers respectively. Given that
each DR and spacer is 65 bp, the sequencing gap could
contain another 13 spacers. The presence of a CRISPR
system in a second L. ruminis genome confirms the
importance of resistance to exogenous DNA in this
species.
Intestinal commensal bacteria must also be able to
endure a range of physiological stresses. Indeed, the
ability of bacteria to respond to stresses such as those
encountered during gastric and intestinal transit is key
to their survival. The L. ruminis ATCC 27782 genome
encodes a number of stress resistance proteins including
those predicted to confer resistance to heat, cold, alkaline and phage shock proteins (Additional File 9: Table
3). The genome also includes the conserved SOS regulon genes. Specifically, L. ruminis ATCC 27782 encodes
four heat shock proteins, the cold shock proteins CspA
and CspE, a single alkaline shock protein, and there are
two copies of pspC whose product is predicted to be
involved in phage shock/resistance. The genome of L.
ruminis ATCC 27782 also harbours genes for a number
of Clp proteases, (clpB, clpX, and clpP), which are
involved in the degradation of mis-folded proteins [49]
ATCC 27782 is moderately oxygen tolerant, though
less so than other members of the L. salivarius clade
[40]. Consequently, the ability of this bacterium to
respond to and eliminate reactive oxygen species is
extremely important. The L. ruminis genome encodes a
number of thioredoxins, a class of protein which act as
antioxidants through the reduction of other proteins by
cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange [50].
Surface proteins and carbohydrates

The Lactobacillus cell surface has an important role in
governing interaction with host animals, at the level of
initial colonization, long-term persistence, and potentially also modulatory roles on both the innate and
adaptive immune responses, and the rest of the microbiota by surface exclusion [51]. Sortase enzymes function as an important mechanism which anchors surface
proteins, and they are found in all Gram-positive bacteria where they act as both proteases and transpeptidases [52]. The Sortase type A enzymes (SrtA) function
by anchoring proteins containing the characteristic substrate LPxTG motif to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall.
Genes for two sortase-like proteins were annotated in

Forde et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S13

the L. ruminis genome (SrtA, LRC_16570 and SrtC,
LRC_00630), as well as 10 predicted sortase-anchored
proteins (Additional File 10: Table 4), that were identified by searching for LPxTG motifs. The presence of
multiple sortase-like proteins in the genome is not unusual in Gram-positive bacteria [53], and the NCBI protein databases currently contain 173 SrtA sequences
from eight Lactobacillus species, plus an additional 48
SrtC sequences. The sortase-like protein encoded by
LRC_00630 contains a SrtC Conserved Domain. It
shows 42% BLAST identity to SrtC of L. rhamnosus
LGG. The LRC_00630 gene is preceded by three genes
predicted to encode sortase dependant proteins
(LRC_00600, LRC_00610 and LRC_00620). This genetic
arrangement suggest that both the genes for the sortase
enzyme and its substrates may have been acquired as a
unit by horizontal gene transfer, and their arrangement
also suggests they may be co-transcribed or co-regulated. Both SrtA and SrtC recognize similar motifs, but
the conservation of amino acids in these motifs differs i.
e. LPxTGc for SrtA and lPxTGG for SrtC, where uppercase letters are absolutely conserved [52]. On this basis
alone, the target proteins for the SrtA and SrtC enzymes
of L. ruminis ATCC 27782 cannot be distinguished, and
will require experimental investigation.
LRC_00600 (annotated as Sortase-anchored surface
protein) is a predicted 1,140 residue protein with
homology to hypothetical proteins or presumptive (but
unproven) collagen adhesins. LRC_00610 (annotated as
Sortase-anchored surface protein) shows 28% BLAST
identity to SpaE, a minor backbone protein of the adhesive pili produced by L. rhamnosus LGG [54]. However,
it also displays higher levels of residue identity to many
putative/hypothetical sortase-dependant proteins from
LAB or Firmicutes. LRC_00620 (505 amino acid residues) shows significant residue identity to homologues
primarily in the Enterococcus spp,. including pilin subunits from E. faecalis and E. faecium. It is therefore possible that this locus encodes a sortase-dependent pilus
organelle. Genetic evidence for possible production of
such structures has been noted in L. johnsonii[55] and
other lactobacilli [51], but their visualization and characterization has only been described for L. rhamnosus
LGG (as noted above). When transcription of the
LRC_00600-00630 locus in ATCC 27782 and ATCC
25644 was examined by microarray analysis, we
observed that these genes were significantly up-regulated
in the human isolate ATCC 25644 compared to the
bovine isolate ATCC 27782, by factors of 15.2, 14.3, 7.1
and 23.8 respectively. While highly suggestive of a surface role in this strain, these presumptive pili are not
visible under the conditions routinely used for negative
staining (see below), and direct experimental verification
by another method is now required.

There is no clustering of genes for sortase dependant
proteins around the gene for the second sortase-like
enzyme (LRC_16570) which we annotated as SrtA. The
genes for the remaining sortase-dependant proteins are
distributed throughout the genome, with another threegene cluster in (LRC_16760, LRC_16780, LRC_16790) in
the latter half of the genome. The biological function of
these proteins is not known (Additional File 10), and
their characterization will require a functional genomics
approach as deployed for the closely related L salivarius
[56], and L. acidophilus[57].
In contrast to the L. salivarius genome which harbours two major gene clusters for exopolysaccharide
(EPS) production [30,58], the genome of L. ruminis
ATCC 27782 contains only one EPS cluster, similar to
the genomes of L. acidophilus[44], L. johnsonii[21] and
L. rhamnosus[59]. The L. ruminis ATCC 27782 EPS
gene cluster spans 69,912 bp (3.4% of total genome),
and incorporates 62 predicted coding sequences (Additional File 11: Figure 7). The cluster contains genes for a
single predicted chain length determinator, an oligosaccharide translocase, a flippase, 9 glycosyltransferases,
and a priming glucose phosphotransferase (LRC_01410;
Additional File 11: Figure 7). The EPS cluster also contains 16 hypothetical proteins, 6 of which are hypothetical membrane proteins, and four IS element-related
proteins (transposases). The L. ruminis EPS gene clusters exhibits an atypical G+C content relative to the rest
of the genome; the G+C content of the EPS locus is
39.66%, compared to 44.4% for the genome. It is also
interesting to note that many of the genes in the EPS
cluster do not have their closest homologue amongst
the Lactobacilli, but instead have their closest homologues in other genera such as Ruminococcus, Eubacteria
and Butyrovibrio (see Additional File 12: Table 5). This
suggests that acquisition of the L. ruminis EPS-encoding
region was by horizontal gene transfer in the intestinal
environment, and it is tempting to theorise that some
particular selective pressure was required to promote
acquisition from outside the genus. Analysis of cells of
L. ruminis by transmission electron microscopy did not
clearly identify the presence of an EPS layer (Figure 3).
However, it is known that EPS production in lactobacilli
including the closely related L. salivarius species is heavily dependent on culture factors especially carbohydrate
in the medium [58], variations of which were not tested
in this preliminary analysis.
In addition to sortase anchored proteins the L. ruminis
ATCC 27782 genome also encodes a predicted fibronectin binding protein (LRC_09530) and a number of proteins expected to be involved in the export and
synthesis of teichoic acids (LRC_01020, LRC_01380,
LRC_03490, LRC_17520, LRC_06890, LRC_06900).
Additionally, the ATCC27782 genome includes the dlt

operon (dltA to dltD; LRC_17120 to LRC_17150)
involved in the esterification of lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
by D-alanine, which suggests the presence of lipoteichoic acids in the L. ruminis cell wall.
Comparative genomics of L. ruminis

Since this study provided the first complete genome
sequence information for a member of the L. salivarius
clade other than L. salivarius itself, we initially compared the L. ruminis ATCC 27782 genome to that of L.
salivarius UCC118. L. ruminis is robustly positioned in
the L. salivarius clade by independent analyses [5,42].
At summary statistic level (Table 1), the genomes of L.

Page 8 of 15

ruminis and L. salivarius are very similar, reflecting the
close phylogenetic relationship of these two species.
However, one major difference is the abundance of
extra-chromosomal elements in L. salivarius. While L.
ruminis has a single circular genome of 2.06 Mb, the L.
salivarius UCC118 genome comprises a 1.8 Mb chromosome and possesses 3 plasmids, one of which is
242kb in size [30]. Multiple plasmids including megaplasmids are present in all L. salivarius strains tested to
date [60]. Notwithstanding this difference in architecture, the genomes of L. ruminis and L. salivarius share a
similar number of coding sequences, rRNA operons and
tRNA genes (Table 1). Notably, the L. ruminis ATCC
27782 genome harbours a larger number of pseudogenes
(85 compared to 69) and more IS elements (83 compared to 43). The greater number of pseudogenes and
smaller genome size may indicate that the L. ruminis
genome is at a more advanced stage of decay than L.
salivarius, relative to their last common ancestor which
was presumably free-living and had a larger genome.
In contrast to their similarity at a general category
level, there is an absence of synteny between the genomes of L. ruminis and L. salivarius (Figure 4). In the
Promer comparison, the genome backbone is just apparent as a diagonal of in-register orthology. The X-shaped
pattern characteristic of recombination around the replication origin-terminus axis, that we previously described
in phylogenetically more distant Lactobacillus comparisons [42], is also evident. In the ACT comparison, it is
clear that large-scale re-arrangement and inversion has
almost eliminated the vestiges of synteny, recalling that

Forde et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S13

these two genomes are nonetheless derived from members of one of the more cohesive Lactobacillus clades.
Thus, the extreme diversity of the genus Lactobacillus is
manifest in the large number of member species and
establishment of multiple divisions [6,9], and is replicated even within the phylogenetic clades, where the
most closely related species demonstrate an unusually
high level of diversity. When we compared the L. ruminis genome to four other species (Figure 5), there was
also a lack of long-range synteny, even less than that the
little observed between L. salivarius and L. ruminis.

Page 9 of 15

To further examine this phenomenon, we investigated
core proteins which we determined using METAPHORE
[61] (see Methods), first within the L. salivarius clade (L.
salivarius and L. ruminis genomes). A protein was considered an ortholog if it shared 30% amino acid identity
over 80% of the sequence length. Only 59% of the protein coding regions (ie excluding IS elements and pseudogenes) in the L. ruminis genome have an ortholog in
the L. salivarius UCC 118 genome. Including the L. salivarius megaplasmid in the analysis, the genomes of L.
ruminis and L. salivarius contained 309 and 358 genes,

respectively, which were absent in the other genome at
the cut-off value for orthology imposed for their proteins (Additional File 13: Table 6 for L. ruminis–specific
proteins, and Additional File 14: Table 7 for L. salivarius-specific proteins). However, a large proportion of
these unique proteins in each genome corresponded to
hypothetical genes (97 in L. ruminis and 115 in L. salivarius). A further 58 unique L. salivarius proteins were
associated with prophages compared to only 11 in the L.
ruminis genome. The L. ruminis SrtC homolog
(LRC_00630) and two of its sortase dependant proteins
(LRC_00600, LRC_00610) are absent from the L. salivarius genome, as are 9 of the CRISPR associated proteins. The presence of only 1 small CRISPR region in
the genome of L. salivarius may account for the greater
abundance of phage associated genes within its genome.
The L. ruminis-specific proteins include those for motility [36], ability to utilize certain carbohydrates such as
cellobiose [40], and a large number of predicted membrane proteins of unknown function (Additional File 13:
Table 6). The previously discussed pediocin-like bacteriocin was also identified by this analysis. The complement of L. salivarius-specific proteins is striking for how
many of them are encoded by discrete tracts of the genome, even outside of phage-related sequences, exemplified by LSL_0330 to LSL_0365 and LSL_0410 to
LSL_0476 (many predicted membrane proteins);
LSL_0921 to LSL_0963 (a cluster of hypothetical proteins); and the two EPS clusters [58]. Some of these
regions are also evident from the ACT comparison (Figure 4), as discrete regions where homology is lacking
between the genomes. This suggests that regions were
differentially retained from the last common ancestor of
the L. salivarius clade – or differentially acquired. The
average GC% of unique genes for the genomes of L.
ruminis ATCC 27782 and L. salivarius UCC118 was
42.7% and 31.9% respectively. However the GC% ranges
were from 26.2% to 57.3% for L. ruminis and from
21.5% to 45% for L. salivarius, indicating that a number
of genes unique to each genome may have been
acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

Due to the lack of any other sequenced species from
this subgroup, the 1,100 proteins conserved in both genomes were considered the core proteins of the L. salivarius clade. The majority of the core proteins have a
defined function with only 166 hypothetical proteins
(35% of the total number of hypothetical proteins) and
189 hypothetical proteins (32 % of the total number of
hypothetical proteins) in L. ruminis and L. salivarius
respectively. More comprehensive manual comparative
analysis (data not shown) revealed that the core protein
set of the L. salivarius clade was predominated by genes
present in operon-like clusters, an organization which
has previously been noted in another study of core
genes in the Lactobacilli [62], suggesting conserved
function, organization and control of such core genes.
In addition to housekeeping genes and clusters of ribosomal and ATPase proteins, L. ruminis and L. salivarius
share a clusters of genes involved in EPS production
and purine metabolism. Five two-component regulatory
systems were shared between both genomes and while
their function is currently unknown, they may form the
basis of environmental response systems shared by
members of this clade.
To determine relatedness levels with a broader sampling of the genus, we compared the core proteins of
the L. salivarius clade with those in five other groups of
lactobacilli. These were based upon representative sampling of major groups defined in our previous phylogenetic analyses [42] as follows: Group A, L. acidophilus
and L. johnsonii; Group B, L. reuteri and L. fermentum;
Group C, L. brevis and L. buchneri; Group D, L. plantarum only (L. plantarum is the only sequenced member of this group); and Group X (not defined as a
specific group in Canchaya et al, 2006), L. casei and L.
sakei. We first defined the core proteins in each group
using METAPHORE ([61]; see Methods). Table 2 shows
that the number of orthologous proteins for each species-pair in a Group was reasonably constant, ignoring
Group D. The number of core proteins shared by a particular group and the L. salivarius clade core protein set
was proportional to the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic

distance. This is as would be expected from our previous usage of this number for phylogenomic comparison [42]. The number of unique proteins in each Group
(relative to the L. salivarius clade core protein set) was
less closely correlated with phylogenetic distance from
L. salivarius–L. ruminis.
We also identified 517 proteins that were common to
all six Lactobacillus groups (Additional File 15; Table 8),
where the sixth group, Group E, is the L. salivarius
clade, for consistency with Canchaya et al, 2006 [42]). In
addition to the expected housekeeping proteins, ribosomal proteins and ATPase proteins, the 6 groups share
three two-component regulatory systems which may
form the basis of environmental response systems
shared by all analyzed members of the genus (Additional
File 15; Table 8). Additionally, 41 hypothetical proteins,
including 4 hypothetical membrane proteins, appear to
be conserved across the six groups. Table 3 shows the
numbers of unique proteins that were present in a given
lactobacillus group but absent in the combined lactobacillus core protein set from all the other groups – in
other words, group-unique core proteins. Group D contained the largest number of unique proteins, reflecting
the larger genome of L. plantarum (Table 3). No group
appears to possess any unique proteins associated with
niche adaption or environment-interaction (see Additional File 16; Table 9 for protein identities by group).
[63][61]

Conclusions
The genome sequences of these two L. ruminis strains
provide a platform for functional genomic analysis of
this species, an overlooked autochthonous member of
the intestinal microbiota of many animals including
humans. Similar to other commensal lactobacilli, the in
silico analysis of the L. ruminis genome suggested it
may be undergoing genome decay. The comparative
analysis of L. ruminis ATCC 27782 and L. salivarius
UCC118 revealed a lack of genome synteny between
these two members of the L. salivarius clade which
reflects the high degree of diversity evident across the
whole genus. Adaptations to a competitive environment
in the intestine include a large locus devoted to EPS
production by L. ruminis, a pediocin-like bacteriocin

Methods
Genome sequencing and annotation
The genomes of both L. ruminis ATCC 25644 and L.
ruminis ATCC 27782 were sequenced by generating
approximately 200,000 reads of average read length 125150 nt, from a half plate on a 454 FLX instrument [64],
using a 3 kb mate pair library, generating approximately
21-fold and 28-fold coverage (Agincourt Biosciences,
Beverly, MA), respectively. In addition to the 454 data
for the ATCC 27782 genome, an additional half lane of
Illumina sequencing (22.5 Mb total sequence data) was
obtained. The Illumina data consisted of a 3 kb matepair library and a 400 bp paired-end library (Fasteris,
Geneva, Switzerland). Each Illumina library provided an
average of 217-fold coverage. Initial de novo genome
assembly of the 454 sequences was performed using the
Roche/454 Life Sciences Newbler (Gs) assembler [65],
producing an initial assembly of 72 contigs distributed
over 8 scaffolds for the genome of ATCC 27782. The
resulting 454 assembly was then used as a reference for
the mapping assembly of the Illumina data. This mapping assembly was performed using Mira [66]and undertaken to extend contigs, close gaps and for error
correction of the draft genome.
A PCR-based strategy was adopted for gap closure.
Contig-contig gaps were closed using primers designed
at the end of contigs and amplified using Dreamtaq
DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada). Scaffolds were ordered and oriented by PCR. Primers were
designed at the ends of the scaffolds and the inter-scaffold region was amplified using Extensor long PCR
enzyme mix (Abgene, Epsom, UK). PCR products for
both the sequencing gaps and the inter-scaffold gaps
were sequenced by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg,
Germany) and the sequences were intergrated into the
assembly using PHRAP [67]. Correct placement of the
gap sequences was confirmed by observation using
Tablet, a next generation sequencing graphical viewer
[68].
Initial automated gene calling was performed using
Glimmer 3 [69] and Genemark [70]. Intergenic regions
were examined for missed gene calls using BlastXtract
[71]. tRNAs were identified using tRNA-scan [72] and
ribosomal binding sites using RBSfinder [73]. Preceding
the manual annotation of the L. ruminis ATCC 27782
genome, the protein sequences of each gene product
were searched against a variety of databases with the
aim of assigning a functional annotation. All predicted
proteins were searched (BLASTP) against the NCBI-

Forde et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S13

non-redundant protein database (nr) and, through Interproscan [74], against the pFAM, TigrFAM, PIR,
HAMAP, PROSITE, PRINTS, PRODOM, PANTHER,
SUPERFAMILY, GENE3D databases. In addition, transmembrane domains were identified with TMHMM [75]
and Signal peptides with SignalP [76]. The automated
annotation was then manually curated in Artemis [77].
Accession numbers: The finished genome of ATCC
27782 is available under accession number XXYYZZ123.
The draft genome of ATCC 25644 is available under
accession number CCGGHHIIUU.
Genome comparisons

Whole genome nucleotide alignments were generated
using the Big Blast software (available from the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute [78] and alignments were
visualized with the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)
[79]. Protein alignments were performed using the
MUMmer package [80]. Identification of orthologs,
unique genes and core genes was performed using the
custom in-house software METAPHORE [61]. METAPHORE performs a bi-directional blastp comparison of
two or more genomes and proteins are only considered
orthologs if they share a minimium 30% amino acid
identity over 80% of their sequence length. For an
ortholog to be considered a core gene, it must be present in all possible pairwise genome combinations.
Transcriptome analysis

Microarray production, scanning and data analysis followed an established protocol [79]. In summary, L.
ruminis cells were grown anaerobically for 15 hrs in 20
ml de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth aliquots until
the OD600 was in the range of 0.5-0.8. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation at room temperature and
the pellets were immediately washed and resuspended in
500 µl RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). Total
RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol for difficult to
lyse cells with modifications including an extended incubation with proteinase K (40 mins). RNA was treated
with DNase using the Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion)
according to the routine DNase treatment protocol.
Then, 10 ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed with
random nonomers (MWG-Biotech, Germany) and the
ULS cDNA synthesis and labelling kit (Kreatech,
Amsterdam, Netherlands). Labelling took place at 85°C
for one hour.
Custom oligonucleotide microarrays that were
designed to include the annotated open reading frames
of the L. ruminis ATCC 25644 and ATCC 27782 genomes were commissioned and produced by Agilent Ltd.
(Santa Clara, California). Four 44 K microarrays were
present on each slide. Every 1000 nt of coding sequence

Page 12 of 15

was represented on the arrays by at least six features.
Where the sequence of a given probe was identical for a
gene common to ATCC 25644 and ATCC 27782, the
probe was represented on the array six, rather than
twelve times. A total of fourteen user defined control
probes were represented ten times on each array in
addition to the 1417 Agilent controls.
An Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on chip hybridization kit (Agilent) was used for hybridisation of the labelled cDNA to
the microarrays. Probe hybridization took place at 65°C
for 20 hrs with constant rotation (10 rpm). Microarrays
were scanned using the Agilent Microarray Scanner System (G2505B) and the scanned files were converted to
data files with Feature Extraction software (Aglient, version 9.1). Outliers were identified and removed using
the Grubbs test [81] and the mean of replicate probes
was calculated. The Cyber-T test [82] was employed to
calculate p-values. Significance was apportioned to
genes with an expression ratio ≥5 and a p-value of
≤1.0x10-4. Final expression ratios presented are the average of three biological replicates.
