thermoalkaline protease

Abstract
Background: Many workers have reported halotolerant bacteria from saline conditions capable of protease
production. However, antibiotic resistance and heavy metal tolerance pattern of such organisms is not
documented very well. Similarly, only a few researchers have reported the pattern of pH change of fermentation
medium during the course of protease production. In this study, we have isolated a halotolerant Bacillus cereus
SIU1 strain from a non-saline environment and studied its antibiotic and heavy metal resistance pattern. The isolate
produces a thermoalkaline protease and changes the medium pH during the course of fermentation.
Thermostability of protease was also studied for 30 min.
Results: Seventy bacterial strains isolated from the soils of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India were screened for protease
production. All of them exhibited protease activity. However, 40% bacterial isolates were found good protease
producers as observed by caseinolytic zones on milk agar plates. Among them, culture S-4 was adjudged as the
best protease producer, and was identified as Bacillus cereus by morphological, biochemical and 16 S rDNA
sequence analyses. The isolate was resistant to heavy metals (As2+, Pb2+, Cs1+) and antibiotics (penicillin,
lincomycin, cloxacillin, pefloxacin). Its growth behavior and protease production was studied at 45°C and pH 9.0.
The protease units of 88 ml-1 were noted in unoptimized modified glucose yeast extract (GYE) medium during
early stationary phase at 20 h incubation period. The enzyme was stable in the temperature range of 35°-55°C.
Conclusions: An antibiotic and heavy metal resistant, halotolerant Bacillus cereus isolate is capable of producing
thermoalkaline protease, which is active and stable at pH 9.0 and 35°-55°C. This isolate may be useful in several
industrial applications owing to its halotolerance and antibiotic and heavy metal resistance characteristics.

Background
In modern times, the products of biological origin, particularly enzymes, are attracting the attention of researchers. Their role in several biological and commercial
processes has been duly emphasized. Among all the
enzymes, proteases occupy an important niche as they
were the first to be produced in bulk, and now constitute ~66% of total enzymes employed [1].
Proteases are present in all living organisms, but
microbial proteases are most exploited group of industrial enzymes. Based on their mode of action, they are
further classified into four categories viz. alkaline, acid,
thiol and metallo proteases [2]. Since alkaline (serine)

proteases are active over a broad pH (7-12) and temperature (35°-80°C) ranges [3], they are world wide center of attraction for researchers. Several fungi,
actinomycetes and bacteria are endowed with the capacity to produce alkaline serine proteases in diverse
environmental and agroclimatic conditions [4]. However,
bacterial proteases are preferred as they grow rapidly,
need less space, can be easily maintained and are accessible for genetic manipulations.
The important protease producing bacteria are species
of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Arthrobacter and
Serratia. Among all bacterial species, bacilli play an
important role in production of alkaline protease owing
to their chemoorganotrophic nature [5]. Several species
of Bacillus are industrially employed to produce thermostable alkaline protease as they grow easily under extreme

pH and temperature conditions [6]. The enhancement of
protease production by genetic manipulation has been
well studied in B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus,
etc. by a number of researchers, which further underlines
the significance of this enzyme [3].
Proteases have diverse applications, mainly in the
detergent, food, leather and pharmaceutical industries
[3]. Highly thermoalkaline proteases appear to have better washing properties, and if fortified in detergents, the
washing can be conveniently performed at 50°-60°C [4].
Recently, microbial proteases have also been employed
in the treatment of waste water contaminated with
heavy metals and organic matter. Qiuhong et al. [7]
have reported a serine protease of Bacillus sp. B16 with
nematicidal properties.
Keeping the above in view, the present study was envisaged with the following objectives: 1) isolation and
screening of thermoalkaline protease producing isolates in
search of an efficient strain, 2) its characterization employing morphological and biochemical methods, followed by
16 S rDNA sequence analysis, 3) exploration of antibiotic
and heavy metal resistance pattern to elucidate potential
of strain under stress conditions, 4) its growth behavior
and protease production under unoptimized conditions
and 5) study of thermostability of alkaline protease.

Results and Discussion
Isolation and screening of thermoalkaline protease
producing bacterial cultures

The soil of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region is slightly alkaline, which supports rich and diverse microflora. Seventy
bacterial isolates producing variable caseinolytic zones
on milk agar plates were isolated from the soil samples.
The zones of clearance by isolates reflect their extent of
proteolytic activity. Those having clearance zone greater
than 3.0 mm were considered as significant [8]. Among
70 bacterial isolates, 28 (40%) exhibited good protease
activity which was reassessed by loading their culture
broth in the wells on milk agar plates (pH 9). The culture broth of good protease producers cleared more
than 3.0 mm zone within 4 h of incubation at 45° ± 1°C,
thereby indicating an extra-cellular nature of the protease. The isolate S-4, showing maximum clearance
zone diameter was selected for further studies.
Morphological, biochemical and molecular
characterization of isolate S-4

The isolate S-4 was rod-shaped, Gram-positive, strict
aerobe, motile, endospore former (single central spore)
with positive catalase and oxidase activity. It grew over a
wide range of pH (5-12), temperature (15°-55°C), NaCl
concentration (0.0-10%), and was able to hydrolyze
casein and gelatin. The strain was halotolerant as it
grew in the presence of 0.0-10% NaCl, but did not

Page 2 of 7

require salt for its physiological activities. On account of
morphological and biochemical characteristics, it was
identified as Bacillus sp. The isolate was deposited to
MTCC (accession number MTCC 9778), Institute of
Microbial Technology, Chandigarh (India). Analysis of
16 S rDNA sequence (1456 bp) revealed its 99% homology with Bacillus cereus strains, and was designated as
Bacillus cereus SIU1. The 1456 bp 16 S rDNA sequence
was submitted to Genbank [FJ:976896]. The strain SIU1
was in the same cluster of phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1)
with different strains of B. cereus. However, the 16 S
rDNA sequence analysis indicates that it is a different
and novel strain of B. cereus. The 16 S rDNA is the
most widely accepted gene employed for bacterial classification and identification. Goto et al. [9] suggested that
5′ end region (~275 bp) is the hypervariant (HV) region
in the gene, highly specific for each type strain, and considered as an useful index for identification or grouping
of Bacillus sp. Gupta et al. [1] emphasized that use of
molecular markers like 16 S rDNA as species-specific
identification tool have provided with a truly “microscopic” sensitivity down to single-cell detection.
Antibiotic sensitivity assay and heavy metal resistance
pattern

The strain SIU1 was resistant against penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin and pefloxacin, while sensitive to
other antibiotics tested. Antibiotics, for which the isolate
is resistant, may be supplemented to fermentation medium during enzyme production so as to check the contamination by other sensitive isolates. The organism also
exhibited a high degree of tolerance to elevated concentrations (μg ml -1 ) of lead (600), arsenic (2300) and
cesium (2100). It was tolerant to fairly high concentrations of cobalt (225), nickel (175) and chromium (125)
as well, but sensitive to even very low concentration of
selenium (25) and mercury (20). In leather industries,
this isolate may be useful for dehairing process as the
use of chromium is very common in the tanning process
[10]. Further, the protease producing organisms displaying heavy metal tolerance may be of potential use for
the treatment of multimetal contaminated sludge generated during wastewater treatment.
The increased load of antibiotics/disinfectants in
health care and heavy metals in industries creates the
selective pressure for the survival of bacteria in a contaminated environment. Thus, in a multiple stressed
environment, bacterial cells acquire resistance/tolerances
by alterations in genetic makeup either by mutation or
transfer of resistant genes among the bacteria.
Culture conditions and medium selection

The SIU1 strain exhibited typical sigmoidal growth
behavior in both the culture media. In glucose yeast

extract (GYE) broth, stationary phase commenced at
24th h, while in modified GYE broth, the onset of stationary phase was at 14 th h onward after a steep log
phase. In both the media, the stationary phase of bacterial growth witnessed maximum protease production.
However, the alkaline protease production was maximum (88 Uml-1, 20.95 U/mg) in modified GYE medium
at 20 h, while it was 68 Uml-1 (11.72 U/mg) at 28 h in
GYE medium (Fig. 2). Hence, modified GYE medium
was selected for further studies on protease production.
Production of protease during the stationary phase of
growth is in accordance with the studies of other workers [5,7,11,12]. Maximum protease production during
stationary phase may be due to high rate of protein
turnover for the sporulation process. The formation of
endospores in bacteria involves extensive protein

turnover, required for the synthesis of spore specific
proteins and enzymes [13]. Proteases are well known to
participate in proper protein turnover of cell. Evidence
for participation of proteolytic activity in regulation of
protein turnover was demonstrated by lack of proper
turnover in protease-deficient mutants [3]. The requirement of protease for bacterial sporulation has also been
demonstrated by use of protease inhibitors [14]. Zucca
and Balassa [15] have also found that Bacillus subtilis
produces two extracellular proteases during sporulation
stage.
The pH of modified GYE medium started declining
gradually after 4 h of growth from 9.0 to 4.71 up to 48
h, and thereafter increased to 6.4 at 60 h (Fig. 2). The
drop in pH may be attributed to the production of
organic acids, which were consumed during later stages

media at initial pH 9.0, 45°C and 120 rpm during 60 h growth.

of growth resulting in slight pH increase to 6.4. Our
findings are in accordance with Abusham et al. [16]
who have reported similar trend in pH change of Bacillus subtilis strain Rand culture medium during 48 h
growth albeit at different time intervals. In our study,
the growth and protease production was detected at as
early as 4 h (pH ~8.8) and reached maximum at 20 h of
incubation (final pH ~6.3). Hence, irrespective of
decrease in pH, the protease was produced during broad
pH change from 8.8 to 4.71. Further, the bacterial
growth as well as protease production was inversely
related to decrease in pH of modified GYE broth during
20 h incubation. However, at an extreme acidity (final
pH 4.71), the production of protease was greatly
reduced at 48 h (Fig. 2). The protease production maxima at slightly acidic pH (6.3) is in agreement with the
findings of Gouda [11] who has reported final pH in
slightly acidic to slightly alkaline range for maximum
protease production by Bacillus sp. MIG during 72 h
incubation. Abusham et al. [16] have also reported maximum protease production at final pH drop nearly to
6.5 by Bacillus subtilis strain Rand at 20 h growth. Our
results on growth behavior of Bacillus cereus SIU1 isolate and protease production with respect to pH change

are significant in the sense that when the initial pH of
modified GYE medium was maintained throughout at
9.0 or 6.0, both the growth and protease production
were greatly reduced (data not shown). Thus, we may
infer from our results that initial alkaline pH 9.0 is
essential for induction of alkaline protease production.
It requires further gradual fall to slightly acidic pH of
6.3 for maximum enzyme production. The pH of culture
broth strongly affects enzymatic processes and transport
of compounds across the cell membrane. However, the
molecular basis of pH affecting bacterial metabolism in
culture broth is obscure. Since proton motive force in
chemiosmosis is affected by the medium pH value, it is
possible that under optimum pH range, the relative
metabolic efficiency is high.
The temperature (45°C) for protease production is in
agreement with other workers, reporting enzyme production in a wide temperature range of 37°-80°C
[5,13,17]. Higher enzyme units in less time in modified
GYE than GYE broth was supposedly due to supplementation of peptone in the medium. It has already
been demonstrated by other researchers that addition of
complex organic nitrogen source(s) stimulates the protease production [17].

Thermostability of protease

The alkaline protease of strain SIU1 was completely
stable in the broad temperature range of 35°-55°C during 30 min incubation. However, with further increase
in every 5°C temperature, there was a gradual decrease
in enzyme stability ranging between 10-24% upto 80°C.
The enzyme retained 84, 60 and 42% activity even
after treatment at 60, 65 and 70°C, respectively. Even
at 80°C, residual protease activity was found 12% after
30 minute heating (Fig. 3). The protease of strain SIU1
is more thermostable than proteases studied by several
other researchers. Abusham et al. [16] have reported a
thermostable protease stable up to 55°C but retained
only ~40% activity at 65°C. A thermostable protease of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PseA retained 80% of its
initial activity after 30 min heating at 55°C [17]. Two
different proteases Pro 1 and Pro 2 of Bacillus sp.
MIG retained ~85-90% activity after 30 min heating at
50°C [11]. Hence it is evident that the alkaline protease
of strain SIU1 is more thermostable, and may be
applied to several biotechnological and industrial
purposes.

Conclusions
A thermoalkaline protease is produced by a novel isolate Bacillus cereus SIU1. The organism appears to
have greater potential for enhanced enzyme production through optimization of nutritional and physical
parameters. Resistance against heavy metals and antibiotics facilitates its use for various processes under
stressed conditions. Owing to its halotolerant

thermoalkaline nature, its protease may have potential
uses in industries such as detergent, food, pharmaceutical, leather, agriculture, etc. as well as molecular
biology techniques. Further studies on biochemical
and structural characteristics of protease are under
investigation.

Methods
Isolation and screening of thermoalkaline protease
producing bacteria

The soil samples were collected aseptically from
different districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India to
isolate protease producing bacteria. One g soil was
suspended in 9.0 ml sterile distilled water, agitated for
a min and 0.1 ml suspension was spread over milk
agar plates (pH 7) containing (gl -1 distilled water):
skimmed milk, 20.0; agar, 15.0, and incubated for 2030 h at 37° ± 1°C. Bacterial colonies showing clear
zones were selected, streaked twice on milk agar plates
for purification and maintained as pure culture over
nutrient agar slants (pH 7, 4°C). Bacterial isolates
having maximum protease activity, as measured by
caseinolytic zone diameter (mm) [8], were studied for
protease production in glucose yeast extract (GYE)
broth (pH 9) containing (gl-1 distilled water): glucose,
15.0; yeast extract, 5.0 and CaCl2.2H2O, 0.2 [12]. One
hundred μl of 24 h culture broth of each isolate was
loaded in the wells created on milk agar plates (pH 9)
and incubated for 4 h at 45° ± 1°C. The isolate having
maximum clearance zone was selected for further
studies.

Morphological, biochemical and molecular
characterization of selected isolate

The selected bacterial isolate S-4 was identified by morphological and biochemical characterization as per the
Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [18]. Molecular characterization was done by 16 S rDNA sequence
analysis. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using
Axygen Genomic DNA extraction Kit, and PCR amplification was employed with 16 S universal primers: 27F
(5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) at annealing
temperature of 50°C (25 cycles). The DNA fragment of
~1.4 kb was eluted from gel using Qiagen gel extraction
kit and employed as template for amplification of forward and reverse strands using 27F and 1492R primers,
respectively in separate sequencing PCR tubes. The
sequencing was carried out using ABI Prism-310 automated sequencer. The sequence of closely related taxa
of the isolate was retrieved from the GenBank database
using http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST[19]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor joining (NJ)
method; the significance of junctions was established
using bootstrap method (1000 replicates).
Antibiotic sensitivity assay and heavy metal resistance
pattern

The antibiotic sensitivity pattern of selected isolate was
studied by disc diffusion method [20]. The antibiotics
(μg/disc) used were cephalexin (30), penicillin (10),
kanamycin (30), co-trimoxazole (25), ampicillin (10),
amoxycillin (10), tetracycline (30), erythromycin (15),
lincomycin (15), cloxacillin (5), amikacin (30), cefaclore
(30), cefuroxime (30), ceftriaxone (30), ofloxacin (5),
cefadroxil (30), ceftaxidime (30), cefotaxime (30), pefloxacin (5), cefazoline (30), ciprofloxacin (5) and norfloxacin (10). Antibiotic impregnated discs were placed over
freshly prepared bacterial lawn on Mueller Hinton agar
(HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. India) plates and incubated at 35° ± 1°C for 24 h. The isolate was classified as
resistant or sensitive by the presence/absence of inhibition zone of growth around antibiotic discs.
To determine the heavy metal resistance pattern, 0.1
ml of bacterial culture having 0.5 OD (A620; 1 cm cuvette) was spread aseptically on Mueller Hinton agar
plates, supplemented with different concentrations
(μg ml-1) of the following heavy metals: Pb (0.0-700), As
(0.0-2500), Cr (0.0-200), Ce (0.0-2500), Hg (0.0-50), Se
(0.0-50), Ni (0.0-250) and Co (0.0-300). The metal salts
used were lead acetate [Pb(CH3COO)2], sodium arsenate
[Na2HAsO4], potassium dichromate [K2Cr2O7], cesium
chloride [CsCl], mercuric chloride [HgCl 2 ], selenium
sulphide [SeS], nickel chloride [NiCl 2 ] and cobaltous
chloride [CoCl2]. Bacterial growth was observed during
24-48 h at 35° ± 1°C.

Culture conditions and medium selection

The selected isolate designated as SIU1 was grown in
glucose yeast extract (GYE) and modified (in our
laboratory) GYE broth. The modified GYE broth
contained (gl-1 distilled water): glucose, 10.0; peptone,
10.0; yeast extract, 5.0 and NaCl, 5.0. To study the
growth behavior and protease production, 1.0 ml of
mother culture having 0.5 OD (A 620 ; 1 cm cuvette)
containing 3.4 × 107 cfu ml-1 was inoculated in 99 ml
of broth (pH 9; adjusted after autoclaving using sterilized 1 M Na2CO3) in Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated
at 45° ± 1°C on incubator shaker (120 rpm) for 60 h.
At 4 h interval, bacterial growth was assessed by
turbidity measurement at 620 nm. Each sample was
centrifuged at 16,000 g (4°C) for 5 min and cell-free
supernatant assayed for protease activity. The pH
change in culture broth was periodically measured
during the course of growth.
Enzyme assay

The proteolytic activity was assayed by casein digestion
method of Anson [21]. One ml of enzyme was incubated
with 3.0 ml of casein (1% (w/v) in 100 mM sodium
carbonate-bicarbonate buffer; pH 9) at 55° ± 1°C. The
reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of 3.0 ml
of 10% (w/v) trichloro acetic acid (TCA). The mixture
was centrifuged at 16,000 g (4°C) for 10 min, and supernatant used to estimate the amount of free tyrosine as
per Lowry et al. [22] using tyrosine as standard. One unit
of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
that liberates 1.0 μg of tyrosine min-1 ml-1.
Thermostability of enzyme

The effect of temperature on the stability of alkaline
protease stability was studied. The culture supernatant
containing protease was incubated for 30 min at different temperatures in the range of 35°-80°C. The treated
enzyme was immediately transferred to 0°C and kept for
15 min before activity measurement. The protease activity was assayed as per the method of Anson [21].
Statistical analysis

The experiments were performed thrice, each in triplicate. Standard deviation for each experimental result
was calculated using Microsoft Excel.
