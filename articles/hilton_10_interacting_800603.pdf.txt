Interacting with the public as a risk factor for
employee psychological distress
Michael F Hilton1,2*, Harvey A Whiteford1,2

Abstract
Background: The 1-month prevalence of any mental disorder in employees ranges from 10.5% to 18.5%. Mental
disorders are responsible for substantial losses in employee productivity in both absenteeism and presenteeism.
Potential work related factors contributing to mental difficulties are of increasing interest to employers. Some data
suggests that being sales staff, call centre operator, nurse or teacher increases psychological distress. One aspect of
these occupations is that there is an interaction with the public. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether
employees who interact with the public are at greater risk of psychological distress.
Methods: Data was collected from two studies. In study one 11,259 employees (60% female; mean age 40-years ±
SD 10-years) from six employers responded to the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) which
contained a measure of psychological distress, the Kessler 6 (K6). Employees were coded as to whether or not they
interacted with the public. Binomial logistic regression was performed on this data to determine the odds ratio (OR)
for moderate or high psychological distress in employees that interacted with the public. Study two administered the
HPQ and K6 to sales employees of a large Australian bank (N = 2,129; 67% female; mean age 39-years SD 10-years).
This questionnaire also probed how many contacts individuals had with the public in the past week. Analysis of
variance was used to determine if the number of contacts was related to psychological distress.
Results: In study one the prevalence of psychological distress in those that interacted and did not interact with
the public were 19% and 15% respectively (P < 0.001). Interacting with the public was associated with an increased
OR of 1.3 (P < 0.001) for moderate to high levels of psychological distress. In study two employees with less than
25 contacts with the public per week had a lower K6 score than those who had ≥ 25 contacts per week
(P = 0.016).
Conclusions: The results of the current study are indicative that interaction with the public increases levels of
psychological distress. Employees dealing with the public may be an employee subgroup that could be targeted
by employers with mental health interventions.

Background
Mental disorders are prevalent in general society,
including the working population. The recent Australian
Survey of Mental Health and Well-being found that 17%
of the general population had an anxiety or depressive
disorder in the previous 12 months[1]. In Australia it is
estimated that 10.5% of employees have a 1-month prevalence of any mental disorder[2]. Using data from
employees in the US National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) study, Kessler et al. find that 18.2% of US
employees have 1-month prevalence of any mental

disorder[3]. Not only are mental disorders prevalent but
they cause substantial losses in employee productivity
[4-11]. It is therefore in the interest of employers, governments and policy makers to reduce the incidence
and prevalence of mental health problems in the workplace. In this regard there have been numerous studies
attempting to identify workplace factors that increase
the risk of developing mental health problems in
employees.
Stress and mental health symptoms and/or conditions
have been shown to be problematic amongst nurses
[12-15], teachers [16-19], call centre operators [20,21]
and sales staff [3,22]. Encountering difficult clients was
reported as the largest risk factor for job stress in call

centre operators [21]. One element that all the aforementioned occupations have is that they all interact
with the public. Thus, we postulated that employee
interaction with the public may be a contributor to worsening employee mental health. To test this hypothesis
in Study 1 employee data from the Work Outcomes
Research Cost-benefit (WORC) project, described in the
methods, was extracted. Prevalence rates of psychological distress in employee categories of dealing and not
dealing with the public were examined. An additional
study (Study 2), with data collected separately from the
WORC study, was conducted in the sales force of a
large Australian bank. This data examines the changes
in psychological distress by the number of client interactions per week.

questioned respondents on the number of interactions
they had with the public in the previous week. In total
7,179 employees were invited to respond to the initial
questionnaire of which 30% (N = 2,129) responded (67%
female; mean age 39-years SD 10-years). Demographic
variables recorded by the HPQ included as covariates
for subsequent ANOVA comparisons are gender, age
(18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 66-64, 65 and over), marital
status (married or cohabiting, separated, divorced,
widowed and never married) and education level (less
than year 10, year 10, year 12, some tertiary education,
degree graduate, postgraduate degree).
The research was carried out in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration. The University of Queensland
Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study
protocol (Clearance number 2004000304).

Methods
Sample

The Kessler 6 (K6)

Data collected for this paper emanated from two separate studies. Firstly as part of the Work Outcomes
Research Cost-benefit (WORC) Project, employees of 58
large (> 1,000 employees) Australian employers were
presented with the World Health Organisation Health
and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). Detailed
descriptions of the recruitment of employers and
employees in the study have been previously published
[22,23]. 60,556 full-time employees had valid responses
to the HPQ (response rate 25%). Surveys were received
between October 2004 and December 2005. Only
employees over the age of 18-years were invited to participate. The HPQ included the Kessler 6 (K6) a brief survey quantifying psychological distress. Each individual
employer in the WORC project provided employee categories meaningful to that specific employer. This was
done so that an employer specific relevant report could
be delivered to each employer on the mental health profile of their organisation. Of the 58 participating companies six included an employee classification of customer
service, call centre or counter staff. These categories
were defined as those employees who interacted with
the public. In total the six employers included in the
study (Study 1) had 11,259 employees (60% female;
mean age 40-years SD 10-years). The prevalence of psychological distress in those employees who interacted
with the public versus all other employees for these six
employers was examined. The employers were from the
telecommunications, utilities, local government, federal
government and news media sectors. The percentage of
employees identified in the interaction with the public
category is located in Table 1 under the heading “% customer staff”.
In 2007 a second survey (including the HPQ and the
K6) was distributed via the internet to the sales staff of
a leading Australian bank (Study 2). This survey also

The K6 is a six-item scale of psychological distress that
strongly discriminates between those who meet and do
not meet diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder
[24-27]. The K6 has excellent internal consistency with
Chronbach’s alpha of 0.89[24]. In this study we
employed published methods where a K6 score of 0 to 7
reflects low psychological distress, a score of 8-12 indicates moderate psychological distress and a score of
13 to 24 represents high psychological distress[25,26].
Statistics

In data from the WORC project (Study 1) comparison
of the prevalence of moderate or high psychological distress by employees who do and do not interact with the
public was performed using Pearson’s c 2 statistic for
each separate employer and the data set as a whole.
These results are considered indicative as they do not
account for covariates. To determine the odds ratio
(OR) that interaction with the public may result in moderate to high psychological distress a binomial multivariate model with the outcome measure being
psychological distress (low psychological distress versus
moderate or high psychological distress) was run with
customer contact (yes or no) as a covariate and simultaneous additional covariates of sex, age, level of education and marital status. To further explore the
relationship between psychological distress and interaction with the public a multinomial logistic regression
was performed with K6 category as the dependent variable and K6 score of low psychological distress as the
reference category. For the multinomial logistic regression the factor of customer contact “Yes” or “No” was
examined while using covariates of gender, age, marital
status and education level. In the data from sales staff in
the Australian bank (Study 2), number of customer contacts was recorded. A univariate analysis of variance

(ANOVA) was performed with psychological distress
score (range 0 to 24) as the dependent variable, number
of customer contacts per week (categorised into 0 -24,
25 - 49, 50 - 89, 91 -149 and 150+) was the fixed factor
with covariates of sex, age, level of education and marital status.
All statistics were performed using SPSS Version 17.0.

Results
In the WORC sample (study 1) the mean age of both
the contact with the public and those without contact
with the public was 40-years old with no significant difference between the groups. The gender distribution
was significantly (c 2 < 0.001) different with those in
contact with the public having 66% females whilst those
without contact with the public had 48% females. Table
1 describes the prevalence of moderate or high psychological distress in employees defined as interacting with
the public versus all other employees (Study 1). What
can be noted from Table 1 is that in two of the six
employers the prevalence of psychological distress is significantly higher in employees that interact with the
public. In one employer the difference approached statistical significance (P = 0.06). If the data from all six
employers is combined the prevalence of psychological
distress in customer staff is 19% where as in non-customer staff the psychological distress prevalence is 15%.
This difference is statistically significant (P < 0.001).
These results are indicative that interacting with the
public may be associated with increased levels of psychological distress.
The above c2 analysis does not take into account the
influence of demographic variables on the presence or
absence of psychological distress. Table 2 presents the
results of binomial logistic regression with demographic
variables simultaneously included in the model along
with interaction with the public. Interacting with the
public significantly (P < 0.001) elevates the OR for moderate to high psychological distress to 1.3 once accounting for demographic covariates. Table 3 presents the
results of the multinomial logistic regression. It can be
noted from table 3 that customer contact significantly

increases the OR for moderate psychological distress to
1.13 and for high psychological distress to 1.33. This
indicates that customer contact is a greater risk factor
for high psychological distress than it is for moderate
distress. In both the binomial and the multinomial logistic regression gender was not a significant factor influencing the OR for psychological distress (p = 0.285 for
binomial regression and p = 0.369 and 0.146 for moderate and high psychological distress in multinomial
regression).
In the sample from the sales employees of the large
Australian bank (Study 2) 18.7% of employees had either
moderate or high psychological distress. Table 4 contains the results of the ANOVA with K6 score as the
dependent variable. This data indicates that all categories where customer contacts are > 24 per week are

Discussion
It is thought that employees such as nurses[12-15], teachers[16-19], call centre operators[20,21] and sales staff
[3,22], are at greater risk for psychological distress. We
hypothesised that occupations that require employees to
interact with the public may pose an increased risk of
psychological distress.

From the original WORC data (Study 1) the comparisons of psychological distress by whether employees
interact with the public or not (Table 1) raises the possibility that interacting with the public increases the prevalence of psychological distress over employees that do
not interact with the public. A limitation of this finding
may be that employee categories other than customer
services, contact centre staff or counter may have also
interacted with the public. If this conjecture is true, it
would likely lead to a reduction in the difference
between the defined categories of interacting with the
public and all other staff. Binomial logistic regression
results in table 2 confirm that interacting with the public significantly increases the OR for moderate or high
psychological distress. Multinomial logistic regression
results in table 3 indicate that customer contact significantly increases the OR for moderate and high psychological distress. Of interest here is that contact with the
public has a greater effect on the OR for high psychological distress.
Study 2 examines psychological distress by number of
customer contacts data from sales staff of a bank. Table
4 suggests that any interaction with the public of 25
contacts per week and above increases the mean psychological distress score. It may be that interaction with
the public per se does not predict psychological distress
it may in fact be that the number of difficult contacts is
the predictor. The total number of contacts may be a
surrogate for difficult contacts as the more contacts an
employee has the greater the risk of a difficult contact.
How employees, by nature or by training, are able to
deal with encountering a member of the public that is
difficult or abusive is not measured in this study.
Employees who have more difficulty dealing with the
emotions potentially arising from having to deal with
difficult members of the public would be expected to
show more psychological distress.
Due to the relative large numbers of employees surveyed the results that interaction with the public
increases psychological distress may be extrapolated to
other industries not surveyed in this study. However,

interaction with the public has different forms and may
not be equal across occupations. For example a nurse
interacting with the public likely has different components to the interaction than a sales person. It may be
more likely that a nurse is respected in client interactions than a sales person or call centre operator. How
various occupations change the relationship between
contact with the public and psychological distress is an
area where further research could focus.

Limitations
A limitation of this data is that all employees surveyed
in the bank study (Study 2) were identified as sales staff
and all except 13 of these had interactions with the public. Thus there was no group of substantial size of
employees who did not interact with the public for comparison. Additionally, as mentioned above, sales staff
have an increased risk of psychological distress. In the
bank sample all respondents were sales staff and there
may be aspects of sales, other than interacting with the
public, that increase the risk of psychological distress.
These potential other factors may serve to dilute the
ability to detect public interaction as a primary predictor
of psychological distress in the sales force.
A strength of the study is the large sample size however the sample of employees was not randomly
selected. Companies (employers) self-selected as to
whether they would participate in the project. Employees from the companies self-selected as to whether they
would respond to the survey. However, self-selection
biases in the current data are representative of those
inherent in any employee health screening survey. Companies self-select as to whether the run a HRA survey
and employees are free to choose whether they respond.
Consequentially the current paper represents phylogenetically valid methodology. The response rate of 25% to
the HPQ survey is low in epidemiological terms. However, this is the typical response rate obtained when
health questionnaires are sent to employees in multiple
large employers[28-31]. Although the response rate is
typical it may not be representative. Comparison of
responders to non-responders, to a questionnaire containing mental health questions, showed no statistical
difference in the Hamilton Depression Scale[32]. Previous studies indicate that a variation in the response
rate is not related to prevalence of chronic conditions
(including depression)[29]. Additionally in the data set
we present here we have previously shown that response
rates are not predictive of prevalence of psychological
distress[22].
The logistic and multivariate regressions in Study 1
and the ANOVA in study 2 included socio-demographic
variables as covariates. In addition to socio-demographic
variables health behaviours of employees could partly

Hilton and Whiteford BMC Public Health 2010, 10:435
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/435

explain the relationship between interacting with the
public and psychological distress. The health questionnaire applied, the HPQ, does not record data on health
behaviours. This is an area where further research could
focus.
Previous research has identified that an effort-reward
imbalance or decreased job control and increased job
demands may lead to increasing psychological problems
in employees. It may be that occupations that interact
with the public have alterations in these job characteristics. These variables were not part of the survey applied,
the HPQ. Further work on employee psychological distress and interaction with the public may benefit by
inclusion of job control-demands and/or effort-reward
explanatory variables.
For study 1 intensity/amount of interaction with the
public is not known in this sample. As in study 2, presented in this paper, future studies could include the
number of interactions with the public or the amount of
time spent interacting with the public as predictors of
psychological distress. As the data presented is cross
sectional, causality between psychological distress and
interaction with the public cannot be definitively established. For example it is possible that a psychological
distress my produce increased problems when interacting with the public.

Conclusions
The results of the current study support the contention
that interaction with the public increases levels of psychological distress in employees. Further research is
required to elicit the characteristics of employees that
make them vulnerable to respond with psychological
distress to certain interactions with the public and to
better understand how to provide employee training and
support programs that will assist to prevent or mitigate
this distress.
