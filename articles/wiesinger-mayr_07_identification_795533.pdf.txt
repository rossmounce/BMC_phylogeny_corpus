Abstract
Background: Pathogen identification in clinical routine is based on the cultivation of microbes
with subsequent morphological and physiological characterisation lasting at least 24 hours.
However, early and accurate identification is a crucial requisite for fast and optimally targeted
antimicrobial treatment. Molecular biology based techniques allow fast identification, however
discrimination of very closely related species remains still difficult.
Results: A molecular approach is presented for the rapid identification of pathogens combining
PCR amplification with microarray detection. The DNA chip comprises oligonucleotide capture
probes for 25 different pathogens including Gram positive cocci, the most frequently encountered
genera of Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermenter and clinical relevant Candida species. The observed
detection limits varied from 10 cells (e.g. E. coli) to 105 cells (S. aureus) per mL artificially spiked
blood. Thus the current low sensitivity for some species still represents a barrier for clinical
application. Successful discrimination of closely related species was achieved by a signal pattern
recognition approach based on the k-nearest-neighbour method. A prototype software providing
this statistical evaluation was developed, allowing correct identification in 100 % of the cases at the
genus and in 96.7 % at the species level (n = 241).
Conclusion: The newly developed molecular assay can be carried out within 6 hours in a research
laboratory from pathogen isolation to species identification. From our results we conclude that
DNA microarrays can be a useful tool for rapid identification of closely related pathogens
particularly when the protocols are adapted to the special clinical scenarios.

Background
Despite the continued progress in diagnosis and therapy
of sepsis and septicemia mortality remains high. Current
methods for the identification of microorganisms are
based on the cultivation of the pathogens from blood
with subsequent morphological and physiological characterisation [1]. More than 95 % of all bloodstream infections are caused by only 15 different genera of bacteria.
Staphylococci and E. coli account for more than 50 % of the
infections [2-6]. Treatment within six hours after the first
symptoms of bacteremia is crucial otherwise the infection
may progress to severe sepsis.
Automated blood culture systems such as BacT/Alert and
BACTEC9240 are the standard cultivation techniques in
modern clinical practice. False negative results occur periodically due to inappropriate growth conditions or antimicrobial treatment. Blood cultures without detectable
microbial growth are manually subcultured, and subsequently positive results were obtained in 3 to 40 % of the
cases depending on the detection method [5,7,8]. Conventional diagnostic methods last at least 24 hours due to
their requirement for microbial growth rates. In general
the detection and identification is a process taking two
days for most organisms or even longer for fastidious
organisms [9-11]. In contrast to this, DNA-based methods
meet the needs for a fast, reliable and thereby life-saving
diagnosis [12,13]. Methods based on PCR amplification
and subsequent hybridisation of fluorescent probes seem
to be most promising approaches for early diagnosis
[1,14]. Several molecular methods, including the utilisation of fluorescently labelled probes, have been tried for
the detection of clinical pathogens. Fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (FISH), PCR, real time PCR, single strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and oligonucleotide microarrays have been adapted for the identification
of isolated microorganisms from bacteraemia patients
[3,15-23]. All DNA based pathogen identification methods for bloodstream infections comprise the detection of
viable and dead cells as well as released microbial DNA of
already lysed cells. This can lead to misinterpretation of
molecular biology based detection methods on bacteria
counts compared to pathogen numbers found in patients'
blood using cultivation methods where e.g. only up to 102
pathogens per mL blood were reported in cases of severe
sepsis. In contrast, applying quantitative RT-PCR, the density of gram positive or negative microorganisms in blood
was found in a range of 104 to 107 per mL in bacteremia
patients. Hackett even showed a concentration peak in
severe cases of septicaemia to a maximum of 1.8 × 109
bacteria per mL [24-26]. Heininger et al. (1999) demonstrated the advantage of PCR detection of preceding antibiotic treatment in a rat model. Whereas the detection rate
of classical blood cultures falls to 10 % within 25 min

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

after intravenous administration of cefotaxime, the PCR
detection rate is still 100% at that time [27].
The microarray technology has been described as a powerful tool to assess multiple parameters at the same time
for various clinical scenarios such as pathogen identification of urinary tract infections (UTI), acute upper respiratory tract infections, periodontal pathogens and human
intestinal bacteria. Microarrays are further applied for the
analysis of microbial gene expression and diversity [2832].
In this study a DNA microarray-based assay is presented
which allows the identification of 25 different bloodstream infection relevant pathogens (bacteria and fungi)
from whole blood samples. The array represents a further
contribution towards a possible implementation of DNA
chips in clinical diagnostics. The complete analysis can be
done within 6 hours in a research laboratory starting with
pathogen isolation from artificially-spiked blood to species identification. Such a rapid diagnostic test could support decisions for antibiotic treatments due to accurate
discrimination of closely related species.

Results
Probe and array design
Bacterial 16S rRNA sequences and 18S rRNA sequences of
Candida sp. were imported into the arb software database
and aligned to sequences present in the database. A phylogenetic tree of all species which can be identified with
the newly developed microarray was calculated using the
neighbour joining method. All in all 96 different DNA
probes were designed using the arb software package.
Additional probes were downloaded from the probeBase
website [33]. More than 116 different probes were applied
and separately evaluated in this study and 76 probes were
further kept for the final set up (see table 1). The other
ones were removed because of cross hybridisations or
insufficiently specific signal responses. The hybridisation
behaviour was found to be difficult to predict but calculating binding capacities by consideration of weighted mismatches still gives a very precise idea about overall species
identification patterns (see table 2 and 3). However, different probes for identification of the same species still
performed differently although they had equal in silico
predicted behaviour, similar positions on the marker
gene, similar G+C contents, lengths and melting temperatures (compare probes ecl4, ecl6 and ecl7 in table 1 and figure 1).

To determine optimal probe quantities on the microarray
different probe concentrations (10, 20 and 50 µM) were
printed in a defined buffer. Probe concentrations of 50
µM gave highest signals. Probe concentrations above 50
µM were not tested since they were already found in other

Specificity
An in silico hybridisation matrix was generated with the
Probe Match function in the ARB software package and the
CalcOligo software. The modelled hybridisation behaviour

of each probe was in good agreement with real experimental data (for comparison see fig. 1 and Additional file 1).
Cross hybridisation within the Enterobacteriaceae family
was already predicted by in silico calculations due to highly
conserved 16S rRNA sequences and confirmed by experimental results. The calculated matrix showed similar
hybridisation patterns as achieved through hybridisation

Figure 1
Normalised signal intensities of all hybridisation experiments listed by probe and species
Normalised signal intensities of all hybridisation experiments listed by probe and species. The raw signal values were first normalised using quantile normalisation, and then averaged across spot-replicates and hybridisation-replicates (real values were
divided by 1000 for better visualisation). No cut off value or signal limit was set in order to use absolute intensities for normalisation and table calculation. Background signals were subtracted prior to statistical evaluation. Background corrected hybridisation signals of 5001 – 10000, 10001 – 20000, and > 20001, are indicated in grey, dark grey and black, respectively.
Normalised values lower than 5000 are not colour-coded. For calculations absolute values were used without defining a
threshold that led to indication of low signals even when signals were flagged negative by the GenePix analysis software. Species are listed according to the phylogenetic relation of 16S and 18S rRNA sequences. Probes are sorted by species specificity.
Abbreviations of probe names are listed in table 1.

Figure 2
Examples of individual hybridisation results
Examples of individual hybridisation results. Experiments using E. coli (A) and S. aureus (B) were done as dilution series near
their limit of detection. E. coli shows a much lower detection limit of 10 bacteria per assay than S. aureus with 103 bacteria per
assay. Even at lowest sensitivity level specific hybridisation patterns can still be obtained. Grey, black and white bars represent
specific and non-specific signals as well as positive controls (BSrev is the hybridisation control and pr_FW and pr_FW T7 are
PCR amplification controls). Error bars represent the mean of 6 replicate spots on the microarray. These figures only display
intensities of spot signals which were flagged positive automatically by the GenePix Software. However for statistical analysis
(quantile normalisation) all signals were evaluated. Results were controlled by visual inspection of image files.

assays (see Additional file 1). Due to the application of
short oligonucleotide probes it was possible to discriminate sequences differing from each other by a single nucleotide. This was demonstrated using probe ecl 6 (starting at
E. coli position 643, see table 1) that matches perfectly
with the species E. cloacae and K. oxytoca generating average signal intensities of 23000, 41000 respectively. In contrast, hybridising amplified 16S rDNA of the species E.
aerogenes and K. pneumoniae resulted in no detectable signal because of a nucleotide change at E. coli position 653
(cytosine is changed for a thymine in the bacterial
genome). This mismatch was only weighted with 0.8
applying the parameters described in table 2 and 3.
Normalised signal values of 241 hybridisation experiments are summarised in Fig 1 and also supplied as table
(see Additional file 2). The observed hybridisation values
showed low coefficient of variation (CV) among the 6 replicate spots and between the different assays. The CV of all
specific signals ranged from 2.4 % to 64.1 % for 80 % of
the probes. High CV values resulted from experiments
done at or just above the detection limit yielding only
faint signals (e.g. when 10 E. coli or 102 K. pneumoniae cells
were used per assay. For further details see the paragraph
"Sensitivity"). Since in clinical routine the possibility of
little initial bacterial quantities is rather high reliable
result interpretation must be guaranteed even at low bacterial loads. This represents a limitation of short oligonucleotide microarrays since they are at risk to lead to a
misinterpretation of results below or also near the detection limit. Species that were not used at the detection
limit, such as S. marcescens or S. maltophilia, gave lower CV
values ranging from 5 % to 18 %. As expected from CalcOligo analysis, cross-hybridisations of individual probes
occurred within the Enterobacteriaceae family especially in
the group of Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Citrobacter. However,
specific signal patterns could be assigned to each species
enabling the identification of cultures at species level. For
Acinetobacter and Proteus reliable identification is only
guaranteed at genus level which is sufficient for most clinical applications.
Sensitivity
Limits of bacterial detection (LOD) were assessed with
spiked blood samples and pure cultures using dilution
series from 108 to 100 bacteria per mL from selected gram
positive and gram negative bacterial species. The detection
limit in pure cultures was lower than in spiked blood due
to PCR interference of blood components. PCRs carried
out from pure cultures were found to amplify DNA down
to 103 cells per assay resulting in a clearly visible band on
a 1.5% agarose gel.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

Specific and reproducible signals down to 10 bacteria per
assay could be achieved for E. coli. Analysis of Staphylococcal cultures revealed the highest detection limit within the
group of gram positive bacteria with about 103 cells necessary per assay to see signals on the microarray (see Fig. 2).
Sensitivity studies were carried out with other gram negative and positive species and found to be similar to those
mentioned before. C. freundii and K. pneumoniae had a
detection limit of 102 bacteria per assay whereas E. faecalis
and S. epidermidis were detectable only at 103 cells per
assay. This difference in sensitivity can be ascribed to less
efficient cell lysis due to the presence of a persistent cell
wall and the presence of a thermostable DNAse in the Staphylococcal proteome [34]. The adaptation of the protocol to different cell lysis steps or an additional enzymatic
treatment can certainly further improve the detection
limit.
Parallel detection of pathogens
The densities of bacterial suspensions were adjusted as
described in Materials and Methods and equal amounts
were added to single species and double species experiments. The hybridisation results of combinations of different strains were compared to those of single strains. The
multiple microbial assays produced a signal pattern that
matched the compounded signals of single species
hybridisations (see Fig. 3). Due to these results a clear differentiation of species in a multiple microbial infection is
possible. Some experiments were carried out based on
spiked blood confirming the results of pure cultures (Fig.
4B). Parallel detection showed that most probes generated
weaker signal intensities when two pathogens were
present in one sample. This fact would lead to a lower sensitivity when polymicrobial samples are handled which
enhances the risk of false result interpretation near the
detection limit.
Hybridisation of blood sample isolates
Starting from bacterial DNA isolated from blood PCR and
labelling protocols were optimised with respect to reducing interference of blood components. Addition of glycerol and betaine reduced non-specific amplification
during the PCR and labelling steps in spite of large
amounts of residual human DNA. By this means the yield
of specific PCR product was also clearly increased resulting in equal specificities as with cultured microbes. No
cross-hybridisation provoked by human DNA was
observed (Fig 4A). Similar results were obtained when
detecting combinations of single microbes simulating
multiple microbial infections as already described above.
The obtained signal patterns were as specific for the added
strains as those from single species microarray hybridisations (Fig. 4B).

Identification based on microarrays was 100 times more
sensitive than the agarose gel evaluation demonstrated.

The sensitivity of the method was determined by providing a ten-fold dilution series in 10 mL spiked blood.
Detection limit was found to be as low as 10 bacteria per
mL whole blood. However, as observed with pure cultures
the sensitivity of gram positive bacteria is much lower, e.g.
105 per mL blood for S. aureus.
Normalisation
Normalisation is an important aspect of all microarray
experiments. Usually it requires a set of probes which are
expected to give a constant signal throughout all hybridisations. In the present application there are no endogenous genes or sequences to suit this requirement.
Therefore the only other option would be to spike known
amounts of sequences similar to the 16S rRNA gene into
bacterial suspension before cell lysis or directly into the
DNA extract. However, spike controls are known to be
potentially unreliable due to inaccuracies in nucleic acid
quantitation and pipetting errors. Also, there could be
competitive effects between the spike oligonucleotide and
the target 16S gene during PCR, thus introducing a bias.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

Therefore a quantile normalisation approach was chosen,
based on the assumption that each array should have a
number of probes which give a positive signal (corresponding to the pathogen present in the sample) and the
rest of the probes a low (or no) signal. This algorithm is a
between-array normalisation approach which shifts the
signal density of each hybridisation towards an average
density across all hybridisations [35].
Classification
Fig 5 shows the clear clusters of hybridisations as well as
of probes. Although each probe was designed to bind to
one specific pathogen, the heatmap shows that some
probes are very specific to one species while others yield
signals for a wider range of different organisms and a few
probes do not show any specific signal at all. A classical
approach would be to evaluate each probe set across all
hybridisations and define a signal threshold e.g. by ROC
analysis [36] to distinguish positive from negative signals.
However, since some probes show cross-hybridisation
between species or even genera, this would not only lead

of information contained in the cross-hybridisation patterns. A machine learning approach was used to classify a
hybridisation pattern by similarity to hybridisations with
known organisms. The k-Nearest Neighbour (k = 1)
method was used and validated in a leave-one-out crossvalidation approach. At genus level, all 241 hybridisations
were classified correctly and 96.7% at species level. In 6
cases the species P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and in 2 cases
A. baumannii and A. radioresistens were confounded.
These misclassifications are not surprising, taking into
account the high sequence similarity between the respective organisms. Possibly some of the misclassifications are
due to low numbers of hybridisations in the test set, and
could be avoided by adding more experiments to the test
set.

Discussion
The present microarray for the identification of blood isolates is so far the first microarray-based molecular diagnostic tool to identify a wide range of clinically relevant
bacteria and yeast directly from blood in an appreciated
period of time. Another similar approach applying isolates of positive blood cultures has been published previously [37]. The authors of this article introduce 19-mer
16S rDNA signature oligonucleotides which were spotted
on Ta2O5- coated microarrays in order to allow evanescent-waveguide readout. Hybridisation data were analysed using hierarchical clustering analysis and pattern
recognition appyling a decision tree.
The combination of PCR amplification with microarray
hybridisation represents a powerful tool for pathogen
identification. It exceeds conventional technologies in
speed while performing at an extremely high specificity.
Analysis of 16S rRNA genes has been reported before to
allow a more robust, reproducible, and accurate testing
than phenotypic methods [38]. Over 27000 sequences
have been analyzed in the ARB software package to design
species- and genus-specific microarray probes and calculate the hybridisation behaviour of these probes to target
DNA from the respective bacterial species. Predicted and
experimental values showed strong correlation. Short oligonucleotide probes ranging between 20 and 30 mer were
used for this study because they allow distinct discrimination of single nucleotide differences under stringent conditions. Their hybridisation properties are fundamentally
different compared to long oligonucleotide probes which
usually have a length of 50 to 80 mer thus showing higher
binding capacities and thereby leading to higher detection
sensitivities on a microarray. However, the threshold of
differentiation of long oligonucleotide probes is at best 90
% sequence similarity, which makes them not suitable for
species identification based on the 16S rRNA marker gene.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

Other marker genes were considered as potential targets
for probe design especially some genes already known for
their elevated sequence variability that might allow better
discrimination of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, an eminent advantage of the 16S marker
gene is its good characterisation and the online availability of thousands of sequences. Furthermore in the meantime there is an ARB databank for free downloading on
the homepage of the Technical University Munich which
contains more than 50000 complete and aligned 16S
rRNA sequences including phylogenetic relations calculated by the neighbour joining method. Additional
sequences can be downloaded from any online database
or manually added to the ARB database. This way the
accession to 390 973 sequences of 16S rRNA genes is possible through the Ribosomal Database Project II http://
rdp.cme.msu.edu/ (release 9.52; July 5, 2007). With our
approach we showed that this marker gene is well suited
to discriminate even very closely related species. It was further demonstrated that analysis based on ribosomal RNA
can be performed in presence of a strong background of
human DNA.
Taking all the considerations into account there still
remain two possible approaches for probe design. First
the use of long oligonucleotide probes which allows high
sensitivity. However, for equal specificity the application
of several marker genes would be necessary to identify the
whole panel of microbes. Such an approach necessitates
the realisation of a multiplex PCR that might attenuate
benefits in sensitivity of long probes. Further distinct species discrimination within the family Enterobacteriaceae
would still be difficult. On the other hand the employment of short probes targeting solely the 16S rRNA gene
also allows good discrimination and even species identification by pattern recognition within very closely related
species. Applying stringent conditions this approach even
allows detection of single nucleotide differences (compare figure 1 with Additional file 2). Furthermore the use
of the most characterised marker gene with the highest
number of available sequences allows reliable in silico predictions based on experimentally obtained data.
Standard clinical identification procedures require 2 days
and up to 5 days for microorganisms that are difficult to
cultivate. In contrast to cultivation- and bacterial enrichment dependent methods microarrays enable not only a
fast and accurate but also highly parallel identification of
different microorganisms in one assay. The present protocol can be carried out within 6 hours from drawing blood
to the presentation of results by an analysis software,
when gel electrophoresis for PCR product confirmation
and pre-hybridisation are carried out in parallel with
labelling reaction. Most identifications were realised analysing 6 different samples and 1 positive as well as 1 neg-

ative control. Therefore 8 samples had to be proceeded in
parallel. The DNA preparation lasted 1.5 hours, the amplification reaction 2.5 hours, the labelling 50 min, the
hybridisation 1 hour, the washing 10 minutes and the
scanning also 10 minutes. The applied mastermixes and
buffers were prepared prior to the analysis in large
amounts so that each solution was ready to use. Thus
diagnosis can be obtained within a working day when
blood is collected from the patient in the morning. The
current assay time of 6 hours can be easily reduced by 2
hours using meanwhile commercially available fast PCR
devices (PCR run time: 20 mins). Online fluorescence
scanner or electrode chip based systems could be applied
for faster assay performance. A further reduction in assay
time can be achieved when DNA isolation from blood is
done as an automated and integrated process. Such sys-

tems are currently being tested in the clinical practice. The
shorter duration would allow the realisation of several
detection runs per day. Additionally, the handling steps
would thus be reduced thereby reducing the danger of
infection for personnel performing the assay.
Furthermore compared to cultivation-based identification
procedures DNA based methods have the advantage to
enable even the detection of static or dead cells before
genome degradation e.g. in the case of administration of
antibiotics when no further growth in culture can be
observed [27]. However DNA-based detection methods
are not able to distinguish between alive and dead cells
which might lead to misguiding therapeutic conclusions
since initial antibiotic treatments are always applied prior
to first blood withdrawal. In the case of multiple infec-

tions, where one species is already eradicated by antibiotics, the other species could be underestimated due to a
high amount of DNA from the non-viable bacteria.
Most studies on nucleic-acid based identification of
blood-borne pathogens, including multiplex-PCR, realtime PCR and microarrays, were so far restricted to blood
cultures and mostly to the identification of selected members of the Enterobacteriaceae family or gram positive bacteria like Staphylococcus and Streptococcus [3,17,39-44]. The
application of microarrays for pathogen identification of
clinical specimens has already been proposed earlier.
Amongst published tools are arrays for upper respiratory
tract infections, urinary tract infections, human faeces
analysis and blood stream infections. Microbial detection
has been achieved applying different marker genes
because of known inconvenience of 16S rRNA due to high
sequence similarities between closely related species. The
suitability of 23S rRNA, the topoisomerases gyrB and parE
has been proven for distinct species discrimination
[4,30,31,42] The small and large subunit rRNA genes, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants have
been successfully applied as markers for the detection of
bloodstream infections [43,45]. However, all microarray
based studies were carried out so far with clinical specimens isolated from blood culture that partially neutralises
the main advantage of identification by molecular methods. On the other hand direct detection from whole blood
samples implicates higher detection limits. A general limitation of microbial detection microarrays compared to
blood cultures is the generation of false negative results
for species with no specific probe within the panel. This
study was carried out with whole blood and it was shown
that no cross-hybridisation is caused by human background DNA (Fig. 4). The developed probe panel further
covers the species most frequently associated with bloodstream infections and can easily be extended. The applied
normalisation has the advantage that no more control is
needed for correct classification of the outcomes. Each
result can be added to the classifier leading to even more
precise calculations.
The present pathogen identification microarray is to our
knowledge the first microarray assay for the parallel identification of a total of 23 blood-born bacterial species as
well as 2 clinical relevant Candida species which enables
pathogen identification down to 101 CFU/mL blood without any preculturing. Using this microarray for pure cultures detection limits in the range of 101 and 103 bacteria
per assay were achieved, whereas the limit of detection for
bacteria in spiked blood was found to be 101 to 105 bacteria per mL blood depending on the targeted microbes.
Since even in blood of severe sepsis patients only 102 viable pathogenic cells per mL blood can be found this high
detection limit is a clear shortcoming of this method

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

implicating false negative results or the risk of detection of
mostly dead cells thus leading to misguidance. The higher
LOD of spiked blood samples compared to pure cultures
results from PCR inhibitory components in blood
[46,47]. Additional DNA purification can reduce the
amount of these inhibitors, but high levels of residual
human DNA still render lower LOD difficult. Due to high
sequence similarities of the 16S rRNA gene short oligonucleotide probes were used in order to increase specificity.
However, such an improvement implicates a reduction of
sensitivity which also leads to strong signal variations near
the limit of detection. In our study this problem could be
overcome by microarray result evaluation by the developed pattern recognition which quantities and normalises
signal strengths. But in routine application this fact would
display a high risk of result misinterpretation near the
detection limit.
Different approaches to increase signal intensity and to
further reduce the LOD of microarray analysis may be
applied to this test. One possibility is the usage of a rotating microchamber for supporting the stirring of the
hybridisation mix [48-51]. Other improvement strategies
concern the choice of probes for detecting pathogens. This
includes the introduction of poly-T spacers to DNA
probes to avoid steric hindrance during hybridisation,
investigating different lengths of probes or enlarge the
probe selection to several thousands in order to produce
specific patterns and to cover a wide range of identifiable
organisms [52-54].
The presented pathogen microarray includes 76 DNA
probes with an average length of 20–30 bp, all derived
from the prokaryotic and eukaryotic small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Due to high sequence similarities in the
16S rRNA gene especially among members of the Enterobacteriaceae group, it was evident that not all designed
DNA probes would give 100% species-specific signals on
the microarray. However, we could overcome this problem by taking advantage of the species-specific patterns of
signals obtained after microarray hybridisation. Applying
a supervised k-Nearest neighbour (k = 1) classification
method all of the tested bacteria and yeasts were identified correctly at the genus level and 96.7 % at the species
level. High 16S rDNA sequence similarity caused only
misclassification in case of P. mirabilis and vulgaris and A.
radioresistens and baumanii, respectively.
Based on this microarray 25 different microbes of bloodstream infections are identifiable. However this panel may
be expanded by further organisms as new pathogens
appear in clinical routine and slight variants are observed
when organisms are isolated from clinical specimens in
different regions [4]. Further microorganisms could be
Staphylococcus lugdunensis, streptococci like S. agalactiae,

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:78

Salmonella spp., Aeromonas spp. or Candida krusei which
could be easily included in the current microarray by
designing species- and genus specific probes for them.
A database was established serving as a classifier for the
applied statistical method. This analysis method includes
pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. The
chosen algorithm K-nearest-neighbour method executes
an accurate identification within a fully automated platform. Moreover a software package is under development
which includes the flexibility of subsequent addition of
single probes, individual species, groups of species or even
an exchange of the whole classifier. A possible enlargement of the classifier by addition of further hybridisation
results increases the specificity of identification, by reducing misinterpretation possibility due to false negative signals or cross hybridisations (especially for Proteus and
Acinetobacter species). Such a software allows automatic
processing of microarray image files and will retrieve
genus and species level identification. Additionally, recommendations of appropriate antibiotic treatments can
be given from the statistical assessment of periodically
updated information on antibiotic resistances. However,
such guidance only relies on past data of statistical
records. The most appropriate assistance would be gained
based on antibiotic resistance determination by detection
of the genetic determinants. Such information can only be
obtained by the realisation of multiplex PCR which would
further reduce the sensitivity of the method.
Since seven percent of all bloodstream infections are polymicrobial [9], the probe pattern and the classification
algorithm were also tested for randomly selected dual bacterial combinations. Signal patterns from multiple microorganisms detection could be predicted from single
microbe signals. In each case both pathogens present in
the sample could be correctly identified. Negative controls
of unspiked blood gave negative PCR amplification and
hybridisation results. This confirms the absence of bacteria or bacterial DNA in the blood of healthy humans
[55,56].
The combination of microbial identification with clinical
antibiotic resistance determination reveals a considerable
potential. DNA microarrays have already been adopted
for detection of quinolone-resistant E. coli or for the genotyping of TEM beta-lactamases [57,58]. An antibiotic
resistance microarray specifically targeted to blood-born
pathogens is under development in our group following
the successful establishment of a first prototype array.

Conclusion
In this study we have developed a rapid and sensitive
method for DNA based identification of clinically relevant
pathogens that cause bloodstream infections. The micro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

array method has been shown to detect and identify pathogens down to concentrations of 10 bacteria per mL
within 6 hours. Relying on the analysis of signal patterns
the assay specificity was determined to be 100 % at genus
level and more than 96.7 % at species level. However,
depending on clinical specimen the isolation protocol
must be adapted in order to optimise microbial DNA
yield and to assure maximum safety to operating personnel. But the work also shows that a microarray based on
the 16S rRNA marker gene is a potentially powerful identification tool for routine clinical laboratory diagnostics.
Additionally the range of identifiable organisms can easily
be extended to new pathogens and also multimicrobial
infections can be considered.

Methods
Samples – Reference Strains
All reference strains tested in this study were obtained
from the American type culture collection (ATCC) or the
"Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkultur" (DSMZ). In addition to the reference strains probe
specificity and sensitivity were also tested with clinical isolates which had been identified by classical microbiology
methods. For long term storage all bacterial strains were
kept as 50 % glycerol stocks at -80°C. For most of the
experiments pure cultures of a certain number of bacteria
per mL were used which were obtained by cultivating the
respective microbe in Caso bouillon overnight at 37°C
and finally adjusting the microbe concentration per mL
using a Mc Farland standard # 0.5. All experiments and
the validation of the microarray were carried out using
clinical isolates and only some culture collection strains.
Clinical isolates were directly identified in the hospital
laboratories based on commercial microbial identification techniques subsequent to blood culture. Cultures
were delivered in cryovials, Microbank from Pro Lab Diagnostics (Neston, United Kingdom). Microarray testing
was performed on Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218, clinical

mentioned above without any specification of microorganism collection are clinical isolates.
Oligonucleotide probe design
Probe design and analysis were performed with the ARB
software package [59]. Selected ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
sequences of pathogenic bacteria and yeasts were downloaded from the GenBank of the NCBI homepage and
uploaded to the ARB software package to create a database
comprising over 27.000 16S rDNA sequences but also
over 7000 18S rDNA sequences to detect possible mismatches with eukaryotic sequences. After the new
sequences had been aligned to the preexisting database
[release June 2002] a phylogenetic tree was calculated
using the neighbour joining method. Probes were
designed for species and selected genera based on the
results of the ARB software using the Probe Design function including alterable parameter settings such as probe
length (20 bases), maximum non group hits, G+C content, melting temperature and minimum hairpin loops.

Probe sequences were tested for duplex and hairpin formation and melting temperature with the software
"Oligo". Every single probe was optimised regarding melting temperature and duplex formation by deleting or adding bases. Final probe sequences were checked with the
Probe Match function in ARB. Each generated hybridisation table with sequences of organisms matching to any
single probe served as input for CalcOligo [60], a software
for weighted mismatch calculation. Mismatches were
weighted according to experimentally determined formulas. (see table 2 and table 3).
Single mismatches of each probe were added to yield a
total weighted value for each species. Values were
arranged to generate an in silico calculated hybridisation
matrix, sequentially tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet.
Microarray preparation
Synthesised oligonucleotide probes were obtained from
VBC Genomics (Vienna, Austria). At the 5' end of each
oligo 5 thymine residues were added as spacer molecules.
In order to ensure covalent linkage to the reactive aldehyde group on the microarray surface (CSS-100 Silylated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/78

Slides, Cel Associates, Texas) probes were 5' amino-modified. Probes were printed at different concentrations (50
µM, 20 µM and 10 µM in 3× SSC and 1.5 M betaine
monohydrate) onto the silylated glass slides by the contact arrayer Omnigrid from GeneMachines (San Carlos,
California) while the adjusted air humidity was between
55 and 60 %. 6 replicates of each probe were printed per
microarray. Spotting was carried out with SMP 3 pins (TeleChem, Sunnyvale, California) leading to a spot size of
100 µm diameter.
A hybridisation control probe (5' -TTA AAA CGA CGG
CCA GTG AGC) was spotted on the array applying the
same conditions as used for the target capture probes.
DNA isolation
Blood samples were taken by sterile withdrawal into a 10
mL K3E tube (BD Vacutainer Systems) from Becton Dickinson (Oxford, UK). Bacteria were spiked into blood by
adjusting the appropriate density using McFarland standard # 0.5 and transfering the correct volume or dilution
into 10 mL whole blood. For preliminary blood cell lysis
3 mL of Tris-EDTA (TE) (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8)
were added, mixed and centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min.
The supernatant was discarded and a pellet volume of
about 0.75 to 1 mL remained in the Falcon tube. TE lysis
was repeated by addition of 10 mL TE buffer, vigorously
vortexing and centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was than discarded to obtain a cell pellet of a
volume of about 50 µL which was resuspended in physiological NaCl and carefully transferred to the top of a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) solution. Physical density of Percoll was adjusted
to 1.05 g/cm3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The density centrifugation was carried out at 1500 g
for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet
was rinsed twice with physiological NaCl in order to
remove residual Percoll. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of distilled water and cell lysis was done
by heating the suspension to 95°C for 15 min. The lysed
suspension was centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min to
remove cell debris and to obtain the released DNA. The
supernatant, containing the resulting DNA, was transferred to a new tube.
DNA amplification
For DNA amplification a multiplex PCR was performed
targeting the small ribosomal subunits of eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. The 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified
employing the forward primer 27 T7 (5'- TAA TAC GAC
TCA CTA TAG AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG) and the
reverse primer 1492 (5'- TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG
ACT T) (VBC Genomics, Vienna, Austria) (0.3 nM in PCR
mixture) [61]. The forward primers contained the T7 promoter site (5'-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG -3') at their 5'

end, which enabled T7 RNA polymerase mediated in vitro
transcription using the PCR products as templates for
direct comparison of different labelling methods [62].
Candida species were identified by prior amplification of
the 18S rRNA gene with the primers CanFW (5'- TCC GCA
GGT TCA CCT AC) and CanRev (5'- CAA GTC TGG TGC
CAG CA) [63].
Bacteria in 10 mL whole blood served as target scenario
for optimisation of generation of full length 16S rRNA
amplicons. Efficiency of the PCR was optimised with bacterial DNA isolated from 1 mL blood by varying the concentrations of different components and adding PCR
enhancers. Most efficient amplification was found by
addition of 5 µL DNA extract. Optimal conditions for a 25
µL PCR reaction mixture were: 3 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), 2.5 µL 10× PCR-buffer,
0.5 mM each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2; 10 % glycerol and 0.5
% betaine.
PCR cycling included an initial denaturation step at 95°C
for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec,
55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min using a Biometra
T3000 Thermocycler (Goettingen, Germany). Temperature cycles were terminated at 72°C for 10 min to complete partial amplicons, followed by storage at 4°C until
further usage.
Successful amplification was confirmed by resolving the
PCR products on a 1.5 % agarose gel (SeaKem, Biozym,
Vienna, Austria) with ethidium bromide in TBE buffer
(0.1 M Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK).
Labeling
The primer extension method showed the best sensitivity
and specificity and was therefore used as standard labelling method. 6 µL of PCR product were used for labelling
in the primer extension reaction mix, which contained
each 0.9 mM forward primer 27 (16S rRNA) and CanRev
primer (18S rRNA), 1.5 U Vent (exo) polymerase (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, UK), 3 mM MgSO4 and 50 µM
of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 25 µM of dCTP and 25 µM Cy5dCTP. The reaction mix was cycled 25× at 95°C 60°C and
72°C each 20 sec followed by a final extension step for 5
min at 72°C. Temperature cycles were preceded by 3 min
incubation at 95°C.
Hybridisation
Prior to hybridisation the microarray slides were pretreated with blocking buffer (cyanoborohydride buffer:
20 mM Na2H PO4, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 50
mM NaBH3CN) at room temperature for 30 minutes in
order to inactivate reactive groups on the slide surface.

The hybridisation mixture had a final volume of 30.3 µL.
It contained 24 µL of the labelled DNA reaction mixture
and was adjusted using 20× SSC and 10% SDS to a final
concentration of 4× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The suspension
was denaturated at 95°C for 5 minutes and finally a
hybridisation control (BSrev: 5' end Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide sequence: AAG CTC ACT GGC CGT CGT TTT
AAA) was added to a final concentration of 0.15 nM. A
total volume of 22 µL was transferred to a cover slip (22 ×
22 mm) and subsequently applied to the microarray surface. Hybridisation was realised at 65°C in a vapour saturated chamber for 1 h. Slides were washed in 2× SSC and
0.1 % SDS for 5 minutes followed by 0.2 × SSC for 2 minutes and 0.1× SSC for 1 minute. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 900 g for 2 minutes.
Signal detection and data analysis
Slides were scanned at a resolution of 10 µm with an Axon
Genepix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon, Union City,
California) at equal laser power and sensitivity level of the
photomultiplier (650 pmt) for each slide. Therefore absolute and relative signal intensities presented for independent experiments are directly comparable. Obtained
images were analyzed using the Genepix software and the
resulting gpr-files were used for further analysis.
Statistical evaluation
Data analysis was done in R [64] using the packages
limma, affy, stats and class. Datasets consisted of 241
hybridisations done on 3 different layouts of the pathogen identification microarray. The different layouts shared
76 probes; these were used in the analysis. All other
probes were disregarded. Each pathogen was represented
by 2–5 different probes with different sequences. To
increase robustness, probes were spotted 6 times on the
array.

Each hybridisation was represented by one gpr file, all of
which were collectively stored as RGList objects in R. Signals were normalised using quantile normalisation from
the affy package. Medians of the 6 spot-replicates were
used for supervised k-Nearest neighbour (k = 1) classification method. The classifier was validated in a leave-oneout cross-validation approach.

Authors' contributions
CN was responsible for organisation and concept development. LB contributed to probe design and method construction. EP and AMH supplied practical clinical support.
AK supported statistical evaluation of microarray data
together with KV who developed the microarray pattern
recognition approach. RP and HWM were responsible for
design of experiments, evaluation of results and method
development. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.
