Conclusions: Phylogenetically diverse δ-proteobacteria appear to have homologous regulatory
components. This study for the first time demonstrates the adaptability of the comparative
genomic approach to de novo reconstruction of a regulatory network in a poorly studied taxonomic
group of bacteria. Recent efforts in large-scale functional genomic characterization of Desulfovibrio
species will provide a unique opportunity to test and expand our predictions.

Results: In the genomes of δ-proteobacteria, we identified candidate binding sites for four
regulators of known specificity (BirA, CooA, HrcA, sigma-32), four types of metabolite-binding
riboswitches (RFN-, THI-, B12-elements and S-box), and new binding sites for the FUR, ModE, NikR,
PerR, and ZUR transcription factors, as well as for the previously uncharacterized factors HcpR
and LysX. After reconstruction of the corresponding metabolic pathways and regulatory
interactions, we identified possible functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized
genes covering a wide range of cellular functions.

Background: Relatively little is known about the genetic basis for the unique physiology of metalreducing genera in the delta subgroup of the proteobacteria. The recent availability of complete
finished or draft-quality genome sequences for seven representatives allowed us to investigate the
genetic and regulatory factors in a number of key pathways involved in the biosynthesis of building
blocks and cofactors, metal-ion homeostasis, stress response, and energy metabolism using a
combination of regulatory sequence detection and analysis of genomic context.

Reconstruction of regulatory and metabolic pathways in
metal-reducing δ-proteobacteria

R90.2 Genome Biology 2004,

Volume 5, Issue 11, Article R90

Rodionov et al.

Within this group, sulfate-reducing bacteria, including Desulfovibrio and Desulfotalea species, are metabolically and ecologically versatile prokaryotes often characterized by their
ability to reduce sulfate to sulfide [2]. They can be found in
aquatic habitats or waterlogged soils containing abundant
organic material and sufficient levels of sulfate, and play a key
role in the global sulfur and carbon cycles [1]. Industrial interest in sulfate reducers has focused on their role in corrosion
of metal equipment and the souring of petroleum reservoirs,
while their ability to reduce toxic heavy metals has drawn
attention from researchers interested in exploiting this ability
for bioremediation. Psychrophilic sulfate-reducing Desulfotalea psychrophila has been isolated from permanently cold
arctic marine sediments [3]. In contrast to sulfate-reducing
bacteria, the genera Geobacter and Desulfuromonas comprise dissimilative metal-reducing bacteria, which cannot
reduce sulfate, but include representatives that require sulfur
as a respiratory electron acceptor for oxidation of acetate to
carbon dioxide [4]. These bacteria are an important component of the subsurface biota that oxidizes organic compounds,
hydrogen or sulfur with the reduction of insoluble Fe(III)
oxides [5], and have also been implicated in corrosion and
toxic metal reduction.
Knowledge of transcriptional regulatory networks is essential
for understanding cellular processes in bacteria. However,
experimental data about regulation of gene expression in δproteobacteria are very limited. Different approaches could
be used for identification of co-regulated genes (regulons).
Transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays allows one
to compare the expression levels of thousands of genes in different experimental conditions, and is a valuable tool for dissecting bacterial adaptation to various environments.
Computational approaches, on the other hand, provide an
opportunity to describe regulons in poorly characterized
genomes. Comparison of upstream sequences of genes can, in
principle, identify co-regulated genes. From large-scale studies [6-9] and analyses of individual regulatory systems [1014] it is clear that the comparative analysis of binding sites for
transcriptional regulators is a powerful approach to the functional annotation of bacterial genomes. Additional techniques used in genome context analysis, such as
chromosomal gene clustering, protein fusions and co-occurrence profiles, in combination with metabolic reconstruction,
allow the inference of functional coupling between genes and
the prediction of gene function [15].
Recent completion of finished and draft quality genome
sequences for δ-proteobacteria provides an opportunity for
comparative analysis of transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways in these bacteria. The finished genomes
include sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio vulgaris [16], D. desulfuricans G20, and Desulfotalea psychrophila, as well as the
sulfur-reducing G. sulfurreducens [17], while the G. metallireducens genome has been completed to draft quality. A
mixture of Desulfuromonas acetoxidans and Desulfurom-

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R90

onas palmitatis has been sequenced, resulting in a large
number of small scaffolds, the identity of which (acetoxidans
or palmitatis) has not been determined, and we refer to this
sequence set simply as Desulfuromonas. Though draft-quality sequence can make it difficult to assert with confidence the
absence of any particular gene, we have included these
genomes in our study because they do provide insight as to
the presence or absence of entire pathways, they can be compared to the related finished genome of G. sulfurreducens,
and because complete genome sequence is not necessary for
the methodology we use to detect regulatory sequences.
In this comprehensive study, we identify a large number of
regulatory elements in these δ-proteobacteria. Some of the
corresponding regulons are highly conserved among various
bacteria (for example, riboswitches, BirA, CIRCE), whereas
others are specific only for δ-proteobacteria. We also present
the reconstruction of a number of biosynthetic pathways and
systems for metal-ion homeostasis and stress response in
these bacteria. The most important result of this study is
identification of a novel regulon involved in sulfate reduction
and energy metabolism in sulfate-reducing bacteria, which is
most probably controlled by a regulator from the CRP/FNR
family.

Results

The results are organized under four main headings for convenience. In the first, we analyze a number of specific regulons for biosynthesis of various amino acids and cofactors in
δ-proteobacteria. Most of them are controlled by RNA regulatory elements, or riboswitches, that are highly conserved
across bacteria [18]. In the next section we describe several
regulons for the uptake and homeostasis of transition metal
ions that are necessary for growth. These regulons operate by
transcription factors that are homologous to factors in
Escherichia coli, but are predicted to recognize entirely different DNA signals. We then describe two stress-response
regulons: heat-shock regulons (σ32 and HrcA/CIRCE), which
operate by regulatory elements conserved in diverse bacteria,
and newly identified peroxide stress response regulons that
are quite diverse and conserved only in closely related species. Finally, we present a completely new global regulon in
metal-reducing δ-proteobacteria, which includes various
genes involved in energy metabolism and sulfate reduction.

Biosynthesis and transport of vitamins and amino acids
Biotin
Biotin (vitamin H) is an essential cofactor for numerous
biotin-dependent carboxylases in a variety of microorganisms [19]. The strict control of biotin biosynthesis is mediated
by the bifunctional BirA protein, which acts both as a biotinprotein ligase and a transcriptional repressor of the biotin
operon. The consensus binding signal of BirA is a palindromic
sequence TTGTAAACC-[N14/15]-GGTTTACAA [20]. Consistent with the presence of the biotin repressor BirA, all bacteria

BirA site is located between the divergently transcribed biotin
operon and the birA gene. In other genomes, candidate binding sites for BirA precede one or two separate biotin biosynthetic loci, whereas the birA gene stands apart and is not

refereed research

GS,GM

All δ-proteobacteria studied possess genes for de novo biotin
synthesis from pimeloyl-CoA precursor (bioF, bioA, bioD,
bioB) and the bifunctional gene birA, but the initial steps of
the biotin pathway are variable in these species (Figure 1).
The Geobacter species have the bioC-bioH gene pair, which is
required for the synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA in Escherichia
coli. The Desulfuromonas species contain both bioC-bioH
and bioW genes, representing two different pathways of
pimeloyl-CoA synthesis. In contrast, D. psychrophila is predicted to synthesize a biotin precursor using the bioC-bioG
gene pair, where the latter gene was only recently predicted to
belong to the biotin pathway [20]. Both Desulfovibrio species
have an extended biotin operon with five new genes related to
the fatty-acid biosynthetic pathway. Among these new biotinregulated genes not present in other δ-proteobacteria studied, there are homologs of acyl carrier protein (ACP), 3-oxoacyl-(ACP) synthase, 3-oxoacyl-(ACP) reductase and
hydroxymyristol-(ACP) dehydratase. From positional and
regulatory characteristics we conclude that these genes are
functionally related to the biotin pathway. The most plausible
hypothesis is that they encode a novel pathway for pimeloylCoA synthesis, as the known genes for this pathway, bioC,
bioH, bioG and bioW, are missing in the Desulfovibrio species.

Riboflavin
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is an essential component of basic
metabolism, being a precursor to the coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
The only known mechanism of regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis is mediated by a conserved RNA structure, the
RFN-element, which is widely distributed in diverse bacterial
species [21]. The δ-proteobacteria in this study possess a conserved gene cluster containing all genes required for the de
novo synthesis of riboflavin (ribD-ribE-ribBA-ribH), but lack
this regulatory element. The only exception is D. psychrophila, which has an additional gene for 3,4-dihydroxy-2butanone-4-phosphate synthase (ribB2) with an upstream
regulatory RFN element.

Thiamine
Vitamin B1 in its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, is an
essential coenzyme synthesized by the coupling of pyrimidine
(HMP) and thiazole (HET) moieties in bacteria. The only
known mechanism of regulation of thiamine biosynthesis in
bacteria is mediated by a conserved RNA structure, the THIelement [22]. Search for thiamine-specific regulatory elements in the genomes of δ-proteobacteria identified one or
two THI-elements per genome that are located upstream of
thiamine biosynthetic operons (Figure 1 in Additional data
file 1). The δ-proteobacteria possess all the genes required for
the de novo synthesis of thiamine (Figure 2) with the exception of Geobacter species, which lack some genes for the synthesis and salvage of the HET moiety (thiF, thiH and thiM),
and D. psychrophila, which has no thiF. In most δ-proteobacteria there are two paralogs of the thiamine phosphate synthase thiE, and Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species have
fused genes thiED. In D. psychrophila, the only THI-regulated operon includes HET kinase thiM and previously predicted HMP transporter thiXYZ [22], whereas other thiamine
biosynthetic genes are not regulated by the THI-element
(Figure 2).

In most cases, downstream of a THI-element there is a candidate terminator hairpin, yielding regulation by the transcription termination/antitermination mechanism. The two
exceptions predicted to be involved in translational attenuation are THI-elements upstream of genes thiED in Desulfuromonas and thiM in D. psychrophila. In the Desulfovibrio
species, the thiSGHFE operon is preceded by two tandem
THI-elements, each followed by a transcriptional terminator.
This is the first example of possible gene regulation by tandem riboswitches.

Cobalamin
Adenosylcobalamin (Ado-CBL), a derivative of vitamin B12, is
an essential cofactor for several important enzymes. The
studied genomes of δ-proteobacteria possess nearly complete
sets of genes required for the de novo synthesis of Ado-CBL
(Figure 3). The only exception is the precorrin-6x reductase,
cbiJ, which was found only in Desulfuromonas but not in
other species. The occurrence of CbiD/CbiG enzymes instead
of the oxygen-dependent CobG/CobF ones suggests that
these bacteria, consistent with their anaerobic lifestyle, use
the anaerobic pathway for B12 synthesis similar to that used
by Salmonella typhimurium [23].
Ado-CBL is known to repress expression of genes for vitamin
B12 biosynthesis and transport via a co- or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, which involves direct binding
of Ado-CBL to the riboswitch called the B12-element [24,25].
A search for B12-elements in the genomes of δ-proteobacteria
produced one B12-element in D. desulfuricans, D. psychrophila and G. metallireducens, two in D. vulgaris and G.
sulfurreducens, and four in Desulfuromonas (Figure 2 in
Additional data file 1). In Geobacter species these riboswitches regulate a large locus containing almost all the genes
for the synthesis of Ado-CBL (Figure 3). One B12-element in
the Desulfovibrio species regulates both the cobalamin-synthesis genes cbiK-cbiL and the vitamin B12 transport system

Methionine

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R90

information

The sulfur-containing amino acid methionine and its derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are important in protein
synthesis and cellular metabolism. There are two alternative
pathways for methionine synthesis in microorganisms, which
differ in the source of sulfur. The trans-sulfuration pathway
(metI-metC) utilizes cysteine, whereas the direct sulfhydrylation pathway (metY) uses inorganic sulfur instead. All δ-proteobacteria in this study except the Desulfovibrio species
possess a complete set of genes required for the de novo syn-

In Gram-positive bacteria, SAM is known to repress expression of genes for methionine biosynthesis and transport via
direct binding to the S-box riboswitch [28]. In contrast,
Gram-negative enterobacteria control methionine metabolism using the SAM-responsive transcriptional repressor
MetJ. The δ-proteobacteria in this study have no orthologs of
MetJ, but instead, we identified S-box regulatory elements
upstream of the metIC and metX genes in the genomes of the
Geobacter species and Desulfuromonas (see Figure 3 in
Additional data file 1). A strong hairpin with a poly(T) region
follows all these S-boxes, implying involvement of these Sboxes in a transcriptional termination/antitermination
mechanism.

interactions

The most interesting observation is that genes encoding the
B12-independent ribonucleotide reductase NrdDG are preceded by B12-elements in D. vulgaris and Desulfuromonas.
Notably, all δ-proteobacteria have another type of ribonucleotide reductase, NrdJ, which is a vitamin B12-dependent
enzyme. We propose that when vitamin B12 is present in the
cell, expression of the B12-independent isozyme is inhibited,
and a relatively more efficient B12-dependent isozyme is used.
This phenomenon has been previously observed in other bacterial genomes [26].

thesis of methionine (Figure 4). The Geobacter species and
possibly Desulfuromonas have some redundancy in the pathway. First, these genomes contain the genes for both alternative pathways of the methionine synthesis. Second, they
possess two different SAM synthase isozymes, classical bacterial-type MetK and an additional archaeal-type enzyme [27].
Moreover, it should be noted that the B12-dependent methionine synthase MetH in these bacteria lacks the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in reactivation of
spontaneously oxidized coenzyme B12.

(dapC, dapE and dapD), which vary in bacteria using different meso-DAP synthesis pathways. The lysine synthesis genes
are mostly scattered along the chromosome, and in only some
cases are dapA and either dapB, dapF or lysA clustered. All δproteobacteria studied lack the previously known lysine
transporter LysP. However, in D. desulfuricans and D. psychrophila we found a gene for another candidate lysine transporter, named lysW, which was predicted in our previous
genomic survey [29].

The amino acid lysine is produced from aspartate through the
diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway in most bacteria. The first
two stages of the DAP pathway, catalyzed by aspartokinase
and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, are common for
the biosynthesis of lysine, threonine, and methionine. The
corresponding genes were found in δ-proteobacteria where
they form parts of different metabolic operons. Four genes for
the conserved stages of the lysine synthesis pathway (dapA,

In various bacterial species, lysine is known to repress expression of genes for lysine biosynthesis and transport via the Lbox riboswitch [30]. In addition, Gram-negative enterobacteria use the lysine-responsive transcriptional factor LysR for
control of the lysA gene. Among the δ-proteobacteria studied,
we found neither orthologs of LysR, nor representatives of the
L-box RNA regulatory element. In an attempt to analyze

Both Desulfovibrio species have genes involved in the conversion of homocysteine into methionine (metE, metH and
metF), which could be involved in the SAM recycling pathway, but not those genes required for de novo methionine biosynthesis. The ABC-type methionine transport system
(metNIQ), which is widely distributed among bacteria, was
also not found in these δ-proteobacteria. The Desulfovibrio
species appear to have the single-component methionine
transporter metT [28].

potential lysine regulons in this phylogenetic group, we collected upstream regions of all lysine biosythesis genes and
applied SignalX as a signal detection procedure [31]. The
strongest signal, a 20-bp palindrome with consensus GTGGTACTNNNNAGTACCAC, was observed upstream of the lysXlysA operons in both Desulfovibrio genomes and the candidate lysine transporter gene lysW in D. desulfuricans (Table
2). The first gene in this operon, named lysX, encodes a hypothetical transcriptional regulator with a helix-turn-helix
motif (COG1378) and is the most likely candidate for the
lysine-specific regulator role in Desulfovibrio. To find new
members of the regulon, the derived profile (named LYS-box)
was used to scan the Desulfovibrio genomes. The lysine regulon in these genomes appears to include an additional gene
(206613 in D. vulgaris, and 394397 in D. desulfuricans),
which encodes an uncharacterized membrane protein with 14
predicted transmembrane segments. We predict that this new
member of the lysine regulon might be involved in the uptake
of lysine or some lysine precursor.

Metal ion homeostasis
Iron
Iron is necessary for the growth of most bacteria as it participates in many major biological processes [32]. In aerobic
environments, iron is mainly insoluble, and microorganisms
acquire it by secretion and active transport of high-affinity
Fe(III) chelators. Under anaerobic conditions, Fe(II) predominates over ferric iron, and can be transported by the
ATP-dependent ferrous iron transport system FeoAB.
Genomes of anaerobic δ-proteobacteria contain multiple copies of the feoAB genes, and lack ABC transporters for
siderophores. Regulation of iron metabolism in bacteria is
mediated by the ferric-uptake regulator protein (FUR), which
represses transcription upon interaction with ferrous ions.

FUR can be divided into two domains, an amino-terminal
DNA-binding domain and a carboxy-terminal Fe(II)-binding
domain. The consensus binding site of E. coli FUR is a palindromic sequence GATAATGATNATCATTATC [33].
In all δ-proteobacteria studied except D. psychrophila, we
identified one to three FUR orthologs that form a distinct
branch (FUR_Delta) in the phylogenetic tree of the FUR/
ZUR/PerR protein family (see below). One protein, FUR2 in
D. desulfuricans, lacks an amino-terminal DNA-binding
domain and is either non-functional or is involved in indirect
regulation by forming inactive heterodimers with two other
FUR proteins. Scanning the genomes with the FUR-box profile of E. coli did not result in identification of candidate FURboxes in δ-proteobacteria. In an attempt to analyze potential
iron regulons in this phylogenetic group, we collected
upstream regions of the iron-transporter genes feoAB and
applied SignalX to detect regulatory signals. The strongest
signal, a 17-bp palindrome with consensus WTGAAAATNATTTTCAW (where W indicates A or T), was observed
upstream of the multiple feoAB operons and fur genes in all
δ-proteobacteria except D. psychrophila (Table 3). The constructed search profile (dFUR-box) was applied to detect new
candidate FUR-binding sites in these five genomes (Figure 5
and Table 3).
The smallest FUR regulons were observed in the Geobacter
and Desulfuromonas species, where they include the ferrous
iron transporters feoAB (one to four copies per genome), the
fur genes themselves (one copy in the Geobacter species and
two copies in Desulfuromonas), and two hypothetical porins.
The first one, named psp, was found only in G. metallireducens and Desulfuromonas genomes, where it is preceded by
two tandem FUR-boxes. The psp gene has homologs only in

immediately upstream of the feoAB-containing operon. The
first gene in this operon, named genX (383594), has no
orthologs in other bacteria and the encoded protein has a
heme-binding site signature of the cytochrome c family
(PFAM: PF00034). The second gene, named genY (383592),
encodes a two-domain protein that is not similar to any
known protein. In Desulfuromonas, an ortholog of the genY
amino-terminal domain (391875) is divergently transcribed
from a predicted ferric reductase (391874), and their common upstream region contains a strong FUR-box. Moreover,
orthologs of the genY C-terminal domain were identified in
Desulfovibrio species, where they are again preceded by two
tandem FUR-boxes and form a cluster with the hypothetical
gene, genZ, encoding a protein of 100 amino acids with two
tetratricopeptide repeat domains that are usually involved in
protein-protein interactions (PFAM: PF00515). From
genomic analysis alone it is difficult to predict possible functions of these new members of the FUR regulon in δ-proteobacteria.
Two Desulfovibrio species have significantly extended FUR
regulons that are largely conserved in these genomes and
include ferrous iron transporter genes feoAB and many hypothetical genes. Another distinctive feature of the FUR regulon
in Desulfovibrio species is a structure of two partially overlapping FUR-boxes shifted by 6 bp. Interestingly, the flavodoxin gene, fld, is predicted to be regulated by FUR in both
Desulfovibrio species. In addition to this iron-repressed flavodoxin (a flavin-containing electron carrier), the Desulfovibrio species have numerous ferredoxins (an iron-sulfurcontaining electron carrier). One possible explanation is that
in iron-restricted conditions these microorganisms can
replace ferredoxins with less-efficient, but iron-independent
alternatives. A similar regulatory strategy has been previously
described for superoxide dismutases in E. coli, Bordetella
pertusis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [34-36] and predicted, in a different metabolic context, for B12-dependent
and B12-independent enzymes [26]; see the discussion above.
Other predicted regulon members with conserved FUR-boxes
in both Desulfovibrio species are the hypothetical genes pep
(Zn-dependent peptidase), gdp (GGDEF domain protein,
PF00990), hdd (metal dependent HD-domain protein,
PF01966), and a hypothetical P-type ATPase (392971) that
could be involved in cation transport, and a long gene cluster
starting from the pqqL gene (Zn-dependent peptidase). The
latter cluster contains at least 10 hypothetical genes encoding
components of ABC transporters and biopolymer transport
proteins (exbB, exbD and tonB). In D. vulgaris, the first gene
in this FUR-regulated cluster is an AraC-type regulator
named foxR, since it is homologous to numerous FUR-controlled regulators from other genomes (foxR from Salmonella
typhi, alcR from Bordetella pertussis, ybtA from Yersinia
species, pchR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which usually
regulate iron-siderophore biosynthesis/transport operons
[33]. An ortholog of foxR, a single FUR-regulated gene, was

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R90

identified in D. desulfuricans located about 30 kb away from
the FUR-regulated pqqL gene cluster. Given these observations, we propose that this gene cluster is involved in
siderophore transport and is regulated by FoxR.
A hypothetical gene in D. vulgaris (209207) has the strongest
FUR-box in this genome; however, its orthologs in D. desulfuricans are not predicted to belong to the FUR regulon.
Another operon in D. desulfuricans (392971-392970392969), encoding three hypothetical proteins, is preceded
by two candidate FUR-boxes, but these genes have no
orthologs in other δ-proteobacteria. Thus, FUR-dependent
regulation of these hypothetical genes is not confirmed in
other species, and their possible role in the iron homeostasis
is not clear.

Nickel
The transition metal nickel (Ni) is an essential cofactor for a
number of prokaryotic enzymes, such as [NiFe]-hydrogenase,
urease, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Two
major types of nickel-specific bacterial transporters are
represented by the NikABCD system of E. coli (the nickel/
peptide ABC transporter family) and the HoxN of Ralstonia
eutropha (the NiCoT family of nickel/cobalt permeases).
Nickel uptake must be tightly regulated because excessive
nickel is toxic. In E. coli and some other proteobacteria, nickel
concentrations are controlled by transcriptional repression of
the nikABCD operon by the Ni-dependent regulator NikR
[37].
The genomes of δ-proteobacteria studied so far contain multiple operons encoding [NiFe] and [Fe] hydrogenases and Nidependent CODH, but lack urease genes. Both known types of
nickel-specific transporters are absent in δ-proteobacteria,
but these genomes contain orthologs of the nickel repressor
nikR. In an attempt to identify potential nickel transporters in
this taxonomic group, we analyzed the genome context of the
nikR genes. The nikR gene in Desulfuromonas is co-localized
with a hypothetical ABC transport system, which is weakly
homologous to the cobalt ABC-transporter cbiMNQO from
various bacteria. Orthologs of this system, named here nikMNQO, are often localized in proximity to Ni-dependent hydrogenase or urease gene clusters in various proteobacteria (data
not shown). Among δ-proteobacteria, the Geobacter species
have a complete nikMNQO operon, whereas operons in D.
desulfuricans and D. psychrophila lack the nikN component
but include two additional genes, named nikK and nikL,
which both encode hypothetical proteins with amino-terminal transmembrane segments (Figure 6). Desulfovibrio vulgaris has a nikMQO cluster and separately located nikK and
nikL genes. Since various other proteobacteria also have the
same clusters including nikK and nikL, but not nikN (data not
shown), we propose that these two genes encode additional
periplasmic components of the NikMQO ABC transporter,
possibly involved in the nickel binding.

By applying SignalX to a set of upstream regions of the nikMQO operons, we identified de novo the NikR binding signal
in all δ-proteobacteria except D. psychrophila (Table 4). This
signal has the same structure as in enterobacteria (an
inverted repeat of 27-28 bp), but its consensus (GTGTTAC[N13/14]-GTAACAC) differs significantly from the consensus
of NikR binding signal of enterobacteria (GTATGAT-[N13/14]ATCATAC) [37]. Using the derived profile to scan the
genomes of δ-proteobacteria we identified one more candidate NikR-binding site in D. desulfuricans. Thus the nickel
regulon in this bacterium includes the hydAB2 operon,
encoding periplasmic iron-only hydrogenase. Altogether, D.
desulfuricas has three paralogs of [NiFe] hydrogenase and
two paralogs of [Fe] hydrogenase. We predict that an excess
of nickel represses a nickel-independent hydrogenase isozyme using the Ni-responsive repressor NikR. Regulation of
hydrogenase enzymes by NikR has not been described previously. A closer look at the upstream region of the putative
nickel transport operon in D. psychrophila revealed similar
NikR consensus half-sites but in the opposite orientation to
each other (GTAACAC-[N13/14]-GTGTTAC). Searching the
genomes with this reversed NikR signal, we observed one
more hypothetical gene cluster in D. psychrophila which has
two high-scoring NikR-sites in the upstream region, and a

Zinc
Zinc is an important component of many proteins, but in
large concentrations it is toxic to the cell. Thus zinc repressors
ZUR regulate high-affinity zinc transporters znuABC in
various bacteria [38]. An orthologous zinc transporter was
found in δ-proteobacteria (Figure 7). In G. sulfurreducens
and the Desulfovibrio species, this cluster also includes a
hypothetical regulatory gene from the FUR/ZUR/PerR family, named zur_Gs and zur_D, respectively. Phylogenetic
analysis of this protein family demonstrated that ZUR_Gs
and ZUR_D are not close relatives and are only weakly similar to known FUR, ZUR, and PerR regulators from other bacteria (see below). The predicted ZUR-binding site located just
upstream of the zur-znuABC operon in G. sulfurreducens is

The previously described cobalt transport system CbiMNQO
was found only in the Geobacter species, where it is located
within the B12-regulated cbi gene cluster close to the cobaltochelatase gene cbiX, responsible for incorporation of cobalt
ions into the corrin ring (see the 'Cobalamin' section above).
In contrast, other δ-proteobacteria, possessing a different
cobaltochelatase (cbiK), lack homologs of any known cobalt
transporter. It was previously suggested by global analysis of
the B12 metabolism that different types of cobalt transporters
are interchangeable in various bacterial species [26]. From
genome context analysis and positional clustering with the
cbiK gene, we predicted a novel candidate cobalt transporter
in δ-proteobacteria, named cbtX (Figure 3), which was previously annotated as a hypothetical transmembrane protein
conserved only in some species of archaea (COG3366).

Molybdenum
Molybdenum (Mo) is another transition metal essential for
bacterial metabolism. Bacteria take up molybdate ions via a
specific ABC transport system encoded by modABC genes.
Mo homeostasis is regulated by the molybdate-responsive
transcription factor ModE, containing an amino-terminal
DNA-binding domain and two tandem molybdate-binding
domains. Orthologs of ModE are widespread among prokaryotes, but not ubiquitous [39]. All δ-proteobacteria have one
or more homologs of the modABC transporter (Figure 8).

However, full-length modE genes containing both DNA- and
molybdate-binding domains were observed only in G. sulfurreducens and Desulfuromonas. In G. sulfurreducens, the
molybdate transport operon is co-localized with modE and is
preceded by a putative ModE-binding site (Table 6), which is
similar to the E. coli consensus of ModE (ATCGNTATATA[N6]-TATATANCGAT). In contrast, we could not identify E.
coli-type ModE-binding sites upstream of the mod operons in
Desulfuromonas, indicating that these operons may be regulated by a different, unidentified signal.
Three other δ-proteobacteria (two Desulfovibrio species and
D. psychrophila) have genes encoding a single DNA-binding
domain of ModE (Figure 8). Searching with the E. coli-type
profile did not reveal candidate binding sites of ModE in these
species. To predict potential ModE sites de novo, we collected
upstream regions of all molybdate transport operons and
applied SignalX. In both Desulfovibrio genomes, we identified a common inverted repeat with consensus CGGTCACG[N14]-CGTGACCG, which is considerably different from the
E. coli consensus of ModE (Table 6 and Figure 8). The
modABC gene cluster in these species includes an additional
chimeric gene encoding a fusion of phage integrase family
domain (PF00589) and one or two molybdate-binding
domains (MOP). The functions of these chimeric molybdatebinding proteins, and the mechanism of Mo-sensing by DNAbinding ModE domains in the Desulfovibrio species, are not
clear.

Stress response regulons
Oxidative stress
Under aerobic conditions, generation of highly toxic and
reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, hydrogen
peroxide and the hydroxyl radical leads to oxidative stress
with deleterious effects [40]. Strictly anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria are adapted to survive in transient oxygen-containing environments by intracellular reduction of oxygen to
water using rubredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (Roo) as the
terminal oxidase [41]. The main detoxification system for
reactive oxygen species in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria
involves superoxide dismutase (Sod), catalase (KatA, KatG)
and nonspecific peroxidases (for example, AhpC). In addition
to these enzymes, Desulfovibrio species have an alternative
mechanism for protecting against oxidative stress, which
includes rubredoxin oxidoreductase (Rbo), which has superoxide reductase activity, rubrerythrin (Rbr) with NADH
peroxidase activity, and rubredoxin-like proteins (Rub, Rdl),
which are used as common intermediary electron donors
[42].
Searching for orthologs of the oxidative stress-related genes
in the genomes in this study revealed great variability in content and genomic organization (Figure 9). We also searched
for homologs of transcription factors known to be involved in
regulation of the peroxide and superoxide stress responses.
Lacking orthologs of the E. coli OxyR and SoxR/SoxS regula-

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R90

tors, the δ-proteobacteria studied have instead multiple
homologs of the peroxide-sensing regulator PerR of B. subtilis [43]. The PerR-specific branch on the phylogenetic tree of
the FUR/ZUR/PerR family contains at least three distinct
sub-branches with representatives from δ-proteobacteria
(Figure 10). In all cases except D. psychrophila, the perR
genes are co-localized on the chromosome with various peroxide stress-responsive genes (Figure 9). However, the
upstream regions of these genes contain no candidate PerRbinding sites conforming to the B. subtilis PerR consensus
TTATAATNATTATAA. Applying the SignalX program to
various subsets of upstream regions of peroxide stressresponsive genes resulted in identification of candidate PerR
operators in δ-proteobacteria (Table 7).
In the Desulfovibrio species, a common palindromic signal
was found upstream of the perR and rbr2 genes. In D. vulgaris, perR forms an operon with rbr and rdl genes [42].
Searching for genes with the derived profile identified additional candidate members of the PerR regulon, alkyl
hydroperoxide reductase ahpC in D. vulgaris (D. desulfuricans has no ortholog of ahpC), and a hypothetical gene of
unknown function in both Desulfovibrio species (206199 in
D. vulgaris and 395549 in D. desulfuricans).
The perR-rbr-roo operon in both Geobacter species is preceded by a conserved palindromic region (Table 7) which
overlaps a candidate -10 promoter element (Figure 11). The
second perR paralog in G. sulfurreducens (named perR2),
which is followed by a gene cluster containing two cytochrome peroxidase homologs (hsc and ccpA), glutaredoxin
(grx) and rubrerythrin (rbr), has a close ortholog in the Desulfuromonas species, where it precedes the rbr gene (Figures
9, 10). For these gene clusters we found a common
palindromic signal, which is not similar to other predicted
PerR signals in δ-proteobacteria (Table 7). Two other perR
paralogs in Desulfuromonas (perR2 and perR3) probably
result from a recent gene duplication (Figure 10), and both
are co-localized on the chromosome with the peroxide stressresponsive genes katG and rbr2, respectively (Figure 9). A
common new signal identified upstream of the katG and
perR3 genes is probably recognized by both PerR2 and PerR3
regulators in this organism (Table 7).
The PerR regulons in δ-proteobacteria are predicted to
include only a small subset of all peroxide stress-related genes
identified in these genomes. In addition to the mainly local
character of the predicted regulation, these regulons seem to
be highly variable between different species, both in their
content and DNA signals.

heat-shock proteins are positive control by alternative sigma
factor σ32, encoded by the rpoH gene, and negative control by
binding of the repressor protein HrcA to palindromic opera-

Sulfate-reducing bacteria are characterized by their ability to
utilize sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor. To try to
identify the regulatory signals responsible for this
metabolism, we applied the signal detection procedure SignalX to a set of upstream regions of genes involved in the sulfate-reduction pathway in Desulfovibrio species. A conserved
palindromic signal with consensus sequence TTGTGANNNNNNTCACAA was detected upstream of the sat and
apsAB operons, which encode ATP sulfurylase and APS
reductase, respectively. This novel signal is identical to the E.
coli CRP consensus, and we hypothesized that a CRP-like regulator might control the sulfate-reduction regulon in Desulfovibrio. Scanning the Desulfovibrio genomes resulted in
identification of similar sites upstream of many hypothetical
genes encoding various enzymes and regulatory systems
(Table 10b and Figure 12). One of them, the hcp gene in D.
vulgaris, encodes a hybrid-cluster protein (previously called
the prismane-containing protein) of unknown function [49],
which is coexpressed with a hypothetical ferredoxin gene,

We then searched the genomes of δ-proteobacteria with previously constructed profiles for σ32 promoters and CIRCE
[45]. As was observed previously for other bacteria, the only
constant member of the HrcA regulon in δ-proteobacteria is
the groESL operon. In addition, CIRCE sites are present
upstream of the hrcA-grpE-dnaKJ operons in the Geobacter
and Desulfuromonas species and upstream of the rpoH gene
in G. sulfurreducens. In contrast to the highly conserved
CIRCE signal, the σ32 promoters identified in multiple copies
in various proteobacteria are less conserved [45,46]. Among
δ-proteobacteria, we identified σ32-like promoters upstream
of some heat-shock-related genes encoding chaperons (GroE,
DnaJ, DnaK, GrpE) and proteases (ClpA, ClpP, ClpX, Lon)
(Table 9). Thus, in δ-proteobacteria, as in most proteobacteria, σ32 plays a central part in the regulation of the heat-shock
response, although detailed regulatory strategies seem to vary
in different species. The alternative HrcA/CIRCE system controls expression of groE and other major chaperons.

associated hydrogenase - which are encoded in the coo operons and induced by the CO-sensing transcriptional activator
CooA [47]. Among the sequenced δ-proteobacteria, only Desulfovibrio species have coo operons and the CooA regulator.
D. vulgaris has two separate operons encoding CODH and
the associated hydrogenase, whereas D. desulfuricans has
only one operon encoding CODH (Figure 12). The strongest
identified signal, a 16-bp palindrome with consensus TGTCGGCNNGCCGACA, was identified upstream of the coo operons
from both Desulfovibrio species and R. rubrum (Table 10a).
This consensus conforms to the experimentally known CooAbinding region at the R. rubrum cooFSCTJ operon [48].

tors with a consensus TTAGCACTC-[N9]-GAGTGCTAA called
CIRCE [44]. The rpoH gene was identified in the genomes of
all δ-proteobacteria studied. Though the HrcA/CIRCE system
is conserved in very diverse taxonomic groups of bacteria, it is
not universal, as some γ-proteobacteria lack it [45]. We
detected the hrcA genes and CIRCE sites in all genomes studied except D. psychrophila (Table 8).

Examination of a multiple alignment of the CRP/FNR-like

helix-turn-helix motif involved in DNA recognition, which is
changed from arginine (for example, in E. coli CRP and Desulfovibrio HcpR*) to serine and proline in these two δ-proteobacteria (data not shown). As both these species have

in the third position (which has T instead of G). Such candidate sites were observed upstream of all hcp and frdX paralogs identified in D. psychrophila and Desulfuromonas, as
well as upstream of some additional genes in Desulfuromonas, for example those encoding polyferredoxin and cytochrome c heme-binding protein (Table 10 and Figure 12).

refereed research

Because the organisms considered in this study are commonly identified on the basis of their catabolic capabilities,
comparatively little is known about the regulation of their
biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we identified a number
of previously characterized regulatory mechanisms (involved
in biotin, thiamine, cobalamin and methionine synthesis), all
of which, excluding the biotin regulon, are mediated by direct
interaction of a metabolic product with a riboswitch control
element (summarized in Table 11). Of particular interest in
this set was observation of a dual tandem THI-element
riboswitch in Desulfovibrio species. Multiple protein-binding
sites are a common regulatory feature and often imply cooperative binding of multiple protein factors. Although true
riboswitch units do not interact with trans-acting factors, it is
theoretically possible for independently acting sites to yield a
cooperative effect when ligand binding derepresses transcription. For switches that are repressed by ligand binding, however, tandem sites would simply lower the concentration
threshold at which a response is seen, but not affect
cooperativity unless some more complicated interaction of
the sites were allowed. On the one hand, independently acting
sites is a simpler mechanism to explain, while on the other
hand, it seems unusual that duplicate sites would have
evolved to adjust the concentration response instead of simply changing the binding affinity for the ligand at the
sequence level. Moreover, it seems unlikely that a tandem
switch would be preserved across a large evolutionary
distance without offering some other advantage such as cooperativity. It would be interesting to investigate the biochemical behavior of these tandem THI-elements in the laboratory
to resolve whether their genomic organization reflects a more
sophisticated mode of regulation, or is simply an evolutionarily convenient way to adjust the concentration response, or is
perhaps just a recombination remnant that has persisted in
these genomes by chance.

is difficult to predict the effector for this novel regulon. The
physiological role of the hybrid iron-sulfur cluster protein
Hcp, the most conserved member of the HcpR regulon, is not
yet characterized despite its known three-dimensional structure and expression profiling in various organisms. In two
facultative anaerobic bacteria, E. coli and Shewanella oneidensis, the hcp gene is expressed only under anaerobic conditions in the presence of either nitrate or nitrite as terminal
electron acceptors [50,51]. More recent expression data
obtained for anaerobic D. vulgaris have showed strong
upregulation of the hcp-frdX* and 206515-206516 operons
by nitrite stress (J. Zhou, personal communication). While
HcpR is predicted to activate these two hypothetical operons,
as well as the CODH-associated hydrogenase operon, it most
probably represses two enzymes from the sulfate reduction
pathway, APS reductase and ATP sulfurylase. We hypothesize
that HcpR is a key regulator of the energy metabolism in
anaerobic bacteria, possibly controlling the transition
between utilization of alternative electron acceptors, such as
sulfate and nitrate. The absence of the dissimilatory sulfite
reductase DsrAB in the predicted HcpR regulon of Desulfovibrio could be explained by its experimentally defined ability
to reduce both sulfite and nitrite [52].

Discussion
reports

from the two Desulfovibrio species. These two closely related
genomes are diverse enough to identify regulatory elements
as conserved islands in alignments of intergenic regions. For
the sat and apsAB operons, the HcpR sites were found within
highly conserved parts of alignments and in both cases the
site overlaps the -10 box of a site strongly resembling a
promoter (Figure 13a,b), suggesting repression of the genes
by HcpR. In contrast, positive regulation by HcpR could be
proposed for the hcp-frdX, 206515-206516 and 209119 operons, which have HcpR sites upstream or slightly overlapping
the -35 box of predicted promoters (Figure 13c). In the case of
the cooMKLXUHF operon in D. vulgaris, the HcpR site is
located upstream of the candidate site of the known positive
regulator CooA; thus it is also predicted to be an activator site.

Another interesting finding was the absence of complete
machinery for the de novo synthesis of methionine in the Desulfovibrio species. These organisms have the necessary genes
to form methionine from homocysteine, but no apparent
process by which to produce homocysteine. Although the
enzymatic pathway of cysteine synthesis has been studied in
Desulfovibrio vulgaris [53], its ability to synthesize methionine has not been characterized. Growth in minimal medium
using sulfate as the only source of sulfur is routine, however,
and suggests that these bacteria use a previously uncharacterized mechanism for assimilation of sulfur into methionine.
On the basis of genomic context analysis we also predicted
that the Desulfovibrio species contain a novel set of genes
involved in biotin synthesis.

Regulation of metal-ion homeostasis
A number of regulators believed to be involved in metal-ion
homeostasis were identified on the basis of orthology with
known factors from E. coli or B. subtilis. However, in almost
all cases, with the possible exception of ZUR and ModE in G.
sulfurreducens, which appear to have signals similar to the B.
subtilis and E. coli consensus respectively, similarity to

known binding signals was not observed (Table 11). The
presence of similar sets of target genes in the δ-proteobacteria
studied allowed us to apply the signal detection procedure to
elucidate novel regulatory signals, to expand core regulons,
and to observe species-specific differences in regulation.
Interestingly, the FUR/ZUR/PerR family of transcriptional
regulators was found to be ubiquitous in these bacteria and
responsible for a broad range of functions including iron and
zinc homeostasis as well as oxidative stress response. In some
cases, multiple paralogous factors were found, perhaps indicating previously uncharacterized functions for this versatile
gene family.
The large number of iron-containing proteins predicted from
the genome sequence of these organisms, and their ability to
use ferric iron anaerobically as a terminal electron acceptor,
makes iron homeostasis a key target for analysis. A number of
new genes were identified that may belong to the FUR
regulon of these organisms. First, uncharacterized porins
with upstream FUR boxes were identified in the Geobacter
and Desulfuromonas genomes, which we speculate might be
involved in iron transport. Additionally, a two-domain pro-

information

Oxidative stress is one of the most common environmental
stressors for these organisms, especially in the metal-contaminated sites of interest for bioremediation. The bacteria in this
study are unusual in that they contain both the aerobic superoxide dismutase (Sod)/catalase-type oxidative response as
well as the anaerobic Sor/rubrerythrin-type response as pre-

interactions

Stress response

viously noted for D. vulgaris [54]. Analysis of the signal peptides in these proteins indicates that the Sod/catalase system
acts periplasmically, whereas the Sor/rubrerythrin system
acts cytoplasmically [54]. While these organisms have no
homologs of the OxyR or SoxRS regulators known to respond
to changes in oxygen levels in E. coli, they do contain
homologs of the PerR regulator of B. subtilis, known for its
involvement in peroxide stress (Table 11). Clustering of PerR
homologs with oxidative stress genes, as well as their grouping with known Bacillus PerR genes in a phylogenetic analysis
of the FUR/ZUR/PerR family of transcription factors,
allowed the inference that they may, in part, be responsible
for the control of the oxidative stress response of these organisms. Although we did not identify conserved regulatory elements for some known oxidative stress genes such as the
Rbo/Rub/Roo operon in Desulfovibrio species, it has been
observed that the Rub/Roo operon of Desulfovibrio gigas
shows strong constituitive expression from a previously identified σ70 promoter, indicating that additional factors may not
be involved [55].

refereed research

tein with no homologs of known function was identified in all
species except D. psychrophila. In G. sulfurreducens, this
gene occurred downstream of another gene with a cytochrome-type heme-binding motif, while in Desulfuromonas
it was divergently transcribed with a ferric reductase, and was
associated with a tetratricopeptide repeat protein in the Desulfovibrio genomes. In both Desulfovibrio species, we identified an additional regulon, possibly under FoxR control,
which might be involved in siderophore transport. This finding was particularly surprising because we did not identify
any known siderophore biosynthetic pathway. A possible
explanation is that these bacteria use a novel siderophore biosynthesis pathway, or alternatively, take up siderophores
released by other bacteria in the environment.

Rodionov et al.

The heat-shock response of these bacteria was found to be
mediated by two regulons previously described in other
species (Table 11). First, the σ32 regulon was identified, with a
consensus signal similar to that characterized for E. coli. The
second observed regulon was the HrcA/CIRCE regulon
known in B. subtilis and other bacteria, but not present in E.
coli. These two regulons include a partially overlapping set of
genes. Notably, CIRCE elements were identified in all of the
genomes used in this study with the exception of D. psychrophila. It is tempting to speculate that the constant and
cold temperatures encountered by this species in its environmental niche have removed the need for this particular heatshock response.

Similarity of regulatory signals with those in other
bacteria

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R90

cens in iron-limiting conditions confirm our prediction of the
FUR regulon in this genome (R. O'Neil, personal
communication).
It is interesting to observe the extent to which regulatory
motifs are conserved between δ-proteobacteria. Although
riboswitches and some DNA signals (that is, CIRCE, σ32 and
BirA) seem to be conserved across vast spans of evolutionary
time, in many cases we observe divergence in binding signals
even when the core components of a regulon are conserved
(NikR, FUR, PerR, ModE). These findings raise, but do not
answer, questions such as what circumstances cause transcription factor binding specificities to change or remain
conserved, and whether those changes reflect genetic drift, or
active selection to alter the regulatory action of the factor.

Comparison with well studied bacterial model organisms has
shown that δ-proteobacteria share regulatory components
with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms
(Table 11). For example, the use of NikR and ModE for the
regulation of, respectively, nickel and molybdenum uptake
and utilization is consistent with E. coli-like regulation. However, the presence of PerR, CIRCE elements and S-box motifs
is reminiscent of B. subtilis-like regulation. Moreover, in the
case of FUR, although the regulon structure showed overlap
with known downstream targets in model organisms, the
sequence of the FUR box, which is conserved in both E. coli
and B. subtilis, was observed to be different in the metalreducing δ-proteobacteria.

Energy metabolism

We recognize that this is one of the first direct studies comparing entire regulons in δ-proteobacteria. Two recent computational works, considering either a single D. vulgaris or
two Geobacter species, used the AlignACE signal detection
program, which is based on a Gibbs-sampling algorithm, to
derive large sets of conserved DNA motifs without linking
them to specific regulatory systems [56,57]. Unfortunately,
the predicted regulatory signals based on single genomes
turned out not to be conserved across genomes, and could not
be used for functional gene annotation. In this comparative
work, we tried to extensively describe a set of biologically
reasonable regulons in δ-proteobacteria. The regulatory sites
predicted here were not detected in the other two computational studies by Hemme and Wall and by Yan et al. [56,57].
Previously published experimental studies of sulfate-reducing δ-proteobacteria have focused mostly on the biochemistry
unique to these organisms, and little is known about the regulation of gene expression. In part, this has been due to
difficulties in genetically manipulating these strictly anaerobic bacteria. Recent advances in microarray technologies provide genome-scale expression data for D. vulgaris under
various conditions. In support of our findings, all operons
predicted to be co-regulated by the peroxide-responsive
regulator PerR in D. vulgaris are significantly downregulated
by oxygen stress (J. Zhou, personal communication). Furthermore, recent microarray data obtained for G. sulfurredu-

Consistent with this hypothesis, we predicted positive regulation of Hcp and the associated ferredoxin FrdX by HcpR, and
negative regulation of the sulfate-reduction genes by HcpR in
the Desulfovibrio genomes, based on the position of the candidate HcpR-binding sites relative to the predicted promoters. Thus, HcpR is predicted to be responsible for switching
between alternative electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration in these species. Interestingly, we found an HcpR site
upstream of the CO-dependent hydrogenase that was also
predicted to be under the control of CooA. This hydrogenase
was recently proposed to play a key role in sulfate reduction
[16], and it is tempting to speculate that its inclusion in a common regulon with known sulfate-reduction genes supports
this hypothesis. The position of the binding site, however,
suggests that it activates rather than represses transcription,
contrary to predictions for other known sulfate-reduction
genes, so its regulation is likely to be complex, and further
experiments will be needed to determine whether it plays the
role of the cytoplasmic hydrogenase necessary for the proposed 'hydrogen cycling' of sulfate reduction [58]. The ubiquitous phylogenetic distribution of the HcpR regulon
indicates that it has a central role in facilitating an anaerobic
life style, yet very little is known about its specific function.
We hope our elucidation of the core components and regulator of this important regulon will inspire future experimental
studies to determine its cellular role.

We identified two regulons involved in the control of energy
metabolism (Table 11). The first, controlled by the CooA protein, was present only in the Desulfovibrio genomes. It is
orthologous to a known regulon in R. rubrum, and regulates
genes involved in the oxidation of CO. The second regulon is
novel and distributed widely among anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. The primary downstream target of
this newly identified regulator, which we called HcpR*, is the
hybrid-cluster protein Hcp. Upregulation of the hcp gene in
response to growth on nitrate or nitrite in Shewanella oneidensis, E. coli and D. vulgaris indicates that Hcp is likely to
be involved in the utilization of alternative electron acceptors.

Regulatory motifs for alternative cofactor adaptation

These profiles were used to scan the set of palindromes again,
and the procedure was iterated until convergence. Thus a set
of profiles was constructed. The profile with the greatest
information content [64] was selected as the recognition rule.
Each genome was scanned with the profile using the GenomeExplorer software [65], and genes with candidate regulatory
sites in the 300-bp upstream regions were selected. The
upstream regions of genes that are orthologous to genes containing regulatory sites were examined for candidate sites
even if these were not detected automatically. The threshold
for the site search was defined as the lowest score observed in
the training set. Sets of potentially co-regulated genes contained genes that had candidate regulatory sites in their
upstream regions and genes that could form operons with
such genes (that is, located downstream on the same strand
with intergenic distances of less than about 100 bp). A complete description of the GenomeExplorer software, including
the SignalX program, is given at [65].

Orthologous proteins were identified as bidirectional best
hits [68] by comparing the complete sets of protein sequences
from the two species using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
implemented in the GenomeExplorerprogram [65]. When
necessary, orthologs were confirmed by construction of phylogenetic trees for the corresponding protein families. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximum
likelihood method implemented in PHYLIP [69]. Large-scale
gene cluster comparisons were carried out using the VIMSS
Comparative Genomics database [63]. Multiple sequence
alignments were done using CLUSTALX [70]. The COG [68],
InterPro [71], and PFAM [72] databases were used to verify
the protein functional and structural annotation.

refereed research

The RNApattern program [66] was used to search for conserved RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches) in bacterial
genomes. The input RNA pattern for this program describes
an RNA secondary structure and sequence consensus motifs
as a set of the following parameters: the number of helices,
the length of each helix, the loop lengths, and a description of
the topology of helix pairs. The latter is defined by the coordinates of helices. For instance, two helices may be either independent or embedded helices, or they could form a
pseudoknot structure. This definition is similar to the
approach implemented in the Palingol algorithm [67].

deposited research

For de novo definition of a common transcription factorbinding signal in a set of upstream gene fragments, a simple
iterative procedure implemented in the program SignalX was
used [31]. Weak palindromes were selected in each region,
and each palindrome was compared to all others. The palindromes most similar to the initial one were used to make a
profile. The positional nucleotide weights in this profile were
defined as

where k is the length of the site.

comment

In the course of this study we identified several cases in which
different variants of genes were predicted to be regulated
according to the availability of required cofactors or nutrients. Three examples were observed in which an alternative
enzyme, not requiring a given cofactor, was repressed by the
availability of that cofactor: B12-independent ribonucleotide
reductase was repressed by the availability of B12; [Fe] hydrogenase was repressed by the availability of nickel (and presumably replaced by [NiFe] hydrogenase); and Fe(II) was
predicted to repress a flavodoxin gene which we suspect may
be used as an alternative to ferredoxins present in the
genome. This mode of regulation for B12-independent isozymes of ribonucleotide reductase and methionine synthetase
has been previously described [26]. Moreover, a similar
regulatory strategy has been reported for one of the alternative superoxide dismutases and for paralogs of ribosomal proteins [34-36,38,59]. Taken together, these data suggest that
this flexible strategy may represent a common theme in the
adaptation of bacteria to their environment. Indeed, similar
mechanisms may, in part, explain some of the apparent
genetic redundancy in many genomes.
