Positive selection neighboring functionally
essential sites and disease-implicated regions of
mammalian reproductive proteins
Claire C Morgan, Noeleen B Loughran, Thomas A Walsh, Alan J Harrison, Mary J O’Connell*

Abstract
Background: Reproductive proteins are central to the continuation of all mammalian species. The evolution of
these proteins has been greatly influenced by environmental pressures induced by pathogens, rival sperm, sexual
selection and sexual conflict. Positive selection has been demonstrated in many of these proteins with particular
focus on primate lineages. However, the mammalia are a diverse group in terms of mating habits, population sizes
and germ line generation times. We have examined the selective pressures at work on a number of novel
reproductive proteins across a wide variety of mammalia.
Results: We show that selective pressures on reproductive proteins are highly varied. Of the 10 genes analyzed in
detail, all contain signatures of positive selection either across specific sites or in specific lineages or a combination
of both. Our analysis of SP56 and Col1a1 are entirely novel and the results show positively selected sites present in
each gene. Our findings for the Col1a1 gene are suggestive of a link between positive selection and severe disease
type. We find evidence in our dataset to suggest that interacting proteins are evolving in symphony: most likely to
maintain interacting functionality.
Conclusion: Our in silico analyses show positively selected sites are occurring near catalytically important regions
suggesting selective pressure to maximize efficient fertilization. In those cases where a mechanism of protein
function is not fully understood, the sites presented here represent ideal candidates for mutational study. This work
has highlighted the widespread rate heterogeneity in mutational rates across the mammalia and specifically has
shown that the evolution of reproductive proteins is highly varied depending on the species and interacting
partners. We have shown that positive selection and disease are closely linked in the Col1a1 gene.

Background
Reproductive proteins are essential for success of sexually reproducing species and indeed for the emergence
of new species. In the past it has been observed that
reproductive proteins tend to be under positive selective
pressure to change, i.e. adaptive evolution, a trend found
in a variety of animal species from abalone to primates
[1,2]. Adaptive evolution or positive selection is a selective pressure placed on a protein by a change in environment in order to improve the fitness of the organism
in that environment.
With changes in environment, that can include mating
system, there is a subsequent selective pressure on the

protein sequences related to those functions to adapt
accordingly. This variation can be detected using the
well-known measurements of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Dn) and
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ds) and
their ratio ω = Dn/Ds. The detection of adaptive evolution, where the ratio exceeds unity, is referred to as
positive Darwinian selection. Detecting positive Darwinian selection in a region of a protein, or indeed in a
lineage of a phylogeny, indicates that there is a selective
advantage in changing the amino acid sequence in this
region. These signals are essential for our understanding
of functionally important residues in a protein sequence
and protein functional shift.
In general, the rate of mutation that a gene undergoes
is contingent on a number of factors including; protein

structure, presence of gene duplicates, location in the
genome, effective population size, germ line generation
time, and composition of the sequence (for review see
[3]). It has recently been shown that the number of physical interactions of a particular protein also influences
the intrinsic rate of evolution [4]. Evidence for the generation time effect has come from studies on various
proteins and species including analyses of substitution
rates in higher primates and rodents [5], substitution
rates in higher grasses and in palms [6], in mammalian
genomes [7] and in chloroplast and sex mutation rate
ratios [5,6]. With recent advances in sequencing we
have an opportunity to examine these effects using a
wider selection of proteins and species. Documented
selective pressures associated with positive selection in
reproductive proteins include: (i) intense sperm competition whereby sperm from numerous males, ejaculated
into the female reproductive tract, compete with one
another for the prized fertilization of the egg [8]; (ii)
evasion of the immune system, whereby surface layer
reproductive proteins evolve to evade destruction by the
host’s immune system [8]; and finally (iii) selective pressures enforced by mating system, related of course to
point (i) above. Species that are more promiscuous have
increased levels of selective pressure acting on reproductive proteins than species that are monogamous. This
later point is illustrated in the study of SEMG2, where
adaptive evolution was found to correlate with mating
system in primates [9].
In order to determine the variation in selective pressure in these proteins, there are a number of criteria
that the data must meet. Firstly, the data must have a
robust phylogenetic signal. Secondly, systematic biases
that may exist in the data must be minimized, these
include but are not limited to: long branch attraction
(LBA), amino acid composition bias, base composition
bias and unqualified ortholog predictions, all of which
may lead to inaccurate estimates of phylogeny. Thirdly,
sensitivity to taxa number is a known limitation of
methods for detecting positive selection, therefore more
than 6 taxa are needed to gain accurate estimations of
selective pressure using the maximum likelihood (ML)
method applied here [10].
In this study we have selected a subset of proteins that
have roles to play in reproduction. Our dataset was
composed of three major datatypes, (i) previously published reproductive proteins, (ii) interacting proteins,
here we identified proteins shown to interact with (i),
and finally (iii), genes identified from microarray experiments as being highly expressed in reproductive tissues.
For group (iii) we assume that those proteins highly
expressed in reproductive tissues are important for the
function of that tissue. The previously untested reproductive proteins analysed here are from data types (ii)

Page 2 of 17

and (iii) outlined above. These novel proteins are SP56,
Porimin and Col1a1. SP56 is sperm binding protein
number 56, this protein is a representative of the interacting protein subset of sequences analysed. SP56 has
been shown to interact with ZP3 - a well-studied reproductive protein. Both Porimin and Col1a1 have been
identified from published microarray experiments on
normal human tissue [11], and were selected for analysis
due to their high levels of expression in reproductive tissues in that study. Porimin is a transmembrane protein
that is highly expressed in the uterus, prostate and placenta and Col1a1 is highly expressed in the uterus.
Further evidence for the link between Porimin and
reproduction was not available in the literature and
therefore results from this particular gene are taken
with caution until this protein is further characterized.
Col1a1 plays an important role during spermatogenesis
where it mediates the detachment and migration of
germ cells, thus adding further support for its role in
reproduction [12].
We have analyzed these data with an approach sensitive to all the systematic biases and limitations of methods given above. A number of genes in our dataset have
been analyzed previously but have not taken these limitations and considerations into account. We have
expanded these datasets to include a greater number of
taxa, we have analyzed all of these genes for evidence of
systematic biases and we have used improved models of
codon evolution. In this paper we have included models
that allow for rate variation across the sequence and
across the phylogeny.

Results and Discussion
We performed phylogenetic analyses on all 11 datasets.
The resultant gene trees were found to conflict with the
canonical phylogeny species ([13], as adapted in Figure
1. The only exception was the Catsper1 mammalian
dataset. We postulate the following causes for this conflict: (1) amino acid and/or base composition bias, (2)
lack of phylogenetic signal in the data, and finally (3),
LBA caused by mixtures of long and short germ line
generation times (see Figure 2 for a sample of species
and their germ line generation times from our dataset).
What follows is a summary of the results of the tests of
data quality and bias we performed, see Table 1 for
synopsis. We carried out these tests to determine in
each case whether these conflicting phylogenies are
accurate descriptions of history or whether the data are
subject to these known issues listed 1-3 above. Subsequent statistical comparison of the gene trees and species phylogeny using the Shimodaira Hasegawa (SH) test
[14] revealed that there is no statistical difference
between the gene and species trees in each case, see
Table 2 for results of SH tests. The only exceptions

and 2 respectively. In summary the discordance between
each of the gene trees and the canonical species phylogeny is not a result of amino acid or base composition
biases providing evidence of false relationships.

We tested all multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for
evidence of significant levels of amino acid composition
bias and base composition bias in each lineage using the
TreePuzzle software [15]. We found that all alignments
passed the significance test with p-values < 0.05, see

For each gene, the likelihood of estimated Bayesian phylogeny (gene) and
corresponding ideal species tree (ideal) to fit the dataset were determined
with the SH test at a 5% significance level. Values equal to 1.0000 represent
the tree with the lowest log likelihood, values less than 0.05 refer to those
cases where there is a significant difference between the two topologies, and
the gene tree is a significantly better fit to the data. NS = No Statistical
significance between gene and species tree, in these cases the species tree
was used.

We performed the likelihood mapping procedure implemented in the TreePuzzle software [15,16] to determine
the level of phylogenetic signal/conflict present in each
alignment, for more detail see the Methods section. Our
initial dataset consisted of 27 genes, we used this filtering step to reduce our dataset to contain only those
genes with phylogenetic signal. We categorized the
results from the likelihood mapping analysis into 3 main
categories of signal: category 1 had strong phylogenetic
signal (see Figure 3a), category 2 had medium level of
phylogenetic signal (see Figure 3b) and category 3 had
low/no levels of phylogenetic signal (see Figure 3c). The
results of the test for phylogenetic signal are summarized in Table 1 and in total 9 out of the 27 genes had
strong phylogenetic signal (category 1), with an additional 2 genes with moderate levels of phylogenetic signal (category 2). The complete set of results for the
likelihood mapping process is given in Additional File 3.
The remaining 17 genes failed the test (category 3). The
category 3 genes (with low or no levels of phylogenetic
signal) were subsequently removed from the analysis,
only 10 genes were retained for further analysis.
(iii) Long Branch Attraction (LBA) analysis

We assessed the data for evidence of LBA which would
manifest itself in the data by drawing species with a
greater number of mutations in the gene of interest
together erroneously on the phylogenetic tree. The
method applied uses the MSA and the corresponding
phylogeny to categorise rates amongst sites, using an

phylogeny.

approach we have previsouly published for mammalian
data [17], as described in detail the Methods section. In
this method of site-stripping we apply the phylogenetic
tree (estimated ab initio in this software) and the MSA
to classify all sites in the alignment into one of eight
categories of mutation rate. These are arbitrary categories from 1-8; with 1 being the most highly conserved
sites and 8 being the most highly variable. Essentially,
these estimates allow us to select only the most conserved sites for phylogeny reconstruction. Sites are

sequentially stripped from the alignments based on their
rate of evolution and phylogenies are created based on
slower evolving sites. These site-stripped phylogenies are
then compared to the species tree. Using two independent methods of comparison we determined whether
the resultant stripped trees had topologies significantly
similar to the species phylogeny. The “root mean
squared deviation”, or RMSD, method is restricted to
binary trees [18], see Additional File 4 for full set of
results. Therefore we also employed the SH method of

comparing phylogenies [14], see Additional File 5 for
full set of results. For a full description of the RMSD
statistic used here [18], see the corresponding section in
the Methods. Using this approach we could identify the
signature of LBA in the Ph20 dataset alone, see Table 1
for summary.
2. Analysis of selective pressures using codon models of
evolution

Following analysis of the phylogenies of these reproductive genes, we determined the selective forces at work
on these 10 genes (11 datasets). Only those genes passing the data quality tests were analyzed here (i.e. 10
genes), see Table 1. In the case of Catsper1, we have
analyzed the gene at two different evolutionary distances

because it contains high levels of insertion and deletion
events. The two datasets for Catsper1 are: exon 1 from
the primates only, and, the entire gene from only distant
mammalian groups. Hence the number of datasets is 11,
and the number of genes tested is 10. The alignments in
all cases reached significant levels following randomization tests (z-scores > 1000 in all cases, a z-score of
greater than 5 is typically taken as significant).
In those cases where the genes had already been analyzed in previous studies, we expand upon the data in
these studies and use more sophisticated models of evolution. ML methods are sensitive to sample size with a
minimum of 6 taxa recommended from simulation studies [10]. For a summary of the site-specific and lineage-specific results, see Table 3 and Table 4

ZP2 gene, (b) category 2 genes with intermediate levels of phylogenetic signal, the example given here is the Prkar2a gene, and (c), category
3 genes with low/no phylogenetic signal, the example given here is the CD9 gene.

respectively. For a summary of all likelihood ratio tests
(LRTs) performed in the analyses of these genes see
Table A9. In general the lineages tested in the lineage
specific analysis for each gene were as follows: modern
human; the primate ancestor; modern mouse, and the
rodent ancestor, these are indicated in Figure 4(a-k). For
certain datasets the species tested varied depending on
those species for which high quality sequence data
existed for that gene, these are discussed on a gene-bygene basis below. In summary, for each of the 11 datasets tested, positive selection was detected. In the sitespecific test between 7 and 94 sites per gene were identified as positively selected. In the lineage-specific analyses there were up to 2 lineages per gene identified as
having evidence of positive selection. Below is a brief
description of the results on a gene-by-gene basis, the
complete set of all parameters, likelihood values and
LRTs are given in Additional File 6.

Col1a1

Possibly the most intriguing result from our entire analysis is that from the Col1a1 protein. According to the
microarray study employed here [11], Col1a1 is highly
expressed in the uterus tissue. It is also found in most
structural tissues including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin
and part of the eye (sclera). It is a member of the group
1 collagen proteins involved in the development of the
uterine fibroids [19]. There are two propeptide regions
to the Col1a1 gene, denoted N- and C-terminal propeptides. According to studies on Col1a1 function, a role
has been established for Col1a1 in spermatogenesis [12].
Our site-specific analysis shows 66 sites evolving with
an ω value of 4.09, see Table 3. In summary 35/66 of
our positively selected sites fall in the N-terminal propeptide region (23-161) and 9/66 positively selected sites
fall in the C-terminal propeptide region (1219-1464),
this can be seen clearly in Figure 5a. Position 162 in

Summary table of significant results for lineages specific analyses following LRT analyses. Lineages tested as foreground (Fwd) are shown in the first column.
Only those lineages with significant LRT values for Model B or Model A and ω >1 are shown here. Parameter estimates are given for the LRT values highlighted

Col1a1 is cleaved and modified by an endopeptidase,
position 162 is also modified by pyrrolidone carboxcylic
acid (Swiss-Prot PO2452). A positively selected site at
position 163 is neighboring this multifunctional site,
suggesting that there has been an evolutionary effort to
improve cleavage and/or modification in this protein.
Variations in Col1a1 are linked with Osteogenesis
Imperfecta (OI), an autosomal dominant disease, resulting in an inability to make the correct collagen protein.
There are a spectrum of OI conditions, the most severe
is OI type 2 (OI-II) leading to death in the perinatal
period. A recent extensive study of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with OI has
revealed a number of substitutions of glycine residues
within the triple helical domains of the Col1a1 protein
[20]. The total number of disease implicated sites in the
Swiss-Prot entry P02452 for Col1a1 is 99: 4 of these are
OI non-specific, 4 are OI-I, 59 are OI_II, 14 are OI-IV
and 15 are SNPs (2 are associated with another disease).
One third of the mutations that result in substitutions
for glycine in Col1a1 are lethal whereas those between
the start codon and position 200 are non-lethal. Only 1
of the sites we have identified as positively selected is in
the non-lethal domain from position 1-200, this is site
195. This positively selected site is neighboring the SNP
position 197 that causes a mild OI phenotype. In Table
5 we show a list of 11 positively selected sites that fall
in close proximity to sites associated with disease and

are located between 280 and 1456, spanning the important triple helix region. These positions are all within 1
to 5 amino acid residues of known disease variants, 8 of
these disease variants are the severe/lethal OI-II disease
form. Two exclusively lethal regions, helix positions
691-823 and 910-964 aligned with major binding regions
[20] and we find a positively selected site in this region.
Following a randomization test for the positively
selected sites and disease implicated sites (as denoted by
Swiss-Prot entry PO2452), we have found that the pattern we observe, i.e. finding positively selected sites in
close proximity to disease implicated sites is significant
in 3 out of the 11 cases examined here (at P < 0.05).
Lineage-specific analysis shows evidence for positive
selection in this protein in the rodent ancestor. In total,
2.2% of the sites in the rodent ancestor have ω = 72.73,
while the rest of the species are evolving under purifying
selection, ω = 0.013. For a summary of site and lineage
specific results for Col1a1, see Table 3 and 4. For complete set of results see Additional File 6(d).
Prkar2a (interacts with SEMG2)

Prkar2a is a cAMP dependent protein kinase that is
attached to the sperm flagella via regulatory subunit
(RII) [21]. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been
linked with successful fertilization due to hyper-activated sperm motility [22]. This increase in phosphorylation is part of a cAMP dependent pathway that activates
protein kinase A [22].

Morgan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/39

The PRKA families were previously tested for positive
selection using 3 to 4 taxa and site-specific model M8
with no significant results for positive selection reported.
With our 17 taxa dataset, we were able to detect that
4.7% of sites were evolving at a rate of ω = 2.60, see
Table 3 for summary of details.
Positively selected sites detected in the site-specific
analysis of Prkar2a were compared to the human SwissProt sequence (P13861). In total 18 sites were predicted
to be positively selected, 17 of these sites occur in the
region of the protein associated with dimerization and
phosphorylation (2-138), see Figure 5(c). In the SwissProt entry there are a number of residues listed as being
modified by phosphoserine. These are positions 58, 78,
80, 99 and phosphothreonine at position 54. The sites
estimated to be positively selected from our analysis are:
58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 70, 74, 75, these sites are
at or in close proximity to these modified residues.
The regulatory subunit alpha 2 of Prkar2a has been
shown in vitro to interact with Semg2. The phosphorylation of Semg2 may lead to its activation into forming
a gel matrix in the female reproductive tract. From our
analysis it is shown that while Semg2 has positively
selected sites dispersed throughout its sequence,
whereas the positively selected sites for Prkar2a are localized to the N-terminus region, and the remainder of the
gene is under strong purifying selection. Literature has
so far not specified an exact phosphorylation site for
Semg2, which prevents us from commenting further on
its interactions with Prkar2a.
Lineage-specific analysis shows that Prkar2a in the
macaque has undergone a greater selective pressure to
change when compared with other mammalia in the
dataset, with 2.53% of sites evolving at ω = 1.22, see
Table 4 for summary of results. For complete set of
results for Prkar2a, see Additional File 6(g).
Ph20 (interacts with ZP2 and ZP3)

Ph20 is expressed in the testis and found in the acrosome of the sperm. It is also codes for a receptor that is
involved in the sperm to zona pellucida (ZP) adhesion
[23].
Previous analysis conducted on this protein involved 6
taxa [24]. Here we have increased the number of taxa to
11. We have omitted the carnivores from our analysis of
Ph20 as the sequences were spurious. We found evidence for LBA in the Ph20 dataset. By removing fast
evolving sites a fully resolved gene phylogeny is
obtained. This gene tree now is in agreement with the
ideal species phylogeny ([13].
Lineage-specific analysis shows that guinea pig is
under positive selection, with 6.1% of sites with ω =
12.57 while all other species in the background are evolving at ω = 0.14 or neutrally, see Table 4. The 39 positively selected sites were then compared to the human

Page 8 of 17

Swiss-Prot sequence (P38567), see Figure 5(b) for
results. Catalytically important resides 146, 148, 211 284
and 287 when mutated result in a reduction in, or loss
of, activity [25]. It has been shown experimentally that
mutations in the region of this active site significantly
reduce or completely block the function of this protein
[25]. Our results show that 3 of the positively selected
sites, 155, 272, 273, are in close proximity to these
regions. Another 5 positively selected sites: 83, 155, 252,
353 and 391 are close to glycosylation sites, see Figure 5
(b). These sites when modified are known to change the
structure and function of the Ph20 protein. For complete set of results for Ph20 see Additional File 6(e).
These results are of significance as the Ph20 protein
changes position in the sperm during the different
stages of the fertilization process. In guinea pig Ph20
protein is known to migrate from the post acrosomal
membrane to the inner acrosomal membrane [26]. Thus
finding these positively selected sites in close proximity
to these glycosylation sites in guinea pig suggests that
these sites have been selected to modify the Ph20 structure more effectively thus increasing the chance of
capacitation.
SP56 (interacts with ZP2 and ZP3)

The binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP) is crucial for gamete formation to take place. The exact
mechanisms of this process are still to be uncovered
therefore any predictions on important residues will
greatly improve knowledge by directing mutational studies. SP56 has been shown through photoaffinity crosslinking experiments to have a specific binding affinity
for ZP3 [27]. Therefore it is believed to play an important role in the binding of sperm to the ZP matrix.
Experiments have shown that during capacitation SP56
is released from the acrosomal matrix and becomes situated in the sperm head membrane, enabling it to act as
a ZP3 binding protein [28].
Here we have found 8 positions in the SP56 protein
that are under positive selection (ω = 3.82) following
site-specific analysis. These sites were compared to the
human SP56 entry in Swiss-Prot (Q13228) to determine
possible links to function. One of these 8 positively
selected sites is position 122, regarded as a SNP number
(rs35396382) in dbSNP database [29]. Although further
experimental work needs to be conducted to decipher
the clinical association of this position, it is extremely
interesting that our most significant positively selected
site also displays variation in the population, especially
given the overall high level of conservation in this gene.
For summary of results see Tables 3 and 4, and for full
set of results for this gene see Additional File 6(i).
ZP2

Zona pellucida (ZP) proteins form the complex glycoprotein coat that surrounds the oocyte [30]. These ZP

proteins have been shown to be under strong pressure
to change, and results have been published on both site
and lineage analyses [31]. Here we have expanded the
analysis of ZP2 to include 18 taxa (maximum previously
tested = 8 [31]). We have also applied more complex
models of evolution and have sampled deeper branches
on the phylogeny including a representative of the
Afrotheria - elephant.
In this case, the results of our larger dataset and
more complex models show that the values of ω determined here vary slightly when compared to previous
analyses [31]. This previous test showed 4.7% of sites to

have ω = 2.5, increasing the size of the dataset in this
study results in 52 sites in ZP2 that have an ω value of
2.05. See Additional File 6(j) for complete results.
Positively selected sites were compared to the human
Swiss-Prot entry for ZP2 (Q05996) to identify possible
function for these sites, see Figure 5(d). ZP2 contains 7
carbohydrate chains situated between sites 87-462, these
are important for the sperm to bind to the ZP of the
egg coat [32]. Of the 46 sites identified to be under
positive selection, 23 fall between positions 66-257, this
region contains 5 of the binding domains of the carbohydrate chains. The clustering can be seen more clearly

stop codon (X-axis). The Y-axis is the posterior probability of each of the sites belonging to the positively selected category. The dark blue data
points are sites estimated to be under positive selection. Alternative pale blue and white regions depict alternative domains in the protein, this
data is taken from Swiss-Prot. The vertical red bars in each case represent functionally important sites, these are specific to each gene as follows:

in Figure 5(d). Another cluster of positively selected
sites (10 sites in total) occurs in the propeptide region
(641-745). It has been suggested that upon the cleavage
of the propeptide region, the mature ZP2 protein plays
a role in the prevention of polyspermy [33].
ZP3

Analysis of site-specific evolution in ZP3 identified 48
positively selected sites. Of specific interest are positively
selected positions 329, 330, 332, 336, 338, 339, as these
sites were in close proximity to identified sperm binding
sites (329-334) [34], see Table 3. The furin cleavage site
is identified at position (350-353), and the propeptide
domain at position (351-424). When cleavage takes
place the ZP3 undergoes a conformational change that
inhibits any further sperm binding to the coat thus preventing polyspermy [35]. Of the 48 positively selected
sites identified, 10 fall within the propeptide domain,
with an additional 12 occurring close to the vicinity of
the furin cleavage and sperm binding sites, thus

suggesting that there is a pressure to improve binding
and prevent polyspermy. For complete set of results for
ZP3, see Additional File 6(k).
Adam2 (Fertilin b)

Adam2 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a fundamental role in the final binding of sperm to the oocyte
membrane [36]. Indirect interactions have been shown
with female proteins CD9 [37]. (We have not continued
further analysis on CD9, as it failed the likelihood mapping test).
Previous results have been published reporting positive selection using site-specific analysis on 6 taxa [24].
Here we have included 12 taxa for Adam2 and we have
investigated the possible functional implications of positively selected sites found. In the site-specific analysis
we find 7.3% of sites with ω = 3.94, this corresponds to
45 sites in total, see Table 3. Comparison of these positions to human Swiss-Prot Adam2 sequence (Q99965),
we determine that 39/45 positively selected sites are

situated in the C-terminus region. On closer investigation of these sites we find that 12/45 positively selected
sites occur in the disintegrin domain (position 384-473).
The disintegrin domain has been shown to be involved
in the binding of Adam2 to the oocyte [38]. A cysteinerich domain occurs between (477-606), 16/45 positively
selected sites fall in this region. It has been suggested
for Adam12, (another member of the Adam family of
proteins), that the cysteine-rich domain plays a role in
mediating the cellular interactions via syndecans and
integrin [39], a similar role for this domain in Adam2
can be postulated. Overall the results for Adam2 suggest
a selective pressure for increased binding of Adam2 to
the oocyte regardless of species of origin. For a complete
set of results and LRTs for Adam2, see Additional File 6
(a).
Catsper1

Catsper1 is involved in regulating the calcium cation
channel in sperm flagella, the result of which is

movement of sperm [40]. Previous studies on Catsper1
exon 1 have been performed [41]. We intended to
expand our analysis to span all exons and expand the
data set to include a variety of mammalia. However, the
exon 1 of non-primate mammalia is so highly variable
that an accurate alignment cannot be constructed. The
remaining exons were highly conserved across all species. We therefore split our catsper1 dataset into two
sections each of which produced a good quality alignment for analysis, (1) exon1 of catsper1 for the primates,
and (2) entire catsper1 gene for non-primate mammalia.
(a) Catsper1 Exon 1 primatesSite-specific analysis of
this protein identified 17% of the protein under positive
selection with ω = 3.13. Previous analysis of this exon
showed positive selection on indel substitutions in this
gene [41]. The positively selected sites are situated
throughout exon1, little is known about the functional
significance of these sites. However, it is known that
exon 1 has a significant role to play in altering the rate

Morgan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/39

of calcium ion channel inactivation. Different lengths in
the N-terminus result in different rates of channel inactivation, where a long terminus results in a longer time
to activation than the shorter terminus. This is
described most effectively by the ball and chain mechanism described in [41]. See Additional File 6(b) for complete results. These results show the importance of this
protein, and specifically the first exon, for reproductive
success.
(b) Catsper1 entire gene non-primate mammalsOur
site-specific analysis identified 16.7% of the sites under
positive selection with an ω = 3.27, see Table 3. These
sites all cluster in exon 1. While the rodent ancestor
appears to be under positive selection with 4.47% of its
sites evolving at ω = 999, see Additional File 6(c) for
complete set of results. A previous study of 9 rodent
species, including Mus musculus individuals from 4 different populations, has shown that within the rodent
order there has been a continued pressure to evolve,
with positive selection for indel substitutions in exon1
of the Catsper1 gene [43].
Semg2

A member of the family of semenogelin genes, Semg2 is
involved in the formation of a postcopulatory plug [44].
Previously, positive selection has been reported for both
site-specific and lineage-specific analysis for Semg2
[9,45]. We have expanded the data set from previous
analyses to incorporate more species.
In our site-specific analysis, we found that 2.7% of our
sites had an ω value of 12.26, see Table 3.
We have performed a novel functional analysis of
these positively selected sites by comparing them to the
human Semg2 sequence (Q02383) in the Swiss-Prot
database. This is a step not previously taken by other
studies of Semg2. A striking pattern emerged - all
known domains of this protein have several positively
selected sites. There is a probable glycosylation site at
position 272, which is located close to a large stretch of
positively selected sites (positions 262 to 289). It is so
far unknown how significant this glycosylation site is in
Semg2 and whether it plays a role in modifying the protein to form a copulatory plug. However, the results
indicate that this protein, and in particular the region
around the glycosylation site, has been under significant
pressure to change.
A complete set of results for Semg2 is given in
Additional File 6(h). The lineage-specific results are
not described here in detail as lineage analyses have
been carried out previously on the primate Semg2
gene [9,45]. It has been shown recently that the rate
of evolution for this protein varies depending on the
level of sperm competition [9]. Our results are in
agreement with this finding, thus further verifying our
approach.

Porimin

Two isoforms of this protein have been identified; we
have focused on isoform 1 in the mammalia, as isoform
2 contains an additional human specific region between
residues 34-52. To date the exact mechanisms of this
transmembrane receptor are unknown. This protein is
not well characterized biochemically and its function
cannot be verified as reproduction related, therefore we
only discuss the results briefly below.
On site-specific analysis of this protein we determined
that 30 of the sites are under positive selection (ω =
12.22), see Table 3. From analysis of the sites on the
Swiss-Prot entry for human Porimin (Q8N131), we
could determine that two positively selected sites (146
and 147), were found in a highly conserved region and
fall in close proximity to the N-linked glycosylation site.
For complete set of results for Porimin, see Additional
File 6(f).

Conclusion
Testing for phylogenetic signal and biases, such as
amino acid composition bias and LBA, indicated that
there was adequate phylogenetic signal for 10 of the
genes and in general no evidence of systematic biases.
On testing for LBA, Ph20 was the only protein in this
dataset that displayed the typical signature of this bias
with gene and species tree agreement being maximized
with the removal of the fastest evolving categories. This
would suggest that while germ line generation times
vary greatly in the dataset, the effect of the resultant
LBA does not impact on the sequence data to any great
extent (1/11datasets).
Selective pressures for the reproductive proteins studied here are heterogeneous. All proteins exhibited
regions of strong conservation proving the importance
of maintaining structural stability and overall function
in these proteins. All but 1 protein (Adam2) exhibited
evidence of positive selection in specific lineages, and
all proteins without exception exhibited positive selection in regions of catalytic/functional importance. For
SP56 and Col1a1 the site-specific results are entirely
novel. The lineage-specific results described here for
Prkar2a and Catsper1 exon 1 in primates, are also
novel. We have shown that, in the case of Catsper1,
there is a fundamental protein functional shift between
new world monkeys and old world monkeys. The Dn/
Ds measurement applied here assumes that neutral
substitution rate is akin to Ds, therefore no selection
on silent sites. There have been many publications of
late to the contrary therefore we are mindful of examining the rate of silent substitution in all our analyses
[46,47].
For the reproductive genes in our dataset, we show
that lineages evolve at unique rates and at functionally

Morgan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/39

crucial sites, specifically those involved in phosphorylation. We have also shown that a number of these proteins (Col1a1 and Catsper1) show positive selection for
example in the ancestral rodent lineage and evidence of
purifying selection in the subsequent divergent species.
Overall our analyses of these reproductive proteins
show how important it is to carefully examine data for
systematic biases prior to testing for lineage and/or
site specific positive selection. We have also demonstrated the importance of including large numbers of
taxa/lineages in these analyses. This finding was highlighted in our analysis of Prkar2a where previous analysis of this protein had included only 4 taxa and
therefore reported a negative result. We do not
observe any large-scale effect of germ line generation
time in our dataset, with only 1 protein (Ph20) with
evidence of long branch attraction. The results of
Col1a1 indicate that the positively selected sites may
have been of such importance for this protein that
neighboring mutated sites may have been maintained
in the population despite their propensity for causing
disease. The location of positively selected sites determined using this approach and in regions of functional
importance in the proteins in this dataset, provides us
with further evidence of the link between functional
shift and positive selection.

Methods
The data analyzed in this study consist of homologous
reproductive genes from a variety of mammalian genomes. Genes were identified as being reproduction
related from literature searches, analysis of protein
interaction networks (iHOP) [48] and expression
(microarray) data [11]. The microarray expression data
used is from normal human tissues. We have also
included a more in-depth analysis of previously identified cases of positive selection in reproductive proteins.
A list of all data used in this study are available in
Additional File 7, the total number of genes analyzed
was 10. Homologs of all 10 reproduction related genes
were identified in mammalian genomes that span the
entire phylogeny of mammals, see Figure 1. For each
of the reproduction related genes, the alignment of
homologs contained between 10 and 18 species, and
the alignment length varied between 351 and 4374
base pairs.
Sequence Data

Protein coding sequences for the reproductive proteins
were retrieved by the combination of two methods;
Ensembl and Blast searches. Orthologous coding
sequences from all available completed mammalian genomes were retrieved from the Ensembl database [49].
These orthologs had been identified previously by

Page 13 of 17

performing a genome-wide reciprocal WUBlastp
+SmithWaterman search of each gene across all completed genomes. To include those mammalia that were
not present in Ensembl a BlastP search was conducted
on all the human amino acid sequences from each gene
against the Swiss-Prot database.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

All coding sequences were translated into their corresponding amino acid sequences using in-house translation software. Gene family alignments were generated at
protein level using ClustalX 1.83.1 using default parameter settings [50]. The corresponding nucleotide gene
family datasets were aligning based on their protein
alignments using in-house software. Each gene family
alignment was manually edited using Se-Al [51] to
remove any ambiguous regions.
Nucleotide composition bias, amino acid composition
bias and likelihood mapping tests

TreePuzzle 5.2 [15] performs a chi-square test that
compares the amino acid composition of each

Morgan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/39

sequence to the frequency distribution assumed in the
General Time Reversible (GTR) and Jones Taylor
Thornton (JTT) models [52]. Ideally no species should
fail this test, however, where two species fail and are
thus drawn together on a tree, these sequences are
excluded. Using the likelihood mapping method, each
tree is disassembled into its constituent quartets and
the support for each possible quartet is assessed. If the
data contains phylogenetic signal then the likelihood of
all three possible relationships for that quartet will be
equally likely, these are represented by the three tips
of the triangle, and the majority of the signal will be in
these tip regions. Otherwise, the vertices and central
region will be most heavily populated by supporting
quartets.
Phylogeny Reconstruction

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MrBayes
v3.2.1 [53] and the amino acid sequences. Amino acid
sequences were used in order to vitiate the effects of
base and codon compositional biases. The substitution
model was selected following model testing using Modelgenerator version 85 [54]. The selected model was
JTT, the GTR rate model was implemented and the first
20000 trees for each gene were discarded as “burnin”. A
majority rule consensus tree from the remaining trees
sampled was constructed for each gene. The parameter
settings for each gene phylogeny are summarized in
Additional File 8.

see below). At each stage we employ MrBayes [56] to
perform the phylogenetic reconstruction using the aforementioned settings.
Tests of the difference between two trees
Test 1: Nodal distance calculation

TOPD/FMTS v 3.3 [18] calculates the distance
between the site-stripped trees and the ‘ideal’ tree. The
‘ideal’ tree used for each gene was a pruned version of
the canonical species tree as seen in Figure 1. A distance matrix is derived by counting the number of
nodes that separate each of the taxa in a tree. A distance matrix is calculated for each site-stripped tree as
compared to the ideal species tree. The nodal distance
score is obtained by calculating the RMSD of the
matrices. If both trees are identical the RMSD value
would be 0, indicating no distance between them. This
figure increases the more distance there is between the
two trees.
Test 2: Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) statistical test of two
trees

For each gene MSA, complete and site-stripped, a comparison of the likelihood of the estimated Bayesian phylogeny for that alignment with the likelihood of its
corresponding ‘ideal’ species tree was carried out using
the SH test [14] implemented in TreePuzzle 5.2 [15] to
determine which tree was significantly the best-fit tree
for the alignment.
Selective Pressure Analysis

Site-stripping for significance

To test for long branch attraction (LBA) we applied the
slow-fast approach of Brinkman and Phillipe [55]. We
implemented the rate categorisation in a maximum likelihood framework in TreePuzzle 5.2 [15]. This software
takes the alignment as input and generates ab initio
phylogenetic trees. It then calculates the rate of mutation for each site in the alignment. The software specifies 8 arbitrary categories of site: each one of these
categories contains some portion of the alignment. In
this manuscript 8 is the most rapidly evolving (for
example every lineage has a different character state for
that character), and category 1 is the most slowly evolving (for example each lineage has the same/identical
character state for that character). Sites are then progressively removed from the protein MSA according to
their evolutionary rate, and at each stage a new phylogenetic tree is constructed based on this slightly reduced
dataset. The difference between the new topology created on a reduced alignment and the original topology
reconstructed based on the entire alignment are then
compared in a statistical framework to determine which
fits the data best (SH Test 2, see below) or which is
most similar to the species phylogeny (RMSD Test 1,

PAML 4.3 [57,58] uses a ML method of calculating ω
for site-specific and lineage-site specific changes.
Codeml, part of the PAML 4.3 package [57,58], applies
a series of models to our data, with each model differing from the previous with the addition of more complex parameters. The simplest model is M0, and it
calculates an ω value over the entire alignment. This
model assumes that all sites and all lineages are evolving at the same rate. Model M3 is an extension of
M0 and allows all ω values to vary freely. There are
two variations of the M3 model, m3(k = 2) discrete
which allows two variable classes of sites and m3(k =
3) which allows three classes of site. M1 is a neutral
model that allows two parameter estimates for proportion of sites where ω = 0 or ω = 1. M2 is the selection
model, it allows three parameters where ω = 0 or ω =
1 or ω is estimated and free to be greater than 1. M7,
is the beta model, it allows ten different site classes for
ω between 0 and 1. M7 is compared against the more
parameter rich M8 (beta &omega >1). M8 allows 10
different site classes but contains an additional parameter whereby the 11 th ω is free to vary between 0
and >1. M8a(beta &omega = 1) is null hypothesis of
model 8. Model A & Model B are models that allow

testing of ω variation in lineage-site analyses. Model A
is an extension of M1 and Model B is a more parameter rich extension of m3(k = 2). We have also
implemented model A null which is denoted as modelA1 elsewhere. Model A null is compared to model A
in an LRT as per Additional File 9. Only statistically
significant models for the data are taken into account.
Statistically significant results were decided by calculating the difference in log likelihood or, lnL, scores
between models and their more parameter rich extensions in a likelihood ratio test (LRT) as described previously in [17,58]. If the likelihood score was exceeded
the critical c 2 values, then the result was significant.
See Additional File 9 for full set of LRTs performed.
In silico analysis of positively selected sites

Sites under positive selection (ω > 1) were estimated
using the empirical Bayes methods in the site-specific
and lineage specific analysis performed. The methods
used were naúve empirical Bayes (NEB) and Bayes
empirical Bayes (BEB) [58]. Swiss-Prot is a protein
sequence database that provides description of the function of a protein, the domain structures, post-translational modifications and variants. Significant sites,
verified through close examination of the MSAs and
codeml output using alignment visualisation software
Se-AL [51], were compared with unaligned human
amino acid sequence taken from Swiss-Prot. These sites
were examined to see whether or not they lay in catalytically important regions of the protein.

quartet of species are represented by the corners of the triangle, these
corners represent strong support for phylogenetic signal. Quartets
present on the vertices represent incongruence in the phylogenetic
signal. Quartets at the centre of the triangle represents those quartets
where all three topologies are equally likely, i.e. phylogenetic signal
completely lacking. Each gene is subsequently given a category based
on the quality of the data, only categories 1 and 2 were used.
