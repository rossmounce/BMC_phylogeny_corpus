Regulatory polymorphisms in the bovine
Ankyrin 1 gene promoter are associated with
tenderness and intramuscular fat content
Ozlem Aslan1,2, Torres Sweeney2, Anne Maria Mullen1, Ruth M Hamill1*

Abstract
Background: Recent QTL and gene expression studies have highlighted ankyrins as positional and functional
candidate genes for meat quality. Our objective was to characterise the promoter region of the bovine ankyrin 1
gene and to test polymorphisms for association with sensory and technological meat quality measures.
Results: Seven novel promoter SNPs were identified in a 1.11 kb region of the ankyrin 1 promoter in Angus,
Charolais and Limousin bulls (n = 15 per breed) as well as 141 crossbred beef animals for which meat quality data
was available. Eighteen haplotypes were inferred with significant breed variation in haplotype frequencies. The five
most frequent SNPs and the four most frequent haplotypes were subsequently tested for association with sensory
and technological measures of meat quality in the crossbred population. SNP1, SNP3 and SNP4 (which were
subsequently designated regulatory SNPs) and SNP5 were associated with traits that contribute to sensorial and
technological measurements of tenderness and texture; Haplotype 1 and haplotype 4 were oppositely correlated
with traits contributing to tenderness (P < 0.05). While no single SNP was associated with intramuscular fat (IMF), a
clear association with increased IMF and juiciness was observed for haplotype 2.
Conclusion: The conclusion from this study is that alleles defining haplotypes 2 and 4 could usefully contribute to
marker SNP panels used to select individuals with improved IMF/juiciness or tenderness in a genome-assisted
selection framework.

Background
Ankyrins are structural proteins forming a fundamental
component of the cytoskeleton. They are a family of
proteins that link the integral membrane proteins to the
underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, which in muscle
forms a highly complex network of inter-myofibril connections as well as connections between myofibrils and
the sarcolemma [1,2] and the sarcoplasmic reticulum
[2-5]. Ankyrin contains a regulatory domain which is
sensitive to proteolysis [6]. Ankyrins are a known target
of the calpains [7-9] which are a family of endogenous
cysteine proteases that have been shown to be fundamental to the post-mortem proteolysis of myofibrillar
proteins and cytoskeletal proteins and consequent meat
tenderisation [10-14]. Degradation of key myofibrillar
proteins and the cytoskeleton results in the linkages

between myofibrils being broken, thus meat becomes
tender [15]. The proteolysis of ankyrin is anticipated to
cause a serious effect on cellular integrity [16] with
potential consequences for sensory and technological
characteristics of meat.
Recent research has highlighted ANK1 as a positional
and functional candidate gene for meat quality in foodproducing animals. The bovine ankyrin 1 gene has been
mapped close to a QTL for fat associated traits, including marbling in meat [17-19] on bovine chromosome
27. In parallel, expression of the porcine ankyrin 1 gene
has been associated with a number of meat quality
traits, including tenderness, intramuscular fat level
(IMF) and water-binding capacity [20].
Genetic polymorphism in the promoter region is one of
the mechanisms known to influence variability in the
expression of a gene, with associated consequences for
the phenotypic diversity of a population [21-25]. Here, the
objective of this study was to characterise single nucleotide

polymorphisms in a 1.11 kb region of the bovine ANK1
promoter region and to test for association with technological and sensory parameters of meat quality traits.

Results
Characterisation of a novel muscle transcript of the
bovine ankyrin 1 gene

After 5’ RACE-PCR, two ANK1 transcripts differing in
size by approximately 350 bp were observed (Figure 1).
The smaller fragment was consistent with previously
published sequence [Bos taurus ankyrin 1 mRNA, partial
CDs; GenBank: AF222766.1]. The larger transcript was
novel and hence was cloned and sequenced (Figure 2).
The novel mRNA sequence was submitted to the EMBL
database with accession number [FR717674].
341 bp of the larger transcript was not annotated in
the NCBI database and hence was considered a novel
mRNA sequence. The novel transcription start site
(TSS) was upstream of the previously predicted TSS for
this gene (39,124,124) reported in [AF222766.1]
(btau_4.0). The genomic location of the novel mRNA
sequence was immediately adjacent to the known genomic DNA sequence of exon 1. An ATG codon was
located 17-19 bp downstream of the novel TSS. The
sequence around this new ATG codon matches important elements of the Kozak consensus sequence, including a G at +4, and CC at -2 to -1. In addition, three
putative TATA boxes were located 110 bp, 764 bp and
774 bp upstream of the TSS: TTATTAA, TATTTTTA,
and TTATA respectively (Figure 3). The predicted
initiator methionine was in frame with the previously
identified start codon in exon 1. A stop codon was present at position 191-193 bp.
Promoter SNP discovery

Resequencing of 1.11 kb upstream of the novel bovine
ANK1 novel transcript TSS revealed seven novel

promoter SNPs located as follows, relative to the transcription start site: SNP1 (C:T) at position -24, SNP2
(C:T) at position -307, SNP3 (G:A) at position -672,
SNP4 (C:G) at position -687, SNP5 (C:T) at position
-733 and SNP6 (C:T) at position -944, and SNP7 (A:C)
at position -961 (Table 1 and 2). SNPs 1-5 were
observed in all the populations examined and genotype
frequencies were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (Table 2).
Allele and haplotype frequencies were determined in
two European breeds (Charolais and Limousin) and one
British breed (Angus), which are all represented in the
Irish herd. SNP6 was monomorphic in Aberdeen Angus
and Limousin breeds, while SNP7 was monomorphic in
the Aberdeen Angus breed (Table 1, 2). However, only
this latter SNP (SNP7) displayed significant divergence
in allele frequency between Limousin and Aberdeen
Angus (P < 0.001) and between Charolais and Aberdeen
Angus (P = 0.042). SNP1-5 had minor allele frequencies
greater than 10% in all populations examined, with the
exception of SNP4, which had a minor allele frequency
of 3.3% in the Limousin breed (Table 1).

If a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) of a gene is
polymorphic in a population this can lead to variation
in the level or timing of gene expression [26-28]. In this
study, seven novel promoter SNPs were analysed
in silico to determine if they created or abolished putative transcription factor binding motifs and hence could
be described as regulatory SNPs (rSNPs). rSNPs 1, 3, 4
and 7 were located within putative transcription factor
binding motifs and either created or abolished putative
TFBS as illustrated in Table 3. While three different
TFBS predictor tools were used in this study, only five
motif changes were supported by more than one prediction tool:

rSNP1

rSNP7-CAC-binding

Glucocorticoid receptor- The presence of the minor T
allele at rSNP1 led to the creation of a putative glucocorticoid receptor transcription factor binding site,
which was not present with the alternate C allele.

The presence of the minor C allele at rSNP7 creates a
putative CAC-binding transcription factor binding site,
which was not present with the alternate A.

rSNP4-Sp1

Haplotype construction

The presence of the minor G allele at rSNP4 abolishes a
putative Sp1 transcription factor binding site, that was
present with the alternate.

Linkage disequilibria plots are presented in Figure 4a-d.
Pair-wise r2 values were close to 1 for rSNP1, 3 and 5,
indicating they were in high linkage disequilibrium with
each other in the four populations. Haplotypes are
defined as a combination of SNP alleles closely linked
on the same chromosome. Haplotype-based methods
can provide higher power to asses the complex

rSNP4-delta factor (YY1)

The presence of the minor G allele created a delta factor
transcription factor binding site, that was not present
with the alternate.

relationship between genetic variation and phenotypes,
compared with methods based on single SNP analysis
[29,30].
Eighteen potential haplotypes were inferred in the study.
Four inferred haplotypes had allele frequencies greater
than 10% (Table 4) in the crossbred animals group. The
top three haplotypes were HAP2 (CTGCCCA), HAP3
(TCACTCA) and HAP4 (CCGCCCA) with frequencies of
0.344, 0.185 and 0.177 respectively. These were also the
top three haplotypes in both Charolais and Limousin
breeds. In the Aberdeen Angus breed, the main haplotypes
were HAP1 (CTGGCCA), HAP2 (CTGCCCA) and HAP4
(CCGCCCA) which had frequencies of 0.10, 0.266
and 0.534 respectively. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that HAP1 and HAP2 were the most closely related
haplotypes, followed by HAP4. HAP3 was most distant
(Figure 5).
Association analysis
Single SNP association

Associations between the rSNPs and meat quality traits
(technological and sensory) are reported in Table 5.
Least-squares means for meat quality traits for each
genotype are also presented in Table 5. Overall, four of
the five single SNPs tested showed association with at
least one meat quality trait. These comprised of 17 significant associations (P < 0.05) and 6 tendencies towards
association (P < 0.1) in total. Three SNPs which were in
strong LD with each other (rSNP1, rSNP3 and rSNP5)
were associated with sensory tenderness in LTL and/or
SM muscle. rSNP1 and rSNP5 were also associated with
an objective measure of tenderness (Warner-Bratzler
shear force) in both LTL and SM muscles, while rSNP3
was associated with shear force in LTL. rSNP1 and
rSNP5 were also associated with sensory texture in both
LTL and SM muscles, whereas rSNP3 and rSNP4 were
associated with texture in LTL and SM muscle,
respectively.

Haplotype association

A number of significant associations were found between
individual ANK1 promoter haplotypes and aspects of meat
quality. Least squares means, associated P-values and
Tukey-Kramer contrasts are presented in Table 6. Each of
the four most common haplotypes was associated with at
least one aspect of sensory or technological quality:
HAP1 Homozygous HAP1 individuals had reduced texture scores in SM (P = 0.0012) and increased firmness
scores in LTL muscle (P = 0.0176), compared to individuals with no copy of this haplotype.
HAP2 The most common haplotype, HAP2, was associated with IMF content in both LTL and SM muscle
(P = 0.0276 and P = 0.0275, respectively). Homozygous
HAP2 individuals had almost twice as much IMF content (1.95%) in SM, compared with those that had no
copies of the haplotype (1.06%). In LTL muscle, there
was also an increase in IMF % with haplotype 2. IMF
levels were higher in LTL muscle, compared with SM
but the trend was the same - Individuals with two
copies had 3.24% fat compared with 1.99% for those
with zero copies. For both SM and LTL, individuals
with one copy of the haplotype had intermediate levels
of fat. This association was supported by a tendency
towards increased juiciness in SM muscle (P = 0.077) of
HAP2, as fat influences juiciness [31,32].
HAP3 This haplotype was associated with texture in LTL
(P = 0.0070) and tenderness score in SM muscle (P =
0.0317).
HAP4 A significant observation was that homozygous or
heterozygous individuals for HAP4 had increased tenderness scores, decreased firmness and lower shear force
values in LTL muscle compared to non-carriers. In
addition, non-carrier animals were 10% firmer (5.34 ±
0.09) than for either homozygous or heterozygous carriers (5.02 ± 0.27 and 5.00 ± 0.12, respectively). Individuals with one copy of HAP4 had lower texture score
compared to those without this haplotype.

muscle (P = 0.0445). Heterozygous individuals had
increased texture score compared to those with no copy
of this haplotype.

Discussion
Here, we have identified a new transcript variant of the
bovine ankyrin 1 gene in muscle. Seven novel SNPs
were identified in the promoter region and several associations between the promoter SNPs and haplotypes and

meat quality traits were observed. After correction for
multiple testing, associations between rSNPs 1 and 4,
and haplotype 2 and meat quality were significant.
We have shown that a novel variant of the ankyrin 1
gene is present in muscle. This variant is longer than
previously reported variants (NCBI) and increases the
overall gene length by 341 bp in the 5’ direction. The
identification of alternative transcripts of bovine ANK1
is not surprising. Indeed, mammalian genomes express
three ankyrin proteins, which are encoded by three

separate genes (ANK1-3) [33-35]. In bovine, ANK2 is
located on chromosome 6 (13,335,381 - 13,706,921;
btau_4.0) and ANK3 is located on chromosome 28
(14,417,416 - 14,535,840; btau_4.0). Unlike ANK1,
neither map close to QTL for meat quality traits. However, ANK2 maps close to several QTL for carcass yield
traits including longissimus muscle area [18] and back

fat EBV [36,37]. The functional and molecular diversity
of the ankyrin family is a result of differential expression
of these three independent genes and their widely alternatively spliced variants, some missing large segments
that include whole functional domains [38-42]. It has
been reported that ankyrin 1 has the most limited pattern of expression restricted to erythroid, muscle and

neural tissue in human, but despite these limitations, tissue-specific isoforms with multiple transcripts are generated by alternative splicing under the control of several
tissue-specific promoters [33,39].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory regions can regulate the level and/or timing of
gene transcription [26-28]. Evolutionary mutations arising in a promoter can have variable effects depending
on the rSNP location relative to TFBS, start codons,
transcription start sites etc, and the intracellular molecular environment. In some cases, a SNP may eliminate
the natural binding site of a tissue-specific transcription
factor or create a new binding site [28]. Therefore, functional rSNPs in TFBS may lead to differences in gene
expression [28] with significant potential to increase
phenotypic diversity. In this study, several ANK1 rSNPs
were associated with meat quality traits. After correction
for multiple testing, two of the SNP associations
remained significant. These were the association
between rSNP1 and tenderness score and the association between rSNP4 and texture values. While it is possible that these are marker SNPs rather than causative,
of interest was that the rSNPs were found within well
supported putative transcription factor binding motifs.
For instance, presence of the minor T allele of rSNP1
created a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) motif and

presence of the C allele of rSNP4 created a Sp1 motif.
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones which regulate a
variety of biological processes and can influence many
functions of a cell [43]. The GR functions as a hormone-induced transcription factor which has been
shown to regulate (either stimulate or repress) gene
expression [43-45]. The presence of allele C of rSNP4
led to the creation of a Sp1 motif. Sp1 has been shown
to bind to a consensus sequence of the leptin gene promoter and mutations in this region abolished the binding and reduce promoter activity in rat [46]. Adamowicz
and co-workers [47] also reported that a mutation in
the Sp1 binding site of the bovine leptin gene affects its
expression level. The presence of a G allele of this SNP
(rSNP4) created a binding site for the zinc finger
nuclear protein, YY1 (Yin Yang 1), also known as NFE1, UCRBP or CF1, which is known to have fundamental roles in repressing and activating a diverse group of
promoters; it not only initiates transcription but also
activates or represses it [48,49]. YY1 is also shown to
repress muscle specific expression of sarcomeric alphaactin and c-myc genes [49]. Walowitz and co-workers
also reported that calpains and the 26 S proteasome are
involved in YY1 stability in rat muscle indicating that
myogenic transcription may be inactivated by developmentally regulated proteolysis to promote muscle development. While it was not the aim of the present study,
further functional studies would be valuable to assess
the role of these TFBS, in modulating the expression of
muscular transcripts of the bovine ankyrin 1 gene.
Few studies have examined variation in ANK1 in relation to muscle biology. However, Wimmers et al. [20]
examined one SNP in the 3’ UTR region of the porcine
homolog. They have reported that this SNP in the 3’
UTR of porcine ANK1 showed associations with shear
force and IMF content, as well as several traits related
to water-binding capacity in muscle [20], in several pig
breeds.
In the present study, several of these rSNP were
linked, therefore association analysis with individual
haplotypes was also carried out. HAP4 was significantly
associated with measures of tenderness. Sensory tenderness and firmness scores were improved in animals with
HAP4 genotypes (approximately 5-10%), as was shear
force (10-20%). These effect sizes suggest that the influence on tenderness is quantitative rather than that of a
major gene [50]. However, this effect may be important
to perceived tenderness. Recent research has shown that
beef with shear force values higher than 52.68 N can be
reliably classified as ‘tough’ by sensory panellists and
beef with shear force values lower than 42.87 N can be
reliably classified as ‘tender’ [51]. The observed genotypes and haplotypes at these promoter SNPs can thus
potentially discern ‘tender’ from ‘intermediate’ to tough’

beef. The findings reported here may be significant as
there are to date, few markers for tenderness that have
been widely confirmed and are in commercial use e.g.
SNP in calpain and calpastatin gene regions [52-54]
and expression level of DNAJA1 [55,56].
This haplotype (HAP4) was, however, associated with
lower scores for texture. This means that selection for
improved tenderness may result in a disimprovement in
texture. However, it should be noted that sensory texture
profile is not as well correlated with sensory tenderness
as is Warner Bratzler shear force [57]. Low values of texture can be scored for meat that is too soft and mushy or
too firm and unyielding. In contrast, low scores of tenderness and firmness are clearer in their meaning to sensory panellists (tougher and less firm respectively).
Additionally, we also observed that homozygous HAP1

individuals also had reduced texture scores in SM muscle
compared to individuals with no copy of this haplotype.
This association remained significant even after a stringent Bonferroni correction (P = 0.0012), suggesting a
possible role in influencing bovine muscle texture.
Homozygous individuals with this haplotype also had
increased firmness scores in LTL muscle.
Post-mortem tenderisation is influenced by enzymatic
degradation of myofibrillar and associated cytoskeletal
proteins. These proteins function to maintain myofibrillar
integrity and it is known that the calpain system, in particular calpain 1, is responsible for proteolysis of these proteins [10,12,13,15]. The calpain family of Ca2+-dependent
proteases are thus key proteins in the regulation of tenderness [58-60]. Proteins which are reported to be proteolysed by calpains can be classified as kinases/phosphatases,

membrane associated proteins, some transcription factors
and cytoskeletal proteins which include desmin, gelsolin,
myosin, nebulin, spectrins, titin, tropomyosin -for review
see [61]. Ankyrin is one of the cytoskeletal proteins proteolysed by members of the calpain family [7,16,61,62].
Since ankyrin has functions in maintaining the structural
integrity of, and linkages among myofibrils, the degradation of ankyrin could cause further softening of myofibrils
and thus, tenderization. The relationship between tenderness (sensory and shear force) and HAP4 or rSNP1,
rSNP3 of the bovine ANK1 promoter, may indicate that
this haplotype and/or these rSNP might alter the expression of cytoskeletal protein ankyrin 1 in muscle and thus
the extent of post-mortem proteolysis by calpains.
An association with IMF content (%) was observed for
HAP2 in both muscles. This was supported by sensory
juiciness score, which is an indirect sensory measure of
intramuscular fat content [31,32], in that HAP2 showed
a tendency towards increased juiciness in SM muscle.
Intramuscular fat has been shown to contribute 10 15% of the variance in palatability of beef [63]. These
results suggest that HAP2 may have potential in selection for IMF content. It is curious that HAP2 was associated with IMF but only differs from HAP4 and HAP1

by a single SNP in each case (rSNP2 and rSNP4, respectively). Neither rSNP2 nor rSNP4 are associated with
IMF alone. This suggests that the relationship between
HAP2 and this trait may be via linkage to nearby functional SNP. In fact, a number of QTL for marbling and
fat thickness have been identified on this chromosome
in a mapping population of Bos indicus × Bos taurus
(including Hereford, Angus and Charolais) cattle
[18,19]. More recently, 3 QTL for marbling and 2 QTL
for fat thickness have been identified on chromosome
27 in commercial Angus cattle [19]. While ANK1 is not
located within any of these QTL, its proximity supports
the hypothesis that it is a candidate gene for these traits.
Many improvements in meat quality can be achieved
by optimising systems management in animal production and meat processing [64-66]. However, in addition
to environmental and processing influences on meat
quality, there are certainly biological factors which affect
the quality of meat [67-70]. The identification of genomic regions influencing economically important traits,
in particular tenderness and intramuscular fat, has been
made possible due to polymorphic markers and linkage
maps in cattle. However, just a few genes have been
located within these QTL and found to be influencing

Aslan et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:111
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/111

these traits. In this study we have found that polymorphisms (SNPs and haplotypes) of the ankyrin 1 gene
are in association with these important meat quality
traits. This is the first time such associations have been
identified, therefore it will be important to confirm
these findings in independent populations [71].

Conclusions
In this report, we have shown a new transcript variant
of the bovine ankyrin 1 gene in muscle. We have identified seven novel SNPs in the promoter region of bovine
ANK1 and several of these SNPs and inferred haplotypes
were associated with meat quality traits, in particular
meat tenderness and intramuscular fat. Of interest was
that some of these promoter SNPs were also found
within well supported putative transcription factor binding motifs, supporting the assumption that SNPs in
transcription factor binding sites may lead to differences
in gene expression with significant potential to increase
phenotypic diversity. This gene region is a potential target for gene-assisted selection to improve meat quality.
However, validation of these associations in independent
populations is key before their practical application.
Additional future studies could focus on expression analysis to demonstrate the functional role of the identified
promoter variation.
Methods
Identification of the transcription start site of the bovine
ankyrin 1 gene

Most of the sequences available in the NCBI and
Ensembl databases shared little to no consensus concerning the size of the 5’ UTR region of the ankyrin 1
gene or of a transcription start site (TSS). Hence, the
TSS of the muscle ANK1 gene was determined by 5’
RACE-PCR.
Tissue samples and RNA extraction

M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (striploin) samples
were taken from 3 slaughter-weight commercial beef
animals within one hour post slaughter in an EUlicensed abattoir. Tissue samples (2 g each) were homogenised and preserved in 10 ml RNAlater® (Ambion, Inc.
Austin, TX). Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of
the preserved bovine muscle tissue using TRI Reagent®
(Molecular Research Centre, Inc. USA), following the
supplier’s protocol. The RNA was then dissolved in
40 μl of 0.1% DEPC treated water and then subjected to
deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) treatment (QIAGEN Ltd.,
West Sussex, UK). Purification of RNA was carried out
using the universal phenol-chloroform method. The
RNA pellet was finally resolvated in 40 μl of nucleasefree water. Quality and quantity of the total RNA was
assessed on a 1.2% agarose gel and on a NanoDrop®
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific

Page 10 of 14

Inc. MA, USA), respectively. Samples with an A260/280
ratio 1.7 ≤ 2.0 were selected for further examination.
RNA was aliquoted and stored at -80°C prior to cDNA
synthesis.
5’ end cDNA synthesis and amplification of the 5’ end cDNA
region

5’ end cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA
using a GeneRacer™Kit (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego,
CA, USA) according to supplier’s protocols. 5’ cDNA
was synthesized from modified RNA using Superscript™III first-strand synthesis system using oligo(dT)20 primer with 1.0 μl of total RNA in a final reaction volume
of 20 μl using the Superscript™ III First-strand synthesis
system for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Invitrogen Corp.). GeneRacer Oligo dT
primer with oligo (dT)24 with the anchor sequence was
used to reverse transcribe the mRNA. A gene specific
primer (ANK1E2; reverse: 5’-CTG CCC TCA GAA
AGC TGG TA-3’, btau_4.0; chr27: 39,084,536 39,084,476, minus strand) [GenBank: NC_007328.3] was
designed based on the ANK1 bovine genomic DNA
sequence to amplify different sizes of cDNA fragment
from the total RNA extracted. The single-stranded
cDNAs were amplified using the 5’ adaptor primer (Forward 5’-CGA CTG GAG CAC GAG GAC ACT GA-3’)
(Invitrogen Corp.). High fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen
Corp.) was used for the PCR in a total volume of 25 ml
and the conditions were as follows: initial denaturation
at 94°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
(94°C 30 s), annealing (56°C for 30 s) and extension
(68°C for 30 s) with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
PCR products were visualized on a 1.2% agarose gel.
Cloning of the extracted 5’end RACE cDNA fragments
was achieved by using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp.). cDNAs were ligated into pCR®4-TOPO
plasmid followed by transformation into TOP10 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen Corp.). Single colonies were
transferred to cell culture plate containing 10 ml LB
medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml ampicillin (SigmaAldrich Corp., USA) and grown overnight at 37°C, 140 r.
p.m. Small aliquots of the overnight cell cultures of
recovered colonies were plated at limiting dilution in 15
ml LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA
was purified using the GenElute™ Plasmid Purification kit
(Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) according to supplier’s protocol.
30 μl of PCR product was cleaned up using Gen
Elute™PCR clean-up kit (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and quantity of
the purified PCR product was assessed on a 1.2% agarose
gel and on a NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. MA, USA). Randomly
selected 12 plasmid DNAs (200 ng) were sequenced in
both reverse and forward directions to confirm constructs by Eurofins, MWG-Biotech (Edelsberg, Germany).

Animals, DNA preparation and Phenotype
Animals and DNA preparation

Blood samples of unrelated purebred Aberdeen Angus,
Charolais and Limousin bulls (n = 15 per breed) were
taken to determine the base-line level of DNA polymorphisms in purebred beef breeds. M. longissimus
thoracis et lumborum (LTL) and M. semimembranosus
(SM) tissue samples of commercial crossbred cattle (n =
141; the major contributing breeds were Charolais,
Hereford, Limousin, Friesian, Holstein-Friesian and Simmental) were collected from an EU licensed abattoir and
meat quality measured for a number of traits as
described previously [72]. A total of seven meat quality
traits for each muscle type (SM and LTL) were examined, two relating to technological measure of meat
quality i.e. intramuscular fat content and shear force;
and five relating to sensory traits i.e. texture, tenderness,
flavour, juiciness and firmness. DNA was extracted from
muscle and blood using the DNeasy® blood and tissue
kit (QIAGEN Ltd.).
Phenotype

The meat quality data has been analysed and previously
published in detail [70,72,73]. Compositional analysis
was carried out on meat frozen at 14 days post-mortem
and IMF % levels assessed according to a recognised
protocol [74]. The Warner-Bratzler shear force measurement is the most widely accepted instrumental technique to determine the tenderness of meat. WarnerBratzler shear force values represent the amount of
force required to shear a 2.54 cm core of a cooked and
tempered meat sample [75], in this study they are
reported in Newtons (N). The less force (lower N)
required to shear through the meat sample, the more
tender the product. Tenderness, texture, flavour and
firmness measures were carried out by sensory analysis.
The panellists graded tenderness, texture and firmness
on a scale of 1-8, as follows: (tenderness 1 = extremely
tough, 8 = extremely tender; texture: 1 = very poor, 8 =
extremely good; firmness: 1 = extremely mushy, 8 =
extremely firm). Panellists graded flavour and juiciness
in a scale of 1-6, as follows: flavour: 1 = very poor, 6 =
extremely good; juiciness: 1 = very dry, 6 = extremely
juicy. Studies have shown that there is a fairly high, but
not perfect, inverse correlation (-0.72) between WarnerBratzler shear force measurements and sensory tenderness ratings [51]. Samples producing shear force values
of greater than 52.68 Newtons were considered ‘tough’
by sensory panellists [51].

DNA sequencing

In order to amplify 1.11 kb of the bovine ANK1 promoter
two sets of overlapping primers (fragment 1, 702 bp: forward: 5’-CTG AGT GAC TGA GCA CTG TAA TGA-3’,
reverse: 5’-GGT GTT TTT GCT TCT CCA GC-3’
btau_4.0 chr27: 39,125,655 to 39,124,954; fragment 2, 711

reverse: 5’- GTT CCC CAA GTG AAG GTA GC-3’
btau_4.0 chr27: 39,125,196 to 39,124,486, minus strand)
were designed to detect genetic polymorphisms based on
published sequence data [GenBank: NW_001494427.2].
100 ng of genomic DNA was used to generate PCR products in the presence of 200 pM of both forward and
reverse primers. PCR amplifications were performed with
2 μl of the genomic DNA template in a 50 μl final reaction
volume. The PCR reaction consisted of 10 μl 5× PCR buffer, 3 μl 25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl dNTPmix (10 mM of each),
2 μl Primer mix (0.2 μM each of the forward and reverse
primers), 0.4 μl GoTaq® DNA Polymerase (100 U) (PGEM,
Promega Corp. USA). The cycling conditions used were as
follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min followed by
35 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, 56 and 57°C (respectively for
each primer pair) for 45 sec and 72°C for 1 min 20 sec for
followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min for all
fragments. All PCR products were analysed by agarose gel
electrophoresis (1.2%) and ethidium bromide staining and
visualised using the Epi Chemi II Darkroom (UVP,
Upland, CA) equipped with the image analysis program
LabWorks. PCR products were purified prior to sequencing using the QIAGEN PCR purification kit (QIAGEN
Ltd.). Sequencing of the purified PCR product was carried
out by Eurofins, MWG-Biotech. Sequences were aligned
and the data analyzed using MEGA® (Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis) v 4.0 software [76] MEGA4.
SNP validation

Two closely linked SNPs (r2 = 1) (rSNP1 and rSNP5s) and
another SNP (rSNP2) were selected and re-genotyped for
validation purposes using Custom TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA),
in all commercial crossbred and purebred samples. Primers and probes for the assay were designed using Primer
Express and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems.
Each 10 μl PCR reaction consisted of 5 μl mastermix
(TaqMan® genotyping mastermix, Applied Biosystems),
0.25 μl genotyping assay, 2.75 μl dH2O and 2 μl of DNA
(10 ng/μl). The PCR thermal cycling was as follows: initial
denaturing at 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s
and 60°C for 1 min. Thermal cycling was performed using
an ABI PRISM® 7500.

Polymorphism identification and validation

Initially the 1.11 kb promoter region of the ankyrin 1
gene was resequenced in all purebred and crossbred animals. Subsequently, three of the SNPs were validated
using custom Taqman SNP genotyping assays.

Transcriptional effects of regulatory SNPs in the bovine
ANK1 promoter region

To identify SNPs that affect promoter elements, including putative transcription factor binding sites of interest,

Aslan et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:111
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/111

1.11 kb upstream of the ANK1 translation start site were
screened for the presence of putative selective transcription factor binding sites in silico using three prediction
tools (TESS; http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess), TRANSFAC http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?
id=transfac and MatInspector http://www.genomatix.de/

sites already proven to be of significance in regulating
the muscle specific binding sites of bovine and other
common binding sites in mouse and human.
Statistical methods
Allele, Genotype, and Haplotype Frequencies, LD

Estimation of allele frequencies and departures from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were carried out
using the population genetic data analysis software Haploview [77]. Linkage disequilibrium measures were also
estimated using Haploview. Following haplotype inference, the ELB algorithm was used to assign the most
likely haplotype combination to an individual as implemented in the Arlequin program [78].
Association analysis

Evaluation of association between the seven SNPs and
values of meat quality traits for each individual SNP in
the crossbred population (n = 141) were carried out
using the least squares method of the GLM (General
Linear Model) procedure in SAS (Version 9.1, SAS Inst.,
Inc., Cary, NC, 2002-2003). A number of covariates (sex,
age, carcass weight, slaughter period, and slaughter factory) were included in the model to control for potentially confounding factors. Five ANK1 regulatory SNPs
with MAF >0.1 were tested for associations with meat
quality traits. Where significant associations were identified, mean trait values for each genotype were contrasted using the Tukey-Kramer procedure in SAS. In
order to evaluate the association of individual alleles
with meat quality, the four most common haplotypes of
the crossbred population (frequencies of more than
10%) were also tested in separate GLM models including the same covariates as the single SNP analyses. Each
analysis tested for a difference in least squares means of
meat quality traits where 0, 1 or 2 copies of each haplotype were present. Tukey-Kramer analysis was also
carried out for significant associations. A Bonferroniadjusted P-value was calculated for individual SNP and
haplotype analyses.
