Abstract
Background: Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) has emerged as a leading molecular typing
method owing to its high ability to discriminate among bacterial isolates, the relative ease with
which data acquisition and analysis can be standardized, and the high portability of the resulting
sequence data. While MLST has been successfully applied to the study of the population structure
for a number of different bacterial species, it has also provided compelling evidence for high rates
of recombination in some species. We have analyzed a set of Campylobacter jejuni strains using MLST
and Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) on a full-genome microarray in order to
determine whether recombination and high levels of genomic mosaicism adversely affect the
inference of strain relationships based on the analysis of a restricted number of genetic loci.
Results: Our results indicate that, in general, there is significant concordance between strain
relationships established by MLST and those based on shared gene content as established by CGH.
While MLST has significant predictive power with respect to overall genome similarity of isolates,
we also found evidence for significant differences in genomic content among strains that would
otherwise appear to be highly related based on their MLST profiles.
Conclusion: The extensive genomic mosaicism between closely related strains has important
implications in the context of establishing strain to strain relationships because it suggests that the
exact gene content of strains, and by extension their phenotype, is less likely to be "predicted"
based on a small number of typing loci. This in turn suggests that a greater emphasis should be
placed on analyzing genes of clinical interest as we forge ahead with the next generation of
molecular typing methods.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute
bacterial enteritis worldwide [1,2]. Despite significant
progress in recent years, critical gaps remain in our understanding of C. jejuni pathogenesis. The lack of a welldefined set of virulence determinants makes it difficult to
assess the virulence potential of different strains or to
make links between specific genotypes and specific disease manifestations. Similarly, because the majority of
infections are sporadic, sources and routes of transmission remain unclear in most cases of campylobacteriosis
[3].
Significant effort has been placed on the development of
methods for the typing of C. jejuni based on the analysis
of polymorphic DNA targets and that have been applied
to the study of species diversity and in the context of epidemiology and surveillance [4,5]. The large number of
competing approaches is a reflection on the fact that different methods may be appropriate for investigating
short-term outbreak investigations (i.e. local epidemiology) and/or large-scale longitudinal surveillance (i.e. global epidemiology) [6]. Multi-locus sequence typing or
MLST [7,8], which is based on the analysis of DNA
sequence polymorphisms in a group of housekeeping
genes, has recently emerged as a strong contender for a
genotyping "gold standard" for C. jejuni on the strength of
several features. These include: a high discriminative
power; ease of standardization of data acquisition and
analysis across laboratories, and the high portability of
the resulting sequence data [4,9].
MLST benefits from a well-established framework for the
phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. This has
led to the suggestion that the phylogenetic signal contained within the loci analysed by MLST could be successfully used for long-term tracking in population structure
studies, global epidemiology and long-term surveillance
[10]. However, two outstanding questions need to be
addressed in light of emerging data from comparative
genomic analyses of C. jejuni. First, C. jejuni is naturally
transformable and takes up homologous DNA readily
[11], leading to high rates of intraspecies recombination
[12,13] that could distort the genetic relationships
inferred from any one genetic locus. Second, a potential
weakness which MLST shares with most genotyping
approaches is that strain relatedness is inferred based on a
very limited sub-sampling of the entire genome [5,14].
This becomes increasingly relevant given the extensive
genomic diversity that has been observed in intraspecies
comparisons of C. jejuni through whole genome sequencing [15] and whole-genome microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) [16-20].
MCGH has recently been successfully applied to the
examination of gene conservation dynamics and to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/229

investigation of strain to strain relationships based on
whole-genome gene conservation profiles [21]. In this
study, we have analyzed a set of strains using both MLST
and MCGH in order to assess whether the strain relationships inferred from the seven loci interrogated by MLST
are consistent with the phylogenetic signal obtained from
the analysis of whole-genome comparative genomic data.

Results
Description of isolate relationships determined by MLST
In order to evaluate relationships among isolates, all 45
strains in this study were analyzed by MLST (Figure 1).
The strains were selected from a larger dataset analyzed by
MLST and were picked to comprise several levels of
genetic similarity, thus enabling us to determine whether
relationships assessed by MLST would be supported by
CHG data in the short-term vs. long-term epidemiological
context.

The dataset contained representatives from 25 distinct
Sequence Types (STs) with 8 STs containing multiple
strains. BURST analysis identified two main lineages,
clonal complexes ST-21 and ST-45, which figured prominently in the dataset. The strains from the ST-21 complex
include strains of the ST-21, Single Locus Variants (SLVs)
(ST-50, ST-53, and ST-262), and Double Locus Variants
(DLVs) (ST-43 and ST-184). The ST-45 complex includes
strains of the ST-45 and SLVs (ST-25 and ST-241).
A subset of strains with the ST-474, which was originally
placed in the ST-21 complex based on preliminary BURST
analysis on the strength of matches at 5 of the 7 typing
loci, was subsequently re-assigned to the ST-48 complex
based on lineage assignments obtained from the C. jejuni
MLST database, which is based on a much larger dataset
including data on over 3000 strains. The ST-48 complex
includes strains with the ST-48, SLVs (ST-474) and a Triple
Locus Variant (TLV) (ST-475). In addition to the strains
from ST-21, ST-45, and ST-48 complexes, groups of strains
with identical STs were found from three additional
clonal complexes (ST-353, ST-354, and ST-403). The
remaining 10 strains did not belong to any of the ST complexes represented in the dataset and shared at most 3 of
7 MLST alleles with their closest matches.
Analysis of isolate relationships determined by MCGH
In order to assess strain-to-strain relationships based on
genome similarity, gene conservation profiles derived
from CGH data were used to quantify genomic similarity
and this data was then used as a measure of the genetic
distance between strains. Hierarchical clustering of the
strains was performed on the resulting distance matrix of
all pair wise distances between strains and bootstrap analysis revealed seven statistically robust clusters of strains
(Figure 2) which were highly concordant with those

obtained by hierarchical clustering of microarray profiles
using the Pearson correlation metric (results not shown).
Cluster I can be further divided into 5 sub-types with significant differences in gene content: clusters Ia and Ib
include the reference genome strain NCTC 11168 and six
other strains with a very small number of genes displaying
"significant Log Ratio differences" (SLRDs) with respect to
NCTC 11168. These SLRDs correspond to likely gene
divergence/gene absence events with respect to the reference strain. The three additional strains in cluster Ia have
an average of 12.0 SLRDs whereas strains in cluster Ib
have an average of 14.3 SLRDs. Strains in clusters Ic, Id,

and Ie have an increasing number of differences with
respect to the reference strain (an average of 37.3 SLRDs),
although the majority of these are concentrated within
four genetic loci: a region spanning Cj0968 to Cj0972 in
cluster Ie; the lipo-oligosaccharide biosynthesis locus or
LOS (Cj1136-Cj 1146c) in clusters Id and Ie; the capsular
polysaccharide biosynthesis locus or CPS (Cj1414cCj1449) in clusters Ic, Id, and Ie; and a Type I restriction/
modification locus or R-M (Cj1549-Cj1560) in cluster Ie.
Strains from clusters II to VII have an average number of
SLRDs with respect to the reference strain that range from
64.5 for cluster IV to 97.9 for cluster V. The distribution

and prevalence of various SLRDs across the genome varies
substantially for each group, although the bulk can be
found within the various hyper-variable loci previously
described in C. jejuni [18,19]. For example: only strains
from clusters I and II appear to have a fully conserved (i.e.
lacking in SLRDs) region spanning Cj0480 to Cj0490;
only strains from cluster V have SLRDs in the region spanning Cj0727 and Cj0741; only strains from clusters I, III
and IV lack SLRDs within the Type I restriction/modification locus. It thus appears that the various clusters of

strains are characterized by unique patterns of conserved
genes at hyper-variable loci.
Comparison of MCGH versus MLST-derived isolate
relationships
When results of MCGH-based clustering were compared
to the results obtained by MLST-based clustering and
BURST analysis (Figure 2) we found that, with a few
exceptions, the statistically robust groups obtained from
CGH analysis correspond to groups of strains of identical

sequence type. For example, strains in cluster Ia are largely
of ST-21; strains from cluster 1b are largely of ST-53;
strains from cluster 1d are of ST-262; strains from cluster
II are of ST-354; strains from cluster IV are of ST-5; strains
from cluster V are of ST-45; strains from cluster VII are of
ST-403. In general, the congruence observed between
CGH and MLST profiles also extends to strains within the
same clonal complex (i.e. defined by sharing at least 4
loci) since strains with similar CGH profiles tend to share
multiple MLST alleles. For example, strains in clusters Ia,

An inspection of local gene conservation patterns shows
that strains from the same ST tend to share attributes that
are nearly exclusive to the group (Figure 3). For example,
whereas the ten strains with ST-45 have SLRDs at Cj0057
and Cj0058, this specific pattern is observed in only 5 of
the remaining 35 strains in the dataset. Similarly, the pat-

Shared genomic attributes in strains from the same MLST clonal complex
Shared genomic attributes in strains from the same MLST clonal complex. The strains of ST-45 show significant differences in gene conservation rates at the loci shown in the first column with respect to all other strains in the dataset and differentiate this group of genetically related strains from other groups of strains.

tern found among ST-45 strains in the region from Cj0177
to Cj0181 is found in only 7 of the remaining strains in
the dataset. Other genomic regions where SLRDs are
found almost exclusively among ST-45 strains are the
multi-gene loci spanning Cj0296c to Cj0299, Cj0617Cj0618, Cj0727 to Cj0733, and eight other single-gene
loci (Cj0030, Cj0380c, Cj0690c, Cj0753c, Cj0794,
Cj1305, Cj1585c, Cj1668c). A small number of genes
(Cj0246c, Cj0859c, Cj0860, and Cj0970) appear to be
fully conserved in all ST-45 strains but have SLRDs in a
number of strains in the remainder of the dataset. More
broadly, such differences in gene content can be used to
differentiate the various CGH clusters and ST complexes.
Although our data suggests that strains with similar MLST
profiles share similar CGH profiles, we have also found
evidence for strains with significant levels of genomic similarity despite sharing few or none of the alleles used for
MLST. For example, strain GBS_PG836 shows high overall
genome similarity to the strains in the ST-48 complex
(Cluster Ie) despite having different alleles at 4 of 7 MLST
loci. In an extreme example, strains NCTC_13260 and
NCTC_13261 show significant congruence in overall
CGH profiles despite sharing no mutual alleles at any of
the seven MLST loci. Thus, despite the fact that similarity
in MLST profiles is generally a good predictor for genomic
similarity, it is not always indicative of overall genome
similarity between strains.
Genomic heterogeneity within groups of strains with the
same MLST sequence type
Although genetic relatedness is reflected by shared gene
content and high similarity in overall CGH profiles, when
global and local gene conservation profiles are examined it
is also possible to observe significant differences in gene
content between strains of the same CGH cluster/clonal
complex, particularly within hyper-variable genomic loci.
For example, an examination of the strains in the ST-45
complex reveals that each strain appears to contain a heterogeneous mixture of conserved and divergent/absent
genes and thus a "mosaic" pattern of gene conservation is
apparent even among strains with high overall genomic
similarity that are members of the same MLST clonal complex (Figure 4a, 4b). Although, on average, strains from the
ST-45 complex have more SLRDs with respect to other
strains in the dataset (μ = 93 ± 13), they bear a significant
number of SLRDs with respect to one another (μ = 65 ±
14). Similar observations can be made for the strains in the
ST-354 complex (μ = 83 ± 15 vs. μ = 35 ± 15). [For a complete set of all pair-wise SLRDs consult Additional file 1]

To examine whether these apparent mosaic patterns of
gene content do not merely represent an artifact of the
MCGH technique, we examined and visualized gene conservation patterns of various hyper-variable loci among
newly sequenced C. jejuni genomes (Figure 4c). This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/229

examination revealed that the hypervariable loci in these
strains have highly heterogeneous gene content with conserved and absent/divergent genes interspersed, a pattern
that is consistent with our microarray-CGH data.
Disruption of genetic linkage in a genomic region flanked
by two MLST loci
We have exploited the relatively close proximity between
two MLST loci in combination with microarray-derived
comparative genomic data to examine genetic linkage in
C. jejuni. The tkt (Cj1645) and gltA (Cj1682c) loci are
located approximately 36 Kb apart in the C. jejuni NCTC
11168 genome and variability has been observed in several genes contained within the region flanked by these
two genes [19]. We thus set out to examine whether we
could find evidence for an association between specific
allele combinations of tkt and gltA and gene conservation
profiles in the intervening region among members of the
same clonal complex. Although it is possible to observe
similar gene conservation profiles for members of the
same clonal complex sharing the same tkt-gltA allele combinations (data not shown), some genomic heterogeneity
is also apparent (Figure 5).

Discussion
Multi-locus Sequence Typing (MLST) has emerged as a
leading molecular typing method for examining strain
relationships which has been effectively applied to a
number of different bacterial species [10], including C.
jejuni [7,22]. Although MLST has been successfully
applied to the study of the population structure of the C.
jejuni it has also, paradoxically, provided compelling evidence that C. jejuni populations are subject to high rates
of horizontal genetic exchange, with recombinational
events contributing to a significant proportion of the
allelic diversity observed [12,13].
The effects of high rates of intraspecies recombination
observed include: a) conflicting phylogenetic signal
obtained from different genes due to their different evolutionary trajectories, and b) a panmictic population structure for which clonal evolution is not the predominant
trend. Both of these effects could pose limitations on the
reliability of genetic relationships inferred from one or a
small number of molecular markers as this small number
of loci could themselves be subject to recombination. We
have used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (MCGH) to analyze a collection of strains for
which MLST analysis suggests varying levels of genetic
relatedness. The dataset also includes clonal clusters comprised of strains with and without apparent epidemiological links in order to provide a "whole-genome" context for
examining strain relationships inferred from MLST data.
An interesting finding from this study is the fact that global patterns of gene conservation obtained by MCGH are

An examination of genomic mosaicism within clonal complex ST-45. Although strains within ST-45 have similar
overall CGH profiles (A), significant genomic heterogeneity can be observed across various hyper-variable loci in the C. jejuni
genome (B). Mosaicism observed in the CGH data is consistent with that observed in newly sequenced C. jejuni genomes (C).
(note: Log Ratio data in (A) and (B) and sequence identity data in (C) were colour coded using a common scale reflecting the
likelihood of gene presence/absence).

An examination of genetic linkage in groups of genetically related strains

among members the same CC that share the same tkt-gltA loci.
well correlated to MLST data. We have found that the
robust clusters predicted by MCGH analysis (> 75% bootstrap support) and by MLST analysis (clonal complexes
sharing 4 or more alleles) display excellent agreement
(Figure 3). Of the 35 strains in our dataset that fall within
six MLST clonal complexes only 4 fail to cluster robustly
within a corresponding CGH cluster. Similarly, of the 37
strains that form statistically robust CGH clusters only 3
lack support from MLST data. Although the relationship
between MLST genotypes and global-gene conservation
profiles might be expected for strains with shared epidemiology, surprisingly this relationship appears to be evident for strains that do not share an obvious
epidemiological connection. It is worth noting that the
dendograms obtained for this dataset from the phylogenetic analysis of individual MLST loci are largely incongruent with one another (data not shown), likely due to
recombination at the various alleles. Overall congruence
between gene content and MLST has recently been
observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, another highly
recombinogenic species [23]. In this light, the high degree
of congruence between MLST and CGH data is not surprising and suggests that the multilocus approach appears
to significantly mitigate the effects of lateral exchange in
the examination of strain relationships.

It is important to stress that congruence between global
gene conservation patterns and MLST genotypes does not
preclude significant differences in gene content between
related strains. Although, as expected, gene content differences tend to be highest between unrelated strains with
greatest genetic distance (i.e. based on analysis of the
MLST loci), our data provides evidence for significant
genomic mosaicism between closely related strains
through the accumulation of gene content differences.
Thus, while related strains may share an increased number
of genomic features, including a similar profile of significant SLRDs at any of a number of hyper-variable loci
spread throughout the genome, their specific gene content
in terms of absent and divergent genes may differ considerably. Although the widespread extent of this mosaic pattern of gene content might appear to be an artefact of the
CGH technique we have employed in our analysis, evidence from comparative genomic sequencing would suggest otherwise. For example, mosaic patterns of gene
conservation have been previously observed at a number
of hyper-variable loci (LOS: [24,25]; CPS: [26]; and RM:
[27]). Similarly, our preliminary examination of additional hyper-variable loci among newly sequenced C.
jejuni genomes (Figure 5c) has yielded similar observations. An examination of the genomic region bracketed by
the MLST loci tkt and gltA also demonstrates that genomic
Page 8 of 12

events altering local gene conservation profiles can occur
among members of the same clonal complex that share
the same alleles at these loci (Figure 5), implying that
great care must be made in extrapolating the gene content
of strains based on indirect observations made at a different set of genetic loci.
A common theme among comparative sequencing studies
is the suggestion that recombination is a potent driving
force shaping the gene conservation patterns of hyper-variable loci of C. jejuni through events such as allelic replacements, gene fusions, gene duplications and gene
deletions. Analysis of MLST allele patterns further suggests
that housekeeping loci are also targeted by recombination
[12,13]. It thus appears that recombinational exchange in
C. jejuni is not only widespread but that it must occur at
significant frequencies consistent with the rapid accumulation of gene content differences we have observed
among closely related strains in this study.

Conclusion
Although our data suggest that reliable strain relationships can be inferred despite the rapid pace of genetic
change due to recombination, our ability to couple
molecular typing data to phenotypes of interest (e.g. virulence, drug resistance) may be restricted by the shifting
gene content among related strains. An advantage of
molecular characterization methods based on the comparison of gene content is illustrated by our recent analysis of C. jejuni strains implicated in Guillain-Barré and
Miller Fisher syndromes [28]. Neuropathogenic C. jejuni
have been highly refractory to analysis by conventional
molecular typing because of their diverse lineage and due
to the lack of association between conventional molecular
typing markers and their clinical phenotype [29].
Although our whole-genome CGH analysis merely confirmed earlier observations regarding the population
structure of neuropathogenic strains, it correctly identified
a small number of genes whose presence among strains of
diverse lineage is though to be highly correlated with a
neuropathic clinical outcome [28].
The rapid assessment of neuropathogenic potential of
strains has since been achieved by the directly targeting
polymorphisms within the genes of interest [30]. Ultimately, the development of clinically relevant molecular
typing approaches may be better served by comparative
genomic methods that directly survey the genetic differences responsible for the phenotypes of interest rather
than through indirect evidence from comparison of
molecular typing targets unrelated to phenotype

Methods
Bacterial strains
Background on the 45 strains we analyzed by microarray
CGH and MLST is presented in Table 1. The strains were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/229

selected from a larger dataset analyzed by MLST and
picked to comprise several levels of genetic similarity,
which would thus enable us to determine whether relationships assessed by MLST would be supported by CHG
data in the short-term vs. long-term epidemiological context. Strains were picked to comprise several levels of
genetic similarity, which would thus enable us to determine whether relationships assessed by MLST would be
supported by CHG data.
DNA isolation
Cells were grown on Mueller-Hinton agar plates (BACTO,
Oakville, ON) for 36 hours at 42°C under microaerophilic conditions prior to genomic DNA isolation.
Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol:chloroform extraction as previously described [19]. For MLST, genomic
DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Mississauga, ON) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Microarray Hybridizations
Details of the microarray, including primer selection, the
parameters for primer synthesis, selection of amplicons,
as well as the purification and printing of DNA onto slides
were previously described elsewhere [19]. Hybridizations
were performed using protocols described previously
[31]. Briefly, for each tester strain equivalent amounts of
Cy-3 labelled tester and Cy-5 labelled control genomic
DNAs (i.e. strain NCTC 11168) with similar dye incorporation efficiencies were pooled and co-hybridized to our
microarray.
Microarray data acquisition and analysis
Microarrays were scanned using a Chipreader laser scanner (BioRad, Mississauga, ON) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Spot quantification, visual
inspection of potential outliers, and flagging of anomalous spots was performed using the program ArrayPro
Analyzer (version 4.5; Media Cybernetics). The microarray data exported from ArrayPro was imported into the
BioArray Software Environment (BASE version 1.2) [32]
and is available at NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus [33]
under accession number GSE9919. Spots flagged due to
poor spot morphology or low signal intensity (less than 3
X local background) were filtered out. After print-tip Loess
normalization, data was used to calculate the average Log
Ratio or LR (i.e. log2 [Signal Tester/Signal Control]) from
the two replicates for each gene represented on the microarray. The filtered data exported from BASE contains the
average LR data for 1606 genes.
MCGH data analysis and visualization
LR data was visualized and analyzed in TIGR's MultiExperiment Viewer (MEV version 3.0) [34] with high-resolution heat maps of LR data generated using a custom-script
written in VBA for MS-Excel; all CGH data was organized

assuming synteny with C. jejuni NCTC 11168 in order to
examine mapping of variable genes to genomic regions.
Clustering of strains based on LR profile similarities was
performed by the average linkage hierarchical clustering
method [35], as implemented in TMEV, using Pearson
correlation coefficient as a distance metric with the Support Tree method of bootstrapping implemented in TMEV
used to test the reliability of the clustering patterns (500
bootstrap re-samplings). A second method for clustering
strains was developed based on calculating pair-wise

genetic similarities in gene conservation profiles by using
trinary thresholding of LR data [31], with a score of 1
given to all gene conservation matches (i.e. conserved,
divergent of absent in both strains), a score of 0.5 given to
absent/divergent pairs, and a score of 0 given to all other
mismatches. The genetic similarity was then calculated by
dividing the total score of all genes in the array by the total
possible score. A custom VBA script for MS-Excel was written to calculate all pair-wise genetic distances (i.e. genetic
distance = 1 – genetic similarity) and to calculate bootPage 10 of 12

strapped distance matrices which were used to create a
consensus tree using the programs Neighbor and Consense from the phylogenetic inference package Phylip
v.3.6 [36]. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using
Treeview v.1.6.6 [37].
MLST analysis
MLST was performed using the methods of Dingle et al.
[7,22]. PCR amplification of the seven target genes was
performed using primers described in the references
above. Amplicons were purified with the Qiaquick column purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) followed
by Autoseq-96 (Molecular Dynamics). Sequencing was
performed using the MegaBACE Long Read Matrix (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and reaction products were separated on a
MegaBACE 500 sequencer (GE Health Care, Piscataway,
NJ). Sequence traces were analyzed using the MegaBACE
software. MLST alleles and sequence types (ST) were determined for each strain by querying the C. jejuni MLST database at the University of Oxford [38] with the edited
sequence data. Dendrograms based on the MLST sequence
types were obtained using the method of unweighted pair
group with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) implemented in
the program START2 version 0.5.10 [39]. BURST analysis
[40], as implemented in START2, was used to identify
potential clonal complexes composed of strains sharing 5
or more identical alleles. Additional clonal complex
assignments were determined by querying the C. jejuni
MLST database with the allelic profiles of the strains.
Analysis of gene conservation patterns in newly sequenced
C. jejuni genomes
Available sequence data from completed (strains NCTC
11168, RM1221, 81–176) and ongoing C. jejuni sequencing projects (strains 84–25, HB93-13, 260.94, 269.97,
CF93-6) was obtained from NCBI's prokaryotic genome
sequencing resource [41] and homology searching of
genes in selected loci was performed using the program
BLASTP [42]. Visualization of sequence identity levels was
performed via heat maps generated using a custom-script
written in VBA for MS-Excel.
