Abstract
Background: The pattern-forming bacterium Paenibacillus vortex is notable for its advanced social behavior, which
is reflected in development of colonies with highly intricate architectures. Prior to this study, only two other
Paenibacillus species (Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and Paenibacillus larvae) have been sequenced. However, no genomic
data is available on the Paenibacillus species with pattern-forming and complex social motility. Here we report the
de novo genome sequence of this Gram-positive, soil-dwelling, sporulating bacterium.
Results: The complete P. vortex genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using 454 Life Sciences and
Illumina, achieving a total of 289× coverage, with 99.8% sequence identity between the two methods. The
sequencing results were validated using a custom designed Agilent microarray expression chip which represented
the coding and the non-coding regions. Analysis of the P. vortex genome revealed 6,437 open reading frames
(ORFs) and 73 non-coding RNA genes. Comparative genomic analysis with 500 complete bacterial genomes
revealed exceptionally high number of two-component system (TCS) genes, transcription factors (TFs), transport
and defense related genes. Additionally, we have identified genes involved in the production of antimicrobial
compounds and extracellular degrading enzymes.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that P. vortex has advanced faculties to perceive and react to a wide range of
signaling molecules and environmental conditions, which could be associated with its ability to reconfigure and
replicate complex colony architectures. Additionally, P. vortex is likely to serve as a rich source of genes important
for agricultural, medical and industrial applications and it has the potential to advance the study of social
microbiology within Gram-positive bacteria.

Background
Paenibacillus vortex strain V453 [1] is a bacterial species
discovered in the early 90’s [2]. It is a social microorganism that forms colonies with remarkably complex and
dynamic architectures (Figure 1) [2-4]. The genus Paenibacillus, including P. vortex, was originally considered a
part of the genus Bacillus but was later reclassified as a
separate genus in 1993 [5]. These facultative anaerobic,
spore-forming bacteria are found in a variety of

heterogeneous environments, such as soil, rhizosphere,
insect larvae, and clinical samples [6-9].
To face the challenges posed by these environments,
Paenibacillus spp. produce a wealth of enzymes and
proteases as well as a great variety of antimicrobial substances that affect a wide range of microorganisms
[10-12]. The possession of these advanced defensive and
offensive strategies render the Paenibacillus spp.
bacteria as a rich source of useful genes for agricultural,
medical, industrial applications. Despite this potential,
genome sequencing of Paenibacillus spp. to date is limited and is currently available only for two species Paenibacillus larvae and Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2.

A successful behavioral strategy utilized by some Paenibacillus spp. is to cooperatively form and develop
large and intricately organized colonies of 109-1012 cells.
Being part of a large cooperative, the bacteria can better
compete for food resources and be protected against
antibacterial assaults [3,13]. Two of the most fascinating
pattern-forming Paenibacillus spp. bacteria, are P. vortex
[3,14] and P. dendritiformis [3,15]. Under laboratory
growth conditions, these bacteria can develop, like other

social bacteria, colonies that behave much like a multicellular organism, with cell differentiation and task distribution [16-19] (see also Additional file 1 section I).
P. vortex possesses advanced social motility employing
cell-cell attractive and repulsive chemotactic signaling
and physical links (Additional file 1 section I). When
grown on soft surfaces, the collective motility is
reflected by the formation of foraging swarms [14] that
act as arms sent out in search for food (Additional file 1

Sirota-Madi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:710

section I and Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). These swarms
have an aversion to crossing each other’s trail and collectively change direction when food is sensed. The
swarms can even split and reunite when detecting scattered patches of nutrients [14].
When grown on hard surfaces, P. vortex generates
special aggregates of dense bacteria that are pushed forward by repulsive chemotactic signals sent from the
cells at the back (see Additional file 1 section I). These
rotating aggregates (termed vortices), are similar to the
rotating bacteria groups generated by Paenibacillus alvei
[20] and Bacillus circulans [21], pave the way for the
colony to expand. The vortices serve as building blocks
of colonies with special modular organization (Figure 1
and Additional file 1 section I).
Accomplishing such intricate cooperative ventures
requires sophisticated cell-cell communication
[3,19,22-24]. Communicating with each other, bacteria
exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic
and epigenetic adjustments [25]. The bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed
information processing to glean and assess relevant
information [3,19,25]. Next, the bacteria respond
accordingly, by reshaping the colony while redistributing
tasks and cell differentiations, and turning on defense
and offense mechanisms [3,16-19,25,26], thus achieving
better adaptability to heterogeneous environments [3].
Such collective, decentralized, adaptive decision making
is a form of swarm intelligence, a term originally derived
from cybernetics but applicable to some aspects of colonial organisms including ants, birds, humans and bacteria [27-29]. In terms of collective social behaviour,
P. vortex has been studied extensively at the level of
mathematical modeling [3,30-32] and now requires a
sequenced genome to connect this approach with the
underlying genetics.
Comparative genomic analysis revealed that bacteria
successful in heterogeneous and competitive environments often contain extensive signal transduction and
regulatory networks [33-35]. It is likely that advanced
social behavior [19] and elevated collective adaptability
[3] are underpinned by a highly developed signal transduction system consisting of modular domains forming
a network of sensors, transducers and responders
[34,36,37].
In this report we present the de novo genome
sequence of the P. vortex, which was obtained by utilizing a hybrid deep-sequencing approach using 454 and
Illumina techniques [38,39]. We further performed
detailed comparative genomic analysis with a dataset of
500 complete bacterial genomes to discover P. vortex
unique properties. The results revealed that P. vortex

Page 4 of 16

has one of the highest number of signal transduction
genes among all the Gram-positive bacteria in the
dataset. Only two other Gram-positive bacteria strains,
the Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and the Geobacillus sp.
Y412MC10, have more TCS genes. These two species
and P. vortex have equal normalized combined score
of TCS, TFs, transport and defense related genes (see
material and methods), which is significantly higher
than the combined score of all other bacteria in the
data set.
The analysis also unveiled genes required for competition over resources (e.g. iron, amino acids and sugars),
for producing offensive compounds (antibiotics and lytic
enzymes) and for defense (resistance to antibiotics and
other toxins). These genes can support traits needed for
thriving in the heterogeneous and highly competitive
environments.

Results
Sequencing of the P. vortex genome
Hybrid assembly

De novo assembly of the P. vortex genome was
obtained using the two leading deep-sequencing technologies: Roche 454 Genome Sequencer (GS 20) [40]
and Illumina Genome Analyzer (GA) [41]. Using the
Roche 454 and the Illumina GA technologies, 19×
coverage of single reads and 270× total average coverage of single and paired-end mapped reads was produced respectively (Table 1). The reads from each
technology were first assembled separately and then
joined into a hybrid assembly to improve scaffold size
and quality (Additional file 1 section II). The hybrid
assembly (Additional file 1 Figure S6) contains 56
scaffolds totaled 6,385,925 bp with N50 scaffold size
of 213,399 bp and largest scaffold of 699,613 bp.
Notably, the contigs from the two technologies could
be joined easily as no miss-assemblies were detected
between the two sets of contigs. The first version of
the Whole Genome Shotgun project described in this
paper has been deposited at [GenBank: ADHJ00
000000].

Assembly accuracy and completeness

To estimate the accuracy and the completeness of the
hybrid assembly we performed detailed comparison
between the 454 and the Illumina contigs. The results
show that the 454 contigs covered 99.93% of the hybrid
assembly with an average distance between contigs comprising the hybrid scaffolds of -5 bp and total 890 bp
missing from the hybrid assembly (Additional file 1
Figure S6 B, C, D). The Illumina contigs covered 99.81%
of the hybrid assembly with average distance between
contigs of -10 bp and missing total 4,500 bp (Additional
file 1 Table S3). The overall sequence identity between
the two technologies was 99.8%. These results and the
fact that there were no miss-assemblies demonstrate
that although the P. vortex assembly is in several contigs, it provides complete genome coverage and with an
extremely high accuracy (Additional file 1 section II).
Scaffolds ordering

To obtain a putative order of the P. vortex scaffolds, we
used Geobacillus. sp. Y412MC10 genome [Refseq:
NC_013406] as a reference and ordered the P. vortex
scaffolds accordingly. Our preliminary genomic comparison identified Geobacillus sp. Y412MC10 as the closest
bacteria with a complete genome to P. vortex. The identification was based on phylogenetic analysis of 16 S
rDNA placing the Geobacillus sp. Y412MC10 within the
P. vortex clade (Figure 2A) and further supported by
genomic clustering of Cluster of Orthologous Groups
(COG) profiles [42,43] (Figure 2B). BLASTn comparison

Y412MC10, revealed that 2/3 of the P. vortex genome
could be matched to Geobacillus sp. Y412MC10 with an
average sequence identity of 86.69% over a mean alignment length of 783 bp (Additional file 1 Figure S7).
General genome statistics

The P. vortex genome is composed of a circular chromosome (6,385,925 bp) with an average G+C content of
48.7% (Figure 3). A total of 6,437 open reading frames
(ORFs) were identified covering 86% of the P. vortex
genome (Table 2). Among the predicted ORFs, 4,475
(70%) were assigned with a putative function, whereas
1,962 (30%) were identified as hypothetical proteins. We
identified 73 non-coding RNA genes and 54 tRNA
genes predicted to incorporate 18 amino acids into polypeptides. The tentative location of the origin of replication (ORI) was identified based on its proximity to
dnaA gene, known to serve as a transcription initiator
protein [44].
Repetitive sequences

We have identified several types of repetitive sequences:
184 global repeats (sequence that is present in at least
two copies in two different locations), 32 local inverted
repeats and 231 tandem repeats within the P. vortex
genome (Figure 3) (for methods see Additional file 1
section VII). Such sequences were suggested to play an
important functional role in genome plasticity [45], by
means of homologous recombination (HR), horizontal
transfer or transposition in the genome [46-48]. HR has
relevant roles in DNA repair, chromosome segregation
and generation of genetic variation. Crossover events

calculated for 25 different bacterial species representing various taxons. The computed Pearson correlation matrix was ordered using the
dendrogram clustering algorithm to identify clusters and was color-coded from dark blue representing very low correlation to dark red
representing very high correlation. The Geobacillus sp. Y412MC10 is clustered with Paenibacillus species (upper left red square) and not with the
rest of the Geobacillus species. Additionally, Paenibacillus larvae is not part of the Paenibacillus cluster.

amount of genetic information [49]. Additionally,
repeats located within regulatory regions might constitute an on/off switch of gene expression at the transcriptional level [50]. Similarly, repeats located within
coding regions can induce a premature ending of translation when a mutation changes the number of repeats
[51]. However, detailed mechanisms and functions of
most repeats are still unknown.
Repetitive sequences are the major reason for the difficulty we encountered in finishing the genome assembly
into a complete sequence. Analysis of the scaffold ends
(100 bp of each end) revealed that 78% of them have repetitive sequences that are on average 37 bp long and could
be mapped on average onto 5 different scaffold ends.
We note that some regions in the P. vortex genome
have an extremely high coverage (see areas marked in

blue, second circle, Figure 3). Although, the assembly
algorithms tend to collapse the highly identical repetitive
sequences into one copy, high coverage in that specific
area might serve as a signature for identifying regions
present in several copy numbers in the genome [52].
For example, the ribosomal unit (16 S, 23 S and 5S) has
approximately 5 times higher coverage than the average,
suggesting that this unit appears approximately 5 times
in the P. vortex genome. Interestingly, the Geobacillus
sp. Y412MC10 has 8 copies of the ribosomal unit.
Functional validation by custom microarray

We used specially designed Agilent custom microarray
submitted to EMBL-EBI [ArrayExpress: E-MEXP-3019]
to validate the annotation. The microarray (Additional
file 1 section IV) includes 105,000 oligos of 60 bp long,
which corresponds to all the predicted ORFs and the
intergenic regions.
Hybridization of the genomic DNA validated 91,324
probes (88%) of the total designed probes and no missed
regions were found (see Additional file 1 section IV for
more details). Hybridization of the pooled RNA from
different growth conditions confirmed 4,701 (73%) of
the predicted ORFs. The remaining 1,736 (27%) ORFs
were not detectable under the tested conditions. Out of
those, 1,064 ORFs have an assigned putative function
and 672 are hypothetical. Hybridization of predicted 73
non-coding RNAs located within the intergenic regions,
confirmed 43 (58%).
Comparative Analysis

We performed detailed comparative analysis between
the P. vortex genome and a set of 500 complete bacterial
genomes of 2-10 Mbp (Additional file 7). Bacterial genomes available with draft sequence were not included in
the analysis. Specifically, we focused on a reduced set of
261 genomes with genome size of 4-8 Mbp (closer to
the P. vortex genome size) and a subset of 50 soil bacteria genomes within this group (Additional file 8). The
comparison was done with regard to four gene systems
which are related to complex bacterial lifestyle and
adaptability to fluctuating environments: two-component systems, transcription factors, defense mechanisms
and transport systems.
Two-component system (TCS)

Using Pfam motifs [53] we identified a total of 210 TCS
related genes in the P. vortex genome; 103 response regulators (RRs), 97 histidine-kinases (HKs) and 10 hybrid
kinases. The number of TCS genes was linear with genome size in agreement with [35]. Among the 500 bacterial genomes, P. vortex was at the upper 1% of the
population (Figure 4A, Additional file 1 Figure S12),
along with two Gram-positive bacteria strains Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (7.08 Mbp) and Geobacillus sp.
Y412MC10 (7.12 Mbp) and two Gram-negative bacteria

Page 7 of 16

strains, the predator myxobacterium M. xanthus (9.13
Mbp) and the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme PCC
73102 (9.05 Mbp). Our results show that similarly to the
absolute gene numbers, the relative gene numbers of the
tested categories in P. vortex genome is also significantly
higher compared to the rest of the 500 genomes (Additional file 1 Figure S11).
Structural classification of the P. vortex RRs according
to previously proposed scheme [54] revealed relatively
high number of 37 OmpR family and 30 AraC family
DNA-binding response regulators. Class organization of
the P. vortex TCS proteins as described in [35] revealed
150 HK-RR paired, 32 orphaned (isolated) and 21 in
complex gene clusters (for more details see Additional
file 1 section VII). Neighborhood analysis of the TCS
surrounding genes revealed that 101 (30%) are transport
related genes, 46 (12.6%) have regulatory functions
(mainly consist of transcription factors), and 35
(9.6%) belong to the energy metabolism category
(mainly employing biosynthesis and degradation of
polysaccharides).
Transcription Factors (TFs)

Using the method described in [55], we identified a total
of 411 TFs in P. vortex genome, which placed it at the
upper 5% of the 500 bacteria set (Figure 4C). This number is considerably higher than the average 158 ± 111
TFs among the 500 bacterial genomes and higher than
the average 208 ± 92 TFs among the subset of 261 genomes with size 4-8 Mbp sizes. Among the subset of 50
soil bacteria genomes, only two strains, Paenibacillus sp.
JDR-2 (7.08 Mbp) and Delftia acidovorans SPH-1
(6.76 Mbp) have a higher number of TFs genes. We
note that an overall linear dependence between the TFs
and the genome size was found (Figure 4C).
Transporter Genes

P. vortex encodes an extensive set of 700 transport
related genes. Among the 500 bacterial genomes, P. vortex was at the upper 1% of the population (Figure 4B),
along with additional five strains Rhizobium leguminobarum bv. viciae (7.75 Mbp), Geobacillus sp. Y412MC10
(7.12 Mbp), Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (7.08 Mbp), Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 (6.7 Mbp) and Sinorhizobium medicae WSM419 (6.8 Mbp). About a third, 258 (35%) of
the genes are involved in carbohydrate transport, 42
genes encode components of iron transporters, 23 genes
encode components of amino acid transporters and 39
genes encode components of oligo/dipeptide transporters. The latter could be used as nutrient sources, as
well as signal molecules regulating bacterial development, virulence, and conjugal plasmid transfer [56].
Defense Mechanisms

The P. vortex genome contains 138 genes related to
resistance against inhibitory substances such as antibiotics, copper, aluminium, arsenic and toxic anions

genes for the dataset of 500 bacterial genomes. (F) Combined score normalized to genome size.

(Figure 4D). The proximity of TCS genes to ABC transporters is known to form specific and efficient detoxification units [37]. Out of the 138 genes, 90 are
transporter-encoding genes. Non-transport related genes
include antibiotic resistance encoding genes such as

penicillin binding proteins, beta-lactames, chloramphenicol posphotransferases/acetyltransferases, vanZ and
vanW glycopeptide antibiotics resistance genes. Apart
from Streptomyces griseus NBRC 13350 (8.54 Mbp), P.
vortex harbors the highest number of defense related

Sirota-Madi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:710
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/710

genes among the 500 analyzed genomes. Additionally, P.
vortex has the highest number of these genes compared
to the subset of 261 genomes with a 4-8 Mbp genome
size (the average for this subset is 60 ± 20).
The combined score

When compiling the four indices into a combined score,
P. vortex and two other Gram-positive bacteria strains,
the Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and the Geobacillus sp.
Y412MC10 stand out among the 500 genomes in the
dataset (Figure 4E). These two species and P. vortex
have equal normalized combined score (Figure 4F),
which is significantly higher than the combined score of
all other bacteria in the dataset.
Motility and Chemotaxis

Upon growth on semi-solid surfaces P. vortex exhibits
at least one form of swarming motility, a flagellum-driven social form of surface locomotion [57-60]. In Figure 5A, we show that propagating P. vortex swarms
can collectively change direction towards organic matter added to an agar plate, and can even split and
reunite when detecting scattered patches of food (see
Additional file 1 section I for more details). We previously showed, using flagellar staining and light
microcopy that swarming P. vortex was peritrichously
flagellated (2 to 8 flagella per μm of cell length, 25 to

Page 9 of 16

30 nm wide and > 5 μm long) [14]. These results are
in agreement with the dimensions measured by scanning electron microscopy (Figure 5B, C, D). Flagellar
motility genes were indentified within the P. vortex
genome. These genes are located within five different
loci, two of which contain the majority of the genes
and are 8.4 kb and 27.1 kb long (Figure 6 and Additional file 1 Figure S13).
Social motility could also be powered by the extension
and retraction of type IV pili [61,62]. P. vortex genome
contains several pili-related genes such as pilZ, pilT, flp
pilus assembly protein and prepilin type IV. However,
we could not identify all the genes known to be involved
in biogenesis and motility of type IV pili [63-65].
Furthermore, the fastest known rate of type IV pili
related movement does not exceed 50 μm/min [66,67],
whereas, P. vortex has an average movement rate of 300
μm/min (data not shown).
Previous studies suggest that the vortices are formed
by attractive interaction between swarming cells which
can be mediated via attractive chemotactic signaling
and/or physical links [3]. The P. vortex genome contains
several chemotaxis related genes, including the cheA,
cheB, cheC, cheD, cheW and cheY. Many of the chemotaxis genes are located within the large motility loci
(Figure 6 and Additional file 1 Figure S14). Additional

orange and green arrows for flagella and chemotaxis related genes respectfully. Genes which are not flagella related are indicated by their
accession number. The map is partial and additional genes such motA, motB and MCPs are present elsewhere in the genome.

16 MCP (methyl-accepting chemotaxis) genes were
found in other locations along the genome.
Sporulation and competence

Formation of spores and uptake of foreign DNA represent an important aspect of bacterial survival strategies.
P. vortex genome encodes an extensive set of 153 genes
responsible for sporulation including cell division,
engulfment, cortex and coat synthesis, maturation and
germination (Additional file 9). The identified sporulation genes included one of the conserved PFAM
domains [53,68], TIGR domains [69], COG categories
[42] or KEGG pathways [70] associated with sporulation
(Additional file 10).
Although, 9 competence-related genes such as comEA,
comer and comEC were identified, they represent only a
small portion of the complete competence pathway
[71-73]. Additionally, we did not identify homologous
genes that belong to the Rap system, which plays an
important role in the cell decision-making between
sporulation and competence [74,75]. It is therefore possible that the common pathway described for sporulation and competence in other Gram-positive bacteria
[76] is different in P. vortex.

involved in polyketide synthesis (Figure 7A); (ii) cluster

siderophore production (Figure 7B) similar to the bacillibactin siderophore produced by Bacillus amylolyquefaciens and Bacillus subtilis [78], and (iii) a hybrid 14
PKS/NRPS gene cluster of 23 kb involved in the production of bacitracin-like antibiotics (Figure 7C).
Antagonistic effects of bacteria directed against competing organisms could also result from the enzymatic
activity of extracellular degrading enzymes. Seven chitinase and four 1,3-beta glucanase encoding genes were
identified in the P. vortex genome. These enzymes are
involved in degradation of polysaccharide components
of the fungal cell wall [79]. Direct tests showed that the
P. vortex can significantly inhibit the growth of Verticillium dahlia, a fungal plant pathogen causing vascular
wilt diseases in a broad range of host plants. This plant
pathogen is distributed in soil worldwide and is of
major threat to agriculture crop production, especially
in temperate areas of the world [80]. P. vortex, which
was inoculated six days after V. dahliae inoculation, to
allow the establishment of healthy fungal colonies, was

Clusters of Multifunctional Enzymes-Secondary
Metabolites

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large multi-domain proteins
that catalyze the biosynthesis of small molecules with
potent biological activity. These molecules, which are
mainly produced by bacteria and fungi, often serve as
“chemical weapons” against neighboring organisms [77].
Due to their antifungal and antibacterial activities these
compounds are also used for medical purposes in the
pharmaceutical industry. The PKS genes for a certain
polyketide are usually organized in one operon in bacteria and in gene clusters in eukaryotes. We identified
13 PKS, 9 NRPS and 14 PKS genes in the P. vortex genome, which were arranged in the following clusters: (i) a

able to significantly inhibit the growth of V. dahliae
(Figure 8A, B). In the first six days, the diameter of V.
dahliae colonies was identical for all treatment and control plates (~1.5 cm). During 15 days post inoculation of
the P. vortex, V. dahliae colonies grew only ~1.2 cm in
diameter, compared to control colonies which grew 2.5
times faster (~2.9 cm in diameter) (Figure 8C).

Discussion
Whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing has proved
remarkably useful for the large-scale sequencing of bacterial genomes [81-83]. High-quality de novo assemblies
can be obtained with relatively few errors and gaps
when the sequence read coverage redundancy is 15-fold
or greater. Closing all the gaps in each genome
sequence is time-consuming and costly; therefore, in the
near future there will be an excess of draft bacterial
sequences versus closed genomes in public databases.
This study presents a de novo assembly of the P. vortex genome utilizing a hybrid deep-sequencing strategy
using a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer (GS 20) and an
Illumina Genome Analyzer. The use of the two nextgeneration leading technologies and the combination of
the results into a hybrid assembly overcame the drawbacks of each technology and resulted in longer scaffolds. We demonstrated that the sequence identity
between the two methods was 99.88%, reflecting the low
error rate of both sequences. The genome sequence, the
predicted transcripts and the non-coding RNAs were
further validated by hybridization to custom microarray.
Notably, even when using several algorithms and an
extremely high coverage, the data could not be
assembled into a single sequence. Analysis of the ends
of contigs revealed that the unassembled contigs have
small repetitive sequences at their ends. The existence
of high number of repetitive sequences is a generic
obstacle that tempers the ability of the assembly

algorithms to generate a single version of the complete
genome, and more so when working with short reads. It
has been shown that sequence repeats have a functional
role that can contribute to genomic plasticity which
allows rapid adaptation to environmental changes [48].
P. vortex was originally isolated from colonies of
B. subtilis, soil bacteria commonly found in the rhizosphere [84,85]. The Rhizosphere is characterized by
large environmental fluctuations, which act as a selecting force determining the diversity of the microbial
community [86-89]. The features identified in the genome of P. vortex suggest that these bacteria can lead a
successful lifestyle in the highly competitive environment of the rhizosphere as well as serve as an efficient
plant beneficial rhizobacteria (PBR). PBR competitively
colonize plant roots and can simultaneously act as biofertilizers and as antagonists (biopesticides) of recognized root pathogens [90].
Comparative genomics and comparative network biology are emerging as key tools in understanding of how
bacteria respond cooperatively to challenging complex
environments. In particular, it was previously suggested
that bacteria successful in heterogeneous and competitive environments often contain extensive signal transduction and regulatory networks [25,34,91]. These
observations, and the fact that signal transduction networks afford intracellular information processing [36],
led to the notion that the number and fraction of signal
transduction genes can be used as a measure of the
“Bacteria IQ” [34,91]. Detailed comparative genomic
analysis revealed that the P. vortex’s genome and the
genome of the Gram-negative, social and predatory bacterium M. xanthus [92] have exceptionally high number
of TCS genes, supporting the notion that they are
required for advanced social behavior.
The P. vortex species is marked by its complex spatial
organization of the colony, with the bacteria forming

Sirota-Madi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:710
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/710

different patterns to better cope with the environment
[3,4,14,93]. Pattern-formation and self-organization in
microbial systems is an intriguing phenomenon that
might also provide insights into the evolutionary development of the concerted action of cells in higher organisms [19]. Therefore, sequencing of the P. vortex
genome paves the way to understanding of regulatory
processes involved in cell-cell communication and colonial patterning and more generally, to understanding of
cooperative bacterial response to changing environmental conditions. Such information should facilitate
increased exploitation of Paenibacillus spp. in industrial,
agricultural and medical fields, as well as help us comprehend the evolutionary development of multicellular
organisms.

Conclusions
The P. vortex genome was sequenced using a hybrid
deep-sequencing approach resulting in an estimated
genome size of 6.3 Mb. A total of 6,437 ORFs were
identified and 73% of them confirmed using specially
designed Agilent custom microarray chip. The results of
the two sequencing methods were compared resulting
in 99.88% sequence identity, reflecting low error rate of
both sequences. The use of the two next-generation
leading technologies and the combination of the results
into a hybrid assembly overcame the drawbacks of each
technology and resulted in longer scaffolds.
Comparative genomics analysis with 500 complete
bacterial genomes revealed that P. vortex has one of the
highest number of TCS genes among all the Grampositive bacteria in the dataset. High numbers of TCS
genes were also found in the genome of the social predator M. xanthus, supporting the notion that they are
required for advanced social behavior. M. xanthus serves
as an important Gram-negative bacterial model for the
study of multicellularity in prokaryotes [94]. Similarly,
P. vortex may have the potential to provide significant
insights on cell-cell interactions, pattern formation and
social behavior in Gram-positive bacteria. Additionally,
P. vortex encodes an extensive set of TFs, transport and
defense related genes. These findings suggest that P. vortex has a highly developed signal transduction system
and that these genes can support traits needed for thriving in heterogeneous, fluctuating and highly competitive
environments.
The genome sequence of P. vortex provides the basis
for understanding of social organization and pattern formation within Gram-positive bacteria. P. vortex is the
first sequenced Paenibacillus species reported to show
these properties and this work supports the development of genetic approaches to the study of prokaryotic
multicellularity and multi-agent decision making (swarm
intelligence). Furthermore, this organism is likely to

Page 12 of 16

become a valuable resource for exploitation within
biotechnology.

Methods
DNA Preparation

P. vortex DNA was prepared at two separate times for the
454 and Illumina sequencing runs following the standard
Roche and Illumina protocols respectively. P. vortex was
grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) over night. DNA was extracted from 2 ml
cell culture (10 9/ml), using Qiagen, DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit, according to the manufacture’s protocol with
the following modifications; cells were incubated with
Lysosyme for 45 minutes prior extraction. Elution from
Qiagen column was performed with 200 μl buffer AE
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 9.0).
Sequencing

We used a hybrid sequencing approach that incorporates 454 pyrosequencing with Illumina Genome Analyzer. Sequencing by both methods was performed in
compliance with manufacturer’s instructions Roche and
Illumina accordingly.
Assembly

The 454 reads were assembled using Newbler Assembler
[40] version number 1.0.53. To obtain optimized results
for the assembly of Illumina short reads we tested several
algorithms (Additional file 1 Table S2), but eventually
selected Velvet [95]. Velvet’s algorithm handled single
and paired-end reads and produced contigs with highest
sequence identity of 99.88% to those produced by the
454. Algorithms used to assemble short reads are Velvet
0.7.28, Edena 2.1.1 and Euler-SR 1.0. Velvet algorithm
was used with parameter hash length of 31, insert length
of 250 and minimum contig length 50. Edena algorithm
was used with a minimum overlap parameter of 23. The
final step included the assembly of the Newbler (454) and
Velvet (Illumina) contigs using Minimus 2.0.5 [96].
Annotation

The DNA sequence was run through JCVI’s prokaryotic
annotation pipeline (JCVI Annotation Service), which
includes gene finding by Glimmer, Blast-extend-repraze
(BER) searches, HMM searches, TMHMM searches,
SignalP predictions, and automatic annotations from
AutoAnnotate. Additionally, the DNA sequence was
annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic
Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) and the combined annotation was submitted to [GenBank: ADHJ00000000].
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S

The construction of the phylogenetic tree of 22 taxa was
based on 16 S rRNA sequences downloaded in fasta

Sirota-Madi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:710
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/710

format from DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ftp://ftp.
ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/16S/. The alignment of the
chosen sequences was performed using ClustaX [97]
and the construction of the phylegenetic tree using
Neighbor-Joining algorithm [98]. The percentage of
replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) was also
calculated [99]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
method [100] utilizing Mega 4 software [101].
Identification of Two-Component System and
Transcription Factor genes

The approach used to identify putative TCS and TF
genes utilized HMM (Hidden Markov Model) profiles
found in Pfam database of protein families http://pfam.
sanger.ac.uk/ [53]. TCS genes were identified similarly
to that previously described by [102] and [103] and TF
genes were identified as described by [55]. The compiled
list of Pfam domains that was used to identify TCS and
TFs is presented in Additional file 11 and 12 respectfully. Additional methods description is included in
Additional file 1 section VII.
Identification of Transporters and Defense related genes

To identify putative transport and defense related genes
we utilized Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) profiles [42,43]. The compiled list of COG profiles that
were used to identify transport and defense related
genes is presented in Additional file 13 and 14
respectfully.
Combined Score

The combined score was calculated as an average of the
standard deviation (stdev) of two-component system,
transcription factor, transport and defense genes for the
dataset of 500 bacterial genomes. The combined score
was calculated both as normalized and non-normalized
to genome size.
Experiment procedure of P. vortex effect on Verticillium
dahlia

V. dahliae was grown on trypsin soy agar plates (TSA),
at 28°C. A 10 day old stock plate was used to initiate
the experiments as follows: A startup slice of 0.5 mm
diameter was cut from the colony edge and placed on a
fresh TSA plate. The fungal slice was positioned 1 cm
away from the center of a 9 mm Petri dish. Plates were
incubated untill V. dahliae colonies reached 1.5 cm diameter (6 days incubation). At this time-point an overnight P. vortex culture, grown in LB, 28°C, with shaking
(200 rpm), was inoculated in a 6 cm long line, horizontal to V. dahliae. P. vortex was positioned 2.5 cm away
from the V. dahliae colony center. V. dahliae colonies

Page 13 of 16

without the inoculation of P. vortex served as control.
All tests were carried out in triplicate.
Submission to the international collection deposits

Isolate P. vortex sp. nov. V453 was deposited at the
Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC), Columbus, OH,
USA, as strain 31A2T and at the Belgium Coordinated
Collection of Microorganisms (BCCM/LMG) as strain
LMG 25955.
