Abstract
Background: Herpes simplex viruses exist as two major serotypes, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2).
Determination of type, either HSV-1 or HSV-2, is important in accurate diagnosis and clinical control of
transmission. Several tests are available for typing HSV, including a monoclonal antibody specific for glycoprotein G
and several PCR assays.
Findings: A clinical isolate was identified as herpes simplex virus, but tested negative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2
antigens using type-specific monoclonal antibody assays. The isolate was determined to be HSV-1 by PCR analysis.
A mutation which likely caused the monoclonal antibody non-reactivity was found in glycoprotein G. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed two groups of HSV, one with the mutation and one without. Three population studies examining
mutations in HSV-1 glycoprotein G were analyzed by chi-squared test. To this point, the epitope which the
monoclonal antibody recognizes was only found in HSV-1 isolates from human European populations (p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the PCR-based methods for HSV typing may be more useful than the
standard monoclonal antibody test in areas of the world where the variant in glycoprotein G is more prevalent.
Keywords: Herpes Simplex Virus serotyping, glycoprotein G

Findings
Herpes simplex viruses exist as two major serotypes, type
1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). Determination of type,
either HSV-1 or HSV-2, is important in accurate diagnosis and clinical control of transmission. Tests which can
determine HSV type include viral antigen tests, serological tests of human antibodies and PCR [1,2]. The importance of glycoprotein G as the test analyte is emphasized
by the 2002 STD Treatment Guidelines from the CDC:
“Accurate type-specific assays for HSV antibodies must
be based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G2 for the
diagnosis of infection with HSV-2 and glycoprotein G1
for diagnosis of infection with HSV-1.” [3].
A clinical sample of a herpes simplex virus, designated
Y3369 was isolated and proved refractory to typing. The

isolate was obtained from an infected genital tract of a
48-year-old female patient. It was submitted to Richards
Laboratories, Inc., Pleasant Grove, Utah, USA for diagnostic workup. The sample was incubated overnight,
and then stained for virus-infected cells using a typecommon polyclonal primary antibody and visualized by
the immunoperoxidase technique using a rapid culture
method [4,5]. The culture showed an abundance of cells
positive for antibody labeling and had HSV-typical cytopathic effects, confirming the presence of HSV in the
specimen (results not shown).
The Y3369 isolate was then tested using the Wampole
type-specific viral antigen test for HSV glycoprotein G. A
viral stock culture was generated by inoculation of a portion of the rapid culture isolate into a culture of MV1Lu
cells (mink lung, ATCC CCL-64). The specimen was also
incubated in C1008 cells (Vero subline, ATCC CRL1586) and subjected to similar serotypic analysis by staining with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)

against HSV type 1 and type 2. These tests failed to yield
a positive identification of the isolate as either HSV-1
or HSV-2 using type-specific mAb assays (Wampole
Laboratories). The immunofluorescence result was
negative against both reagent antisera in MV1Lu cells
(Figure 1). The virus was also untypable in C1008 cells
(not shown). The laboratory strains HSV-1 McIntyre and
HSV-2 strain 333 were tested with mAb reagents and
expected monotypic results were observed in these
controls.
Determination of HSV type was done by PCR specific
for the HSV pol gene using a common forward primer
and type-specific reverse primers as performed by Abraham, et. al [6] and Kimura, et al. [7]. DNA was extracted
(Invitrogen PureLink viral DNA/RNA mini kit) from
purified virus of HSV-1 (McIntyre strain), HSV-2 (Strain
333), and from the Y3369 isolate. PCR products were
then analyzed on a 1% agarose gel (Figure 2), which
revealed that clinical isolate Y3369 contains the pol
gene of an HSV-1 virus. To confirm the analysis, DNA
was then extracted from the gel (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and sequenced (Parallab 350, ABI
3730xl). DNA sequencing confirmed Y3369 specimen
was a strain of HSV-1 with the sequenced amplicon
having 100% identity when compared to the published
HSV-1 pol gene sequence (GenBank accession #X04771)
and only 85% homology with the HSV-2 sequence.

Figure 2 Isolate Y3369 is an HSV-1 strain, not an HSV-2 virus
by PCR of the HSV pol gene. Viral DNA was isolated and the pol
gene region was amplified by PCR using primers specific for either
the HSV-1 or the HSV-2 sequence. PCR results were electrophoresed
and compared between the Y3369 isolate and the McIntyre HSV-1
strain and the 333 HSV-2 strain. Image was edited to change lane
order for ease of comparison.

Confirmation of the isolate as an HSV-1 strain was
done by successful PCR amplification of HSV-1 genes
UL1, UL10, UL22, glycoprotein D, and glycoprotein G
(data not shown, see Table 1 for PCR conditions and
primers).
Glycoprotein G was PCR amplified (see supplementary
table) and sequenced. Examination of the sequences
showed that the probable cause for the non-reactivity of
the mAb assay was the presence of a valine residue in
glycoprotein G at amino acid (AA) 111. This valine is
near the immunodominant region of antibody binding
during normal immune response [8]. Sequencing results
were deposited [GenBank:HQ833203], and compared to
other isolates on GenBank. Sequencing revealed that the
clinical isolate Y3369 contains an amino acid sequence
consistent with a common HSV-1 sequence found in
many parts of the world [9] (Figure 3).
A meta analysis of three population studies which
have sequenced this region of the HSV-1 US4 gene was
conducted to determine the prevalence of valine at position 111, as was identified in our sample [9-11].
Included were isolates from individuals from China,

Figure 3 Two groups of glycoprotein G are unequally
distributed. Of 185 isolates taken from Sweden and the UK, 64%
contain sequence F, and this 64% represents the isolates which
would properly type using the mAb which recognizes AFPL. By
contrast, 100% of the 141 isolates taken from people in outside
Europe, but only 36% of the European isolates contained the valine
at position 111 (see sequences in Figure 4). These sequences differ
statistically by location using c2, p < 0.0001.

Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom. We discovered the valine at position 111 to
be present in all HSV-1 isolates (100%, N = 141) taken
from human populations from Asia and Africa. The
other populations, from the UK and Sweden, contained
the valine at position 111 in 36% (N = 185) of isolates
(Figure 3). This valine at position 111 is located within
the binding site for a commonly used typing mAb,
which recognizes the epitope AFPL [10]. The phenylalanine is replaced to form the sequence AVPL in this
variant.
Sequences for the middle region encoding AA 110 to
164 of glycoprotein G were analyzed and a phylogenetic
tree created (Figure 4). Phylogenetic analysis groups our
isolate Y3369 as an HSV-1 with sequence V (representing valine at 111) which contains the sequence AVPL
instead of AFPL, as well as other common nucleotides
as shown in Figure 4. All isolates from populations from
Africa and Asia, as well as 36% of the European population contained the sequence AVPL, which would not be
recognized by the mAb which tests for the AFPL epitope. Another study found that all isolates with a valine
residue at position 111 of glycoprotein G were untypable when assaying viral antigens [10]. This specific test
would not be likely to function diagnostically in these
African or Asian populations.
Our analysis of these studies provides evidence that
glycoprotein G variation is likely significant in clinical
typing discrepancies and also in isolate variations. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of Y3369 and other
isolates indicates that there is a shared significant

Figure 4 Phylogenetic analysis reveals two groups of
variations within HSV-1 glycoprotein G by region. The
evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method. The
tree is drawn to scale, with evolutionary distances in the units of
base substitutions per site. There were a total of 165 positions,
coding for AA 110 to 164. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in
MEGA4 [15]. Labeled branches represent the number of isolates
from the specified region. Sequences shown at the bottom are
from the branches highlighted with colored dots, which represent
the most common sequence. Positions where sequences V and F
differ are in color. The immunodominant region of glycoprotein G is
enclosed by a box. The epitope AFPL (underlined, present
exclusively in sequence F) is recognized by a common antiglycoprotein G-1 mAb. The clinical isolate Y3369 discussed herein
contains sequence V.

variation among HSV-1 strains that alters viral antigen
assay specificity. PCR analysis is likely to succeed in
HSV typing where the isolate is not recognized by the
monoclonal antibody. In addition to results presented
here, PCR has been used to type HSV samples on other
occasions. In one study, 75 HSV-positive isolates yielded
two which were untypable using type-specific antibody
tests, later confirmed HSV-1 by PCR [12]. Another
study yielded 1 untypable isolate of 37 tested HSV-positive isolates, which was also confirmed as HSV-1 by
PCR [13]. These represent about 2% of the HSV-positive
isolates in these two studies.
We have determined the presence of two phylogenetic
groups of glycoprotein G. One group was only found in
Europe (Figure 4, sequence F), and all the isolates in
this group contain the epitope AFPL, which a common
assay uses to type HSV-1. The other group (Figure 4,
sequence V) was found in all tested regions, which
include Africa, Asia and Europe. This group was characterized by the AVPL sequence. Y3369 is a member of
this group. The two sequences differ by location statistically (c2 = 142.8, p < 0.0001).

The identification of these two groups, as well as their
localization to different parts of the world, may aid in
developing strategies for clinical viral antigen assays for
HSV typing. Although the isolates included in the meta
analysis which have the AVPL sequence were not tested
by us, they would likely fail to type as HSV-1 using this
same test. It should be considered that tests for the viral
antigen epitope AFLP be used with caution in Africa or
Asia.
This variation may also alter the interaction of virus
with host. The presence of the variations in the immunodominant region of the protein suggests these mutations could be a result of viral immune evasion. These
mutations may also affect the functioning of glycoprotein G, which involves attachment and entry [14].
Further tests are being performed to study what other
effects this mutation has on the virus’s efficiency of
infection.
