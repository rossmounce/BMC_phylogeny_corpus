Abstract
Background: Oligonucleotide frequencies were shown to be conserved signatures for bacterial
genomes, however, the underlying constraints have yet not been resolved in detail. In this paper
we analyzed oligonucleotide usage (OU) biases in a comprehensive collection of 155 completely
sequenced bacterial chromosomes, 316 plasmids and 104 phages.
Results: Two global features were analyzed: pattern skew (PS) and variance of OU deviations
normalized by mononucleotide content of the sequence (OUV). OUV reflects the strength of OU
biases and taxonomic signals. PS denotes asymmetry of OU in direct and reverse DNA strands. A
trend towards minimal PS was observed for almost all complete sequences of bacterial
chromosomes and plasmids, however, PS was substantially higher in separate genomic loci and
several types of plasmids and phages characterized by long stretches of non-coding DNA and/or
asymmetric gene distribution on the two DNA strands. Five of the 155 bacterial chromosomes
have anomalously high PS, of which the chromosomes of Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c and Prochlorococcus
marinus MIT9313 exhibit extreme PS values suggesting an intermediate unstable state of these two
genomes.
Conclusions: Strand symmetry as indicated by minimal PS is a universally conserved feature of
complete bacterial genomes that results from the matching mutual compensation of local OU
biases on both replichors while OUV is more a taxon specific feature. Local events such as
inversions or the incorporation of genome islands are balanced by global changes in genome
organization to minimize PS that may represent one of the leading evolutionary forces driving
bacterial genome diversification.

Background
The analysis of oligonucleotide usage (OU) biases is a useful approach to study bacterial genome organization [15]. A number of computational approaches have been
designed to visualize pathogenicity regions [2,6-8] or to
separate sequences of diverse origins by differential oligonucleotide composition [1,3,5,9,10]. These methods were
based on analysis of OU variances and departures from

expectations. Di-, tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies
were shown to be conserved signatures for individual
genomes [1,4,5,11,12] albeit the underlying biological
and physicochemical constraints that lead to the over- and
underrepresentation of oligonucleotides are only partially
known and understood. Mutagenesis and repair, restriction-modification systems, amino acid frequency, codon
bias and structural parameters, to name just a few, should

all influence the frequency and sequence of oligonucleotides. For example, DNA flexibility and curvature has
been related to the nucleotide sequence by trinucleotide
bendability, dinucleotide base stacking energy and propeller twist angle [13].
OU biases are characteristic features of a bacterial genome
[4,11], but according to Chargaff's first and second parity
rule [14] the complementary strands are believed to be
symmetric. However, with more and more complete bacterial genome sequences at hand, the AT and GC composition are meanwhile known to be skewed between
leading and lagging strand [15,16] and the extrapolation
of the first-order parity rule to higher orders of oligonucleotide composition has yet not been investigated in sufficient depth to draw any valid conclusions. The only
published evidence that strand symmetry extends from
base composition (first order) to oligonucleotides (higher
orders) has been provided by numerical analysis of the
sequence of human chromosome 22 [12]. According to
this data strand symmetry does not result from a single
cause, but rather seems to emerge from numerous mechanisms [12]. We were curious to know whether or not
strand symmetry of higher order is a universal feature in
the microbial world. Physicochemical constraints operating at the oligonucleotide level could lead to higher order
strand symmetry at the local and/or global level. Hence
we determined strand symmetry and its relationship to
oligonucleotide composition in a comprehensive collection of completely sequenced bacterial chromosomes,
plasmids and phages.

Results and Discussion
DNA structure and oligonucleotide usage
First, we wanted to know whether an association exists
between structural features of DNA and the frequency of
particular tetranucleotide words in bacterial genomes.
DNA structural features have been related from theoretical
calculations and empirical measurements to di- or trinucleotide scales such as base stacking energy [17], propeller
twist angle [18], protein deformability [19], position preference [20] and bendability [21]. By permutation analysis
the 256 tetranucleotides were assigned to 39 equivalence
classes each of which characterized by the same values for
the five scales mentioned above [13].

The deviations ∆w of observed from expected counts (see
eq. 6 in 'Methods' section) were determined for all 256
tetranucleotides on one clockwise strand of four bacterial
genomes and then sorted by decreasing stacking energy
with class 39 (CGCG, GCGC) and 32 (ATAT, TATA) having the highest and lowest energy, respectively. The preference of tetranucleotides for low, intermediate or high base
stacking energy was found to be a taxon-specific feature.
For example, whereas the GC-rich Pseudomonas putida

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/90

KT2440 prefers the extremes with low and high stacking
energy, the selection of tetranucleotides in the AT-rich
Bacillus subtilis 168 is biased towards low stacking energy
(Fig. 1). All analyzed genomes, however, shared the feature that virtually all tetranucleotide words within the
same class were distributed with similar taxon-specific frequency. In other words, tetranucleotides with matching
structural features apparently occur with comparable frequency in a bacterial genome. The high-order parity of
complementary DNA strands has been postulated previously, implicitly or explicitly, as the consequence of firstorder symmetry [5,12,22,23], but was not substantiated
by comprehensive analysis of real sequence data. The
reader should note that an oligonucleotide and its reverse
complement always belong to the same equivalence class.
This tendency towards intrastrand parity of complementary oligonucleotides will consequently lead to a symmetric distribution of oligonucleotides on both strands. To
verify the universality of this phenomenon, we systematically analyzed a comprehensive selection of 155 bacterial
chromosomes, 104 phages and 316 plasmids by the calculation of pattern skew (PS), a global genome parameter of
intrastrand disparity. The values determined for all analyzed genomes are presented in additional data files [see
additional data files 1,2 and 3 for chromosomes, plasmids
and phages, respectively].
OU pattern skew
The PS values of n0_4mer patterns (definition given in the
'Methods' section) determined for all sequenced bacterial
chromosomes were in the range of 1 to 8% (Fig. 2A)
except for the 3 strains Clostridium tetani E88, Nitrosomonas
europaea ATCC 19718 and Haemophilus ducreyi 35000 HP
with PS values of about 9% and the two strains Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313 and Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c with
extreme values of 15.97% and 24.27%, respectively. No
reliable links between the taxonomic position of the
organism and its PS were detected. The strains X. fastidiosa
Temecula, P. marinus ssp.marinus CCMP1375 and P. marinus ssp.pastoris CCMP1378 exhibit symmetric patterns in
contrast to their close relatives X. fastidiosa 9a5c and P.
marinus MIT9313 [see additional data file 1].

In shorter sequences both the PS mean values and standard deviation increase exponentially due to size limitation
of the sequences. Regression equations were calculated
from the empirical data to simulate this dependence for
average PS (PSavr):
PSavr = 100 - 95.24 × EXP(-2796.6/ Lsec)

(1)

and for the standard deviation σPS
σPS = 100 - 98.66 × EXP(-652.27/ Lsec)

Tetranucleotide usage patterns of E. coli K12, P. putida KT2440, B. subtilis 168 and A. pernix K1. The deviation ∆w
of observed from expected counts defined by eq. 6 is shown for all 256 tetranucleotides (16 × 16 cells) by color code (right
bar). Tetranucleotides are grouped into 39 classes of equivalent structural features [13] and sorted by decreasing base stacking
energy row-by-row starting at the upper left corner (class 39). Within a class members are sorted alphabetically.

The 95% confidential intervals of PS values (grey shaded

The increase of PS with decreasing genome size is not a
biological feature, but just reflects the increase of local stochastic fluctuations in oligonucleotide usage. The smaller

the genome and correspondingly the smaller the
frequency of the individual oligonucleotide, the larger the
variance. The portion of noise increases exponentially in
shorter sequences making the oligonucleotide distribution parameters closer to the characteristics of a random
sequence [24].
Strand symmetry was found to be a global feature of bacterial chromosomes, but this did not apply to all plasmids
and phages: PS values varied over a large range (Fig. 2A).
PS values of circular and linear plasmid and phage
genomes overlapped (data not shown). Consider some
examples of symmetric and asymmetric genomes. The
majority of large plasmids have low PS values like complete bacterial chromosomes [see additional data file 2].
However, some large plasmids including Rts1 of Proteus
vulgaris exhibit unexpectedly high PS. Among the 300
ORFs of this plasmid, 253 are oriented in the same direction [25].
Higher PS was found in so-called conjugative genome
islands such as pKLC102 [26], R100, R391 [27] and virulence plasmid pO157 [28] and pADAP [29] which share a
mosaic genome structure of plasmid and phage origins.
Another example of this transition zone of phages and
plasmids are the plasmid pBClin15 of Bacillus cereus and
the phage Bam35c of Bacillus thuringiensis. Both shares an
almost identical gene repertoire, all genes are leftward oriented [30] and in both cases PS values are beyond the
95% confidence limit.
The majority of phage genomes exhibit higher PS values
than plasmids or chromosomes [see additional data file
3]. Most head-and-tail bacteriophages have a genome
sequence length of around 50 kbp that fits to capsid size
[31] (Fig. 2A). Short tail Podoviridae, such as streptococcal
phage C1 [32] and bacillar phage GA-1, have symmetric
OU, while PS increases in long tail lamboid Siphoviridae
up to extreme values of 60–64% in SPP1, T3, T7, phiYe0312 phages. A large portion of the genome of long tail
phages is non-coding and serves to anchor the DNA
within the capsular head and tail [33,34]. Thus in SPP1
phage only 32 kbp out of 47 kbp are coding sequences
and all genes are transcribed from one strand [35]. The
highest PS value of 82% was observed in the 5,415 bp single strand DNA enterobacterial phage G4.
Symmetric OU is characteristic for Myoviridae T4 and RM
378 and for mycobacterial Siphoviridaea D29, L5 and
Bxb1. The genomes of the former have a symmetric structure of two arms of leftward and rightward transcribed
genes. However, in the close relative mycobacteriophage
TM4 all genes are transcribed in the rightward direction
[36] and its PS value for the n0_4mer pattern is threefold
larger than that of D29, L5 and Bxb1. In conclusion, asym-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/90

metric genome topology and/or the presence of large
inserts of less conserved non-coding DNA stretches apparently cause strand specific OU asymmetry in some plasmids and most phages.
Next, we wanted to test whether the association of PS values being higher for non-coding than for coding
sequences does not only apply to phages, but also to bacterial chromosomes. PS values of non-coding regions of
tested bacterial chromosomes were higher than PS values
of coding sequences (Table 1), however, this higher PS is
just caused to major extent by its shorter total length in the
genome. The comparatively higher PS values are within
expectation for a shorter sequence for most genomes (Fig.
2A). Exceptions were the two outliers X. fastidiosa 9a5c
and P. marinus MIT9313 (see above) and chromosomes of
Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168, Corynebacterium
glutamicum ATCC 13032 and Xylella fastidiosa Temecula1.
In other words, the same underlying principles shape oligonucleotide distributions in coding and non-coding
sequences in bacterial genomes; i.e. codon usage is not a
major determinant for global PS. A bias of coding
sequences to one strand as seen in phages, however, leads
to increased PS according to their other lifestyle and
evolution.
Next, the hypothesis was tested whether global strand
symmetry of bacterial chromosomes also extends to local
regions. The local PS values were calculated for 15 selected
chromosomes (Table 1). PS values of n0_4mer patterns
were determined for 100 randomly generated arbitrary
loci of 5 to 1,000 kbp in size. These local patterns exhibited significantly higher PS than complete genomes of the
same size for 12 of 15 analyzed chromosomes (P < 10-6 in
all 12 cases, χ2 tests, P values corrected for multiple testing; the genome of Mycoplasms pulmonis UAB CTIP was not
applicable for this test due to its small genome size). Figure 2B displays the local patterns randomly generated
from the Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosomes. The majority of PS values of chromosomal segments were higher than the 95% confidence interval
predicted by equations 1 and 2 for genome sequences. In
Aquifex aeolicus, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and Streptomyces coelicolor, however, local PS was only slightly higher
than in the whole chromosome (Table 1) indicating
strand symmetry throughout the chromosome. In all
other selected species pronounced strand asymmetry was
determined to differential genome-specific extent (see X.
fastidiosa TemeculaI as an extreme example, Table 1), but
these local skews of tetranucleotide usage are mutually
compensated by other regions so that PS skew of the
whole chromosome is reduced to 1–8%.
Normalization of OU frequencies by mononucleotide
content typically had either no effect or increased PS,

*PS values of n0_4mer patterns were calculated for 100 arbitrary loci (200 for E. coli and B. subtilis) of 5 to 1,000 kbp in size (median 289,752 bp,
inner quartiles 114,406 – 477,801 bp).

whereby in case of the latter the OU variance decreased.
For instance, the mean values of PS of n0_4mer and
n1_4mer patterns of the analyzed bacterial chromosomes
[see additional data file 1] were 3.4 ± 3.0% and 3.7 ±
2.0%, respectively. In some cases, however, the normalization significantly decreased PS. On Fig. 2A the
sequences are marked where the n0_4mer PS values
exceeded the corresponding n1_4mer PS values by more
than 2.5 σPS (see eq.2). All these genomes exhibit high PS
values, amongst them are some lamboid phages, conjugative genome islands and four bacterial chromosomes: X.
fastidiosa9a5c, P. marinus MIT9313, N. europaea ATCC
19718 and H. ducreyi 35000 HP.
Next, we wanted to know whether PS changes with the
length of oligomers. PS values increased with the length of
oligonucleotide words in all examined bacterial chromosomes to an extent that is consistent with the increase of
numbers of n-mers and concomitant random fluctuations
between expected and observed counts of words; i.e.
strand symmetry is maintained to similar extent for di-,
tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotides. However, in the two outliers X. fastidiosa 9a5c and P. marinus MIT9313 with the
largest n0_4mer PS values (additional data file 1, Fig. 2A)
PS decreased with increasing word length (Fig. 3). This
behaviour could be attributed in both strains to extreme
dinucleotide skew that is diluted in longer words. In case
of the three other outliers C. tetani E88, N. europaea ATCC
19718 and H. ducreyi 35000 HP di-, tri- and tetranucleotide skews all contribute to the pronounced pattern

skew. Since we did not observe any trend towards common oligonucleotides in all five strains that account for
the skew but rather individual patterns that are characteristic for the peculiar strain, we conclude that high pattern
skew is a strain specific feature.
Asymmetric OU in bacterial chromosomes may reflect
asymmetric genome topology and/or multiple inserts of
foreign DNA with high PS. To test this hypothesis, the
genomes of X. fastidiosa 9a5c and P. putida KT2440 were
selected for a comparative study of OU pattern consistency. Both genomes are characterized by multiple genome
islands and unequal lengths of the clockwise and counterclockwise replichors [37,38]. The standard n0_4mer OU
patterns were defined for the leading strands of both chromosomes. Next, the local n0_4mer patterns were determined in 15 kbp sliding windows in steps of 7.5 kbp and
compared against the standard genome-wide patterns.
The X. fastidiosa 9a5c chromosome is characterized by
large local variations of OU patterns and a qualitatively
different behaviour of the clockwise and counterclockwise
replichors (Fig. 4). We calculated the distances D (see eq.8
in 'Methods' section) of n0_4mer patterns between the
clockwise and counterclockwise replichor and between
the clockwise and the reverse complement of the counterclockwise replichor to be 44.09% and 9.03%, respectively.
Compared to X. fastidiosa 9a5c, the OU pattern of the P.
putida KT2440 genome is smoother and more uniform in
spite of many genome islands with atypical OU patterns
scattered throughout the chromosome (Fig. 4). OU pat-

OU patterns by mononucleotide content significantly
reduced this bias, however, did not remove it completely.
OUV values determined for n1_4mer patterns of 155
bacterial chromosomes varied from 0.05 to 0.5. According
to regression analysis average values (OUVavr) and variances (σOUV) of OUV retained some parabolic dependence on mol% GC (XGC):

OUVavr has its minimum at 43% GC and σOUV at 57% GC
content. In GC-rich and AT-rich sequences OU is strongly
biased leading to higher OUV. Moreover, the lower variance of OUV values in sequences of high GC-content (Fig.
5) suggests that the use of GC-rich words is more biased
than that of AT-rich words, presumably due to the extreme
values of base stacking energy, propeller twist and protein
deformability [13].

terns of the clockwise and counterclockwise replichors
were different but complementary to each other. Thus, in
P. putida KT2440 the distance of n0_4mer patterns
between the clockwise and counterclockwise replichors
was 10.43%, while that between the clockwise and the
reverse-complement of the counterclockwise replichors
was only 1.96%. Notably, despite the length difference,
the counterclockwise replichor manages to compensate
the mirror OU skew in the clockwise strand due to its
greater OU variance in the shorter replichor.
OU variance
OUV is strongly dependent on GC-content [7,39]. If the
data from sequenced bacterial chromosomes are superimposed, a parabolic curve is generated with the minimum
of n0_4mer OUV at 50 mol% GC [39]. Normalization of

The OUV values of all studied bacterial chromosomes and
3-sigma limits of their variations are shown in Fig. 5. In
general strains of the same species or genera have similar
OUV [see additional data file 1]. No links between OUV
and PS values were observed. The strains P. marinus
MIT9313 and X. fastidiosa 9a5c with atypical PS have similar OUV as their close relatives.

Conclusions
Two global genome features based on OU statistics were
considered in this study: PS and OUV. They provide nonredundant characteristics of the complete sequence of
genomes and allow the discrimination of bacterial, plasmid and phage genomes by phylogeny, the arrangement
of coding and non-coding sequence and the distribution
of islands and islets.
A strong taxonomic signal was observed in genome specific OUV values. Strains belonging to the same species or
genus usually have similar OUV. In general, the higher is
the OUV, the less random is the sequence. Multiple influences such as DNA structure and topology, codon usage,
DNA repair and restriction-modification systems contribute to the surrogate parameter OUV, and hence it is plausible that the OUV is a taxon-specific feature. Future work
on the frequency and distribution of individual words
should elucidate the biological meaning of the genome
specific OUV for the individual taxon (see Weinel et al.,
2002 [40] as one of the few published examples).
The major finding was that words and their reverse complements occur with similar frequencies in the complete
sequence, because they share the same structural features

in terms of DNA flexibility and curvature thus generating
strand symmetry. However, in local regions PS is substantially more variable. Local PS values, for example, were up
to 70% in the X. fastidiosa Temecula1 genome (see Table
1), that means the complementary words were deliberately counterselected in these sequences, but even in this
extreme case the global PS of the chromosome remained

low. Local asymmetric OU patterns of leading and lagging
strands of DNA mutually compensate each other restoring
in that way the OU symmetry of the complete sequence.
Notably, OU symmetry was retained in sequences with
replichors of disproportionate length and multiple horizontally acquired genome islands like in the P. putida
KT2440 genome. Low PS is a feature of complete
genomes. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the
PS values of plasmid genomes and whole chromosomes
are smaller than those of arbitrarily selected chromosomal
loci of the same size (see Fig. 2B, Table 1).
High PS was predominant for phages and conjugative
genome islands that corresponds to their dual lifestyle to
either exist in the episomal state or to be integrated into
the chromosome. In addition, the high PS correlates with
the known high mutation rates of these genetic elements
and an intensive horizontal exchange that is an important
component of their evolution [26,41-43]. Among the
analyzed bacteria only the chromosomes of X. fastidiosa
9a5c and P. marinus MIT9313 show high PS which in both
cases is caused by dinucleotide skew of four complementary pairs (TT/AA, GG/CC, GT/AC and TG/CA). This dinucleotide skew led to large fluctuations of local OU
patterns, high global PS that is not compensated by the
replichors (Fig. 4) and loss of intrastrand parity which
should give rise to an uncommon, probably unstable
chromosome structure. Future experimental work may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/90

show whether or not such a status of the genome is associated with reduced fitness and/or more rapid evolution.
In summary, referring to the comparative analysis of PS in
local regions and complete genomes shown in Fig. 2, the
proportional usage of words and their reverse complements, i.e. strand symmetry is important for genome stability, and there could exist yet unknown housekeeping
mechanisms to control compensating matching of OU
patterns of different loci of a sequence. Local events such
as inversions or the incorporation of a genome island are
balanced by global changes in genome organization to
minimize pattern skew. This response of the genome to
local perturbations may represent one of the leading evolutionary forces that drive bacterial genome diversification and speciation.

Methods
Overall DNA properties
Intragenomic GC-content and GC-skew variations were
determined as quantities of (G+C) and (G-C)/(G+C),
respectively, averaged over a sliding window of certain
length.
Evaluation of oligonucleotide patterns
Overlapping oligonucleotide words of a certain length lw
were counted in the sequence of Lseq nucleotides by shifting the window in steps of 1 nucleotide. The total word
number (Wtotal) is Lseq-lw in a linear sequence or Wtotal=Lseq
in a circular sequence. Since Lseq >>lw, Wtotal ≅ Lseq in all
cases. For a given word length lw, Nw = 4lw different words
are possible for a sequence of four letters A, T, G and C.
The observed counts of words (Co) were compared with
the expected counts of words (Ce). Assuming the same distribution frequency for all words of a common length lw
irrespective of their composition and sequence, Ce
matches the standard count number Cn0
−
Ce = Cn0 = Wtotal × Nw1

( 5)

Correspondingly, if we normalize oligonucleotide usage
(OU) by mononucleotide content using zero-order
Markov method [44], Ce becomes
Ce = Cn1
The deviation ∆w of observed from expected counts is
given by
−1
∆ w = ( C0 − Ce ) × Cn0

(6)

In the present work we used the following abbreviations
for the different types of patterns: type_lwmer. Types are
called 'n0', if they are not normalized by mononucleotide
frequency, or 'n1', if they are normalized by the zero-order

Markov method. For example, the non-normalized trinucleotide usage pattern is a n0_3mer type, the normalized
pentanucleotide usage pattern is a n1_5mer type.
Variance OUV of word deviations were determined as
following:

OUV =

∑ ∆2
w

(7)

w

Nw − 1

Pattern comparison and pattern skew
For the comparison of sequences by OU patterns of the
same type, the words in each sequence were ranked by ∆w
values according to equation 6. Rank numbers instead of
word counts were used to simplify pattern comparison
and to remove sequence length bias. Assuming that 95%
of all words should occur at least ten times in a random
sequence, the threshold for the minimum length of the
sequence was chosen to be 0.3, 1.2, 5 and 20 kb for di-,
tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotides, respectively.

The distance D between two patterns was calculated as the
sum of absolute distances between ranks of identical
words in patterns i and j as follows:

D ( % ) = 100 ×

∑| rankw,i − rankw, j | −Dmin

(8)

w

Dmax − Dmin

where

Dmax =

Nw ( Nw − 1 )

( 9)

2

Dmax is the maximal distance that is theoretically possible
between two patterns of lw long words (equation 9). Dmin
is the minimal distance between two patterns. The minimal distance is zero for two independent sequences, but
has a positive value for the two complementary strands of
the same DNA sequence, because the OU patterns
designed for both strands of the same DNA molecule cannot be identical. The pattern skew (PS) describes this distance between opposite strands of the same DNA and is a
measure of OU asymmetry. The minimal theoretical distance between two patterns of opposite strands is realized
if the words and their reverse complements are distributed
with similar frequencies in the sequence and it is
Dmin = 4lw, if lw is an odd number

(10a)

but
Dmin = 4lw -2lw, if lw is an even number

(10b).

because palindromes, which occur in both strands with
the same frequency, only exist in words with an even
number of nucleotides and the total number of all possible palindromes is 2lw.
Data mining and storage
A computational program for determining OU patterns,
their comparative analysis and storage in a database was
written on Python 2.2 [45]. Sequences of 155 bacterial
chromosomes including eubacterial, archaeal and cyanobacterial genomes, 316 plasmids and 104 phages
published in NCBI database [46] and the plasmid genome
database [47] were analyzed in this study. Regression
analysis has been done using DataFit7.1.44 software.
Coding and non-coding sequences were selected by gene
coordinates provided in the NCBI database [46]. Intergenic spacer regions shorter or equal 50 bp were included
in the coding sequence of a genome, while longer spacer
regions were concatenated into the non-coding sequence.
