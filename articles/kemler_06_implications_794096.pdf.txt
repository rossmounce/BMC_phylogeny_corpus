Abstract
Background: Anther smuts of the basidiomycetous genus Microbotryum on Caryophyllaceae are
important model organisms for many biological disciplines. Members of Microbotryum are most
commonly found parasitizing the anthers of host plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, however they
can also be found on the anthers of members of the Dipsacaceae, Lamiaceae, Lentibulariaceae, and
Portulacaceae. Additionally, some members of Microbotryum can be found infecting other organs of
mainly Polygonaceae hosts. Based on ITS nrDNA sequences of members of almost all genera in
Microbotryaceae, this study aims to resolve the phylogeny of the anther smuts and their
relationship to the other members of the family of plant parasites. A multiple analysis strategy was
used to correct for the effects of different equally possible ITS sequence alignments on the
phylogenetic outcome, which appears to have been neglected in previous studies.
Results: The genera of Microbotryaceae were not clearly resolved, but alignment-independent
moderate bootstrap support was achieved for a clade containing the majority of the Microbotryum
species. The anther parasites appeared in two different well-supported lineages whose
interrelationship remained unresolved. Whereas bootstrap support values for some clades were
highly vulnerable to alignment conditions, other clades were more robustly supported. The
differences in support between the different alignments were much larger than between the
phylogenetic optimality criteria applied (maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood).
Conclusion: The study confirmed, based on a larger dataset than previous work, that the anther
smuts on Caryophyllaceae are monophyletic and that there exists a native North American group
that diverged from the European clade before the radiation of the European species. Also a second
group of anther smuts was revealed, containing parasites on Dipsacaceae, Lamiaceae, and
Lentibulariaceae. At least the majority of the parasites of Asteraceae appeared as a monophylum,
but delimitations of some species in this group should be reconsidered. Parasitism on Polygonaceae
is likely to be the ancestral state for the Microbotryaceae on Eudicot hosts.

model organisms. They have been subject to research in
different areas, i.e. genetics (e.g. [1]), population analysis
(e.g. [2]), phylogenetics (e.g. [3]), host-parasite evolution
[4], and ecology [5]. The sorus formation of smuts in the
anthers of the hosts is an interesting constellation that has
been discussed in the context of pollination. Lateral transmission of the parasite by the pollinator is thought to
have a significant effect on the evolutionary history of the
genus and its distribution on different hosts [5]. There are
ten recognized species of caryophyllaceous anther smuts
[6,7], but the species concept in this group is discussed
quite controversially. Some authors define at least some
species as formae speciales of Microbotryum violaceum
(Pers.) G. Deml & Oberw. [3,8-10]. In contrast, Liro [11],
based on infection experiments and field observations,
already separated Ustilago violacea (Pers.) Roussel (i.e.
Microbotryum violaceum) into several species. Molecular
studies also indicate genetical isolation of lineages parasitising different host plants [7,10] or occurring in different
geographical regions [3]. Against this background, it is
desirable to further our understanding of this group. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the caryophyllaceous
anther smuts are only a minor group in Microbotryum.
On the basis of ultrastructural features, the Microbotryaceae are defined as phytoparasitic Basidiomycota that
have transversely septate basidia with multiple production of sessile basidiospores and intercellular hyphae but
no haustoria [12]. The Microbotryaceae are separated
from their sister family, the Ustilentylomataceae, by having hyphae with poreless septa at maturity [12]. For an
extensive historical overview of Microbotryum see [6].
Vánky [6] revised Microbotryum, and, based on spore mass
colour, transferred most of the Ustilago species that parasitise eudicotyledonous plants to Microbotryum. Later, new
species were added [7,13,14], and Microbotryum now contains 77 species. Even though the caryophyllaceous anther
smuts are the best-known members of the genus, most
species are parasites on Polygonaceae. Hosts are also
described in the Asteraceae, Dipsacaceae, Gentianaceae,
Lamiaceae, Lentibulariaceae, and Onagraceae. The formation of sori is not restricted to anthers, but there is sorus
formation in seeds, whole flowers, pedicels, stems, and
leaves.
Next to Microbotryum the Microbotryaceae contain Bauerago Vánky, Liroa Cif., Sphacelotheca de Bary, and Zundeliomyces Vánky [15]. So far, no hypotheses have been
formulated about how these genera might be related to
each other. Sphacelotheca is distinct from Microbotryum by
forming appendices between spores, the so-called disjunctors, and by the presence of a columella and a peridium in
the sori [16,17]. Liroa forms tumours on its host plants
including an apical lunular bed of spore masses [16-19].
Bauerago is characterized by its parasitism on Cyperaceae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

and Juncaceae, the presence of a peridium and the lack of
a columella [20].
In order to obtain hypotheses about the phylogenetic relationships of the main groups in the Microbotryaceae, we
performed molecular phylogenetic analyses based on
nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences.
Besides Microbotryum, specimens of Bauerago, Liroa, and
Sphacelotheca were included in our analyses. Thus, with
the exception of the monotypic genus Zundeliomyces, specimens of which were unavailable to us, all genera in
Microbotryaceae were considered. Representative members of Ustilentylomataceae were included for rooting the
phylogenetic trees [15].
Internal transcribed spacer sequences as a molecular
marker for smut fungi
The ITS region of the nuclear rDNA has already been used
in many studies to resolve phylogenetic relationships
within the fungal kingdom. For smut fungi, the ITS has
been proven to sufficiently resolve genera, e.g., Entyloma
[21], Tilletia [22], and Ustilago/Sporisorium [23]. ITS
sequences have been used to infer phylogenies of Microbotryum and Sphacelotheca [7,24], and Freeman et al. [3]
demonstrated that the topologies of phylogenetic trees of
M. violaceum s.l. inferred from ITS data showed no
strongly supported inconsistencies to trees inferred from
β- and γ-Tubulin. The partition homogeneity test [25]
conducted by these authors indicated significant conflict
between the partitions, but they discussed the possibility
that the partition homogeneity test could be too conservative. Furthermore, the partition homogeneity test has
been criticised in general (see [26] and references therein).
Based on these studies, it seemed promising to use ITS
data to try to answer phylogenetic questions inside the
Microbotryaceae.

However, aligning non-coding sequences like ITS may be
much more difficult than using protein-coding DNA fragments which are structured by reading frames and have
most variability concentrated at third base positions
within codons [27]. As Morrison and Ellis [28] have demonstrated, the effects of different underlying DNA
sequence alignments on phylogenetic tree reconstruction
may be even greater than the effect of the different treebuilding methods (e.g., maximum parsimony, maximum
likelihood, and distance methods). Tree topologies and
branch support inferred from these alignments may be
influenced by guide tree topology [29] or input order of
sequences [27,30] as well as parameters like the ratios of
gap costs to transition/transversions costs [31] used for
aligning.
To cope with these problems, one possibility is to exclude
the most ambiguously aligned characters before conduct-

ing phylogenetic analysis. Gatesy et al. [32] pointed to the
advantage of doing this in a reproducible manner. These
authors advocated running an alignment program under
several parameter combinations and to use only those
positions that were consistently revealed under all combinations tested. Excluding alignment-ambiguous regions,
however, does not take into account that different possible alignment solutions do not necessarily imply different
topologies [33] or support values. An approach based on
the generation of a number of alignments by the same
algorithm but under different parameter combinations
was called "multiple analysis method" by Lee [33]. Here,
trees are inferred separately from the respective alignments and only relationships appearing in all (or most) of
the trees are accepted (see also [34]). Another possibility
would be to use different alignment algorithms under
default values, respectively, as did Morrison and Ellis [28].
In addition to the exclusion of ambiguous regions in a
reproducible manner we also followed the latter approach
and computed trees from three largely different alignments of the same dataset without excluding ambiguous
positions. Combining these approaches should reveal
whether clade support is based on alignment-ambiguous
regions, and, if so, whether it is dependent on how these
regions are aligned.

Results
DNA alignments
The alignment obtained with MAFFT had a total length of
811 bp. After the exclusion of positions with too many
leading or trailing gaps, 738 bp remained, 411 of which
were variable and 286 of which were parsimony-informative. The corresponding numbers were 817, 744, 381, and
293 for the PCMA alignment and 850, 749, 370 and 287
for the POA alignment respectively. Considerable parts of
the ITS were not identically aligned between these three
approaches, including a very long alignment-ambiguous
part of the ITS1 and two shorter alignment-ambiguous
parts of the ITS2. These alignment ambiguities are also
illustrated by the DIALIGN alignment in which 406 of a
total of 910 columns had a quality score of only 0 or 1 and
were excluded from further analyses. From the remaining
504 positions, 181 were variable and 124 were parsimony-informative.
Maximum parsimony
Heuristic maximum parsimony analysis of the concatenated dataset yielded 1780 most parsimonious trees of
length 3665. The consistency index of these was 0.513
(0.4963 when uninformative characters were excluded)
and the retention index [35] 0.813. Minimum length trees
were found in 73 of the 200 replicates. The strict consensus of these most parsimonious trees is shown in Fig. 1
together with bootstrap values obtained by three separate
parsimony bootstrap analyses of the MAFFT, PCMA, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

POA alignments, respectively. Additionally, maximum
parsimony bootstrap values from the reduced dataset
obtained by excluding alignment-ambiguous regions are
indicated.
For discussion purposes, we separated the taxa into four
distinct informal groups (Bauerago group and Microbotryum groups I, II, and III; compare Fig. 2). Three of these
groups appeared as monophyletic in the analyses,
although only two of them were moderately to highly
supported as a natural grouping. Group II did not appear
as a monophylum, but formed a paraphyletic clade.
Within the ingroup, the two sampled Bauerago species, B.
abstrusa on Juncus sp. and B. vuyckii on Luzula sp. separated
basally in the strict consensus, forming a monophyletic
group ("Bauerago group") with bootstrap values of 99–
100% in all alignments. The position of this clade in the
tree, however, received bootstrap support only in the POA
alignment (79%). If alignment-ambiguous regions were
excluded, there was 61% support for an alternative
arrangement (not shown).
The Microbotryum I group contained M. bistortarum, M. bosniacum, M. nepalense, M. pustulatum, and M. tuberculiforme
as well as the sampled Sphacelotheca specimens and the
monotypic genus Liroa. Support for the group seemed to
be especially vulnerable to alignment conditions, ranging
from 57% (MAFFT) to 91% (POA). Microbotryum group I
was unsupported if alignment-ambiguous regions were
excluded. There was again 61% support for an arrangement indicating that M. bistortarum does not belong to
group I (not shown). In the strict consensus inferred from
the three concatenated alignments, M. bistortarum separated basally within Microbotryum group I, its different
specimens forming a monophyletic group with support
values of 100%.
The following two groups, the apparently paraphyletic
Microbotryum group II and the apparently monophyletic
Microbotryum group III, clustered together. This sistergroup relationship was weakly to moderately (59–73%)
supported under all alignment conditions. Likewise, it
received 71% bootstrap support after exclusion of lowquality alignment columns.
Microbotryum group II appeared as paraphyletic, although
without support, and contained parasites of a broad range
of host families including Polygonaceae, Asteraceae, Dipsacaceae, Lentibulariaceae, and Lamiaceae. M. intermedium on Scabiosa formed a monophyletic group,
unsupported if alignment-ambiguous columns were
excluded but supported by bootstrap values ranging from
88% (MAFFT) to 99% (POA), otherwise, together with M.
pinguiculae and M. betonicae, parasites in the flowers of

Lentibulariaceae and Lamiaceae, respectively. The parasites of members of Asteraceae, M. tragoponis-pratensis, M.
scorzonerae, M. onopordi, and M. scolymi formed a monophyletic group in strict consensus. However, strong (97%)
support for this clade was only revealed with the PCMA
alignment. The clade was unsupported under the other
alignment conditions and also if alignment-ambiguous
regions were excluded. There was, however, strong (97–
100%) support under all alignment conditions for the
hypothesis that M. scorzonerae on Scorzonera hispanica is
more closely related to M. tragopogonis-pratensis than to M.
scorzonerae on Scorzonera humilis.
M. anomalum, a smut parasitising the flowers of Fallopia
aubertii (Polygonaceae), was revealed as the sister group of
the caryophyllaceous anther smuts (i.e., Microbotryum
group III) but with only weak support with the MAFFT
alignment (57%) and no support in the other analyses. A
seed parasite of Holosteum umbellatum (Caryophyllaceae),
M. holostei, was also situated in Microbotryum group II.
However, it seems not to be directly related to the anther
smuts of Caryophyllaceae since it formed a monophyletic
lineage with specimens of M. scabiosae, anther smuts on
the genus Knautia (Dipsacaceae). Yet the support for this
relationship was low.
M. stygium, which parasitises the flowers of Rumex acetosa
clustered together with the aforementioned three species
and with Microbotryum group III, but with no support for
its placement. The sister-group relationship of M. shastense
and M. vinosum both of which appear in flowers of Polygonaceae was unsupported by alignment-stable regions but
received moderate to strong (69–100%) support from
analyses of the three complete alignments, respectively.
Microbotryum group III represents the anther smuts of
Caryophyllaceae, which formed a monophyletic clade.
This clade was hardly supported (57%) after exclusion of
alignment-ambiguous columns, but received moderate to
strong support (79–90%) from analysis of the three complete alignments, respectively. Among the species
described to subdivide M. violaceum s.l., M. dianthorum got
moderate to strong support (74–92%) from all three complete alignments. Bootstrap support for M. stellariae
ranged from 99 to 100%. The recently described M. saponariae was also strongly supported by bootstrap values of
97–100%. These support values were lower if alignmentambiguous regions were excluded. Relationships between
these anther-inhabiting species were generally less well
resolved.
Maximum likelihood
The substitution models selected by the AICc were
TrN+I+G for each of the three complete alignments,
respectively, and GTR+I+G for the DIALIGN alignment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

after exclusion of low quality columns. The tree inferred
with PhyML under the best model from the PCMA alignment is shown in Fig. 2. The majority-rule consensus
including compatible groupings of the likelihood trees
obtained from each of the three complete alignments,
respectively, is shown in Fig. 3 together with bootstrap
values obtained by separate likelihood bootstrap analyses
of the alignments. Additionally, likelihood bootstrap values from the reduced dataset obtained by excluding alignment-ambiguous regions are indicated. In general,
support values from likelihood analyses were very similar
to the bootstrap results obtained under maximum parsimony and will not be discussed in detail here. The differences in support between the different alignments were
much larger than between likelihood and parsimony.

Discussion
Methodical aspects
Our multiple analysis approach shows that alignment
ambiguities can have a significant impact on branch support obtained by analysis of ITS sequences in Microbotryum, a factor which, as in many molecular phylogenetic
analyses, has not been investigated so far. Multiple analysis also shows that support for some clades is much more
vulnerable to alignment conditions than for other clades.
Parsimony bootstrap values indicating monophyly of
Microbotryum group I, for instance, range from 57% under
the MAFFT alignment to 91% under the POA alignment,
and the group receives no support from alignment-unambiguous regions alone. Microbotryum group III is unsupported (52% parsimony bootstrap) by alignment-stable
columns, too, but is considerably supported (79–90%
parsimony bootstrap) by analyses of the three complete
alignments, respectively. The latter case illustrates the utility of the strategies of Morrison and Ellis [28] and Lee [33]
since excluding all the ambiguous positions from the
analyses would have resulted in an unnecessary loss of resolution.

Alignments are always just hypotheses of homology of
single nucleotides. Alignment positions may be impossible to homologise unambiguously, but if several hypotheses about their homology result in the same groupings in
a phylogenetic tree, these groups can be considered supported independently of a specific alignment applied. Furthermore, using automated approaches to alignment
avoids the problems of the investigator's bias and the lack
of reproducibility that may be related to manual alignments [32].
Partly due to computation time limitations, we only
tested three different alignment implementations and
probably were unable to fully explore the space of possible solutions to ITS multiple sequence alignment. On the
other hand, the three programs we applied are well ranked

in simulation studies (e.g., better than the often used
CLUSTAL software; [36-38]) and are able to align larger
numbers of sequences in reasonable time (in contrast to,
e.g., T-Coffee), justifying our selection. Based on this
background, we believe the multiple analysis strategy
applied here to produce reliable information. The large
number of positions not identically aligned between the
three alignments made us confident that the alignment
space investigated was not too narrow. The influence of
different alignments was analysed for the first time in
Microbotryaceae and future research should account for
these effects, as support values may be quite vulnerable to
alignment conditions. The apparently alignment-independent support for other groupings, however, indicates
the value of ITS rDNA for phylogenetic purposes in the
Microbotryaceae. Furthermore, there is currently no evidence that phylogenetic trees inferred from ITS are more
sensitive to alignment conditions in Microbotryaceae
than in other groups of comparable rank, because these
effects have rarely been investigated.
Phylogenetics of Microbotryaceae
By means of ITS data we were able to obtain hypotheses
on the inter- and intra-generic relationships of the Microbotryaceae (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In the following, the phylogenetic hypotheses obtained will be discussed with a focus
on characters, such as morphology and hosts, that are
considered to be important in the systematics of the
Microbotryaceae [6,12,16,17,39]. The distribution of
major traits is, as an overview, mapped on the phylogeny
in Fig. 1. With respect to the structure of the spore surface,
we found it appropriate to distinguish between the height
of the ornamentation and its shape, as we observed four
combinations: flat warts, flat meshes, high warts, and high
meshes. The other characters are well known from literature.
Family delimitations
Based on the classification of genera as members of the
Microbotryaceae by the absence of a septal porus in
mature hyphae [12] we included two Ustilentyloma species
in the analysis for rooting purposes. Their separation from
members of the Microbotryaceae is supported by high
bootstrap values under all alignment conditions (Figs. 1,
3). However, more genera of Ustilentylomataceae as well
as further outgroup taxa would have to be included in the
analysis to support the family concept in the Microbotryales presented by Weiss et al. [15], which is based on
ultrastructural characters.
Bauerago
The lineage in the Microbotryaceae diverging basally is
formed by the two Bauerago species. This arrangement,
however, receives considerable bootstrap support only
from the POA alignment. Even though they do not para-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

sitise Poaceae as Ustilentyloma does, Bauerago species are
also parasites of a monocotyledonous family, the Juncaceae. In contrast to Ustilentyloma, which forms its sori in
leaves, Bauerago forms its sori in the ovaries of its host. As
the genus Aurantiosporium, also a member of the Ustilentylomataceae, forms its sori in the spikelets of Cyperaceae
[40], future work is needed to resolve the question if sorus
formation in the inflorescence is a plesiomorphic character for the Microbotryaceae.
For the three following groups the phylogenies show that
species pathogenic of Polygonaceae are paraphyletic (Figs.
1, 2, 3). Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that
parasitism on Polygonaceae is the ancestral state for
Microbotryaceae on Eudicot hosts.
Microbotryum group I
This group, strongly supported only from the POA alignment and weakly supported under other conditions, manifests a generic clutter, as it contains Sphacelotheca, Liroa,
and Microbotryum species (Figs. 1, 3). The group is very
diverse in spore ornamentation, height of respective spore
ornaments (i.e., warts in case of verrucose spores and
meshes of a net-like structure in case of reticulate spores),
and location of sorus formation. In general, average
height of the spore ornament in this group seems to be
much lower than in the other groups [17,39], but as the
ornament heights of Liroa emodensis and M. tuberculiforme
show, there are also exceptions to this rule [17,18]. Both
species occur on hosts in East Asia [17], but do not appear
to be monophyletic. Additionally, spores of many members of this group show a verrucose ornamentation. Only
three species of caryophyllaceous anther smuts, M. chloranthae-verrucosum, M. violaceo-irregulare and M. violaceoverrucosum, evolved this trait as well, but their spore ornaments seem rather high [7,39]. In addition to verrucose
ornamentation there is also reticulate ornamentation in
Microbotryum group I as in Liroa emodensis or M. tuberculiforme and, strikingly, in-between forms as in M. bosniacum
[17,18,39]. Location of sorus formation reaches from the
ovaries (e.g. Sphacelotheca polygoni-serrulati), the inflorescence axis and the pedicels (Liroa emodensis), over the stem
(e.g. M. nepalense) to the leaves (M. pustulatum) and, therefore, must not be considered as being fixed in that group.
The only unifying non-molecular character known for this
group so far is the parasitism on members of the genus
Polygonum, a feature, however, that also occurs in members of Microbotryum group II. Hence, there is so far no
morphological or ecological support for the monophyly
of group I. As its bootstrap support values are also highly
vulnerable to alignment conditions, the monophyletic
status of the group remains doubtful.

The specimens of M. bistortarum on Polygonum viviparum
form a monophyletic lineage that is very well supported

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:35

by a parsimony and likelihood bootstrap of 100% respectively. As seen in the phylogenetic tree from likelihood
analyses (Fig. 2) this group is also separated from the
other members of the Microbotryum group I by a large
genetic distance. Since specimen mk071 has been collected in Mongolia and mk070 and mk080 are from
Europe (see Table 1), this lineage exhibits a high uniformity in the ITS sequence even over large geographic distances. Whether or not this is related to the mostly
apomictic proliferation of P. viviparum [41] remains to be
clarified.
Microbotryum group II
In general, members of the following two groups form
their sori in the host inflorescence but some of the basal
members in Microbotryum group II develop their sori in
stems (M. parlatorei) or leaves (M. kuehneanum), both this
group and the Microbotryum group III exhibit high spore
ornaments [17,39], and Microbotryum group II is additionally characterized by an abundance of host families.

All analyses based on complete alignments show high
support values for the monophyly of the group containing
M. intermedium, M. betonicae, and M. pinguiculae (Figs. 1,
3); this is an astonishing aspect: even though all of these
species form their sori in the anthers they parasitise on different host families. A possible explanation is that all of
the latter belong to Euasterids, with Lentibulariaceae and
Lamiaceae being very closely related [42]. Another aspect
shown by this work is that there could be at least two independent lineages of anther smuts on Dipsacaceae, both in
Microbotryum group II (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Polyphyly of Dipsacaceae parasites does not receive support in our analyses, however, the sister-group relationship of M.
intermedium on Scabiosa and parasites of Lentibulariaceae
and Lamiaceae is well supported. The ITS data cannot
reject the hypothesis of monophyly of a group consisting
of all the parasites of Dipsacaceae, Lentibulariaceae and
Lamiaceae included in this study. Given the monophyly
of this group, the most parsimonious interpretation is the
paraphyly of the smut fungi on Dipsacaceae with respect
to the parasites of the other two families. M. intermedium
is characterized by a pale spore mass colour whereas M.
scabiosae on Knautia shows a purplish-brown spore mass
colour [6]. If spore mass colour corresponds to monophyletic lineages in the dipsacaceous anther smuts, one
would predict that M. succisae (for which no molecular
data were available) clusters with M. scabiosae and that M.
flosculorum and M. cephalariae (which were not included
in our sample either) cluster with M. intermedium. On the
other hand, it has been shown that the host genera Cephalaria (M. cephalariae), Succisa (M. flosculorum, M. succisae),
and Knautia (M. flosculorum, M. scabiosae) are more closely
related to each other than the hosts of M. cephalariae and
M. flosculorum to Scabiosa [43]. Future work in this group

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

will show if host relationships have had a significant effect
on parasite phylogeny and if spore mass colour, although
rather variable in the Microbotryaceae, is a valuable character in smaller subclades.
The parasites on Asteraceae, based on the presented
molecular phylogeny, form a monophyletic group (Figs.
1, 3), although without support. In traditional taxonomy
parasites in this group are distinguished by spore mass
colour, spore size and host plant. Most interesting is the
relationship between M. tragopogonis-pratensis and M. scorzonerae, as there seem to be parasites on Scorzonera that are
more closely related to parasites on Tragopogon than to
other Scorzonera parasites; this relationship is strongly
supported under all alignment conditions and may indicate that there is a parasite being able to infect both hosts.
However, genetic distances between the parasite of Scorzonera humilis and M. tragopogonis-pratensis are much
lower than between these and the parasite of Scorzonera
hispanica (Fig. 2). Hence, M. tragopogonis-pratensis might
be able to parasitise some members of Scorzonera, but also
a separate lineage of Scorzonera parasites might exist; this
may be due to a host shift from Tragopogon pratensis to
Scorzonera humilis or vice versa. A relatively recent host
shift has been described in Microbotryum violaceum s.l.
from Petroraghia saxifraga to Gypsophila repens [44]. Additional research, based on, e.g., infection experiments or
genotyping, is needed to clarify whether a host jump
recently occurred in M. tragopogonis-pratensis, too, or
whether or not a relatively low host specificity is an
ancient condition in this parasite.
Microbotryum group III
Previous phylogenetic studies of members of Microbotryum were, with the exception of [24], restricted to caryophyllaceous anther smuts and used other Microbotryum
species only as outgroups to root trees. Our results, based
on a broader species spectrum, confirm the results of previous studies [3,7,24] that the anther smuts of Caryophyllaceae form a monophyletic group. There are several
monophyletic clades observed in this group which can be
assigned to different parasite species (Figs. 1, 2, 3) and
which are consistent with most traditional approaches to
the taxonomy of these anther smuts [6]. Based on infection experiments, the splitting of the former Microbotryum
violaceum s.l. comprising all anther smuts of Caryophyllaceae in a couple of species with narrow host ranges was
already proposed by Liro [11]. The large genetic distances
within Microbotryum violaceum s.l. compared to the distances between and within other Microbotryum species
(Fig. 2) are in disagreement with its treatment as a single
species (comp. [3,10]). Furthermore, the subgroups of
Microbotryum violaceum s.l. apparently developed stable
narrow host specificities as well as stable morphological
differences in at least M. chloranthae-verrucosum, M. viola-

ceo-irregulare and M. violaceo-verrucosum, all three with warts on the spore surface, lacking
a reticulum [6]. Aiming at a natural classification of this group, future work in anther
smuts of Caryophyllaceae will have to split the assemblage into more narrowly defined
species, building on the work of Liro [11] and other authors.
Many clades within Microbotryum violaceum s.l. are restricted to hosts that are themselves
closely related (e.g. M. dianthorum, M. saponariae, M. stellariae; Fig. 2). Indeed, preliminary
analyses showed the dominance of cospeciation events in caryophyllaceous anther smuts
and their hosts [4]. The trees presented here confirm that the species on the native North
American hosts Silene caroliniana spp. caroliniana, Silene caroliniana spp. pensylvanica and
Silene virginica belong to a sister group of the species from native European hosts [3]. This
implies that the two groups diverged before the radiation of the European anther smuts.
On the other hand, Lutz et al. [7] demonstrated that parasites on the native North American host Silene douglasii cluster together with the European M. lychnidis-dioicae lineages.
Whether this is due to a recent host shift from an invasive host or whether the parasite is
also native to North America remains to be clarified.
Sister taxon of the caryophyllaceous anther smuts is M. anomalum, a parasite destroying
the ovaries and the filaments of Fallopia aubertii (Polygonaceae). The seed parasite M.
holostei on Holosteum umbellatum (Caryophyllaceae) forms a monophyletic lineage with
two specimens of the dipsacaceous anther smut M. scabiosae on Knautia species; this lineage appears as a sister taxon of M. anomalum and the anther smuts of Caryophyllaceae. The
species presumably most closely related to the caryophyllaceous anther smuts raise several
new questions about the evolutionary history of parasitism on Caryophyllaceae and of
anther smuts in general. If the cluster comprising Microbotryum group III, M. anomalum, M.
holostei, and M. scabiosae forms a monophylum, their ancestor already had been an anther
smut. Our data do not reject this hypothesis. If future work confirms the position of M.
anomalum between the two lineages of anther smuts, it can be assumed that they have
evolved twice independently; this would also imply that the colonization of Caryophyllaceae occurred twice: once in the anthers and once in the seeds. If the position of M.
anomalum proves to be wrong and the two lineages appear as sister taxa, the ancestor of
both might have been a caryophyllaceous anther smut. Afterwards, parasitism in the seeds
of Caryophyllaceae could have evolved, leading to M. holostei, and another group of parasites originated from a jump on Dipsacaceae as a host family, leading to M. scabiosae. That

the anther smuts can more or less easily jump from one host family to another is ind
by the fact that anther parasites on three different host families cluster in one grou
betonicae, M. pinguiculae, M. intermedium; see above and compare Figs. 1, 2). In the li
these questions, it would also be desirable to determine the phylogenetic position
other seed parasites of Caryophyllaceae and the ovary parasite M. morinae on Morina
folia (Dipsacaceae).

As anther smuts parasitise on different host families, the question occurs why rad
was much more extensive in anther smuts of Caryophyllaceae as on the other host
lies. Previous work has shown that in Europe and North America 113 species of th
Caryophyllaceae are hosts for anther smuts [5], which means that about 13.3% are
sitised. In contrast, only 11 (4.4-3.6%) out of the 250–300 species of Dipsacacea
known to be parasitised by anther smuts [6,39]. Although sampling bias may play a
it seems implausible that the observed pattern may completely be explained in tha
Nevertheless, future research should make a point of additional sampling effort in a
smuts on host families other than Caryophyllaceae.

Genus delimitations
The reinstatement of Microbotryum by Deml and Oberwinkler [45] only included a
smuts of Caryophyllaceae. Moore [46] proposed that Ustilago species of other dicoty
nous hosts should be put into the genus Bauhinus. Another approach, mainly bas
spore mass colour, was the inclusion of most of the Ustilago species on Eudicot host
Microbotryum [6].

Our molecular data do neither confirm nor reject the Bauhinus concept. Taking
account a consequently phylogenetic approach to taxonomy [47], however, it is als
dent that an ecological (i.e., with respect to host taxonomy) justification of the prop
genus Bauhinus is simply lacking, irrespective of our molecular results. If parasitising
ophyllaceae is the apomorphic trait, parasitism on other Eudicot families would be
omorphic and cannot be used to support monophyly of Bauhinus. If parasi
Caryophyllaceae is plesiomorphic (which is highly improbable regarding the mole
phylogenies as well as the distribution of this trait), the monophyletic status of Mic
ryum s.str. (excluding Bauhinus) could not be justified. Hence, the approach of Ván
seems to be the most appropriate taxonomic treatment of the group so far. However

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:35

posals as, e.g., to include Liroa into Microbotryum [19]
should also be considered. Our data do not reject the
monophyly of an extended genus Microbotryum including
Liroa.
Our work has shown that the genus delimitations of Liroa,
Microbotryum, and Sphacelotheca need to be reconsidered.
Whereas ITS data should be of great help with respect to
the delimitation of species (as discussed in the Microbotryum group III section) they still provide insufficient evidence with respect to the phylogenetic relationships
between genera of the Microbotryaceae in some parts of
the tree mostly due to alignment ambiguities. A phylogenetic hypothesis of Microbotryaceae, based on more species or carefully selected species and incorporation of
phenotypic as well as additional molecular markers, is
needed. A more exhaustive phylogeny may help to understand but may also raise new questions here and in other
fields of anther smut research.

Conclusion
In this study we have used data derived from nuclear ITS
and a multiple analysis approach to sequence alignment
to address phylogenetic questions in the parasitic fungal
family Microbotryaceae. As our analyses confirm the studies of other authors that branch support values for some
clades are highly dependent on the alignment approach
used, we conclude that more attention should be given to
alignment construction in phylogenetic analyses in general. Other clades are robustly supported throughout the
alignment space, indicating that the exclusion of ambiguously-aligned regions can lead to a loss of phylogenetically valuable information. Some evidence is presented
that the genus Microbotryum is paraphyletic, as some
Microbotryum species form a group with the genera Liroa
and Sphacelotheca, even though support values for this
hypothesis are vulnerable to alignment conditions. As the
pathogens on Polygonaceae appear to be paraphyletic, we
conclude that parasitism on this family forms the ancestral state and parasitism on other plant families is derived.
The data also indicate that sorus formation in the reproductive organs of the host is not the derived state but
might have been present already in the ancestor of Microbotryaceae. Based on a larger dataset as in previous studies, we could confirm the monophyly of the
caryophyllaceous anther smuts and that there exists a
group of North American anther smuts on native hosts
that is clearly separated from the European clade. Furthermore, the analyses revealed a second clade of anther
smuts, containing parasites on Dipsacaceae, Lamiaceae,
and Lentibulariaceae, yet, it remains unresolved how the
two groups of anther smuts are related to each other. The
parasites on Asteraceae form a monophyletic group,
although without support.

Methods
Sample sources, nomenclature, and morphological
information
The specimens examined in this study are listed in Table
1. The nomenclature follows [6,7,39]. Assignment of
specimens to species was based on location of sori, spore
surface ornamentation, spore mass colour and host data
as described by [7,39]. If specimens could not unequivocally be ascribed, the name "Microbotryum violaceum s.l."
was used as in Vánky [39]. Morphological characters and
character state distributions of specimens were compiled
from Vánky [6,16,39] and, except characters only observable with scanning electron microscopy, directly checked
on the specimens available to us.
DNA-extraction, PCR, and sequencing
In order to extract genomic DNA the DNeasy™ Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used. The ITS region localized
between the 18S and 28S rRNA genes was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using ITS1f and ITS4
[48] or ITS1 and ITS4 [49], respectively, as primers to
obtain an approximately 700 bp long DNA fragment. To
purify the PCR products, the QIAquick™ Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used. Samples were sequenced with the
BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit V3.1 (Applied
Biosystems) on an automatic sequencer (ABI 3100
Genetic Analyser). DNA sequences determined in the
course of this study were deposited in GenBank, accession
numbers are given in Table 1.

Additionally, the following sequences from GenBank
were used: [AF045876, AF045878, AF045879, AF045880,

Sequence alignment
As described above, we followed both a "multiple analysis" [33] as well as an exclusion strategy to explore the
alignment-dependency of the phylogenetic results. For
exclusion of alignment-ambiguous regions, ITS sequences
were aligned with DIALIGN 2.2.1 [50] using the -n
option. In contrast to the majority of alignment tools,
DIALIGN constructs a multiple sequence alignment
(including a quality score for each alignment column)
from whole sequence fragments found in local pair-wise
alignments. All positions that obtained a quality score as
low as 0 or 1 were excluded before inferring trees; this procedure automatically lead to the deletion of positions
with a lot of leading or trailing gaps due to incomplete

Page 12 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:35

sequencing too. Additionally, DIALIGN frequently
regards stretches of bases in single sequences as unaligned; these were coded as missing data.
For multiple analysis, MAFFT [36] was used under the
FFT-NS-i option, i.e. with fast construction of an initial
alignment followed by iterative refinement until convergence. The POA software [51] uses the partial order graph
format to effectively store alignment information. POA
was run in progressive and local mode (-do_progressive read_pairscores <filename>) after computing pair-wise
sequence similarities with the make_pscores.pl script provided with the POA package (we slightly modified the
script for use with DNA BLAST instead of protein BLAST).
PCMA [38] uses the faster Clustal algorithm [52] for similar sequences and the slower but more accurate T-Coffee
algorithm [53] for more divergent sequences. We used ave_grp_id = 90, i.e. forced all sequence groups with less
than 90% identity to be aligned with T-Coffee.
Positions of many leading or trailing gaps were excluded
before inferring phylogenetic trees. Cross-comparison
between the three alignments also revealed that some
short (about 2–10 bp) stretches of bases in a few
sequences in two of the alignments were likely to be misaligned due to incomplete sequencing resulting in long
leading or trailing gaps in these sequences; these stretches
were coded as missing data. No manual "corrections"
were applied as recommended by Giribet and Wheeler
[54] and Gatesy et al. [32].
Maximum parsimony heuristic search (as explained
below) was then performed on a data matrix obtained by
concatenating these three alignments, similar to the elision method of Wheeler et al. [31]. Bootstrapping, however, requires statistical independency of all alignment
positions [33]. Accordingly, bootstrap analyses were performed separately for the different alignments. In principle, a common majority-rule consensus can then be
computed to summarize the results of such a "multiple
analysis" [33], as discussed in Farris et al. [34]. However,
we preferred to show the different support values as in
Morrison and Ellis [28], since the magnitude of the difference between the bootstrap supports inferred from different alignments reveals how sensitive the respective clades
were to the alignment algorithm applied.
Phylogenetic analysis
With PAUP*, a heuristic search under the maximum parsimony criterion (e.g., [55]) was performed using 200 replicates with random addition of sequences and
subsequent TBR branch swapping (multrees option in
effect, steepest descent option not in effect). Gaps were
treated as missing data. Due to the large number of
equally parsimonious trees found, no more than 25 trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/35

of score greater than or equal to 1 were saved in each replicate. Bootstrap analysis [56] under maximum parsimony was conducted with PAUP* as well using 1000
replicates. In each bootstrap replicate, 25 random
sequence addition replicates followed by TBR search were
performed, saving no more than 10 trees of score greater
than or equal to 1 per replicate and using a reconnection
limit of 12. Uninformative characters were excluded
before bootstrapping.
To obtain appropriate substitution models for maximum
likelihood analysis, each alignment was analysed with
Modeltest 3.6 [57] using the Akaike information criterion
in its AICc variant [58]. Under the respective model
found, likelihood analyses were then performed with
PhyML 2.4.4 [59]. For bootstrapping, PhyML's built-in
bootstrap function was used with 500 replicates, respectively.
Based on studies of [15], two Ustilentyloma species belonging to the Ustilentylomataceae, which is the sister group
of the Microbotryaceae, were used to root the trees. All
alignments together with the trees inferred from them
were deposited in TREEBASE [60] and are included as files
in NEXUS format with comments in the supplementary
material [see Additional file 1].

Authors' contributions
MK collected specimens in the field; obtained most of the
genomic DNA; conducted the majority of the ITS rDNA
sequencing; and wrote the manuscript. MG conducted the
sequence alignments; performed the phylogenetic analyses; and wrote the manuscript. MK and MG collected the
morphological data. FO provided ideas and support for
phylogenetic work. DB collected specimens in the field;
isolated some of the genomic DNA; revised the text; introduced MK to the field of molecular systematics; and supervised his Ph.D. thesis. All authors read and approved the
final manuscript.
