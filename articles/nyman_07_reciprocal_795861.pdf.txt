Abstract
Background: Plants, plant-feeding insects, and insect parasitoids form some of the most complex
and species-rich food webs. According to the classic escape-and-radiate (EAR) hypothesis, these
hyperdiverse communities result from coevolutionary arms races consisting of successive cycles of
enemy escape, radiation, and colonization by new enemy lineages. It has also been suggested that
"enemy-free space" provided by novel host plants could promote host shifts by herbivores, and that
parasitoids could similarly drive diversification of gall form in insects that induce galls on plants.
Because these central coevolutionary hypotheses have never been tested in a phylogenetic
framework, we combined phylogenetic information on willow-galling sawflies with data on their
host plants, gall types, and enemy communities.
Results: We found that evolutionary shifts in host plant use and habitat have led to dramatic
prunings of parasitoid communities, and that changes in gall phenotype can provide "enemy-free
morphospace" for millions of years even in the absence of host plant shifts. Some parasites have
nevertheless managed to colonize recently-evolved gall types, and this has apparently led to
adaptive speciation in several enemy groups. However, having fewer enemies does not in itself
increase speciation probabilities in individual sawfly lineages, partly because the high diversity of the
enemy community facilitates compensatory attack by remaining parasite taxa.
Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that niche-dependent parasitism is a major force
promoting ecological divergence in herbivorous insects, and that prey divergence can cause
speciation in parasite lineages. However, the results also show that the EAR hypothesis is too
simplistic for species-rich food webs: instead, diversification seems to be spurred by a continuous
stepwise process, in which ecological and phenotypic shifts in prey lineages are followed by a lagged
evolutionary response by some of the associated enemies.

Background
One of the main challenges of biological research is to
understand the evolutionary assembly and maintenance
of complex, multitrophic food webs [1,2]. The classic

escape-and-radiate (EAR) hypothesis [3] envisions the
current remarkable diversity of plants and herbivorous
insects [4,5] as a result of a cyclic coevolutionary process:
a plant lineage that acquires a new defensive trait (e.g., a

toxic chemical) becomes free to proliferate and rapidly
divides into multiple descendant lineages [3,6]. Over
time, the defenses of the new clade are overcome by some
insect species, which now enter a vacant adaptive zone
and diversify to exploit the species of the hitherto herbivore-free plant group [3,7]. A new cycle of diversification
starts whenever a novel defense evolves in one of the plant
lineages.
Although the EAR hypothesis was originally formulated in
terms of plants and herbivores, it has recently been suggested that a concurrent EAR process operates between
plant-feeding insects and their associated parasitoids
[1,8]. Parasitic insects typically inflict heavy mortality on
herbivore populations [9,10], and the specialized host use
of both insect herbivores and parasitoids leads to the
intriguing possibility that these hyperdiverse interaction
networks are created "from within", that is, by diversifying
effects that are transmitted or even amplified through
many trophic levels. "Bottom-up" speciation cascades
could result if diversification of plants spurs speciation of
herbivores [5,7,11] that, in turn, leads to increased
resource diversity for associated parasitoids [2,12,13].
"Top-down" diversifying forces could be equally important if parasitoids use plants as cues for finding their host
insects; in such cases, an evolutionary shift to a novel host
plant could provide "enemy-free space" for the herbivores
[9,14,15]. Release from enemies could accelerate diversification in the herbivore lineage that, in turn, would create
more possibilities for parasitoid speciation.
Diversifying selection exerted by natural enemies might
similarly underlie the unusual diversity of many gallinducing insect groups. The ability to induce galls on
plants has evolved convergently in dozens of distantly
related insect taxa and, as a result of spectacular adaptive
radiations, many of these groups contain hundreds of species that differ markedly with respect to their host plant
use and gall morphology [16,17]. Phylogeny-based comparative studies have demonstrated that galls represent
"extended phenotypes" of the gallers, meaning that gall
form and location is determined mainly by the galling
insects and not by their host plants [17,18]. Because galler
parasitoids have to penetrate a protective wall of modified
plant tissue in order to gain access to their victims, Stone
and Schönrogge [17] recently concluded that morphology-dependent parasitism remains the most plausible
adaptive explanation for the diversification of gall form,
but they also noted that the needed phylogenetic tests are
lacking.
Despite its intuitive appeal, the EAR hypothesis has never
been tested in a phylogenetic framework [8]. Therefore,
we investigated how phylogenetic patterns of parasitism
and diversification in gall-inducing sawflies belonging to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/49

the nematine subtribe Euurina (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) conform to the predictions of the hypothesis. Euurina sawflies induce leaf folds or rolls, or various closed
galls on willows (Salix spp.) and, at over 400 species, the
subtribe includes over 10 times more species than its sister
group with larvae that feed externally on leaves [19,20].
Their main sources of mortality are larvae of parasitoids
(that feed on galler larvae) and parasitic inquilines (that
consume gall tissues but kill the sawfly larvae in the process) [19,21]. In all, the associated enemy complex comprises nearly 100 species that belong to 17 families in four
insect orders [19,22]. Sawfly gallers are particularly suited
for studying the evolutionary assembly of complex food
webs, because while each galler species is typically a specialist on a single willow species, all of the seven main
types of closed galls can be found on multiple willow
hosts [19,21]; this cross-replication of willows and galls
makes it possible to tease apart the respective effects of
host plants and gall phenotypes on the composition of
the enemy community attacking each galler species.

Results and discussion
As a first step, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of
willow gallers on the basis of DNA sequence data from
two mitochondrial genes (see Methods). The strongly supported phylogeny (Figure 1) confirms earlier results that
species inducing closed galls evolved from external-feeding sawfly lineages via leaf folders [18,20], and demonstrates that the galler community on any given willow
species is a collection of sawflies inducing different galls
that have colonized the host, or one of its ancestors, at different time intervals.
Contrasting the galler phylogeny with quantitative data
on the mortalities inflicted by inquiline and parasitoid
species shows that evolutionary changes in many different
ecological traits can lead to full or partial release from natural enemies (Figure 2). Permutation tests demonstrate a
strong correlation between galler phylogeny and specieslevel enemy communities (Figure 3A, p < 0.0001), which
mainly follows from the fact that the largest differences in
enemy communities occur among gall types, which are
likewise strongly conserved with respect to the galler tree.
Constraining permutations of species-level enemy communities to occur only within gall types also leads to
longer data lengths (Figure 3B, p = 0.0022), but the
increase tends to be less pronounced than in unconstrained randomizations. Within gall-type groups, enemy
communities in many cases differ markedly among willow species, but a statistically significant host plant effect
extends also across gall-type boundaries (Figure 3C;
paired samples t test, t = -1.72, 95% c.i. -∞ to -0.104, onetailed p = 0.043). These results are robust enough to be
found also in randomization tests based on qualitative

Evolutionary diversification of gall morphology and host plant
Evolutionary diversification of gall morphology and host
plant use in willow-galling sawflies. The tree is according to a
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 1 528 bp of DNA sequence data
from two mitochondrial genes (see Methods), numbers above
branches show posterior probabilities of clades. Host plants are
indicated after the sawfly species names. Ancestral gall types were
reconstructed using Accelerated transformations parsimony optimization (the ancestral state of the Euura clade is equivocal, but it
was probably shoot galling [18]). The pie diagram at the node
between Euura and their sister group shows the relative likelihood
of different gall locations as reconstructed by maximum likelihood.

(presence/absence) data on enemy communities (Figure
4A–C).
Sawflies inducing identical galls on different host species
are in many cases attacked by very different parasite
assemblages (Figure 2), which indicates that directional
selection coefficients imposed by natural enemies can be
extremely strong during host plant shifts. For example,
host-provided enemy-free space evidently can be found
especially on several distantly related willow species that
grow in sub-arctic and arctic-alpine habitats (e.g., S. lapponum, S. reticulata, and S. myrsinites) where, for example, the predominantly southern inquilines Curculio crux
(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and Hydriomena ruberata
(Lepidoptera: Geometridae) occur only rarely (Figure 2).
Conversely, leaf gallers on northern willows generally suffer from increased attack by the parasitic wasps Shawiana
lapponica and Lathrostizus flexicauda (Hymenoptera:

Ichneumonidae). Contrasting selection pressures caused
by spatial and temporal variation in enemy communities
[22-24] could explain why some prevalent and seriously
lethal parasite species have been both lost and gained during the diversification of leaf-galling sawfly lineages (Figure 2).
However, the most dramatic shift in enemy communities
coincides with the evolutionary transition from the ancestral condition of leaf galling to gall induction on shoots,
buds, and petioles (Figures 1 and 2). This seemingly
minor change in gall phenotype, which occurred at least
six million years ago [25], led to a near-complete elimination of parasitic inquilines and to a coincident pruning of
the parasitoid community (Figures 2 and 5A; Table 1),
demonstrating that gall-inducing insects can find immediate and long-lasting "enemy-free morphospace" even in
the absence of host plant shifts. The community plot
shows that the novel gall types were subsequently tracked
and colonized by parasitic lineages that apparently were
derived mainly from the ancestral pool of enemies. In
accordance with the EAR hypothesis, at least five probable
cases of adaptive splitting along gall-type boundaries can
be identified in the parasitic wasp genera Lathrostizus (Ichneumonidae), Pteromalus (Pteromalidae), and Eurytoma
(Eurytomidae) (Figure 2), probably because successful
attack on different galls requires specialized adaptations
in the parasitoids' search behaviors and ovipositor structures [10,22,24].
The central prediction of the EAR hypothesis is that
escapes from enemies trigger rapid radiations in prey lineages [3,6,8], but our phylogenetic results (Figures 1 and
2) directly contradict this proposition. Current estimates
[19,21] of species numbers in the conspicuously parasitepoor Euura clade (ca. 100 spp.) are lower than those of
their enemy-rich sister group composed of leaf midrib
bean and pea gallers (ca. 150 spp.), and both of these
clades contain more species than the monophyletic group
comprising the enemy-rich leaf blade bean and sausage
gallers (ca. 80 spp.). Additional comparative studies
involving other insect taxa are needed to confirm this conflicting pattern, but it has been argued that the prediction
of elevated speciation rates in enemy-free lineages has a
weak theoretical basis [8], and our data suggest two explanations for the absence of notable speciation bursts. First,
in complex food webs, release from some enemies can be
quickly compensated by an increase in the severity of
attack by the remaining ones, which is evidenced by a lack
of association between numbers of parasite species and
rates of parasite-inflicted mortality in comparisons across
galler species (Pearson's r = 0.165, p = 0.291; Figure 5B,
Table 2). Less obvious zero-sum games of survival are also
possible, so that while overall rates of parasitism are
slightly lower in Euura species than in leaf gallers, the ben-

Maximum rates of mortality inflicted by 72 inquiline and parasitoid species on 43 willow-galling sawfly species in relation
to the phylogeny, gall morphology, and host plants of the gallers. Sawfly names have been omitted, but their order is the same
as in Figure 1. Each column in the plot represents one inquiline or parasitoid species, maximum rates of parasitism observed in extensive
population rearings of each galler species [21,22] are indicated by the colour of the cells (see legend). See Additional file 1 for exact rates
of parasitism. Enemy species and genera mentioned in the text are highlighted by a coloured font, and the taxon to which each parasite
species belongs is indicated below the matrix (note that the wasp genus Eurytoma includes two parasitoids and an inquiline). Numbers of
dissected galls, collection localities, and population rearings are given in the last two columns. Numbers above branches on the tree show
Bayesian posterior probabilities (only values ≥ 50% shown, asterisks denote clades with a 100% posterior probability).

efit seems to be offset by an increased susceptibility to
defence reactions on behalf of the host plants [19,22].
Second, if prey species are (like most plant feeding insects
[4,5]) themselves resource specialists, a moderate enemy
pressure might promote the prey's colonization of novel
niches (e.g., plants [9,14,15]) and thus facilitate ecological speciation in prey lineages. This could especially be the
case if geographical variation in enemy assemblages drives
different populations of widespread prey species into
using different resources.

Conclusion
Coevolutionary studies on parasitoids and their prey commonly focus on physiological defenses and counterdefenses [26], but our results clearly show that ecological
traits constitute a central part of the defensive arsenal of
herbivorous insects. Prior to a niche shift, an evolving
prey lineage must exhibit a polymorphism in resource

use, which can be followed by quick fixation of one of the
alternative states whenever different resources are associated with different enemy attack patterns. Furthermore,
our finding that several parasitoid lineages have
responded to gall-type divergence by adaptive speciation
provides strong support for suggestions [1,2,8] that coevolutionary arms races have played an important role in
the generation of the unusual diversity of herbivorous
insects and parasitoids. Nevertheless, our data also indicate that in its classic form the EAR hypothesis is too simplistic to explain reciprocal diversification effects in
complex food webs, in which escapes from enemies will
tend to be too brief to lead to the predicted speciation
bursts. Instead, the observed patterns of parasitism and
diversification are consistent with a scenario of stepwise
antagonistic coevolution: colonization of new ecological
niches by prey lineages is being continuously driven by
temporary relief from parasitism, after which an evolu-

tionary response by some of the associated enemies
returns mortalities to normal levels. In its complexity, the
willow-galler-parasite food web is representative of many
antagonistic networks in which specialized interactions
link species across multiple trophic levels. A close integration of ecological and evolutionary research is clearly
needed if the origins of such networks are to be fully
understood.

Methods
Parasitism data and taxon sampling
Enemy rearing methods and collection localities of galler
population samples have been described previously
[21,22]. In brief, populations were sampled extensively
throughout Europe between 1981 and 1998, and galls
were opened to score the presence of galler or parasitoid/

inquiline larvae. Enemy larvae were classified to preliminary morphospecies, and the identity of each morphospecies was determined by connecting them to adults
emerging after hibernation. The severity of parasitism by
each enemy species in each galler species was defined as
the maximum observed level of mortality inflicted in the
population samples (see Additional file 1 for exact rates of
parasitism), which is a valid indicator of the potential
importance of natural enemies [10]. To control for sampling effects, our phylogenetic analysis includes the 43
galler species (Table 3) that have parasitism data from at
least four locations and a total sample size of over 400
galls. In accordance with previous results [18,25], we used
the free-feeding nematine Nematus melanaspis and four
leaf-folding or -rolling Phyllocolpa species as outgroups in
the phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogeny reconstruction
DNA sequence data was generated for 1528 base pairs of
two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I: 810 bp;
cytochrome b: 718 bp) using protocols described previously [18,25]. All sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers DQ302205, DQ302212,
and EU083911–EU084004. Modeltest 3.5 [27] was used
in conjunction with PAUP* 4.0b10 [28] to select the
GTR+I+Γ4 substitution model subsequently implemented
in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis in MrBayes 3.1.1 [29].
Two parallel runs employing default priors and consisting
of four incrementally heated chains (t = 0.2) were run for
six million generations while sampling trees from the current cold chain every 100 generations, and 110002 postburn-in trees were used to calculate a Bayesian consensus
tree. Because the tree is strongly supported and maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of
the sequence data led to near-identical results, only the
Bayesian tree was used in the permutation tests described
below.

Gall type was included as a fixed factor and number of parasite species as a covariate in the ANCOVA model (see Figure 5B). Mortalities were
arcsine square root transformed prior to the analysis.
*R2 = 0.397 (adjusted R2 = 0.293).

Character evolution analyses and statistical tests
Ancestral gall types were inferred by accelerated transformations parsimony optimization [30], and ancestral gall
locations (leaf, shoot, bud, or petiole) by maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction in Mesquite 1.11 [31]. In the
ML analysis, we employed an Mk1 model (= equal forward and reverse rates) after pruning the external-feeding
outgroup from the galler tree. Because maximum rates of
parasitism by different enemy species are not independent
in galler population samples, we treated species-level
enemy communities (= rows in the table in Additional file
1) as the observation for each galler species, and then
devised three alternative permutations of enemy communities over galler species to test correlations between the
parasitism matrix and the galler phylogeny. If parasite
communities tend to be similar among closely related galler species, the length of the enemy data, as calculated on
the basis of the galler topology, will be shorter than
expected from random assignment. Data length [32] was
calculated first from the observed data, and subsequently
from 10000 random permutations of enemy communities over galler species. The probability that by chance data
is as short as observed is calculated by comparing the
observed data length with the distribution of permuted
data lengths. Possible phylogenetic correlations within
gall types were tested by restricting the permutations to
occur only among sawfly species that induce similar galls.

To test whether an effect of the willow host species
extends across gall-type boundaries, we used a paired
replacement procedure: the enemy community of a randomly chosen galler species was replaced with the enemy
communities of two randomly selected species. Those two
species had the same gall type (different from that of the
species being replaced) but only one of those two had a
different host plant. The other species thus had the same
host plant as the species being replaced. The absolute
change in data length was calculated for each of the two
replacements, and subsequently the difference in datalength change was calculated between the two replacements. If the replacement with a species that shares the

host plant with the species being replaced results in a
smaller absolute change in data length, the difference in
absolute data length change becomes negative (and conversely, positive if the species not sharing the host plant
yields a smaller data-length change). The distribution of
differences in absolute tree-length change resulting from
10000 such paired replacements was evaluated against the
null hypothesis (= mean change in absolute data length
equal) using a paired samples t test. For the purposes of
the species effect tests, willows belonging to two species
complexes consisting of sister taxa with extensive hybridization (S. alba and S. fragilis; and S. caprea, S. aurita, and
S. cinerea) were synonymized under two "superspecies".
All permutation and replacement tests were performed in
Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick,
MA 01760-2098, USA), see Additional file 2 for the scripts
used for the tests. ANCOVA tests used for testing factors
influencing numbers of associated parasitoid species and
rates of parasite-inflicted mortality were performed using
SPSS for Windows 14.0 (SPSS, Inc., 233 S. Wacker Drive,
Chicago, IL 60606-6307, USA).
