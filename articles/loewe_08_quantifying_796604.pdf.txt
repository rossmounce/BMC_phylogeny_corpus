Abstract
Background: The Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) is a small unisexual fish that has been suspected
of being threatened by extinction from the stochastic accumulation of slightly deleterious
mutations that is caused by Muller's ratchet in non-recombining populations. However, no detailed
quantification of the extent of this threat is available.
Results: Here we quantify genomic decay in this fish by using a simple model of Muller's ratchet
with the most realistic parameter combinations available employing the evolution@home global
computing system. We also describe simple extensions of the standard model of Muller's ratchet
that allow us to deal with selfing diploids, triploids and mitotic recombination. We show that
Muller's ratchet creates a threat of extinction for the Amazon molly for many biologically realistic
parameter combinations. In most cases, extinction is expected to occur within a time frame that is
less than previous estimates of the age of the species, leading to a genomic decay paradox.
Conclusion: How then does the Amazon molly survive? Several biological processes could
individually or in combination solve this genomic decay paradox, including paternal leakage of
undamaged DNA from sexual sister species, compensatory mutations and many others. More
research is needed to quantify the contribution of these potential solutions towards the survival of
the Amazon molly and other (ancient) asexual species.

Background
It is a general observation that asexual lineages do not last
over very long periods of time, but the precise reasons for
this are less clear [1]. Ancient asexuals are the rare exceptions to this rule and it is of considerable biological interest to know what mechanisms allow them to survive for so
long. They must have found a way to overcome the longterm fitness-degrading consequences of genetic processes

like Muller's ratchet and/or ecological processes like RedQueen dynamics [1-6]. Muller's ratchet describes the
long-term accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations
in asexual populations and has been suggested as a key
mechanism for the extinction of asexual species on the
long term [3,7,8]. Unfortunately most of these predictions
remain at a stage of verbal argument [1], making it very
difficult to rule out that Muller's ratchet may not have had

enough time to cause extinction. As the behavior of
Muller's ratchet can be very sensitive to model parameters
[7], realistic values need to be used to predict the consequences of mutation accumulation for a given ancient
asexual species. We employ a simple null hypothesis [see
[7]] for testing the threat of extinction from Muller's
ratchet in the unisexual fish Poecilia formosa, the Amazon
molly.
Overcoming the lack of quantification
Quantifications of the threat of extinction from Muller's
ratchet are often not trivial theoretical work that requires
either challenging mathematics [9] or complex computer
simulations [7] or both [7]. Therefore some adopt the
pragmatic approach that any system with no recombination and a potential for appreciable slightly deleterious
mutation rates could be driven to extinction by Muller's
ratchet [3]. Such arguments frequently overlook the fact
that the particular combination of parameters in that species might not be expected to lead to extinction within the
known time of its existence, even if Muller's ratchet is
clearly operating [1,3,7]. Thus statements about the evolutionary short lives of asexuals are often less quantitative
than would be desirable [1]. In other words there may not
be a genomic decay paradox that calls for any special solutions [7]. We advocate the use of a simple model for predicting extinction times caused by Muller's ratchet in
order to make current discussions about ancient asexuals
more quantitative [1,7], even if that model cannot capture
the full complexity of our study species and therefore only
leads to tentative predictions. We believe that small steps
in model development will allow future models to benefit
from the experiences with simpler models. Hence our use
of a simple model of Muller's ratchet that ignores all complications like potential Red Queen dynamics that might
accelerate the rate of Muller's ratchet (see discussion
below and [6]). We focus on testing the null hypothesis
that Muller's ratchet could not have led to extinction in a
given time frame, as described by Loewe [7]. While this is
an important advance over the purely verbal stage, we
want to encourage future work to model the various processes that increase or decrease the predicted speed of
genomic decay. We also want to encourage more empirical work to establish the precise values of parameters in
these models. Such work is needed for other asexual species as well.
The Amazon molly and Muller's ratchet
The fish Poecilia formosa was the first unisexual vertebrate
that was discovered [10]. This all-female species resulted
from hybridization between relatives of Poecilia mexicana
and Poecilia latipinna [11,12] that probably happened
between 40,000 and 100,000 years ago (see section 'Age
...' below and [11,12]). Reproduction normally occurs by
sperm-dependent parthenogenesis, i.e. diploid eggs are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

produced, which need to be activated for embryonic
development by sperm of closely related species. It has
been argued that paternal leakage, leading to the expression of paternal genes, plays a pivotal role to stop Muller's
ratchet [13] that otherwise would have driven the species
to extinction in less time than its current estimates of existence [11]. Paternal leakage and other processes that may
slow down genomic decay are discussed below. We want
to determine if these processes are necessary to explain the
survival of this fish into our times.
Habitat and population structure
The Amazon molly is a small fish (3 – 7 cm) that lives in
a rather limited range from the Nueces River in south-east
Texas southward to the mouth of the Rio Tuxpan, north of
the Sierra del Abra in Mexico. All these river systems flow
from west to east and have no connection other than the
sea. The population on such a large scale may have some
structure, as populations from south Texas, for example,
have no reasonable connection with those in the Río
Purificación. However, as the Amazon molly tolerates
marine conditions [14], migration cannot be entirely
excluded. A study of FST in subpopulations that span a distance of about 100 km in the same river system did not
find significant population subdivision [15]. Some simple
models of population subdivision do not affect the effective population size Ne and probabilities of the fixation
[such as some island models [16,17]]. However, more
realistic models of population structure that allow for
extinctions and recolonizations can have a substantial
impact on deleterious mutation accumulation [18,19]. To
simplify our theoretical treatment, we will assume that the
whole species has no substructure that is not already
accounted for by our assumed Ne.
Genetics
The Amazon molly reproduces gynogenetically, i.e. its
eggs contain an unreduced set of chromosomes, that need
the sperm of one of the sister species Poecilia mexicana or
Poecilia latipinna as a mechanical trigger to start development [20-22]. Usually, only the diploid set of maternal
genes is expressed and the paternal genome is expelled.
However, occasionally, the paternal genome remains, giving rise to a triploid clone, that reproduces as a triploid
gynogen [15,23]. In other cases, only traces of the paternal
genome (so-called micro-chromosomes) escape the enzymatic machinery that clears the egg from the nucleus that
arrived with the sperm [24]. In all cases, the full diploid or
triploid set of chromosomes (with or without micro-chromosomes [24,25]) is clonally passed on to offspring,
without an obvious opportunity for recombination [26].
Based on this lack of recombination it was hypothesized
that Muller's ratchet should have driven the Amazon
molly to extinction within the presumed time of its exist-

ence, unless processes like paternal leakage would stop
genomic decay [13].
Aims
Here we aim to quantify the verbally predicted effects of
Muller's ratchet in order to see, whether there really is a
genomic decay paradox as defined by Loewe [7] that calls
for an explanation. Results show that indeed a range of
realistic parameter combinations should have led to the
extinction of Amazon molly within the time of its presumed existence.

Results
We quantified the rate of mutation accumulation due to
Muller's ratchet using the best available analytical approximations [9,27,28] and globally distributed individualbased simulations run by Simulator005r6 of evolution@home [7,29-31] assuming our estimates of the most
realistic parameter combinations. To this end we used the
standard null model of Muller's ratchet described elsewhere [7] and extended it to accommodate the slowdown
in fitness decay that can be caused by polyploidy and
mitotic recombination. We employ the U-shaped plot of
extinction times against selection coefficients to allow
easy visualization of situations that lead to a genomic
decay paradox. The frequency of these situations can be
measured by specifying the range of critical selection coefficients sc that are defined by the prediction of corresponding extinction times that are below Tage, the presumed age
of asexuality in an evolutionary line. For more detailed
explanations of this plot see Loewe [7].
The results show that values for Usdm, the slightly deleterious mutation rate, that are above Usdm ≈ 0.1, lead to the
extinction of the Amazon molly within the estimated Tage
= 81,000 years of its existence, even if lower and upper
limits for Tage are considered (see Figure 1 and Tage estimates below). This is also true for our best estimate of
Usdm in the unlikely case of extremely high levels of mitotic
recombination (then Usdm is scaled to 0.2 deleterious
mutations with critical effects/diploid genome/generation). These findings are rather independent of the effective population size Ne, as even Ne = 107 (certainly larger
than the true Ne of the Amazon molly) will not help
against Muller's ratchet if mutation rates are too high.
A deleterious mutation rate of about Usdm ≈ 0.05 per generation results in extinction times that border with upper
limits of estimates of the age of the Amazon molly of 105
years. At this mutation rate some values of Ne, Rmax and
Tgen permit persistence and others cause extinction within
this timeframe, where Rmax is the maximal reproductive
capacity of the non-degenerated ancestors and Tgen is the
generation time. The variability due to Ne, Rmax and Tgen is
indicated for Usdm = 0.05 by the dashed black lines in Fig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

ure 1. These factors lead to similar variability of extinction
times for other mutation rates. If the deleterious genomic
mutation rate were only 0.01, then extinction due to
Muller's ratchet in the known age of the P. formosa lineage
could be excluded, even with the current uncertainty in
other parameters.
If deleterious mutation rates are greater than our best estimate of Usdm ≈ 0.4, then Muller's ratchet will cause extinction of the Amazon molly in a few thousand years from
the origin of asexuality under the standard model in the
absence of mitigating forces. Such high mutation rates
seem to be supported by our best approximation of the
genetic architecture in the Amazon molly (many approximately codominant mutations of small effects in a
genome with very low levels of mitotic recombination
lead to an effective doubling of Usdm as shown in the
Equal-Contribution-Model in Table 1 and discussed in
the Models section below).
Following Loewe [7], the threat of extinction from
Muller's ratchet in Amazon molly can be quantified in
detail as follows:
Usdm = 0.5 (and a mean of all other values) yields a minimal extinction time, Tex, of Tex ≈ 5 Kyr due to most critical
selection coefficients, scm, in the range from scm ≈ 0.005 to
0.05. A genomic decay paradox for this mutation rate
exists at Tage = 100 Kyr in the range of critical selection
coefficients sc ≈ 0.0002 to 0.06.
Usdm = 0.1 (and a mean of all other values) yields a minimal extinction time of Tex ≈ 50 Kyr due to most critical
selection coefficients in the range from scm ≈ 0.005 to 0.01.
A genomic decay paradox for this mutation rate exists at
Tage = 100 Kyr in the range of critical selection coefficients
sc ≈ 0.001 to 0.01.
Lower mutation rates under the same conditions lead to
minimal extinction times that are longer than the
assumed age of the line (Usdm = 0.05 leads to extinction in
Tex ≈ 200 Kyr at scm ≈ 0.005 and Usdm = 0.01 to Tex ≈ 3 Myr
at scm ≈ 0.001). See the coloured lines in Figure 1 for a visual overview.
If mutation rates are increased beyond the natural levels
that we estimated (e.g. by mutagenic pollution), then the
most damaging mutational effects are all in the range of
several percent or more and resulting minimal extinction
times can be surprisingly short. For example, Usdm = 1 can
lead to extinction times of about 300 years by accumulating deleterious mutational effects of s ≈ 10%. If mutagenic
pollution leads to a further 10-fold increase of Usdm, then
extinction times are expected to be less than 30 years, as

Predicted extinction times of the Amazon molly
Predicted extinction times of the Amazon molly. Muller's ratchet might cause extinctions of the unisexual Amazon
molly due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations. (A) analytical results only, (B) analytical results and simulations
combined. The upper bar denotes the assumed age of the line (70 Ky, min 40 Ky, max 100 Ky). The lower bar marks the border to neutrality for the effective population sizes (Ne) used by spanning the selection coefficients from Nes = 1 for the largest
(107 females) to the smallest conceivable Ne (104 females). The lines represent the analytic predictions of the extinction time for
different deleterious genomic mutation rates (Usdm) with Ne = 316,000, generation time Tgen = 1 year and maximal reproductive
capacity Rmax = 500 offspring/generation. Our current best overall estimate for Usdm is 0.4 critically deleterious mutations/diploid genome/generation. Our upper limit is close to Usdm = 1. The dashed lines indicate the variability of the extinction time
estimates for a value that is close to our lowest credible mutation rate estimate (Usdm = 0.05, green diamantes) using the corresponding upper and lower limits of Ne, Tgen and Rmax; variability in extinction time is similar for other Usdm. Large symbols
denote valid extinction time estimates from simulations with at least 2 observed clicks of Muller's ratchet (usually many more,
up to 500). Small symbols denote lower limits for extinction times from simulations without observed clicks, based on the
(usually wrong) assumption that the ratchet would have clicked just after stopping the simulation. Each symbol denotes an
independent simulation with a different random seed and assumes the same mean Tgen and Rmax as analytic predictions (different
Ne have been plotted on top of each other to avoid a series of similar plots). This plot contains 24,251 simulations with a total
of 14.78 years of computing time. See main text for a discussion of parameter combinations and Loewe [7] for an in-depth
explanation of the U-shaped plot shown here. The location of the wall of background selection for a particular parameter combination is approximately given by the vertical part of the corresponding line: all mutations with effects larger than the location of
this wall are removed deterministically.

The table gives the variables in the exponent of N 0 = N e ⋅ e −U sdm s , where N0 is the number of individuals in the population that are in the 'best

using predictions for Muller's ratchet in a haploid asexual genome and applying the scaling given here. Usdm = slightly deleterious mutation rate/
haploid genome, s = homozygous selection coefficient, h = dominance coefficient, sh = heterozygous selection coefficient, where in this table
positive s denote harmful mutations. The two stages for asexual diploids denote the fixation of the first and second deleterious mutation that can
occur at a diploid locus. For individual stages, arrows indicate the change of Usdm/s with increasing mutation accumulation (= MA). '<' or '>' indicate
that mutation rates will remain below or above the indicated level, respectably.

increasingly harmful mutations start to accumulate as
well (extrapolation from Figure 1).

Discussion
This is the first detailed assessment of the threat of extinction from deleterious mutation accumulation through
Muller's ratchet in the Amazon molly. Combining our
best estimates of the haploid deleterious mutation rate
(Usdm ≈ 0.2) with our best approximation of the genetic
architecture in the Amazon molly (many approximately
codominant mutations of small effects in a genome with
very low levels of mitotic recombination) leads to an
effective deleterious mutation rate of Usdm ≈ 0.4 mutations
with critical effects/diploid genome/generation. In the
absence of significant mitigating forces this would cause
extinction of the Amazon molly in a few thousand years.
More precise results can be taken from Figure 1 if needed.
This represents a big step forward for understanding the
asexuality in the Amazon molly, since never before have
the times to extinction been quantified in such detail for
this fish.

Genomic decay paradox
Combining predicted extinction times with current estimates of the age of asexuality in the Amazon molly leads
to a genomic decay paradox, as defined by Loewe [7].
Thus mechanisms that extend our standard model of
Muller's ratchet are needed to explain why this fish has
thus far escaped extinction. Such mechanisms are not
needed if either our most plausible mutation rate estimates are too high or the Amazon molly is younger than
current age estimates suggest (effective Usdm = 0.04 – 0.9;
Tage = 40,000 – 100,000 years, see section 'Age...' below
and [11,12]). As current evidence seems hardly compatible with such low mutation rates or such a young age of P.
formosa, the quest for mechanisms that help this fish
escape genomic decay seems to be valid. This is corroborated by our observation of a fitness correlate, the number
of embryos found in females, which does not show significant differences between P. formosa and P. mexicana (one
of its parental species, see section on life history below).
While we have no such information for other correlates
such as longevity, number of broods per life, offspring survival, etc., our current limited evidence suggests that P. formosa experiences only little or no genomic decay despite

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

our predictions of substantial deleterious mutation accumulation. Below we will discuss processes that might be
of special importance for maintaining fitness in the Amazon molly.
Mitotic recombination
Some reports of apomixis in the Amazon molly suggest a
little debated potential solution to the mystery of its longterm survival. Rasch et al. [26] reported low, but consistent, levels of tissue graft rejections after prolonged periods
(up to one year) within certain sibships, suggesting that
not all inheritance is strictly isogenic in the Amazon
molly. In the absence of a meiotic prophase these observations have been interpreted as the result of either a
mutation rate that exceeds expectations or as the result of
somatic cell crossing-over [26,32]. This process is also
known as mitotic recombination and is most likely an
inevitable result of the way that cells organize mitosis. It
was first discovered in Drosophila [33,34] and has been
intensively studied in yeast [35-37], mice [38], humans
[39] and Daphnia [40]. The frequency of mitotic recombination in some fungi was found to be between 102 and
104 times less than that of meiotic recombination [41]
and recent experiments in yeast reported a factor of ≈
25,000 [37]. Estimates suggest that about 10 sister chromatid exchanges per cellcycle can occur in mammalian
cells [42]. Such evidence suggests that the Amazon molly
experiences mitotic recombination, even if the effective
rate of segregation of different mutations is probably
much lower than in selfers with meiotic recombination.
The fact that asexual Daphnia have been shown to experience mitotic recombination [40] means that the Amazon
molly would not be the only asexual to experience mitotic
recombination.

If this is true, the resulting segregation might slow down
Muller's ratchet for some selection coefficients [43-45],
compared to expectations from the Equal-ContributionsModel described below. However, the fact that the distribution of mutational effects is expected to be very wide on
a log scale [46,47] means that corresponding smaller
selection coefficients will continue to drive Muller's
ratchet. Thus it is difficult to see how mitotic recombination could stop the ratchet on its own without the contribution of other processes. We can use a simple model to
put an upper limit on the maximal potential of mitotic
recombination to stop Muller's ratchet. Mitotic recombination cannot possibly do more to stop fitness decay than
in the case of completely free mitotic recombination. This
allows for mutations to segregate at a maximal rate and
has been used to model Muller's ratchet in selfers [45]. As
shown below (see section on Muller's ratchet with selfing), a simple scaling of mutation rate and selection coefficient is enough to extend the standard model of Muller's
ratchet to this case. Applying such a scaling to our results

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

does not remove the genomic decay paradox that we find
(see Table 1; it is questionable whether mitotic recombination will have a large effect, since the rates of mitotic
recombination are probably far from free recombination). Similarly an analysis of the various levels of dominance that are possible for diploids and triploids as shown
in Table 1 does not remove the paradox. Thus we will have
to search for other solutions.
Rare recombination events during oogenesis in the Amazon molly are not conceptually different from mitotic
recombination in the germ line or selfing. To limit the
largest possible contribution of these processes towards
stopping genomic decay we assume the most generous
form of selfing, which is free recombination between both
diploid copies. As our analysis above shows, the largest
possible amount of recombination during oogenesis cannot stop Muller's ratchet – if no fresh genes are introduced
by outcrossing of some sort.
Paternal leakage
Occasional paternal leakage of fresh genetic material from
sexual sister species could serve as a template for DNA
repair [48] or restore genes that had been destroyed by
Muller's ratchet [13,49]. Paternal leakage has been demonstrated to lead to the expression of paternal genes
[13,50], suggesting a compensatory role in the Amazon
molly [13]. There are two mechanistic scenarios that may
facilitate this.

(i) Micro-chromosomes with a size of about 1% of the
genome have been observed to leak from a sexual sister
species to the Amazon molly [13,24]. If they carry an occasional random sample of genes from the non-degraded
sexual genome into the degrading Amazon molly population, then the possibility exists that they might restore an
ancient, non-degraded state of fitness. This could slow
down Muller's ratchet enough to solve the genomic decay
paradox [13,25]. Micro-chromosomes have been demonstrated to be stably inherited over many generations
[25,51].
(ii) The finding of triploid clones might encourage the
speculation that the third genome copy that is contributed
by the sexual sister species might help restore fitness [49].
One might speculate that triploids should produce more
offspring or survive better and ultimately substitute the
diploid individuals. However, observations suggest the
contrary, as triploids are rather limited in their range,
young, and much less frequently produced than in other
asexuals [15,23]. An alternative possibility is that triploids
might occasionally lose one of their three genome copies
and give rise to secondary diploids that can carry presumably fitter genes from their sexual sister species. If such a
gene flow exists from the sexual sister species over pater-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

nal leakage and an intermediate triploid stage to a final
diploid stage, then such a flow might contribute towards
solving a genomic decay paradox [49]. However, there is
no evidence for such a directed gene flow and triploids are
produced much rarer in the Amazon molly than in other
asexuals or than micro-chromosomes in P. formosa [23].
In any case, paternal leakage should not be confused with
true recombination, which has stimulated discussions
about the ratchet stopping potential of paternal leakage
[52,53]. It has also been speculated that the paternal
genome might be used as a template for DNA repair, but
its precise role remains unclear [48].
Other processes
There is a long list of other potential solutions for the
genomic decay paradox that has been given elsewhere [7]
and thus shall not be discussed in detail here. This list
includes the unlikely possibility that the true deleterious
mutation rate might be much lower, either because mutation rates in the Amazon molly happen to be generally
much lower for yet unknown reasons, or because the distribution of mutational effects happens to be strongly
bimodal with almost no mutations in the critical intermediate range. These hypotheses are not well supported by
comparative analyses of mutation rates and effects in different species (see Parameter Estimates below). Synergistic epistatic effects have also been argued to have the
capacity to stop genomic decay [54,55], but this is only
true in combination with very specific distributions of
mutational effects. If these distributions are reasonably
wide, the potential for epistatic effects to decelerate
Muller's ratchet is virtually non-existent [56].

We have also ignored advantageous and compensatory
mutations, which have a substantial potential to stop
genomic decay completely, if they are frequent enough
[57-59]. Recent work has suggested that a substantial fraction of all mutations is advantageous [47,60]. If the
underlying patterns are not caused by other processes and
the selection coefficients of the corresponding mutations
are large enough, then advantageous mutations can stop
Muller's ratchet. Recent work in viruses has suggested that
the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations can
increase as the mean fitness decreases [61]. If similar
dynamics hold for fish then Muller's ratchet may operate
much slower, if at all. A more detailed discussion of back
mutations and compensatory mutations can be found
elsewhere ([7] and references therein).
To increase the precision of extinction time estimates it
would be desirable to have more direct empirical estimates of mutation rates and effects in the Amazon molly.
Such more precise estimates are needed when specific
potential solutions for this genomic decay paradox are to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

be tested. The evidence presented here makes it seem
unlikely that such added information will change our
main conclusion that a genomic decay paradox exists for
the current age estimates. For more details and additional
potential solutions, please see [7].
Red Queen
It is possible that Muller's ratchet is not the only process
that leads to genomic decay and that the speed of Muller's
ratchet may be significantly increased by other processes.
The Amazon molly and its closely related sister species are
known to harbor parasites [62,63]. These parasites probably decrease the fitness of their host substantially in the
wild and co-evolve with it in an evolutionary arms race for
survival. This scenario is described by the Red Queen
hypothesis [3,5,64,65] and may in itself lead to the extinction of a species. A Red Queen scenario can also be caused
by antagonistic co-evolution in general, which may occur
in many circumstances, including evolving predator-prey
or plant-herbivore relationships or intra-specific co-evolution. It is also known that the speed of mutation accumulation caused by Muller's ratchet is enhanced in a
population that experiences Red Queen dynamics [6,66].
Empirical support for a prerequisite of the Red Queen
hypothesis could be found in another member of the family Poeciliidae to which the Amazon molly belongs [67].
Thus the Amazon molly might participate in such an arms
race, however we currently do not know the range of biologically realistic parameter combinations that are needed
to quantify Red Queen dynamics here. The Red Queen
Hypothesis predicts an increased load from parasites in
asexuals, because they cannot adapt as fast as sexuals to
newly evolving parasites. Based on this prediction one
might not expect substantial Red Queen dynamics in the
Amazon molly, since it seems to have about as many parasites as its sexual sister species [68]. Another attempt to
discover Red Queen dynamics in the Amazon molly was
also negative [69,70]. If the Amazon Molly is forced to
constantly evolve as under Red Queen dynamics, then the
genomic decay paradox might be more extreme.
Implications for the origin of the Amazon molly
Many attempts to produce fertile asexual hybrids in the
laboratory have been unsuccessful [71-73], but under natural conditions such hybridization attempts between the
sympatric parental species of the Amazon molly, P. mexicana and P. latipinna, might happen occasionally. If such
hybridization events occurred regularly, they could have
led to a stable existence of the Amazon molly form, even
though all individual hybrids are on their way to extinction as they will soon be replaced by fresh hybrids. In this
case we expect multiple different young hybrid lines in
random samples from the overall population of the Amazon molly, as each lineage of hybrids will be closer to its
parental species than to other independent hybrids. The

Page 7 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

corresponding phylogenetic tree is expected to be
polyphyletic.
Such a scenario is not supported by existing mtDNA data
[12,72]. Amazon molly individuals sampled from a wide
range of locations show a paraphyletic tree that is compatible with a single hybridization event in the distant past.
This is based on the observation that Amazon molly
mtDNA sequences cluster either with each other or with
exactly the same ancestral sequence from the parental species [12]. If all sequences sampled in the future follow the
same pattern, this rules out polyphyly and casts serious
doubts over the hypothesis of multiple hybridizations in
the past [12]. Combining this with the difficulties to produce asexual hybrids in the lab [71-73] suggests that the
Amazon molly probably comes from a singularly rare
hybridization success. This is in marked difference to
some other species, where asexual hybrids are much easier
to obtain [73]. Thus our quantification of Muller's ratchet
only applies to the descendents of this one clone that
appears to have an age of about 80 Ky.
We cannot distinguish whether the Amazon molly originated by a single ancient hybridization event or whether
there was a small series of such events involving very similar parental individuals in the distant past. This is of no
importance for our conclusions, as the subsequent course
of mutation accumulation is not expected to be different
from that in a population that goes back to a single
hybridization event.
In order for other hybridization events to affect our conclusions, there would have to be a repeated production of
fresh clones that could then constantly replace the decaying genomes in the population. This is expected to show
in phylogenetic analyses. Current analyses show the
absence of polyphyly and indicate that there is no ongoing hybridization in the wild [12,72]. Thus our analysis is
appropriate for the time that came after the population
was cut off from geneflow. This is the time Tagethat we estimate as the time that Muller's ratchet had for degrading
the Amazon molly. In the case that future work uncovers
multiple hybridization events, our analysis is valid for the
lifespan of each clone, assuming no additional factors like
interclonal competition that is independent of Muller's
ratchet.
As current genetic data cannot infer what happened before
the origin of our current lineage of the Amazon molly, this
lineage might well be only the last unisexual Amazon
molly that did not yet go extinct, with many others preceding it. As we know nothing about potential previous
clones our ability to test the so-called "Frozen-Niche-Variation model" [73,74] is rather limited in this case.

Conservation genetics
Since extinction time is very sensitive to changes in the
mutation rate, it is conceivable that the anthropogenic
release of mutagenic substances could lead to such a
strong increase in mutation rate that extinction times are
predicted to be in time frames that are frequently considered by conservation biologists. One of us (DKL) could
actually observe a typical Poeciliid habitat that had lost
almost all vertebrate life due to apparent water pollution
(Altamira, Tamaulipas, Mexico, 2002). Although we have
no evidence to decide whether this incident was mutagenic or not, pollution in general often has mutagenic side
effects. This suggests the possibility of considerable pollution at least of parts of the habitat of the Amazon molly
and would not be the first instance where pollution in rivers leads to a several-fold increase of mutation rates (see
observations in ferns [75-78]).
Quantifying Muller's ratchet in other ancient asexuals is
easier now
It is well known that asexual lineages are typically shortlived. While this observation is central to theories about
the origin of sex, it still needs to be properly quantified
[1]. The evolution@home results used in this work make
it manageable to quantify the threat from Muller's ratchet
for the long list of other putatively ancient asexuals that
have been suspected of being threatened by genomic
decay [1,4,79,80], including the Amazon molly's close relative Poeciliopsis [74,81]. We suspect that it might not be
possible to explain the existence of all these asexuals by
the surprising discovery of a recent ancestor with a very
young age as in the case of the clonal, hybrid, gynogenetic
mole salamander Ambystoma [82-84]. Even if that were
the case, then it would still be interesting to quantify
Muller's ratchet, as this would shed more light on how fast
it actually clicks in clonal lineages, where some evidence
is consistent with its operation [85-89]. Examples of
ancient asexuals that could benefit from a more rigorous
quantification of the effects of Muller's ratchet include:

(i) Darwinula stevensoni, a small non-marine ostracod.
Darwinulidae are believed to have lived for about 200 Myr
without sex as the fossil record shows only females [80] –
but see Smith et al. [90]. The species Darwinula stevensoni
is a member of this group and is thought to exist for more
than 20 Myr now [80,91,92].
(ii) Bdelloid rotifers. The Class Bdelloidea of the Phylum
Rotifera is the largest taxonomic group that has apparently
lived completely without sex for at least 40 Myr [93-95].
The ancient asexuality of these 0.1 to 1 mm long animals
appears to be as well established as it can possibly be. Various special features of this group have been discussed as
the reason behind its long-term survival [96-99].

(iii) Oribatid mites. Parthenogenetic automicts are frequent among oribatid mites [100,101]. Current estimates
suggest that some lines have lived parthenogenetically for
perhaps 100 Myr and that their extant distribution was
strongly affected by continental drift [102].
Practical aspects
To quantify the possibilities of extinction from Muller's
ratchet in a given asexual system using the evolution@home results database, please contact one of us
(LL). You will receive help in completing a survey of various details about your study system (see online questionnaire [103]) and if enough data is available, a preliminary
report will be produced (including plots similar to Figure
1). If necessary, the existing evolution@home infrastructure can be used to compute new parameter combinations. Our experience shows that the prediction of
extinction times in ancient asexuals can often be simplified by using rough upper and lower limits for important
parameters. For some parameters the lack of precision will
not be critical, where as for others it will help focus further
empirical work towards parameter estimation.
Why quantify the ratchet as often as possible?
There are many open questions that can be asked about
the general accuracy of the simple standard model of
Muller's ratchet used for the quantifications presented
here [7]. We believe that the following reasons justify a
series of analyses of extinction times in various asexuals
based on our null-model. We expect such work to contribute towards a mature, quantitative discussion about the
evolutionary biology of asexuals.

(i) Critical predictions of extinction time help biologists
to look for the key data that is also needed for more realistic quantifications of the effects of mutation accumulation. Therefore such predictions help in the design of
empirical work.
(ii) It can be expected that at least some of the putative
ancient asexuals are not examples of the genomic decay
paradox, because the known age of their asexuality is
smaller than their predicted extinction time. This does not
deny the age of their asexuality, it just takes the 'scandal'
out of the observations [4].
(iii) Those species with an apparent genomic decay paradox can be subject to a more detailed search for mechanisms that solve the paradox and help them to avoid
extinction [7].
(iv) Experiences with the present simple system for predicting extinction times can be expected to lead to the
development of more realistic systems for the quantification of genomic decay paradoxes. Such improved systems

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

might include the processes discussed here and might
measure their mitigating effects on mutation accumulation.

Conclusion
A genomic decay paradox is predicted by a large number
of biologically realistic parameter combinations for the
unisexual Amazon molly. This is based on a simple model
of Muller's ratchet that accounts for the distribution of
mutational effects on fitness, the availability of multiple
copies of the genome and mitotic recombination. Our
prediction of a genomic decay paradox strengthens the
conclusions of earlier work that suggested the existence of
additional biological processes that slow down or halt the
mutational decay of fitness in this fish. This conclusion is
consistent with our observation that the Amazon molly
carries approximately the same number of embryos per
adult as its sexual sister species. Future work will have to
establish whether paternal leakage of micro-chromosomes or still other processes have helped the Amazon
molly to survive until today. If these mitigating processes
are weak enough, an increase of mutagenic substances in
the environment could easily lead to a rate of mutation
accumulation that might allow extinction within time
frames that are frequently of interest to conservation biologists.

Methods
Standard null model
To test the hypothesis that Muller's ratchet does not
threaten the Amazon molly with extinction during the
known time of its existence, we used the null model for
quantifying the threat of extinction from Muller's ratchet,
as described elsewhere in detail [7]. This model is a simple
extension of the standard model of Haigh [104] combined with mutational meltdowns [105]. In short, we
combined a multiplicative fitness model with an upper
limit for Rmax, the maximal effective number of offspring
that can be produced by an individual. This allows computing Cmm, the number of clicks of Muller's ratchet that
are needed to start mutational meltdown

Cmm = log(1/Rmax)/log(1 - s),

(1)

where each click is the stochastic extinction of the genotype carrying the fewest deleterious mutations that have
the constant positive selection coefficient s [see [7,105]].
While this extinction does not require the fixation of a
new mutation in the population, such a fixation typically
follows shortly after the loss of the best class [106,107],
unless there are special circumstances. Combining the
effective population size Ne with Usdm, the genomic rate of
the origin of slightly deleterious mutations with effect s,
allows us to compute Tcl, the average effective time
between two clicks of Muller's ratchet in generations that

Page 9 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

are assumed to be discrete. Since computation of this click
time is rather difficult, we combine two of the best analytical approximations [9,27,28] with extensive individualbased computer simulations that were distributed over
the Internet using evolution@home, the first global computing system for evolutionary biology [7,29-31]. We do
not quantify mutational meltdown, because this demographic process at the end of genomic decay is so fast that
it can be neglected. Therefore, we approximate Tex, the
time to extinction by
Tex = Cmm * Tcl * Tgen

(iii) One might want to ignore chromosome rearrangements and frame-shift mutations like indels or TE insertions, if one wants to obtain a conservative estimate of
extinction time. Many of these mutations are so strongly
selected against that they have no chance of accumulating
in a large population (their selection coefficients are
firmly behind the 'wall of background selection', see Figure 1 and [7]). Thus, such drastic mutations are probably
only of importance in the context of corrections for polyploidy that were discussed above and if mutation rates are
already very high.

(2)

where Tgen is the time between generations that are
assumed to be discrete [7]. Extinction times are computed
for a large number of parameter combinations that span
the whole realistic range of parameters, to assess how
many parameter combinations could lead to an extinction
by Tage, the known age of existence of the asexual lines of
descent. Our simplifying assumption here is that no significant mutation accumulation had occurred in the sexual ancestors, since regular recombination would have
facilitated the selective removal of all slightly deleterious
mutations of critical effects (i.e. effects that could endanger the long-term survival of the Amazon molly in the
presence of Muller's ratchet). To account for the distribution of mutational effects we scale the total genomic
mutation rate appropriately to obtain Usdm [7] and we estimate Ne from diversity data [108]. This approach is justified in the corresponding sections below.
Mutation rate estimates
Before we can estimate Usdm, we need to estimate Utot, the
mutation rate at all potentially deleterious sites in a haploid genome per generation. To do this we focus on synonymous point mutations for estimating the rate per base
pair and later extrapolate to potentially harmful sites that
change amino acids or affect regulatory functions. We
focus on synonymous point mutations for several reasons.

(i) Synonymous mutations are expected to be mostly
effectively neutral (or only under weak selection) and
therefore their rate of fixation can be predicted from the
neutral theory [109] (the rate is slightly lower if there is
very weak selection). Thus synonymous substitution rates
are probably very close to the true mutation rates of neighbouring non-synonymous sites that accumulate the actual
mutational damage.
(ii) We cannot apply observations from microsatellites,
since their mutational model is very different from that of
normal point mutations and it is not clear, how an estimate of one rate could be converted to a direct estimate of
the other rate.

In addition to mutation rates in the nuclear genome, one
might want to consider mutation rates in the mitochondrial genome, since mitochondria are probably as essential to fish as they are to humans [7].
Distribution of mutational effects
To quantify Muller's ratchet in the presence of a distribution of mutational effects on fitness we partition this distribution in three as suggested elsewhere [7,108]:

(i) Very deleterious mutations are implicitly dealt with by
our method of determining Ne, see below.
(ii) Slightly deleterious mutations with effects in the critical range or close to the critical range are the main focus
of our attention here, as these contribute most to extinction, see below.
(iii) Effectively neutral mutations that accumulate like
neutral mutations are ignored, as their effects are too
small for impacting fitness.
In order to quantify Muller's ratchet we need a good estimate of Usdm, the slightly deleterious mutation rate, which
is given by
Usdm = Utot * fsdm,

(8)

where Utot is the genomic mutation rate at sites that are in
a functional category with potentially deleterious effects
like non-synonymous mutations, and fsdm is the fraction of
sites with slightly deleterious, critical selection coefficients
sc among all potentially deleterious mutations (for more
details on this approach, see [7]). The corresponding
range of critical selection coefficients approximates all s
that lead to extinction within a minimal time or within a
given time Tage; this can be determined from Figure 1. To
compute fsdm we need to combine the range of all sc with
estimates of the distribution of mutational effects on fitness, which traditionally have been difficult to obtain.
However recent progress has been substantial and we now
know that the distribution of non-synonymous muta-

tional effects is very leptokurtic and spans many orders of
magnitude in many different species [46,47,110-112].
Effective population size
There are three population sizes that are potentially relevant here:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

(i) Neutral sites are important for estimating Ne = Neb
under background selection, but not for the ratchet itself
(ignore when computing Usdm).
(ii) Selected sites contribute towards operating the ratchet
(use for computing Usdm), but cannot be used to estimate
Ne.

(i) total census population size Nt,
(ii) effective population size in the absence of any deleterious mutations Ne0,
(iii) effective population size in the presence of background selection Neb.
Here we argue that Ne = Neb for the purposes of quantifying the rate of Muller's ratchet; this is how we use Ne outside of this section. In order to see this, we need to
consider how to approximate the rate of Muller's ratchet
in the presence of a wide distribution of mutational
effects. New work by Söderberg & Berg [108] has shown
that the rate of the ratchet in the presence of such a distribution can be approximated reasonably by dividing
mutational effects into different categories (see above).
Here we consider the category that contains mutations
with very strong effects (see background selection theory
[113,114]). Simulations [108] show that the effect of
these mutations on the rate of the ratchet is well approximated by using a scaled effective population size Ne0 that
is appropriately reduced by the factor Neb/Ne0 so that it
only contains individuals that are free from strongly deleterious mutations (see equation 7 in [108]). This is consistent with classical Hill-Robertson effect theory, which
states that a locus that is linked to another locus under
selection will experience a reduction in effective population size [109].
In the absence of deleterious mutations, estimates of Ne =
Ne0 can be made from diversity data and mutation rates,
but we cannot estimate Ne0 in our system, since deleterious mutations are present. Surprisingly, we do not need
such an estimate, since background selection theory predicts that any estimate of Ne based on diversity and mutation rates will in reality be an estimate of Neb, the effective
size of the class that is free from strongly deleterious mutatons [113,114]. This means that two difficulties in our
analysis cancel each other out: we do not need to estimate
Ne0 and we do not need to simulate background selection
for a population of size Ne0 to quantify the rate of the
ratchet for mutations with critical effects. We only need to
use standard approaches for measuring Ne from DNA
sequence diversity; this will approximately give us Neb for
our simulations, which then have to ignore all mutations
with effects in the background selection range [108]. Thus
our analysis uses information from two categories of sites:

Since mtDNA and all nuclear chromosomes are completely linked with the same selective unit in the absence
of outcrossing, Ne is the same for both systems like in pure
selfers [115,116].
Simplifications overview
Here we approximate the effects of Muller's ratchet in a
real diploid genome by proposing to choose (i) effective
deleterious mutation rates that are adjusted for the corresponding ploidy level and exclude mutations with effects
that are either too large to accumulate or too small to
cause effective harm and (ii) effective selection coefficients that are adjusted for arbitrary levels of ploidy, dominance and mitotic recombination. The corresponding
adjustments are compiled in Table 1 and explained
below. Given the large degree of uncertainty about mutation rates and selection coefficients in our study organism,
the errors from these approximations seem insignificant.
Also, it is not possible to convincingly decide between the
"Core-Genome-Model" and the alternative "Equal-Contribution-Model", although the latter seems to be much
more realistic (both models are explained below). Therefore all possible options are explored by including a wide
range of possible mutation rates and effects.
Extensions for diploids and polyploids
To apply the model above to non-haploid organisms
requires some adjustments to account for the fact that
duplicate copies of genes can buffer deleterious effects. To
avoid the complexity associated with recent models of the
evolution of gene duplicates [117-121], we propose two
simple models that allow the reduction of polyploids to
an effectively haploid genome model: (i) The CoreGenome-Model assumes that one functional copy of each
essential gene is sufficient and all other alleles can be discarded without problems, so that fitness degradation from
Muller's ratchet can only start when the 'backup alleles'
have been deactivated. (ii) The Equal-Contribution-Model
assumes that each allelic copy contributes equally to fitness, so that selection coefficients are reduced and mutation rates are increased proportionally to the ploidy level.
Both models are discussed below for diploid and triploid
Amazon molly along with the impact of a variable dominance coefficient h on quantifications of Muller's ratchet.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

Core-Genome-Model
One might assume that only one copy of each important
gene is really needed and that all additional copies from
higher ploidy levels of the genome could be regarded as
'neutral backups' that can be deleted without any negative
effect, as long as the last functional copy is still working.
An extreme interpretation of this assumption implies that
all deleterious mutations are completely recessive (dominance coefficient h = 0), which is rather unrealistic in
many settings [122-130]. However, in less extreme cases,
recessivity may be strong enough to reduce the effects of a
complete gene knockout to effective selective neutrality
(Nesh < 1). Under the Core-Genome-Model otherwise
strongly deleterious mutations like indels or transposable
element insertions can disrupt gene function in all additional copies and thus accumulate effectively like neutral
mutations. Eventually the core genome will be distributed
across all the different haploid copies of the original
genome, as it is really only a combination of all the least
damaged parts of the genome. Since one frame-shifting
mutation is enough to transform a copy of gene i into a
pseudogene, we can approximate its time to inactivation,
Tko, by

Tko ≈ 1/(li * μbp * fko)

(3)

where fko is the factor that specifies the frequency of frameshift or other knock-out mutations relative to μbp, the synonymous point mutation rate/basepair/generation, and li
is the total length of gene i. Lets assume a typical gene has
2,000 base pairs and frame-shifts occur at a rate of μbp * fko
≈ 1*10-9 (probably a lower limit if compared to ≈ 1*10-8
mutations/bp/generation in mice and fko ≈ 1/3 as observed
in bacteria [see the 'C' parameter in [131,132]]). In this
case one may have to wait on average for about 500,000
generations, before inactivation of such a gene can be
expected. Since these events most probably follow a Poisson distribution, it can be expected that a substantial fraction of essential genes would be inactivated very quickly,
leaving only one copy that is then maintained by selection. It is these last copies that are then slowly degraded by
Muller's ratchet, since they can most probably mutate to
such slightly deleterious states that allow the operation of
the ratchet. Early inactivation of enough 'backup copies'
will give Muller's ratchet extensive periods of time for
degrading the core genome (late inactivation may allow
for slightly deleterious point mutations in the non-deactivated allele). For example, the rates above suggest that
frame-shift accumulation in 20,000 diploid genes would
inactivate on average about 1,000 genes (sd = 32) over
25,000 generations. A precise calculation of extinction
time in this model would require the integration of the
effects of increasing mutation accumulation over time,
where the increase is caused by rising deleterious mutation rates due to the progressive inactivation of genes. To

avoid these complex calculations, the following two
extreme simplifications are proposed.
A lower limit of Tex can be obtained by ignoring all additional copies of the essential core genes. In this case the
resulting Usdm to use for the computation of click time is
that of the haploid core copy of the genome. An upper
limit can be obtained by partitioning time into (i) the
accumulation of knockouts while ignoring Muller's
ratchet and (ii) the operation of Muller's ratchet while
neglecting any further increase of mutation rates due to
additional knockouts. Testing several possible ratios of
these two times allows minimization of extinction time
between the extreme of no time for frameshifts (no extinction due to Muller's ratchet, since mutation rates are too
low) and all time for frame-shifts (no extinction, because
Muller's ratchet will always need some time to cause an
extinction, even with high mutation rates).
In the case of triploids or higher ploidy levels, the CoreGenome-Model needs correspondingly longer for
genomic decay, but in no case can additional copies stop
genomic decay. Higher ploidy levels are not discussed
here, since we assume that the first Amazon molly was
diploid. Triploids lose their advantage in the CoreGenome-Model, if they occasionally lose one of their
three sets of chromosomes, as they might do [49]. The fact
that this is possible indicates that the lost set of chromosomes does not carry any last functional copy of a vital
gene. For more details on triploids see the Equal-Contribution-Model.
Equal-Contribution-Model
Diploids
Many mutations of small effects do not seem to be completely recessive, but rather close to codominance, especially if their effects are very small [122-130]. If that is
approximately true for most genes, then both copies in a
diploid genome are actually needed to produce the
required dose of proteins to maintain fitness. In this case,
all copies of the genome of the Amazon molly will contribute approximately the same amount of functionality,
implying that the size of the mutational target increases
two-fold, while effective selection coefficients decrease
two-fold, relative to the haploid case (there are twice as
many sites to hit and selection only operates against heterozygotes with strength sh, where h = 0.5).
Triploids
It is not clear whether such reasoning can be extended to
triploids, as ancestral genomes may have been fine-tuned
for diploidy. The fact that triploids can have significant
disadvantages if compared directly to diploids [133,134]
cautions against a positive functional role of the additional copy of the genome. On the other hand, one could

Page 12 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

argue that the surprising flexibility of fish in tolerating various ploidy levels [133] allows for an easy incorporation
of an additional dosage of proteins provided by a third set
of chromosomes. This is not contradicted by the fact that
Amazon molly triploids can be observed in the wild [23],
as strong purifying selection would predict vanishing frequencies, since the rates of origin of triploids are rather
low in this fish [23]. Existing data on expression patterns
of muscle proteins in Amazon molly triploids are inconclusive [50]. These complications suggest that triploids
may face purifying selection and therefore they are not
likely to reach 100% in a population. Depending on the
specific mechanism of how triploids incur a possible disadvantage, the inactivation of one copy might occasionally even be beneficial for triploids. In addition, triploids
may revert back to diploidy by occasionally losing one of
their three sets of chromosomes [49]. The fraction of triploids in the wild seems to fluctuate substantially, but no
population with 100% triploids has been observed. Frequencies of triploids for two different samples were in the
range of 4%–15% (Lamatsch et al., unpublished) and 3%
– 46% [135], indicating that selection against triploids is
probably weak. Therefore, equal-contribution-corrections
to haploid estimates of Usdm (and s if available) have to be
treated with caution in the case of triploids, but appear to
be reasonable approximations for diploids.
Varying dominance
The two models above assume either complete recessivity
or codominance. Observed dominance levels in other species are frequently somewhere in-between, where mutations with smaller effects tend to be closer to
codominance [122-130]. While we know very little about
the precise values of the dominance coefficient, h, and the
selection coefficient, s, in the Amazon molly, it appears to
be highly probable that general findings from other species apply here too. Of special interest here is the fact that
the distribution of mutational effects on fitness appears to
be very wide on a log scale [46,47]. Thus we can propose
a simplification that allows for arbitrary dominance coefficients between h = 0 and h = 1 by making slight adjustments to the effective s used in simulations. The
simplification is based on the observation that

(i) deleterious mutations with smaller effects have a
higher probability of accumulating in the population
than those with larger effects and
(ii) mutations with large enough effects do not accumulate (see the 'wall of background selection' in Figure 1 and
in [7]).
To simplify the treatment we speak of the ratchet as if it
fixes mutations, although strictly speaking the ratchet will
only cause the mutation-free class to go extinct and fixing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

happens shortly after that by genetic drift (see [106,107]).
The following qualitative analysis is supported by published simulation results [106].
We can treat dominant mutations as follows. If and only if
the ratchet can fix the first mutation at a site (i.e. individuals that are homozygous for that size go extinct and all
individuals in the population become heterozygous) then
it will eventually also fix the second mutation (i.e. all individuals become homozygous for the deleterious allele). If
a heterozygote cannot be fixed, there is no way the
homozygote state can be fixed and the effective mutation
rate used to compute the speed of the ratchet should be
reduced accordingly to exclude such sites.
In the case of recessive deleterious mutations, there are the
two following extremes. If s is small (most mutations),
then click times are hardly affected and almost no correction is necessary. If s is large enough to prevent fixation of
heterozygotes, then again the effective mutation rate may
be reduced, as fixation of the homozygous state is impossible. Only few intermediate s can become heterozygous
but not homozygous, as they have to be close to the
switch-like transition between 'can accumulate' and 'cannot accumulate' (see the 'wall of background selection' in
Figure 1 and [7]) and their homozygous effects have to be
too deleterious to accumulate. This simplification relies
on the almost switch-like transition between mutation
accumulation by Muller's ratchet and complete mutation
removal by background selection.
We ignore overdominant sites, assuming that these stay in
their optimal heterozygous state. This will lead to a conservative estimate of extinction time, as these sites do not
contribute to fitness decay under this assumption. Future
models will have to investigate to what extent such an
approximation is justified in the presence of a small fraction of overdominant sites [129,130].
Extensions for mitotic recombination
Non-meiotic recombination can play a substantial role in
reducing diversity in asexual lineages [40]. To assess the
extent to which the rate of Muller's ratchet could be
reduced by this process [43,44,136], the following
approach was used. We assume that the maximal possible
rate of mitotic recombination is equivalent to selfing with
free recombination between loci. The true reduction of
the rate of Muller's ratchet is probably much smaller, since
mitotic recombination is certainly not as effective as free
recombination in a selfing population. Thus the strongest
possible reduction of the rate of Muller's ratchet from
mitotic recombination can be estimated from the analytical work of Heller and Maynard Smith [45]. As explained
below, a simple scaling of U and s is enough to reduce predictions to the haploid case.

Muller's ratchet with selfing
Heller and Maynard Smith [45] derived an equation that
describes the distribution of deleterious mutations in a
selfing population under Muller's ratchet. We assume here
that the expectation of the size of the 'best class' in mutation-selection balance mainly determines the rate of
Muller's ratchet. This appears to be supported by some
simulation results [43,44] although Gordo & Charlesworth [137] found that the ratchet could click at different
rates for the same size of the best class if other parameters
were different. Our assumption allows us to use a simple
scaling of U and s to reduce predictions for diploid selfers
to the haploid case.

In detail, Heller and Maynard Smith [45] show that in a
selfing population xij, the fraction of individuals carrying
i homozygous and j heterozygous mutations is given by
i

x ij =

⎡ U sdm,d ( 1− sh ) ⎤ 1 ⎡ 2U sdm,d ⎤ j

where Usdm, d is the slightly deleterious mutation rate/diploid genome/generation that changes wildtype homozygotes into heterozygotes, h is the dominance coefficient
and s is the homozygous selection coefficient (positive for
harmful mutations). This equation assumes that (i)
recombination is free between sites, so that the ratchet
only operates at homozygous sites, since selfing can
restore the best class on a heterozygous site, (ii) Usdm, d is
constant and independent from the number of mutations
per individual, (iii) mutations at heterozygous sites are
negligible, since selfing produces many more homozygotes, (iv) the standard model of Muller's ratchet without
back mutations is valid [7,104]. Then the number of individuals in the 'best class', N0, can be computed by adding
up all heterozygotes that are free from homozygous deleterious mutations and then scaling by the effective population size

For complete recessivity (h = 0) this reduces to the haploid

N = N e ⋅ e −U sdm s
asexual case ( 0
), because the diploid
mutation rate Usdm, d equals twice the haploid rate Usdm. It
is easy to see from (7) that the degree of dominance of
mutations with small selection coefficients does not significantly affect numerical values and hence the rate of the
ratchet. Since the ratchet does not click for large s, one
might as well neglect dominance altogether.

Parameter estimates
Effective population size
For our simulations we need an estimate of the effective
population size in the presence of background selection
(Ne = Neb, see above). To arrive at such an estimate we
obtain corresponding diversity data from the control
region of mtDNA, since it is linked to the rest of the
genome by unisexual inheritance (see the Models section
above for a justification of this approach). We use the
DNA sequence diversity data from Möller (see pp. 46, 47
and 55 in [12]), who observed 14 haplotypes with S = 13
sites segregating for single base pair polymorphisms in a
total of n = 63 sequences of length L = 886 bp from 17
geographic locations. Since the control region of mtDNA
is likely to evolve neutrally at most sites, we can use Watterson's [138] equation to compute Ne = S/(L * μbp * a),
where Ne is the effective population size of mitochondrial
DNA in the presence of background selection, μbp is the
mutation rate per site/generation and a = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 +
... + 1/(n-1) for n sequences in the sample. Here we
assume an mtDNA divergence rate of 3.6% ± 0.46%/site/
Myr as estimated in the species groups of the fish Centropomus [139] from divergence since the Panama seaway
closed 3.0–3.5 Myr ago [140]. This suggests a value for Ne
between 153,000 and 198,000 that will have to be scaled
downward, if actual mutation rates are higher, like in
human pedigrees [141]. The nuclear value is identical to
this mtDNA estimate, if there is no outcrossing [115,116].

Comparative analyses suggest that the resulting values are
reasonable. The total population size Nt may be used to
place upper bounds on Ne in most situations. Some mark
and recapture experiments could only estimate that Nt >
10,000 in that local study area (M. Doebler, personal
communication). One may speculate that about 10 million individuals of P. formosa may exist in total. If this is
combined with the typical finding that vertebrates frequently have Ne-values that are about 10% of their census
population sizes [142], then Ne would be about a million.
Given that a species as abundant as the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster has effective population sizes of little more
than a million [143], suggests that the Amazon molly
probably has Ne < 106. On the other extreme it is highly
unlikely that the Amazon molly would have an effective

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

population size smaller than that of primates, suggesting
Ne > 104.
We use deliberately wide upper and lower bounds of Ne =
104 to 107 to demonstrate that population size has a rather
small influence on the operation of Muller's ratchet in the
presence of a distribution of mutational effects.
Life history
Based on observations we estimate that generation time
Tgen is between 4 month (min) and 2.5 years (max), so we
assume 1 year as our middle value. The maximal reproductive capacity in the wild with a non-degraded genome
Rmax is assumed to be 50 (min) 500 (mid) and 2000 (max)
offspring per lifetime (see below). While Tgen scales extinction times linearly, Rmax has a much smaller effect. It is
possible that our values for Rmax are too large since they are
more based on the highest possible values conceivable
under laboratory conditions than on any real life survival
situation. Once such data are available, results from Figure 1 can be easily scaled appropriately (see equation 2).

Unfortunately there is very little information about life
history from natural habitats. Most of the knowledge
about P. formosa comes from extensive aquarium cultures.
In captivity the Amazon molly reaches maturity between
4 and 6 months, produces more offspring at larger body
sizes and may live for up to 3 years under optimal laboratory conditions. Here we report that females caught in the
wild contain a mean of 28 embryos (sd ± 16; n = 20;
observed maximum in the wild = 70 embryos, slightly less
than the maximum of 90 observed in the lab [144]).
Females will probably produce this number of newborn
fish about every 28 days, depending on water temperature. They stop reproduction about 3 to 6 months before
death in the lab. The number of surviving newborn fish
can be reduced considerably by predation or disease. Thus
under good conditions Rmax might be 18 periods * 28 offspring = 504, assuming a life span of 2 years. As a lower
limit one might use 50 offspring per lifetime, assuming
that many offspring die due to predation or disease and
many parents are small and frequently trapped in little
ponds without sister species that provide the sperm that
they need as a trigger for development. An upper limit of
Rmax = 2,030 might be derived from combining the maximal number of offspring-producing periods observed in
the lab (29 = 36-4-3) with the maximal number of
embryos per period observed in the wild (70 in n = 20, the
upper expectation for a fish of this size [10]). We did not
find that the sexual sister species, P. mexicana limantouri
differs significantly from these values (observed mean =
27 embryos ± sd = 13; n = 11).

Age of the evolutionary line
The ancestor of the Amazon molly clone known to us was
formed by a hybridisation event between a Poecilia mexicana female and a Poecilia latipinna male [11,12] and is
believed to have reproduced asexually since then. A date
Tage for this event may be derived from comparing alleles
in the Amazon molly with alleles in their corresponding
parent species using a molecular clock. At the moment
there are two datasets that are large enough to infer an
evolutionary age that is different from zero. Comparisons
of 1,377 bp in various nuclear genes (mostly introns) lead
to a point estimate of Tage = 100,000 years assuming a
divergence rate of 2%/Myr from standard mitochondrial
clocks [11]. This age may be an underestimate, since
nuclear mutation rates are usually much lower than mitochondrial rates. However, the confidence intervals for this
estimate range from Tage = 8,930 to Tage = 209,000 years
due to the small number of substitutions observed
[69,70]. Thus it is desirable to arrive at a more precise estimate. This can be done using the same set of mtDNA
diversity data that was used to estimate Ne above [12].
Analyses of the median joining network show that there is
only one mtDNA haplotype that is shared between P. formosa and P. mexicana and that this haplotype is at the
center of P. formosa diversity (p.49 in [12]). Thus it is reasonable to assume that this haplotype was the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) of all Amazon mollies and
one can use the number of mutational steps back to the
MRCA as an indicator of the time since divergence of
Amazon mollies from their MRCA. Using the method
described by Saillard et al. [145] and the data of Möller
[see p.69 [12]] leads to an estimate of 1.294 (± sd = 0.159)
mutational steps back to the MRCA in the 886 bp of the
control region of mtDNA that were sequenced for this
purpose. If this is combined with the divergence rate of
3.6% ± 0.46%/site/Myr as estimated in the species groups
of the fish Centropomus [139] from divergence since the
Panama seaway closed 3.0–3.5 Myr ago [140], then we
arrive at an estimate of Tage = 81,000 years for the time to
the MRCA of P. formosa (1.294/(886 * 3.6 *10-8/2); lower
and upper limits range from 63,000 to 104,000 years).
This time will have to be scaled downward, if actual mutation rates are higher, as has been found in human pedigrees [141]. Thus we have marked Tage = 40 Kyr, 70 Kyr
and 100 Kyr as estimates of the age of the Amazon molly
in Figure 1. It is easy to check our conclusions, if more precise information becomes available. A more rigorous
analysis involving multiple genes from multiple individuals from each species would be desirable [see [146]].
Mutation rate estimates
The last decades have seen a large increase of our understanding of mutation rates across a wide range of organisms [132,147,148] and we have no reason to assume hat
the Amazon molly might have extraordinarily low muta-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:88

tion rates. Thus it is possible in the absence of more specific data to extrapolate from other species to arrive at a
credible estimate for the Amazon molly specific mutation
rate at all potentially deleterious sites in a haploid genome
per generation, Utot.
The size of a haploid genome is about 950 Mbp, as
derived from DNA content of cells [149]. If this is combined with the mutation rate counterpart of the divergence rate that was used to date the age of Amazon molly
[11], then about 9.5 new mutations per haploid genome
can be expected in each new generation (950 Mbp * 0.01
subst/bp/Myr assuming Tgen = 1 year). Since many of these
mutations will be synonymous or affect only non-functional DNA, we have to scale this rate by the effective
genome size [132]. Fish are presumably more complex
than flies. Therefore, we may use the effective genome size
of Drosophila melanogaster as a lower limit (13,379 genes
with 54,934 exons and a total length of 27.8 Mbp in exons
[150] suggest about 19 Mbp as the target size for non-synonymous, non-frameshifting mutations). This is just 2%
of the actual genome size and has to be increased to about
8% to account for non-coding functional sequences that
seem to be about three times as abundant as functional
sequences in exons in organisms as diverse as fruitflies
and mice [151,152]. This would result in Utot ≈ 0.74
potentially deleterious mutations/haploid genome/generation and may be an underestimate, as the amount of coding DNA in fish might be higher than in Drosophila. If a
similar calculation is based on the 33 Mbp exons that we
can estimate from the Fugu genome project, then Utot ≈
0.88 seems plausible (all genes occupy 108 Mbp and we
estimate that this includes roughly 75 Mbp introns from
Figure 2 in [153]).
These estimates do not change much, even if we use a
completely different way of obtaining the mutation rate.
Observations in mice have lead to estimates of 1.8 × 10-10/
site/cell replication, respectively [132]. If an estimated 88
Mbp functional sites in P. formosa experience about 25
germ line cell divisions per adult generation (as female
mice [132] that have a similar body weight to the Amazon
molly) then we arrive at Utot ≈ 0.4 potentially deleterious
mutations/haploid genome/generation. Obviously, P. formosa is not a mouse and there is much room for improving the precision of such mutation rate estimates, even in
mice. Recent high-precision measurements of the deleterious mutation rate in mutation accumulation experiments
in Drosophila found Utot ≈ 0.6 deleterious mutations/haploid genome/generation [154]. Scaling this estimate by
the relative effective genome size of Fugu suggests Utot ≈
0.7.
It is encouraging to find such general agreement between
these estimates that are based on very different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/88

approaches. This suggests that we can have some confidence in our estimates, even in the absence of direct observations in the Amazon molly. Since mutations are the
inevitable consequence of DNA replication errors and the
number of mitotic cell divisions per generation is a key
determinant of mutation rates per generation [132,155],
we conclude that the absence of recombination in the
Amazon molly is unlikely to cause a major change in
mutation rate when compared to its sexual sister species.
Distribution of mutational effects
Recent progress has shown that the distribution of nonsynonymous mutational effects is very leptokurtic and
spans many orders of magnitude in many different species
[46,47,110-112]. While we have no specific data for the
Amazon molly, we have no reason to believe that this
result does not hold here as well. One can use data on the
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution
rates, KA/KS, to infer that the fraction 1-KA/KS of all mutations must be more deleterious than about s = 1/Ne, since
mutations with effects below that threshold accumulate as
if they were neutral [47,156]. If the data in Drosophila can
be used as a landmark in this new territory, then about
90% of all mutations are more deleterious than the limit
of 1/Ne ≈ 10-6 [112]. Estimates of the distribution of mutational effects in Drosophila have shown that this distribution may well follow a lognormal law and there may be
good theoretical reasons for this [46]. Robust features are
its large width on a logscale and the fact that most probability mass is between effective neutrality and lethality
[46,47]. From this and from Figure 1 we may infer that the
fraction of slightly deleterious mutations, fsdm, could be
perhaps around 30%, probably larger than 10%, but
probably not much larger than 50%. We use these values
as a point estimate with lower and upper bound. Thus
Usdm probably shares the same order of magnitude with
Utot. As this calculation has large errors, an array of other
mutation rates is included as well when quantifying the
ratchet. We assume that selection coefficients did not
change much for most genes in the time since asexuality
arose in the Amazon molly. This is compatible with the
assumption that most genes in the Amazon molly are
generic to similar fish species and thus well adapted, while
only a small fraction is actually responsible for the specific
adaptations of the Amazon molly.
Deleterious mutation rates summary
As discussed above, our best estimate for the total mutation rate at potentially deleterious sites per haploid
genome per generation is expected to be between Utot ≈ 0.4
and Utot ≈ 0.9, while our best estimate of the fraction of
mutations with critical slightly deleterious effects is
expected to be between fsdm ≈ 10% and fsdm ≈ 50%. Combining these values makes us expect Usdm ≈ 0.2 slightly deleterious mutations with critical effects/haploid genome/

generation with a lower limit of Usdm ≈ 0.04 and an upper
limit of Usdm ≈ 0.45. These values may have to be doubled,
depending on the genome model that is used for accounting for the effects of diploidy. To err on the side of caution
and provide a better feeling for the effects of mutation
rates we plot values from Usdm = 0.01 to Usdm = 1 in Figure
1.
