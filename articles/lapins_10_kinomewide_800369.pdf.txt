Abstract
Background: Protein kinases play crucial roles in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Abnormal function of
protein kinases can lead to many serious diseases, such as cancer. Kinase inhibitors have potential for treatment of
these diseases. However, current inhibitors interact with a broad variety of kinases and interfere with multiple vital
cellular processes, which causes toxic effects. Bioinformatics approaches that can predict inhibitor-kinase interactions
from the chemical properties of the inhibitors and the kinase macromolecules might aid in design of more selective
therapeutic agents, that show better efficacy and lower toxicity.
Results: We applied proteochemometric modelling to correlate the properties of 317 wild-type and mutated kinases
and 38 inhibitors (12,046 inhibitor-kinase combinations) to the respective combination's interaction dissociation
constant (Kd). We compared six approaches for description of protein kinases and several linear and non-linear
correlation methods. The best performing models encoded kinase sequences with amino acid physico-chemical zscale descriptors and used support vector machines or partial least- squares projections to latent structures for the
correlations. Modelling performance was estimated by double cross-validation. The best models showed high
predictive ability; the squared correlation coefficient for new kinase-inhibitor pairs ranging P2 = 0.67-0.73; for new
kinases it ranged P2kin = 0.65-0.70. Models could also separate interacting from non-interacting inhibitor-kinase pairs
with high sensitivity and specificity; the areas under the ROC curves ranging AUC = 0.92-0.93. We also investigated the
relationship between the number of protein kinases in the dataset and the modelling results. Using only 10% of all data
still a valid model was obtained with P2 = 0.47, P2kin = 0.42 and AUC = 0.83.
Conclusions: Our results strongly support the applicability of proteochemometrics for kinome-wide interaction
modelling. Proteochemometrics might be used to speed-up identification and optimization of protein kinase targeted
and multi-targeted inhibitors.

Background
Protein kinases comprise a large family of membranebound and cytosolic enzymes, with 518 genes identified
in the human genome [1]. All protein kinases catalyze the
transfer of the γ-phosphate of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues of protein substrates. Together with the

protein phosphotases, kinases act as regulatory switches
for essentially all cellular processes, including metabolic
pathways, cell growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. Abnormal function of protein kinases leads to
development of many serious diseases, such as cancer,
diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and
diseases of the heart. In particular, many cancers (breast,
ovary, lung, liver, colon, and prostate cancer, lymphoma,
glioma, melanoma, and others) may be linked with
increased activity of specific growth-factor-receptor

tyrosine kinases due to overexpression, or mutations
leading to constitutively active forms [2].
Great hopes were placed that inhibition of dysfunctional kinases will lead to new highly effective therapies.
The first small-molecule kinase inhibitor, imatinib, was
launched in 2001 as an anticancer agent for the treatment
of chronic myeloid leukemia; its action being to inhibit
the constitutively active form of Abelson tyrosine (ABL)
kinase. Since then, eight compounds targeting the kinase
catalytic domain were approved for treatment of various
forms of cancer; over thirty kinase inhibitors are in the
clinical phases of development, and many more are in
preclinical pipelines.
A major problem in the development of kinase inhibitors is to achieve specificity. Most of the kinase inhibitors
in current development interact with the kinases' ATP
binding cleft, where they compete with ATP [3]. However, the ATP-binding site is highly conserved among all
kinases and it is therefore difficult to design a drug selective for only one kinase at a time. Other functional
domains that have been exploited to target kinases are
also conserved among numerous kinases making the
design of selective inhibitors problematic also in these
cases. In fact, a large-scale screening undertaken by
Fabian et al. [4] revealed that the three first FDA
approved inhibitors actually interacted with about one
sixth of the protein kinases included in the screen; each of
them cross interacted with between 18 to 23 of 119 evaluated protein kinases. Seventeen other kinase inhibitors in
pre-clinical and clinical phases of development were also
tested in this study and were shown to possess various
degree of promiscuity; only one of the compounds interacted with less than five kinases.
Many promising kinase inhibitors were abandoned
early due to toxicity [5]. Yet another common reason for
failure was lack of clinical efficacy. The latter problem can
be attributed to the multitude and complexity of cellular
signaling cascades, with redundant pathways and complex feed back mechanisms. Use of multi-targeted compounds that can selectively inhibit a specific group of
kinases of such pathways might increase the chance to
achieve clinical antitumor activity [6]. Yet another reason
for lack of clinical efficacy is resistance that arises due to
mutations in the targeted oncogene. E.g., drug resistance
in imatinib-treated leukemia patients appears due to
mutations in the BCR-ABL fusion protein. This prompts
the need for new generations of drugs that can override
the acquired resistance by inhibiting the mutated oncogene [7,8].
A computational method widely applied in drug design
is quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
modelling. QSAR models are used to optimize lead compounds for target activity and other properties (e.g.,
ADME and toxicity) and to perform virtual screening to

Page 2 of 15

find new hits. However, drawbacks of QSAR are that its
models consider only properties of ligands and that it
analyzes interactions with only one drug target at a time.
Hence QSAR models are unable to generalize between
multiple targets.
A more general approach is proteochemometric modelling, which we introduced some time ago to study differences in mechanisms of molecular recognition for
groups of related proteins [9,10]. Proteochemometric
models are based on experimentally determined interaction data for series of proteins interacting with series of
ligands, like organic compounds, peptide inhibitors, substrates, etc. These data are correlated to descriptors of the
two sets of interacting entities, which creates models that
can be used to predict activities of yet untested ligandprotein combinations, as well as foresee activity profiles
of novel unseen ligands and proteins.
Proteochemometric models take advantage of the fact
that 3 D structures of homologous proteins are more conserved than their primary sequences and functions. Thus,
proteins that have diverged functionally during evolution
may still share the same structural organization and
exploit similar molecular interaction mechanisms. The
principle behind proteochemometrics is simple. It
requires (1) consistent interaction data, (2) numerical
descriptions of relevant physico-chemical and/or structural properties of both ligands and the protein macromolecules, and (3) a non-linear correlation method that
jointly uses the two sets of descriptors to explain ligandprotein complementarities and interaction profiles. We
have previously successfully applied proteochemometrics
to create high-resolution models for ligand interactions
with several classes of G-protein coupled receptors and
for inhibition of multiple mutated variants of the HIV-1
protease. The aim of this study was to evaluate several
types of kinase descriptors and compare the performance
of different multivariate correlation methods in largescale proteochemometric modelling of protein kinaseinhibitor interactions.

Results
Performance of different types of kinase descriptors in PCA
and PLS-DA models

In order to compare the performance of the alignmentbased approach and the five alignment-independent
approaches used herein for describing protein kinase
sequences we applied principal component analysis
(PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA). PCA was performed to visualize how different
types of descriptors separate the seven groups of protein
kinases confined in the data set of 317 sequences. PLSDA was used to obtain a quantitative measure of the ability of the descriptors to discriminate these groups. The
seven kinase groups were as defined in [1], namely: AGC,

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

CaMK, CK1, CMGC, STE, TK, and TKL. (The so-called
atypical and other kinases were included in the PCA analysis but they were excluded from the PLS-DA modelling.)
The first three principal components of the PCA models for the six sets of descriptors are visualized in Figure 1,
Panels A to F. As seen from panels A and B, SO-PAA and
CTD descriptors distribute the kinases in a more or less
random fashion, albeit part of tyrosine kinases are separated from other groups, and the STE and CK1 groups
are quite compact. Clustering into groups is more evident
when the AAC-DC descriptors and MACCs of z-scale
descriptors are used (Panels C and D). For these descriptors the location of the TK group, which is the largest
group in the data set, shows almost no overlap with the

Figure 1 Plots representing the separation of kinase groups in
the three first components of PCA models. Panels A-F show results
of six PCA models using various types of alignment independent (A-G)
and alignment based (F) kinase descriptions. Each one of the 317 protein kinases is represented by a tetrahedron, color-coded according to
its belonging to a kinase group: black, AGC (named after member families PKA, PKG and PKC); red, CAMK (calcium/calmodulin regulated kinases); blue, CK1 (casein kinases); electric green, CMGC (named after
member families CDK, MAPK, GSK3, and CLK); orange/amber, STE (homologues of yeast Sterile kinases); magenta, TK (tyrosine kinases); sea
green, TKL (tyrosine kinase-like kinases); gray, atypical/other. Note that
in Panels A and B kinase groups do not form distinct clusters, whereas
in the other panels the largest kinase groups are clearly separated.

other groups. Finally, the ACCs of z-scale descriptors
(using the maximum lag L = 50; see below the reason for
selecting this lag) and the z-scale descriptors of aligned
sequences give good separation of most of the kinase
groups (Panels E and F). However, a notable difference
between the two last is that ACCs separate subgroups of
TKs, while the first three PCs of descriptors of the
aligned sequences do not reveal such sub-clustering. On
the other hand, the alignment-based descriptors are the
only ones that separate CMGC kinases as being substantially different from the other groups. As seen from Panel
F, for the alignment-based approach the CMGC kinases
form a distinct cluster in the first two PCs.
PLS-DA finds the directions in PC space where maximum separation among the classes is obtained and where
each class forms a maximally compact cluster. In an ideal
situation a cross-validated correlation coefficient Q2 = 1
indicates that all members of a class are predicted to have
y = 1, whereas all non-members are predicted to have y =
0. In reality Q2 is always lower than 1, which is due to
intra-class variations. Nevertheless, a Q2 within the range
0.6-0.8 still indicates a good separation of classes, with
few or no mispredictions. Should Q2 drop down to 0.40.6, or even less, we have a warning that classes overlap
and that the model will make multiple mispredictions.
(Anyhow, the predictions would still be better than random. In fact, a random model has a Q2 = 0).
Cross validation results for each type of kinase description for each kinase group are shown graphically in Figure 2, where panels A to F present PLS-DA results for the
same descriptor types as in Figure 1, A-F. Similarly as for
the PCA models, z-scale based descriptions perform the
best, with the alignment based approach performing over
all the best. As seen, extremely high predictive ability was
obtained with the Q2 values for the seven kinase groups

Figure 2 Predictive ability of PLS discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
models estimated by five fold-cross-validation. Kinase descriptions
in the six models presented in panels A-F correspond to respective
panels in Figure 1. Q2 values may vary from 0 to 1. A low value indicates
that a kinase group is randomly mixed with the others, while a value
approaching 1 indicates a perfect discrimination. The overall high Q2
values certify that the respective types of kinase descriptions have captured sequence properties that are present in members of a specific kinase group while being absent among all other kinases.

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339

ranging from 0.89 to 0.97, the overall Q2 being 0.94 (Figure 2, Panel F). Comparisons of all six panels of Figure 2
reveal that, irrespectively of the description type, the best
separation is obtained for TKs. The lowest Q2 values were
for all descriptions obtained for TKL kinases suggesting
that this group is more diverse than the other groups; (as
its name indicates, the TKL group comprises enzymes
that are phylogenetically related to TKs, although they
are in fact serine-threonine kinases). However, cross-validation results showed that none of the TKL kinases was
mispredicted as being non-member, and none of the
other kinases was mispredicted as being member of TKL
group in the models that used MACCs or alignment
based descriptions. However, the model that exploited
ACCs mispredicted one TKL kinase (the TNNI3K
kinase).
Selection of optimal lags for ACC and MACC transforms

An additional goal of the preliminary modelling was to
identify the optimal complexity of the ACC and MACC
descriptions. (In other words to find the maximum lag L,
up to which descriptors contribute to improved separation of kinase groups). As described in Methods, covariances over long distances are less helpful in finding
physico-chemical similarities in related protein
sequences due to the differences in the length of segments that connect their functional units. Use of very
many ACC or MACC terms with large lags may then give
rise to chance correlations, deteriorating the resolution of
any mathematical models created from them. By comparing PLS-DA models exploiting ACC and MACC descriptors with different maximum lags (L being 10, 25, 50, and
100) we showed that for both descriptor types the results
were somewhat inferior for L = 10; the overall Q2 being
0.76 and 0.86 for ACC and MACC based models, respectively. Increasing L to 25 gave major improvements (the
overall Q2 being 0.90 and 0.89, respectively); further
increase to L = 50 produced yet slightly better models.
Finally, including very long distance covariances with L =
100 led to slightly reduced predictive ability, the Q2s
dropping to 0.88 and 0.87 for ACCs and MACCs, respectively. An interesting finding was that the performance of
the two descriptor types was quite similar when the maximum lag was set to L = 25 and larger. This was so both in
terms of overall Q2, and with respect to Q2's for the seven
groups of kinases (data not shown). Based on all these
results we elected to use ACC and MACC descriptors
with maximum lag 50 in all further modelling of kinaseinhibitor interactions.
Performance of different types of kinase descriptors and
multivariate correlation methods in predicting kinaseinhibitor activity

We used several machine learning methods to correlate
the descriptors of kinase inhibitors and kinases to the

interaction activities. The methods used were as follows:
decision trees (DT), one nearest neighbour (1-NN) and knearest neighbour (k-NN) approach, support vector
machines (SVM), and partial least-square projections to
latent structures (PLS). The first four methods induce
non-linear models, whereas PLS is a linear method.
When using PLS we created both linear and non linear
models; in the latter case the dataset included crossterms derived from kinase and inhibitor descriptions.
The predictive abilities for new inhibitor-kinase combinations (P2) and new kinases (P2kin) as assessed by outerloop cross-validation are presented in Table 1. The most
predictive models were obtained using SVM, where for
all three z-scale based description methods the P2 values
fell in the range 0.70-0.73 and the P2kin values in the range
0.67-0.70. The PLS (with cross-terms) and k-NN models
performed almost as good. (However, the performance of
the k-NN model exploiting ACC descriptions was inferior; its P2kin being only 0.53.) Models based on AAC-DC
descriptors performed clearly worse than the z-scale
based descriptions, but also here the SVM model was the
most predictive; the P2 being 0.68 and P2kin being 0.64,
whereas the values of these parameters for PLS model
were only 0.58 and 0.53.
The inferior performance for the AAC-DC descriptions
is not surprising. In fact it seems quite unlikely that the
fraction of any single dipeptide would show significant
correlation with the functional properties of the kinases.
Such correlations, however, can become evident for
larger sets of dipeptide combinations (i.e., tripeptides,
tetrapeptides, and longer similar sequence stretches), giving an advantage to the SVM model which by the use of
its non-linear kernel can approximate high-complexity
interaction effects between the descriptors. The difference between the performances of SVM and PLS models
is even larger when proteins are described by CTD or by
SO-PAA descriptors; the P2kin for PLS models using these
two sets of descriptors being, respectively, 0.45 and 0.44,
compared to 0.60 and 0.63 for the SVM models.
For any set of descriptors the k-NN method outperformed 1-NN (see Table 1). However, the optimal number of neighbours found to be used by the crossvalidation inner-loop was quite low, and ranged in all
cases 3 to 5. The predictions of k-NN models are thus
based on local subsets of the data set, and for this reason
it would be problematic to use these models to draw any
general conclusions on the molecular properties that
determine kinase-inhibitor complementarity.
Finally, as expected, PLS modelling without use of
kinase-inhibitor cross-terms explained only a minor part
of the activity variation; the P2kin for all three z-scaleexploiting models being 0.32 (see Table 1). This result
shows that the non-linear part which describes kinase-

Shown are the performances of proteochemometric models based on decision trees (DT), one nearest neighbour (1-NN) and k-nearest
neighbour (k-NN) approaches, support vector machines (SVM), and partial least-square projections to latent structures, with (PLS) and without
cross-terms (PLS w/o cross-terms). P2 and P2kin indicate the squared correlation coefficient from outer loop of cross-validation for, respectively,

inhibitor selectivity dominate over the linear part that
describes the average activity of a ligand for the protein
series and the average activity of all ligands for a particular protein. The high non-linearity in the dataset is also
likely the reason for the moderate success of the decision
tree algorithm, which for any of the six used kinase
descriptions created a massive tree with over 300 leaves
explaining 65-71% of the activity variation (data not
shown). However, all these trees suffered in ability to generalize to novel kinases; the P2kin for various descriptions
ranging only 0.30-0.43.
Distribution of prediction errors in SVM, PLS and k-NN
models

The performance of the SVM, PLS, and k-NN models
exploiting z-scale descriptors of aligned sequences (i.e.
the description that gave the best models) is further illustrated in Figure 3. The figure presents histograms for the
prediction errors calculated in the outer-loop of crossvalidation for 1/5 of the kinases that had been entirely
excluded from the modelling (see Methods for details).
The distributions of errors in the SVM and PLS models
are very similar (cf. panels A and B). The cumulative plot
demonstrates that in the SVM model the difference
between predicted and observed pKd values range 0-0.25
logarithmic units for 57% of the kinase-inhibitor combinations; for 75% of the combinations they fall below 0.5
logarithmic units; for 89% they are less than one logarith-

mic units, and for 99% less than two logarithmic units.
The corresponding fractions in the PLS model are 49%,
70%, 88%, and 98%. To interpret these results one should
keep in mind that the total span of kinase-inhibitor activities exceeded five logarithmic units, namely from pKd = 5
to 10.62, and all non-interacting entities were assigned
the numerical value pKd = 4; hence mispredictions by
more than six units could be theoretically possible.
For the k-NN model the pattern of error distribution is
quite different (Figure 3, Panel C). Here the prediction
error was zero for more than one half of the non-interacting pairs (i.e. all their nearest neighbours had also been
identified as non-interacting in the primary screen and
were in the modelling assigned the same numerical value
pKd = 4). However, 14% of the prediction errors exceed
one logarithmic unit and 4% exceed two logarithmic
units, thus indicating that predictions of the k NN model
are less accurate compared to those obtained by SVM and
PLS. In other words, activities for inhibitors interacting
with overall quite similar kinases may vary a lot and
regression models can better explain this than the nearest
neighbour approach.
Dependence of modelling performance on the size of the
dataset

Although both SVM, PLS, and k-NN models showed
good predictive ability they were based on more than
12,000 data points. It would thus be of obvious interest to

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

know the robustness of the proteochemometric approach
when less data are available. We therefore assessed the
relationship between the sparseness of the data matrix
used and the performance of the model. To this end we
created models using 60, 40, 20, and 10 percent of all
data. For example, when 10% of the data was used to calculate the P2kin value, the set of 317 kinases was randomly
split into ten partitions of about equal size. Modelling
was then performed using only one of these partitions at
a time and the nine remaining partitions were used to
evaluate the model obtained. The procedure of splitting
the dataset was iterated ten times in order to assure
reproducibility of the results. The P2 and P2kin measures
for models exploiting z-scale descriptors of aligned
kinase sequences are presented in Table 2, where the values for 80% the dataset size are in fact identical with the
above-presented results of 5-fold outer-loop cross-validation (cf. Table 1). The performance of the models
decreases only slightly when 40-60% of the whole dataset
is used for the model building, and the models are still
predictive when as few as 10% of all kinase-inhibitor
combinations or when 10% of all kinases are present in
the dataset (i.e., estimating P2 and P2kin, respectively).
Moreover, the small margins between the P2 and P2kin
parameters indicate that the reliability of predictions for
"new unassayed kinases" does not differ much from the
reliability of predictions for the kinases for which some
interaction data have been already assayed and used in
the modelling. Comparisons of the results for the three
data analysis methods also indicate that their performance is more similar for larger datasets. For sparsely
populated datasets the performance of k-NN method
deteriorates faster than for the SVM and PLS methods.
Predicting interacting versus non-interacting kinaseinhibitor pairs

Although all models predict interaction activities on a
continuous scale, they can also be used to predict
whether new inhibitors and kinases interact or not. In the
quantitative modelling we assigned the value pKd = 4 to
all inhibitor-kinase combinations that had been found
not to interact in the primary screen - the screen for
which the detection limit was pKd = 5. Hence if the activity predicted for an inhibitor-kinase pair falls below a prespecified threshold level, the pair could be classified as
non-interacting, while if it falls above this threshold it
could be classified as interacting. The selection of the
threshold value will affect the sensitivity and specificity of
the classification, which can be defined as:
sensitivity =

truepositives
truepositives + false negatives

Page 6 of 15

specificity =

true negatives
true negatives + false positives

A common measure for the classification quality is the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is
plotted as sensitivity versus one minus specificity upon
varying the discrimination threshold value. The area
under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the discriminatory power of a classifier, which is insensitive to class
distributions and the costs of misclassifications; AUC = 1
indicates perfect classification, while AUC = 0.5 means
that the classifier does not perform better then random
guessing.
Figure 4 compares ROC curves for the k-NN, SVM, and
PLS models, built on the largest and on the smallest sets
of kinases as described in the previous section (i.e. using
80% and 10% of all 317 kinases). Inspection of Figure 4
shows, for instance, that at a sensitivity of 0.80 the SVM
model build on the largest set of kinases has a specificity
of 0.92. In other words, using a threshold that identifies
80% of truly active kinase-inhibitor pairs as being active,
the number of false-positives amounts to only 8%. The
performance of the PLS and k-NN models were slightly
worse, at the sensitivity of 0.80 the false-positives amount
to 11 and 13%, respectively.
The good performance of the classification is further
indicated from the ROC areas, which for the models built
on 80% of the kinases were 0.93, 0.92 and 0.91 for, respectively, the SVM, PLS, and k NN model. Interestingly, the
models built on only 10% of the kinases also show good
classification performance, the ROC areas being, respectively, 0.83, 0.82, and 0.79 for SVM, PLS, and k-NN models. This finding indicates that even in the cases when
quantitative models do not possess very high predictive
ability in terms of P2, they may still be able to separate
active and inactive kinase-inhibitor combinations.
Accordingly, our models should be useful for virtual
large-scale screening to select the promising objects prior
to their experimental testing, while sorting away objects
with a less probability of having the properties sought for
in a development project.

Discussion
Design of selective and multiselective medications
requires understanding of the properties of the biological
targets that distinguish the chosen target(s) from numerous similar "anti-targets" encoded in the human genome.
Contemporary drug design has to a large extent been
focused to structure-based methods where ligands are
designed to fit into a binding pocket of the target. This
requires knowledge of the exact 3 D structures of the targets and anti-targets, which is a problem for protein-

kinases as X-ray structures have been solved for only 124
human protein kinase domains [11].
Proteochemometrics, on the other hand, has a distinct
advantage when the studied proteins share the same
structural organization since primary amino acid
sequences can then be used without the need to have
high-resolution 3 D structures of the targets. Proteochemometrics has also the advantage that multiple targets
and anti-targets can be encompassed in one single model.
Structural alignments of protein kinases have shown that
they all contain universal conserved subdomains whereas
their amino acid sequences still show quite notable variation. In fact, there is generally a much higher degree of
conservation of the 3D-structures among protein families
than of their primary sequences [12]. The average pairwise sequence identity over the kinase domains falls
below 30%, and only a small fraction of residues are
markedly conserved across the entire superfamily [13].
Use of sequence-derived descriptions can hence be considered to be a rational approach for kinase representation in multivariate modelling, stated that the sequence

descriptions are made in such a way that they are relevant
for the structural and functional organization of the
kinases. Descriptions can be derived based on prior
sequence alignments or in alignment independent ways,
the latter approaches are advantageous for less similar
sequences, when unambiguous alignments are impossible
to obtain.
In the first phase of this study we performed PCA and
PLS-DA, using one set of alignment based and five sets of
alignment independent descriptors of protein kinase
amino acid sequences. The purpose of this analysis was to
evaluate the ability of the different descriptions to separate kinases into groups according to their functions.
PLS-DA for the best model (which exploited alignment
based z-scale descriptions) afforded excellent separation
of the seven groups of kinases; the cross-validated
squared correlation coefficients fell between 0.93-0.98 for
six of the groups, while for the more diverse tyrosine
kinase-like kinase group it was 0.89.
As explained in the Methods section, PLS-DA models
create regression equations for each of the modelled
classes and thus identify properties that are more typical,
or even unique, for a particular class compared to the
other classes. Thus, inspection of the alignment based
PLS-DA regression equation exploiting z-scale descriptors reveals that in some cases the description of the
physico-chemical properties of very short sequence
stretches and even of single residues are sufficient to separate all members of one kinase group from all other
kinases. In one such example, when we inspected the
alignment based PLS-DA model we revealed that a conserved proline residue located surrounded by two hydrophobic amino acids in the activation loop of the TKs
sequences is the sufficient pattern for class separation. In
the majority of the cases this triplet is embraced by two
positively charged lysine or arginine residues (e.g., the
sequence stretch being KFPIK in ABL1 kinase, KVPIK in
EGFR kinase, and RLPVK in KIT kinase). Analysis of the

alignment independent PLS-DA model exploiting AACDC descriptors further identifies that groups of kinases
are often distinguished by the model by small sets of
dipeptides (for instance, each of dipeptides CW, VW, RN,
and GM is present in more than 90% of TKs compared to
only 15-35% of kinases from the six other groups). Such
identified specific sequence residues or patterns, which
may be identified by our models, could accordingly
potentially be addressed in the design of targeted and
multi-targeted drugs. In fact, a few such amino acids
(sometimes termed 'selectivity filters') have been previously exploited in drug design for kinases. This includes
the so-called gatekeeper residue, which is a bulky amino
acid present in most kinases, while 20% of the kinases
have a threonine at this position. The property was used
in design of selectivity for ABL kinase inhibitors. (However, unfortunately, the residue position is also a common
site for mutations that confer resistance to imatinib, gefitinib, and erlotinib [14]). A study of Cohen et al. [15]
designed inhibitors for RSK family kinases by targeting
two selectivity filters in the ATP binding site, namely the
threonine gatekeeper and a cysteine residue, which is an
uncommon amino acid in the kinases' active site. These
two amino acids that distinguishes RSKs from other protein kinases were sufficient to confer high activity of the
designed inhibitor.
Although we here limited PLS-DA modelling to separation of seven major groups of the kinase superfamily the
analysis can be performed hierarchically at any resolution, e.g., to delineate particular families, subfamilies, and
even single kinases.
In the subsequent studies we created quantitative models for kinase-inhibitor interaction activities using the six
types of kinase descriptions and performing correlations
using SVM, PLS, k-NN, and decision trees. The small
molecule inhibitors were in all models represented by a
unified set of 3D-structural and physicochemical property descriptors. Models that exploited z-scale descriptions of the alignable parts of the protein kinase
sequences performed the best. However, using ACC or
MACC transformations gave only slightly inferior models
when correlations to the activity data were done by SVM
or PLS. ACC transformed descriptors performed worse
with the k-NN approach, while MACC transformations
resulted in a weaker model with use of decision trees. The
advantages of ACC and MACC transforms are that they
do not require prior alignment and that they are calculated from full-length sequences of kinase domains,
which in the present data set varied from 194 to 606 residues (albeit for about one half of kinases it ranged 240260 residues; for less than 30% kinases it exceeded 280
residues). Whereas ACCs reflect the covariances of
amino acid properties over whole sequences, MACCs
pinpoint individual pairs of residues with specific prop-

erty combinations. MACC based models may thus identify patterns that are not confined to the same location in
each and every protein and/or are situated in sequence
stretches that can not be aligned unambiguously over the
whole dataset. Consequently, models exploiting MACCs
may complement the alignment-based models in analysis
and prediction of kinase-inhibitor interactions. The three
other descriptions for the protein sequences used (CTD,
SO-PAA, and AAC-DC) showed inferior performances
compared to z-scale based descriptions and thus appear
less useful in proteochemometric modelling.
SVM outperformed the other data analysis methods,
including PLS, in both the prediction accuracy for the
active kinase-inhibitor combinations as manifested by P2
and P2kin parameters (Tables 1 and 2) and in the ability to
distinguish interacting versus non-interacting kinaseinhibitor pairs as revealed by the areas under the ROC
curves (Figure 4). Accordingly, SVM seems to be the optimal choice for predicting full kinome-wide selectivity
profiles of the existing compounds, and for virtual
screening to find new hits with desired selectivities. However, an important point is that SVM is essentially a 'black
box' technique, which makes interpretations of its models
difficult. Thus, even if the performance of SVM in virtual
screening is superior to PLS, it is problematic to comprehend which of the molecular properties of kinases and
inhibitors that are important in the model. PLS contrasts
to 'black box' methods like SVM and to locally derived
kNN and DT models because it expresses the correlation
results in a single straightforwardly interpretable regression equation. Moreover, PLS provides additional tools
for model diagnostics, such as score and loading plots
and 'distance to model' parameters that allow identification of outliers and assessment of reliability of extrapolations outside the modelled chemical and interaction

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

spaces [16]. Consequently, the parallel use of PLS and
SVM modelling techniques may be advantageous when
one aims at obtaining models for both predictions and
interpretations, and cross-checking of model performances. (In this context it ought to be mentioned that
several approaches have been recently suggested to give
SVM models some transparency [17-19], which may be in
the advantage for use of SVM in proteochemometric
modelling).
The models built on small sub-parts of the dataset
showed the robustness of the proteochemometric modelling approach. Thus, even for the smallest dataset comprising only about 30 kinases the SVM and PLS models
showed acceptable predictive ability. The performances
of the models based on small data-sets were even more
impressive in prediction of interacting versus non-interacting kinase-inhibitor pairs; the discriminatory power of
SVM and PLS models being, respectively, 0.83 and 0.82
for the models created on 30 kinases (compared to 0.93
and 0.92 for the largest dataset size). These results may
have a wide impact to the protein kinase field as they
mean that a relatively limited amount of experimental
work is needed to afford qualitative and quantitative
interaction models that will generalize for the whole
kinome.
Success of any empirical modelling depends on the
quality of data, which in proteochemometrics should
comprise accurate activity measurements and descriptions of relevant physico-chemical and/or structural
properties of proteins and their ligands. Yet another prerequisite for proteochemometrics is an adequate composition of the dataset, which should be balanced and
include both interacting and non-interacting proteinligand combinations. Unfortunately, 'negative' results are
often omitted in study reports. Moreover, interaction
databases populated by data from multiple series, contain
typically activities for a fairly low fraction of all possible
ligand-protein combinations, which implies that a bulk of
the non-interacting entity pairs are absent. Modelling of
sparse data matrices with overrepresented high activity
data would inevitably give rise to false-positive predictions. Hence, the success of any modelling study owes
most to using a well-balanced dataset, such as the here
used dataset comprising data for both active and inactive
kinase-inhibitor combinations for more than one half of
the human kinome.
Although the modelled dataset covered more than
12,000 interactions, the series of 38 kinase inhibitors can
not be considered as large, even though it included seven
of the eight presently approved anticancer agents as well
as other compounds with mutually dissimilar inhibition
profiles. One can thus expect to gain further improvements by analyzing data for many more chemical compounds providing wider and denser coverage of the

Page 9 of 15

chemical and interaction spaces. In the present study the
dataset parts for modelling and validation were selected
randomly to assure objective assessment of the modelling
performances. However, it is possible to apply statistical
experimental design [20] to choose small representative
panels of kinases to be used for assaying and interaction
modelling. One technique is D-optimal design that could
be used to select kinases that cover most of the diversity
of the kinase sequence and activity space. Designed
molecular libraries have proven much more informative
than random collections, and they have been shown in
some cases to allow a 103-104 fold reduction of the experimental work required, while still retaining the full generalization ability of derived interaction models [21,21]. We
can hence conclude that the values in Table 1 are the lowest limits of the predictive abilities, which would be surpassed in any models for datasets of the same size if
kinases were selected according to principles of statistical
experimental design. Hence, for any experimental work
to be undertaken in the kinase field following this study
we would strongly encourage the use of experimental
design. The final outcome will be kinome wide models
that can predict the interaction strength of a random
chemical over all known protein kinases.

Conclusions
In this study we developed kinome-wide proteochemometric models for the prediction of kinase-inhibitor
interaction profiles. We compared several alignmentbased and alignment-independent approaches for the
description of protein kinases, evaluated the performances of linear and non-linear correlation methods, and
investigated the relationship between the size of the dataset and the predictive ability of the models obtained. Our
best models are highly predictive on a quantitative scale,
and can delineate interacting and non-interacting kinaseinhibitor combinations. One of the findings of this study
is that models built on quite limited amount of kinase
data are still capable to generalize over the whole human
kinome. We thus foresee that the here shown routes to
concomitant proteochemometric kinome wide modelling
will markedly speed-up the discovery and optimization of
protein kinase targeted and multi-targeted drugs.
Methods
Interaction activity data

We used the dataset published by Karaman et al. [23]
comprising dissociation constants (Kd) of 38 small-molecule kinase inhibitors tested against a panel of 317 human
kinases, in total 38 × 317 = 12,046 activities. All major
kinase groups, as defined by Manning et al. [1], were represented in the dataset, namely: AGC, CaMK, CK1,
CMGC, STE, TK, and TKL. The kinase inhibitor series
included approved drugs (dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib,

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

imatinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib), trial drugs
and experimental compounds (flavopiridol, roscovitine,
and others), and the natural product staurosporine. For
24.8% of the inhibitor-kinase combinations an activity
better than 10 μM had been observed in a primary
screen, and the exact Kd values were then determined.
The dissociation constants found ranged from 10-5M to
2.4 × 10-11M and were expressed as negative logarithms
of the Kd values (pKd); the transformed values ranging
from 5 to 10.62. In order to obtain a full data matrix we
assigned a numerical value pKd = 4 to the inhibitor-kinase
pairs that had been identified as not interacting in the
primary screen; i.e., pKd was set one unit lower than the
threshold value (pKd = 5) of the primary screen. This was
a trade-off between two qualities of the conceived mathematical models to be derived from the data: a very high
margin would prioritize discrimination between the
active and inactive kinase-inhibitor pairs on the expense
of the accuracy for the predictions for the active ones; on
the other hand, a low margin would reduce the model's
discriminative ability between interacting and non-interacting pairs. Our selected value seemed reasonable since
it would allow achieving both goals, stated that the errors
of prediction of a model do not exceed one logarithmic
unit.
Description of kinase inhibitors

The structures of kinase inhibitors were drawn by ISIS/
Draw and converted to 3 D by the Corina unit of the Tsar
3.3 (Accelrys, Inc.) software. Partial atomic charges were
derived using the Charge2 utility and the geometries were
optimized by energy minimization using the Cosmic utility of Tsar 3.3. Compounds were then characterized by
various molecular descriptors using Dragon 2.1 software
(Talete S.r.l.). The following descriptor classes were calculated: constitutional descriptors, counts of functional
groups and atom-centered fragments, geometrical
descriptors, charge and aromaticity indices, empirical
descriptors, and molecular properties. When two
descriptors were highly correlated (pairwise r2 > 0.9), we
excluded the one showing the highest correlation with
any other descriptor of the descriptor set. In this way, 150
molecular descriptors were obtained for each inhibitor
for the modelling. All descriptors were mean centred and
scaled to unit variance prior to use in modelling.
Description of protein kinases

The panel of protein kinases comprised 317 entities (i.e.,
more than a half the known human kinome). Of these 28
contained point or cassette mutations, and a few kinases
contained deletions of up to eight residue long sequence
stretches. The sequences for the kinases' kinase domains
were retrieved from KinBase database http://kinase.com/
kinbase. Although the length of the kinase domains var-

Page 10 of 15

ied from 194 to 606 amino acids, almost 90% of them
were just between 240 to 300 amino acids long.
Alignment-based physico-chemical z-scale description of
kinase sequences

We used two types of kinase sequence descriptions:
alignment based and alignment independent. For the
alignment based, a multiple sequence alignment was performed over the entire sequence set by the ClustalW 2.0
software [24], using its default settings (GONNET 250
matrix) and applying ten iteration cycles to refine the
progressive alignment. Those parts of the alignment that
contained gaps for more than 50% of the kinase
sequences were removed from the alignment, which left
264 aligned positions. (These gaps corresponded to
sequence stretches that were quite unique among most
kinases and they were located far from the ATP binding
site). The aligned positions were then described by amino
acid physico-chemical properties encapsulated in the five
z-scales, z1-z5, derived by Sandberg et al. [25]. Z-scales
are quantitative descriptors obtained from principal component analysis (vide infra) of 26 measured and computed physico-chemical properties of the 20 naturally
encoded amino acids and 67 synthetic alpha amino acids.
The three first of these z-scales describe about 70% of the
variation in the original data, and all five describe more
than 95% of the variation. Being principal components, zscales are mean-centered and uncorrelated to each-other,
and can be tentatively interpreted as reflecting hydrophobicity (z1), steric properties (z2), polarity (z3) and other
electronic properties (z4, z5) of amino acids. In this way,
the differences in physico-chemical properties of the
aligned kinase sequences were represented by 264 × 5 =
1320 descriptors.
Auto- and cross-covariances (ACCs) of z-scale descriptors

Z-scales are directly useful for encoding proteins stated
that the proteins show substantial conservation in their 3
D structural organization and that their primary
sequences are conserved to the extent that alignments
can be done unambiguously. However, if sequences are
aligned wrongly our attempts to find similarities and differences in the proteins' physico-chemical space would be
thwarted. Therefore, methods have been sought to avoid
the alignment step and transform sequence descriptions
directly into uniform matrices. One such method, the
auto- and cross-covariance (ACC) transform, describes
changes in some property or some property combinations over sequence stretches of different lengths [26].
This is done according to the equations:
N −lag

AC z,lag =

∑
i =1

V z,i ∗V z,i + lag
N − lag

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

N −lag

CC z a ≠ z b ,lag =

∑
i =1

V z a ,i ∗V z b ,i + lag
N − lag

where AC represents auto-covariances of the same
property (z-scale) and CC the cross-covariances of different z-scales, and where z = 1, 2, ..., Z (Z is 5, i.e. the number of z-scales), i = 1, 2, ..., N-lag (i is the amino acid
position in the sequence and N the total number of amino
acids), lag = 1, 2, ..., L (L is the maximum lag, i.e. the longest sequence stretch used, which can be up to the length
of the shortest sequence in the dataset), and V is the zscale value. The total number of ACC terms depends on
the chosen L and on the number of z-scales, and is L × Z2.
Larger maximum lags L allow for more detailed
description accounting for interactions of amino acids at
distant parts in a sequence. However, even closely related
proteins differ often by sequence insertions/deletions. As
a result, the probability of assigning an interaction to the
same ACC term is inversely proportional to the distance
between the sequence positions. Long distance covariances would hence be less helpful in finding physicochemical similarities in related sequences. We here calculated ACCs with maximum lags 10, 25, 50, and 100.
Maximums of auto- and cross-covariances (MACCs) of z-scale
descriptors

ACC-transformations provide a uniform set of descriptors that are independent of the length of each sequence
and which are able to capture characteristic physicochemical patterns of the protein. One limitation of ACCs
is that specific local sequence patterns may become concealed by the overall properties of the given sequence.
Another drawback is the difficulties to make interpretations. For example auto-covariances of the z1-scale would
be similar for a sequence consisting of predominantly
hydrophilic amino acids (represented by positive values)
and a sequence consisting of predominantly hydrophobic
amino acids (negative values). In both cases multiplications give positive values. (ACz1 terms would, however,
separate such two sequences from sequences where
hydrophilic amino acids alternate with hydrophobic ones
with certain periodicities).
To cope with these limitations of ACCs, a modified
algorithm was suggested in [27], where the positive and
negative descriptor values are considered separately and
only the maximum values for all possible interactions at
each lag is used to describe the sequences. Of the two
algorithms developed in [27] we applied the MACC1
transformation giving 4 × L × Z2 terms; i.e. four times as
many descriptors as an ACC with the same maximum
lag. (The alternative MACC2 algorithm was not used as it
ignores the direction of a sequence and hence seemed

Page 11 of 15

inappropriate for encoding proteins). We here calculated
MACCs with maximum lags 10, 25, 50, and 100.
It may be pointed out that, whereas each ACC term is
calculated from the whole protein sequence, the corresponding four MACC1 terms represent extremes of particular
physico-chemical
property
combinations
somewhere in the sequence. The MACC descriptions
thus retain full interpretability and can be traced back to
each residue pair. However, they may overstate the roles
of extreme physico-chemical properties for a protein
structure/function and depreciate the roles of 'moderate'
amino acids.
Composition, transition and distribution (CTD) of amino acid
properties

The CTD alignment-independent descriptors were proposed by Dubchak and coworkers [28], and are based on
seven amino acid properties (attributes): 1) hydrophobicity, 2) normalized van der Waals volume, 3) polarity, 4)
polarizability, 5) charge, 6) secondary structure, and 7)
solvent accessibility. For each of these seven attributes,
amino acids are divided into three classes. E.g., for the
hydrophobicity attribute, class 1 comprises polar amino
acids (RKEDQN), class 2 neutral amino acids (GASTPHY), and class 3 hydrophobic amino acids (CLVIMFW).
The composition descriptors then represent the overall
percentage of each class in the sequence. Since there are
seven attributes and three classes, 7 × 3 = 21 composition
descriptions can be computed. The transition descriptors
represent frequencies with which an attribute changes
class along the sequence, e.g., a class 1 amino acid is followed by a class 2 amino acid or vice versa. Since there are
three possible transitions between classes, 7 × 3 = 21
transition descriptors can be computed. The distribution
descriptors represent the distribution of each attribute in
the sequence. For each attribute and for each class, five
distribution descriptors are computed based on the following criteria: location of the first residue, 25% residues,
50% residues, 75% residues and 100% residues with a
given property. For instance, if the total length of a
sequence is N amino acids, and all polar amino acids (i.e.
members of hydrophobicity class 1) are among the first i
residues of the sequence, then the distribution descriptor
for 100% residues of the given class would be calculated
as i/N. Thus, the total number of distribution descriptors
is 5 × 7 × 3 = 121. CTD descriptors were computed by
using PROFEAT (Protein Feature) web server [29].
Sequence-order and pseudo-amino acid (SO-PAA) descriptors

The sequence-order and pseudo-amino acid descriptors
were proposed by Chou [30,31] and are used most successfully to predict protein subcellular location. We here
used the PROFEAT web server to calculate 60 sequenceorder-coupling numbers, 100 quasi-sequence-order
descriptors, and 50 pseudo-amino acid descriptors. The

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

sequence-order-coupling numbers are derived from the
physico-chemical distance matrix between pairs of amino
acids. The coupling number of rank d is defined as the
sum of squared physico-chemical distances between all
amino acids being located d residues from each other.
This is mathematically described by the equation:
N −d

td =

∑ (d

i ,i + d )

2

i =1

where di,i+d is the physicochemical distance between
the two amino acids at position i and i+d, and N is the
total length of the sequence. PROFEAT allows computing
these descriptors starting from rank d = 1 (i.e. neighbouring residues) up to d = 30 and using two different distance
matrices (physico-chemical distance by Schneider-Wrede
and chemical distance by Grantham) [29].
Quasi-sequence-order descriptors are thereafter computed from coupling numbers and from protein amino
acid composition (see [29] for mathematical equations).
Fifty quasi-sequence-order descriptors can be derived
from each set of coupling numbers. The first 20 quasisequence-order descriptors reflect the effects of the
amino acid composition and are calculated according to
the equation:
Xa =

fa
, a = Ala , Arg , Asn … Val.
20
30
∑ fa +w ∑ t d
a =1
d =1

where a is one of the twenty natural amino acids, fa is
the normalized occurrence for this amino acid, and w is a
weighting factor (w = 0.1).
The thirty other quasi-sequence-order descriptors
reflect the effects of sequence order, and are defined as:
Xd =

td
20
30
∑ fa +w ∑ t d
a =1
d =1

where the rank d is from 1 to 30.
Fifty pseudo amino acid descriptors were computed
similarly as quasi-sequence order descriptors. However,
the coupling numbers in the equations were replaced by
more complex correlation factors reflecting various physico-chemical properties of amino acids (see [31] for
details). The whole set of SO-PAA descriptors thus comprised 210 alignment independent descriptors encapsulating both the quantitative (physicochemical) and
qualitative (amino acid letter code) sequence properties.

Page 12 of 15

Amino acid and dipeptide composition (AAC-DC)

Amino acid composition descriptors represent the fractions for each of the twenty natural amino acids in a protein sequence, while dipeptide composition descriptors
represent the fractions of 20 × 20 = 400 possible dipeptides in the sequence [32]. Despite its simplicity the
method has been applied successfully, e.g., for classification of G-protein coupled receptors [33,34], nuclear
receptors [35], predictions of protein fold and predicting
the subcellular localization of proteins [36-38]. Amino
acid and dipeptide composition descriptors were computed by using the PROFEAT server.
Data preprocessing

All descriptors were mean-centered and scaled to unit
variance prior to their use. In order to account for differences in the number of inhibitor and kinase descriptors,
block scaling was applied. This was done by assigning
each block the weight 1/sqrt(N), where N is number of
descriptors in the block. In this way, the total sum of variances of all descriptors in each block became equal to 1.
The response variable (pKd) was mean centered prior to
applying data analysis.
Data analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA)

PCA is a multivariate projection method, which provides
compression of datasets containing large numbers of
variables (see [39] for algorithms and geometrical interpretation). Contrary to the original variables, which are
always multicollinear, the so-called principal components
(PCs) are orthogonal to each other; the first component
extracts the largest variance in the dataset, the second
component extracts the largest of the remaining variance,
and so on. The major patterns within the original data
can often be captured by a small number of components.
All the variance in a dataset with N objects is explained
by N-1 or less PCs. Thus, all descriptors of kinase inhibitors in the present dataset could be transformed into 37
PCs without any loss of information, and with the preservation of full interpretability. Similarly, any number of
descriptors of 317 kinases can be compressed to 316 PCs
(in fact, already half of this number explained over 9095% of the variance in any of the six sets of kinase
descriptions used herein).
Partial least-squares projections to latent structures (PLS)

PLS can be considered as an extension of PCA, which
along with the independent variables (X matrix) deals
with one or several dependent variables (Y vector or
matrix). PLS aims to find the relationship between the
two matrices and to develop a predictive model. This is
achieved by simultaneously projecting X and Y to latent
variables (PLS components), with an additional constraint to correlate them. (Thus, compared to PCs, the

Lapins and Wikberg BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/339

PLS components are tilted to maximize covariance
between projections of X and Y). PLS derives a regression
equation for each y variable where the regression coefficients reveal the direction and magnitude of the influence
of X-variables on y [16].
A special case of PLS is PLS discriminant analysis (PLSDA) where y variables are categorical and express the
class membership of objects (members of a given class
are numerically represented by the value 1 while nonmembers are represented by 0).
Several algorithms have been developed for performing
PLS; here we used orthogonalized-PLS [40] as implemented in Simca-P+ 11.5 (Umetrics AB) and NIPALS
[41] as implemented in Unscrambler-9.8 (CAMO Software AS) (the latter algorithm was applied for PLS-DA
modelling). An important decision in PLS is the choice of
the number of PLS components. Each extracted component increases the explained variation of both X and Y.
However, while the first components normally find real
correlations between the two blocks, increased model
complexity may give rise to chance correlations. To avoid
overfitting we applied five-fold inner-loop cross validation (see below).
Accounting for non-linear cooperative effects in PLS
modelling

PLS is a linear correlation method. However, in proteochemometrics there is a need to describe non-linear ligandprotein interaction effects (i.e., those effects that are governed by the complementarity of the interacting moieties
and determine the selectivities for the interactions) [9].
This is typically done by deriving cross-terms between
ligand and protein descriptors. Since the number of
cross-terms is equal to the product of ligand and protein
descriptors it may be unfeasible to calculate them
directly. E.g., having at hand 150 inhibitor and 1,320 zscale descriptors, computing cross-terms would result in
198,000 new variables, which would make any further
analysis highly resource consuming. A practical approach
is rather to compute the cross-terms from the principal
components of the original descriptors. For calculation of
cross-terms we here used all 37 PCs of the ligand descriptors, but only as many of PCs of kinase descriptors that
explained 95% of their total variance (this allowed us to
further reduce the size of the datasets by a factor of two).
Cross-terms were scaled to Pareto variance; the block
weight for cross-terms was initially set to 0 and thereafter
increased by a regular step size until an optimal PLS
model (according to inner loop cross-validation) was
obtained. We have earlier shown that this approach
exerts no negative influence on the final modelling results
[42].
Support vector machines (SVM)

SVM is a machine learning technique for classification
and regression that uses linear or non-linear kernel-func-

tions to project the data into a high-dimensional feature
space. Correlation is then performed in this hyperspace
based on the structural risk minimization principle; i.e.,
aiming to increase the generalization ability of a model
[43,44]. We induced non-linear proteochemometric
regression models using the epsilon-SVR method and
radial basis function kernel as implemented in the libSVM 2.88 software [45]. Five-fold inner-loop cross validation was performed to find optimal values for the width
of the kernel function γ and error penalty parameter C.
K-nearest neighbour method (k-NN)

The k-NN algorithm predicts y values for a test set object
as the average (or weighted average) of the y values of its k
nearest neighbours in the training-set. k-NN models were
induced using the Weka 3.6 software [46]. We characterized the similarity between inhibitor-kinase pairs from
the Euclidian distance in the X descriptor space and
applied 1/distance weighting, as described [47]. In contrast to PLS and SVM modelling, where the inhibitor and
kinase descriptor blocks were scaled to equal total variance, the relative scaling of the descriptor blocks was varied systematically in the k-NN modelling by multiplying
the block weight for kinase descriptors by factors 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, and 4; (in this way, kinase descriptors obtained
lower or higher importance than inhibitor descriptors in
assessing inhibitor-kinase complex similarity). Five-fold
inner-loop cross validation was applied to find the optimal scaling and number of nearest neighbours for prediction.
Decision trees

Decision trees were created using the M5P algorithm [48]
as implemented in Weka 3.6. This algorithm derives linear regression models at the terminal nodes (leaves) of
the tree. After building the tree, it was pruned and
smoothing was performed. The optimal value for the
minimum number of objects, allowing a new leaf, was
determined using five-fold inner-loop cross validation.
Double cross validation of kinase-inhibitor interaction
models

The predictive ability of models is commonly quantified
by the cross-validated squared correlation coefficient, Q2.
In cross-validation the objects are divided into a number
of groups. Models are then developed from the dataset,
which has been reduced by one of the groups, and predictions for the excluded objects are calculated. The process
is then iteratively repeated until all groups have been
omitted once. The Q2 is then calculated as:
N
2
∑ (y predicted , n − y measured , n )
2
n =1
Q =1−
N
2
∑ (y measured , n − y )
n =1

where y is the average of the measured outcome values
for the N objects in the dataset.
A Q2 > 0.4 is generally considered acceptable for modelling biological data [21]. However, some studies have
pointed out that Q2 may give an overly optimistic assessment of model performance in the case that the crossvalidation results are used to optimize model parameters
or to select the best among many alternative models
[49,50]. To remedy this we applied double cross-validation (also called double-loop or nested cross-validation)
[51] where the dataset was split into totally 25 parts. In
each round of inner cross-validation a model was built on
16/25 of the whole dataset and evaluated on 4/25 of it,
while the remaining data were put aside for the outer
loop. Once the inner loop cross-validation had found the
optimal model, its true performance was verified against
5/25 of data that had never been used during the optimization.
We wanted to evaluate the predictive ability for both
new kinase-inhibitor combinations and for new kinases
with no measured interaction data. In the former case
each part of randomly split dataset comprised about 1/25
of 12,046 kinase-inhibitor pairs and in the latter case it
comprised all data for approximately 1/25 of 317 kinases.
The squared correlation coefficients from the outer loop
of cross-validations for these two different selections are
in the following denoted as P2 and P2kin, respectively (letter P is used instead of Q as in previous studies [51] to
emphasize that these are unbiased performance estimates
based on external predictions).
