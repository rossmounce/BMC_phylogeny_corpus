Differential strengths of selection on S-RNases
from Physalis and Solanum (Solanaceae)
Timothy Paape1* and Joshua R Kohn2

Abstract
Background: The S-RNases of the Solanaceae are highly polymorphic self-incompatibility (S-) alleles subject to
strong balancing selection. Relatively recent diversification of S-alleles has occurred in the genus Physalis following
a historical restriction of S-allele diversity. In contrast, the genus Solanum did not undergo a restriction of S-locus
diversity and its S-alleles are generally much older. Because recovery from reduced S-locus diversity should involve
increased selection, we employ a statistical framework to ask whether S-locus selection intensities are higher in
Physalis than Solanum. Because different S-RNase lineages diversify in Physalis and Solanum, we also ask whether
different sites are under selection in different lineages.
Results: Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian coalescent methods found higher intensities of selection and more
sites under significant positive selection in the 48 Physalis S-RNase alleles than the 49 from Solanum. Highest
posterior densities of dN/dS (ω) estimates show that the strength of selection is greater for Physalis at 36 codons. A
nested maximum likelihood method was more conservative, but still found 16 sites with greater selection in
Physalis. Neither method found any codons under significantly greater selection in Solanum. A random effects
likelihood method that examines data from both taxa jointly confirmed higher selection intensities in Physalis, but
did not find different proportions of sites under selection in the two datasets. The greatest differences in strengths
of selection were found in the most variable regions of the S-RNases, as expected if these regions encode selfrecognition specificities. Clade-specific likelihood models indicated some codons were under greater selection in
background Solanum lineages than in specific lineages of Physalis implying that selection on sites may differ
among lineages.
Conclusions: Likelihood and Bayesian methods provide a statistical approach to testing differential selection across
populations or species. These tests appear robust to the levels of polymorphism found in diverse S-allele
collections subject to strong balancing selection. As predicted, the intensity of selection at the S-locus was higher
in the taxon with more recent S-locus diversification. This is the first confirmation by statistical test of differing
selection intensities among self-incompatibility alleles from different populations or species.

Background
Self-incompatibility (SI) polymorphisms are maintained
by balancing selection over long evolutionary time scales.
Selection continually favors rare alleles because they are
less frequently rejected as mates [1,2]. Shared ancestral
polymorphism is commonly observed as a result of
strong balancing selection with alleles from different

species and genera clustering together in phylogenetic
reconstructions [3-5]. This implies that S-alleles are often
much older than the species from which they are
sampled. Coalescence times of S-locus polymorphisms
are often estimated as a few tens of millions of years, far
longer than coalescence times of polymorphism at loci
not subject to balancing selection [6,7]. Sequence divergence at S-loci is also extreme, with stylar S-alleles often
differeing at 40% or more of their amino acids. This is
another sign of their great age, as well as the rarity of
recombination at known S-loci. Also of importance for

the current study, alleles undergoing diversification can
leave distinct signatures of positive selection among
amino acid sites across related taxa.
Richman et al. [3] detected a remarkable reduction in
the extent of shared ancestral polymorphism among
alleles from the S-RNase locus, which encodes the stylar
specificity component of the gametophytic SI system of
Solanaceae. In particular, Physalis crassifolia alleles,
while numerous, all belonged to just three trans-generic
lineages while alleles sampled from most other Solanaceae represented far more ancient lineages. Estimates of
historical effective population sizes of Solanum carolinense and P. crassifolia showed at least an order of magnitude decrease in Physalis relative to Solanum [3]. The
pattern found in P. crassifolia, in which all S-alleles
within the species represent only three ancient lineages,
is shared by other SI Physalis species and by SI members of the closely related genus Witheringia [7-14].
These findings have been interpreted as the result of a
historical restriction of S-locus diversity that occurred
approximately 15 MYA [7] in a common ancestor of
Physalis and Witheringia that is not shared with Solanum or other sampled genera of Solanceae [3,7,13].
Genealogical patterns suggest that Physalis S-RNase
alleles underwent rapid re-diversification following the
historical restriction at the S-locus [8,13,14]. Because
allele numbers in Physalis species are comparable to
those found among species of Solanum, it is thought that
post-bottleneck rediversification has returned allele numbers to equilibrium or nearly so [3]. This provides an
opportunity to examine patterns of selection on sets of
S-RNase alleles that have different evolutionary histories.
The more recently diversified S-alleles of Physalis might
be expected to show greater rates of non-synonymous
substitutions because of the increased strength of recent
diversifying selection [2]. The intensity of selection on
S-alleles is inversely proportional to their number. So
when the number of alleles is below equilibrium, as after
a severe bottleneck, selection intensity is predicted to be
higher than it is after equilibrium in allele number is
achieved [2]. The time frame over which a period of
heightened selection would be evident at the self-incompatibility locus is not known.
Here we compare selective regimes acting on the
S-RNase alleles drawn from species of Physalis and Solanum (Solanaceae). Positive selection has been estimated
among self-incompatibility alleles of several taxa using
various methods [13,15-19], most commonly the maximum likelihood phylogenetic approaches first proposed
by Nielsen and Yang [20] and more recently by coalescent-based methods described by Wilson and McVean
[21]. These methods use the ratio of non-synonymous
(dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions (ω) to
estimate patterns of selection at individual codons. In

this study, we investigate positive selection on amino
acids among S-RNases both within and across species of
Physalis and Solanum (Solanaceae). These polymorphic
S-alleles provide useful contrasts because diversification
at the S-locus in the different genera took place during
different time periods and among different S-allele
lineages.
Several previous studies [19,22,23] have utilized PAML
[20] to assess which codons within S-allele sequences
were subject to positive selection in different taxa. However, none of these studies have been able to statistically
determine how the strength and location of selection differs between groups of sequences. For instance, Castric
and Vekemens [19] compared patterns of selection
among several taxa at the S-receptor kinase (SRK) locus
which controls stylar recognition in the sporophytic SI
system found in Brassicaceae. Using PAML on separate
datasets from each taxon, a higher intensity of selection
(higher ω) was estimated among positively selected sites
in Brassica relative to those in two self-incompatible species of Arabidopsis. This was attributed to post-bottleneck diversification of SRK alleles in Brassica. However,
given the methods used, the statistical significance of the
difference in estimates of selection intensity could not be
evaluated.
PAML analyses [19] also found different sites under significant positive selection in different sets of S-alleles. It
was concluded, however, that this was poor evidence for
selection occurring on different sites. In their study [19],
the power to detect selection was shown to be low so nonoverlap in the codons found to be under selection in different datasets would be expected, even if selection acted
on the same sites in each set of alleles. Similarly, Vieira et
al. [22] looked at positive selection across S-RNases and
found evidence for different positively selected sites in
S-RNases from different families and sub-families of flowering plants. Again however, they did not employ a statistical framework capable of testing the significance of
differences in selective pressures acting on the same
codons in different taxa.
In this study we apply both phylogenetic maximum
likelihood and coalescent Bayesian methods, treating
S-allele alignments and phylogenies from species in each
genus either as a) distinct datasets compared using a series of nested maximum likelihood and Bayesian models
of selection or b) as a combined data set in which specific
clades of interest within single phylogenies are examined.
Our primary goal is to apply statistical frameworks using
formal hypothesis tests to answer the following questions:
1) Can we detect significant differences in the strength of
selection between genera? 2) Do the proportions of sites
under selection differ among genera? 3) Which sites
show significantly different selection intensities between
genera? 4) Are differences in the strength of selection

due to significantly higher dN or dS in one dataset relative to the other? 5) Do sites under selection differ
among S-allele lineages?

Results
A Bayesian consensus phylogeny of S-alleles from Physalis and Solanum is shown in Figure 1. The three
ancient Physalis lineages (clades A, B and C in Figure 1)

are consistent with previously published topologies
[7,11,14] that use S-alleles from more genera and illustrate re-diversification from within only those lineages.
No Solanum alleles are found within those lineages.
Estimates of average pairwise nucleotide diversity (π)
show synonymous divergence is greater for Solanum
while non-synonymous divergence is similar among the
genera (Table 1). A greater accumulation of synonymous

substitutions is expected for Solanum S-alleles if these
lineages are older than those of Physalis as suggested by
previous studies [3,7,13].
Do selection intensities or the proportion of sites under
selection differ among S-alleles from Solanum versus
Physalis?

A random effects likelihood (REL) approach [24,25] was
used to compare the distributions of non-synonymous
(dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) across genera
and found that they differed significantly in three of four
likelihood ratio tests (LRTs; Table 2). The alternative
hypothesis (HA) where dN and dS were free to vary had
the highest log-likelihood score (lnL = -16749.63). The
estimated dN/dS ratio for the positively selected class of
codons in Physalis alleles under this model was roughly
twice that estimated from Solanum alleles (Physalis dN/
dS 2.663, Solanum dN/dS 1.139, Table 1). The null
model (a) that constrains both datasets to have equivalent
dN/dS ratios for the class of sites under positive selection
is strongly rejected (p < 0.0001; df = 1) while the null
model (b) constraining the proportions of selected sites
across datasets was not rejected (p < 0.165; df = 1). This
test allows dN/dS ratios of selected sites from the two
genera to vary freely but enforces the proportions (p1 and
p2) in the positive selection class to be equal. The selective regime test (c), which constrains dN/dS ratios for the
positively selected sites and the proportion of selected
sites to be equal across both genera, was also strongly
rejected (p < 0.001; 1df). Rejection of this model is unlikely to be due to variation in proportions of selected sites
based on the results of (b) and appears largely the result
of differences in the strength of selection on positively
selected sites across datasets. The shared distributions
test (d) combines the joint distributions of dN and dS for
both datasets and was also found to have a significantly
lower likelihood (p < 0.001; 10 df) than HA which allows
for variation in rates in both datasets. See Methods for
full descriptions of each model. To summarize, the REL
approach found significantly greater intensity of selection
on positively selected sites in Physalis but no evidence
that the proportion of sites under selection differed
between genera.

Which sites show significant differences in strengths of
positive selection?

Because the REL approach used above does not indicate
which codons show different dN/dS ratios, subsequent
analyses were conducted to determine where along the SRNase sequence selection differs between genera. We first
estimated positive selection at individual codons using the
Nielsen and Yang [20] method implemented in PAML
v3.15. These results detected considerably more positively
selected codons in Physalis than Solanum as indicated by
posterior probabilities > 0.99 (Figure 2). Because we cannot determine whether the selective regime at these sites
differs significantly between datasets under the current framework of the maximum likelihood method implemented
in PAML, we employed a Bayesian coalescent method
described by Wilson and McVean [21] to compare highest
posterior densities (HPDs) for point estimates of ω (= dN/
dS). We first compared our results from OmegaMap with
the Nielsen and Yang M3 model for both datasets to
determine how similar were the estimates of which codons
were under positive selection. Posterior probability scores
show consistent trends across methods for each dataset
(Figure 2), though some sites have higher scores using M3
in Solanum. Most importantly, both methods identify
nearly all of the same sites under positive selection upon
which to estimate ω values. Wilson and McVean [21] suggested that inconsistencies between their coalescent
method results for estimating ω and those of codeml in
PAML could be the result of recombination. We did not
detect the presence of recombination in either dataset
using the likelihood permutation test described by
McVean et al. [26] (results not shown).
To compare selection intensities at specific sites across
genera, estimates of the mean and upper and lower highest
posterior densities (HPD’s) for ω from each dataset were
used to generate distributions from 500,000 MCMC iterations of the ratio of ω values from Physalis and Solanum
(Figure 3). Confidence intervals (HPD’s) that do not include
1 (dotted line in Figure 3) indicate that the codon specific
estimates of ω from each dataset (ωp and ωs for Physalis
and Solanum, respectively) are significantly different. The
HPDs of ωP/ωS ratios are more heavily concentrated in the
upper half of Figure 3 (above dashed lined) indicating that

Figure 3 Bayesian estimate of the ratio of omega values (ωP = Physalis dN/dS; ωS = Solanum dN dS) for each codon position. The gray
region is the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) and the solid line is the mean of the ratios. If the HPD crosses the value 1 (dashed line) then
the ratios are not significantly different. HPD’s above the line indicate a higher ω for Physalis than Solanum S-alleles.

(Figure 2). That is, we removed sites showing no strong evidence of being under positive selection in either genus. Of
the remaining sites, all but 3 had posterior scores ≥ 0.99 for
ω > 1. Thirty-six sites had significantly higher ωP/ωS ratios
and posterior probabilities ≥ 0.99 for Physalis (Figure 4). By
the same criteria, no sites showed significantly stronger
selection in Solanum relative to Physalis.
We also used a fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method
[27] to compare selective pressures (FEL-CSP) at individual sites across data sets. Like the Bayesian coalescent

method, we used independent phylogenies for each
genus, then statistically compared individual codons
across taxa under a hypothesis testing scheme (see Methods). This method also finds several codons in Physalis
that are under significantly greater positive selection than
Solanum as shown by contrasts of mean dN/dS values at
these particular sites (Figure 5). FEL-CSP identified fewer
differentially selected sites than the Bayesian method
with 16 sites predicted to be differentially selected at the
p ≤ 0.05 level and one site with p = 0.08. All but six of

probability scores > 0.95 for both PAML and OmegaMap. For all sites, Physalis had higher estimated dN/dS ratios.

these sites were also identified by the coalescent method
(Table 3). Because this method does not utilize rate distributions across sites, it is sensitive to the number of
taxa present in each dataset [28]. We performed a power
analysis to determine whether p-values ≤ 0.05 were sensitive to potential type II errors for the FEL analysis. We
found that that the power to detect positively selected
sites for Physalis is only 39.4%, and 34% for Solanum at p
= 0.05. However, the false positive rate for sites predicted
under this method is also low, 4.3% and 4.9% for Physalis
and Solanum respectively. This means that when a site is
predicted to be under selection, accuracy of this prediction is expected to be ≥ 95%.
Do different S-allele lineages experience greater selection
intensities?

To test whether a branch or clade model fits the data better than models with all lineages combined within a

phylogeny [25] we set Physalis clades A and C against a
background phylogeny of all Solanum alleles and the
alternative clade (either A or C, depending on which was
the test clade). This test also uses the REL framework
(see Methods). Physalis Clade A had a significantly
higher dN/dS ratio (dN/dS Phys Clade A = 2.19; CI =
2.03, 2.36) than all background lineages (Solanum plus
Physalis clade C, dN/dS = 0.70; CI = 0.73, 0.77; Table 4).
The branch extending to Physalis Clade A had the greatest dN/dS estimate (Physalis Clade A Branch dN/dS =
5.18; CI = 1.64, 10.49) but models where this branch was
included either as part of the background or as part of
Clade A did not provide a statistically worse fit than
models in which the dN/dS ratio for this branch was estimated independently (Table 4). Likelihood ratio tests and
AIC scores show that models with Physalis Clade A specific selection provide a better fit to the data (Models 3, 4

Bold indicates sites predicted to be under stronger selection in Physalis than in Solanum by both ωp/ωs and FEL CSP tests. FEL-Clade tests comparing clades A

global estimate of dN/dS. The same procedure was conducted for Physalis clade C and also found significantly
increased selection relative to background lineages. For
clade C the estimated dN/dS ratio (1.33; CI = 1.17, 1.51)
is lower than estimated for clade A and the best fit model
does not include its subtending branch (results not
shown). Phyalis clade B was ignored in this and the following analysis because it contains too few sequences to
be informative.
Do selected sites differ among lineages?

It is possible that diversification of different specificities
occurs by changes at different sites in different lineages.
Using clade-specific FEL (FEL-Clade) based variations of
branch models [29,30], we removed the other major
Physalis clade (A or C from Figure 1) to determine
whether each Physalis clade exhibits different selected
codons relative to the many background lineages from
Solanum. This test finds 18 codons that have significantly greater dN/dS for Clade A, while 14 show significantly higher selection intensites in Solanum than in
Physalis clade A (Figure 6, Table 3). For Physalis Clade
C (Figure 6, Table 3), 10 sites show higher dN/dS than
in the background lineages from Solanum while seven
codons are subject to more intense selection in the
background lineages than this clade. Sites indicated to
be under differential selection in each clade-specific analysis are mostly different (Table 3). The majority of sites
found to be under higher levels of positive selection in
Solanum are in hypervariable regions a and b while sites
under greater positive selection in Physalis clades A and
C are often outside these regions.

What causes higher dN/dS ratios in Physalis?

Higher estimated dN/dS ratios in Physalis could result
from increased fixation of non-synonymous substitutions
in Physalis because of increased selection, or from fixation of more synonymous changes in the S-alleles of
Solanum because they are generally older. In order to
determine the cause of the difference in estimated selection intensities we used PAML to estimate dN and dS for
all terminal branches leading to P. longifolia and S. chilense alleles, the species which posess the largest S-RNase
samples within each genus. Linear regression analysis
shows that the Y-intercept (the value of dN when dS = 0)
is not different for the two genera (P. longifolia: y-intercept = 0.097, (S.E. 0.003); S. chilense: y-intercept = 0.1, (S.
E. 0.005)). Apparently, dN = approximately 0.1 is the
minimum average divergence among alleles of either
genus when synonymous divergence is zero. However, as
dS increases, P. longifolia alleles show significantly higher
accumulation of non-synonymous substitutions as the
slopes of the regressions (Figure 7) are significantly different (P. longifolia = 0.77 (S.E.0.08); S. chilense 0.42 (S.E.
0.03). For equivalent levels of synonymous divergence,
P. longifolia alleles have accumulated nearly twice the
number of non-synonymous changes as have alleles from
S. chilense. Quadratic terms are not significant in either
genus. Results are nearly identical when all Physalis and
Solanum alleles are used (not shown).

Discussion
When allele numbers at the S-locus are below equilibrium, as after recovery from a demographic restriction,
selection favoring new alleles is expected to increase [2].

We have used a series of statistical methods to determine
if the intensity of selection acting on S-RNases differed
among taxa and lineages, and whether the number and
positions of sites under selection differed. As indicated by
the distributions of dN and dS along the entire S-RNase
gene in the initial REL models (Table 2), there is a significantly greater dN/dS ratio in Physalis. This method is
similar to PAML models that begin by categorizing dN
and dS rates into discrete distributions, but with the
added use of a framework of nested models that compare
those rates across two taxa with homologous polymorphism. Subsequent likelihood (PAML) and coalescent

(OmegaMap) analyses found more sites under significant
positive selection in Physalis rendering the second result
of the REL analysis somewhat surprising: that no significant difference in the proportion of sites under selection
was detected. The REL method may be less sensitive in
detecting differences in local processes than in overall
selective pressure, but the main difference we can confirm between the genera is in the intensity of selection
rather than the proportion of sites subject to it.
We used a novel adaptation of OmegaMap [21] to
determine which codons are subject to stronger selection
in one genus versus the other. The Markov chain process

of the Bayesian method produces a distribution of ω
values around a mean for each codon that allows one to
establish upper and lower 95% confidence intervals. This
feature of Bayesian statistics makes this method useful
for hypothesis tests regarding dN/dS ratios across taxa,
something that is not possible using existing maximum
likelihood methods such as PAML. These tests found 36
codons under significantly higher selection in Physalis.
We also used an alternative fixed effects maximum likelihood method to compare selective pressures (FEL-CSP)
using likelihood ratio tests for increased dN/dS in one
genus relative to the other. This method detected roughly
half as many sites under differential selection as the Bayesian method, suggesting that either the Bayesian
approach is prone to high false positive rates or that the
FEL-CSP method has reduced power. Based on our
power analysis, we suspect the latter as the Bayesian
method appears to perform similarly to a REL method (i.
e. PAML). Previous simulations [28] comparing both
REL and FEL methods on individual datasets showed
that FEL is less powerful when the number of sequences
is below 64 as are each of our datasets.
As expected, both the Bayesian and FEL-CSP methods
predict that the greatest differences in the magnitudes
of positive selection on individual codons occur in the
previously identified hyper-variable regions HVa and
HVb [31]. The hyper-variable regions are thought to
play a major role in determining specificity [31-36]. For
example, Matton et al. [35] demonstrated alteration of
specificity using mutagenesis experiments involving
these hypervariable regions. These studies showed that
as few as 4 amino acid changes in corresponding positions of the S11 and S13 S-RNases of S. chacoense could
alter specificity to that of the alternative allele. However,
entire domain swapping in studies [32,33] using SRNases of Petunia inflata and Nicotiana alata, suggest
that while HVa and HVb are important, other regions
are also likely involved in recognition at least in some
alleles or lineages. Consistent with this idea, both
codon-based methods used here also show considerable
differential selection in the V2 region near the 3’ end of
the S-RNases, supporting previous analyses of both
Lycium [16,23] and Solanum chilense [12] S-RNases
which also found evidence of selection in this region.
The genealogy of S-alleles from Physalis suggests that
extant S-RNases evolved from only 3 lineages, giving
rise to the expectation of strong selection within each of
these three clades. Indeed, Physalis clade A shows the
highest dN/dS as expected during early strong selection
on a reduced number of S-alleles. These results suggest
that the clade model captures increased post-bottleneck
diversifying selection intensities. Clade C also shows
increased selection pressure relative to background
lineages while clade B contains too few alleles for testing

Page 12 of 16

by this method. This test confirms the findings of the
REL test but on isolated foreground lineages and shows
that selection is generally stronger in each re-diversified
clade relative to average selection estimated for background lineages.
All methods used found higher dN/dS ratios in Physalis, as expected following a severe reduction in S-allele
numbers. However, due to saturation, dN may be more
severely underestimated in long branches potentially
leading to reduced estimates of dN/dS ratios [19].
Because its alleles are generally older, this could providing a potential alternative to greater selection for lower
dN/dS estimates from Solanum. We therefore estimated
dN and dS at terminal branches for the two species
with the most alleles (P. longifolia and S. chilense) to a)
estimate dN and dS in the absence of interspecific
branch lengths, b) gain insight into non-synonymous
substitution rates of similarly aged S-alleles, and c) estimate recent selection by ignoring internal branches. For
alleles separated by equivalent amounts of synonyomous
change, Physalis alleles have accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at about twice the rate for Solanum
(Figure 7). Evidence for increased dN/dS ratios is apparent even at relatively low levels of divergence (dN and
dS < 0.15). This is strong evidence that saturation of
non-synonyous substitutions is not the cause of higher
inferred intensity of selection in Physalis.
In comparison to tests for increases in selection across
the gene or at specific codons, methods for testing
whether the same or different codons are under selection in different groups or lineages are considerably less
well developed. The FEL-Clade models returned the
only evidence suggesting that sites under positive selection in a particular clade might be under neutral or purifying selection in the background phylogeny (Figure 6
and Table 3). FEL-Clade analyses also showed mostly
different sites under selection across the two main Physalis clades examined (A and C; Table 3). Finding different sites under selection in different clades might
indicate that different residues contribute to specificity
differentiation in different groups of alleles. However,
this finding could also reflect low power to detect selection, given the reduced sample sizes represented within
each clade. With low power, the expected overlap in
sites predicted to be under selection would also be low
[19].
The FEL-Clade models also indicated several sites
where the strength of positive selection in Solanum was
greater than in the contrasted clade (A or C) from Physalis. This is in contrast to other methods explored here
where all significant differences in the strength of positive selection at specific sites showed increased selection
intensity in Physalis. If clades differ in sites subject to
positive selection, analyses combining all Physalis clades

Paape and Kohn BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/243

might mask these effects while the FEL-Clade method
may expose these differences.

Conclusions
Several methods detected increased selection intensities
acting on the alleles from Physalis when compared to
those from Solanum, consistent with recovery from a
historical restriction in S-locus diversity in Physalis.
However, another question, whether the same or different residues were under selection in alleles from the
two sources was more difficult to answer. The REL
method did not detect a higher proportion of sites
under selection in Physalis and the method cannot
detect whether selection acts on the same or different
codons. Other methods found more sites under significant positive selection and higher selection intensities
acting on selected sites in Physalis, but both may result
from increased selection intensities rather than differences in sites subject to positive selection. The FEL
clade-specific approach provided some evidence that different sites were under selection in specified Physalis
clades than across the background Solanum alleles but
the assumption of this test, that selection on the background clade is uniform, may not hold and these results
should be treated cautiously. While the methods
explored here for testing differential strengths of selection across a gene or at specific codons appear adequate,
further development of statistical methods for testing
whether the same or different sites are under selection
is needed.
Methods
Sequences and Phylogeny Construction

Amino acid and nucleotide S-RNase sequences were
obtained from GenBank for 12 Physalis cinerascens, 36
P. longifolia, 17 Solanum carolinense, 32 S. chilense and
one Antirrhinum hispanicum (Ahis5) allele used as an
outgroup sequence. Automated alignment of the complete dataset containing all S-alleles was performed using
ClustalX [37] and manually adjusted using Se-Al v2.0
[38]. A nucleotide alignment was matched with corresponding amino acids to produce a codon alignment
using PAL2NAL [39] that resulted in 131 codons. A phylogeny of all S-alleles (n = 98) was created using Mr.
Bayes v3.1 [40] to generate a 50% majority consensus
topology. The analysis was run under a GTR+ Г + I substitution model for 1,000,000 generations, sampling every
100 th tree for a total of 10,000 trees. The initial 2501
trees were discarded as the burn-in phase. The remaining
trees represent generations on which posterior probabilities were calculated.
Separate datasets were compiled for each genus: one
that contained 48 Physalis and the other with 49 Solanum S-alleles. Corresponding topologies for each dataset

Page 13 of 16

were pruned from the Bayesian consensus tree using
TreeEdit v1.0a10 [41] to maintain genealogical relationships found when all taxa’s alleles were included. The
use of 2 species from each genus simply enlarges each
dataset as the genealogical patterns exhibited for congeners are shared because of trans-specific polymorphism.
The same tree topology for each dataset was used in all
subsequent selection analyses that utilize phylogenies
unless otherwise stated. A general time reversible (GTR)
model of nucleotide substitution is used for all subsequent phylogenetic selection analyses so that direct
comparisons can be made across models and datasets.
Pairwise nucleotide divergence π was estimated for
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions for all
taxa using DNASP 4.0 [42]. Sequence alignments, Newick string tree topologies and HYPHY likelihood functions for Physalis and Solanum datasets can be found as
Nexus files in online Supplementary data.
Distribution of dN and dS Rates

The most general test of the relative strength of selection across two datasets compares the distribution of
synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates
using a random effects likelihood (REL) approach [24]
implemented in the program HYPHY [25]. This consists
of several nested models for hypothesis testing, similar
to the likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) described by Nielsen
and Yang [20] and implemented in PAML [43], that
begin by estimating general discrete distributions of four
rate classes for each dataset. Rate classes are as follows:
two bins for negative selection where dS1 > dN1 and dS2
> dN 2; one for neutral evolution dS3 = dN3 ; and one
for positive selection dS4 < dN4.
Null hypotheses comparing both datasets are as follows: a) H0: dN4p/dS4p = dN4s /dS4s for the same strength
of selection where subscripts indicate bin 4 (dN4 > dS4)
and Physalis ’p’ or Solanum ’s’, b) H0: p4p = p4s for the
same proportion of positively selected sites, c) the same
selective regime which combines both a) and b) (H 0 :
dN4p/dS4p = dN4s /dS4s and p4p = p4s), and finally d) H0:
rates derived from the combined dataset equal to rates
estimated for each taxon separately. An independent distribution model of rates that are free to vary for both
datasets is set as the alternative hypothesis against which
the null model likelihoods (a, b, c and d) are tested. Models are rejected by -2ΔlnL (ΔlnL = the difference in log
likelihoods of the two models) where significance is
determined by c2 distribution with the degrees of freedom (df) equal to the difference in the number of parameters between models.
Codon Selection Estimates

To estimate the ratio (ω) of non-synonymous (dN ) to
synonymous (dS) substitutions at individual amino acid

Paape and Kohn BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/243

sites we first used the program codeml in PAML 3.15
[44]. Values of ω < 1 for individual codons indicates
purifying selection while sites with ω = 1 are considered
neutral. Positive selection at the amino acid level is predicted when ω > 1. A series of nested neutral and selection models first developed by Nielsen and Yang [18]
use likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to determine the model
that best fits the data. The null model M1 (neutral) constrains all sites to be either of class ω = 0 or ω = 1 while
the alternative model M2a (selection) adds a third class
in which ω > 1 at individual sites. Model M3 (selection)
assumes three discrete site classes (ω0 , ω1, and ω2) with
three corresponding proportions (p0, p1, p2) estimated
from the data. Models are then compared and rejected
by likelihood ratio tests as described in the section
above. Sites estimated to be under positive selection are
determined by an empirical Bayes approach [44] where
posterior probabilities are estimated from rates within
each site class. Because we are primarily concerned with
comparing posterior probabilities from the robust general discrete (M3) model with a subsequent coalescent
analysis, we forgo full analyses including models with
more complex rate distributions (i.e. M7 and M8).
The Bayesian coalescent method was conducted using
OmegaMap v0.5 [21] which implements a population
genetics likelihood approximation to the coalescent to
infer recombination and estimate ω. The model of base
substitution including transition/transversion rates
among codons was adopted from Nielsen and Yang [20].
Rather than using a maximum likelihood approach to
estimate the selection parameter, OmegaMap employs a
Bayesian method with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) process to estimate posterior distributions of
parameters. This allows the use of posterior densities of
ω to investigate whether dN/dS is greater at any particular codon in one dataset versus the other without the
need for nested models. This can only be done if datasets
are the same length, encode for homologous genes, and
have reliable alignments of codon positions. By sampling
from the distribution of ω values we are able to determine the ratio of ω estimated from Physalis relative to
Solanum. Rejection of the null hypothesis that sites have
equivalent ω values is observed when the 95% posterior
density of ratios exclude 1 (H0: w1HPD w2HPD = 1).
Rather than estimating ω for each dataset using a variable model along pre-defined blocks of adjacent codons,
we assumed an independent model for each site with an
improper inverse distribution of rates. The MCMC
chain was iterated over 500,000 generations sampling
every 100 th generation. We ran each dataset twice to
check for convergence and removed a burn in of 50,000
generations using R http://www.r-project.org/. The
chain generates upper and lower posterior densities
(highest posterior density HPD) to determine mean

Page 14 of 16

point estimates of ω at each codon position for each
dataset. Because the independent model is computationally intensive, we ran the OmegaMap analyses using the
Cornell BioHPC server http://cbsuapps.tc.cornell.edu/
omegamap.aspx. The upper and lower HPD of ω values
from each dataset were then combined and re-sampled
after a burn in of 25,000 generations to get HPD’s and
the geometric mean for the ratio of ω’s using R.
FEL-CSP (Fixed Effects Likelihood-Compare Selective
Pressures)

We also used a fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) method to
infer differential selection at individual sites among datasets [25]. FEL differs from the REL type models of PAML
and the coalescent method of OmegaMap in that dN and
dS are estimated at individual sites directly rather than
using pre-defined distributions of rates [24]. Alignments of
each dataset were first used to estimate global parameters
such as nucleotide frequencies, topology, and branch
lengths. We use separate trees for each dataset (rather
than a single phylogeny including both genera). These
parameters were then fixed throughout the selection estimate procedure. The null model H0: dN1/dS1 = dN2/dS2
and alternative model HA: where dS1, dN1, dS2, dN2 are
free to vary are fitted to every codon and, because they are
nested, likelihood ratio tests can be used to determine significantly different selection pressures on individual sites.
We estimated selection using the CompareSelectivePressure batch file in HYPHY v0.99. Actual dN/dS values for
each dataset were then checked for any potential false
positive estimates of differential positive selection. Here it
is possible for the model to reject the null hypothesis that
dN/dS ratios are equivalent across datasets but codons
may not actually have ω estimates > 1.
We conducted simulations for Physalis and Solanum
datasets independently to determine the power of the
FEL test for given p-values. We simulated 100 replicates
of each dataset and corresponding phylogeny using the
site-by-site rate estimates from the FEL method with
25% of sites evolving neutrally. This produced 13100
sites with non-zero rates (131 codons × 100 replicates)
to estimate false positive rates over bins of p-values of
width 0.01. The power analysis was conducted using a
batch command program in the HYPHY v0.99 package.
Lineage-specific selection pressures

A phylogeny of Physalis and Solanum compartmentalized
into all Solanum lineages versus Physalis clade A and its
subtending branch was used to determine equality of dN/
dS between them. Physalis clade A represents the largest
re-diversification among Physalis S-alleles, and this
method compares rate estimates for one specified clade
against those for a background phylogeny. The HKY85
model of nucleotide substitution was used along with

Paape and Kohn BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/243

phylogenies containing all Solanum S-RNases (49) and
the S-RNases found within clade A (Figure 1). Comparison among five models using LRT’s are as follows: Model
1) allows one global dN/dS value, Model 2) constrains
the specified subclade and background dN/dS values to
be equal but adds a new parameter for dN/dS along the
branch leading to the clade. Model 3) constrains dN/dS
values of the specified clade and its subtending branch to
be equal but allows background branches to have a distinct dN/dS value. Model 4) constrains background
branch’s dN/dS and the subtending branch to be equal
while the clade is allowed to vary, and Model 5) allows all
compartments (specified clade, its subtending branch,
and background branches) to have dN/dS values free to
vary. Log likelihood scores were used to determine best
fit models and Akaike information criterion (AIC) values
were used to adjust for differences in parameters among
likelihood ratio tests [25]. The process was then repeated
with Physalis clade C compared to background lineages
from Solanum. Phyalis clade B contains too few alleles
for useful analysis by this method.
FEL-Clade Test (subtree selection comparison)

To ask whether different codons were under selection in
different lineages we used a FEL approach comparing
the selection on individual codons in background
lineages with that on a particular Physalis clade (A or
C). In this case the alternative Physalis clade (A or C)
was included as part of the background phylogeny. For
the class of codons with dN/dS > 1, the null model H0
has 3 rate classes for each codon: dN for the background lineages = dN for the Physalis clade of interest,
dS background lineages = dS Physalis clade of interest,
dN/dS background lineages = dN/dS Physalis clade of
interest. The alternative hypothesis H A : has one rate
class for dN for all background lineages, another dN
rate class for Physalis clade being compaired, a single dS
rate for all lineages, and one dN/dS for all background
lineages, and another dN/dS > 1 ratio for the Physalis
clade of interest. Likelihood ratio tests are conducted for
each codon position where significance is determined at
the p ≤ 0.05 level.
