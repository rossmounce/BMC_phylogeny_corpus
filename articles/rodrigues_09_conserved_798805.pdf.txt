Abstract
Background: The shikimate pathway is an attractive target for the development of antitubercular
agents because it is essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, but
absent in humans. M. tuberculosis aroE-encoded shikimate dehydrogenase catalyzes the forth
reaction in the shikimate pathway. Structural and functional studies indicate that Lysine69 may be
involved in catalysis and/or substrate binding in M. tuberculosis shikimate dehydrogenase.
Investigation of the kinetic properties of mutant enzymes can bring important insights about the
role of amino acid residues for M. tuberculosis shikimate dehydrogenase.
Findings: We have performed site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetics, equilibrium
binding measurements and molecular modeling for both the wild-type M. tuberculosis shikimate
dehydrogenase and the K69A mutant enzymes. The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for
the M. tuberculosis shikimate dehydrogenase were determined; the catalytic constant value for the
wild-type enzyme (50 s-1) is 68-fold larger than that for the mutant K69A (0.73 s-1). There was a
modest increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant for DHS (K69A = 76 μM; wild-type = 29 μM)
and NADPH (K69A = 30 μM; wild-type = 11 μM). The equilibrium dissociation constants for wildtype and K69A mutant enzymes are 32 (± 4) μM and 134 (± 21), respectively.
Conclusion: Our results show that the residue Lysine69 plays a catalytic role and is not involved
in substrate binding for the M. tuberculosis shikimate dehydrogenase. These efforts on M. tuberculosis
shikimate dehydrogenase catalytic mechanism determination should help the rational design of
specific inhibitors, aiming at the development of antitubercular drugs.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health
concern. It has been estimated that one-third of the
world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, and that 30 million
people died from this disease in the last decade [1]. The

epidemic of the human immunodeficiency virus, the
increase in the homeless population, and the decline in
health care structures and national surveillance are
contributing factors to TB resurgence. Inappropriate
treatment regimens and patient noncompliance in
completing the therapies are associated with the

emergence of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), defined
as strains of M. tuberculosis resistant to at least isoniazid
and rifampicin, two pivotal drugs used in the standard
treatment of TB [2]. It has been reported the emergence
of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases, defined as
cases in persons with TB whose isolates are MDR as well
as resistant to any one of the fluoroquinolone drugs and
to at least one of the three injectable second-line drugs
[3]. XDR-TB is widespread raising the prospect of
virtually incurable TB worldwide [3]. There is thus an
urgent need for new drugs to improve the treatment of
MDR- and XDR-TB, and to provide more effective drugs
to shorten the duration of TB treatment. Enzyme
inhibitors make up roughly 25% of the drugs marketed
[4], and are thus important promising drug targets.
The shikimate pathway is an attractive target for the
development of herbicides and antimicrobial agents
because it is essential in algae, higher plants, bacteria,
and fungi, but absent from mammals [5]. The mycobacterial shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthesis of
precursors of aromatic amino acids, naphthoquinones,
menaquinones, and mycobactins [6], and is essential for
M. tuberculosis viability [7]. Shikimate dehydrogenase
(SD; EC 1.1.1.25), the fourth enzyme of this pathway,
catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate (DHS) to shikimate (SHK, Fig. 1). We have
previously reported production, characterization, and
determination of kinetic and chemical mechanisms of
aroE-encoded SD from M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain
(MtbSD) [8-10]. Multiple sequence alignment, comparative homology modeling, and pH-rate profiles suggested
that the Lysine69 in the DHS/SHK binding site of MtbSD
plays a role in substrate binding and/or catalysis [10,11].
Here we describe site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state
kinetics, fluorimetric measurements and structural analyses to probe the role of Lys69 in MtbSD and provide
insight into the molecular basis of DHS/SHK recognition
and/or catalysis.

Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
A previously constructed pET-23a(+)::aroE recombinant
vector [8] was used as a template for PCR-based

mutagenesis using the Quick Change site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The synthetic
oligonucleotides employed were as follows: 5’ggtgtttcggtgaccatgccgggcgcgttcgccgccctgcggttcg-3’
(forward) and 5’-cgaaccgcagggcggcgaacgcgcccggcatggtcaccgaaacacc-3’ (reverse) (in bold is the codon for
alanine). PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase and standard
PCR amplification program were employed. The PCR
product was treated with DpnI endonuclease that
specifically digests the methylated DNA template, and
selects for the mutation-containing synthesized DNA.
Expression, release and purification of recombinant
MtbSD
The recombinant plasmid was introduced into E. coli
C41 (DE3) host cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) by
electroporation. Single colonies were used to inoculate
2 L of LB medium containing 50 μg mL-1 ampicillin, and
1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added
to cultures reaching an OD600 of 0.4 - 0.6, and grown for
24 h at 37°C at 180 rpm. Cells (5 g) were harvested by
centrifugation at 14,900 g for 30 min at 4°C, and stored
at -20°C. The freeze-thaw method was used to release
the proteins in the soluble fraction [8]. The purification
protocol was as previously described [12]. Samples of
the purification steps were analyzed by SDS-PAGE [13]
and protein content by the Bradford’s method [14].
Enzyme activity assays and determination of kinetic
parameters
Steady-state kinetics measurements of homogeneous
MtbSD K69A mutant activity were carried out for the
forward direction at 25°C in 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, by monitoring the decrease
in absorbance at 340 nm (ε = 6220 M-1 cm-1 for
NADPH) accompanying the conversion of NADPH and
DHS to NADP+ and SHK. The K69A activity was measured
at varying final concentrations of DHS (20-300 μM) and
NADPH at constant saturating level (200 μM); and
varying NADPH concentrations (20-250 μM) and DHS
at constant saturating level (250 μM; Fig. 2B and 2D). The
wild-type SD activity was measured at various DHS
concentrations (10-100 μM) and NADPH at constant
saturating level (200 μM); and various NADPH concentrations (5-50 μM) and DHS at constant saturating level
(250 μM; Fig. 2A and 2C). All measurements were in
duplicate. Steady-state kinetic constants were obtained by
non-linear regression analysis of the kinetic data fitted to
the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = Vmax × [S]/Km + [S])
using the SigmaPlot software (SPSS, Inc).
Fluorescence spectroscopy
Fluorescence titration was performed in a Shimadzu
spectrofluorophotometer RF-5301PC at 25°C by making

microliter additions of DHS substrate stock solutions to
2 mL of 1 μM of MtbSD in 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer pH 7.3. The binding of DHS to MtbSD causes a
quench in the intrinsic protein fluorescence (lexc = 300 nm;
310 ≤ lem ≤ 450 nm; maximum lem at 340 nm), which
allowed monitoring of MtbSD-DHS binary complex formation at equilibrium. To assess the DHS inner-filter effect in
the fluorimeter, two cuvettes were placed in series so that
the contents of the first cuvette acted as a filter of the
excitation light and the light emitted from the second
cuvette detected. DHS was added to the first cuvette, while
the second cuvette contained the protein. In this manner,
DHS inner-filter effect on protein fluorescence could be
assessed. The results were plotted to a rectangular hyperbola
by using the nonlinear regression function of SigmaPlot
2004 (SPSS, Inc.).

MtbSD K69A structural analysis
The wild-type MtbSD three-dimensional (3D) model was
built previously by comparative homology modeling
using Escherichia coli SD as template (PDB ID: 1NYT)
[10], however, a more recent 3D structure for Thermus
thermophilus SD (PDB ID: 2EV9), solved by X-ray
crystallography at 1.90 Å in complex with shikimate
[15], was used as a template for MtbSD K69A mutant
modeling, as well as to evaluate DHS/SHK substrate
binding mode to MtbSD. T. thermophilus SD shows higher
primary structure identity to MtbSD (~30% identity and
13% strong similarity) than E. coli SD (26% identity and
15% strong similarity), and the presence of both
enzyme’s cofactor and substrate bound at its active site
makes such structure a more suitable template for MtbSD
comparative homology modeling.

Target and template pair-wise sequence alignment required
small gaps inclusion on both M. tuberculosis and
T. thermophilus SD primary sequences. MtbSD K69A model
was built by restrained-based homology modeling implemented in MODELLER9v1 [16], with the standard protocol
of the comparative protein structure modeling methodology, by satisfaction of spatial restrains [17,18]. Atomic
coordinates of SHK heteroatoms were copied from template
structure into the MtbSD K69A model. The best model was
selected according to MODELLER objective function [19]
and subjected to energy minimization for amino acid side
chain and main chain rearrangements with GROMACS
package [20] using the 43a1 force-field. The system was
submitted to an initial steepest descent energy minimization in vacuo with a maximum number of 400 minimization
steps, followed by a maximum of 3000 steps of conjugate
gradient energy minimization.
The program PROCHECK and VERIFY 3D were employed
to, respectively, analyze stereochemical quality and validate
the 3D profile of the model, as previously described [10].
Structural correspondence between MtbSD K69A model and
T. thermophilus was evaluated by their root-mean square
deviation (RMSD). H-bond interactions were evaluated
with LIGPLOT v4.4.2 [21], considering an atomic distance
cut off of 3.9 Å (program default values).

Findings and Discussion
Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression and
purification
Total sequencing of aroE mutant DNA into pET-23a(+)
vector confirmed that the mutation was introduced into the
expected site and that no unwanted mutations were
introduced by the PCR amplification step. The recombinant
MtbSD protein purification protocol resulted in a protein
yield of 13%, according to the previous protocol [12].
Steady-state kinetic parameters
The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for K69A
(Fig. 2B and 2D) and wild-type MtbSD (Fig. 2A and 2C)
are given in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the catalytic
constant (kcat) value for wild-type MtbSD (50 s-1) is 68fold larger than K69A (0.73 s-1), whereas there was
a modest increase in the Km values for DHS (K69A =
76 μM; wild-type MtbSD = 29 μM) and NADPH (K69A =
30 μM; wild-type MtbSD = 11 μM). The apparent secondorder rate constant (kcat/Km) values for DHS (K69A =
9.6 × 103 M-1s-1; wild-type MtbSD = 1.7 × 106 M-1s-1) and
NADPH (K69A = 24 × 103 M-1s-1; wild-type MtbSD =
4.5 × 106 M-1s-1) indicate that the mutant has a lower
specificity constant for both substrates. A comparison of
kcat/Km values is an appropriate method to assess the
effect(s) of a mutation on substrate(s) binding and
catalysis since it includes the activation energies and the

binding energies [22]. A change of 12.8 kJ mol-1 can be
calculated when we compare the values of kcat/Km of
DHS reduction for wild-type and K69A MtbSD. These
results indicate that the conserved Lys69 residue in
MtbSD plays a critical role in catalysis, but plays no role
in substrate binding. Moreover, the fact that the K69A
MtbSD mutant protein still binds DHS and NADPH with
only slightly larger Km values as compared to wild-type
enzyme indicates that the mutant protein is properly
folded giving more confidence that the results are not an
artifact generated by the mutation. Linearity of each
measurement and dose dependence when adding different volumes of the enzyme solution were confirmed for
all enzyme activity assays (data not shown).
Equilibrium binding
Spectrofluorimetric assays were carried out to determine
the equilibrium dissociation constant for MtbSD-DHS
binary complex formation (Fig. 3). The change in the
intrinsic protein fluorescence at varying DHS concentrations (2-450 μM) yielded equilibrium dissociation
constant (Kd) values of 32 (± 4) μM for wild-type
MtbSD and 134 (± 21) μM for K69A mutant (Table 1).
Interestingly, measurements of changes in nucleotide
fluorescence upon NADPH binding to wild-type MtbSD
(lexc = 370 nm; 380 ≤ lem ≤ 600 nm; maximum lem at
445 nm) did not show any saturation, which indicates a
very large Kd value. This is consistent with a steady-state
ordered bi-bi mechanism with DHS binding first
followed by NADPH binding to MtbSD active site [10].
Moreover, these experiments confirmed our proposal
that the Lys69 residue plays a minor role, if any, in
substrate binding.
Structural analysis
Two crystallographic structures of SD in complex with
both its coenzyme and SHK (Aquifex aeolicus, PDB ID:
2HK9[23] and T. thermophilus, PDB ID: 2EV9[15], solved
by X-ray diffraction at 2.20 Å and 1.90 Å resolution,
respectively) are available in the Protein Data Bank

(PDB). T. thermophilus SD structure was chosen as
template for comparative homology modeling of
MtbSD K69A and for SHK binding analysis because of
larger primary sequence identity to MtbSD (~30%
identity and 13% strong similarity) as compared to
A. aeolicus (24% identity and 16% strong similarity), and
lower requirement for inclusion of gaps in primary
sequence comparisons.
Analysis of the 3D structures of SDs in complex with
NADP+ and SHK suggest that Lys64 in T. termophilus [15]
and Lys70 in A. aeolicus [23] interact with C3 of DHS and
act as an acid-base catalytic group. Corresponding Lys
residue is also suggested to be catalytically active in
Staphylococcus epidermidis [24], Haemophilus influenzae
[25] and Arabidopsis thaliana [26] SDs.
No significant changes were observed on protein’s
overall tertiary structure and in DHS/SHK binding site
after energy minimization of the MtbSD K69A model.
The RMSD deviation from template of only 0.55 Å, 99%
of amino acids within allowed regions of the Ramachandran’s plots and PROCHECK parameters indicate that
the K69A model satisfies all stereochemical requirements. Considering only substrate binding site amino
acids, MtbSD K69A RMSD values reduced to 0.12 Å when
compared to template. Such minor structural variations
indicate a strong conservation of the amino acid
arrangement at the enzyme’s substrate binding site, not
only at their a-carbon position but also in regard to their
c rotational angles, where only MtbSD residue Ser20
(Ser16 on template) shows variation on its rotational

rearrangements were observed for MtbSD K69A. Not
surprisingly, the noticeable change is the loss of two Hbonds with the SHK molecule in K69A mutant. It could
be argued that the loss of two H-bonds in K69A MtbSD
mutant would demonstrate the role of Lys69 in DHS/
SHK binding. The energies of hydrogen bonds have been
variously estimated to be between 12 and 38 kJ mol-1
[22]. Spectrofluorimetric measurements showed a reduction of 3.5 kJ mol-1 in binding energy of DHS to K69A
MtbSD as compared to the wild-type enzyme.

Conclusion
Based on double isotope effects and pH-rate profiles, we
have previously proposed that the chemical mechanism
for MtbSD involves hydride transfer and solvent proton
transfer in a concerted manner, and that an amino acid
residue with an apparent pKa value of 8.9 is involved in
catalysis [10]. Here we demonstrate that the MtbSD
Lys69 is important for catalysis and is likely involved in
stabilization of the developing negative charge at the
hydride-accepting C-3 carbonyl oxygen of DHS for the
forward reaction, acting as an acid-base catalytic group
that donates a proton to DHS carbonyl group during
reduction, playing a minor role, if any, in substrate
binding.
In bacteria, four subclasses of SD have been identified,
distinguished by their phylogeny and biochemical
activity [27]. In agreement with our results, mutagenesis
studies showed that the corresponding residues Lys67 in
Haemophilus influenzae SD [25] and Lys385 in Arabidopsis
thaliana dehydroquinate dehydratase-SD [26] play a
critical role in catalysis and no role in substrate binding.
Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis of Escherichia coli
YdiB (a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the reversible
reductions of 3-dehydroquinate to quinate and 3dehydroshikimate to shikimate using as co-substrate
either NADH or NADPH) has shown that the conserved
Lys71 residue plays a primary role in substrate binding
in the Michaelis complex and, although it contributes to
some extent to transition state stabilization, plays no
essential role in catalysis [28].
It should be pointed out that mechanistic analysis
should always be a top priority for new enzyme-targeted
drug programs since effective enzyme inhibitors take
advantage of enzyme chemistry to achieve inhibition
[29]. Accordingly, we hope that the results here
presented will pave the way for the target-based rational
design of novel effective antitubercular agents. The
design of inhibitors of MtbSD enzyme activity may
contemplate derivatization of C-3 of DHS with functional groups that make strong interactions with the
Lys69 side chain. It would appear to be unlikely that a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/227

mutation of Lys69 residue would be selected for to
afford drug resistance because here is shown that this
amino acid residue plays a critical role in MtbSD enzyme
activity. However, an important additional point to be
considered when selecting a particular enzyme as a
successful drug target is to determine a flux control
coefficient, which measures the sensitivity of flux to a
change in enzyme concentration. An enzyme is likely a
good target if the flux control coefficient is high, whereas
it is less likely a good target if the flux control coefficient
is close to zero (virtually all the activity must be
eliminated by an inhibitor to have the desired chemotherapeutic effect). Bifunctional dehydroquinate
dehydratase-shikimate dehydrogenases in plants are
responsible for preferential routing of carbon to aromatic amino acid synthesis [30]. However, how shikimate dehydrogenase affects the shikimate pathway flux
in M. tuberculosis is still unknown. Therefore, strategies
for drug design contemplating derivatization of C-3 of
DHS should also take into account whether shikimate
dehydrogenase has a low flux control coefficient because
mutation of Lys69 would be one way of gaining
resistance to this enzyme’s inhibitors.
