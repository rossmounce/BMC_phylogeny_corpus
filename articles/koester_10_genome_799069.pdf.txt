Genome size differentiates co-occurring
populations of the planktonic diatom Ditylum
brightwellii (Bacillariophyta)

Abstract
Background: Diatoms are one of the most species-rich groups of eukaryotic microbes known. Diatoms are also
the only group of eukaryotic micro-algae with a diplontic life history, suggesting that the ancestral diatom
switched to a life history dominated by a duplicated genome. A key mechanism of speciation among diatoms
could be a propensity for additional stable genome duplications. Across eukaryotic taxa, genome size is directly
correlated to cell size and inversely correlated to physiological rates. Differences in relative genome size, cell size,
and acclimated growth rates were analyzed in isolates of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii. Ditylum brightwellii
consists of two main populations with identical 18s rDNA sequences; one population is distributed globally at
temperate latitudes and the second appears to be localized to the Pacific Northwest coast of the USA. These two
populations co-occur within the Puget Sound estuary of WA, USA, although their peak abundances differ
depending on local conditions.
Results: All isolates from the more regionally-localized population (population 2) possessed 1.94 ± 0.74 times the
amount of DNA, grew more slowly, and were generally larger than isolates from the more globally distributed
population (population 1). The ITS1 sequences, cell sizes, and genome sizes of isolates from New Zealand were the
same as population 1 isolates from Puget Sound, but their growth rates were within the range of the slowergrowing population 2 isolates. Importantly, the observed genome size difference between isolates from the two
populations was stable regardless of time in culture or the changes in cell size that accompany the diatom life
history.
Conclusions: The observed two-fold difference in genome size between the D. brightwellii populations suggests
that whole genome duplication occurred within cells of population 1 ultimately giving rise to population 2 cells.
The apparent regional localization of population 2 is consistent with a recent divergence between the populations,
which are likely cryptic species. Genome size variation is known to occur in other diatom genera; we hypothesize
that genome duplication may be an active and important mechanism of genetic and physiological diversification
and speciation in diatoms.

Background
Genotypic and physiological variation is frequently disguised by an apparent morphological constancy traditionally assumed to be stable enough for the assignment
and identification of species. Cryptic species that display
subtle variations in morphology associated with reproductive isolation have been described in all major phylogenetic lineages of eukaryotic marine phytoplankton

[1-4], despite the fact that large population sizes and
ocean mixing were expected to facilitate gene flow and
homogenize species distinctions. Diatoms are the youngest [5] and the most species-rich group of phytoplankton [6,7]; they have risen quickly to become important
contributors to oceanic ecosystems as primary producers
and intermediates in the global biogeochemical cycles of
carbon and silicon [8-10]. The mechanisms of speciation
in diatoms remain under investigation.

eventual speciation [11,12]. Diatoms are the only major
group of eukaryotic phytoplankton with a diplontic life
history, in which all vegetative cells are diploid and
meiosis produces short-lived, haploid gametes, suggesting an ancestral selection for a life history dominated by
a duplicated (diploid) genome. Polyploidization accounts
for 2-4% of speciation events in flowering plants and up
to 7% of speciation events in ferns [13]. In addition,
stable polyploids were observed among laboratory populations of the diatom species Thalassiosira weissflogii
(Grunow) Fryxell and Hasle [14]. Polyploidization may
underlie the variation in chromosome number observed
between and within diatom species [15-18].
A change in genome size precipitates a cascade of cellular responses leading to nearly universal relationships
among genome size, cell size and metabolic rates
[19,20]. In accord with other divergent taxa, genome
size and cell size in phytoplankton are positively correlated [14,21-23]. Growth rates are inversely correlated
with genome and cell sizes such that large-celled species
with more DNA, including diatoms, grow more slowly
than small-celled species with less DNA [24-26].
The relationship between cell size and genome size is
of additional interest in diatoms. Asexual mitotic division produces two daughter cells, one of which is smaller than the mother cell due to the constraints of the
rigid cell wall. Over time, the mean cell size of a clone
decreases with each successive round of division,
whereas the variance in size increases [27,28]. Large cell
sizes are restored through sexual reproduction, or, less
frequently, through asexual enlargement [29]. In a clonal
lineage, the original sexual offspring can have 100-fold
larger volumes than the smallest cells produced asexually. The smallest size that may be attained by a species
is likely influenced by genome size, but the sizes of the
largest cells are likely the result of genetic and environmental interactions during zygotic development.
High genetic divergence characterizes two co-occurring populations of the common coastal diatom Ditylum
brightwellii (T. West) Grunow in van Heurk, which has
a wide-spread coastal and estuarine distribution. In
Puget Sound, WA, D. brightwellii is composed of two
metapopulations that are defined by DNA sequence differences in the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers
(ITS) [30,31]. Both metapopulations consist of two or
more populations (defined by differences in microsatellite allele frequencies) that can co-occur in the water
column [30-34]. For simplicity, the ITS-defined metapopulations will be referred to as populations throughout
this study. Based on ITS sequencing of clones from the
eastern and western margins of the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans including the Yellow Sea (Genbank: EU364892)
and Gulf of Maine (pers. obs.), population 1 appears to
have a circum-global distribution in temperate waters,

while, to date, population 2 has been found only in
Puget Sound [31]. By current taxonomic definitions,
individuals from both populations are members of a single species: their 18s rDNA gene sequences are identical,
and there is no variation in the patterns of the silica cell
wall, which are used traditionally to delineate species
[30,31,33]. There are, however, differences between individuals from the two populations. Field isolates from
population 1 are smaller than those from population 2
and the peaks of their blooms are temporally separated;
this separation is differentially correlated to in situ silicic
acid concentration and daily light exposure [30,31]. Even
though both populations can be found in the water column at the same time, reproduction between them is
limited, as evidenced by high F ST values (0.286) [30],
which are consistent with the presence of cryptic species
[35].
The observed differences in cell size and the limited
gene flow between populations 1 and 2 of Ditylum
brightwellii in the field led us to test the hypothesis that
a difference in DNA content is associated with differences in acclimated growth rates and cell size separating
the populations. Laboratory tests were performed within
the context of two geographic scales, locally within
Puget Sound, and globally, including D. brightwellii
from New Zealand.

Results
Thirty-two isolates from Puget Sound, WA, USA and
Akaroa Harbour, New Zealand (Fig. 1) were assigned to
one of two Ditylum brightwellii populations based on
the seven informative sites that distinguish the two ITS1
type-sequences [30]. The ITS1 sequences from all 10
New Zealand clones and 11 Puget Sound clones were
identical to the type-sequence for population 1 (ITS1-1)
from Puget Sound, including the seven informative sites,
and were assigned to population 1. The ITS1 sequences
for nine Puget Sound clones were identical to the ITS12 type sequence, including all of the informative sites,
and were assigned to population 2. The ITS1 sequences
for two Puget Sound clones were identical to the ITS1-2
type sequence at six of the seven informative sites. The
ITS1 sequence of these two clones was polymorphic (C/
T) at the fourth informative site, which was previously
determined to have low-frequency variation between C
and T and is therefore informative only if sequence at
the other positions is known [31]. These two clones
were also assigned to population 2.
Growth rates varied among clones within each of the
three groups (New Zealand and Puget Sound populations 1 and 2), but among-group differences in growth
rates were greater (Fig. 2A-C). When clones were maintained on a light:dark cycle, the mean growth rate of
clones from Puget Sound population 1 (1.24 ± 0.11 d-1)

was significantly faster than the mean growth rates of
clones from either New Zealand (1.09 ± 0.04 d-1 ) or
Puget Sound population 2 (0.99 ± 0.13 d-1) (ANOVA: F
= 11.18, p = 0.001; Fig. 2A). Population 2 clones had the
greatest range of growth rates, which included the slowest growing clones of either population, but the average
growth rates of population 2 and New Zealand clones
were not significantly different (Fig. 2A). Under conditions of continuous light, a majority of the population 2
clones failed to acclimate to the conditions within the

eight week duration of each experiment (Fig. 2B, C).
These un-acclimated clones grew, but no set of three
consecutive transfer cultures grew at the same rate. In
contrast, a majority of the population 1 clones were able
to acclimate to growth under continuous light.
Cell widths were measured for clones included in the
light:dark treatment of the growth rate experiments.
Population 1 clones from New Zealand and Puget Sound
had the same modal cell width of 14.6 μm (Fig. 2D).
Population 2 clones from Puget Sound had a modal cell

width of 43.9 μm, and were significantly larger than
population 1 clones (Mann-Whitney U test; U = 29,672;
p = 0.000), although individual clones from both populations did have overlapping size ranges (Fig. 2D).
The relative difference in DNA content between the
populations of Ditylum brightwellii was determined
using flow cytometry to measure the integrated SYBR
GREEN I fluorescent signal of 12 clones from the
growth rate experiments and 10 fresh isolates. The
resulting distributions of DNA content were unimodal
regardless of which clone was analyzed, suggesting that
when grown exponentially on a 16:8 light:dark cycle all
clones had progressed similarly through the cell cycle
and were sampled while the majority of cells were in
G1. The DNA distributions of single clones from population 1 and 2 were significantly different from each
other (Fig 3; Mann-Whitney U test, U = 3 × 107 , p =
0.000). To diminish the potential occurrence of multimodality around the peaks of the distributions, non-uniform quantization of the signal, rather than traditional
histograms, was used for subsequent analyses. The nonquantized value is termed the mode. Both methods of
analysis resulted in distributions centered on single
values (the modes) interpreted as the diploid DNA content of G1 cells. There was no indication of a second
mode representing G2+M cells (e.g. Fig. 3). The DNA
content per cell was not significantly different among
individual clones within a population; the mean integrated SYBR signals of population 1 clones were 2.72 ±
0.78 and 3.11 ± 0.50, in relative units, for New Zealand
and Puget Sound isolates, respectively. In contrast, the
per cell DNA content of clones from population 2, 5.65
± 0.82 relative units, was significantly greater than that
of clones from population 1 (Fig. 4A; ANOVA: F =
73.29, p = 0.000). The ratio of the relative DNA content
between populations 1 and 2 was 1.94 ± 0.74.
Clones associated with the DNA content experiments
were isolated 18 months apart and cultured without
controlling for size increases or decreases inherent in
the diatom life history. Distributions of cell width were
pooled for clones within each population, and the
resulting two distributions were significantly different
(Mann-Whitney U test, U = 63,932, p = 0.000). Population 2 cells, which have a two-fold larger DNA content,
tended to have greater minimum and maximum widths
than cells from population 1 (Fig. 4B). A clear correlation between genome size and cell size is obscured by
the overlap of cell width distributions of individual
clones from each population (Fig. 4B). For example,
clones 14-17 from Puget Sound population 1 and clones
18-20 from population 2 are of similar size, yet they
have distinct genome sizes representative of their population of origin (Fig. 4A and 4B).

Discussion
Diatoms are a relatively young, but diverse, group of
eukaryotic micro-organisms that arose approximately
250 million years ago [36]. The genomes of diatoms
appear to be highly flexible and evolve rapidly with
respect to their size and gene content, which allows for
ecological differentiation [14,37-40]. Here we present
evidence that genomic flexibility underlies the recent
divergence of two closely related populations of Ditylum
brightwellii, distinguished from each other by a two-fold
difference in DNA content. This difference in genome
size appears to be stable regardless of the amount of
time isolates from the two populations have been maintained as laboratory cultures.
The DNA content of D. brightwellii was previously
estimated to be 12.9 pg per cell [21], which is the
equivalent of 12.6 gigabases of DNA (assuming 980 MB
pg -1 ;[41]) distributed amongst anywhere from 12-50
chromosomes in each diploid cell [42,43]. At least part
of the explanation for the wide range in chromosome
number is because karyotyping of diatoms is complicated by the presence of a rigid silica cell wall that prevents the consistent flattening of cells required to
spread the condensed chromosomes apart for accurate
enumeration [44]. We instead modified a flow cytometer
to analyze thousands of the D. brightwellii cells that are
up to 150 μm in width to gain an accurate estimate of
the range of relative genome sizes for cultured isolates
from Puget Sound, WA and from New Zealand. All distributions of DNA content were unimodal with a skew
(right hand tail) towards higher DNA content. Actively
dividing cells appear to spend the greatest proportion of
their cell cycle in phases G1, forming the peak (or
mode) of the distribution, and S, represented by cells
under the tail. Thalassiosira weissflogii, a diatom with a
six to twelve-fold smaller genome relative to D. brightwellii (Koester et al. unpublished data), spends a third of
its cell cycle in S phase when maintained in continuous
light and otherwise optimal growth conditions [45], suggesting that the S phase of the much larger genome of
D. brightwellii represents an even greater proportion of
the cell cycle. The level of experimental replication and
consistency of the time of day that the cultures were
collected and preserved argues strongly that cell cycle
dynamics were comparable for clones of both populations, with few cells residing in the G2+M phase.
The most parsimonious explanation for the observed
two-fold difference in DNA content between the two
populations of D. brightwellii is a whole genome duplication event occurring within cells of population 1
creating a polyploid lineage that ultimately gave rise to
population 2 cells. Mitotic and meiotic failures are
potentially important and immediate mechanisms

contributing to DNA content differences among diatom
lineages, assuming that cells survive the initial mutation
and are able to propagate asexually. Triploid and tetraploid zygotes have been observed in five genera of pennate diatoms [46-50], and non-disjunction of
spermatocytes during meiosis was observed in the same
species as stable polyploids [14]. Alternatively, genome
size may increase via aneuploidy, gene duplication, or
the rapid proliferation of transposable elements. Transposable elements were previously proposed as a primary
mechanism of genome size expansion in diatoms [39]
because there was no evidence of whole genome or segmental duplications in either of the two diatoms with
completed genome sequences, yet both contained longterminal-repeat retrotransposons [39,51].
The relationship between genome size and cell size
spans five orders of magnitude for both factors and is a
nearly universal trend in eukaryotes [20]. Diatoms, however, are unique in that cell-wall structure causes size
reduction during asexual reproduction and different
cells within a clone may have vastly different sizes;
therefore, a clear correlation between cell size and genome size among closely related species with genomes of
similar size is unlikely to be found. Nevertheless, there
are indications that genome size influences the minimum size of Ditylum brightwellii clones. The appearance of large cells in clones dominated by small sizes
suggests that the majority of population 1 was within
the sexually inducible size range for D. brightwellii [52],
and that minimum cell sizes were likely being
approached by all of the clones isolated in 2006 and
maintained in culture for 18 months. It is notable that

the smallest cell sizes found in clones of population 2,
which has the larger DNA content, tended to be larger
than the smallest cell sizes found in clones from population 1. Most importantly, with regard to genome size
and cell size, the diploid genome size is consistent
among clones within a population, regardless of the variation in cell size caused by life history constraints.
Similar to traditional common garden experiments,
our growth rate experiments tested for genetic differences among clones of Ditylum brightwellii from two
populations, differentiated by genome size, and two
groups of clones from population 1 represented by different geographic origins. The differences in growth
rates between groups, populations 1 and 2 and New
Zealand versus Puget Sound population 1 isolates, were
greater than any within group variability. Growth rate
variability may occur at the extremes of cell size within
a clone [53,54], but those effects would be masked in
our study by cell size variability within each clone and
diminished by the large difference in growth rates
between the groups. Population 2 clones grew more
slowly than population 1 clones from the same region,
consistent with the expectation that cells with larger cell
sizes and larger genomes will have slower growth rates.
However, population 1 clones from New Zealand grew
more slowly than population 1 clones from Puget
Sound, suggesting that other genetic factors are also
responsible for setting rates of growth. New Zealand
clones are likely adapted to oceanic conditions that are
distinct from the estuarine waters of Puget Sound.
Rapid selection for cell and/or genome size among
diatoms is indicated in the fossil record and appears to

be associated with climate variability [55]. Large cells (>
100 μm diameter) of the morpho-species Azpeitia nodulifera (A. Schmidt) Fryxell and Sims (previously
described as Coscinodiscus nodulifer Schmidt) intermittently enter and exit the sedimentary record, normally
dominated by cells 40 μm in diameter, over the course
of thousands of years [56,57]. The lack of variability in
morphology and the 18S rDNA gene between the two
populations of Ditylum brightwellii suggests that the

genome duplication event was recent and rapid. Genomic plasticity has likely contributed to speciation among
diatoms and may be an important factor in the adaptation of diatoms to future ocean conditions.

Conclusions
The majority of phytoplankton have haplontic life histories [58]; therefore, a transition to a stable duplicated
genome and a diplontic life history are likely at the root

Koester et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/1

of the diatoms, the only phytoplankton group whose
membership is diplontic. The propensity for further
duplications may be a key mechanism of speciation
among diatoms. Speciation is best identified by using a
suite of divergent traits including reproductive isolation,
morphology, ecological and physiological differences
facilitated by genetic divergence. A high F ST value
between the two populations of Ditylum brightwellii
already indicated that that the process of reproductive
isolation was underway, and that these two populations
could represent separate species [30]. Duplicated genes,
arising from the hypothesized whole genome duplication
between the populations, may be released from selective
pressures allowing for mutations that may be masked
until environmental regimes change and they provide an
adaptive advantage to the cell [59]. The apparent localization of population 2 to Pacific Northwest waters appears
to reflect a recent divergence of the populations initiated
by a whole genome duplication event. Population 1 and 2
most likely represent cryptic species in which interbreeding is greatly reduced and phenotypic differentiation is
enhanced. In conjunction with previous work on genome
size variation in diatoms, these results suggest that polyploidization is an active mechanism contributing to the
diversification and speciation of marine diatoms.

Methods
Cell isolation and culturing

Single cells of Ditylum brightwellii were isolated from
Puget Sound, Washington, USA and from the mouth of
Akaroa Harbour, New Zealand during the spring and
summers of 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 1). Thirty-two clonal,
non-axenic cell lines were obtained by micropipetting
individual cells through three aliquots of sterilized seawater into 0.5 ml f/10 medium [60] in a 48-well plate
(Costar, Corning, NY). After one week, each clone was
transferred to 25 ml f/2 medium and maintained as
stock cultures at 13°C, with an irradiance of approximately 40 μmol photons m-2 s-1 and a photoperiod of
16:8 h light:dark.
DNA sequencing

Fifty to 100 ml of clonal culture were filtered onto 25
mm, 5 μm pore size, polycarbonate membrane filters
(Millipore) for DNA extraction using either the DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) or the Easy-DNA Kit (Invitrogen), following manufacturer instructions. The internal
transcribed spacer sequence 1 (ITS1) was polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-amplified with primers 1645F and
Dit5.8sR as described in [30]. Products from six amplification reactions were pooled and purified in one of two
ways. The pooled PCR product was either directly purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit
(Roche Applied Science) or electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels and bands of the appropriate size were excised

Page 8 of 11

and extracted from the agarose with the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The resulting fragments were
sequenced using primers 1645F and Dit5.8sR with the
DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (GE
Healthcare Bio-sciences Corp., New Jersey) and analyzed
on a MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer (GE
Healthcare Biosciences Corp., New Jersey). Sequences
were assigned to a population by aligning them to two
type-sequences [Genbank: DQ329268] (population 1;
ITS1-1) and [Genbank: DQ329270] (population 2; ITS12). Genbank accession numbers for ITS1 sequences
from our study are [Genbank: GQ370472-GQ370503].
Growth rate and size

Acclimated growth rates were determined using semicontinuous batch cultures [61] of the clones isolated in
2006 plus one clone from population 1 isolated in 1997
and one from population 2 isolated in 1998 from Puget
Sound by [32,33]. The ITS1 sequences of the latter two
clones were confirmed in this study. In total, six isolates
from New Zealand, seven from Puget Sound population
1, and nine from Puget Sound population 2 were grown
at 13°C under three different light conditions: continuous
light of 60 and 115 μmol photons m-2 s-1 , and a 16:8 h
light:dark cycle of 110 μmol photons m -2 s -1 . The 60
μmol photons m-2 s-1 continuous light experiment was
completed prior to the other two, which were run simultaneously in separate incubators. Growth rates were
determined by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence
daily with a Turner 10-AU Fluorometer (Sunnyvale, CA)
and verified for a subset of clones by performing daily
cell counts (data not shown). Acclimated growth rates of
each clone were defined as the specific growth rates of
cultures that were not significantly different over three
consecutive transfers (ANCOVA; [62]); the common
slope and associated standard error are reported as the
acclimated growth rate.
Cell size was measured at two discrete times, once at
the conclusion of the growth rate experiments (from the
light:dark treatment) and once in conjunction with the
DNA content experiments. Cells were preserved in a 1%
final concentration each of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde buffered with sterile f/2 medium. Cell width is the
dimension of size reduction in Ditylum brightwellii;
therefore, widths were measured in girdle view, perpendicular to the pervalvar (long) axis at the widest point,
at 400× magnification using a Nikon Eclipse TS100
inverted microscope equipped with an ocular micrometer. Differences in size and growth rates among
populations were analyzed using the statistics package
SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
Relative genome size

Relative DNA content (diploid genome size) was measured using flow cytometry for 12 clones isolated in
2006 and maintained in culture for 18 months and 10

clones isolated in 2007 approximately six months and
six weeks, respectively, prior to measurement. One
hundred ml of each clone were grown in a 16:8 h light:
dark cycle with 110 μmol photons m -2 s -1 at 13°C.
Clones were harvested in mid-exponential phase, half
way through the light cycle, and concentrated by centrifugation (15 min at 1700 - 2000 × g). The pellet was
suspended in 15 ml of 100% methanol at 4°C for 48 h
to extract chlorophyll a [45]. Samples were centrifuged
and washed twice with 4 ml phosphate buffered saline
(PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.4 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ·H 2 O, 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH = 7.4) before being
resuspended in 3 ml PBS and treated with 30 μl RNase
A (ca. 30 mg ml -1 ; R4642; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) at 37°C for 60 min. The DNA was stained with
SYBR GREEN I (Invitrogen), at 1× final concentration,
for at least 20 min. Fluorescent, 1 μm latex beads
(Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were added as standards to each sample. Stained samples were kept on ice
in the dark until run on the flow cytometer. Each clone
of a sampling set (2006 or 2007) was analyzed on a
given day, and replicate clonal samples were analyzed
on separate days. Clones were grown and processed
independently for replicate measurements; duplicate
and triplicate measurements of relative genome size
were made for 2006 and 2007 isolates, respectively.
Mean sample sizes ranged from 8400 - 24,000 cells per
clone per replicate.
An Influx Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
was modified to include a 500 μm sample line, and a
200 μm nozzle producing a sample stream intercepting
a 300 mW, 457 nm laser focused to 20 μm. A 10×
objective lens and position sensitive detectors [63]
allowed for the detection of the SYBR signal (530/20 nm
bandpass filter), which was processed through an electronic integrator that produced a 16-bit data value (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Integrated SYBR signals for each cell of a single clone
were usually unique; therefore, a central tendency, henceforth referred to as the mode, of the integrated SYBR
signal was determined for each clone using a custom
MATLAB script (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Non-uniform quantization was performed on the integrated
SYBR signal for each replicate sample such that bins
were variable in width. The number of cells in each bin
was constant (160 cells bin-1) and optimized by choosing
a cell number that minimized the mean square error of
the integrated SYBR values within each bin and the
number of equally narrow bins. The mean value of the
integrated SYBR signal from the narrowest bin, which
represented the greatest concentration of cells within
the smallest range of integrated SYBR signals, was taken
as the mode. In the minority of cases in which two
nearby bins were equally narrow, the mean of the range

Page 9 of 11

of the two bins was calculated as the mode. Bimodality
would be indicated by equally narrow bins occurring at
a distance apart.
The integrator was calibrated for linearity by collecting the integrated fluorescent signals of beads (1 μm)
and their doublets as the gain was increased by 2× intervals across the dynamic range of the integrator. The
relationship between the linear input values of the beads
and their integrated SYBR signal was determined to be
of the form f(x) = Abx , where f(x) = linear value, A =
0.6445, b = 5.99 × 10-5, and x = integrated SYBR signal
yielded the best fit (SSE = 1.397; R2 = 0.9972; CurveFit
Toolbox, MATLAB). Modal values of the integrated
SYBR signal were applied to this equation with the linear output reported here.
