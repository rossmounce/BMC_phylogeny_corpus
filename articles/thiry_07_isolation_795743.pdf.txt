Abstract
Background: The genus Varicellovirus of the Herpesviridae subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae includes a
cluster of viruses antigenically and genetically related to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1): namely
bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV-5), bubaline herpesvirus 1 (BuHV-1), caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1),
cervid herpesviruses 1 (CvHV-1) and 2 (CvHV-2) and elk herpesvirus 1 (ElkHV-1). Considering the
serological relationship between these ruminant alphaherpesviruses, several surveys have studied
the occurrence of BoHV-1 related virus infection in wild and domestic ruminant species. In this
way, a recent investigation has indicated, in Belgium, a high increase in the serological prevalence
of BoHV-1 related virus infection in free-ranging red deer population. In this context, it has been
decided to investigate the presence of an alphaherpesvirus spreading in the Belgian free-ranging red
deer population.
Results: The current study reports the first isolation in a free-ranging red deer of a BoHV-1 closely
related virus. The isolate was antigenically, genomically and genetically characterised by comparison
with several ruminant alphaherpesvirus. Immunofluorescence assays revealed the isolate was
antigenically distinct from bovine and caprine alphaherpesviruses. Similarly, BamHI and BstEII
restriction analyses demonstrated the genomic difference between the isolate and the other
ruminant alphaherpesviruses. Next, the sequencing of selected parts of UL27 and US8 genes
showed a high degree of homologies between each BoHV-1 related ruminant alphaherpesvirus and
the isolate. Besides the close relationship between all ruminant alphaherpesviruses, the
phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate clustered with CvHV-1.
Conclusion: The first isolation of a virus closely related to BoHV-1 in a free-ranging red deer is
reported. Data demonstrate that a CvHV-1 strain, named Anlier, circulates in wild red deer in
continental Europe. Anlier strain show consistent differences with the virus isolated from Scottish
farmed red deer. All together, these results improve our understanding of ruminant
alphaherpesviruses.

Background
The family Herpesviridae includes nearly two hundred
viruses isolated from various hosts including molluscs,
fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and at least
one invertebrate. Based on biological and molecular properties, the family has been divided into three subfamilies
of viruses, Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae, which
have co-evolved with different host species. Illustrating
the concept, several ruminant alphaherpesviruses form a
cluster of antigenically and genetically related viruses [1].
Seven alphaherpesviruses belong to this cluster where
bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), responsible for infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), a cattle disease of major economic concern in Europe, is the prototype [2] : bovine
herpesvirus 5 (BoHV-5) causing meningo-encephalitis in
calves [3], bubaline herpesvirus 1 (BuHV-1) responsible
for subclinical infections in water buffaloes [4], caprine
herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) inducing systemic disease in kids
and abortion in adults [5], cervid herpesvirus 1 (CvHV-1)
responsible for conjunctivitis in red deer [6], cervid herpesvirus 2 (CvHV-2) and elk herpesvirus 1 (ElkHV-1)
causing subclinical genital infections in reindeer and elk
respectively [7,8]. Phylogenetic studies of conserved herpesvirus sequences showed that BoHV-5 and BuHV-1
were most closely related to BoHV-1, followed by ElkHV1, CvHV-1, CvHV-2 and CpHV-1 [7,9,10]. However,
BoHV-1 related ruminant alphaherpesvirus are not always
restricted to their natural host species. Indeed, buffalo,
goat, sheep, red deer and reindeer were successfully
infected with BoHV-1 under experimental conditions.
Similarly, cattle were shown to be susceptible to BuHV-1,
CpHV-1, CvHV-1, CvHV-2 and ElkHV-1 [1]. The crossserological relationship between these viruses and BoHV1 was also demonstrated by seroneutralisation and
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [11-14].
Consequently, the properties shared by BoHV-1 related
alphaherpesviruses can lead to misdiagnosis of BoHV-1
infection which can be considered as a threat to infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis eradication programmes [1].
CvHV-1 was firstly isolated in 1983 from a farmed red
deer suffering of ocular lesions. The disease, showing a
contagious character, emerged at the end of 1982 in a red
deer stag in northern Scotland. Fifty to sixty animals out
of 80 exhibited clinical signs at various degrees. A seroneutralisation assay demonstrated the serological relationship of the virus with BoHV-1 [6]. Since this isolation, no
epidemic of the ocular disease in red deer stags and no
severe epidemic in free-ranging animals have been
reported. More recently, CvHV-1 was identified in NewZealand during routine export examination of semen collected from red deer stags [15]. CvHV-1 is responsible for
the herpetic conjunctivitis of red deer commonly named
ocular syndrome. The disease is characterised by purulent
ocular discharge, hypopyon, uniform corneal opacity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/26

without ulceration, mucopurulent nasal discharge and
photophobia. Moderate swelling of the periorbital tissues
and marked oedema of the upper eyelids are also
observed [6]. The reactivation of CvHV-1 was successfully
performed suggesting the persistence of the infection in a
latent state [16].
Since it was demonstrated that red deer is infected by a
herpesvirus, several studies have been initiated to evaluate
the percentage of animals seropositive to BoHV-1 and
CvHV-1 [17,18]. The first serological survey revealed that
CvHV-1 infection was widespread in Scotland with prevalences of 40% in hill deer and 33% in farmed deer [19].
English farmed deer were also tested for CvHV-1 antibody
and presented a prevalence of 14% [19]. In Germany,
12.8% of red deer hunted between 1984 and 1986 were
seropositive to BoHV-1 [20] and the serological evidence
of a CvHV-1 infection was reported one year later [21].
More recently, antibodies against BoHV-1 were found in
5.4% red deer from the German region Brandenburg [22].
In Czech republic, 68% and 71% of red deer were seropositive to BoHV-1 and CvHV-1 respectively [23] and 0.5%
of free-ranging red deer in Norway [24]. Outside of
Europe, CvHV-1 infection was identified in New Zealand
[15,25] and 55% of red deer living in United States
National Parks were seropositive to BoHV-1 [26]. However, these results only suggest a red deer CvHV-1 infection since the selected tests were not specific to CvHV-1
but to BoHV-1 [1,27].
In Belgium, two serological investigations aiming to
detect antibodies against BoHV-1 were performed. The
first one indicated that 11% of Belgian red deer were seropositive to BoHV-1 or another related herpesvirus [28]. In
2001 and 2002, a higher prevalence was noticed with
28.9% of red deer positive to BoHV-1 (F. Gregoire and A.
Linden, unpublished data). However, since experimental
quantification of BoHV-1 transmission in red deer demonstrated that BoHV-1 would probably not survive more
than a few decades in red deer populations [27], it is most
likely that BoHV-1 antibodies prevalence was due to
CvHV-1 and not a BoHV-1 cross-species infection. Regarding these data, it was decided to investigate the presence
of an alphaherpesvirus spreading in the Belgian free-ranging red deer population.

Results
Isolation and identification of a red deer alphaherpesvirus
During the 2004 and 2005 hunting seasons, nasal and
genital swabs were collected from free-living red deer in
the South of Belgium. A viral isolate (050136) was
obtained in MDBK cells inoculated with a nasal swab
from a male fawn (Cervus elaphus) hunted in Anlier forest.
The animal was in good shape and weighed 47 kg. The
confirmation of the positive sample was performed by

inoculation with the duplicate swab. The virus induced a
cytopathic effect morphologically and temporally typical
of a herpesvirus (data not shown). By PCR [10], a 443 bp
region of glycoprotein B gene (UL27) was amplified (data
not shown). Taken together, results suggested that the
Anlier isolate belonged to the cluster of BoHV-1 related
alphaherpesviruses. The analysis of the PCR product
sequence showed that the Anlier isolate was close to
BoHV-1 related ruminant alphaherpesviruses especially
CvHV-1 (data not shown).
Antigenic characterisation of the Anlier isolate within
ruminant alphaherpesviruses
In order to discriminate antigenically the Anlier isolate
between bovine, caprine and cervid alphaherpesviruses,
five selected monoclonal antibodies were tested by
immunofluorescence assay on cells infected separately
with the five related alphaherpesviruses: G14G11F5 for
BoHV-1, 2915 for BoHV-5, 2E5G5G1 for CpHV-1, 6C2
for CvHV-1 and 5G10 for CvHV-2. Monoclonal antibodies detected their specific viruses as demonstrated by
Keuser and collaborators [29], however, none of them
reacted with the Anlier isolate. One can speculate that
since CvHV-1 was also isolated from a red deer, CvHV-1
and the Anlier isolate might cross-react serologically.
Therefore, other monoclonal antibodies were assessed to
detect specifically the Anlier isolate. One monoclonal
antibody, 6C3, identified the Anlier isolate. However, a
weak reaction was also observed on CvHV-1 or CvHV-2
infected cells (Figure 1). Taken together, these results
demonstrated that the Anlier isolate was antigenically distinct from BoHV-1, BoHV-5 and CpHV-1, but presumably
possesses some common epitopes with CvHV-1 and
CvHV-2.

Genomic comparison of the Anlier isolate to ruminant
alphaherpesviruses
To avoid any misinterpretation due to antigenic cross
reactions, Anlier isolate and ruminant alphaherpesviruses
were submitted to restriction enzyme analysis by using
two endonucleases, BamHI (Figure 2a) and BstEII (Figure
2b). The patterns were in accordance with the previously
published patterns [30-32] and clearly allowed a differentiation between each ruminant alphaherpesvirus as well
as between BoHV-1 subtypes 1 and 2 (Figure 2). These
data confirmed that the Anlier isolate was genomically
distinct from the other related ruminant alphaherpesviruses.
Phylogenetic relationship between Anlier isolate and
ruminant alphaherpesviruses
To further characterise the Anlier isolate, different regions
of the genome were sequenced (Figure 3). Partial
sequence data from UL27 encoding the glycoprotein B
(gB) and US8 encoding the glycoprotein E (gE) were
obtained for eight ruminant alphaherpesviruses including
the two BoHV-1 subtypes and the Anlier isolate. These
sequences represented two different degrees of conservation among ruminant alphaherpesviruses genes. The
sequence lengths were 444 nucleotides for UL27 and varied between 597 and 609 nucleotides for US8. By analysing multiple nucleotide sequences alignments in the US8
sequence, CvHV-1 and CvHV-2 differed from each other
by 96 out of 609 bases, CvHV-1 and ElkHV-1 by 15 out of
609 bases, ElkHV-1 and the Anlier isolate by 22 out of 609
bases, CvHV-2 and the Anlier isolate by 99 out of 609
bases, and CvHV-1 and the Anlier isolate by 16 out of 609
bases (Figure 4). Tables 1 and 2 compare the percentage of
nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity between
each ruminant alphaherpesviruses. Phylogenetic analyses
were also performed to assess the relationship between
the Anlier isolate and other ruminant alphaherpesviruses

Materials and Methods. 6C3 is the primary antibody and was detected by FITC-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulin anti-mouse
IgG. Presence of viral plaques was checked by transmission microscopy before epifluorescence microscopy. All immunofluorescence stainings were performed three times. Symbols: +, positive signal; -, negative signal; +/-, weak signal.

(Figure 5). BoHV-5 and BuHV-1 clustered together and are
the most closely related to BoHV-1 1.1 and BoHV-1 1.2.
CpHV-1 is the most diverging ruminant alphaherpesvirus.
CvHV-1 is more related to BoHV-1 than ElkHV-1 and
CvHV-2 which is the most closely related to CpHV-1. The
Anlier isolate clustered with CvHV-1 and the most closely
related virus is ElkHV-1. The same topography was
obtained for phylogenetic trees based on UL27 (Figure
5a) and US8 nucleotide sequences (Figure 5b). Taken
together, these data revealed high degrees of homology
between each ruminant alphaherpesvirus, the highest
being observed between CvHV-1 and the Anlier isolate
demonstrating the identification of a new CvHV-1 strain.

Discussion
The use of a consensus PCR detecting bovine, caprine, red
deer and reindeer alphaherpesviruses [10] has allowed the
detection and the identification of the CvHV-1 Anlier
strain and its phylogenic position in the BoHV-1 related
alphaherpesvirus cluster. No cross-reaction was observed
when monoclonal antibodies specific of ruminant
alphaherpesviruses were applied to cells infected with the

Anlier strain. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 6C3,
described as being specific to CvHV-1 [29], surprisingly
detected more specifically the Anlier strain than CvHV-1.
The weak reactivity observed with CvHV-2 could result
from epitopes common with the Anlier strain. To further
characterise the Anlier strain in comparison with ruminant alphaherpesviruses, restriction enzyme analysis were
performed. Similarities in the BamHI and BstEII restriction patterns further support that the Anlier isolate is a
new strain of CvHV-1.
When analysing nucleotide and amino acid sequences
similarities, the difference in the degree of conservation
between UL27 and US8 sequences is demonstrated
among BoHV-1 related ruminant alphaherpesviruses,
confirming BoHV-5 previously obtained data [33]. Such
difference in the level of conservation between UL27 and
US8 sequences could influence the diagnosis of ruminant
alphaherpesvirus infections by both BoHV-1 gB and gE
blocking ELISAs. Indeed, experimentally BoHV-5 infected
calves were shown to be positive in BoHV-1 gB blocking
ELISA and negative in BoHV-1 gE blocking ELISA allowing

the discrimination between BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 [11]. As
the highest US8 sequences similarity is observed between
BoHV-1 and BoHV-5, it can be hypothesised such methodology serologically discriminate between other heterologous infections, e.g. between BoHV-1 and CpHV-1
infection of goats [34] or between BoHV-1 and CvHV-1
infection in red deer [27].
Phylogenetic analysis showed that the most closely
related viruses to BoHV-1 1.1 and BoHV-1 1.2 are BoHV5 and BuHV-1 followed by CvHV-1 and ElkHV-1 clustering together and further by CvHV-2 and CpHV-1. These
results extend the knowledge on the genetic relatedness of
BoHV-1 related ruminant alphaherpesviruses to BuHV-1
and ElkHV-1 [9,10,35-37]. Each ruminant alphaherpesvirus is closely related to each other both for UL27 and US8
sequences similarities confirming the presence of a consistent group of ruminant alphaherpesviruses in the family Herpesviridae. Additionally, primers designed to
partially amplify US8 bring a new tool in the detection of
ruminant alphaherpesvirus infection. Furthermore, they
could be used to differentiate wild type BoHV-1 from vaccinal gE-negative BoHV-1 [38].

for US8 and 3 out of 444 bases for UL27). However, nothing is known about the potential strain pathogenicity.
Moreover, deeper investigations are necessary to assess if
this red deer alphaherpesvirus is a new viral subtype.
Experimental infection of red deer with CvHV-1 lead to
mild clinical signs, such as hyperthermia, nasal ulceration
and conjunctivitis, and virus was reisolated from nasal
and ocular swabs [16,39]. Natural infection of farmed red
deer induced an ocular syndrome associated with various
clinical manifestations [6]. Here, the Anlier strain was isolated from a nasal swab and the animal did not present
any lesions. Moreover, no case of suspicious red deer
death was noticed during 2004 and 2005 hunting seasons
although a high seroprevalence was observed (F. Gregoire
and A. Linden, unpublished data). Based on these data, it
can be postulated that Anlier strain as several other herpesviruses could induce subclinical respiratory infection.
However, it can be also hypothesised that as other herpesviruses too, it may predispose the respiratory tract for secondary bacterial infections or has the capacity by itself to
initiate other disease forms [2]. In order to answer these
questions, Anlier strain pathogenicity should be investigated by red deer experimental inoculation.

Genetic analysis of the Anlier strain reveals clear differences with CvHV-1 reference strain (16 out of 609 bases

of European red deer is under human influence [40,41].
During the last one thousand years, there was an extensive
trade of the species mainly with the aim to improve the
hunted trophy quality [40,42]. The existence of illegal
translocation of animals by hunters was recently evidenced in Luxemburg. By using a multilocus genotyping,
a red deer group was excluded from the autochthonous
population [43] suggesting the presence imported red
deer from foreign countries. In the Walloon Region of Belgium, reintroduction of imported animals in wildlife is

unclear due to a lack of documentation. An extinction of
the species occurred in 1848 and red deer were most likely
imported from eastern European countries. In this regard,
genetic analysis showed that Scottish CvHV-1 Banffshire
82 strain is different from Belgian Anlier strain. Consequently, viral transmission to a Belgian red deer from a
reintroduced Scottish farmed red deer can not be currently
supported in absence of molecular epidemiology of the
two strains.

In contrast, the hypothesis of an endemic infection occurring in continental Europe has to be considered. A genetic
cluster of red deer is distributed from Belgium, across Luxemburg, to Germany [43]. Similarly, the presence of
genetic units over larger area has also been proven for the
Engadin Valley population in eastern Switzerland [44]
and in the Carpathian mountains in Romania [45]. It can
be hypothesised that animals infected with Anlier strain
belong to red deer genetic clusters described in the Czech
Republic, Germany, and Hungary and spread the infection. This hypothesis is supported by the high BoHV-1
seroprevalence observed in red deer in these countries
[20-23]. In Scotland, the wild red deer herds have produced the initial stocks for many deer farms [46] where
the Scottish CvHV-1 Banffshire 82 strain was isolated [6].
This strain was probably already established in the wild
deer population in Great Britain. As most British populations are non-indigenous [40,41], the virus could have
been introduced a long time ago in the red deer population in Great Britain from continental Europe and could
have diverged from the original virus. The virus could
have persisted in small populations because of latency
[16] and the industrial deer farming facilitated the identification of the virus. However, additional experiments are
requested to investigate if the Belgian Anlier strain could
be the ancestor of the Scottish Banffshire 82 strain.

Conclusion
According to our knowledge, this is the first report on the
isolation of a ruminant alphaherpesvirus from free-ranging red deer. The antigenic, genomic and genetic analysis
demonstrated that the detected virus, termed CvHV-1
Anlier strain, is closely related to, but different from the
CvHV-1 Banffshire 82 strain. This isolation and our
knowledge of red deer population evolution in Europe
allow the formulation of an interesting hypothesis on the
origin of this virus in red deer knowing CvHV-1 Banffshire
82 strain had been isolated in farmed red deer in Scotland.
Furthermore, our investigation brings the first comparative diagnosis of all known ruminant alphaherpesviruses
related to BoHV-1 and especially a genetic definition of
these viruses.

Methods
Cells and viruses
The Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line (ATCC
CCL22) was maintained in Earle minimal essential
medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 5% of heat-inactivated foetal bovine
serum (FBS) (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and 2%
penicillin (5,000 Units/ml) streptomycin (5,000 µg/ml)
(PS) (Invitrogen). The CvHV-1 virus Anlier strain and
BoHV-1 Lam 1.1 [47], BoHV-1 K22 1.2a [48], BoHV-5
N569 [49], BuHV-1 b6 [4], CpHV-1 Ba-1 [50], CvHV-1
Banffshire 82 [6], CvHV-2 Salla 82 [51], ElkHV-1 [7] virus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/26

strains were propagated on MDBK cells in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Viral stocks were produced by infection of confluent MDBK cells at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.1 in MEM supplemented with 2% PS and 5%
FBS. When the cytopathic effect reached 90%, culture
medium was removed and clarified by centrifugation at
1,500 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were aliquoted,
frozen at -80°C, and titrated by plaque assay on MDBK
cells as previously described [52].
Viral DNA extraction
Viruses propagated on MDBK cells were clarified by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were
removed and further ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for
60 min. to pellet virions. Pellets were resuspended in TE
buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA) with 0.1%
NP40, incubated 30 min at 37°C and ultracentrifuged 2
hours at 100,000 × g through a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer with 0.5%
sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and digested with proteinase K (700 µg/ml, Roche Diagnostic) for 2 h. at 56°C. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of half volume
ammonium acetate (1.5 M, pH 7.5) and DNA was precipitated by addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. Viral DNA was
extracted as previously described [52].
Restriction enzyme analysis
Viral DNA was submitted to BamHI and BstEII restriction
endonucleases (New England Biolabs, England, United
Kingdom). The digestion products were electrophoresed
in a 0.7% Tris Acetate EDTA gel for 18 h at 40 V/cm and
500 mA. SmartLadder (10 kb; Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium)
was used as molecular mass marker.
Immunofluorescence staining
An immunofluorescence assay was performed as
described by Keuser and collaborators [29] with minor
modifications. Briefly, MDBK cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with the different viruses and incubated 48 h in MEM containing 5% FBS and 0.6%
carboxymethylcellulose. The coverslips with individual
plaques were fixed in PBS containing 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and incubated with undiluted hybridoma
supernatant or 1,000-fold-diluted ascitic fluid in PBSF. As
secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
IgG (2 µg/ml; Dako) was used. Coverslips were mounted
with a Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes Europe BV,
Leiden, The Netherlands). Pictures were captured with a
charge-coupled device Leica DC 300F camera (with Leica
IM 50 V1.20 software) installed on an epifluorescence
microscope.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Two different sets of primers were used in this study. The
diagnostic PCR and the sequencing of a 443 bp region of

glycoprotein B gene (UL27) was performed by applying
the CR30 (5'-TCGAARGCCGAGTACCTGCG-3'; sense; 5'
end, position 56,051) and CR31 (5'-CCAGTCCCAGGCRACCGTCAC-3'; antisense; 5' end, position 56,494)
primer set [10]. To extend phylogenetic analyses between
ruminant alphaherpesviruses and the viral isolate,
another set of primers amplifying an estimated 624 bp
region of glycoprotein E gene (US8) was designed:
ALPHA/US8/914F (5'-CGARACSTGCATCTTYCACC-3';
sense; 5' end, position) and ALPHA/US8/1538R (5'GGSTCGTTGSTYGGM-3'; antisense; 5' end, position).
Fragments resulting from PCR were purified with
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Quiagen, Venlo, The
Netherlands) and cloned using the pGEM®-T Easy vector
system (Promega, Leiden, The Nederlands). The sequencing was performed by the GIGA sequencing facility
(GIGA, Liège, Belgium). Sequences were assembled and
aligned by using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor
software [53]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed, by
distance methods, using the programs dnadist, neighbor
and drawgram included in the PHYLIP package [54]. The
reliability of the trees were assesed by resampling and analysing 1000 random data sets (bootstrapping) using Seqboot and consense software in the PHYLIP package.
Nucleotide sequence accession number
The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited
in the GenBank database under the accession numbers
EF624466 to EF624479. The following previously GenBank published sequences were used in this study: BoHV1 K22 UL27 [AF078725.1], BoHV-5 N569 UL27
[AF078726.2], CvHV-1 Banffshire 82 UL27 [AF078729.2]
and CvHV-2 Salla 82 UL27 [AF078727.2].
