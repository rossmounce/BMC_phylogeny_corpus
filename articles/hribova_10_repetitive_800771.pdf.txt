genome investigated by low-depth
454 sequencing

Abstract
Background: Bananas and plantains (Musa spp.) are grown in more than a hundred tropical and subtropical
countries and provide staple food for hundreds of millions of people. They are seed-sterile crops propagated
clonally and this makes them vulnerable to a rapid spread of devastating diseases and at the same time hampers
breeding improved cultivars. Although the socio-economic importance of bananas and plantains cannot be
overestimated, they remain outside the focus of major research programs. This slows down the study of nuclear
genome and the development of molecular tools to facilitate banana improvement.
Results: In this work, we report on the first thorough characterization of the repeat component of the banana
(M. acuminata cv. ‘Calcutta 4′) genome. Analysis of almost 100 Mb of sequence data (0.15× genome coverage)
permitted partial sequence reconstruction and characterization of repetitive DNA, making up about 30% of the
genome. The results showed that the banana repeats are predominantly made of various types of Ty1/copia and
Ty3/gypsy retroelements representing 16 and 7% of the genome respectively. On the other hand, DNA transposons
were found to be rare. In addition to new families of transposable elements, two new satellite repeats were
discovered and found useful as cytogenetic markers. To help in banana sequence annotation, a specific Musa
repeat database was created, and its utility was demonstrated by analyzing the repeat composition of 62 genomic
BAC clones.
Conclusion: A low-depth 454 sequencing of banana nuclear genome provided the largest amount of DNA
sequence data available until now for Musa and permitted reconstruction of most of the major types of DNA
repeats. The information obtained in this study improves the knowledge of the long-range organization of banana
chromosomes, and provides sequence resources needed for repeat masking and annotation during the Musa
genome sequencing project. It also provides sequence data for isolation of DNA markers to be used in genetic
diversity studies and in marker-assisted selection.

Background
Bananas and plantains (Musa spp.) are perennial giant
herbs grown in humid tropical and subtropical regions.
Their annual production exceeds 100 million tons, out
of which almost 90% is targeted for local and national
markets [1]. Cultivated bananas are parthenocarpic,
seed-sterile, vegetatively-propagated diploid, triploid and
tetraploid clones. Most of them are hybrids between two
diploid (2n = 2x = 22) species M. acuminata and

M. balbisiana [2] with the A and B genomes respectively. The production of bananas is threatened by many
diseases and pests, but the clonal nature, seed sterility
and the lack of knowledge on the origin of cultivated
clones hampers breeding of improved cultivars. It is
expected that the use of molecular tools will speed up
banana germplasm improvement. Sadly, although the
socio-economic importance of bananas and plantains
cannot be questioned, Musa remains outside the focus
of major research programs and must be considered an
under-researched crop.
This situation is reflected by a limited knowledge of
the banana nuclear genome, even though it is relatively

small (1C ~ 600 Mbp) [3,4]. It has been estimated that
about 55% of the genome is made of various DNA
repeats [5], but only a limited number of repetitive
DNA sequences has been characterized. Valárik et al.
(2002) described twelve Radka repeats [6], representing
partial sequences of various mobile elements and rRNA
genes. Other characterized sequences included a Copialike element [7,8], a species-specific element Brep-1
[9,10] and a Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposon monkey
[11]. In order to identify more repeats, Hřibová et al. [5]
applied a low-Cot DNA isolation technique to characterize highly repetitive fractions of banana genome. An
important step forward in dissecting the Musa genome
was made by Cheung and Town (2007), who sequenced
ends of more than 6,000 BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) clones [12]. Moreover, 62 BAC clones were
completely sequenced through a Generation Challenge
Programme funded project (GCP 2005-15), within the
context of the Global Musa Genomics Consortium [13].
Nevertheless, even after these efforts, the knowledge on
the repetitive part of Musa genome remains far from
complete.
Recent introduction of the next generation sequencing
methods [14] provided powerful tools to discover and
characterize DNA repeats, even in complex plant genomes. For example, Macas et al. (2007) used the 454
technology to characterize repetitive DNA in the nuclear
genome of pea (Pisum sativum L.) [15]. Despite the relatively small proportion of sequenced DNA relative to
the whole genome (33.3 Mb or ~ 0.77% of the genome),
the authors identified and characterized most types of
retrotransposons and discovered thirteen new families of
tandemly organized repeats. In a similar study, Swaminathan et al. (2007) used the 454 system to sequence
7.5% of the soybean genome [16].
This study addresses the lack of knowledge on the
repetitive part of the banana genome by characterizing
all major DNA repeats after massively parallel sequencing of genomic DNA of a diploid clone of M. acuminata. The experimental approach follows that of Macas
et al. [15], in which all-to-all similarity comparison of
454 reads is performed to identify groups (clusters) of
overlapping reads representing repetitive genomic
sequences. As the number of reads in individual clusters
is proportional to genomic abundance of corresponding
repeats, this information can be used for quantitative
analysis of repetitive genome landscape. In addition,
consensus sequences of the repeated elements can be
obtained by assembling the reads within clusters. We
also demonstrate how databases of 454 reads sorted
according to the type of repeats can be used to identify
and classify repeats in BAC sequences. Finally, the large
set of sequences obtained in this study provides a
unique source of molecular markers potentially useful in

genome mapping, anchoring physical maps, analyzing
genetic diversity and for phylogenetic studies.

Results and Discussion
A diploid clone M. acuminata cv. ‘Calcutta 4′ was chosen for sequencing as it has been used extensively as a
model genotype in previous molecular studies
[5,6,12,17-19]. Moreover, this clone is being used in
various banana breeding programs as a source of diseases resistance [20,21]. A sequencing run of nuclear
DNA on the GS FLX platform (454 Life Sciences/
Roche) resulted in 477,699 reads with average length
of 206 bp, providing a total of 98,538,911 bp of
sequence data. Considering genome size of ‘Calcutta 4′
(1C = 623 Mbp) [4], this represents 15.7% of the genome. The sequencing reads were clustered based on
their similarity and all clusters containing at least
20 reads (roughly representing 0.01% of the genome)
were further investigated.
LTR-retrotransposons

The most abundant DNA sequences found in the
banana genome were LTR-retrotransposons. Out of
them, Ty1/copia represented more than 16% of the genome while the Ty3/gypsy elements represented about 7%
of the genome (Figure 1). This is an interesting observation as the available data from other sequencing projects
indicate prevalence of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons in
plant nuclear genomes [15,22-24]. In order to get insight
into the diversity of banana LTR-retrotransposons, we
performed phylogenetic analysis based on a comparison
of their reverse transcriptase domains. This work
revealed that while the more abundant Ty1/copia-like
elements were represented by four distinct evolutionary
lineages (Figure 2A), vast majority of Ty3/gypsy-like elements belonged to a single evolutionary lineage of chromoviruses [25] (Figure 2B).
About 74% of identified Ty1/copia sequences belonged
to the SIRE/Maximus lineage [26,27], representing
almost 13% of the genome. The remaining Ty1/copia
elements belonging to Angela, Tnt1 and Hopscotch
lineages [27-29] represented only about 3.0, 1.0 and
0.2% of the genome, respectively. Interestingly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on mitotic chromosomes revealed that elements from distinct evolutionary
lineages have different patterns of genomic distribution.
The elements from the SIRE/Maximus and Angela
lineages were concentrated in several discrete clusters
on all chromosomes (Figures 3D, E) and the elements
from the Tnt-1 lineage gave only weak signals preferentially localized in distal parts of mitotic chromosomes
(Figure 3F). Elements belonging to the Hopscotch lineage were not tested for the distribution because of their
very low proportion in the genome.

Figure 1 Genome proportion of major groups of repetitive sequences identified in banana 454 data.

Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons showed relatively low
degree of phylogenetic diversity and most of them
belonged to the lineage of chromoviruses. This single
lineage comprised about 87% of Ty3/gypsy elements
identified in this study, thus greatly outnumbering elements from the Tat lineage, which included all other
Ty3/gypsy elements identified in the banana genome.
The chromoviral sequences could be classified into four
clades: Galadriel, Tekay, Reina and CRM [30-32]. The
most abundant chromoviral clade was Reina, which
involved more than half of all chromoviral sequences,
making up about 4% of the banana genome. Many elements belonging to this clade appeared to be nonautonomous as they lacked parts of RT-coding domain
(data not shown). Members of the Tekay clade were
found to be the second most abundant group of chromoviruses, reaching about 2% of the genome. Sequences
from the Galadriel clade corresponded to the retrotransposon monkey, which has been identified earlier in the
banana genome [11]. The consensus sequences of the
monkey retrotransposon assembled from our 454 data as
a 5880 bp fragment showed 95% similarity to the monkey element described by Balint-Kurti et al. (2000) [11].
Previous estimates of the copy number using slot-blot
analysis indicated that monkey constituted about 0.2 0.5% of the M. acuminata genome [11] and are on line
with our estimates based on the proportion of monkeyderived sequences in 454 reads (Additional file 1).
Although the monkey was supposed to be the most
abundant repetitive element in banana [5], our data
showed that several other families of retroelements
account for much larger parts of the genome. The CRM
clade sequences occupied a similar fraction of the genome as those from the Galadriel clade. Although being
members of the same evolutionary lineage, banana chromoviruses from distinct clades partly differed in their

chromosomal distribution. Contrary to monkey, which
preferentially localized in secondary constrictions [11],
members of other clades occupied mostly pericentromeric regions and some additional loci in distal parts of
all chromosomes (Figures 3G, H).
Non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons

Compared to LTR-retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons were found relatively
rare (Additional file 1). Within the clusters that represented at least 0.01% of the genome, only one cluster of
LINE sequences [33] and two clusters of DNA transposons were identified. The LINE elements were estimated
to constitute about 1% of the banana genome. FISH
with a probe derived from reverse transcriptase domain
of a LINE-like element, resulted in dot signals in centromeric regions on all chromosomes (Figure 3I). DNA
transposons identified in this work included elements
that showed similarity to transposons belonging to the
hAT superfamily [34]. FISH with a probe derived from
hAT-related element failed to give visible signals, most
probably due to relatively small copy number. The low
abundance of LINEs and DNA transposons seems to be
typical for plant genomes and similar abundances were
observed for example in rice, grape and maize genomes
[23,24,35].
45S and 5S rDNA

Clusters containing 45S rDNA represented 1.12% of the
genome and the 45S rDNA sequence region was reconstructed as a 7,553 bp fragment that included complete
sequence of the 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA locus surrounded
by parts of intergenic spacer (IGS). Moreover, based on
similarity searches to BAC clone MA4_01C21 from
M. acuminata, which was sequenced within the context
of the Global Musa Genomics Consortium [13] and

which carries 45S rDNA units, another cluster containing IGS-like sequence was identified in the 454 data.
In contrast to Balint-Kurti et al. (2000) whose results
obtained after FISH with mitotic chromosomes indicated insertion of a part of monkey into 45S rDNA [11],
our 454 data suggests that monkey is not frequently
associated with the 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA gene copies.

A plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the
insertion is adjacent to the 45S rDNA locus. In fact, the
spatial resolution of FISH on mitotic chromosomes is
not sufficient to discriminate two loci closer than 5 - 10
Mbp [36,37]. A close vicinity of the monkey fragment to
45S rDNA is supported by the sequence data of the
BAC MA4_01C21 comprising 45S rDNA, in which a

Hřibová et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:204
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/204

1.5kb fragment of monkey was identified. However, the
fragment was not inserted in the 45SrDNA or IGS
sequences. The fact that this BAC comprises a chromovirus element from the Tekay lineage and the SIRE1/
Maximus lineage indicates that the BAC MA4_01C21
actually encompasses a border of the 45S rDNA locus
and flanking genomic sequences, characterized by
sequence-heterogeneity and insertion of various mobile
elements.
Similar to the 45S rRNA gene cluster, our 454
sequence data enabled reconstruction of the entire coding part of the 5S rRNA gene and its non-transcribed
spacer. The 5S rDNA was found to represent 0.38% of
the banana nuclear genome. Teo et al. [38] identified a
Ty1/copia-like element in the 5S rDNA spacer in several
banana species. The analysis of retrotransposon protein
coding domains in our data confirmed that the 5S
rDNA spacer contained a part of the reverse transcriptase of the Tnt1-like element.
Tandem organized repeats

Repeat reconstruction from the 454 data led to discovery of two new tandemly organized repeats. One of
them (CL33) consists of ~130 bp monomer while the
CL18 repeat is characterized by ~2 kb monomer unit.
FISH on mitotic chromosomes revealed clusters of signals in the subtelomeric regions of one pair of chromosomes (satellite CL18) and weak signals in telomeric
region on two pairs of chromosomes (satellite CL33)
(Figures 3A, B, C). Southern hybridization resulted in a
ladder-like pattern typical for tandemly organized repetitive units for repeat CL33, only (not shown). The repeat
CL18 gave a weak smear with a few visible bands, most
likely due to partially dispersed distribution and/or poor
conservation of the monomer length. A rather low copy
number of CL33 and/or long repetitive unit of satellite
CL18 may explain why these repeats were not identified
in previous studies [5,6]. In general, the absence of
more abundant tandem repeats in the banana genome
may be related to its relatively small size. Satellite DNA
is a typical component of subtelomeric and centromeric
chromosome regions in various plant species, but they
often form blocks of repeats in interstitial regions
[15,39-42]. The results of this study, as well as our earlier observations [5,6] indicate that typical centromeric
satellite DNA is absent in the banana genome, and that
the centromeric regions are likely to be made of various
types of retrotransposons.
Identification of DNA markers

Following the thorough characterization of banana repetitive DNA, we screened the 454 sequences for the presence of loci potentially suitable for use as DNA
markers. We focused on identification of simple

Page 5 of 10

sequence repeats (SSRs) and sites of insertions of transposable elements (ISBP - Insertion Site Based Polymorphism) [43]. In total, 27,946 of 454 reads containing
SSRs were identified with repeat units ranging from 2 to
10 bp. The most abundant motifs were dinucleotides
TA and GA and trinucleotides GAA (Figure 4). More
than 11,000 reads were identified to contain potential
ISBP sites, most of them carrying insertions of retrotransposons into unknown low-copy sequences. Databases containing 454 reads carrying SSR sequences and
potential ISBPs were established and made publicly
available on our website [44].
Repeat identification in sequenced DNA clones

As the next step in utilizing 454 data, we took advantage
of the read clustering during repeat analysis and created
databases of sequence reads sorted according to their
repeat of origin. These databases were then utilized for
similarity-based repeat detection and classification in
genomic BAC clone sequences implemented at the
PROFREP server [45]. The analysis was performed for
49 BAC clones from M. acuminata cv. ‘Calcutta 4′ and
for 12 BAC clones from M. balbisiana cv. ‘Pisang Klutug Wulung’ [14]. The clones were sequenced as part of
the Generation Challenge Program supported project
(GCP-2005-15) and were selected based on the presence
of resistance gene homologs and other gene-like
sequences. Indeed, out of the 49 M. acuminata BAC
clones, only 9 clones were highly repetitive. 15 BAC
clones contained a single copy sequence with a large
repetitive region and the remaining BAC clones comprised single copy sequence without any detectable repetitive DNA and/or carried a very short repetitive region
(Figure 5). Out of the 12 BAC clones from M. balbisiana, two were single copy, while the remaining 10 BAC
clones carried low copy sequences mixed with large
repetitive regions. The repetitive profiles of all 62 BAC
clones are available as supplementary data (Additional
file 2).

Conclusions
This work represents a major advance in the analysis of
the nuclear genome organization in banana, an important staple and cash crop. The application of low-depth
454 sequencing provided until now the largest amount
of DNA sequence data, and enabled a detailed analysis
of repetitive components of its nuclear genome. All
major types of DNA repeats were characterized and
Musa DNA repeats databases were established. The analysis of genomic distribution of selected repeats provided
new data on long-range molecular organization of
banana chromosomes, and a large number of loci potentially useful as DNA markers were identified. The
improved knowledge and resources generated in this

study will be useful in annotating the banana genome
sequence, in the analysis of the evolution of the Musa
genome, and for the study of dynamics of DNA repeats
over evolutionary time scale, as well as to isolate DNA
markers for use in genetic diversity studies and in marker-assisted selection.

Methods
454 sequencing

In vitro rooted plants of M. acuminata cv. ‘Calcutta 4′
(ITC 0249) were obtained from the International Transit
Centre (Bioversity International, Global Musa Genebank
hosted by the Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium)
and grown in a greenhouse. DNA for sequencing was
prepared from nuclei isolated from healthy young leaf
tissues according to Zhang et al. (1995) [46]. Isolated
nuclei were incubated with 40 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS
and 0.25 μg/μl proteinase K for 5 hours at 37°C, and
DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform precipitation.
The 454 sequencing was performed at the Arizona
Genomics Institute (Tucson, USA) using 454 Life
Sciences/Roche FLX instrument. All sequence information generated in this study are available on our website
[44] and was submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information short read archive under accession numbers SRR057410 and SRR057411.
Data analysis

Following a removal of linker/primer contaminations
and artificially duplicated reads, the remaining 477,699
reads (average length of 206 nucleotides) were used for
repeat analysis. The analysis was performed as described
by Macas et al. (2007) [15], employing TGICL [47] and
a set of custom-made BioPerl scripts for similarity-based
clustering and assembly of reads. The clustering parameters used by a tclust program (part of TGICL) were

set to consider pairwise similarity of two reads significant if it involved an overlap of at least 150 nucleotides
with 90% or better similarity, representing at least 55%
and 70% of the length of longer and shorter read respectively (OVL = 150 PID = 90 LCOV = 55 SCOV = 70).
The reads within individual clusters were assembled
into contigs using TGICL run with the -O ‘-p 80 -o 40′
parameters, specifying overlap percent identity and
minimal length cutoff for cap3 assembler. Repeat type
identification was done using blastn and blastx [48]
sequence-similarity searches of assembled contigs
against GenBank, and by detection of conserved protein
domains, using RPS-BLAST [49]. Tandem repeats within
contig sequences were identified using dotter [50]. The
classification of LTR retrotransposons into distinct
lineages and clades was done using phylogenetic analyses of their RT sequences [15]. Alignment of RT
sequences was carried out with ClustalX [51] and the
phylogenetic trees were calculated using neighbour-joining method. The trees were drawn and edited using the
FigTree program.
Microsatellite sequences were identified using Tandem
Repeats Finder [52] and TRAP [53] programs, while a
BioPerl script was used to identify ISBP loci [54]. Identification and classification of repetitive sequences within
BAC clones was done via PROFREP web server [45] utilizing repeat-specific databases of 454 reads prepared in
this study. The server performs BLAST-based searches
against databases of whole-genome or repeat-specific
454 reads and generates plots of similarity hits along the
query sequence (number of hits is proportional to copy
number of the query in the genome).
Preparation of probes for cytogenetic mapping

Primers specific for tandem repeats (Additional file 3)
were designed from sequence contigs that carry tandem

organized repetitive units. Labeled probes were prepared
by PCR on M. acuminata ’Calcutta 4′ genomic DNA
with biotin- and digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides. The
PCR premix contained 1× PCR buffer, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2
mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM primers, 0.5 U Taq polymerase
(Finnzymes) and 10 - 15 ng template DNA. PCR reaction was performed as follows: initial denaturation of
3 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C,
50 s at 57°C and 50 s at 72°C and final extension step
5 min at 72°C.
Specific primers were also designed for reverse transcriptase (RT) domains of different retroelements
(Additional file 3). In the first step, the RT domains
were amplified using PCR with a mix containing 1×
PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM
primers, 0.5 U Taq polymerase (Finnzymes) and 10 15 ng template DNA. PCR products were checked by
gel-electrophoresis, cleaned up using paramagnetic
beads Agencourt Ampure (Beckman Coulter), cloned
into TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into
electro-competent E. coli cells. 48 recombinant clones
for each retroelement were PCR amplified using M13
primers and separated on the gel electrophoresis.
Clones for each RT domain were than cleaned up
using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation), and used for
Sanger sequencing to verify presence of specific RT
domains in the clones. The PCR products were
sequenced with BigDye Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) on ABI 3730xl DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide
sequences were analyzed and edited using the Staden
Package [55], and searched for similarity with the corresponding 454 contigs using BLAST [48]. Clones with
the highest similarity to reconstructed contigs were
PCR amplified with biotin- and digoxigenin-labeled
nucleotides and used as probes for fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Selected clones used as probes showed
at least 98% similarity with the corresponding 454
sequence.

FISH was done on mitotic metaphase spreads prepared
from meristem root tip cells as described by Doleželová
et al. (1998) [56]. The hybridization mixture consisted
of 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate in 1 × SSC and
a 1 μg/ml labeled probe. The mixture was added onto
slides and denatured at 80°C for 4 min. The hybridization was carried out at 37°C overnight. The sites of
probe hybridization were detected using anti-digoxigenin-FITC (Roche Applied Science) and streptavidinCy3 (Vector Laboratories), and the chromosomes were
counterstained with DAPI. The slides were examined
with Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope
