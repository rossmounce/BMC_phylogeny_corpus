Abstract
Background: Hox genes code for homeodomain-containing transcription factors that function in
cell fate determination and embryonic development. Hox genes are arranged in clusters with up to
14 genes. This archetypical chordate cluster has duplicated several times in vertebrates, once at the
origin of vertebrates and once at the origin of gnathostoms, an additional duplication event is
associated with the origin of teleosts and the agnanths, suggesting that duplicated Hox cluster genes
are involved in the genetic mechanisms behind the diversification of vertebrate body plans, and the
origin of morphological novelties. Preservation of duplicate genes is promoted by functional
divergence of paralogs, either by subfunction partitioning among paralogs or the acquisition of a
novel function by one paralog. But for Hox genes the mechanisms of paralog divergence is
unknown, leaving open the role of Hox gene duplication in morphological evolution.
Results: Here, we use several complementary methods, including branch-specific dN/dS ratio tests,
branch-site dN/dS ratio tests, clade level amino acid conservation/variation patterns, and relative
rate ratio tests, to show that the homeodomain of Hox genes was under positive Darwinian
selection after cluster duplications.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that positive selection acted on the homeodomain immediately
after Hox clusters duplications. The location of sites under positive selection in the homeodomain
suggests that they are involved in protein-protein interactions. These results further suggest that
adaptive evolution actively contributed to Hox-gene homeodomain functions.

Background
The homeobox codes for a highly conserved 60 amino
acid DNA-binding motif (the homeodomain) found in
transcription factors [1]. One class of homeobox-containing transcription factor genes are the Hox genes, which are
homologous to the genes in the Drosophila homeotic
(HOM) gene cluster, that specify cell fate during embryonic development [1] and have derived functions in other

tissues [2]. Multiple Hox genes located in tightly linked
clusters have been identified in all animal phyla examined, with the archetypical chordate cluster having 14
genes (Hox1–Hox14) [3]. The number of Hox clusters has
increased several times in vertebrate evolution: the cluster
duplicated twice in early vertebrates leading to four clusters (HoxA-D) with 42 genes [4,5] and additional cluster
duplications in teleost fish led to 7–8 clusters with 45–47

genes [6,7]. Independent duplications have also occurred
in the jawless vertebrates hagfish [8] and lamprey [9].
Models of duplicate gene preservation predict functional
differentiation of paralogs based on protein sequence or
regulatory divergence [10,11]. Although numerous models of duplicate gene divergence have been proposed, four
different mechanisms of functional divergence are likely
to explain preservation of duplicate Hox genes: acquisition of novel functions by one paralog (neo-functionalization) [12], passive erosion of functional redundancy
due to complementary degenerative mutations, (subfunctionalization) [11], models that predict the accumulation of neutral mutations, which later acquire functional
constraints because the environment or genetic background changes (the Dykhuizen-Hartl effect) [13] or
divergent adaptive selection of both paralogs (adaptive
diversification) [14]. This list has recently been expanded
by the introduction of the subneofunctionalization [15]
and the adaptive radiation [16] models that predict rapid
subfunctionalization after duplication followed by a prolonged period of neofunctionalization and adaptive
divergence of duplicate genes in a process analogous to
species radiations, respectively. Here, we are interested in
testing whether positive selection acted immediately after
cluster duplications to promote functional divergence and
identify which mechanisms discussed above most adequately explain the preservation of Hox duplicates in vertebrates.
How paralogus Hox genes have been retained is not
known, although evidence suggestive of positive selection
after cluster duplication has been identified in Hox7 [17],
Hox5 and Hox6 [18] paralogs. In these studies, however,
it is not clear whether directional selection was responsible for the maintenance of the duplicated genes or other
mechanisms promoted the maintenance of duplicates
[19]. In addition, evidence for positive selection immediately after Hox cluster duplications has recently been identified in teleost fish for HoxA-11 and HoxB-5 [20]. These
data suggest that, in the evolution of ray-finned fishes,
some duplicate Hox genes have been preserved by functional differentiation through the action of positive Darwinian selection immediately following the gene
duplication. This suggests that Hox genes may have also
experienced adaptive evolution following the cluster
duplications earlier in vertebrate evolution.
Hox cluster duplication and gene diversification has been
proposed to be one of the genetic mechanisms behind the
diversification of vertebrates and body plans and the origin of morphological novelties [21-23]. This association,
however, is difficult to reconcile with the perceived degree
of sequence conservation between the homeodomains of
Hox genes and the numerous examples of functional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/86

equivalence of Hox/Hom genes from strikingly divergent
organisms [24-28]. Mouse HoxA-5, for example, is able to
activate the same target genes as its Drosophila homolog,
Sex combs reduced (Src), in axis determination indicating
strong conservation of function over 500 to 600 million
years [29], but counter examples also exist, showing functional non-equivalence of Ubx orthologs from fairy
shrimp, velvet worm and Drosophila [30] and non-equivalence of homeodomains from HoxA-4, HoxA-10, HoxA11 and HoxA-13 paralogs from mouse [31,32].
In this paper we investigate the sequence divergence in
homeoboxes from the four gnathostome Hox clusters,
including genes from basal vertebrates and sarcopterygians like shark and coelacanth, respectively. This is the
first study of homeodomain divergence with extensive
taxon sampling allowing us to identify the relative phylogenetic age of substitution events in vertebrate phylogeny.
We use three different, but complementary, approaches to
test for functional divergence among paralogs: comparison of patterns of amino acid sequence conservation/variation among paralog clades, dN/dS ratio tests to detect
directional selection and identify positive sites, and comparison of clade level polymorphisms/divergence rates.
Our results indicate that after cluster duplication positive
Darwinian selection acted on the homeodomain of Hox
proteins prior to the divergence of the modern gnathostome and bony fish lineages. We find amino acid substitutions at sites that are not involved in structural
constraints and are located on the molecular surface
where they are available for protein-protein interactions
were targets of positive selection. We suggest that the
action of positive selection at a subset of sites not constrained by ancestral (plesiomorphic) functions after cluster duplications led to the emergence of novel protein
interactions while maintaining ancestral ones. This model
can help reconcile the role of Hox genes in morphological
diversification and innovation with their extreme
sequence conservation.

Results and discussion
Functional divergence of paralog-group homeodomains
We compiled a database of Hox genes with 4–5 species for
each gene (155 sequences in total) and compared conserved and variable sites between paralog group members
to identify if there are characteristic residues that distinguish which cluster a paralog belongs to (for example, see
Figure 1). This analysis identified many sites that are conserved among species but variable between genes in the
same paralog group ('cluster-specific' residues; Figure 2).
Although the homeodomain is a highly conserved motif,
it is not invariant; in fact only 17 residues are absolutely
conserved between all vertebrate Hox genes in our alignment, suggesting that variable sites could be functionally
divergent. Many of these variable sites have been previ-

ously shown to be 'characteristic residues' that distinguish
paralog groups from each other and have been suggested
to be engaged in protein-protein interactions [33].
To test if 'cluster-specific' residues are functionally divergent we estimated the coefficient of functional divergence
(θ), which measures the difference in evolutionary rate at
amino acid sites between gene clusters. Rejection of the
null hypothesis (θ = 0) is strong evidence for altered functional constraints after gene duplication (or speciation)
[34]. We found significant evidence of type-I functional
divergence for comparisons between HoxA, HoxB, and
HoxD clusters (θI = 0.24–0.37, p < 0.05; Figure 3) under
the ((AD)(BC)) topology and under the (B(A(CD)))
topology (θI = 0.271–0.396, p < 0.05; Figure 3) at sites that
differentiate paralog groups. We also found evidence of
functional divergence of the HoxB cluster from the protoHoxACD cluster after the initial duplication event predicted under the (B(A(CD))) model (θI = 0.221 ± 0.07, p
< 0.05; Figure 3). Results were not significant for comparisons between HoxC and any other cluster (θI = 0.001–
0.029) under either duplication model. Comparisons
between HoxB and HoxA to protoBC under the
(B(A(CD))) model and protoAD to protoBC under the
((AD)(BC)) model, θI(B(A(CD))) = 0.138–134 and
θI((AD)(BC)) = 0.001, respectively, were not significant.
Type-I sites are defined as those with an amino acid that is
conserved in one clade but variable in the sister clade,
implying that the site is under structural/functional constraints in the first clade that is absent in the variable clade
[34]. Type-I sites are located in the amino- and carboxy
terminal ends of the homeodomain (outside of the 3 helPS

and in loop connecting helix 2 and 3.
Recently, a method has been developed to test for type-II
functional divergence [35]. Type-II sites are those that are
highly conserved in both clades but are fixed for amino
acids with different biochemical properties between sister
clades, implying these residues are responsible for functional differences between these groups. Although all paralog groups had at least one site with evidence of type-II
divergence, all of which were radical amino acid substitutions (defined as a change in polarity or charge, but not
size) of surface residues, the θII values are extremely small
(θII = 0.001–0.062), highlighting the conservation
between homeodomains from different clusters. These
results are not unexpected given that this method calculates θ across all sites in an alignment and thus effectively
averages site-wise θ values. With only ~4% of sites/cluster
showing a pattern of type-II divergence in our concatenated alignment, it is not likely that the ~46 possible typeII sites have θII values high enough to compensate for the
extremely low θII values of the over 900 sites with θII effectively equal to zero.
Accelerated evolution of homeodomains after cluster
duplication
Several models of molecular evolution have been proposed to account for the preservation of duplicate genes.
Although the details of each model can vary (see introduction), they differ in their predictions regarding the pattern
of sequence evolution following gene duplication. The

predict that the nonsynonymous substitution rate will be
increased following gene duplication because of positive
Darwinian selection in the gene acquiring the new function, while the Dykhuizen-Hartl and DDC models predict
and increase in the substitution rate because of relaxed
purifying selection. It is possible to distinguish between
these models by comparing nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rate (dN/dS = ω) with ω = 1, <1,
and >1 indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection
and directional selection.
Unlike the functional divergence methods developed by
Gu [36,37], estimating selection using the dN/dS ratio is,
by definition, dependent on the degree of divergence of
the sequences under study. Thus, short sequences with a
high degree of amino acid conservation but substantial
synonymous site divergence may not contain enough sig-

nal to reliably obtain estimates of dN and dS. We assessed
whether homeodomain sequences contained sufficient
information for reliable rate estimates by examining the
tree length statistic S, the number of nucleotide substitutions per codon. For individual paralog groups S range
from 6.3–13.3 (average = 10.00), with tree length dN averaging 1.2 substitutions per nonsynonymous site and tree
length dS averaging 18 substitutions per synonymous site
along the tree. Interestingly, simulation studies [38] have
shown that at levels of sequence divergence similar to our
datasets, use of the χ2 made the likelihood ratio test statistic (LRT) extremely conservative such that the type-I error
rate is very small. Similarly, the power of the LRT to reject
the null hypothesis even when it is false (type-II error) was
found to be conservative even at medium to high levels of
sequence divergence [38]. The power of the LRT increases
as the number of sequences increases such that at 17 taxa

power is nearly 100% [38], suggesting that our inclusion
of at least 8–12 sequences (depending on the paralog
group) helped alleviate loss of power from short conserved sequences. The simulation study results indicated
that the optimal sequence divergence depends on the
dataset and appears to be within the medium-to-high
range [38]. Our data indicate that results based on estimates of dN and dS from this homeodomain dataset are
reliable, if conservative.

detect positive selection are particularly important for
studying selective forces after Hox cluster duplications
since very few sites (less than 15%) changed after duplication and the duplication events are relative ancient (about
560 MYA; ref), leading to substantial synonymous site
divergence. Thus, even though we found evidence of
accelerated rates of sequence evolution post cluster duplication, it is unlikely that the dN/dS ratio tests used above
would be able to detect positive selection (ω > 1).

To estimate the strength and kind of selection acting on
Hox gene homeodomains, we used maximum likelihood
methods to estimate the nonsysnonymous (dN) to sysnonymous (dS) substitution rate ratio [39,40]. The one
ratio model is the simplest and provides a measure of the
average strength and direction of selection acting on the
gene throughout its history and can test if there was an
increase in the rate of evolution after Hox cluster duplications. As expected, the dN/dS ratio for the homeodomains
of all paralog groups is much less than 1 (0.0033–0.0359)
highlighting the dominant role purifying selection plays
on Hox gene evolution. To test if there was an increase in
the nonsynonymous substitution rate following Hox cluster duplication we used a two ratios model that estimated
separate ω's for post cluster duplication (ωPCD) and post
speciation (ωPS) branches. Post cluster duplication
branches evolved significantly faster (3–27x) than post
speciation branches for 10 of 13 paralog groups; the
remaining 3 paralog groups had ωPCD > ωPS but the results
were not significant (Table 1). A more complex model
that allowed each post duplication lineage to have separate dN/dS ratios from each other (the paralog 6 group for
example: ωPCD-A6, ωPCD-B6 and ωPCD-C6) and post speciation (ωPS) branches was not better than the simple tworatio model indicating that paralogs experienced similar
selective forces after cluster duplication. These results are
consistent with previous data from Hox5, Hox6 and Hox7
and indicate there was a period of rapid evolution of the
homeodomain after Hox cluster duplication that could
have been the result of either positive Darwinian selection
or relaxed purifying selection.

One complementary method that has been developed to
compensate for some of limitations of the dN/dS ratio is
the relative rate ratio test of Creevey and McInerney [41],
which is an extension of the contingency test of neutrality
proposed by Templeton [42] and McDonald and Kreitman [43]. Briefly, this method reconstructs ancestral
sequences for each node in a phylogenetic tree using parsimony and identifies all substitutions that result in nonsynonymous and synonymous changes for each node.
Substitutions are classified as replacement invariable (RI,
i.e. nonsynonymous substitutions that are not substituted
again in descendent lineages), replacement variable (RV,
i.e. nonsynonymous substitutions that are substituted
again in descendent lineages), silent invariable (SI, i.e.
synonymous substitutions that are not substituted again
in descendent lineages) and silent variable (RV, i.e. synonymous substitutions that are substituted again in descendent lineages).

Adaptive evolution of homeodomains after cluster
duplication: Relative rate ratio tests
Although positive selection at the molecular level is most
often tested using the dN/dS ratio, this method has several
inherent limitations. The most problematic of which is
when positive selection is acting at a limited number of
sites while the majority are under strong purifying selection. Under these conditions dN will never become larger
than dS and the signal for positive selection will be
masked. In addition, when there is a large amount of
sequence divergence between two nodes in a tree (site saturation) the accuracy of dS, and to a lesser extent dN, is
greatly reduced. These two limitations of the dN/dS ratio to

Under neutral evolution the ratio of RI/RV will not be significantly different from SI/SV. Similarly, a period of
relaxed purifying selection may increase RI/RV relative to
SI/SV, but RI/RV will never be significantly greater than
the neutral expectation given by SI/SV since the rate of
replacement substitution can only exceed the rate of silent
(neutral) substitution under positive selection. During an
episode of positive selection, advantageous substitutions
will become fixed in a lineage and remain invariant in
descendent lineages, elevating the ratio of RI/RV relative
to the neutral expectation given by SI/SV. Thus, when lineages are identified with a significantly greater RI/RV than
SI/SV positive selection is indicated.
Using the relative rate ratio test to examine selective forces
after cluster duplications identified that post-duplication
lineages under the ((AD)(BC)) and the (B(A(CD))) models had significantly larger RI/RV than SI/SV (Figure 3 and
Tables 2 and 3), indicating these duplication events were
followed by adaptive evolution and supporting the results
obtained with the dN/dS ratio tests and further suggesting
that the increase in rates identified from the dN/dS ratio
were due to positive selection.

Adaptive evolution of homeodomains after cluster
duplication: dN/dS
The lineage-specific dN/dS model utilized above has been
extended to account for variable dN/dS between sites and
can detect positive selection at specific sites in specific lineages under appropriate conditions [44,45]. These
branch-site models are ideal for detecting short episodes
of positive selection that acted on a few sites while the
majority of sites in the protein remained under purifying
selection, as is likely to have occurred in the homeodomain after Hox cluster duplication. Applying branchsite models and to post cluster duplication (ωPCD)

branches identified sites under positive selection after
cluster duplication (Figure 3) in paralog groups 1–6, 9
and 13 (Table 4). Positive Sites were identified with posterior probabilities (PP) greater than 0.90 using the both
the liberal Neive Empircal Bayes (NEB) and the more conservative Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) methods implemented in PAML3.15, although only the result of the BEB
method is shown. In addition, two genes in the Hox3, 5,
6, and 13 paralog groups have evidence of positive selection, but the results are not statistically significant. The
sites identified under positive selection are the same as
those that show evidence of type-II functional divergence

and map onto the molecular surface of the homeodomain, facing away from the DNA and in an orientation
that would facilitate protein-protein interactions (Figure
2).
While no sites under positive selection were identified in
paralog groups 7, 8 and 10–12, a class of sites in each was
identified with ω = 1 (Table 4). Given that the ability of
likelihood models to detect sites with ω > 1 is an
extremely difficult computational problem, it is possible
that these sites actually experienced positive selection, but
that the models are not able to identify ω > 1. An equally
likely explanation that does not invoke positive selection

is that the ω = 1 is an accurate estimate for the rate at this
sites, and is actually indicative of relaxed functional constraints after duplication, that the sites have not been substituted again indicates they under strong purifying
selection in post-speciation lineages, supporting a Dykhuizen-Hartl mechanism for their evolution.
The structural basis of homeodomain evolution
To gain a better understanding of how functional constraints on the homeodomain relate to sequence divergence, we generated a sequence logo [46,47] from the
multiple sequence alignment of Hox-gene homeodomains and mapped the location of sites under positive

region also overlaps with the Sp1 transactivation region
[52]. In addition to characterized protein-protein interactions, the repressor domain also contains the majority of
'characteristic-residues' that distinguish cognate groups
from each other indicating the majority of sites in this
region were already under functional constraints after the
tandem duplications which created the Hox gene cluster
and were not available to be targets of adaptive selection
after cluster duplication. Interestingly, the first 3 sites of
the geminin-binding region were under directional selection in different paralog groups, including radical amino

acid substitutions, suggesting selection to modulate geminin binding between paralog group members.
Mapping functionally divergent amino acid sites and sites
under positive selection in and around helix-2 onto the
logo and crystal structure shows that purifying selection
has acted to preserve hydrophobic/aliphatic residues critical for the nuclear exportation signal [53] and positive
selection has acted exclusively on sites that occur at the
molecular surface. These sites form a small cluster at the
posterior end of helix-2 in a prime location for protein-

protein interactions. Beyond the ultra-conserved helix-3,
which also contains the nuclear localization signal [54],
sites under positive selection have been identified in an
unstructured connecting loop leading to additional structures in the carboxy terminus. The amino-terminal arm of
the homeodomain, which confers functional specificity
on Hox proteins, contains the majority of sites under positive selection suggesting that selection has acted to modify functional specificity between paralogs. This region
appears to be unstructured and is a prime target for protein-protein interaction sites. This pattern of purifying and
positive selection suggests that after Hox cluster duplications, selection acted on protein-protein interaction sites
in such a way that ancestral functions were maintained
while the acquisition of novel protein interaction partners
driven was driven by selection on non-constrained amino
acids. These derived interactions could be those responsible for novel Hox gene functions in vertebrates.

Conclusion
The homeodomain serves multiple functions in addition
to DNA-binding, including containing nuclear localization and export signals, transcriptional activation and
repression domains and other protein-protein interaction
sites [33,54]. These functions combine to impose severe
limitations on the degree of sequence divergence that can
be accommodated by the homeodomain of Hox genes.
Even with these constraints, however, the relatively small
set of amino acids that were free to diverge after cluster
duplication were subject to positive selection. Although
the Hox cluster duplications are relatively ancient (450
MYA), complicating the detection of positive selection, we
find congruence between multiple methods a strong indicating that our results are reliable. These results support an
important role for the action of positive Darwinian selection in the divergence of Hox genes after cluster duplications, particularly at sites that distinguish paralog groups
('cluster-specific' residues).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/86

protein interactions (effectively reducing degeneracy
between paralogs) leading to new gene functions.

Methods
The homeodomain of Hox genes was identified from
BLAST searches of the nr database at NCBI. At least four
members of each gene from diverse taxa were included in
the dataset. The sequences were aligned based on the
translated amino acid sequences with Se-Al v2.0, alignments were simple given the high degree of sequence conservation within paralog groups. Regions of ambiguous
alignment just outside of the homeodomain but within
exon 2 were excluded. Most alignments ranged from 70–
82 amino acids. The alignment is available from V.J.L. and
has been deposited in TREEBASE.
We used codon-based maximum likelihood models of
coding sequence evolution implemented in CODEML in
the PAML package of programs (version 3.15) to test for
lineages and amino acid sites under positive selection.
Sites were classified as being under positive selection if
they were identified from the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB)
method with a posterior probability of greater than 0.90.
The branching order of the Hox cluster duplications is still
debated (refs), but our analyses suggest that the most
likely topologies are ((AD)(BC)) and (B(A(CD))) (a
detailed analysis of Hox cluster duplication history is
beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere). We used 2 alternate trees to test for selection:
((AD)(BC)) and (B(A(CD))) and found no significant differences between the results of these different topologies.
Functional divergence was tested with DIVERGE alpha1.2
(obtained from X. Gu). We also used the relative rate ratio
test of Creevey and McInerny [41] implemented in the
program CRANN to test for adaptive evolution. Both
DIVERGE and CRANN analyses used the 2 alternate
topologies discussed above.

Authors' contributions
Nearly all 'cluster-specific' residues map onto the molecular surface of the homeodomain, similar to the paralog
group specific sites [33], suggesting changes in amino acid
properties could influence interaction of the homeodomain with other proteins. Cofactor associations are
important for Hox proteins and most other transcription
factor functions; these protein-protein interactions occur
at the molecular surface through the formation of hydrophobic and ionic bonds and other intermolecular interactions such as salt bridges and van der Vaals forces. Thus,
changes in the physicochemical properties of amino acids
participating in these bonds could disrupt preexisting
interactions and/or lead to new interactions. These
changes could provide a selective advantage for maintaining duplicate genes through the origin of novel protein-
