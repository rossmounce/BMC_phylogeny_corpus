Phylogenetic and coalescent analysis of three loci
suggest that the Water Rail is divisible into two
species, Rallus aquaticus and R. indicus
Erika S Tavares1*†, Gerard HJ de Kroon2†, Allan J Baker1,3†

Abstract
Background: Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus) inhabit fragmented freshwater wetlands across their Palearctic
distribution. Disjunct populations are now thought to be morphologically similar over their vast geographic range,
though four subspecies had been recognized previously. The fossil record suggests that Water Rails (R. aquaticus)
were already spread across the Palearctic by the Pleistocene ~2 million years ago, and the oldest fossil remains
thought to be closely related to the common ancestor of water rails date from the Pliocene.
Results: To investigate population structure in Water Rails at the genetic level we sequenced three independent loci:
686 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial DNA COI barcode; 618 bp of the intron ADH5; and 746 bp of the exon
PTPN12. Phylogeographic analysis revealed that Water Rails breeding in eastern Asia (R. a. indicus, also known as the
Brown-cheeked Rail) are strongly differentiated from the Water Rails in Western and Middle Asia and Europe
(R. a. aquaticus and R. a. korejewi). The Kimura 3-parameter plus Gamma COI genetic distance between these two
geographic groups was > 3%, and they differed by 18 diagnostic substitutions commensurate with differences
between recently diverged sister species of birds. In spite of the low number of variable sites, the two nuclear loci
supported this split. We estimated the split of the Brown-cheeked Rail and the Water Rail to have occurred ~534,000
years ago (95% CI 275,000-990,000 years ago). Fragmentation of the widespread ancestral population and eventual
speciation of water rails is likely attributable to vicariance by a barrier formed by glacial cycles, continuous uplift of
the Tibetan Plateau and increased sedimentation in deserts in southern Asia that originated in the Miocene.
Conclusions: Water Rails from East Asia were genetically differentiated from the ones breeding in Europe and
Western to Middle Asia. Most of the genetic signal was from mitochondrial COI, and was corroborated by
polymorphic sites in the two nuclear loci we employed. The split between these two lineages was estimated to
occur in the Middle Pleistocene, when populations were isolated in disjunct wetlands with little or no gene flow.
Independent evidence from differences in morphology and vocalizations in concert with genetic differentiation
and a long history of isolation support recognition of the Brown-cheeked Rail breeding in East Asia as a separate
species, R. indicus. The use of several independent loci is invaluable in inferring species trees from gene trees and
in recognizing species limits.

Background
The use of genetic data as a complement to morphological and behavioral data is now common in addressing
the problem of species delimitation. Although single
mitochondrial genes such as COI used in DNA barcoding have proved highly effective in species delimitation

in animals and plants [1,2], it is important test
hypotheses of putative species with independent nuclear
loci. For recently diverged species, lineage sorting can
be incomplete and widespread in genomes, but new
coalescent methods exist that can help to detect signals
of species even before lineages have become reciprocally
monophyletic [3]. Although gene trees can be discordant
and complicate the recovery of species trees, they can
also be concordant and provide strong support for
species delimitation.

One example of taxonomic uncertainty in recently
diverged lineages is provided by Water Rails (R. aquaticus), which are distributed widely in the Palearctic wetlands from Iceland to Japan, and occupy a range of
approximately 10 million km2. The global population is
thought to be large, with an estimated 290,000-730,000
individuals in their European distribution [4]. Water
Rails are confined to wetlands, which have contracted in
recent history, and thus their populations are now strikingly fragmented (Figure 1). Further distributional complexity arises because southern and western European
populations are mainly sedentary, whereas northernmost
European and East Asian populations migrate between
northern breeding grounds and southern wintering
areas [5].
Taxonomic uncertainty exists about the number of
species or subspecies that might be recognized in the
water rails complex. Some authors suggested that water
rails form a superspecies complex with the Kaffir Rail

(R. caerulensis) and Madagascar Rail (R. madasgascariensis) due to similarities in size, coloration, and the
startling calls they share [6-8].
Water Rails had previously been placed in four
subspecies differentiated by morphological variation and
geographic range: R. a. aquaticus in Europe including
the British Isles, Northern Africa to North-western Asia;
R. a. hibernans in Iceland; R. a. korejewi in Western to
Middle Asia, and R. a. indicus in Eastern Asia, including
Japan [5,7]. However, recent morphological studies supported subspecies status (R. a. indicus) for Eastern
Asian birds [9,10], but could not detect differences
between the other three subspecies. R. a. korejewi and
R. a. hibernans differ by small variations in external
plumage and measurements that overlap gradually from
west to east. The Icelandic population of R. a. hibernans
became extinct about 1965 due to widespread draining
of wetlands and predation by Mink (Mustela vison), and
now non-breeding birds probably from Scandinavia

migrate to Iceland in autumn and winter [11]. Birds
from East Asian populations are distinguished from
those in West and Middle Asia and Europe by proportionally larger dimensions, less sexual dimorphism is
size, less contrastingly banded flanks, black-and-whitebarred under tails coverts (white in the other populations), darker tip of the neck and breast feathers, higher
percentage of barred outer coverts in the wing, and a
whiter supercilium above a brown eye-stripe [9,12]. A
recent classification therefore referred to this lineage
with a distinct common name as the Brown-cheeked
Rail (R. a. indicus), reflecting differences from the other
Water Rail subspecies (R. a. aquaticus and R. a. korejewi) [13], and hereafter we use these vernaculars and
refer to them collectively as water rails.
The oldest fossil remains of a rail which is the closest
relative to the ancestor of all water rails are phalange
bones found in caves in the Carpathian basin dated from
the Pliocene (5.3-1.8 Million Years; International Stratigraphic Chart, ISC) [14,15]. More recent fossils from the
Upper Pleistocene suggest that water rails were already
widely distributed two million years ago; fossils have
been found in Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, France,
Italy, Cyprus, Germany, Poland, Austria, Croatia, BosniaHerzegovina, Hungary, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Romania, Greece, Jordan, Israel, China and Japan [16]. Climate
and environmental changes associated with the last four
ice ages, along with tectonic activities that occurred in
Europe and Asia, could potentially have had a great
impact on water rail populations. The association of particular historical events with population differentiation
and possibly speciation requires inference of the species
tree, divergence times and levels of gene flow.
In the present study we investigate the phylogeny and
population structure of the water rail species-complex
using three independent loci, including the COI DNA barcode region. Specifically, we investigate whether genetic
evidence supports the Brown-cheeked Rail and Water Rail

as separate species, the number of subspecies that should
be recognized, and whether phylogeographic patterns
within the water rail complex relate to known historical
events that may have structured populations genetically.

Results
Genetic variation and base composition

The numbers of base pairs (bp) sequenced for COI,
ADH5, and PTPN12 were respectively 686, 618 and 746,
yielding a combined data set of 2,050 bp. The number
of individuals sequenced for each population varied, but
sequences for all three genes were determined for
58 water rails, and two Virginia rails (Rallus limicola,
Table 1). Translation of the protein-coding genes COI
and PTPN12 did not reveal stop codons or frame-shift
mutations, and third codon positions were more variable
than first and second codon positions as expected in
functional genes. Three indels of one or two bases were
observed in the ADH5 intron. Polymorphism due to heterozygosity was observed in the nuclear partitions ADH5
and PTPN12. The average base composition among
water rails for each gene partition was 26.1% A, 33.4%
C, 16.7% G, 23.8% T for COI; 25.8% A, 20.1% C, 22.3%
G, 31.8% T for ADH5; and 29.1% A, 24.2% C, 23% G,
23.7% T for PTPN12. Best-fit models of nucleotide substitution selected with the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) were unequal-frequency Kimura 3-parameter plus
Gamma (K81uf + G = 0.1704) for COI, and HasegawaKishino-Yano (HKY) for ADH5 and PTPN12.
A total of 17 unique haplotypes defined by 32 variable
sites was identified in sequences from mitochondrial
COI of 73 specimens of Brown-cheeked and Water Rails
(Figure 2A). Sequences from phased genotypes of ADH5
and PTPN12 revealed 10 and six variable sites identifying 12 and nine unique haplotypes in each nuclear gene,
respectively (Figure 2B, C). The Brown-cheeked Rail and
the Water Rail did not share alleles for the three genes
studied, except for one allele (P2) in the most slowly

Phylogenetic analysis and relationship among breeding
populations

Monophyletic groups of Brown-cheeked Rails and Water
Rails were recovered in ML and Bayesian analyses of
COI (N = 73) and ADH5 (N = 59), with a posterior
probability of 1 for clusters in COI (Additional file 1).
Analyses of PTPN12 (N = 59) revealed a monophyletic
group composed of all sampled individuals of the
Brown-cheeked Rail, but node support was lower (0.89,
Additional file 1). Reciprocal monophyly of Browncheeked Rails and Water Rails was strongly supported
in a Bayesian analysis of the three genes combined
(Additional file 2). The chance occurrence of reciprocal
monophyly between the Brown-cheeked Rail and Water
Rail was rejected (p = 1.9 × 10-17, group a = 20 individuals, group b = 38 individuals).
The species tree estimated with *BEAST recovered the
Brown-cheeked Rail and Water Rail as reciprocally
monophyletic groups with posterior probabilities of 1
(Figure 4). Within these clades the relationships among
the sampled populations were not resolved. This reflects
the high number of shared alleles among the populations of both Water Rails and Brown-cheeked rails, but
not between them.
Population structure and coalescent analyses

evolving gene, PTPN12, which could reflect retained
ancestral polymorphism (Figure 3). West and Middle
Asian and European populations from East Kazakhstan,
West Siberia, and Europe were included in the Water
Rail clade, they shared haplotypes in the three genes,
and showed the highest haplotype diversity in the faster
mitochondrial gene COI, as expected. Moreover, a single
haplotype (C8) was the only one common to all populations in the western part of the Water Rail distribution.
Singleton COI haplotypes differed from the most common haplotype (C8) by one or two mutational steps
(Figure 3). The number of mutational steps separating
the Brown-cheeked Rail and Water Rail was 18 and two,
for COI and ADH5, respectively. With the exception of
one shared haplotype, one mutational step separated the
two groups of water rails at PTPN12. Corresponding
corrected genetic distances, calculated using the best-fit
model for each partition were 3.3%, 0.6%, and 0.3%, for
COI, ADH5 and PTPN12, respectively.

Sequence data sets for all populations had nonsignificant
values (p > 0.10) of Tajima’s D values and Fu and Li’s
D* and F* statistics, suggesting all three genes are selectively neutral. Therefore, it is appropriate to use them to
estimate gene flow and other parameters with neutral
coalescent methods.
Analyses of the genotypes at the two nuclear loci
using Structure supported two major clusters corresponding to the population samples of the Water Rail
and the Brown-cheeked Rail. The posterior probability
of this run was 0.57, versus 0.43 for the model assuming
3 populations (-ln = 276.4 versus -ln = 276.7). However,
the model with two populations performed better than
the one with three, with estimated mean population
assignment probabilities of individuals in populations
1 and 2 of 0.991 (0.954,1.0) and 0.990 (0.948, 1.0),
respectively. The model with three populations performed poorly in assigning samples of the Water Rail to
two clusters, the highest population assignment probability for membership of an individual to clusters 2 and
3 being only 0.571 (0, 1.0).
Both nuclear loci showed recombination by the
four-gamete criterion, ADH5 between sites 195 and 469,
and PTPN12 between sites 238 and 344. However, the
program IM used to estimate gene flow assumes no
within-locus recombination, so we split each locus into
two blocks of sequence that did not show evidence of
recombination [17]. Blocks were from characters 1 to

Discussion
Species delimitation is supported by genetics,
morphology and vocalizations

Analysis of DNA sequences indicated unambiguously
that the birds from insular and continental locations in
East Asia (referred to as R. a. indicus or Brown-cheeked
Rails) are clearly differentiated from the groups sampled
further west from breeding populations in Europe, West
Siberia, and Kazakhstan (originally recognized as R. a.
aquaticus and R. a. korejewi). The overall Kimura

195 and 196 to 618 for ADH5, and 1 to 343 and 344 to
746 for PTPN12. Each of these blocks was analyzed in
IM as different loci.
The coalescent analysis assuming the less parameterized isolation-without-migration model had marginally
significantly lower log likelihood than the isolation-withmigration model (-2[lnL0-lnL1] = 7, df = 2, p = 0.03).
The latter suggested no gene flow between populations
of the Brown-cheeked and Water Rail after their divergence; values of m1 = 0.015 (95% CI 0.005-1.04) and m2
= 0.405 (95% CI 0.045-1.385) were very low and the
lower 95% credibility intervals approached zero. Therefore we interpreted the coalescent parameters of divergence time and effective population size from the
analysis using the model of isolation-without-migration.
This less parameterized model also allowed divergence
time to be estimated more precisely (Figure 5), suggesting the split between Brown-cheeked and Water Rails
occurred ~534,000 years ago (95% CI 275,000-990,000
years). The effective population size estimated for the
Brown-cheeked Rail was 77,000 (95% CI 38,000147,000), which was similar to the values estimated for
Water Rails (56,000; 95% CI 30,000-99,000; Figure 5).
Effective size of the ancestral population could not be
estimated properly with three loci, and sorting of alleles
into reciprocally monophyletic groups (Figure 5).

3-Parameter genetic distance between Water Rail and
Brown-cheeked Rail clades for COI was > 3% including
18 fixed nucleotide substitutions. This number of substitutions falls well within the range expected between closely related species. Of 59 sister species-pairs of birds
surveyed with the same COI barcode sequence 22 were
separated by fewer than 18 diagnostic differences [18].
Sequences from the COI DNA barcode region indicated a clear subdivision that was corroborated with two
nuclear genes, with haplotypes mostly confined to each
clade, except for one allele in the more slowly evolving
nuclear gene PTPN12. The most likely explanation in
this case is retention of ancestral polymorphism but not
recent hybridization, as no other allele was shared in the
faster evolving ADH intron or COI. The use of multiple
genes not only increased the support for species delimitation, but it also provided more information to improve
the precision of the coalescent estimates of divergence
time and assessment of the degree of genetic isolation.
Coalescent analysis suggested that divergence with little
or no gene flow occurred between the two groups in
the Middle Pleistocene. These observations are in
accordance with morphological differences between

Trait variation observed between adults of the Water Rail and Brown-cheeked Rail [7,10,15].

Brown-cheeked Rails and Water Rails observed in comprehensive sampling of museum skins. Eastern birds are
sexually monomorphic in size, have proportionally larger
dimensions, pinkish cinnamon and pale buff chin and
throat-feathers, longer neck and breast feathers, and
black-and-white-barred under-tail coverts [9]. Additionally, the two forms have different call types: the complex
call of the Brown-cheeked Rail has a lower pitched
growl and a distinctly shorter duration than in the
Water Rail, which seems to have biological significance
due the lack of response to each other’s calls in playback
experiments [19] (Table 2).
A unified species concept suggests treating independently evolving metapopulation lineages as different
species, if independent lines of evidence are available
to support their reciprocal isolation [20]. Hence, we
support raising the Brown-cheeked Rail to full species
status, Rallus indicus, since genetic evidence and differences in morphology and vocalizations indicate this lineage is evolving independently from populations of the
Water Rail (R. aquaticus).
Vicariance and biogeography

According to our analysis the Brown-cheeked Rails and
Water Rails diverged with little or no gene flow about
530,000 years ago, and thus fit a model of allopatric speciation where a geographic barrier prevented contact
between the two groups. Prior to this the fossil record
indicates that water rails were widespread in Eurasia
including Japan from at least the beginning of the Pleistocene (~ 1.8 Million years, ISC). By the end of the Pliocene, the climate was considerably different from that of
today, coniferous forests covered much of the modern
tundra zone, and grasslands extended into mid- and
low-latitudes [21]. The distribution of wetlands in this
moister climate was likely more continuous, and the

dispersal of water rails in Eurasia could have occurred
via multiple routes.
The Pleistocene was marked by repeated glacial cycles
[22,23] that at their maxima would have prevented passage of several populations through Siberia, and around
high mountain chains due to the higher extension of
permafrost [24]. The glaciers also would have tied up a
considerable volume of water, reducing precipitation
and contributing to the extension of Asian deserts such
as the Taklamakan and Gobi, consistent with records in
loess deposits in China and Tajikistan [25]. The continuous uplift of the Himalayan mountain chain, which
doubled its height during the period, was not only a barrier on its own, but is also believed to have contributed
to the extension of the arid areas by creating a barrier
for the monsoon winds [25,26]. These events limited the
availability of wetlands, and likely forced water rails
south to less continuous wetland environments east and
west of the arid spots. Fragmentation of the widespread
ancestral population and eventual speciation of water
rails is thus attributable to this vicariance event. Currently, Brown-cheeked Rail and Water Rail populations
are isolated on opposite sides of the Yablonovy, Stanovoy and Himalaya mountain chains, the Mongolian
steppes, and the Gobi desert [19].
Lack of population structure within species

Despite the sparse sampling across their range in Eurasia, we did not detect obvious structuring of breeding
populations of the Water Rail from Europe, West
Siberia and Kazakhstan. This supports lumping of R. a.
aquaticus from Europe and West and Middle Siberia
with the disjunct population of R. a. korejewi from
Kazakhstan in one subspecies, consistent with their lack
of morphological differentiation [5]. Water rails are
known to have an erratic migration pattern, and good

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/226

flight capabilities, which could allow them to fly long
distances to find alternative shallow water habitats in
times of instability [9]. Long distance gene flow could
explain lack of population structure in birds from the
west. However, low frequency haplotypes in COI are not
shared between different breeding populations, indicating that interpopulation gene flow is not extensive
enough to spread these more recently evolved mutant
alleles. A star-burst distribution of haplotypes in the
water rail lineages (Figure 3A) suggests a population
contraction occurred, which would tend to erase less
frequent haplotypes, and then the population expanded
in size [27]. Using 534,000 years ago time of divergence
of the two species as a calibration in the species tree
estimated with *BEAST, we dated the expansion of the
populations in both species at approximately 10,000
years ago. This recent expansion was likely from a refugial population that survived the Last Glacial Maximum.
These hypotheses need to be addressed in the future
with more extensive sampling of individuals and more
rapidly evolving nuclear loci.

Conclusions
Our analysis with three genetic markers is consistent
with morphological and call differences that collectively
support suggestions that the Water Rail is divisible into
two species, the Brown-cheeked Rail (R. indicus), including breeding populations of East Asia, and the Water
Rail (R. aquaticus), including populations from West
Asia and Europe. These lineages were estimated to have
split in the Middle Pleistocene (~534,000 years ago)
when wetlands became more disjunct, restricting gene
flow and eventually isolating them in allopatric
populations.
Methods
Taxon sampling

Blood samples from apparently non-related individuals
of breeding populations of Brown-cheeked Rails and
Water Rails (Figure 1) were collected in different localities within their geographic range in Europe and Asia,
and were grouped according to their breeding ground
proximity and wintering migration area (Table 1, see
locality information per sample in Additional file 3).
COI sequences of birds from four additional samples in
three different localities in Europe (Falsterbo, Himlean,
Etelhem) were obtained from the DNA barcoding database [28,29] (Table S1). A drop of blood was taken from
each bird by puncture of the brachial wing vein and
mixed in 0.1 M EDTA and 1 mL 80% ethanol. Sample
sizes varied for the different loci (see Table 1), with the
biggest sample obtained for the fastest evolving gene studied, COI (73 individuals), which allowed better interpretation of historical population demography. The

combined data set for the three genes included 58 individuals. Two individuals of Virginia rail (R. limicola) were

DNA extraction and sequencing

DNA was extracted by a membrane purification procedure
in glass fiber-filtration plates (Acroprep 96 Filter Plate1.0 μm Glass, PALL Corporation) [31]. Sequences were
obtained from three independent loci (Table 1): 1) the
5’end of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I
(COI) used in DNA barcoding [1]; 2) intron 5 of the
nuclear gene alcohol dehydrogenase-I (ADH5) [32]; and
c) a segment of the nuclear gene Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) [33]. Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed in
12.5 μL reactions in a buffer solution containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01%
gelatin, 160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) [34],
0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1 U Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) and 20-25 ng of DNA. Cycle conditions
for COI were an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 36
cycles of 94°C for 40 sec, 50°C for 40 sec and 72°C for
1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Touchdown
cycle conditions were used for nuclear markers, as follows:
an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, 15 cycles of 94°C
for 1 min, 65-55°C (decreasing 1°C per cycle) for 35 sec,
and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 26 cycles of 94°C for
1 min, 50°C for 35 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 2 min. Primers used to amplify and
sequence COI were LTyr (forward - TGTAAAAAGGWCTACAGCCTAACGC, Oliver Haddrath, pers. comm.) and
COI748HT (reverse - TGGGARATAATTCCRAAGCC
TG) [18]; for ADH5 we used ADH5F (forward-TCTGTTG
TCATGGGCTGCAAG) [32] and ADH6R (reverseTCCAAAGACGGACCCTTTCCAG, 31) [32]; and for
PTPN12 we used PTPN12f1 (forward-AGTTGCCTTGT
WGAAGCCCGCATACA) [33] and PTPN12_r6 (reverseCTRGCAATKGACATYGGYAATAC) [33]. PCR products
were purified by excising bands from agarose gels and centrifuging each through a filter tip [35]. Sequences were
obtained on an ABI3100 (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence statistics, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic
analysis

Sequences were checked for ambiguities, and alignments
were assembled in Sequencher 4.1.2 (GeneCodes Corp.,

Tavares et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/226

Ann Arbor, Michigan) and MacClade 4 [36]. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from gene
sequences of nuclear loci (ADH5 and PTPN12) were
assigned to a single chromatid statistically in PHASE 2.1
[37], and the associated SNPs were referred to as haplotypes [37]. DNAsp 4.90.1 [38] was used to estimate haplotype diversity for each independent locus and to
generate haplotype matrices. Median-joining networks
to show relationships among nuclear alleles and mtDNA
haplotypes were built in Network 4.1 [39].
Base composition and genetic distances among
individuals were calculated with PAUP* 4b10 [40]. The
best-fit models of nucleotide evolution for each gene partition and for the combined data set were selected with
the Akaike information Criterion (AIC) in Modeltest 3.7
[41]. To verify if independent partitions were supporting
congruent phylogenetic signals, Maximum Likelihood
(with one allele per bird), and Bayesian analysis (of all
alleles) of each gene tree and of the concatenated data set
(including only individuals sampled for all three genes)
were compared. Maximum likelihood analyses were performed in PHYML [42] with 100 bootstrap replications
for node support, using the best-fit models estimated
with AIC in Modeltest. Bayesian analyses were performed
by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in MrBayes 3.2
[43] in two simultaneous independent runs of 5 million
generations each, with one cold and three heated chains
and sampling once every 1000 trees. The best-fit models
were used for each partition, but the values of the model
parameters were jointly inferred in the run. Posterior
probabilities of the nodes were computed across the
sampled trees after burn-in, which was determined by
convergence of the likelihood scores.
Compound diagnostic characters are a valuable source
of information to diagnose species [18,44], so we filtered
all the variable characters for each gene partition in
PAUP*, and the selected the fixed substitutional differences between each highly supported clade within water
rails. The test of chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly was applied to the highly supported monophyletic
clades (Bayesian posterior probabilities > 0.95) recovered
with the concatenated Bayesian analyses to try to distinguish if they likely resulted from random branching in a
single population or if they might represent distinct
taxonomic entities [45].
To estimate the species and population tree we used
the program *BEAST v1.5.4 (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) [46]. This method employs
substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics, but
also uses coalescent theory to provide joint inferences of a
species tree topology, divergence times, population sizes,
and gene trees from multiple genes sampled from multiple
individuals across a set of closely related species [46]. As
we are testing the phylogenetic relationships among

Page 9 of 12

populations of Brown-Cheeked and Water Rails, the haplotypes of the three genes (Table 1) were grouped in five
different trait sets, defined by the localities of the breeding
populations. The best-fit model estimated with AIC in
Modeltest were set for each partition a priori, and the
model parameters were estimated with the tree topologies
in the analysis. In addition to the substitution model, the
clock model and tree topologies were estimated independently for each gene. We set the clock model as a strict
clock because the two species are very closely related. A
prior for the rate of substitution of COI was set at 0.772%/
lineage/Myr, based on the mean for the NeoAves clade
derived in a mitogenomic timescale for birds [47]. Setting
this rate for the mitochondrial partition allowed us to estimate the rate of substitution of the two nuclear partitions.
Two independent simultaneous runs of 100,000,000 generations were performed, sampling once every 1,000 trees.
Posterior probabilities of the nodes were computed for all
Bayesian analyses across the sampled trees after burn-in.
The number of generations required to reach stationarity
of the posterior distribution was determined by examining
marginal probabilities plotted as a time series in TRACER
v1.5 [48]. The burn-in period was set as 30,000 trees
(30,000,000 generations). The effective sample sizes (ESS)
of parameters of interest (gene trees, species tree, root
age) were all above 200.
Among-population gene flow and coalescent time

Basic coalescent models in population genetics assume
independence between loci, and selective neutrality. We
therefore used only one mitochondrial gene, in spite of
higher genetic variability displayed by this genome, which
would provide more variable characters for demographic
estimates. COI was selected as the mitochondrial gene
because in an initial survey for a DNA barcoding project,
we observed structured variability among BrownCheeked and Water Rails at this locus. Two nuclear loci
were also selected because they potentially can provide
evidence for subdivision in genes with independent histories. The nuclear genes PTPN12 and ADH5 are located
in chromosomes 1 and 4, respectively in Gallus gallus
[49]; they also likely segregate independently in rails
because bird macrochromosomes generally have high
synteny [50,51]. To verify if the sequences conform with
neutral expectations of nucleotide substitution, we computed Tajima’s D-value and Fu and Li D* and F* values
[52] for each gene using DNAsp 4.90.1 [38].
Population structure using phased genotypes of the
two nuclear alleles were estimated in Structure 2.3.1
[53,54]. For this purpose, we used the output of PHASE,
which codes sequence information in numbers. The
method assumes a model in which K populations are
characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus.
Individuals are assigned probabilistically to populations

Tavares et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/226

in a way that approximates the allele frequencies at each
locus to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Multiple runs
were performed using the admixture model, with values
of K varying from 1-5 (due the putative structure of the
different breeding populations) for 2,000,000 generations
and a burn-in period set to 400,000 generations. The
run for each model with the highest likelihood value
was selected as the best approximation of population
structure in water rails. The posterior probability of
each value of K was calculated with Bayes rule.
Divergence time and other demographic quantities of
the two well supported clades within water rails (Table 1)
were estimated with IM [17]. This program implements a
model of isolation with migration, accounting for changes
in population sizes and the size of the ancestral population. The program uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to
estimate jointly the posterior distribution of the model
parameters and the demographic quantities N1, N2, and
NA (effective sizes of population 1, population 2, and the
ancestral population, respectively), t (time since population
splitting), m1, and m2 (migration rate per generation of
genes from population 2 to population 1, and from population 1 to population 2, respectively). The fitting of the
IM model assumes that the genealogical history of a locus
is bifurcating and does not include recombination [17]. To
test for recombination in the nuclear partitions, we used
the four-gamete test [55] in DNAsp [38]. Two analyses
were performed in IM: the first allowing migration
between the two populations; and the second assuming
the isolation model where migration rates (m1 and m2;
migration rate scaled by mutation rate) where set to 0.
A likelihood ratio test (2 degrees of freedom) was used to
verify if the model of isolation-without-migration was significantly different from the more parameter-rich model
of isolation with migration. The available option of the
HKY model of sequence evolution was adopted for each
gene to correct for multiple substitutions at sites. Prior
values of mutation rates (μ) for each locus, and generation
time, were specified to convert coalescent times to years
before present. For mitochondrial COI, we used the rate of
0.772%/lineage/Myr estimated for the clade of Neoaves
sampled in a mitogenomic timescale for birds [47], which
was converted to 5.3 × 10-6 substitutions/locus/year (s/l/y)
by multiplying by the number of base pairs of the locus
(686), and transforming from million years to years. For
the nuclear partitions we used the mean value of the posterior distribution of the rates obtained in *BEAST analysis. The rate estimated for ADH5 was 3.27 × 10 -9
substitutions/site/year (s/s/y), and for PTPN12 was 3.13 ×
10-9 s/s/y. They were converted to the required per locus
rate of the non-recombining blocks used in IM, by multiplying the per site rates by the corresponding number of
bases used in each block. Generation time (g) of BrownCheeked and Water Rails was set as 2 years [56]. As the

Page 10 of 12

method allows input of different sample sizes per locus,
the maximum number of individuals that were sequenced
for each locus was used. Several preliminary runs were
performed in IM with different priors and heating
schemes to find the conditions that allowed proper mixing
among chains to avoid local optimum parameter values.
We also monitored the mixing of the chains by observing
the effective sample size (ESS) for each parameter that was
estimated. When good conditions were achieved, three
runs were performed for each analysis to verify if the estimated parameters were converging to similar results. Final
IM analyses were run for 4,600,000 generations after a
burn-in of 100,000 steps using geometric heating, with
high heating parameters (g1 = 0.8 and g2 = 0.9), and 25
chains. Priors were set to maximum values for the parameters: t (time of split x μ) set as 15; for the run allowing
migration, maximum m1 and m2 value were set to 10; for
the run assuming no gene flow among the populations m1
and m2 were set to 0. The minimum ESS values for the
parameters estimated in the analysis with and without
migration were 352 and 743, respectively. In both cases
ESS values for the parameters of interest were well above
50, the minimum value recommended [17].
