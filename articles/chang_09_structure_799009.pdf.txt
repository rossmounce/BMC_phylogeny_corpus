Abstract
Background: Many Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce anti-bacterial peptides and
small proteins called bacteriocins, which enable them to compete against other bacteria in the
environment. These peptides fall structurally into three different classes, I, II, III, with class IIa being
pediocin-like single entities and class IIb being two-peptide bacteriocins. Self-protective cognate
immunity proteins are usually co-transcribed with these toxins. Several examples of cognates for
IIa have already been solved structurally. Streptococcus pyogenes, closely related to LAB, is one of
the most common human pathogens, so knowledge of how it competes against other LAB species
is likely to prove invaluable.
Results: We have solved the crystal structure of the gene-product of locus Spy_2152 from S.
pyogenes, (PDB:2fu2), and found it to comprise an anti-parallel four-helix bundle that is structurally
similar to other bacteriocin immunity proteins. Sequence analyses indicate this protein to be a
possible immunity protein protective against class IIa or IIb bacteriocins. However, given that S.
pyogenes appears to lack any IIa pediocin-like proteins but does possess class IIb bacteriocins, we
suggest this protein confers immunity to IIb-like peptides.
Conclusions: Combined structural, genomic and proteomic analyses have allowed the
identification and in silico characterization of a new putative immunity protein from S. pyogenes,
possibly the first structure of an immunity protein protective against potential class IIb two-peptide
bacteriocins. We have named the two pairs of putative bacteriocins found in S. pyogenes pyogenecin
1, 2, 3 and 4.

Background
Many Gram-positive bacteria produce anti-bacterial peptides and small proteins, called bacteriocins. There are
three main classes produced by Gram-positive lactic acid
bacteria (LAB): class I bacteriocins are the lantibiotics,
small (<4 kDa), post-translationally modified peptides
containing unusual amino acids such as lanthionine; class
II are small, unmodified, heat-stable bacteriocins (<10
kDa); class III include larger (>30 kDa) heat-labile proteins, such as murein hydrolases [1]. Most bacteriocins are
synthesized as precursors, which are matured and
secreted, then target a specific bacterium and kill it by
increasing its membrane permeability to various small
molecules. Class II bacteriocins are subdivided into IIa,
pediocin-like unmodified bacteriocins, IIb, two-peptide
unmodified bacteriocins, IIc, formerly class V, where the
N- and C-termini are covalently linked resulting in a cyclic
structure, and class IId, non-pediocin, single, linear peptides [2]. The genetics and biosynthesis of class IIa bacteriocins have been well studied [3], and these constitute
one of the most important groups of antimicrobial peptides, due to their useful antibacterial properties. All
known IIa bacteriocins are described as being active
against Listeria and some have already been tested as food
preservatives for controlling food-borne pathogens [4].
Structurally, class IIa bacteriocins are related to each other
being unstructured in aqueous solution, but with a central
amphiphilic alpha-helical region when in lipid micelles
or TFE [5-7]; they contain the characteristic conserved Nterminal YGNGVxCxxxxC sequence, though usually not
the GxxxG motif(s) characteristic of IIb and IIc bacteriocins [7].
The class IIb two-peptide unmodified bacteriocins, for
example plantaricin E/F [8], need the complementary
action of both peptides to be active [9]. These bacteriocins
contain long amphiphilic alpha-helical stretches, and the
two complementary peptides interact when exposed to
membrane-like entities. The GxxxG motif is conserved in
many two-peptide bacteriocins, and it is postulated that
the two complementary peptides dimerize via a helixhelix interaction that involves this motif, to form the functionally active heterodimer [10]. The dimer functions by
creating a pore within the membrane through which
small molecules leak out, and, typically, the genes encoding the two peptides are found adjacent to each other on
the same operon [10].
The cyclic class IIc bacteriocins are characterized by being
tryptophan-rich and lacking any GG, GxxxG or YGNGVxCxxxxC motifs, [11]; the class IId bacteriocins have none
of these features but some have recently been found also
to be circular, rather than linear, with conserved AxxhhN
and AhhW/F motifs [12-14].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/75

In order to neutralize the toxic effect of the peptide on the
"producing" cell the genes encoding bacteriocins are generally co-transcribed with a cognate immunity protein.
These small proteins (typically 88-115 amino acids) interact very tightly with a specific bacteriocin or pair of bacteriocins and protect the "producing" microbe from the
toxic effect of its own bacteriocin [15,16]. The immunity
proteins usually show high specificity for their cognate
bacteriocins [17,18]. For each class IIa bacteriocin
encoded in a genome there is a one to one relationship
between bacteriocin and cognate immunity protein;
whereas, in contrast, for each pair of class IIb two-peptide
bacteriocins there is a single cognate immunity protein
encoded in a genome [9]. Structures of five immunity proteins have already been solved: ImB2 [19], EntA-im [20],
PedB [21], PisI [22], and Mun-Im [23], all protective
against IIa bacteriocins. As yet, no structures for immunity
proteins protective against IIb or IIc bacteriocins have
been solved.
The sequencing of bacterial genomes, including those
from human pathogens, has revealed a number of genes
which might potentially code for new bacteriocins and
immunity proteins, suggesting that the use of these antimicrobial peptides is more widespread than previously
thought and that bacteria might be targeting several different bacterial species using these toxins. Understanding
which specific immunity protein neutralizes which bacteriocin toxin is important if these peptides are to be used as
antimicrobials.
The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes,
closely related to LAB, is one of the most common human
pathogens. It causes a wide range of both minor diseases
such as pharyngitis, erysipelas and pyodermas, that are
readily controlled by antibiotics, as well as major, often
lethal, conditions such as acute rheumatic fever, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, in
developing countries and in the western world [24]. The
search for new antibacterial agents effective against this
species is thus urgent.
Other streptococcal species have been shown to secrete
bacteriocin-like toxins, as there are reports of S. salivarius
producing a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances showing in vitro inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, including Salivaricin A [25,26]. Such observations
suggest that antibacterial toxins are playing a very important role in controlling the level of the S. pyogenes population in human microbiomes. Bacteriocin-like toxins and
antitoxins may well have an impact on the development
of new antibacterial strategies and treatments. A thorough
understanding of the biology of the bacteriocins in combination with their immunity proteins is important for
any possible therapeutic use of bacteriocins. The full

sequences of LAB genomes provide opportunities to scan
for the presence of toxins and their corresponding immunity proteins. However, the sequence alone may not be
sufficient to identify these proteins.
Here we present the first structure of the protein from
locus Spy_2152 (gene names taken from S. pyogenes M1
GAS), named pyogenecin immunity protein Sp-PIP,
determined at 2.15 Ã resolution. We provide structural
and sequence analyses, and identify the putative corresponding bacteriocin-like toxins in the S. pyogenes
genome, which are found to belong to the class IIb twopeptide bacteriocins.

Results
Structure determination
We have expressed the pyogenecin immunity protein
from S. pyogenes in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. The crystal structure of Sp-PIP was solved by the
single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method
using selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein. The
model was refined to 2.15 Ã with an R-factor of 15.7%
and an R-free of 25.4%. The crystal asymmetric unit contains 78 (out of the 102) well ordered residues and 74
water molecules. The first methionine and the 23 C-terminal residues are disordered and cannot be identified in the
electron density maps. The structure is high quality; all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/75

non-glycine and non-proline residues of the model lie
either in the most favorable region (95.9% of residues) or
in the additionally allowed region (4.1% of residues) of
the Ramachandran plot. Detailed refinement statistics
and crystallographic data are shown in Table 1. The crystal
structure of Sp-PIP, shown in Figure 1, is a typical anti-parallel four-helix bundle. The four long helices (H1, residues 3-16; H3, 23-41; H4, 43-61; H5, 66-79) pack tightly
together around a well-defined hydrophobic core. One
additional short helix (H2, residues 17-22) connects helices H1 and H3. All long helices are between 14 and 17 residues in length. Helix-pairs H1/H4 and H2/H3 are
parallel to each other and helix-pairs H1/H2 and H3/H4
cross over each other at an angle of approximately 30Â°. In
the structure, the N- and C-termini are very close together
(7 Ã). Overall, the protein is slightly acidic (calculated pI
= 6.06) with two large acidic patches near each end of the
bundle and one large positively charged patch near the Nand C-termini.
Structural analysis
Structural comparisons, using the DALI server [27], reveal
that the structure of Sp-PIP matches a range of proteins all
having a four helix bundle topology, with a Z-score of 8.7
or less. In this range of Z-scores, it is not clear whether the
matches are due to homology or simply to structural similarity. However, structural homology combined with

Sequence analysis
Guided by the structure of Sp-PIP, whose sequence had
not been assigned to any known protein family, we
sought to expand our knowledge of its sequence relatives
using the Pfam database [29]. Having identified that it
was structurally similar to known members of the Pfam
EntA_Immun family (Pfam:PF08951) we carried out an
analysis with profile Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to
determine whether Sp-PIP should also belong to this family or not. Taking the EntA_Immun family from Pfam
release 22.0 as a starting point we carried out iterative
searches using the HMMER package (v2.3.2). After multiple rounds of searching of the HMM against the sequence
database (UniProt version 12.5) using an E-value threshold of 0.04 along with careful manual inspection of the
resulting matches we were able to detect 172 sequences
compared to the 19 sequences found in Pfam release 22.0.
The family has been updated in the current release of
Pfam - 24.0 - and the alignment is now available on the
Pfam web-site at: http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk//family/
Pf08951.
Domain analysis
We investigated whether any other protein domains were
to be found on any immunity proteins in the
EntA_Immun family. Some members of the family do
also carry associated domains. One protein contains an Nterminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator (UniProt:Q88Y45), and a group of methionine sulfoxide
reductases from Enterococcus faecium (UniProt:Q3Y319)
and closely related species carry a C-terminal PMSR
domain - peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase
(Pfam:PF01625) - as well as the N-terminal immunity
protein domain.

sequence analysis, enabled us to relate this protein to
structures that ranked 2nd (1tdp), 10th (2bl8) and 23rd
(2k19) in the list of DALI matches, and the results are
shown in Table 2. These homologous proteins are all
pediocin-like immunity proteins. Sp-PIP shares a RMSD
of 2.4 Ã with ImB2, 1tdp, over 75 residues, and, using the
structure comparison service SSM at European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm[28],
the RMSD is found to be 2.11 Ã.

Proteome analysis
Sp-PIP belongs to a large family of putative bacteriocin
immunity proteins. To investigate the possible targets of
the presumed immunity protein we carried out an analysis of the proteomes of several strains of S. pyogenes,
including M1 GAS, MGAS10750, and MGAS8232, to try
to identify any complementary bacteriocins and immunity proteins. We searched the proteomes with HMMs of
both the known class I, antibacterial18 (Pfam:PF08130),
and class II bacteriocins, bacteriocin_II (Pfam:PF01721),

bacteriocin_IIc (Pfam:PF10439) as well as with the
EntA_Immun families, from the Pfam database (release
23.0). We have identified a small genomic region containing four genes encoding putative bacteriocin proteins of
class IIb (Spy_0479, Spy_0480, Spy_0484 and Spy_0486),
and have called the proteins Pyogenecin 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively (UniProt:Q9A139, Q9A138, Q9A137,
Q9A136). The organization of this region is shown in Figure 2a. We have also identified two separate gene loci
encoding immunity proteins in the S. pyogenes genome:
Spy_2152 (Sp-PIP) and Spy_1675. Both encoded proteins
were found in all the S. pyogenes strains examined, and are
identified as belonging to the EntA_Immun family
(Pfam:PF08951), a family which contains nearly 200 different members from LAB and closely related species.

Discussion
The four-helix bundle structure of Sp-PIP was found to be
most closely related to those of a number of pediocin-like
IIa immunity proteins. Three subgroups of pediocin-like
IIa immunity proteins have been defined on the basis of
common sequence motifs and phylogenetic analysis [17],
being denoted as groups A, B and C, as shown in Figure 3:

â¢ Group A: EntA-im, the enterocin A immunity protein, [20]; PDB ID:2bl8
â¢ Group B: PisI, the piscicolin 126 immunity protein
[22]; PDB ID: 2k19
â¢ Group C: ImB2, the carnobacteriocin B2 immunity
protein [19]; PDB ID:1tdp
The structural comparison results suggest that Sp-PIP is
most closely related to Imb2, from subgroup C. These
results suggest that Sp-PIP is highly likely to function as a
bacteriocin immunity protein with similarities to proteins
from group C.
Sequence analysis reveals that Sp-PIP belongs to the now
expanded Pfam family of immunity proteins
EntA_Immun that also includes pediocin-like immunity
proteins from groups A, B and C as detailed above, thus
confirming its evolutionary link to known bacteriocin
immunity proteins. A search for other immunity proteins
of a similar nature in the S. pyogenes genome identified
another gene locus encoding a protein matching the

EntA_Immun family. Both of these loci were seen in all
strains examined. Unlike the case in many other species,
in S. pyogenes these bacteriocin immunity proteins were
not found closely linked to their bacteriocins, a condition
that might be explained by the remnants of a transposon
identified between them.
Functions for proteins may often be inferred through consideration of the combinations of the functional domains
found on them. A number of domain-pairings were identified on some of the immunity family members, such as
an N-terminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator
on one protein, which might be suggestive of immunity
proteins acting as transcriptional regulators or of interacting with transcription regulators and modulating their
function. A group of methionine sulfoxide reductases are
found to carry both a C-terminal PMSR domain and the
immunity domain. The PMSR domain is involved in
reversing protein inactivation by oxidation of methionine
residues. However, it is not clear what, if any, functional
significance these domain-pairings might have.

the well-conserved N-terminal YGNGVxCxxxC motif
[30,31]. Searches were not made for bacteriocins of types
IIc or IId since the immunity proteins complementary for
these two groups identified so far, gassericin A [32] and
circularin A, [33] do not share sequence or size similarity
with those of the pediocin-like immunity proteins. The
four putative class IIb proteins we identified from a short
genomic region, and named pyogenecins 1-4, are found
as two tandem pairs of genes separated by a gene in the
antisense orientation that encodes a transposase pseudogene. The presence of this pseudogene suggests that this
region might once have been part of a mobile genetic element. Finding bacteriocins in pairs is characteristic of the
class IIb bacteriocins [34]. As with other class IIb bacteriocins, these pyogenecins have a conserved GG leader peptide, as well as the conserved GXXXG motif necessary for
helix-helix interaction between the two proteins, as illustrated in Figure 2b. All four putative pyogenecins are
found to fall into the Pfam Bacteriocin_IIc family
(Pfam:PF10439), a family of bacteriocins secreted by
streptococcal and other LAB species.

The search for potential bacteriocin targets for this putative immunity protein took in classes I, II and III. Our
analyses identified that S. pyogenes contains a class I lantibiotic system composed of one unique lantibiotic type A
sequence called srtA and just one unique immunity protein srtI. These two genes are closely associated on the
genome, but are separated from the proteins of the class II
system described below as well as from the presumed
immunity proteins. This suggests that the Sp-PIP is
unlikely to act as an immunity protein for class I bacteriocins. Class II bacteriocins are subdivided into classes IIa,
IIb, IIc and IId. We did not find any bacteriocins of class
IIa encoded by the S. pyogenes genome, which would have

Based on the sequence similarity to other two-peptide
bacteriocins, the genomic arrangement of the genes
found, and the identification of two immunity proteins,
we hypothesize that the putative pyogenecins 1 and 2
associate to form one active bacteriocin and pyogenecins
3 and 4 associate to form a second active bacteriocin possibly targeting a different bacterial species. These peptides
need now to be synthesized to allow testing of their biological activity in a suitable bacteriocin-assay. Given that
we find two immunity proteins we suggest that each one
is specific for one of the putative bacteriocin pairs,
Pyogenecin1/Pyogenecin2
and
Pyogenecin3/
Pyogenecin4.

There is also the possibility that one or both of these
immunity proteins might be an orphan immunity protein
[17], so-called because no cognate bacteriocin in the
genome has been identified; and it has been pointed out
that most other immunity proteins so far determined for
IIa two-peptide bacteriocins are small trans-membrane
proteins closely coupled transcriptionally with their bacteriocins [9]. However, it would appear that the sequences
of only a handful of two-peptide immunity proteins have
been deduced and neither are there defined structures for
any of these nor are most of them more than putative
immunity proteins, the designation being based only on
the presence of predicted transmembrane helices [35-37],
so comparison with the system we propose here is difficult. The exact method by which immunity proteins protect their host cell or interact with the bacteriocins is also
unclear, but it may be that the orphan immunity proteins
do confer resistance to other bacteriocins in addition to
their cognate bacteriocin [17,9]. It is possible of course
that many more two-peptide-like systems remain still to
be characterized, as there are a large number of additional
LAB peptides in the Pfam family Bacteriocin_IIc PF10439
which are "pairs" in the sense that they are expressed from
closely adjacent genes and for which a cognate immunity
protein has not yet been identified.

Conclusions
The structure of the putative immunity protein Sp-PIP
protective against potential class IIb two-peptide bacteriocins could be the first structural representative of this
class. A combined structural, genomic and proteomic
analyses has allowed the identification and in silico characterization of a new putative immunity protein from S.
pyogenes. Structurally similar proteins seem to provide
immunity protection for single peptide IIa class bacteriocins. Further biological and biochemical studies are needed
to verify the antibacterial activity of the putative pyogenecins and to determine the degree of resistance and
cross-resistance provided by the proposed immunity protein.

Methods
Protein cloning, expression and purification
The ORF from the Spy_2152 locus was amplified from
genomic S. pyogenes M1 DNA with KOD DNA polymerase
using conditions and reagents provided by the vendor
(Novagen, Madison, WI). The gene was cloned into the
pMCSG7 vector using a modified ligation-independent
cloning protocol [38] and over-expressed in E. coli BL21
(DE3) - Gold (Stratagene) harboring an extra plasmid
encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg, ATA for
Ile). The pMCSG7 vector bearing a tobacco etch virus
(TEV) protease cleavage site creates a construct with a
cleavable His6-tag fused onto the N-terminus of the target
protein and adds three artificial residues (Ser-Asn-Ala) on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/75

that end. The cells were grown using SeMet-containing
enriched M9 medium and conditions known to inhibit
methionine biosynthesis. The cells were grown at 37Â°C to
an OD600 of ~0.6 and protein expression induced with 1
mM isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG).
After induction, the cells were grown overnight with shaking at 20Â°C. The harvested cells were re-suspended in lysis
buffer buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10
mM imidazole, 10 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 5% v/v
glycerol) in the presence of lysozyme (1 mg/mL) and of
protease inhibitor cocktail (100 Î¼L per 2 g of wet cells),
and then kept on ice for 20 min before sonication. Then
the cells were lysed using sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 Ã g (RC5C-Plus centrifuge, Sorval) for 20 min, followed by filtration through
0.45 Î¼m and 0.22 Î¼m in-line filters (Gelman). The lysate
was then applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Ni-NTA column on the
AKTAxpress (GE Health Systems). His6-tagged protein was
eluted using buffer containing a higher concentration of
imidazole (500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mM HEPES,
pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol),
and the His6-tag was cleaved from the protein by treatment with recombinant His6-tagged TEV protease. A second Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was performed
manually to remove the His6-tag and His6-tagged TEV protease. A total of 90 mg of protein was purified for finding
crystallization conditions. Then the protein was dialyzed
in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.1, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and concentrated to 110 mg/mL using a Centricon Plus-20 Centrifugal Concentrator (Millipore). The
standard purification protocol has been thoroughly
described previously [39].
Protein crystallization
The initial crystallization conditions were searched using
the sitting drops vapor diffusion method at 18Â°C with the
help of the Mosquito crystallization workstation (TTP
Labtech) with Index (Hampton Research) and Wizard I
and II (Emerald Biostructures) crystallization screens.
Crystals suitable for X-ray experiment were obtained at the
initial stage of crystal screening, the crystallization condition number 23 of Wizard II within several days. Crystals
were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with crystallization
solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant
prior to data collection.
Data collection and structure determination
Anomalous diffraction data were collected at the selenium
peak from crystals of a SeMet-substituted protein. The
data sets were collected on an ADSC quantum Q315
charge-coupled device-detector at 100 K on the Structural
Biology Center beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon

90.00Â°. The diffraction data were processed using the
HKL3000 suite of programs [40].
All procedures for single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), phasing, phase improvement by density
modification, and initial protein model building were
done using the structure module of the HKL3000 software
package. The mean figure of merit of the phase-set was
0.207 for 50-2.25 Ã data and improved to 0.542 after density modification (DM). The autotracing Arp/wArp module [41] in HKL3000 built 77 out of 102 residues with
fitted sequence. The initial model was rebuilt with the
program COOT [42] using electron density maps based
on DM-phased reflection file. After each cycle of rebuilding, the model was refined using REFMAC5 [43] from the
CCP4 suite with TLS refinement. The stereochemistry of
the structure was checked with PROCHECK [44]. Atomic
coordinates and experimental structure factors of Sp-PIP
have been deposited with the PDB database and are accessible under the code 2fu2.
