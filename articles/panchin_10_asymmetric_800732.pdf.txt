Asymmetric and non-uniform evolution of
recently duplicated human genes
Alexander Y Panchin1,2, Mikhail S Gelfand1,2, Vasily E Ramensky3, Irena I Artamonova1,2,4*

Abstract
Background: Gene duplications are a source of new genes and protein functions. The innovative role of
duplication events makes families of paralogous genes an interesting target for studies in evolutionary biology.
Here we study global trends in the evolution of human genes that resulted from recent duplications.
Results: The pressure of negative selection is weaker during a short time immediately after a duplication event.
Roughly one fifth of genes in paralogous gene families are evolving asymmetrically: one of the proteins encoded
by two closest paralogs accumulates amino acid substitutions significantly faster than its partner. This asymmetry
cannot be explained by differences in gene expression levels. In asymmetric gene pairs the number of deleterious
mutations is increased in one copy, while decreased in the other copy as compared to genes constituting nonasymmetrically evolving pairs. The asymmetry in the rate of synonymous substitutions is much weaker and not
significant.
Conclusions: The increase of negative selection pressure over time after a duplication event seems to be a major
trend in the evolution of human paralogous gene families. The observed asymmetry in the evolution of paralogous
genes shows that in many cases one of two gene copies remains practically unchanged, while the other
accumulates functional mutations. This supports the hypothesis that slowly evolving gene copies preserve their
original functions, while fast evolving copies obtain new specificities or functions.

Background
Gene duplications and subsequent differentiation of
duplicated genes are important processes in the evolution of living organisms [1]. Gene duplication promotes
phenotypic diversity and is involved in the manifestation
of many genetic disorders [2]. Evolutionary histories of
multigene families have been studied in a variety of
organisms on the scale of individual families [3-7] as
well as in genome-wide analyses [8-12].
Regarding gene duplication and evolution, one of the
best studied organisms is the budding yeast S. cerevisiae.
This organism experienced a recent whole-genome duplication event [13] that, together with smaller segment
duplications provided material for comparison of duplicated genes of different origin. The results of these

studies are somewhat contradictory. Paralogous genes
originating from whole-genome duplications have weaker
phenotypic effects when deleted and are less divergent in
function [14]. The whole genome duplication event in
the Saccharomyces lineage was followed by a significantly
increased rate of the evolution of duplicated genes [15].
In several studies, this evolution was shown to be significantly asymmetric for different genes copies: one copy
evolved faster than the other [15-17]. Genes duplicated
in yeast evolve slower on the sequence level in other species [10]. The probability to cause lethality is higher for S.
cerevisiae singleton genes if they have no orthologs duplicated in any of the other yeast species [11].
Cross-species analysis of duplicated genes demonstrated that the dN/dS ratio is higher in singleton genes,
compared to the dN/dS ratio for genes with two or
more copies per genome [18] (here dN is the number of
non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous
site, dS is the number of synonymous substitutions per

synonymous site; smaller dN/dS values indicate stronger
negative selection). Strong negative selection on genes
with multiple copies could result from the initial importance of these genes. On the other hand, pairs of duplicated genes show weaker negative selection than pairs
of orthologous genes that have separated at the same
time [19]. One more cross-species study reports that
most duplicated genes experience a short post-duplication period of relaxed neutral selection [12]. While most
of them become pseudogenes, the remaining duplicates
start experiencing strong purifying selection. It has been
proposed that neofunctionalization is a common fate for
duplicates that have been created by a single duplication
event and avoided pseudougenization, in contrast to
members of large gene families [20].
The existing publications concerning the asymmetry
of the evolution of human paralogs are also somewhat
controversial. Whereas no significant evidence of asymmetry was found in a multispecies comparative study
dealing with organisms from all three domains of life
[19], a significant level of asymmetry in the evolutionary
rates in pairs of human paralogous genes was observed
in a study where pairs of recent paralogs were compared
with outgroup genes from the mouse genome [21]. Such
incompatible findings could be due to differences in the
methods used. Asymmetry was found in the evolution
of rodent duplicated genes demonstrating that a gene
copy duplicated to a new genomic location tend to
evolve faster [22]. A study on the frog X. laevis demonstrated that genes from paralogous pairs are usually
expressed in similar locations and developmental timings, but at significantly different levels [23].
Here we describe major trends in the evolution of
recently duplicated human genes. Instead of using genes
from other mammalian species as outgroups, as done in
most studies, we focus on human gene families containing three or more genes. Hence, relatively distant family
members can be used as outgroups for genes that have
undergone recent duplications. This approach allows us
to avoid problems with precise identification of orthology relations and to calculate individual evolutionary
rates of genes evolving in the same genome, i.e., on the
same evolutionary distances and under the same conditions. We show that there is a global trend in the
decrease of dN/dS values with growing dS values, both
for the majority of individual genes and for gene
families. We also report that 18% of recent human paralogous pairs evolve with significant asymmetry and that
faster evolving gene copies accumulate functional mutations at a significantly higher proportion then slowly
evolving genes from the same pairs or genes from nonasymmetrically evolving pairs. The observed asymmetry
is unlikely to be caused by pseudogenisation, but more
likely to be a result of functional divergence of genes.

Results
Estimation of individual dN and dS rates

To calculate individual, gene-specific, dN and dS rates
we have selected the closest paralog for each gene
within its family. We refer to this gene as the “sister” of
the initial gene. For such pair of genes we find the closest outgroup within the same family. We refer to this
outgroup as the “cousin” gene. By definition, the cousin
gene is positioned outside the branch containing the sister gene pair in the phylogenetic tree, i.e., is an outgroup
(Figure 1).
More formally, the dS value produced by the PAML
codeml program was used to determine the closest
neighbors of each gene. This value represents the evolutionary time since the separation of two sequences. In
addition to the identity restrictions (see Methods), only
genes with 0.01 ≤ dS ≤ 3 were compared, to ensure that
very close and very distant sequences are not paired in
the analyzed set. If the closest neighbor was too close (dS
< 0.01) to the given gene, the next, more distant, neighbor was considered as the sister gene. The cousin was
determined as follows (Figure 1). Let gene j be the sister
of a given gene i. Then gene k is the cousin of gene i, if
dS[i-k] > dS[i-j] and dS[j-k] > dS[i-j], where dS[i-k], dS[i-j], and
dS[j-k] are the values of dS between genes i and k, i and j,
j and k, respectively. These criteria ensure that gene k is
placed outside the branch containing genes i and j, thus
gene k is a valid outgroup for the pair of genes i and j
(Figure 1). If a gene pair did not have an appropriate cousin, it was not considered further.
For each gene from a pair with a cousin we calculated
individual dN (dNI) and dS (dSI) values using the following formulas (illustrated in Figure 1):

(
)
( dS[i−k] + dS[i− j] − dS[ j−k] ) / 2,

dN I = dN [i − k] + dN [i − j] − dN [ j − k] / 2;
dS I =

Figure 1 Relationships between gene i, its sister j and cousin k.
Li = (L[i-j] + L[i-k] - L[j-k])/2, where Li is the individual distance (T, dS or
dN) for gene i. L[i-j] is the distance between gene i and its sister j. L
[i-k] is the distance between gene i and its cousin k. L[j-k] is the
distance between the sister and the cousin of gene i.

where, as above, the indices [i-j], [i-k], [j-k] stand for
the pairwise values of dN or dS for the gene i, its sister
j and its cousin k. The individual dN I and dS I values
therefore represent the numbers of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions per site that occurred from
the moment of the last duplication event for the current
gene.
In this study the individual evolutionary rates for each
gene were used instead of pairwise dN and dS values
commonly used in the literature. The outgroup information was taken into account in the calculations of individual dN and dS values to increase their accuracy. This
also allowed us to compare the dN and dS values of
individual genes, rather than gene pairs within a gene
family. A similar method was used in a study of yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae duplicated genes by Kim and
Yi [24], but sequences of orthologous genes were used
instead of paralogous genes as outgroups. Here we focus
on genes that have evolved after recent duplications
and, therefore, have relatively small dS values: only
genes with individual dS values between 0.005 and 0.6
were used for the individual dN and dS analyses.
Individual dN and dS values of paralogous genes

We identified and evaluated 97 gene families that
matched the criteria described in the Methods section.
The families contained 511 genes, 446 of which had
both a sister and a cousin. For these 446 genes,

Page 3 of 12

individual dN and dS were calculated. The average individual dS value was 0.18 and the average individual dN
value was 0.05. Single-exon genes represented 59% of
genes for which individual dN and dS were calculated,
that is roughly the same fraction as in the complete
dataset (56.5%) (see Methods). The coding sequence
alignments of paralogous gene families had the average
length of ~1100 nucleotides (ranging from 153 to 5775
nucleotides). The smallest observed substitution rate
between a gene and its sister was 13 substitutions in
1263 nucleotides (1%) and the highest substitution rate
was 332 substitutions in 897 nucleotides (37%), the average being 160 substitutions in 1114 nucleotides (14%).
GOstat [25] comparison of all genes from the constructed families (511 in total) with the human transcriptome revealed overrespresentation of olfactory
receptors, genes involved in the ectoderm and nervous
system development, signal transduction, cell adhesion
and defense response in our dataset (P < 10-5). Genes
involved in metabolic processes, nucleotide binding, biological regulation and protein modification were underrepresented (P < 10-5).
The dependency between dN/dS (strength of selection) and dS (approximating the time from the last
duplication event) for individual genes is shown in Figure 2. The dependency between individual dN and dS is
shown in Figure 3. As mentioned above, only genes with
0.005 ≤ dS ≤ 0.6 are shown (405 genes). There is an

triangles. Only genes with individual 0.005 ≤ dS ≤ 0.6 are shown. Linear regression trend lines are provided for single-exon and multiple-exon
genes separately (regression coefficients not shown).

by green triangles. Only genes with individual 0.005 ≤ dS ≤ 0.6 are shown. Linear regression trend lines are provided for single-exon and

obvious trend showing that dN increases slower for larger values of dS (the linear regression coefficient for
dN/dS and dS is -1.37; 95% confidence interval is (-2.43;
-0.30)). This is true both for the subset of single-exon
genes and for genes with multiple exons. Note that, due
to the method’s limitations, individual dS estimates are
more reliable for genes with lower dS. However, even if
we consider the interval dS ≤ 0.2, where the method is
most reliable, the tendency of dN/dS decrease as dS
increases persists.
Similar trends can be found for the average values of
dN, dS and dN/dS for paralogous gene families (Figure
4 and Figure 5). If we use dN/dS as an estimate of
selective pressure and dS as an estimate of time, we
can state that older paralogs are evolving under stronger negative selection, while younger paralogs often
evolve under weaker negative selection, and sometimes
even with dN/dS > 1. On average, young gene families
undergo less pressure of negative selection than
families mostly consisting of genes with larger individual dSI.
We also calculated individual dN and dS using
branch-specific values of dN and dS calculated by
codeml (model = 2; 2 or more dN/dS values for
branches; trees created by clustalw). We obtained plots
similar to Figure 2 and Figure 3. The linear regression
coefficient for dN/dS and dS was -1.18; 95% confidence
interval (-2.05; -0.32).

As an additional control we restricted the sample to
genes that had at least 100 substitutions, when compared to their sister gene. This was done to ensure that
the observed trends are not caused by discrete substitution counts. The linear regression coefficient for dN/dS
from dS in this subsample of 232 genes remained negative and was equal to -1.31; 95% confidence interval
(-1.94; -0.69).
Asymmetry at non-synonymous sites

144 gene pairs had a valid cousin (see Methods). We calculated the number of amino acid substitutions in the
encoded proteins, using the cousin as an outgroup.
Twenty six gene pairs of genes from 144 (18%) were
found to be significantly asymmetric by the number of
amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins (P <
0.05). The P-value of the hypothesis to have 26 or more
gene pairs out of 144 being asymmetric only by chance,
assuming that the probability for a gene pair to be asymmetric is p = 0.05, as defined in Methods, is 1.33 × 10-8.
This shows that the asymmetry is a pronounced trend in
the evolution of duplicated genes: members of almost
one fifth of gene pairs evolve at significantly different
rates. These 26 gene pairs are listed in Table 1.
Single-exon genes constitute 54% of genes from the
asymmetrically evolving pairs. This is very close to the
average fraction of single-exon genes in considered 144
pairs (58%).

Protocadherin gamma

The gene pairs asymmetric by the number of non-synonymous substitutions are shown. The number of substitutions is only for non-synonymous substitutions
that were acquired in this gene, when compared to its sister and cousin gene (see Methods). Data for mRNA and EST count is presented according to the
UniGene database.

In six out of the 26 asymmetric gene pairs, the faster
evolving copy had individual dN/dS > 1, not observed
among the slower evolving copies. Although rapid divergence of gene expression profiles for paralogs had been
reported before [26], we did not find a significant difference in the number of ESTs or mRNAs present in the
UniGene database [27] between the slowly and rapidly
evolving copies from the 26 asymmetric gene pairs.
According to a GOstat comparison, genes from asymmetrically evolving gene pairs are not significantly different (P < 0.01) from other genes of the initial dataset in
terms of protein function.
Asymmetry at synonymous sites

We identified nine pairs of paralogous genes asymmetric
according to the number of synonymous substitutions
(P < 0.05). The P-value of the hypothesis to have 9 or
more gene pairs out of 144 being asymmetric only by
chance, assuming that the probability for a gene pair to

be asymmetric is p = 0.05, is 0.295. Therefore, we cannot reject the hypothesis that this observation is due to
chance. Four gene pairs are asymmetric by the number
of substitutions at both synonymous and non-synonymous sites.
PolyPhen analysis

Computational approaches have been shown to be able
to predict amino acid substitutions in proteins that are
functional and therefore are subject to purifying selective pressure [28,29]. We used a new version of the
PolyPhen tool [30] for the analysis aimed at quantification of the fraction of potentially functional non-synonymous substitutions in various classes of paralogous
genes. In 288 proteins encoded by the genes that were
used in the asymmetry study, 8104 directed amino acid
substitutions were classified by PolyPhen into “damaging” and “neutral” ones. Out of 8104 new variants, 542
(6.7%) were predicted to be damaging with 128 of them

Panchin et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:54
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/54

in asymmetric gene pairs. In turn, 127 of 128 damaging
variants were present in the faster evolving gene copy
and only one in the slower evolving copy. The number
of damaging variants is overrepresented in the faster
evolving copies of asymmetric genes (p < 0.001) and
underrepresented in the slower evolving copies (p <
0.001) compared to the set of non-asymmetrically evolving gene pairs.
Pride analysis

One gene from each asymmetrically evolving pair
acquires mutations at a very high rate. This is suspicious
because this could imply that some of these genes are
recent pseudogenes. To address this possibility, we analyzed additional evidence that faster evolving genes from
asymmetric pairs are functional. In particular, we
curated all corresponding mRNAs and ESTs and confirmed sufficient experimental evidence of transcription
for all these genes. Additionally, we tried to confirm the
existence of gene products on the protein level using
Pride [31,32], a database that contains experimental
reads of protein fragments. We established that 23 out
of 26 faster evolving copies of genes from asymmetric
gene pairs are validated by unique amino acid sequences
in Pride. For the remaining three genes, neither their
nor their sister’s amino acid sequences were observed.
Overall, this confirms that the observed asymmetry is
not due to pseudogenization.

Discussion
A number of publications demonstrated that certain
synonymous sites are evolving under the pressure of
selection. This selection could be a result of differences
in tRNA concentrations [33], translation kinetics [34],
translation accuracy [35,36], and protein folding [37]
that are dependent on codon usage, as well as the existence of conserved exonic splicing enhancers and silencers [38,39], or some other yet unknown factors.
However, we found no significant evidence for asymmetry in the distribution of synonymous substitutions
within pairs of paralogs. Synonymous substitutions are
distributed much more evenly among genes than substitutions leading to amino acid change.
While it is possible that some synonymous sites
experience selection, it is much weaker than the selection at non-synonymous sites for genes evolving after
recent duplication. On average, individual dS can be
considered as an estimate of the time passed since the
last duplication event, while the value of dN/dS reflects
the strength of natural selection.
As shown in Figure 3, most genes from paralogous
gene families are subject to negative selection, but the
strength of this selection is substantially weaker if the
latest duplication event was recent. This observation

Page 7 of 12

holds both for single-exon and multiple-exon genes.
This is correct for gene families as well: younger families
tend to evolve under weaker negative selection. Thus,
duplicated genes change mainly during their early evolution. These findings are in agreement with the speculative scenario described below.
Immediately after duplication, the pressure of negative
selection weakens and pairs of genes start evolving
rapidly, possibly until both acquire important, but different, physiological roles. At this point strong negative
selection is restored and the genes acquire less nonsynonymous substitutions. Duplicated genes that are not
beneficial are likely to be lost during their early (independent) evolution and mechanisms, as the one
described above, could be a possible way for the fixation
of beneficial duplications. Our results are well in line
with other studies; in particular, similar trends have
been observed by Koonin et al. [18], with orthologs
from mice used as outgroup genes.
However, this evolutionary scenario, while the most
common, is not the only possible one. We also observed
strong evidence for the asymmetry in the distribution of
amino acid substitutions between proteins encoded by
pairs of closest paralogs. 18% of such gene pairs are significantly asymmetric. This reveals the second pronounced trend in the evolution of paralogous genes:
after a duplication event, one gene remains practically
unchanged, whereas the other one evolves quickly. We
can speculate that these could be the cases when the
unchanged copy of a gene preserves the initial function,
while the other one evolves to obtain a different function. The PolyPhen analysis provides evidence that the
observed asymmetry is caused by an increased number
of new potentially functional variants in one copy of a
gene and the decrease of the frequency of such substitutions in the other copy. We believe that this is an evidence of a radical change of function in most cases,
rather than pseudogenization. Indeed, all genes from the
asymmetrically evolving gene pairs are transcribed (have
validated mRNAs and, usually, ESTs) and have no premature stop codons. Furthermore, most of them have
experimentally identified amino acid products. We were
not able to find any evidence of pseudogenization for
these genes based on available data.
Some observations of the asymmetry in the evolution
of human genes have been reported before, for example
in [21] where orthologous genes from the mouse genome were used as outgroups. One of the novelties of
our study is using paralogous genes instead of orthlogs
as outgroups. We believe this to be more correct,
because in this case all three compared genes evolve in
the same organism, and therefore in the same conditions and environment. Also, this usually allows us to
use a closer partner for comparison: in over 60% of the

Panchin et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:54
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/54

triplets studied, the human paralog was closer to a gene
and its sister than the closest ortholog from mouse (by
protein sequence identity). Besides, in this case one does
not encounter the problem of precise resolution of
orthology relationships. Yet, there are drawbacks. The
requirement for gene families with three or more genes
in each family decreases the sample size and introduces
a bias towards families with a large number of genes.
The presence of a third paralog might also affect the
pattern of substitutions between other duplicated genes,
but this is a problem for most studies on duplicated
genes. One could exclude families with more than two
paralogs but this would create a bias in the other direction and further reduce the sample size.
We did not observe any correlation between the
mutation rates of asymmetrically evolving genes and
gene expression level differences. We found no evidence
that mRNA abundance significantly influences the evolution rate of paralogous genes.

Conclusions
There seems to be a major trend in the evolution of
human paralogous genes and gene families: negative
selection pressure increases over time after a duplication
event. This trend is not biased by small substitution
counts. Significant asymmetry was observed in the evolution of 18% pairs of human paralogs when a third
paralog is used as an outgroup. This shows that in many
cases one of two gene copies remains practically
unchanged, while the other copy evolves quickly, acquiring a disproportionally high number of functional mutations, but showing no evidence of pseudogenization.
Several pairs of paralogs are asymmetric in the rate of
synonymous substitutions although this result is not significant on the genome scale.

were manually curated. After gap removal all families
with less than 25% or more than 98% identical nucleotide positions in the multiple alignment were filtered
out. Single genes diverging from other family members
at more than 80% nucleotide positions on average also
were filtered out. We used only gene families containing
three or more genes. This procedure, aimed at identifying very recent paralogs, treats single-exon genes and
genes with multiple-exons differently. For genes with
introns it usually requires some intron similarity and
thus guarantees that duplications are recent, whereas
the single-exon gene families may have diverged earlier.
To take the influence of single-exon genes into account
we validated all general observations separately on single-exon and multiple-exon gene subsets.
We manually curated gene families combining singleexon genes and genes with multiple-exons. All genes
suspicious for pseudogenization (3 cases) were removed
from the study. In one case the removal of the processed pseudogene led to the exclusion of the whole
gene family, as it ended up having only two genes.
dN/dS calculations

The values of dN and dS were calculated using the
codeml program from the PAML program package
[50,51]. The default parameters, except “runmode = -2
(pairwise)” were used. Output pairwise values of dS
were used to determine the sister genes and the cousins,
and pairwise dS and dN values were used to calculate
individual dS and dN values using the method described
in “Estimation of individual dN and dS rates” (Results).
We used the average pairwise dN and dS values of all
gene family members as dN and dS values of gene
families.
Study of asymmetry

Methods
Identification of gene families

Validated RefSeq mRNA collection [40,41] available at
the UCSC Human Genome Browser [42,43] was used as
human genes markers. Overlapping mRNAs were linked
together. Repeats were removed using RepeatMasker
[44,45]. Then masked sequences were compared pairwise by using discontiguous megablast [46,47] with the
following parameters: all filters set up (including Dust,
human repeats, vector screen, and low-complexity
regions), X-dropoff value set to 150, discontiguous word
template length set to 18, discontiguous templates were
both coding and non-coding, and word size set to 11.
Gene pairs with at least 75% identity at more than 20%
of their average length were linked. Single linkage clustering was used to form preliminary gene groups.
Finally, ClustalW [48,49] was used to align proteincoding regions of all family members. The alignments

If gene A is a sister of gene B and gene B is a sister of
gene A, the genes are considered bidirectional best paralogs. We then searched for the closest cousin for the
pair of genes and used it as an outgroup. If genes A and
B are bidirectional best paralogs, gene C is the closest
cousin to the pair of genes A and B if the dS value
between genes A and C and dS value between genes B
and C is larger than the dS value between genes A and
B, and if the sum of dS values from cousin C to both
genes from the pair is the smallest among any all possible cousins. The amino acid sequences of the encoded
proteins were compared. If all three genes differed at a
position, this position was not considered in the analysis. At all other divergent positions the outgroup was
used to identify which gene from the pair acquired a
substitution since the duplication event. The number of
such amino acid substitutions in proteins encoded by
each gene of a pair was calculated.

Panchin et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:54
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/54

The accumulation of neutral mutations in a DNA segment is usually assumed to follow a Poisson process
[52] and thus the distribution of the number of substitutions in each paralog (X1 and X2, for a paralogous pair)
is a Poisson one. The hypothesis of the symmetry of
paralog evolution implies the coincidence of the distribution coefficients. In this case if the substitutions in
paralogs are independent, the conditional distribution of
the substitution number in one gene of a pair assuming
the fixed total number of substitutions, i.e. (X 1 | Y =
X1 + X2), is binomial with p = q = 1/2 [53].
We checked the hypothesis of the symmetric binomial
distribution (p = q = 0.5) of substitutions between the
genes of each pair. If the statistical significance of the
hypothesis (estimated by P-value) was less than 0.05, the
gene pair was considered asymmetrically evolving. To
estimate the statistical significance of the observed number of asymmetrically evolving gene pairs we checked
the hypothesis of the binomial distribution (p = 0.05) of
observed outcomes.
Orthology relationships

Translates of all genes from the studied triplets were
compared to translates of the mouse CCDS protein
database from the Human Genome Browser using
BlastP (word size = 2; E-value cut-off = 10). The best
hit from mouse was added to the sequence list. A
Neighbor-Joining tree was calculated using ClustalW
(distance correction = true, ignore gaps = true). We
then checked whether any orthologs were closer to a
paralogous gene pair than their cousin.
Database comparison

We used GOstat [25,54] to analyze over- and underrepresentation of gene functions between all genes in our
dataset and the human transcriptome and between
asymmetrically evolving genes and all other genes of our
dataset. We used the UniGene [27] dataset to obtain
EST data for the studied genes.

gene families are evolving asymmetrically: one of the
proteins encoded by two closest paralogs accumulates
amino acid substitutions significantly faster than its
partner. Another interesting observation is that the
increase of negative selection pressure over time after a
duplication event seems to be a global trend in the evolution of human paralogous gene families.
Comments

1) The authors measured correlation between X/Y and
Y (X = dN, Y = dS). These two variables are related by
the definition. By another definition correlation determines whether values of one variable are related to
another. Furthermore, we know that X and Y are weakly
positively correlated. Sure, you can measure the correlation between related variables, this analysis can produce
a negative correlation between X/Y and Y. This indicates that there is a correlation between related variables
X/Y and Y (theoretically there may be no linear correlation between related
variables). However this correlation does not immediately suggest that “The increase of negative selection
pressure over time after a duplication event seems to be
a global trend in the evolution of human paralogous
gene families”. Such conclusions can be safely made if
X/Y and Y would be independent random variables but
they are not. I think that the interpretation requires
major caution.
2) The authors used ClustalW [41,42] to align proteincoding regions of all family members. In general it is
better to align amino acid sequences first. Nucleotide
sequences are aligned to correspond to the amino acid
sequence alignments (maintain reading frame).
3) Potential problems resulted from aligning of
nucleotide protein-coding sequences can be avoided by
manual curation. This was done by the authors. Still I
am suspicious about obvious outliers with dN/dS >2
(Figure 2). This might be a result of frameshifts in
alignments.
Authors response

PolyPhen analysis

All amino acid substitutions in proteins encoded by
paralogous gene pairs used for the asymmetry study
were classified into “damaging” and “neutral” by a new
version of PolyPhen, a computational tool for prediction
of possible functional and structural impact of amino
acid substitutions in proteins [55]. The chi-square analysis was used to search for differences in the distribution
of substitutions.

Reviewers’ comments
Reviewer #1: Dr. Igor Rogozin

The authors analyzed recent gene duplications of human
genes. They found that ~20% of genes in paralogous

It is indeed true that dN and dS are somewhat correlated. A perfect correlation between dN and dS would
result in a linear function dN = k*dS if negative selection (dN/dS) did not increase over time (dS). Under
these circumstances dN/dS would be described by a
horizontal line dN/dS = k. This is the null hypothesis.
Instead we observe a function for dN/dS from dS that is
incompatible with the null hypothesis. Our linear regression shows that dN/dS = k1*dS + k (with a negative k1
and positive k) is a better approximation to the curve
than dN/dS = k in the 95% confidence interval. This
means that not only dN increases with dS (which is
obvious), but the rate of dN increase changes with dS
which is basically the statement we make.

Panchin et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:54
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/54

Manual curation of alignments was used to ensure
that frameshifts are not present. We removed several
pseudogenes from our study. Some of these removed
pseudogenes contained frameshifts. The remaining
genes did not.
The alignment algorithm for coding nucleotide
sequences using amino acid sequences first, as suggested
by the reviewer is a good alternative to certain steps of
our manual curation process. Although we did not use
the proposed sequence of actions, we did use amino
acid sequences subsequently when curating the nucleotide alignments.
Reviewer #2: Dr. Fyodor Kondrashov

This paper presents three main results:
1) dN/dS declines with dS.
2) 18% of paralogous gene pairs evolve asymmetrically when the relative rates are tested with a more
distant paralog is used as an outgroup.
3) The fraction of predicted deleterious substitutions
is much higher in the fast evolving member of a
recent duplicate pair.
Generally, I found the paper boring at times, especially
with the introduction repeating the discourse that has
been tackled with over the last decade at least. More so,
it seemed to me that while the paper analyzed interesting results it did not leave me as a reader feeling completely satisfied. I would suggest rewriting the paper
either doing a more complete literature review, or stating the tested hypotheses and the reasons why they are
tested more succinctly.
My major concern deals with the first result being a
possible artifact of taking fractions of very small values.
It would be worthwhile for the authors to invest some
time showing that dN/dS values < 0.05 are not systematically overestimated due to the nature of discrete
counting of the number of substitutions.
On a more minor level, I think it would be worthwhile
for the authors to at least mention the issue of gene
conversion, which is especially important here because
the outgroup may also be subject to converting with the
sister species. If this occurs across few exons the authors
may not be measuring dN and dS values correctly across
the entire gene. Also, because gene families are selected
this automatically pre-selects genes with non-random
gene functions, that is more non-random that all possible gene duplications, which may have an effect on the
proportion of observed asymmetrically evolving gene
copies.
Finally, I believe that the strongest and the most novel
result of the paper is the large skew of predicted

Page 10 of 12

deleterious substitutions in the gene copies and that it
deserved greater attention.
Another minor point: the use of the first two citations
is strange, I am sure that more appropriate citations can
be found for the theoretical-methodological background
they are cited for initially.
Authors response

We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out that we
did not exclude the effect of discrete counting on
extreme values of dN/dS. We have performed an additional test and added the following text:
“As an additional control we restricted the sample to
genes that had at least 100 substitutions, when compared to their sister gene. This was done to ensure that
the observed trends are not caused by discrete substitution counts. The linear regression coefficient for dN/dS
from dS in this subsample of 232 genes remained negative and was equal to -1.31; 95% confidence interval
(-1.94; -0.69).”
We acknowledge that gene conversion might have
happened in some genes from our dataset and that in
certain regions of genes we might be measuring dN and
dS from the last gene conversion effect instead of measuring dN and dS from the last duplication event. These
cases are hard to identify. However, gene conversion by
itself could not result in the observed trend of dN/dS
decrease over time.
To artificially produce the observed trend of dN/dS
decrease with increasing dS any unaccounted effect
(such as gene conversion) is required to enrich the dataset with points that have either larger dN/dS and smaller dS, or smaller dN/dS and larger dS than they would
otherwise. Assume that dN/dS does not increase with
decreasing dS, but does not change or decreases instead.
Then a gene that has undergone conversion would consist of an older part (unchanged dN/dS and dS) and a
younger part (smaller dS and, by the above assumption,
unchanged or smaller dN/dS). In these circumstances
the conversion would enrich the dataset with points that
have smaller dS and smaller dN/dS or unchanged dN/
dS, not larger dN/dS as required. Thus, gene conversion
could not artificially produce the observed trend if it did
not exist all along.
The reviewer is correct to notice that our dataset is
biased towards genes with certain functions. This is
described in detail in the subsection “Individual Kn and
Ks values of paralogous genes”. Of course, the proportions of gene pairs that evolve asymmetrically might
depend on gene properties. Unfortunately, maybe due to
a small statistical power, we cannot identify traits that
are associated with asymmetric evolution. Hence we
state that “according to a GOstat comparison, genes

Panchin et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:54
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/54

from asymmetrically evolving gene pairs are not significantly different (P < 0.01) from other genes of the initial
dataset in terms of protein function”.
We agree with the reviewer that “the most novel
result of the paper is the large skew of predicted deleterious substitutions in the gene copies”. This is mentioned
in our abstract, results and discussion. We tried to highlight this finding a bit more in the final version of the
article.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion we also rewritten
and restructured the “background” section of the manuscript and added a number of appropriate references.
