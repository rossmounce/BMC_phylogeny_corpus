hammerhead ribozyme sequences in a satellite
DNA family of Dolichopoda cave crickets
(Orthoptera, Rhaphidophoridae)

Abstract
Background: The great variety in sequence, length, complexity, and abundance of satellite DNA has made it
difficult to ascribe any function to this genome component. Recent studies have shown that satellite DNA can be
transcribed and be involved in regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Some satellite DNAs, such
as the pDo500 sequence family in Dolichopoda cave crickets, have a catalytic hammerhead (HH) ribozyme structure
and activity embedded within each repeat.
Results: We assessed the phylogenetic footprints of the HH ribozyme within the pDo500 sequences from 38
different populations representing 12 species of Dolichopoda. The HH region was significantly more conserved than
the non-hammerhead (NHH) region of the pDo500 repeat. In addition, stems were more conserved than loops. In
stems, several compensatory mutations were detected that maintain base pairing. The core region of the HH
ribozyme was affected by very few nucleotide substitutions and the cleavage position was altered only once
among 198 sequences. RNA folding of the HH sequences revealed that a potentially active HH ribozyme can be
found in most of the Dolichopoda populations and species.
Conclusions: The phylogenetic footprints suggest that the HH region of the pDo500 sequence family is selected
for function in Dolichopoda cave crickets. However, the functional role of HH ribozymes in eukaryotic organisms is
unclear. The possible functions have been related to trans cleavage of an RNA target by a ribonucleoprotein and
regulation of gene expression. Whether the HH ribozyme in Dolichopoda is involved in similar functions remains to
be investigated. Future studies need to demonstrate how the observed nucleotide changes and evolutionary
constraint have affected the catalytic efficiency of the hammerhead.

Background
Noncoding tandem-repetitive satellite DNA (satDNA)
has long been known to constitute a large portion of
any eukaryotic genome [1]. Recent studies in Drosophila
through underreplication documented a strong positive
correlation between genome size and the amount of
satDNA [2]. SatDNA is usually located in the heterochromatic parts of the chromosomes close to the
centromeres and telomeres. The high evolutionary turnover of satDNA and the frequent species-specific

patterns have puzzled researchers for many years. Such
data challenge the hypothesis that there is a general biological function of satDNA. The enormous diversity of
satDNA in nucleotide sequence, length of repeats, complexity, and genomic abundance, instead suggest that a
specific function cannot be ascribed to satDNA.
However, transcription of satDNA and other non-coding DNA has been found in many species (e.g. [3-10]).
The function of the vast majority of these transcripts is
unclear, but recent studies using RNA interference have
documented the role of non-coding RNAs in regulation
of gene expression, chromatin organization, and genome
functioning (for a review, see [11]). For example, it has
been demonstrated that small non-coding RNAs can

play a crucial role in regulating heterochromatin formation [12] and it has been found that transcripts of tandem repeated non-coding DNA can give rise to dsRNAs
[13].
The transcription of satDNA was in some instances
also linked to hammerhead (HH) ribozyme activity
which may affect certain regulatory mechanisms in the
cell. SatDNA-derived HH ribozyme structures have been
detected in several organisms as different as schistosomes, cave crickets, and salamanders [14-16]. The HH
ribozyme is one of the smallest catalytic RNAs and was
first identified in viroid and viroid-like satellite RNA
sequences where they catalyze a specific phosphodiester
bond isomerization reaction in the course of rollingcircle replication[17,18]. All HH ribozymes detected in
animal satDNA so far have been shown to self-cleave in
cis long multimeric transcripts into monomers
[6,14-16,19,20]. The HH ribozyme from Schistosoma
mansoni is certainly the best characterized of natural
HH ribozymes. This particular ribozyme has also been
shown to perform efficient ligation [21] and transcleavage of an RNA target [22]. Recently, an active HH
ribozyme was also found in a mammalian messenger
RNA that self-cleaved both in vitro and in vivo and
reduced protein expression of C-type lectin type II
(Clec2) genes in mouse cells [22]. This study showed
that ribozymes might also act in post-transcriptional
regulation of protein coding gene expression in a way
that is similar to destabilizing protein factors.
HH ribozymes are characterized by a conserved central core which is mandatory for cleavage activity. The
consensus sequence for a HH ribozyme consists of three
paired stems that branch from the core as defined by
conserved nucleotides (reviewed in [23]). In addition,
the natural HH ribozymes require additional sequence
elements outside of the conserved catalytic core to facilitate intracellular activity. These elements are variable
and are therefore not phylogenetically conserved [24].
The correlation between structure and function of the
HH ribozyme became clear only recently [25-27]. For
many years studies of HH ribozymes were restricted to
a minimal construct. However, there have been major
discrepancies between the crystal structure of this particular construct and the results of biochemical experiments [26,28,29]. The biochemical data could only be
explained if a large-scale rearrangement of the core
region was assumed during catalysis [28,30,31]. Recently,
the HH ribozymes found in schistosomes were characterized in more detail and loop-loop interactions were
shown to have a large impact on HH ribozyme activity
[25,26,32].
Previously, database searches identified a potential HH
ribozyme (49 base pairs) in Dolichopoda cave crickets
embedded within the pDo500satDNA family and

Page 2 of 9

self-cleavage of satDNA transcripts has been shown in
vitro for RNA from D. baccettii [15]. The roughly 500
bp repeats of the pDo500 have been found in all Dolichopoda species studied so far [33] and constitute
approximately 5% of the D. schiavazzii genome [34].
Phylogenetic analyses of the pDo500 sequences from 12
Dolichopoda species showed that this satDNA family
evolved gradually at a rate of 3.4% per one million year
[33]. Thus, pDo500-based phylogenetic hypotheses were
mainly congruent with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny [33,35]. The HH ribozyme in Dolichopoda performed self-cleavage in vitro and this was associated
with processing of long multimer transcripts into monomers in vivo [15]. For the HH ribozyme of Dolichopoda
two cleavage mechanisms were suggested: 1) cis cleavage
by a single-HH (sHH) ribozyme which is the folding of
the 49 bp HH sequence, and 2) trans cleavage by a
double-hammerhead (dHH) which is a hybrid structure
between two extended HH sequences of 68 bp.
We took a phylogenetic footprint approach to analyze
in detail the pDo500 satDNA family from 38 different
populations representing 12 species of Dolichopoda cave
crickets with particular emphasis on the HH region. We
assessed whether the HH motif in the pDo500 satDNA
is more conserved than other parts of the pDo500 repeat
unit. HH stems should be more conserved than loops,
due to their importance for stabilizing secondary structures. Furthermore, the core region was expected invariant. RNA folding patterns of the HH regions of pDo500
sequences from different populations and species may
indicate which Dolichopoda species are expected to utilize active HH ribozymes. The results indicated that the
putative HH motif in the pDo500 satDNA is likely to be
under selective constraints and may be functional in
Dolichopoda.

Results
We analyzed 198 pDo500 satDNA sequences from
several populations of 12 Dolichopoda species, each
represented with 3-9 sequences. The molecular characteristics of these sequences were described in detail elsewhere [33]. The HH region sensu Rojas et al. [15] was
present in all sequences except in sequence vat3 from
D. geniculata which contains an extended deletion of
308 bp. The pDo500 sequences in the data set ranged
from 463 bp to 505 bp out of which 49 bp relate to the
regular sHH region (Figure 1) and 68 bp to the dHH
region. The 68 bp region is a 19 bp extension of the 49
bp region (Figure 2).
We used three different measures in order to assess
the level of conservation in the HH and the NHH sections of the pDo500 satDNA sequences. Two of these
measures - the Shannon-Wiener index and a measure
analogous to the homozygosity index - were subjected

to a resampling procedure (bootstrap analyses with
number of replicates = 1000) and all comparisons
yielded significant differences. Both the 49 bp sHH
sequence and the 68 bp dHH sequence were significantly more conserved than the NHH section (for a
summary, see Table 1).
For the histograms of the most frequent nucleotide at
each position there is a slight trend of values being closer to 1 for the HH region than for the NHH region
(see Additional file 1). Nevertheless, the Mann-Whitney
U tests showed that this difference is statistically significant only for the 68 bp dHH region (summarized in
Table 2). Stems alone were also significantly different
from the NHH region, both for the 49 bp and the 68 bp
regions. In contrast, loops were not significantly different. According to the most frequent nucleotides found
per position, the 49 bp sHH region was not significantly
different from the NHH region. However, this is likely
to result from the lower sample size of only 49 base
pairs for the sHH region compared with the dHH region
with 68 bp.
Figure 2 illustrates the sequence variation in both the
single and the double HH region. The variation affects
mainly those bases that are not involved in either the
hypothetical base pairing in the stems or the core region
in the catalytic centre of the ribozyme. The hypothetical
cleavage site is altered in only 2 clones. In the uridine
turn most mutations affect position U7, which is the

Page 3 of 9

only position in the core region that may vary [26,36].
The most common mutation in U7 is the C→T transition, which is species specific for the two closely related
D. linderi and D. bolivari. The positions C3 and G8
form a Watson-Crick base pair in the three-dimensional
structure of the HH ribozyme, and these positions are
highly conserved and mutated in only four and two
sequences, respectively. G12 which interacts with the
cleavage site, is mutated in only one sequence. Of the
two other core positions A13 and A14, only A13 is
altered in two sequences.
There is a relatively high number of mutations in the
stem I region, although the two positions closest to the
core [26], i.e. C1.1 and G2.2, are almost invariant. The
positions G1.2 and C2.2 are altered in a number of
sequences, but frequently these changes are compensatory mutations that sustain the Watson-Crick base pairing. Compensatory mutations were also found in stem II
where they affect the conserved positions G10.1 and
C11.1. Stem III contains a non-canonical base pair
which in most sequences is G-U, which is the most
common wobble found in RNA secondary structures
[37,38]. The non-canonical base pair U-U was also
found in this stem and was species specific to
D. schiavazzii.
Altogether, there are 19 compensatory mutations distributed in 13 sequences that can potentially restore the
base pairing stems (in the total alignment of 198
sequences). Six of them fold into an active HH structure
(see below). The remaining seven sequences cannot fold
into an active HH structure due to other mutations.
The secondary structure predictions for the 198
pDo500 sequences with a HH ribozyme region are summarized in Table 3. The majority of sequences, i.e. 146
out of 198, folded into active HH ribozyme structures
according to the criteria specified above. For 33
sequences, the HH ribozyme structure was the first
choice, i.e. the structure with the lowest free energy. For
the remaining 113 sequences the HH structure was not
the structure with the lowest free energy, although the
respective values were within the range of those
described earlier for the active HH structures of the
pDo500 sequences Pst3 (-20,4) and For6-2 (-14,2) [15].
The HH structures that were energetically preferred all
showed the Pst3 structures, not the HH structures previously described for For6-2.
Folding analyses were also performed for population
specific consensus sequences as determined previously
[33]. Again, the vast majority of sequences, i.e. 34 out of
39, folded into active HH ribozyme structures. The consensus sequences of D. schiavazzii and the PRA and
TUS populations of D. geniculata formed the For6-2
structure, whereas all other consensus sequences folded
into the Pst3 structure.

folded exactly the same way as in the sHH - i.e. two areas (blue) from the same sequence pair with each other - while pairing of stem I and II
requires two different sequences. The figure of the dHH is adopted from Rojas et al. (2000) and edited further to illustrate the alignment of the

Discussion
The HH ribozyme is the best studied ribozyme structure to date [39]. However, HH ribozymes have still
not been found in a large number of species. Of the
non-viroid organisms, the natural HH ribozyme has
primarily been studied in Schistosoma mansoni. In the
current study, we investigated the conservation of the
HH ribozyme sequence, embedded in the pDo500
satDNA repeats, in 12 species of Dolichopoda cave
crickets. This is currently the most comprehensive
dataset of HH ribozyme sequences in terms of the
number of species involved.
Here we applied a phylogenetic footprinting approach
[40,41] in order to assess the phylogenetic conservation
of the HH ribozyme region. Using three different measures of sequence variation, we found a significantly
higher level of sequence conservation for the HH region
than for the NHH region of the pDo500 repeats. This
clearly suggests an evolutionary constraint on the HH
structure in the pDo500 satellite family, which has been
hypothetized earlier on the basis of self cleavage of
pDo500 transcripts from D. baccettii [15]. In particular
pairing stem regions as well as the core of the HH ribozyme are highly conserved in the pDo500 satDNA
family.

SatDNA is known for its high evolutionary turnover;
it may thus be surprising to find highly conserved HH
ribozyme sequences within the pDo500 satDNA family.
However, the pDo500 satDNA was characterized earlier as relatively homogeneous. Bachmann et al. [34]
noted that the pDo500 satDNA was relatively conserved and low in copy number in D. schiavazzi, at
least compared to the two species-specific satDNA
families pDoP102 [42] and pDsPv400 [34]. Two trends
for the mode of evolution of the three satDNA
families were detected: 1) a positive correlation of
sequence variability and copy number, and 2) a negative correlation between sequence variability and
length of repeat. While the first trend was considered
in line with the theory on molecular evolution of
satDNA, the second trend was not (e.g. [43]. High
sequence homogeneity is expected to correlate to high
recombination rate, which in turn should reduce
repeat length. The results presented here add a further
aspect to the mode of evolution of the pDo500
satDNA in Dolichopoda - the evolutionary constraint
brought upon the pDo500 repeats by the conserved
HH ribozyme may explain the unexpected negative
correlation between sequence variability and repeat
length described by Bachmann et al. [34].

In the pDo500 data set we find compensatory mutations in at least 13 sequences. The compensatory mutations were observed in stems I and II and can restore
the hypothetical base pairing in the single-HH structure.
If we consider the double-HH, the number of potential
compensatory mutations may even be higher because a
double-HH consists of two different repeats that need to
hybridize. In stem I we found mutations in position 2.2
which in some instances were compensated for by
mutations in position 1.2 in the same sequence, but in
other instances were not. The compensatory mutations
in the stem regions do, to some extent, covary and this
is considered further evidence for a functional constraint
on pDo500 satellite DNA. Although some HH sequences
probably have lost the ability to form an active structure, the majority of our single-HH sequences could
fold into a potentially active HH structure as previously
described [15].
The biological role of HH ribozymes that have been
uncovered to date can be divided in two groups. One is
related to the viroid and viroid-like HH ribozymes
which play a role in RNA replication through rolling circle amplification [17,18,44]. The second is the role of
the HH ribozymes found in eukaryotic organisms which
remains speculative [39]. For example, the newt HH
ribozyme, which is embedded in the Satellite 2 family
(sat2), has been associated with a ribonucleoprotein
(RNP) in the ovaries [45]; an RNA binding protein
(NORA) has been characterized as a promising candidate as a constituent of this complex [19]. The function
of this complex is unclear; however, it has been associated with trans cleavage of an RNA target [45]. The
sat2 with its HH ribozyme has been found in nine different species representing four families of amphibians

[46]. There are striking similarities between the HH
ribozyme in amphibians and Dolichopoda as they are
both found in satellite DNA transcripts and are conserved between large numbers of species. In addition,
the Dolichopoda HH also has the potential to form an
extended HH structure (Figure 3) as previously
described for the amphibian HH ribozyme [46,47].
Whether the HH ribozyme in the pDo500 satDNA from
Dolichopoda is involved in a similar RNP complex as in
amphibians needs to be investigated. Neither the wellcharacterized HH ribozyme from S. mansoni, which is
also derived from satDNA transcripts, nor the HH ribozyme from A. thaliana, have been linked to a function.
On the other hand, the split HH ribozyme found in
mRNA from rodents has been implicated in regulation
of gene expression [22].

Conclusion
Further functional analyses are certainly necessary to
address the biological significance of the pDo500 HH
ribozyme in Dolichopoda cave crickets. Future experiments may focus on the transcription pattern of pDo500
sequences in the different Dolichopoda species and on
the self-cleavage of pDo500 repeats that carry nucleotide
substitutions in the 49 bp and 68 bp regions described
above. However, the data presented herein strongly suggest that the HH ribozyme in Dolichopoda cave crickets
is an example of sequence conservation in non-coding
DNA due to functional importance to the organism.
Nevertheless, this is certainly a special case similar to
that described earlier in amphibians [19,45]. Coding for
functional ribozymes, at present, cannot be considered a
general function of satDNA. There are two major
known functions related to satDNA: 1) the proper

described active HH ribozymes [22,26,27,36,52]. Numbering of specific nucleotides comprising the HH ribozyme was according to Hertel et al. [53].
Two mechanisms of cleavage were suggested in a previous study of the HH ribozymes in Dolichopoda [15]:
1) a single cis-cleavage mechanism carried out by a 49
bp sequence folding into a regular HH ribozyme, and 2)
a trans-cleavage mechanism carried out by a dHH structure where two copies of an extended HH sequence of
68 bp pair with each other. The latter was thought to
explain the efficient processing of long primary transcripts of the pDo500 satDNA in vivo. The current
study focused on both the 49 bp sequence (Figure 1)
and the extended 68 bp region (Figure 2).
Genetic variation in the potential HH region was
tested against the genetic variation in the remainder of
the pDo500 sequences following two different
approaches: 1) Two different measures of variation were
estimated for each position in the alignment and subsequently used in bootstrap approaches. The Shannon
S

entropy [54] was calculated as

suggested dHH sensu Rojas et al (2000), but here the structure consists

functioning of the centromere [48-51], and 2) processes
related to non-coding RNAs. The HH ribozyme in Dolichopoda is a special case of category two. The encoding
of the HH ribozyme may explain the slow evolutionary
rate for the pDo500 satDNA family.

Methods
Materials

PDo500 satDNA sequences from 38 populations representing 12 Dolichopoda cave cricket species from Italy
and Spain that were previously described were included
in the analyses [33,34]. The 198 sequences were downloaded from GenBank; accession numbers GU322143GU322341 [33]. Details on the cloning and PCR amplification strategies, as well as the sequence alignment of
the pDo500 satDNA sequences, were described previously [33]. An alignment of the HH region is provided
in Additional File 2.
Sequence Analyses

The region comprising the potential HH structure was

the proportion of each character state in each position
and S is the number of characters. For calculating the
Shannon entropy, gaps were treated as a fifth character
state; i.e. S = 4 at positions without gaps and S = 5 at
positions with gaps. A variability estimate was calculated
in analogy to the homozygosity index [55] as follows H =
[A] 2+[T] 2 [C] 2+[G]2. In positions where gaps amount
to more than 3% the equation was extended to H = [A] 2
+[T] 2 [C] 2+[G]+[-]2. One thousand bootstrap replicates
were run for both the Shannon entropy and the homozygosity index. 2) The frequency of the nucleotide at
each position of the alignment was determined for both
the HH region and the non-HH (NHH) region of the
pDo500 sequence and illustrated by histograms (see
Additional File 1). For all three statistical procedures
(Shannon entropy, homozygosity index and tests of
nucleotide frequency), each of the following comparisons
were made: the HH region versus the NHH region of the
pDo500 repeats; the stems of the HH region versus the
NHH region of the pDo500 monomer; the loops of the
HH region versus the NHH region of the pDo500 monomer; the stems of the HH region versus the loops of the
HH region. Each comparison was tested in a MannWhitney U test using the program SPSS [56]. Both
approaches were used on both the 49 bp and the 68 bp
HH regions.
Secondary structure of 198 HH sequences was predicted and illustrated with the programs MFOLD using the web based program Quickfold that allows
folding of many sequences simultaneously on the
DINAMelt server [57,58] - and RNAdraw. The proportion of sequences per species that may fold into

potentially active HH ribozyme structures was determined. As criteria indicating potentially active HH ribozyme structures, we used secondary structure similarity
of the sequences to the structure of either the Pst3 or
For6-2 sequences of the pDo500 satDNA family which
were previously identified as active HH ribozyme
sequences in Dolichopoda [15]. In addition, we used
invariance of the core region since it was shown that
mutations in the core region abolish or significantly
reduce HH cleavage [59]. These analyses were done
only on the 49 bp HH sequence.
