Abstract

Background

quently, when s is small, species with low Ne are less likely to
prevent the fixation of weakly deleterious mutations [5].
Indeed, for species with large effective population sizes, there
is little doubt that selection is a strong enough force to determine the fate of synonymous mutations (for example, see
[6]). Conversely, in mammals, analyses of codon usage have
failed to detect clear signatures of selection (reviewed in [7]).
That synonymous mutations are effectively free of selection is
important, not least because, if they really are neutral, their

information

At least in mammals, it is typically assumed that selection
does not affect the fate of synonymous (silent) mutations,
those nucleotide changes occurring within a gene that affect
the coding sequence but not the protein [1,2]. This presumption is in no small part based on the understanding that effective population sizes (Ne) in mammals are small. According to
the nearly neutral theory [3], if s is the strength of selection
against weakly deleterious mutations, then selection is
expected to oppose their fixation when s > 1/2Ne [4]. Conse-

interactions

Conclusion: Taken together, our results provide evidence that, in mammals, synonymous sites do
not evolve neutrally, at least in part owing to selection on mRNA stability. This has implications for
the application of synonymous divergence in estimating the mutation rate.

refereed research

Results: We provide numerous lines of evidence that are all consistent with the above hypothesis.
Most notably, by simulating evolution and reallocating the substitutions observed in the mouse
lineage, we show that the location of synonymous mutations is non-random with respect to
stability. Importantly, the preference for cytosine at 4-fold degenerate sites, diagnostic of selection,
can be explained by its effect on mRNA stability. Likewise, by interchanging synonymous codons,
we find naturally occurring mRNAs to be more stable than simulant transcripts. Housekeeping
genes, whose proteins are under strong purifying selection, are also under the greatest pressure to
maintain stability.

deposited research

Background: In mammals, contrary to what is usually assumed, recent evidence suggests that
synonymous mutations may not be selectively neutral. This position has proven contentious, not
least because of the absence of a viable mechanism. Here we test whether synonymous mutations
might be under selection owing to their effects on the thermodynamic stability of mRNA, mediated
by changes in secondary structure.

rate of evolution should be equal to the mutation rate. The
rate of synonymous evolution could hence be used to provide
a simple and convenient measure of the mutation rate [8,9].
More recently, however, the assumption of neutrality at synonymous sites has been called into question [10-16]. This
view has proven contentious, not least because of the absence
of a functional role for supposedly silent sites.
Here we examine one hypothesis, that synonymous mutations in mammals are under selection because they affect the
thermodynamic stability of mRNA secondary structures
[17,18], possibly to prolong cellular half-lives [19,20]. Unlike
many non-coding RNAs [21-23], for which a stable secondary
structure is selectively favored [24-28], the evolution of a stable structure for mRNA would be constrained by the need to
encode a functional protein [17-19,29-31]. Consequently,
were selection to operate on mRNA stability, synonymous
mutations might be especially important (but see also
[32,33]).
The hypothesis is supported by findings that synonymous
mutations not only alter mRNA stem-loop structure [34,35],
but also affect decay rates, and may lead to disease [35-37].
One possibility is that stem (base-paired) structures protect
[38,39] against passive degradation by endoribonucleases
[36,40,41]. Similarly, stable structures would be less likely to
fall apart and thus expose vulnerable loop (single-stranded)
regions to cleavage. Notably, analysis of computationally predicted mRNA stability across a wide taxonomic range
revealed that real transcripts are more stable than comparable sequences in which synonymous codons were shuffled
while the protein sequence remained unaltered [42,43].
Unfortunately, broad scale empirical analysis of mRNA stability is currently intractable because the structure of
sequences much longer than tRNAs cannot be directly
observed [20,44]. Consequently, mRNA folding is typically
predicted computationally, by one of a variety of methods
(see Materials and methods). Importantly, however, no in silico method can completely predict how cellular conditions
might affect secondary structure [45]. For instance, proteins
bound to mature transcripts [46] may have an effect, while
chaperones are probably required to guide folding and/or
prevent RNAs becoming kinetically trapped in unfavorable
conformations [47,48]. Programs that attempt to incorporate
the kinetics of the folding process that results from the directionality of transcription [49-51] are still under development
[51]. Additionally, although a structure predicted in silico
might be designated 'correct' because it forms in vitro, folding
may be somewhat different in vivo [48,50].
The premise of this paper is not then to suppose that the prediction method and assumptions are flawless. Rather, we
suppose that, if the method is telling us nothing about selection on mRNA stability, there is no reason why multiple independent tests should all point towards the same conclusion.

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/R75

In particular we ask: whether the nucleotides at synonymous
sites are non-random with respect to stability; whether the
excess of cytosine at synonymous sites in rodents [15] might
be accounted for in terms of selection on mRNA stability;
whether the location of substitutions in the mouse lineage are
non-random with respect to stability; and whether genes
under stronger purifying selection also have higher relative
stability.
Although the hypothesis predicts that high mRNA stability
should be favored, note that we do not expect stability to be
extremely high, as ultra-stable structures would impose
kinetic barriers that could hinder ribosome translocation
[36,52]. While we presume that the transcripts of most genes
will be relatively stable, in some cases mRNAs may actually
need to be particularly unstable [43]. For example, selection
might not act to promote stability because the mRNA is protein-bound and control of expression occurs at the translational level. Alternatively, some genes may only need to be
transiently expressed, such as those encoding transcription
factors [53,54]. As it is difficult to identify a priori which
genes these might be, we cannot filter the dataset. This does,
however, render our results conservative.

Results

For 70 mouse mRNAs (Additional data file 1), we predict a
single optimal putative secondary structure and its thermodynamic stability (∆G, kcal/mol, the difference in free energy
between the folded and unfolded states). Prior studies providing evidence of selection on mRNA structure have employed
a randomization protocol that shuffles synonymous codons to
generate numerous simulants [42,43,55,56]. Based on the
idea that 'interesting' RNAs should be more stable than
expected by chance [57], one can then ask whether the stability of a real (wild-type) transcript is, on average, greater than
that of its simulants. Seffens and Digby [42], for example, did
this for a range of taxa (from bacteria to human). To determine if there is a prima facie case to answer, we first performed an analysis similar to that done previously, but
specifically restricted to mammalian sequences.

Nucleotide content at synonymous sites is non-random
with respect to mRNA stability
If selection acts on synonymous sites, by comparing a real
mouse mRNA to simulants differing only at synonymous
sites, we should find that, on average, the real transcript is
more stable. For each gene we generated 1,000 random
mRNAs identical in all regards to the real sequence, but with
the bases at 4-fold degenerate (synonymous) sites in the coding sequence (CDS) randomly shuffled between the 4-fold
degenerate positions. For each mRNA we determined Z(∆G),
the number of standard deviations the real mRNA is away
from the mean stability of the simulants. Z(∆G) is thus a
measure of 'relative stability', the stability of a given mRNA
relative to what one would expect by chance alone. Relative

of selection for stability, with a negative Z-score implying
higher than expected stability. As Table 1 shows, real mRNAs

While the above results suggest that the identity of the nucleotide at any given synonymous site is non-random, this need
not reflect maintenance of mRNA stability. Selection could
instead be acting on a thermodynamic property of DNA, such
as bendability [63]. As more G:C pairings make helices more
bendable and gene-dense regions are GC-rich (for example,
see [64]), the putative selection on GC content we observe at

In organisms from large effective populations, bias in codon
usage is usually attributed to translational selection, favoring
efficient (fast and/or accurate) protein synthesis as a consequence of skews in iso-acceptor tRNA abundance (reviewed
in [7,58,59]). Whether this occurs in mammals, however,
remains a contentious issue. While some have suggested that
preferred sets of codons do exist to match the most abundant
tRNAs [60], others maintain that codon usage does not reflect
tRNAs skews [7,61] and that translational selection does not
occur [62]. To be cautious, however, we also employed a protocol ('Sh.codon') that preserves the relative frequency of
codons within a given set by shuffling codons within synonymous sets. This protocol gave very similar results to the previous ('Sh.4-fold') randomization (Table 1; Additional data
files 2, 3).

however, that on an individual basis, the effect (if any) is
weak, with only 26 (37%) of genes having significantly high
relative stability at the 5% level (Additional data file 4). Moreover, were we to apply Bonferonni correction for multiple
testing on the by-gene P-values, no more than four genes
would be significant at the 5% level. Inspection of the genes in
our dataset (Additional data files 5, 6) did not reveal an obvious pattern that relates relative stability to their function.

Means ± SEM are shown, N = 70. P-values for modifications were determined by paired t-tests (µ = Real < Modification) on ∆G. P-values for
randomizations were by one-sample t-tests (expected mean (µ) = 0) on Z(∆G). %Pairs is the proportion of the coding sequence involved in basepairing interactions. Artificial sequences generated by the first five protocols encode the same protein as the mouse sequence. A brief description of
each protocol follows (see Results for details). 'Sh.4-fold': nucleotides at all 4-fold degenerate sites are shuffled. 'Sh.codon': for each amino acid, the
synonymous codons are permuted. 'Re-sub.K': synonymous substitutions are reverted back to the rat-mouse common ancestor (rat-mouse common
ancestor) state, followed by reallocation of the same number of synonymous point mutations. 'Re-sub.N3': like the previous protocol, except that
the nucleotide replacement is also selected at random from the nucleotide distribution at third sites observed in the mouse sequence. 'Swap G4C4':
all guanine bases at 4-fold sites are replaced by cytosine, and vice versa.

the mRNA level might actually function to provide the transcriptional machinery with easier access to the most genedense regions of DNA. To address this issue, we asked about
the strand-specific preference for cytosine at 4-fold degenerate sites observed in rodent exons [15].
Cytosine preference is indicated by two related features: a
higher C content at 4-fold sites than in flanking introns (not
observed for guanine) and an excess of C over G at 4-fold
degenerate sites [15]. Correspondingly, we found C4 > G4 in
87% of our mouse genes and a mean skew in GC4 (G - C/G +
C) of -0.1506 (P = 1e-11 for expected mean (µ) < 0 by onesample t-test on GC4 skew). Importantly, the skew towards C
is specific to exons and, therefore, cannot be accounted for by
effects at the DNA level (for example, mutational biases such
as transcription-coupled repair, or selection on transcription). Note also that the sign of the skew is the opposite of that
derived from transcription-coupled repair, which yields a G
excess [65,66]. Significantly, introducing synonymous
changes that increase C|G dinucleotide content (where | is the
codon boundary) extends mRNA half-life in vitro while
increasing A|U enhances degradation [36]. If selection is acting on mRNA stability, then this could be explained by a high
C content at third sites increasing the number of potential G:C
base-pairs, which are stronger than A:U interactions (triple
and double hydrogen bonds, respectively). Consistent with
this, we find that genes with the highest relative stability also
have a greater excess of C over G (Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (ρ) = 0.27, P = 0.0225 for GC4 skew versus
Z(∆GSh.4-fold); Additional data file 7).
To further examine the possibility that the C preference is
explained by selection on RNA structure, we also asked
whether replacing C residues with G decreases stability. We
found that real mRNAs are more stable than modified transcripts in which, at 4-fold sites, we swapped all Cs for Gs and
vice versa (Table 1; Additional data files 2, 3). 'Swap G4C4'
mRNAs, however, possess a higher percentage of base-pairs
than real transcripts (62.11 ± 0.33% and 60.96 ± 0.28% in
CDS, respectively, P = 0.0003 by paired t-test; 60.84 ± 0.26%
and 61.61 ± 0.26% in mRNA, P = 0.0007). That 'Swap G4C4'
mRNAs have more base-pairs but lower stability can be
explained by the existence of G:U base-pairs within stems, as
G:Us are weaker than Watson-Crick interactions (A:U and
G:C). An increased G content increases the amount of G:U
pairs (real 10.50 ± 0.26% and 'Swap G4C4' 11.64 ± 0.21% in
mRNA, P = 3e-07) and thus the proportion of base-paired
mRNA, but their stems are less stable (there is no difference
in the proportion of A:U pairs: real 36.60 ± 0.70%, 'Swap
G4C4' 36.39 ± 0.71%, P = 0.2449). These results further
underline the importance of nucleotide content for mRNA
rather than DNA stability, not least because the location of
bases that can potentially form Watson-Crick base-pairs in
DNA is preserved in the modified transcripts.

Biased amino acid content and RNA stability may
together drive C preference at third sites
The results above suggest that, given the nucleotide content at
non-synonymous sites, C enrichment at synonymous sites is
adaptive in regards to mRNA stability. Is there something
about non-synonymous sites that causes C in particular to be
enriched at synonymous sites? Fitch [17] proposed that, if
genetic code degeneracy is exploited to optimize base-pairing
in mRNA, third sites within codons (usually synonymous)
should be preferentially paired with first and second sites
(few and no synonymous sites, respectively). This would also
provide a buffer for mRNA structure against non-synonymous substitutions via compensatory changes. Cytosine preference at third sites might, therefore, be driven by selection
on amino acid content and mRNA stability [19].
In stems, we expect that, to permit base-pairing, a high G content at first and second sites should be matched by a high C
content at third sites (and vice versa), that is, selection on
non-synonymous sites would, at least in part, dictate nucleotide content at synonymous sites. At base-paired sites in
mRNAs, there is a strong negative correlation in GC skew
between first/second sites and third sites (for example, Pearson correlation coefficient (R) = -0.65, P = 1e-09 for GC12
skew versus GC3 skew) that is not observed at unpaired sites
(R = 0.70, P = 1e-11; Additional data file 7; note that a positive
correlation is expected from isochore structure [67]).
Given the potential inaccuracies of minimum free energy prediction methods (see Materials and methods), we also asked
whether the above relationship is robust to the exclusion of
sites at which one is less confident that base-pairing occurs
(either with a particular site in the optimal structure or with
any other site). GC skew is then only calculated for those sites
where the probability of pairing is greater than some minimum threshold. We found that the significant negative correlation in GC skew between first/second and third sites is
strikingly insensitive to different threshold values (Additional
data file 8).
Jia et al. [68] recently observed that α-helices and β-sheets of
protein secondary structures are preferentially 'coded' by
mRNA stems. Using data on the amino acid preferences for
protein conformations [69], we found G to be more abundant
than C at first and second sites in both α-helices and β-sheets
(GC12 skews of 0.001 and 0.0420, respectively). Similarly,
there is a bias towards G in these regions within the proteins
from our dataset (α-helix GC12 skew of 0.0608 ± 0.0143, P =
8e-05 for µ = 0 by one-sample t-test; β-sheet skew of 0.0879
± 0.0312, P = 0.0102). The C preference at third sites may,
therefore, reflect selection to maintain stable stems in these
regions enriched for G at largely non-synonymous sites.

Signals of selection or methodological artifact?

information

Testing the first prediction, that evolutionary rates should be
linked to mRNA secondary structure, is not straightforward,
even if structure prediction were perfect. Although one
expects that the majority of compensatory changes will occur
to restore substructures, the thermodynamic hypothesis posits that some will also act to restore the overall stability of the
molecule. Even if a precise secondary structure were conserved, the difficulty lies in the fact that a given substitution
can only be assigned to having occurred within a stem or loop
before or after it potentially affects base-pairing, for example,
a transversion at a base-paired site in the ancestral mRNA
will create a bulge/loop. Consequently, the only substitutions
that can be observed within the same (conserved) structure of
the descendant sequence are those that arise within loops
with little stem-forming potential or within stems in which a
compensatory substitution has restored complementary
base-pairing. With this caveat in mind, we examined

interactions

Note that the application of parsimony, while a common
practice in the mouse-rat comparison (for example, see
[78,79]), can sometimes provide biased ancestral state reconstructions (for example, see [80]). We therefore also reconstructed rat-mouse common ancestor sequences using a
maximum likelihood approach. At only 3 of 86,334 reconstructed sites did the parsimony and maximum likelihood
methods disagree (excluding sites differing in all three species, see Materials and methods). All three discrepancies
occurred in the same gene (Gadd45a). Exclusion of this one

refereed research

If certain mutations really were under selection because they
diminished mRNA stability, relocating those substitutions
actually seen to random locations ('Re-sub.') should lower
stability. We used parsimony to determine the substitutions
that have arisen in the mouse lineage, inferring the CDS of the
rat-mouse common ancestor using hamster as the outgroup
to maximize reliability and the number of informative sites
(Additional data file 9). We reverted all synonymous changes
back to the ancestral state and then simulated mutation by
randomly reallocating substitutions at synonymous sites,
maintaining the number of observed changes and the
encoded protein.

While the above results indicate that the location at which
certain synonymous mutations are observed is in part determined by constraints on mRNA stability, could the above
results be artifacts of an inaccurate methodology? We have
attempted to minimize such problems by considering those
sequences in which a priori we expect the method to be more
accurate and by considering only those sites that have a high
probability of being base-paired. We can, however, consider
additional tests. If selection for mRNA stability occurs, we
also expect that substitution rates should be related to predicted stem-loop structure and that genes known to be under
strong purifying selection should possess mRNAs with high
relative stability. We examine these two predictions in turn.

deposited research

Parenthetically, as recent evidence suggests that dinucleotide
content in rodent exons is the result of selection [15] and not
of biased mutation and/or repair [56,75], the desirability of
controlling for dinucleotide distribution is highly questionable. Put differently, if a real mRNA is on average more stable
than expected when compared to simulants in which the
observed point substitutions have been reallocated, biased
dinucleotide distribution is more likely to be a consequence of
selection for favorable base-stacking interactions rather than
mutational/repair biases.

reports

As nucleotide content is influenced by genomic location (isochores; for example, see [67]), the re-introduced nucleotides
were selected at random, but in proportion to base composition at third sites in the appropriate mouse gene. This also
further minimizes the negligible effect on dinucleotide distributions. From this randomization ('Re-sub.N3') we again find
that real mRNAs are, on average, more stable than expected
by chance (Table 1; Additional data files 2, 3). Ignoring the
effect of isochores and changing the profile of permitted substitutions does not qualitatively alter this result. For example,
allowing all mutations to occur with equal likelihood ('Resub.K') also shows that the locations of observed substitutions have had minimal impact on stability (Table 1; Additional data files 2, 3). Simulants and real transcripts possess a
similar amount of base-pairs (P > 0.15 by one-sample t-tests
on Z(%base-pairs), µ = 0; Table 1).

reviews

While randomization protocols that shuffle or swap nucleotides provide insights into how putative selection for mRNA
stability and nucleotide content interact, these processes do
not occur in nature. The most direct evidence that we can consider is to examine the locations of observed synonymous
mutations. Reallocating point mutations is a more realistic
form of analysis as it mimics the process of selection following
mutation (nucleotide substitutions that are not the result of
single point mutations are very rare in mammals, for example, see [70-73]). This minimizes potential biases. For example, randomization protocols that shuffle nucleotides or
codons (for example, see [42]) might be problematic [74] as
they generate a large number of variants in which there will
be a profound effect on dinucleotide relative abundances [7577]. Simulating the process of evolution, however, only introduces 7 to 8 synonymous changes per 100 sites, hence only
about 1 to 2 per 100 nucleotides in the coding sequence. This
will have negligible impact on dinucleotide distribution.

observed substitutions with respect to the predicted secondary structure in mouse.
We first asked whether substitution rates correlate with the
percentage of sequence involved in base-pairing interactions.
We found that both the number of synonymous substitutions
per synonymous site (Ks) and the non-synonymous substitution rate (Ka) for the whole CDS are higher in genes with more
base-pairs (Ka ρ = 0.31, P = 0.0091, N = 70; Ks ρ = 0.31, P =
0.0101, N = 69), although the result for non-synonymous
mutations is sensitive to restricting analysis to the subset of
small mRNAs (Additional data file 10). These effects seem to
be a consequence of substitutional processes within stems.
While there is a positive correlation between %base-pairs and
rates within putative stems (Ka ρ = 0.31, P = 0.0090, N = 69;
Ks ρ = 0.37, P = 0.0020, N = 68), no such relationship exists
in loops (Ka ρ = -0.03, P = 0.7941, N = 69; Ks ρ = -0.03, P =
0.8264, N = 69; Additional data file 10).
Note that these latter correlations do not mean that stems
evolve faster per se (one would predict the opposite), only
that they may evolve faster when a lot of the sequence is basepaired. Indeed, consistent with stems being under purifying
selection to maintain secondary structure, while non-synonymous rates are the same between codons in putative stems
and those in loops (P = 0.6233, N = 69 by paired t-test, stem
= 0.0110 ± 0.0018, loop = 0.0095 ± 0.0012), synonymous
sites in loops evolve 37% faster than those in stems (P =
0.0045, N = 68, stem = 0.0833 ± 0.0071, loop = 0.0608 ±
0.0034; Additional data file 10).
Why might a high proportion of base-pairing be associated
with rapid substitution rates within stems? One possibility is
that an abundance of base-pairs ensures that no single mutation can grossly destabilize an mRNA. While one might then
predict a negative correlation between %base-pairs and
Z(∆G) (that is, changes to mRNAs with little secondary structure will have a large impact on stability), this may not be
observed because when substitutions are randomly reallocated the majority will not fall within stems. Alternatively, the
relationship between %base-pairs and substitution rates
within stems may indicate a high rate of compensatory
changes restoring stem structures. Consider a mutation that
arises within a stem that destabilizes the mRNA secondary
structure. If selection maintains transcript stability, the substitution will only be tolerated if it is adaptive at the protein
level or has such a negligible impact on stability as to be effectively neutral. In the latter case, further changes could accumulate that in combination might significantly alter
structure. Under both scenarios, subsequent compensatory
mutations restoring stability would thus be under positive
selection. The effect of one mutation arising within a stem
that has the knock-on effect of increasing substitution rates
within stems would be most pronounced in genes with a high
proportion of base-pairing. Consequently, compensations
would be most favored when there is high pressure to main-

tain stability. Indeed, we find that in those genes under the
strongest selective pressure for high stability, putative stems
are fast-evolving (ρ = -0.37, P = 0.0020 for Z(∆GRe-sub.N3) versus Ks, N = 68).

Housekeeping genes have high relative stability
To test the second prediction, it is necessary to define a priori
a set of genes likely to be under stronger purifying selection.
Prior evidence indicates that genes expressed in most tissues,
housekeeping genes, may be good candidates for two reasons.
First, housekeeping proteins evolve slower than tissue-specific ones [73,81-83]. Second, experimental assays of half-life
have demonstrated that mRNAs of housekeeping genes
degrade relatively slowly [53,54].
Here we identify housekeeping genes by calculating the
breadth of expression, the proportion of tissues in which a
given gene is expressed. We call a gene 'expressed' in a particular tissue if the average hybridization intensity on microarrays ('average difference' (AD)) for the transcript is greater
than 100 or 200 (approximately 2 or 4 copies per cell, respectively, [84]). Housekeeping genes are those expressed in a
large proportion of tissues. As described previously (for
example, see [73]), we found that protein evolution is slowest
in housekeeping genes (%tissues versus Ka: ρ = -0.39, P =
0.0008 for AD > 200; ρ = -0.32, P = 0.0065 for AD > 100).
Significantly, consistent with the prediction, we found that
genes subject to strong purifying selection (housekeeping
genes) also have the highest relative stability, with the
inferred intensity of selection on mRNA stability being correlated with breadth of expression in the expected direction (ρ
= -0.25, P = 0.0335 for %tissues versus Z(∆GRe-sub.N3) at AD >
200). Using a less conservative cut-off to define a gene as
expressed (AD > 100) increases the strength and significance
of the correlation (ρ = -0.29, P = 0.0159). The relationship
becomes more pronounced after controlling for sequence
length (partial ρ = -0.25, P = 0.0179 for AD > 200; partial ρ =
-0.30, P = 0.0069 for AD > 100; significance determined by
10,000 randomizations). Expression breadth is not associated with the proportion of the sequence that is base-paired
(ρ = -0.01, P > 0.9 for %tissues versus %base-pairs in CDS),
nor does the amount of base-pairing predict relative stability
(R = -0.14, P = 0.2630 for %base-pairs versus Z(∆GRe-sub.N3)).
As suggested from the 'Swap G4C4' modification protocol,
this supports the importance of overall stability over the
amount of secondary structure.

Discussion

We have provided numerous lines of evidence that support
the hypothesis that selection on synonymous mutations can
be mediated by effects on mRNA stability in mammals.
Importantly, the signature of selection in rodents, the C preference at 4-fold degenerate sites [15], can potentially be
explained by selection on synonymous mutations affecting

Implications for understanding codon usage and
mutation rates
That selection maintains mRNA stability contradicts the
accepted wisdom that synonymous mutations evolve neutrally [1,2], not only because changes do not alter protein
sequence, but also because mammalian effective population
sizes (Ne) are thought to be too small to permit selection on
mutations of small effect on fitness [6]. Moreover, nucleotide
content at silent sites in mammals is best predicted by
genomic location (isochores; for example, see [67]). Our
observations, however, nonetheless tally with recent evidence
that selection acts on synonymous mutations [10-16].

interactions

When translational selection is known to occur, it can be at
odds with selection for mRNA secondary structure (fly, [20])
and stability (yeast, [90]), leading to a trade-off between the
two forces [20,90]. Given the difficulties involved in detecting
codon usage bias in mammals [7] and our results above, we
infer that selection on mRNA stability must be strong relative
to translational selection (if the latter occurs at all). This has
two repercussions. First, selection for mRNA stability could,
in principle, weaken any signal of a preferred set of codons for
translational efficiency. Second, in terms of detecting
selection at synonymous sites in mammals, asking whether a
given amino acid always prefers a certain codon is not necessarily asking the right question. Indeed, it is quite possible
that there exist no preferred codon within a gene while at the
same time synonymous mutations are under selection. More
generally, a complex set of trade-offs between different forms

refereed research

Selection favoring accurate or fast protein synthesis, the classically cited functional role for biased usage of synonymous
codons, is not well supported in mammals [7,61,62]. Translational selection predicts that highly expressed genes should
exhibit the greatest bias in codon usage [7], but the effect is
only weak [13,60,89] and a bias is also observed in lowly
expressed genes [89]. On the other hand, selection for mRNA
stability need not correlate with expression level (indeed, we
find no relationship between Z(∆G) and mean or peak expression level; P > 0.1 in all cases).

deposited research

One might suppose that in silico simulations could explain
variation in decay rates between genes. Z(∆G) is not a measure of absolute stability, however, but rather of stability relative to what might have been observed given the underlying
parameters of a gene, such as length and coding capacity.
Only if all such parameters were equal between genes would
one expect relative stability to predict decay rate. However, all
else is not equal; for example, we find that Z(∆G) and nucleotide content covary. Therefore, looking for a correlation
between Z(∆G) and half-life [56] is a weak test because an
absence of a relationship would not be strong evidence
against the hypothesis unless other variables could be controlled. Indeed, results are ambiguous. Mammalian housekeeping genes have longer half-lives [53,54] and we find that
they also have high relative stability. In contrast, Katz and
Burge [56] found no correlation between decay rate and local
Z(∆G) in yeast. The interpretation of the yeast result is made
even less clear due to uncertainty over when mRNAs should
be folded globally. The issue might be easier to resolve once
high-quality non-human sequence from primates becomes
available, as one could then compare available large-scale
surveys of human mRNA decay rates (for example, see [54])
with relative stability. As hominid Ne is around an order of
magnitude lower than in murids [88], however, it is also con-

On the other hand, simulations should predict relative decay
rates of mutant versions of a given gene. In at least one case,
the dopamine receptor D2 gene, it has been demonstrated
that only single nucleotide polymorphisms that induce a conspicuous change in structure predicted in silico affect mRNA
half-life in vitro [35]. A much larger sample set is required to
determine whether this is more generally true. We predict
that, for those genes with the highest relative stability, the
real mRNA should have a longer half-life than the majority of
mutants in which one has randomly reallocated synonymous
mutations.

reviews

Synonymous mutations can also be under selection for other
functions. Can we be confident that these effects are independent? Recent evidence also suggests that a preference for
exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) affects codon choice
[85,86] and that ESEs are under selection [87]. It is likely,
however, that the results presented here and selection on
ESEs are independent, as ESE hexamers are rich in G compared with C (24% and 14%, respectively, see [86] for dataset), while mRNA stability appears to explain high C content.
Moreover, ESEs define relatively little sequence, being short
and predominantly located within 20 nucleotides of splice
junctions [87].

comment

mRNA stability. That it should be C in particular (rather than
A, G or T), is further explained by skews in nucleotide usage
at largely non-synonymous sites: G enrichment at the first
and second sites in codons is matched by C enrichment at
third sites, so as to ensure, we argue, strong G:C pairs in the
mRNA. Moreover, through a randomization that simulates
evolution in the mouse lineage, we show that, had the
observed substitutions occurred elsewhere within a sequence,
they would have had a greater impact on mRNA stability.
Additionally, not only do housekeeping genes have unusually
low rates of protein evolution, their mRNAs have unusually
high relative stability, both features being consistent with
stronger selection on this class of genes. Although the structure prediction tool is by no means perfect, it is not obvious
how it could be biased in such a way as to cause all our results
to point towards the same conclusion.

of selection and mutational biases may render interpretation
of patterns of codon usage very difficult.
The evidence for selection on synonymous mutations also has
implications for our understanding of both the mutation rate
and the mutational load. The substitution rate at synonymous
sites in exons is often used as a measure of the mutation rate
[8,9]; however, this assumes neutral evolution of synonymous mutations [1,2]. By providing a parsimonious mechanism by which selection could act on synonymous sites, we
can ignore the objection that prior evidence is indirect. Nevertheless, it is presently unclear to what degree synonymous
mutations are favored or opposed by selection due to their
effects on mRNA stability. Without being able to quantify the
latter, as well as the net effect of other biases (for example,
splice-associated), it will not be possible to directly estimate
the extent to which use of the synonymous substitution rate
leads to underestimates of the mutation rate and the mutational load.

were unreliably annotated. If present, poly(A) tails were
removed as they are coated with binding proteins and so are
unlikely to be involved in base-pairing [97].

Coding sequence alignments
Each CDS was extracted using GBPARSE [98] and translated.
We aligned amino acid sequences as previously described [15]
then reconstructed the three-way nucleotide alignment using
AA2NUC (available from L.D.H.).

Reconstruction of rat-mouse common ancestor
sequence
Parsimony and maximum likelihood were used to reconstruct
ancestral sequence. At 0.3% of sites in the rodent alignment,
the rat-mouse ancestral state could not be determined (for
example, a different base was present in each species). In
these cases, we used the mouse sequence to be conservative
for the number of substitutions that have occurred in the
mouse lineage. Ancestral states derived from maximum likelihood were determined using codeml in the PAML package
[99,100].

Conclusion

Recent evidence has suggested that, despite assumptions to
the contrary, synonymous mutations in mammalian exons
can be under selection. Here we have provided several independent lines of evidence to support the notion that this effect
may in part be mediated by selection for mRNA stability.
Notably, the preference for cytosine at synonymous sites can
be accounted for by such a process. Importantly, the observed
substitutions appear to be present at particular sites so as to
avoid affecting mRNA stability. Our results have implications
for the manner in which codon usage bias should be analyzed
to detect selection and for attempts to estimate the mutation
rate.

Materials and methods
Orthologous rodent genes
We identified gene families from HOVERGEN (Release 44)
[91,92] with complete CDSs for Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and hamster. Orthology was defined as the topology
(((mouse, rat), hamster), non-rodent outgroup) within the
phylogenetic tree for a given gene, without intervening nonrodent branches between the rodents. Seventy well-described
genes matched these criteria and had a <5% size difference
between the longest and shortest CDS. Non-redundancy and
orthology were supported by syntenic comparisons [93].
Unless otherwise stated, N = 70 for all statistical tests.

Mouse mRNA sequences
Accession numbers from HOVERGEN were used to extract
mRNAs from the EnsEMBL genome assembly (Build 30)
[94]. When alternative transcripts existed, we used the rat
and hamster sequences to identify the desired exons. The
untranslated region (UTR) database (Release 15) [95,96] was
used for six genes because the UTRs in the EnsEMBL files

RNA secondary structure prediction
There are two main computational approaches to predicting
RNA secondary structure. The first is a thermodynamic
method, which assumes that a given sequence will fold into
the structure with the minimum free energy [101]. The second
approach compares multiple orthologous sequences to identify patterns of co-evolution between sites that could be indicative of compensatory mutations [102] to maintain
complementary base-pairing within stems [103-108].
In the context of our analysis, the choice is highly constrained
and comparative methods may not be applicable to the
hypothesis we test. Comparative methods require all input
sequences to be of high quality and for the alignment to be
accurate. Here we are particularly interested in knowing
where substitutions have occurred in a given mammalian lineage and, therefore, need sequence from three species, with
mouse-rat-hamster being the obvious choice. Currently, however, rat genomic sequence is not of sufficiently high quality
and annotation of UTRs is unreliable. UTRs from hamster are
largely unavailable.
Although a moot point under the above circumstances, it may
also be undesirable to apply a comparative method in the current context, not least because the logic would be circular: the
method requires us to assume that selection is strong enough
to maintain secondary structure, while at the same time we
are testing for selection. More importantly, based on the evolution of non-coding RNAs, comparative methods are geared
towards detecting secondary structure that has been conserved despite sequence divergence [49], that is, well-conserved substructures exist which tend to have specific
functions (for example, the anti-codon within a tRNA must
always be within a loop). For mRNA, however, a more

sample half the dataset, where the full data set analysis suggested significance (Additional data file 3). Consequently we
conclude that the results are not obviously biased by the
inclusion of long sequence.

Protein function and secondary structure prediction
The attributes of mouse gene products were obtained from
the Gene Ontology database (June 2004) [124].

β-sheet (strand) and coil regions using PSIPRED (Version
2.3) [125,126] under default parameters (masking low complexity regions).

Structure and stability were predicted using RNAfold from
the Vienna package (Version 1.4) [110,111] under default settings (folding at 37°C, tolerating non-Watson-Crick G:U
pairs). Thermodynamic parameters were derived experimentally [112]. RNAfold implements an algorithm that, for a given
RNA, finds the conformation with the minimum free energy
by maximizing favorable base-pairing interactions [101].

realistic model is that selection favors the stability of the
mRNA conformation as a whole [17,18]. Highly conserved
substructures are not expected a priori [109], in part because
such conservation may not always be possible, as proteincoding function should outweigh any RNA structure considerations. Essentially, the model assumes that the mRNA will
adopt the optimal structure given the available sequence.

While minimum free energy predictions often agree with laboratory-based methods (for example, stem-loops are avoided
at the AUG initiation codon, [120-123]), they are less reliable
for long sequences (for example, [112]). The mean length of
transcripts in our dataset is 2,101.41 ± 139.84 nucleotides
(nt). Consequently, where relevant, we endeavored to control
for length effects. In most cases, we carried out the same analyses for mRNAs shorter than 2,000 nt (N = 36, mean mRNA
length of 1219.38 ± 77.32 nt), this being the cut-off defining
two halves of the dataset. Through Mantell simulations, we
found that, when testing for selection on stability, in no

Second, one must also ask whether the genes contain introns.
Generation of a globally stable structure would require the
action of spliceosome-associated helicases (for example, [117119]) to maximize the amount of available sequence. Indeed,
it is significant that intronless genes in yeast are less biased
for structure than those with introns [56]. All genes in our
dataset contain introns, further suggesting global stability to
be the more relevant measure. Nonetheless, our assumption
of global maximum stability, while an appropriate functional
hypothesis, may at best only be a good approximation, as in
some cases (for example, short transcripts) there may not be
enough time for an mRNA to discover the most optimal
structure.

The number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) and the synonymous (Ks) distance were
estimated with the Li method [127] using the Kimura 2parameter model. We excluded one fast-evolving gene (Ka =
0.5; Ks = 0.17) in our analyses of evolutionary rates, although
inclusion of the outlier gave similar results.

reports

A second methodological issue concerns whether selection
might act on stability at the local or global scale. There are two
critical issues when choosing which to assess. First, if opposite ends of a molecule are able to pair with one another,
RNAs may adopt a conformation closer to a global optimal
structure. In eukaryotes, unlike bacteria (where transcription
and translation are simultaneous and co-localized), longrange interactions between opposite ends of mRNA molecules can occur [113-116]. This suggests that global [20]
rather than local stability is more important to analysis of
mammalian sequence.

Mantell simulations
To determine whether the incorporation of long genes substantially biased our results, for each modification/randomization protocol, we considered the effect of removing the half
of the dataset containing the longest genes. Given that this
subset of small mRNAs is by necessity half the size of the full
dataset, it is inevitable that P-values will be increased. The
issue is whether they have increased more than would be
expected had we randomly sampled half the dataset. To this
end, we randomly extracted 36 genes and re-calculated the
significance from t-tests. This was repeated 10,000 times per
modification/randomization protocol, yielding the underlying distribution in P-values that would be expected were
sequence length unimportant. The observed P-value (for the
shortest genes) was then compared to this expected distribution (see Additional data file 3).
