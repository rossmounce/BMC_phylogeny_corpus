Abstract
Background: With the exception of the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1, all herpesviruses characterized thus far infect
only vertebrates. Some cause neurological disease in their hosts, while others replicate or become latent in
neurological tissues. Recently a new herpesvirus causing ganglioneuritis in abalone, a gastropod, was discovered.
Molecular analysis of new herpesviruses, such as this one and others, still to be discovered in invertebrates, will
provide insight into the evolution of herpesviruses.
Results: We sequenced the genome of a neurotropic virus linked to a fatal ganglioneuritis devastating parts of a
valuable wild abalone fishery in Australia. We show that the newly identified virus forms part of an ancient clade
with its nearest relatives being a herpesvirus infecting bivalves (oyster) and, unexpectedly, one we identified, from
published data, apparently integrated within the genome of amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate. Predicted
protein sequences from the abalone virus genome have significant similarity to several herpesvirus proteins
including the DNA packaging ATPase subunit of (putative) terminase and DNA polymerase. Conservation of amino
acid sequences in the terminase across all herpesviruses and phylogenetic analysis using the DNA polymerase and
terminase proteins demonstrate that the herpesviruses infecting the molluscs, oyster and abalone, are distantly
related. The terminase and polymerase protein sequences from the putative amphioxus herpesvirus share more
sequence similarity with those of the mollusc viruses than with sequences from any of the vertebrate herpesviruses
analysed.
Conclusions: A family of mollusc herpesviruses, Malacoherpesviridae, that was based on a single virus infecting
oyster can now be further established by including a distantly related herpesvirus infecting abalone, which, like
many vertebrate viruses is neurotropic. The genome of Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus) provides evidence for
the existence of a herpesvirus associated with this invertebrate chordate. The virus which likely infected amphioxus
is, by molecular phylogenetic analysis, more closely related to the other 2 invertebrate viruses than to
herpesviruses infecting vertebrates (ie chordates).

Findings
In 2005 there was an outbreak of acute ganglioneuritis in
an Australian population of the edible gastropod mollusc,
abalone or Haliotis spp[1]. Using transmission electron
microscopy, herpes-like particles were observed in

ganglia of affected abalone[2] and purified virions from
moribund abalone nervous tissues were identified as
resembling those of herpesviruses, having an icosohedral
capsid approximately 100 nm in diameter surrounded by
a 150 nm diameter spiked envelope[3]. Potential herpesvirus particles were also identified previously in Taiwan
following mortalities in Haliotis diversicolor [4]. Recently
a diagnostic PCR test has been developed to detect the
abalone virus [5]. The test has detected viral DNA

sequences in diseased abalone from separate geographical
locations in Australia and in DNA isolated from a
herpes-like virus found some time ago in Taiwan[4].
Three herpesvirus families have been described in the
order Herpesvirales - the Herpesviridae which infect
Mammalia, Aves and Reptilia, the Alloherpesviridae
infecting Amphibia and Osteichthyes (bony fish), and the
mollusc-infecting Malacoherpesviridae containing a single virus that infects an invertebrate class, Bivalvia
[6-8]. The phylogenetic relationships of these herpesviruses have been well studied and their evolution over
epochs is largely synchronous with host lineages [7,8].
Gastropods separated early in the Cambrian period from
all other known herpesvirus hosts. This unique evolutionary positioning[6] combined with our discovery of a
related herpesvirus genome apparently integrated into
the genome of another invertebrate, amphioxus, expands
the Herpesvirales order and provides two key links to
understanding the nature of the ancient ancestors of
mollusc and vertebrate herpesviruses. To understand the
structural and evolutionary relationships of the abalone
virus to other herpesviruses, we purified abalone virus
particles and isolated and sequenced genomic DNA
using methods previously described[3,9]. The DNA was
subjected to multiple displacement amplification[10] and
sequenced using the Roche 454 GS-FLX system followed
by partial genome assembly using the Newbler algorithm (Roche).
Based on the assembled DNA sequences of the abalone virus, several protein coding sequences predicted
using Artemis[11] showed varying distant homology to
herpesvirus proteins, most notably those of Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (oyster herpesvirus 1, OsHV-1), a virus infecting bivalve mollusc species[12,13]. BLAST analysis[14]
of assembled sequence contigs based on predicted proteins identified 39 full length homologues of OsHV-1
genes (Table 1). These coding sequences, within partial
genome scaffold sequences, or as individual coding
sequences, have been submitted to Genbank. None of
the coding sequences identified appear to be split by
introns. Full-length sequences encoding homologues of
DNA polymerase and the DNA packaging ATPase subunit of the (putative) terminase (henceforth referred to as
the polymerase and terminase respectively), were identified and chosen for use in sequence alignments and
phylogenetic analysis (Figures 1 &2). Hereafter, we will
refer to the new abalone virus as abalone herpesvirus or
AbHV-1.
During the search for homologues of predicted AbHV1 proteins using BLAST we identified, in the non-redundant (nr) Genbank protein sequence database, Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus) coding sequences with
significant homology to some of those in AbHV-1. The
genome of amphioxus has been recently sequenced [15]

although final assembly of chromosomes is not yet complete. On further analysis of amphioxus coding sequences
using BLASTP with the predicted protein sequences of
the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1 genome (Genbank
NC_005881), we identified 19 herpesvirus gene homologues. Consistent with this being an integrated virus,
we found that 18 of these genes are clustered within a
150 kb region of a single amphioxus scaffold BRAFLscaffold_217, including the herpesvirus specific terminase
gene[16] and all but 4 of these genes do not contain
introns. These virus coding sequences appear to be legitimately assembled within published genome sequence
scaffolds and are therefore probably integrated within the
amphioxus genome. Further experiments such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation of chromosomes would confirm this. The 19 coding sequences identified are listed in
Table 2 along with their OsHV-1 homologues and
BLAST scores. We utilised the amphioxus virus terminase and polymerase protein sequence homologues in
our analyses.
The putative terminase, or DNA packaging ATPase,
appears specific to herpesviruses and some bacteriophages, such as T4[16] and is thought to be an enzyme
motor involved in packaging viral DNA into preformed
capsids[17]. We used the ATPase motif from this protein to investigate the phylogeny of the herpesviruses.
The ATP hydrolase (ATPase) motif sequences from 20
of the 34 terminase proteins listed in Table 3, plus their
T4 bacteriophage homologue and the amphioxus terminase homologue (XP_002591195.1, listed in Table 2),
were identified using Interproscan[18] and aligned using
ClustalW[19]. Figure 1 shows that 12 amino acids are
conserved across all herpesvirus ATPase domain
sequences, including those from the abalone, oyster and
amphioxus virus genomes, indicating the placement of
the abalone virus and putative amphioxus virus within
the Herpesvirales order. A common ancestral origin
for the mollusc and amphioxus viruses is confirmed by
the absence of introns in the terminase gene and the
presence of additional amino acid loops (Figure 1).
Although being in the same clade (Figure 2), at a protein sequence level the mollusc viruses are only moderately related with 40% amino acid identity in this
conserved viral protein, across their full length.
The phylogenetic analysis comparing concatenated
polymerase and terminase full-length proteins (Figure 2,
Table 3), illustrates the evolutionary relationships within
the Herpesvirales order. The five Alloherpesviridae
viruses are clustered together, with separate clades for
frog and fish viruses as found previously [8], and the
Herpesviridae are clustered into separate major clades
reflecting their taxonomic groupings of alpha-, beta- and
gammaherpesvirinae sub-families. The phylogenetic analysis confirms a relationship between the amphioxus

Cambrian era, the Bilaterial species diverged to generate
the Protostomes (evolving into such animals as flatworms, molluscs and arthropods) and the Deuterostomes (from which the chordates and then the
vertebrates evolved)[20,21]. Molluscs emerged more
than 100 My before vertebrates with a bony skeleton
(the current known range of herpesviruses in vertebrates). One hypothesis to explain the diversity of
viruses within vertebrates and the positioning of the

mollusc viruses among them, rather than as an ancestral
outgroup, is the existence of diverse herpesviruses in
Cambrian metazoans. Consistent with this hypothesis,
previous estimates for the divergence of just the Herpesviridae in vertebrates indicate a divergence of alpha-,
beta- and gammaherpesviruses to over 400 Mya, and
longer times are predicted for divergence of Alloherpesviridae and Malacoherpesviridae[7]. An alternate
hypothesis to explain the branching of the 3 herpesvirus

families is that molluscs acquired herpesviruses by transmission in the aquatic environment, for example
through association such as mollusc predation of early
chordates. It appears that modern Malacoherpesviridae
may have the ability to infect across species, a feature
not typically observed in vertebrate herpesviruses,
although the infection observed is restricted to related
mollusc species[22].
As more sequence data and gene structure for Alloherpesviridae, Malacoherpesviridae and other invertebrate herpesviruses become available it will allow a

more informative analysis of their evolution. Of particular interest will be new herpesviruses yet to be discovered in species which share bilateral symmetry such as
amphioxus, sea squirts, flatworms or squid. Our discovery of clustered intact herpesvirus genes in amphioxus
suggests an opportunistic integration has occurred in
the amphioxus genome. This may not be a normal feature of infection and latency, but herpesviruses can
occasionally integrate into the genome of their host[23].
Surprisingly, the nearest relatives of this chordate virus
seem to be the viruses infecting molluscs rather than
those of fish or frogs. Although herpesvirus particles
have not been seen in the more primitive metazoan species, their existence is suspected; short herpes-like DNA
sequences having been found in a metagenomic study of
Hawaian coral[24]. Further metagenomic approaches
similar to those described previously[25] and PCR-directed approaches[26] based on new sequences described
here will enable these evolutionary questions to be
addressed. The sequence information is also crucial for
the development of molecular diagnostic tools to monitor and manage disease outbreaks.
The neurotropism of certain herpesviruses is well
documented but this behaviour is not known outside
the families of herpesviruses infecting terrestrial vertebrates[27,28]. The neurotropic tissue infection profile
of the new gastropod virus analysed here is shared
with some viruses within the Herpesviridae family.
Convergent evolution may have given rise to the neurotropism seen in some members of the Herpesviridae
and now the Malacoherpesviridae families. The rooting
of a neurotropic invertebrate virus near or before the
divergence of alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses,
may also suggest that early mammalian herpesvirus
precursors were neurotropic and that some have
retained this feature over time. It is interesting to speculate as to the earliest functional interactions between
sensory cells and viruses, as the first sign of neurons
appeared over 600 million years ago in âcnidarians,â
(eg: hydra), but organisms basal to them like sponges
do not have neurons or synapses[29]. Recent evidence
indicates sponges have gene networks in cells which
were precursors to nerve cells including proteins
related to virus nerve entry receptors[30]. Others[24]
have speculated on a link between herpesvirus neurotropism and the evolution of modern herpesviruses
from ancestors infecting invertebrates such as Cnidaria
(for example, coral or sea anemones), thought to be
related to the first species with sensory receptors[31].
Further, the discovery reported here of a putative herpesvirus integrated into the genome of amphioxus
hints at a wide diversity of herpesviruses within the
invertebrate community, perhaps dating back to before
the divergence of arthropods, molluscs and chordates.

It will be exciting to discover such invertebrate herpesviruses and explore their links to ancient herpesvirus
ancestors.
To accommodate the new abalone virus, which we
have suggested naming abalone herpesvirus or AbHV-1,
within the Herpesvirales order, we suggest the creation
of a new genus called Haliotivirus within the Malacoherpesviridae family and assignment of AbHV-1 as a
species under Haliotivirus (as Haliotid herpesvirus 1).
We have referred to the putative virus genome integrated into the Branchiostomid species chromosome as
amphioxus-associated virus, AaHV-1. We suggest the
species name Branchiostomid herpesvirus 1. Given the
unique nature of the virus revealed by phylogenetic analysis and the unique evolutionary positioning of
amphioxus as an invertebrate chordate, we suggest this
virus, if classified, could be a member of a new family,
Aspondyloherpesviridae (from the Greek for âno spineâ).
