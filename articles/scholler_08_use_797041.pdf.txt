Abstract
Background: Strategies to discover circulating protein markers of ovarian cancer are urgently
needed. We developed a novel technology that permits us to isolate recombinant antibodies
directed against the potential serum biomarkers, to facilitate the further development of affinity
reagents necessary to construct diagnostic tests.
Methods: This study presents a novel discovery approach based on serum immunoprecipitation
with cancer-specific in vivo biotinylated recombinant antibodies (biobodies) derived from
differentially selected yeast-display scFv, and analysis of the eluted serum proteins by
electrophoresis and/or mass spectrometry.
Results: Using this strategy we identified catabolic fragments of complement factors, EMILIN2,
Von Willebrand factor and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1 or RKIP) in patient
sera. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a soluble form of PEBP1 in human. Independent
evidence for ovarian cancer-specific expression of PEBP1 in patient sera was found by ELISA assays
and antibody arrays with anti-PEBP1 antibodies. PEBP1 was detected in 29 out of 30 ascites samples
and discriminated ovarian cancer sera from controls (p = 0.02). Finally, we confirmed by western
blots the presence of a 21–23 kDa fragment corresponding to the expected size of PEBP1 but we
also showed additional bands of 38 kDa and 50–52 kDa in various tissues and cell lines.
Conclusion: We conclude that the novel strategy described here allows the identification of
candidate biomarkers that can be variants of normally expressed proteins or that display cancerspecific post-translational modifications.

Background
New biomarkers with the potential to detect disease early
are critically needed for ovarian cancer. This study
describes an innovative strategy to identify circulating
proteins that signal disease. Our technology also permits
isolation of recombinant antibodies directed against the
potential biomarkers, which may facilitate the further
development of affinity reagents necessary to build up
diagnostic tests. Cancer-specific biotinylated recombinant
antibodies (biobodies or Bbs [1]) were derived from a
yeast-display recombinant antibody (single-chain Fragment variable or scFv) library [2] selected by multiple
rounds of magnetic and fluorescence cell sorting for scFv
that bind to sera from ovarian cancer patients (case-pool
serum) but not to sera of healthy women (control-pool
serum). Candidate biomarkers were immunoprecipitated
from case-pool serum with cancer-specific biobodies and
eluted for analysis. The quality of the procedure was evaluated by independent mass spectrometry experiments
after tryptic digestion in-gel of the eluates separated by 1D or 2-D gel electrophoresis, or in-solution directly from
biobody eluates. One of the candidate markers identified
was PEBP1, a member of the evolutionarily conserved
phosphatidylethanolamine-(PE) binding proteins. As
antibodies were commercially available, PEBP1 was further evaluated by ELISA test using an independent set of
ovarian cancer ascites, by western blots on a panel of normal and tumor tissues and tumor cell lines, and by antibody arrays with a new set of case and control sera [3].
PEBP1 was found to be significantly elevated in patient
sera on the antibody arrays as well as present in patient
ascites by ELISA. PEBP1 is normally a basic cytosolic protein but our results suggest the existence in patient fluids
of a soluble form of PEBP1 that is a serum marker for
ovarian cancer.

Methods
1) Overall strategy
The overall procedure to identify serum biomarkers is
summarized in Figure 1. Cancer-specific biobodies were
derived from yeast-display scFv selected by magnetic (fig.
1A1, B, C) and fluorescent (fig. 1A2) cell sortings for binding to sera from ovarian cancer patients but not to sera
from healthy women. Recognition sequences of the
selected yeast-display scFv were PCR amplified and cloned
by gap repair into pTOR2 vector (fig. 1D) to produce casespecific yeast secreting scFv. The yeast secreting scFvs were
mated with yeast carrying pTOR-BIR vector to generate
case-specific diploid yeast that secreted in vivo biotinylated scFv (biobodies) (fig. 1E). Potential biomarkers
were immunoprecipitated with cancer-specific biobodies,
eluted (fig. 1F) and identified by mass spectrometry (fig.
1H) after tryptic digestion performed in-gel after protein
electrophoresis or directly in-solution (fig. 1G).

2) Sera and ascites
For yeast-display scFv screening and immunoprecipitation, we used a discovery sample set of 22 sera, including
10 sera from serous ovarian carcinoma patients (stage IIIC
n = 9 and stage IVB n = 1 with moderately n = 3 or poorly
differentiated tumors n = 7) and 12 control sera (benign
serous cysts n = 4, abnormal pap smear but normal ovaries n = 1, and healthy controls n = 7). Sera from ovarian
cancer patients and sera from benign and healthy controls
were pooled to create case- and control-pool sera, respectively. Sera were obtained from women who were fasting
and under anesthesia. Diagnoses were made based on
information in the clinical pathology report. All serum
specimens were collected at Swedish Hospital, Seattle,
WA, and were processed in similar fashion within 4 hours
of collection. They were centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10
minutes, and the serum was aliquoted and frozen at 80°C. These pools were first depleted of abundant serum
proteins using cibacron blue beads [4] and then biotinylated with the EZ-link sulfo-NHS LC biotin kit (Fisher
Biotech, Fair Lawn, NJ) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Finally, biotinylated sera were dialyzed
against 4 liters of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher)
overnight (ON) at 4°C and stored at -80°C. Protein concentrations were evaluated with the Nanoorange Protein
Quantitation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

For validation purposes, a novel antibody array platform
was probed with a validation sample set characterized in
[3]. Briefly, the validation sample set included 65 independent serum samples from 31 serous ovarian cancer
cases, including 2 that were diagnosed as stage IA, 2 diagnosed as stage IC, 1 stage IIA, 1 stage IIC, 2 stage IIIB, 18
stage IIIC, 4 stage IVA and 1 stage IVB, and from 34 controls, including healthy women (n = 16), women with
benign ovarian disease (n = 10), and women undergoing
surgery for gynecological conditions but who have histologically normal ovaries (n = 8). The age at collection
ranged from 52 to 87 years old (mean 61.6; standard deviation 9.8) for the ovarian cancer cases and was very similar for the controls (range 42–86, with mean 60.9 and
standard deviation 10.6). Samples from women undergoing surgery were obtained prior to surgery and chemotherapy.
For ELISA, 30 ascites from patients with ovarian cancers of
different origins were used, including serous (21) diagnosed as stage IIIA (1), IIIB (2), IIIC (15), IVA (2) or
unknown (1), mesodermal (mullerian) mixed tumor
stage IVA (1), mucinous (2) recurrent or IIIC, adnocarcinomas (2) stage IVB or IIIC, clear cell stage IIIC (1), and
endometrioid (3) stage IIIB, IIIC or IVA. Fluid was aspirated in the operating room at the time of surgery, and the
cells were removed by centrifugation before the supernatant fluid was frozen at -80°C. Data on whether the cellu-

lar component was malignant or benign was recorded in
the pathology report. Some western blots were loaded
with cell lysates from cells removed by centrifugation
from ascites fluids of six patients with serous ovarian cancer (metastatic disease n = 5; stage IIC n = 1; papillary n =
3; recurrent tubal primary n = 1).

3) Yeast media and antibodies
Yeast-display scFv were grown in synthetic selective
medium containing 0.5% Casamino Acids (Fisher) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS) (Gibco/Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), and induced in selective
medium supplemented with 2% galactose, 2% rafinose,

0.1% dextrose, and 1% PS as previously described [1,5].
Anti-c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA);
Alexa Fluor® 488 F(ab')2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG
(H+L) (488 anti-mIg) was purchased from Invitrogen and
phytoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (SA-PE) was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA).
Three antibodies against PEBP1 were purchased from
Abgent (San Diego, CA) and Millipore (Fisher). The purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) from Abgent were
raised against synthetic peptides selected from the conserved central PE-binding region of human PEBP1 (center
pAb) or from the N-terminal region (N-term pAb). AntiPEBP1 pAb from Millipore was raised against a GST-fused
full-length rat PEBP1 recombinant protein and used for
ELISA and western blots. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibodies used for ELISA assays
were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).
4) Differential screening of a yeast-display library for scFv
that bind preferentially to ovarian cancer sera and
generation of case-serum-specific biobodies
The yeast-display scFv library created by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was used [2]. This
library was constructed from human naïve B-lymphocytes
and its size is 2 × 109 yeast-display scFv. Incubations of
yeast-display scFv with biotinylated human sera were carried out with 108 to 109 yeast per ml in PBE [PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis MO) and 4 mM EDTA (Promega)] for 30
minutes at 4°C. Sublibraries of yeast-display scFv that
bound to biotinylated case-pool serum were derived from
the entire yeast-display scFv library [2] first by magnetic
sorting using streptavidin or anti-biotin magnetic beads
(Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) and MACS LS separation columns
(Miltenyi), and then by fluorescent cell sorting using the
BD FACSAria™ cell sorter (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) as previously described [1,5].
Next, the enriched sublibraries were depleted for the scFv
that bound to the control-pool serum by magnetic sorting, using anti-biotin magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and
MACS LD separation columns (Miltenyi) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The effluents containing
yeast-display scFv that did not bind to control-pool serum
were subsequently enriched one more time for scFv binding to case serum. In some experiments the effluents were
enriched for c-myc-expresser yeast with anti-c-myc magnetic beads (Milenyi) to remove yeast that failed to bind
to the control column because they lacked scFv expression. The recognition sequences of the yeast-display scFv
that demonstrated a preferential binding to case- over
control-pool serum were amplified by PCR and cloned in
yeast by gap repair using co-transformation with pTOR2

vector [1] for production of tagged, yeast-secreted scFv.
We previously described a method to in vivo biotinylate
scFv on a specific target site that is separated from scFv
binding site by a flexible linker (IgA hinge) [1]. Using this
method, the scFv binding site is not compromised by random biotin-binding to any available lysines. Furthermore,
scFv form tetramers of high affinity in presence of streptavidin, which improves their conformational stability and
makes it possible to use them as detector reagents in diagnostic tests [1,5,6]. To in vivo biotinylate the scFv, scFvsecretor yeast were mated with yeast carrying a biotin
ligase fused to golgi-localization signals encoded by pTOR
BIR [1] to generate diploid yeast that secrete case serumspecific biobodies. Finally, biobodies were purified on
HIS-Select™ Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and used
to immunoprecipitate candidate biomarkers from serum
pools (Fig. 1F).
5) Immunoprecipitation of case specific-serum proteins
with biobodies (Bbs)
Eight hundred μl of serum from case and control pools
were incubated with 8 μg of biobodies ON at 4°C with
rotation. Then 50 μl of streptavidin-coated micromagnetic
beads (μMACS Streptavidin Kit, Miltenyi) were added to
the serum pool/biobody complexes, incubated 1 hour at
4°C with rotation and loaded onto μMACS columns
(Miltenyi). Immunoprecipitated serum proteins were
eluted in loading buffer according to manufacturer's
instructions for protein electrophoresis or with 8 M Urea
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for shotgun
mass spectrometry.
6) Protein electrophoresis
Five μl of eluate in loading buffer were separated on one
dimensional (1-D) (NuPAGE® Gel, 4–12%, 10 wells, Invitrogen) or on two dimensional (2-D) protein gels. For 2D gels, immunoprecipitates from case- and control-pool
sera were treated with the 2-D Cleanup Kit (Amersham)
according to manufacturer's instructions, protocol A. The
precipitated samples were resuspended in 250 ml rehydration buffer, 8 M urea (Amersham), 2% w/v CHAPS (Calbiochem, Darrnstadt Germany), 0.5% IPG Buffer pH3 to
pH10 NL (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), 0.002%
bromophenol blue (GE Healthcare), 0.1% dithiolthreotol
(DTT) (Fisher), centrifuged briefly to remove particulate
matter, and transferred into isoelectric focusing chambers.
A 13 centimeter Immobiline Dry Strip pH3 to pH10 NL
was immersed in each sample, overlain with IPG Cover
Fluid (GE Healthcare) and focused in an Ettan IPGphor™
Isoleclectric Focuser according to the following protocol:
Rehydration 12 hours at 50 volts per strip, step to 500
volts 1 hour, gradient to 1000 volts 1 hour, gradient to
8000 volts 2.5 hours, hold 8000 volts 8 hours, step to 500
volts for 2 or more hours.

2-D electrophoresis was performed on an Ettan IPGphor™
Isolelectric Focusing System (Amersham) accordingly to
the manufacturer's instructions. Two vertical 14 × 13 centimeters × 1.0 millimeter 10% acrylamide gels were prepared using 30% acrylamide bis 29:1 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gels also contained 0.19
M Tris HCl pH 8.8, 0.075% SDS, 0.025% TEMED (GE
Healthcare) and 0.06% ammonium persulfate (GE
Healthcare). The gels were overlaid with running buffer:
250 mM Tris base, 1.92 M glycine, 1% SDS. The focused
Immobiline Dry strips were washed gently in nanopure
water and incubated separately at room temperature for
15 minutes with gentle agitation in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris
HCL pH8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol (Fisher), 2% SDS,
0.002% bromophenol blue containing 100 mg of DTT.
The strips were then gently washed again with nanopure
water and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature
(RT) in 10 ml of the same solution but with 250 ml of
iodoacetimide (GE Healthcare) instead of DTT. Each strip
was laid edgewise on the surface of an acrylamide gel and
the running buffer was poured off and replaced with running buffer containing 0.5% agarose (Fisher Scientific),
0.5% bromophenol blue to completely fill the space
above the gels. The gels were placed in Hoefer SE 600
Ruby Electrophoresis Boxes (Amersham) and electrophoresed with Tris Glycine SDS running buffer at 15 milliamps per gel for 30 minutes and then at 25 milliamps
per gel until the dye front reached the bottom edge.
Protein were visualized with SilverQuest™ Silver Staining
Kit (Invitrogen) and bands/spots that were differentially
expressed by case vs. control samples were excised with a
clean razor blade from both case and control sample electrophoresis (1D gel) or from case sample only (2D gel)
and identified by mass spectrometry and the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) [7].
7) Mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis
For in-solution digestion of proteins (e.g., as described in
detail by [8]), samples were prepared using standard
approaches. Briefly, samples from control and case eluted
in 8 M urea were diluted to 1 M urea in 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with DTT, alkylated with
iodoacetamide, and digested ON with sequencing grade
trypsin (Promega). The resulting peptides were acidified
and desalted using C18 spin columns (The Nest Group,
Southborough, MA). Peptides were resuspended in 0.1%
formic acid and nitrogen bomb loaded onto an in-house
packed C18 (75 μm by 9 cm) reverse phase column/emitter (New Objectives, Woburn, MA).

In-solution digested peptides were evaluated using an
LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnegan). Peptides were
eluted with a 150 minute linear gradient of increasing acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The tandem mass spectrom-

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6/1/41

eter was configured so that one full MS spectrum was
collected followed by collision-induced fragmentation
and MS/MS spectra acquisition on the 8 most intense
ions. Dynamic exclusion was set at 2 for 30 seconds. Peptides were identified using bioworks/TurboSequest (version 3.2) using an NCBI human database allowing only
for strict trypsin digestion. For filtering of the data, an
inverted (decoy) database was used to calculate the falsediscovery rate. Data reported are filtered at a false-discovery rate below 1% at the peptide level.
1-D and 2-D gel analysis were evaluated following tryptic
digest using high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT,
or LTQ, Thermo Finnegan). All data were evaluated using
a freely available version of CPAS 2.0 [7]http://
cpas.fhcrc.org, where raw data was converted to mzXML
form and searched using the X!Tandem [9] search engine
configured with k-score [10] against IPI version
20060111, then evaluated using peptide prophet [11]. All
proteins containing at least two peptides exceeding 0.95
detection probability, exceeded minimal ionization percentages (15%) and were not common contaminants
(e.g., Keratin) were considered for further analysis.
8) ELISA
ELISA immunoassays were performed in Nunc Amino™
plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) coated with ascites from
ovarian cancer patients diluted 1:1,000 in bicarbonate
buffer (Carbonate-Bicarbonate Buffer Capsules, SigmaAldrich) for 1 hour at RT. All other incubations were done
in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween (Fisher) (PBST),
at RT for 30 min with gentle agitation. After three PBST
washes, ascites-coated wells were incubated with antiPEBP1 antibodies; pAbs were diluted to 250 ng/ml. After
three washes with PBST, wells were incubated with HRPanti-rabbit Ig diluted 1:2000. Finally colorimetric signals
were generated with TMB One Solution (Promega),
stopped with 1N H2SO4 (Acros Organics USA, Morris
Planes, NJ) and read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax M5/M5e
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
9) Western blots
Western blots were performed as previously described [1]
with the following modifications: lanes were loaded with
5 μg of PEBP1-GST fusion protein (46–49 kDa) (Abnova
Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan), 5 μg of ascites cell
lysates, 15 μg of tissue lysates or 5 μg of cell lysates.
10) Antibody arrays
A novel high-density microarray platform that has the
capacity to hold more than 18,000 binding agents (here
we used antibodies directed against candidate biomarkers) was created, validated as previously described [3] and
probed here with ovarian cancer and control sera. Briefly,
analysis of hybridization was performed for fold-change

of signal (case or control compared to reference channel).
Fold-change of signal was calculated as log Rc/Gc; where
Rc is red corrected (Cy5 spot signal minus background)
and Gc is green corrected (Cy3 spot signal minus Cy3
background). Following normalization, triplicate spots
were summarized using their median and classification
was performed using logistic regression predicting case
status based on log (fold-change), and including covariates adjusting for day and batch effects used in the fabrication and hybridization of the arrays. The probability
score (p-value determined by Wilcoxon sign-rank testing)
corresponding to the coefficient of the protein (e.g., log
ratio) was used as the per-antibody significance measure.

Results
1) Yeast-display library enrichment and depletion
A yeast-display scFv library [2] was first enriched for protein serum-specific scFv with biotinylated case-pool
serum by magnetic and flow sortings (fig. 1A1–2), until
more than 95% of the selected yeast expressed scFv that
bound to biotinylated case-pool serum (fig 2A,C, upper
right quadrants). But the selected yeast also bound to the

biotinylated control-pool serum (fig 2B,D, upper right
quadrants). Thus, various regimens of depletion for yeast
that bound to control-pool serum were tried in independent experiments. Immobilization of albumin-depleted
control-pool serum on a plastic plate for panning gave
poor results, and depletion experiments using biotinylated albumin-depleted control-pool serum for fluorescent cytometry sorting biased the selection towards yeast
that did not express scFv (non-expresser yeast) (data not
shown). The best results were obtained with magnetic
sorting using depletion columns (see Experimental Procedures) for retrieval of control serum-binding scFv.
Although depletion with control-pool serum at concentrations of 100 μg/ml biased the selection toward nonexpresser yeast (data not shown), depletion with 30 μg/ml
of control-pool serum yielded a population of yeast-display scFv that strongly bound to 100 μg/ml of case-pool
serum (fig. 2G, upper right quadrant) and weakly bound
to 100 μg/ml of control-pool serum (fig. 2H, upper and
lower right quadrants). Of note, a discrete subset of this
selected population of yeast-display scFv bound to mesothelin recombinant antigen (meso-Ig) [12], a known

pools, before (A-D) or after depletion by magnetic sorting (E-H). Binding signals were detected as shown with the secondary

biomarker for ovarian cancer [13-15], while no binding to
meso-Ig was distinguishable using the naïve yeast-display
scFv library (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggested that the yeast-display scFv subtractive library
selected with 100 μg/ml of ovarian case-pool serum and
depleted with 30 μg/ml of control-pool serum was significantly enriched for scFv binding preferentially to serum
proteins from ovarian cancer patients. This yeast-display
scFv was used for the generation of cancer-specific biobodies (Bbs) as described in Experimental Procedures.
2) Identification of biomarkers by immunoprecipitation,
electrophoretic separation by 1D or 2D gels, and tandem
mass spectrometry after in-gel tryptic digestion
Albumin-depleted case- and control-pool sera were incubated with Bbs and streptavidin magnetic beads. The Bbs/
serum-protein/magnetic bead complexes were retrieved
using the μMACS system. Proteins were eluted and separated by electrophoresis and then visualized by silver
staining (fig. 3B). Despite a large number of common

the 1-D gel. A 96 kDa-band was preferentially immunoprecipitated from control-pool serum (fig. 3B, lane 2)
while five bands (22, 36, 42, 45 and 65 kDa) were preferentially immunoprecipitated from case-pool serum (fig.

3B, lane 1). On the 2-D gels, several spots migrated differentially between case and control, including the spot
shown in Figure 3C,D. The five bands preferentially
immunoprecipitated from case-pool serum (fig. 3B, lane
1), the corresponding fragments from the control-pool
serum immunoprecipitation, and the spot shown in Figure 3D were excised from the gels and identified by mass
spectrometry after in-gel tryptic digestion. In the 1D gels,
the bands preferentially immunoprecipitated from casepool serum yielded the complement C3 precursor (22
kDa-, 42 kDa- and 65 kDa-bands), the complement 4A
precursor (36 kDa- and 65 kDa-bands), SERPINA1 (42
kDa-band) and the complement 4B precursor (45 kDaband). Interestingly, the peptide coverage was noticeably
different from one band to another. In the 22 kDa-band,
peptides mapped over 6% of the complement C3 precursor and only in the C-terminal fraction, but in the 45 kDaand 65 kDa-bands they mapped over 19% and 32% of the
whole protein, respectively (Tables 2 and 3). Similarly, the
peptide coverage on the complement 4A precursor in the
36 kDa-band was of 5% of the C-terminal portion only,
while in the 65 kDa-band it was of 10% over the whole
protein. Finally, in the 2-D gels (spot indicated in Figure
3D, apparent molecular weight of 22 kDa) we identified
two unique peptides KLYTLVLTDP DAPSR and KGNDISSGTVLSDYVGSGPPK that were found by peptide prophet

(B lane 2, and C) and ovarian cancer (B lane 1, and D) were separated by 1-D (B) or 2-D (C,D) protein electrophoresis and
detected by silver staining. In the 2-D gels, the immunoprecipitates were focused over a pH3 to pH10 range and run on a 10%
acrylamide gel. The circle indicates the region where PEBP1 was found in patient serum (D) but not in control serum (C).

4) Validation of PEBP1 by ELISA assay, western blots and
antibody array
By detection ELISA assays, polyclonal antibodies (pAb)
against the N-terminal (anti-PEBP1 N-term pAb), the
center of PEBP1 (anti-PEBP1 center pAb), and the whole
protein (anti-PEBP1 pAb), detected the presence of PEBP1
in 29 out of 30 ovarian cancer ascites, including ascites
from ovarian cancers of non-serous origin (fig. 4). The
only ascites that did not contain PEBP1 was from a patient
with endometrioid ovarian cancer (fig. 4).

Proteomics analysis (LC-MS/MS) was also performed
directly without electrophoresis on eluted proteins from
the immunoprecipitations of control- and case-pool sera
with case-specific biobodies. In the case sample, 60 peptides representing a total of 24 proteins were identified
(Table 1), while no proteins or peptides were identified in
the control group. Many of the assigned proteins were
antibody fragments and complement associated proteins.
These proteins were highly enriched indicated by the fact

that only two peptides for human serum albumin and for
haptoglobin, two of the most abundant sera proteins,
were detected. In addition, this screen also identified EMILIN-2 and Von Willebrand factor.

These two peptide hits met our criteria for robustness
because they resulted from CPAS analysis, exceeded 0.95
detection probability, had at least 15% of minimal ionization percentages and were not common contaminants.

control sera. This analysis generated preferential binding
of anti-PEBP1 antibody to case serum with a p-value of
0.02, demonstrating that the presence of PEBP1 in serum
is able to differentiate ovarian carcinoma from control
sera. Anti-PEBP1 center pAb ranked 17 out of 338 full
length antibodies and performed better than 4 out of 8
anti-CA125 mAbs [3] in preferential binding to the serum
of individual cancer patients, suggesting that PEBP1 is a
marker for ovarian cancer.

Discussion
We have developed an innovative strategy to identify
novel serum biomarkers for ovarian carcinoma using casespecific yeast-secreted in vivo biotinylated recombinant
antibodies (biobodies or Bbs) to immunoprecipitate
potential biomarkers. Candidate biomarkers were identified using a discovery sample set of 22 sera and validated
on an independent sample set of 65 sera and 30 ascites
fluids. Immunoprecipitated proteins from case- and control-pool sera (eluates) were separated by 1-D and 2-D gel
electrophoresis and differentially expressed bands or
spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry analysis, or eluates were directly analyzed by shotgun mass spectrometry
after in-solution tryptic digestion. Shotgun mass spectrometry confirmed the results of 1-D gel by identifying
multiple fragments of the complement cascade and in
addition found EMILIN2 and Von Willebrand factor.
Interestingly, EMILIN2 has been found to play a role in
trophoblast invasion of the uterine wall and is enriched at
the level of mRNA expression in ovarian serous tumors
[16,17], and Von Willebrand factor has been associated
with multiple cancers [18]. Analysis by 2-D gel identified
a member of the PEBP family, PEBP1.
We did not identify well-known ovarian cancer markers
such as CA125 [19], HE4 [20,21] or mesothelin [13].
However, a discrete subset of the case-selected yeast-display scFv bound to mesothelin, which suggests that
despite the presence of anti-mesothelin scFv in the casespecific biobody pool, the efficient immunoprecipitation
of mesothelin serum protein was not achieved. Antigen
immunoprecipitation depends on the epitopes recognized by the antibody rather than on its overall antigen
specificity [22]. Thus, this result is not surprising and
implies that biomarker discovery using this approach is
biased by the epitope recognition of the selected scFv.
Generation of large scFv libraries from ovarian cancer
patient lymphocytes could improve the discovery rate
using this method.
We identified several complement factors by both 1D-gel
and shotgun mass spectrometry, but they were shorter
than expected for full length proteins. The complement
(C) system consists of a set of plasma and membranebound proteins including C3 that protects the organism

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6/1/41

against invading microbes and abnormal cells. The regulation of C3 cleavage is critical for C function and is mediated by several molecules, including the membranebound proteins CD35, CD46 and CD55 [23-25] and the
plasma proteins factor H (FH) and FH-like protein 1
(FHL-1) [26,27]. FH expression or binding contributes to
protection against C of some pathogenic microbes (e.g.,
Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrheae,
Borrelia sp) [28-30] and, importantly, of tumor cells [31].
In addition, FH and FHL-1 are abundantly present in
ovarian carcinoma ascites and primary tumors [32], and
ovarian tumor cells have been reported to bind both FH
and FHL-1 and to promote factor I-mediated cleavage of
C3b to inactive iC3b [33]. Thus, the identification of
small fragments of C factors in ovarian cancer patient sera
may be due to a cancer-specific catabolic activity that inactivates C factors and protects tumor cells from the innate
immune response.
By 2-D gel analysis, we identified several spots that
migrated differentially between case and control serum
pools. One of them was identified as PEBP1, also known
as Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and hippocampal
neurostimulating peptide precursor (HCNP). PEBP1 is a
member of the phosphotydalethanolamine (PE)-binding
proteins (PEBPs) that are 21 to 23-kDa basic cytosolic
proteins [34] with preferential in vitro affinity for PE, a
component of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
[35,36]. RKIP/PEBP1 has been shown to disrupt the Raf1-MEK1/2 [mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase-1/2]-ERK1/2 and
NF-κB signalling pathways with physical interaction with
Raf-1-MEK1/2 and NF-κB-inducing kinase of TGFb-activating kinase-1 respectively, thereby abrogating the survival and anti-apoptotic properties of these signalling
pathways. By regulating cell signalling, growth and survival through its expression and activity, RKIP is considered to play a pivotal role in cancer, regulating apoptosis
induced by drugs or immune mediated stimuli [37]. Overexpression of PEBP1-RKIP sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis [37]. PEBPs belong
to an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins represented in all three major phylogenetic divisions [38-42]
with pivotal biological functions [11,42,43]. There are 13
identified mammalian PEBP sequences with highly conserved central region believed to be essential for PEBP
function and binding to G proteins. No obvious secretion
signal is present in the amino acid sequences, but in nematodes PEBPs are found to be part of the secreted cell surface proteins and protect against host immunological
responses [44].
A polyclonal antibody directed against the conserved PEbinding sequence of PEBP1 could accurately (p = 0.02)
discriminate between ovarian cancer and control sera on

antibody arrays. This antibody as well as two other polyclonal antibodies directed against PEBP1 N-terminal
region or the whole PEBP1 protein could also detect large
amounts of protein in 29 out of 30 ovarian cancer patient
ascites. Finally, the polyclonal antibody against the whole
protein could detect larger fragments (38 and 50–52 kDa)
in tissues, ascites cells and tumor cell lines, in addition to
the 21–23 kDa fragment. Although we cannot exclude
that the presence of PEBP1 in ovarian patient fluids could
result from tumor cell death and degradation, altogether
our results suggest that additional variants of PEBP1 exist
in ovarian cancer patient fluids. It is conceivable that
PEBP1 variants could play a role in tumor growth by interfering with PEBP1 inhibitory functions in survival and
anti-apoptotic signalling pathways.

Conclusion
Our results strongly suggest that PEBP1 variants are
present in the sera and ascites of ovarian cancer patients.
To our knowledge, PEBP proteins have never been
described in ovarian cancer sera, although PEBP1 was
recently identified in cell culture supernatants despite its
lack of secretion signal [43,45]. In conclusion, using a
novel type of biotinylated recombinant antibodies that
we call biobodies, we identified complement catabolitic
products, EMILIN2, Von Willebrand factor and PEBP1 or
a related protein, as candidate markers for ovarian carcinoma.
