Confrontational scavenging as a possible source
for language and cooperation
Derek Bickerton1 and Eörs Szathmáry2,3,4*

Abstract
The emergence of language and the high degree of cooperation found among humans seems to require more
than a straightforward enhancement of primate traits. Some triggering episode unique to human ancestors was
likely necessary. Here it is argued that confrontational scavenging was such an episode. Arguments for and against
an established confrontational scavenging niche are discussed, as well as the probable effects of such a niche on
language and co-operation. Finally, several possible directions for future research are suggested.
Introduction
Language and cooperation form perhaps the most distinctive features of the human species. That language is
unique to humans is almost universally acknowledged,
even by those on opposite sides of the nativist/empiricist
debate [1,2]. While closest relatives of humans have
been shown to have a capacity, under intensive training,
for rudimentary forms of language [3], there is no indication that this capacity would ever have developed in
the wild. Cooperation on the scale practised by humans
is found elsewhere only among the hymenoptera,
although there the basis (kin selection) is quite different
from that of human cooperation [4]. It would be
remarkable enough if any species, in the 4-7 my (million-year) time-span suggested for human evolution, had
developed just one of these traits. That each developed
independently in the same species, with its own separate
evolutionary history, seems unlikely.
Could co-operation have led to language, or vice
versa? There are problems with either solution. A “language-first” model faces the difficulty that language presupposes a level of trust unlikely to exist given the
conniving and deceit found among nonhuman primates
[5]. Why would anyone believe verbal utterances, given
that words are such “cheap signals” [6], and how, if noone believed them, could language have taken root?
However, a “cooperation-first” model faces an equal difficulty in that most evolutionary studies of human

cooperation assume the existence of communal norms
and the punishment of infractors [7-9]. It remains
unclear how such norms could have been established
without any kind of language.
The issues are further complicated by the fact that
neither the evolution of language nor the evolution of
co-operations is as yet well understood. There is still no
consensus as to how language originated [10,11], while
even recent work on the origins of co-operation. (typically treated as some mix of inclusive fitness, reciprocal
altruism and group selection with other factors) [12,13]
fails to offer an entirely convincing account of the differences in both degree and kind of cooperation that distinguish humans from apes. Most accounts of both
language and cooperation invoke enhancement of, and
interaction between, factors at least rudimentarily present in other species, even though, as niche construction
theory [14] has recently emphasized, novel and unique
traits from beaver dams to bat echolocation have typically originated through adaptation to some new and
highly specific niche.
This is not to diminish the vital roles played by these
pre-existing factors and the equally important roles they
would play once language and cooperation had begun to
develop. Clearly, such factors form necessary prerequisites for both language and cooperation, but were they
sufficient? If they were, it remains a mystery why language and cooperation are hyper-developed in one species, while in the most closely related species they are
either completely absent (language) or remain minimal
(cooperation). The emergence of unique novel behaviours would appear to necessitate some equally unique

triggering mechanism, such as entering a new niche that
demanded such behaviours if the problems that niche
presented were to be solved. In this paper we evaluate
and strengthen the suggestion [15] that the confrontational scavenging scenario can resolve the issues.

The case for a confrontational scavenging niche
Evidence exists that just such a niche may have been
occupied by human ancestors starting around 2 mya
and lasting perhaps several hundred thousand years.
That niche was confrontational scavenging, sometimes
called “power scavenging” [16]. However, no-one has yet
claimed confrontational scavenging as a fully developed
niche, and some have even denied that it could be one
(see Section 3 below). Accordingly, before discussing
possible consequences for human behaviour of a confrontational scavenging niche, the case for the existence
of such a niche must be established. Although much of
the evidence is of necessity indirect and inferential, it
shows substantial convergence from diverse areas,
including ecological opportunity, technology, sequences
of bone markings, optimal foraging theory, and behavioural and physiological changes affecting Homo
around 2 mya.

yield on average a dead elephant at least every month.
Moreover, elephant ancestors would have been far from
the only megafauna available.
Technology

Both the Oldowan and Acheulean industries provided
flakes as a by-product of hand-axe and hammer-stone
manufacture. It has been experimentally demonstrated
that flake tools will quite easily cut through the hides of
elephants, while Acheulean hand-axes are well adapted
for subsequent butchery [18].
Hand-axes could have had a dual function in confrontational scavenging, since the latter would inevitably
involve hostile interactions with competing scavengers
(including predators larger and fiercer than their modern equivalents). Hand-axes have aerodynamic properties that would have made them useful projectiles [23];
scepticism about their effectiveness [24] relates to hunting rather than scavenging, where deterrence rather
than killing or capture would be the goal. With flakes
and hand-axes at their disposal, hominins had all the
tools they needed to practice effective confrontational
scavenging.
Sequence of bone markings

Ecological opportunity

In the late Pliocene the East African climate became
considerably drier and more variable, giving rise to large
areas of savannah and many new species including herbivorous megafauna [17]. Carcasses of such megafauna
offered immense quantities of meat. However, that meat
could not be accessed immediately, because the toughness of megafauna hides made them impossible for
mammalian teeth to breach until build-up of interior
gases split them [18]. This left a window of at least several hours that could be exploited by any species capable
of penetrating hides. Note that while megafauna carcasses were increasing in number, climate change was
sharply reducing the staple primate diet of fruit and
nuts.
Did such carcasses represent “rare bonanzas”, as some
sources have suggested [19], or were they common
enough to have offered a (relatively) regular food
source? There are no reliable estimates of prehistoric
megafauna populations, so the best we can do is extrapolate from existing populations. Recent studies of elephant populations in two national parks [20,21] agree
on a density of 0.3 per km2, but both sources note that
in earlier decades populations were close to 1.0 per km2.
For sustainable population density in a terrain similar to
that of the climax-savannah period, an even higher density has been suggested [22]. Since elephants live on
average 70 years, an area of 1,000 square kilometres–not
an unreasonable annual range for Homo erectus–should

The sequence of tool- and tooth-marks on bones can be
read to infer priority of access to a carcass. If cut marks
are superimposed on tooth marks (as is mostly the case
before 2 mya) the carcass has been accessed by hominins only after other species have accessed it. If, however, tooth-marks are superimposed on cut-marks,
human ancestors must have been the first to access the
carcass. Priority of access could, of course, have resulted
from either confrontational scavenging or hunting.
However, hunting large animals requires adequate weapons, and there is no indication that contemporary hominins possessed these. A number of sources [19,25-27]
indicate that subsequent to 2 mya this second sequence
of bone markings occurred with increasing frequency.
This could happen only if the hominins involved had
been consistently accessing carcasses before other
scavengers.
Optimal foraging theory

Optimal foraging theory [28] proposes that a species will
choose, out of available foods, those yielding the highest
calorific gain relative to energy expended in obtaining
them. Meat from megafauna carcasses offered the highest calorific yield available for any savannah-dwelling
species (bone-marrow might be richer ounce for ounce,
but quantities were far smaller). Engaging in confrontational scavenging does not preclude bone-marrow
extraction; both might have been practised. However,
since Oldowan technology is adequate for marrow-

Bickerton and Szathmáry BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:261
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/261

extraction but much less suited to confrontational
scavenging than Acheulian technology, one plausible
scenario would be a speciation event in which a handaxe-wielding erectus split off from a bone-cracking habilis. Once located, exploiting a megafauna carcass took
little time and energy relative to the nutritional yield.
While confrontational scavenging was more dangerous
than other foraging methods, risks could be reduced by
numbers of participants and aimed throwing.
Behavioural and physiological changes

The evolution of human scavenging falls into two
phases: catchment scavenging and territory scavenging
[29]. Catchment scavenging involved working within a
restricted area where natural resources were plentiful,
while territory scavenging involved ranging over much
wider areas with relatively little attention paid to
resource richness. The shift in strategies occurred, again,
around 2 mya, and is consistent with a change from
passive scavenging of mainly bones and discarded meat
scraps to confrontational scavenging of entire carcasses,
the location and timing of which were unpredictable. It
is not necessary to claim that hominins became obligate
confrontational scavengers (few if any animals are), only
that confrontational scavenging was added to the arsenal
of hominin behaviours as the currently most favoured
strategy.
Given the 2 mya boundary between catchment and
territory scavenging, we may (very roughly) associate the
former with Homo habilis and the latter with Homo
erectus. The two species show considerable physiological
differences [30,31]: erectus was larger and taller than
habilis, with a more rangy build, legs better adapted for
rapidly covering long differences, and a considerably
greater brain size. Were these changes adaptations for
endurance hunting [32] or scavenging [33]? Since
endurance hunting would have separated one or a very
few individuals from the rest of the group, exposing
them to predation at a time before there were spears or
arrows for self-defence, confrontational scavenging
(which might have involved covering long distances, but
in larger groups) seems a more plausible selective pressure for the suite of behavioral and physiological characteristics found in erectus.

Arguments against confrontational scavenging
Although, as shown above, a wide range of data is consistent with the confrontational scavenging hypothesis, a
number of scholars have suggested that the practice
cannot have played any significant role in human development. For instance, Dusseldorp [34] argues that
“Since scavenging is a competitive niche requiring specialization, it was considered unlikely that hominins ever
relied on this strategy.” However, niche construction

Page 3 of 7

theory has shown that specialization does not precede
exploitation of a niche–rather, new-niche occupation by
initially unspecialized species is precisely what drives
specialization [14].
The fact that scavenging behaviour is rare or non-existent among other primates is often taken as evidence
against scavenging by human ancestors [35]. However,
this argument is based on the assumption that all
human behaviour is grounded in ape behaviour, and
that straight-line evolution from great apes is an indisputable fact. There seems little empirical evidence for
such assumptions. Behaviour is determined at least as
much by environmental and ecological considerations as
by genetic factors; consider for instance the fact that the
hyrax, the elephant and the manatee are more closely
related to one another than they are to other species
[36]. If human ancestors found that scavenging was
necessary for subsistence, it is unlikely that great-ape
genes would have deterred them.
The belief that megafauna carcass finds were rare
events, discussed in Section 2.1 above, seems to rest on
the assumption that our ancestors would have been limited to carcasses that, to their surprise perhaps, they
happened to stumble upon. It is much likelier that
organisms whose brain sizes often fell within the human
range would have taken a proactive approach, perhaps
even tracking and following herds as was done by
humans in the Upper Paleolithic. While the returns of
such a strategy might not always have sufficed for subsistence, temporary reversion to gathering, bone scavenging and opportunistic hunting was always a possibility.
Finally, Geist [35] asks, “If scavenging was important,
how did it lead to the adaptations characteristic of
Homo?“ The remainder of this paper seeks to answer
this precise question, giving substance to the caveat that
ends an earlier sentence by the same author: “Scavenging is not part of a sufficient explanation of human
adaptations–at least not yet“ (emphasis added).

Why confrontational scavenging required atypical
primate behaviours
To access megafauna carcasses in the face of severe
competition required that human ancestors communicate in ways no other primate had done, and cooperate
to a degree unknown among other primates.
There are no reliable estimates for human band size
circa 2 mya. Due to the sparseness of food supplies
under savanna conditions, as well as other factors that
limit band size even in modern foraging populations
[37], it seems likeliest that bands of < 40 individuals
would have followed the common primate behaviour of
fission-fusion foraging, dividing into smaller groups (but
not too small to protect against predation) by day to
cover the maximum area, and meeting in refugia at

night. To simultaneously butcher a carcass and drive off
competitive scavengers required more numbers than
such smaller groups could provide, necessitating the
active co-operation of a large majority in each band.
To recruit adequate numbers, two critical acts had to
be performed. The carcass finders had to communicate
information that lay far outside the sensory range of
potential recruits, and they had to convince those
recruits to abandon whatever they were doing and travel
to a perhaps quite distant site for an invisible goal.
The communication problem

The vast majority of animal communication systems,
including all other primate systems, are unable to give
information about anything that falls outside the potential sensory range of recipients. Exceptions are the systems of eusocial species (ants [38], bees [39]...) that
share a feature otherwise unique to human language,
displacement, making it possible to refer to events
remote in space and/or time. It is noteworthy that ants
and bees also regularly forage food sources (pollen in
the case of bees, larger dead organisms in the case of
ants) that are too large and/or too transient for one or a
few individuals to fully exploit; these are precisely the
circumstances that require recruitment. The location of
such sources, which may lie some distance (in the case
of bees, miles) away, is signalled by stereotyped dances
(bees) or chemical or behavioural [40] means (ants). In
other words, animals are limited only by their phenotypes in the means of signalling they adopt.
Band members who had located a carcass would have
had to use sounds, gestures or mimicry to inform potential recruits of what they had found. The modality, as
the hymenopteran examples suggest, is unimportant–
whatever worked would have been chosen, what mattered was displacement itself. Reference to absent entities is the first step towards symbolism, the capacity that
underlies all of human cognition including language
[41]. While it is true that in ants and bees, displacement
never moved further towards true symbolism, its consequences would have been far more widespread in a species with 4 × 104 more brain cells and a large suite of
prerequisites for language.
The cooperation problem

It is one thing to convey information–quite another to
get other individuals to act on that information.
Primates are not known for their cooperativeness. To
the contrary, they are highly competitive and willing to
deceive one another in pursuit of individual goals [5].
They cooperate only to the extent that this furthers the
latter, and only on the basis of things immediately
apparent to them. This type of behaviour has been
called “competitive cooperation”, as opposed to

Page 4 of 7

“collaborative cooperation” where “the resource is not
manifest, but mainly imagined” [42] (the latter being
typical of human cooperation).
Thus, even assuming that communication was successful (i.e. recipients realized that a megafauna carcass
was available at location X), it does not follow that recipients would automatically co-operate. Those who did
not go for the carcass would suffer a penalty in terms of
less food (unless dependent and needy); for such punishment only memory and individual recognition were
needed. Boyd et al. considered the origin of coordinated
punishment. The authors observe that “A complete
account of the evolution of cooperation must explain
how punishing strategies can increase when rare.” [[43],
p. 620]. Here they wouldn’t have been rare even at the
beginning. Imagine a situation in which three out of
four subgroups of the band co-operate but the fourth
doesn’t. As a direct result, scavengers drive the band
from the carcass, and three-fourths of the band go hungry. It does not stretch the imagination to ponder the
consequences of such defection. The key point in the
scenario is that all members of the group must cooperate simultaneously if a goal advantageous to all is to
be achieved. Individuals who nonetheless wish to avoid
physical danger during the action would be immediately
noted and punished in a coordinated way by the same
group that had already cooperated in the scavenging.
These considerations do not exclude the possibility that
reputation-based punishment may have later contributed
to the extension of cooperation [44,45], but we also note
that the cited models concern pairwise interactions only.
Some of the tools used in scavenging may have been
used as projectiles for coordinated punishment [46] of
defectors after the event, but we feel that such use at
the stage discussed may have been rather casual.
One way to determine the probabilities here would be
to look at temporal profiles of contemporary megafauna
carcass sites. Surprisingly there seems to be little if any
literature on this topic. Available evidence comes mainly
from wild-life photographers, and suggests considerable
variability at such sites. In one account, a hippopotamus
was being consumed by nineteen lions, although how
long the carcass had been available is not known [47].
In another, however, an elephant that “must have died
within the last day or two” was found to be “surprisingly
intact”, and attended only by a few jackals and a number
of vultures [48]; it was only some days later that lions
appeared.
Empirically it is known that in the case of cooperative
hunting not everybody cooperates (there is always a
fraction of laggards), but even more interesting, it seem
that in lions [49] and at least in some hunter-gatherer
groups [50,51] such laggards are not punished. Two
remarks are in order. First, we do not know whether

Bickerton and Szathmáry BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:261
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/261

this finding generalizes to all hunter-gatherers, even less
whether it applied to ancient scavengers. Second, as we
shall see shortly, in similar games there can be stable
coexistence of cooperators and defectors even without
punishment.
Supporting models

Though an adequate model involving all important features (communication, cooperative scavenging, group
competition and punishment) does not exist in the literature, we call attention to the fact that non-linear N-person public good games (reviewed in [52]) offer very
encouraging results already in the right direction. In
these models cooperators pay a cost and contribute to a
public good that, in the simplest case, can be consumed
by all members. Cooperators pay a fixed per capita cost
and benefits are shared. Non-linearity means that fitness
increases non-linearly with the frequency of cooperators.
For the scavenging scenario the “teamwork dilemma”
[53] is the most relevant where it holds that out of a
group of N players at least k must cooperate to produce
the public good, thus k is the threshold value. A general
outcome of these games is that unless the costs are prohibitively high, there is the possibility of locally stable
coexistence even in a well-mixed population with random assortment into potentially cooperating groups [52].
Remarkably, the sharp threshold can be replaced practically with any sigmoid benefit function (increasing and
diminishing returns for low and high numbers of actual
cooperators, respectively). Punishment is not necessary
for the existence of the cooperative equilibrium.
Boza and Számadó have developed these models
further in order to elucidate the effects of multilevel
selection (with or without local population structure)
[54]. It was assumed that during group competition a
group with a higher average payoff replaces a randomly
chosen group with lower average fitness. Interestingly,
they found that group selection does not lead to the
fixation of the cooperative form either, but it brings the
frequency of cooperators closer to the optimum number
for the group (intuitively, if k cooperators are sufficient
for the teamwork, the involvement of more agents is
wasteful). Local spatial structure promotes cooperation
in the model as it maintains a high level of cooperation
even with high costs for both hunting and defence. It is
even possible for cooperators to invade when rare,
despite the positive costs to cooperation.
Consequences for language and cooperation

Of course the processes described above, even if successfully completed, could not, in and of themselves,
have led to anything remotely approaching the levels of
language or cooperation that characterize modern
humans. What they could do, in a species with at least

Page 5 of 7

the cognitive capacities of a great ape, was kick-start
two autocatalytic processes that could then join in a coevolutionary spiral leading eventually to modern
humans.
With regard to the first, communication, all that confrontational scavenging made available was an enhanced
system of communication–a typical animal communication system (ACS) plus displacement. But displacement
would have served as the wedge that broke the walls of
the here-and-now that circumscribe almost all ACSs
(including all ACSs of other neurologically-complex
organisms), potentially allowing free reference to anything in the world, past or future, real or imagined.
While at first this enhanced ACS might have been used
solely for foraging, its utility in other spheres–pedagogy,
planning, manipulation of others, and much more–
would surely have become apparent, allowing its uses to
extend, and its resources to become richer, as fast as the
neurobiological changes necessary for full language
could develop.
With regard to the second, cooperation, successful
execution of confrontational scavenging would have
immediately yielded tangible proof (in terms of a steady
supply of high-quality nutriments) of the benefits of
cooperation. Once it had been established, in one sphere
at least, that cooperative strategies yielded better results
than competitive strategies, such strategies would surely
have spread to other domains. Increases in ways of
cooperating would then have selected for genes that
either favoured cooperation or suppressed overly competitive behaviours.
As Szathmáry and Számadó remark: “The evolution of
language probably occurred in concert with the evolution of many of the other traits we associate with being
human, such as the ability to fashion tools or a strong
propensity to learn. If this is true, it suggests that we
shouldn’t be trying to understand one characteristically
human trait in isolation from the others.” [55]. Consonant with this view, the notion of a ‘human-specific
adaptive suite’ entails a number of synergistic traits,
including eminently language and cooperation, where
selection on one would have accelerated the evolution
of others [56]. The more cooperation, the more language was needed to practice it; the more language, the
more avenues for cooperation opened up. All the factors
previously invoked as directly selective of language and/
or cooperation, from theory of mind to group selection,
would have come into play. But as suggested in Section
1, language and cooperation on a human scale are so far
from primate norms that the mere presence of potential
preadaptations could not alone have precipitated them.
They required a trigger of some kind, one unique to
immediate human ancestors, and so far as is presently
known confrontational scavenging was the only activity

Bickerton and Szathmáry BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:261
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/261

practiced by those ancestors that contained all the
necessary components for such a trigger.
An analysis of the selective scenarios for language [57]
concluded that none of them could account for all the
criteria established for evaluation: honesty, groundedness, power of generalization and uniqueness. It strikes
us that the cooperative scavenging scenario, for the first
time in the literature, meets all these criteria.

Future research
The foregoing should serve as a prima facie case for
regarding confrontational scavenging as a well-defined
niche and possibly crucial in the emergence of human
cooperation and language. However, much needs to be
done in several areas of research before more definite
conclusions can be reached.
Perhaps the most fundamental issue concerns how
species with novel traits originate. The vast majority of
explanations for how language and cooperation arose (a)
fail to make specific reference to any detailed account of
human evolution and (b) adopt multifactorial explanations of a kind seldom if ever invoked when other species are discussed [7-13]. More fine-grained studies of
speciation are needed to determine what kinds of selective pressure cause such events.
A better understanding of the ecology of 2 mya, and
how human ancestors fitted into it, is also required.
Many parts of the jigsaw are to be found in this area.
We need at least a rough estimate of population figures
for a wide variety of species and we need a better
understanding of hominin foraging patterns, including
daily and annual ranges and band size. A vexing problem lies in the fact that territory scavenging entails
deposits of bones that are widely and thinly scattered,
making it difficult to determine the full scope of the
role confrontational scavenging played in overall foraging patterns.
The suggested use of hand-axes as projectiles in the
deterrence of rival scavengers should also be tested to
resolve as far as possible disagreements over the functionality of this procedure. Careful statistical studies of
microwear patterns and spatial distribution of hand-axes
would help us determine their function(s).
Among the most potentially revealing of the studies
suggested by the confrontational-scavenging hypothesis
would be those involving species that faced a similar
ecological problem: the need to practice recruitment in
order to exploit large, unpredictable and transient food
sources, with or without the complication of competition. Surprisingly few species seem to be faced with this
problem; apart from bees and ants, the only case
reported so far involves ravens [58]. Juvenile ravens are
driven away from carcasses (in winter, almost the only
form of nutrition) by mature mated pairs, but

Page 6 of 7

(apparently by exchanging information in nightly roosts)
the former often manage to recruit sufficient numbers
to drive the latter off. Here one finds competition within
rather than between species, but the principles involved
are the same. Whether ravens have indeed mastered displacement, and if so how they accomplish it, is currently
under investigation [59].
There may, of course, be other species that face
similar problems. Such species too would need to be
studied from a comparative perspective. Even the existence of the few we know raises fascinating questions
concerning the extent to which, given details of any
ecological problem, we can predict how a species will
solve it, and whether successful solutions are repeated
regardless of phylogenetic distance between the species
concerned. And even if the confrontational scavenging
hypothesis fails to find support, the research it suggests
should shed much light on both the history of our species and evolutionary processes in general. The aim is,
as with other major transitions in evolution [60], to
put forward a scenario about which we can all agree
that this is how it could have happened, without
necessarily ever being able to say that this was exactly
how it did happen.
Our account is a logical analysis of a promising scenario. The phenomena we consider are dynamically
complex, and in the absence of direct experimentation,
strongly call for a modelling approach. In the next paper
we demonstrate how communication and cooperation
can together triumph in a population model (Szathmáry
and Bickerton, forthcoming).
