Conclusion: These data suggest radiation of genes encoding remodeling and virulence factors
from a small number of loci in a common Plasmodium ancestor, and imply a closer phylogenetic
relationship between the P. vivax and P. falciparum lineages than previously believed. The presence
of a conserved 'exportome' in the genus Plasmodium has important implications for our
understanding of both common mechanisms and species-specific differences in host-parasite
interactions, and may be crucial in developing novel antimalarial drugs to this infectious disease.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most
virulent form of malaria in humans, causing major mortality

Results: We have developed software for the prediction of exported proteins in the genus
Plasmodium, and identified exported proteins conserved between malaria parasites infecting
rodents and the two major causes of human malaria, P. falciparum and P. vivax. This conserved
'exportome' is confined to a few subtelomeric chromosomal regions in P. falciparum and the
synteny of these and surrounding regions is conserved in P. vivax. We have identified a novel gene
family PHIST (for Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric family) that shares a unique domain
with 72 paralogs in P. falciparum and 39 in P. vivax; however, there is only one member in each of
the three species studied from the P. berghei lineage.

Background: The apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of
malaria in humans. After invasion into erythrocytes, asexual parasite stages drastically alter their
host cell and export remodeling and virulence proteins. Previously, we have reported identification
and functional analysis of a short motif necessary for export of proteins out of the parasite and into
the red blood cell.

Abstract

R12.2 Genome Biology 2006,

Volume 7, Issue 2, Article R12

Sargeant et al.

Plasmodium are obligate intracellular parasites, switching
between an arthropod vector and their respective vertebrate
host, where they undergo cycles of asexual reproduction in
erythrocytes. The infected erythrocytes are subject to an
extensive remodeling process induced by the parasite, which
facilitates surface exposition of various ligands for host cell
receptors, nutrient import into the parasite and asexual
reproduction within the host cell. Host cell remodeling
includes the development of electron dense protrusions on
the infected red blood cell surface called knobs. Knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) is a structural knob
component that anchors the major virulence factor Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte surface protein 1 (PfEMP1) on
the knob surface [1]. PfEMP1 is encoded by the epigenetically
regulated var multigene family, and is implicated in cytoadherence of infected red blood cells to various host cells; a
causative factor in the severe pathology of the disease [2-4].
Recently, a second gene family encoding surface antigens has
been described, the repetitive interspersed family (Rif) and it
is believed that Rifins are also subject to antigenic variation
[5].
Once inside the infected erythrocyte the parasite resides in a
parasitophorous vacuole, which acts as a biochemical barrier
between parasite and host through which parasite proteins
must be translocated to reach the parasite-infected erythrocyte cytosol and the host cell membrane. It has recently been
shown that transport of parasite proteins via the parasitophorous vacuole and into the host cell depends on a short aminoterminal sequence, R/KxLxE/Q [6,7], which we have termed
PEXEL (for Plasmodium export element).
This sequence is functionally conserved across the genus
Plasmodium, indicating the presence of a conserved export
mechanism across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in
malaria parasites. The PEXEL sequence has allowed the prediction of proteins exported into the host erythrocyte, which
are likely to be important to both erythrocyte remodeling and
virulence. The availability of genome sequences from many
different species of the genus Plasmodium now provides an
opportunity for the genus-wide discovery of exported proteins and for the identification of specific protein domains
representing conserved functions in these different
organisms.
Here we have developed and applied a method to systematically identify exported proteins in the genus Plasmodium and
to allow characterisation of the 'exportome' in the three most
characterised Plasmodium lineages: P. falciparum/P. reichenowi (the 'P. falciparum lineage') and P. vivax/P. knowlesi
(the 'P. vivax lineage'), encompassing parasites that infect
primates, and P. berghei/P. yoelii/P. chabaudi (the 'P.
berghei lineage') with parasites infecting rodents. We identified a core set of exported proteins conserved across the genus
Plasmodium that are predicted to play key functions in the
host cell remodeling process. Additionally, we describe a set

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R12

of novel gene families encoding exported proteins likely to be
important in the differential properties of the genus Plasmodium in their respective host cells.

Results
ExportPred: algorithmic prediction of the P. falciparum
exportome
Previous strategies [6,7] to determine the complement of
Plasmodium proteins exported to the parasite-infected erythrocyte by predicting the presence of a signal sequence and a
functional PEXEL element have seriously underestimated the
full complement of exported proteins. A significant number of
secreted P. falciparum proteins have a hydrophilic spacer of
up to 50 amino acids preceding the hydrophobic signal
sequence, referred to as a recessed signal sequence. Functional P. falciparum signal sequences, especially those that
are recessed, can be mispredicted by SignalP [8], resulting in
a large deficit in the number of exported proteins [7]. Other
methods to determine the full exportome have limitations
and do not provide a statistic that can be used to gauge the
likelihood of export. To identify the exportome of P. falciparum, and other species of the genus Plasmodium, we constructed an algorithm for export prediction. This algorithm,
named ExportPred, uses a generalised hidden Markov model
(GHMM) [9] to model simultaneously the signal sequence
and PEXEL motif features required for protein export.
Figures 1b and 2a demonstrate that ExportPred is able to distinguish exported proteins from those that are not exported.
To test both the effect of our simplified signal sequence model
and PEXEL motif, we substituted the signal sequence portion
of the ExportPred GHMM with the HMM used in SignalP and
the motif portion with the weight matrix [7]. Combinations of
these substitutions gave rise to three new versions of ExportPred. Table 1 lists the discriminatory power of these various
model configurations and positive and negative sets as measured by area under the respective Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Variants of ExportPred tend to perform
less well than the standard ExportPred model, even after augmenting the SignalP model to allow for recessed signal
sequences. The inclusion of the alternative weight matrix
does not improve discrimination in any of the cases examined
and, in fact, appears to result in a decrease in accuracy in
many cases.

Validation of ExportPred
To provide in vivo support for the ExportPred predictions, we
generated a series of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions
to unknown proteins conserved in Plasmodium that were
ranked highly in the ExportPred output. Proteins were chosen
to test various properties of exported proteins, including
number of exons in the encoding gene, motif composition and
presence of multiple transmembrane domains. As in our initial study [6], we fused the native amino terminus including
the predicted PEXEL plus 11 amino acids downstream of it to

PF14_0607 is predicted to be a multispanning membrane
protein encoded by a 14-exon gene, both features suggesting
it was unlikely that the protein was exported (Figure 3). The
protein has a negative ExportPred score because of a suboptimal signal sequence prediction and an unusual amino acid
(phenylalanine) in position 4 of the motif. The fusion protein
accumulated in the parasitophorous vacuole rather than
being exported, demonstrating that the amino terminus
could not mediate export (Figure 2c). Next, we tested two proteins encoded by single exon genes located in tandem in the
central region of chromosome 5. PFE0355c encodes the putative serine protease PfSubtilisin 3, the least characterised
member of the Plasmodium subtilisin protease family. Both
PfSubtilisin 1 and 2 have been described as merozoite proteins and, at least for PfSubtilisin 1, there is accumulating evidence for localisation of the mature protein in the dense
granules [11]. PFE0355c has an unusually long spacer
between the signal sequence and the predicted PEXEL motif,
which resulted in a negative ExportPred prediction; in agreement with this the fusion protein accumulated in the parasi-

tophorous vacuole (Figure 2c). The single exon gene
PFE0360c encodes a protein of unknown function and had a
positive ExportPred score (3.49 in PFE0360c) for all Plasmodium species where the ortholog was found. However, the
motif has an unusual amino acid, glutamic acid, in position 4
and the fusion protein accumulates in the parasitophorous
vacuole rather than being exported (Figure 2c). PF10_0321 is
also a single exon gene encoding a protein of unknown function. Although the export motif was close to the consensus,
the short hydrophobic amino terminus was not predicted to
be a signal sequence. The fusion protein localised to the mitochondrion (Figure 2c) and, indeed, the amino terminus is
predicted to be a mitochondrial transit peptide (91% predicted with PlasMit [12]). We also tested a number of positively predicted export motifs. PFE0055c is a four-exon gene
encoding a putative type I DnaJ protein (that is, containing all
three DnaJ domains, see below). It had a high PEXEL score
and the fusion protein was exported into the parasite-infected
erythrocyte. PFI1780w has a two-exon structure and encodes
a protein of unknown function, which may have multiple
transmembrane domains. Importantly, it contains one of the
few predicted PEXEL motifs with a lysine rather than an
arginine in position 1 (except for the PfEMP1-type motif,
where it is the rule). The fusion protein was clearly exported
and distributed evenly in the host cell cytoplasm. Finally, we
made a GFP fusion to PFI1755c, one of the most highly
expressed asexual stage proteins [13,14]. It is encoded by a
two-exon gene located adjacent to PFI1780w on chromosome
9; the encoded protein has a high ExportPred score and, as
expected, the GFP chimera was efficiently exported to the

deposited research

GFP, since it has been shown that a spacer between the motif
and a reporter is needed for correct export [10]. Figure 2b
shows the seven GFP chimeras created in this study in the
context of nine known exported proteins and the positive and
negative ExportPred predictions from the P. falciparum proteome. Each protein sequence is represented by a point in
two-dimensional space determined by the contributions to
the ExportPred score of the predicted signal sequence and the
PEXEL.

refereed research

We investigated the potential presence of a 'core set' by performing a reciprocal BLAST search for ortholog clusters of the
Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium sequence sets. Out of
6,396 ortholog clusters, 277 had at least one ortholog with a
predicted PEXEL score of ≥ 4.3. We further reduced this
number by requiring that all members of the cluster had
either a positive ExportPred score or a correctly aligned
PEXEL motif but lacked a positive prediction due to a missing
signal sequence (in case the first exon of the associated gene
model was misannotated), and by ensuring that the motif was
not contained in a functional domain. This resulted in 36
ortholog clusters conserved between at least two studied species in the genus Plasmodium (Table 3). None of these clusters had an ortholog in Cryptosporidium hominis, and we
could also not find any in the other apicomplexan genomes of
Toxoplasma gondii and Theileria parva. The P. falciparum
'core' complement follows the expression pattern of exported
proteins as described previously [6], with a peak in late schizonts, merozoite and ring stages consistent with a role in

deposited research

To cluster the 396 predicted genes into putative families, we
performed an all by all comparison to generate pairs of reciprocal BLAST hits (see Material and methods). This approach
yielded 26 families shown in Table 2: 16 families encode
hypothetical proteins containing novel domains, while others
have been previously described, such as the Rifin [5,15] and
Stevor[16] families, a family of Maurer's clefts localised proteins termed PfMC-2TM (Maurer's clefts two transmembrane
protein family [17]) and a family of putative protein kinases
(denoted FIKK kinases) [18,19]. Two of the novel families
encode DnaJ domains and another two a/b hydrolase
domains. In total, at least 287 of 396 exported proteins are
members of families - approximately 75% of the exportome.

One of the major goals of this study was to determine whether
a subset of exported proteins conserved across the genus
Plasmodium exists. Since PEXEL-mediated protein export
appears to be functionally conserved across Plasmodia [6,7],
it could be expected that the motif involved does not differ
significantly across species. We rationalised, therefore, that
ExportPred could be applicable for prediction of exported
proteins in the genus Plasmodium. To test whether the
PEXEL export mechanism is also conserved across the phylum Apicomplexa, we used ExportPred to make predictions
on the two other completely sequenced and annotated apicomplexan species, Cryptosporidium hominis [20] and
Theileria parva, and also on a preliminary sequence of Toxoplasma gondii. Examination of the small number of positive
predictions (Cryptosporidium, 20; Theileria, 9 (Additional
data file 4); Toxoplasma, 36 (data not shown)) indicated that
in each species only a few proteins were neither conserved
across eukaryotes or were orthologous to a Plasmodium protein lacking an export motif. In addition, none of the predicted sequences from Cryptosporidium, Theileria or
Toxoplasma form paralogous clusters, as could be expected
for proteins exposed to the host immune system. We
concluded, therefore, that PEXEL-mediated export into the
host cell is most likely specific to the genus Plasmodium.

reports

Using as input all P. falciparum annotations and automatic
gene prediction, ExportPred predicted 797 sequences as
being exported, many of which represent overlapping gene
predictions and annotations. To address the issue of misannotation of genes, we selected the highest scoring model in
each overlapping group and some were inspected manually.
After curation, 59 predictions with a PfEMP1-type motif (the
whole PfEMP1 set encoded in 3D7 except var2CSA) and 396
predictions with a generic motif with score ≥ 4.3 remained
(see Additional data file 2 for a detailed list). The structures of
the 396 predicted genes show a strong tendency towards two
exons (Figure 3a) and, in 93% of cases, the first intron occurs
in phase 0 (Figure 3b). Inspecting the GHMM state in which
the first intron occurs indicates that in 90% of cases the first
intron occurs in the spacer between the signal sequence and
the PEXEL motif, or, less commonly, late in the hydrophobic
stretch (>75% of signal sequence in the first exon), confirming that the majority of PEXEL containing genes have a similar structure, with the signal sequence in the first exon
divided from the export motif by an intron in phase 0 (Figure
3c). Many proteins in the exported proteome of P. falciparum
have one or two predicted transmembrane domains (Figure
3d). Only four sequences were predicted to possess more than
three transmembrane regions.

infected-erythrocyte cytoplasm (Figure 2c). As expected, the
presence of a signal sequence in the absence of a predicted
PEXEL resulted in accumulation of the reporter protein in the
parasitophorous vacuole. Taken together, these data show
that ExportPred can accurately predict functional PEXEL
motifs.

erythrocyte remodeling. While all 36 genes share an ortholog
between P. falciparum and P. vivax, only 10 are also present
in the genome of malaria parasites of the P. berghei lineage.
Twenty-two belong to novel gene families identified in the
course of this study: sixteen genes belong to the PHISTc subfamily, four belong to HYP11 and two to HYP16. In addition,
one conserved gene, PFE0055c, encodes a DnaJ protein, and
PFB0915w encodes a previously described liver stage anti-

gen, LSA-3 [21]. The genes are clustered in the subtelomeric
regions of P. falciparum chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11,
respectively (Figure 4a). An alignment of the subtelomeric
regions on chromosome 2 with P. vivax contigs demonstrates
that synteny breaks down around PFB0100c (Figure 4b),
which encodes KAHRP. KAHRP is the major structural knob
component and chromosome breaks in the KAHRP locus
occur frequently in P. falciparum and result in reduced

Plasmodium 'exportome' statistics
Plasmodium 'exportome' statistics. (a) Distribution of exon counts in genes with PEXEL export signatures compared with all P. falciparum genes,
demonstrating a clear trend towards two exon genes in the P. falciparum exportome. (b) First intron phase for PEXEL exported genes compared with all
P. falciparum genes, showing an extremely strong trend towards a phase 0 first intron amongst genes with export signatures. (c) Counts of classic (intron
between signal sequence and PEXEL) and non-classic genes in the P. falciparum exportome, stratified by exon count. (d) Distributions of the number of
predicted transmembrane domains for exported P. falciparum proteins, Rifins and Stevors, and the P. falciparum proteome as a whole. Rifins and Stevors
are, in general, predicted to have two transmembrane domains, and members of the remaining complement of the P. falciparum exportome are slightly less
likely to be soluble than P. falciparum proteins in general, and are also less likely to be multi-membrane spanning. (e) Comparison of the P. falciparum
exportome with hybrid exportomes of the P. vivax and P. berghei lineages. Numbers of PEXEL exported uniques and families are shown, as well as any
previously described families and uniques not apparently exported by PEXEL mediated mechanisms. Web logos constructed from instances of the motif in
the three exportomes are also shown. References to gene families from species other than P. falciparum are indicated in brackets.

Approximately 75% of all 396 P. falciparum proteins predicted to be exported are organised in families. Counts in columns 5 to 10 represent the
number of family members deemed to be expressed by this method for each life cycle stage (except PfEMP1). Abbreviations for life cycle stages in
the microarray section are: R, ring; T, trophozoite; S, schizont; M, merozoite; Sp, sporozoite; G, gametocyte. GPI, glycosylphosphatidyl inositol;

cytoadherence [22-24]. On the other subtelomeric end of
chromosome 2, synteny between P. falciparum and P. vivax
and P. yoelii breaks down just upstream of a gene encoding an
exported DnaJ protein (PFB0920w). We also investigated P.
falciparum chromosome 10, since it contains 7 conserved
genes encoding putatively exported proteins. Interestingly,
the conserved subtelomeric cluster (except the most telomeric PHISTc gene PF10_0021) is syntenic with a large P.
vivax contig that otherwise maps to the subtelomeric region
of P. falciparum chromosome 3. This apparent chromosomal
rearrangement event inserted approximately 50 genes
between PF10_0021 and PF10_0163 (another PHISTc) and,
therefore, moved this part of the conserved cluster towards
the centromere in P. falciparum.

In addition to orthologous clustering, we examined exported
proteins in other Plasmodium species where gene predictions
were available. The close evolutionary relationship between
the three studied species of the P. berghei lineage (P. yoelli,P.
berghei and P. chabaudi) and between the two species of the
P. vivax lineage (P. vivax and P. knowlesi) motivated our
decision to combine predictions from individual species into
'hybrid' exportomes [25]. The predicted hybrid exportomes
are considerably smaller than the P. falciparum complement
(Figure 3e and Additional data file 3). Most significantly, both
hybrid exportomes appear to contain only one large (>ten
paralogs) lineage-specific family of exported proteins, an as
yet unidentified one in the P. vivax/P. knowlesi cluster and
the pyst-b family in the P. berghei lineage [26]. Intriguingly,

Chromosomal location of exported P. falciparum proteins and synteny with P. vivax and P. yoelii contigs
Chromosomal location of exported P. falciparum proteins and synteny with P. vivax and P. yoelii contigs. (a) Map of 14 P. falciparum chromosomes showing
the location of exported genes conserved in Plasmodium, or only in the P. vivax and P. falciparum lineages. Location of var genes is shown for reference
purposes, and PHIST genes are coloured. Shaded loci correspond to regions of synteny depicted in (b): 5 syntenic loci on P. falciparum chromosomes 2, 3
and 10 containing conserved exported genes. P. falciparum chromosomes are shown in green, P. vivax contigs in blue, and P. yoelii contigs in red. Gene
positions are represented by arrows; yellow arrows on P. falciparum chromosomes represent exported genes. Locations of P. vivax genes are inferred by
reciprocal best hits homology, or where less stringent homology is augmented by parsimonious strand information and neighbourhood synteny. P. yoelli
genes and orthology are as extracted from PlasmoDB [34]. Locus 1 on chromosome 2 shows that synteny begins with incomplete homology between
KAHRP. Loci 1, 2 and 5 show conservation of PHISTc family members, but not of PHISTb. Loci 4 and 5 suggest an explanation for clusters of exported
genes in central locations on P. falciparum chromosomes. In both cases exported genes exist at the ends of extremely long contigs, suggesting that they are
subtelomerically located whereas the syntenic P. falciparum genes in locus 5 are centrally located. Locus 5 also demonstrates the breakdown in synteny at
the location of PHISTc genes in P. yoelli.

parum lineage. This is reflected in the large number of P. falciparum gene families that encode exported proteins. While
some gene families appear to be unique to this species (and
the closely related P. reichenowi), others are present in the
other two lineages either as single copy genes, or, in a few
cases (for example PHIST, HYP11, HYP16) as an already radiated gene family.

The FIKK kinases: a novel family of exported P.
falciparum proteins
Recently, the identification of a novel class of putative protein
kinases has been reported, termed FIKK kinases, in the phylum Apicomplexa [18,19]. The FIKK kinases are expanded in
the P. falciparum lineage with at least 6 paralogs in (the
incompletely sequenced genome of) P. reichenowi and 20 in
P. falciparum (strain 3D7). Although enzymatic activity has
not been demonstrated, the presence of most of the conserved
residues of the catalytic domain suggests they are functional
protein kinases [19]. The 20 P. falciparum paralogs all contain a PEXEL motif following an amino-terminal signal
sequence (encoded in a short first exon) [18]. In contrast, the
single orthologs from species of the P. berghei and P. vivax
lineages lack the first exon encoding the signal sequence, as

well as the PEXEL motif. Surprisingly, we found an additional
FIKK paralog lacking the first exon and a PEXEL motif in the
genome of another P. falciparum strain, a Ghanian isolate
that is being sequenced at the Sanger centre (currently eightfold coverage) [28]. This suggests that radiation of the FIKK
family was the result of PEXEL conversion of a sequence arising from an ancient gene duplication event in the P. falciparum lineage, with subsequent loss of the ancestral version
occurring recently in the 3D7 strain.

A novel family of exported proteins shared between
two malaria lineages
As depicted in Table 3, 16 out of 36 genes shared between the
two Plasmodium lineages that infect primates belong to a
novel gene family we have named PHIST. Initial alignments
indicate the presence of a conserved domain of approximately
150 amino acids in length. We used a collection of HMMs constructed from subgroupings of domain sequences to the different Plasmodium species and identified 71 paralogs in P.
falciparum, 39 in P. vivax, 27 in P. knowlesi, 3 in P. gallinaceum and 1 each in P. yoelli, P. berghei and P. chabaudi
(Figure 5). The domain itself is predicted to consist of four
consecutive alpha helices and does not appear similar to any

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R12

known protein sequence (based upon searches of the NR protein database with PHIST HMMs) or structure (as
determined by structural modelling based upon the structures of the top five weak similarities detected by the structure threading algorithm Fugue [29]). Interestingly, PHIST
domains cluster into three distinct subgroups (termed
PHISTa, PHISTb and PHISTc), which are distinguished by
the presence and position of several conserved tryptophans.
In addition, the three subtypes show different overall structures: PHISTa proteins are very short and consist only of a
signal sequence, an export motif and the PHIST domain;
PHISTb proteins show more length variability in the carboxyterminal portion following the PHIST domain, and a subset of

seven PHISTb proteins, including the well-characterised vaccine candidate RESA (Ring-infected surface antigen [30,31]),
contains an additional DnaJ domain; PHISTc proteins are the
most diverse group and the only one that radiated before the
separation of the P. falciparum and P. vivax lineages (Figure
5). The genes encoding the three subfamilies are located in
subtelomeric regions of all chromosomes, except chromosome 3. Microarray data from P. falciparum strain 3D7 indicate the typical expression pattern of exported proteins for
PHISTb and PHISTc; a peak during schizogony and after
invasion in the ring stage parasites. In contrast, PHISTa
genes are generally not detectably transcribed: only two genes
show significant transcription levels.

instances of the PHIST domain; branch lengths assigned with least squares error minimisation; branches with <50% bootstrap support in red, 50% to 75%

subfamily HMMs) and species conservation. Domain diagrams indicate organisational differences between subfamilies. The PHIST domain is carboxyterminal in the PHISTc subfamily, regardless of length. In the PHISTa and b subfamilies a domain position of 100 to 200 amino acids from the aminoterminal methionine appears to be a general rule. In all the DnaJ containing members of the PHISTb subfamily, the DnaJ domain is carboxy-terminal to the
PHIST domain. Members of the PHISTa subfamiliy are the shortest members of the PHIST family and are, as a whole, the most divergent and appear in a
number of instances to be truncated. Note that PHIST domain representation is based on the annotated PlasmoDB [34] sequence, which in some cases
lacks the first exon (for example, PFB0905c).

neighbour joining on full sequences; type III, TREE-PUZZLE on full sequences; branches with <50% bootstrap support in red, 50% to 75% in blue, >75% in
black) show export (blue boxes) and core motif variations. Sequences not belonging to P. falciparum are marked with symbols to indicate the species group
from which they arise. PF14_0359 has orthologs in other Plasmodia (not shown). Positions of signal sequence and PEXEL as determined by ExportPred,
and PHIST and DnaJ domains as determined by HMM search, are overlaid on gene models. Although the large number of family members tends to
decrease bootstrap support for individual branches, congruence with the three PHIST subfamilies as defined by HMM profiles lends additional support to
the overall topology of the tree.

Expansion of exported J-proteins in P. falciparum
Apart from RESA, several other P. falciparum sequences with
homology to the RESA J-domain were identified in an early
genomic survey [32]. In eukaryotic cells, proteins carrying a
J-domain act as co-chaperones, regulating the activity of 70
kDa heat-shock proteins (HSP70s). Three classes of J-proteins (also called HSP40s) are distinguished by the presence
and nature of the three domains originally identified in the
bacterial protein DnaJ. Type I members contain all three
domains: the J-domain (including a highly conserved HPD
motif essential for interaction of the protein with HSP70), a
glycine-rich domain and a carboxy-terminal zinc-finger

domain. Type II members lack the zinc-finger domain. Type
III members contain the J-domain only. While type I and type
II proteins act as true chaperones, interacting with substrate
proteins as well as regulating Hsp70 activity, the function of
type III members is less clear [33]. Since our ExportPred output (score ≥ 4.3) contained several proteins annotated on
PlasmoDB [34] as putative heat shock proteins (due to the
presence of a J-domain), we used the PFAM DnaJ domain for
an HMM search in PlasmoDB [34]. The HMM analysis identified 43 P. falciparum proteins with an amino-terminal
DnaJ domain, of which 19 are predicted to be exported. In
comparison, the apicomplexan parasite C. hominis genome

HMMs [9,35], used here to develop ExportPred for the prediction of the Plasmodium exportome, have been successfully
applied to a number of problems in sequence analysis, including signal sequence prediction (SignalP [8], Phobius [36]),

refereed research

ExportPred: prediction of Plasmodium exportomes

The vast majority of the predicted exportome (Figure 3a) is
encoded by genes that are located in the subtelomeric regions
of most P. falciparum chromosomes, and that tend to have a
two-exon structure with the signal sequence in the first exon
and the PEXEL motif at the beginning of the second exon. In
addition, a large proportion of exported proteins encoded by
genes with more than two exons show the same configuration
for the first and second exons and of the 36 exported proteins
conserved across Plasmodia, 33 are encoded by 2 exon genes
(Table 3). Two competing models may explain this surprising
finding. The two-exon structure may represent the ancestral
status of genes encoding exported proteins, and consequently
the present situation is the result of a large radiation from a
single ancestral gene. Alternatively, this specific gene structure could be the consequence of a recombination mechanism, which inserts either the first exon only or, more likely,
the whole 'pre-sequence' encoding the signal sequence and
the PEXEL motif into existing genes. Pre-sequence acquisition has been described for chloroplast and mitochondriaderived genes transferred to and encoded in the nucleus, and

transmembrane domain prediction (TMHMM [37]) and secondary structure prediction. In the majority of these cases,
the presence of a significant volume of biochemically verified
data is offset by the weakness of the signal they aim to detect.
Although the situation for Plasmodium export prediction is
somewhat reversed - paucity of verified data is made up for by
the strength of the signal - the PEXEL motif provides an
opportunity for accurate algorithmic prediction. GHMMs
extend HMMs by augmenting states with explicit length distributions, allowing the use of a smaller number of states to
capture a more general set of features at the expense of an
increase in computational complexity and the lack of a procedure for automated training. Features such as the periodicity
observed in the signal sequence length are well captured by a
single state in a GHMM, whereas to represent the observed
set of lengths in a HMM would require a complex group of
states with a predetermined topology. The choice of a GHMM
based architecture for PEXEL prediction improves upon rulebased methods by utilising a probabilistic framework, which
captures all the observed sequence features of PEXEL containing proteins simultaneously, while not excessively
increasing complexity. Some differences are observed
between previous exportome predictions and those of ExportPred. In one study the exportome had been hand curated and,
therefore, a large proportion of the predictions unique to it
can be ascribed to cases in which an incorrect gene model was
reannotated, generally to correct a missing or incorrect first
exon [6]. Given the similar performance of the motif published in another study to the ExportPred framework [7]
(Table 1) coupled with the discrepancy in predictions, we surmise that their exportome is unnecessarily conservative, and
stems to some degree from the reliance on positive SignalP
prediction, which does not allow for recessed signal peptides,
a common feature of exported proteins.

Identification of a conserved signal mediating protein export
from P. falciparum into the host red blood cell has facilitated
the systematic identification of the 'exportomes' of malaria
parasites. One goal of this study was the development of a
program to characterise the exportomes of the three malaria
parasites infecting rodents, P. yoelii, P. berghei and P.
chabaudi, and the two malaria parasites infecting primates,
P. vivax and P. knowlesi; this has been used to determine the
'core' exportome of the genus Plasmodium. Interestingly, we
have identified novel gene families that have radiated to differing extents in these parasites. It is likely that the conserved
core exported proteins are important in the remodeling of the
host erythrocyte for the different malaria species, while the
genes that are specific for the much larger exportome of P.
falciparum probably encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the different properties of this parasite.

encodes 24 proteins with DnaJ domains, which is similar to
the complement in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22
plus 3 J-like proteins [33]). A phylogenetic analysis of all Jproteins from S. cerevisiae, C. hominis and different Plasmodium species indicated two clusters with a lineage-specific
expansion of DnaJ proteins (Figure 6a). One cluster represents the radiation of type I or type II (no clear prediction of
the central G domain) DnaJ proteins before the divergence of
the P. berghei lineage from the P. falciparum and P. vivax lineages (Figure 6b). One P. yoelii, two P. vivax and three P. falciparum genes share the same four-exon structure with a
signal sequence encoded in exon 1 and a predicted PEXEL
motif encoded in exon 2. In addition, the amino-terminal J
domain contains the conserved HPD motif, which is an essential feature of known J-domains in enabling the regulation of
Hsp70 activity [33]. A second cluster, including RESA, represents expansion of type III DnaJ proteins in P. falciparum
only (Figure 6c). These 15 genes encode highly divergent proteins with various amino acid differences in the crucial HPD
motif. S. cerevisiae has three type III DnaJ proteins with similar mutations in the HPD domain (for example, H to Y in
position 1, D to E in position 3), which were consequently
classified as J-like proteins [33]. Since the function of the
three yeast proteins is unknown, it remains to be determined
whether the exported P. falciparum proteins with mutations
in the HPD domain are capable of stimulating ATP hydrolysis
of HSP70 and, therefore, whether they are functional DnaJ
proteins. As mentioned earlier, seven proteins of the PHIST
protein family are also part of these unusual DnaJ proteins
due to the presence of a carboxy-terminal J-domain (Figures
5 and 6b).

exons to target the corresponding proteins back to their
respective organelle [38-40]. Considering the case of the
exported FIKK kinases and DnaJ proteins, which are both
encoded by genes with this typical structure and which have
apparently evolved via an initial gene duplication of a oneexon gene, pre-sequence acquisition by exon-shuffling is the
most parsimonious mechanism. A similar model, termed
semi-exon shuffling, has recently been proposed for the
acquisition of plastid-targeting transit peptides in diatoms
[40]. Interestingly, a recent study found an excess of phase 1
introns around signal sequence cleavage sites in human genes
[41], while the introns in genes encoding exported P. falciparum proteins are predominantly in phase 0.

KAHRP ancestor into an exported protein associated with the
knob structure, or gene loss after an initial gene duplication
event. It is interesting to note that knob formation and
cytoadherence have been demonstrated in P. fragile but not
in P. vivax or P. knowlesi [45]. In P. falciparum, it has
recently been shown that absence of knobs due to deletion on
chromosome 2 results in reduced surface expression of
PfEMP1 and, therefore, reduced cytoadherence [46]. However, it remains to be shown which of the four genes apart
from rif and var genes (KAHRP itself, PfEMP3, the two DnaJ
typeI/II gene products PFB0085c and PFB0090c, or the
PHISTc paralog PFB0080c) on the deleted chromosome end
are responsible for this effect.

The 'core' exportome: novel families and conserved
loci

Radiation of DnaJ proteins in Plasmodium appears to have
occurred twice independently. Our presumption is that initial
gene duplication in a common ancestor of all three parasite
lineages generated one DnaJ type I/II protein exported into
the host erythrocyte. Duplications occurring after the divergence of the P. berghei lineage gave rise to a second copy in
the P. falciparum and P. vivax lineages and a third copy in P.
falciparum - though whether one of these duplications
occurred before P. falciparum speciation is not clear.
Although orthology is not able to be determined based upon
protein sequence, indications from synteny observations suggest PFE0055c to be the ancestral exported type I DnaJ protein. Expansion of exported DnaJ type III proteins (including
those with an additional PHIST domain), on the other hand,
has occurred in P. falciparum only. Although the strict conservation of the crucial HPD motif in all type I/II and four
type III proteins predicts them to be functional co-chaperones of HSP70, no such P. falciparum protein has a putative
export motif. The P. falciparum genome encodes six proteins
with HSP70 domains: two appear to be cytoplasmic proteins
(PF08_0054, chr7_000093.glm_5), one contains a predicted mitochondrial transit peptide (PF11_0351), two contain carboxy-terminal ER retrieval sequences (including
PfBIP [47]; PFI0875w, MAL13P1.540), and one is the P.
falciparum ortholog (PF07_0033) to the cytoplasmic
HSP105. A recent report demonstrated the recruitment and
ATP-dependent function of host-derived HSP70 on the surface of infected red blood cells [48]. Moreover, the chaperone
co-migrated in a large complex with KAHRP, suggesting
localisation to the knobs. It is possible, therefore, that
exported DnaJ proteins function as co-chaperones and with
host HSP70 are involved in refolding highly complex molecules such as the virulence factor PfEMP1. Interestingly, a
subgroup of DnaJ type III proteins also contains a PHISTb
domain. The proteins in this subgroup, which includes RESA,
contain a slightly relaxed PEXEL motif, RxLxxE (which is not
currently modelled by ExportPred) and an unusually recessed
hydrophobic signal sequence, which SignalP does not predict
to be proteolytically cleaved. The expression of RESA (and all
the other paralogs (see Additional data file 2)) peaks during
late schizogony, and it has been demonstrated that RESA is
resident in the dense granules before accumulating in the par-

The ExportPred output from a whole genome analysis of C.
hominis, and the lack of conserved exported proteins encoded
in other apicomplexan genomes such as T. gondii and T.
parva (T Sargeant, unpublished observation), indicate that
the evolution of the PEXEL motif, in its described form, is
specific to the Plasmodium genus. Recently, a connection has
been drawn between the Plasmodium PEXEL motif and a
short amino-terminal sequence (RxLR) observed in three
effector proteins of the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora [42]. Thus far, no experimental evidence supporting its
function in Phytophthora exists and the lack of any similar
motif in organisms much more closely related to the genus
Plasmodium makes it unlikely that the Phytophthora motif is
evolutionarily related to the PEXEL motif.
Although the export motif is conserved in the majority of
orthologous groups, there are a few exceptions where the
PEXEL has apparently been acquired in a lineage-specific
manner. The radiation of FIKK kinases and two subfamilies
of putative a/b hydrolases (our unpublished observation) in
the P. falciparum lineage suggest an initial gene duplication
event of a conserved, non-secreted protein specifically in this
lineage. Interestingly, we have identified predicted proteins
in P. vivax and P. knowlesi with high homology to the central
region of KAHRP. The KAHRP amino terminus consists of a
signal sequence and a PEXEL motif for entry into the secretory pathway and subsequent export into the host cell (Figure
7a). A histidine-rich region (His-domain) downstream of the
PEXEL motif and two charged repeat regions in the carboxyl
terminus of the protein are implicated in Maurer's clefts binding and association of KAHRP with PfEMP1, respectively
[1,43]. In contrast, the putative P. vivax and P. knowlesi
KAHRP orthologs contain neither a discernible PEXEL motif
or His-domain, and the repeat region is much shorter and of
different amino acid composition. However, a KAHRP
ortholog from P. fragile with 97% identity to PfKAHRP across
the whole length has recently been deposited to GenBank
(accession number CAB96390) [44]. The lack of a nonexported KAHRP ancestor in P. reichenowi and P. falciparum suggests a lineage-specific conversion of a common

asitophorous vacuole and being translocated into the host cell
after invasion. In light of this, it is possible that RESA, and the
other paralogs, are translocated into the ER as a signalanchored protein and subsequently trafficked to dense granules. Cleavage of the anchor presumably then occurs in the
dense granules or after entry into the parasitophorus vacuole,
allowing recognition of the PEXEL by the parasitophorus vacuole membrane translocation machinery [49].
The PHIST protein family, identified for the first time in this
work, is organised into three subfamilies, of which PHISTc is
entirely shared between the P. falciparum and P. vivax lineages and, in single copy form, in the three species of the P.
berghei lineage. The PHISTb subfamily appears to contain
only two members in P. vivax and P. knowlesi, but has radiated extensively in P. falciparum. The PHISTb subfamily
contains a P. falciparum specific subgroup including RESA
that is distinguished by the additional presence of a DnaJ
domain. In contrast to PHISTb and PHISTc, PHISTa is
entirely P. falciparum specific. It is difficult to assign possible
functions to PHIST proteins as none of the members of this
family have previously been described (apart from the unusual RESA antigen), and the helical structure of the prototypical PHIST domain appears dissimilar to any known
structure. It is clear, however, that PHISTc performs a function common to the genus Plasmodium, but which is
expanded in the P. falciparum and P. vivax lineages, while
the function of PHISTa is specific to P. falciparum. A recent
yeast-two hybrid based analysis of a global protein interaction network in P. falciparum indicates a PHISTb and
PHISTc paralog (PFD1140w and MAL7P1.7, respectively)
plus two PHISTb paralogs with a DNAJ domain (RESA and
PF11_0509) being part of a interaction network with skeleton-binding protein [50] in the centre [51]. While most
PHISTb and PHISTc genes show transcriptional peaks
mainly in early asexual stages, three recently published
microarray studies [52-54] indicate that a number of genes
from these two subfamilies (plus most paralogs of the PfMC2TM family, and an infected red blood cell membrane protein
PIESP2 [55]) are specifically upregulated in early gametocyte
stages (see Additional data file 2). Interestingly, the same
PHISTb and PHISTc genes also appear upregulated in parasites directly extracted from infected patients compared to
the culture-adapted 3D7 [56]. Genes of the PHISTa subgroup
on the other hand appear transcriptionally silent in 3D7 (with
the exception of the unusal PFD0090c and one other member, PFL2565w), and it is therefore possible that PHISTa
genes are subject to mutually exclusive expression (as is the
case for the var genes). Proteomic data show a consistent
presence of PHIST proteins in parasite-infected erythrocyte

membrane fractions [55,57,58], and the PHISTc paralog
PFI1780w has been detected in detergent-resistant membrane fractions [59]. PHIST HMMs do not detect sequence
homology with any non-Plasmodium protein in the NR database, and a sequence-structure homology search, followed by
structure modelling using the best hits, also produced no
acceptable results. As such, it is possible that this domain represents a novel protein fold specific to Plasmodium, although
it should be noted that the weak homology between members
of the PHIST family in P. falciparum alone suggests that any
structural similarity is likely to be hard to detect on the basis
of primary sequence. Finally, the topology of the PHIST tree
is a strong indication for a closer phylogenetic relationship
between the P. falciparum and the P. vivax lineage than
either of those and the P. berghei lineage.
Apart from the conserved families, only a few genes encoding
hypothetical exported proteins are conserved in P. falciparum and one or both of the two other studied lineages.
Importantly, both single copy genes and paralogs from the
three conserved families PHIST, HYP11 and HYP16 are predominantly clustered in the subtelomeric regions of P. falciparum chromosomes 2, 9 and 10. Completion of the whole
genome sequencing and chromosomal mapping of P.
falciparum [60] and P. yoelii [61] confirmed previous chromosomal mapping studies that indicated a high degree of synteny among different Plasmodium species. Apart from the
subtelomeric regions, gene synteny and order appear to be
conserved over large stretches between species within the P.
berghei lineage, and to a lesser extent between P. falciparum
and P. vivax [62,63]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that genes encoding variant surface antigens and
exported proteins are located subtelomerically, and that these
regions exhibit the highest genomic plasticity [6,64]. A comparison of chromosome 2 has shown that single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) between different P. falciparum isolates are clustered in the subtelomeric regions [65]. In this
study, we have analysed the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 2 and 10, which contain many of the conserved genes
encoding exported proteins. Synteny between large P. vivax
contigs and P. falciparum chromosome 2 breaks down where
a large increase in SNPs between isolates has been reported
[65]. In addition, one subtelomeric region of chromosome 10
appears to be the result of a lineage-specific chromosomal
rearrangement with a subtelomeric portion of chromosome 3
(Figure 4b).

gests that they are important in remodeling of the parasiteinfected erythrocyte. In contrast, the large set of proteins that
appear to be unique to specific Plasmodia are likely to provide
distinct functions for survival in host specific erythrocytes. It
is interesting that P. falciparum appears to have a greatly
expanded exportome compared to other Plasmodia and the
most likely reason for this striking observation is the presence
of PfEMP1 in P. falciparum that is trafficked to the surface of
the infected erythrocyte. PfEMP1 is a complex multidomain
protein and the presence of a family of putative co-chaperones containing DnaJ domains may be involved in the translocation process and correct conformation of this functionally
important virulence protein. The identification of a conserved
set of exported proteins in Plasmodium strongly supports the
idea that these are functionally critical and are potential drug
targets for the development of a novel class of drugs against
this important infectious disease.

Synteny of conserved clusters between P. vivax and P. falciparum (and to a certain extent P. yoelii) demonstrates the
presence of an ancestral set of exported proteins located on a
few conserved loci present in a common ancestor. The fact
that most exported proteins in the different exportomes share
a common secondary structure with the few conserved ones

domains, multiple alpha helices) strongly suggests that these
ancestral core proteins were the template for subsequent lineage- and species-specific radiations. Conservation of the

Conclusion

Sargeant et al. R12.17

reports

The clustering of exported P. falciparum proteins into paralogous groups revealed a large number of novel families, some
of which are even conserved between different Plasmodium
lineages (for example, Hyp11, Hyp16, PHIST). Strikingly, the
majority of these proteins, including Rifin, Stevor, PfMC2TM and PHIST, are between 250 and 300 amino acids in
length and include mainly helical stretches (Figure 7b). Altogether, approximately 75% of all exported proteins (excluding
PfEMP1) conform to this structure. Moreover, four novel protein families (Hyp7/8/13/15) as well as Rifin, Stevor and
PfMC-2TM contain two transmembrane domains, which are
separated by three (PfMC-2TM) to 170 amino acids (Rifin).
Based on the presence of the two closely positioned transmembrane domains, a P. falciparum-specific superfamily
encoded by subtelomeric multicopy gene families has been
postulated [17]. In addition, another study suggested a common ancestry for the large antigenic families present in the
three species of the P. berghei lineage (yir/bir/cir), P. vivax
(vir) and P. falciparum (Rifin) based on their structural similarities [66]. In this context, it is interesting to note that
unlike yir/bir/cir and vir proteins, which all lack an export
motif, the virD subfamily paralogs show the same overall
structure as Rifin, including the amino-terminal signal
sequence and export motif (also predicted by ExportPred
with a score ≥ 4.3). However, it remains to be shown whether
virD is indeed the link between Rifin and the rest of this
superfamily, that is, whether this postulated relationship is
genuine. The presence of two (carboxy-terminal) transmembrane domains raises questions about the orientation and
function of these proteins in their respective target membrane. It has been proposed that the highly variable portion
flanked by these two hydrophobic stretches forms a loop,
which is exposed to the cytosol (in the case of Maurer's clefts
resident proteins) or the host environment (in the case of
Rifin and probably Stevor) [17]. In general, the similarity in
structure of these protein families suggests that they have
either been derived from the same ancestral gene or, alternatively, that these similarities are the result of convergent
evolution reflecting the structural constraints of proteins
exported to the host cell.

this conservative subset; examination of the output of this
retrained version revealed only negligible differences from
the version trained on the full set of sequences.

Simulated negative sets
Simulated negative sets were constructed using a second
order Markov model trained on P. falciparum protein
sequences. Acknowledging the possibility of contamination,
complete single exon genes with a non-subtelomeric chromosomal location (>500 kilobases from a telomere) were used as
a non-simulated negative set (PfNegative; 1,292 sequences).
Simulated test sets containing signal sequences but no
PEXEL were also created by four methods: using the second
order Markov model (NoSS; 1,000 sequences); using the SignalP model to simulate signal sequences, concatenated with a
tail simulated using the second order Markov model (SpSS;
1,000 sequences); using amino termini from real proteins
with a predicted signal sequence, one exon, and a non-subtelomeric chromosomal location followed by a simulated tail
(PfSS; 165 sequences); and using the ExportPred signal
sequence model to simulate signal sequences, followed by a
tail simulated using the second order Markov model (EpSS;
1,000 sequences).

ExportPred
ExportPred utilises a GHMM to score protein sequences
according to their likelihood of export. The architecture of the
ExportPred GHMM (Figure 1a) consists of three paths. Two
paths model, respectively, RLE (RxLxE/Q) PEXELs (of which
Rifins and Stevors are members) and KLD (KxLxD) PEXELs
(of which PfEMP1 is the only described example) and the
third provides a background model. A simple model for signal
peptides was selected, capturing only the observed leader and
hydrophobic signal sequence length distributions and amino
acid composition. RLE type PEXELs were thus modelled by
five states corresponding to the leader, the hydrophobic
stretch of the signal sequence, spacer, the RxLxE/Q motif and
the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein. KLD type PEXELs consist of a shorter leader sequence, followed immediately by an instance of a KxLxD motif, which is more highly
conserved than the RxLxE/Q motif. It is hypothesised that
the transmembrane domain immediately amino-terminal of
the acidic terminal sequence (ATS) acts in ER targeting, and
has, therefore, also been included in the model. The null
model consists of a single state modelling the average length
and amino acid composition of the P. falciparum proteome.
All three paths are tied together by a state representing the
amino-terminal methionine, and transition probabilities
were chosen to reflect our prior belief concerning the relative
abundances of proteins in the three captured classes. An RLE
(or KLD) score is derived by taking the log ratio of the joint
probability of the sequence and the final state being RLE-tail
over the joint probability of the sequence and the final state
being NULL-tail.

FINAL = S NULL −tail ) 

Due to the lack of well annotated and validated training data,
as well as the lack of parameter estimation procedures for
GHMMs, all model parameters for ExportPred were derived
empirically. Amino acid distributions for the five positions of
the RxLxE/Q and KxLxD motifs, as well as for the amino acid
positions immediately preceding and following, were derived
from the multiple alignment presented in [6]. Hydrophobic
regions were modelled initially by an amino acid composition
extracted from the hydrophobic stretches of the training
sequences using a windowed approach, and with a length distribution allowing, with equal probability, any length between
10 and 25 residues. All other states were modelled with background amino acid compositions and approximate geometric
length distributions. Using this initial model, residues in the
sequences of the training set were classified according to the
most likely state path for the sequence, and these classifications were then used to update the length and emission distributions of the model states. Length distributions for nongeometric states were smoothed using a gaussian kernel [68].
A kernel bandwidth of 1.0 was used for all states except for the
RLE leader, where a bandwidth of 2.0 was used due to the
greater variability in observed lengths. Variants of the
ExportPred model were also produced that replaced the signal sequence or PEXEL portion of the model with the signal
peptide model from SignalP (with the addition of a more flexible leader state to allow for recessed signal peptides) and/or
the 11 residue motif described in [7], respectively. ROC curves
[69] for the standard ExportPred model are shown in Figure
1b.
To compute a score threshold, we used the training set and
the PfNegative set for positives and negatives, respectively,
and, after correcting for our prior belief that approximately
10% of the P. falciparum is exported, generated a curve
describing false discovery rate (FDR) as a function of score
(Figure 1c). From this curve, a score threshold of 4.3 was
selected, corresponding to a 5% FDR [70], meaning that we
expect 5% of the resulting set of ExportPred predictions above
this threshold to be false positives. A 5% FDR corresponds in
this case to a false positive rate for individual sequences of
approximately 0.5%. A threshold of 0.0 for the KLD path correctly identifies all var genes with a zero false positive rate.
ExportPred is implemented in C++, and has been successfully
compiled using recent versions of g++ on Linux and OSX.
Source code is available on request.

Compilation of the P. falciparum exportome
P. falciparum automated predictions and annotations were
scored using ExportPred. Automated predictions and annotated genes were grouped where their chromosomal locations
were congruent. Ties in which an automated prediction overlapped more than one annotation were broken by selecting

the annotation with the greatest sequence overlap. To address
the problem of misannotation of first exons, the gene model
with the highest PEXEL score was selected from each group
as a representative.

information

The PHIST family was initially detected as a single family
(with the temporary identifier HYP3) by the family clustering
algorithm described. From this initial group, consisting of 44
members, a multiple alignment was created using MUSCLE,
and the conserved portion (which corresponds to a domain
predicted by PSIPRED to consist of 4 α-helices separated by
short coils) was selected to build a HMM using hmmbuild.
Observations based upon the content of the PEXEL motif and
upon phylogenetic analysis led us to further divide this group
into a- and b- subfamilies, and HMMs covering the same conserved stretch were built for these two subfamilies. The three
resulting HMMs were used to search the P. falciparum proteome, expanding the family membership. Any new sequence
matching the superfamily HMM but not either of the a- and
b-subfamily HMMs was assigned to a new c-subfamily. A
HMM was built for the c-subfamily and used to expand its
membership. Once complete lists of sequences in the three

Raw Affymetrix expression data from [14,52] were reanalysed
using the RMA [74] and GCRMA [75] algorithms. For
GCRMA, we used only the probe affinities in the background
correction step, as mismatch probes were not available for
this array. The analysis was carried out using the Bioconductor packages affy and gcrma [76]. For all stages, the maximum
expression from sorbitol and heat treatments was chosen.
Additionally, early and late stages of ring, trophozoite and
schizont stages were summarised by maximisation. A probe
intensity of 5 was taken as a conservative estimate of
expression.

Sequences of DnaJ domains, including 10 amino acids
amino- and carboxy-terminal to the domain were extracted
from Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium sequence sets using
hmmsearch (from the hmmer [35] package) with DnaJ HMM
(PFAM accession: PF00226.16) and e-value cut off of 0.01
and aligned using hmmalign. Bootstrapped neighbour joining
was used to choose a tree topology, and branch lengths were
assigned using least squares error minimisation. Two subtrees were noted to contain sequences from P. falciparum
proteins predicted to be exported. These subtrees were
extracted, ensuring that one C. hominis sequence remained
as an outgroup. Full length sequences were realigned using
MUSCLE, and the resulting multiple alignment used to construct new trees using both neighbour joining and maximum
likelihood puzzling (using TREE-PUZZLE [77]). TREE-PUZZLE was preferred over neighbour joining for small phylogenies, where it was computationally tractible and where
neighbour joining did not produce meaningful results. For
the exported DnaJ type I subtree, it was necessary to manually correct gene models for the three P. vivax and two P. yoelii sequences used. Secondary structure of individual domain
instances was predicted using PSIPRED [78], from which a
consensus structure prediction was derived for the multiple
alignment.

Pairs of P. falciparum sequences were selected from the all by
all comparison where there existed between the two
sequences a reciprocal pair of BLAST hits with an E-value
<10-5 and with subject residues aligned to at least 50% of
query residues, and where at least one of the pair was predicted to be exported. Connected subgraphs were selected to
produce family groups in a manner analogous to that
described above for ortholog clusters. Multiple alignments of
family groups were constructed with MUSCLE and inspected
to verify clustering. A number of already annotated families
(Rifins [5,15], Stevors [16], PfMC-2TM proteins [17], FIKK
kinases [18,19]) were checked to ensure that whole families
had been retrieved by this method. Families for which no
annotation was available for any members were assigned a
HYPn (for HYPothetical family number n) temporary
identifier.

Proteins from P. yoelli, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, P. vivax and
P. knowlesi predicted to be exported by ExportPred were
curated to remove false positives caused by poor gene models.
Each set was BLASTed against ORFs from genomes of the
species represented in the set. Pairs of sequences with homology (<10-5) to similar sets of ORFs (determined by requiring
that at least 50% of hits to ORFs by either sequence were
shared by both) were clustered to simultaneously detect putative orthologs and families.

Ortholog pairs were determined from an all by all BLAST
comparison (ignoring pairwise comparisons within a species)
of the Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium sequence sets using
the reciprocal best hit method [71,72]. Ortholog pairs in
which one or both sequences had a positive PEXEL prediction
were selected. Sequences were then grouped based upon
these pairwise orthology relationships. Clusters were chosen
such that all members were connected to all other members
by orthology relationships either directly, or through a connected chain of orthology relationships (for example, inferring orthology between sequences in species A and C, where
the sequence from species A is orthologous to a sequence
from species B, which is also orthologous to the sequence in
species C). Sequences in each cluster were aligned using
MUSCLE [73].

recreated utilising sequence from all their respective members. Limited cross-recognition was observed between the band c-subfamily HMMs, and no cross-recognition was
observed between the a-subfamily HMM and either of the band c-subfamily HMMs. The three subfamily HMMs were

No significant hits existed outside the Plasmodium genus.

Generation and analysis of GFP fusion proteins
Sequences encoding the amino-terminal portion of PFI1755c,
PFE0055c, PFI1780w, PFE0360c, PF10_0321, PF14_0607
and PFE0355c were amplified from cDNA of an asynchronous P. falciparum culture, strain 3D7. Each of the sequences
encodes the native amino terminus of the protein including
the signal sequence, the predicted PEXEL motif plus an additional 11 amino acids downstream to allow for proper folding
of GFP [10]. PCR products were subcloned (for primers see
Additional data file 3) into the pENTR/D TOPO vector as part
of the MultiSite Gateway™ cloning strategy (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), which has recently been adapted for P.
falciparum expression vectors [79]. Expression vectors were
generated by recombination of the destination vector
pCHDR-3/4 with the three entry clones PfHSP86 5'pENTR4/1, eYFP-pENTR2/3 and the gene-specific pENTR/
D TOPO vector (for details of vector construction see [79]).
Expression vectors were transfected into the P. falciparum
line 3D7 and selected on 10 nM of the antifolate drug
WR99210 as described previously [80]. Transgenic parasites
were cultured under standard conditions [81] and analysed
using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).
