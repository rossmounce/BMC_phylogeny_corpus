Optimization of sequence alignment for simple
sequence repeat regions
Abdulqader Jighly*, Aladdin Hamwieh and Francis C Ogbonnaya

Abstract
Background: Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are tandemly repeated DNA sequences, including
tandem copies of specific sequences no longer than six bases, that are distributed in the genome. SSR has been
used as a molecular marker because it is easy to detect and is used in a range of applications, including genetic
diversity, genome mapping, and marker assisted selection. It is also very mutable because of slipping in the DNA
polymerase during DNA replication. This unique mutation increases the insertion/deletion (INDELs) mutation
frequency to a high ratio - more than other types of molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNPs).
SNPs are more frequent than INDELs. Therefore, all designed algorithms for sequence alignment fit the vast
majority of the genomic sequence without considering microsatellite regions, as unique sequences that require
special consideration. The old algorithm is limited in its application because there are many overlaps between
different repeat units which result in false evolutionary relationships.
Findings: To overcome the limitation of the aligning algorithm when dealing with SSR loci, a new algorithm was
developed using PERL script with a Tk graphical interface. This program is based on aligning sequences after
determining the repeated units first, and the last SSR nucleotides positions. This results in a shifting process
according to the inserted repeated unit type.
When studying the phylogenic relations before and after applying the new algorithm, many differences in the
trees were obtained by increasing the SSR length and complexity. However, less distance between different linage
had been observed after applying the new algorithm.
Conclusions: The new algorithm produces better estimates for aligning SSR loci because it reflects more reliable
evolutionary relations between different linages. It reduces overlapping during SSR alignment, which results in a
more realistic phylogenic relationship.

Background
Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are
tandemly repeated DNA sequences with a period of
from 1 to 6 base pairs [1]. It is sometimes referred to as
a variable number of tandem repeats or VNTRs. An
SSR which contains one type of repeats, is called a simple SSR (e.g. (CA)15) and those which have more than
one type are called compound SSRs (e.g. (CA)8(CG)12)
[2]. The repeat units are generally di-, tri- tetra- or pentanucleotides. They are commonly found in non-coding
regions of the genome.

SSRs are highly mutable loci [3]. In animals, observed
SSR mutation rates have been of the order of 10-3 to 104
for autosomal repeat loci [4,5] (Wiessenbach et al.
1992; Weber and Wong 1993). However the average of
mutations in SSR loci is 10-2 in one generation [6].
Chistiakov et al. [7] suggested that two mechanisms
are responsible for the high mutability in SSRs. First,
motif repetition makes SSRs prone to mutation by DNA
polymerase slippage during replication because of the
multi-complementary sequences, and second, unequal
crossing over or related processes [8-11]. The slippage
rate is correlated to SSR length and this makes longer
SSRs more variable than shorter ones [12,13]. However,
there is no threshold length for slippage mutations [14].
The mutations that happen because of the polymerase

slippage could be considered as special types of insertion/deletion (INDELs) mutations that usually occur
when adding or erasing sequences without any substitution. Substitution is considered as another kind of mutation called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). In
general, SNPs occur much more frequently than
INDELs [15]. But SSR replication slippage generates
more genetic change in eukaryotes than do all base substitution per generation [16], so it increases the frequency of INDELs. In addition, it has been reported
that the perfect SSR motifs are significantly more variable compared to imperfect repeated motifs [17,18].
The power of SSR regions relies on their high abundance in the genome, codominant nature, extensive genome coverage, and high polymorphism [19]. The
polymorphism of SSR depends on the differences in the
numbers of repeated units between alleles at a single
locus. The SSRs are used as molecular markers in a
wide range of applications, such as genome mapping,
marker assisted selection, gene tagging, and evolutionary
and diversity studies [20] The main feature of SSRs that
makes them amenable for use as molecular markers is
that the flanking regions are highly conserved, allowing
the use of specific PCR primers to amplify the same SSR
even across different taxa [21,22].
Sequence alignment involves the identification of the
correct location of INDELS that have happened since
their divergence from a common precursor. The true
alignment reflects the evolutionary relationships between
the sequences accurately. Nevertheless, in the case of a
compound SSR region, the general alignment will show
many overlaps between the different units of repeats,
which seem biologically incorrect because of the replication slippage mutations rate. This suggests a need to reevaluate the general alignment methods and their parameters. In this paper, we surmise that correct alignment
should put the repeats separately without overlapping
between them and without changing the alignment
parameters. We suggest the incorporation of a simple
algorithm for the shifting process of SSR loci after
applying the usual alignment used in regular software.

Findings
Algorithm

In this paper, we compare our new algorithm for SSR
alignment with the common alignment algorithms used
in other programs. The new algorithm (Figure 1) would
deal with the SSR according to the following major
steps:
1- User must identify the following items:
a. Data set file
b. Repeated units
c. SSR length (first and last nucleotide)

Page 2 of 9

2- Identify the sequences that do not match the first
repeated unit from the beginning of the selected SSR
region
3- Do this for each repeated unit
a. Put the tandem repeat in a temporary array
b. Check if the next nucleotides match the next
repeated unit
c. If not, put the unmatched nucleotides in
another temporary array
d. Fill the gaps to the longest sequence of the
repeats in the same array
e. Merge the temporary arrays
4- Put your results instead of the SSR region.

describes the algorithm.
Testing and Implementation

The sequence case A contained a simple SSR with the
tandem TA, which represents 15.4% of the whole
sequence. After applying the alignment in the MEGA 4
alignment and our modifications, one major difference
was shown clearly in the gap sites in some sequences
(Figure 2). However, these differences did not reveal variations in the phylogenic tree before and after applying
the new algorithm, and the whole sequence length
equals 351 bp in both cases (Figure 3).
The sequence case B contained a compound SSR with
the tandem TA and CA, which represents 25.2% of the
whole sequence. The length was increased from 397 bp
to 413 bp after applying the new algorithm. However,
the phylogenic trees indicated that 50% of the samples
showed a similar cluster before and after the new algorithm being applied (Figure 4).
The sequence case C contained a compound SSR of
TA, CA, and CG tandem repeats representing 35% of
the whole sequence. Applying our new algorithm for
case C increased the length of the sequence from 457
bp to 478 bp. However, the comparison of the phylogenic trees before and after applying the new algorithm
showed that only seven samples, 26.9% of the whole
sequence, clustered similarly (Figure 5).
The sequence case D contained compound SSR (TA,
CA, CG, and TG). The length of this tandem repeats
represents 38% of the whole sequence. The whole
sequence length was changed after the new algorithm
was applied from 479 bp to 539 bp. The cluster analysis
resulted in completely different phylogenic trees before
and after applying the new algorithm (Figure 6).
The overall pairwise value (PV) for cases A, B, C, and
D before applying the new algorithm indicated that
these values were increased whenever the sequence contained more repeated units (Figure 7). In contrast, the
PV was decreased after the new algorithm was applied

to the same sequences. Applying the new algorithm
showed a more stable distance by preventing the overlaps between different linages, although it has a slight
decrease, which may be attributed to the additional
aligned repeated unit, The additional units increased the
SSR length giving more similarity because it does not
contain overlaps or mismatches and the only difference
between alleles is the opening gap position. The interval
values between the two PV (before and after applying
the new algorithm) were increased for the cases A, B, C,
and D, indicating that the general alignment methods
revealed more genetic distance.
Case E showed a compound-imperfect SSR repeat
with the tandems GAA, GAT, and GAGGAT respectively. This imperfect SSR represents 9.4% of the
sequence tested in case E. The alignment process
showed clear differences before and after the SSR region
was treated with the new algorithm (Figure 8). Despite
the small percentage of this SSR in the whole sequence
in case E, the phylogenic trees showed that the genetic
distance of the most 24 related sequences was decreased
from 0.00317 to 0.002 (Figure 9). Further, more
sequences that are similar resulted in less branches.
The main limitation with the new algorithm is in
determining the gap position when applied to an

imperfect SSR. According to Kruglyak [17] and Bandström [18], the imperfect repeats within the SSR region
reduces the occurrences of slippage, resulting in the
imperfect SSR changing its tandem nature and fixing
the region by prohibiting replication slippage. This is
because the bases do not find their complementary
bases during replication. However, the best place for the
imperfect nucleotides within a compound SSR is after
the slippage site (the gap) and before the sequence that
follows SSR or the next repeated unit (Figure 7).

B, C and D.

We can deduce from the last examples that (1) the
new algorithm could be a powerful tool for compound
SSRs, but less so for a simple SSR, (2) it increase the
similarity between sequences during alignment by minimizing the overlaps between different repeated units,
and (3) it might be necessary to apply it on sequences
containing long and complicated SSRs.
SSR alignment tool (SALT)

SALT is a new tool for making an alignment for SSR
loci using the new algorithm. It was written using the
PERL programming language. Figure 10 shows the
main window of the program which consists of five
textboxes for the names or the directories for the
input and the output files. The user should determine
his tandem repeats by putting a space character
between each repeated unit and the next one in the
third textbox. The remaining text boxes are for identifying the first and the last nucleotide position of the
SSR locus in the whole sequence. There are also four
buttons, two for browsing the input and the output
files, the third for making the alignment, and the last
for closing the program.
The input file should be aligned sequences in fasta
format or in .txt format:

Conclusions
SALT is a new tool to overcome limitations when
aligning SSR loci based on the new shifting algorithm
proposed in this paper. This tool is essential when
aligning compound or imperfect SSRs, which contain
many overlaps between repeated units, and when

aligning them using the usual methods. The newly
developed tool gives a better alignment estimate for
such regions.

Materials and methods
Five different sequences (Table 1) of SSR motifs
obtained from a biotechnology laboratory (Genetic
Resources Section, ICARDA), were used in this research.
These sequences were obtained from 26 plants representing 26 alleles. The sequences were aligned using the
clustalW algorithm implemented in MEGA 4 with the
following default settings: gap opening penalty 15, gap
extension penalty 6.66, IUB weight matrix, transition
weight 0.5, and delay divergent cut-off 30 [23]. The
same software drew the phylogenic tree with the
UPGMA method. The PERL programming language was
used to design a new algorithm for SSR alignment [24]
