drug discovery?

From 17th Scientific Symposium of the Austrian Pharmacological Society (APHAR). Joint meeting with the
Hungarian Society of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology (MFT)
Innsbruck, Austria. 29-30 September 2011
Background
Cyclotides are disulfide-rich miniproteins with the
unique structural features of a circular backbone and
knotted arrangement of three conserved disulfide bonds.
These features make them exceptionally stable and they
have applications as plant defense (insecticidal) agents
and stable drug frameworks. So far they have been
found mainly in two plant families, including in every
species of the violet family (Violaceae) so far examined,
and in a few species of the coffee family (Rubiaceae).
Methods
We optimized the cyclotide screening protocol using
MALDI-TOF/TOF and two dimensional nano LC-MS/
MS followed by manual and automated peptide sequence
assignments. Biological analysis was carried out by collagen uterine contractility assays and pharmacological data
were generated by competitive displacement binding and
functional GPCR luciferase assays.
Results
Using the rapid cyclotide discovery workflow, we analyzed >300 flowering plant species and confirmed the
presence of cyclotides in several plant families. On the
basis of the phylogeny of cyclotide-bearing plants and
the analysis of precursor gene sequences, we have
refined the current hypothesis of the evolution of circular plant peptides. Based on the traditional usage of the
plant Oldenlandia affinis as an uterotonic agent, we
have tested and identified cyclotides with oxytocin-like
activity and identified the oxytocin receptor, as

representative member of the GPCR family, as a molecular target of cyclotides.

Conclusions
Cyclotides are interesting targets for pharmaceutical applications due to their unique structural framework, their
bioactivities and sequence diversity. Based on their predicted number of tens of thousands, which potentially
makes them one of the largest protein families within the
plant kingdom, they constitute an immense combinatorial
library of natural peptides, which is accessible for drug
discovery.
