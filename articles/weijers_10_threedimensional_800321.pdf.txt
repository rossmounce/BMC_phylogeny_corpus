diabetes-associated gene variant SLC30A8 R325W

Abstract
Background: We examined the effects of the R325W mutation on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the β-cellspecific Zn2+ (zinc) transporter ZnT-8.
Methods: A model of the C-terminal domain of the human ZnT-8 protein was generated by homology modeling
based on the known crystal structure of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) zinc transporter YiiP at 3.8 Å resolution.
Results: The homodimer ZnT-8 protein structure exists as a Y-shaped architecture with Arg325 located at the ultimate
bottom of this motif at approximately 13.5 Å from the transmembrane domain juncture. The C-terminal domain
sequences of the human ZnT-8 protein and the E. coli zinc transporter YiiP share 12.3% identical and 39.5%
homologous residues resulting in an overall homology of 51.8%. Validation statistics of the homology model showed a
reasonable quality of the model. The C-terminal domain exhibited an αββαβ fold with Arg325 as the penultimate Nterminal residue of the α2-helix. The side chains of both Arg325 and Trp325 point away from the interface with the
other monomer, whereas the ε-NH3+ group of Arg325 is predicted to form an ionic interaction with the β-COO- group
of Asp326 as well as Asp295. An amino acid alignment of the β2-α2 C-terminal loop domain revealed a variety of
neutral amino acids at position 325 of different ZnT-8 proteins.
Conclusions: Our validated homology models predict that both Arg325 and Trp325, amino acids with a helix-forming
behavior, and penultimate N-terminal residues in the α2-helix of the C-terminal domain, are shielded by the planar
surface of the three cytoplasmic β-strands and hence unable to affect the sensing capacity of the C-terminal domain.
Moreover, the amino acid residue at position 325 is too far removed from the docking and transporter parts of ZnT-8 to
affect their local protein conformations. These data indicate that the inherited R325W abnormality in SLC30A8 may be
tolerated and results in adequate zinc transfer to the correct sites in the pancreatic islet cells and are consistent with
the observation that the SLC30A8 gene variant R325W has a low predicted value for future type 2 diabetes at
population-based level.
Background
This report continues our analyses of the genetic factors
playing an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes [1]. Genome-wide association studies have currently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
within up to 10 genes associated with an increased risk of
type 2 diabetes [2-6]. Several of the SNPs identified
within or near these genes are hypothesized to influence
β-cell function. Previous studies of the latter genes addi* Correspondence: robw01@xs4all.nl

position 325 (R325W) in the last exon of the solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter; ZnT) member 8
(SLC30A8) gene on 8q24 (Table 1). Yet, contrary to the
outcomes of the above-mentioned association studies,
combining the genetic variants including the SLC30A8
gene variant R325W was recently reported to have low
predicted value for future type 2 diabetes at populationbased level [7-10]. From a different point of view, we continued our analyses to have informed discussion, and

tion on ZnT-8 complete with sensor, actuator and transporter parts.
The SLC30A8 gene encodes a 369-amino acid protein,
ZnT-8, that transports Zn2+ (zinc) from the cytoplasm
into insulin secretory vesicles, where insulin is stored as a
hexamer bound with two zinc ions before secretion [1114]. The ZnT-8 protein is specifically expressed in pancreatic β-cells and thus may be of primary importance for
the insulin secretory pathway. Variations in SLC30A8
may affect zinc accumulation in insulin granules, affecting insulin stability, storage, or secretion.
In mammalian cells, eight homologous zinc export proteins, named ZnT-1 to -8, have been described [11,14].
These proteins are members of the SLC30 subfamily of
the cation diffusion facilitator family. Analysis of genome
sequences shows that cation diffusion facilitators represent a ubiquitous protein family, encompassing more
than 400 evolutionarily related members found in species
ranging from bacteria and yeast to plants and mammals
[15-17]. This protein family is characterized by an N-terminal hydrophobic domain in addition to a C-terminal
cytosolic, hydrophilic region that is highly variable both
in sequence and in length [18] with a common and
remarkably evolutionarily conserved αββαβ fold. Despite
the relatively low sequence homology in the cytoplasmic
domains, the structural homology between them is
impressive. For example, the αββα structural core of the
C-terminal domain from α1 to α2 of the E. coli zinc transporter YiiP can be superimposed onto the equivalent portion of human copper metallochaperone Hah1 with a
root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å for 42 common Cα
positions, although there is no sequence homology
between the C-terminal domain and Hah1 after a evolutionary period of more than thousand millions of years
[[19], see ref. [21]], while the soluble fragment from Thermus thermophilus zinc transporter CzrB overlays the

cytoplasmic domain of YiiP with a Cα-root mean square
deviation of 1.8 Å over 79 residues with an overall
sequence identity of 8.8% [20].
The zinc transporting function is attributed to the
homologous hydrophobic domain, which is thought to be
composed of a bundle of six transmembrane segments,
denoted as TM1 to TM6, in an α-helical configuration, a
structural theme found in many other membrane channels and transporters [21,22]. A representative member
of the cation diffusion facilitator family is YiiP, a dimer of
two identical 33-kD integral zinc transporter membrane
proteins found in the plasma membrane of E. coli [23].
Recently, X-ray diffraction analysis of YiiP crystals and 12
heavy-atom derivative crystals revealed YiiP dimers at a
resolution of 3.8 Å with individual subunits, each containing six bilayer-spanning α-helices, a C-terminal
domain with an αββαβ fold, and four zinc-populated sites
(Fig. 1) [19,24]. Most recently, the C-terminal domain of
CzrB was overexpressed in E. coli and the crystal structure of the apo and zinc forms of the soluble fragment
(CzrBsf) solved to 1.7 and 1.8 Å, respectively [20]. We
have used this, in combination with the structure of YiiP,
to examine the effects of the missense mutation on the
3D structure of the ZnT-8 protein complete with sensor,
actuator and transporter parts.

sequences of human ZnT-2 (Q9BRI3), ZnT-3 (Q99726),

(17). The biological molecule consists of a pair of identical protein
chains, each composed of (a) six transmembrane domains (blue and
green) at the extracellular side, (b) a hydrophilic C-terminal domain
with a αββαβ fold (red and orange) at the intracellular side, and (c) four
zinc-populated sites (top-down designated as Z1 to Z4). Zinc ions are
represented by gray spheres.

sapiens ZnT-8 and E. coli zinc transporter YiiP sequences
were aligned and with a typical homology modeling exercise, the most probable 3D models were created with the
program Modeller, version 9 [27]. The model was validated using the PSVS validation server [28-31] exclusive
of the MolProbity clashscore because for this sort of analysis to be reliable, the reference crystal structure needs to
be better than 2.0 Å resolution [32] (Table 2). All model
representations were prepared using the program Pymol
(DeLano Scientific) [33]. Secondary structure elements of
the C-terminal domain of the zinc transporters CzrB
were indicated as α-helices and β-pleated sheets according to the specifications of Cherezov et al. [20].

Results
We focused our analyses on the C-terminal domain of
ZnT-8 because position 325, at which the mutation takes
place, is located on this part of the protein. A model of
the C-terminal domain of the human ZnT-8 protein was
generated by homology modeling based on the known
crystal structure of the E. coli zinc transporter YiiP at 3.8
Å resolution. The two sequences share 12.3% identical
and 39.5% homologous residues (Fig. 2) resulting in an
overall homology of 51.8%, which is well within the safe
limits for homology modeling. A model was generated
with Modeller [27] and validated using the PSVP validation server (Table 2) [28]. The generated models of the

wild-type ZnT-8 protein and its Arg325Trp variant
revealed a Y-shaped architecture consisting of a pair of
identical protein chains, each composed of six transmembrane domains, a hydrophilic C-terminal domain with a
αββαβ fold and four zinc receiving domains (designated
as Z1 to Z4) (figure not shown). In our model, the Arg325
side-chain is at approximately 15 Å from the Z2 site.
Fig. 3 displays the superposition of the loop connecting
the second β-strand to the second α-helix of the C-terminal domain of the ZnT-8 R325W variant upon the structure of the YiiP zinc transporter. The α2-helix of the ZnT-8
mutated protein has Trp325 as the penultimate N-terminal
residue. Further, the side-chain of Trp325 points away
from the interface with the other monomer. In the wildtype ZnT-8 protein, the α2-helix has Arg325 as the penultimate N-terminal residue, while the Arg325 side-chain has
an orientation virtually identical to that of Trp325 in the
ZnT-8 R325W variant (Fig. 4). Arg325 may form an interchain noncovalent, electrostatic interaction (salt bridge)
with its adjacent Asp326 and an intrachain salt bridge with
Asp295 of the α1-helix of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4).
Table 3 shows the alignment of loop-domains linking the
second β-strand to the second α-helix of the C-terminal
domain of ZnT-8 and other ZnT proteins. The secondary
structure elements (α-helix, β-strand, and loop) are indicated according to the 1.8 À resolution zinc-CzrBsf model
[20]. Position 325, at which the mutation takes place, corresponds to a charged Arg residue. By replacing it with a
Trp residue, the positive charge is removed, thereby
affecting the electrostatic interactions with the protein.

Discussion
This report is a description of a 3D atomic-resolution
model of the C-terminal domain of a β-cell-specific Zn2+
transporter, ZnT-8, predicted from the type 2 diabetesassociated gene variant SLC30A8 R325W. As for studies
in zinc transporter functioning [20,34], we used homology modeling, which is based on the general observation

that evolutionarily related (homologous) proteins are
likely to have similar structures and currently gives the
most accurate and reliable models [35]. We built structural models for ZnT-8 and its gene variant R325W, based
on the known structure of a close homologue (template)
YiiP, a membrane transporter that catalyzes Zn2+/H+
exchange across the inner membrane of E. coli. The qual-

ity of the homology model is dependent of the quality of
the sequence alignment and template structure [36].
Alignment of the ZnT-8 and YiiP C-terminal domain
sequences revealed an overall homology of 51.8%, which
is well within the safe limits for homology modeling (Fig.
2). The model had 89.3% residues in the allowed regions
of the Ramachandran plot, a value consistent with a value
of 90.1% reported for the total structure of ZnT-8 [37].
The YiiP protein shows the main characteristics of a
family of ubiquitous zinc transporters termed cation diffusion facilitator including: (a) a homodimer held
together in a parallel orientation through four zinc ions at
the interface of the cytoplasmic domains, with the two
transmembrane domains swung out to yield a Y-shaped
structure; (b) a 33-kD integral transmembrane protein
composed of a compact bundle of six transmembrane
segments in an α-helical configuration (residues 1-211)
arranged in a way that creates an extra- and an intracellular cavity on either side of the membrane to make room
for one zinc ion, Z1 and Z2, respectively; and, finally, (c) a
hydrophilic C-terminal domain (residues 212-300) consisting of three β-strands and two α-helices (α1-β1-β2α2-β3 order). The latter exists as a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with the overall shape of a flattened ellipsoid. The rounded part of the domain is made up of the
two α-helices laying on top of the β-sheets [38-40]. At the
interface with the other monomer and close to the βsheets, a binuclear zinc cluster is located at the sites Z3
and Z4 (Figs. 3 and 4). Finally, the ZnT-8 protein was predicted to adopt the same topology as the other ZnT proteins with six transmembrane helices [11]. Collectively,
the data presented here suggest that the quality of the
sequence alignment and template structure tend to be
reliable for producing a 3D model of the ZnT-8 C-terminal domain to investigate the structural consequences of
the substitution of Trp for Arg at position 325.
Recently, Cherezov et al. reported seminal data on the
mechanism of transmembrane zinc transport via the
putative zinc transporter CzrB [20]. Briefly, the proposed
transport model suggests that in the absence of zinc the
two flattened ellipsoids (αββαβ motif ) as a dimer are
splayed apart by charge repulsion. This will contribute to
holding the two C-terminal domains apart and will serve
to direct zinc ions into Z3 and Z4 as the intracellular concentrations of the ion rise. Thus, the cytosolic zinc concentration is sensed by the exposed C-terminal domain.
When zinc binds to Z3 and Z4, a large conformational
change occurs that closes the two ellipsoids (αββαβ
motif ) and hence enlarge the dimerization surface area
from ~400Å in the absence of zinc to ~1050Å in its presence. The net effect of this zinc binding is to change the
relative disposition of the cytosolic Z2 domain environment in such a way that a zinc-loaded metallochaperone
can dock for delivery and transport of its zinc cargo to

this intracellular cavity. The ion then travelers across the
membrane into the extracellular cavity Z1 where effectively it is out of the cell.
Our homology model predicts that the Arg325 sidechain is located at approximately 15 Å from the compact
bundle of six transmembrane helices. It is thus rather distant from the transmembrane domain site including the
extra- and the intracellular cavity Z1 and Z2, respectively,
which suggests that the Arg to Trp substitution at position 325 is unlikely to affect the protein folding near the
cavity loci and the uploading of zinc.
The overall shape of the C-terminal domain is that of
an flattened ellipsoid existing of three β-strands with the
central strand running parallel and anti-parallel to its
neighbor on either side and on top two α-helices. The
three β-sheets create a planar and distinctly polar surface
of the ellipsoid with a pronounced negative charge at the
interface with the other monomer, the region with the
bridged zinc ions Z3 and Z4 [20]. Our models predict
that both the side chain of Arg325 and Trp325 point away
from the interface with the other monomer (Fig. 3, 4).
These data suggest that the amino acid residue at position
325 is neither involved in dimerization contacts, nor in
the zinc coordination sites Z3 and Z4, and that the three
β-sheets shield the positive charge of the ε-NH3+ group of
Arg325 from the sites Z3 and Z4 [[19], see Fig. S3; [20],
see Fig. 3]. The existence of an positively charged Arg325
side chain on the outside of the ellipsoid pointing away
from the interface with the other monomer in the presence a pronounced negative charge on the inner side of
the ellipsoid reflects this effective way of shielding. The
above data support the concept that the substitution of
Trp for Arg at position 325 is unlikely to affect the protein
folding of the exposed C-terminal domain, the sensor of
the cytosolic zinc concentration.
Furthermore, our model of the wild-type ZnT-8 predicts an inter- and an intrachain salt bridge linking the εNH3+ group of Arg325 to both the β-COO- group of
Asp326 and Asp295. Because the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point electric charges is
inversely proportional to the square of the total distance
between the two charges, the magnitude of the electrostatic force between Arg325 and Asp295 is approximately
25% compared to the magnitude of the electrostatic force
between Arg325 and Asp326. These observations suggest
that the electrostatic interactions marginally contribute
to the stabilization of the αββαβ fold of the C-terminal
domain. A Trp325 would fit there, but the salt bridges
would be lost, and this loss could alter the conformational
state of the α1-helix and, in turn, the zinc binding and
transport. Surprisingly, sequence alignment of wild-type
ZnT-8 and YiiP revealed that Arg325 found in the former
protein seems to be replaced by a Val residue in the latter

Weijers Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2010, 2:33
http://www.dmsjournal.com/content/2/1/33

protein, implying the disappearance of the salt bridges in
the protein structure of YiiP (Table 2). For similar reasons, these salt bridges are absent in the prototypes of the
bacterial members of the cation diffusion facilitator family homologs CzrB from Thermus thermophilus, ZitB
from E.Coli and CzcD from Ralstonia metallidurans, and
in mouse ZnT-8 (Table 2). A sequence alignment of the
C-terminal domain from the ZnT-2, -3, and -8 proteins
revealed that Arg325 in ZnT-8 was substituted by Thr279
in ZnT-2 and by Ala343 in ZnT-3 (Table 2). Additionally,
an analysis of the phylogenetic tree for all identified
human ZnT family proteins indicated that ZnT-2, -3, and
-8 cluster closely together [19]. Thus, independent of the
existence of the inter- and intrachain salt bridges, all currently known structures of metallochaperones and their
target domains fully control the activity of intracellular
zinc transport [39].
In contrast to our study on ZnT-8, Nicolson et al.
reported that cells expressing the ZnT-8 Trp325 protein
transport more zinc into cells, than cells expressing wildtype ZnT-8 Arg325 protein [37]. However, these observations are likely incorrect, because these conclusions
appear to be based on an assay for ZnT-8 transporter
activity revealing that the transporter may operate in the
reverse direction whereas there are no ATPase domains
in ZnT-8 which may be required for ZnT-8 to operate in
the reverse direction. For instance, non-specific events
may be responsible for the observed different rates of zinc
transport, i.e., difference in the number of zinc transporters per area unit of secretory granules of β-cells expressing either wild-type or Trp325 variant of ZnT-8, or
difference in background color of microscopy images of
control cells versus β-cells expressing either wild-type or
Trp325 variant of ZnT-8, as very similar experiments
revealed a substantial amount of zinc in control cells in
normal conditions versus ZnT-8-expressing cells, i.e., 830
± 109 μg Zn/g protein and 1072 ± 78 μg Zn/g protein,
respectively [12]. Nicolson et al. also concluded that the
resultant introduction of positive charge into the region
of monomer interface of ZnT-8, close to the predicted
sites of bound structurally important zinc ions, may be
expected to affect the kinetics of zinc transport [37].
Without any particular detail of a 3D model for ZnT-8,
their conclusions are based merely on the observation
that R325 resides at the monomer interface as our models
predict that the side chains of both Arg325 and Trp325
point away from the interface with the other monomer.
To resolve the above discussed differences and to show
that wild-type Arg325 and Trp325 variant of ZnT-8 are
no different in their ability to form dimers and their ability to transport zinc, we propose to improve the experimental conditions to prevent reverse zinc transport as
described for ZnT-8 [37] and ZnT-5 [41]. Next, we propose the following sequence of experiments: (a) to assay

Page 7 of 8

directly the functional activity of ZnT-8, measure the
transmembrane flux of zinc across the plasma membrane
of Xenopus laevis oocytes [41]; (b) inject oocytes with
wild-type Arg325 ZnT-8 RNA, with Trp325 variant of
ZnT-8 RNA or water; (c) assay zinc uptake into oocytes
by measuring 65Zn2+ incorporation into single oocytes as
γ emission [42].
According to the data presented by Cherezov et al. [20],
Arg325 is a part of the α2 helical structure of the C-ternminal domain (Table 2). Arg has a helix-forming behavior
and its tendency is to stabilize α-helices [43]. Also, Trp
has a helix-forming behavior, which makes it unlikely that
the R325W mutation affects the α2-helix folding.
An obvious limitation of our study is largely inherent to
all theoretical models in biochemistry in general, which
never allow complete certainty [36]. Our model of the
ZnT-8 protein was based on a crystal structure of the E.
coli zinc transporter YiiP. In the future, a high resolution
ZnT-8 structure model will help to identify all specific
residues that may contribute to full transport activity of
zinc. Furthermore, we cannot fully exclude the possibility
that the presence of a Trp residue at position 325 does
not interfere with the binding of a putative zinc metallochaperone. However, cross-sectional analyses of 75-g 3h oral glucose tolerance test results for a large sample of
Caucasians and for populations with an exceptionally
high prevalence of type 2 diabetes revealed inverted-U
plots of insulin vs. glucose in plasma, implying direct
proof of excellent insulin secretion during the pre-diabetic state, and consequently of adequate zinc transfer to
the correct sites in the pancreatic islet cells [44-46].

Conclusions
This modeling predicts that both Arg325 and Trp325,
amino acids with a helix-forming behavior and penultimate N-terminal residues in the α2-helix of the C-terminal domain, are shielded by the planar surface of the three
cytoplasmic β-strands and hence unable to affect the
sensing capacity of the C-terminal domain. Moreover, the
amino acid residue at position 325 is too far removed
from the docking and transporter parts to affect their
local protein conformations. These data suggest that the
inherited R325W abnormality in SLC30A8 may be tolerated and results in adequate zinc transfer to the correct
sites in the pancreatic islet cells and provide support to
assume that the SLC30A8 gene variant R325W has a low
predicted value for future type 2 diabetes at populationbased level [7-9].
