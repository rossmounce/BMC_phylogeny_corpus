<p>The relationships
Diversification of rice among all diploid genome types of the rice genus were clarified using 142 single-copy genes</p>

Abstract
Background: The completion of rice genome sequencing has made rice and its wild relatives an
attractive system for biological studies. Despite great efforts, phylogenetic relationships among
genome types and species in the rice genus have not been fully resolved. To take full advantage of
rice genome resources for biological research and rice breeding, we will benefit from the availability
of a robust phylogeny of the rice genus.
Results: Through screening rice genome sequences, we sampled and sequenced 142 single-copy
genes to clarify the relationships among all diploid genome types of the rice genus. The analysis
identified two short internal branches around which most previous phylogenetic inconsistency
emerged. These represent two episodes of rapid speciation that occurred approximately 5 and 10
million years ago (Mya) and gave rise to almost the entire diversity of the genus. The known
chromosomal distribution of the sampled genes allowed the documentation of whole-genome
sorting of ancestral alleles during the rapid speciation, which was responsible primarily for
extensive incongruence between gene phylogenies and persisting phylogenetic ambiguity in the
genus. Random sample analysis showed that 120 genes with an average length of 874 bp were
needed to resolve both short branches with 95% confidence.
Conclusion: Our phylogenomic analysis successfully resolved the phylogeny of rice genome types,
which lays a solid foundation for comparative and functional genomic studies of rice and its
relatives. This study also highlights that organismal genomes might be mosaics of conflicting
genealogies because of rapid speciation and demonstrates the power of phylogenomics in the
reconstruction of rapid diversification.

Background

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world, providing the staple food for more than one-half of the world's population [1,2]. The completion of rice genome sequencing has
made rice and its wild relatives an increasingly attractive system for biological studies at the genomic level [3-5]. Considerable insights have been recently gained into comparative
genomics between rice and other cereal crops of the grass
family [6] and between the species of the rice genus, Oryza
[7,8]. To take full advantage of rice genome resources for
basic biological research and rice breeding, we will benefit
from the availability of a robust phylogeny of the rice genus.
The genus Oryza consists of 2 cultivated and approximately
22 wild species distributed in a diverse range of habitats in
tropics and subtropics of the world [9]. By assessing the
degree of meiotic pairing in interspecific hybrids, traditional
genome analyses grouped the majority of Oryza species into
five diploid and two allotetraploid genome types: A-, B-, C-,
E-, F-, BC-, and CD-genomes [10]. Because of the difficulties
in obtaining hybrids with presumably more distantly related
species, three additional genomes, G-, HJ-, and HK-genomes,
were later recognized based on total genomic DNA hybridization [11] and molecular phylogenetics [12]. In Oryza, onethird of extant species are allotetraploids that originated
through hybridization between diploid genomes, and, in particular, four (B-, E-, F-, and G-genomes) out of the six diploid
genomes each have a single species [1,9,13]. Consequently,
elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of the diploid rice
genomes is critically important for understanding the evolutionary history of the entire genus.
Despite extensive studies on evolutionary relationships
among rice genomes and species [10,12,14-16], the phylogenetic relationships among genomes remained elusive until a
study that sampled all recognized Oryza species and utilized
sequences of two nuclear and one chloroplast genes [12]. This
study supported the monophyly of each of the previously recognized genome types and reconstructed the origins of tetraploid species. Nevertheless, two areas of the phylogeny were
left unresolved due to incongruence between gene trees.
These included the relationship among A-, B-, and Cgenomes and that among the F-genome, G-genome, and the
rest of the genus [12]. The incongruence was highlighted in
the rice phylogenetic literature, where all three possible relationships among A-, B-, and C-genomes were suggested
[10,12,16-18]. More remarkable is the position of the Fgenome, which varied from being the most basal lineage of
the entire genus [16,19] to being nested within the recently
diverged A-genome [15,20].
The recent decade has witnessed the successful utilization of
large quantities of DNA sequences in solving long-standing
phylogenetic problems [21-30]. As a growing number of
genomes are decoded, phylogenetic reconstruction using
genome-wide markers, or phylogenomics [31,32], will pro-

vide unprecedented opportunities to elucidate the previously
controversial evolutionary relationships at all taxonomic levels [31,33]. In this study, we screened the genome sequences
of two rice cultivars and sampled 142 single-copy genes as
markers for reconstructing the phylogeny of all diploid rice
genomes. This phylogenomic analysis, for the first time, fully
resolved the relationships of the rice genome types. It further
revealed that two episodes of rapid diversification in the rice
genus were responsible for the phylogenetic incongruence
that persisted in the previous studies. We suggest that rapid
diversification might be widespread in organismal evolution
and caution that under rapid speciation, large data sets or
phylogenomic approach are required to resolve phylogenetic
relationships with a high degree of confidence.

Results
Phylogeny inferred from concatenated sequences of
142 genes
After an extensive screen of rice genome sequences, we identified and sequenced 142 single-copy genes that were most
likely free of the paralogy problem for reconstructing the phylogeny of all diploid genome types of Oryza (Table 1; see
Materials and methods for details of gene screening). These
genes are distributed throughout the 12 rice chromosomes
and represent a genome-wide sampling of phylogenetic
markers (Additional data files 1 and 2). After removing
regions with ambiguous alignment, we concatenated the 142
genes into a data matrix of 124,079 bp, with exons accounting
for 43% of the total sequence. The concatenated alignment
contained 26,838 (21.6%) variable sites, of which 6,753
(5.4%) were phylogenetically informative (Additional data
file 2).
Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated sequences using
maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and
Bayesian inference (BI) all yielded a single fully resolved tree
with high bootstrap support or Bayesian posterior probability
(PP) for all internal branches (Figure 1). We labeled these
branches as I, II, III, and IV. The relationships between A-, B-,
and C-genomes are finally resolved, with the sister relationship between A- and B-genomes supported by 99-100% bootstrap support or PP. The F-genome, which jumped all over the
previously reported phylogenies, is firmly placed between the
basal G-genome and the rest of the genome types.
Because the increase in sequence length or the number of
sampled genes does not guarantee the elimination of systematic errors [28,34,35], it is necessary to investigate the potential impact of systematic bias on our phylogenetic
reconstruction. First, we tested homogeneity of base composition across species for total, intron, exon, and three codon
sites of the concatenated data set. The results indicated that
four nucleotide bases occurred in almost equal proportions
and the GC content varied little among species for all data
partitions (χ2 tests, P = 0.346-1.0; Additional data file 3). The

sitional signals that could have biased the phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Second, we analyzed rate constancy among lineages using
Tajima's relative rate test [37]. When the concatenated
sequences were considered, results showed that the null
hypothesis of rate constancy was rejected in almost all pairs
of contrasts (P < 0.01). It is noteworthy that the F-genome
evolved at a faster rate and the G-genome evolved at a slower
rate than other genomes (Additional data file 4). To explore
the potential impact of rate heterogeneity on tree reconstruction, we adopted the RY-coding strategy that discards fastevolving transitions and consequently makes phylogenetic
reconstructions less susceptible to uneven occurrence of multiple hits among lineages [34,38]. The tree obtained from the
re-coded data set was topologically identical to that shown in
Figure 1 (Table 2). To further test the potential long-branch
attraction effect of the fast-evolving F-genome, we identified
genes that evolved more rapidly in the F-genome than in the
A-, B-, and C-genomes. We calculated the ratio of the mean
distance between the F-genome and each of A-, B-, and Cgenomes to the mean distances among A-, B-, and C-genomes
for each gene. We then progressively excluded fast-evolving
genes of the F-genome in a decreasing order of the ratios. The
topology based on the remaining genes did not change until
more than 50 genes were excluded (Additional data file 5).
These suggest that rate heterogeneity was not severe enough
to cause significant systematic bias.
Third, to examine the potential systematic errors caused by
model misspecification [30,32,35], we applied a series of
homogeneous and mixed models in BI and evaluated the relative merits of competing models by Bayes factors. Although
Bayes factor comparisons showed that all mixed models outperformed the homogeneous models significantly (Additional

including ones incorporating the covarion model, which
accounts for heterotachous signal, yielded the same topology
as shown in Figure 1, with all internal branches supported by
100% PP. Taken together, the above analyses indicate that the
phylogeny inferred from the concatenated gene sequences
was not biased by systematic errors.
We next tested whether the resulting phylogeny could have
been influenced by a subset of the genes. A gene bootstrap
analysis was performed with 1,000 replicates [27]. For each
replicate, we randomly drew 142 genes with replacement
from the entire pool. The sampled genes were concatenated
and analyzed using ML. The results strongly supported the
topology shown in Figure 1 (Table 2), indicating that the phyO. sativa

logenetic reconstruction was not dominated by a subset of the
142 genes.
Finally, we investigated whether within-genome sampling
would influence the phylogenetic reconstruction. Because the
A- and C-genomes have more than one species, while each of
the remaining genomes has only one species [1,9,13], we
sequenced 62 genes for an additional A-genome species, O.
barthii, and two additional C-genome species, O. rhizomatis
and O. eichingeri (Table 1). Sequences of cultivated rice, O.
sativa, belonging to the A-genome were also retrieved from
the BGI-RIS Database [39] and added to the data set. Phylogenetic analyses of the 11 species generated the same intergenome relationship as the one shown in Figure 1 (Figure 2).
This indicates that one species sampled from each genome
was sufficiently representative for the reconstruction of the
genome relationships.

Phylogenetic incongruence and network analyses
When phylogenetic analyses were done for each of the 142
genes separately, more than 40 different optimal trees were
generated, indicative of extensive incongruence among gene
phylogenies. To gain insight into the extent of incongruence,
we constructed consensus networks from ML trees of the 106gene data set without missing data. Figure 3a shows the network at a threshold of 0.15, which presents branches appearing at a frequency of 15% or higher of all gene trees. Two boxes
are evident in the network, indicating that topological incongruence is concentrated on branch I involving the relationships between A-, B-, and C-genomes and branch IV involving
the relationships between the F-genome, G-genome, and the
rest of the genome types (R). We also explored the features of
consensus networks by increasing the threshold from 0.05
and found that the boxes were collapsed when the threshold
reached 0.3 and it ended up with the topology identical to that
shown in Figure 1 (Additional data file 8). These results further support the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the
concatenated data set and highlight the incongruence involving branches I and IV.
In the first box, the length of parallel edges supporting split
AB|CEFGL is longer than those supporting splits AC|BEFGL
and BC|AEFGL (Figure 3a), suggesting that a higher proportion of consensus signal groups A and B together. This is in

agreement with the result that a larger number of gene trees
(53%) support the sister relationship of A and B than those
supporting the alternative sister relationship between B and
C (26%) or between A and C (21%) (Figure 3b). For the second
box, the length of parallel edges supporting split ABCEF|GL
is longer than those supporting the two alternative splits. This
is also consistent with the result that 45% of gene trees support the sister relationship between R and F while 30% and
25% of gene trees support the sister relationships between R
and G or between F and G, respectively (Figure 3b).
To further explore the incongruence among gene trees, we
performed the incongruence length difference (ILD) test
based on two partitioning strategies and found that there was

no significant incongruence between any pair of the process
partitions (intron and three codon positions; Additional data
file 9). In contrast, significant heterogeneity was found
among gene partitions, including tests among all gene partitions as a whole (P < 0.01) and between pairwise comparisons
and between each gene and the remaining genes combined
(Additional data file 10). These results were consistent with
the distributions of bootstrap support for alternative topologies at the two boxes (Figure 3b). For each box, there is a substantial proportion of high bootstrap support for alternative
topologies, suggesting that the competing topologies are well
supported on the respective gene trees. Remarkably, genes
supporting any given topology are distributed randomly

among the 12 chromosomes (χ2 test, P = 0.233-0.823), indicative of a genome-wide incongruence (Figure 3c).
To address the question of whether the incongruence among
genes is attributed to different evolutionary histories of genes
or merely systematic errors [40,41], we conducted tests for
systematic bias for each of the 142 genes. The Chi-square test
revealed that there was no heterogeneity of base composition
for any gene. However, rate heterogeneity was detected for
some genes by the relative rate test. We then conducted phylogenetic analyses for each gene using different strategies,
including ML, MP, RY-coding, and LogDet distance. The
comparison of bootstrap 75% majority-rule consensus trees
showed that only 4 out of 142 genes yielded incompatible
topologies between different methods of analyses (Additional
data file 11). This indicates that there are few systematic
errors involved in individual genes and the incongruence
among gene partitions is governed mainly by different evolutionary histories of genes.

Short branches and their resolution
Different evolutionary histories of genes can be attributed to
three major factors, including paralogy, hybridization, and
lineage sorting [40]. We have largely ruled out the potential
effect of paralogy by carefully screening gene markers (see
Materials and methods). The pattern of incongruence also
does not support hybrid speciation because hybridization
would have led to two major incongruent topologies rather
than the presence of a leading topology with two alternative
topologies occurring at nearly equal frequencies for both
clades I and IV. The random distribution on chromosomes of
the genes that support a given topology (Figure 3c) does not
support the hybridization hypothesis either because related
or linked loci should share gene trees if the species have a history of introgression or hybridization [42]. Therefore, we are
left with the hypothesis of lineage sorting as the primary
explanation for the incongruence.
Population genetic theory suggests that lineage sorting is
more likely to occur at an internal branch of a species tree that
is short (few in generations) and wide (large in effective population sizes) [43,44]. Based on estimation by the ML
method, branches I and IV were the shortest internal braches
on the concatenation tree and obtained relatively low support
values in analyses with different methodologies (Figure 1 and
Table 2). For branch I, there is a sufficient amount of published data that allow us to estimate the probability to obtain
the species tree from a given gene. That is, P = 1 - 2/3exp(-t)
under the coalescent model, where t is the time between two
speciation events in the unit of generations/2Ne and Ne is the
effective population size [43].
Using the previously reported nucleotide diversity at silent
sites (θsil = 0.0038-0.0095) for the A- and C-genome species
[45,46] and a substitution rate for grasses (5.9 × 10-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year) [47,48], we estimated that

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R49

Zou et al. R49.6

the effective population sizes of these Oryza species ranged
from 1.6 × 105 to 4.0 × 105. A speciation model test on three Cgenome species suggested that their ancestral population sizes
were approximately ten-fold larger than those of each species
[45]. Thus, the ancestral population size of A-, B-, and Cgenomes (Ne) should be at least 1.6 × 106. Because the Agenome species began to diverge approximately 2 Mya [49]
and divergence between B- and C-genomes occurred approximately 3.8 Mya [45], the time between two speciation events
should be less than 1.8 million years. Given the generation
time of 1-2 years in wild rice species [50], the number of generations between the two speciation events is at most 1.8 ×
106. The estimated upper limit of generations together with
the lower limit of Ne led to the calculation of the upper limit
of P as 0.62. This implies that there is less than a 62% chance
for any given gene tree to be the same as the species tree or
less than 62% of gene trees from the sampled genes will be
congruent with the species tree. Our finding that 53% of gene
trees support the sister relationship of A- and B-genomes
agrees with the theoretical expectation (Figure 3b), which further supports the lineage sorting hypothesis.
For branch IV, the divergence happened at greater depth in
the tree and thus homoplasy resulting from mutational saturation might be a factor to cause incongruent gene phylogenies [33,51]. However, analyses of saturation plots did not
reveal any mutational saturation for the concatenated data
set (Additional data file 12), suggesting that lineage sorting is
still the most plausible explanation for the incongruence.
To assess how much of the data set might be needed to resolve
such short branches, we explored the relationship between
the number of genes or nucleotide sites and the proportion of
gene trees that support the topology or clades shown in Figure
1. The results demonstrated that the probability of getting
identical topology or clades as in Figure 1 steadily increased
with the number of genes or sites sampled, regardless of
methods used, although ML generally performed better than
MP (Figure 4). Using 95% of identical gene trees or clades in
500 replicates as a criterion, about 120 genes were needed for
both ML and MP methods to resolve branch I and more than
80 (ML) and 120 (MP) genes were needed to resolve branch
IV. Additionally, 120 (ML) or more genes (MP) were needed
to resolve both branches simultaneously (Figure 4 and Additional data file 13).
When nucleotide sites rather than genes were the unit of resampling, about 40 kb of nucleotides were sufficient to resolve
branch I with both methods. This is equivalent to 46 sampled
genes in length given the average length of 874 bp per gene. It
took approximately 40 kb and 80 kb (approximately 92
genes) for ML and MP, respectively, to resolve branch IV. A
total of 50 kb (approximately 57 genes) for ML and 80 kb for
MP were sufficient to resolve both branches simultaneously
(Figure 4 and Additional data file 13). These results indicate
that random sampling of unlinked nucleotides has a higher

Discussion

This study fully resolved the phylogeny of the rice genomes.
Through extensive tests and analyses, we demonstrate that
the phylogenetic reconstruction based on the sequences of
142 genes was not biased by systematic or sampling errors
and was insensitive to phylogenetic methods or model specification. We identified across the genome a remarkable level
of incongruence of gene phylogenies at the two shortest internal branches (Figures 1 and 3). Our analyses clearly indicated
that lineage sorting was a primary cause for the difficulty of

resolving two branches of the rice phylogeny that underwent
rapid diversification. Even more remarkably, lineage sorting
occurred for genes distributed randomly across all 12 rice
chromosomes (Figure 3c). This study thus documents a case
of genome-wide lineage sorting that gave rise to species with
the mosaic of ancestral genomes [26,52]. One implication of
our findings is that special caution must be taken in interpreting phylogenetic relationships of rapidly diverged lineages
even though the relationships are strongly supported on a single gene phylogeny. Our results also imply that although it
may not be feasible to have a large number of genes to resolve
a short branch for groups with limited genomic resources, utilization of a few genes should provide a clue to the extent to
which lineage sorting may lead to erroneous phylogenies [12].

The biological implications for the presence of two short
branches (I and IV) that reflect two episodes of rapid diversification of the rice genus are profound. Based on a molecular
clock estimate, the first event occurred approximately 10 Mya
[53] and led to a rapid diversification of the G-genome, Fgenome and a lineage that subsequently diversified into the
rest of the rice genomes. Additionally, the H-, J-, and Kgenomes that are now only present in extant tetraploid species, including O. longiglumis and O. ridleyi with the HJgenome and O. schlechteri and O. coarctata with the HKgenome, also diverged around this time [12,53]. The second
event led to the diversification of A-, B-, and C-genomes
approximately 5 Mya [45,53]. Therefore, the two episodes of
rapid diversification gave rise to almost the entire diversity of
the genus. Because the Oryza species are distributed in distinct habitats across four continents [1,50], it would be interesting to further investigate whether the rapid diversification
was coupled with adaptive radiation under certain geological
and ecological conditions [54,55].
Rapid speciation, particularly ancient radiation, featured by
the short internal branches in phylogenetic trees, poses an
extraordinary challenge to systematic and evolutionary biologists [33,51,55,56]. It has been observed at a variety of time
depths ranging from as early as the Cambrian explosion of
animal phyla over 550 Mya [25] to as recent as the divergence
between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla a few Mya
[52,57,58]. In many cases, phylogenetic relationships seemed
to be an irresolvable polytomy [23,56,59] because of the rapid
radiations. Such closely spaced series of speciation events was
accordingly considered to be "bushes in the Tree of Life" [33].
To date, rapid evolutionary radiations have been proposed to
be the most plausible explanation for the poorly resolved phylogenies or polytomies in many organisms such as aphids,
black flies, bees, birds, turtles, mammals, and higher plants
[29,30,33,51,60]. However, a growing body of evidence
showed that many assumed polytomies were 'soft' and could
be resolved into sequential bifurcations with additional data
and proper methods of phylogenetic analysis [52,59,61,62].
In a study of phylogenetic relationships among tetrapod, coelacanth, and lungfish, Takezaki et al. [59] obtained an irresolvable trichotomy although sequences of 44 nuclear genes
were analyzed. Using computer simulation, they concluded
that more than 200 loci would have to be analyzed to resolve
the relationships among the three lineages if the fish-to-tetrapod transition interval was 10-20 million years long. The once
unresolved relationship among human, chimpanzee, and
gorilla is a typical example of soft polytomies. Recent analyses
with an increased amount of molecular data resolved human
and chimpanzee into a sister group [52,57,58]. Our results
exemplify that rapid speciation within an angiosperm genus
can be reliably resolved as long as a sufficient amount of
unlinked DNA sequences is available.
However, we should also realize that the increase in the
amount of data alone may not provide a universal solution to

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R49

all short branches on the Tree of Life. It is theoretically possible that certain branches are not resolvable even with whole
genome sequences if time intervals between speciation were
extremely short and the speciation events were sufficiently
ancient [31,33,51]. These branches are considered to be 'hard'
polytomies [33,61]. Nevertheless, both soft and hard
polytomies provide historical information on evolutionary
processes and a phylogenetic analysis with genome-wide
information can be most helpful for understanding the evolutionary histories behind these seemingly problematic, but
perhaps intriguing, branches of the Tree of Life.
For soft polytomies, an obviously interesting question is how
many DNA sequences would be needed to resolve rapid speciation considering that DNA sequences have been, and will
remain, major sources of biological data [31,32]. The mosaic
genome or different evolutionary histories of genes under
rapid speciation, in conjunction with other factors associated
with species divergence (for example, selection and high
homoplasy of ancient speciation [33,51]), brings about difficulties in resolving speciation events when using a small
number of regions/genes or limited characters [22,59]. This
study shows that as many as 120 genes with an average length
of 874 bp or 50 kb of randomly sampled nucleotides from 142
genes are needed to resolve clades I and IV simultaneously
with over 95% confidence (Figure 4). Clearly, blocks of contiguous nucleotide sites were less powerful in phylogenetic
resolution than samples consisting of sites drawn randomly
from the genome because nucleotides within genes do not
evolve independently [22,63]. This implies that for the same
amount of sequence data, a larger number of unlinked shorter
DNA fragments are preferred over a smaller number of larger
fragments for resolving short branches.

Conclusion

As the speed of genome sequencing continues to accelerate,
phylogenomics is becoming a growing field of evolutionary
biology. The potential of phylogenomics to address fundamental evolutionary questions has yet to be realized with the
accumulation of phylogenomic studies for diverse groups of
organisms [31-33]. The successful resolution of the rice phylogeny demonstrates the power of phylogenomics in the
reconstruction of rapid evolutionary diversification. This
study also highlights that organismal genomes might be
mosaics of conflicting genealogies because of rapid speciation
and exemplifies that phylogenetic relationships of organisms
that undergo explosive or rapid diversification can be reliably
resolved with increasing amounts of data and improved analytical methodology. A fully resolved rice phylogeny lays a
solid foundation for comparative and functional genomic
studies of rice and its related species and genera. Combined
with the availability of rice genome sequences [2,64] and the
BAC libraries of Oryza species representing all rice genome
types [7], this phylogenetic framework will play an important

mated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
All sequences obtained in this study have been deposited in
the GenBank database (accession numbers EF577518 to
EF578433, and EU503348 to EU503533; Additional data file
14).

Sampling single-copy genes
We used the BGI-RIS Database [39] for gene screening. Similar to the strategy used by Yu et al. [64], we extracted the protein sequences with nr-KOME cDNA [65] evidence and then
conducted extensive searches against the genomic sequences
of indica rice (93-11) in all six reading frames using TBLASTN
at E-values of 10-7. To ensure that single-copy genes were
used in our analysis, we applied a stringent similarity criterion of 50% in our searches; that is, only protein-coding genes
that have no counterpart over 50% similar to themselves in
the rice genome were selected for further analyses. Excluding
those sequences without syntenic counterparts in the
japonica (Nipponbare) genome [2], we got a total of 943
genes as candidates for phylogenetic markers. Using coding
sequences of these candidates, we performed BLAST searches
against the GenBank database to obtain the gene counterparts from barley, maize, sorghum, wheat, or other species of
Poaceae as targets for primer design. On this basis, we
designed 162 pairs of primers for amplifying orthologous segments from Oryza species and the outgroup Leersia tisserantti. Finally, 118 genes were kept according to the following
criteria: they were sampled randomly from all the 12 rice
chromosomes; the amplifying length ranged from 0.5-2.0 kb
with an intron length of 30-70% so that adequate information
is available at different taxonomic levels; and clear and strong
amplified fragments were obtained from the Oryza species
and the outgroup. Moreover, we sequenced 24 additional
genes that were single copies demonstrated by previous studies (Additional data file 2). All the 142 genes used in this study
were mapped onto the chromosomes of indica rice (93-11)
(Additional data file 1).

Species sampling, amplification, and sequencing
We sampled six Oryza species, representing all six diploid
genomes in the genus, and one Leersia species (L. tisserantti)
as outgroup because Leersia is most closely related to Oryza
[12,53]. Information on the materials used in this study is
listed in Table 1. Primers for PCR of all 142 genes are listed in
Additional data file 14. Missing or partial sequences of some
genes were present in some species because of the amplifying
difficulty (Table 1). However, missing data in our case did not
impact the tree constructions no matter what methods were
used because our data set contained sufficient information,
consistent with previous computer simulation and empirical
investigation [21,25,66].
PCR amplifications and purification of the products were performed by standard methods. Purified products were
sequenced either directly or after cloning into pGEM T-easy
vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) if the direct sequencing failed. Sequencing was carried out on an ABI 3730 auto-

Phylogenetic reconstructions
Individual genes were aligned using T-Coffee [67] and then
manually adjusted. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by
ML, MP and BI methods. ML and MP were implemented with
PAUP 4.0b10 [68] and the branch-and-bound algorithm was
used for tree searching. A non-parametric bootstrap strategy
[69] was used for assessing tree reliability, with 1,000 replicates for MP analysis and with 100 and 500 replicates for ML
analysis of the concatenated sequence and single genes,
respectively.
BI was attempted with MrBayes 3.1.2 [70]. Given the sensitivity of the Bayesian method to model misspecification, we
explored a series of homogeneous models by combining
model components in different ways, including substitution
rates among nucleotides (Nst = 1, 2, 6), rate variations across
sites (Rates = Equal, Gamma, Propinv, Invgamma), and rate
variations across the tree (Covarion = Yes, No) (Additional
data file 6). Furthermore, we explored mixed models that
accommodate heterogeneity across data partitions by specifying partition-specific substitution models [70]. We applied
mixed models to our partitioned data by two schemes (see
'Analysis of systematic bias and congruence tests' below).
Mixed models were implemented with separate models for
each data partition selected by the program Modeltest 3.7 [71]
and model parameters separately estimated, and a rate multiplier (ratepr = variable) was also employed to allow the
overall rate to be different across partitions. In all the BI analyses, three independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs
were executed, each starting with randomly choosing topologies for the four simultaneous chains, one cold and three
incrementally heated. The four chains were run for at least
1,000,000 generations until stationarity in Markov chains
was achieved, sampling trees every 100 generations with the
first 10% of trees sampled discarded as burn-in, and then the
posterior probabilities were calculated from the remaining
samples.
We used Bayes factors [72] to evaluate the relative merits of
two competing models, with the intention of detecting the
effect of model components on our data. This method does
not require alternative models to be hierarchically nested,
and so it makes possible the comparison of any pair of distinctly different models. A Bayes factor in favor of one model
(model 1) over another model (model 0) was calculated as the
ratio of their marginal likelihoods and the natural logarithm
of marginal likelihood can be approximated by the harmonic
mean of the likelihoods of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples with MrBayes [73]. We calculated twice the natural logarithm of the Bayes factors for the competing model pairs, and

interpreted the results according to the rule suggested by
Kass and Ratery [72], which states that a result of 2 to 6 is
'positive' evidence in favor of model 1, a result of 6 to 10 is
'strong' evidence, and a result of >10 is 'very strong' evidence;
conversely, a result of <0 provides evidence in favor of model
0.

Phylogenetic network analysis
To combine evidence from different loci without losing the
information on independent gene histories, which might be
drowned out by suppressing them into a bifurcating tree, several phylogenetic network approaches have been proposed
and proven to be useful alternatives when using multi-gene
data sets [74-76]. Consensus network, which is applied to
multiple trees with the same set of taxa, is one commonly
used network approach and can display simultaneously the
conflicting evolutionary hypotheses based on multiple loci in
a network fashion [74,76]. Such conflict or uncertainty might
arise from stochastic errors, systematic bias, or biological
processes [75]. Therefore, phylogenetic networks provide a
more inclusive approach than analysis of the concatenated
data set because weak or conflicting signals are hidden when
genes are concatenated before phylogenetic analysis [76].
In the consensus network, areas where all trees have compatible splits (that is, a split is a bipartition of the taxa) will be
tree-like (that is, a single branch); in contrast, areas with
incompatible splits will be represented by bands of parallel
edges, thus forming a potentially hyper-dimensional graph.
The degree of denseness of boxes in networks reflects the
intensity of contradictory evidence for grouping certain taxa,
and the length of an edge is determined by the weight
assigned to it [74,75]. The phylogenetic networks can range
from one extreme, a structure of high-dimensional hypercubes in the absence of any common phylogenetic patterns
among gene trees, to the other extreme, a unique bifurcating
tree in the absence of stochasticity associated with bifurcating
evolutionary process [75]. By employing the threshold value,
we can reduce the visual complexity of resulting graphs by
using only the splits that occur in more than a given proportion of all trees.
In the present study, we constructed consensus networks
from optimal ML trees for a 106-gene data set in which
sequences of all six diploid genomes and the outgroup were
available and included in our consensus network all splits
that occurred above a threshold value ranging from 0.05-0.3.
In our case, branch lengths were not considered when using
optimal ML trees as source trees because we were only interested in the conflict between topologies of gene trees. Thus,
edge lengths in the final network are proportional to the
number of trees in which a particular split appears. Consensus network was performed by the method described by Holland [76], in which Python scripts (kindly offered by BR
Holland) was first implemented to create Nexus files and then
the resulting network was visualized by Spectronet [77].

Analysis of systematic bias and congruence tests
Systematic errors such as compositional signal, rate signal
and heterotachous signal might be reinforced as more and
more data are considered [35]. We first tested the compositional bias resulting from the heterogeneity of nucleotide
compositions among lineages by Chi-square test. The LogDet
distance [36] was also used to account for compositional bias
with the neighbor-joining method. Then Tajima's relative
rate test [37] was employed with each pair of Oryza species,
using L. tisserantti as outgroup, to test rate constancy.
Sequence data were also analyzed under the RY-coding strategy (A and G = R, C and T = Y), which maintains only transversions and thus efficiently reduces saturations by excluding
more frequently occurring transitions [31,38]. In addition,
the effect of heterotachous signal was explored by implementing a covarion model in BI.
Substitutional saturation of the data set was evaluated by
plotting observed pairwise distance (uncorrected P-distance)
for transitions and transversions against the ML pairwise distances for each pair of taxa. Saturation plots were constructed
for total, exon, intron and third codon positions, respectively.
Second order polynomial regression lines were fitted to all
saturation plots and if the slope of this regression line was
zero or negative, the data were considered saturated [78].
The ILD test [79], a character-based test for homogeneity,
was used to explore the difference in phylogenetic signal
between data partitions. We partitioned the data set by two
schemes: four process partitions including intron and each
codon positions [80]; and 142 gene partitions along gene
boundaries, which may reveal variation in allelic histories
that the concatenated data might obscure [26,76]. Then, we
performed three kinds of ILD tests for each type of partition:
a test among all partitions simultaneously; a test between all
possible pairwise partitions; and a test between single partitions and the rest of the data set combined.

Amount of sequence and phylogenetic resolution
To explore the relationship between the number of genes or
nucleotides in a sample and the probability to infer the species tree in our case, we drew random samples of different
sizes from the original 142-gene data set without replacement
and concatenated each sample for phylogenetic analyses.
When sampling genes, we generated samples consisting of
20, 40, 60, ..., 120 genes each for 500 replicates. Similarly,
samples with randomly sampled sites in a total length of 10,
20, 30, ...100 kb were generated each for 500 replicates. ML
and MP methods were used to determine whether or not the
sampling results were affected by reconstruction methods.
The branch-and-bound search was used in both methods,
with the General Time Reversible (GTR)+Γ model for ML.
The proportion of trees (or clades) identical to that in Figure
1 was calculated as the probability that a correct phylogenetic
hypothesis will be obtained at a specific data size [63].
