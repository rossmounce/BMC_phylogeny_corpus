Abstract
Background: Many fungi are obligate biotrophs of plants, growing in live plant tissues, gaining direct
access to recently photosynthesized carbon. Photosynthate within plants is transported from source to
sink tissues as sucrose, which is hydrolyzed by plant glycosyl hydrolase family 32 enzymes (GH32) into its
constituent monosaccharides to meet plant cellular demands. A number of plant pathogenic fungi also use
GH32 enzymes to access plant-derived sucrose, but less is known about the sucrose utilization ability of
mutualistic and commensal plant biotrophic fungi, such as mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. The aim of
this study was to explore the distribution and abundance of GH32 genes in fungi to understand how
sucrose utilization is structured within and among major ecological guilds and evolutionary lineages. Using
bioinformatic and PCR-based analyses, we tested for GH32 gene presence in all available fungal genomes
and an additional 149 species representing a broad phylogenetic and ecological range of biotrophic fungi.
Results: We detected 9 lineages of GH32 genes in fungi, 4 of which we describe for the first time. GH32
gene number in fungal genomes ranged from 0–12. Ancestral state reconstruction of GH32 gene
abundance showed a strong correlation with nutritional mode, and gene family expansion was observed
in several clades of pathogenic filamentous Ascomycota species. GH32 gene number was negatively
correlated with animal pathogenicity and positively correlated with plant biotrophy, with the notable
exception of mycorrhizal taxa. Few mycorrhizal species were found to have GH32 genes as compared to
other guilds of plant-associated fungi, such as pathogens, endophytes and lichen-forming fungi. GH32 genes
were also more prevalent in the Ascomycota than in the Basidiomycota.
Conclusion: We found a strong signature of both ecological strategy and phylogeny on GH32 gene
number in fungi. These data suggest that plant biotrophic fungi exhibit a wide range of ability to access
plant-synthesized sucrose. Endophytic fungi are more similar to plant pathogens in their possession of
GH32 genes, whereas most genomes of mycorrhizal taxa lack GH32 genes. Reliance on plant GH32
enzyme activity for C acquisition in these symbionts supports earlier predictions of possible plant control
over C allocation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Background
All Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, and the majority of
fungal species rely solely upon plant tissues to meet their
carbon (C) demands. In addition to saprotrophic fungi
that decompose dead plant organic matter to acquire C,
many fungi are biotrophs, forming intimate associations
with living plant tissues. Associations between plants and
biotrophic fungi are ubiquitous in nature; most plants are
colonized from leaf to root with multiple fungal species.
The interactions between biotrophic fungi and their plant
hosts range from mutually beneficial (e.g. mycorrhizal
associations) to context-dependent beneficial interactions
(such as some endophytic fungi), to unilaterally antagonistic, potentially fatal pathogenic interactions.
In vascular plants, photosynthetically-derived C is delivered from source to sink tissues (e.g. roots) via phloem
and sieve elements in the form of the non-reducing disaccharide sucrose [1]. Within plant sink tissues, sucrose is
cleaved by extracellular invertase enzymes into equimolar
concentrations of glucose and fructose. These monosaccharide molecules are then imported into plant cells via
transport proteins and used either to meet cellular energy
demands or as substrates for synthesizing other carbohydrate-containing storage molecules. The amount of
sucrose allocated to various sink tissues is driven in part
by the capacity of sink tissues to store or metabolize the
imported carbohydrates (sink strength) [2]. Thus,
increased invertase enzyme activity and the resultant
decline in sucrose concentrations in sink tissues is intimately tied to phloem unloading and carbon allocation in
the plant [3,4].
Invertase enzymes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 32 (GH32) group of carbohydrate active enzymes,
where family membership is designated based upon
amino acid sequence conservation [5]. GH32 is a polyspecific enzyme family comprised of genes encoding for
invertase (-fructofuranosidase; EC 3.2.1.26) activity, as
well as inulinase (EC 3.2.1.7, EC 3.2.1.64, EC 3.2.1.80),
levanase (EC 3.2.1.65), and particular fructosyltransferase
(EC 2.4.1.99, EC 2.4.1.100) and fructosidase (EC
3.2.1.153, EC 3.2.1.154) activities [6]. GH32 enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of their target carbohydrate substrates, which include – depending upon
the enzyme – sucrose, and various oligo- and polysaccharides such as the fructans levan and inulin. Overall, the
majority of enzymes in the GH32 family are functionally
designated as invertase [7]. Invertase targets the terminal
-2,1 fructosidic bonds found in sucrose, inulin and
levan. Plants typically contain multiple genes encoding
for invertase enzymes, some of which are secreted, and
others which are expressed intracellularly [8]. Invertase
and other GH32 enzymes are not restricted to plants but
are also known from bacteria and fungi [7].

Given the abundance of sucrose in living plant tissues,
possession of functional GH32 genes that facilitate
sucrose utilization would be seemingly advantageous for
plant biotrophic fungi. Fungal GH32 activity could
enhance fungal growth in plant tissues where sucrose concentrations are high, such as in the phloem and the apoplastic spaces of source and sink tissues where phloem
loading and unloading occurs, respectively. However,
sucrose diversion from plants to fungi is clearly disadvantageous to plants if there is no mechanism by which
plants can regulate the timing or amount of C acquired by
their fungal partners. Indeed, sucrolytic activity by fungal
GH32 enzymes has been implicated in the invasive
growth of several plant pathogenic fungi. Uromyces fabae,
a rust fungus infecting Vicia faba, has been shown to specifically up-regulate its invertase expression during the
plant infection process [9]. Infection of Hordeum distichum
leaves by another pathogenic fungal biotroph, Puccinia
hordeii, has been shown to cause a significant reduction in
sucrose and monosaccharide concentrations in the apoplast of these tissues [10]. Thus, GH32 genes have been
documented in several pathogenic fungal biotrophs and
appear to be expressed in order to enhance C metabolism
and access sucrose at infection sites. Given that a large
number of plant-associated fungi are mutualistic (or commensal) rather than pathogenic, the expression of fungal
invertase during some pathogen infection of plant tissues
raises the important question: Do non-pathogenic symbiotic fungi also express invertase in their hosts?
Cultural studies of two fungal species that form mutualistic mycorrhizal associations, Amanita muscaria and Hebeloma crustuliniforme, showed that these species lacked
invertase activity and failed to utilize sucrose as a C source
in the absence of the plant host or host invertase enzyme
[11]. Studies of beech mycorrhizas have also shown that
monosaccharides rather than sucrose were the C compounds taken up by symbiotic fungal cells [12]. These
results have led some investigators to hypothesize that all
mycorrhizal fungi lack both a sucrose uptake system and
the ability to metabolize sucrose via GH32 enzymes, and
that they instead must rely upon the action of plant invertase enzymes to gain access to plant-derived C [13,14]. In
contrast, results from several other studies provide evidence that suggests some mycorrhizal species may possess
invertase [15,16], or may be able to grow on media with
sucrose as a sole carbon source [17,18]. This disparity
between results of different studies in conjunction with
the fact that just a fraction of the phylogenetic and species
diversity of mycorrhizal fungi have been examined for
invertase activity (or sucrolytic abilities) currently limits
our ability to draw general conclusions regarding whether
mycorrhizal fungal genomes encode GH32 genes for
sucrose utilization. Even less is known about these

processes for other non-pathogenic biotrophic fungi, such
as endophytic- and lichen-forming fungi [but see [19]].
To test the role of fungal GH32 genes in determining the
mode of C acquisition and allocation in plant-fungal symbiosis we have investigated the evolution of GH32 genes
throughout the fungi using a phylogenetic approach.
Recent sequencing of over 75 fungal genomes has allowed
us to determine the number of GH32 genes throughout
the fungal kingdom and to trace the evolution of the gene
family as it has evolved through numerous ecological
transitions. Because the genomic data have largely emphasized plant and animal pathogenic fungi, we have also
developed and implemented a PCR-based GH32 screening method for fungi. This approach allowed us to determine GH32 gene presence in obligately biotrophic fungi,
many of which cannot be cultured (e.g., lichens and mycorrhizae, and to fill in the evolutionary and ecological
gaps of the genome sequence data. By reconstructing the
history of GH32 genes throughout fungi we addressed the
following questions: 1) does GH32 gene presence and
abundance positively correlate with a plant pathogenic
ecological strategy; 2) do mycorrhizal, endophytic, and
lichenic fungi typically possess or lack GH32 genes?
Within plant-associated fungi we hypothesize that GH32
gene presence may be negatively correlated with the
degree of mutualism and its presence or absence may
therefore serve as a general marker for the sign of interaction (i.e., mutualistic vs. antagonistic) between a plant
and a fungus.

Results
GH32 Gene phylogeny from fungal genome data
Seventy-six genomes from five fungal phyla were queried
for GH32 gene presence: 9 Basidiomycota, 62 Ascomycota, 2 Zygomycota, 1 Chytridiomycota and 2 microsporidia. Forty-eight fungal genomes contained one or
more GH32 gene sequences for a total of 130 GH32
sequences. The remaining 28 harbored no detectable
GH32 (see Additional file 1). Nine sequences were manually edited to correct putative errors in their protein predictions, and an additional seven sequences were
removed from the dataset entirely, due either to errors that
could not be resolved or to redundancies in sequences
retrieved by BLAST (See Additional file 2). The number of
GH32 genes per genome ranges from 0–12. Fusarium
oxysporum with 12 GH32 genes spanning 8 groups had the
greatest number of genes of all fungi surveyed. It should
be noted that these fungi vary in their degree of genome
sequence coverage and this report of GH32 gene number
must therefore be considered a minimum estimate until
genome sequence efforts are completed.

Phylogenetic analysis of all 123 GH32 sequences from
fungal genomes revealed a total of nine well-supported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/148

clades, four of which are previously unknown from fungi
(Groups 3, 5, 6 and 9; Figure 1). Two sequences do not
nest within any of the well-supported clades: the basidiomycete yeast, Sporobolomyces roseus, which is basal to
group 1, and the Ascomycete grass endophyte, Epichloë festucae, placed sister to group 9. GH32 groups one and eight
are the largest overall, containing 40 (32.5%) and 25
(20.3%) sequences, respectively. Group 1 harbors all of
the Saccharomycetales and Schizosaccharomycetales
sequences, and for this reason was referred to by Yuan et
al. [20] as the yeast invertase clade, though both filamentous Ascomycete and Basidiomycete sequences are also
found in this group. All of the other groups are comprised
entirely of filamentous Ascomycete sequences except for
group 7, which contains Puccinia graminis and Phycomyces
blakesleeanus GH32 sequences, and group 8, which contains one GH32 sequence from the Basidiomycete smut
fungus Ustilago maydis.
Function and subcellular localization of GH32 groups
All genome sequences presented in this study contain
conserved motifs that suggest that they code for functional
enzymes and are supported as being members of the
GH32 gene family (Figure 2) [21]. Gene functions
assigned to this group of carbohydrate active enzymes
include invertase, inulinase, and fructosyl transferase
activities; these enzymes can be expressed either intracellularly or secreted, and in some cases – as has been
reported for the S. cerevisiae GH32 group 1 sequence – the
same gene product may be expressed both intra- and
extracellularly [22]. Groups 1,7 and 8 in the GH32 phylogeny contain sequences with known invertase function.
Groups 2 and 4 sequence members exhibit inulinase
activity and groups 3,5,8 and 9 cannot be assigned a specific function (Figure 1). Subcellular localization analysis
performed using the programs SignalP v.3.0 [23] and
CELLO v. 2.5 [24] concludes that groups 5 and 8 are
expressed intracellularly, and the remaining clades are
largely comprised of secreted enzymes.
Fungal genome ancestral state reconstruction and
phylogenetic independent contrasts
The fungal phylogeny inferred from the six RNA polymerase genes yielded a well-resolved phylogeny with support
for almost all nodes (Figure 3) and is consistent with
recent phylogenetic hypotheses for fungi [25,26]. Ancestral state reconstruction of GH32 gene number across this
fungal genome phylogeny predicted the most recent common ancestor of fungi after the divergence of microsporidia and Chytridiomycota possessed one GH32 gene.
Fourteen independent losses of all GH32 genes were predicted, which included ancestral nodes of many of the lineages containing animal pathogens: microsporidia, the
Onygenales (with the exception of the bee pathogen,
Ascosphaera apis), and the genus Candida. The ancestor of

the Agaricomycetes also is predicted to have lost GH32
genes. In contrast, gene family expansion was reconstructed for nodes leading to clades containing plant pathogens, the Eurotiales, Helotiales and Dothideomycetes.
Significant changes between parent and descendent nodes
in the rate of gene loss and duplication () were detected
on 7 and 12 branches respectively (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic independent contrast analysis complements
the gene family expansion and contraction patterns
observed in the ancestral state reconstruction, which
shows a correlation between GH32 gene family size and
ecological strategy. Both a positive correlation between
GH32 gene number and plant pathogen status, and a neg-

ative correlation between animal pathogen status and
GH32 gene number were statistically supported (Table 1).
However, the result for animal pathogens was only statistically significant when taxa that are primarily saprotrophic and only facultatively pathogenic (Neosartorya
fisheri, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus species)
were not coded as pathogens. Correlation between GH32
gene number and saprotrophic status were positive but
not statistically supported; mycorrhizal and endophytic
fungal genomes are too few (one of each) to conduct a PIC
analysis for these ecological strategies.

sequenced fungal genomes. Shown is a Bayesian consensus phylogeny inferred from RNA polymerase amino acid
sequences, with molecular-clock like maximum likelihood branches calculated using TREE-PUZZLE v.5.3 [47]. All branches
were supported with Bayesian posterior probabilities  0.95 except for the branch supporting the relationship between Saccharomyces mikatae, S. bayanus and S. kudriavzevii. The majority of branches were also supported by maximum likelihood bootstrap
replicate frequencies  70%, those that were not supported are indicated with asterisk (*) symbols. Ancestral state reconstruction of GH32 gene number was computed from the clock-corrected phylogeny using the program CAFE v.2.0 [48]. Color of
branches represents the predicted GH32 gene number for each ancestral node. GH32 gene numbers in extant taxa are shown
in the colored circle to the right of the terminal branch of each species in the phylogeny. Ecological strategies of taxa are also
illustrated to the right of each terminal branch (see figure legend for description of symbols corresponding to ecology). Arrows
indicate branches for which the rate of gene gain (upward arrow) or gene loss (downward arrow) is significantly different.

GH32 gene distribution in experimentally assayed fungi
Given that plant symbiotic fungi are underrepresented in
complete genome sequences, we used degenerate primers
to examine the distribution of GH32 genes in a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse suite of symbiotic fungi,
with a particular emphasis on mycorrhizal and Basidiomycete taxa. We successfully obtained GH32 sequences
for taxa that had previously been reported to exhibit invertase activity, Schizophyllum commune [27], Pycnoporus cinnabarinus [28] and Rhizoscyphus ericae [16], as well as for
taxa chosen as positive controls, giving us reasonable confidence in the utility of this approach and the primers we
designed for this purpose. A total of 149 fungal taxa were
tested in total: 7 lichenic, 9 endophytic, 51 mycorrhizal
fungi, 13 plant pathogens, 1 animal pathogen and 57
saprotrophs (Table 2). Several additional taxa tested have
multiple possible ecological strategies, 5 saprotroph/
endophytic, 4 saprotroph/plant pathogen, and 2 endophytic/mycorrhizal. Overall, we detected GH32 genes in
39 (26.2%) of the 149 fungal taxa that were assayed, and
in all but one case (2 sequences detected in Rhizoscyphus
ericae), only one GH32 gene sequence was recovered (See
Additional file 3). The majority of the sequences that we
detected are members of the GH32 group 1 subfamily,
although a small number of sequences belong to GH32
groups 5,6,8 and 9.

Both phylogeny and ecological strategy are important predictors of GH32 presence. Overall, GH32 sequences were
detected with significantly greater frequency in Ascomycete taxa (22/46 = 48%) than in Basidiomycete taxa (17/
103 = 17%) (one-tailed Fisher's exact test: probability
Ascomycota GH32 presence greater than Basidiomycota:
p < 0.001). Similar to the results found with fungal
genome data, the animal pathogen taxa did not possess
GH32 genes, while they were found in plant pathogens,
though at a lower detection frequency than the genome

data (5/13 = 38.4% PCR assay results vs. 100% detection
in fungal genome data). GH32 genes were detected in the
majority of endophytic fungi (7/9 = 77.8%), and in nearly
half of the lichenic fungi (3/7 = 42.9%) as well as many
saprotrophs (19/57 = 33.3%). In contrast, of the 51 mycorrhizal and 2 mycorrhizal/endophytic fungal taxa surveyed, GH32 genes were detected in only 5 species:
Sebacina incrustans, Elaphomyces cf. verruculosus, Rhizoscyphus ericae, Meliniomyces bicolor and Phialophora finlandica,
of which only one (S. incrustans) is a member of the phylum Basidiomycota (Class Agaricomycetes), and the rest
are Ascomycota species. While only one mycorrhizal Agaricomycetes species possessed a GH32 gene, a number of
the saprotrophic Agaricomycetes taxa tested positive for
GH32 gene presence, suggesting that the paucity of GH32
genes found in mycorrhizal Agaricomycetes is not due to
the wholesale absence of the gene family in this clade.
The Bayesian GH32 group 1 phylogeny inferred from
nucleotide sequence data demonstrated the placement of
the new GH32 sequences acquired by PCR and sequencing among those retrieved from fungal genomes. A
number of sequences were too short to include in the
analysis, and the relatively short length of the sequenced
fragments overall is likely responsible for the lack of statistical support for a number of branches (Figure 4). The
GH32 group 1 gene phylogeny is markedly different than
the species phylogeny. For example, Basidiomycota
sequences are found in five separate positions in the phylogeny, each nested within Ascomycota. The Polyporalesderived sequences form a clade, but the multiple
sequences from Russulales (Stereum and Peniophora) do
not form a clade. Cryptococcus neoformans groups sister to
Lophodermium piceae within a clade of filamentous Ascomycota (Figures 1 &3), although posterior probabilities
and maximum likelihood bootstrap support for the place-

Discussion
Sucrose is the primary compound used by most plants to
transport carbon throughout their tissues, and its abundance within plants makes it a valuable carbon source for
the many fungi that are obligate plant associates. In order
to directly utilize sucrose, fungi must possess the necessary enzymes to cleave sucrose into its constituent monosaccharides. The aim of this study was to explore the
distribution and abundance of GH32 genes that encode
for sucrolytic activity in fungi in order to understand how

the potential for sucrose utilization is structured within
and among major ecological guilds and evolutionary lineages. Using a combination of bioinformatics and PCRbased assays targeting the breadth of fungal phylogenetic
and ecological diversity, we detected a total of nine wellsupported subfamilies of fungal GH32 genes. The number
of GH32 genes recovered from an individual species
ranged from 0–12, with a mean value of 1.62 and 0.27
copies per taxon detected in the genome and experimental
surveys, respectively. Two of the nine GH32 groups found
in fungi contained the majority of the sequences: group 1,
a secreted invertase enzyme, and group 8, an intracellular
enzyme of putative invertase function [20]. PIC analysis

of the fungal genome data showed GH32 gene abundance
was significantly correlated with ecological strategy.
GH32 abundance was negatively correlated with animal
pathogenic fungi and positively correlated with plant biotrophic fungi – plant pathogens, endophytic and lichenic
fungi – with the notable exception of mycorrhizal fungal
taxa. Few mycorrhizal fungal species were found to have
GH32 genes when compared to other plant-associated
fungi, only one of which belonged to the phylum Basidiomycota. We also observed a phylogenetic signal in GH32
distribution among fungi, with greater GH32 gene prevalence found in the Ascomycota than in the Basidiomycota.
In the following paragraphs we will consider the significance of GH32 distribution and abundance patterns for
the evolutionary history of this gene family in fungi, the
functional diversity both within and between ecological
guilds of fungi, and its relevance for the sign and strength
of ecological outcomes in plant-fungal interactions.
Functional diversity within and among fungal ecological
guilds
Ecological strategy was an important predictor of both the
presence and abundance of GH32 genes. At the coarsest
level, there is a distinct difference in GH32 distribution
between animal and plant-associated fungi, with the
former generally lacking, and the latter generally possessing GH32 genes. It is logical that animal associates would
lack sucrolytic capabilities because sucrose is neither synthesized by animals nor is it stored in their tissues. One
notable exception is the presence of GH32 genes in
Ascosphaera apis, the causal agent of chalkbrood disease of
honeybees, which can grow in the sucrose-rich environment of honeycombs and infects developing honeybee
larvae [29]. A more refined view of plant-associated fungi
also reveals distinctions among different ecological strategies within this more general classification. We detected
GH32 genes in all plant pathogens for which whole
genome sequences were available, and in 38% of those
surveyed by PCR. They were also found in the majority
(78%) of endophytic fungi and a number (43%) of
lichen-forming fungi (Table 2). GH32 genes were not
only present in all plant pathogen genome sequences, but
GH32 gene family size was also found to be expanding in
this group, a pattern that has been shown for many gene
families in plant pathogenic Ascomycota genomes [30].
In contrast, GH32 genes were absent in the only currently
completed mycorrhizal fungal genome, Laccaria bicolor
[31], and in the vast majority of the mycorrhizal taxa that
we tested experimentally, particularly those belonging to
the Basidiomycota.

While general trends were identified among ecological
guilds of fungi, variation within guilds was also detected,
highlighting potential functional diversity in C acquisition strategies harbored within an ecological guild, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/148

plasticity of ecological strategy within individual taxa
depending upon host identity or environmental conditions. Although GH32 genes were rare in mycorrhizal
fungi, they were not entirely absent. We found putatively
functional GH32 gene copies in 5 of the 53 mycorrhizal
taxa tested (9.4%): Four of the five taxa contained at least
one gene copy from the secreted invertase group (GH32
group 1; Figure 1); E. cf. verruculosus contained a copy
from GH32 group 8, an intracellularly-expressed putative
invertase, and R. ericae contained both a GH32 group 1
gene and a second GH32 gene from group 5, an intracellularly-expressed gene of uncertain function. While gene
presence is not equivalent with enzyme activity, the presence of conserved motifs in these sequences, combined
with data from pure culture studies documenting invertase activity in R. ericae [16], provide good evidence that
sucrose utilization facilitated by invertase activity is possible for this subset of mycorrhizal taxa. Several of these
species are also plastic in their ecological strategies, forming ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal and endophytic
associations (M. bicolor, P. finlandica). If these GH32 genes
are functional in these species, what is the timing and
location of their expression? Are they expressed within
symbiotic tissues to increase C acquisition, and are they
expressed during each of the possible ecological strategies? In the case of E. cf. verruculosus and R. ericae, which
possess intracellular GH32 genes, do these taxa possess
sucrose import systems? These remain open questions,
but answering them will provide additional insight into
the functional similarities and differences in C interactions among different plant-fungal symbioses, and could
expand our model of C transfer in the ectomycorrhizal
symbiosis, which currently assumes sucrose import by
fungi is not possible, and that sucrose hydrolysis is carried
out solely by the plant partner [32,33].
For species with uncertain or variable ecologies, GH32
gene presence may serve as an indicator of potential endophytic ability or biotrophic growth, as illustrated by the
"wood-decay" species found to possess GH32 genes
(Figure 4). While commonly thought of as saprotrophic,
the wood decay fungi Schizophyllum commune, Pycnoporus
spp., and several Polyporales species that tested positive
for GH32 presence can also grow endophytically inside
attached limbs of temperate oak trees [34], and stems of
Theobroma cacao [35,36] and Elaeis guineensis [36]. Other
endophyte surveys have also cultured members of the
Basidiomycota from woody tissues such as the inner bark
[35], and from conifer fine roots, which in some cases can
exhibit a growth pattern and mantle morphology similar
to that of ectomycorrhizal fungi [37]. Phloem-containing
tissues may select for those wood-decaying endophytes
that can metabolize both cellulose and sucrose, and
GH32 activity may play an important role in facilitating

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:148

the establishment of these early-successional wood-decay
fungi.
Evolutionary history of GH32 genes in the Basidiomycota
Ancestral state reconstruction of GH32 gene numbers
across the fungal genome phylogeny predicts 14 separate
losses of GH32 genes. Many of these losses are at nodes
leading to terminal taxa that are obligate animal pathogens, but complete GH32 gene loss is also predicted for
the most recent common ancestor of the Agaricomycete
lineage (Figure 3). Using PCR assays we detected GH32
genes in only one of the 46 mycorrhizal Agaricomycetes
taxa tested, Sebacina incrustans, which is a member of the
order Sebacinales, the most basal clade of Agaricomycetes
[38]. GH32 genes were also less commonly detected in
non-mycorrhizal Agaricomycetes than in Ascomycota
taxa, though they were not entirely absent. GH32 genes
were detected in 30% (16 of 54 surveyed) of non-mycorrhizal Agaricomycetes belonging to four orders: Agaricales, Auriculariales, Polyporales and Russulales. These
species were either saprotrophs, particularly those
thought to be associated with wood decay, such as Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Fomitopsis pinicola and the three Peniophora species, or plant pathogens, such as Exidia pithya.
GH32 sequences from these Basidiomycota classes did
not form a monophyletic group in the GH32 group 1 phylogeny, and instead exhibited a punctate distribution
across the gene phylogeny, possibly due to the difficulty of
reconstructing the phylogeny because of the small size of
the sequenced fragment or due to multiple independent
gains by horizontal transfer. Regardless of the mechanism,
the possession of GH32 genes in the genome of Agaricomycetes is a rapidly evolving trait.
Comparisons between experimental data and genome
data
One caveat to this research is that with incomplete
genome sequence data and degenerate PCR-based assays,
the estimates of GH32 gene number are merely lower estimates; additional copies may exist that were not detected.
In the case of the genome data, although we only included
genomes that had been sequenced to a reasonable level of
coverage, until sequencing is complete it is possible that
the actual number of GH32 genes in these genomes may
differ from what we report here. When we compare the
frequency of GH32 gene presence between the genome
and experimental data separately for the Ascomycota and
Basidiomycota data, we find that the frequency of GH32
gene occurrence is lower in the experimental data than in
the genome data, though these differences are not statistically significant (one-tailed Fisher's exact test, probability
genome greater than experimental Ascomycota p =
0.1018; probability genome greater than experimental for
Basidiomycota p = 0.0697). This result is likely due to the
fact that PCR-based assays will suffer from false negatives

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/148

due to PCR bias, and this approach will never yield as
complete of a picture as the entire genome data will, even
in cases where care has been taken to design and test many
degenerate primer pairs. In order to maximize gene detection, primers were anchored in conserved gene regions,
tailored to specific GH32 genes and phylogenetic groups,
and tested extensively in all possible combinations. Those
primer pairs ultimately chosen worked successfully across
a wide range of taxa, and we were able to amplify the
genes in taxa for which invertase enzyme activity had previously been reported, such as Schizophyllum commune
[27] and Rhizoscyphus ericae [16]. Nonetheless, PCR-bias
likely explains why fewer gene copies were detected relative to the genome data, particularly for GH32 gene copies
outside of group 1. However, in light of this limitation,
there are a number of additional lines of evidence that
give us confidence in our interpretation of the results with
respect to the implications for fungal ecology.
Comparisons between the genome data and the experimental data show the same patterns of GH32 gene frequency among phylogenetic groups and ecological guilds.
For example, statistical analysis of the Ascomycota
genome data reveals significant differences in GH32 presence among ecological strategies, such that GH32 occurrence is greatest in plant pathogens, lowest in animal
pathogens and intermediate in saprotrophs (ChiSquare
likelihood ratio test = 24.464, p < 0.001). This pattern is
mirrored in the experimental data (the greatest GH32
gene occurrence in Ascomycota was found in plant pathogens, the lowest in animal pathogens and intermediate in
saprotrophs), though this result lacks statistical significance. Similarly, both the genome data and the experimental data show that there is lower GH32 occurrence in
the Basidiomycota taxa relative to Ascomycota taxa,
though this result is statistically significant only in the
experimental data. Taken together, our ability to detect
GH32 presence in taxa which have been determined to
possess invertase activity, as well as the consistency in the
patterns between the genome data and experimental data
give us confidence in our evaluation of GH32 gene
presence in ecological guilds for which genome data are
currently unavailable or extremely sparse, such as for mycorrhizal fungi in the Agaricomycetes, and lichenic and
endophytic fungi in the Ascomycota.

Conclusion
This study analyzed the distribution of GH32 genes from
fungi to determine if there is a relationship between sucrolytic capability and ecological niche in plant symbiotic
fungi. A strong signature of both ecological strategy and
species phylogeny on GH32 gene number was determined
based on data mining of complete genomes. Extensive
gene duplications of GH32 are observed in several groups
of filamentous Ascomycota such as Fusarium and Aspergil-

lus. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that expansions
of GH32 genes coincided with switches to a plant pathogenic habitat, and conversely loss of all GH32 genes was
observed on branches leading to nearly all animal pathogens. Experimental results using PCR targeting GH32
homologues from a diversity of plant-associated fungi
found GH32 genes in the secreted subfamily 1 to be the
most phylogenetically widespread.
We report for the first time the sequences of GH32 genes
from endophytic, lichenic, and mycorrhizal fungi, highlighting the potential for functional diversity within these
ecological guilds. GH32 genes were almost entirely absent
among the large number of Basidiomycota ectomycorhizal fungal species tested (1 out of 46). Reliance on
plant GH32 enzyme activity for C acquisition in these
symbionts supports earlier predictions of a general
absence of invertase in mycorrhizal fungi [11], and a
highly evolved mutualistic relationship between plants
and mycorrhizal fungi [17], a remarkable scenario in light
of the high degree of phylogenetic diversity spanned by
mycorrhizal fungal taxa. Whether the plant host is able to
detect fungal invertase activity and use such a signal to differentiate antagonistic from mutualistic biotrophic symbionts is a completely speculative, though plausible
hypothesis. Additional experiments using gene disruption
mutants to investigate plant response to fungal GH32
expressed in symbiotic tissues will be an important step in
clarifying the role fungal GH32 genes play in a plant's
ability to distinguish friend from foe.

Methods
Database Searches
An initial database search was performed using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GH32 amino acid sequence (GenBank accession number CAF29076) and all fungal
sequences were obtained that showed significant homology (significance score of e-5 or lower) to the GH32 query
gene. A preliminary phylogeny was generated, and the
resulting phylogeny was compared to that reported in
[20] to confirm that all of the unique clades of fungal
GH32 genes that have been identified to date were represented. From this initial search eight sequences were
selected that spanned the fungal GH32 gene phylogeny
(query sequences and accession/gene model numbers: S.
cerevisiae,
CAF29076;
Fusarium
verticillioides,
FVEG10083.3, FVEG10082.3; Botryotinia fuckeliana,
BCIG16010.1; Aspergillus terreus, XP001215038; Stagonospora nodorum, SNOG01192.1; Sporobolomyces roseus
11505; Neurospora crassa, EAA32020), and used as query
sequences to retrieve homologous sequences from all fungal genome databases available as of 1 May, 2008, using
either blastp or tblastn [39] search algorithms. Three Bacillus subtilis and two Escherichia coli bacterial sequences with
significant sequence homology to the query sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/148

were also identified and included in the analysis. All fungal taxa and databases queried in this study are listed in
Additional file 1.
When predicted gene models were unavailable, they were
manually predicted by removal of introns and three-frame
translation. In cases where proteins were incorrectly predicted, or where sequences were truncated because they
spanned multiple contigs, full-length sequences were
reconstructed and manually annotated. A small number
of sequences that showed significant homology to the
query sequences were either unalignable, contained
model prediction errors that could not be confidently corrected, or possessed multiple model predictions, and were
therefore removed from the dataset prior to analysis (indicated in Additional file 2).
In order to estimate a fungal phylogeny of the taxa for
which complete genome sequencing has been accomplished, RNA polymerase (RP) genes were retrieved from
available fungal genomes, the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana by blast using
the six Saccharomyces cerevisiae RP genes (RPA1, RPA2,
RPB1, RPB2, RPC1, and RPC2) as query sequences (GenBank Accession nos. P10964.2, P22138.1, P04050.2,
P08518.2, P04051.1, P22276.2). Additional file 4 lists
accession numbers for all RP genes.
Molecular Methods
Due to the uneven distribution of currently available fungal genomes across the phylogenetic and ecological diversity of fungi, and because many symbiotic taxa are
difficult to culture, we used a PCR-sequencing approach
to detect GH32 gene presence and evaluate correlations
between phylogeny, ecology and GH32 distribution. A
suite of degenerate primers was designed to target each
unique clade of the GH32 gene phylogeny inferred from
the fungal genome data (primer sequences are listed in
Table 3). A phylogenetically diverse set of fungi containing multiple representatives of the major fungal ecological
strategies – saprotrophs, mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic
fungi, lichenic fungi, plant pathogens and animal pathogens – were obtained as either cultures, vouchered fruiting
body specimens, or DNA extracts and are listed in Additional file 3. Cultures were grown in Petri dishes containing either MMN, MEA or PDA media, depending on
species-specific requirements, at 24°C in the dark, atop a
thin layer of cellophane. Mycelia was harvested from the
cellophane surface and stored in 2× CTAB at -20°C pending DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from fruiting bodies or fungal mycelia using the protocol of Vilgalys and
Hester [40]. Culture identity was confirmed by sequencing the ITS rRNA gene region.

Primer pair combinations and PCR conditions that correspond to a particular GH32 sequence are given in Additional file 3. Tm, melting
temperature.

PCR amplification of GH32 genes was performed in 25 l
reactions with approximately 10 ng of template DNA,
using 0.875 units Thermo Red Taq DNA polymerase with
the supplied PCR buffer S (Saveen & Werner) under the
following conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 7
minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 45–56°C
for 30 s depending upon the primer set used (see Table 3
for primer pair-specific annealing temperatures), 72°C for
60 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products containing multiple bands, of which at least one was
the expected size for the primer set used, were ligated into
the PCR 2.1-TOPO vector and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli strain TOP 10 cells according to manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Eight colonies from each cloning reaction were
screened by PCR and 1–3 fragments of the appropriate
size were purified using QIAaquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen, GmbH, Germany), sequenced using Big Dye
chemistry v. 3.1 and visualized on an ABI3730 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For PCR
products that yielded a single band of the expected size,
cloning was omitted and products were purified and
directly sequenced. All GH32 sequences generated by PCR
have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers
GQ277570–GQ277609.

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
GH32 and RP amino acid sequences from fungal genome
data, and the GH32 group 1 nucleotide sequences from
genome and experimental data, were initially aligned
using MUSCLE [41], and the resulting alignments were
manually edited. Ambiguous or unalignable sequence
regions were excluded from the analyses. Amino acid
alignments were analyzed using ProtTest v. 1.4 software
[42] and the GH32 group 1 nucleotide alignment was
analyzed with MrModeltest v2.3 [43] using the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) to select the best-fitting
model of evolution for each dataset.

Phylogenies were estimated using MrBayes version 3.1.2
[44]. The GH32 and RP protein datasets were both analyzed using two independent runs of 10 × 106 and 2 × 106
generations of four chains, respectively, each with the
WAG amino acid model, gamma distributed substitution
rates across variable sites and an estimated proportion of
invariant sites. Trees sampled in the first 1 × 106 generations were discarded (burn-in) and the remaining trees
were used to compute the consensus of the sampled trees,
the posterior probabilities of clades, and average branch
lengths. Bayesian analysis of the GH32 Group 1 nucleotide dataset was conducted with two independent runs
for 2.5 × 106 generations with four chains, an initial burnPage 13 of 16

in of 1 × 106 generations using the GTR nucleotide model,
gamma distributed substitution rates and an estimated
proportion of invariant sites. Run convergence was
assessed by plotting ln L using the software program
Tracer v1.4 [45]. Support for nodes was also assessed for
all datasets using maximum likelihood bootstrap (1000
replicates) as implemented in PHYML [46]. Molecular
clock-like maximum likelihood branch lengths were also
calculated for the RP Bayesian consensus phylogeny using
TREE-PUZZLE v.5.3 [47], for subsequent use in the ancestral state reconstruction analyses.
Fungal genome ancestral state reconstruction and
phylogenetically independent contrasts
Reconstruction of ancestral GH32 gene copy number for
the fungal genome phylogeny was conducted with the
program CAFE v.2.0 [48] using the Bayesian consensus RP
phylogeny with clock-like maximum likelihood branch
lengths and the number of GH32 genes as input. CAFE
models gene gain and loss across a given phylogeny as a
stochastic birth and death process governed by a rate
parameter () that is allowed to evolve across the phylogeny. CAFE also calculates the maximum likelihood solution for the number of gene copies at ancestral nodes and
tests for significant changes in  using Monte Carlo resampling.

Phylogenetic independent contrast (PIC) analysis was
used to test for correlations between ecology and GH32
distribution across the fungal genome phylogeny using
the program Phylocom v.4.0.1b [49]. However, PIC as
implemented in Phylocom and similar programs cannot
analyze a multistate unordered categorical variable such
as the ecological strategy variable in this dataset. To overcome this limitation, the ecological strategies were treated
as binary data, and comparisons were then made between
the continuous data (GH32 gene number) and the binary
trait of each ecological strategy (e.g., plant pathogen or
not). This analysis was then repeated for each of the ecological strategies coded in the dataset. To deal with taxa
with ambiguous ecological strategies or those that could
be coded in multiple ways, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which can cause disease in immune-compromised
patients (animal pathogen coding), but exists in nature
primarily as a saprotroph (saprotroph coding), analyses
were repeated with these taxa coded as one state or
another, to examine the influence of their coding on the
outcome of the analyses. For each PIC analysis, one sample, two-tailed t-tests were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the average magnitude of
independent contrasts across all contrasts, where sample
size (N) used in the statistical analysis is the number of
contrasts.
