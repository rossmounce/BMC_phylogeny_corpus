Karyopherin a7 (KPNA7), a divergent member of
the importin a family of nuclear import receptors
Joshua B Kelley1, Ashley M Talley1, Adam Spencer1, Daniel Gioeli2, Bryce M Paschal1,3*

Abstract
Background: Classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) dependent nuclear import is carried out by a heterodimer
of importin a and importin b. NLS cargo is recognized by importin a, which is bound by importin b. Importin b
mediates translocation of the complex through the central channel of the nuclear pore, and upon reaching the
nucleus, RanGTP binding to importin b triggers disassembly of the complex. To date, six importin a family
members, encoded by separate genes, have been described in humans.
Results: We sequenced and characterized a seventh member of the importin a family of transport factors,
karyopherin a 7 (KPNA7), which is most closely related to KPNA2. The domain of KPNA7 that binds Importin b (IBB)
is divergent, and shows stronger binding to importin b than the IBB domains from of other importin a family
members. With regard to NLS recognition, KPNA7 binds to the retinoblastoma (RB) NLS to a similar degree as
KPNA2, but it fails to bind the SV40-NLS and the human nucleoplasmin (NPM) NLS. KPNA7 shows a predominantly
nuclear distribution under steady state conditions, which contrasts with KPNA2 which is primarily cytoplasmic.
Conclusion: KPNA7 is a novel importin a family member in humans that belongs to the importin a2 subfamily.
KPNA7 shows different subcellular localization and NLS binding characteristics compared to other members of the
importin a family. These properties suggest that KPNA7 could be specialized for interactions with select NLScontaining proteins, potentially impacting developmental regulation.

Background
Eukaryotic cells are defined by the separation of DNA
from the rest of the cell by the nuclear envelope, a double bilayer made selectively permeable by Nuclear Pore
Complexes (NPC) [1]. Transport of proteins between
the nucleus and the cytoplasm is carried out by karyopherins, a family of proteins made up of importins and
exportins [2,3]. Classical nuclear localization signal
(NLS) dependent nuclear import is carried out by
importin a and importin b Importin a family members
bind NLS cargo, and bind to importin b through an Nterminal importin b binding domain (IBB). Importin b
mediates translocation of the NLS-Importin a-Importin
b import complex into the nucleus through direct interactions with the NPC. Once in the nucleus, RanGTP
binds to importin b and induces dissociation of the
import complex [4]. Exportin mediated nuclear export is

regulated by RanGTP through a related mechanism.
Whereas RanGTP dissociates import complexes by
binding importins, exportins must bind to RanGTP in
order to bind nuclear export signal (NES) containing
cargoes [5]. The heterotrimeric export complex then
translocates through the NPC and is dissociated in the
cytoplasm by RanGAP stimulated conversion of
RanGTP to RanGDP.
While there are at least 10 importin b family members
which can bind directly to cargo and mediate import [4],
importin b is unique in its ability to bind the importin a
family of nuclear transport receptors (also called karyopherin a) [2,3]. Importin a binds to two major classes
of NLS, both characterized by basic amino acids; a
monopartite NLS, such as the SV40 NLS, which consists
of a single cluster of basic amino acids; and a bipartite
NLS, such as the retinoblastoma (RB) NLS, which consists of two clusters of basic amino acids, separated by a
~10 residue spacer [6]. The architecture of importin a
proteins is composed of Armadillo (ARM) repeats, a
three a-helix motif named for the D. melanogaster

homologue of b catenin [7]. The binding site for a
monopartite NLS is located between the 2 nd and 4 th
ARM repeats and is called the major site [8]. Importin
a binds to the C-terminus of bipartite NLS sequences
with the major site and to the N-terminal element of
the bipartite NLS using a smaller site created by the 7th
and 8th ARM repeats called the minor site [8-10]. The
accessibility of these NLS binding sites is regulated by
an autoinhibitory mechanism. The IBB of importin a
contains basic amino acids that bind to the NLS binding
surface when the receptor is in an autoinhibited state
[11-14]. Importin a binding to NLS cargo and to importin b is, therefore, a cooperative process because importin b binding to the IBB relieves the autoinhibition of
importin a. Relief of autoinhibition facilitates Importin
a binding to NLS cargo. After nuclear import, the complex is dissociated by the cooperative effects of RanGTP
binding to importin b, and binding of importin a to
CAS [15]. CAS is an exportin which forms a trimeric
complex consisting of CAS, RanGTP and importin a,
and is responsible for recycling importin a to the cytoplasm [16].
Yeasts encode a single importin a, but higher eukaryotes encode three importin a subfamilies, designated
importin a1, a2, and a3. There are six previously
described human importin a forms, each encoded by
different gene. Importin a family members show preferences for specific types of NLS cargo [17-20], although
there is also some functional redundancy. Most NLSs
are very similar in sequence leading to the suggestion
that importin a specificity is conferred by the protein
context of the NLS imparted by the cargo [21]. It
appears that additional importin a proteins are required
for a multicellular organism because different importin
a’s have specific cargoes to import during differentiation
[22]. Studies in D. melanogaster have shown that importin a2 is not required in adult flies, but is required for
oogenesis [23] and that importin a3 is favored for a
step in larval development [24]. Similarly, it has been
shown in C. elegans that while importin a3 is ubiquitously expressed, a1 and a2 are expressed only in the
germline, and are not sufficient to replace a3 in somatic
cells [25]. In mouse embryonic stem cells, switching
from importin a1 (KPNA2) expression to importin a5
(KPNA1) expression has been shown to induce neural
differentiation [26]. These data suggest that cargo interactions with specific importin a isotypes are important
for controlling differentiation pathways.
Here we describe a novel importin a in humans, the
seventh member of the importin a family, which we
term karyopherin alpha 7 (KPNA7). This new a family
member is most similar to KPNA2 and a member of the
a2 subfamily. We show that KPNA7 binds to importin
b through an N-terminal IBB, but that its importin b

binding affinity appears to be much higher than that of
the other KPNAs. KPNA7 localization is predominantly
nuclear in HeLa cells, highlighting another difference
between 7 and the other importin a family members.

Results
KPNA7 is a novel member of the Importin Alpha family

There are six known members of the human importin a
family. We used BLAST to query the human genome
with the importin a family member KPNA2, and
retrieved a sequence predicted to encode a seventh
member of the importin a family. Because the sequence
of the putative importin a was generated by gene prediction, we set out to experimentally validate the expression and function of the predicted importin a gene
[GenBank:XM_376655] as an importin a. Using RTPCR, we amplified a product of the expected size from
RNA prepared from the prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP. We sequenced the cDNA [Genbank:EU126604],
and found that it matched that of the predicted gene,
leading us to conclude that the gene is transcribed in
human cells. This gene is the seventh member of the
importin a family of transport receptors, therefore we
named it karyopherin alpha 7 (KPNA7). The complete
human importin a family (KPNA1-7) is shown in Table
1 with their previous designations, as well as accession
and Gene ID numbers. Alignment of the KPNA7 protein sequence with KPNA’s 1-6 using ClustalW (Fig 1)
reveals that KPNA7 is 54.7% identical to its closest
importin a family member, the prototypical KPNA2
(Rch1). The maximum identity between KPNA7 and
members of the a1 and a3 subfamilies is only 43.7%
(Table 2). KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6 share a minimum of 80.7% identity, while KPNA3 and KPNA4 are
85.8% identical, emphasizing that KPNA7 is highly

multiple alignment (Fig. 1) shows, however, that KPNA7
is related to other importin a family members throughout the length of the protein, suggesting that it is an
NLS binding protein.
KPNA7 homologues are found in vertebrates including mouse (62.1% identity, NP_001013796.2), xenopus
(59.6% identity, NP_001081744.1) and zebra fish (51.9%
identity, NP_998235.1). In all animals, importin a proteins are classified into 3 subfamilies, a1, a2, and a3
[23,27]. While vertebrates have seven importin a family
members, invertebrates such as Drosophila have only 3

human importin a family. The sole S. cerevisiae importin a, SRP1 (Yeast KPNA), is included as a common ancestor. D. melanogaster contains one
member each of the a1, a2, and a3 subfamilies, which are included (Fly KPNA) to define the subfamilies. The phylogenetic trees labeled ARM
repeats and IBB were generated using either the ARM repeat or IBB domains of all 7 human KPNA proteins. (B) Comparison of the divergence of

importin a proteins, one for each subfamily. We created
a phylogenetic tree of the complete human importin a
family using Protdist (Fig. 2A). The Drosophila melanogaster importin a proteins were included in the phylogram (Fig 2A) to help define each subfamily. We
included the sole S. cerevisiae importin a, SRP1, in the
tree to illustrate the relationships of the human KPNA
proteins to a common ancestor. The phylogenetic tree
shows that KPNA7 is a member of the a2 subfamily.

The alignment of KPNA7 with KPNA’s 1-6 (Fig 1)
revealed that the IBB of KPNA7 has a region of low
identity to the consensus. Separate phylogenetic analysis
of the ARM repeats and IBB of the KPNAs show that
the KPNA7 IBB is more divergent than the body of
KPNA7 (Fig. 2B,C), as the branch length separating the
KPNA7 IBB from S. cerevisiae importin a is longer than
the branch length to the KPNA7 body. The a1 subfamily has the least divergent body, while the IBBs of this

Kelley et al. BMC Cell Biology 2010, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/11/63

subfamily are almost as divergent as the KPNA7 IBB.
KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4 show the same branch
lengths for both their bodies and IBB’s, suggesting they
evolved at the same rate. KPNA7 has an N-terminal
domain which is 48% identical to the KPNA2 IBB, and
only 24% identical to the KPNA5 IBB. The strong difference in the IBB of KPNA7 from all other KPNAs suggests that the KPNA7 IBB is has diverged in response to
different selective pressures.
The N-terminus of KPNA7 is a functional IBB

Importin a proteins act as adaptors for nuclear import
by binding both NLS cargo and importin b. Importin a
binding to importin b is mediated by the N terminal
IBB domain, making possible the a/b heterodimer capable of carrying NLS cargo into the nucleus. The low
sequence identity of the KPNA7 IBB with other KPNA
IBB domains could be indicative of changes in function,
and so we tested whether the N-terminus of KPNA7
acts as an IBB. We examined KPNA7 binding to importin b by immobilizing GST-importin b on glutathione
beads, and incubating the beads with in vitro translated,
35
S-Methionine labeled KPNA proteins (Fig 3A). Surprisingly, KPNA7 displayed the most stable binding to
the GST-Importin b. A longer exposure of the film
reveals a low level of KPNA1-6 binding to importin b.
Because the autoinhibited state and importin b binding
are mutually exclusive, the low level of KPNA1-6 binding to importin b likely reflects the stability of the autoinhibited state of these proteins. In order to confirm
that the b binding of KPNA7 is conferred by its IBB
region, we performed a GST pulldown assay using in
vitro translated, 35 S-Methionine labeled proteins;
KPNA7, and a mutant KPNA7 in which the putative
IBB had been removed (KPNA7ΔIBB). Deletion of the
KPNA7 IBB resulted in complete loss of KPNA7 binding to importin b (Fig 3B).
Because reticulocyte lystate contains proteins (including transport factors) that might influence the outcome
of these binding assays, we used recombinant proteins
to formally test whether the N-terminus of KPNA7
functions as an IBB. GST fusions of the IBB domains
from KPNA2 and KPNA7 were immobilized on glutathione beads, recombinant importin b was added, and
bound fractions analyzed by immunoblotting. Importin
b bound to the IBB domains of both KPNA2 and
KPNA7; the interactions were Ran-sensitive because
they were reduced significantly by including RanQ69L
(preloaded with GTP) in the binding reaction (Fig. 3C,
first two lanes). We also found that preformed complexes of importin b with IBB domains of KPNA2 and
KPNA7 were dissociated by addition of RanGTP (Fig.
3C), a reaction that mimics Ran-dependent disassembly
of import complexes. Based on semi-quantitative

Page 5 of 12

immunoblotting, RanGTP addition resulted in dissociation of 60% of the preformed importin b-KPNA2 complexes but only 3% of the preformed importin bKPNA7 complexes. This result, together with data
showing that full-length KPNA7 binds efficiently to
importin b (Fig. 2A), suggests that KPNA7 import complexes could be more stable than complexes formed
between importin b and other KPNA proteins.
The competitive autoinhibition of NLS binding by the
IBB may be altered by changes in the IBB affinity for
importin a. Thus we decided to test whether the
KPNA7ΔIBB would show enhanced binding to the
SV40-NLS compared to full length KPNA7. Unexpectedly, neither full length nor IBB deletion forms of
KPNA7 display significant levels of binding to the SV40
NLS (Fig 3D). The difference in SV40 NLS binding affinities between KPNA1 or KPNA 2 and KPNA7 suggests
that there may be a difference in their NLS binding
surfaces.
Crystal structures have been solved for several importin a proteins, yeast SRP1 [8], mouse and human
KPNA2 [13,28], and human KPNA1 [29]. The network
of amino acids that create the NLS binding surface have
been described in detail for the SV40 NLS, RB NLS, and
nucleoplasmin (NPM) NLS, among others [8-10,30,31].
We used molecular modeling to examine the conservation of the NLS binding surface between KPNA2 and
KPNA7. We mapped identical and conserved residues
between KPNA2 and KPNA7 (Fig. 4A) as well as
KPNAs 1 through 7 (Fig. 4B) onto the structure of
mouse KPNA2 co-crystalized with the bipartite RB NLS
(PDB ID: 1PJM, [30]). The RB NLS binds both the
major and minor binding sites on importin a, and thus
serves as a reference for the entire NLS binding surface
[9]. The residues in KPNA2 that bind the RB NLS are
identical in KPNA7. Moreover, the NLS binding surface
is almost perfectly conserved in all seven KPNA proteins. 22/22 amino acids that interact with the RB NLS
[30] and 16/17 which interact with the SV40 NLS [31]
are perfectly conserved among the human KPNA proteins (Fig. 4B). The only amino acid involved in SV40
NLS binding that is not identical in all family members
is R106 in KPNA2, which corresponds to K112
(KPNA1); S101 (KPNA3); S101 (KPNA4); K113
(KPNA5); K110 (KPNA6); and Q100 (KPNA7). Notably,
conservation at this position is observed within the a1
and a3 subfamilies.
KPNA 7 shows limited RB NLS binding and fails to bind
to either the SV40 NLS or the nucleoplasmin (NPM) NLS

KPNA1, KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4, and KPNA6 import
cargo containing the SV40 NLS in permeabilized cell
assays [19]. The perfect conservation of amino acids

through 7 suggests these receptors should have similar
affinities for RB NLS. To examine the RB NLS and
SV40 NLS binding characteristics of the entire importin
a family, we performed binding assays with in vitro
translated 35S Methionine-labeled KPNA proteins (Fig.
5A). The target NLS proteins were expressed as GST
fusions and bound to glutathione beads. KPNA2 and
KPNA7 (a2 subfamily) bound to the RB NLS weakly,
while KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6 (a1 subfamily)
bound the RB NLS at a high level. The SV40 binding

was more complex, in that it did not track with subfamily, as KPNA1, KPNA3, KPNA4, and KPNA6 bound the
SV40 NLS strongly; KPNA2 bound less well; and
KPNA5 and KPNA7 failed to bind the SV40 NLS altogether. Notably, RB NLS binding appears to be consistent within subfamilies, while the SV40 NLS binding
showed binding differences within subfamilies.
After we deposited the human KPNA7 sequence to
GenBank (EU126604), Tejomurtula et al. reported the
sequence of bovine KPNA7 and showed that it binds

(NPM 150-175) (Fig 5B). The NPM NLS bound to
KPNA1 very strongly, and showed some binding to
KPNA3, KPNA4, and KPNA6 (although most of the
bound KPNA6 appears to be a degradation product).
Under our reaction conditions, neither KPNA7 nor
KNPA7ΔIBB bound to the human NPM NLS.
KPNA7 Localizes to the Nucleus in HeLa cells

The steady state cellular localization of KPNA2 is predominantly cytoplasmic, a distribution that represents
the steady state balance between importin a import into
the nucleus by importin b, and recycling to the cytoplasm by CAS. In order to examine the steady state
localization of KNPA7, we generated an affinity-purified
antibody to a unique sequence in its C-terminus

Page 9 of 12

(DQDYEFIDYEC). Double-label immunofluorescence
microscopy was performed on HeLa cells with the
KPNA7 polyclonal antibody and a KPNA2 monoclonal
antibody. This revealed that KPNA7 is predominantly
nuclear under conditions where KPNA2 is largely cytoplasmic (Fig 6A). By immunoblotting, the KPNA7 antibody detects a 54 kDa protein, which is close to the
predicted molecular weight of KPNA7 (57 kDa). Preincubating the KPNA7 antibody eliminates reactivity on
immunoblots (Fig 6B Lane 2) and by immunofluorescence microscopy (not shown). To independently assess
the localization of these receptors, we transfected HeLa
cells with plasmids containing hemagglutinin tagged
forms of KPNA2 and KPNA7. Consistent with the
results obtained with the endogenous proteins, HAtagged KPNA2 and KPNA7 localized to the cytosol and
nucleus, respectively (Fig 6C).

Discussion
Here we describe the characterization of a new member
of the human importin a family, KPNA7. Sequence analysis revealed that KPNA7 is most similar to KPNA2
(54%), and that it is the most divergent member of the
importin a family. Sequence divergence in KPNA7
occurs throughout the protein, including the IBB
domain. Our binding data indictates that the IBB of
KPNA7 binds importin b stronger than other KPNA
proteins. The NLS binding surface is highly conserved
in all of the importin a family members, but we
observed clear differences among the different family
members for binding the RB NLS, SV40 NLS, and the
NPM NLS. KPNA7 bound to the RB NLS with equivalent affinity to KNPA2, but failed to bind both the SV40
NLS and the NPM NLS. In addition, by immunofluorescence microscopy KPNA7 localizes to the nucleus, a distribution that contrasts with the predominantly
cytoplasmic localization of KPNA2. Our data emphasizes that despite a high degree of structural conservation, there are important differences in the NLS binding
specificity and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of importin
-a family members.
Based on the conservation of the residues which make
up the RB NLS and SV40 NLS binding surfaces of
KPNA2, we reached the conclusion that the NLS binding surface is almost perfectly conserved in all seven
members of the importin a family. It was surprising,
therefore to observe KPNA-specific binding to both the
RB NLS and SV40 NLS. Differences in the IBBs of
importin a family members could have potentially
altered the affinity for NLS binding through autoinhibition [14], but deletion of the IBB from KPNA7 did not
alter its affinity for either the SV40 NLS or the NPM
NLS. Assignment of the conserved residues is based
upon the ClustalW alignment of the alpha family members, which was then superimposed upon the crystal
structure of mouse KPNA2. The key residues are perfectly conserved, but this method of examining the conservation does not take into account gaps, deletions, or
the effects of substitutions outside the binding surface
on the ultimate structure of the binding surface. There
is variability between a family members in the rest of
their structure that may result in slight changes in the
shape of the binding surface or relative location of the
conserved residues which may then alter the NLS specificity of a given importin a. Evidence that the protein
context of an NLS plays a role in the specificity for a
particular importin a [21] suggests that an otherwise
generic NLS may acquire specificity for a specific importin a due to structural constraints imposed by its protein context. Subtle differences in the conformation of
the NLS binding surface may therefore lead to

Page 10 of 12

specificity for a contextualized NLS, and promiscuous
binding to an unstructured NLS encountered out of its
proper protein context. These results emphasize the
need for experimental validation of predictions made for
paralogues. Understanding how highly similar members
of the same protein family achieve NLS selective binding
will require structural analysis.
KPNA7 is the most divergent of the seven proteins in
the human importin a family, and the IBB domain is
more divergent than the ARM repeats, which maintain
identity in the amino acids necessary for interaction
with both the RB NLS and the SV40 NLS. The lack of
conservation in the KPNA7 IBB suggests that it does
not have the same selective pressures as KPNAs 1
through 6. There are two known functions for the IBB,
binding to importin b, and autoinhibition through binding to importin a. Importin b binding could be affected
by the amino acid changes in the KPNA7 N-terminus,
but our data show very strong binding to importin b.
This increased binding to importin b may represent an
enhanced affinity of the IBB for importin b, but it could
also be due to decreased autoinhibitory binding of the
IBB to importin a.
A striking feature of KPNA7 is its localization to the
nucleus under steady state conditions, while KPNA2 is
predominantly cytoplasmic. This nuclear localization
suggests that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of KPNA7 differs from that of the other members of the importin a
family. There are three possibilities for the altered subcellular distribution; 1) enhanced nuclear import by
importin b; 2) decreased nuclear export by CAS; and 3)
inefficient release of KPNA7 from target NLS, resulting
in nuclear retention. The most likely of these situations,
given our evidence that KPNA7 binds importin b with
much higher affinity than other a family members is
that this enhanced binding results in increased nuclear
import of KPNA7.
The recent study on bovine KPNA7 showed that it is
expressed preferentially in the embryo, suggesting a possible role in early in development [32]. Given that
KPNA1 plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation
[26], restricted expression of KPNA isoforms could provide a mechanism for selective import of factors that
drive key events during development.

Conclusion
We identified and characterized KPNA7, a highly divergent member of the importin a family of nuclear import
receptors. The importin a family in vertebrates comprises seven proteins, KPNA1 through KPNA7.
Sequence analysis and molecular modeling revealed the
residues that form the NLS binding surface are nearly
perfectly conserved throughout the importin a family.

Nonetheless, there are striking differences in NLS recognition amongst the different KPNA proteins. Tertiary
structure in KPNA proteins could play a major role in
creating binding surfaces that can discriminate between
different NLS’s.

Methods

Page 11 of 12

IBB domains was performed in a similar manner except
that His-tagged, recombinant importin b (1 μM final
concentration) and Ran (15 μM final concentration,
loaded with GTP) were used. Binding was assessed by
semi-quantitative immunoblotting using IRDye conjugated secondary antibody and the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).

Sequence analysis

RNA from the prostate cancer cell line LnCaP was used
as the template to amplify the open reading frame of
KPNA7. Multiple alignments were made using the ClustalW alignment tool in Bioedit http://www.mbio.ncsu.
edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html. The Protdist neighbor function was used to create phylogenetic trees, and Dendroscope http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/
software/dendroscope was used to visualize the phylogenetic trees.
Plasmids

The parent vector used for generating the KPNA proteins was pCMVTNT (Promega). T7 or HA tags were
cloned as annealed oligonucleotides with a 5’ Kozak
sequence into pCMVTNT using Xho1 and EcoR1 sites.
KPNAs 1 through 6 were purchased from Origene, PCR
amplified and cloned into pCMVTNT-T7 using EcoR1
and Sma1 sites (KPNA1, KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA5, and
KPNA6) or Kpn1 and Sma1 sites (KPNA4). Importin b
was cloned using Mlu1 and Xba1 sites.
Binding Assays

GST fusions of the indicated NLS constructs were
expressed and purified by standard methods. His-tagged
RanQ69L protein was expressed in the E. coli strain
BL21 by induction for 16 hrs at 18 C, and purified on
Talon beads. Recombinant Ran protein was loaded with
GTP (100 uM) in the presence of EDTA (10 mM) for
20 min at 30 C. Bound nucleotide was stabilized by the
addition of excess MgCl2 (20 mM), and unincorporated
nucleotide was removed by chromatography on a PD-10
gel filtration column. The pCMVTNT-T7 KPNA constructs were translated in vitro with the TNT Coupled
Reticulocyte Lysate System (cat# L4610, Promega) using
T7 polymerase and 35 S-methionine (cat# 51006, MP
Biomedicals). 10 μg of each GST fusion protein was
bound to glutathione beads, and incubated with 250,000
CPM of translated protein for 4 hours at 4°C. The beads
were washed with buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA,
0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors) and
eluted in 2x SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved
on 10% acrylamide gels, fixed in methanol/acetic acid,
incubated in Autofluor (National Diagnostics), dried and
exposed to film at -80°C. Importin b binding to GST-

Antibody production

A peptide corresponding to a unique sequence
(DQDYEFIDYEC) in the C-terminus of KPNA7 was
synthesized, coupled to Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin,
and injected into rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.).
Antibody was purified from serum using immobilized
peptide.
Immunofluorescence Microscopy

HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 5% Newborn Calf Serum (NCS), 5% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1 mM
Sodium Pyruvate at 37°C in 5% CO2. For transfection
experiments, cells were plated on glass coverslips for 24
hours and transfected with KNPA plasmid using Transfectin (Biorad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells were grown for an additional 24 hours and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Coverslips
were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for
20 minutes, permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100 for 5
minutes, blocked (2% BSA and 2% NCS in PBS), and
incubated with primary antibody. Primary Antibodies
used were 16B12 anti-HA antibody (HA.11 16B12, Covance), Rch1 antibody (cat# 610485, BD Biosciences), and
anti-KPNA7. Secondary antibodies used were Donkey
anti-Mouse FITC (cat# 715-095-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Donkey anti-Rabbit Cy3 (cat# 711-165-152,
Jackson ImmunoResearch).
