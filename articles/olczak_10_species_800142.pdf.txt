Abstract
Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiological agent of chronic periodontitis. The aim of this study was
to examine the species specificity, surface exposure, protein expression, immunogenicity, and participation in biofilm
formation of the P. gingivalis heme-binding protein HmuY.
Results: HmuY is a unique protein of P. gingivalis since only low amino-acid sequence homology has been found to
proteins encoded in other species. It is exposed on the cell surface and highly abundant in the outer membrane of the
cell, in outer-membrane vesicles, and is released into culture medium in a soluble form. The protein is produced
constitutively at low levels in bacteria grown under high-iron/heme conditions and at higher levels in bacteria growing
under the low-iron/heme conditions typical of dental plaque. HmuY is immunogenic and elicits high IgG antibody
titers in rabbits. It is also engaged in homotypic biofilm formation by P. gingivalis. Anti-HmuY antibodies exhibit
inhibitory activity against P. gingivalis growth and biofilm formation.
Conclusions: Here it is demonstrated that HmuY may play a significant role not only in heme acquisition, but also in
biofilm accumulation on abiotic surfaces. The data also suggest that HmuY, as a surface-exposed protein, would be
available for recognition by the immune response during chronic periodontitis and the production of anti-HmuY
antibodies may inhibit biofilm formation.
Background
Periodontitis is a complex process affecting tooth-supporting tissues [1]. The pathogenesis of periodontal diseases is largely attributed to localized inflammation,
which results from interaction between host and microbial factors [2]. The most common etiological agent of
chronic periodontitis is Porphyromonas gingivalis, a
Gram-negative anaerobic black-pigmented bacterium [3].
On tooth surfaces, P. gingivalis is a constituent of the
complex multispecies biofilm known as dental plaque,
which has properties of other biofilms found in the
human body and in the environment. P. gingivalis can
also colonize the tissues and cells of the gingival epithelium [4]. The bacterium can not only invade, but also

accumulate inside gingival epithelial cells [5,6]. Recent
evidence demonstrates that the effect of periodontitis
might have systemic consequences since the bacterium
can spread systemically and locate to other tissues [7-10].
Bacteria living in a biofilm have a physiology different
from that of planktonic cells and they generally live under
nutrient limitation, including that of iron and heme. The
uptake of heme as iron and protoporphyrin IX is an
important mechanism by which P. gingivalis and other
pathogenic bacteria obtain these compounds for their
survival and their ability to establish an infection [11,12].
Gram-negative bacteria utilize outer-membrane receptors to acquire heme from host hemoproteins directly or
through a hemophore or lipoprotein and then transport
the captured heme into the cell. In the case of P. gingivalis, one of the systems of heme acquisition consists of
HmuR and HmuY proteins [12]. HmuR is an outer-membrane TonB-dependent receptor involved in heme trans-

port through the outer membrane [13-16], whereas
HmuY is a heme-binding lipoprotein associated with the
outer membrane of the bacterial cell [17-21]. A detailed
characterization of the HmuY-heme complex demonstrated that heme, with a midpoint potential of 136 mV, is
in a low-spin Fe(III) hexa-coordinate environment [20].
In that report we also identified histidines 134 and 166 as
potential heme ligands. Recent crystallographic analysis
of the HmuY-heme complex confirmed these data and
showed that the protein exhibits a unique structure composed of an all-β fold [21]. Our studies also showed that
HmuY may be functional in the form of dimers/tetramers
[19,21]. It seems that dimeric HmuY takes up heme and
this leads to tetramerization under occlusion of the heme
binding sites. Tetrameric HmuY would protect heme
from host scavengers and delivered it to HmuR. On the
basis of our mutational analysis of HmuY heme ligands
[20], an initial step in heme transfer could involve disruption of only one of the two axial histidine ligands, as
found for Serratia marcescens hemophore HasA [22].
Once bound by HmuR, heme is translocated across the
outer membrane into the periplasm with the assistance of
TonB and further heme transport requires the presence
of binding proteins to escort it across the periplasm to the
cytoplasm. This step might be performed by other hmu
operon proteins, so far not characterized [17,19]. HmuY,
especially in the form associated with the outer membrane, may also store heme and protect the bacterial cell
from damage induced by free hemin.
It is likely that HmuY lipoprotein may play a role not
only in heme acquisition, but also in the host pathogen
response. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze
the surface exposure and expression of HmuY protein in
P. gingivalis. In addition, in this report we examined the
participation of HmuY protein in biofilm formation.

gens, including those infecting the oral cavity (see
Additional file 1) [24-31]. A characteristic feature of all
the HmuY homologues identified in this study is biofilm
formation. However, although we found several putative
HmuY homologues in a broad range of bacteria, the similarity of the amino-acid sequences of HmuY from Porphyromonas and other species was low (5-47%) (see
Additional file 1). Only between HmuY proteins encoded
within Porphyromonas species was the similarity higher
(24-100%) (see Additional file 1). In addition, only P. gingivalis strains possess both histidines engaged in heme
coordination [20,21]. Here we also demonstrated that
antibodies against purified HmuY raised in rabbits were
highly specific and recognized only this antigen in P. gingivalis A7436 and W83 whole-cell lysates compared with
a P. gingivalis hmuY deletion mutant strain (TO4) (figure
1), E. coli, or Bacteroides fragilis whole-cell lysates (data
not shown).
HmuY is exposed on the surface of P. gingivalis cells

The N terminus of HmuY shares characteristic features of
classical lipoproteins, possessing a signal peptide
sequence cleaved off by the signal peptidase II [19,32].
After removal of the signal peptide, the α-amino group of
the N-terminal cysteine is acylated, yielding a mature
lipoprotein. Although HmuY association with the outer
membrane of the P. gingivalis cell was previously demonstrated [17,19,33], the orientation of the protein in the
outer membrane was not examined. Bacterial lipoproteins may be located at the cell surface or directed into
the periplasmic space. We hypothesized previously that

Results and Discussion
HmuY is a unique P. gingivalis protein

Preliminary studies demonstrated that HmuY shows high
identity to proteins identified in several P. gingivalis
strains [17,19]. Here we compared the amino-acid
sequences of putative HmuY homologues deposited in
databases. Interestingly, we found that HmuY is similar to
proteins encoded in several different species belonging to
the Bacteroidetes phylum, which consists of three classes:
Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteria, and Sphingobacteria [23].
The Bacteroidetes class consists of anaerobes which are
often found in high numbers in the intestinal tracts of
animals and which may infect different human tissues,
including periodontal tissues (see Additional file 1).
Members of the other two classes are mainly aerobic and
abundant in many freshwater and marine systems (data
not shown). Bacteria encoding putative HmuY homologues have also been identified in several human patho-

HmuY functions as an external protein [21]. To determine whether HmuY is surface exposed, the proteinase K
accessibility assay was employed using the P. gingivalis
A7436 and W83 wild-type strains. Upon incubation with
proteinase K of intact cells grown under low-iron/heme
conditions, most of the HmuY was not degraded (figure
2A). A similar effect was observed when P. gingivalis cells
grown under high-iron/heme conditions and E. coli cells
over-expressing membrane-associated HmuY were examined (data not shown). It is likely that HmuY may be partially protected by the cell wall, similar to other
lipoproteins [34], or resistant to proteinase K digestion.
The latter is highly possible since we previously demonstrated that HmuY is resistant to the proteolytic action of
trypsin and gingipains [21]. Indeed, experiments performed with purified HmuY showed limited degradation
of the protein (figure 2A). Therefore we further employed
an immunological analysis. Considering the surfaceexposed location of HmuY, the protein attached to the P.
gingivalis cell should be able to react with antibodies.
Dot-blotting analysis showed that rabbit anti-HmuY antibodies, either those present in whole immune serum or a

was analyzed by dot-blotting (B) or FACS (C) analyses. For dot-blotting
analysis, varying dilutions of P. gingivalis cell suspension (starting at
OD660 = 1.0; 1 μl) were adsorbed on nitrocellulose membrane and detected with pre-immune serum or purified pre-immune IgGs and immune anti-HmuY serum or purified immune anti-HmuY IgGs. For FACS,
P. gingivalis cells were washed and, after blocking nonspecific binding
sites, incubated with pre-immune (grey) or anti-HmuY immune serum

purified IgG fraction, recognized surface-exposed HmuY
with high affinity compared with pre-immune serum or
pre-immune IgGs (figure 2B). We did not detect reactivity with anti-HmuY serum or IgGs in the hmuY deletion
TO4 mutant cells. A whole-cell ELISA assay highly corroborated that HmuY is associated with the outer membrane and exposed on the extracellular surface of the cell
(see Additional file 2). Since these two experiments were
performed using adsorbed cells, FACS analysis was
employed to examine free cells in solution. The results
shown in figure 2C confirmed the surface exposure of
HmuY protein. Moreover, all these analyses showed that
HmuY is expressed in bacteria grown under low-iron/
heme conditions at higher levels than in bacteria grown
under high-iron/heme conditions.
HmuY is one of the dominant proteins produced under
low-iron/heme conditions by P. gingivalis

Previous studies showed that mRNA encoding HmuY
was produced at low levels when bacteria were cultured
under high-iron/heme conditions (BM supplemented
with hemin), but its production was significantly
increased when the bacteria were starved in BM without
hemin and supplemented with an iron chelator
[16,17,19]. To analyze HmuY protein expression in the
cell and its release into the culture medium during bacterial growth, Western blotting analysis was employed. We
did not detect P. gingivalis Fur protein in the culture
medium, thus confirming bacterial integrity (data not
shown). Similar to mRNA expression, HmuY protein
expression was higher in bacteria grown under low-iron/
heme conditions (basal medium without added hemin
and supplemented with dipyridyl or human serum) than
in bacteria grown under high-iron/heme conditions (figures 1 and 3). During bacterial growth, HmuY was constitutively expressed in the cells of the A7436 strain,
reaching similar levels in the cells at the indicated time
points (figures 3 and 4). Instead of being degraded by
active P. gingivalis proteases, constitutively produced
HmuY was accumulated in the culture medium because

during bacterial growth, increasing amounts of the protein were detected in both the outer-membrane vesicleassociated and the soluble form (figures 3 and 4). Our
data confirm that the changes observed in gene and protein expression in P. gingivalis grown under iron/heme
limitation reflect the importance of the environmental
levels of these compounds to this bacterium and support
the regulation of HmuY expression by iron and heme
[19]. The response of P. gingivalis to environmental heme
availability was previously mapped on a global scale by
transcriptomic analysis using DNA microarrays and by
proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry [35-37]. The
authors found that mRNA levels of hmuR and hmuY in
the cell significantly increased under heme limitation. In
contrast to higher levels of HmuR protein produced
under heme limitation in the cell, no significant increase
in protein levels of HmuY was observed under low-heme
conditions. The data presented in this study (figures 1, 3,
and 4) and earlier [21] demonstrated that HmuY is constitutively expressed and released into the external milieu
not only in the form of outer-membrane vesicles, but also
in a soluble form, which precluded the protein from being
identified as up-regulated in the proteomic analysis.
In contrast, others have shown that P. gingivalis
enhanced hmuY mRNA expression in response to low
cell density rather than to low iron concentration [38].
The authors found that the expressions of the hmuY and
hmuR genes were highest in P. gingivalis grown in the
early log phase, when the cell density is low, but expression levels were significantly decreased in the late log
phase, when cell density is much higher. They also suggested that the expression of hmuY mRNA in P. gingivalis
cells grown in the same cell densities was similar regardless of the presence of heme. These results are different
from those demonstrating higher hmuY mRNA expres-

sion levels in P. gingivalis cells grown under low-heme
conditions and in biofilm, the latter resembling high-celldensity conditions [35-37]. Our results presented in this
study corroborate the latter findings and demonstrate
that HmuY protein is constitutively produced in the cell
at low levels when bacteria are grown under high-iron/
heme conditions; however, significantly higher protein
levels are found in cells grown under low-iron/heme conditions, maintained in vitro by the addition of an iron
chelator or human serum to the heme-free medium (figure 3). These experiments were performed using P. gingivalis cultures grown in the first passage of starvation,
thus allowing achieving similar cell densities, especially in
the early growth phase (data not shown).
HmuY participates in homotypic biofilm accumulation

To cope with a changing environment and with continuous attacks of the host antimicrobial defense systems,
bacteria produce a biofilm, which plays an important role
in chronic infections due to its ability to challenge the
host immune system and resist antimicrobial treatment
[39]. It has been demonstrated that P. gingivalis actively
participates in biofilm formation [40], which facilitates
the long-term survival of the bacterium and induces an
inflammatory reaction that is responsible for the destruction of the hard and soft tooth-supporting tissues. The
transition from planktonic bacteria to biofilm-associated
cells involves changes in gene expression and is mediated
at least in part by intercellular communication. A recent
study demonstrated that HmuY is produced predominantly in P. gingivalis cells grown in biofilm compared
with the cells growing in a planktonic form [35]. Biofilm
formation begins with the production of an extracellular
matrix, a structure that creates a shared space within the
cellular community. In prokaryotes, the extracellular
matrix is typically composed of carbohydrate polymers
and proteins, and many of these proteins possess lipoprotein secretion signals. To determine if HmuY could be
engaged in biofilm accumulation, we examined in vitro
the homotypic biofilm-forming capabilities of wild-type
(A7436, W83, and ATCC 33277) strains and a hmuY deletion mutant constructed in the A7436 strain (TO4). As
shown in figure 5, bacteria grown under low-iron/heme
conditions exhibited significantly greater biofilm accumulation than cells grown under high-iron/heme conditions. In addition, our data demonstrated that HmuY is
involved in biofilm formation since P. gingivalis cells not
producing this protein showed a significantly lower ability to form biofilm (figure 5). In contrast, all P. gingivalis
cells grown in a planktonic form exhibited similar growth
rates, suggesting that the mutation did not influence bacterial growth (see Additional file 3). All these data suggest
that HmuY may play a significant role in biofilm accumulation on abiotic surfaces and support the importance of

HmuY for P. gingivalis survival during starvation, conditions similar to those found in plaque.
To facilitate adaptation to life within the oral cavity, P.
gingivalis must be capable of sensing and responding to
the prevailing environmental conditions, including nutrient availability, cell density, and the presence of other
bacteria. It has been recently shown that P. gingivalis possesses the luxS gene and produces a functional AI-2 autoinducer [41]. In P. gingivalis, among the many different
bacterial features that are regulated by quorum sensing
using LuxS protein is the expression of genes involved in
iron and heme acquisition, including the heme receptor
HmuR [41,42]. Although the authors analyzed hmuR
gene expression only, it is highly possible that the expressions of other components of hmu operon, such as hmuY,
may also be regulated by LuxS signaling. It has been
shown that LuxS is also required in P. gingivalis for the
development of biofilm under low-heme conditions [43],
which additionally supports an involvement of HmuY in
both heme uptake and biofilm accumulation.

We further tested whether anti-HmuY antibodies had
inhibitory activity against P. gingivalis, which was first
determined by measuring the OD at 660 nm for planktonic bacteria after incubation of bacterial suspensions
with pre-immune or immune anti-HmuY IgGs (figure 6).
As shown in figure 7, incubation of P. gingivalis wild-type
strains with immune anti-HmuY IgGs slightly decreased
subsequent bacterial growth, especially in the early
growth phase. The growth curves resemble those
obtained for the hmuY-deficient strain. The lack of inhibition of bacterial growth in the late growth phase may be
caused by the expression of other iron/heme uptake systems important for P. gingivalis at this growth stage. In
contrast, anti-HmuY antibodies demonstrated a greater
ability to reduce biofilm formation since P. gingivalis cells
pre-incubated with IgGs isolated from immune antiHmuY serum exhibited a lower ability of biofilm accumulation than the cells without added IgGs or pre-immune
IgGs (figure 8). These data confirm that HmuY protein
may be among the proteins important for biofilm accumulation by P. gingivalis.

Figure 7 Inhibition of P. gingivalis growth by anti-HmuY IgG antibodies. The P. gingivalis wild-type A7436 and ATCC 33277 strains and
the hmuY deletion mutant (TO4) strain were grown in basal medium
supplemented with dipyridyl. The cells were then washed with PBS, incubated without IgGs (-), with purified pre-immune (pre), or immune
(im) anti-HmuY IgGs and inoculated into fresh BM supplemented with
hemin (Hm).

Conclusions
As the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria increases, novel ways of treating infections need to be
developed. This is particularly important with respect to
periodontal diseases, which are the most common
chronic bacterial infections of man. First of all, HmuY
may be important for a better understanding of the
pathology caused by P. gingivalis. The surface exposure,
high abundance, and immunogenicity of P. gingivalis
HmuY protein suggest that its detailed examination may
yield novel diagnostic methods. Knowledge of the molecular bases of the host immune response against P. gingivalis HmuY may be further essential for developing
approaches to control and treat chronic periodontitis. To
confirm these hypotheses, studies of anti-HmuY antibodies produced in patients with various forms of periodontal diseases and the influence of HmuY and anti-HmuY
antibodies on the experimental periodontitis in a mouse
model are now underway.

Strains and growth conditions

The P. gingivalis wild-type strains (A7436, W83, and
ATCC 33277), the hmuY deletion mutant constructed in
the A7436 strain (TO4), and the Bacteroides fragilis strain
were grown anaerobically on blood agar plates (ABA;
Biocorp), in Schaedler broth (Biocorp) and then cultured
in basal medium alone (BM), BM supplemented with 1
mg/ml hemin (BM+Hm), 5% human serum (BM+serum),
or 160 μM dipyridyl (BM+DIP) as described previously
[19]. To avoid autolysis, the bacteria were grown for a
time not exceeding 48 h [49]. E. coli cells were cultured as
indicated in previous reports [18,19].
HmuY expression and purification

P. gingivalis apo-HmuY lacking the first 25 residues
(NCBI accession no. CAM 31898) was expressed using
pHmuY11 plasmid and E. coli ER2566 cells (New England
Biolabs) and purified from a soluble fraction of E. coli
lysate as previously described [19]. The protein concentration was determined as previously reported [20].
Immunization of rabbits

A non-lipidated form of HmuY (the protein lacking the
first 25 amino-acid residues comprising the signal peptide sequence, the following cysteine, and four additional
amino acids, GKKK) was used to immunize rabbits
(Lampire) with Freund's complete adjuvant. Purified
HmuY (0.2 mg per injection) was injected subcutaneously. The animals were boosted on days 7,14, 28, 56, and
84 of the immunization schedule and bled on days 1 (preimmune serum), 42 (test I serum), 70 (test II serum), and
98 (final-bleed immune serum). The IgG fraction was
purified from serum using a HiTrap protein A column
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham
Pharmacia).

over-expressing membrane-associated HmuY [19] were
washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6,
containing 140 mM NaCl (PBS) and re-suspended in 50
mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, containing 140 mM NaCl and 10
mM MgCl2 to an optical density (OD) of 0.1. The cell suspension was incubated with proteinase K (0.25 mg/ml)
for 30 min at 37°C. After incubation, protease inhibitor
cocktail (Complete; Roche) was added to stop the reaction, the cells were pelleted, suspended in PBS, and finally
the samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.
Then the proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and
detected by Western blotting as described below.

HmuY homologues were identified using the Basic Local
Alignment
Search
Tool
(BLAST;
http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [44]. Prediction of signal
peptides was performed with the LipoP 1.0 Server http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/[45]. Mature protein
sequences were aligned using the CLUSTALW2 program
[46] with the default alignment parameters: GONNET
250 protein weight matrix, gap opening penalty 10.00,
gap extension penalty 0.2, penalty for closing a gap-1, and
penalty for gap separation 4. The phylogenetic tree was
constructed with the neighbor-joining method [47].
Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates

Figure 8 Inhibition of P. gingivalis biofilm formation by anti-HmuY IgG antibodies. P. gingivalis wild-type (A7436, W83, and ATCC 33277) strains
and the hmuY deletion mutant strain constructed in A7436 (TO4) were grown in basal medium supplemented with hemin (Hm) or dipyridyl (DIP). The
cells were washed with PBS, incubated with purified pre-immune or immune anti-HmuY IgGs, and inoculated into fresh media. The microtiter plate
biofilms were stained with crystal violet. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (n = 6). Differences between the cells
incubated with pre-immune IgGs and cells incubating with immune anti-HmuY IgGs expressed as p values are given above the respective bars.

Preparation of cells and proteins for SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting

P. gingivalis cultures were centrifuged for 30 min at
20,000 × g at 4°C and the supernatants were filtered
through a 0.22-μm pore-size filter (Roth). Bacterial pellets were washed with PBS and suspended in PBS to
OD660 = 0.1. To separate outer-membrane vesicles, the filtered culture medium was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000
× g. For HmuY expression analysis, samples corresponding to 5 μl of the bacterial culture at OD660 = 0.1 or 20 μl
of the culture medium were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked
with 5% skim milk in PBS. HmuY was visualized with

polyclonal anti-HmuY rabbit serum (Lampire) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma), both used at
1:10,000 dilutions. The reaction was developed using
chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning PlusECL; Perkin Elmer). To determine P. gingivalis autolysis,
the presence of Fur was examined in both cells and culture medium using Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide
derived from the amino-acid sequence of Fur (CILADKDLRPPRFSY; GeneScript).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

Levels of anti-HmuY antibodies in rabbit sera were determined by ELISA. For this purpose, 96-well polystyrene

Olczak et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/134

plates (Polysorp; Nunc) were coated for 1 h at 37°C with
100 μl/well HmuY in PBS. The plates were washed three
times with 200 μl of PBS prior to blocking for 1 h at 37°C
with 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved
in PBS and then washed three times with 200 μl of PBS.
Two-fold serum dilutions or 1:10,000 serum dilutions
(100 μl of pre-immune, test I, test II, and immune serum)
were prepared in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After
washing, antibody binding was detected using goat antirabbit IgG conjugated with HRP. After three final washes,
a substrate solution (100 μl) containing 0.05% o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) with 0.01% H2O2 was added for
color development at room temperature. The reaction
was stopped after 15 min by adding 25 μl of 12.5% H2SO4
and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Multiskan Ascent microplate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation).
Whole-cell ELISA, dot-blotting, and FACS analyses

As an additional method of HmuY detection, cell surface
staining with anti-HmuY antibodies was performed using
whole-cell ELISA, dot-blotting, and flow cytometry
(FACS) analyses. P. gingivalis cells grown to OD660 = 1.0
were used for these experiments. For the ELISA and dotblotting analyses, washed cells at several dilutions were
adsorbed on the surface of microtiter plates or nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was
prevented by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin
and 2% bovine fetal serum (Sigma) before the addition of
rabbit pre-immune or anti-HmuY immune serum
(1:10,000) or purified IgG fractions (100 ng/ml). After 1-h
incubation and washing with PBS, goat HRP-conjugated
(Sigma) or bovine phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:10,000 or 1:500 dilutions were used, respectively. Finally, the cells, wells, and
membranes were washed with PBS. For FACS analysis,
the cells were fixed with 2% p-formaldehyde. Then absorbance at 450 nm (ELISA), chemiluminescence (dot-blotting analysis), or fluorescence (FACS; Excalibur, Beckton
Dickinson) were detected.
Biofilm formation

Homotypic biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was performed as described by others [50]. Briefly, P. gingivalis
cells were grown on ABA plates, then in BM supplemented with hemin or dipyridyl to OD660 = 1.0 and used
to inoculate fresh cultures to OD660 = 0.1. Cells in the
appropriate medium were transferred (200 μl) into sterile
round-bottom microtiter plates (Sarstedt) and incubated
under anaerobic conditions at 37°C for 24 or 48 h. The
resulting biofilms were washed with PBS, stained with 1%
crystal violet, washed with PBS, and de-stained with 96%
ethanol. Absorbance (A) was determined at 570 nm using
a Multiskan Ascent microplate reader. The assays were

Page 8 of 10

repeated at least three times with each strain grown in
eight wells. To confirm that the P. gingivalis cells were
viable, the biofilm cells were scrapped into the respective
medium and the OD at 660 nm and colony-forming unit
(CFU) values were evaluated after 24 and 48 h (see Additional file 3). In parallel, bacteria were grown in planktonic form and the OD at 660 nm and CFU values were
measured after 24 and 48 h.
Growth and biofilm inhibition studies

Bacteria were grown overnight on ABA plates and then in
BM supplemented with hemin or dipyridyl to OD660 =
1.0. After centrifugation, the bacteria were washed and
suspended in PBS to OD660 = 0.1. Then 5 ml of the bacterial suspension was centrifuged and the bacteria were
incubated in 200 μl of PBS for 1 h at 37°C with the IgG
fraction purified from pre-immune or immune antiHmuY rabbit serum (200 ng). After addition of 5 ml of the
appropriate medium, planktonic bacterial growth was
monitored by measuring the OD at 660 nm or biofilm
formed as described above. Assays were performed three
times in duplicate.
Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as means values ± standard deviations
(mean ± SD). Statistical analysis was performed using
unpaired Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 5). Values of p
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
