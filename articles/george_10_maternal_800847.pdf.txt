Maternal separation with early weaning: a novel
mouse model of early life neglect
Elizabeth D George, Kelly A Bordner, Hani M Elwafi, Arthur A Simen*

Abstract
Background: Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for mood, anxiety, impulse control, and
substance disorders. Although genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of such disorders,
the neurobiological mechanisms involved are poorly understood. A reliable mouse model of early life adversity
leading to lasting behavioral changes would facilitate progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms
underlying these adverse effects. Maternal separation is a commonly used model of early life neglect, but has led
to inconsistent results in the mouse.
Results: In an effort to develop a mouse model of early life neglect with long-lasting behavioral effects in C57BL/6
mice, we designed a new maternal separation paradigm that we call Maternal Separation with Early Weaning
(MSEW). We tested the effects of MSEW on C57BL/6 mice as well as the genetically distinct DBA/2 strain and found
significant MSEW effects on several behavioral tasks (i.e., the open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test)
when assessed more than two months following the MSEW procedure. Our findings are consistent with MSEW
causing effects within multiple behavioral domains in both strains, and suggest increased anxiety, hyperactivity,
and behavioral despair in the MSEW offspring. Analysis of pup weights and metabolic parameters showed no
evidence for malnutrition in the MSEW pups. Additionally, strain differences in many of the behavioral tests suggest
a role for genetic factors in the response to early life neglect.
Conclusions: These results suggest that MSEW may serve as a useful model to examine the complex behavioral
abnormalities often apparent in individuals with histories of early life neglect, and may lead to greater
understanding of these later life outcomes and offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies.

Background
Childhood adversity, in the form of abuse and neglect, is
prevalent throughout the world and poses a significant
public health problem. In the US, 24.4 out of every 1000
children will be abused or neglected within the first year
of life, and neglect is far more frequent than abuse [1].
Many individuals exposed to early life adversity go on to
develop a variety of behavioral and psychiatric problems
that persist well into adulthood, including both “internalizing disorders”, such as depression [2,3] and anxiety [4],
and “externalizing disorders”, such as drug and alcohol
abuse [5-7], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [8], and
delinquency [9-11]. Not all victims of abuse and neglect
will go on to suffer adverse effects, however, suggesting
that other factors may modulate the consequences of early

life experience. Indeed, recent studies have proposed a
role for genetic factors in the establishment of behavioral
effects of early life adversity [12,13]. Unfortunately, the
underlying molecular mechanisms of the consequences of
early life neglect remain largely unknown.
The use of a reliable animal model of early life neglect
would be an invaluable tool for understanding the potential mechanisms resulting in ensuing behavioral and neurobiological changes. Since the C57Bl/6 mouse genome
has been sequenced and well annotated and numerous
knockout and transgenic lines are available on this background, a mouse model using this strain would allow for
in depth molecular analyses and, thus, would be ideal.
Although maternal separation is often used as a model of
early life neglect, close examination of this literature in
both mice and rats yields mixed results. Examples
in which experimental procedures have been successful in
producing reliable behavioral effects in the offspring are

plentiful, however, the majority of these cases examine rats
(see [14,15] for reviews; but also see [16,17]). For instance,
the standard 3 h of maternal separation of rat pups results
in later alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
(HPA) functioning [18-26], along with perturbations in
several behavioral domains including fearfulness
[27,28,16,29,30], attention [31,16], and anxiety [32-35,26].
The same 3 h period of separation in mice, however, often
leads to an increase in maternal care potentially lessening
the effects of separation itself [36,37]. Indeed, studies
examining the consequences of early maternal separation
in mice have concluded that protocols similar to those
used in rats are either without effect or fail to produce a
reliable phenotype [36-38].
The lack of consistency with regard to maternal
separation in mice seems to be driven by at least two
components: both the duration of separation and the
quality of maternal care provided to the pups upon
being returned to the nest. Additionally, the developmental period in which pups are separated radically
alters the ensuing behavioral and physiological phenotypes, and consequences of early maternal separation
can be altered or even masked by later periods of deprivation [39,40]. Adding to the complexity of the problem,
results of early maternal deprivation in mice also differ
tremendously depending upon the genetic strain under
examination [41,42,36]. Clearly, modifications of existing
protocols must be made in order to fully examine the
consequences of early maternal separation in mice.
For these reasons, we devised a method of maternal
separation that combines several published protocols in
order to increase the likelihood of observing a reliable
behavioral phenotype while minimizing fatalities to the
developing offspring. Our method, referred to as Maternal Separation with Early Weaning (MSEW), includes
separation periods that occur over a broad range of
postnatal ages and an additional component of early
weaning. Our model uses separation periods that are far
longer than those typically reported in mice, however,
the procedure is performed in a manner that does not
compromise viability of the offspring. Additionally, pups
are weaned from the dam at an earlier age, when behavioral development permits independent feeding, further
limiting maternal contact. As described here, MSEW is
a novel paradigm with excellent face validity that allows
for in depth examination of the behavioral and neurobiological effects of maternal separation in mice, and
will aid in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these outcomes.

Results
Study Design

Mouse pups derived from experimentally naïve C57BL/6J
(B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar

Page 2 of 14

Harbor, ME) were used as experimental subjects. Our
primary interest was to develop a model that would be
effective in the B6 strain, and the genetically distinct
and differentially stress vulnerable D2 strain was used
for comparison. For breeding, a single male and 3-4
females were group-housed in plastic cages containing
dried corn husk bedding and a cotton nestlet. Pregnant
females were individually housed and observed daily
for parturition, deemed as postnatal day (PD) 0. Upon
discovery, the entire litter was randomized to either
control or MSEW conditions. With the exception of
body weights obtained on PDs 10 and 17 and a single
cage change, control litters were left undisturbed and
weaned on PD 23, the usual weaning date at our facility. In contrast, MSEW litters underwent Maternal
Separation with Early Weaning (see below). On PD 23,
pups from both conditions were separated by sex,
housed with up to four littermates, and left undisturbed except for routine cage changes every two
weeks and periodic weight assessments until the start
of behavioral testing (PD 65). All animals were maintained in a temperature controlled environment (22°C),
on a 12:12 light-dark cycle with lights on at 0700
hours and both food and water available ad libitum
(Harlan standard rodent chow). Mice were maintained
and treated in accordance with guidelines set forth by
the National Academies of Science [43] and procedures
approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (protocol 2008-10975).
Development of the Maternal Separation with Early
Weaning Model

We initially conducted a pilot study to determine
whether 3 h maternal separation has long-lasting effects
on behavior as determined by the elevated plus maze
and forced swim test. We randomized 14 litters of
C57BL/6J mice to 3 h per day of maternal separation
between PD 2 and 17 and control conditions. A total of
80 male mice from the 14 litters were subsequently
behaviorally tested and data were analyzed as described
in detail below (see Behavioral Testing). Analysis of elevated plus maze behavior revealed no significant effects
of maternal separation (p = 0.9874). Similarly, time
spent immobile on the forced swim test showed no significant effect of maternal separation (p = 0.5554). We
then generated three additional litters of mice that were
subjected to 3 h maternal separation between PD2 and
17 and were subsequently weaned at PD17 (early weaning). Early weaning was added to the maternal separation
in an effort to reduce any potential for compensatory
maternal care after maternal separation had ended but
prior to weaning and has been shown to cause neuroendocrine alterations and increased anxiety-like and
aggressive behavior in mice [44-46]. Although previous

George et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/123

studies have utilized weaning at PD14 (e.g. [45]), we
were unable to wean our animals this early because of
veterinary concerns. Analysis of time spent immobile
on the forced swim test revealed a trend toward more
immobility as compared to the 3 h maternal separation
only condition (p = 0.0919). Analysis of time spent on
the open arms of the elevated plus maze revealed no
significant difference from 3 h maternal separation
with weaning at PD23 (p = 0.3528).
Given the trend toward greater immobility on the
forced swim test after adding early weaning to 3 h of
maternal separation we hypothesized that further reductions in time spent with the dams during the daily
separation period would further potentiate the effects of
the manipulation. This hypothesis was motivated by the
fact that Milstein et al. [36] observed an increase in
maternal care after maternal separation in four of the
five strains examined, including B6 animals, which may
have negated the effects of maternal separation. We predicted that with sufficient separation from the dam such
compensation would no longer be effective. Our primary
goal was to develop a model that would be effective in B6
mice. The B6 strain is ideal for molecular analysis
because it is the only mouse strain with a fully sequenced
genome, and transgenic and knockout lines are readily
available on this background, making it ideal for genomic analysis. We also included D2 mice for comparison because of the differential stress sensitivity of this
strain as compared to B6 mice. As discussed in more
detail in the Discussion section, D2 and B6 mice have
often been observed to differ with regard to both basal
and stress-induced levels of anxiety, although these differences have varied across studies. For example, D2
mice have been reported to be more exploratory and
less anxious than B6 mice [47,48]. However, D2 mice
have been found to be more anxious in dark-light testing and on the elevated plus maze, and appear to be
more vulnerable to the effects of individual housing
than B6 mice [49]. We therefore designed a new
model of maternal separation incorporating longer periods of daily separation in addition to early weaning in
order to maximally limit maternal contact while ensuring the safety and viability of the offspring. The resulting model, Maternal Separation with Early Weaning
(MSEW), consisted of maternal separation for 4 h per
day on PDs 2-5, and 8 h per day on PDs 6-16. During
periods of separation, pups were left in their home
cage while their dams were relocated to new, clean
cages with ad libitum access to food and water. Pups
remained with their littermates throughout the MSEW
procedure, and cages were kept over a heating blanket
to maintain a constant temperature within the cage
(32-34°C) and aid in the maintenance of thermoregulation. MSEW pups were weaned from the dam on PD

Page 3 of 14

17 at which point they were given moistened chow
and checked daily for signs of dehydration or distress.
A total of 63 animals from 11 B6 litters and 57 animals from 11 D2 litters in Cohort 1, and 35 animals
from 5 B6 litters in Cohort 2, underwent the MSEW
procedure. B6 animals only were used for Cohort 2
because of our particular interest in this strain.
Due to the process by which we randomly designated
entire litters as control or MSEW at birth, we assessed
litter size and sex ratio to ensure that there were no
significant differences between treatment groups. We
found no effects of MSEW, strain, or their interaction
on litter size (all p > 0.05). In terms of the male to
female ratio, there were again no effects of MSEW,
strain, or their interaction (all p > 0.05). Additionally,
no pups were lost due to MSEW; although a few
deaths were observed immediately post-partum, there
were no differences between control and MSEW
groups and survival rate at the time of testing was not
associated with treatment condition for either strain
(all p > 0.05).
Effects of MSEW
Body Weight and Serum Analyses

For assessment of pup viability during the MSEW procedure, body weight measurements were taken at several
time points throughout the course of development, and
some control and MSEW mice were sacrificed on PD 10
and PD 17 for serum metabolic analyses. Only male
pups were weighed and subjected to metabolic analysis.
Pups were rapidly decapitated and trunk blood was collected, stored on ice to allow for coagulation, and centrifuged for 10 min (10000rpm) for the collection of
serum. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acid
(NEFA), and glucose levels were assessed by the Yale
Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center. Corticosterone
(CORT) levels were measured using a commercially
available enzyme immunoassay (Assay Designs, Inc),
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of body weights revealed no significant main
effect of MSEW on PDs 10, 17, 25, 40, or 83 (Fig. 1A; all
p > 0.05). While there was a significant main effect of age
on body weight (F(4,258) = 4521.8, p < 0.0001), there was
no age × MSEW interaction (p > 0.05). Additionally, no
significant main effect of MSEW was found on serum
levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, NEFA, or CORT
on PDs 10 or 17 (Fig. 1B; all p > 0.05). While there was
no effect of age on beta-hydroxybutyrate, we did find a
significant main effect of age on glucose, NEFA, and
CORT (all p < 0.001). We found no age × MSEW interaction effect on levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose,
or CORT, however, we did find an age × MSEW effect
on levels of NEFA (F(1,29) = 15.06, p < 0.005). Contrasts
revealed lower levels of NEFA for MSEW animals on

PD10, but not PD17, compared to controls (F(1,29) =
12.77, p < 0.005; Fig. 1B, bottom left).
Behavioral Testing

To assess the long lasting effects of MSEW, a total of 73
male mice (35 MSEW, 38 Control) from 26 B6 litters
and 55 male mice (29 MSEW, 26 Control) from 22 D2
litters were behaviorally tested in Cohort 1. As noted
above, we were particularly interested in developing a
model that is effective in B6 mice. An additional 39
male mice (20 MSEW, 19 Control) from 11 B6 litters
were tested in Cohort 2. Mice were between 65 and 80
days of age during behavioral testing, and all mice
underwent all behavioral assessments. Because mice
were group-randomized by litter, all data presented here
were analyzed using mixed-effects linear models [50,51]
with MSEW, strain, and the MSEW × strain interaction
as fixed effects and litter nested within treatment as a
random effect [52]. Additionally, as noted below, some
data were binned in 5 min intervals and analyzed in a
repeated-measures fashion, with MSEW, strain, time,
and all interactions as fixed effects, and mouse and litter
as random effects. For all of the mixed effects models,
we conducted contrasts to interpret interaction effects
when interactions were statistically significant. For each
of the behavioral tests, initial models included litter size
as a fixed effect; no main effects or interaction effects
were noted for this variable and it was therefore
dropped from subsequent analyses.
Open Field (OF)

Mice were placed in the center of a circular white plastic open field (diameter 55 cm) with an opaque floor
and 30 cm opaque walls. In contrast to a square arena,
the circular open field allows for unambiguous assessment of distance from both the center and sides of the
chamber [53]. The arena was placed in the center of a
dimly lit room, devoid of any obvious visual cues, and
was lit either with diffuse muted lighting (Cohort 1) or
a single lamp placed directly above the center (Cohort 2).
A camera was suspended 3 ft above the middle of the
arena and each mouse was video recorded during the
exploration period. Testing of Cohort 1 was performed
for 30 min, and replications with Cohort 2 were conducted using an abbreviated period of 15 min, with an
additional 10 min test on Day 2. Videos were scored
offline using software written by the authors to determine position in the open field at each time point,
and these data were was used to calculate speed, distance from the center, and distance travelled in 5 min
intervals over the course of testing.
Analysis of open field behavior in Cohort 1 revealed
significant main effects of MSEW and strain on speed,
with MSEW and B6 mice moving faster and thus covering more area than controls (F(1,41) = 4.13, p < 0.05)
and D2 animals (F(1,649) = 13.93), p < 0.0005),

Page 5 of 14

respectively (Fig. 2A). We also found a significant main
effect of time and a time × strain interaction on speed;
while all animals showed a decrease in speed as a function of time (F(5,649) = 65.11, p < 0.0001), B6 mice
showed a more rapid decline across the test session.
Analysis of time spent in the middle of the arena also
revealed main effects of MSEW and strain. MSEW and
B6 animals spent a greater percent of time in the center
of the open field than controls (F(1,41) = 8.62, p < 0.01)
and D2 mice (F(1,649) = 11.97, p < 0.001), respectively
(Fig. 2B). Additionally, there was a main effect of time,
and a more complicated strain × time interaction,
wherein time spent in the center increased then
decreased for D2 mice, but continuously increased for
B6 animals.
We sought to determine whether the elevated locomotor speed observed in the MSEW mice was due to the
fact that the MSEW mice spent more time in the central
portion of the open field than control mice, since mice
may cross the center of the open field more rapidly than
other portions of the open field. We rescored the open
field data for each animal by calculating locomotor
speed within concentric circles of 0-25%, 25-50%, 5075%, and 75-100% of the radius of the open field. We
again observed a significant effect of strain and group, a
significant effect of distance from the center (p < .0001)
and a distance from center × strain interaction (p <
.0001), but no group × distance from the center interaction effect (p = 0.9739) and no strain × group × distance
from center interaction effect (p = 0.3363). Therefore,
the observed effects of MSEW on locomotor speed do
not appear to be due to MSEW effects on distance from
the center of the open field.
We were surprised that the MSEW animals spent
more rather than less time in the center of the open
field than controls. Previous reports have shown that
the intensity of light illuminating the open field has
large effects on behavior on the test in mice [48] as well
as rats [54]. We therefore hypothesized that the dim
and diffuse lighting used for cohort 1 was not sufficiently aversive and we therefore increased the intensity
of the light illuminating the center of the open field and
tested an independent cohort of B6 mice (Cohort 2). In
addition, we sought to determine whether the effects of
MSEW on locomotor speed observed in Cohort 1 were
due to the novelty of the open field environment or due
to a primary effect on locomotor speed. We therefore
tested Cohort 2 mice on two successive days in the
open field.
Analysis of Cohort 2 revealed a similar, though marginally significant effect of MSEW, with MSEW mice
again moving faster than controls (p = 0.06). More
detailed analysis revealed a time × MSEW interaction,
such that MSEW animals moved significantly faster

Figure 2 Open Field Behavior. Effects of MSEW on open field behavior in 5 min time bins for Cohort 1 (A, B) and Cohort 2 (C, D) mice. In
Cohort 1, MSEW and B6 animals moved faster (A; MSEW p < 0.05; B6 p < 0.0005) and spent more time in the center of the arena (B; MSEW p < 0.01;
B6 p < 0.001) than control and D2 mice, respectively. In Cohort 2, MSEW animals moved faster during the first 5 min of testing (C; p < 0.005) and
spent less time in the center of the arena (D; p < 0.05) than controls.

George et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:123

than controls during the first, but not last, 5 min of testing (F(1,124) = 9.01, p < 0.005; Fig. 2C). In addition, we
found a main effect of test day; all mice moved at a
slower rate on Day 2, however, MSEW mice still moved
significantly faster than controls during the first 5 min,
even after prior exposure to the open field suggesting
that the locomotor effects of MSEW are not solely due
to the novelty of the open field. With regard to time
spent in the center of the arena, there was a significant
main effect of MSEW, with mice in Cohort 2 spending
less time in the center after separation (F(1,8) = 7.81,
p < 0.05), irrespective of test day (Fig. 2D). Therefore, as
predicted, more intense illumination of the center of the
open field caused MSEW mice to avoid the central portion of the open field, in contrast to what was observed
with diffuse low level illumination in cohort 1.
Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)

Elevated plus maze testing was performed in a manner
similar to that previously described [55]. Mice were
given 15 min to explore a plus shaped maze, constructed of white Plexiglass according to the dimensions
of most commercially available mouse mazes (e.g., San
Diego Instruments, Panlab Harvard Apparatus). The
maze, positioned 31.5 cm above the floor, contained two
open and two closed arms, all 30 cm in length, connected by a 6 cm center square. Closed arms were surrounded by 28 cm high black walls. The maze was
placed inside an opaque testing box (100 cm × 100 cm ×
30 cm), which was positioned in the center of a dimly
lit room devoid of any obvious visual cues. A video
camera placed 3 ft above the maze acquired digital
video, which was later viewed by an observer blind to
experimental condition. Behavior was scored in 5 min
intervals for total open and closed arm entries (defined
as all four limbs entering the arm), percent open arm
entries ((open arm entries/total arm entries) × 100),
protected and unprotected stretch-attends, and protected and unprotected head dips (protected defined as
occurring within a closed arm, and unprotected occurring on an open arm). Additionally, video tracking was
performed offline using software written by the authors
to determine time spent in each arm and speed at
each time point.
Analysis of elevated plus maze behavior revealed significant main effects of MSEW and strain on open arm
entries. The total number of open arm entries was significantly lower for MSEW than control animals of both
strains (F(1,106) = 10.24, p < 0.005), and D2 mice,
regardless of treatment, made far fewer entries than
their B6 counterparts (F(1,106) = 103.94, p < 0.0001). In
addition, we found that open arm entries decreased as a
function of time for all animals (F(2,212) = 31.27, p <
0.0001), and there was a significant strain × time interaction, such that B6 mice showed a greater decline in

Page 7 of 14

number of entries across the session (F(2,212) = 21.06,
p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A). Similarly, MSEW and D2 animals
made a smaller percent of open arm entries compared
to controls (F(1,106) = 17.37, p < .0001), and B6 mice
(F(1,106) = 77.41, p < 0.0001), respectively. Again, we
observed a significant main effect of time, and a significant strain × time interaction. Specifically, all animals
showed a reduction in percent open arm entries across
the test (F(2,212) = 10.24, p < .0001), and this decline
was more rapid in B6 mice (F(2,212) = 4.38, p < 0.05)
(Fig. 3B). Analysis of total time spent on open arms
revealed no main effect of MSEW, though there was a
trend in average time spent in an open arm per entry,
with mice spending less time per entry after MSEW
(p = 0.08). We did, however, find a significant main
effect of strain where B6 animals spent more time on
the open arms per entry than D2 mice (F(1,81) = 49.45,
p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3C). There was no effect of MSEW on
speed while on an open arm (p > 0.05).
In contrast to open arm entries, analysis of closed arm
entries showed a trend toward more entries by MSEW
mice (p = 0.08). We again found a significant main effect
of strain; D2 mice of both treatment groups made fewer
arm entries than their B6 counterparts (F(1,120) = 23.92,
p < 0.0001). We also found a significant main effect of
time and a significant strain × time interaction, such that
closed arm entries declined as a function of time for all
animals (F(2,235) = 24.97, p < 0.0001), and declined
more steeply for B6 mice (F(2,235) = 15.07, p < 0.0001)
(Fig. 3D). Analysis of total time on closed arms again
revealed no main effect of MSEW, however, we saw a
significant effect of MSEW on average time spent in
a closed arm per entry, with mice again spending less
time per entry after MSEW (F(1,34.1) = 6.81, p < 0.05;
data not shown). Additionally, analysis of speed in
the closed arms revealed a trend toward an effect of
MSEW, with separated mice moving faster than controls
(p = 0.057).
With regard to exploratory activity, many more protected than unprotected head dips were observed (F
(1,116) = 17.83, p < 0.0001). While no main effect of
MSEW was apparent, we did find an effect of strain, in
that B6 mice made more head dips of both types than
D2 mice (F(1,116) = 120.10, p < 0.0001). We also found
a significant strain × type interaction, with D2 mice
making far more protected than unprotected head dips
(F(1,116) = 14.27, p < 0.001), while B6 mice made an
approximately equal number of each type (data not
shown). Similarly, all mice made more protected than
unprotected stretch-attends (F(1,116) = 711.74, p <
0.0001), and we again observed an effect of strain, such
that B6 mice made more stretch attends of both types
than their D2 counterparts (F(1,116) = 59.18, p <
0.0001). In addition, we found a significant effect of

made fewer open arm entries (A; MSEW p < 0.005; D2 p < 0.0001), a smaller percent of open arm entries (B; MSEW p < 0.0001; D2 p < 0.0001),
and spent less time on open arms per entry (C; MSEW p = 0.08; D2 p < 0.0001) than control and B6 animals, respectively. MSEW had no effect
on closed arm entries (D).

MSEW mice make more protected, and fewer unprotected stretch-attends, compared to controls (F(1,116) =
4.53, p < 0.05) (data not shown).
Forced Swim Test (FST)

The forced swim test was performed according to published procedures [56,57] with minor modifications
(see). Mice were placed in a 4-L glass cylinder (16 cm
diameter) filled to a depth of 10 cm with 25°C water.
Each mouse was tested for 15 min and the cylinder was
cleaned and filled with fresh water following each animal. At completion, mice were removed from the water,

briefly dried, placed in a holding cage, and put under a
heat lamp for 30 min before being returned to their
home cage. Digital video was acquired from above and
later scored in 5 min intervals by an observer blind to
experimental condition. Behavior was classified as
immobile (defined as the absence of movement with
exception of what is necessary to keep the animal’s head
above water), active swim (defined as movement of all
four limbs), or mild swim (defined as low frequency
movement involving only one or two limbs).
Analysis of forced swim behavior revealed no main
effect of MSEW on time spent immobile, however, there

George et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:123

was a significant strain × MSEW interaction (F(1,81) =
7.7864 p < 0.01). While B6 mice were not affected by
separation, D2-MSEW mice spent significantly more
time immobile compared to D2-controls (F(1,81) = 6.96,
p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 left). Likewise, although we found no
main effect of MSEW on mild swim, the strain ×
MSEW interaction approached significance (p = 0.08).
Again, B6 mice were not affected by separation, while
D2-MSEW mice spent significantly less time in mild
swim than D2-controls (F(1,325) = 5.47, p < 0.05) (Fig.4
right). In addition, we found a main effect of strain on
time spent immobile (F(1,81) = 244.4884 p < 0.0001;
Fig. 4 left) and time spent in mild swim (F(1,325) =
116.8591 p < 0.0001; Fig. 4 right); regardless of treatment, D2 mice spent less time immobile and more time
in mild swim compared to their B6 counterparts. There
was no effect of MSEW, strain, or their interaction on
active swim (all p < 0.05). Lastly, we observed a significant main effect of time on all states; all mice spent
more time immobile (F(2,325) = 71.5, p < 0.0001; Fig. 4
left), more time in mild swim (F(2,325) = 16.1, p <
0.0001; Fig. 4 right), and much less time in active swim
(F(2,325) = 365.8, p < 0.0001; Fig. 4 middle) following
the first 5 min of the test session.

Discussion
The current study was designed to define an experimental manipulation that would produce a robust, long lasting behavioral phenotype in B6 mice and serve as a
reliable model of early childhood neglect. Previous studies have suggested that 3 h of maternal separation in
mice often leads to an increase in maternal care potentially lessening the effects of separation itself [36,37].
Studies examining the consequences of maternal separation in mice have concluded that 3 h of maternal

Page 9 of 14

separation is either without effect or fails to produce a
reliable phenotype [36-38] and our pilot studies were
consistent with these findings. We hypothesized that the
efficacy of the procedure would be increased by increasing the duration of the daily separation period and by
weaning the animals at PD17, after the last day of
maternal separation. Early weaning itself has been
shown to cause neuroendocrine alterations and
increased anxiety-like and aggressive behavior in mice
[44-46]. However, in our pilot studies, the addition of
early weaning (defined as weaning at PD17) to 3 h
maternal separation was not sufficient to cause behavioral changes. It should however be noted that other
studies (e.g. [45]) used weaning at PD14 whereas we
weaned pups at PD17 which may have lessened the efficacy of this procedure. When we combined early weaning with extended separation periods (Maternal
Separation with Early Weaning; MSEW) we observed
multiple behavioral changes that persisted well into
adulthood and were apparent across a variety of behavioral domains. We propose that MSEW is superior to
previously used maternal separation protocols in that it
produces a robust phenotype in the offspring, while
being safe for pups. In addition, because MSEW is effective in B6 mice this model should prove useful for studies examining the cellular and molecular consequences
of early maternal neglect.
MSEW does not cause alterations in metabolite levels or
body weight

It is reasonable to question whether the long lasting
behavioral effects of MSEW are in fact due to the
separation itself, or if there are other contributing factors. Admittedly, standard maternal separation times are
much shorter than those employed in the current study,

0.05) than D2-controls. D2 mice spent less time immobile (p < 0.0001) and more time in mild swim (p < 0.0001) than B6 animals. There were no
effects of MSEW or strain on active swim.

and may, therefore, not be as potentially detrimental to
the nutritional state of the pup. In the case of MSEW, it
is possible that the longer separation times would lead
to nutritional deficiencies. To determine whether
MSEW affected the nutritional state of pups, we analyzed body weight throughout development as well as
metabolic indices of nutritional status. Importantly, analysis of body weight confirmed that there were no
changes due to MSEW. Further, MSEW did not result
in any nutritional deficits or altered HPA activity during
the time of separation, as evidenced by serum analyses
of several markers of malnutrition. Some serum metabolites, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and NEFA, rise during periods of food restriction [58], and heightened
levels can, therefore, serve as a marker of malnutrition.
We did not see any effect of MSEW on serum levels of
glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate on PDs 10 or 17, or
NEFA on PD17. In fact, the lone metabolic alteration
during MSEW, a significant reduction in serum NEFA
in PD10 MSEW pups, suggests a possible increase in
overnight feeding, perhaps to account for lack of nursing during separation. The lack of effect on animal
weights and serum metabolic factors suggests that
MSEW does not induce a significant change in total
feeding behavior. The lack of an MSEW induced increase
in CORT, however, was somewhat unexpected, since
extended periods of maternal separation have proven
effective in eliciting robust HPA activation (e.g., [59-63]).
Notably, in the current experiment, serum was collected
prior to any period of separation on that day, so MSEWinduced increases in CORT were possibly dampened by
the previous night’s maternal care. Thought not a direct
indication, this effect along with the lack of metabolic differences in the MSEW animals suggests that lasting
behavioral effects were due to MSEW itself and not due
to intervening factors such as nutritional status or
increased HPA activity during early development.
While the developmental differences in serum corticosterone appear to be striking, attention must be paid to
the day of assessment. In both the mouse and rat, a period of stress hyporesponsiveness (SHRP) is associated
with blunted HPA activity and reduced basal and stressinduced CORT release (e.g., [64-67]). Developmental differences were also observed in other measures, including
body weight, and several metabolic factors (e.g. glucose
and NEFA). These differences, while significant, are in
line with what one would expect to observe across early
ontogeny and reflect normal growth and development.
MSEW results in long lasting behavioral changes
Open field testing reveals hyperlocomotion and altered
anxiety of MSEW animals

Mice were behaviorally characterized 2 months following
completion of the MSEW procedure. The first behavioral

Page 10 of 14

test, the open field, is commonly used to assess emotionality in rodents using measures of locomotion and
anxiety [68,69]. Perhaps the most notable behavioral
effect of MSEW in the open field was a significant
increase in speed, resulting in greater distances travelled over the course of testing. The increased locomotor activity observed in MSEW animals of both
strains suggests a hyperactivity phenotype. This effect
was both replicated in a second cohort of B6 animals
and is consistent with findings from other labs in rat
models of maternal separation [31]. Importantly, this
finding is also similar to the effects observed clinically
in adults with a history of early life adversity [8].
Though most apparent during the first 5 min of testing, the hyperactivity phenotype persisted on Day 2,
indicating that it was not simply driven by exposure to
a novel environment.
Measures of anxiety in the open field showed an
important effect of light intensity on MSEW effects
on time spent in the center of the open field. MSEW
animals from Cohort 1 spent more time in the center of the arena than controls, while the opposite
was true for animals from Cohort 2. During Cohort
1 testing the arena was illuminated uniformly and
with a low light level, and MSEW mice spent more
time in the center of the open field than controls.
To better evaluate what appeared to be a reduction
in anxiety, the center of the open field was more
brightly lit for Cohort 2. As expected, MSEW animals from Cohort 2 exhibited increased avoidance of
the center of the field, a response that represents a
natural avoidance of open areas [70], and is consistent with other reports of heightened anxiety following maternal separation [32-35,26]. The reversal of
the effects noted with respect to time spent in the
center when the central portion was more intensely
illuminated suggests that MSEW causes avoidance of
the center of the open field only with sufficient light
intensity. This finding is consistent with previous
reports showing that the intensity of light illuminating the open field has large effects on behavior
on the test in mice [48] as well as rats [54]. The
increased time spent in the center of the open field
in MSEW animals under low light conditions was
unexpected. It is possible that at low light levels the
test fails to measure anxiety-like behavior and is,
instead, sensitive to other behaviors such as exploration. Alternatively, it is possible that at low stress
levels MSEW mice are less avoidant of open spaces
than are controls, but that the pattern reverses with
higher levels of stress, possibly because of enhanced
stress vulnerability in the MSEW animals. Further
research will be required to distinguish between
these possibilities.

Elevated plus maze testing confirms hyperlocomotion and
suggests increased anxiety after MSEW

We used the elevated plus maze to further characterize
the behavioral phenotype resulting from MSEW.
Though commonly used as a test of anxiety in mice, the
EPM also assesses locomotor activity, and can therefore
both confirm and extend results obtained in the open
field [71-73]. Behavior of MSEW mice on the EPM
does, in fact, confirm the hyperactivity phenotype, as
evidenced by a faster rate of movement while in closed
arms. The behavior of MSEW mice on the elevated plus
maze also suggests increased anxiety. Specifically,
MSEW mice made fewer open arm entries, and showed
a decrease in percent open arm entries and a trend
toward less time spent on an open arm per entry. Like
the center of a brightly lit open field, the open arms of
an elevated plus maze are typically avoided due to a
rodent’s natural aversion to open spaces [70]. The
increased avoidance of open arms and reduction in time
spent on open arms per entry both point to increased
anxiety in MSEW mice. Additionally, the anxiety-like
phenotype is further supported by analysis of stretchattend behaviors; while MSEW animals show a general
increase in exploratory activity (i.e., increased protected
stretch attends), they make far fewer unprotected stretch
attends than controls. Analysis of EPM behavior,
together with that in the open field, provides strong
support for hyperactivity and increases in anxiety due to
MSEW. Notably, these results are consistent with long
lasting effects of early life adversity typically reported in
both animal models (e.g., [32-34]) and clinical studies
(e.g., [2,4,8,3]).
Forced Swim testing reveals increased depressive like
symptoms

The forced swim test is a commonly used test of depressive-like behavior, where mice are forced into an inescapable situation and time spent immobile is considered
a measure of behavioral despair [56,57]. Anti-depressants have been shown to alter activity, specifically leading to a reduction in time spent immobile [56,57]. Using
a 15 min test, we found significant effects of time on
almost all measures analyzed, consistent with previously
reported observations [74]. Further, effects of MSEW
were most apparent during the final 5 min interval of
the test, in agreement with previous studies showing
that the effects of antidepressant treatment are greater
following the first 5 min of forced swim [75]. These
results suggest that a longer testing time may be useful
in determining small behavior changes, and may be
necessary when testing mice, as previous studies have
failed to find consistent effects using shorter testing
intervals (e.g., [36,37]). In the present study, D2 mice
spent more time immobile and less time in mild swim
after MSEW, suggesting an increase in depressive-like

Page 11 of 14

behavior as a result of separation. In contrast, B6 mice
seemed to be relatively unaffected by MSEW with
regard to behavior in the forced swim test. The considerable MSEW × strain interaction that we observed suggests that MSEW-induced alterations in behavioral
despair are governed by genetic factors, and warrants
further investigation.
The Role of Strain in Response to MSEW

Although our primary goal was to develop a model that
would be effective in the B6 strain, numerous B6 versus
D2 strain differences emerged from this work that are
of interest. Strain alone was found to have a very strong
main effect on nearly all of the tests performed. Relative
to B6, D2 mice stayed further away from the center of
the arena and moved more slowly during the open field
test. On the elevated plus maze, D2 mice made fewer
arm entries, and spent more time in closed arms and
less time on open arms. Overall, this pattern of activity
suggests a higher level of anxiety-like behavior in the D2
strain as compared to B6 mice, a notion that supports
the results of previous studies ([76-80,49] but see
[81,47] for evidence to the contrary). Also consistent
with several previous reports, D2 mice spent less time
immobile during the forced swim test, suggestive of less
depressive-like behavior at baseline ([82-84] but see
[85,86] for evidence to the contrary). Notably, the forced
swim test, used as an index of behavioral despair, and
the open field and elevated plus maze tests, both measures of anxiety, elicit different responses in the two
strains. The genetic differences between B6 and D2
mice may give insight into the mechanisms involved in
depressive- versus anxiety- like responses to MSEW. It
is reasonable to question whether the strain differences
in response to MSEW are due to the separation procedure itself, or perhaps separation-induced alterations in
maternal care. Several published reports, however, have
shown that maternal care in B6 and D2 dams is roughly
equivalent, both at baseline and after periods of maternal separation [36,87]. While additional studies are
required to determine the molecular basis of these strain
dependent effects, we believe that these differences in
response to MSEW provide a means to determine
genetic factors that modulate the effects of early life
adversity.

Conclusions
The MSEW procedure presented here is a novel paradigm proposed as a model of early life neglect. Previously, most commonly used methods of maternal
separation have produced inconsistent results, and we
believe a reliable model of maternal neglect in the B6
mouse is necessary in order to fully understand the
mechanisms leading to later life psychiatric problems
resulting from early life neglect. We have shown that

George et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/123

MSEW is not associated with increases in pup mortality
or morbidity, weight change, or metabolic derangements. Subsequent to MSEW, we observed alterations
across several behavioral domains, most notably
increases in hyperactivity, anxiety, and depressive- like
symptoms. Further, the two strains tested differed in
their behavioral response to MSEW on some measures
analyzed, suggesting an additional genetic component to
the effect of MSEW. We believe that MSEW provides
an effective model of maternal neglect which has, until
now, not been sufficiently demonstrated in the laboratory mouse. Further, we propose MSEW as a useful
model with which to examine and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the long lasting effects of early life neglect.
Phylogenetically, the mouse is a much simpler organism than the human and differences in response to early
life adversity are to be expected between the two species. That being said, we feel that MSEW has strong
face validity as a model of childhood neglect; we
observed many parallels between the effects of MSEW
in mice and symptoms that have been observed in victims of childhood neglect. For instance, the hyperactivity
and heightened anxiety resulting from MSEW mirror
the increased risk for attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorder and anxiety disorders in victims of childhood
maltreatment [9,10,4,8]. In addition, the behavioral despair observed in D2 animals on the forced swim test is
consistent with a higher risk for depression among some
adults who suffered from early life adversity [88,3].
We are unable to determine the mechanisms that
mediate the long lasting effects of MSEW on behavior
on the basis of the present data. However, we believe
that the MSEW model will prove useful in determining
these mechanisms. Conceptually, stress effects are
mediated by vulnerability and protective factors which
include genetic factors as well as complex gene × environment interactions. After cessation of stress these
effects must be encoded in some manner to continue to
affect behavior. This encoding likely includes neuroanatomical changes that are caused by early life neglect,
neurodevelopmental abnormalities that arise because of
the neglect, and molecular correlates of these structural
changes. For example, a recent review of child abuse
and neglect [89] noted that human survivors of neglect
and/or abuse show decreased cerebral volumes, enlarged
ventricles, alterations in white matter, alterations in cortical asymmetry, reduced hippocampal volumes, and
other structural brain changes. There is also evidence
for a role of epigenetic factors in mediating the lasting
effects of maternal care in preclinical models [90,91]
and epigenetic alterations are evident in human victims
of child abuse [92]. Overall, we believe that the MSEW
model will prove useful in determining the cellular and

Page 12 of 14

molecular mechanisms that mediate these long lasting
effects of early life neglect. Such understanding may
lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for
victims of early childhood neglect.
