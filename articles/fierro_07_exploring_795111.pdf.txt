Abstract
Background: The western African clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis is an anuran amphibian species now used
as model in vertebrate comparative genomics. It provides the same advantages as Xenopus laevis but is
diploid and has a smaller genome of 1.7 Gbp. Therefore X. tropicalis is more amenable to systematic
transcriptome surveys. We initiated a large-scale partial cDNA sequencing project to provide a functional
genomics resource on genes expressed in the nervous system during early embryogenesis and
metamorphosis in X. tropicalis.
Results: A gene index was defined and analysed after the collection of over 48,785 high quality sequences.
These partial cDNA sequences were obtained from an embryonic head and retina library (30,272
sequences) and from a metamorphic brain and spinal cord library (27,602 sequences). These ESTs are
estimated to represent 9,693 transcripts derived from an estimated 6,000 genes. Comparison of these
cDNA sequences with protein databases indicates that 46% contain their start codon. Further annotation
included Gene Ontology functional classification, InterPro domain analysis, alternative splicing and noncoding RNA identification. Gene expression profiles were derived from EST counts and used to define
transcripts specific to metamorphic stages of development. Moreover, these ESTs allowed identification
of a set of 225 polymorphic microsatellites that can be used as genetic markers.
Conclusion: These cDNA sequences permit in silico cloning of numerous genes and will facilitate studies
aimed at deciphering the roles of cognate genes expressed in the nervous system during neural
development and metamorphosis. The genomic resources developed to study X. tropicalis biology will
accelerate exploration of amphibian physiology and genetics. In particular, the model will facilitate analysis
of key questions related to anuran embryogenesis and metamorphosis and its associated regulatory
processes.

Background
Xenopus tropicalis is now an anuran amphibian reference
genome for vertebrate comparative genomics. It presents
the same advantages as Xenopus laevis but has a smaller
genome of 1.7 Gbp and a shorter generation time [1].
Moreover, while X. laevis is an allotetraploid derived from
an allopolyploidization event, X. tropicalis is diploid [2,3].
Even though phylogenetic studies indicate that 30 to 50
MY evolution separate the two species [3,4], it has been
shown that most methods and resources developed for X.
laevis can be readily applied to X. tropicalis [5]. Thus, the
genome of X. tropicalis was selected to explore amphibian
genome characteristics by whole-genome shotgun
sequencing [6].
Working on X. laevis constitutes a challenge when dealing
with large-scale transcriptomics, such as microarrays
experiments or systematic cDNA sequencing. This is
because some X. laevis genes are present as diploids, while
others form pairs of paralogs (also called "pseudoalleles")
that have been conserved with various degrees of divergence, generally less than 10% [7]. On a genomic scale,
recent data has led to the estimation of 12% as the minimal fraction of paralogous gene pairs kept after allotetraploidization [8]. However, this estimate is based on the
application of strict and conservative criteria: less than
98% nucleotidic similarity and 93% mean similarity
between paralogs. Therefore, it is likely that more than
12% of paralogs are indeed active genes in X. laevis. Moreover, such pairs of genes may have distinct expression patterns [7]. An estimated 14% of paralogs show distinct
expression profiles based on EST counts [8]. Given these
complications, it follows that the X. tropicalis genome is
more amenable to systematic transcriptome surveys than
that of X. laevis
Transcriptome analysis relies heavily on cDNA analysis.
Collections of cDNA sequences have multiple uses for the
molecular geneticist. They can be used to establish transcript catalogues [9-11] and to provide experimental evidence when building gene models from genomic
sequence, particularly for 5' and 3' untranslated sequences
[12]. Further, they can be used to provide global views on
genome expression in a given cell type by the estimation
of the abundance of the different mRNA species (through
signatures as in [13]) and therefore can help decipher
physiological roles played by a given gene product.
Finally, partial cDNA sequences (ESTs) are used to identify full-length clones containing the entire open-reading
frame for each transcript [14].
We initiated an EST program so as to provide a functional
genomics resource for X. tropicalis containing sequences
from the highest possible number of genes expressed in
the nervous system. We report the construction of such a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/118

gene index and its assessment after the collection of
48.785 partial cDNA sequences. These ESTs are estimated
to represent 6,000 genes that were annotated through
sequence similarity searches, protein domain searches
and Gene Ontology functional classification. Gene
expression profiles were derived from EST counts and
used to evidence transcripts differentially expressed at
metamorphic stages of development. A set of polymorphic intragenic microsatellite markers was deduced from
the analysis of ESTs derived from distinct strains of X. tropicalis. We expect that this resource will be valuable for further molecular genetics experiments.

Results and discussion
Construction of cDNA libraries and normalization
Two X. tropicalis cDNA libraries were constructed for this
project. The first, designated xthr, was derived from dissected retinas and heads of young tadpoles (Nieuwkoop
and Faber st. 25–35). About 500 retinas were dissected
from stage 32 X. tropicalis embryos, a stage where differentiating retinal neurons are getting organized into layers.
Because these retinas yielded only few polyA+ RNA, the
library was enriched by the addition of mRNA from heads
of embryos of the same developmental stage. The second
library, designated xtbs, was made from central nervous
systems of metamorphosing tadpoles. Brains and spinal
cords were dissected from tadpoles between stage 58 and
64, the period covering the whole of Xenopus metamorphosis. To build the library, and with the aim of respecting the relative proportion of nervous tissue obtained at
the different stages, samples for six animals were pooled
for each stage between 58–61 and three animals for each
stage between 62–64. All these tissues were combined and
the mRNA extracted for preparation of the xtbs library.
The SMART technology (Clontech) was used to enrich the
representation of full-length cDNA clones (defined here
as a copy of the transcript sequences between the 5' cap
and a polyA tail).

To increase the information derived from EST projects, it
is necessary to sample complex or normalised cDNA
libraries with few overrepresented cDNA clones (observed
individually with a frequency greater than 1%). To evaluate our libraries quality, samples of 1,989 cDNAs from
xthr and 1,694 cDNA from xtbs were partially sequenced
(see Methods) to obtain 4,120 ESTs. Next, a normalization step was performed to increase the diversity of
sequence tags. We used a set of 53 oligonucleotides (35
mers) corresponding to highly represented clones (≥ 1%,
see Methods) in hybridizations on high-density colony
filters (See additional file 1). A total of 22,561 clones were
scored as positives (20% in both libraries) with an estimated false positive level of 0 and 3%, and an estimated
false negative level of 38 and 10% for xthr and xtbs libraries, respectively. The negatively scored clones were re-

arrayed to further the project using both 5' and 3' sequencing. The further sequencing of cDNA clones provided
48,785 high-quality sequences derived from 27,806
clones after trimming 57,874 reads (including the 4,120
ESTs of the pre-normalisation step, Table 1, see Methods).
Both 5' and 3' end sequences were read for 75% of the
cDNA clones, therefore reducing the difficulties associated
with EST clustering. Moreover, this strategy helps to determine the choice of a given cDNA clone for further experiments, whether it be full-length cDNA sequencing,
overexpression studies or complementary RNA in vitro
synthesis.
To determine if the normalization process was successful,
the number of sequences containing each oligonucleotide
probe was counted before and after normalization (Fig.
1). Before normalization, the 53 clusters from which the
probes were derived accounted for 18% of the 4,120 ESTs.
This fraction dropped to 1% after normalization, confirming the efficacy of the method. Of the 48 clusters corre-

sponding to nuclear genes, 18 (37%) have 20 or more
corresponding ESTs and 17 (35%) have 40 or more ESTs
after normalization. We conclude that the abundance of
ESTs after normalisation was sufficient in the majority of
cases. Even though this strategy requires re-arraying, there
is no bias due to insert length compared to normalization
by re-association [15] and therefore constitutes a useful
alternative.
EST assembly
We analyzed these sequences with PHRAP [16] to build
contigs out of the overlapping and redundant sequences
(Table 1). A total of 31,767 sequences were assembled
into 8,756 contigs. These were further grouped by virtue
of clone links into 6,547 unique groups (scaffolds). Taking into account the 2,982 singletons issued from 2,304
clones, a total of 9,693 transcripts sequences were identified. We compared our results to the global clustering of
all X. tropicalis ESTs (including ours) by the UniGene pipeline and the DFCI Gene Index. In UniGene, our set of ESTs

belong to 7,778 groups made of between 1 and 220
clones. Similarly, The DFCI Xenopus tropicalis Gene Index
clustered these ESTs in 9,350 TCs and 1,160 singletons.
The majority of clusters (66%) contained three or less
ESTs. Only 11 contigs were composed of more than 100
sequences (See Additional file 2) and the largest contig
contained 159 sequences. Most of the corresponding gene
products (23/50) are ribosomal proteins, the other being
proteins involved in basic cellular processes (tubulin,
elongation factor 1 alpha). Two noteworthy exceptions
are myelin basic protein (contig8746) and metallothionein (contig8708), for which transcripts are found
almost exclusively in the nervous sytem.
The sequence redundancy (number of ESTs/cluster) of
xthr and xtbs libraries was compared to other X. tropicalis
cDNA libraries represented in dbEST (See Additional file
3). A statistically significant difference at the 1% level of

significance indicates that the complexity is higher for
adult-type cDNA libraries, whether or not a size fractionation was performed. Amongst cDNA libraries prepared
from embryonic or larval stages of development, the complexity of the xtbs library ranks first, while the complexity
of the xthr library is close to the mean value.
Sequences were assembled into contigs of up to 3 kb in
size (hsp90 transcript, Contig 8575, See Additional file 4),
but the mean contig length of 745 bp indicated that most
of them cover only parts of the cognate transcript
sequence.
To assess the fraction of clones likely to be full-length, we
estimated the number of sequences in our dataset that
extends over the 5' or 3' end of complete cDNA sequences
(Figure 2; 1,945 entries from the X. tropicalis Xenopus Gene
Collection [8], Xt-XGC and 2,963 entries from the Sanger
Institute [17]). Using conservative criteria, at least one

Figure 2
Added-value of xthr and xtbs 5'ESTs
Added-value of xthr and xtbs 5'ESTs. 5' cDNA
sequences were compared to 4,908 complete X. tropicalis
cDNA sequences from XGC and Sanger Institute. When an
EST matched unambiguously (>95% id over more than 50 nt
on the same orientation) one of these cDNAs, the position
of its first residue (X axis) was plotted as a function of the
cDNA size (Y axis). Each dot represents the result of an
alignment. A position of 0 on the x axis indicates identical 5'
ends between the EST and cDNA. Negative values indicate
that the EST extends further 5', positive values superior to
the cDNA length indicate that the EST extends further 3',
and positive values inferior to the cDNA size indicate the 5'
EST position relative to the cDNA.
5'EST was found to provide additional 5' upstream or 3'
downstream sequence for 854 complete cDNAs (17.4% of
the set). Using the same criteria but only on contig
sequences, further sequence information was obtained on
355 complete cDNAs (7.2% of the set). Of these fulllength cDNAs, 82 are completely matched by 122 contigs,
and the latter are all longer. These results provide an indication of the added-value of this sequence resource in the
framework of the delineation of gene structure, especially
with respect to the determination of the transcription initiation site.
Another way to assess the fraction of clones likely to be
full-length has been described by Gilchrist et al. [17].
Using this method on all X. tropicalis cDNA sequences
(version Xt6 [18]) xthr and xtbs libraries we found to contain respectively 42% and 37% of full-length clones (MJ
Gilchrist, personal communication). The mean fraction of
full-length clones across all libraries is 18%. Therefore, we
conclude that our normalization procedure did not
impair the proportion of full-length clones compared to
non-normalized libraries.

Sequence annotations
In order to further analyse our dataset, we compared our
contigs to ENSEMBL predicted transcripts. Altogether,
4,437 contigs (52%) and 1,423 singletons (48%)
matched 4,083 transcripts from 3,703 ENSEMBL predicted genes (15%). The extent of the underclustering of
our ESTs was estimated from these numbers and used to
calculate that our whole EST set represents about 6,000
genes. We conclude that our cDNA sequence collection
significantly improved annotation of the X. tropicalis
genome sequence. Similarly, we compared our dataset to
2,402 X. tropicalis RefSeq mRNA sequences. We found that
2,230 contigs (26%) and 484 (16%) singletons matched
1,342 RefSeq entries (56%). These figures suggest that further extensive sequencing of putative full-length cDNA
clones from our collection will be of great use in order to
cover the entire Xenopus gene set.

We next estimated the proportion of our cDNA sequences
representing mRNA molecules produced by a splicing
event and hence most likely to correspond to physiological products. We used "exonerate" to compute alignments
between cDNA and genomic sequences. We retained only
the alignments satisfying the thresholds of 95% identity
and 90% coverage. Evidence of splicing was found for
5,025 contigs (65%) out of 7,718 contigs aligned to the
genome. From the 2,693 contigs left, only 274 are significantly similar to a protein sequence and it is likely that the
others represent 3' untranslated regions, often encoded by
a single exon in vertebrates.
Next, two complimentary methods were used to find evidence for alternative splicing. Using genomic sequences
(see Methods) we predicted 111 cases of alternative splicing, including conserved ones such as Clathrin light chain
(contig7735 and contig8467, See Additional file 5). Using
alignments on protein and genomic sequences we found
58 cases (such as elrD represented by contig7817, See
Additional file 6).
Our set of transcript sequences was annotated using similarity searches in nucleotidic and protein databases and
motif searches (Table 2). Of the 8,756 contigs, 62% have
more than 70% nucleotidic similarity to previously
described X. laevis regular entries, and may be considered
as "known" Xenopus genes. Of these sequences, 4,426 had
significant similarity to 2,803 protein sequences in SwissProt database, and 5,506 to 3,571 cluster of the Uniref90
database. We identified 212 sequences corresponding to
the Xenopus orthologs of human disease genes (See Additional file 7). Further molecular studies on these genes in
Xenopus will be useful for understanding the physiopathology of these diseases.

Putative coding regions were identified using framesearch, and corresponding protein sequences were annotated using InterProScan, allowing for an automatic Gene
Ontology Annotation (Table 3).
Several known genes specifically expressed in the eye were
identified, including different crystallins (beta, gamma
and mu isoforms), vsx1 (visual system homeobox 1), pax6
(paired-box protein 6), rdgb (retinal degeneration B
homolog), rgr (RPE-retinal G protein-coupled receptor).
Well-characterised central nervous system specific genes
were identified as well, notably elrC, mbp (myelin basic
protein), plp (myelin proteolipid protein 1). The corresponding cDNAs will provide useful differentiation markers for X. tropicalis.
A significant number of the contigs (37%) had no significant similarities to previously described genes, and may
represent transcribed pseudogenes, non-coding RNA
sequences and undescribed genes. Indeed, comparing our
sequences to non-coding RNA sequences (microRNA
from RFAM, or ncRNA from the H-INV datasets) we found
2 microRNA precursors (contig7127 and 7850 encoding
mir-9-1 and mir-124a respectively) as well as E3
(Contig2965) and 5SN4 (Contig5668) snoRNAs.
Contig7127 (452 nt) is derived from the assembly of 6
ESTs derived from 3 distinct cDNA clones of the xtbs
library. The alignment of contig7127 sequence on X. tropicalis genome sequence reveals 100% identity and indicates that one splicing event is required. Thus, contig7127
represents a bona fide neural transcript of the mir-9-1
gene. Contig7850 (800 nt) is derived from the assembly
of 10 ESTs derived from 6 cDNA clones (one from xtbs
and 5 from xthr libraries). Four of these clones are identical and characterized by a 409 bp cDNA, while two are
longer and have their 3' ends ESTs as singletons but mapping to the same scaffold region.
Expression profiles
Other collections of X. tropicalis ESTs are ongoing
[8,17,19] using a variety of cDNA libraries made from
adult tissues or embryos at different stages of develop-

ment. Hence, we undertook an in silico analysis of gene
expression profiles estimated from EST counts [20].
In a first analysis, we searched transcripts identified by
ESTs derived predominantly from our cDNA libraries. We
identified 99 and 238 cDNAs found prominently in the
heads and retinas of tailbuds or brain and spinal cord of
tadpole, respectively (See Additional file 8 and Additional
file 9) and 25 clones found predominantly in both structures. These clones are likely to represent genes differentially expressed in the retina or the central or peripheral
nervous system during metamorphosis. The study of these
genes in Xenopus could well improve our knowledge on
CNS development and function in vertebrates.
Metamorphosis
In a second analysis, we explored the metamorphosis
transcriptomes using expression profiles derived from EST
counts. It is known that amphibian metamorphosis
brings about unique regulations triggered by thyroid hormones during late vertebrate development, but relatively
few genes are characterised as playing regulatory roles in
this process [21]. We extracted 4,187 UniGene clusters
containing at least one EST from the xtbs cDNA library.
Similarly, we fetched data from 592 UniGene clusters containing at least one and up to 132 ESTs from another
library derived from a metamorphic stage of development. Combining both sets gives 4,779 UniGene clusters
(13% of all clusters). To generate a useful expression
matrix an initial filtration step was performed whereby
clusters composed of less than 10 ESTs were removed
leading to a set of 3,422 UniGene clusters. We used the GT
test [22] to rank profiles in three categories: strong (64
clusters with GT > 0.66), medium (803 clusters with 0.33
< GT < 0.66) or weak (2555 cluster with GT < 0.33) differential expression. Because UniGene is prone to overclustering we focused our analysis on the 64 clusters
corresponding to genes with a strong differential expression and analysed their expression profiles using hierarchical clustering (Figure 3). Twelve characteristic
expression profiles are observed, corresponding to peaks
of expression that are tissue (brain, intestine, kidney,

heart, lung, skeletal muscle, skin) or stage-specific (egg,
tailbud, tadpole, metamorphosis). The corresponding
genes are potential differentiation markers that can be
useful in developmental studies and can easily be checked
by in situ hybridization on embryos. Only one transcript
tagged by ESTs derived solely from a metamorphic stage
was identified. This transcript codes for preprocaerulein
type-4; it is characterized by 40 ESTs derived from 24
cDNA clones issued from 6 libraries made from stage 62
and 64 tadpoles, i.e. representing late metamorphosis
stages. Caerulein is a peptide found predominantly in
skin secretions. It belongs to the gastrin/cholecystokinin
family of neuropeptide, and may play a role as an antimicrobial molecule [23]. This finding is discussed later.

Since there are currently ten times more ESTs in cDNA
libraries derived from metamorphic stages of development in X. laevis than in X. tropicalis, we did a similar survey of the expression profiles of transcripts in X. laevis.
We extracted 6,297 UniGene clusters (24% of all clusters)
containing at least one and up to 710 ESTs from at least
one cDNA library prepared from metamorphic tadpoles.
This corresponds to 24,262 ESTs made from four cDNA
libraries: limb, tail, intestine and tadpole (NF stage 62).
The level of expression of each transcript was estimated by
counting ESTs providing a corresponding UniGene cluster. The 26 clusters containing the highest number of
ESTs, and hence corresponding to the most highly
expressed genes during metamorphosis, are listed in table
4. We expected to find either ubiquitously or differentially
expressed categories among these highly abundant transcripts at metamorphosis stages. Indeed, 16 of these 25
UniGene clusters are found as characterized by a restricted
expression in the tail, limb, or heart (table 4). Interestingly, it is known that 11 are expressed in the muscle cells
that compose most of the tail and limb. One remarkable
case is a gene coding for a protein involved in freeze-tolerance found predominantly in metamorphic limbs, but
expressed in a variety of other tissues both embryonic
(starting at gastrula stage) and adult (nearly all adult tissues sampled with the exception of ovary, testis and lung).
This can be an artefact due to the handling of tissues at the
time of RNA extraction. Alternatively, this may reflect the
induction by stress-related hormones (glucocorticoids)
during metamorphosis.
We then carried out an in silico reconstruction of the transcriptional profile of X. laevis metamorphic genes using
the IDEG suite of statistical tests. We removed clusters
composed of less than 10 ESTs, leading to a set of 3,599
UniGene clusters. The GT test ranked profiles in three categories: strong (167 clusters with GT > 0.66) medium
(1,300 clusters with 0.33 < GT < 0.66) or weak (2,132
cluster with GT < 0.33) differential expression.
From the 167 clusters corresponding to genes with a
strong differential expression, only 30 are composed of at
least 2 ESTs derived solely from metamorphic or adult tissues, four of which bear no similarity to known proteins.
We analysed the expression profiles of these metamorphic
genes using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The
resulting clusters could be interpreted along the predominant expression domains (See Additional file 10). Three
clusters (metamorphic, tadpole and limb) correspond to
larval stages of development that are made of eight, three
and four genes, respectively (Fig. 4). These genes are
promising candidates, potentially playing important roles
during this late developmental event. Below, we describe
briefly what is known about each of these genes.

Digital expression profiles of X. tropicalis transcripts differentially expressed at metamorphosis
Figure 3
Digital expression profiles of X. tropicalis transcripts differentially expressed at metamorphosis. Each line gives
the expression profile of a given transcript represented by a UniGene cluster. The expression is deduced from counting the
occurence of ESTs derived from a given cDNA library. The level of expression is colour coded in blue shades, dark blue means
evidence for high levels of transcripts and white means no evidence for expression. On the left, clusters of expression profiles
are delineated by a vertical bar labelled with the associated characteristic domain of expression. On the right, the cluster name
and its annotation (i.e. the corresponding gene product description as deduced from sequence similarity analysis) are given.
Each column corresponds to a category of tissue or stage of development: 8 adult tissues and 6 stages of development. Note
that a given category may correspond to several cDNA libraries. Here, only clusters for which evidence of differential expression were used to build the matrix of expression. This matrix was analysed by hierarchical clustering on the expression profile
dimension using CLUSTER 3.0 as described in the methods section.

cocktail of signalling peptides, including neuropeptides
such as xenopsin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and
PGLa. Whether these peptides play specific roles in the
context of metamorphosis is unknown. The cluster
Xl.24674 corresponds to a gene resembling uromodulin.
Corresponding transcripts are found in metamorphic
intestine and whole tadpole. In mammals, uromodulin is
excreted in urine and plays a role in the cellular defense
response. A gene encoding a stomatin homolog is highly
expressed in intestine during metamorphosis. Stomatin is
a membrane protein regulating cation exchange and
cytoskeletal attachment. Among the genes represented in
the metamorphic limb cluster are a keratin and two clusters (Xl.57017 and Xl.57064) annotated as lacking significant similarities to known proteins. In the tadpole
cluster, a carboxyl ester lipase is found expressed in tadpole and in metamorphic intestine. Mucin 2 is another
gut protein highly expressed in tadpole, as well as carboxypeptidase.
Taken together, these expression profiles, based on EST
counts, reveals certain genes that are up-regulated during
metamorphosis, possible targets of the thyroid hormones
signalling pathway.
Polymorphisms
The cDNA sequences we produced are derived from the
Adiopodoume strain of X. tropicalis, originating from the
Ivory Coast. The genomic and most other cDNA sequencing efforts are made on the N strain from Nigeria or a distinct IC strain from Ivory Coast. We therefore looked for

metamorphosis

A larval beta chain of globin is among the metamorphic
cluster together with an alpha chain, an indication of the
relevance of our analysis. The comparison of Xl.56714
EST sequences with known proteins shows that they
resemble cell surface receptors of the SLAM (Signalling
Lymphocytic Activation Molecule) family. The SLAM
receptors regulate immune cell activation. Indeed, it is
known that immune system remodelling is a major event
of metamorphosis [24]. The gene corresponding to
Xl.56714 is expressed in metamorphic tadpoles (including tail and intestine) as well as in the adult kidney. However we could not detect significant similarities to any
known gene sequences or proteins. Alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (a plasma protease inhibitor) is highly expressed
during metamorphosis and found in adult liver. This correlates with the associated stress condition that occurs
during tadpole transformations. The gene encoding
alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (also named fetuin) steadily
increases in expression from tailbud stage up to metamorphosis. This gene product is secreted in plasma and plays
a physiological role during mammalian fetal development, especially in mineralization and growth. A known
Xenopus gene encoding a small peptide named PYLa is
found exclusively in a cDNA library prepared from stage
62 tadpoles. As for the preprocaerulein transcripts in X.
tropicalis, the PYLa transcripts are abundant in metamorphic stages, with ESTs found in limbs and whole tadpoles.
Both caerulein and PYLa peptides may be secreted from
skin glands and exert antimicrobial activities. This finding
corroborates a previous report on caerulein expression
[25]. Remarkably, skin glands are known to express a

polymorphisms that could be used in genetic mapping
experiments or to discriminate with mutations obtained
from ENU mutagenesis. We identified 8 SNPs derived
from mitochondrial genes, three of which (snp1A, snp2A,
snp6G) are specific to the Adiopodoume strain (See Additional file 11). The presence of shared alleles for 5 SNPs
indicates the close relationship with the N strain as
already reported by Evans et al. 2004. We searched for
novel polymorphism markers made of di, tri, tetra and
pentanucleotide sequence repeats present in our EST collection. We found from two to ten alleles in 225 markers
derived from 212 contigs/ESTs clusters. A subset of 107
markers are potential highly informative since two or
more alleles are observed at high frequencies (See Additional file 12). The dinucleotide repeat AT and TA are the
most common, accounting for 137 markers. These intragenic markers should be useful once placed on a genetic
linkage map.
This dataset will provide an invaluable tool for exon definition when the X. tropicalis genome sequence is finally
determined. The results presented here are available
through a database on our web site [26]. Users can carry
out BLAST and other searches based on GO classification,
InterproScan results, and expression information. The
cDNA sequences have been deposited with Genbank/
EMBL/DDBJ (accession numbers CN072222 –
CN121006) and clones are available upon request.

Conclusion
Large-scale cDNA sequencing has provided invaluable
resources to decipher vertebrate genome structure and
function. Recent studies on cDNA sequencing with deep
coverage provide fundamental knowledge on the complexity of transcriptomes in mammals [27]. Here, we provide information on the transcript sequence and
expression of an estimated 6,000 genes in X. tropicalis. A
web resource [26] is available with associated annotations. The genetic resources stemming from the cDNA
sequencing project described here can be used in diverse
research projects, including vertebrate comparative
genomics, studies on evolution and development, cell
biology and developmental genetics. More specifically,
retinogenesis and remodelling of the central nervous
sytem during metamorphosis will benefit from this cDNA
resource.
We are currently undertaking full cDNA insert sequencing
for a set of non-redundant clones, as well as characterizing
their expression using a whole-mount in situ hybridization screen [28,29]. The genomic resources developed to
study X. tropicalis biology are crucial to explore amphibian
physiology and genetics, this model system providing
excellent characteristics for addressing key questions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/118

related to anuran metamorphosis and its associated regulatory processes.

Methods
Embryo and tissue dissection
Embryos of Xenopus tropicalis Adiopodoumé strain were
obtained from parents issued of the Geneva collection
[30].

From each of the two libraries made, 58,368 clones were
picked, arrayed in microtiter plates and gridded on highdensity nylon filters. A sample of 1,989 cDNA clones from
the xthr library and 1,694 clones from xtbs were partially
sequenced to obtain 4,120 ESTs. This step provided a
quality assessment of the two libraries, showing the
absence of clones of bacterial origin and few ribosomal
(0.45% in xthr, 0% in xtbs) and mitochondrial contaminants (1.2 and 3.6% in xthr and xtbs, respectively). This
procedure provided information on overrepresented
clones, which were then removed before further sequencing of up to 30,000 clones. These ESTs were grouped into
1,985 clusters.
Normalization of cDNA libraries
Two pools of 25 and 28 oligonucleotides probes of 35 nt
in length were labelled using Terminal Transferase (New
England Biolabs) and P33-dATP (Amersham). Labelled
oligonucleotides were hybridised on two high-density filters representing the xthr and xtbs libraries as in [31]. Positive clones were identified using X-Digitize software on
images acquired using a phosphorimager.
High-throughput sequencing, assembling
The reactions were performed with a Big-Dye terminator
cycle sequencing kit and analyzed by ABI-3700 and ABI3730. Sequences were base-called using PHRED, then
trimmed using LUCY and custom perl scripts. Sequences
less than 100 bp were discarded, as well as those identified
to be derived from ribosomal and mitochondrial RNAs.
PHRAP was used to assemble the sequences taking into
account quality scores, further clustering was obtained by
scaffolding using mate-pairs informations. We retained
scaffolds only if two clone links were available (excepting
singletons) and if the orientation of the reads was consistent.
Annotation
Repetitive sequences were masked using CENSOR. Contigs and singletons were used as queries in BLASTX and
BLASTN searches of Swissprot, Uniprot, Unigene (rel 70)
and Xenopus tropicalis JGI assembly v4.1 databases on
INFOBIOGEN server. The february 2005 release of
ENSEMBL was used. Framefinder was used to identify
coding sequences, and protein domains were searched
using INTERPROSCAN. The results of sequence assembly,

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:118

scaffolding and annotation were loaded on a custommade mySQL database. Web interface was developed
using PHP scripts.
Assessment of the fraction of clones likely to be full-length
5'ESTs or contigs were compared to full-length cDNAs
using BLASTN. Alignments longer than 50 nt and exhibiting more than 95% identities were selected. Overlap
between query and subject sequences was scored only
when the alignment encompassed up to the last nucleotide at the 5' or 3' end of the sequences.
Alternative splicing
Alignments between cDNA and genomic sequences
(masked) were computed using exonerate. Evidence for
alternative splicing was found when two contigs were
aligned to the same genomic region with at least 95%
mean overlap but with a different number of exons.

Alignments between cDNA and UNIREF protein
sequences were computed using BLASTX. Alignments
characterized by a gap (at least 10 aa) introduced in the
contig sequence were retrieved. Alternative splicing was
considered present if the contig sequence including the
gap could be aligned to the genomic sequence.
Expression profiles
EST counts were downloaded from UniGene (release 70
for X. laevis and 32 for X. tropicalis). Relevant profiles were
extracted using custom perl scripts. GT test was run using
the IDEG6 software [22]. Single hierarchical clustering
was performed using Cluster 3.0 software [32]. We used
absolute correlation similarity metrics followed by complete clustering on mean centered gene expression profiles. Results were visualised using TreeView.
Polymorphisms
Mitochondrial SNPs were identified on a collection of
mitochondrial ESTs downloaded from dbEST, JGI [33]
and from our own set. These ESTs were assembled using
CAP3 and analyzed using visualization software [34].
Microsatellites were identified using custom perl scripts.

Highly informative intragenic microsatellite markers. The table lists
allelic data for a set of intragenic microsatellite markers, including the
Contig ID, corresponding UniGene cluster ID, number of alleles, type of
microsatellite. In bold case are figured contig/ESTs/UG clusters for which
at least two alleles have a frequency higher than the mean (calculated as
the total number of ESTs divided by the number of alleles) or higher than
33%. Alleles number and frequency are shown in bold if the frequency is
higher than the mean or higher than 33%. A * is indicative of more than
one repeat polymorphism observed for that cluster.
