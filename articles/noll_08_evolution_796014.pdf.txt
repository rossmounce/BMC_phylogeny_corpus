Abstract
Background: The mal genes that encode maltose transporters have undergone extensive lateral transfer among
ancestors of the archaea Thermococcus litoralis and Pyrococcus furiosus. Bacterial hyperthermophiles of the order
Thermotogales live among these archaea and so may have shared in these transfers. The genome sequence of
Thermotoga maritima bears evidence of extensive acquisition of archaeal genes, so its ancestors clearly had the
capacity to do so. We examined deep phylogenetic relationships among the mal genes of these hyperthermophiles
and their close relatives to look for evidence of shared ancestry.
Results: We demonstrate that the two maltose ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter operons now found in
Tc. litoralis and P. furiosus (termed mal and mdx genes, respectively) are not closely related to one another. The Tc.
litoralis and P. furiosus mal genes are most closely related to bacterial mal genes while their respective mdx genes
are archaeal. The genes of the two mal operons in Tt. maritima are not related to genes in either of these archaeal
operons. They are highly similar to one another and belong to a phylogenetic lineage that includes mal genes from
the enteric bacteria. A unique domain of the enteric MalF membrane spanning proteins found also in these
Thermotogales MalF homologs supports their relatively close relationship with these enteric proteins. Analyses of
genome sequence data from other Thermotogales species, Fervidobacterium nodosum, Thermosipho melanesiensis,
Thermotoga petrophila, Thermotoga lettingae, and Thermotoga neapolitana, revealed a third apparent mal operon,
absent from the published genome sequence of Tt. maritima strain MSB8. This third operon, mal3, is more closely
related to the Thermococcales' bacteria-derived mal genes than are mal1 and mal2. F. nodosum, Ts. melanesiensis,
and Tt. lettingae have only one of the mal1-mal2 paralogs. The mal2 operon from an unknown species of
Thermotoga appears to have been horizontally acquired by a Thermotoga species that had only mal1.
Conclusion: These data demonstrate that the Tc. litoralis and P. furiosus mdx maltodextrin transporter operons
arose in the Archaea while their mal maltose transporter operons arose in a bacterial lineage, but not the same
lineage as the two maltose transporter operons found in the published Tt. maritima genome sequence. These Tt.
maritima maltose transporters are phylogenetically and structurally similar to those found in enteric bacteria and
the mal2 operon was horizontally transferred within the Thermotoga lineage. Other Thermotogales species have a
third mal operon that is more closely related to the bacterial Thermococcales mal operons, but the data do not
support a recent horizontal sharing of that operon between these groups.

Background
The genome sequence of the bacterial hyperthermophile
Thermotoga maritima revealed evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) with archaea [1]. Subsequent
analyses of its genome sequence along with analyses of
large tracts of sequences from other members of the Thermotogales have supported and extended this observation
[2,3]. Many of the genes that have been shared with
archaea encode ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
Although originally characterized as oligopeptide transporter genes, analysis of the substrate binding proteins
encoded by these operons showed that oligosaccharides
are their likely substrates [4]. The Tt. maritima genome
encodes many other ABC transporters. Indeed, its genome
encodes the second highest proportion of ATP-dependent
transporter genes (including ABC transporters) among
currently sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes [5].
Some of the Tt. maritima transporters have been experimentally shown to encode sugar binding proteins [4]
including two proteins that bind maltose [6].
Horizontal acquisition of transporter genes also occurred
among the hyperthermophilic archaea. A striking example
of this is the complex evolutionary history of the mal operons in the Thermococcales as depicted in Figure 1. While
the genomes of Pyrococcus woesei, P. abyssi, P. horikoshii,
and Thermococcus kodakarensis all encode one mal operon,
the genomes of P. furiosus and Tc. litoralis each encode two
[7,8]. The second mal genes found in each of the latter two
organisms (previously designated as the mal2 genes, but
called the mdx genes here, as in [9]) are orthologous to the
genes in the single operons of the former organisms. The
mdx operon in P. furiosus (PF1938-1936 and PF1933)
encodes a maltodextrin binding protein (MdxEPf,
PF1938) and is upregulated in response to growth on maltose and starch [10,11]. In P. furiosus, the mal operon
(PF1739-1741 and PF1744) encodes MalEPf, a protein
that binds maltose and trehalose, but it does not appear
to function as its major maltose transporter [10-13]. The
orthologous mal products in Tc. litoralis have been extensively studied [13-17]. The region encoding the mal genes
are flanked by insertion sequences in both P. furiosus and
Tc. litoralis suggesting these genes were shared between
these organisms by HGT [8]. The similarity of the two
MalK homologs (the ATP-binding proteins) in Tc. litoralis
(MalKTcl and MdxKTcl) suggests that one of them arose by
a duplication of the other [18]. Subsequently, the mallinked malK transferred to the ancestor of P. furiosus along
with the entire mal operon [18] (Fig. 1).
This history of horizontal transfer of archaeal mal genes
raises the possibility that bacterial thermophiles that live
among these archaea may also have shared these maltose
operons. Tt. maritima was originally isolated from sediments on Vulcano Island, Italy, the same area from which

The evolutionary history of the mal genes in the ThermococThe evolutionary history of the mal genes in the Thermococcales. malE/mdxE encode the substrate binding proteins (SBPs), malF/mdxF and malG/mdxG encode membrane
spanning proteins (MSPs) also known as permease subunits,
and malK/mdxK encode ATP binding proteins (ABP) containing an ATP binding cassette (ABC). Subscript An denotes
ancestral genes.
P. furiosus and Tc. litoralis were isolated [19-21]. Hamilton-Brehm, et al. speculated that because these two
archaea lived together, they were more likely to exchange
mal genes [7], so it is conceivable that bacteria living
among them, like the ancestor of Tt. maritima, might have
acquired those genes, too. There is evidence of transfer of
whole operons to the Thermotoga lineage from the Thermococcales. Most striking, perhaps, is the horizontal transfer
of the twelve-gene mbx operon encoding an NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex that is now found adjacent to the mal1 operon in Tt. maritima [22].
A simple BLAST analysis of the Tt. maritima Mal amino
acid sequences suggested they are of bacterial origin [1].
The two sets of Tt. maritima mal genes are their closest
homologs indicating a duplication event or HGT within
the Thermotogales lineage gave rise to one of them. Other
BLAST hits are mainly to bacterial sequences, though
some archaeal sequences are also retrieved. Although
these data suggest the Tt. maritima mal genes are of bacterial origin, no rigorous phylogenetic analysis has been
published that rules out the possibility that these apparently bacterial genes originated from archaeal genes and
perhaps were a part of the archaeal HGT events described
above. This report provides a detailed examination of the
evolutionary history of these mal genes.

The Tt. maritima mal genes are in two operons each containing three, collinearly transcribed genes encoding a
substrate binding protein (SBP, MalE) and two membrane-spanning proteins (MSPs, MalF and MalG). However, the malF2Ttm ORF is truncated and contains an
authentic frameshift mutation. A short ORF (TM1838)
precedes it. Neither operon contains a gene encoding the
necessary ATP-binding protein (ABP) that provides the
energy for substrate transport. The mal1Ttm operon
(TM1204-2) encodes an apparent mannooligosaccharide
transporter that also can bind maltose and maltotriose
[6]. The mal2Ttm operon (TM1839-36) encodes a maltose
and trehalose transporter [6].
Recently, genome sequence data of several other members
of the Thermotogales have become available. Sequence
data from the genomes of Fervidobacterium nodosum, Thermosipho melanesiensis, Thermotoga petrophila, Thermotoga
lettingae and others are publicly available and a partial
genome sequence of Thermotoga neapolitana is available
from The Institute for Genomic Research. This information from other Thermotogales species provides data to
examine how the mal operons have evolved within this
lineage and perhaps can provide evidence about the
duplication event that gave rise to the two mal operons
now found in Tt. maritima. In this examination of the
deep phylogenetic relationships among the hyperthermophiles' mal genes, we also uncovered unreported features of the Thermotogales Mal protein sequences that not
only enlighten our understanding of their evolutionary
histories, but also suggest novel structural or functional
features of the transporter proteins.

Results
Evolution of the mal and mdx genes in the
Thermococcales
Previous sequence comparisons using BLAST analyses
indicated that one mal operon (the ancestral mal1 operon,
mal1An, along with the ancestral malK2An gene in Figure 1)
transferred from an ancestor of Tc. litoralis to an ancestor
of P. furiosus, likely involving a transposition mediated by
the insertion sequences now found in P. furiosus [8]. Based
on a simple comparison of the genes encoding ABPs in the
mal and mdx operons in Tc. litoralis with their homologs
in P. furiosus, a copy of an ancestral mdxK gene (malK2An)
was postulated to have recombined downstream of the
mal1An operon in an ancestor of Tc. litoralis (Fig. 1), where
it now encodes the ABP for the mal-encoded transporter
[18]. This ancestral mdxK could have originated from gene
duplication or horizontal acquisition. We performed phylogenetic analysis of all the proteins encoded by the mal
and mdx operons to test these hypotheses and to determine the origins of these evolutionarily mobile genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/7

The MdxEPf (PF1938) protein sequence was used as a
query for a BLAST search of the non-redundant protein
database at NCBI. The top 250 hits were aligned using
ClustalX and then used to construct neighbor joining
trees. Using these preliminary relationships as a guide,
sequences were chosen from archaea, Thermotogales species, and bacteria closely related to the archaeal sequences
to represent a broad spectrum of taxa. These selected
sequences were then placed in a new database (approximately 60 sequences for each gene). Associated MalF and
MalG protein sequences were concatenated with each
MalE-like sequence only if these three ORFs were the only
ORFs in an apparent ABC transporter operon. These concatenated sequences were aligned and their phylogenetic
relationships were examined by maximum likelihood
(ML) and Bayesian analyses. The tree constructed from
this ML analysis is shown in Figure 2 with ML bootstrap
values and Bayesian posterior probabilities for each analysis placed thereon.
The most obvious feature of this tree in regard to the Thermococcales sequences is the independent evolution of the
archaeal mal and mdx operons. The distant evolutionary
relationship of these two operons is well supported. The
Mdx sequences cluster with strong support with those
from other archaea while the Mal sequences cluster separate from other archaeal sequences. The latter cluster with
sequences from a variety of bacteria including cyanobacteria and members of the Thermotogales. These data support the independent evolution of these two sets of genes
and suggest that the mal genes found in Tc. litoralis and P.
furiosus were acquired from a bacterium by an ancestral
member of the Thermococcales (Fig. 1). We shall discuss
the relationship of these Thermotogales operons to the
Thermococcales mal operons after considering the history
of the Thermococcales malK genes.
Evolution of the malK/mdxK genes and their
Thermotogales homologs
The archaeal malK genes have undergone a very different
evolutionary history than those in their adjoining mal
operons. We examined the relationships among malK
homologs using both MrBayes and PHYML and both gave
similar, though not identical trees, each with overall relatively weak support. However, within those trees, clusters
of strong support were found and these provide reliable
information about the evolutionary relationships within
those clusters. As shown in the PHYML-derived phylogeny
in Figure 3, all the Thermococcales malK and mdxK
homologs group together in a well-supported clade. This
supports the hypothesis that an ancestral malK2An
homolog either was duplicated in an ancestral Thermococcales or was horizontally acquired by that ancestor from
another Thermococcales. The malK2An was later transferred
along with the mal1An operon to a P. furiosus ancestor (Fig.

1) [18]. In these genomes, these malK genes are near, but
not immediately adjacent to, the three-gene mal/mdx ABC
operons, each encoding two MSPs and one SBP. An amylopullulanase gene typically separates the malK homolog
from the other genes, but some of these clusters have
more genes in the intervening region, perhaps indicative
of other HGT or deletion events in some species.
Since the Tt. maritima mal operons do not contain adjacent malK homologs, we sought in this tree any indication
of the identity of a possible Thermotoga malK homolog,
perhaps derived from the archaeal malK or mdxK genes.
Unfortunately, only two Tt. maritima ORFs appear in Fig.
3 among archaeal sequences and all are distantly related
to the Thermococcales malK/mdxK cluster. The functions of
these archaeal transporters are unknown and since none
of their ABP or MSP homologs appeared in the BLAST
results using the P. furiosus MalE, MalF or MalG sequences
as queries, they unlikely to be mal-related ABPs. A function of TM0421, one of the Tt. maritima ORFs found in the
vicinity of these archaeal sequences (though with low
bootstrap support), has been suggested. Data has indicated that it is a myo-inositol transporter's ABP (InoK) [4].
The function of the other ORF, TM1232, is unknown,
though its expression was reported to be upregulated
when Tt. maritima was grown in co-culture with Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [23].
A relatively weakly supported cluster of Thermotogales
ORFs apparent in Fig. 3 is unrelated to any archaeal ORFs.
This cluster includes the Tt. maritima ORF TM1276 which,
based upon gene expression data, has been suggested to
encode a maltose transporter ABP [24,25]. Unfortunately
this analysis does not provide additional support for that
observation. It does not appear that any archaeal malK/
mdxK homolog was acquired by ancestors of the currently
sequenced species of Thermotogales.
Discovery of a third mal operon in some members of the
Thermotogales
Using the P. furiosus MalE sequence as a query, homologs
were revealed in the genome sequences from F. nodosum,
Ts. melanesiensis, Tt. petrophila, and Tt. neapolitana but not
Tt. maritima (Fig. 2). Each of these genomes contains complete malF and malG genes downstream from this malE
homolog in the order malEFG. For Tt. petrophila and Tt.
neapolitana this reveals a third apparent mal operon. Ts.
melanesiensis and F. nodosum have only one other mal
operon (see below), so this is a second for them. This third
operon is closely more related to the mal operons of Tc.
litoralis and P. furiosus than are the mal1 and mal2 operons
(Fig. 2). Although in that figure they may appear to be specific relatives of one another, that relationship is not
strongly supported by either maximum likelihood or
Bayesian analyses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/7

To examine the possibility of HGT of these mal3 genes
between the Archaea and the Thermotogales, we aligned
and analyzed sequences from several additional bacteria
in the clade that includes mal3. That analysis, shown in
Figure 4, does not show a specific association of the Thermococcales Mal sequences with these Thermotogales
sequences, discounting the possibility of HGT of these
genes between the Thermococcales and Thermotogales.
Interestingly, the additional mal operon in Tt. lettingae
(depicted here as "Mal3Ttl" though it only has two mal
operons) is not closely related to its homologs in the other
members of the Thermotogales. It is also not a specific relative of the archaeal mal genes. It was likely acquired from
a bacterial group different than the donor to the other
Thermotogales.
Phylogenetic history of the Thermotogales mal1 and
mal2 genes
Although the Tt. maritima Mal paralogs are associated
with sequences from enteric bacteria in the P. furiosus
mdxE-derived phylogeny (Fig. 2), the resolution of that
analysis was too low to determine the detailed relationships among the bacterial orthologs. To examine the Tt.
maritima mal1/mal2 evolutionary history in detail and to
determine the relationships among the mal1 and mal2
genes in the Thermotogales, we used the MalE1Ttm
(TM1204) sequence as a query and selected from that
dataset sequences from those genes that are arranged in
three-gene operons as described previously. Those
sequences were concatenated with their MalF and MalG
partners. The concatenated sequences from the MdxPf
operon was included as an outgroup and all these concatenates were aligned using ClustalX. Trees were constructed using ML and Bayesian analyses as above.

The resulting phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5) grouped Thermotogales sequences together and the relative arrangement of
species in this group reflects their branching order as
derived using 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons
[3,26]. Tt. lettingae, F. nodosum, and Ts. melanesiensis have
only one of this type of mal operon while the remaining
three Thermotoga species each have two of this kind (Fig.
5). These mal operons in F. nodosum and Ts. melanesiensis
are related to one another to the exclusion of those from
the Thermotoga species. The single Tt. lettingae mal operon
is most closely related to the mal1 orthologs. The mal2
operon appears to have arisen within the Thermotoga lineage either through a duplication of an ancestral mal1 or
through a horizontal acquisition from an unknown close
relative.
An examination of the genomic contexts of these mal
operons suggests that a simple loss of one of the mal operons does not best explain this evolutionary history. As

shown in Table 1, the mal operons in F. nodosum and Ts.
melanesiensis are not located in an area of the genome that
has synteny with any of the other species considered here.
This genomic context analysis also supports the observation that this mal operon in Tt. lettingae belongs to the
mal1 cluster and that mal1 was likely found in the ancestor
of all these Thermotoga species. We found no region in the
Tt. lettingae genome sequence that contains a cluster of
homologs of the genes surrounding the mal2 operon of
the other species. Consequently, a simple loss of mal2
from the Tt. lettingae lineage is not evident. A duplication
of mal1 after the divergence of Tt. lettingae would cause the
Mal1 and Mal2 lineages to be exclusively related to one

another, but that is not apparent in Fig. 5. Consequently,
mal2 does not appear to have arisen by a duplication of
mal1. Rather the data indicate that mal2 was acquired by
an ancestral Thermotoga species from an unknown the
Thermotoga species after the divergence of Tt. lettingae.
With the exception of Tt. maritima all species examined
here have intact malF2 genes. Tt. maritima has a malF2
pseudogene. Our analyses cannot determine whether the
mutations in malF2Ttm occurred during laboratory cultivation of this strain or prior to its isolation from nature.

MalF transmembrane topologies in the Thermotogales
and enteric bacteria are similar
Sequence comparisons showed that the Thermotogales
cluster of Mal1 and Mal2 proteins are specifically related
to those from enteric bacteria, so we sought other evidence to support this unusual evolutionary association of
proteins from such different kinds of bacteria. We examined putative structural features of the MalF and MalG
membrane proteins by hydropathy analyses using the
TMpred program [27].

The MalFEc is a member of the CUT1 (carbohydrate
uptake) family [28] and is one of the most extensively
studied membrane permeases [29]. Unlike other membrane permeases, MalFEc is unusual in that it consists of
eight transmembrane helices instead of six and has a large
periplasmic domain of 180 amino acids between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 (Fig. 6) [30]. This peculiar
membrane topology is reportedly conserved in all MalF
homologs from bacteria closely related to E. coli [30]. The
function of this domain is unknown, but mutational
alterations in this loop affect the localization of MalKEc to
the membrane bound MalFEc [29].
To determine if the MalF topology found in E. coli is conserved in the MalF homologs from its close relatives,
including members of the Thermotogales, transmembrane
topological analyses of these sequences were performed.
Representative data from those TMpred analyses are
shown in Figure 6 and Additional file 1. Both MalF1 and
MalF2 homologs from all members of the Thermotogales
show the eight transmembrane helices, large transmembrane loop, and ABP-interaction motif found in MalFEc.
These unusual features support the close relationship
between the Thermotogales MalF1 and MalF2 homologs
and those from E. coli relatives. The phylogenetic analyses
reported above are not influenced by the presence of this
large loop since tree topologies are not changed when
these loops were removed from the sequences prior to
alignment (data not shown).
The MalF homolog from Propionibacterium acnes, also
related to the E. coli MalF, has a smaller, but still evident,
loop (see Additional file 1). The conservation of this
unique large loop in the MalF permeases in these distantly
related organisms is consistent with their shared evolutionary history. Interestingly the MalF from Deinococcus
radiodurans (and Thermus thermophilus, not shown) has a
smaller loop while Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MalF
(and those closely related to it) show no evidence of a
loop (see Additional file 1). Whatever its function, this
loop is more pronounced in close relatives of the enteric
form of MalF and was apparently lost from the largely
gram positive clade of organisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/7

The MalF3 homologs found in some members of the Thermotogales and in P. furiosus and Tc. litoralis do not contain
this loop feature (Fig. 6). This observation supports the
large evolutionary distance between the mal3 genes and
the mal1-mal2 genes.
Unusual domain architectures of MalG in the
Thermotogales
The MalG1 and MalG2 homologs in the Thermotogales are
unusually large as compared to their homologs from
other bacteria including E. coli (Fig. 7). The alignments of
MalG homologs showed that the C-terminal 300 amino
acids of MalG1Ttm and MalG2Ttm are similar to the MalG
homologs from E. coli and related bacteria, but the N-terminal 525 amino acids showed no significant sequence
similarity to any known proteins. TMpred analyses
revealed a large hydrophilic region of about 500 amino
acids between transmembrane helices one and two of
these MalG1 and MalG2 sequences (Fig. 7). The MalG3
homologs lack this region, supporting their phylogenetic
placement relative to Mal1/Mal2 (Fig. 7).

Discussion
Members of the archaeal Order Thermococcales have participated in intradomain lateral transmission of ABC transporter genes. This is most clearly seen in the sharing of
maltose/trehalose transporter genes [8,18]. The genome
of the bacterium Tt. maritima has a disproportionate representation of ABC transporters, many of which appear to
have been acquired from archaea [3,31]. Since Tt. maritima has two mal operons and lives among species of the
Thermococcales, we examined the evolutionary history of
its mal genes to look for evidence of possible interdomain
HGT.
Our analyses show that the mal operons found in the currently sequenced Thermococcales genomes have undergone
a complex evolutionary history. We confirmed the earlier
suggestions that P. furiosus acquired its mal operon from
an ancestor of Tc. litoralis and that that operon acquired its
malK homolog in an ancestor of Tc. litoralis from an ancestral mal2 operon. There is insufficient information to
determine whether malK2An was acquired by the ancestral
mal1 operon from another organism via HGT or by gene
duplication from the same chromosome.
We found that the ancestor of the Thermococcales mal
genes was clearly in the bacterial lineage. Analysis of concatenations of MalE, MalF, and MalG sequences show the
Thermococcales Mal proteins are most closely related to
bacterial homologs. In contrast, the Mdx sequences cluster
separately in a distant archaeal lineage. Since P. abyssi and
Tc. kodakarensis do not contain a second mal operon, the
mal1An genes must have been acquired in the Tc. litoralis
lineage.

The ancestors of the Thermococcales mal genes were
acquired from a bacterial lineage relatively distant from
that that gave rise to the two mal operons in Tt. maritima.
However, several other members of the Thermotogales have
a mal operon (in some of these it is a third mal operon)
that is from the same bacterial lineage as the Thermococcales mal operons. We found no evidence that this operon
was directly transferred between the Thermococcales and
Thermotogales lineages, though. Sequence comparisons
cannot demonstrate the functions of these newly revealed
mal operons. Investigations into the binding properties of
their SBPs are underway to elucidate their potential physiological roles.
The genome sequence of Tt. maritima strain MSB8 published by The Institute for Genome Research in 1999 did
not contain a third mal operon. Prior to that publication,
in 1993, W. Liebl deposited in GenBank the sequence of a
Tt. maritima strain MSB8 gene encoding a Î²-glucosidase
(bglA) that was contained on a cloned fragment that also
contained a portion of an apparent malE gene upstream of
this bglA [32]. Neither this bglA gene nor the adjacent malE
appeared in the subsequent TIGR genome sequence. This
suggests that after the strain was deposited in the DSMZ
strain collection, it may have suffered a deletion of its
mal3-bglA region. We are investigating this possibility
using cultures of the type strain and the strain used for
genome sequencing.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/7

Tt. maritima, Tt. petrophila, and Tt. neapolitana and that
mal2 entered that ancestor by HGT from an unknown
Thermotoga species. F. nodosum and Ts. melanesiensis both
have a single mal operon of the mal1/mal2 type, but the
genetic contexts of those operons are unlike those found
in any of the other organisms. Their sequences do not
place them uniquely with either the mal1- or mal2-type
genes, a situation one might expect for ancestral-type
sequences. It will be very interesting to determine the
functions of these transporters from these two species to
compare them with the evolved Mal1 and Mal2 transporters.
The Thermotogales Mal1 and Mal2 sequences consistently
clustered in a lineage that included the Mal sequences
from the gamma proteobacteria. The relationships
revealed in the Mal1/Mal2 phylogeny are supported by
the phylogenetic distribution of a unique secondary structure of the MalF homologs. All the MalF homologs with
eight transmembrane helices and a large periplasmic loop
between transmembrane helices three and four are clustered in our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5). A large unique
hydrophilic region in the Thermotogales MalG1 and MalG2
proteins confirms their close evolutionary relationship
with one another and indicates a relatively recent acquisition of this domain. This region is not found in any other
MalG protein and its function is as yet unknown.

Conclusion
The modern Thermococcales MalK homologs are
descended from an ancestral MalK2. Since all the examined archaeal mal/mdx operons have a nearby malK/mdxK
gene, all of which are closely related to one another, we
cannot know if the ancestral mal1 operon inherited from
the bacteria contained a malK gene or not. Despite the relatively close relationship of the Thermococcales Mal
sequences to those of the Thermotogales Mal3 sequences,
there are no obvious orthologs of the archaeal MalK/
MdxK in any of the Thermotogales. The membrane components of ABC transporters are known to recruit different
ABPs to effect transport, so the lack of a malK near these
Thermotogales operons is not unusual. Two Tt. maritima
ORFs, TM1276 and TM1232, were identified here as
potential MalK homologs by phylogenetic analyses, but
we did not observe up regulation of either ORF in
response to growth on maltose [33] though there is a
report that TM1276 is expressed in response to growth on
maltose [25].
Sequence comparisons of the Thermotogales Mal1 and
Mal2 concatenates demonstrated their close relationship
to one another. Three of the examined members of the
Thermotogales have only one member of this family of mal
operons. Gene synteny comparisons and phylogenetic
analyses suggest that mal1 was present in the ancestor of

We confirmed earlier suggestions that P. furiosus acquired
its mal operon from an ancestor of Tc. litoralis and that
that operon acquired its malK homolog in an ancestor of
Tc. litoralis from an ancestral mal2 operon. Our analyses
show that the ancestor of the Thermococcales mal genes was
in the bacterial lineage while the ancestor of the mdx genes
was from an archaeal lineage. The bacterial lineage from
which came the Tc. litoralis mal operon also gave rise to a
newly discovered Thermotogales mal operon, the third in
some extant Thermotoga species. We find no evidence that
the archaeal mal genes or the Thermotogales mal3 genes
were shared between these groups.
The Thermotogales Mal1/Mal2 sequences consistently clustered in a lineage that included the Mal sequences from
the gamma proteobacteria. The appearance of paralogous
mal operons in some Thermotoga species took place by
acquisition of an orthologous mal2 operon by HGT.
The relationships among bacterial mal genes revealed in
the Mal1/Mal2 phylogeny are supported by the phylogenetic distributions of unique secondary structures in the
MalF proteins. The enteric bacteria and the Thermotogales
contain MalF homologs with eight transmembrane helices and a large periplasmic loop between transmembrane
helices three and four cluster. A unique large hydrophilic

region in the MalG proteins from the members of the
Thermotogales confirms their close evolutionary relationship to one another and indicates a relatively recent acquisition of this region.

Methods
Data acquisition
Protein sequences were retrieved by BLASTP searches of
the nonredundant protein database at NCBI [34] using as
queries amino acid sequences of Tt. maritima, P. furiosus,
or Tc. litoralis MalE, MalF, or MalG. The P. furiosus MalK2
(PF1933) was used as the query to search for MalK
homologs among bacteria and archaea. The top 250
sequences retrieved by BLASTP searches were assembled
into datasets and repeated sequence entries and closely
related sequences (determined using neighbor-joining
trees of aligned sequences) were removed. Those
sequences from three-gene operons (malE, malF and
malG) were retained and the cognate genes were concatenated. Alignments of the amino acid sequences of these
concatenates were prepared using ClustalX v1.83.1 [35].

TM1837, the malF2Ttm ORF, contains an authentic
frameshift mutation. To make comparisons between MalF
homologs, the pseudogene was corrected by removing
nucleotides at positions 254 (A) and 298 (G) (identified
using GENIO/frame [36]). Corrections at these positions
restored the reading frame without introducing new stop
codons. malF2Tm is preceded by a small ORF, TM1838. The
putative 54 amino acid peptide product of TM1838 is
53% similar to the amino terminus of MalF1Ttm. By adding a nucleotide between positions 138 and 139 in the
TM1838 sequence and combining it with the corrected
malF2Ttm, a single polypeptide is obtained that has a high
similarity to malF1Tm as measured by PRSS (P value 1.6 e21) [37]. It appears that a series of point mutations in an
ancestral malF2 created TM1838 and the translationally
truncated malF2Ttm. Consequently, there is no functional
MalF2Ttm protein produced by Tt. maritima.
Phylogenetic analyses
Aligned sequences from the concatenate datasets were
used to construct consensus trees using MrBayes v3.1 [38]
and PHYML v2.4.4. The MrBayes analyses were performed
using the default GTR model and gamma distributed rate
variation with two runs, each with four chains, for
1,000,000 generations (780,000 for the tree shown in Fig.
2) and taking a consensus tree after a burn-in of either
100,000 or 65,000 generations. These analyses were performed at the Bioinformatics Facility of the University of
Connecticut Biotechnology Bioservices Center. Maximum
likelihood analyses of these alignments were performed
in PHYML with 1000 bootstrap resamplings, the JTT substitution model, a fixed proportion of invariable sites, one
category of substitution rate, and the BIONJ input tree.

Other sequence analyses
The analyses above were confirmed with alternative alignments using MUSCLE [39] and T-COFFEE [40] each using
their default parameters. These analyses produced phylogenies nearly identical to those shown here when used with
PHYML (WAG model, estimated pinvar, estimated
gamma distribution) (not shown). Transmembrane topological analyses were performed using TMpred [41,27].
