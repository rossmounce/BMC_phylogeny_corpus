Abstract
Background: Multiple alignment of homologous DNA sequences is of great interest to biologists
since it provides a window into evolutionary processes. At present, the accuracy of whole-genome
multiple alignments, particularly in noncoding regions, has not been thoroughly evaluated.
Results: We evaluate the alignment accuracy of certain noncoding regions using noncoding RNA
alignments from Rfam as a reference. We inspect the MULTIZ 17-vertebrate alignment from the
UCSC Genome Browser for all the human sequences in the Rfam seed alignments. In particular,
we find 638 instances of chimeric and partial alignments to human noncoding RNA elements, of
which at least 225 can be improved by straightforward means. As a byproduct of our procedure,
we predict many novel instances of known ncRNA families that are suggested by the alignment.
Conclusion: MULTIZ does a fairly accurate job of aligning these genomes in these difficult regions.
However, our experiments indicate that better alignments exist in some regions.

Background
In this time when so many genome sequences are reaching completion, alignments of multiple whole genomes
are of great value to biologists, since enlightening evolutionary information is encoded in the conservation and
variation across species. Multiple alignment on genomic
scales is also a great challenge to algorithm designers. Protein-coding regions usually evolve more slowly than noncoding regions, and therefore tend to be easier to align. In
contrast, noncoding regions are still challenging to align
correctly. Because of this, a number of recent reviews and
articles [1-4] have made compelling pleas for methods to
assess the accuracy of multiple sequence alignments and
to compare the alignments produced by different tools.

We use alignments of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) as a test
of the accuracy of multiple alignment of genomic regions
that are difficult to align. This is a rather challenging test,
as many functional RNAs exhibit weak primary sequence
conservation [5]. As a byproduct of our procedure, we predict many novel instances of known ncRNA families that
are suggested by the alignment. We return to this topic in
the Discussion section.
Evaluating the accuracy of multiple sequence alignments
Multiple sequence alignment is a difficult computational
problem. Technically, the problem of finding an optimal
multiple sequence alignment is NP-complete [6]. In practice, what this means is that finding an optimal multiple
sequence alignment requires computation time that
Page 1 of 12

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:417

grows exponentially with the number of sequences to be
aligned, making it impractical for aligning more than a
few sequences. Note that this is true even if the sequences
are relatively short; aligning multiple genome-size
sequences adds another level of complexity.
Because of this inherent difficulty, algorithm designers are
forced to invent heuristic methods that produce results
that can only approximate the optimal multiple sequence
alignment. Many such alignment tools have been proposed over the past 20 years. Since they employ various
heuristics intended to approximate an optimal solution,
any two such methods often produce incomparable
results when aligning the same set of input sequences.
This situation naturally raises the questions of (1) assessing the quality of resulting multiple alignments and (2)
deciding which of several multiple alignments produced
by different tools is "best".
The situation becomes even worse when we consider
whole-genome multiple alignments. This is due to the
multitude of genomic rearrangements (inversions, translocations, duplications, chromosome fusions and fissions, etc.) that occur over the course of evolution [7]. The
traditional alignment problem is not defined to deal with
such "nonlinear" events. In what follows, we will categorize methods that have been proposed for assessing the
accuracy of traditional multiple sequence alignments
(where much work has been done), and highlight those
that have been applied to assess the accuracy of wholegenome multiple alignments (where relatively little has
been done to date).
1. One approach to measuring the accuracy of multiple
sequence alignments is to use artificial sequences resulting
from a simulation of evolutionary processes [8-11]. Since
the experimenter can track all evolutionary events, identifying the truly homologous characters is straightforward.
These known homologies can be used to measure the
accuracy of any alignment to be tested. This approach has
also been employed to evaluate genome-size multiple
alignments by Blanchette et al. [12] and by Prakash and
Tompa [13]. An obvious drawback of this simulation
approach is its sensitivity to assumptions about the underlying evolutionary processes, which are not at all well
understood.
2. Another approach is to run the alignment program on
a set of sequences in which certain features are known a
priori to be homologous, and measure the accuracy with
which these known homologous features are aligned. This
approach was used in genome-size alignment studies by
Brudno et al. [14] and by Margulies et al. [3]. The most
obvious choice for the known homologous features is a
set of coding exons. However, this choice suffers from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/417

shortcoming that such features are usually well conserved
and easy to align, and most algorithms do so quite accurately. In addition to using coding exons, Margulies et al.
[3] also tested alignment accuracy using ancestral repeats,
which tend to be more challenging to align correctly than
coding exons. For this general approach, though, many
known sets of homologous sequences have been discovered using some alignment algorithm, which leads to circularity if then used to test the accuracy of an alignment
algorithm. In addition, no accuracy information is provided for aligned regions other than the previously known
orthologous features.
3. A number of papers have suggested methods that
inspect multiple sequence alignments, judging regions of
the alignment that show good conservation across the
aligned sequences to be well aligned, and even removing
sequences from the alignment that show lack of good conservation [15-18]. While good conservation often implies
good alignment, the converse need not be true. In fact, in
our case of interest, the alignment of homologous RNA
elements, it is well known that sequence conservation
may be very low if instead the RNA secondary structure
conservation is strong [19].
4. Lassmann and Sonnhammer [20] proposed a measure
to assess alignment quality by comparing several multiple
sequence alignments, assuming that regions identically
aligned by multiple tools are more reliable than regions
differently aligned. This method requires several auxiliary
alignments in order to evaluate the alignment of interest.
In the same general class are methods that employ other
auxiliary information, such as protein secondary structure, in order to assess alignment quality [21].
5. A final approach is one designed to provide a statistical
assessment of the accuracy of a given multiple sequence
alignment, by extending the theory of Karlin and Altschul
[22] from pairwise to multiple alignments. This was done
for short multiple alignments by Prakash and Tompa [23],
and later extended by them to measure the alignment
quality of all portions of a genome-size multiple sequence
alignment [13]. In the latter paper the authors found
approximately 10% of the UCSC Genome Browser's
human chromosome 1 alignment to be suspiciously
aligned. This is a portion of the same whole-genome
alignment we analyze in this paper.
RNA families as a test of accuracy
The approach we take falls into the second category listed
above. Instead of using well conserved coding regions as
the homologous test features, however, we use curated
alignments of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from Rfam (version 7.0, March 2005). Rfam is a collection of ncRNA fam-

ilies that contains multiple sequence alignments and
covariance models of these families [24,25].
As an illustration, Figure 1 shows Rfam's seed alignment
and the predicted secondary structure of the Iron
Response Element family (RF00037). Most functional
RNAs tend to maintain their base-paired structure over
conservation of primary sequence [19]. To illustrate this,
in Figure 1, the primary sequences of the 10th element
(Gal.gal. X13753.1/830-856) and the 11th element
(Gal.gal. M16343.1/1306-1335) are different. For example, the 10th element has a U in the first position, and an
A in the last position, while the 11th element has a G and
a C respectively. However, this does not disrupt the similarity of their predicted secondary structures, because both
UA and GC form Watson-Crick base pairs.
The seed alignment of each Rfam family is hand-curated
by human experts, based on both the secondary structure
and primary sequence of trusted example RNAs. Using the
Infernal software package [26], the seed alignment is used
to train a covariance model [24,25], a statistical model
akin to a hidden Markov model. Together with a score
threshold also chosen by the Rfam curators, these models
are then used to search genomic DNA for additional
instances of the specific RNA family represented by the
seed alignment, automatically producing Rfam's so-called
full alignments. We use Rfam's covariance model and
score threshold as the definitive rule for membership in
ncRNA families and for alignment. Rfam and Infernal are
considered by experts to be the most accurate general
tools for defining membership in ncRNA families and for
alignment of family members. There are several databases
of recognized ncRNAs of various types but, to the best of
our knowledge, only Rfam/Infernal provides both expertcurated alignments and a simple automated search tool
leveraging those alignments.
Multiple sequence alignments considering the secondary
structure such as Rfam's covariance models are more reliable than alignment tools that only consider primary
sequences. This makes these seed alignments a challenging test case for any whole-genome multiple alignment
that is based on primary sequence alone. We apply this
challenging test to the 17-vertebrate whole-genome alignment produced by MULTIZ [12] and available on the
UCSC Genome Browser [27]. Although MULTIZ is most
frequently shown to be quite accurate in these challenging
cases, our study does reveal occasional compelling evidence of misalignment. Two of the more interesting categories are summarized here:
1. For 5.4% of the nonhuman sequences aligned to some
human ncRNA, what is aligned to the human ncRNA is
not a contiguous sequence. Instead, it is composed of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/417

sequence fragments from different regions or even different chromosomes, none of these fragments individually
passing Infernal's test of ncRNA family membership. We
call these "chimeric alignments". For 45% of these chimeric alignments, one of the aligned fragments can be
extended in its native genomic context to reveal a full
ncRNA family member that is probably the correct alignable ortholog. These improvable chimeric alignments are
compelling instances of misalignment.
2. For 5.1% of the nonhuman sequences aligned to some
human ncRNA, what is aligned includes a large gap in the
nonhuman species, and the aligned fragment by itself
again does not pass Infernal's threshold for ncRNA family
membership. We call these "partial alignments". For 26%
of these partial alignments, the fragment can be extended
in its native genomic context to reveal a full ncRNA family
member that is probably the correct alignable ortholog.
These improvable partial alignments are compelling cases
of false negative orthology predictions by the alignment
algorithm.
RNA prediction from reliable alignments
Two groups have developed RNA prediction tools using
comparative genomics methods [28,29]. The MULTIZ
whole-genome alignment of 8 vertebrate species was
used, and the segments with low phastCons [30] sequence
conservation scores and segments with too few species
were removed. This filtering process leaves a set of conserved segments spanning less than 5% of the reference
human genome. Based on the conserved segments, they
evaluated structural conservation of base-pairing patterns
and identified tens of thousands of candidate functional
RNA elements. Our goal is opposite to the goal of these
groups. They assumed the MULTIZ multiple sequence
alignment to be reliable, and used that to predict ncRNAs.
We assume that known ncRNA covariance models provide reliable alignments, and use them to evaluate the
accuracy of the MULTIZ multiple alignments in those difficult noncoding regions. Torarinsson et al. [31] discovered many conserved RNA structures in regions that
MULTIZ did not align at all, but are presumably syntenic.
UCSC genome browser and MULTIZ
The UCSC Genome Browser is a powerful web tool that
provides the reference sequence and working draft assemblies for a large collection of genomes [27]. It is a multifaceted and reliable display of any requested portion of
genomes at any scale, as well as many annotation tracks,
including assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and
expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data,
transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered
tracks.

The 17-vertebrate whole-genome alignment that we evaluate is taken from the UCSC Genome Browser database.
The 17 vertebrates of the alignment are human (hg),
chimp (panTro), rhesus monkey (rheMac), rat (rn),
mouse (mm), rabbit (oryCun), cow (bosTau), dog (canFam), armadillo (dasNov), elephant (loxAfr), tenrec (echTel), opossum (monDom), chicken (galGal), frog
(xenTro), tetraodon (tetnig), fugu (fr), and zebrafish
(danRer). Some species have not been fully sequenced or
have low sequence coverage. The 17-vertebrate wholegenome alignment (to human genome assembly NCBI
Build 36.1, UCSC hg18, March 2006) is an update and
expansion of the older 8-vertebrate alignment. It was produced by a computational pipeline including BLASTZ
[32], chaining and netting [33], and MULTIZ [12]. For the
remainder of this paper, we will refer to this computational pipeline simply as "MULTIZ". MULTIZ uses the
progressive alignment technique to align multiple
sequences, including highly rearranged or incomplete
sequences.

alignment and a threshold score are provided by Rfam.
The seed alignment and threshold are curated by experts.
Any sequence for which Infernal assigns a covariance
model score above the threshold is classified as a member
of that family. If a sequence aligned by MULTIZ to the
human ncRNA element returns a score above the threshold, we conclude that this alignment is supported by
Rfam. Otherwise, we search the nearby region of the MULTIZ alignment to look for a family member. The search
space is bounded by 5 Kb on each side of the human element or the distance to the nearest human exon on each
side, whichever is less. The motivation for this search is
that, if a local misalignment has occurred, the orthologous ncRNA family member may be in the neighborhood
of its aligned family members. We detect such an orthologous family member by using Infernal to search the neighborhood for any segment with a score above the threshold
provided by Rfam. We find the bound of 5 Kb to be sufficiently liberal: of all the family members found within a 5
Kb neighborhood, 90% are within 10 bp of the nearest
human family member, and only 8 instances (1%) are
more than 100 bp from the nearest human family member. Figure 2 is an overview of this first phase of the evaluation process. The first phase evaluation is done on all
seed alignments in Rfam, and the results are summarized
in Table 1. We extract 585 human elements from 201
ncRNA families. Of these, 172 human elements are perfectly aligned with members of the same RNA family in
every aligned species (see Figure 3). These are labeled
"perfect alignments" in Table 1. The remaining 413
imperfect alignments have at least one aligned sequence
receiving poor covariance model score, and require a
neighborhood search to the nearest human exons or the 5
Kb boundary. These are not necessarily misalignments:
many may indicate loss of an ncRNA in some species.

Results
We first extract all the human sequences in the seed alignments from the Rfam database [24,25]. These sequences
are then uploaded to the UCSC genome browser [27] to
find the chromosome number, strand, and start and end
positions of the sequences in the human genome using
the sequence alignment tool BLAT [34]. After we get the
precise locations of the sequences in the human genome,
we retrieve MULTIZ multiple alignment files with each
human Rfam sequence as the reference sequence.
We use the software package Infernal (version 0.7) to analyze each of the sequences aligned by MULTIZ to the
human ncRNA. Infernal uses covariance models for
sequence analysis of ncRNA families [26]. For each
ncRNA family, a covariance model based on the seed

The count indicates the number of human ncRNA elements and their

We find 424 human ncRNAs in the neighborhood
searches of the 413 imperfect alignments. The 11 additional human ncRNAs are elements not included in the
seed alignments, but identified by Infernal to be members
of the same ncRNA family. There are 6043 segments in
other species aligned to human ncRNAs, including the
perfect alignments in Table 1. Table 2 categorizes these as
follows:
â¢ 4025 RNA family members in other species are perfectly
aligned to human ncRNAs; that is, the segment aligned to
the human ncRNA is assigned a high covariance model
score without any neighborhood search. The rest of the
aligned segments receive low covariance model score.

â¢ For 707 segments, an Rfam member that is not perfectly
aligned to other human ncRNAs in the family can be
found in the neighborhood search. These are labeled as
shifted elements in Table 2. Figure 4 illustrates a case of a
particularly large shift in an alignment of a human
SNORD113 (C/D box small nucleolar RNA SNORD113/
SNORD114, RF00181) on chromosome 14. An RNA element in elephant (loxAfr1.scaffold 44287) is divided into
halves by the alignment, each half aligned to a different
human ncRNA. The two human ncRNAs are 1556 bp
apart. Most of the 707 shifts are very small compared to
this example.
â¢ For some species, the portion aligned to a single human
ncRNA is not a contiguous sequence. Instead, it is composed of sequence fragments from different regions or
even different chromosomes. These 328 discontiguous
segments are labeled as chimeric alignments in Table 2.
Figure 5 illustrates two examples of chimeric alignments
of a human SNORA25 (small nucleolar RNA SNORA25,
RF00402) on chromosome 7. Two sequences from different regions (dasNov1.scaffold 192792 and dasNov1.scaffold 7495) in armadillo are concatenated and aligned to a
single human ncRNA. Also, two fragments from different
chromosomes in mouse (mm8.chr13 and mm8.chr6) are
aligned to the single human ncRNA.

The count indicates the number of segments in other species aligned
to (or near) a human ncRNA. The last two columns show the number
of cases of alignments that can be improved by straightforward
realignment (see text).

â¢ Some of the segments receive low score because that species is only partially aligned to the human ncRNA. We
find 310 such partial alignments. In this case, the segment
might be a family member if the sequence were fully
aligned in that region. Figure 6 illustrates partial alignments of a human SNORA42 (small nucleolar RNA

SNORA42, RF00406) on chromosome 14. The segments
in
rabbit
(oryCun1.scaffold
201547),
tenrec
(echTel1.scaffold 205400) and elephant (loxAfr1.scaffold

ncRNA.
â¢ 4 segments appear to be possible alignment inversions:
a family member is identified on the other strand, but otherwise perfectly aligned to the human family member.
These are all tRNAs in opossum. Since the number is so
small, we will omit this category from the remaining discussion.
â¢ 669 low score segments, fully aligned and contiguous,
do not reveal a family member in the neighborhood
search regions. These may well indicate actual loss of an
ncRNA in that species rather than misalignment. Note
that this case does not include the many instances when a
species is completely absent from the alignment to the
human ncRNA.
We perform a second phase of evaluation of each partial
alignment. For each of the 310 partial alignments that
receives a low covariance model score, we extract from its

divided into halves by the alignment, shown here as the very long red rectangle, with the left half aligned to the beginning of the
second of the four human RF00181 elements shown, and the right half to the right end of the third human instance. In the
MULTIZ alignment, this appears as though it were a 1556 bp deletion in elephant, spanning from the middle of the second
human instance to the middle of the third.

Chimeric alignments
Chimeric alignments. This figure illustrates two examples of chimeric alignments of a human SNORA25 (small nucleolar
RNA SNORA25, RF00402) on chromosome 7. a. Two pieces of sequences from two different scaffolds (dasNov1.scaffold
192792 and dasNov1.scaffold 7495, the two rows directly below the red rectangles) in armadillo are concatenated and aligned
to the human ncRNA. However, when we extract a longer sequence from the genome at the position of the first fragment,
dasNov1.scaffold 192792, the aligned fragment can be extended to a member of the small nucleolar RNA SNORA25 family. b.
Two pieces of sequences from two different chromosomes in mouse (mm8.chr13 and mm8.chr6, the next two rows below
armadillo) are aligned to the same human ncRNA. The first fragment, if extended, is also a member in the family. Note that neither armadillo nor mouse show a red rectangle, since these chimeric alignments score below the covariance model threshold.
The thin horizontal lines show which regions of that species are included in the alignment.

genome the original aligned segment plus 200 bp
upstream and 200 bp downstream. (Note that this contextual sequence may not even be aligned by MULTIZ.) We
use Infernal to search for a family member in this contiguous 400+ bp sequence that includes the fragment MULTIZ had aligned to the human ncRNA. In 79 of the 310
cases, we succeed in finding such a family member. As an
example, in Figure 6, the segments in rabbit
(oryCun1.scaffold 201547), tenrec (echTel1.scaffold
205400) and elephant (loxAfr1.scaffold 38492) all
receive scores above the threshold of this family if
extended.

A similar process is applied to each of the 328 chimeric
alignments we find in the first phase of evaluation. We
extract from its genome the chimeric fragments aligned to
human ncRNAs, plus 200 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream of each fragment. This results in at least two 400+
bp sequences. In total, we find that family members could
be restored in 146 of the 328 chimeric alignments by this
simple process. For example, in Figure 5, for the species
armadillo, when we extract a longer sequence from the
genome at the position of the first fragment,
dasNov1.scaffold 192792, this fragment extends to
become a family member. For mouse, the extended
sequence of the fragment in mm8.chr13 is also a member
in the family.

Figure 6
Partial alignments
Partial alignments. This figure illustrates partial alignments of a human SNORA42 (small nucleolar RNA SNORA42,
RF00406) on chromosome 14. The segments in rabbit (oryCun1.scaffold 201547), tenrec (echTel1.scaffold 205400) and elephant (loxAfr1.scaffold 38492) appear to be partially aligned to the human ncRNA. These segments all receive scores above the
threshold for this family if extended. Note that the partially aligned sequences score below the threshold, as indicated by the
absence of red rectangles. Note also that the cow sequence in this alignment (bosTau2.chr2) is categorized as a shifted element
in Table 2. The thin horizontal lines show which regions of that species are included in the alignment.

We next categorize the aligned segments of Table 2 by species. The results are shown in Figure 7. For each species,
the bars show the percent of aligned segments for that species in each of the five categories of Table 2 (omitting
inversions because of the small number). The number
next to the species name is the number of alignments in
which that species is included.

Our results are roughly consistent with those of Prakash
and Tompa [13], who used entirely different methods to
assess whole-genome alignment accuracy, based on the
statistical theory of Karlin and Altschul [22]. Like us, they
found that MULTIZ generally was quite accurate at aligning orthologous sequences, but they also identified
approximately 10% of MULTIZ's human chromosome 1
alignment to be suspiciously aligned.

Discussion
MULTIZ does a fairly accurate job of aligning the vertebrate genomes in the ncRNA regions, particularly given
the challenging nature of correctly aligning these elements. 66.6% of the elements aligned by MULTIZ to
human ncRNA have a high covariance model score. These
are very likely to be true positives of the alignment
method. Conversely, only the large shifts, the 328 chimeric alignments, and the 79 improvable partial alignments are strong candidates as false positives and false
negatives of the alignment method. These total approximately 7% of the elements aligned by MULTIZ to human
ncRNA. Our results also suggest ways to improve some of
the imperfect alignments.

Comparing our findings to those of Brudno et al. [14] on
the 1 Mb CFTR region, their multiple alignment tool MLAGAN perfectly aligned at least 94% of the human coding
exons to the orthologous exons in each of 8 other mammalian genomes. This gives support to the belief that
ncRNA elements are more difficult targets for accurate
multiple alignment than coding exons are. Margulies et al.
[3] performed similar experiments on the ENCODE
regions, but reported much lower accuracy in aligning
coding exons for the four multiple alignment algorithms
they tested, TBA, MLAGAN, MAVID, and PECAN. Possible
explanations for their lower accuracy include the following:

Categorization of aligned segments by species
Categorization of aligned segments by species. For each species, the bars show the percent of aligned segments for that
species in each of the categories of Table 2. The number next to the species name is the number of alignments in which that
species is included.
1. The CFTR region is nicely syntenic, with few duplications, in the aligned species, whereas most of the
ENCODE regions are not as well conserved.
2. The quality of exon annotation in the ENCODE regions
was not as high as that in the CFTR region, which has
received more attention.
3. Some species had not yet been sequenced in a particular
ENCODE region, or its sequence was not chosen in
ENCODE's orthology prediction phase.
4. The MLAGAN alignment of the CFTR region was of 12
species, whereas the ENCODE alignments were of 28 species, which is more challenging.
If the procedures we described for testing ncRNA alignment accuracy were to be repeated for whole-genome

alignments produced by other tools such as MLAGAN,
MAVID, and PECAN, we predict that the results would be
comparable to what we reported in Table 2 and Figure 7.
We do not believe any of our results to be peculiar to
MULTIZ. Instead, we believe that they illustrate an inherent difficulty in aligning ncRNA for any alignment
method that relies on primary sequence alone. However,
Margulies et al. [3] reported a surprising level of discrepancy among the four alignments they tested, with MAVID
generally demonstrating somewhat lower sensitivity and
specificity than that of the other methods, so we would
certainly expect some similar amount of variance in the
accuracy of ncRNA alignment.
Our assessment of alignment accuracy is only as good as
Infernal's predictions. If the covariance model is inaccurate in certain instances, our assessment may be inaccurate
as well. However, since the covariance model incorporates

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:417

secondary structure, we trust that it is a reliable guide to
the correct alignment of ncRNA.
In 11.7% of the aligned segments that we inspect, we find
that the nearest family member in the other species is
shifted from the human element. Most of these shifts
seem rather small, and so represent minor misalignment
or may not represent misalignment at all. For instance,
90% of these 707 shifted elements have both ends within
10 bp of the aligned human family member. It is worth
noting, however, that even small misalignments may have
adverse effects on some downstream analyses.
Our experiments reveal that in 5.4% of the cases, MULTIZ
aligns discontiguous fragments to one human ncRNA,
and it is likely to be quite misleading to draw any biological inferences from such chimeric alignments. Further
analysis suggests that 44.5% of the chimeric alignments
could be improved to family members by extending one
of the fragments and aligning the extended piece to the
human element. These improvable chimeric alignments
are compelling instances of misalignment.
We also observe 5.1% of the cases to be partial alignments. These partial alignments fail to reveal a complete
aligned RNA element. 25.5% of these partial alignments
can be improved to family members by extending the
aligned fragment. These improvable partial alignments
are compelling cases of false negative orthology predictions by the alignment algorithm.
Washietl et al. [29] and Pedersen et al. [28] both use the
MULTIZ whole-genome alignment to predict RNA secondary structures. The accuracy of their tools largely
depends on the accuracy of the multiple alignment. Their
results may be subject to false negative predictions due to
various types of misalignments described above. Focusing
on the highly conserved regions identified by the phastCons method, as they did, may have reduced the incidence of these misalignments since the regions where
MULTIZ is likely to align imperfectly are often regions that
are not highly conserved. On the other hand, such a strict
selection likely causes them to miss many interesting candidates [31] while providing incomplete protection
against alignment errors: phastCons was never intended
as a method for measuring alignment correctness. Indeed,
its purpose is to measure conservation, assuming that the
alignment correctly aligns orthologous sites. Prakash and
Tompa [13] have shown that misalignment of one
sequence can often be found even in regions where phastCons scores are very high due to strong conservation in
the remaining sequences.
There are 11.1% of the alignments that receive low covariance model score, but we do not find any better candi-

date in the neighborhood of the alignment. We do not
have enough evidence to classify this type of alignment. It
could be caused by loss of ncRNA element in that species,
failure of the covariance model (e.g., an excessively restrictive family model or score threshold), or misalignment by
MULTIZ.
Looking at Figure 7, there are some fairly clear trends in
the alignments as we move farther from human in the
phylogeny. The primates, not surprisingly, are extremely
well aligned to human. The remaining mammals have a
very similar breakdown to each other according to the five
categories of alignment (with the possible exception of
opossum, which looks more like chicken). Somewhat surprisingly, there seem to be no qualitative differences distinguishing the low-coverage assemblies rabbit,
armadillo, elephant, and tenrec from the other nonprimate mammals. The remaining, more distantly related
vertebrates show a decrease in the percent of perfectly
aligned segments and a commensurate increase in the percent of partial alignments and possible losses of ncRNA as
we move farther from human.
Many of the vertebrate instances of ncRNA elements discovered by our procedure are not included in Rfam. In
theory, the Rfam staff could find all these instances (and
many more) by running Infernal on each of the vertebrate
genomes individually, ignoring alignment. However, it
currently requires approximately one month using 1000
computers to approximate this Infernal search on their 8
Gb database. It is clearly impractical to extend this to all
17 sequenced vertebrates, and the gap is rapidly widening
because of newly sequenced genomes. As an alternative,
we propose using whole-genome alignment and lists of
human ncRNAs from Rfam, restricting Infernal's search
for family members to the sequences aligned to the
human ncRNAs and their immediate neighborhoods.
Although not exhaustive, our procedure provides an efficient and effective method for predicting ncRNA family
members in newly sequenced genomes. By using wholegenome alignments in conjunction with Infernal as
described, we exploit orthology and synteny with two
good effects: (1) the search is made efficient by limiting it
to the most promising regions suggested by the alignment
and (2) the alignment adds extra evidence to Infernal's
predictions, likely decreasing the incidence of false positives.

Methods
Visualization tool
All alignments and Infernal results are available for viewing [35] using GMAJ [36], which was used to produce the
images in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6. GMAJ is a tool for viewing and
manipulating multiple sequence alignments. It offers a
coloring feature for both the interactive graphical and text

representation of the alignments. We use this feature to
color all ncRNA elements, as well as the regions aligned to
human ncRNA elements. The regions with a covariance
model score above and within ten bits of the threshold are
colored pink. Regions that receive a covariance model
score above the threshold plus ten bits are colored red.
Regions with a covariance model score below and within
ten bits of the threshold are colored dark gray. Regions
with a covariance model score below the threshold minus
10 bits but above 0 are colored light gray. The first row displays tick marks corresponding to the positions in the
human reference sequence.
