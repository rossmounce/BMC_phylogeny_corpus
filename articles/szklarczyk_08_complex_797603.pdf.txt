Abstract
Background: Thanks to recent high coverage mass-spectrometry studies and reconstructed
protein complexes, we are now in an unprecedented position to study the evolution of biological
systems. Gene duplications, known to be a major source of innovation in evolution, can now be
readily examined in the context of protein complexes.
Results: We observe that paralogs operating in the same complex fulfill different roles: mRNA
dosage increase for more than a hundred cytosolic ribosomal proteins, mutually exclusive
participation of at least 54 paralogs resulting in alternative forms of complexes, and 24 proteins
contributing to bona fide structural growth. Inspection of paralogous proteins participating in two
independent complexes shows that an ancient, pre-duplication protein functioned in both multiprotein assemblies and a gene duplication event allowed the respective copies to specialize and split
their roles.
Conclusion: Variants with conditionally assembled, paralogous subunits likely have played a role
in yeast's adaptation to anaerobic conditions. In a number of cases the gene duplication has given
rise to one duplicate that is no longer part of a protein complex and shows an accelerated rate of
evolution. Such genes could provide the raw material for the evolution of new functions.

Background
Gene duplication can be a major source of innovation in
evolution [1], providing redundancy and additional
genetic material to build upon and differentiate. In general, eukaryotic genomes contain a large fraction of gene
duplicates, with paralogs stemming not only from single
gene or segmental duplications, but, in the case of S. cerevisiae, also from a Whole-Genome Duplication event that
occurred approximately 100 mln years ago (WGD; [2,3]).
Genomic instability and massive gene loss promptly followed WGD and purged most of the newly formed gene
copies from the yeast genome, retaining approximately

10% of them [3]. Today, using multiple genomes of
related fungal species with conserved synteny, we can
unambiguously identify hundreds of gene pairs as WGD
paralogs [4] in addition to normal small scale paralogs.
The identification of paralogs of WGD origin, in conjunction with the wealth of data on physical protein interactions and derived maps of protein complexes, puts us in
an unprecedented position to test the fate of nascent
duplicated genes and to potentially identify cases of duplication of whole complexes. Recently, it has been shown
that, after gene duplication, protein interactions can be

conserved [5,6]. The data suggested that there exists a stepwise pathway of evolution for such functional modules
[6], with duplications of homomeric interactions known
to have a significant influence on the evolution of genes
[5]. Moreover, it is known that gene duplicates can be
found less often among the core components of protein
complexes compared to sparse regions of protein interaction network [7]. For our study of the impact of gene
duplication on protein complexes, we separated paralogs
into two distinct, non-overlapping classes: genes that were
duplicated at the WGD event, and non-WGD duplicates
detectable by sequence similarity. Dubbed small scale
duplications (SSD), these paralogs are the result of the
most recent gene duplications, identified per event by
employing a best bi-directional hit criterion on all yeast
gene pairs (see Methods). From the analysis of the phylogenetic distribution and number of paralogs in related
species, it appears that the time of duplication of SSD
genes greatly predates the WGD event (see Methods).
Both duplication types, WGD and SSD, cover together
~40% of yeast genes, providing a comprehensive overview
of these evolutionary events. These two paralog types are
already known to differ with respect to their expression
pattern [8,9] and synthetic lethality rate [10], by displaying different phenotypic effects when deleted [11] and
occurrence across functional classes (e.g., stress responsive
genes, [8]). Musso and colleagues [9] show that nearly
half of WGD paralogs co-cluster in the same protein complex. Amoutzias and colleagues [12] indicate that whole
genome duplication did not change the dimerization specificities of interacting homologs. Here, we show a much
more detailed spectrum of evolutionary and functional
fates of higher order protein complex subunits. This integrated overview, enables us to quantify the fates with
respect to the duplication type and address questions
related to protein specialization (subfunctionalization),
as well as the emergence of novel functions related to
complexes (neofunctionalization).
Our hypotheses were tested on various types of manually
curated data: both complexes from MIPS consortium [13],
and those annotated by SGD [14]. To avoid a possible
bias introduced by manual curation, we also use computationally derived maps of complexes [15,16], reconstruction of which was possible owing to recent massspectrometry studies [17,18]. Integration of these datasets
allowed us to systematically study the fates of all gene
duplicates which are involved in protein complexes.

Results
The fates of duplicate genes in complexes
We carried out a systematic analysis of the fate of paralogs
in protein complexes. From our first observations it
became clear that the cytosolic ribosomal complex dominates the whole spectrum of gene duplications. In order to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/337

prevent this single protein complex to dominate our
results, we analyze it separately (see Methods). The fates
of other paralogs found within complexes fall into two
other categories (Figure 1 and 2). Intra-complex paralogs
(I) that are formed when both resulting genes remain
within the same protein complex, whereas bi-complex
paralogs (II) function within two separate complexes. The
third class, which we define as overhangs (III), consists of
subunits of complexes with a paralog possessing no association to a known protein complex whatsoever. SSD and
WGD paralogs are equally divided over intra-complex and
overhang classes, but differ with respect to the bi-complex
class: many more SSD paralogs are present in two complexes compared to WGD paralogs (Figure 2b). We discuss this observation below.
Intra-complex paralogs: retention is an important fate of
paralogs within complexes
We observe a very strong preference for both duplicated
proteins to function in the same module. Compared to a
null model, where proteins are stochastically reshuffled
between complexes, intra-complex paralogs are ~40-fold
overrepresented (SGD modules, [14]). This preference is
similar, and not statistically different for both duplication
types (P = 0.97, chi-square test) and holds for other module definitions, including the computationally derived
protein complexes from complex co-purification experiments (see additional file 1, Table S1). Paralog retention
within the module is thus an important factor in shaping
the map of protein complexes.

We thus recover the previously made observation that
WGD and SSD paralogs are known to act within the ancestral protein complex after the duplication [7,8]. Further
analysis however revealed a wider spectrum of fates in
which two paralogs can be involved in a single protein
complex, as illustrated in the analysis of the essential yeast
chromatin remodeling complex RSC. Owing to the availability of protein-protein interaction data [17,18] we can
distinguish between different modes of participation in a
single complex. The first, a more "direct" bait-prey interaction mode, occurs when one protein was designated a
bait and the other protein co-purified as a prey; this event
is characterized by a high spoke value [17]. The second
type of interaction, a prey-prey interaction, can be
detected when two prey proteins were co-purified with the
same bait in two independent purification experiments
and does not provide the evidence for the two proteins to
co-occur in the same protein complex at a given time.
Hence, we were able to specify the following intra-complex fates:
Ia. mRNA dosage effect
Undoubtedly, the single most abundant fate of paralogs is
the mRNA dosage increase of cytosolic ribosomal proteins

by homogenizing gene conversion events. b) Impact of duplicated proteins on complexes. Intra-complex duplications include
dosage increase, interacting homologs and module variants. Dosage increase requires many components of the complex to
duplicate simultaneously (as in the case of cRP and the whole genome duplication). For interacting homologs, the two duplicated proteins become physically subunits of the complex (e.g., homomers turning into heterodimers after the duplication). In
module variants only one of the two paralogs is present in the protein complex at a given time. Bi-complex paralogs operate in
different protein complexes; two possible evolutionary routes are shown. Overhangs do not aggregate with other proteins in a
non-transient manner, while their paralogs do.

(CRPs), as more than half of 200 intra-complex proteins
are CRPs (see Table 1 and Methods for details). Their
coordinate expression is primarily accomplished at the
transcriptional level [19], signified by high expression correlation between the paralogs (our results show Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.8). It is a markedly
different type of evolutionary innovation from other
classes, as paralogous CRPs, due to undergoing gene con-

version [20], are highly similar in their protein sequence
(see Methods).
Ib. Interacting homologs
This subclass consists of paralogs both present in a protein
complex at the same time. Using protein-protein interaction data we identified 24 intra-complex paralogs with a
bait-prey interaction type, signified by a high spoke value

of least 5 (see Methods for details). This class is exemplified by the RSC3/RSC30 pair from RSC chromatin remodeling complex, known to form a stable heterodimer [21].
This kind of relationship between paralogs is likely to
result from an ancestral homodimer, where a paralogous

replacement of the dimer's components took place [5].
Strong positive co-expression (Spearman's correlation
coefficient of 0.4), even though weaker than the tightly
co-regulated CRPs, provides additional clues for simultaneous presence of both proteins in the functional module.

Homomers undergoing this evolutionary route are probably the classic view on how two paralogs are involved in
the same protein complex, as exemplified by the F1ATPase alpha and beta subunits [22].

Table 2: Type of intra-complex paralogs and viability of singlegene knockouts in rich medium.

The literature provides many tantalizing clues to the conditions in which these alternative assemblies (module variants) may operate. For example, the WGD paralogs
TPK1/TPK3 have a negatively correlated co-expression
(Spearman's correlation coefficient -0.3), although they
are both part of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase complex. Glucose-induced hyperaccumulation of cAMP was
observed in exponential-phase glucose-grown cells of the
TPK1-deficient but not the TPK3-deficient strain [24].
Moreover, investigation of mitochondrial respiration by
in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
showed the tpk1- and not tpk3-mutant, to be defective in
glucose repression [24]. Another clue hinting at specialization for carbon source utilization comes from the WGD
paralogs COX5a/COX5b. The two subunits are encoded
by divergent sequences, but are functionally interchangeable forms of yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit V [25].
COX5a/COX5b paralogs are oppositely regulated (Spearman's expression correlation -0.3) and are known to be
expressed in a mutually exclusive manner under aerobic
(COX5a) and anaerobic conditions (COX5b) [26]. Taking
all module variants together, we observe their enrichment
among WGD paralogs (P < 0.02) and also module variants are 2.5 less likely to be essential when considering
viability of single-gene knockouts (P < 0.01, Table 2). This
apparent redundancy of module variants in rich medium
does not exclude their possible contribution to cell's sur-

Ic. Module variants
This perhaps somewhat less explicitly recognized category
embraces paralogs with a seemingly intrinsic contradiction: operating within the same "complex", yet never
present together with only a prey-prey evidence for their
interaction. Such mutually exclusive presence implies
existence of different variants of the same complex. To
assign proteins to the module variants class, we select
intra-complex paralogs with no evidence of direct interaction. That includes paralogs never purified together, or
with a negative spoke value (see Methods for details). Our
analysis yields 54 intra-complex paralogs that belong to
this class. Lower co-expression of these genes, likely resulting from the functional role undertaken by paralogs, confirms that these subunits are alternatively present in a
module, thus not required to operate simultaneously
(average co-expression Spearman's correlation 0.2, statistically different from other classes, one sided Wilcoxon
ranked sum test, P < 0.02). More divergent expression also
suggests a mechanism of control of complex activity by
conditional assembly (analogous to just-in-time assembly
for cell cycle complexes, [23]).

vival in other growth media. To test this hypothesis we
analyzed the data on growth rates of yeast deletion
mutants in nine fermentable and non-fermentable substrates [27]. 12 module variants and none of interacting
homologs show differential and partly complementary
pattern of growth rates in various carbon sources (Table
3). Additionally, phenotype of single-gene deletions of
module variants does not correlate between paralogs
(average correlation coefficient ~0.1) when tested in hundreds chemical and environmental stress conditions [28].
Together, all this evidence leads us to suggest that the
WGD event might have facilitated the evolution of anaerobic fermentation in S. cerevisiae via introduction of many
specialized module variants.
Bi-complex paralogs: proteins functioning in different
complexes
As opposed to intra-complex paralogs, where both proteins function in the same module, bi-complex paralogs
each participate in distinct ones. Depending on the map
of protein complexes, 44 or more genes fall into this category (see Table 1 and additional file 1, Table S2). We confirmed the lack of interaction between this type of
paralogs with protein-complex purification data (only
two out of 31 pairs were ever purified together, significantly less than intra-complex paralogs, Fisher exact test P
< 4e-5, odds ratio 15).

Interestingly, for bi-complex paralogs, a significant difference between WGD and SSD duplicates can be seen. The
majority of them are SSD duplicates (see additional file 1,
Table S2). This strong bias, with SSD constituting more
than 80% of the bi-complex class, contrasts with handful
of WGD paralogs split between different complexes. We
propose this to be an effect associated with the age of
duplication. The lion's share of SSD paralogs not only predate the WGD event but are older than the divergence
with S. pombe. While none of the eight post-S. pombe SSD
duplications is bi-complex, three duplications are intracomplex (see additional file 1, Table S5), a hint that not
the type of duplication (SSD versus WGD), but its age has
a greater influence on the paralog's fate. Over extended
evolutionary time since the ancient duplication of major-

ity of SSD paralogs, many specialized (subfunctionalization), join or even established a new complex
(neofunctionalization), ultimately leading to the bi-complex relationship. The conservative nature of interaction
evolution after gene duplication is confirmed by the
underrepresentation of bi-complex paralogs, compared to
a null model where proteins are free to change their complex following the duplication (Table 1 and additional file
1, Table S2).
What evolutionary route would lead to the emergence of
bi-complex paralogs? Two possible scenarios are shown in
Figure 3a. Unfortunately, we do not have a map of protein
complexes prior to gene duplications and we have to rely
on the indirect evidence of ancestral state. Manual inspection of the five cases of WGD bi-complex paralogs indicates that their complexes overlap (e.g. still posses shared
subunits) and the bi-complex paralogs tend to show some
genetic redundancy. For example, the DPB4 subunit
shared between epsilon DNA Polymerase and CHRAC
complexes (see Figure 3b), is indication that before the
WGD event the ancestral DPB3/DLS1 subunit functioned,
similarly, in the two complexes (see additional file 1,
"Tracing evolutionary past of paralogs"). Based on these
clues we conclude that the most common evolutionary
scenario for bi-complex paralogs is as follows: a single
ancestral protein operated in two independent complexes
and a duplication event allowed the respective copies to
specialize and split their roles. This preferred route would
be an indication of subfunctionalization, rather than of
neofunctionalization.
Examples of whole-complex duplications
A dramatic result of numerous bi-complex duplications
could be a duplication of a whole complex. Particularly, a
whole-genome duplication, by simultaneous duplication
of all subunits, provides the necessary material to make a
"carbon copy" of complexes. Instead, we observed a statistical under-representation of bi-complex paralogs. Never-

theless, single events of whole-complex duplication can
be identified. For example, the farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase complexes both consists of two
subunits: RAM1-RAM2 and BET2-BET4 respectively, originating as ancient, pre-WGD duplications of RAM1/BET2
and RAM2/BET4 ancestral genes. Although it is not know
which was the original complex (or whether the ancestral
complex served both functions) this suggests that two
stepwise small-scale duplications occurred, ultimately
copying the whole complex that went on to evolve distinct
functions (see Figure 4a).
Another case of whole-complex duplication involves a
three-protein Sec61 complex (also referred to as a translocon, Figure 4b). This essential complex forms a channel in
the ER membrane and mediates translocation of secretory
and membrane proteins into the ER and also retrograde
transport of misfolded proteins to the cytoplasm for degradation [29,30]. The complex has duplicated in the
course of evolution to form an Ssh1 translocon complex
[31]. The Ssh1 complex, a result of small scale duplications, also functions in co-translational import to the
endoplasmic reticulum (an essential paralogous subunit
Sec61p plays a post-translational role as well), and is
required for normal growth rates.
Overhangs â lone paralogs
The final class of paralogs are overhangs, proteins without
an association to a functional module, but with a paralog
known to be involved in a protein complex (Figure 1). For
SGD protein complexes, we found 58 such proteins, with
no significant difference in contributions of WGD and
SSD duplication types for most of the protein complex
maps (see additional file 1, Table S3). Validation with TAP
protein complex purification data shows virtually no association of overhangs with their paralog's module (average
interaction spoke value for overhangs is 0.06 compared to
2.6 for their "in-module" partners). Additionally, compared to their paralogs, less functional data about over-

hangs is available. Perhaps predictably, 11/58 overhangs
genes are unnamed genes (i.e. not described in a scientific
publication), compared to all of their paralogs being
named (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01). Naming roughly
reflects the state of our knowledge about the gene, and we
further observe absence of annotation in Molecular Function (P < 0.02) and Biological Process (P < 0.01) classes of
GO.
To further validate the role overhangs play in the cellular
processes we counted the essential genes (inviable null
mutants) among them. Even after excluding unnamed
genes from this analysis, we have only 4/48 essential overhangs, compared to 17/58 of their in-module paralogs
(Fisher's exact test P < 0.01, odds ratio 4.5). This corroborates with the hypothesis of Hart et al. [15] that essentiality is a product of the protein complex, rather than the
individual protein. We conclude that overhangs play a
much less important role in cell biology, at least in the
rich medium conditions in which most of the functional
studies are performed.
We observed that overhangs are less constrained by evolution on the sequence level. For WGD overhangs, we compared amino acid identity levels of paralogs against their
Kluyveromyces waltii ortholog (there is a single ortholog in
K. waltii, as this species diverged before the WGD event).
The amino acid sequence of overhangs diverges signifi-

cantly faster compared to their in-module paralogs (34%
vs 40% global amino acid identity, one sided paired Wilcoxon signed rank test P < 0.02). We therefore conclude
that being a part of the protein complex imposes certain
constraints on divergence, and the process of orphaning
coincides with an increased rate of sequence evolution.
A higher rate of protein sequence evolution and almost
complete loss of interactions with an ancestral protein
complex are manifestations of rapid functional divergence. The orphaned proteins are involved in different cellular processes: e.g., an overhang SSD1 (suppressor of
SIT4 deletion, YDR293C), interacts with a TOR pathway,
and functions in sustaining cell wall integrity [32], while
its paralog DIS3 is a catalytic component of exosome [33],
also involved in mitotic control [34]. We measured the
degree of function divergence of overhangs and their paralogs. Using semantic similarity based on Gene Ontologies (see Methods), genes were assigned values between 0
(for different function) and 1 (highly similar or identical
function). We observe a rapid divergence of functionality
for overhangs (additional file 1, Figure S1). This analysis
hints to the overhangs as one of nature's methods to gene
neofunctionalization.

Discussion and conclusion
For the paralogs participating in different complexes (bicomplex paralogs), we see a quantitative difference

Page 8 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:337

between duplicates of different age, with only a minority
of bi-complex paralogs stemming from WGD. We
attribute the higher representation of SSD paralogs to the
time of the duplication. The mixture of functional data
and the knowledge of their evolutionary history enabled
us to reconstruct the evolutionary past of WGD paralogs.
As bi-complex paralogs might have potentially undergone
either neo- or subfunctionalization (see Figure 3a), we
suggest, based on the examination of the association
between complexes, that bi-complex paralogs could be
examples of function specialization in the protein interaction network.
As observed in [8] there is no overrepresentation of whole
modules being duplicated at the WGD event. A massive
duplication is a unique opportunity for an organism to
replicate components of its cellular machinery (e.g., protein complexes) and let it subsequently evolve independently, with each complex following its own evolutionary
path. And even though it appears that gene pairs [35] and
transcriptional network show features of partitioning into
heavily intra-connected, but sparsely inter-connected clusters [36] at the protein complex level we did not observe
large-scale duplications. Is it maybe that the ancestor of S.
cerevisiae around 100 mln years ago had a chance to duplicate complexes as a whole, but missed the unique opportunity? Certainly the case of cytoplasmic ribosomes is an
example of the ancestral yeast cell taking advantage of
WGD event and doubling the subunit count in this protein complex. In fact, the completeness of the duplication
of the cytoplasmic ribosome (both the small and large
subunit) allowed the cell to maintain required equimolar
concentrations of CRPs [37,38] while doubling the gene
repertoire, a goal not attainable by stepwise module
growth and multiple small duplications.
Many parallel functional modules has been identified
across all life kingdoms, including helicases and heat
shock proteins in yeast [39]. Nevertheless, the absence of
complete complex duplication at the WGD event (with a
notable exception of CRPs) indicates that a stepwise
duplication of modules [6], rather than whole-complex
duplications, is a major mode of protein complex evolution in eukaryotes. Subunit-by-subunit module expansions amend the cellular machinery with the introduction
of module variants. Subsequent duplications may give rise
to bi-complex paralogs, which can be seen as intermediate
phases on the evolutionary path leading to whole-complex duplication (see Figure 5). The process may be
accompanied by attachment of additional subunits to one
of the complexes or a differential loss of existing ones.
In eukaryotes a single protein events (loss, duplication or
gain) dominate the evolution of functional modules.
Even though here we do not quantify the prokaryote/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/337

eukaryote difference, scientific literature indicates that
multiple copies of a protein complex can be found in bacteria. In the case of Complex I submodules, homologs of
some of the recruited proteins already performed a function together previous to their involvement in the new
pathway, and were duplicated in parallel of shortly after
each other. This type of modular evolution in prokaryotes
includes a duplication of, sometimes sizable, complexes:
we know that a formate hydrogenlyase complex (FHL) of
E. coli is in close evolutionary relation to Complex I [40].
Additionally, a duplication-prone FHL complex can be
found in two copies in E. coli (FHL-1 and FHL-2), differing
by only three subunits [41]. This observations lead to the
hypothesis that appearance of copies of protein complexes in prokaryotes may be associated with the operon
structure. The whole module encoded by an operon could
duplicate by means of a single, segmental duplication.
Alternatively, related complexes could evolve independently in different bacterial species and then be brought
together by the horizontal gene transfer of the whole
operon. Either way separate, independently functioning
copy of a module could, for example, become recruited as
a submodule of a bigger protein complex [42]. Interestingly, both E. coli FHL complexes are encoded by two
operons, Hyf and Hyc [41].
RSC is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex
of S. cerevisiae, essential for mitotic growth [43], that
plays a role in expression regulation by activating and
repressing the transcription [21]. This single complex
exemplifies almost all aforementioned fates awaiting
duplicated proteins (see Figure 6 and Table 4).
Overhangs do not, unlike their paralogs, participate in a
protein complex. Direct interaction data confirm that
overhangs do not seem to be associated with their paralog's protein complex. In our opinion features such as
lower fraction of essential proteins or faster sequence evolution, make overhangs likely to be cases of neofunctionalization, initially working under relaxed evolutionary
constraints. We hypothesize that overhangs released from
the control of the ancestral protein complex, which are
not purged from the genome (such as aforementioned
SSD1/DIS3 pair), may form "seeds" for emerging complexes. This, accompanied with draft of additional subunits may to form novel complexes and ultimately become
more embedded in the core cellular machinery.

Methods
WGD, SSD gene sets and the assessment of the age of
duplications
WGD paralogs, genes that duplicated at the time of wholegenome duplication were taken from [4]. SSD paralogs
(Small Scale Duplications) represent the most recent,
non-WGD gene duplications. The SSD list consists of best

A possible evolutionary scenario for incremental duplication of whole complexes
A possible evolutionary scenario for incremental duplication of whole complexes. a) Ancestral three-subunit protein complex before duplications. b) Intra-complex duplication, gives rise to paralogous proteins, mutually exclusive as a part of
the complex. Two module variants arise, with either A' or A" as one of subunits. c) Another intra-complex duplication makes
possible assembly of up to four distinct module variants. d) Paralogs co-evolve to work together, specializing to accept only
one of the interacting paralogs. This gives rise to more accentuated module variants, which now can be interpreted as separate
complexes with a shared subunit. e) Eventually, all subunits may get duplicated, creating two independent protein complexes.

bi-directional hits, i.e., gene pairs (A, B), such that their
alignment score is higher than alignments of A against any
other gene in the genome, and higher than alignment of B
with any other gene in the genome (self-alignments
excluding). 87% of WGD genes pass the criterion of best
bi-directional similarity and were excluded from the SSD
dataset.
WGD and SSD types of paralogs both stem from the most
recent duplication of a given gene. To determine whether
SSD duplications preceded or followed the WGD event, it

is enough to assess the phylogenetic distribution of paralogs in multiple fungi species. Using orthology data from
[44] we established that SSD paralogs were present in two
copies before the ancestor of yeast underwent the WGD
event. More specifically, the analysis of the fungal gene
trees [8] shows that among SSD paralogs which participate in complexes, out of 84 pairs only a single gene pair
duplicated after the WGD event (RSC30/YHR054C) and
only for eight SSD paralog pairs gene trees imply duplication after the divergence with S. pombe (see additional file
1, Table S5 and Methods).

Figure 6 protein complex (right)
between complexes' components together with the related SWI/SNF complex (left) exhibit intricate homologous relationships
The RSC
The RSC protein complex (right) together with the related SWI/SNF complex (left) exhibit intricate homologous relationships between complexes' components. SWI/SNF and RSC complexes share 3 common proteins (ARP7,
ARP9, RTT102). Additional three genes from each complex are paralogs (dashed lines), suggesting series of duplications (this
includes a WGD pair RSC6-SNF12). For these bi-complex paralogs, it is very likely that the pre-duplication/ancestral forms of
these genes were participating in both complexes, and the duplication event allowed paralogs to assume more specific roles in
either complex. Zinc-cluster domain containing RSC3 and RSC30 are paralogs found in RSC complexes in equal proportions
[43] and are known to interact physically, forming a stable heteromeric complex [21]. Despite operating as a heterodimer
(possibly within the RSC complex as well), the two genes have different functions, with only RSC3 being an essential gene. The
intra-complex paralog pair originated at the WGD event. At a given time, both proteins can be found in the complex, hence
increase the subunit count by one above the initial complex, given that the ancestral interaction was probably a homomeric
one. RSC1 and RSC2 (WGD paralogs), associate with the complex in a mutually exclusive manner [47] (confirmed by a low
spoke value of 2.1 compared to average 5.0 for other subunits). Strains deficient in either RSC1 or RSC2 do not display significant growth deficiency, while synthetic lethality of paralogs suggests a certain degree of function redundancy [47]. A similar, but
non-identical function of the two paralogs is revealed by differences in phenotypes of yeast strains with RSC1 (growth deficiency in hydroxyurea) or RSC2 deletions (temperature sensitive, [47]). Both complexes are required for certain functions
such as proper expression of mid-late sporulation specific genes (e.g. spore wall formation), yet distinctly required, and specialized, for other operations [48]. The two module variants can be seen as a remarkable example of subfunctionalization.

Ribosomal paralogs
From the initial analysis of our dataset of paralogs, it is
apparent that genes involved in translation followed a distinct evolutionary route. Indeed, it is known from the literature that ribosomal protein sequences are highly
constrained and many of the ribosomal protein pairs
show exceptionally high levels of identity, likely subject to
periodic gene conversion [20]. Interestingly, almost all
cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (CRPs), in a stark contrast
to mitochondrial RP, were retained in duplicate after the
WGD event. What could be the raison d'Ãªtre this massive
duplication? The set of CRP paralogs has many distinguishing properties, such as (a) a very similar amino acid
sequence to paralogs, (b) a high mRNA expression correlation between paralogs (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.8, see Methods for details), (c) the whole
functional class, with few exceptions, was duplicated at
WGD. These features imply a low level of functional differentiation and possibly an mRNA dosage increase as an
explanation for the retention of both duplicates in CRPs,
although new provocative evidence suggests more functional divergence than expected [45]. Nevertheless, such
"Whole Ribosome Duplication" may signify the role the
WGD event played in the evolution of anaerobic fermentation in yeast (compare with mitochondrial RP, additional file 1, Table S4).

Expression data were taken from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database [46] of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), downloaded on 21
December 2006. Only multi-array datasets were considered, resulting in 357 microarray samples from 12 experiments, subsequently normalized (see additional file 1,
Methods). We used Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to calculate the degree of co-expression between all
gene pairs.
