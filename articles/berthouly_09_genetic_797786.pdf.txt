Abstract
Background: Previous studies suggested that multiple domestication events in South and South-East Asia
(Yunnan and surrounding areas) and India have led to the genesis of modern domestic chickens. Ha Giang
province is a northern Vietnamese region, where local chickens, such as the H'mong breed, and wild
junglefowl coexist. The assumption was made that hybridisation between wild junglefowl and Ha Giang
chickens may have occurred and led to the high genetic diversity previously observed. The objectives of
this study were i) to clarify the genetic structure of the chicken population within the Ha Giang province
and ii) to give evidence of admixture with G. gallus. A large survey of the molecular polymorphism for 18
microsatellite markers was conducted on 1082 chickens from 30 communes of the Ha Giang province (HG
chickens). This dataset was combined with a previous dataset of Asian breeds, commercial lines and
samples of Red junglefowl from Thailand and Vietnam (Ha Noï). Measurements of genetic diversity were
estimated both within-population and between populations, and a step-by-step Bayesian approach was
performed on the global data set.
Results: The highest value for expected heterozygosity (> 0.60) was found in HG chickens and in the wild
junglefowl populations from Thailand. HG chickens exhibited the highest allelic richness (mean A = 2.9).
No significant genetic subdivisions of the chicken population within the Ha Giang province were found. As
compared to other breeds, HG chickens clustered with wild populations. Furthermore, the neighbornet
tree and the Bayesian clustering analysis showed that chickens from 4 communes were closely related to
the wild ones and showed an admixture pattern.
Conclusion: In the absence of any population structuring within the province, the H'mong chicken,
identified from its black phenotype, shared a common gene pool with other chickens from the Ha Giang
population. The large number of alleles shared exclusively between Ha Giang chickens and junglefowl, as
well as the results of a Bayesian clustering analysis, suggest that gene flow has been taking place from
junglefowl to Ha Giang chickens.

Background
Molecular tools offer a new approach to investigate both
phylogenetic relationships among the sub-species of Gallus gallus and the domestication history of the chicken.
According to previous studies of Liu et al. [1] and Kanginakudru et al. [2], all wild sub-species but one (G. g.
bankiva) appear closely related. It was concluded that
domestication had occurred independently in different
locations of Asia, involving G. g. spadiceus, G. g. jabouillei,
and G. g. murghi. Furthermore, some genetic exchanges
were shown to have occurred between G. g. murghi and
Indian domestic chickens in recent times (Kanginakudru
et al. [2]).
Granevitze et al. [3] found a very high genetic diversity in
the H'mong chicken breed raised in the northern provinces of Vietnam. The northern province of Ha Giang, at
the Chinese border (Yunnan and Guanxi provinces), is
part of the distribution area of G. gallus [1,4] but it is also
considered to be the centre of origin of the H'mong
chicken breed. In such a region, forest provides a suitable
environment for scavenging chickens, so that local chickens and wild junglefowl coexist, therefore one assumed
explanation for the high genetic diversity observed in the
H'mong chicken, was possible gene flow from wild populations to domestic chickens.
A Bayesian approach with microsatellite markers has been
shown to be useful to provide insight into chicken breed
history [5] as well as admixture between sub-species such
as taurine and zebu cattle [6,7]. In the present study, we
combined microsatellite genotypes from several datasets
to address the questions relating to (i) the genetic characteristics of domestic chickens within the Ha Giang province and (ii) possible gene flow between scavenging
chickens and wild junglefowl when distribution areas
overlap.

Methods
H'mong chickens can be identified by an extremely black
phenotype (involving skin, tarsus and bones). They are
raised together with other chickens across the province
even if they can be found with higher frequencies in a few
communes. In the present study, we carried out a large
survey collecting blood samples of 1 082 animals from 30
communes scattered over the Ha Giang (HG) province
(22°08' – 23°19' N; 104°33' – 105°33' E). Among the 11
districts, from 2 to 4 communes per district (30 in total)
and 3 to 8 villages per commune (190 in total) were surveyed. Sampling included chickens showing either the
H'mong phenotype or any other phenotype that were
raised together in backyards.

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using the
QIAamp Kit from QIAGEN. The PCR products were
labelled with the fluorescent dyes and genotyped using a
capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter CEQ8000). Among
the 30 microsatellites recommended by FAO/ISAG and
available for genotyping in the NIAH laboratory (Ha
Noï), reliable genotypes were obtained with 20 markers
for HG chickens (data available upon request).
This data set was combined with two other ones: (i) a subset already studied by Berthouly et al. [8] involving 2 wild
populations of G. gallus (captured in northern Thailand in
1997, reared in a field station of the University of Chiang
Mai and sampled in 1999), 6 local standardised Asian
breeds and 2 commercial lines; (ii) a second set with 1
population of F2 animals from G. gallus (captured in Vietnam in 1997 and conserved in a French zoological park),
and 3 other commercial lines (Table 1). Among commercial lines, the white-egg layers correspond to the White
Leghorn breed, an ancient Mediterranean type of breed,
whereas brown-egg layers and broilers have Asian origins
following importation from Asia to Europe and the USA
in the 19th century. Sampling of wild junglefowl from the
Ha Giang province was not possible for technical reasons.
These two subsets were genotyped by the LABOGENA laboratory (France). In order to calibrate allele sizes between
the two laboratories, a set of 17 reference animals within
the 14 external populations was analysed jointly with the
animals from the Ha Giang province. The difference in
allele size observed between laboratories was adjusted
according to Berthouly et al. [8]. Eighteen markers, for
which allele sizes were consistent from one laboratory to
another, were used for genetic analysis (see Additional file
1).
Allele frequencies and expected and observed heterozygosity were calculated using GENETIX [9]. Allelic richness
by rarefaction was estimated using FSTAT [10]. GENEPOP
[11] was used to compute F-statistics [12] and departure
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using exact tests. Test
significance was corrected with sequential Bonferroni correction on loci. The matrix of FST Latter's distance [13]
between breeds was calculated to draw a NEIGHBORNET
tree using SPLITSTREE 4.8 [14].
We investigated the genetic structure of the sampled populations using a Bayesian clustering procedure implemented in STRUCTURE [15], with the admixture method
and correlated allele frequency version of the programme
[16]. First, we performed our analysis only using the HG
sample. We did 15 runs for each different value of K with
105 iterations following a burn-in period of 300 000
assuming that the data set could be represented by K separate genetic clusters (K = 1 to 15).

A: allelic richness; * pooled as one population in [8]

Second, we analysed the clustering of HG chickens with
the other fourteen breeds. In order to avoid bias due to
sample size, we reduced the HG sample to 32 randomly
selected animals with at least 1 animal per commune,
before applying the procedure of Rosenberg et al. [5] using

50 runs (60 000 iterations; burn-in period of 40 000). The
Q-matrix of the run with the highest similarity over all
runs using the similarity function G' was computed for
each K using CLUMPP [17].

The two analyses above were done to estimate the number
of genetic clusters (K) within the Ha Giang province and
within the global dataset. Thus, values of K were assessed
according to Evanno et al. [18].
Afterwards a third analysis was conducted to highlight
admixture pattern. The same approach as the second analysis was done but with all HG chickens using 50 runs (60
000 iterations; burn-in period of 40 000) from K = 2 to K
= 15. The Q-matrix of the run with the highest similarity
was also computed.
Admixture rate between the four communes and wild
populations was estimated using LEADMIX [19]. It performs maximum likelihood estimation of admixture proportions in a model where the ancestral species P0 is split
into two parental populations P1 (wild G. gallus) and P2
(HG chickens from non admixed communes) that
evolved independently before they contributed in genetic
proportion p1 and (1-p1) to form a hybrid population Ph
(the four Ha Giang's admixed communes).

Results and discussion
Genetic characterisation of the chicken population from
the Ha Giang province
The highest value for expected heterozygosity (> 0.60) was
found in HG chickens and in the wild junglefowl populations from Thailand (Table 1). The observed heterozygosity was the highest for wild populations, averaging 0.64.
For HG chickens, Ho ranged from 0.51 to 0.62 according
to the sampled communes, and was similar to values previously observed for other local populations [20-22]. HG
chickens exhibited the highest allelic richness (mean A =
2.9) and harboured 33 of the 36 private alleles found
across all populations. Moreover, 13 other alleles were
shared only by the wild and HG populations.

Within the Ha Giang province, FIS averaged 0.121, with 0
to 4 loci showing heterozygote deficiency. Among the 30
communes, only two did not exhibit a significant deviation from HWE (Table 1). The remaining Asian breeds
and commercial lines reached mean FIS values of 0.004
and 0.15 respectively (Table 1).
Multilocus between breed diversity accounted for 12.9%
of total diversity. Within the Asian group (i.e. 6 Asian
breeds and HG chickens), genetic differentiation between
breeds averaged 24.3% whereas within commercial lines
it reached 36.9%. HG chickens had the lowest mean FST
value with the wild populations (ranging from 0.117 to
0.172).
Within the Ha Giang province, only 3.7% of the genetic
diversity was due to differentiation between communes.
The best likelihood was found for K = 4 according to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/1

Evanno et al. [18] using the Bayesian approach (see Additional file 2). However maximum mean q values per commune ranged from 0.352 (HG146) to 0.948 (HG65). We
found that within a given commune, animals belong to 2
to 4 clusters except for the commune HG65 for which all
animals belong to one population. Thus no reliable
genetic subdivision was observed after performing the
Bayesian approach. Since villages are distant and separated from each other by forest or wide land crop areas,
village poultry stocks within a commune may behave as a
small genetic unit, which is in agreement with the high FIS
values observed. However, commercial exchanges often
take place for poultry replacement after epidemic events,
explaining the low FST values and results obtained with
the Bayesian approach. Q-matrix did not show any specific genetic clustering according to the individual phenotypes (i.e H'mong and non H'mong). Therefore, both
phenotypes may be considered as part of a single population, as observed for other local chicken populations in
Africa [21,22]. This was consistent with the fact that the
determinism of black skin and bones involves only two
major genes, FM for fibromelanosis (an autosomal dominant mutation) and ID for inhibition of dermal melanin
(sex-linked with a recessive wild-type allele for grey
shank) [23]. Thus the segregation of mutations at these
two loci may easily explain that black skin chickens are
distributed all over the population.
Clustering and admixture approach
When using the reduced HG sample, the log likelihood
value reached a plateau at K = 10 (see Additional file 3A).
For further K values, higher ΔK were observed indicating
instability across runs [Pritchard]. Following Evanno et al.
[18], the highest values were obtained for K = 2, K = 3 and
K = 10 (see Additional file 3B). Leroy et al. [24] hypothesised that the highest values obtained for small K are
biased with Evanno's method when the number of breeds
was important in the dataset. Therefore, using both
approaches, the highest likelihood was obtained for K =
10 (Fig. 1). The two broiler lines (BS-LD and BS-LC) could
not be distinguished. The BD-LB, a broiler dam line, clustered with the BE-LC layer line, which came from the same
commercial breeder. All 6 Asian breeds were well separated from each other as previously observed in Berthouly
et al. [8]. Ha Giang chickens and the wild populations segregated for most of the runs (data not shown) in the same
cluster. Considering the wild samples, it could be
assumed that these populations may have been subjected
to important founder effects, but were not very much
affected by genetic drift because of their recent introduction into experimental farms in Thailand or in a zoological park in France. However, the three populations
exhibited the same admixture pattern and constituted a
genetically homogeneous group. Thus, these wild samples
from different geographic origins (i.e. Thailand and Viet-

nam), could be considered as a good representation of the
genetic diversity of G. gallus in South-East Asia. The population of HG chickens was the only Asian population that
clustered with G. gallus. The same number of chickens was
considered for HG chickens as well as for the other breeds,
therefore the result was not biased by differences in sample size. Although Asian breeds were under conservation
and might have been subjected to a founder effect, they all
had South-East Asian origin and were still showing a high
genetic diversity, as in the HT breed. Therefore, the clustering pattern clearly shows a genetic proximity of HG chickens with wild red jungle fowl.
In order to focus on this genetic proximity, all the samples
from the 30 communes were added to the analysis (Fig.
2). Similarity coefficients computed over 50 runs were
high and ranged from 0.70 (K = 8) to 0.99 (K = 2). Following Rosenberg et al. [5], we focused on the analysis of the
clustering order and admixture pattern, from K = 2 to 9.
For K = 2, cluster 1 grouped the commercial lines and the
6 Asian breeds, the HG chickens formed cluster 2 and the
three wild populations admixed with both clusters. Starting from K = 3, the two previous clusters remained and the
new one (in yellow on Fig. 2) represented part of the wild
populations. For K = 4, the Japanese NG and BE-LC breed
separated from the other breeds until K = 7 for which the
NG started to be clearly identified. For K = 7, structuring
between Asian breeds and commercial lines appeared and
admixture of two Asian and the broiler lines was found at
K = 9. No Vietnamese communes admixed with Asian
breeds nor with commercial lines. Thus, the HG population seemed to be a local population, which had not been
submitted to any recent introgression of exotic or other

Asian breeds. Starting from K = 4, undistinguished clusters
appeared for HG chickens but four communes (HG88,
HG65, HG7, HG40) always shared the same admixture
pattern with the three sets of wild junglefowl (in yellow).
For K = 9, animals from the four communes that clustered
with wild populations at lower K values, clustered
together in a new cluster.
Furthermore chickens from these communes were found
isolated from the other ones and closely related to the
wild populations, when drawing a neighbornet tree with
Latter's genetic distance (Fig. 3). Since no similar admixture pattern was observed in the remaining communes,
such a pattern could be considered as a signature of local
gene flow from wild to domestic chickens. The mean q
probability of animals from these four communes to
belong to the wild cluster ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 for K
= 8.
Admixture rate from LEADMIX was estimated with our
sample of wild populations used as the introgressive population. The admixture rate reached 0.625, with a 95% CI
ranging between 0.424–0.986, indicating that some of
these chickens would be more related to wild chickens
than to domestic chickens. This rate may be biased due to
the violation of a few assumptions. The first one is that the
model implemented in LEADMIX does not assume a constant migration but a single admixture event. In the
present situation, where both populations are coexisting,
a constant migration from wild to domestic chickens is
most probable. This would also affect the minimum value
of genetic drift allowed by the programme. If admixture
occurred recently, genetic drift could be negligible. Sec-

ondly, we assumed that our wild sample was the true population introgressing the domestic chicken. However this
wild parent is obviously not the true one, since it did not
originate from the Ha Giang province and, also it may
have been subjected to a strong founder effect. A second
analysis, using an unknown wild parental population, led
to a similar result with an admixture rate reaching 0.75,
with a 95% CI ranging between 0.652–0.807. The explanations for these high admixture rates, taking place in
these four communes close to the forest, are (i) free scavenging chickens can easily be reproduce with wild ones
and (ii) a few householders unofficially explained during
their interviews that they used to pick up eggs in the forest
and raised the chicks. Gene flow from wild to domestic

chickens occurred in a significant way in the province and
may constitute one of the reasons for the observed high
genetic diversity. Gene flow in Indian flocks, raised in similar conditions (i.e. scavenging and forest), has been previously reported by Kanginakudru et al. [2] but it was
assumed to be low. However, it might be underestimated
because of the limited number of samples. The large scale
sampling, done within an area where both domestic and
wild chickens co-existed, allowed us to reveal more precisely the extent of this gene flow, which concerned 6.7%
of the sampled chickens.
Important commercial exchanges of chickens within the
province led to some homogenization of the gene pool,

which is in accordance with the low FST values between
communes, and with the absence of any genetic substructure found with the Bayesian approach. Also, frequent
exchanges will allow the spreading of alleles of wild origin
across the province. This would explain the absence of
specific private alleles shared with wild populations in
these four specific communes, as would be expected.
However, gene flow would increase gene diversity, which
is in accordance with the highest values of He observed in
3 of the four communes.

Conclusion
The Ha Giang chicken population shows high genetic
diversity which is due in part to the farmer practices (i.e.
commercial exchanges, low selection). This genetic diversity is also increased by gene flow occurring from wild to
domestic chickens. This could also have occurred in
another way and lead to a genetic endangerment of Red
Jungle fowl. Furthermore, providing evidence of gene flow
is also of prime interest for studies on the risk of disease
diffusion between wild and domestic populations.
