Abstract
Background: Hard ticks have been identified as important vectors of rickettsiae causing the
spotted fever syndrome. Tick-borne rickettsiae are considered to be emerging, but only limited
data are available about their presence in Western Europe, their natural life cycle and their
reservoir hosts. Ixodes ricinus, the most prevalent tick species, were collected and tested from
different vegetation types and from potential reservoir hosts. In one biotope area, the annual and
seasonal variability of rickettsiae infections of the different tick stages were determined for 9 years.
Results: The DNA of the human pathogen R. conorii as well as R. helvetica, R. sp. IRS and R. bellii-like
were found. Unexpectedly, the DNA of the highly pathogenic R. typhi and R. prowazekii and 4 other
uncharacterized Rickettsia spp. related to the typhus group were also detected in I. ricinus. The
presence of R. helvetica in fleas isolated from small rodents supported our hypothesis that crossinfection can occur under natural conditions, since R. typhi/prowazekii and R. helvetica as well as their
vectors share rodents as reservoir hosts. In one biotope, the infection rate with R. helvetica was
~66% for 9 years, and was comparable between larvae, nymphs, and adults. Larvae caught by
flagging generally have not yet taken a blood meal from a vertebrate host. The simplest explanation
for the comparable prevalence of R. helvetica between the defined tick stages is, that R. helvetica is
vertically transmitted through the next generation with high efficiency. The DNA of R. helvetica was
also present in whole blood from mice, deer and wild boar.
Conclusion: Besides R. helvetica, unexpected rickettsiae are found in I. ricinus ticks. We propose
that I. ricinus is a major reservoir host for R. helvetica, and that vertebrate hosts play important roles
in the further geographical dispersion of rickettsiae.

Background
The majority of emerging infectious diseases originates
from wildlife instead of companion animals [1], and
more than half is caused by bacteria and rickettsiae [2].
Rickettsiae are fastidious, mostly obligate intracellular
alpha-proteobacteria. They have a worldwide distribution
and are the causative agents of severe human infections.
Rickettsiae are usually not directly transmissible from
human to human [3], but are transmitted via arthropod
vectors such as ticks, mites and blood sucking insects,
which transmit rickettsiae between humans but also from
animals to humans [4]. The rat flea is the main vector of
R. typhi, which causes murine typhus and R. prowazekii is
transmitted between humans by fleas and lice and is the
causative agent of epidemic typhus [5]. Hard ticks (Ixodidae) have been identified as vectors of the spotted fever
syndrome in humans, which is caused by at least 15 different Rickettsia species. Two infamous members of this
group are R. rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and R. conorii, the causative agent of
Mediterranean spotted fever [6].
The geographic distribution of ticks and the rickettsiae
they transmit depends on environmental factors like climate, biotope and on the abundance of ticks and their
hosts. However, the impact of human behaviour on the
environment, together with a changing climate undoubtedly affects the spread of ticks and the pathogens they
carry [2,7,8]. In particular, rapidly evolving rickettsiae
may adapt to different hosts and environmental conditions, and prevalence of currently minor pathogenic species may be favoured by changing environmental
conditions [9]. The number of representatives of the
genus Rickettsia has increased over the last decades as a
result of improved identification techniques [6]. Emerging Rickettsia species such as R. helvetica, have been isolated from ticks in various European countries such as
Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Germany, France and The
Netherlands [10-16]. To date, the pathogenic potential is
unclear but R. helvetica infection has been suspected in
acute perimyocarditis, unexplained febrile illness and sarcoidosis [17-22].

In the Netherlands, Ixodes ricinus is the most predominant
tick species. Earlier studies in the Netherlands have shown
that these ticks carry different Borrelia spp, Anaplasma spp
and sporadically Babesia species [23,24]. Studies by Dutch
practitioners in the period 1994-2005 showed an apparent three-fold increase in the tick biting incidence and the
incidence of Lyme disease, indicated by the diagnosis of
erythema migrans [25,26]. Our long-term aims are to
monitor, prevent and control tick-borne diseases. A sentinel for tick-borne diseases in humans might be the occurrence of these pathogens in ticks. Identification of key
factors that affect the prevalence of tick-borne diseases
will facilitate effective control measures.
In order to assess the occurrence of pathogenic tick-borne
rickettsiae in The Netherlands, ticks from different vegetation types and ticks originating from humans and animals
were collected and tested. In one biotope, the annual and
seasonal variability of R. helvetica infections of the different tick stages was determined and potential reservoir
hosts, such as rodents including their ticks and fleas and
other wildlife were studied.

Results
Collection of ticks
To investigate the presence of rickettsiae and the possible
emergence of Rickettsia species in the Dutch tick population, 1735 ticks were collected between 2000 and 2008
(Table 1) from 5 geographically different locations (Figure
1 left). Ticks from Bijlmerweide (BW), Koninklijke
Houtvesterijen (HV), Duin en Kruidberg (DK), and
Heumesoord (HO) were collected by blanket dragging
[27]. BW is a typical city park near Amsterdam with many
deciduous trees and a few shrubs with a rich secondary
vegetation. HV is an oak forest where ninety percent of the
area is covered with blueberries. DK is a dune area rich in
vegetation were several species of deciduous trees and
shrubs were present, and 60% of the soil was covered with
vegetation litter. HO is a typical heather area which consisted of heather only, with a single pine tree and very little vegetation litter. Only very scarce and incomplete
information is available about the fauna present in these

Ticks from different geographical locations in The Netherlands were tested for the presence of R. helvetica. Ticks (larvae, nymphs and adults) were
collected from different area types, in different years, and the infection rate with R. helvetica is expressed as a percentage. As the infection rates
between the different tick stages were not significantly different within each location, the overall infection rate is presented.

areas. Ticks from Ameland (AL) originated from humans
who were bitten by ticks on the isle in the Wadden Sea,
and who had gone to the local general practitioner for
removal of the tick [28].
Detection of rickettsiae in arthropods
Total DNA from ticks was extracted and amplified by PCR
using generic primers against the 16S rRNA gene of all
Rickettsia species [27]. PCR products were analyzed by
RLB. Rickettsia isolates, which only reacted with the catch
all probe on RLB, were identified by sequencing the 16S
rRNA PCR product and characterized by phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 1 right). Forty-one percent of all ticks
(719 of 1735) were infected with R. helvetica, varying from
only 6% in a blueberry-rich oak forest (HV) to 66% in a

typical vegetation-rich dune area (DK; Table 1). The PCR
products of 16S rRNA of 15 R. helvetica field isolates were
sequenced and the 360 basepair-region showed no
sequence variation with the corresponding sequence in
Genbank (L36212). Also, PCR amplification and
sequencing part of the citrate synthase gene [29] of R. helvetica from different locations yielded identical sequences
to the corresponding sequences deposited in Genbank
(U59723: not shown). In Ameland (AL), 4.7% of ticks
were infected with R. sp. IRS [27]. Their sequences were
identical or almost identical (>99%) to published
sequences [29] (Figure 1). Remarkably, in 2.4% of the
nymphs from Ameland, which originated from human
subjects, R. typhi and R. prowazekii was detected. This finding was unexpected, since these pathogens almost exclu-

sively occur in fleas and/or lice [30,31]. The 360 basepairregion of the 16S rRNA DNA sequences of R. typhi and R.
prowazekii found in tick lysates were identical to the
sequences submitted to Genbank accession numbers
M20499 and U29135, respectively. We are not aware of
any organism that has exactly the same sequence as R.
typhi or R. prowazekii in this region. The closest match to
our sequences is R. massiliae which has 7 mismatches with
the sequence of R. typhi. PCR amplifications of a part of
the citrate synthase of R. typhi and R. prowazekii using two
different primer sets in these tick lysates were negative
(not shown). Here, all the R. typhi and R. prowazekii isolates were found in ticks which fed on human and were
from one location (AL). In two recent field studies carried
out in the Netherlands, we have also found both R. typhi
and R. prowazekii in unfed ticks caught by blanket-dragging on 4 other locations (not shown).
One straightforward explanation for the detection of R.
typhi and R. prowazekii is that ticks have obtained these
organisms via a blood meal from an infected rodent. Conversely, fleas might obtain Rickettsia species, which are
normally associated with ticks, via a blood meal on an
infected rodent. In order to verify this possibility, we
tested 24 fleas isolated from Myodes glareolus (bank vole)
and Apodemus sylvaticus (yellow-necked field mouse) for
the presence of rickettsiae. Three samples from fleas
reacted positive in the RLB, and two of these samples were
identified as R. helvetica by sequencing (not shown).
Contamination of tick lysates or PCR reactions with the
plasmid controls of R. typhi, R. prowazekii and R. bellii was
excluded: these two plasmids could also be detected using
M13 forward and reverse primers up to 1fg plasmid DNA
per sample. PCR amplifications on all the R. typhi- and R.
prowazekii-positive tick lysates with M13 primers were all
negative (not shown). Furthermore, In DK and BW, a Rickettsia species (<1%) was found to be similar, but not identical to R. bellii (Figure 1). In DK and HV, Rickettsia species
were identified that were related to but different from R.
typhi and R. prowazekii.
Detection of rickettsiae in wildlife
The infection rate of ticks with microorganisms depends
on the interaction with vertebrate hosts and may vary
between seasons and years [32]. To determine which wildlife may be considered as vertebrate host for rickettsiae in
The Netherlands, whole blood samples of wildlife were
collected between 2001 and 2008 from the different areas
and tested by PCR. From the 146 mice tested with PCR
29%, 14%, and 1.4% were infected with R. helvetica, R. sp.
IRS, and R. conorii, respectively. 19% of the roe deer and
7% of the wild boar were positive for R. helvetica, but not
for other Rickettsia spp No rickettsiae were found in red
deer (Table 2).

Wildlife from different geographical locations (see Figure 1) was
tested for the presence of Rickettsiae. Whole blood samples of
animals (number) were collected between 2000 and 2002, and the
infection rate with R. helvetica and R. conorii is expressed as a
percentage.

Transmission dynamics of R. helvetica
To gain insight into the transmission dynamics of the
most abundant Rickettsia species between ticks and vertebrate hosts, the occurrence of R. helvetica infection in ticks
was determined over time. The annual prevalence of R.
helvetica in DK was practically constant in all three tick
stages for 9 years, from 2000 until 2008 (Figure 2A). In
contrast, the prevalence of Borrelia in nymph and adults in
this area varied considerably, between 2 and 12%
[23](not shown). Typing of the ticks showed that all
stages (larvae, nymphs and adults) of I. ricinus were associated with approximately similar infection degrees of R.
helvetica (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the monthly infection
rate of nymphs did not change significantly either (Figure
2B), whereas a seasonal fluctuation is observed for Borrelia
in nymph and adults in the same area [23](not shown).
The number of larvae and adults caught were too low for
analysis of the monthly variation.

Discussion
Our investigations corroborate the wide distribution of R.
helvetica in the Netherlands, which was also found by
Nijhof et al. in ticks from domesticated animals [12]. The
overall occurrence of R. helvetica in ticks is comparable
with those reported from other European countries which
varies between 4-16% [14,33-36], and varied between different biotopes (Table 1). In a vegetation-rich dune area
(DK), an exceptionally high prevalence of R. helvetica was
found of ~66% (Table 1). This high percentage was seen
during all 9 years of this study. As far as we know, it is the
highest prevalence ever reported for R. helvetica. How the
striking differences in the percentage of R. helvetica
infected ticks are coupled to the environmental differences is unclear, and a topic for current investigations.
The occurrence of R. helvetica in ticks was persistent
between 2000 and 2008, and demonstrated that R. helvetica has established a stable life cycle in The Netherlands
(Figure 2A). The infection rate with R. helvetica is comparable between larvae, nymphs, and adult (Figure 2A).
Also, the infection rate of nymphs is hardly affected by
seasons (Figure 2B). In general, Ixodes ricinus larvae caught

The finding of the highly pathogenic R. typhi and R. prowazekii in naturally infected I. ricinus is unexpected, and this
is thought to be the first time this is reported. However, R.
prowazekii has been isolated sporadically from several
other ixodid ticks [39-41]. In this study, the ticks with R.
typhi and R. prowazekii were derived from human subjects.
More recent field studies from our laboratory have found
both pathogens in unfed ticks by blanket dragging and in
other areas as well (not shown). The presence of R. typhi
and R. prowazekii in I. ricinus ticks is plausible since R.
typhi, R. prowazekii, and R. helvetica share mice as vertebrate hosts, and mice are infested by both ticks and fleas.
We demonstrated that R. helvetica is found in rodent fleas
as well. Ticks from three habitats contained rickettsia species related to R. typhi/prowazekii (Figure 1). We assume
that R. typhi and R. prowazekii still circulate in (Dutch)
rodents using fleas as vectors. Possibly, ticks sporadically
become infected via a blood meal on an infected rodent.
Experimental infections showed that R. prowazekii could
be maintained trans-stadially, but failed to demonstrate
that ticks could function as efficient vectors for R. prowazekii [39-41]. Until now, the presence of R. typhi and R.
prowazekii in Dutch ticks has not led to reported disease
cases in humans.

Variability of tick infection with R. Helvetica

were expressed as a percentage per year (A) or per month
(B). Monthly averages and standard deviations were calculated. In figure 2A, the percentage of infected adult ticks in
2006 is not representative, because only three adult ticks
were caught. In other years between 12 and 26 adults were
caught and tested.

by flagging have not yet had a blood meal from a vertebrate host. Therefore, the simplest explanation for the
comparable prevalence of R. helvetica between the defined
ticks stages is, that R. helvetica is vertically transmitted
through the next generation with high efficiency. Efficient
transovarial transmission has already been demonstrated
for other rickettsiae and has also been demonstrated for R.
helvetica under laboratory conditions [37,38]. Pathogens
that benefit from efficient transovarial transmission
hardly depend on vertebrate hosts as reservoirs, and Ixodes
ricinus can therefore be considered as a reservoir host. R.
helvetica DNA was also found in whole blood from mice,
roe deer and wild boar. No clinical signs were reported
from these animals. Here, we show that mice and roe deer
may act as reservoir hosts, and could be involved in the
further geographical dispersion of R. helvetica. We did not
detect any rickettsia in red deer, though red deer are used
by ticks for blood meals (not shown). This finding may
imply that red deer are not good hosts for rickettsia.

The other Rickettsia species which were found included R.
conorii, R. SP. IRS, R. bellii-like and 4 rickettsiae related to
the typhus group (Figure 1). Additionally, R. australis and
R. raoulti were recently identified in The Netherlands in
two other studies, also [12,13]. These findings demonstrate that I. ricinus ticks harbor many different Rickettsia
species, some of which have already been shown to be an
agent of human rickettsiosis. Whether R. helvetica exposure through tick-bites constitutes a risk to human health
is unclear. The occurrence and pathogenicity of Rickettsia
species in humans in The Netherlands has remained
largely unaddressed, probably because the early signs and
symptoms of rickettsial infections are notoriously nonspecific, mimicking flu-like illnesses, the medical community is poorly aware of potential rickettsial diseases
acquired, and powerful diagnostic tools are lacking.
In this study, only the DNA of Rickettsiae has been
detected and identified in samples from wild life, ticks
and fleas. In order to prove the presence of the corresponding infectious agents, their viability needs to be
tested by in vitro culture or infection experiments of laboratory animals. Future studies aim to investigate whether
these Rickettsia species in ticks are an emerging risk to public health.

Materials and methods
Collection of ticks, fleas and wildlife and extraction of
DNA
Ticks were collected between 2000 and 2008 by flagging
the vegetation at 4 different habitats. Ticks were immersed
Page 5 of 7

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:41

in 70% ethanol and stored at -20°C before testing. Every
year, from April until September, a maximum of 50 questing ticks (larvae, nymphs, adults) were collected monthly
in a vegetation-rich dune area, Duin en Kruidberg [23].
On the Island of Ameland ticks were collected from persons presenting with a tick bite at the local general practitioner. Based on morphological criteria, all ticks were
identified as Ixodes ricinus. In doubtful cases, sequencing
of tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA confirmed the I. ricinus
origin [42]. DNA from ticks was extracted by alkaline lysis
[23]. Fleas were collected from Myodes glareolus (bank
vole) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse), trapped in
the period February to July 2008. The fleas were immediately stored on dry ice and subsequently at -80°C before
testing. Total DNA was extracted as follows. Fleas were disrupted using liquid N2 and pestles, and homogenized in
600 μl buffer RLT using a Qiashredder homogenizer
according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNeasy
minikit, Qiagen). DNA was extracted from 300 μl
homogenate using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen).
DNA was eluted using 50 μl elution buffer. Whole blood
samples from wildlife were collected from the same areas
and in the same period. DNA was extracted using the
QIAamp-DNA-Blood-Mini-Kit (Qiagen-Benelux, Venlo,
the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Detection of Rickettsia spp
The presence of the DNA of different Rickettsia species was
determined by PCR followed by reverse line blotting
(RLB) as previously described. [27]. Briefly, the 16S rRNA
gene was amplified by PCR with the HotStarTaq master
mix (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) using 5'AACGCTATCGGTATGCTTAACA and 5'-Biotin-ACTCACTCGGTATTGCTGGA-3 as primers with the following
conditions: 15 min 94°C, then cycles of 20 s 94°C, 30 s
67°C, 30 s 72°C lowering the annealing temperature 1°C
each cycle till reaching 67°C, then 40 cycles at this annealing temperature and ending by 10 min 72°C. For RLB
analysis of the PCR product the following amino labeled
probes were used: 5'-TTTAGAAATAAAAGCTAATACCG
(catch all), CTTGCTCCAGTTAGTTAGT (R. conorii),
GCTAATACCATATATTCTCTATG (R. helvetica), and
GTATATTCTCTACGGAAAAAAG (R. SP. IRS3). Positive
controls were plasmids containing the 16S rRNA sequence
from R. helvetica, R. conorii, R. typhi and R. prowazekii and
were kindly provided by Leo Schouls [27]. To minimize
cross contamination and false-positive results, positive
and negative controls were included in each batch tested
by the PCR and RLB assays. In addition, DNA extraction,
PCR mix preparation, sample addition, and PCR analysis
were performed in separated, dedicated labs. PCR amplicons were purified with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit
(Qiagen Inc.) and sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye
Terminator Cycle sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/41

Elmer, Applied Biosystems). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands, and unique sequences
were submitted to Genbank (GQ849209-GQ849220).
Sequences were compared with sequences in Genbank
using BLAST. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using
Bionumerics version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Gent, Belgium).
PCR amplification of parts of the citrate synthase gene was
done exactly as described by De Sousa and colleagues,
using cs409d/rp1258n and cs535d/Rp1258 as primer
pairs [29].
