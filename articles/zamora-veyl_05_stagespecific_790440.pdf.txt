Abstract
Background: Leishmania spp., in the course of their parasitic life cycle, encounter two vastly
different environments: the gut of sandflies and the phagosomes of mammalian macrophages.
During transmission into a mammal, the parasites are exposed to increased ambient temperature
as well as to different carbon sources. Molecular chaperones or heat shock proteins are implicated
in the necessary adaptations which involve the ordered differentiation from the flagellated,
extracellular promastigote to the intracellular amastigote stage.
Results: Here, we show that the Leishmania donovani co-chaperonin, CPN10, is synthesised to a
significantly increased concentration during in vitro differentiation to the amastigote stage. We
show by fluorescence microscopy and by immunogold electron microscopy that, like its putative
complex partner CPN60.2, CPN10 is localised to the single, tubular mitochondrion of the parasites
and, moreover, that it co-precipitates with CPN60.2, the major mitochondrial chaperonin of
Leishmania spp..
Conclusion: Our data indicate an increased requirement for CPN10 in the context of
mitochondrial protein folding during or early in the mammalian stage of this pathogen. Moreover,
they confirm the CPN60.2 as bona fide mitochondrial GroEL homologue in L. donovani and the
postulated interaction of eukaryotic chaperonins, CPN60 and CPN10.

Background
The euglenozoa which, beside the euglenophyta, also
include the pathogenic protozoa of the Order Kinetoplastida, have branched off early in eukaryotic evolution. The
kinetoplastida have developed, or retained, molecular
mechanisms not shared by most Crown Group Eukaryota,
such as trans-splicing of messenger RNA, RNA editing,
and polycistronic transcription. The genetic information
of their single mitochondrion, the so-called kDNA, is

localised to the kinetoplast, an organelle unique to this
order. The kinetoplast is part of a tubular, single mitochondrion that shows little morphological likeness to the
mitochondria of Crown Group Eukaryota. The kinetoplastida encompass two genera of parasitic pathogens,
Trypanosoma and Leishmania, both of which responsible
for considerable human morbidity and mortality.

The parasites of the genus Leishmania exist in two morphologically distinct life cycle stages. The slender, flagellated, promastigote proliferates in the alimentary tract of
female sandflies at ambient temperature. The amastigote,
a rounded, intracellular form, with no protruding flagellum, persists in the phagosomes of mammalian macrophages and at temperatures of up to 39°C. The difference
of temperatures in the two environments not only triggers
the respective stage development [1], but also poses a
challenge to the system of protein chaperones. At least
two heat shock proteins, Hsp100 and CPN60.2, show significantly induced abundance during the amastigote stage
[2-4].
Apart from the temperature difference, the two environments, insect gut and macrophage phagosome, also offer
different qualitative and quantitative composition of carbon sources. The life cycle stage differentiation, therefore,
must include an adaptation of the parasites' metabolic
pathways. Subcellular compartments, e.g. the single tubular mitochondrion, also have to undergo adaptation. The
folding of a different set of metabolic enzymes after their
translocation across the outer and inner mitochondrial
membranes can be expected to challenge the mitochondrial chaperone system.
Import of nuclear encoded proteins is vital for the function of mitochondria. A complex machinery of chaperone
proteins is required for the unfolding of mitochondrial
proteins, their trans-membrane transport, and their
refolding inside the mitochondrial matrix [5]. The latter is
thought to be brought about by the 60 kDa chaperonin
(CPN60). This protein is a functional and structural
homologue to the GroEL chaperonin of the eubacteriae.
The function of GroEL, being the subject of considerable
research efforts, is well understood [6,7]. In bacteria,
GroEL forms barrel-like structures of two rings of 7 subunits each, with two central cavities. 7 subunits of the
GroES co-chaperonin form a lid that covers one of the cavities. Folding intermediates of client proteins are bound
inside one cavity where they may attain energetically
favoured conformations without interference from other
polypeptides.
Less is known, by comparison, about the function of
eukaryotic GroEL homologues, the CPN60 proteins. They
are nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Rather than
forming two rings of seven GroEL subunits, the chaperonin complex in mitochondria consists of a single ring of
seven CPN60 and one ring of CPN10 subunits, and it was
shown that the function of CPN60/CPN10 complexes
inside the mitochondria is similar to the chaperonin function of bacterial, cytosolic GroEL/GroES complexes [8,9].
GroES may also play a role in modulating the substrate
specificity of GroEL. For instance it was reported that

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/4/1/3

GroES binding shifts the preference of GroEL for hydrophobic amino acids towards amino acids with
hydrophilic side chains [10]. In yeast, not all CPN60 substrates need CPN10 for proper folding. Other proteins
require both CPN60 and CPN10, while newly imported
CPN60 depends on CPN10 for correct folding [11].
We had previously identified the Leishmania donovani
CPN60.2 gene which encodes the mitochondrial 60 kD
chaperonin [4]. This protein shows increased expression
during in vitro promastigote to amastigote differentiation,
indicating an altered requirement for CPN60 in the amastigote stage. A second, diverged gene copy, CPN60.1, is
not expressed to detectable levels in any in vitro culture
stage of L. donovani or L. major [4]. To better understand
mitochondrial protein chaperoning during the leishmanial life cycle, we identified the CPN10 gene of Leishmania donovani, determined its abundance in the two life
cycle stages, and analysed the subcellular localisation of
the gene product and its association with CPN60.2.

Results
Amplification of L. donovani CPN10 DNA
An alignment of the known eukaryotic CPN10 amino acid
sequences revealed four limited stretches of sequence conservation (not shown). Oligonucleotides CPN10.1 to
CPN10.4 were designed according to the codon bias of
Leishmania spp.. Using L. donovani genomic DNA as
template, combinations of the aforementioned primers
were tested in a polymerase chain reaction. Only the combination of primers CPN10.1 and CPN10.4 yielded an
amplification product of the expected size (not shown).
The amplification product was then subcloned into the
vector pBluescript and subjected to sequence analysis
using standard pBluescript sequencing primers. The
sequence analysis confirmed that the amplification product harboured probable CPN10 sequences (not shown).
Isolation of a CPN10 genomic DNA clone
The amplified putative CPN10 gene fragment was used to
screen a L. donovani genomic DNA cosmid library [3].
Positive cosmids were subjected to a restriction digest and
Southern Blot analysis to identify common subfragments
which harboured the CPN10 gene(s). A 1.5 kb XhoI I fragment which hybridised with the CPN10 probe was subcloned into pBluescript and subjected to sequence
analysis. The sequence (GenBank AF394959) contains an
uninterrupted open reading frame of 303 bp encoding a
putative 10.7 kDa polypeptide. A sequence comparison
by BLAST search confirmed this putative polypeptide as
related to eukaryotic and prokaryotic co-chaperonins. Figure 1A shows the position of the L. donovani CPN10 in
the lineage of eukaryotic CPN10 proteins. L. donovani
CPN10 groups within the kinetoplastid homologs. Figure

polypeptides. The high degree of sequence conservation
between LdCPN10 and its counterparts in higher eukaryotes indicates a conserved function.
Southern Analysis
Within the haploid set of chromosomes, L. donovani
CPN10 appears to be single copy. This was determined by
Southern Blot analysis of L. donovani genomic DNA,
digested with 7 restriction endonucleases (Figure 2A). The
pattern of restriction fragments does not indicate the presence of additional gene copies. We also performed pulsed
field gel electrophoresis (Figure 2B) to determine the
chromosomal localisation of the CPN10 gene. The
CPN10 specific probe hybridised to a chromosomal band
of approximately 1,100 kb. This size corresponds to chromosomes 26 or 27b. This was confirmed when sequencing of the L. major genome was finished; two copies of
CPN10 are found on chromosome 26 http://
www.genedb.org/genedb/
Search?name=LmjF26.0620&organism=leish.
RT-PCR analysis
Northern analysis of L. donovani RNA using a CPN10specific probe did not yield any bands in the expected size
range. To ascertain that the putative CPN10 gene encodes
a stable RNA, we performed RT-PCR. Whole cell RNA was
reversely transcribed using an oligo-dT primer. The first
strand cDNA was used as template in a PCR amplification
using primers CPN10-1 and CPN10-4. Negative controls
included an amplification of material from a cDNA synthesis mix that had been inactivated at 65°C for 10 min
(Figure 2C, lane 1), and an amplification with an equivalent amount of whole cell RNA as template (lane 3), to
exclude DNA contaminations in the RNA preparation.
Both reactions did not give rise to an amplification product. The reaction with cDNA as template (lane 2), however, produced a ~350 bp PCR product, much the same as
the reaction with genomic DNA as template (lane 4). We
conclude that stable, polyadenylated RNA is produced
from the CPN10 gene.
Production of anti-CPN10 antibodies
The CPN10 open reading frame was subcloned into
pJC45, a derivative of pJC40 [4,12], for expression in E.
coli strain Bl21 (DE3) [13]. His-tagged CPN10 was purified by metal chelate chromatography (Figure 3) and used
to immunise laying hens. Antibodies were prepared from
egg yolk before and after immunisation to yield preimmune and CPN10-specific antibody preparations. In
Western Blot analyses, these antibodies faithfully recognised recombinant rCPN10 (not shown).
LdCPN10 expression is induced in the amastigote
Using the anti-CPN10 antibodies, we performed immunoblot analysis on lysates of L. donovani promastigotes

donovani cells and subjected to reverse transcription at 37°C

incubation at 37°C. Either RNA (lane 1), the cDNA (lane 2),
the heat inactivated cDNA mix (lane 3) or genomic DNA
(lane 4) were added to a PCR reaction mix using CPN10 specific primers. The sizes of selected marker DNA molecules is
shown to the right.

of the cultures before and after IPTG induction were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The lysate

tag. The purified rCPN10 was also subjected to SDS-PAGE
analysis.

before and after heat shock, and of axenically cultured
amastigotes (Figure 4B). In promastigotes cultured at
25°C, we observe only a faint band in the expected size
range. After a 24 h treatment of the promastigotes at
37°C, a signal is observed. The CPN10 signal increases
strongly during in vitro amastigote differentiation. Figure
4A shows identical samples separated by SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie Blue staining. We conclude that Leishmania
donovani CPN10 is expressed preferentially in the amastigote stage, induced at least in part by the elevated
temperature.

CPN10 is the co-chaperonin in L. donovani
By analogy, CPN10 is expected to act as co-chaperonin to
the 60 kDa chaperonin, CPN60. However, there are two
diverged members of the CPN60 gene family in L. donovani, CPN60.1 and CPN60.2. Of these, only CPN60.2
could be shown to encode a protein which localised to the
mitochondrion [4]. We therefore tested whether CPN10
interacts with CPN60.2 protein in L. donovani and performed co-immune precipitation. L. donovani cell lysates
were incubated with anti-CPN10 antibodies, anti-chicken
IgG (rabbit) and Protein-A agarose. The precipitated material was then analysed by immunoblot using antiCPN60.2 antibody. As shown in Figure 4C, the antiCPN10 precipitate contains a protein which reacts with
the anti-CPN60.2 antibodies. We conclude that CPN60.2
is the bona fide chaperonin and that CPN10 serves as its
co-chaperonin.
Subcellular localisation of LdCPN10
Since CPN10 serves as co-chaperone to CPN60 we
expected CPN10 to localise to the kinetoplast/mitochondrion complex inside the leishmaniae. To test this prediction, the CPN10 coding sequence was fused to a GFP

(Green Fluorescent Protein) coding DNA in the
expression vector pIRmcs3-. The linearised expression
construct was recombined into the rRNA locus of L. donovani to yield stable expression of the CPN10::GFP chimera. The recombinant parasites were cultivated as
promastigotes and analysed by fluorescence microscopy.
The results are shown in Figure 5. We observe brightly fluorescent tubular structures in the promastigotes. No fluorescence is observed in the cytoplasm. This indicates that
the CPN10 sequence can quantitatively direct GFP into a
subcellular compartment or organelle.
To identify the subcellular compartment that harbours
CPN10, we performed immune electron microscopy
using sections of heat stressed promastigotes and of
axenic amastigotes. Figure 6 shows the result. We find the
gold particles associated both with tubular structures and
with the kinetoplast. We conclude that CPN10 is a mitochondrial protein.
When we analysed the subcellular localisation of
CPN60.2 in L. donovani, this chaperonin, too, localised
to a tubular subcellular compartment. However, we did
not find it associated with the kinetoplast. Therefore, the
exact subcellular localisation was still unclear. Using the
strain which overexpressed the CPN10::GFP chimera, we
performed a co-immune electron microscopy. We used
anti-GFP mAB in conjunction with anti-mouse immunogold particles (5 nm). Then the sections were co-stained
using anti-CPN60 antibody, anti-chicken IgG (rabbit),
and protein A gold (10 nm). As shown in Figure 7,
CPN10::GFP and CPN60 colocalise to the same tubular
compartment. This shows that CPN60.2 is indeed a mitochondrial protein in Leishmania.

precipitations without anti-CPN10 antibody and with a preimmune antibody preparation, respectively. Lane 3 represents the CPN10 immune precipitation proper. The position
of CPN60.2 is indicated.

We have cloned and analysed the CPN10 gene of the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. This is, to our
knowledge, the first characterisation of a protozoan member of the conserved GroES family of co-chaperonins.
Since CPN10 is a very small protein with an impact on
mitochondrial function, the restraints on sequence variation should be rather tight. Accordingly, Leishmania
CPN10 is >60 % similar to mammalian CPN10
sequences. A comparison of the L. donovani CPN10 gene
with other eukaryotic GroES homologs further confirms
that the leishmaniae belong to a remote entity among the
eukaryota, clearly separated from the Eukaryotic Crown
Group. A similarly diverged position was observed for the
GroEL homologue of L. donovani, CPN60.2 [4].
The gene for CPN10 is single copy in the L. donovani
genome. This is in contrast to the CPN60.2 gene which is
present in two copies, in addition to a, as far as known
silent, CPN60.1 gene [4]. It is also in contrast with the

situation in L. major. According to the L. major genome
database, the L. major CPN10 is encoded by two gene
copies located in tandem. If confirmed, this difference
could serve to distinguish both Leishmania species which
have overlapping endemic regions.
Eukaryotic CPN10, like its bacterial counterpart, GroES, is
assumed to act as co-chaperonin to CPN60 in the mitochondrial matrix. Immune electron microscopy reveals
that CPN10 localises both to the kinetoplast and to the
tubular part of mitochondrion. More importantly, coimmunoprecipitation experiments establish a direct interaction between CPN10 and CPN60.2. This not only indicates a function of CPN10 as bona fide co-chaperonin, but
also establishes CPN60.2 as the Leishmania GroEL
homolog. In addition, the mitochondrial localisation of
both proteins is now well established.
The mitochondrial transport signal sequence of CPN10
can direct the import of the much larger CPN10::GFP chimera into the mitochondria and the kinetoplast. The chimera is expressed stably from the integration site within
the rRNA gene repeats. The chimera may serve for future
experimental designs as mitochondrial localiasation
marker and as marker for the integrity of the
mitochondrion.
The CPN10 gene is expressed preferentially under heat
stress and in axenic amastigotes of L. donovani. The putative complex partner, CPN60.2, also shows increased
abundance under heat stress [4]. The induction of CPN10,
however, is more pronounced, and comparable to the
induction of Hsp100 [3]. In this regard, three heat shock
proteins, Hsp100, Cpn60.2, and CPN10, differ from the
major chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Hsp83). The latter
show high constitutive abundance and only a marginal
increase during heat stress and in the amastigote stage
[3,14]. It is likely that these different expression kinetics
reflect different roles during the life cycle. Hsp100 is
required only in intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani
and has a role in amastigote specific gene expression [15].
CPN60.2, and even more so, CPN10, are obviously also in
increased demand during the amastigote stage.

and anti-mouse immunogold (5 nm), sections were treated

Protein A gold (10 nm). Thus, 10 nm gold particles represent
CPN60 and 5 nm gold particles represent CPN10::GFP. k =
kinetoplast.

Is there a specific function for CPN10 during the mammalian stage of the parasite's life cycle? It has been suggested
that GroES can alter the affinity of GroEL for amino acid
side chains [10]. In the yeast, substrate proteins may fold
either independently of CPN10 or in a CPN10-dependent
manner [11]. This raises the possibility that the preferential expression of CPN10 in amastigotes of L. donovani
may reflect a change in the substrate specificity of the
mitochondrial chaperonin complex, necessitated by the
change of environment and the concomitant changes in
nutrient availability. Since CPN10 is a single copy gene

Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease 2005, 4:3

that is hardly expressed in the highly proliferative promastigote stage, it may be a suitable target for a gene replacement approach. This should allow to assess the role of
CPN10 for the virulence and pathogenicity of Leishmania
parasites.

Conclusion
We have identified the Leishmania donovani homologue
of the bacterial co-chaperonin, GroES, and assigned the
name CPN10 to the gene and the protein. CPN10 is a heat
shock protein and shows increased intracellular concentration at an elevated temperature and in axenically cultivated amastigotes of L. donovani. CPN10 localises to the
mitochodrial compartment and co-localises with the
GroES homologue, CPN60.2. A direct interaction of both
proteins was demonstrated using co-immuno precipitation. Both CPN10 and CPN60.2 are therefore suitable
markers for the mitochondria of Leishmania spp. and
related species. Moreover, the increased concentration in
the amastigote stage suggests a role of CPN10 in this stage.

Methods
Parasite strains and culture
For our analyses we used the Lo8 strain of L. donovani, a
gift from D. Zilberstein. Promastigotes were routinely cultivated at 25°C in supplemented M199 medium [3]. Cell
density was monitored using a Schaerfe Systems CASY
Cell Counter. In vitro promastigote to amastigote differentiation was performed as described [3].
PCR amplification of CPN10 DNA
Four primers were delineated from an amino acid
sequence comparison of known GroES and CPN10 proteins. The extreme bias in Leishmania towards G and C
residues in the wobble positions of codons was used to
create primers with minimal degeneracy:

primer CPN10.1: CCGCTGTTCG ACCGCGTGCT GG
primer CPN10.2: GGCGGCATCR TGCTGCC
primer CPN10.3: CGGCAGCAYG ATGCCGCC
primer CPN10.4: CAGCACCTTG TCGCCCACCT TCAC
100 ng of L. donovani genomic DNA was mixed with 40
ng of oligonucleotide primer pairs, 25 nmoles of each
dNTP, 10 × reaction buffer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA
polymerase (Beckman) in a 50 µl reaction. The reaction
mix was incubated for 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and
1 min at 72°C. The cycle was repeated 35 times. 10% of
the reaction was analysed on a 1% agarose gel. Negative
controls included each primer by itself and omission of
template DNA. Bands absent from the negative controls
were recovered by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/4/1/3

and by using glass beads adsorption (PureGen Kit,
Biozyme). PCR products were subcloned using the TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to sequence
analysis..
Reverse transcriptase (RT-) PCR
Total RNA from promastigotes stage parasites strain Lo8
was prepared using a Ribolyser Kit (Hybaid). cDNA synthesis was carried out using the First Strand synthesis kit
(Pharmacia) with the enclosed (dT)18 primer and 5 µg of
total RNA. The cDNA was then amplified enzymatically
using the primers CPN10.1 and CPN10.4 The amplification was carried out as described above.
Library screening
We used a cosmid library of L. donovani previously
described in [16]. The library was screened by hybridisation with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes derived from
the subcloned amplification products. Hybridisation was
performed at 65°C in HYB 9 solution (Biozyme) for 16 h.
Washes were performed at decreasing SSC concentrations
(6 × to 0.2 × SSC, 0.5 % SDS) at 65°C. Filters were developed using anti-digoxigenin FAB/AP conjugate (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by colorimetric staining
with NBT/BCIP. Positive cosmid clones were picked,
rescreened, and verified in an amplification reaction using
CPN10-specific primers.
Subcloning and sequence analysis
Cosmid DNA from positive clones was subjected to
restriction endonucleased digest and Southern Blot to
determine suitable restriction endonucleases. Cosmid
DNA was then digested at a preparative scale and subcloned into an appropriately cleaved pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene) or pJC45 vector [4]. Plasmid subclones
were then subjected to bidirectional primer walking
sequence analysis, starting from the known sequences of
the PCR amplificates. Sequencing was performed on an
Applied Biosystems Model 370 sequencer using the DyeTerminator Kit.
Sequence evaluation
Contig alignment, in silico translation, and sequence
alignment were performed using the MacMolly Tetris and
the MacVector software packages. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed using the clustalW algorithm included
with MacVector at default settings.
Recombinant Expression of CPN10
The putative open reading frame of CPN10 was amplified
using specific primers that modify the start codon
sequence into a NdeI site and the stop codon sequence
into an EcoRI site. The amplification products were
cleaved with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the expression vector pJC45 [4], between the NdeI site and the EcoRI

site. The expression plasmids were transformed into the
bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) [pAPlacIQ], a gift from Olivier
Payet, CNRS Toulouse. Bacteria were grown in CircleGrow
medium (BIO 101) supplemented with 50 µg/ml Ampicillin and 10 µg/ml Kanamycin to OD600 = 0.5. IPTG was
added to 1 mM and incubation was continued for 1 h. The
purification of His-tagged proteins from bacterial lysates
by metal chelate chromatography has been described
[12,14].
To express CPN10::GFP chimera, the CPN10 coding
sequence, minus the stop codon, was enzymatically
amplified to create BamHI and HindIII sites at the 5' and
3' ends, respectively. Digested with BamHI and HindIII,
the amplification products were ligated between the
BamHI and HindIII sites of the yeast plasmid p426/PQ25
[17]. By this procedure, CPN10 and GFP coding
sequences were fused in frame. The chimeric CPN10::GFP
coding sequence was then excised with BamHI and XhoI
and ligated into pIRmcs3- [18]. The plasmid
pIRCPN10::GFP and the parent plasmid pIRmcs3- were
linearised using SwaI and transfected into L. donovani by
electroporation. Recombinant parasites were placed
under ClonNAT (Werner Bioreagents) selection (100 µg/
ml) and analysed by fluorescence microscopy.
Immunisation and antibody preparation
The immunisation of laying hens and the preparation of
antibodies from egg yolk has been described [19].
Immunoblot analysis
SDS-PAGE and Western Transfer were performed as
described [14,19]. Briefly, membranes were treated with
blocking buffer (4% skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween
20 in DPBS), with antibodies at appropriate dilutions in
blocking buffer, and with secondary antibody/alkaline
phosphatase conjugate (Dianova) in blocking buffer.
Blots were stained with nitrobluetetrazolium chloride and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.
Immune precipitation
1 × 108 promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation
and lysed in 500 µl solubilising buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 2.5 µg × ml-1 each
of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain). Lysates
were centrifuged at 13000 × g, 4°C. Soluble proteins were
incubated with 20 µl anti-CPN10 antibody for 1 h at 4°C.
350 µl of protein A-sepharose slurry were preincubated
with anti-chicken IgG from rabbit and added. The slurry
was further incubated at 4°C for 2 h. The immunoabsorbent was centrifuged and washed three times in washing
buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0,2%
NP-40, 2 mM EDTA), twice in washing buffer B (as above,
except NaCl is 500 mM) and once in washing buffer C (10
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5). For analysis on SDS-PAGE 250 µl

of SDS sample buffer was added and the samples were
heated for 5 minutes at 95°C. After centrifugation, 50 µl
of the supernatant was loaded onto a 12% PA gel.
Immune electron microscopy
Immune electron microscopy was performed essentially
as described [3]. LR-White embedded microsections were
treated with chicken antibody at 1:500 (anti-CPN10) or
1:2000 (anti-CPN60.2) in PBS (0.1 % Tween 20, 1%
BSA). Anti-chicken IgG (rabbit) and Protein-A immunogold particles (10 nm) were used for detection. For detection of CPN10::GFP chimera, anti-GFP monoclonal
antibody and 5 nm anti-mouse immunogold conjugate
(Sigma) were used.
Fluorescence microscopy
L. donovani promastigotes expressing CPN10:GFP chimera were grown to 2 × 107 cells ml-1. 1 ml of parasite culture was subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 ×
g. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was
resuspended in 200 µl of Dulbecco's PBS. 2 µl was applied
to a multiwell microscope slide and subjected to fluorescence microscopy at 63-fold magnification. Samples were
analysed in bright field and in the FITC channel using a
Hitachi Model monochrome CCD camera. Images were
taken and merged using the Improvision Open Lab® software package and exported in TIFF format. Cropping and
juxtapositioning were done using Adobe Photoshop® software.
Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis
Leishmania cells were harvested by centrifugation and
washed twice in PBS. Following centrifugation, parasites
were resuspended in PBS and mixed with an equal volume
of prewarmed 1,5 InCert agarose (FMC BioProducts,
Rockland). This mixture was aliquoted in block formers
(2 × 107 parasites per block, Pharmacia). To lyse parasites,
the agarose blocks were incubated in 2 mg/ml proteinase
K (1% Laurylsarkosyl, 0,5 m EDTA pH 9.0) at 37°C for 48
h, and stored in 0.5 EDTA at 4°C.

PFGE was performed at 13°C in 0,25 × TBE buffer under
the following conditions: intervall in sec: 100-10 log;
switching angle: -110 lin; voltage: 200-150 log (Rotaphor,
Biometra).
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH80 chromosomes
(New England Biolabs) were used as size standards.
After staining with ethidium bromide (1 µg ml-1) and
strand breakage by a 5 min exposure to UV radiation (254
nm), the gel was blotted onto a positively charged nylon
membrane (Qiagen) by alkaline transfer [20]. The membrane was hybridised with a digoxigenin-labeled CPN10
probe. Blots were stained as described above.

Digital imaging
Primary experimental data were digitalised either on a
flatbed scanner (Microtek Scanmaker 8700) or on a 35
mm film scanner (NIKON LS-4000). Phosphor imager
(Molecular Dynamics) data were imported directly as TIFF
images. Images were cropped and optimised for colour
saturation using Adobe Photoshop® software. No filters or
other image altering functions were employed on the
images or parts thereof. Images were combined with vector graphics and text using ClarisDraw® software, version
1.0d.
