Abstract
Background: Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) has been a cost-effective tool in molecular biology and represents an
abundant valuable resource for genome annotation, gene expression, and comparative genomics in plants.
Results: In this study, we constructed a cDNA library of Prunus mume flower and fruit, sequenced 10,123 clones of
the library, and obtained 8,656 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences with high quality. The ESTs were
assembled into 4,473 unigenes composed of 1,492 contigs and 2,981 singletons and that have been deposited in
NCBI (accession IDs: GW868575 - GW873047), among which 1,294 unique ESTs were with known or putative
functions. Furthermore, we found 1,233 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the P. mume unigene dataset.
We randomly tested 42 pairs of PCR primers flanking potential SSRs, and 14 pairs were identified as true-to-type
SSR loci and could amplify polymorphic bands from 20 individual plants of P. mume. We further used the 14 ESTSSR primer pairs to test the transferability on peach and plum. The result showed that nearly 89% of the primer
pairs produced target PCR bands in the two species. A high level of marker polymorphism was observed in the
plum species (65%) and low in the peach (46%), and the clustering analysis of the three species indicated that
these SSR markers were useful in the evaluation of genetic relationships and diversity between and within the
Prunus species.
Conclusions: We have constructed the first cDNA library of P. mume flower and fruit, and our data provide sets of
molecular biology resources for P. mume and other Prunus species. These resources will be useful for further study
such as genome annotation, new gene discovery, gene functional analysis, molecular breeding, evolution and
comparative genomics between Prunus species.

Background
Mei (Prunus mume) originated in China and belongs to
the sub-family Prunoideae within the Rosaceae family
and is widely cultivated in East Asian countries. Mei
trees are classified into two groups, fruiting mei and flowering mei, based on their uses [1]. The fruiting mei has
been cultivated in China for more than 7000 years
according to the historical records, and now it is also
widely cultivated in Japan [2]. The processed products of
mei include salted mei, mei wine and juice have high
nutritional and medicinal value and are consumed in
some countries, including China, Japan, and Korea. Chu
[3] reported that mei flower and young fruit can tolerate

China

relatively low temperatures (-4°C ~ -2°C) in early spring.
These attributes make it an economically important and
excellent ornamental tree in south China. Mei has long
played an important role in human diet and health, but
there is dearth of information about its flower and fruit
development, physiology and biochemistry. The scarcity
of knowledge contributes to difficulties in breeding, production, and storage of fruits. Mei cDNA library construction and EST analysis could be employed for the
study of important genes responsible for flower and fruit
development and their evolution in the plant kingdom.
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are partial sequences
of expressed genes prepared by reverse transcribing
mRNA and cloning the cDNA fragments into a plasmid
and they are also gained by large scale sequencing at
one instance [4]. They represent a snapshot of genes

expressed in a given tissue and/or at a given developmental stage [5]. In plants, this method was initially
applied to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana [6].
Recently, many EST libraries of a wide range of plant
species have been constructed for the genes involved in
plant growth and differentiation [7], secondary metabolism [8] and biochemical pathways [9,10] as well as
responses to pathogen attack and environmental stresses
[11]. ESTs are proven cost-effective tools and represent
abundant valuable resources for genome annotation,
gene expression, and comparative genomics in nonmodel plants [12,13]. EST has also played an important
role in functional genomics research on new functional
gene discovery other than the whole genome [14-16]. By
April 23, 2010, a total of 65,389,085 ESTs had been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) from 1,989 species. The numbers of
ESTs submitted are increasing rapidly at an approximate
monthly rate of one million.
EST libraries for fruit trees such as grape, citrus, almond,
strawberry, apricot, apple, blackberry and peach
[12,13,17-22] have been constructed, sequenced, analyzed
and deposited in databases. However, for P. mume, only
116 hits were found in the dbEST of the GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/dbEST_summary.html in
May 2010, a much lower figure than those of other main
Prunus plants. In this study, a suitable high quality cDNA
library from flowers and fruits of mei was constructed for
the analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and to generate an EST resource for EST-SSR development of P.
mume, the cDNA-based design of microarrays needed for
understanding gene expression, and provide a platform for
mei functional genomic studies on growth, development,
metabolic regulation mechanisms, and so on. In this study,
1,294 unique sequences generated from 4,473 unigenes
have homology with other plants, and 1,130 could be
annotated with known and putative functions.
EST-SSR has been applied in molecular biology studies of fruiting trees as a new technology, especially on
its application in some research fields of pomology,
including genetic diversity analysis [23], genetic linkage
map construction [24,25], comparative mapping [26,27],
molecular phylogeny and cultivar identification [28].
Based on these EST resources, types and frequency of
simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) with a motif length
of 2-6 bp were searched by MISA software. The ESTSSRs generated in this study will be an efficient tool for
additional genetic and genomic research in mei and
even in Prunus species.

Results
Quality inspection of the cDNA library

The cDNA library of mei was constructed based on the
pDNR-LIB vector (Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd).

Page 2 of 11

The results showed that the primary titer of the constructed cDNA library was 1.4 × 106 pfu/mL, while the
recombination rate was about 97.5%, and the distribution of insert sizes of the library was about 1.0-3.0 kb
based on random PCR analysis of 30 clones (Table 1).
These results indicated that the constructed mei cDNA
library was of a high quality (high titer, high recombinant rate and large inserted fragments) and it is also the
first cDNA library of mei flower and fruit.
ESTs obtained and assembled

A total of 10,123 clones were randomly picked and subjected to sequencing for the flower and fruit cDNA
library. The leading vector, tailing of the sequence, and
poor-quality sequences were excluded first, and 8,656
non-redundant EST sequences were obtained, showing a
high success rate of sequencing. The average length of
ESTs without vector was 464 bp. 4,473 non-redundant
unigenes were assembled and most of them (3,672 unigenes, 82.1%) have sequence lengths between 400 and
800 bp, and only 2.4% (110) were shorter than 200 bp
(see Additional file 1). The average length of unigene
sequences was 560 bp, which was longer than that in
other fruit trees such as persimmon [29], grapevine
[12,30], apricot [20] and citrus [31], but shorter than
almond [18] and peach [22]. The minimum and maximum length of these unigenes were 101 bp and 1,471
bp, and the average number of ESTs per unigene was
1.9. These unigenes were composed of 1,492 (33.36%)
contigs and 2,981 (66.64%) singletons, with the number
of average and maximum ESTs per contig being 3.8 and

84, respectively (Table 1). Only 11.6% of the contigs
were composed of more than 4 ESTs (Additional file 2),
suggesting that the redundancy rate is relatively low in
this normalized library. In addition, the sequences data
were submitted to the EST database of NCBI and publicly available (GW868575-GW873047).

We used BLASTX to annotate our P. mume unigene
sequences. 1,294 (28.9%) of the unigenes matched genes in
other species with an expectation value of 1e-10 or better
in a search against the NCBI nr protein database (released
in October 2009), which is lower than other Prunus species, such as apricot [20], and peach [22]. That may
because mei is different from other stone fruit species or
the total number of ESTs sequenced were less than in the
other two species, or for other reasons. The unigenes
which showed similarity with sequences in public databases were classified into 23 groups based on their similarities as in Table 2. The results revealed that 1,130
(87.33%) of matched unigenes were known or predicted
functional genes, 164 (12.67%) with unknown functional.
Those unigenes with unknown functions could be considered as novel or specific genes in mei. Based on the known
or predicted annotation, a large number of unigenes (353,
31.24%) were involved in transport and metabolism
including carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, inorganic, coenzyme and nucleotide. There were also 56 (4.95%) unigenes
involved in DNA/RNA processing and transcription. Only
8 were seen to be involved in the defense mechanisms covering 0.62% of the functional genes.

Alignment against EST database of Prunus species

EST annotation and functional classification

By April 28, 2010, 100,071 ESTs from all Prunus species
had been deposited in NCBI. However, only 116 ESTs
were those of P. mume and this data was much lower
than those Prunus persica (peach; 79,567) and Prunus
armeniaca (apricot; 15,105). It is evident that the ESTs
deposited from this work will provide vital data for P.
mume genomic and genetic study. Here, we first carried
out alignment between the unigenes (4,473) generated
from P. mume and the EST database of two other Prunus species (P. persica, P. armeniaca) openly accessible
in NCBI (by April 23, 2010). The results showed that
948 unigenes of mei aligned with P. armeniaca, at an
identity level of 79%~100% (the average level was
96.2%), while 3,680 were aligned with P. persica and the
average identity level was 96.53%. The numbers and distribution of identity level of mei unigenes which have
aligned with two other species are shown in Figure 1. It
was clearly discernible that most of the identity levels
were over 96%, and 753 and 2,754 mei ESTs have
homology with apricot and peach, respectively. The
description above indicated that most of the P. mume

ESTs had predicted functions and could be a great help
for further research on functional genomics and genetic
analysis of P. mume.
Characterization of microsatellite sequences

Microsatellites or Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) have
become one of the most useful molecular marker systems in plant breeding [32]. They are widely used in
cultivar fingerprinting, genetic diversity assessment,
molecular mapping, and marker assisted breeding. The
development of SSR markers from genomic libraries is
expensive and at times inefficient [33]. However, with
the availability of large numbers of expressed sequence
tags (ESTs), development of SSR markers from ESTs
through data mining has become an efficient and low
cost option for many plant species. In this study, MISA
http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa was used to identify

Figure 1 Identities distribution of alignment results against the EST database of two other Prunus species. The data in red and blue
column were the numbers of mei ESTs which have homology with apricot and peach EST database in different identities.

SSR markers in the unique sequences, and the results
showed that 4,352 sequences were examined, with a
total size of 2,455,352 bp, including 1,233 SSRs distributed in 935 sequences. 225 sequences were examined in
more than 1 SSR loci and 179 SSR loci were present in
compound formation. The SSRs found are summarized
in Table 3. There were a total of 1,233 SSR sites comprising of 438 (35.52%) dinucleotides, 510 (41.36%) trinucleotides, 159 (12.9%) tetranucleotides, 53 (4.3%)
pentanucleotides, and 73 (5.92%) hexanucleotides in the
EST datasets. 41.36% (510) of these are the tri-nucleotide repeats (Table 3), which is in agreement with previous studies of other plant species [34-36]. The main
type of dinucleotides was AG/CT with a frequency of
93.15% (408) and the second was AC/GT (16, 3.65%).
The most frequent tri-nucleotide repeat was AAG/CTT
(195, 38.24%) described in additional file 3.
To investigate whether the potential SSR loci mined are
the true-to-type one and can be used for genetic analysis,
42 EST-SSR primer pairs were designed and verified in
20 mei cultivars. The PCR amplified results showed that
only 14 (33.3%) could generate clear DNA banding patterns with the expected size. Two polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis patterns (amplified with ES3 and ES6 primers) are shown as examples in Figure 2. The information of these SSRs primers are shown in Table 4.

such a marker system can increase the efficiency of
transferring genetic information across species. This
transferability can also make the EST-SSR markers have
good potential application in comparative genomics
between various plants and in their genetic analysis
[34,37,38]. In this study, 14 EST-SSR markers developed
from P. mume ESTs were used to test the transferability
on other two main Prunus species (peach and plum).
Clear DNA fingerprints of PCR amplification using mei
SSR primer could be obtained, such as the polyacrylamide gels of SSR bands amplified by primer pairs 3 (Figure 3). The results showed that 13 of the primer pairs
could produce anticipated simple sequence repeat (SSR)
bands in plum and 12 in peach, and the rate of transferability was about 92% and 86%, respectively. This result
indicated that the EST-SSR primers generated from mei
had a higher generality among Prunus species.

Analysis of genetic diversity

Table 5 List of the cultivars used in this study.

The genetic diversity among 30 varieties of peach, plum,
and mei was analyzed with the new SSR primer pairs
developed. 54 bands were totally amplified and high level
of band polymorphism rate was observed in the mei species (70%), lower in plum (65%) and lest in peach (46%).
A clustering diagram (Figure 4) showed that cultivars of
these three species were divided into three groups, and
the genetic difference among them was obvious, which
was consistent with the fact that they are three different
species. In the peach group, varieties belong to P. persica
(L.) Batsch, such as ‘Xuanchengtiantao’ and ‘Baifeng’,
‘Qidongyoutao’ and ‘Taobadan’, ‘Huozhu’ and ‘Pingbeizi’
were clustered into three subgroups, with high similarity
coefficients of 0.94, 0.94, 0.90, respectively. In the plum
group, cultivars that had same geographical distribution
were clustered together, such as ‘Bulin’ and ‘Xiangjiaoli’,
with a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.88. In the mei
group, all the ten cultivars were separated well, with
‘Koushuu Koume’ and ‘Shinano Koume’ introduced from
Japan being clustered together. These results indicated
that these P. mume SSR markers were useful in the evaluation of genetic relationships between and within the
Prunus species.

Discussion
Mei is an important fruit crop and famous ornamental
tree in China, with processed mei products playing an
important role in the economy and in people’s daily
lives. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are sequenced
portions of messenger RNA, the projects of EST have
been initiated for numerous plant and animal species,
and generated large amount of sequence information
that can be used for gene discovery, functional genetic
studies, and marker development [39]. As we know,
much more molecular researches have been carried out
on mei, but the studies on flower and fruit development
are poor. In this study, a high quality cDNA library of
mei containing highly variable EST sequences was constructed, using a mixture of RNAs from plant materials
at various stages, so as to understand the molecular
mechanisms of growth, development and metabolic regulation at different development stages. The sequencing

functions (Additional file 4), the largest proportion of
functionally assigned ESTs fell into three categories: primary transport and metabolism, protein synthesis and
energy. Alignment of present ESTs was useful for comparative genomics. In this paper, we first compared the
ESTs of P. mume with other Prunus plants, the results
showed that these ESTs sequences were conserved also
had high homology with other Prunus, which providing
an important information for comparative genomics in
Prunus species.
The scope of EST-SSR marker development is limited to the species for which sequence databases
already exist. The SSR marker development for plant
species lacking a sequence database can still be expensive and time consuming. An alternative approach for

SSR marker development in those species could be the
utilization of SSR markers from related species [32].
As the EST-SSR markers are derived from transcribed
regions of DNA, they are expected to be more conserved and have a higher rate of transferability and
polymorphism than genomic SSR markers [40]. By virtue of the sequence conservation of transcribed regions
of the genome, a significant portion of the primer pairs
designed from EST-SSRs is expected to function in
distantly related species [36]. Transferability of ESTderived markers over different taxonomic levels has
been demonstrated earlier [27,41]. In our study, the
majority of our 14 EST-derived SSR loci from P. mume
revealed cross-species amplification with alleles of
comparable sizes in peach and plum. As expected, the

Li et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/66

transferability rate of the markers was high, which suggests that the flanking regions of these SSR loci are
sufficiently conserved, and can be used for comparative
analyses of genetic diversity, population structures and
so on. It also indicated that these SSRs generated from
P. mume can be useful for the development of conserved markers for linkage mapping and QTL analyses
in different Prunus species.
In addition, the polymorphism rate in peach (46%)
was lower than in plum (65%) and mei (70%). This may
be due to the fact that most of the peach cultivars were
from the same breeding program and thus have similar
genetic background. The plum and mei cultivars have
wider geographical distribution and bigger genetic differences. A dendrogram was constructed using the polymorphic bands in 30 cultivars of P. mume, P. persica
and P. salicina, the relationships and diversity among
these three species were analyzed accurately and can be
roughly and visually reflected from the dendrogram.
These results further suggest the applicability of mei
EST-SSR markers in genetic study of Prunus species.

Conclusion
This paper provides the first P. mume flower and fruit
cDNA library. In addition, large scale and valuable EST
information which can be great help to some further
research about gene cloning, gene function and expression analysis of P. mume were generated. Our analysis
further highlights the efficient identification of SSR from
mei ESTs and the high transferability of mei EST-SSR
markers between peach and plum.
Methods
Sample collection and DNA isolation

Fruits and flowers of P. mume ’Xiyeqing’ at different
development stages were collected from the fruiting mei
resource nursery of Nanjing Agricultural University,
Najing PRC. The materials were collected from February
23, 2009 to May 6, 2009 and the collected tissues were
frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -40°
C awaiting RNA extraction. The flowers were collected
at four growing stages including small bud, medium
bud, half-unfolding flower and completely unfolding
flower, while the fruits were collected for seven weeks
until the stone hardening stage, with the average size of
0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6, 3.6 cm diameter.
All the samples of P. mume consisting of six introduced from Japan and used for EST-SSR analysis were
collected on April 4, 2009 in this resource nursery and
their names are described in Table 5. Cultivars of P. persica and P. salicina were obtained from National Germplasm Resources Garden of Peach in Jiangsu Academy
of Agricultural Sciences, Najing PRC, the name of cultivars are also listed in Table 5. Genomic DNA was

Page 8 of 11

isolated from leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen, City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
cDNA library construction

Total RNA from the selected flowers and fruits of each
stage was extracted by using Trizol (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian Co. Ltd.) respectively, and then 1 μg from
each stage were mixed, while cDNA library construction
was carried out according to the Creator SMART cDNA
Construction Kit protocol (Clontech, USA, Cat.
No.634903). The quantity and integrity of RNA was
detected by BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Gene Company
Limited) while electrophoresis was done on agarose with
Ethidium Bromide. The first strand and double strand
cDNA were synthesized according to the protocol of
Creator SMART cDNA Construction Kit (Clontech,
USA, Cat.No.634903).
For first strand cDNA synthesis: 3 μl RNA sample, 1
μl SMART IV oligonucleotide (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG-3′) and 1
μl CDS-3 M adapter (10 μM, 5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCGAGGCGGCC (T) 20 VN-3′)
were mixed and incubated at 72°C for 2 min and placed
in ice for another 2 min. 2.0 μl 5 × First-Strand Buffer,
1.0 μl DDT (20 mM), 1.0 μl dNTP Mix (10 mM), 1.0 μl
PowerScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd) were added to a total volume of 10 μl,
mixed well and incubated at 42°C for 1 hour.
Double strand cDNA synthesis: The single strand
cDNA was amplified for double strand cDNA synthesis
by long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR), in
the following steps, 2 μl single-strand cDNA were added
to 80 μl ddH2O, 10 μl 10 × Advantage 2 PCR Buffer, 2 μl
50 × dNTP Mix, 4 μl M1 PCR Primer (10 μM, 5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′), and 2 μl 50 ×
Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix then topped with ddH2O to
make a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was centrifuged then amplified as follows: 95°C for 1 min; 20 cycles
of 95°C for 15 sec and 68°C for 6 min. Five microliters of
the centrifuged PCR product were pipetted onto a 1.2%
agarose/EtBr gel to check the double strand (ds)-cDNA
quality. The concentration of the ds-cDNA was estimated
by comparing with a suitable DNA marker.
The remaining double-strand cDNA was digested by
SfiI Enzyme then sized, purified by a QIA quick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen Cat.No.2810) and packaged in
order to filter the fragments shorter than 400 bp. Double strand cDNA with cohesive ends was finally ligated
into pDNR-LIB vector by T4 ligase, the recombinant
vector was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B by
electroporation at 2.1 KV, cultured overnight in 37°C
after directly applying onto a media plate with
chloramphenicol.

Sequencing for the clones

After the cDNA library was plated onto LB media
plates, the white clones were picked into a 96-well block
containing 800 μl LB culture media (supplied with
chloramphenicol 50 mg/ml) and incubated at 230 rpm
and 37°C overnight. Before large scale sequencing, PCR
reaction was initially conducted to check the size of
inserted fragments using random selection of 30 clones
[42]. Finally, about 10,000 fresh clones were sent to Beijing Huada Gene Company (Beijing, P.R. China) for
sequencing.
EST processing

Among the vector sequences, low quality and redundant
sequences were rejected with Chromas, Phred [43] and
phd2fasta. Sequences longer than 100 bp were outputted
after converting to FASTA forms. Uniform sequences
were assembled using CAP3 [44] software for splicing
into contigs with two or more ESTs.
EST annotation and function

For further functional annotation, comparative and classification analysis, the non-redundant sequences (edited
ESTs sequences) considered as valid were subjected to
BlastX analysis against the non-redundant protein database (nr) of National Center of Biotechnology Institute
(NCBI) to search for similarity. Search results were
imported into Microsoft Office Excel where sequence
matches with E-value scores ≤10-10 were considered significant and used to categorize the ESTs based on their
putative or known functions of plant genes.

contained corresponding repeat units were selected for
marker development.
EST-SSR primers designed and PCR amplication

Primer pairs flanking repeats with a minimum length 20
bp were designed using by Primer3.0 program http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ and the parameters are as follows: Primer GC%: 40% ~ 60%, and the optimum value
of 50%; Primer size: 18 ~ 22 bp; Primer TM: 50 ~ 60°C;
Product size ranges: 150-350 bp. The primers designed
were also identified by Oligo6 software in order to avoid
the primer dimers, hairpin structure and the occurrence
of mismatch and so on. Primers were synthesized by
Invitrogen, Shanghai PR China.
The PCR amplification reactions were performed
using an Eppendorf Authorized Thermal Cycler each
and conducted in a total volume of 25 μl containing 50
-100 ng template DNA, 20 pmol each primer, 2 Units
Taq DNA polymerase (purchased from Takara Biotechnology, Dalian Co. Ltd.), 2.5 μl 10 × PCR buffer, 2 μl
MgCl 2 (2.5 mM), 1.5 μl dNTPs (2.5 mM), and added
ddH2O to the total volume. The PCR conditions were:
94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec,
50 ~ 60°C for 40 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. To check for PCR product
quality, 8 μl of the PCR reaction was visualized on a
1.5% agarose gel and the remaining reaction was then
electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE
buffer at 80 W for 100 to 120 min. Gels were stained
with silver nitrate following the protocol detailed by
Bassam [46] with few modifications and photographed
in white light.

EST alignment against Prunus EST database

The software package of blast was download from the
FTP server ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/
of NCBI, then compiled and installed according to the
instructions [45]. Alignment of nucleic acids were carried on among the ESTs of P. persica, P. armeniaca submitted in NCBI (by the end of April 1, 2010) and
unigenes generated from P.mume cDNA library by
using blastn with e-10 as the parameter.
Identification of EST-SSRs

The EST library was searched for sequences containing
SSRs using MISA [37], a Perl script able to detect perfect as well as compound microsatellites in nucleotide
sequences. Compound microsatellites were defined as
repeats interrupted by a non-repetitive sequence of a
maximum 100 nucleotides. MISA was set with the following minimum length criteria for the extraction of
repeated units (unit size/minimum number of repeats):
at least six dinucleotides (2/6); at least five trinucleotides
(3/5); three tetranucleotides (4/3), three pentanucleotides (5/3) and three hexanucleotides (6/3). Sequences

Cross-species amplification

To assess the transferability of our EST-SSR markers,
we tested their amplification in other Prunus species
containing 10 cultivars of P. persica (peach) and 10 of P.
salicina (plum). The PCR amplification reactions were
performed as the same as above.
Data Analysis

According to presence or absence of bands on the polyacrylamide gel, the same electrophoretic bands were
recorded as 1, no bands were recorded as 0. The polymorphisms data were inputted into Excel for the cluster
analysis using NYSYS-pc software and a dendrogram
was generated for the analysis of genetic relationship
and diversity among the varieties of peach, plum and
mei.
