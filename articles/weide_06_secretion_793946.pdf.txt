Abstract
Background: The non-pathogenic ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila is one of the best-characterized
unicellular eucaryotes used in various research fields. Previous work has shown that this unicellular
organism provides many biological features to become a high-quality expression system, like
multiplying to high cell densities with short generation times in bioreactors. In addition, the
expression of surface antigens from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the ciliate
Ichthyophthirius multifiliis suggests that T. thermophila might play an important role in vaccine
development. However, the expression of functional mammalian or human enzymes remains so far
to be seen.
Results: We have been able to express a human enzyme in T. thermophila using expression
modules that encode a fusion protein consisting of the endogenous phospholipase A1 precursor and
mature human DNaseI. The recombinant human enzyme is active, indicating that also disulfide
bridges are correctly formed. Furthermore, a detailed N-glycan structure of the recombinant
enzyme is presented, illustrating a very consistent glycosylation pattern.
Conclusion: The ciliate expression system has the potential to become an excellent expression
system. However, additional optimisation steps including host strain improvement as wells as
measures to increase the yield of expression are necessary to be able to provide an alternative to
the common E. coli and yeast-based systems as well as to transformed mammalian cell lines.

Background
Throughout the last decades the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila has been used as the model system of choice in

many areas of molecular, cell and developmental biology
[1-4]. For example milestone discoveries like ribozymes
that enable RNA-mediated catalysis [5], the basic analysis

of dynein motors [6], the finding of telomeres and telomerases [7,8] and the function of histone acetyltransferases
in transcription were made in Tetrahymena. Very recently,
the discovery of small scan RNA elucidates the role of
RNAi mediated genome rearrangement [9].
In previous experiments T. thermophila has been used to
express proteins of two phylogenetic closely related alveolate species. Gaertig et al. showed expression of the I-antigen of the ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, a parasite that
causes the white spot disease of freshwater fish [10,11].
Later on it could be demonstrated that the GPI-anchored
circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum, was expressed and targeted to the
surface of T. thermophila. Consequently, T. thermophila
could also play an important role in strategies for vaccine
development [12]. All three protozoans Tetrahymena thermophila, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis as well as the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum belong to the alveolates, a
distinct phylogenetic group that includes ciliates, apicomplexans and dinoflagellates. They are characterised by
both very AT-rich genomes and an unusual codon usage
[13-16]. However, so far the expression of functional
mammalian or human proteins in T. thermophila remains
to be shown.
The T. thermophila genome has just been completely
sequenced by an NIH program and can now be used for
thorough proteome analysis (The Institute for Genomic
Research [17]). Furthermore, it is known that T. thermophila cells grow fast to high cell densities in inexpensive
media and simple bioreactor infrastructure [18,19]. Overall, these are the basis for developing an excellent expression system and using the ciliate T. thermophila for
biotechnology applications [20]. In contrast to the previously done expression experiments here we report for the
first time the heterologous expression of a human enzyme
that subsequently is secreted into the surrounding
medium.
We selected the human DNaseI to demonstrate that T.
thermophila as an expression host is able to produce functional human enzymes. Human DNase I is a 29.3 kD glycoprotein with two N-glycosylation sites at Asn18 and
Asn106 and two calcium ion binding sites. One of two
intrachenar disulfide bridges (Cys101/Cys104 and Cys173/
Cys209) is crucial for enzyme activity [21]. Aging of the
beta-sandwich shaped enzyme is accompanied by deamidation of Asn74 thereby reducing enzyme activity and
facilitating degradation of the protein [22]. Interestingly,
recombinant human DNase I produced in CHO cells
(Pulmozyme®, Roche) is administered to patients with
cystic fibrosis by inhalation in order to reduce sputum viscoelasticity and to improve lung function.

Results
Expression and secretion of functional human DNase I by
T. thermophila
Aim of this study was to show that T. thermophila is capable of expressing a human enzyme which is secreted under
the control of an endogenous T. thermophila derived precursor peptide. The codon bias of ciliates has been analysed in detail [13,15,16]. In summary it is quite different
from human genes. 15 of the 63 possible codons in
human DNase I are very rare codons in T. thermophila
according to the definition of Wutschick and Karrer: A rare
codon is a codon that is no more than 10% of the total
and less than 50% of the fraction expected if all synonyms
are used at equal frequency. As an example, codons that
encode arginine illustrate this problem. From six possible
codons only AGA is preferentially used in highly
expressed genes (96%) in T. thermophila. The other five
codons AGG, CGA, CGC, CGG and CGU are only used in
less than 5% of the total arginine codons and especially
the CGG codon is very rare. The original human DNaseI
sequence (accession number: NM_005223) consists of 14
arginines, but only two of the human original codons are
optimal for expression in the T. thermophila host system.
As both groups Wutschick and Karrer as well as Larsen et
al. report a correlation between frequently used codons
and a higher expression level of genes that contain these
codons we used a synthetic "codon-adapted" DNaseI gene
to avoid problems in expression.

The synthetic optimised gene encodes the human 282
amino acids (aa) of the human precursor of DNase I
(accession number: DQ073047). In summary 67% of all
codons (188 of 282) were changed into codons that are
frequently used in T. thermophila. From the 188 optimised
codons more than 50% (97 of 188) are changed at the
third position. Only one third (93 of 282) of the original
sequence seemed to be suitable to express a human
enzyme in the ciliate. The original human DNase I cDNA
and the codon adapted sequence are compared in figure
1. In our experiments we want to express and secrete the
human DNaseI by a ciliate system. Therefore we constructed expression cassettes that encode parts of the precursor sequence of the PLA1 (phospholipase A1) gene
(accession number: AJ508393) and the mature human
DNaseI (aa 23 to 281) of the synthetic gene [23]. The PLA1
prepro-peptide has significant similarity to members of
the cathepsin L family and mediates secretion into the
medium [24]. We have previously characterized the cleavage site between the pro-peptide and the mature enzyme
to be between aa 110 and 111 by sequencing of the N-terminus of the mature PLA1 enzyme (unpublished data).
The first fusion protein encodes the PLA1 signal peptide as
determined by SignalP [25] (aa 1–23 of PLA1), an additional 13 amino acid spacer (aa 24–36 of PLA1) and the
mature DNaseI (aa 23 to 281 encoded by the synthetic

human genes 67% of 283 coding triplets of the original human codons (WT) were changed into codons that are known to be
mostly present in highly expressed T. thermophila genes (CO) [13,16]. The adapted codons are marked by gray boxes. The corresponding amino acid sequence is given in single letter code; N-glycosylation sites are highlighted in bold letters, cysteines

Expression of functional human DNaseI
Expression of functional human DNaseI. a: The structure concept of the expression cassettes. For all expression cassettes we used the cell-cycle dependent H4-1 histone or the Cd-inducible MTT1 promotor and the beta tubulin 2 (BTU2) terminator sequence. Selection was done by the neo resistance gene (neoR). Secretion of the rhDNase was regulated by parts of
the endogenous precursor of PLA1. We used the first 36, 110 and 115 amino acids of the PLA-precursor. The mature human
DNase I corresponds to the aa 23–281. b: We obtained an anti DNaseI serum by using CHO derived DNase I (Pulmozyme) as
an antigen. After that the serum was tested by western blot using de-glycosylated DNaseI (PNGaseF treated, F+ lane1) as well
as the glycosylated protein. No significant difference in the signal strength could be observed, suggesting that the N-glycan
structure of rhDNase has no, or only a minor influence on the avidity of the serum. c: Secretion of processed recombinant
human DNaseI into the media. Lane1: 20 µl supernatant of the T. thermophila wildtype strain B1868.7, negative control; Lane2:
20 µl supernatant of mock-(EGFP) transformed T. thermophila; Lane 3–5: 20 µl supernatant of T. thermophila cells that were
transformed with expression plasmids, carrying the spPLA36, ppPLA110 and ppPLA115 prepro-peptides, respectively. d: Determination of DNase activity in 10 µl supernatant of transformed T. thermophila. Control: mock-(EGFP) expressing cells; Histone:
cell cycle dependent expression of ppPLA115; MTT1: inducible expression of ppPLA115; (MTT1-Cd: non-induced; MTT1 + Cd:
induced). e: Different amounts of rhDNaseI from CHO cells (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 ng) were used to roughly quantify the yield of
rhDNase in 30 µl ppPLA115 supernatant of T. thermophila. f: Demonstration of up-scalability by comparing cell titres during 50
litre fermentation (black) and 400 ml shaker flask cultivation (gray) of rhDNase I secreting T. thermophila.

gene). The second hybrid protein consists of the whole
prepro-peptide of PLA1 (aa 1–110) and the mature DNaseI. The third cassette is similar to the second except for
the first five amino acids of the secreted mature PLA1 (single letter code GEATE; aa 111–115). This cassette was
made to ensure an optimal cleavage of the proPLA1-DNaseI fusion protein by endogenous pro-peptidases. The
expression cassettes were cloned into the pH4T2 vector
that consists of two rDNA origins and the neomycin resistance gene (neoR) [26]. Both the neoR gene and the PLA1DNasehybrid genes were controlled by the cell-cycle
dependent histone promoter H4-1 and the beta tubulin 2
BTU2 terminator (Figure 2a). We transformed conjugating T. thermophila with the expression plasmids by electroporation, and monitored the successful transformation by
selection against paromomycin. Supernatants of the different cultures were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western
blot for secretion of the recombinant human DNaseI
(rhDNaseI). All samples analysed expressed and secreted
rhDNaseI, regardless of the length of the PLA1-prepropeptide sequence fused to the DNaseI (Figure 2c). Furthermore, all expression modules resulted in rhDNaseI proteins of the same size (~35 kD), indicating the existence of
a processing mechanism that is independent of a conserved pro-peptidase recognition site, similar to the
known processing of granule lattice proteins of dense core
vesicles in T. thermophila [27]. A control strain that
expresses and secretes EGFP and the non-transformed T.
thermophila wild type strain B1868.7 was used. Supernatants of cells expressing the ppPLA115-DNase fusion protein were assayed for DNase activity. Compared to
supernatants of mock-transformed cells a significantly elevated enzyme activity was measured. The heterologous
expression of human DNaseI by T. thermophila was also
analysed by application of the inducible metallothionein1 promoter (MTT1) system [28] (Figure 2d). In these
experiments the expression of the ppPLA115-DNase fusion
protein was regulated by the addition of Cadmium to the
medium. The induced cells exhibited a significantly elevated DNase activity in the supernatant. In non-induced
cultures the DNase activity remained – just like expected
– close to the basal level. This clearly argues that the
observed increased DNaseI activity in the supernatant is
due to the secretion of functional rhDNase, confirming
the experiments shown in Figure 2c. The basal activity
measured in the negative control corresponds to at least
two endogenous DNases (data not shown). As rhDNase
combines in one enzyme all assets necessary for development of a novel expression system with secretion,
disulfide bridge formation and glycosylation site recognition the main focus of our initial experiments was to illustrate that not only antigens from related species (I.
multifiliis and P. falciparum) but also functional human
enzymes of biotechnological interest can be expressed and
secreted by the ciliate system. Nevertheless, to give a first

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/6/19

and roughly estimation of the yield of secreted rhDNase
we used semi-quantitative Western blotting. Therefore we
generated a polyclonal antiserum against the rhDNaseI
from CHO cells and tested first if the N-glycosylation has
an impact on avidity. Figure 2b clearly illustrates that both
glycosylated DNaseI as well as the de-glycosylated enzyme
display the same signal strength in Western blot analysis,
suggesting that almost all of the antigenic epitopes recognised are on protein level and that the N-glycan structure
plays an unimportant role in avidity. This allows us to give
a first and rough estimation about the amount of the
secreted DNaseI, by semi-quantitative Western blotting.
We found ca. 100 µg rhDNase per litre supernatant fluid
(see Figure 2e; 1 ng/10 µl supernatant). This crudely estimated amount combined with the determined DNase
activity of 400 U per litre supernatant (4 mU/10 µl, see
Figure 2d) means that a "specific" activity can be determined as ca. 4 Units per µg rhDNase. For most biotechnical applications it is crucial to obtain a first impression
whether or not the cultivation of transformants can be
scaled up. Therefore we tested if the rhDNA secreting
clone is growing in the same way as previously described
for wildtype strains [20,29]. RhDNase I expressing cells
were grown on a small scale (400 ml shaker flask), as well
as in 2 and 50 litre batch fermentations. Figure 2f illustrates that growth (up to more than 2 × 106 cells/ml) of
transformants is independent of the culture volume. Furthermore up-scaling does not alter results shown in Figure
2b–d.
Glycosylation pattern on recombinant proteins derived
from T. thermophila
Transport through the ER and Golgi compartments usually is accompanied by the addition of N-glycans. We
addressed this point for the recombinant DNaseI and performed band-shift assays by applying N-glycosidase F
(PNgase F) to immunoprecipitated DNaseI from supernatant of transformed T. thermophila cells (Figure 3a). An
aliquot of this IP sample (F+) revealed a significant bandshift on a 15% SDS-gel when compared to the control
without N-glycosidaseF treatment (F-). Glycosylated and
de-glycosylated DNaseI from CHO cells was used as control. The significant reduction of the molecular weight of
secreted rhDNaseI from T. thermophila demonstrates that
the DNase becomes glycosylated while shuttling through
the ER and Golgi. Furthermore comparison of lane 3 and
5 also shows that the non-glycosylated rhDNase from T.
thermophila and CHO-cells are running at heights of comparable molecular weight. Next we applied a Concanavalin A (Con A) pulldown assay to test whether the glycans
of secreted rhDNaseI are terminated by N-terminal mannoses, as described for endogenous secreted enzymes of
Tetrahymena [30,31]. We used the same cell-free supernatants as in the IP approach (compare Figure 3a lane 4 and
5). The B1868.7 wildtype supernatant spiked with glyco-

N-glycan structure on recombinant secreted human DNase I. a: Band-shift assay: rhDNase I from CHO cells and
secreted rhDNase I from T. thermophila were de-glycosylated. The treatment with PNGase F (F+) results in a significant bandshift, when compared to the controls (F-), illustrating that the secreted rhDNase I of T. thermophila becomes glycosylated. As T.
thermophila rhDNase I had been concentrated by immunoprecipitation, additional bands of antibody-chains appear in Western
blotting. The DNase signals are highlighted by asterisks. b: Concanavalin A pulldown assay: Supernatants of transformed T. thermophila strain and a wildtype strain (B1868.7) were analysed. The supernatant of the wildtype was spiked with equal amounts
(2 µg) of glycosylated (F-) or de-glycosylated (F+) rhDNase I from CHO cells, respectively. Only mannose-terminated glycosylated rhDNase is recovered by Con A (lane 3), glycosylated (F-) and de-glycosylated rhDNase I (F+) from CHO cells did not
bind to ConA beads (lanes 1 and 2). c: DSA-FACE N-glycan analysis of T. thermophila rhDNase I: This data illustrates the highly
consistent N-glycan structure on rhDNaseI produced in T. thermophila. All N-glycans are mannose terminated, as shown by
digestion with jack bean mannosidase in the lower panel. The most prominent structure is the Man3GlcNAc2 core pattern with
additional alpha 1,2 bound mannoses (two middle panels). d: DSA-FACE N-glycan analysis of CHO rhDNase I: On the CHO
derived rhDNase I more than 20 distinct peaks, each corresponding to a different N-glycan, are observed in the untreated
sample. This typical complex profile of mammalian cells is in sharp contrast to the consistent T. thermophila glycosylation. Even
removal of terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid by treatment with sialidase still leads to a large number of various glycans (lower
panel).

sylated and de-glycosylated rhDNaseI from CHO cells was
used as control. We added ConA beads and performed
extensive washes, to avoid unspecific binding. Only the
rhDNaseI from T. thermophila was recovered by the ConA
beads, indicating that it predominantly contains α-Dmannose terminated glycosylation chains. The DNaseI from
CHO cells which contains a different, complex N-glycan
feature with terminal galactose, N-acetylglucoseamine or
sialic acid residues and the de-glycosylated rhDNaseI did
not bind to the ConA (Figure 3b). The specificity of the
ConA pulldown assays was nicely confirmed by the DSAFACE technology for N-glycan profiling [32]: These results
illustrate that almost all recombinant protein displays a
mannose terminated oligo-glycosylation pattern, comparable to endogenous secreted proteins [30]. The most
prominent N-glycan is the Man3GlcNAc2 structure (Figure. 3c). All structures can be reduced to ManGlcNAc2
using an unspecific mannosidase, indicating the presence
of mannose only at the core. Overall the T. thermophila
pattern is very consistent (see Figure 3c, second panel).
This consistency is even more obvious when compared to
the typical complex glycosylation of rhDNase I from CHO
cells shown in Figure 3d (see second and third panel).

improvements of this very young expression system.
Established and commonly known systems surely currently have higher expression rates (e.g. 5 mg/l rhDNaseI
in COS-cells [35]). Yet there are other criteria to be met for
a new expression host to be adopted by the biotech industry like up scalability, simple and inexpensive media,
growing to high cell densities, protease-deficiency and
ease of cell line engineering of the production strains that
all contribute to low cost of manufacturing. In T. thermophila these requirements can be fulfilled because a simple bioreactor infrastructure is sufficient for production.
Moreover, high cell density fermentation with cell retention is available in our laboratories [18,29]. The use of
such techniques allows us to obtain cell densities in inexpensive media of more than 2.2 × 107 cells/ml, equivalent
to 48 g dry weight, thereby reducing the cost of manufacturing. Genetic tools are at hand to increase promoter
activity and to improve strains easily by targeted knock
outs of proteases, random mutagenesis and secretion optimisation. These measures will lead to an excellent expression-secretion system bearing a competitive alternative to
the common and technically mature systems like E. coli,
yeast and transformed mammalian cell lines.

Discussion

Methods

Here we report for the first time the expression and secretion of functional human DNaseI, illustrating that not
only surface proteins from related species but also mammalian proteins are potential candidates. To avoid problems in expression due to the fact that the codon bias in T.
thermophila is quite different to that of mammalian cells
we used a codon adapted gene in which critical triplets
were changed (see figure 1). All hybrid constructs used
lead to expression of the rhDNaseI in T. thermophila. These
results clearly show that the here presented ciliate system
has the high potential to become an attractive alternative
for expression and secretion of complex functional
human proteins. Furthermore, unlike in yeast expression
systems, where hyper-glycosylation causes problems on
recombinant proteins, the rhDNase secreted by T. thermophila carries a consistent, oligo-glycosylated N-glycan
structure [33,34]. Additionally, the predominant
Man3GlcNAc2 sequence on T. thermophila derived proteins
could be an interesting starting point for in vitro glycosylation to produce homogenous glycoproteins. A well
known problem of bacterial expression systems is the
proper formation of disulfide bridges. As the expression
and secretion of rhDNase I in the free-living protozoan T.
thermophila yields a highly active enzyme, at least the
required internal disulfide bridge (Cys173-Cys209) must
have formed in the right manner [21].

Strains, cultivation and fermentation
Tetrahymena thermophila strains B1868.4, B1868.7 and B
2068.1 were kindly provided by Peter J. Bruns and cultivated in skimmed milk medium (2% skimmed milk,
0.5% yeast extract, 0.1% ferrous sulphate chelate solution
and 1% glucose) on a Braun Certomat BS-1 at 80 rpm and
30°C. For fermentations a Braun UD50 (50 litre) and Bioengineering KLF2000 (2 litre) equipped with standard
Rushton impellers were used. Stirrer speed was limited to
300 and 400 rpm respectively; pO2 was set to 25%.

Conclusion

The roughly estimated yield of 100 µg/L rhDNase I in T.
thermophila is a promising starting point for further

Generation and transformation of expression plasmids
Transformation of cells was performed with plasmids
derived from the pH4T2 vector [26]. For the Cd-inducible
expression the histone promoter in the ppPLA115-construct was substituted by the T. thermophila MTT1-promoter. Metallothioneins, that are upregulated upon stress,
are metal binding proteins playing a role in detoxification
of the cell. In Tetrahymena the MTT1-promoter can be
induced best by the addition of Cadmium [28]. Cloning
of the expression modules and mutagenesis were performed with standard techniques. To ensure a translation
of the fusion proteins a synthetic, codon optimised
human DNaseI gene was used [13,15]. The synthesis was
performed by a solid phase process described in German
Patent DE 19812103.2 by the company ATG biosynthetics, Merzhausen Germany. In brief oligonucleotides were
specifically annealed 3' at the immobilized single
stranded DNA and extended by a polymerase. A double
strand-specific 5' nuclease digestion enables subsequent

annealing of a new primer 3' at the growing synthetic gene
and the cycle starts over. The sequence has been submitted
to genbank (Accession number: DQ073047).
Generation of polyclonal anti human DNase I antibodies
from rabbit
Recombinant human DNaseI from CHO cells (Pulmozyme®, Roche) was used to generate a specific antiserum
from rabbit against human DNaseI. Affinity purification
using a protein A/protein G mixture was performed in
order to minimize background signals.
SDS-PAGE and Western
The aliquots of SPP supernatants were resuspended in
sample buffer and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. rhDNaseI from CHO cells (Pulmozyme®, Roche) served as reference. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes and blocked in PBS containing 0.05%
Tween20 and 5% skimmed milk (PBS-TM). The anti-rhDNaseI was used in a 1:500 dilution in PBS-TM. After washing with PBS/T and application of HRP-conjugated anti
rabbit serum the blots were developed using chemiluminescence.
Immunoprecipitation of DNase I from T. thermophila
supernatants
Anti DNase serum was coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's
instructions. T. thermophila supernatants were applied to
the column. After washing with PBS, bound protein was
eluted with 0.1 M HCl-glycin pH2.8 and neutralized with
2 M Tris.
DNase I activity assay
The methyl green based DNase activity assay was performed as already published [36]. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 24 h on a microtiter plate. Absorbance
was measured at 620 nm.

Calibration of the assay was achieved by different
amounts of defined DNase I Units of Pulmozyme® from
Roche (CHO derived) in each experiment and linear
regression. These results combined with semi-quantitative
western blotting were used to calculate the specific activity
of expressed DNase I.

osylation of rhDNaseI was used to control the glycosylation assay. Concanavalin pull down assay: We used ConA
coupled to Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed
and resuspended in PBS in order to prepare a 50% slurry.
200 µl of the 50% slurry was added to cell-free supernatant. The beads were incubated for 3 h under rotation at
room temperature to allow the Con A beads to bind to the
glycosylated proteins. After that, Con A beads were collected by centrifugation (2 min, 1000 × g at 4°C) and subsequently washed in PBS with 1% TritonX-100. All
samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
DSA-FACE analysis of N-glycans: Purified recombinant
DNaseI from transformed T. thermophila and rhDNase I
from CHO cells were analysed by the DSA-FACE N-glycan
analysis method, as previously described [32]. Enzymatic
digestions (T. reesei alpha 1,2-mannosidase, jack bean
mannosidase and Arthrobacter ureafaciens alpha 2,3/6/8/9sialidase) were done in 20 mM NaAc, pH 5.5 for 16 h.
