Abstract
Background: The oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica is one of the most economically important fish
pathogens. There is a dramatic recrudescence of Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture since the use
of the toxic organic dye malachite green was banned in 2002. Little is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying pathogenicity in S. parasitica and other animal pathogenic oomycetes. In this
study we used a genomics approach to gain a first insight into the transcriptome of S. parasitica.
Results: We generated 1510 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a mycelial cDNA library of S.
parasitica. A total of 1279 consensus sequences corresponding to 525944 base pairs were
assembled. About half of the unigenes showed similarities to known protein sequences or motifs.
The S. parasitica sequences tended to be relatively divergent from Phytophthora sequences. Based
on the sequence alignments of 18 conserved proteins, the average amino acid identity between S.
parasitica and three Phytophthora species was 77% compared to 93% within Phytophthora. Several S.
parasitica cDNAs, such as those with similarity to fungal type I cellulose binding domain proteins,
PAN/Apple module proteins, glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, as well as serine and cysteine protease
inhibitors, were predicted to encode secreted proteins that could function in virulence. Some of
these cDNAs were more similar to fungal proteins than to other eukaryotic proteins confirming
that oomycetes and fungi share some virulence components despite their evolutionary distance
Conclusion: We provide a first glimpse into the gene content of S. parasitica, a reemerging
oomycete fish pathogen. These resources will greatly accelerate research on this important
pathogen. The data is available online through the Oomycete Genomics Database [1].

Background
Water molds such as Saprolegnia and Aphanomyces species
are responsible for devastating infections on fish in aquaculture, fish farms and hobby fish tanks [2,3]. Members of
the genus Saprolegnia cause saprolegniosis, a disease that

is characterized by visible white or grey patches of filamentous mycelium on the body or fins of freshwater fish
[2]. The oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica is economically
one of the most important fish pathogens, especially on
salmon and trout species. It causes tens of million dollar

losses to aquaculture business worldwide, notably in Scotland, Scandinavia, Chile, Japan, Canada, and the USA
[4,5]. S. parasitica infections are second only to bacterial
diseases. In Japan, there is an annual mortality rate of 50%
in coho salmon and elver due to S. parasitica infections [58]. In the United States, "winter kill" in catfish caused by
Saprolegnia results in financial loses of up to 50%, which
represents an economic loss of $40 million [6]. In Scotland, saprolegniosis also causes significant losses with the
main problem occurring in salmon hatcheries.
Previously, Saprolegnia infections were kept under control
with malachite green, an organic dye that is very efficient
at killing the pathogen. However, since 2002 the use of
malachite green has been banned around the world, due
to its carcinogenic and toxicological effects. This has
resulted in dramatic recrudescence of Saprolegnia infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel alternative methods of management of Saprolegniosis.
Saprolegnia is often considered an opportunistic pathogen
that is saprotrophic and necrotrophic [6]. However, it has
become apparent that some S. parasitica strains are highly
virulent and able to cause primary infections on salmon
[3,9,10]. Infections occur on both eggs and fish. On eggs
the disease is manifested by profuse mycelial growth on
the egg surface resulting in rapid death. On fish, Saprolegnia invades epidermal tissues and can infect the entire surface of the body [11]. It causes cellular necrosis as well as
dermal and epidermal damage, which ultimately leads to
death by heamodilution [5,12]. Severe Saprolegnia infections result in lethargic behaviour, loss of equilibrium and
commonly death of the fish [12,13].
Oomycete species can be pathogenic on plants, insects,
crustaceans, fish, vertebrate animals, and various microorganisms [14,15]. Oomycetes, including Saprolegnia, have
many fungus-like characteristics, but are not true fungi. A
number of studies have indicated that they should be classified with the golden-brown algae and diatoms as stramenopiles [16-18]. This implies that oomycetes evolved
genetic and biochemical mechanisms for interaction with
animals and plants that are different from those of true
fungi [14]. Indeed, oomycetes have several clearly defined
developmental stages that are not found in fungal pathogens. For example, Saprolegnia species have a complex life
cycle that includes both sexual and asexual reproduction.
The asexual spore or sporangium is formed at the end of
hyphal cells and can release many motile primary
zoospores [6]. The primary zoospores swim only for a
short time before they encyst and release a secondary
zoospore. Secondary zoospores are motile for a longer
period and are the main infection spore [5,11]. Secondary
zoospores are able to encyst and release new zoospores
several times. This process is called "polyplanetism" [19],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/46

and may have evolved to allow the zoospores to have several attempts to locate and infect a host [6]. Uniquely
within the class of oomycetes, secondary zoospores of
Saprolegnia can possess hairs that are thought to be
required for attachment to the host [11,19]. For example
zoospores of S. parasitica have long hooked hairs that are
believed to increase efficiency of the attachment to the
fish hosts [12,19].
Although different in their selection of host organisms,
plant and fish pathogenic oomycetes have many features
in common. Evidently, the formation of specialised spore
structures including zoospores, sporangia and oospores
are similar. Also, infection strategies are comparable to
some extent, involving encystment and attachment of
zoospores on host surfaces, and penetration of host tissues. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that similar to biotrophic plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as Peronospora
and several Phytophthora species, suppression of host
defenses is likely to play a critical role in Saprolegnia
pathogenesis. Host defense suppression by oomycetes
remains poorly understood and only a few pathogen molecules that suppress host defenses have been identified in
pathogenic oomycetes [20-22]. There is intriguing evidence that Saprolegnia-infected fish appear to be immunocompromised [23,24]. Possibly, virulence factors secreted
by the pathogen might account for the immuno-suppression and the lack of an effective response to pathogen
infection.
Despite the huge economic importance of animal pathogenic oomycetes, such as S. parasitica, very little is known
about the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying development, pathogenicity and host specificity [14].
A thorough understanding of the basic molecular processes in Saprolegnia, the nature of the interactions with its
hosts, and the identification of genes and proteins
involved in these processes, could lead to novel control
strategies that increase fish health, reduce disease losses
and increase profits. In this study we used a genomics
approach to gain a first insight into the transcriptome of
S. parasitica. We generated random cDNA sequences
(expressed sequence tags or ESTs) from a cDNA library of
S. parasitica to identify genes that inform us about the
biology of this organism and that could be involved in
pathogenicity. We provide an overview of the identified
sequences as well as a detailed description of a number of
notable cDNAs. The data is available through a publicly
accessible website as part of the Oomycete Genomics
Database (OGD) [1].

Results
cDNA library and sequencing
We constructed a unidirectional cDNA library using
mRNA isolated from mycelium of ATCC90214, a S.

parasitica strain isolated from diseased salmon [25]. Mycelium was obtained from nutrient deprived 29-day-old in
vitro culture. In other oomycetes, such as P. infestans, similar treatments promote the expression of stress-related
genes and possibly mimic infection conditions [26,27]. A
total of 2296 sequencing reactions corresponding to the 5'
end of the cDNA insert were performed. Of these, 2102
gave readable sequences. The sequences and the quality
(phred) scores were fed into NCGR's X Genome Initiative
(XGI) [28] annotation pipeline and subjected to further
quality controls [29]. 1510 ESTs remained after vector and
low quality sequences were removed. Of these, 5% were
assessed to be in reverse orientation based on the occurrence of at least eight consecutive A residues within the
first 38 bp. Following additional quality screening and
assembly, 1279 consensus sequences (so-called unigenes)
were obtained consisting of 1146 singletons and 133 consensus with two or more ESTs. In total, 525,944 bp of
assembled sequences were obtained corresponding to an
average consensus sequence length of 411 bp. At 61%, the
GC content of the assembled sequences was relatively
high and similar to the GC content reported for Phytophthora spp. (57–58%) [14,30].
Sequence annotation
The 1279 consensus sequences were annotated using the
methods implemented in the XGI pipeline (see methods).
A total of 609 sequences (48%) showed significant similarities to known protein sequences (E value < 10-5) based
on BLASTX searches, 398 (31%) gave significant hits to
protein motifs in the BLOCKS+ database, and 600 (47%)
gave hits to the InterPro protein motif database with at
least one of the 12 algorithms implemented in InterProScan. Among these, InterPro database searches with
HmmPfam revealed 340 hits. In total, 585 consensus
sequences (46%) could be assigned identities based on
the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (see methods). The
differences between the different analyses are expected for
such bioinformatics annotations and reflect, among other
things, differences in sensitivity between the various programs. A total of 70 sequences were positive with the PexFinder algorithm and are candidate for carrying signal
peptides and encoding extracellular proteins.
Taxonomic identity of the homologs of S. parasitica
cDNAs
Considering the classification of oomycetes as stramenopiles, it was interesting to systematically examine the taxonomic identity of the homologs of S. parasitica cDNAs.
To this end, we took advantage of the availability of several eukaryotic genomes to compile a data set of 270334
proteins covering six major phyla of eukaryotes: fungi,
animals, plants, alveolates, discicristates, and heterokonts. The data included the complete proteomes of at
least one species for all phyla except for discicristates (see

methods). We used BLASTX to compare the 1279 S. parasitica unigenes to these eukaryotic proteins. In total, 715
sequences showed no significant hits (E value > e-5). Of
the 582 sequences that showed significant hits, 32%
(185) had the top hit to a diatom protein confirming the
affinity between diatoms and oomycetes as stramenopiles. In contrast, only 56 (about 10%) sequences had a
fungal protein as a top hit.
Phylogenetic analyses
We also exploited the sequence data to examine phylogenetic affinities between S. parasitica, three Phytophthora
spp., and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We performed reciprocal BLAST searches to identify a common
set of conserved protein sequences between the five species. Multiple alignments of the conserved portions of 18
different proteins covering 2533 amino acids were con-

catenated and used in phylogenetic analyses. The
obtained tree clearly supported a monophyletic relationship between the four oomycetes, and consistent with
published phylogenies of Phytophthora [31,32] suggested
that P. sojae and P. ramorum are more closely related (Fig.
1). Average amino acid identity among sequences of the
Phytophthora spp. was 93% (range, 91.1–95.0%). In contrast, average amino acid identity between S. parasitica and
the three Phytophthora spp. was 77% (range, 76.4–77.9%).
Average amino acid identity between the diatom and the
four oomycetes was 66.7% (range, 66.2–67.5%).
Most represented protein domains
As described above, searches of the InterPro database with
HmmPfam revealed 340 hits among the 1297 consensus
sequences. We classified the InterPro domains based on
their abundance (Table 1). The 340 hits corresponded to
198 different InterPro domains. Of these, 29 domains
were represented three times or more (range, 3–22). By far
the most abundant domain was IPR000719 for eukaryotic
protein kinase, which was represented 22 times. Other
domains that function in signal transduction, such as

ankyrin-repeat, G-protein, Ras GTPase, myb DNA binding, were also relatively abundant. Other well-represented
domains comprised fungal type I cellulose-binding
domain (IPR000254), PAN domain (IPR003014), and
papain cysteine protease family (IPR000668).
Fungal type I cellulose binding domain
Four sequences showed similarities to fungal-type I cellulose binding domain (CBD) (InterPro domain
IPB000254). Three of these occurred in cDNAs predicted
to encode extracellular proteins. Two cDNAs,
Sp_002_00594 and Sp_001_01439, encoded putative
proteins with two CBDs. The full length sequence of
cDNA SPM5F8 (Sp_001_01439) was obtained (GenBank
accession number DQ143887). This cDNA contained an
ORF of 306 bp corresponding to a protein of 101 amino
acids. SignalP [33] analysis of the predicted protein identified a 20-amino acid signal peptide with a significant
mean S value of 0.93. Domain IPB000254 has been
mainly reported in fungi [34], but also occurs in one protein from Ectocarpus siliculosus Virus EsV-1 (Phycodnaviridae), a viral pathogen of brown algae [35]. To determine

the extent to which the CBD occurs in oomycetes, we performed iterative BLAST searches of all publicly available
Phytophthora sequences using the S. parasitica CBD
sequences. In total, 12 different sequences similar to the S.
parasitica CBDs were recovered from P. infestans (3), P.
sojae (4), and P. ramorum (5). The 18 oomycete CBD
sequences aligned perfectly over a 34 amino acid region.
Multiple alignments of the oomycete CBDs with the wellstudied CBD of cellobiohydrolase I (Cel6A) of Trichoderma resei [36,37] suggested that the major features of the
domain are conserved in oomycetes (Fig. 2). Amino acid
residues defining the Cel6A domain including the four
cysteine backbone, as well as a glutamine (Gln32) and the
three tyrosines (Tyr3, Tyr29 and Tyr30) that are important
for binding to cellulose, were frequently conserved. Nonetheless, tyrosines, particularly Tyr3 and Tyr29, were often
replaced by other aromatic residues, such as tryptophane
and phenylalanine, as observed for various fungal CBDs,
such as endoglucanase I of T. resei [38].
CBEL-like sequences
Seven distinct cDNA sequences showed similarity to the
Cellulose Binding, Elicitor and Lectin-like protein (CBEL),
a 34-kDa extracellular glycoprotein that was first isolated
from Phytophthora parasitica [39,40]. Five of these CBELlike cDNAs were also predicted to encode extracellular
proteins based on PexFinder analyses. CBEL has a dual
function: (1) it is required for attachment to plant surfaces, (2) it elicits necrosis and defense gene expression in
tobacco plants [39,40]. CBEL contains two regions with
similarity to the PAN module (InterPro: IPR000177), a
conserved domain that includes the Apple domain and
functions in protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate
interactions [41]. The similarity to CBEL in the identified
S. parasitica cDNAs centered on the PAN module regions.
Three of the seven S. parasitica cDNAs contained two PANlike domains while the other four had a single domain.
We used these sequences to survey the available Phytophthora sequences for additional PAN/CBEL-like domains
using iterative BLAST searches. In total, 42 PAN/CBEL-like
domains were identified in 28 putative proteins of P.
infestans, P. sojae, P. ramorum, and P. parasitica suggesting
that this domain is widely distributed in oomycetes (Fig.
3). Multiple alignment of the 52 oomycete CBEL-like
domains revealed a conserved pattern centered around a
conserved core of six cysteines (Fig. 3B).
Glycosyl hydrolases
Six cDNAs showed similarity to various classes of glucanases. One of these, Sp_001_01488, showed significant
similarity to microbial endo-1,3-β-glucanases (glycosyl
hydrolase family 17), as well as high similarity to the
recently described gene, piendo1, from P. infestans [42].
The 1258 bp insert of a full-length cDNA (SPM16A2) corresponding to this endo-1,3-β-glucanase was fully

identified a 19-amino acid signal peptide with a significant mean S value of 0.94. Previously, phylogenetic analyses of several Phytophthora hydrolytic enzymes, including
PIENDO1, revealed unexpected affinity to fungal proteins
[27,42-44]. Indeed, BLASTP searches of the protein
encoded by SPM16A2 showed significant similarities to
fungal and bacterial proteins (top hits with E value = 2e-

21 and 3e-22, respectively) but none to other eukaryotic
proteins.
Proteases
We found a set of 12 cDNAs with similarity to aspartyl (2),
serine (3), and cysteine (7) proteases among the annotated sequences of S. parasitica. The sequence of SPM3B2,
a full length cDNA corresponding to unigene
Sp_004_00851 was obtained (GenBank accession
number AY974331). This cDNA encoded a putative protein of 379 amino acids. BLASTP searches of the MEROPS
database [45] revealed significant similarity to pepsin
aspartic proteases such as cathepsin D (MEROPS Family
A01, E value = 1e-72 for best hit). SignalP [33] analysis of
the predicted protein identified a 17-amino acid signal
peptide with a significant mean S value of 0.73. We also
determined the full length sequence of cDNA SPM9F1
(Sp_001_01152)
(GenBank
accession
number
AY974330). This cDNA encoded a putative protein of 524
amino acids with significant similarity to papain cysteine
proteases (MEROPS Family C01A, E value = 1e-58 for best
hit). SignalP [33] analysis of the predicted protein identified a 22-amino acid signal peptide with a significant
mean S value of 0.75. BLASTP searches against GenBank
NR and the Phytophthora data sets revealed that both proteases are widely distributed among eukaryotes and
oomycetes.
Protease inhibitors
We have also identified two S. parasitica cDNAs with similarity to protease inhibitor domains of two structural
classes: (1) Kazal-like serine protease inhibitor (InterPro
domain IPR002350, MEROPS family I1), (2) cysteine protease inhibitor (InterPro IPR000010, MEROPS family
I25). We further analyzed these two cDNAs by aligning
their putative inhibitor domains to those of known
protease inhibitors (Fig. 4). Sp_001_01027 showed significant similarity to the Kazal-like inhibitors recently
described by Tian et al. [21] from P. infestans and other
plant pathogenic oomycetes. Amino acid residues defining the Kazal motif, including the six cysteine backbone,
tyrosine and asparagine residues, were conserved in
Sp_001_01027 (Fig. 4A). The predicted active site P1,
which is central to the specificity of Kazal inhibitors
[46,47], consisted of a proline, and therefore differed
from all previously reported oomycete Kazal domains
[21]. Sp_001_01374 is predicted to encode a secreted protein that bears the hallmark of the cystatin class of cysteine
protease inhibitors including the highly conserved
QXVXG motif in the first binding loop (L1) [48] (Fig. 4B).
These findings suggest that secretion of protease inhibitors is a common feature of oomycetes.

Thiamine biosynthetic enzyme
We identified one sequence (Sp_001_00801) with significant similarity to a thiamine biosynthetic enzyme from
plants (top hit to protein AAV92556 from the conifer
Pseudotsuga menziesii, E value = 2e-63) and fungi
(Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein CAA21093, E value =
3e-53). Unlike S. parasitica and other oomycetes, members of the genus Phytophthora are thiamine auxotrophs,
they require exogenous sources of thiamine for growth

[49,50]. Interestingly, BLAST searches of the genome
sequence reads of P. sojae and P. ramorum, as well as all
available sequences of P. infestans, failed to reveal
sequences with similarity to Sp_001_00801 or to the
plant and fungal enzymes. These findings suggest that this
thiamine biosynthetic enzyme may have been lost in the
Phytophthora lineage and could be related to thiamine auxotrophy in this genus.

Discussion
In this study we generated 1510 high quality ESTs from S.
parasitica, an economically important and reemerging
oomycete pathogen that causes multimillion dollar losses
in the aquaculture industry. The ESTs were generated from
a cDNA library constructed from one-month old nutrient
deprived mycelium cultures. So far significant data sets of
oomycete ESTs have been described for three plant pathogenic species, P. infestans [26,27], P. sojae [30] and P. parasitica [51]. Therefore, the S. parasitica ESTs offer some
insights into the transcriptome of animal pathogenic
oomycetes, which have been extremely understudied.
Prior to this work, only 13 nucleotide and 2 protein
sequences of S. parasitica could be retrieved from GenBank (March 2005 release). The sequence data and the
corresponding annotations described in this study are
accessible through an interactive public resource, the
Oomycete Genomics Database (OGD). We hope that this
pilot genomics project will accelerate research on this
important pathogen and lays the foundation for more significant genome and cDNA sequencing initiatives of animal pathogenic oomycetes.
We used the S. parasitica ESTs to confirm the phylogenetic
affinities between oomycetes and diatoms [16-18]. About
32% of the S. parasitica sequences that showed significant
similarities to eukaryotic proteins matched a protein of
the diatom T. pseudonana as a top hit. Within the oomycetes, S. parasitica is classified with other water molds, such
as Achlya and Aphanomyces, in the order Saprolegniales
[52-54]. These species are morphologically very distinct
from the great majority of plant pathogens, such as the
Peronosporales Phytophthora and downy mildews, or the
Pythiales Pythium [55]. Indeed, the S. parasitica sequences
tended to be relatively divergent from Phytophthora
sequences. For example, based on the sequence alignments of 18 different conserved proteins, the average
amino acid identity between S. parasitica and three Phytophthora spp., P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum, was
77% compared to 93% within Phytophthora. Differences in
transcript content were also noted. cDNAs with similarity
to elicitins, a group of 10-kDa proteins that occur in all
Phytophthora and some Pythium species [56-61] and form
1–2% of mycelial ESTs in Phytophthora [26,27,62], were
not found in the S. parasitica dataset. Although, elicitinlike genes could very well occur in the genome of S. para-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/46

sitica, they do not seem to be abundantly expressed in
mycelium. Elicitins were shown to function as sterol carriers [63,64]. Among the oomycetes, members of the Saprolegniales are able to synthesize sterols de novo whereas
Phytophthora and Pythium spp. are sterol auxotrophs [50].
Possibly, S. parasitica may not require sterol carriers, such
as elicitins, for optimal hyphal growth. Another difference
between Phytophthora and Saprolegnia involves thiamine
metabolism. Members of the genus Phytophthora are thiamine auxotrophs and require exogenous sources of thiamine for growth [49,50]. We identified one sequence in S.
parasitica (Sp_001_00801) that shows significant similarity to a thiamine biosynthetic enzyme from plants and
fungi but that is absent in the draft genome sequences of
P. sojae and P. ramorum. This finding suggests that this thiamine biosynthetic enzyme may have been lost in the Phytophthora lineage and could be related to thiamine
auxotrophy in this genus.
We searched the annotated data set for S. parasitica
sequences that show similarities to known proteins and
protein motifs that could inform us about the biology and
pathology of this microbe. About half of the unigenes
showed similarities to known protein sequences and
could be assigned a putative function. A number of
sequences showed particularly interesting similarities.
cDNAs with similarity to signal transduction proteins,
such as kinases and transcription factors, were particularly
abundant. In total, 70 cDNAs encoded proteins with a
putative signal peptide that are potentially secreted to the
extracellular space. Secretion is an essential mechanism
for delivery of virulence factors by eukaryotic pathogens
to their appropriate site in infected host tissue. Therefore,
several putative secreted proteins of S. parasitica, such as
CBD proteins, CBEL-like proteins, glycosyl hydrolases,
proteases, and protease inhibitors could function in virulence and will be worthy of additional studies.
Phylogenetic analyses indicated that several Phytophthora
proteins, particularly hydrolytic enzymes such endopolygalacturonases, pectate lyases, exo-1,3-beta-glucanases,
and an endo-1,3-beta-glucanase, are more similar to fungal proteins than to their counterparts in other eukaryotes
[27,42-44]. These observations are in sharp contrast with
phylogenies constructed from ribosomal sequences or
compiled protein sequences from mitochondrial and
housekeeping chromosomal genes, which indicate considerable evolutionary distance between oomycetes and
fungi [16-18,65,66]. The apparent discrepancies between
these phylogenies could reflect convergent evolution in
the arsenal of hydrolytic enzymes between these pathogens, perhaps as a result of common mechanisms of infection among filamentous microbes [27,67]. The S.
parasitica sequences allowed us to evaluate whether the
similarity to fungal proteins extends to oomycetes other

than Phytophthora and to animal pathogenic oomycetes.
Although no S. parasitica sequences similar to the cell wall
degrading enzymes endopolygalacturonases and pectate
lyases were found, we identified a cDNA, SPM9F1, that
encodes a 524 amino acid protein with high similarity to
endo-1,3-β-glucanases, including the recently described
PIENDO1 of P. infestans [42]. Similar to PIENDO1,
SPM9F1 was most similar to fungal glucanases and no significant BLASTP hits (E value > 0.01) were observed to
non-fungal eukaryotic proteins. Therefore, conservation
in the arsenal of hydrolytic enzymes appears to extend
beyond Phytophthora spp. to the Saprolegniales and animal pathogenic oomycetes.
Domain annotation of the S. parasitica sequences revealed
the occurrence of a protein domain typically associated
with fungi. Type I CBDs (InterPro domain IPB000254)
are thought to be unique to fungi [34], although a related
domain also occurs in the brown algae viral pathogen
Ectocarpus siliculosus Virus EsV-1 (Phycodnaviridae) [35,68].
In this study, we found that this domain is widespread
and diverse in S. parasitica and other oomycetes. A total of
18 domains from four oomycete species were found to
share a 34 amino acid region that aligns perfectly with the
canonical T. resei Cel6A CBD highlighting a core of conserved four cysteines and aromatic residues known to
bind the cellulosic substrate [36,38]. Interestingly, the
occurrence of this CBD in a virus of brown algae, which
are related to oomycetes, suggests that type I CBDs might
be more widespread in stramenopiles although we did
not detect them in the draft genome sequence of the diatom T. pseudonana. In fungi, the CBDs are usually located
in the N- or C-terminal regions of hydrolytic enzymes,
such as cellulases and xylanases, and function by concentrating the catalytic domains on the surface of the insoluble cellulose substrate [34]. One of the S. parasitica
cDNAs, SPM5F8, encodes a small 101 amino acid protein
with two CBDs. Such a protein could function as a scaffolding component of the multienzyme complex known
as cellulosome [34]. The function of this and other CBD
proteins in S. parasitica may relate to attachment to
organic debris on the host surface or during saprophytic
growth. Alternatively, since cellulose is a major component of the cell wall of oomycetes, these proteins may play
endogenous function in cell wall biogenesis.
Seven S. parasitica cDNAs showed similarity to CBEL, a 34kDa cell wall glycoprotein of P. parasitica that binds to cellulose and host surfaces, functions in the agglutination of
red blood cells, and elicits necrosis and defense gene
expression in tobacco [39,40]. The similarity centered
mainly on two regions of CBEL that match the PAN module/Apple domain (InterPro IPR000177). The CBEL-like
PAN module, which is thought to function in protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions [41], appeared

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/46

to be particularly diverse in oomycetes with 52 different
sequences identified in five species. The PAN module was
found in proteins with diverse functions, such as the
blood coagulation factor XI and the plasma protein prekallikrein [41]. Recently, several secreted proteins from
apicomplexan mammalian parasites were found to contain Apple-like domains and are thought to play a role
during parasite attachment and invasion of host cells [6972]. For example, MIC4, an adhesin secreted by the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondi, contains six Apple domains
[69]. It remains to be determined the extent to which the
secreted PAN/CBEL-like proteins of S. parasitica play a role
in attachment and invasion during interaction with the
fish host. Nonetheless, it appears that in oomycetes, similar to the apicomplexan parasites, some adhesins are
secreted PAN module proteins.
Proteolytic enzymes are considered important virulence
factors that aid in host colonization and release of nutrients by animal pathogenic microbes. It has long been
known that the Saprolegnia spp. pathogenic on fish exhibit
significant extracellular protease activity and it was postulated that this enzymatic activity contributes to pathogenesis [73]. A serine protease gene, AaSP2 from the related
crayfish pathogen Aphanomyces astacus, was recently characterized and shown to be highly expressed during in vivo
growth [74]. However, besides AaSP2, genes for secreted
proteases of animal pathogenic oomycetes have not been
reported. In this study, we identified a diverse set of 12
cDNAs of S. parasitica with similarity to the major catalytic
classes of proteases. A number of the identified proteases
had a signal peptide that would predict them to be localised at the interface between pathogen and host and suggests that they are candidate virulence factors.
Tian et al. [21] recently reported that plant pathogenic
oomycetes secrete a diverse family of Kazal-like serine
protease inhibitors with at least 35 members identified
from P. infestans, P. sojae, P. ramorum, P. brassicae, and the
downy mildew Plasmopara halstedii. Among these, the
two-domain EPI1 protein and the three domain EPI10 of
P. infestans were found to inhibit and interact with P69B,
a defense subtilase of tomato, and were suggested to play
a role in counterdefense [21]. Inhibitors of serine protease
might be ubiquitous among eukaryotic parasites. For
instance, the apicomplexan obligate parasite Toxoplasma
gondii secretes TgPI-1 and TgPI-2, four-domain serine protease inhibitors of the Kazal family [75-77], and the intestinal hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum secretes an 8-kDa
broad spectrum serine protease inhibitor of the Kunitz
family [78]. Here we found that Kazal-like motifs also
occur in Saprolegniales proteins.
In addition to Kazal-like motifs, we also discovered a
cDNA that encodes a secreted protein with similarity to

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:46

the cystatin class of cysteine protease inhibitors [79].
Cysteine protease inhibitors, such as chagasin, have been
reported in animal parasites, mainly trypanosomids, and
are thought to target proteases of the insect vector or the
mammalian host [80-82]. Perhaps, inhibition of host proteases is a widespread counterdefense strategy in animal
and plant pathogenic eukaryotes. Future studies will help
to address whether the discovered protease inhibitors play
a role in S. parasitica-fish interactions.

Conclusion
This pilot cDNA sequencing project provides a first look
into the gene content of S. parasitica and sets the basis for
genomics research in this reemerging animal pathogen.
Annotation of the ESTs revealed a number of genes that
could function in virulence. Future work will focus on
developing molecular tools for functional analysis of S.
parasitica genes. In this regards, stable transformation of
Saprolegnia monoica has been reported [83], and the RNAi
protocol recently developed for P. infestans [84] should be
adaptable to S. parasitica. Gene expression profiling will
also be applied to investigate transcriptome changes during S. parasitica-fish interactions. Overall, these resources
will greatly accelerate research on this important pathogen and could lead to novel perspectives for controlling
saprolegniosis.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
Saprolegnia parasitica ATCC90214, an isolate from lesions
on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) [25], was used in
this study. Working stocks of this strain were routinely
maintained on cornmeal agar (Difco Lab. Detroit, MI) at
18°C. To obtain axenically prepared mycelium,
ATCC90214 was grown in GY broth (5 g glucose, 2.5 g
yeast extract/L) for 29 days, which corresponds to stationary phase. Mycelium was harvested by filtration and
immediately frozen prior to RNA extraction.
cDNA construction
Total RNA from S. parasitica mycelium was isolated using
the phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate based reagent Trizol, (Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. PolyA+ mRNA was isolated
using the oligotex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cDNA library was synthesized and cloned in
plasmid pSPORT1 using the Superscript™ plasmid system
for cDNA synthesis and cloning (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Polyadenylated mRNA was used to
synthesize oligo (dT) primed cDNAs, which were cloned
unidirectionally in NotI/SalI digested vector pSPORT1.
Plasmid ligations were transformed into Escherichia coli
ElectroMax-DH10B ™ cells (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carsbad, CA). Selection was done on Luria-Bertani (LB)
agar plates containing ampicillin (50 mg/L) [85]. Individ-

ual colonies were picked randomly with the Qpix robot
(Genetix, Hampshire, UK) into 384 well plates containing
LB freezing buffer (36 mM K2HPO4, 13.2 mM K2HPO4,
1.7 mM citrate, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 6.8 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4.4
% v/v glycerol in 1 × LB), incubated overnight without
shaking, and stored at -80°C. Subsequently clones were
transferred from the 384 well plate to 96 well plate for
shipment to the Genomics Technology Support Facility
(GTSF) at the Michigan State University where they were
sequenced following manufacturer's recommendations
using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer. Identification
codes for the cDNAs/ESTs were derived from the position
of the corresponding cDNA clone in the microtiter plates
preceded by SPM (for Saprolegnia parasitica mycelial) and
the successive number of the microtiter plate.
DNA sequencing
For the ESTs, DNA from bacterial cultures was purified at
GTSF using Qiagen 3000 or Autogen 850 robots. Fluorescently labeled sequencing products were generated using
the universal T7 primer resulting in 5' cDNA sequences.
The sequencing products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (PE
Applied Biosystems). A dataset representing 2296 EST
sequences and the corresponding electropherograms were
then made available through the Geospiza Finch web
interface of GTSF. The complete inserts of selected cDNAs
were sequenced by primer walking at the OARDC Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC), Wooster, Ohio,
using an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (PE Applied
Biosystems).
Bioinformatics
The sequences were processed using the XGI pipeline [28].
The assembly described in this paper is known as the May
2004 assembly. The consensus sequences (unigenes) were
named Sp_N1_N2_May04 with N1 referring to the
number of ESTs in the contig, and N2 the contig number.
The consensus sequences were annotated using the methods implemented in the XGI pipeline [29]. These include
BLASTX [86] searches against NCBI non-redundant (nr)
protein library; BLIMPS search against Blocks+ protein
motif database [87,88]; searches with the 12 algorithms of
InterProScan [89] against the InterPro database [90]; and
identification of signal peptides for extracellular secretion
with PexFinder [91], an algorithm based on SignalP 2.0
[33,92]. Automated post-analysis annotation links BLAST
and Blocks+ hits to their cognate Gene Ontology entries
[93,94], whereas InterPro hits are automatically linked to
GO annotations.

Additional similarity searches using BLAST [86] and other
bioinformatics analyses were also performed locally on
Mac OSX G4/G5 workstations. BLAST E-value lower than
0.01 were retained, and searches were conducted with the

low-complexity filter on. Local databases were compiled
from GenBank nonredundant (NR), dBEST, and TraceDB
databases [95] and the Broad Institute [96]. They included
"darwin_270334.faa" a curated dataset of 270334 eukaryotic proteins that we compiled. The data covers six major
phyla: fungi, animals, plants, alveolates, discicristates,
and heterokonts. It includes the complete proteomes of
17 species and at least the complete proteome of one species for all phyla except for discicristates. The MEROPS
database of proteases and protease inhibitors was also
queried [45]. Multiple alignments were conducted using
the program Clustal-X [97], adjusted manually as necessary, and visualized with BOXSHADE [98]. Consensus
sequences were visualized with weblogo [99]. A cDNA
was deemed likely to be full length when it was the most
5' proximal EST among assemblies and gave hits to the Nterminal portion of known proteins following similarity
searches.

Phylogenetic analysis
A data set of concatenated protein sequences was developed to perform phylogenetic comparisons of four
oomycete species and the diatom Thalassosira pseudonana
[100]. First, BLASTX searches of the S. parasitica unigenes
against the diatom proteome were performed. Matching
sequences with E value < 1e-20 were extracted and then
used to search WGS and EST reads of P. infestans, P. sojae,
and P. ramorum. A total of 18 sequences that were conserved among all five species were identified and were
aligned individually with Clustal-X. Poorly aligned edges
were then trimmed and the alignments were concatenated. PAUP v4.0b8 (Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland,
MA) was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using the
neighbor joining method and maximum parsimony with
1000 bootstrap replications.
