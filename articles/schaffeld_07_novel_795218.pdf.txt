Abstract
1. Background: Vertebrate epithelial cells typically express a specific set of keratins. In teleosts,
keratins are also present in a variety of mesenchymal cells, which usually express vimentin.
Significantly, our previous studies revealed that virtually all known teleost keratins evolved
independently from those present in terrestrial vertebrates. To further elucidate the evolutionary
scenario that led to the large variety of keratins and their complex expression patterns in present
day teleosts, we have investigated their presence in bichir, sturgeon and gar.
2. Results: We have discovered a novel group of type I keratins with members in all three of these
ancient ray-finned fish, but apparently no counterparts are present in any other vertebrate class so
far investigated, including the modern teleost fish. From sturgeon and gar we sequenced one and
from bichir two members of this novel keratin group. By complementary keratin blot-binding assays
and peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, in sturgeon we were able
to assign the sequence to a prominent protein spot, present exclusively in a two-dimensionally
separated cytoskeletal preparation of skin, thus identifying it as an epidermally expressed type I
keratin. In contrast to the other keratins we have so far sequenced from bichir, sturgeon and gar,
these new sequences occupy a rather basal position within the phylogenetic tree of type I keratins,
in a close vicinity to the keratins we previously cloned from river lamprey.
3. Conclusion: Thus, this new K14 group seem to belong to a very ancient keratin branch, whose
functional role has still to be further elucidated. Furthermore, the exclusive presence of this keratin
group in bichir, sturgeon and gar points to the close phylogenetic relationship of these ray- finned
fish, an issue still under debate among taxonomists.

Background
In vertebrates the cytoskeleton of epithelial cell types is
typically reinforced by a specific set of type I and type II
keratins that assemble into 10 nm thick filaments formed

from typeI/II heterodimers. The keratins are members of
the large multigene family of intermediate filament proteins (IFproteins) of which they form by far the most complex group. In human, 53 of the hitherto nearly 70

identified IF protein genes code for keratins [1-4] that are
expressed in tissue and developmental specific patterns.
Without including human hair and nail forming keratins,
the number of keratin genes found in teleost fish is comparably high, but in contrast to human and other tetrapods, teleost fish possess a large excess of type I keratin
genes [5-7]. By analysing the molecular evolution of keratins, as well as the evolution of their expression patterns in
lower vertebrates, we want to further elucidate the scenario and probable evolutionary forces that led to this
extraordinary variety of keratins in vertebrates.
Our investigations of the keratin systems in lamprey,
shark, trout, zebrafish, carp, goldfish and lungfish have so
far revealed that type I and type II keratins are apparently
present in all classes of vertebrates and that the various
keratins can generally be subdivided into the "E" keratins,
expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and other stratified
epithelia, and those appearing in cells forming simple epithelia, thus named "S" keratins [8-19]. Nevertheless, our
data based on cDNA sequence analysis, followed by thorough phylogenetic analyses [13-18] as well as the studies
based on the recently available genome data from man
and teleost fish [1,2,5-7], strongly support the view of
largely independent origins of the keratin genes found in
fish and man. According to our present data, solely the
typical "S" keratin pair K8 and K18 can at least be found
in all gnathostomian vertebrate groups, indicating the
unique and general importance of these "ancient" keratins. In contrast to other vertebrates investigated so far, in
modern teleost fish keratins, including K8 and K18, in
addition to their typical IF epithelial appearance show a
widespread IF occurrence in mesenchymally derived cells
and tissues, such as fibroblasts, chondrocytes and blood
vessel endothelia (for review see [11]). The latter in the
non-teleost vertebrates usually do not express keratins but
the type III IF protein vimentin [20-26]. To further trace
the origin of the different "E" and "S" keratins as well as
the evolution of the mesenchymal keratin expression in
teleosts, we have investigated the keratin systems in a
bichir, a sturgeon and a gar that are believed to represent
the most ancient groups of the extant ray-finned fish. In
the course of these studies, from all three species we
obtained sequences that apparently belong to a novel
branch of type I keratins, without counterparts in any
other vertebrate group investigated so far, including the
teleost fish. Here we present and discuss their sequences
as well as their phylogenetically relationships to the other
members of the type I keratin subfamily, which may also
provide clues to the early evolution of ray-finned fish. The
latter is still strongly debated among taxonomists,
whether on the basis of molecular or morphological data
(for an overview see [27]).

Results and discussion
Novel type I keratin sequences from bichir, sturgeon and
gar
Only recently we have discovered that a rather ancient and
distant group of keratin-related sequences, the extracellularly secreted thread keratins TKα and TKγ, are not only
present in hagfish (the assumedly most ancient vertebrate
group), but also in lamprey, teleosts and amphibians.
This provided major clues relating to keratin evolution in
vertebrates, but also pointed to a more general role of this
previously considered highly specific IF protein group in
vertebrates [28]. By combination of RT-PCR experiments
and cDNA library screening (for details see Methods),
from sturgeon and gar we have now isolated one and from
bichir two cDNA sequences that, according to our phylogenetic analysis, code for members of another novel keratin group (Fig. 1, Table 1). The 1858 bp long cDNA clone
we isolated from the sturgeon cDNA library (abak14;
[EMBL: AJ493259]) contains the complete coding
sequence for a type I keratin of 46759Da (431 amino
acids) and a calculated pI of 5.1, which we now term
AbaK14 (from Acipenser baeri keratin). However, the corresponding sequences we have so far obtained from bichir
and gar are still incomplete. A 1369 bp long clone
(pseK14a; [EMBL: AM419452]) isolated from the bichir
cDNA library encodes a type I keratin that we term
PseK14a (Polypterus senegalus keratin). It still lacks a portion of its head encoding sequence in addition to its 5'
UTR. By RT-PCR using degenerate primers, from bichir we
additionally recovered a 908 bp long cDNA sequence
(pseK14b; [EMBL: AM419453]), comprising almost the
complete rod encoding segment of a second K14 counterpart in this species (PseK14b). In addition, we found five
further incomplete cDNA clones that apparently encode
different variants of PseK14a (not shown here). The latter
only slightly vary in DNA sequence, from 0.1 – 3.1%
(amino acid variance of 0.4 – 4.9%). In a similar way we
were also able to amplify a cDNA fragment encoding the
rod domain of a K14 counterpart in gar, which we term
LocK14 (from Lepisosteus oculatus keratin). By RACE-PCR
we additionally recovered its tail encoding sequence and
3' UTR. Its assembled sequence (lock14; [EMBL:
AM419454]) overall comprises 1207 bp, but still lacks the
complete head encoding segment in addition to the section coding for the first seven residues of the rod domain.

Subsequent mining of the available genome and EST databases for K14 counterparts in other vertebrates such as teleosts, amphibians, birds and mammals, so far has not yet
yielded any matches, suggesting that this keratin group
may only be present in the ancient groups of ray- finned
fish. We only found two matches encoding K14 of
another sturgeon, notably Acipenser transmontanus (white
sturgeon; [EMBL: DR975435, DR975694]), which both
stem from a skin-derived cDNA library.

head and tail sequence.

Biochemical identification of K14 in sturgeon
To analyse the general set of keratins expressed in sturgeon, we extracted the cytoskeletal proteins from different
tissues, including skin, liver, intestine, stomach and gill,
separated them by 2D-PAGE and subsequently analysed
the patterns by CKBB assays and immunoblotting (results
for skin, stomach and intestine are shown in Fig. 2). The
major spots were additionally analysed by peptide mass
fingerprinting (PMF) to reveal similarities between identified keratin spots and to assign them to the sequences we
obtained from the sturgeon by cDNA library screening. In
the course of these investigations we were clearly able to

assign a single protein spot to the amino acid sequence
derived from the cloned abak14 cDNA sequence. The
matching spot was solely found as a major component in
the cytoskeletal preparation of skin (Fig. 2a), in which it
was firmly identified as a type I keratin in the CKBB assay
(Fig. 2a"). It showed a positive reaction with the antitrout-keratin antiserum GPpoly (data not shown), which
we previously introduced as a general keratin marker in
fish [8,10-15,19]. The two-dimensional position of this
protein spot fits the theoretical values calculated from the
sequence of AbaK14 (see above and Table 1). Peptide
mass fingerprint (PMF) analysis of this protein yielded 29
matching peptide masses for AbaK14, of which 26 were
specific for AbaK14 in comparison to the other six type I
keratins we so far sequenced from sturgeon. Overall
amino acid sequence coverage for AbaK14 was 61%.
Molecular evolution of keratins – the ancient origin of K14
To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the novel K14
group to the other currently known type I keratins, by different methods we thoroughly analysed a comprehensive
data set of 118 polypeptides, including the type I keratins
from lancelet, lamprey, shark, bichir, sturgeon, gar,
zebrafish, trout, Xenopus, lungfish and man (for further
details see Methods; the available accession numbers of
the employed sequences are listed in Fig. 3). Most of the
fish sequences stem from our own data, notably those
from lamprey, shark, bichir, sturgeon, gar, trout and lungfish in addition to K8 and K18 from zebrafish [1318,23,29,30]. We rooted the trees with the type I keratin
sequences available from the lancelets, which are believed
to represent the most ancient group of living chordates
[31]. In general we received the same basal tree topology
when applying Neighbor Joining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML) or Bayesian (B) methods for our phylogenetic
analysis. The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 4 is based on
Bayesian inference and clearly shows that the K14
sequences form a separate and basal branch within the
type I keratins, phylogenetically close to the sequences we
obtained from the river lamprey. They even branch off
prior to the twig formed by the gnathostomian K18
sequences, that apparently emerged before the separation
of cartilaginous and bony fish [13-15]. This ancestral ori-

gin of the K14 twig together with the assumedly exclusive
presence of K14 in ancient ray-finned fish (see above)
raises the question as to the complementary binding partner(s) of this keratin group. So far, analysis of bichir and
sturgeon has not revealed a group of type II keratins occupying a similar basal position equivalent to the K14
sequences in the type I keratin tree [8,29,30]. Moreover,
the suggested restriction of K14 sequences to bichir, sturgeon and gar indicates the close phylogenetic relationship
of these fish groups, an issue still under debate among taxonomists. Based on recent molecular data it can be concluded that sturgeons, gars and bowfin together may form

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/16

a sister group to the teleost fish and that bichirs represent
the most ancient group of ray-finned fish (for review see
[27]). Since our current studies do not contribute to the
resolution of this problem, the keratin system in bowfin
should be investigated, which might shed more light on
this issue.
Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree illustrated in Fig. 4
suggests that most of the type I keratins from ray-finned
fish evolved independently from those present in lungfish, frog or man and that very early in actinopterygian
evolution a gene duplication gave rise to at least two dif-

K14 sequences from bichir, sturgeon and gar to the other type I keratins known from vertebrates. The tree was rooted with
the lancelet type I keratin sequences. It clearly shows that the K14 sequences form a separate branch (boxed in violet) close to
the sequences we cloned from the river lamprey. They even branch off prior to the twig formed by the gnathostomian K18
sequences (boxed in green) that apparently emerged before the separation of cartilaginous and bony fish. The tree, furthermore, suggests that most of the ray-finned fish type I keratins (boxed in blue) evolved independently from those present in
lungfish, frog or man and that early in actinopterygian evolution gene duplications already gave rise to at least two different
type I keratin groups with members in both, ancient and modern ray-finned fish. Importantly, within the tetrapod lineage the
Bayesian analysis revealed four highly supported keratin subgroups, each with members in both, frog and man (encircled by
dotted lines and coloured orange). Bar, 0.1 substitutions per site.

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:16

ferent type I keratin branches, each with members in both
ancient and modern ray- finned fish (see the boxed rayfins twig in Fig. 4). Compared to our recent analyses [1418,28], we have now included additional type I keratin
sequences from zebrafish and Xenopus; therefore, in this
study the K18 branch shows a more complex branching
pattern, not allowing a clear identification of the authentic K18 counterparts in the different vertebrates solely on
the basis of their position in the tree. However, our previous identification of K18 in shark, bichir, sturgeon, trout
and zebrafish was additionally based on its typical occurrence in simple epithelia, such as liver hepatocytes or
intestinal mucosal epithelium, corresponding to the situation in man and other tetrapods [10,12-16,19,29]. Nevertheless, these "functional K18 counterparts" identified
in the different vertebrate groups have to be considered as
paralogous protein sequences. The branching pattern of
the K18 twig supports the suggestion that early as well as
more recent duplication events led to the various K18
related genes. Future analysis of their expression patterns
may provide further clues for possible functions of these
K18 relatives.
Compared to the evolution of type II keratins, the phylogenetic tree of type I keratins appears rather complex and
several nodes cannot be resolved. Moreover, in teleosts
the number of detected type I keratin genes virtually triples the number of those coding for type II keratins [5-7],
in contrast to the almost equal number of type I and type
II keratin genes detected in the tetrapod genomes. However, when including the hair- and nail-forming keratins
the total number of keratin genes in tetrapods is clearly
higher than in teleost fish [1-4]. A group of two sequences,
one from zebrafish, the other from Xenopus, also occupy a
rather basal position in the type I keratin tree, directly
branching off between the K14 and K18 twig. But it has to
be taken into consideration that both sequences stem
from genomic DNA sequencing and may only represent
non-active "relics" of ancient keratin genes. From the current Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (but not from our NJ
and ML analysis) another phenomenon emerged for the
first time: There are now four highly supported keratin
subgroups in the tetrapod twig, each with members in
both, frog and man (in Fig. 4 encircled by dotted lines).
Moreover, the tree topology indicates that the human hair
keratins may have emerged prior to these radiation events.

Conclusion
The type I and type II keratins represent the two most
complex and abundant groups of intermediate filament
(IF) proteins among vertebrates and their structure, function and extraordinary variety cannot be completely
understood without phylogenetic considerations. Therefore, we investigated the keratin systems in more ancient
representatives of the vertebrate lineage. In particular, the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/16

keratins present in skin may play an important role in the
transition of vertebrates from water- to land- living animals. Here we present a novel group of epidermal type I
keratins, which we termed keratin 14 and so far have only
found them in the basal groups of living ray-finned fish,
notably bichir, sturgeon and gar. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed a rather basal position of this keratin group in
the tree of type I keratin evolution. The keratin 14 group
even emerged prior to the gnathostomian K18 sequences,
which together with its binding partner K8 and with the
exception of the recently discovered thread keratins in teleosts and amphibians, was hitherto considered as most
ancient group of gnathostomian keratins. Future analyses
will hopefully shed more light on the expression and
functional role of K14 in the fish epidermis and clarify the
identity of its type II keratin binding partner.

Methods
Preparation of tissues and cytoskeletal proteins
Sturgeons (Acipenser baeri) were purchased from a local
hatching farm (Fischzucht Rhönforelle, Gersfeld, Germany), and gars (Lepisosteus oculatus) from a local pet
shop (Fauna Exotica, Mainz-Kostheim, Germany). The
bichirs (Polypterus senegalus) were a gift from Dr. Latz
(Institute of Zoology, University of Mainz). Within the
scope of this study we employed one specimen for each
species. Animals were killed by cutting the neck or the tail
artery after MS 222 narcosis (0.5 g/l). For further procedures, the tissues were excised and used immediately or
snap frozen according to [8]. Cytoskeletal proteins were
extracted as described in [8].
Electrophoresis, immunoblotting, CKBB, PMF and
immunofluorescence microscopy
Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(2D-PAGE), complementary keratin blot-binding (CKBB)
assays, Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy were essentially performed as described
in [8]. For immunoblotting we used 10% milk powder as
the blocking reagent and the antibody incubations were
performed overnight at 8°C. Peptide mass fingerprinting
(PMF) using matrix-assisted laserdesorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was
performed as described in [16,18]. The mass tolerance for
matching fragments was set to ≤ 100 ppm.
Preparation of RNA
Total RNA from bichir was extracted according to a protocol modified from [32], including a GTC extraction and
subsequent sedimentation of RNA by ultracentrifugation
through a dense cushion of caesium chloride (detailed
protocol given in [8]). For purification of sturgeon RNA
we applied a protocol that included consecutive steps of
guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) homogenizations, acidic
phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitations. The

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:16

final RNA precipitation was accomplished with 8 M LiCl.
Gar RNA was prepared using the GeneMATRIX Universal
RNA Purification Kit purchased from Roboklon (Germany) according to the suppliers' instructions. Isolation
of mRNA was generally performed with the "PolyATract®mRNA isolation system" from Promega.
RT-PCR analyses
Applying 0.5 to 1.0 µg of total RNA, RT-PCR was performed either using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase
from Invitrogen (RT for 1 h at 42°C), followed by standard PCR (Taq Polymerase, Invitrogen) or the QIAGEN®OneStep RT-PCR Kit (RT for 0.5 h at 50°C). PCR was
done for 30–35 cycles and primer specific annealing temperatures. We used different combinations of degenerate,
IF-specific primers, as previously described [8] (notably
primer numbers P4, P5, P8, P9, P10). 3' RACE-PCR was
accomplished using an oligodT-19mer as downstream
and sequence-specific oligos as upstream primers. For gel
extraction of PCR products we employed the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) or the GeneMATRIX DNA
Purification Kit AGAROSE-OUT (Roboklon). Cloning of
the isolated DNA fragments was accomplished either with
the TOPO-TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), the StrataClone™
PCR Cloning Kit (Stratagene) or the pGEM-T Easy vector
kit (Promega). All kits were used according to the instruction manual. Primers were synthesized by Roth and
Sigma-Ark, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on both strands using the Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator system. The subsequent gel run was done by
commercial services (Genterprise, Germany).

Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model of amino acid
evolution (JTT [35]). Furthermore, the model applied for
the ML and Bayesian analyses included observed amino
acid frequencies (F), estimated proportion of invariant
sites (I), and estimation of among-site rate variation for
the remaining sites according to a gamma distribution (G)
that was set to four rate categories. For the NJ analysis we
used the programs PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR of the
Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP, version 3.6 b
[36]). The reliability of the tree topology was then tested
by bootstrap analysis [37] with 100 replications, using the
PHYLIP programs seqboot, protdist, neighbor and consensus. The ML analysis was conducted with the PHYLIPlike interface PHYML [38]. For bootstrapping we generated 100 pseudo data sets. The Bayesian inference analysis
was performed with MRBAYES 3.1 [39] with the frequencies fixed to the Jones frequencies. In each of the two parallel runs four Markov chains (one hot and three cold
chains) were run simultaneously for 3,000,000 generations, starting with random trees. Sampling from the trees
was set to every 10th generation. Under these conditions
the average value for the deviation of split frequencies
reached a value < 0.01. The burn-in was set to 115000,
based on the stationary phase. All consensus trees were
drawn using TREEVIEW version 1.6.6 [40].

cDNA library construction and screening
According to the supplier's instructions we constructed λphage cDNA libraries (ZAP-Express®, Stratagene) from
sturgeon and bichir, respectively, in each case using 5 µg
of mRNA purified from a mixture of tissues, including
skin, eyes, brain and internal organs. Clones were isolated
using the fish keratin-specific antiserum GPpoly [8] and
digoxygenin-labeled cDNA probes derived from obtained
RT-PCR fragments. Digoxygenin labeling was either performed using the DIG-High Prime Kit from Roche,
according to the instruction manual or by standard PCR,
using digoxygenin labeled nucleotides from Roche.
Sequence analyses and phylogenetic inference
For database searches, we employed the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST [33]) of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and of the Ensembl
Genome Browser. The multiple sequence alignments were
performed with ClustalX version 1.8 [34] using default
gap penalties. When necessary, the alignment was edited
by hand. The final alignment was analysed by Neighbor
Joining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
methods (B). All analyses were conducted under the
