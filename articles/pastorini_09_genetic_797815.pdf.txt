Abstract
Background: Hybrid zones generally represent areas of secondary contact after speciation. The
nature of the interaction between genes of individuals in a hybrid zone is of interest in the study of
evolutionary processes. In this study, data from nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA
sequences were used to genetically characterize hybridization between wild mongoose lemurs
(Eulemur mongoz) and brown lemurs (E. fulvus) at Anjamena in west Madagascar.
Results: Two segments of mtDNA have been sequenced and 12 microsatellite loci screened in
162 brown lemurs and mongoose lemurs. Among the mongoose lemur population at Anjamena,
we identified two F1 hybrids (one also having the mtDNA haplotype of E. fulvus) and six other
individuals with putative introgressed alleles in their genotype. Principal component analysis groups
both hybrids as intermediate between E. mongoz and E. fulvus and admixture analyses revealed an
admixed genotype for both animals. Paternity testing proved one F1 hybrid to be fertile. Of the
eight brown lemurs genotyped, all have either putative introgressed microsatellite alleles and/or
the mtDNA haplotype of E. mongoz.
Conclusion: Introgression is bidirectional for the two species, with an indication that it is more
frequent in brown lemurs than in mongoose lemurs. We conclude that this hybridization occurs
because mongoose lemurs have expanded their range relatively recently. Introgressive
hybridization may play an important role in the unique lemur radiation, as has already been shown
in other rapidly evolving animals.

Background
Hybridization among animals has traditionally been
viewed as an unusual event. However, recent genetic studies have shown that it occurs more commonly than origi-

nally believed [1,2]. Hybridization may occur due to
human impact, such as between domestic or captive species, wild and domestic species [3,4] or between introduced and native species [5,6]. Natural hybridization has

been found across the animal kingdom, including insects
[7], fish [8], amphibians [9], birds [10,11], carnivores
[12], and monkeys [13-15]. Among the Malagasy lemurs,
a few cases of hybridization between subspecies have been
reported in the wild [16-19].
Harrison [20] defined hybridization as "the interbreeding
of individuals from two populations, or groups of populations, which are distinguishable on the basis of one or
more heritable characters." Hybridization occurs when
there are incomplete reproductive barriers between two
taxa. There are many possible evolutionary outcomes of
hybridization: 1) The two hybridizing taxa may merge, 2)
reproductive barriers may be reinforced between the
parental taxa, 3) transfer of genetic material into one or
both parental taxa may occur, which might facilitate adaptive evolution 4) a new species of hybrid origin may be
formed, or 5) the hybrid zone may become established
without any major impact on the parental taxa [21,22].
Therefore, studies of natural hybrids and their genetic
composition can shed new light on issues concerning
reproductive barriers, survivorship and fitness of hybrids
and give important insights into evolutionary processes
and the adaptation of species.
The Malagasy lemurs are a spectacular example of adaptive radiation and provide an ideal model for studies of
evolutionary diversification [23]. Currently, 71 lemur species and subspecies are recognized, which are distributed
across 15 genera in 5 families [24]. Madagascar's isolation, diverse climate, geology and vegetation provide conditions equating to a natural experiment in taxonomic
diversification. Hybridization has been found to play a
major role in rapid radiations such as Darwin's finches
[11], East African cichlid fishes [8], Hawaiian crickets [25]
and passion-vine butterflies [7]. However, little is known
about interspecific gene flow or its role in the radiation of
lemurs.
During a field study on mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) at Anjamena in western Madagascar an animal was
observed which exhibited a pelage coloration intermediate between that of red-fronted brown lemurs (E. fulvus
rufus) and mongoose lemurs [26]. This phenotypic variation was the first sign that interspecific hybridization
might be occurring at this site. When sequencing some E.
f. rufus individuals from the same locality for a phylogenetic study of brown lemurs [27], one individual was
found to have the mtDNA haplotype of E. mongoz [28].
This hardened the suspicion of Anjamena being a hybrid
zone between two taxonomically well accepted Eulemur
species.
Mongoose lemurs and brown lemurs are two of five species in the genus Eulemur, in the family Lemuridae. E. mon-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/32

goz occurs in the west of Madagascar. Brown lemurs are
divided into 6 subspecies, which together range over a
large area of Madagascar, excluding the South of the
island. Notably, E. fulvus and E. mongoz are the only two
species of lemurs found outside Madagascar, and are
thought to have been introduced to the Comoros by
humans. In Madagascar, East of the Betsiboka river (Figure 1), mongoose lemur distribution overlaps with that of
E. f. fulvus. To the west of the Betsiboka river E. mongoz is
sympatric with E. f. rufus. The ranges of both brown lemur
subspecies are much larger than the relatively small area
mongoose lemurs occupy. E. mongoz is identified as 'vulnerable' in the IUCN red list of threatened species, while
E. fulvus is classified as at 'lower risk' of extinction [29].
Habitat destruction and forest fragmentation are the main
threats to both taxa.
Mongoose lemurs at Anjamena live in small family groups
of 2–6 individuals, consisting of an adult pair and associated offspring. Group composition remains relatively
constant, with changes being limited to births and emigration of subadult individuals [26]. Mongoose lemurs are
cathemeral throughout the year with shifts towards more
diurnal activity in the wet season and more nocturnal
activity in the dry season [30]. E. mongoz is predominantly
frugivorous, its diet being supplemented by leaves, flowers, and nectar [31].
The most important potential competitor for mongoose
lemurs at Anjamena is E. f. rufus, as it not only shares food
resources (fruit and leaves) with E. mongoz but also exhibits a similar activity pattern [26]. Brown lemurs at Anjamena live in large groups of up to nine individuals with a
variable sex and age composition [32]. In 1995, population density of E. f. rufus (121 individuals per km2) in the
vicinity of Anjamena was much higher than that of E.
mongoz (45 individuals per km2) [32]. Both E. mongoz and
E. fulvus exhibit sexual dichromatism. The pelage coloration of brown lemur males and females is very different
from that of mongoose lemur males and females (for
illustrations see [24]). At Anjamena, the body weight of
adult brown lemurs (ca. 1700 g) is higher than that of
adult mongoose lemurs (ca. 1200 g, pers. observation).
Association between the two species has not been
observed at Anjamena [26].
We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis, including both nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) sequences of E. mongoz and E. fulvus, to gain
insights into the genetic composition of the two species,
and to assess hybridization between them in Anjamena.
Microsatellites show a high degree of length polymorphism, which makes it possible to obtain pedigree-level
characterization of populations as well as to detect introgression of alleles between species. Analysis of mtDNA

events.

Methods
Study population
A total of 163 samples from mongoose lemurs (108) and
brown lemurs (55) were collected from the wild and captivity (Table 1). The main study site Anjamena is situated
in the riverine forests of the Mahavavy in western Madagascar (45°55'E, 16°03'S, Figure 1) from where a total of
38 samples of E. mongoz were collected. Five hair samples
were collected in 1994 and 1995 during a behavioural
study [30]. From August to September 1997, samples of
33 mongoose lemurs from 12 neighbouring groups and 8
brown lemurs from 7 groups were collected at Anjamena.
In the same time period, 4 E. mongoz and 2 E. fulvus samples were collected from animals living near Anadabomandry across the Mahavavy river from Anjamena.
Additionally, 2 mongoose lemur and 3 brown lemur samples from Ampijoroa (110 km east of Anjamena, separated by the river Betsiboka, Figure 1) were analysed. From
the animals sampled in 1997, body weight was measured
and fur coloration was recorded by taking photographs.

A total of 63 blood, hair or tissue samples were collected
from mongoose lemurs in captivity. The origin of the captive mongoose lemur population is not entirely known,
but some founder animals originated from the Comoro
islands. One E. mongoz sample was of unknown origin. An
additional 42 E. fulvus samples were acquired from vari-

ous zoos, covering all brown lemur subspecies (Table 1).
In addition, samples of 3 E. coronatus, 3 E. rubriventer, 3 E.
macaco macaco, 3 E. m. flavifrons and 2 Lemur catta (all zoo
animals) were sequenced for mtDNA [for more details see
Additional file 1].
Molecular methods
DNA was extracted from hair, blood or tissue samples
using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction [33].
Approximately 10–100 ng template DNA was amplified
in 20 μl (microsatellites) or 50 μl (mtDNA) reactions
using 0.06 M Tris, 0.015 M (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.78 M DMSO, 0.025 mM for each dNTP, 1 mM for each
primer, and 0.5 U Thermophilus aquaticus (Taq) polymerase. Samples were amplified for 25–35 cycles, with denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, primer annealing at 50–65°C for
60 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final
extension for 5 min at 72°C. The number of cycles and/or
the annealing temperature was changed as necessary, to
optimize the PCR conditions for each locus.

A total of 12 microsatellite loci were used for this study.
Locus Efr09J was originally isolated from E. f. rufus [34].
We performed the PCR of that locus with 60°C annealing
and 25 cycles. To amplify locus Lc8, which was developed
for L. catta [35], 55°C annealing temperature and 35
cycles were used. The other 10 loci were amplified using
the PCR conditions described in [36]. PCR products were
run on an ABI PRISM 377XL or 3730 automated DNA
sequencer. Allele sizes were determined with GeneScan
software (Applied Biosystems). For all loci, samples of 30
offspring and their known pairs of parents as well as 15
offspring with one available parent from the captive mongoose lemur colony were genotyped, allowing testing for
Mendelian inheritance.

The 3' end of the tRNAThr gene, the complete tRNAPro gene
and the 5' end of the control region (D-loop), as well as
part of the NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene
were amplified and sequenced, using the primers listed in
Table 2. The PCR products were electrophoresed in 2%
agarose gels to estimate template concentration. The
sequencing reactions were carried out with the BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems), using 1 μl of terminator mix and 2
μl of 5× buffer for a 9 μl reaction. The completed sequencing reactions were cleaned of excess dyes with ethanol precipitation before being run on an automated DNA
sequencer. All templates were sequenced in their entirety
for both strands. The sequencing data was aligned with
Sequencher™ 4.2.2 (Gene Codes Corporation).
Statistical analyses
For microsatellite data, CERVUS 3.0.3 [37] was used to
calculate observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosities, frequency estimates for null alleles and to test for
deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Additionally, non-exclusion probabilities for first and second
parents on the 12 autosomal microsatellite loci and the
probability for two random individuals having the same
genotype were determined with CERVUS. GENEPOP
4.0.6 [38] was used to test for genotypic linkage disequilibrium in the wild mongoose lemurs at Anjamena. Bonferroni correction was applied to alpha to adjust for
multiple testing of 12 loci. The population genetic structure was inferred by calculating Fis, Fst and Rst estimates in
GENEPOP and by performing an analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin 3.11 [39]. Principal component analysis of the multilocus genotypes was carried
out with GENETIX 4.05 [40]. STRUCTURE 2.2.2 [41] was
used to infer the genetic structure of the populations
based on microsatellite loci. The number K of populations
was estimated using a burn-in period of 10,000 and
100,000 MCMC replicates, applying the admixture model
and independent or correlated allele frequencies. The estimated membership coefficients Q for each individual in
each cluster was calculated by STRUCTURE, in order to
assign the individual to one or, if admixed, to several clusters.

The aligned mtDNA sequences were analysed with PAUP
4.0b10 [42] using maximum parsimony (2500 random
addition heuristic search) and neighbor-joining (Kimura
2-parameter distances) methods. Gaps were considered as
a fifth character state in parsimony analyses, whereas in
neighbor-joining analyses they were treated as missing
data. Bootstrap analyses of 1000 replicates (10 random
addition heuristic searches each) for maximum parsimony and 2500 replicates for neighbor-joining were performed to examine the relative support of each
relationship in the resultant topologies. Two Lemur catta
sequences were used as the outgroup.

Results
Microsatellite variation
Overall, the multilocus panel employed was found to be
very informative. The probability that two individuals
cannot be differentiated is 3.08E-9 for E. mongoz and
3.64E-14 for E. fulvus. With one exception, all individuals
have unique multilocus genotypes. One adult mongoose
lemur male from Anjamena sampled in 1995 has exactly
the same genotype as a male from 1997. Because none of
the wild animals sampled were marked permanently, it is
likely that the same male was captured twice. Therefore,
one of the two samples was removed from the data set.

Variation among mongoose and brown lemurs for the 12
microsatellite loci is summarized in Table 3. There is no
evidence for linkage disequilibrium between loci in the
mongoose lemur population at Anjamena. When assessing the parent-offspring relationships in the captive mongoose lemur population with known pedigrees, all alleles
are found to segregate with Mendelian expectations.
Allelic diversity ranges from 3 to 9 alleles per locus (mean
= 5.9 ± 1.8 SE) in mongoose lemurs and from 3 to 17 (9.0
± 3.9) in brown lemurs. Mongoose lemurs at Anjamena
have observed heterozygosities of 0.16 to 0.89 (0.50 ±
0.20) per locus, which are slightly higher than expected
heterozygosities (Table 3). In the mongoose lemur population at Anjamena, no locus differs significantly from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The other samples were not
tested for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because they
are either from captivity (no random mating) or from dif-

ferent subspecies (different populations). All loci have
low inbreeding coefficients (-0.17<Fis < 0.40, Table 3).
With one exception, estimates of null allele frequencies
range from -0.11 to 0.05 for each locus, indicating
absence of null alleles. Locus Em5 has an estimated null
allele frequency of 0.24. However, since the locus is in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the alleles are inherited
in Mendelian fashion when testing the 45 offspring with
known parents, the presence of a null allele is unlikely to
be the reason for this result. We therefore retained this
locus for further data analyses.
Species differentiation and hybrids
Analysis of molecular variance applied to the two Eulemur
species showed 23.21% between-species variability
(AMOVA, P < 0.0001), indicating that 76.79% of the
genetic variation was found within each species. Genetic
differentiation between the two species is relatively high
(Fst = 0.232, Rst = 0.636) and significant at each locus
(exact G test, P = 0).

Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly separates
brown lemurs from mongoose lemurs (left and right on
Figure 2). Within E. mongoz, the wild and captive populations are grouped apart (top and bottom in Figure 2) with
little overlap. There are no obvious subgroups among
brown lemurs. Two mongoose lemurs (JP167 and JP184)
are intermediate between E. mongoz and E. fulvus (Figure
2).
We used STRUCTURE on the microsatellite data to identify distinct genetic populations, assign individuals to
populations, and identify admixed individuals. When
assuming two populations (K = 2), all 162 samples are
correctly assigned to their species (Figure 3). Most mon-

goose lemurs clearly fall into cluster 1 with the proportion
of membership Q1 ranging from 0.833 to 0.998 (0.994 ±
0.018). Only two mongoose lemurs from Anjamena
(JP167 and JP184) split between cluster 1 (Q1 = 0.632
and 0.539) and cluster 2 (Q2 = 0.368 and 0.461). All 55
brown lemurs are grouped into cluster 2, with Q2 ranging
from 0.814 to 0.998 (0.983 ± 0.035).
When K is increased from 2 up to 16, the samples are
divided into more clusters, with K = 12 showing the highest probability. The different clusters mainly represent
subspecies in E. fulvus or populations/groups in mongoose lemurs (data not shown). However, while individuals might be admixed between populations or
subspecies of the same species, there is no admixture of
the two species (apart from JP167 and JP184). These tests
confirm the clear separation of the two species and the
intermediate positioning of JP167 and JP184.
We also ran analyses using only the 42 mongoose and
brown lemurs from Anjamena. When assuming K = 2
populations, most lemurs are clearly assigned to the correct species (Q1 = 0.996 ± 0.006 in most E. mongoz and Q2
= 0.995 ± 0.004 in all E. fulvus). There are 3 mongoose
lemurs that are split between the two clusters. As in the
previous analyses, the two individuals JP167 and JP184
have the highest probabilities to be admixed (Q1/Q2 =
0.527/0.473 and 0.714//0.286). In addition, a third mongoose lemur (JP152) has a slightly increased proportion
of membership for cluster 2 (Q2 = 0.192). When increasing K, no further subdivision at Anjamena is possible.
Introgression of microsatellite alleles in mongoose lemurs
A total of 71 alleles are found at the 12 loci in the 107
mongoose lemurs studied. The 37 E. mongoz at Anjamena

have 53 different alleles, of which 10 alleles are not found
in any other mongoose lemur outside Anjamena. Assuming that hybridization is restricted to Anjamena, these 10
private alleles for Anjamena are potential candidates for
introgression into the mongoose lemur gene pool by
hybridization with brown lemurs. However, one allele is
not observed in any brown lemur, which excludes it from
being of E. fulvus origin. Details of the remaining 9 alleles
are given in Table 4.

Based on their low frequency in mongoose lemurs and
high frequency in brown lemurs they are more likely to be
of brown lemur origin. This leaves 5 alleles, which might
have been introduced into the brown lemur gene pool by
hybridization (Table 4). With one exception, each brown
lemur has 1 to 5 of these possibly introgressed alleles in
its haplotype (2.57 ± 1.51). Due to the very low sample
size for E. f. rufus (N = 13), this identification of putatively
introgressed alleles is only preliminary.

Five of the possibly introgressed alleles are very common
(>20%) in E. f. rufus at Anjamena, which supports their
origin in brown lemurs. Three alleles are found only once
or twice among the 8 Anjamena brown lemurs (6–13%),
however, since they are very rare in mongoose lemurs
(each allele only found once), they might still be of brown
lemur origin. One mongoose lemur at Anjamena has an
allele (Lc8–223), not found in any other mongoose lemur
and also not in the brown lemurs at Anjamena. Only one
E. f. fulvus has that same allele.

mtDNA results
We sequenced two fragments of the mtDNA genome for
107 mongoose lemurs and 55 brown lemurs, as well as 12
individuals from the other three Eulemur species and 2
Lemur catta. The aligned nucleotide sequences span a total
of 1463 base positions (bp). The analysed data set consists
of 31 bp of tRNAThr, 66 bp of tRNAPro, 804 bp of D-loop
and 559 bp of ND4. Details on the number of haplotypes
found with D-loop data, ND4 data and the combined
data set in animals at Anjamena or across the species
range are given in Table 5. A total of 36 variable positions
are present among mongoose lemurs, while brown
lemurs exhibit 178 variable sites (Table 5). Nucleotide
divergence between the two species ranges from 0.054 to
0.077 (0.063 ± 0.004 Tamura-Nei distance). Some of the
ND4 sequences have been published previously [27,43].
New sequences were deposited on GenBank [D-loop:
EU333172–EU333247, ND4: EU333248–EU333274, see
also Additional file 1].

The two hybrid mongoose lemurs (JP167 and JP184)
identified from PCA/STRUCTURE analyses have 4 putative introgressed alleles each. These two animals have 7
putative introgressed alleles found only once or twice in
the mongoose lemurs at Anjamena (Table 4). Another 6
mongoose lemurs at Anjamena have one or both of the
remaining 2 possibly introgressed alleles. One allele (Lc1–
98) occurs in 3 mongoose lemurs and with a frequency of
31% is well represented among the brown lemurs in Anjamena. The other allele (Lc8–221) is found 5 times in
mongoose lemurs and has an allele frequency of 21% in
E. f. rufus.
Parentage of hybrids
At the time of our field study, JP167 was still a juvenile
female without offspring. The other hybrid JP184 was an
adult female. We were able to collect samples from the
adult male and the juvenile of her social group. In parentage testing using microsatellites, neither the adult male
nor the hybrid female JP184 are excluded as parents of the
juvenile JP152. With a high probability (99.0% if accepting the adult male as the father, 91.0% if only considering
the female), this makes JP184 the mother of the juvenile.
Introgressed microsatellite alleles in brown lemurs
The 13 brown lemurs in the E. f. rufus subspecies clade,
which includes the animals from Anjamena (see Figure 4,
the other 9 E. f. rufus samples mentioned in Table 1 form
another subspecies clade), have 60 different alleles. Seven
alleles are unique to the 8 brown lemurs at Anjamena and
also present in the mongoose lemur gene pool at Anjamena. Two of these alleles are only found in mongoose
and brown lemurs at Anjamena and hence could originate
from either species (Em4–146 and Lc8–221, Table 4).

There are 5 mtDNA haplotypes (MA-ME) in the mongoose lemur population at Anjamena. In addition, one
mongoose lemur exhibits the mtDNA haplotype of a
brown lemur. The brown lemurs at Anjamena have 3 haplotypes (FA, FB, FC). One of these (FA), is the haplotype
also observed in the mongoose lemur. There are 4 E. fulvus
at Anjamena with the E. mongoz haplotype MF, which is
not found in any mongoose lemur at Anjamena. While
the haplotypes MA-ME differ from each other by 1 or 2 bp,
haplotype MF is 4–5 bp different from the other haplotypes found among mongoose lemurs in Anjamena. The 3
E. fulvus haplotypes at Anjamena differ from each other by
1 or 2 bp.
Among all 107 mongoose lemurs, 10 haplotypes (MAMK) are found. The most common (57%) haplotype, MI,
is present in 61 E. mongoz kept in various zoos. Two animals in captivity each have a unique haplotype (MJ and
MK). The 3 haplotypes found in captivity differ from each
other by only 1 or 2 bp. The two animals at Ampijoroa
have haplotype MH and the 4 mongoose lemurs from
Anadabomandry have haplotype MG.
In the phylogenetic analyses, four distinct clades of mongoose lemurs can be recognized (Figure 4). One clade con-

ing 2 haplotypes are found in a zoo animal of unknown
origin (FF) and in a red-fronted brown lemur from
Maintirano, which lies further south from Anjamena on
the western coast of Madagascar (FG).

Discussion
F1 hybrids in the mongoose lemur population
Principal component analysis positions two animals
between E. mongoz and E. fulvus (Figure 2) and admixture
analyses reveal an admixed genotype for the same two
individuals (Figure 3). These two animals are most likely
F1 hybrids. Whereas one allele per locus and, hence, 12
introgressed alleles would be expected in an F1 hybrid, we
observed only 4. The 8 brown lemurs from Anjamena
have a total of 37 different alleles in their genotypes, of
which 16 alleles are shared with the mongoose lemurs at
Anjamena. Therefore, only 21 alleles are unique to E. fulvus and are identifiable as introgressed in a hybrid. Taking
the allele frequencies into account, a hybrid would inherit
from its brown lemur parent on average 5.03 alleles which
are exclusive to brown lemurs and 6.97 alleles which are
shared between E. mongoz and E. fulvus, which is consistent with the pattern found.

tains the animals from Anjamena, including the
haplotype found in the 4 brown lemurs at Anjamena. The
3 haplotypes from the captive mongoose lemurs form a
second clade while the haplotypes from Ampijoroa and
Anadabomandry each form a separate clade. Haplotypes
between those 4 clades differ from each other at 12 to 21
bp (17.6 ± 3.2).
Among brown lemurs, a total of 34 haplotypes are found.
Phylogenetic analyses group them into 6 clades (Figure
4). Each of these subspecies clades gets 93 – 100% bootstrap support in neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony analyses (Figure 4). The clade containing the brown
lemurs from Anjamena includes 5 additional animals,
which add 4 more haplotypes to this clade: Two haplotypes FD and FE are present at Anadabomandry, which
differ from each other by 5 bp. One zoo animal of
unknown origin also exhibits haplotype FD. The remain-

JP167 is a juvenile female, which is part of a group consisting of 3 animals. Fur coloration of JP167 is clearly
intermediate between brown lemur and mongoose lemur
females. This led us to suspect in the field, that she might
be a hybrid. The two other group members are an adult
male and an adult female. We were only able to capture
the adult female, that exhibited normal mongoose lemur
fur coloration. She has the mtDNA haplotype of a regular
mongoose lemur and has no putative introgressed alleles.
Apart from the mtDNA, this adult female is also excluded
at 2 microsatellite loci from being the mother of JP167.
The second mongoose lemur of hybrid origin is an adult
female (JP184). She is a member of a small social group,
including herself, an adult male, subadult female and
juvenile male. The adult male has the normal fur coloration of a mongoose lemur male. The juvenile (JP152), like
JP184 exhibits a mixture of fur colours from E. mongoz and
E. fulvus. Parentage testing indicates that the adult hybrid
female JP184 is most likely (>90%) the mother of the
juvenile. The genotype of the juvenile contains none of
the 4 putative introgressed alleles from the mother. However, admixture analyses of the lemurs at Anjamena reveal
a proportion of brown lemur ancestry (Q2 = 0.192) in its
genotype that is consistent with an F2.
Descendants of hybrids in the mongoose lemur population
The 6 mongoose lemurs with one or two putative introgressed alleles might be descendants of a hybrid crossing.
Neither PCA nor admixture analyses were able to differentiate them from other mongoose lemurs. Consistent with

this, their coat coloration was normal for mongoose
lemurs and so they could not be F1s, and are unlikely to
be F2s, since the confirmed offspring of an F1 hybrid and
a mongoose lemur (JP152) has intermediate coat colour.
If hybridization had occurred, a single event could have
accounted for the allele distribution. Further data would
be required to assess whether these alleles truly represent
a signature of past introgression events, and to estimate
the rate of introgression.
Conclusions on hybrid crossings in the mongoose lemur
population
We found genetic evidence for a minimum of 2 hybridization events in mongoose lemurs of Anjamena. Two hybrid
crossings were very recent (F1). In addition, one of the F1
hybrids had an offspring where paternity could be genetically confirmed. Therefore, hybridization between mongoose and brown lemurs occurs in the wild and yields
fertile offspring, which can successfully backcross with
mongoose lemurs. A third potential hybrid crossing might
have happened a few generations ago, which would again
show the fertility of the hybrids.

for the brown lemurs at Anjamena. However, half of the
brown lemurs sampled have an E. mongoz mtDNA haplotype. As all 4 animals have the same haplotype MF, the
presence of that haplotype could be the consequence of a
single hybrid crossing. Interestingly, haplotype MF is not
found in any of the 35 mongoose lemurs sampled at Anjamena and is the most divergent of the 5 E. mongoz haplotypes found there (Figure 4). These two factors make it
likely that the hybrid crossing from which haplotype MF
is derived occurred in the past, with the mongoose lemurs
at Anjamena subsequently losing haplotype MF due to
genetic drift. Alternatively, it could have occurred between
a brown lemur male and a mongoose lemur female
located some distance from Anjamena.
Seven of the eight brown lemur genotypes from Anjamena
contain putative introgressed microsatellite alleles. The
only brown lemur without any introgressed alleles has the
mtDNA genotype of E. mongoz. The samples were collected from animals living in 7 different social groups at
Anjamena. Principal component analysis failed to group
the 8 animals closely together (Figure 2). Therefore, close
familial relationships are no explanation for the high
presence of introgressed alleles among these brown
lemurs. Fur coloration of all 8 animals appeared to be normal for red-fronted brown lemurs, excluding them from
being F1 or F2 hybrids. However, a larger sample from
brown lemurs at Anjamena and across the subspecies
range is needed to confirm this result. Some of the current
putative introgressed alleles might be found in other E. f.
rufus outside Anjamena, making an origin in E. mongoz
unlikely, while a more detailed study on the brown
lemurs at Anjamena might reveal new introgressed alleles.

One of the F1 hybrids has the mtDNA haplotype of a
brown lemur and the other of a mongoose lemur. Hybrid
crossings can therefore occur between E. mongoz females
and E. fulvus males as well as between E. mongoz males and
E. fulvus females.

Evolutionary consequences
Some time after the five species of Eulemur radiated across
Madagascar, a brown lemur radiation started, most likely
in the South, where E. f. albocollaris and E. f. collaris occur.
This is the only area where brown lemurs do not overlap
with another Eulemur species. Brown lemurs then radiated
back across the island to the North [43], becoming sympatric with the other 4 Eulemur species. However, no
hybrids are reported between the brown lemurs and sympatric E. rubriventer in the East, E. coronatus in the North,
or E. macaco in the Northwest. E mongoz is sympatric with
E. f. fulvus and E. f. rufus in the West, but there also seems
to be no hybridization between E. mongoz and E. f. fulvus.
Only E. f. rufus and E. mongoz at Anjamena are known to
hybridize.

Introgression into the brown lemur population
Due to the small sample size (N = 8) and also not knowing the familial relationships among the members of each
social group (containing several males and females), no
detailed information on hybrid crossings can be obtained

A possible explanation for this hybridization is that one
species only recently expanded its range and there were no
reproductive barriers in place between the two newly
overlapping taxa. During the radiation of brown lemurs
the Betsiboka river formed a barrier dividing E. fulvus pop-

ulations, resulting in it being the northern limit of E. f.
rufus, with E. f. fulvus subspecies being formed across the
river (see also Figure 1). In contrast, E. mongoz is one of the
few lemur taxa for which the Betsiboka river is not a taxonomic boundary [44]. The current mongoose lemur range
extends a little southwest of Anjamena, across the Mahavavy river. Our mtDNA sequence data shows (Figure 4)
that the mongoose lemurs at Anjamena are substantially
different from those at Ampijoroa (14–15 bp out of 1463
bp), but do not differ to the extent seen in the two brown
lemur subspecies (44–46 bp). This implies that the Betsiboka river serves as a geographic boundary in both taxa,
but was crossed by E. mongoz later. The other option
would be that E. f. rufus, coming from the southwest, only
recently crossed the Mahavavy river. However, genetic distances between animals on the west (Anadabomandry)
and east (Anjamena) side of this river are higher for E. f.
rufus (21–24 bp) than for E. mongoz (12–15 bp). This
again indicates that E. mongoz expanded its range more
recently than E. f. rufus.

remains were found near the coast at Anjohibe [46], to the
east of the Betsiboka river (Figure 1). There are two possible scenarios, which would explain the unusual current
mongoose lemur distribution [45], the fossil evidence
thus far available [46] and the low genetic differentiation
across the Betsiboka and Mahavavy rivers in E. mongoz
(this study). One is, that mongoose lemurs had a large distribution in the past with regular gene flow across the
range. Only once they lost their range in central Madagascar relatively recently, was gene flow no longer possible
across the range because the Betsiboka and Mahavay rivers
became geographical barriers. The other option is, that in
the past mongoose lemurs occurred only to the east of the
Betsiboka river all the way up to central highlands and
only later expanded their range towards the coast on the
west side of the Betsiboka and Mahavavy rivers, while disappearing from central Madagascar. In the first scenario
they were sympatric with E. f. fulvus and E. f. rufus for a
long time, while in the second scenario they only became
sympatric with E. f. rufus relatively recently.

A cladistic biogeographic analysis on the extant lemur distribution in western Madagascar suggests that E. mongoz
either had a wide distribution in the past and then disappeared from large parts of its former range, or dispersed
across otherwise efficient geographical barriers [45]. In
1939, Lamberton found a subfossil femur of E. mongoz at
Ampasambazimba [46], which lies in the central western
highlands of Madagascar, where the Betsiboka and Mahavavy rivers originate. More subfossil mongoose lemur

The influx of a new species into a novel ecosystem can
result in hybridization between the new species (in this
case E. mongoz) and the related native species (E. fulvus).
Where few reproductive barriers to gene flow exist, this
frequently leads to the rapid introgression of genetic and
phenotypic characters from one species into another [47].
In captivity, crosses between various E. fulvus subspecies
resulted in fertile offspring [48]. Among captive Eulemur
species, crossbreeding between E. macaco and E. fulvus

gave rise to fertile hybrids [48]. In the wild, hybridization
has been reported between E. macaco macaco and E. m. flavifrons [16], E. f. fulvus and E. f. rufus [17], and E. f. rufus
and E. f. albocollaris [18] subspecies. All these hybridization events among Eulemur species and subspecies indicate that reproductive barriers among Eulemur taxa are not
very well developed.
Hybridization between newly overlapping species provides a unique opportunity to observe the initial stages of
hybridization and its evolutionary consequences. Hybridization which results in fertile offspring, is expected to
introduce sets of alleles that gradually disperse through
the gene pool of the parent organisms through successive
backcrosses. Such extensive introgression might have
occurred among brown lemurs at Anjamena with 7 (88%)
brown lemurs possibly having introgressed alleles and 4
(50%) brown lemurs having the mtDNA haplotype of E.
mongoz. However, larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the extent of introgression. In mongoose lemurs,
only 8 (22%) of the 37 animals studied show signs of
introgression.
There are several possible evolutionary consequences of
hybridization (see also introduction). In extreme cases,
parental taxa may be lost in the process and/or new taxa
formed [21,22]. A third possibility is that a stable hybrid
zone will form, with limited introgression across the zone.
Having already radiated across Madagascar twice, the
genus Eulemur has proved to be very successful in adapting to a variety of ecological niches. Introgressive hybridization among taxa is known to quickly increase levels of
variation, allowing more rapid responses to environmental changes [21,22]. Considering all the reported hybridization events known so far between Eulemur taxa in the
wild [[16-18], this study], hybridization might also have
played an important role in the success of the radiation of
Eulemur across Madagascar.

Conclusion
The genetic data presented here confirms the occurrence
of hybridization between E. mongoz and E. fulvus in western Madagascar. Most other hybrid zones reported so far
in lemurs are also between Eulemur taxa [16-18]. Only one
hybridization event has been found among other lemur
taxa, that of Varecia variegata subspecies [19]. It is known
that some groups of organisms seem to hybridize more
readily than others [1,47] and Eulemur may be more capable of hybridizing than other lemur taxa. However,
hybrids are not easy to detect. They are much easier to
identify and are generally recorded more often if the
hybridizing taxa are brightly and distinctively coloured
(e.g., birds, butterflies [1]). That is very much the case for
Eulemur species and subspecies, as well as for Varecia variegata subspecies. The detection of hybridization in lemurs
may follow a similar time sequence as the discovery of
parent taxa, with nocturnal species lagging behind. For
nocturnal lemurs, the pelage coloration of which is neither bright nor varies much between taxa, only detailed
genetic studies are likely to detect hybridization events.
Our study records an instance of on-going hybridization
in the wild. Introgressive hybridization may hasten speciation and allow rapid ecological adaptation of taxa, hence
be one of the driving forces for the adaptive radiation of
lemurs in Madagascar.
