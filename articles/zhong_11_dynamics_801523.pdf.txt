The dynamics of vertebrate homeobox gene
evolution: gain and loss of genes in mouse
and human lineages
Ying-fu Zhong and Peter WH Holland*

Abstract
Background: Homeobox genes are a large and diverse group of genes, many of which play important roles in
transcriptional regulation during embryonic development. Comparison of homeobox genes between species may
provide insights into the evolution of developmental mechanisms.
Results: Here we report an extensive survey of human and mouse homeobox genes based on their most recent
genome assemblies, providing the first comprehensive analysis of mouse homeobox genes and updating an earlier
survey of human homeobox genes. In total we recognize 333 human homeobox loci comprising 255 probable
genes and 78 probable pseudogenes, and 324 mouse homeobox loci comprising 279 probable genes and 45
probable pseudogenes (accessible at http://homeodb.zoo.ox.ac.uk). Comparison to partial genome sequences from
other species allows us to resolve which differences are due to gain of genes and which are due to gene losses.
Conclusions: We find there has been much more homeobox gene loss in the rodent evolutionary lineage than in
the primate lineage. While humans have lost only the Msx3 gene, mice have lost Ventx, Argfx, Dprx, Shox, Rax2,
LOC647589, Tprx1 and Nanognb. This analysis provides insight into the patterns of homeobox gene evolution in the
mammals, and a step towards relating genomic evolution to phenotypic evolution.

Background
Homeobox genes comprise a large and diverse group of
genes, most of which are thought to act as transcription
factors. They are characterised by possession of one or
more homeobox sequences of 180 base pairs (or longer)
encoding homeodomain peptides that fold into helixloop-helix-turn-helix domains [1]. Homeobox genes are
found across eukaryotes but are most diverse in animal
genomes, following an evolutionary expansion of this
group of genes in the early evolution of Metazoa [2].
The best known homeobox genes are Hox genes, usually
arranged into gene clusters and known to play pivotal
roles in specification of cell identity along the developing anteroposterior body axis in the embryos of bilaterian animals. Many other homeobox genes also have key
roles in animal development, with homeobox genes
implicated in development of the brain, central nervous

system, skeleton, muscle, neural crest-derived tissues,
appendages, heart, liver and other structures.
After many years of confusion and debate, a robust
evolutionary classification of metazoan homeobox genes
has been established. Although there are slight differences between authors, most schemes recognise 11
‘classes’ of homeobox genes, within which there are over
100 gene families [3-5]. Gene families are defined as all
genes descended from a single progenitor gene in the
common ancestor of bilaterian animals, although some
additional gene families have been erected for genes of
unknown orthology. Having a robust classification of
gene facilitates comparison between species. There has
been much interest in elucidating the evolutionary history of homeobox genes, partly to ascertain whether
evolutionary changes in animal body organisation are
reflected in changes to the homeobox gene repertoire of
animals. It is known, for example, that the emergence of
vertebrates from their invertebrate chordate ancestors
was accompanied by an expansion in the number of
homeobox genes, from around 100 to over 200, through

sequencing [8]. The most recent version of the mouse
genome assembly is Build 37 (MGSCv37, C57BL/6J),
produced by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (MGSC) [9]. The complete homeobox gene repertoire of the mouse genome has not been analysed
previously.
Here we report a systematic identification of human
and mouse homeobox genes. Comparison between these
species and other vertebrates reveals all homeobox gene
gains, gene duplications and gene loss events that
occurred during the evolution of the two species since
they diverged from a common ancestor. We find that
the extent of homeobox gene duplication and the extent
of gain of novel, divergent genes has been similar in the
two evolutionary lineages; however, there has been
much more homeobox gene loss in the ancestry of
rodents than in the ancestry of humans.

genome duplication plus retention of duplicated genes
[6]. Far less has been documented about the dynamics
of homeobox gene evolution within the vertebrates,
although several studies focussed on individual genes or
gene families have highlighted occasional gene duplications and gene losses.
To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the complete homeobox gene superclass in mammalian genomes, we chose to focus on two species whose genomes
have been sequenced to high coverage, accurately
assembled and reasonably well annotated: human and
mouse. The comparison is additionally useful because
the biological functions of many human homeobox
genes were inferred through analysis of orthologues in
mouse. Differences between any two species, however,
cannot be interpreted in an evolutionary way without
reference to other genomes. Our aim, therefore, was to
characterise the similarities and differences between
human and mouse homeobox gene repertoires, and then
resolve these into gene losses or gene gains on either
the primate or rodent lineages by comparison to the
genomes of other vertebrate species. A comprehensive
survey of homeobox loci in the human genome was
undertaken by Holland et al. (2007) [3], using genome
sequence Build 35.1. This survey listed 300 human
homeobox loci comprising 235 probable functional
genes and 65 probable pseudogenes. In the intervening
years the human genome sequence has been refined,
with the most recent assembly being Build 37.2
(GRCh37.p2) released by the Genome Reference Consortium in 2010 [7]. We have therefore used this opportunity to update the survey of human homeobox genes.
Mouse, being a widely used model species for biological
and biomedical research, was an early target for genome

Results
Human homeobox gene repertoire

We identified 333 homeobox loci in the human genome,
including 255 probable functional genes and 78 probable
pseudogenes (Table 1; Additional File 1). Compared to
an earlier survey based on a previous assembly of the
human genome [3], 33 new loci were detected in the
present study.
Of these 33 loci, 24 are members of the Dux (double
homeobox) family. The evolution of this gene family is
complex because the homeobox sequence, or sequences,
of an ancient Dux sequence have become incorporated
into repetitive DNA elements (’DUX4’ sequences) found
in both heterochromatin and euchromatin. It is also
possible that these sequences vary in copy number
between individuals. The 24 newly identified human

Dux loci include 23 ‘DUX4’ sequences (Figure 1) and a
degraded sequence related to DUXBL (Figure 2). The 23
DUX4-like sequences include four loci with putative
introns interrupting the coding sequence (on chromosomes 3, 4 and 10), although one of these loci (on chromosome 10) is disrupted by a translocation or
alternatively is the remnants of two degraded pseudogenes (Figure 1). Most of the DUX4-like sequences are
intronless and arranged in arrays; these include the
D4Z4 locus at 4q35 linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy [10,11]. In this array, one sequence is
identical to the original DUX4 sequence initially
reported as an isolated clone but not previously found
in a genomic assembly.
Following the first report of an intron-containing Dux
gene on chromosome 19 (DUXA) by Booth and Holland
(2007) [12], a distinct intron-containing locus DUXB on
chromosome 16 was reported by Holland et al. (2007)
[3]. Clapp et al. (2007) [13] found that two further
intron-containing Dux genes, DUXC and DUXBL
(DUXB-like), were present in some mammals but lost

from human, although subsequent work from the same
research group showed that a degraded DUXBL-related
sequence does exist in the human genome at chromosome 10q22 in a syntenic region to the mouse Duxbl
locus located at 14 A3 [14]. Leidenroth and Hewitt
(2010) [14] showed that the DUXBL sequence at 10q22
is truncated (it lacks the second homeobox sequence)
and is most likely a pseudogene. The same authors identified local paralogy between the human DUXB and
DUXBL locations, as both are adjacent to a Cphx-like
sequence, indicative of a possible segmental duplication
followed by transposition. Our analyses confirm these
findings, but detect additional Cphx-loci. We find that
these flank both DUXB and DUXBL providing additional support for segmental duplication in the human
genome (Figure 2).
The Cphx (cytoplasmic polyadenylated homeobox)
gene family was first described from mouse [15]. No
orthologue was described in the survey of Holland et al.
(2007) [3], although subsequently the Mouse Genome
Informatics (MGI) Mammalian Orthology and

Figure 2 DUXB and CPHX loci in mouse and human. (A) Mouse DUXB-like (Duxbl, orange arrows) and Cphx (red arrows), together with a nonhomeobox gene Plac9 (green arrows), have been duplicated giving three copies each at chromosome 14A3. (B) Human Cphx-related homeobox

dashes deletons/insertions and red characters conservative substitutions. Hs, Homo sapiens; Mm, Mus musculus.

Comparative Mapping applications identified human
LOC219347 on chromosome 10 as the putative human
CPHX gene, and the Ensembl project identified a locus
on chromosome 16 as another putative human CPHX
gene (Ensemble ID: ENSG00000232078). Our analyses
of genome build 37.2 reveal the situation is more complex. We find four human Cphx-related homeobox loci
on chromosomes 10 and 16, flanking the DUXBL pseudogene and the DUXB gene (Figure 2). Although these
sequences have only weak sequence similarity to the
Cphx homeobox loci of mouse (maximally 35/60 residues) they are in syntenic locations (or one syntenic
location plus one duplicated region) highly suggestive of
cryptic orthology. The two Cphx-like loci at 10q22.3 are
both truncated, with frameshifts in the sequence encoding helix 3 of the homeodomain; we classify these as
pseudogenes. The two Cphx-like loci at 16q23.1
(CPHX1 and CPHX2) have complete homeobox
sequences and possess introns; these loci may be
functional.
Four additional loci included in the current survey
define a new gene family: Nanognb. The single putative
functional member of this gene family in human is the

NANOGNB (Nanog neighbour) gene, a locus located
only about 15 kb from the human NANOG gene at
chromosome 12p13.31 (Figure 3). The locus, labelled as
EntrezGene LOC360030, was originally named ‘homeobox C14’ but this name has been changed to
NANOGNB by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee to avoid confusion with Hoxc cluster genes
which are not closely related. The sequence was
excluded from the homeobox gene survey of Holland et
al. (2007) [3] due to its overall weak similarity to other
homeobox genes; however, further analysis reveals that
the deduced homeodomain sequence, though divergent,
would be capable of folding into three alpha helices,
compatible with a homeodomain tertiary structure.
Three new loci were detected that are pseudogenes
derived from NANOGNB, located on chromosomes 2,
12 and X, whereas the original locus at 12p13 contains
a complete homeobox sequence and possible introns.
Together these four loci define a gene family that cannot be accommodated easily into one of the 11 established gene classes of metazoan homeobox.
The final additional gene found in the present survey
is LOC647589 at chromosome 12q24.33 (Figure 4). It

Mouse homeobox gene repertoire

In the mouse genome, we identified 324 homeobox loci,
which we divide into 279 probable functional genes, 45
probable pseudogenes.
As in the human genome, most homeobox genes are
scattered on different chromosomes, with a minority
clustered together. The Hoxa, Hoxb, Hoxc and Hoxd
gene clusters are well known and identical in gene complement between human and mouse. In contrast, the
Dux clusters and Rhox cluster are very different in

LOC647589 was detected in this study at human chromosome

genome sequences, but not in mouse or rat. The orange arrow and

composition between the two species, and the Obox
gene cluster is present in mouse but not human.
The Dux (double homeobox) cluster is complex, and
its evolution has been studied in detail by Clapp et al.
(2007) [13]. In mouse, we identify six Dux loci:
Gm4981, Dux and LOC100504180 at chromosome 10
B4 (Figure 1), and Duxbl and its two tandem copies
(Gm10394 and Gm10391) at chromosome 14 A3 [16]. It
is interesting to note that Duxbl, together with another
homeobox gene Cphx, has been tandemly duplicated
twice giving three copies each of Duxbl and Cphx
(Figure 2). This triplication event is not detected in
other mammalian genomes, even in rat, suggesting it
occurred recently in evolution.
Rhox (reproductive homeobox) genes, are expressed
during embryogenesis and gametogenesis [17]. In the
mouse genome, we identified 36 Rhox loci. All Rhox
loci we indentified are clustered together at chromosome X A3.3 (Figure 5), but it should be noted that the
previously reported Rhox5 is not included in the reference assembly genome. As noted by others [18], the
Rhox gene cluster is larger than most other homeobox
gene clusters. In contrast, the human genome sequence
includes only three Rhox genes found located at chromosome Xq24 (Figure 5).
The full repertoire of mouse homeobox genes is
summarized in Table 1 and described in Additional
Files 2, 3 and 4.
Origin of a homeobox gene on the primate lineage

Genes that are present in one species but not another
could reflect either gene loss in one lineage or the origin
of a new gene (usually by duplication and divergence) in
the other lineage. These two mutually exclusive possibilities can be distinguished clearly by examining other
genomes, taking into account the phylogenetic history
between the various species. Using this approach, we
deduce that just one homeobox gene in the human genome is a novel gene that arose during primate evolution
since the divergence of the primate and rodent evolutionary lineages.
LEUTX (leucine twenty homeobox) is a gene of
unknown function that is present in the human genome
at position 19q13.2 (Figure 6; [3]. Closely related
sequences can be detected in the draft genome
sequences of other primates (chimpanzee, orangutan,
rhesus macaque), and these are located at a genomic
location syntenic to human LEUTX (Table 2; Additional
File 5). No homologues are detected outside primates.
Examination of the syntenic region in mouse, rat, cow
and dog reveals absence of the gene at the expected
location and presence of a set of unusual genes in
human (Figure 6). We suggest therefore that LEUTX
arose on the primate lineage. It has been hypothesized

previously that LEUTX arose by tandem duplication and
extreme divergence from the Otx family gene CRX
which is located on the same chromosome (8 MB distant), although timing was unknown [3].
Origin of homeobox genes on the rodent lineage

Using the same comparative approach, we deduce that
the Obox homeobox gene cluster, plus three other
homeobox genes, arose during on the evolutionary lineage leading to mouse since the divergence of the primate and rodent evolutionary lineages.
The Obox (oocyte specific homeobox) genes have
been reported previously [19] and implicated in reproductive biology of the mouse, but the full complexity
of this gene family is not widely appreciated. We identified 36 Obox family loci in total, including one large
cluster at chromosome 7 A1-2 regions (6 intron-containing genes and 28 intronless loci) and two intronless
probable pseudogenes at chromosome 17 B1 and E1
(Figure 7). The previously reported Obox4 gene is not
included here since it is absent from the assembled
genome sequence. Transcripts from the Obox gene
family are preferentially detected in the gonads [19]

although high-throughput screens have detected
expression in additional tissues [20,21]. Since clear
homologues of Obox genes are not present in primates, nor other mammals, we suggest that the Obox
gene family emerged specifically in rodents after the
divergence of primates and rodents with further multiple duplications resulting in the tandem organization
of Obox in murine genomes [22].
Three further homeobox genes, which we have only
found in rodents thus far, are located physically close to or within - the Obox gene cluster. Crxos1 is a mouse
homeobox gene expressed in murine embryonic stem
(ES) cells and is essential for ES cell self-renewal [23]. It
is located at chromosome 7 A1, adjacent to the Crx gene,
on the opposite side to the Obox genes (Figure 7). Crxos1
contains 5 exons and 4 introns, and encodes two homeodomain sequences which cannot readily be classified into
any of the eleven main homeodomain classes. Eight pseudogenes are also found that contain one of the two
Crxos1 homeodomains. In addition there are 10 unannotated homeobox loci with lower similarity to Crxos1, ranging from 68% to 84% similarity over region of
homeodomain (Additional File 4). Gm5585 and Gm7235
are two other homeobox loci present only in rodents
according to our database searches. Gm5585 has predicted introns, and Gm7235 has an unclear gene structure. All three loci have homeobox sequences that are
quite distinct from the Obox genes, but they are close
physical proximity (Figure 7). It is possible, therefore,
that they originated in the same series of tandem duplications that generated the Obox gene cluster, followed by
sequence divergence. We also detected three pseudogenes of Gm5585 at chromosome 2B, 9F1 and XE1.

Loss of homeobox genes

As outlined above, genes that are present in one species
but not another could reflect either gene loss or gene
gain. We can infer that gene loss has taken place if a
range of mammalian species possess the gene, which is

missing in just one mammalian lineage (human or
mouse). This inference is particularly solid if the gene is
present in an evolutionary lineage that is a phylogenetic
outgroup to primates plus rodents, or in an ingroup
lineage that is related to the species lacking the gene in
question. Using this logic, we infer that one homeobox
gene was lost from the human genome and eight were
lost from mice, since the divergence of these two evolutionary lineages (Table 2).

14.91 MB

The sole homeobox gene deduced to have been lost in
human, compared to mice, is the MSX3 (muscle segment homeobox 3) gene. The Msx3 gene is a member
of Msx family within the ANTP class and was first
reported in mouse [24]. This gene is present in the
mouse and rat genomes, but is absent from the syntenic
position in human (Figure 8). Through phylogenomic
analysis, we found a related sequence (LOC100154934)
in the pig genome in the syntenic genomic region.
Furthermore, it has been shown previously that the
Msx3 genomic region forms part of a fourfold paralogy
group with Msx1 and Msx2, arising in the genome
duplications in early vertebrate evolution [25]. It is clear,
therefore, that Msx3 was lost secondarily in primate
evolution.

In contrast to this single gene loss, the mouse genome
has secondarily lost Ventx, Argfx, Dprx, Shox, Rax2,
LOC647589, Tprx1 and Nanognb since divergence from
the common ancestor of rodents and primates. The
Ventx (VENT homeobox) gene is found at human chromosome 10q26.3. There are two tandemly arranged putative orthologues in amphioxus, with identical
homeodomains to each other [26], plus clear orthologues
on chicken chromosome 6 and dog chromosome 28, at
syntenic positions to the human gene (Figure 9). Presence in chicken, and possibly amphioxus, indicates that
the gene is older than mammals. No Ventx gene can be
found in the mouse or rat genomes, although the syntenic region is found at mouse chromosome 5B3 and on
rat chromosome 1, clearly indicating gene loss (Figure 9).
The Argfx (arginine-fifty homeobox) gene was first
detected in the human genome [12] and related loci, in a
syntenic position, have since been reported from many
other mammals albeit with critical sequence changes that
disrupt the deduced coding region [27]. The gene has
clearly been lost from rodent genomes [27] (Figure 10).
The Dprx (divergent-paired related homeobox) gene
was also first found in the human genome, with the
putative functional locus at 19q13 and seven dispersed
pseudogenes [12]. In the present study we found orthologues in the genomes of dog and horse, but not mouse
or rat, at the syntenic region (Figure 11). Since dog and
horse belong to the Laurasiatheria lineage, while mouse,
rat and human are Supraprimates, this is clearly indicative of gene loss in rodents.
The Shox (short stature homeobox) gene family
includes SHOX and SHOX2 in the human genome, but
only Shox2 in the mouse genome. Interestingly, in
humans the SHOX gene is present on both X and Y chromosomes, presumably descendent from a formerly autosomal region, while SHOX2 is on chromosome 3. The
duplication between Shox and Shox2 is ancient, since

chicken has a Shox gene in a syntenic position to the
human gene (Figure 12). The absence in mouse, in the
equivalent genomic context, is indicative of gene loss.
The Rax (retina and anterior neural fold homeobox)
gene family includes RAX and RAX2 in the human genome, but only RAX in the mouse genome. We found
orthologues of RAX2 in the chicken genome, but not in
the syntenic region of mouse or rat, clearly indicating
gene loss (Figure 13).
As noted earlier, LOC647589, located at chromosome
12q24.33 in human, was first detected in this survey
(Figure 4). No annotation is found in genomes outside
of human currently, although we find that homologous
sequences can be detected in dog (chr26:3,013,6053,024,652), cat (scaffold_2339:32,127-43,778), cow
(chr17:46,768,917-46,783,902), pig (chr14:22,079,38422,092,812) and horse (chr8:30,059,056-30,073,471) genome sequences, although not in mouse or rat. This phylogenetic distribution dates the origin of the gene to
before the divergence of Supraprimates (including
human and mouse) and Laurasiatheria (including dog,
cat, cow, pig and horse). Examining its genomic context,
we found that the gene is linked to a series of genes

encoding zinc finger proteins in the human and cattle
genomes; mouse and rat are lacking this genomic
region, indicating gene loss (Figure 4).
The Tprx (tetra-peptide repeat homeobox) gene family
contains one probable functional gene in human
(TPRX1), one tandem duplicate that is possibly nonfunctional (TPRX2P), two retrotransposed pseudogenes
(TPRX1P1, TPRX1P2) and one unusual, probably nonfunctional, expressed sequence (TPRXL). The TPRX1
locus is incorrectly annotated in the NCBI and EBI
assemblies, as cDNA clone data indicate an additional 5’
exon and a different homeobox sequence (Additional
File 6). The TPRX1 and TPRX2P loci flank the CRX
gene in human. Examining the syntenic region in other
mammalian species reveals a complex picture (Figure
14). In dog, both TPRX1 and TPRX2P are present, as is
the latter locus in cow. We infer, therefore, that this
condition predates the divergence of the Supraprimates
(including human and mouse) and Laurasiatheria
(including dog and cow) lineages of placental mammals.
This implies loss in rodents. However, it is noteworthy
that the same genomic region in rodents contains the
Obox and Crxos1 loci (Figures 7, 14) and is currently
unclear if these genes arose separately on the rodent
lineage or by duplication and divergence from Tprx loci.

Figure 14 Tprx loci are not present in rodent genomes. In the
human genome, the Tprx family contains one probable functional
gene (TPRX1) and a possibly non-functional tandem duplicate
(TPRX2P) at chromosome 19q13, either side of the Otx-family CRX
gene. The additional Tprx loci, TPRX1P1, TPRX1P2 and TPRXL, are
elsewhere in the genome and are not shown. Examination of the
region syntenic to human 19q13 in other mammals reveals clear
orthologues of Tprx family loci in cow and dog, but not mouse and
rat. In rodents, another homeobox gene Crxos1 is found. Orange
arrows indicate homeobox genes; grey arrows are non-homeobox
genes.

As noted above, NANOGNB (LOC360030) is located
close to the NANOG gene but is highly divergent from
it. Orthologous genes at the syntenic position are present in horse and dog indicating that the gene predates
the divergence of the Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria
(Figure 3). Absence in mouse and rat is therefore a secondary condition.

Discussion
We identified and classified 324 homeobox loci in the
mouse genome. For completeness, these include many
loci that are probably pseudogenes that do not have
potential to code for functional proteins. Our current
estimate of the number of functional homeobox genes
in the mouse is 279. Although most mouse homeobox
loci are dispersed around the genome, there are several
large genomic clusters or arrays. These include the four
well-known Hox gene clusters, plus the more recently
characterised and much larger Obox and Rhox clusters.
Our analyses have refined the structure of the latter two
clusters, revealing some hitherto undescribed loci, plus
some novel divergent homeobox loci that are in, or
close to, the Obox array.
To enable accurate comparison between species, we
have refined the human homeobox survey of Holland et
al. (2007) [3] using more recent genome sequence and
assembly data. The principle changes made are an
updated and enlarged survey of human Dux family
sequences and genes, inclusion of the NANOGNB gene
(formerly C14) and its pseudogenes, identification of
four Cphx family loci and inclusion of the newly annotated locus LOC647589. These updates, together with
the mouse loci, have been incorporated into the latest

on-line release of HomeoDB [28], freely accessible at
http://homeodb.zoo.ox.ac.uk.
A simple comparison between the surveys of mouse
and human homeobox loci highlights the higher number
of homeobox loci found in the mouse genome, although
this figure is heavily influenced by the extensive Obox
and Rhox arrays. More meaningful insight is gained by
considering each gene family in turn, and assessing
whether differences represent gain or loss in one or
other evolutionary lineage. This was undertaken by
focussing on each difference between the two species
and examining the genomes of other mammals. Ideally,
such a comparison would use completely sequenced,
assembled and annotated genome sequences from multiple species, but this is yet possible with current datasets.

Human

Instead, we exploited the fact that mammalian genomes,
and to a lesser extent the genomes of other vertebrates,
show extensive synteny, so that genomic regions harbouring a particular homeobox locus in either mouse or
human could be searched for in other species. Even
though such data are necessarily incomplete, because
the same syntenic region will not have been assembled
in each genome, this approach allowed us to polarise
the evolutionary gains and losses of homeobox loci
(Table 2, Figure 15). For example, if a locus is present
in human but not mouse, and it is then found at the
syntenic location in the dog genome, this allows us to
deduce that the locus has been lost from the mouse
genome; it is not a new gene arising somewhere on the
evolutionary lineage leading to human. This logic is

Figure 15 A summary of homeobox gene dynamics in the mouse and human evolutionary lineages. The majority of homeobox genes
are conserved between mouse and human lineages (grey squares), although some have undergone duplication to different extents (cascaded
boxes). Humans have lost the Msx3 gene; mice have lost VENTX, ARGFX, DPRX, SHOX, RAX2, LOC647589, NANOGB and TPRX1 (dashed boxes). Three
new homeobox loci (Gm7235, Gm5585 and Crxos1) and one new cluster (Obox) arose in the rodent lineage; one new gene Leutx arose in the
lineage leading to primates.

Zhong and Holland BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:169

possible because the phylogenetic relationships between
major mammalian orders are well established, based on
extensive molecular data [29-31]. In the example given,
because human is more closely related to mouse (in the
Supraprimate clade, also called Euarchontoglires) than it
is to dog (in Laurasiatheria), the gene must have existed
in the common ancestor of Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria, which also includes the ancestry of the mouse
lineage.
Considering gains of genes, there are parallels between
the mouse and human evolutionary histories. The gene
LEUTX seems to be a gain on the evolutionary lineage
leading to human, and thus far we have not detected it
outside primates. Since it contains a homeobox
sequence, it must have originated from another homeobox gene by sequence divergence, probably preceded by
gene duplication. The source gene is not known,
although the location of LEUTX in chromosome band
19q13 suggests that LEUTX may have originated by tandem duplication from the CRX gene in the Otx gene
family [3], or from the mammalian TPRX1 gene which
itself may have originated from CRX. Interestingly, the
gene gains in the rodent lineage map to the equivalent
region of the mouse genome, although not in precisely
the same syntenic location as LEUTX. Mouse Crxos1 is
the immediate neighbour of the mouse Crx gene, while
the Obox array, Gm5585 and Gm7235 lie on the other
side of Crx. Two possible scenarios could account for
this pattern. In one model, the Tprx loci (which are
neighbours of Crx and existed in ancestral placental
mammals) underwent extensive sequence divergence
and then duplication in rodent evolution, generating the
Crxos1, Obox genes, Gm5585 and Gm7235, while the
same gene (or Crx) duplicated to give Leutx in primate
evolution. Alternatively, the Tprx1 gene was lost by
deletion in rodents, and the Crxos1, Obox, Gm5585 and
Gm7235 genes arose directly by duplication and divergence of Crx. It is not yet possible to distinguish
between these scenarios, although both highlight genomic plasticity of this region in both rodent and primate
evolution.
Perhaps the most striking finding from our study
relates to gene loss. By applying a phylogenomic
approach, we found that the rodent lineage has experienced much more homeobox gene loss than has the primate lineage, in the same period of evolutionary time.
The human genome has lost just a single homeobox
gene, Msx3, whereas the mouse genome has secondarily
lost Ventx, Argfx, Dprx, Shox, Rax2, LOC647589, Tprx1
and Nanognb. In seven of these cases the loss is by deletion of the gene or genomic region; the Tprx1 gene, discussed above, may be loss by deletion or simply by
excessive divergence. It is not clear why gene loss
should be so much more prevalent in one mammalian

Page 11 of 13

lineage than in another. There are, however, parallels
elsewhere in the animal kingdom. A comparison of
homeobox gene diversity in each of the three chordate
subphyla - vertebrates, cephalochordates and tunicates revealed dramatically different patterns of gene loss in
each lineage. Starting from just over one hundred
homeobox genes inferred to have been present in the
common ancestor of all chordates, the tunicates (or at
least those examined thus far) have lost 28 genes, vertebrates lost 9 genes (and duplicated others), while cephalochordates, represented by amphioxus Branchiostoma
floridae, lost none [32].

Conclusions
Resolving the complete patterns of gene gain and gene
loss across the animal kingdom is an important goal for
comparative genomics, and is relevant to any attempt to
relate genome evolution to phenotypic evolution. In this
research, we have started this line of enquiry for the
mammalian homeobox genes, and uncovered an unexpected difference in the extent of gene loss between two
evolutionary lineages.
Using comparative genomics, we find that there has
been much more homeobox gene loss in the rodent
evolutionary lineage than in the primate evolutionary
lineage, since the time of divergence from their common
ancestor. While the human lineage has lost only the
Msx3 gene, mice have lost Ventx, Argfx, Dprx, Shox,
Rax2, LOC647589, Tprx1 and Nanognb. This analysis
provides insight into the patterns of homeobox gene
evolution in the mammals, and is a step towards relating
genomic evolution to phenotypic evolution.
As more mammalian genomes are sequenced to high
coverage, assembled and annotated, it is hoped that
further such studies will uncover the patterns and processes underlining genome evolution in this important
and diverse taxon.
Methods
Genome sequence data were downloaded from the
NCBI FTP server[33], including Homo sapiens Build
37.2 (GRCh37.p2), Mus musculus Build 37.1 (C57BL/6J),
Pan troglodytes Build 2.1 (Pan_troglodytes-2.1), Macaca

(Sscrofa9.2), Gallus gallus Build 2.1 (Gallus_gallus-2.1)
and Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis Build 1.1 (v4.2) (Table
2). These genomic sequences were first translated into
peptides in all six possible reading frames using the
‘transeq’ tool in the EMBOSS suite [34]. These translated sequences constituted the target databases for
homeodomain searches.

Zhong and Holland BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/169

Searching for homeodomains employed the tools
‘hmmbuild’ and ‘hmmsearch’ in the HMMER3 package
http://hmmer.org/[35] as follows. First, homeodomain
sequences were retrieved from HomeoDBv1.2, using the
‘download’ tool, for the following species: human,
amphioxus, beetle, fruitfly and honeybee [28]. These
comprise comprehensive, manually-curated, datasets for
each species. Second, ClustalW [36] was used to align
homeodomain sequences, and this alignment converted
manually into ‘STOCKHOLM 1.0’ format, as described
in the ‘User’s Guide’ for HMMER3. Third, hmmbuild
was used to construct a profile hidden Markov model
(profile HMM); and fourth, domain scanning used
hmmsearch with the profile HMM and the translated
genome sequences as inputs. The predicted homeodomain sequences from each species were collected manually from the HMMER3 search results files, and
individually verified using BLAST toolkit [37] and CDSearch [38] before a final list of homeodomains was
compiled. In cases of extreme sequence divergence,
Phyre [39] was used to evaluate potential secondary
structure. Gene annotation information from NCBI was
then used to locate each predicted homeodomain in the
genome sequence.
