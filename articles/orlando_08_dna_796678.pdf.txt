Abstract
Background: Although today 15% of living primates are endemic to Madagascar, their diversity
was even greater in the recent past since dozens of extinct species have been recovered from
Holocene excavation sites. Among them were the so-called "giant lemurs" some of which weighed
up to 160 kg. Although extensively studied, the phylogenetic relationships between extinct and
extant lemurs are still difficult to decipher, mainly due to morphological specializations that reflect
ecology more than phylogeny, resulting in rampant homoplasy.
Results: Ancient DNA recovered from subfossils recently supported a sister relationship between
giant "sloth" lemurs and extant indriids and helped to revise the phylogenetic position of
Megaladapis edwardsi among lemuriformes, but several taxa – such as the Archaeolemuridae – still
await analysis. We therefore used ancient DNA technology to address the phylogenetic status of
the two archaeolemurid genera (Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus). Despite poor DNA preservation
conditions in subtropical environments, we managed to recover 94- to 539-bp sequences for two
mitochondrial genes among 5 subfossil samples.
Conclusion: This new sequence information provides evidence for the proximity of Archaeolemur
and Hadropithecus to extant indriids, in agreement with earlier assessments of their taxonomic
status (Primates, Indrioidea) and in contrast to recent suggestions of a closer relationship to the
Lemuridae made on the basis of analyses of dental developmental and postcranial characters. These
data provide new insights into the evolution of the locomotor apparatus among lemurids and
indriids.

Background
At the time of the first settlers over 2000 years ago [1,2],
Madagascar harboured a greater faunal and floral diversity

than today. Pygmy hippos and the world's largest bird –
the Great Elephant Bird Aepyornis maximus – are just two
striking examples of those endemic species that began to

decline and finally disappeared completely in the centuries following human colonization [1,3]. Albeit emblematic of Madagascar (>90 species among 15 genera
currently alive in Madagascar, which represents about
15% of the whole diversity among Primates), lemurs do
not stand as an exception [4-6]. Some 2,000 years ago,
they inhabited a wide variety of wooded terrains, from
forests to open woodlands and marshlands [7]. A spectacular array of life history traits derives from a single ancestral primate that colonized Madagascar around 60MYA
[8]. But human activities, such as overhunting and habitat
modifications related to farming and pastoralism, led at
least 17 species – belonging to nine different genera – to
eventual extinction [9,10]. Several entire families – the
Archaeolemuridae, Palaeopropithecidae, and Megaladapidae – disappeared.
Because all of the extinct species were larger than extant
species, they are called 'giant' lemurs. Some of them displayed particularly spectacular features (for example,
enormous body size, elongated rostra and widely separated orbits, extremely rapid dental development). The
Palaeopropithecidae, including the most specialized
genus, Palaeopropithecus and its close relative Archaeoindris,
as well as the smaller-bodied Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, were so convergent on tree sloths that they have
been dubbed the "sloth lemurs" [11]. However, Archaeoindris, despite its specializations for climbing, would have
had to spend most of its time on the ground due to a body
mass (ca. 160 kg) rivalling that of male gorillas [12]. The
megaladapids, some of which rivalled female gorillas in
body mass at ca. 88 kg [12], were slow climbers capable of
suspension but not leaping [13]. They sported peculiar
cranial specializations for consuming leaves and converged postcranially with koalas; they have thus been
dubbed "koala lemurs."
Extinct and extant lemurs exhibit an extraordinary range
in body size and diversity of locomotor and dietary patterns. Ecologically driven convergences have considerably
confounded interpretations of the phylogenetic relationships among lemurs. However, morphological data (cranial and postcranial characters, developmental features)
have aided in the construction of a number of different
phylogenetic hypotheses [14,15] some of which have
been tested using molecular tools. For instance, Crovella
et al. (1994) used hybridization features of highly
repeated DNA probes to support the proximity of the
extinct Pachylemur insignis to the ruffed lemurs (Varecia
variegata) [16]. More recently, using PCR to recover short
overlapping fragment over the cytochrome b gene, Yoder
et al. (1999) [17] and Karanth et al. (2005) [18] were able
to confirm Palaeopropithecidae as a sister group of extant
indriids but challenged the long-standing proximity of
Megaladapis to Lepilemur.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/121

Other thorny phylogenetic questions still await a molecular contribution. Such is the case for the least arboreal and
most terrestrial lemurs, the Archaeolemuridae [19,20].
Among Lemuriformes, this family is presumed to belong
to the superfamily Indrioidea and consists of three extinct
species: Archaeolemur edwardsi, Archaeolemur majori, and
Hadropithecus stenognathus [7,19]. Hadropithecus survived
until the end of the first millennium A.D. whereas Archaeolemur experienced at least a half-a-millennium reprieve
[1], possibly thanks to a greater plasticity of resources/
habitat exploitation [21]. All of the Archaeolemuridae
were extremely powerfully built [19] and exhibited characters reminiscent of cercopithecoids [22]. On the basis of
cranial anatomy and dental morphology, Archaeolemuridae have been considered the sister taxon of extant indriids and the palaeopropithecids (families Indriidae and
Palaeopropithecidae) [23-25]. However, developmental
features [26] as well as the postcranial characters of a
newly excavated Hadropithecus subadult (Andrahomana
Cave, southeastern Madagascar [27,28]) recently challenged this consensual scenario and underscored striking
similarities with lemurids (family Lemuridae). The debate
is therefore still open [18].
None of the 11 archaeolemurid specimens analysed so far
by molecular biologists yielded amplifiable DNA [18]. In
this study, we undertook an extensive analysis of 12 new
Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus subfossil remains. We
report for the first time the successful characterization of
94–539 bp along two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b
and 12S rRNA). This sequence data provides a good support for a sistership between archaeolemurids and extant
indriids, in agreement with the most generally accepted
morphological phylogenetic scenario but in contrast to
recent suggestions made on the basis of analyses of dental
developmental and postcranial data.

Results
To further investigate the evolutionary history of giant
lemurs, we performed an ancient DNA study on 12 subfossil remains representing 10 individuals belonging to
three extinct giant lemur genera (Table 1). Short, overlapping segments of three mitochondrial genes (control
region, cytochrome b and 12S rRNA) and one nuclear
gene (IRBP) were targeted by PCR (Table S1, Additional
file 1). The maximal amplicon length was about 160 bp
(including primers). Among the 12 specimens analyzed,
only 5 yielded amplifiable DNA although numerous
extractions and PCR reactions were performed (Table S2,
Additional file 1). It is noteworthy that none of the Control Region fragments targeted gave positive results, suggesting poor efficiency of the PCR primers used here. Even
for samples that delivered authentic mtDNA fragments,
no nuclear DNA was recovered although fragments as
short as 80 bp were targeted (Table S2, Additional file 1).

Column 'Ancient DNA' summarizes the samples that gave authentic ancient DNA fragments.

The specimen under collection number 1937–44 at the
MNHN yielded authentic DNA fragments when a bone
fragment (sample CH147) was sampled but no result
when a molar root (sample CH190) was analyzed (Table
1 & Table S2, Additional file 1). All in all, these results suggest poor DNA preservation conditions in the subfossils,
which is consistent with what is known about DNA decay
in warm subtropical environments [29] and with a previous ancient DNA survey of Malagasy subfossils [18,30].
Despite such difficulties, we managed to recover authentic
ancient DNA sequences from individuals belonging to
each of the three genera sampled (Archaeolemur, Hadropithecus and Megaladapis). Sample CH147 (Megaladapis
edwardsi) allowed the recovery of a 190-bp cytochrome b
sequence that exhibited one and three transitions with the
two Megaladapis sequences reported in [18] (Accession
numbers Genbank:AY894790 and AY894791, respectively). Notably, all these sequences were highly divergent
(34 substitutions) from the Megaladapis haplotype
described in [31] (Figure 1a, noted with a star). This haplotype (Accession number Genbank:AJ278142) was
already criticized by Karanth et al. (2005) [18] and is now
definitively confirmed as a probable PCR-contaminant.
Archaeolemur majori samples (CH210 and CH146) delivered respectively 269-bp and 335-bp in cytochrome b
(Table 1). Both sequences were identical over the 269
shared nucleotides but markedly different from all available lemur sequences. Archaeolemur edwardsi sample
CH126 instead yielded a 190-bp cytochrome b sequence
(Table 1) that exhibited only a minimum number of 4
substitutions with Archaeolemur majori haplotypes while
the 94-bp cytochrome b sequence obtained from Hadrop-

ithecus stenognathus sample CH421 was found to exhibit a
larger divergence from the Archaeolemur sequences (24
substitutions). Raw divergences were in good agreement
with what was expected from morphological similarities
between these species and genera [19,22]. Because our
procedures respect the most stringent criteria of authenticity (independent extractions/amplifications, cloning and
sequencing; see Materials and methods), we are confident
that the ancient DNA sequences reported here are authentic and we used them in phylogenetic analyses (Figure
1ab).
Accordingly, we retrieved all strepsirrhine cytochrome b
and 12S rRNA sequences available in Genbank and generated 12 different datasets (Table 2 and Additional data
file: for a complete list of the different sequences used).
For each of these datasets, phylogenetic trees were built
using both maximum likelihood and bayesian methods.
Including the new Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus
sequences in the dataset confirmed the indisputable
monophyly of Malagasy Lemuriformes. This provided
supplemental support to the scenario of a single origin for
all Malagasy Primates [32] (reviewed in [33]) and therefore to the authenticity of our sequences (the 'phylogenetic sense' criterion; discussed for instance in [34]).
Furthermore, most phylogenies showed the best bootstrap values and posterior probabilities for a sistership
between Archaeolemur (and Hadropithecus) and indriids
(up to 86.0% and 0.99, respectively; Table 2, summarized
in Figure 1b). Alternative topologies relating Archaeolemur
(and Hadropithecus) to either lemurids, cheirogaleids, lepilemurids or lorisiformes received no more than marginal
bootstrap values or posterior probabilities (Table 2).

trees recovered from the analysis of our 12 datasets.

Therefore, regardless of the phylogenetic method or the
sequence dataset used, the ancient DNA sequences recovered in this study supported the existence of an Archaeolemuridae-Indriidae clade (Table 2; Figure 1b).
Interestingly, despite significant variation among datasets
(Table S3, Additional file 1), Approximately Unbiased
(AU, [35]) and KH tests [36] come to similar conclusions
by rejecting the 3 latter alternative topologies and by
showing maximal p-values for the sistership between
Archaeolemur (and Hadropithecus) and indriids. It is noteworthy, also, that the molecular topology presented here
(Figure 1b) matches exactly that presented for extant taxa
only by DelPero et al. (2004) [37] on page 440) as one of
the "two remarkably similar topologies that were strongly
supported at most of the internal nodes". However, a phylogenomic toolkit using extensive nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data came to different conclusions
regarding the position of Propithecus (family Indriidae)
and Lepilemur (family Lepilemuridae) [38]. Interestingly,
the former position shows conflict between loci since

three of them strongly support the classical view of a sistership of Propithecus and lemurids. Furthermore, the
authors of this analysis note possible taxonomic bias in
their analysis since except for Propithecus, no taxa from the
family Indriidae (e.g. Indri and Avahi) have been considered. This added to the limited amount of sequence information used in our study could explain these
discrepancies. In any case, the sequences presented in this
study sustain the sistership between Archaeolemur (and
Hadropithecus) and indriids as the most likely phylogenetic scenario. Consequently, we can now define a true
series of synapomorphies for archaeolemurids, palaeopropithecids, and indriids (collectively, the Indrioidea) at
both the dental and postcranial levels (see Figure 2 and
Additional data file: "Defining a series of synapomorphies
for the Indrioidea clade" for a list of such synapomorphies).
Interestingly, if our molecular data unambiguously link
archaeolemurids to indriids, they do not give insights into

Phylogenetic supports for the nesting of Archaeolemur (and Hadropithecus) within different taxa (Indriidae, Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, Lepilemuridae,
Lorisiformes or the Aye-aye, respectively) are given in the 6 last columns. Bootstrap percentages or Posterior probabilities are given for Likelihood
and Bayesian analyses, respectively. * In this topology, Archaeolemur actually appears as the sister taxon of the aye-aye but both are nested within
paraphyletic indriids. This finding most likely results from a Long Branch Attraction artifact.

the phylogenetic relationships within the Indrioidea, as
ingroup nodes do not receive conclusive bootstrap values
and posterior probabilities (Figure 1A and Table S4, Additional file 1). However, morphological and developmental characters have recently provided unambiguous
support for considering the palaeopropithecids as the sister to the Indriidae (contra treating the Archaeolemuridae
as the sister to the Indriidae) (Figure 2; see Additional data
file: "Phylogenetics relationships within Indrioidea" for
in-depth discussion). For this reason, this is our preferred
phylogeny.

Discussion
The idea that the Archaeolemuridae, Palaeopropithecidae
and Indriidae comprise a clade within the Lemuriformes
is not new. Indeed, affinities of Archaeolemur to indriines
were recognized by Lorenz von Liburnau in 1900 when he
named "Protoindris globiceps" on the basis of a photograph
of a skull (later synonymized with Archaeolemur majori)
that had been collected by Franz Sikora in 1899 at Andrahomana Cave in southeastern Madagascar [39]. Standing
(1908) treated Archaeolemur as an indriid [40], and G. E.
Smith (1908) discussed the indriid character of its brain

[41]. Since that time, craniodental studies have consistently recognized the phylogenetic affinity of Indrioidea
and their separation from other lemurs. Often, the three
families are treated as subfamilies within the family Indriidae, which in turn is placed within the Lemuroidea. In
their review of the craniodental evidence, Tattersall and
Schwartz (1974) came to the same conclusion [25]. However, they and other researchers since have recognized that
the clade as a whole is not supported by a large number of
morphological traits, and that different suites of morphological traits might be used to defend very different phylogenetic hypotheses. Moreover King et al. (2001)
examined the sequence of fusion of postcranial epiphyses,
dental eruption, and closure of cranial sutures in Archaeolemur and two living lemurs (Propithecus and Eulemur) in
an effort to evaluate functional and phylogenetic implications of developmental data [26]. These authors noted
that the sequence data failed to demonstrate similarities
of Archaeolemur to Propithecus, but rather showed greater
likeness to Eulemur. In addition, studies of recently-found
carpal elements of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeolemur, and
Hadropithecus have demonstrated greater likenesses of the
archaeolemurids to lemurids [22,27,28,42].

Model for the evolution indrioids, modified from Godfrey (1988).
Given that the Archaeolemuridae-Lemuridae sistership is
not supported by our molecular data, one interpretation
is that the lemurid-likenesses of the Archaeolemuridae are
primitive (symplesiomorphic) for indriids, palaeopropithecids, archaeolemurids, and lemurids. Another is that
they represent convergences of archaeolemurids and
lemurids due to shared quadrupedalism, although this
cannot account for developmental likenesses. Godfrey
(1988) reconstructed the common ancestor of the Indrioidea as a versatile and probably arboroterrestrial quadruped with limb proportions and a positional repertory not
very different from those of the lemurids, Varecia or Pachylemur [14]. Such a scenario (Figure 2) would explain the
manual similarities of the Archaeolemuridae and the
Lemuridae. This author also reconstructed the common
ancestor of the indriids and palaeopropithecids as a generalized quadrupedal climber/hanger, with striking
synapomorphies of the upper limb, hands, and feet.
According to this interpretation, an initial split divided

the Indrioidea into two clades, one of which (the Archaeolemuridae) specialized in terrestrial quadrupedalism
while the other (the palaeopropithecid-indriid clade) specialized in slow quadrupedal climbing and hanging. The
latter subsequently split into two clades, one of which
(the Palaeopropithecidae) sacrificed rapid locomotion of
any sort to perfect deliberate hanging skills, the other of
which (the Indriidae) sacrificed quadrupedalism to
develop a new form of 'vertical clinging and leaping' while
retaining sloth-like hanging skills.
This unique combination of locomotor/postural features
and dental adaptations in archaeolemurids is probably
the reason why their phylogenetic status has been so difficult to decipher. This study demonstrates the value of the
ancient DNA approach in solving the phylogenetic relationships among extinct and extant taxa, especially in situations involving rampant morphological homoplasy,

morphological plasticity with rapid change in body size
[43,44], or sexual dimorphism [45,46].

Conclusion
We have been successful in amplifying and sequencing
the first ancient DNA sequences of all the members of an
enigmatic lemur family: the archaeolemurids (genera
Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus). These 'giant lemurs'
lived in Madagascar centuries ago but have been led to
extinction by human activities. Our new sequences solve
the phylogenetic position of archaeolemurids as close relatives of both the sloth lemurs and the indriids. This
appears in sharp contrast with most recent ontogenetic
studies as well as new discoveries of postcranial elements
of the archaeolemurids that indicate striking similarities
with lemurids. In light of our new phylogenetic framework, we were able to reinterpret the available cranial and
postcranial data. Our data offer support for a particular
scenario of the evolution of the Indrioidea locomotor
apparatus (starting from arboroterrestrial ancestors that
specialized in either terrestrial quadrupedalism or arboreal skills).

Methods
Ancient DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
A total of 10 samples of subfossil lemurs belonging to the
genera Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus were subjected to
ancient DNA extraction (Table 1). These cover all the species currently allied to Archaeolemuridae. Furthermore,
two subfossils of the extinct lemur Megaladapis edwardsi
were also included in the analysis in order to compare the
sequences retrieved with the sequences already reported
by other laboratories [18,31]. DNA was extracted and
amplified as previously described elsewhere [47,48],
using appropriate ancient DNA techniques and respective
of the most scrupulous ancient DNA authentication criteria [49]. Briefly, mock extractions and the three different
amplification controls described in Loreille et al. (2001)
[50] were included in each analysis to detect possible contamination. Only one lemur sample was extracted per
extraction session to limit possible cross-contamination
between specimens. All PCR reactions were conducted in
a total volume of 25–100 μl using 2.5–10 units of Taq
Gold (Perkin-Elmer®) together with 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/
ml BSA, 250 μM of each dNTP and 0,5–1 μM of the different primers listed in Table S1, Additional file 1. A 5–10
min activation step at 92–94°C was followed by 50–60
cycles of denaturation (92–94°C, 45–60s), annealing
(44–50°C, 45–60s), extension (72°C, 45s) and a last
extension step at 72°C (5–10 min). Primers (Table S1,
Additional file 1) were designed to target overlapping
DNA fragments of 80–200 bp among 3 different mtDNA
genes (control region, cytochrome b and 12S rRNA) and
one nuclear gene (IRBP). No specimen or DNA extract
from modern lemurs was ever introduced in the laborato-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/121

ries. PCR products were cloned using the Topo TA cloning
kit (Invitrogen®) following the manufacturer instructions.
Colonies positive for insertion were screened by PCR into
a 12 μl reaction mix using universal M13 (5'-GTT TTC
CCA GTC ACG ACG TTG) and REV (5'-TTT CAC ACA
GGA AAC AGC TAT) primers and 35–45 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30s), annealing (55°C, 30s) and elongation (72°C, 45s). PCR products were further sequenced by
a service provider (Cogenics®). For each DNA fragment,
the final sequence was deduced from the consensus of all
clone sequences obtained from at least two independent
PCR products. Such an approach is generally taken for discarding possible artifactual substitutions induced by DNA
damage [51]. A total number of 75 PCR products and 399
clones were analyzed (Table S2, Additional file 1). For
cytochrome b, no prematurate stop-codon is observed in
the coding-phase of each of the final consensus. Finally,
the sample CH146 (Archaeolemur majori) was independently extracted, amplified and analysed in two different
ancient DNA laboratories. It yielded identical consensus
cytochrome b sequences.
Datasets
The new sequences reported in this manuscript were
deposited in Genbank under Accession numbers
EU441938–EU441943. All available sequences of extinct
and extant Strepsirrhini were retrieved from Genbank and
aligned using ClustalW. In order to investigate possible
artifacts due to stochastic or systematic errors, 12 different
datasets were constituted. Dataset composition is provided in the Additional data file.
Phylogenetic analyses
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo phylogenies were
generated using MrBayes 3.12 [52] under a GTR model of
evolution assuming a fraction of invariant sites and rate
heterogeneity across sites. Two sets of four chains sampled
every 100 generations were run until the average standard
deviation of split frequencies between the two sets fell
below the default critical value of 0.01 using a burn-in
fraction of 25%. Bayesian posterior probabilities were
finally recorded even if their significance, in term of
robustness, remains an open question (e.g. [53]). For each
dataset, the best-fitting model of substitution was then
determined using Modeltest [54] following AIC criterion
[55]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees were then built
with Phyml [56]. The strength of the phylogenetic signal
was assessed via non-parametric bootstrapping [57]
among 200 pseudo replicates. For datasets #10–12, we
analyzed either both genes under the same (Likelihood
and Bayesian, respectively) or independent (Bayesian partitioned) model parameters (Tables 2 & S4, Additional file
1). Statistical supports for different a priori selected
hypotheses were assessed via the Approximately Unbiased
