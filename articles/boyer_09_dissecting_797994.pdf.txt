Abstract
Background: The availability of hundreds of bacterial genomes allowed a comparative genomic
study of the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), recently discovered as being involved in
pathogenesis. By combining comparative and phylogenetic approaches using more than 500
prokaryotic genomes, we characterized the global T6SS genetic structure in terms of conservation,
evolution and genomic organization.
Results: This genome wide analysis allowed the identification of a set of 13 proteins constituting
the T6SS protein core and a set of conserved accessory proteins. 176 T6SS loci (encompassing 92
different bacteria) were identified and their comparison revealed that T6SS-encoded genes have a
specific conserved genetic organization. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the core genes
showed that lateral transfer of the T6SS is probably its major way of dissemination among
pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the sequence analysis of the VgrG proteins,
proposed to be exported in a T6SS-dependent way, confirmed that some C-terminal regions
possess domains showing similarities with adhesins or proteins with enzymatic functions.
Conclusion: The core of T6SS is composed of 13 proteins, conserved in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria. Subclasses of T6SS differ in regulatory and accessory protein content
suggesting that T6SS has evolved to adapt to various microenvironments and specialized functions.
Based on these results, new functional hypotheses concerning the assembly and function of T6SS
proteins are proposed.

Background
Complex interactions between Gram-negative bacteria
and their environment are facilitated by numerous sur-

face-attached and exported macromolecules, some of
which represent bacterial toxins and effectors. In order to
cross two bacterial membranes, those molecules are trans-

ported by nanomachineries, called secretion systems,
which may be more or less complex in terms of their composition and regulation. Up to recently, five distinct secretion systems have been identified in Gram-negative
bacteria [1,2]. In 2006, two groups presented evidences
on the existence of a novel secretion system in Vibrio cholerae [3] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4], and named it the
Type VI Secretion System (T6SS).
Both systems export the Hcp (Haemolysin-Coregulated
Protein) and presumably a class of proteins named Vgr
(Val-Gly Repeats), whose exact function is still speculative. In V. cholerae, three Vgrs (VgrG1-3) are encoded in
the genome, and are exported in a T6SS-dependent way.
All N-terminal domains of Vgr proteins show strong
homology with bacteriophage T4 proteins gp27 and gp5,
which are constituents of phage baseplate [5], and are able
to co-associate [6]. On the contrary, the C-terminal
domains are Vgr-specific and some of them seem to carry
an "activity" function, as illustrated by V. cholerae VgrG1
which can cross-link cellular actin [6].
The genes encoding T6SS have been reported a few years
ago as being present in different bacterial species,
although it was not clear at that time whether those genes
act together or are important in bacteria-host interactions
[7]. Recent reports demonstrated the importance of T6SS
in pathogenesis of several bacterial species. Burkholderia
mallei uses T6SS to proliferate in macrophages and an
Hcp-related protein is produced in vivo during infection of
model animals [8]. The fish pathogen Edwardsiella tarda
has an active T6SS [9]. Hcp1 of P. aeruginosa is actively
secreted by clinical isolates and cystic fibrosis patients
develop antibodies against Hcp, demonstrating that the
system is active during infection [4]. In addition to Vgr
and Hcp proteins, the actual hallmark of this novel system
is the presence of an AAA+ Clp-like ATPase and of two
additional genes icmF and dotU, encoding homologs of
T4SS stabilising proteins [10].
As in the case of the majority of virulence factors, the
expression of T6SS is tightly controlled either at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. One of the four T6SS
encoded in the genome of B. mallei, found to be required
for virulence in the hamster model of infection, is under
the control of the VirAG two-component system and an
AraC-type regulator [8]. The expression of the T6SS of Burkholderia cenocepacia and P. aeruginosa is regulated by a
similar sensor kinase containing seven transmembrane
domains and belonging to the 7TMR-DISMED (7 TransMembrane Receptors with Divers Intracellular Signalling
Modules) protein family [11]. Finally, the activity of T6SS
of P. aeruginosa is regulated by a Ser/Thr kinase and phosphatase able to act on the FHA (Fork Head Associated)containing component of the machinery [12].

All together, these findings provide strong evidence that
the T6SS is important for bacterial pathogenesis. However, as a new secretion system, little information is available about the structural and the genomic organization of
the T6SS apparatus considering the vast amount of microbial genomic data available. The first in silico study, carried
out in 2003, reported the presence of 27 homologs of
icmF gene within 16 bacterial genomes belonging to the
Gram-negative Proteobacteria division [13]. In that study,
the phylogenetic analysis performed on three proteins
(IcmF, ClpV1 and DotU) from the IAHP (IcmF Associated
Homologous Proteins) cluster suggested that some bacteria acquired this cluster by lateral transfer. This was further
confirmed through a phylogenetic analysis of two other
conserved protein sequences (IglA/B) [14]. Recently, a
similar study based on ortholog search and focused on
functional annotation [15] detected T6SS in 42 pathogenic proteobacteria. However, the approach that was
employed could not detect if there are more than one
T6SS per genome. Thus, in order to investigate thoroughly
T6SS regarding its phylogenetic distribution, gene content, organization and evolution we undertook a largescale genome screening approach by designing an in silico
strategy using more than 500 available bacterial genomes.
Finally, some specific topics are discussed, such as the
VgrG protein family and their potential role in host-pathogen interaction.

Results and Discussion
Conserved T6SS primary core building and genome wide
scanning
First, a list of the 16 conserved genes encoded in T6SS gene
clusters demonstrated to be functional in virulence have
been manually established (Table 1 and Figure 1). They
are characterized by 16 different COGs (Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins, defined in [16]). Thus, each
COG (listed in Table 1) was used as a bait to retrieve
potential T6SS encoding regions from the 506 complete
genomic sequences of the Genome Reviews Repository
(September 2007, see Materials and methods §1). The
retrieved genomic regions are referred later in the text as
T6SS encoding regions or T6SS loci. We were able to identify
176 different loci from 92 different bacteria.

Each selected locus contained at least five genes predicted
to encode proteins showing significant similarities (evalue ≤ 10-6) with the list of the 16 bait COGs. In order to
estimate the degree of conservation of each COG in T6SS,
we counted the number of loci where the COG was
detected. A group of 13 COGs with frequency higher than
70% is clearly identified (Figure 2, these 13 COGs are
marked with an asterisk in Table 1). All of these COGs
were previously identified in the eight experimentally
characterized T6SS, except the COG3157 which corre-

To estimate the ability of these 13 COGs to specifically
predict T6SS, we investigated their phylogenetic distribution. Eleven COGs are found only in organisms where at
least one T6SS locus has been predicted. Therefore, they

appear specific to this secretion system. Among the two
remaining COGs, COG3501 shows a clear correlation
with T6SS associated organisms but is also present in
other groups of bacteria including bacteroides (anaerobic
gram-negative bacteria). On the contrary, COG0542
('ATPases with chaperone activity') is clearly not specific
to T6SS and picks up different sub-families of bacterial
ATPases. A previous phylogenetic tree constructed by
Schlieker et al., which includes homologs of ClpB and
ClpV ATPases, discriminates clearly the two subfamilies
[17]. However, the COG0542 is not specific enough to
perform this discrimination.
T6SS taxonomic distribution
The taxonomic distribution of T6SS was deduced from the
phyla associated to the different bacteria harbouring at
least one T6SS gene cluster. All but two of the bacterial
species (Rhodopirellula baltica and Solibacter usitatus)
belong to Proteobacteria, in agreement with results published recently [14]. It is noteworthy, that among the 13
epsilon proteobacteria genomes, only Helicobacter hepaticus presents a unique predicted T6SS. In addition, this
cluster seems to have been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer (see below section 4). Therefore, it appears that
T6SS is mainly found in Proteobacteria, except in the epsilon sub-group. The rarity of T6SS in the epsilon sub-group
may be due to specific traits of this later group as it

branches at the root of the proteobacterial phylogenetic
tree [18].
Description and functional association of most conserved
T6SS components
Among the 13 most conserved proteins, IcmF and DotU
(COG3523 and COG3455) have firstly been studied in
the context of T4SS secretion and have been shown to be
necessary for efficient T4SS-dependent secretion. IcmF
homologs are predicted to have three transmembrane helices hence most probably associated with bacterial membranes. Both proteins have been shown to be required for
T4SS apparatus stabilization in Legionella pneumophilla
[10].

The ClpV homologs (COG0542) belong to a sub type of
ATPAse AAA+ family, being specific to T6SS gene clusters
[17]. This group lacks the disaggregating function found
in the ClpB type, but it is still able to take part into translocation processes. Therefore, it has been proposed that
ClpV proteins provide energy to the protein secretion
process [17]. Indeed, ClpV is essential for a T6SS function
[19].
In Francisella, IglA and IglB (COG3516 and COG3517)
are cytoplasmic proteins which interact directly and are
required for intracellular growth in macrophages [20].
The authors propose that the IglAB complex plays a role
of chaperone-like proteins involved in secretion pathway
of virulence factors. Indeed, homologous proteins in
Vibrio, named VipA et VipB, form complexes and interact
with ClpV [19].
VgrG and Hcp proteins, both identified as conserved in
T6SS loci, have been found in culture supernatant in T6SS
dependent manner, in various organisms. However, it is
still an ongoing debate whether these two proteins are
constituents of the T6SS apparatus or are involved in
translocation into host cell or are toxic per se. Besides,
Pukatzki and co-workers hypothesized that three VgrG
proteins assemble into a membrane-penetrating device
whose structure is analogous to the bacteriophage T4 tail
spike complex. Indeed, VgrGs seem to be a fusion of
phage tail proteins gp27 and gp5 [6]. Interestingly,
another protein (COG3518), present in most of the analyzed loci, shows weak similarities to a second bacteriophage T4 protein (PFAM: 'GPW/gp25 family protein',
putative lysozyme). The quaternary structure of the bacteriophage T4 baseplate suggests that gp25 and gp27 are in
close proximity in the baseplate and may physically interact [5]. However, in Edwardsiella tarda, yeast two-hybrid
experiments do not detect any interaction between EvpI
(VgrG homolog) and EvpE (COG3518). Although, the
ΔevpE mutant shows defect in the secretion of EvpC (Hcp
homolog), EvpE itself does not appear to be secreted [9].

Figure 3
T6SS consensual genomic organization
T6SS consensual genomic organization. COGs are
depicted as arrows. The colour scheme is as on Figure 1.
When the order and the transcriptional orientation of two
genes are conserved, the two corresponding COGs are
linked. The more the genomic organization is conserved, the
bolder the connectors. The percentages correspond to the
link conservation frequencies. They were computed on the
basis of all identified T6SS gene clusters except clusters
encoded from closely related bacterial strains.

To further characterize functional links that may exist
between T6SS components, we decided to focus on the
conserved genomic organization, as it often suggests cotranslation and/or protein-protein interactions [21]. The
genomic organization among T6SS loci was investigated
by computing the number of loci in which every pair of
COGs could potentially be co-transcribed (i.e. two COGs
are encoded in tandem and co-oriented). As shown on
Figure 3, it clearly appears that T6SS gene clusters are
strongly biased in their organization suggesting that these
13 proteins are part of a small-scale network of physical
and functional interactions. From this analysis, three
groups of conserved organization can be clearly delineated:
• COG3516 (IglA), COG3517 (IglB) and COG3157
(Hcp). As mentioned previously, the complex IglAB may
play a role of chaperone-like proteins involved in secretion pathway.
• COG3521 ('Putative prokaryote lipoprotein'),
COG3522 (unknown function), COG3455 (DotU
homologs) and COG3523 (IcmF homologs). Sequence
analyses performed on those proteins reveal: i) a predicted signal peptide in 86% of the sequences associated
to COG3521, ii) one predicted transmembrane helix but
no signal peptide in 87% of the DotU sequences, iii) three
transmembrane helices in 63% of the IcmF sequences
(84% have at least one predicted transmembrane helix)
and iv) no signal peptide or transmembrane segment in
all COG3522 sequences. The results obtained on DotU
and IcmF proteins are in accordance with experiments
conducted in the context of T4SS. Moreover, recent experiments in E. coli have confirmed the lipoprotein function

different loci. Then, the trees were compared in order to
decide whether or not they can be considered as the result
of a single evolutionary scenario, i.e., if the core genes we
identified co-evolved and have been transmitted (by horizontal transfer or not) as a single functional unit. The
similarities between the trees were computed using
TOPD/FMTS [23] with the split distance (see Materials
and methods §5). A hierarchical classification was applied
on these distances. It suggests that the set of trees is
homogenous as it is not possible to clearly identify different groups of trees in the resulting dendrogram [see Additional file 1]. Nevertheless, among the 13 trees, the ones
associated to Hcp (COG3157), VgrG (COG3501),
COG3521 (lipoprotein) and another protein of unknown
function (COG3522) show the greatest distances to the
other trees. As these four trees correspond to proteins
either secreted (VgrG and Hcp) or exposed to the cell surface (COG3521), their relative differences may be
explained by a higher rate of mutation probably due to
their direct interaction with environment or host cells. We
thus decided to discard them for further computations.
Using the weighted MRP method [24], we combined these
trees to reconstruct a super-tree that would reflect a consensual scenario of T6SS evolution (Figure 4 &5). Besides
being acknowledge to give accurate results [25], the
weighted MRP method also offers the possibility to integrate in a unique tree all loci, even if they share only a few
common genes.
In the super-tree, each leaf corresponds to one of the 176
T6SS loci. First, the clusters of loci obtained on the tree
were analyzed in terms of COG contents. We have defined
five sub-groups (Figure 4 &5) according to the tree topology and the presence or absence of conserved accessory
proteins. The four T6SS groups proposed by Bingle and
co-workers (based on concatenated sequences of IglA and
IglB for only 37 loci) have been placed on the super-tree
[14]. The loci corresponding to these four groups belong
to four different clusters on the tree. Therefore, the two
classification obtained through different approaches are
in agreement. However, we demonstrated here that it
extends to the 13 core genes that can then be considered
as one single functional unit. The analysis of our resulting
tree can also give more insights regarding T6SS evolution.
From the tree topology and the gene content of each
locus, we can infer that some T6SS have been split into
two different loci after their acquisition by the bacteria.
Indeed, both loci are clustered on the tree and their gene
contents are complementary, forming a complete T6SS
[Geobacter sulfurreducens (AE017180A-AE017180C)
and metallireducens (CP000148A-CP000148D), Xanthomonas axonopodis (AE008923B-AE008923C) and
campestris (AM0399952C-AM039952D), Yersinia pestis
(CP000308F-CP000308A)]. As the two split loci found in
Hahella chejuensis localized distantly on the tree and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/104

belong to two different sub-groups (III and V), they
should have been acquired through two independent
events followed by gene lost. On the other hand, leaf clustering can also reveal recent duplications of T6SS gene
clusters. We can detect two such events, one in Pseudomonas putida (AE015451C-AE015451F) and the other
in the common ancestor of Yersinia pestis and Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis
(CP000308B-CP000308C
and
BX936398B-BX936398D). In both cases, gene lost in one
of the duplicated cluster is observed. The tree also highlights a large fraction of organisms that possess multiple
T6SS gene clusters (T6SS copy numbers are listed in a supplementary table [see Additional file 2]). Some of these
clusters are either incomplete or with different gene contents. The most striking examples come from the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia pestis and Burkholderia
pseudomallei that encode up to six T6SS gene clusters. The
distant location on the tree of the different loci suggests
that these duplication events are not recent. Given that
these copies are ancient, belong to different sub-groups,
and have been fixed, we can make the hypothesis that they
may have specialized into specific functions.
Furthermore, a strong correlation between the loci gene
content and some subtrees can be observed. COG0515,
COG0631, COG1360, COG3456, COG3913 and
COG4455 cluster together in different sub-trees. Interestingly, three of these COGs correspond to proteins
involved in the post-translational regulation mechanism
of the T6SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12]: PpkA (a Thr/
Ser kinase, COG0515), PppA (a phosphatase, COG0631),
and Fha1 (a protein containing a fork-head motif,
COG3456). Except in sub-group I, the correlation is even
more pronounced between COG3913 and Fha1
(COG3456), which may indicate a functional role of
COG3913 in the PpkA/PppA/Fha regulatory pathway. The
association between COG1360 ('MotB, flagellar motor
protein') and Fha1 (COG3456) has already been reported
in a gene co-occurrence/gene neighbourhood study [26].
However, in our case, this association is not always strictly
observed.
The sub-groups II and IV can be characterized by the cooccurrence of two COGs: COG2885 ('Outer membrane
protein and related peptidoglycan-associated (lipo)proteins') and COG4253 ('uncharacterized protein conserved'). As the domain encoded by COG4253 appears
fused with the N-terminal domain of a sub-group of VgrG
proteins (see below), the observed correlation could
reflect a possible interaction between the COG2885 protein and VgrG through the COG4253 domain. A putative
role of this interaction could be the modulation of the
VgrG function (secretion or translocation and virulence).

To further explore the specificities of sub-trees in terms of
sequence conservation, we compared our tree with a clustering obtained on the proteins by applying the TribeMCL
strategy [27] which is based only on sequence similarities
(see Materials and methods §4). This alternative approach
is mainly useful to correlate some of the sub-trees with the
presence of specific COGs: COG3456 (Fha1), COG3515,
COG3518, COG3520, COG3521. Moreover, another
important feature revealed by the TribeMCL clustering is
the definition of a small sequence cluster whose members
are mainly associated to COG2204 ('Response regulator
containing CheY-like receiver, AAA-type ATPase, and
DNA-binding domains') [see Additional file 3]. Loci
belonging to that cluster are mainly found in the previously defined sub-group I (Figure 4) that contains the V.
cholera locus whose regulation does not depend of the
PpkA/PppA/Fha mechanism described for P. aeruginosa
[12]. The COG2204 member of the V. cholerae locus corresponds to the sigma 54 activator [3], which is conserved
in Aeromonas hydrophila and has been shown to be necessary for T6SS expression in that organism[28].
All together, these observations suggest that i) the genes
whose products are involved in the assembly of the putative secretion apparatus are well conserved through evolution, and ii) the bacteria evolved different regulatory
components for the expression of those genes probably
for specific bacterial adaptation to its host and/or niche.
Regarding the deep branches of our tree, no common
topology can be found with the bacterial taxonomy, some
sub-trees appearing more correlated with ecological
niches, as illustrated for marine bacteria (Figure 5, group
V), plant pathogens/symbionts (Figure 5, group IV) or
animal pathogens. In addition, many observations favour
the hypothesis that T6SS may be acquired by horizontal
transfer as they belong to genomic islands gained by such
a mechanism. This has been reported for: i) Helicobacter
hepaticus where the T6SS gene cluster belongs to the large
HHGI1 genomic island that has been shown to be
required for the induction of liver disease [29], ii) Photobacterium profundum where the genes coding for T6SS are
found in region chr1.3 which is probably horizontally
acquired and absent from strain 3TCK of P. profundum
[30], iii) the uropathogenic Escherichia coli O6 strain
UPEC/O6:H1/ATCC 700928/CFT073, where one of the
two T6SS gene clusters is encoded in the genomic island
PAI-CFT073-metV [31], and iv) the enterohaemorrhagic
E. coli O157:H7 where it is located in the genomic island
OI#7 [32] whereas no T6SS footprint was found in the
non pathogenic E. coli K12.
Is FPI a true T6SS?
In two recent papers, Nano and coworkers [20,33] argued
that the FPI (Francisella pathogenicity island) locus might

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/104

encode a T6SS. IglA and IglB were shown to interact, and
IglA was found as crucial for intracellular growth of Francisella. The same authors also identified an FPI encoded
protein that presents similarity to members of the DotU
protein family and another FPI encoded protein with a
part of the conserved domain associated with the IcmF
protein family. Intriguingly, the phylogenetic analysis of
Bingle and coworkers [14], based exclusively on IglA and
IglB sequences, showed that Francisella sequences clustered together in a deep branch of the tree, and our
approach did not identify any T6SS locus in Francisella. In
order to investigate this discrepancy, each gene product of
the FPI was used as query with the psiblast program
against the NCBI non-redundant protein databank. For
each protein, functional domain detection was achieved
through an rpsblast search [34] against the COG database.
The complete results are summarized in a supplementary
Table [see Additional file 4]. Ten out of the 18 proteins
show no similarity with any sequence of the databank,
except with FPI encoded proteins from other strains of
Francisella. Among the remaining proteins, only three
exhibit significant sequence similarities to T6SS core
genes: IglA, IglB and PigF, an homolog of MotB/OmpA/
DotU. We also confirmed that the PdpB sequence presents
a similarity in its C-terminal region with the C-terminal
fragment of the COG3523 (IcmF). We were unable to find
any protein showing significant similarity with the T6SS
dependent secreted protein, neither Hcp nor Vgr in all
available Francisella genomes.
These results suggest that the FPI would not encode a T6SS
similar to the recently described T6SS but may rather
encode another system implied in bacterial virulence that
shares some components with both T6SS and T4SS.
Ongoing functional and structural studies on orphan proteins encoded in the FPI (like the recently resolved structure of IglC [35]), and the determination of the
macromolecular complex encoded by this island should
help to better classify and understand this putative secretion system.
Focus on VgrG proteins
In addition to secreted Hcp whose function is still unclear,
T6SS export a class of VgrG proteins. VgrG proteins have
been proposed to bind/puncture target eukaryotic cells in
order to deliver effector domains encoded within their Cterminal regions [6]. To further examine this hypothesis,
we looked for conserved features and/or domains in the
C-terminal regions of the VgrG proteins identified in all
the T6SS loci reported above.

Full length T6SS encoded VgrG proteins were selected
according to the rpsblast analysis performed previously
(see Materials and methods §1): only proteins showing an
alignment covering at least 80% of the COG3501 PSSM

Page 9 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:104

with an E-value ≤ 10-6 were retained. We ended up with a
set of 180 proteins with length ranging from 529 to 1207
amino acids. As previously reported and suggested by
their nomenclature Val-Gly-Repeats [36], the VgrG proteins were already known for containing repeats in their
C-terminal part. Systematic search for short length amino
acid tandem repeats in C-terminal regions identified 31
VgrG sequences having such repeats [see Additional file
5]. Their sequences were compared both at the DNA and
amino acid levels. When reported on the super-tree built
on the T6SS loci, these proteins belongs to two distinct
groups, except for two of them (one from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one from Bordetella bronchiseptica) that
remained un-clustered [see Additional file 6]. The first
group is characterized by VgrG sequences whose repeats
are highly conserved both at the protein and DNA levels,
implying that they are recent. The second group corresponds to VgrG repeats that are no more detectable at the
DNA level, but with a period and some amino acids
strongly conserved at specific positions, suggesting that a
selective pressure is acting in order to keep these repeated
motifs functional. The VgrG sequences belonging to the
two un-clustered loci present the same characteristics than
the ones of the second group. All the species harbouring
such VgrG proteins are animal pathogens. It strongly suggests that these repeats may be involved in virulence.
In the 149 remaining proteins, an rpsblast search was performed on their C-terminal regions and hits with an Evalue ≤ 10-3 were retained. Similarity with the COG3409
('Putative peptidoglycan-binding domain-containing protein'), already reported for VC_A0123 of V. Cholera [6],
was not found in other VgrG proteins. On the other hand,
we found significant similarities between the COG4253
('unknown function') and the C-terminal regions of fifty
VgrG proteins, all issued from beta or gamma Proteobacteria. Among them, the two sequences from the two Burkholderia cenocepacia available strains present a partial
additional hit in their C-terminal part with the COG3846
(TrbL/VirB6), known to be a component of the T4SS. The
C-terminal regions of the remaining 98 VgrG proteins do
not contain any identified conserved domain, but share,
for some of them, sequence similarities. Therefore, it
appears that the VgrG proteins found in T6SS loci are
mainly characterized by the presence, in their C-terminal
part, of either repeats or COG4253 functional domain.
Indeed, more than one third of the VgrG proteins possess
one of these two features. These two domains have been
predicted by Pukatzki and coworkers as being structurally
similar to putative adhesive molecules fibronectin-, YidB, YadA- or tropomyosin-like [6]. A detailed manual
sequence comparison of eight VgrG proteins listed in their
publication showed that four of them contained either
repeats or COG4253 at their C-terminal ends.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/104

In conclusion, as VgrG proteins are suspected to be in contact with host cells, these C-terminal domains (repeats
and COG4253) may be involved in host cell adhesion or
virulence. However, their role in secretion, translocation
or virulence needs to be experimentally documented.

Conclusion
Our screening approach has revealed the presence of complete T6SS gene clusters in more than 80 bacterial
genomes. Despite the increasing number of sequenced
genomes, this secretion system appears to be confined to
Proteobacteria. We have clearly identified a core of 13
genes highly conserved and specific of T6SS. Through a
phylogenetic reconstruction of the T6SS loci and the analysis of phylogenetic profiles, subtypes of T6SS have been
defined. They appear to have evolved different regulatory
mechanisms necessary for bacterial adaptation to specific
environments and/or hosts.
The comparative genomic approach highlights a highly
conserved genomic organization of three groups of genes
among the 13 core T6SS genes, and suggests that the proteins they encode may physically interact or form functionally important complexes. The first group (COG3521,
COG3522, COG3455 and COG3523) might constitute
the membrane component of the basal secretion apparatus. The second group, composed of COG3516 (IglA),
COG3517 (IglB) and COG3157 (Hcp), may direct a more
efficient processing of unfolded proteins – in particular
unfolded and unassembled Hcp proteins – by the chaperon-like proteins IglA-IglB. Indeed, the last group contains three proteins (COG3518, COG3519 and
COG3520) of unknown function that have been proposed to be part of the secretion apparatus [9]. One of its
members (COG3518) has similarities with the phage
gp25 protein. It has been suggested that gp25 and gp27
are in close proximity in the baseplate and may physically
interact [4]. As the N-terminal domain of VgrG is similar
to gp27, both domains may also interact in T6SS.
Among the 13 core proteins, the secreted VgrG proteins
are suspected to carry effector domains at their C-terminal
end. We found that VgrG proteins are mainly characterized by the presence of repeats or of the functional
domain COG4253 of unknown function that have been
suggested to promotes adhesion to host cell [6].
One striking feature of this secretion system is that multiple copies of almost complete loci are found in about one
third of the genomes harbouring such a system. Our phylogenic tree reveals that they do not result from recent
duplication events and have been conserved through evolution, suggesting a sustained and constrained mechanism that favoured this trend. On one hand, the high
number of T6SS gene clusters found in various pathogenic

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:104

bacteria (Burkholderia, Yersinia, Pseudomonas) may be
explained by a specialization of the secretion system by
means of regulatory mechanisms and targets. On the
other hand, the presence of T6SS clusters in non-pathogenic bacteria suggests that T6SS involvement is not limited to virulence, but that it may also be implicated in
functions such as host/symbiont communication,
exchange and cell-cell communication. For instance, in
Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, the knock-out of T6SS genes
display a strong phenotype on colony growth depending
on various carbon sources, suggesting a putative role of
T6SS in a cascade of events leading, when not functional,
to membrane or cell adhesion disorders [37].
No consensual model for the assembly of the Type VI
Secretion machinery has emerged yet ([38,39]). These
divergences emphasize the need for further experiments
to get a better characterization of each T6SS components
as well as defining the protein complexes building up the
system. Our results bring new functional hypothesis that
could be tested experimentally and enrich our knowledge
on this poorly understood secretion system.

Methods
Building T6SS protein coding gene core
Protein sequences from genomic fragments listed in Table
1 were extracted and aligned against the Position Scoring
Specific Matrices (PSSMs) of the COG section [16] from
the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) [40]. Alignments were performed with the rpsblast program and each
of them was manually checked to assess their consistency.

The genomic fragments and their annotations were either
downloaded from the EMBL nucleotide databank (for
Rhizobium leguminosarum, Edwardsiella tarda and Salmonella enterica) or extracted from the Genome Reviews files
when the complete genome was available (Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Burkholderia mallei and Aeromonas hydrophila). File identifiers
and genomic locations are reported in Table 1.
Genome wide mapping of T6SS
Annotated genomes were downloaded from the Genome
Reviews [41] ftp site (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/
genome_reviews/, September 2007, 461 bacterial
genomes, 40 archaeal genomes and 5 eukaryotic genomes
for a total of 976 replicons). Protein sequences from all
complete annotated genomes were aligned with rpsblast
against the COGs of the CDD. Only proteins showing an
alignment covering at least 80% of the COG PSSM with an
E-value ≤ 10-6 were retained. To avoid any errors in COG
assignments, we discarded all hits that overlap another hit
with a better E-value on more than 50% of its length. To
delineate genomic localization of genes encoding T6SS
components, we clustered contiguous protein coding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/104

genes showing similarity with the COGs listed in Table 1.
Two genes were considered as contiguous if they are separated by less than five non-related T6SS genes. Clusters
containing at least five genes encoding different putative
T6SS proteins (different COGs) were conserved. A threshold of five genes was chosen, as it allows to recover incomplete T6SS without selecting the icmf/dotU region
involved in T4SS in Legionella pneumophila (for a description of type IV-B secretion system see [42]). These first
selected genomic regions were then extended by taking
into account five kilo-bases on each side in order to detect
putative conserved genes not yet known to be associated
with T6SS (description of all identified loci are available
as supplementary material [see Additional file 7]). All
selected proteins were tested for the presence of a signal
peptide and transmembrane helices with SignalP [43] and
TMHMM [44] respectively.
T6SS core gene frequencies and taxonomic distribution
To compute the COG frequencies, all T6SS regions were
assigned the same weight, i.e., a COG present in two different T6SS loci encoded within the same replicon is
counted twice. On the other hand, if a COG was encoded
by more than one gene in a same T6SS locus (in case of
gene duplication for example), it was just counted once
(present/absent). In order to evaluate the taxonomic distribution, we used the phylogenetic classification provided within the genome review files. To avoid any bias
due to redundancy caused by sequencing of different
strains of the same species, only one strain harbouring at
least one predicted T6SS was kept as reference. (strains
containing T6SS loci but not considered in frequency
computations are listed in a supplementary table [see
Additional file 8]).
Phylogenetic profiles
Phylogenetic profiles (PP) were elaborated by two
approaches.

a. In the first approach, the presence of proteins similar to
each previously selected COG is searched in all the
genomes under study. For each COG, a boolean vector is
constructed whose size is equal to the number of T6SS loci
identified previously. Values are either '1' (presence of at
least one occurrence of this COG in the locus) or '0'
(absence of this COG in the locus). This vector defines a
first type of phylogenetic profile.
b. The second approach relies on the TribeMCL strategy
[27]. The procedure starts with all-against-all blastp comparisons of a set of proteins of interest. An E-value cut off
of 10-6 was chosen for retaining similarities. Then, protein
relationships are converted into a graph in which the
nodes represent protein sequences, and the weighted
edges represent their relationships. The weights are com-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:104

puted as the -log10(E-value) of the blastp results for each
pair of sequences. The graph is further processed by a
graph-clustering step called Markov Clustering (MCL
algorithm). An important parameter in the MCL algorithm is the inflation value, regulating the cluster granularity. We set the inflation value at 2. Each protein cluster
is transformed into a boolean vector whose length is equal
to the number of T6SS loci identified previously. For each
locus that encodes a protein belonging to the cluster, the
vector value receives '1' (presence), otherwise it is assigned
to '0' (abscence). This vector corresponds to a second type
of phylogenetic profile.
For both sets of profiles, distances between two PPs were
computed using the Jaccard distance. Mean linkage hierarchical clustering was applied to the distance matrix to
identify clusters of PPs that follow the same locus distribution. Complete results are available as supplementary
material [see Additional file 3].
Phylogenetic tree construction
For each of the 13 most conserved COG groups, one maximum likelihood tree with 100 bootstrap replicates was
built. Sequences were multi-aligned with Muscle [45] and
trees were computed with PhyML [46] using the WAG
amino acid substitution model of evolution [47] and four
categories of substitution rates. Similarities between trees
were computed using TOPD/FMTS with the split distance
(a low split distance value is synonymous of a high
number of common branches between the two trees)
[48]. Mean linkage hierarchical clustering was applied on
these distances in order to check the homogeneity of trees.
The super-tree was built by applying the Weighted Matrix
Representation with Parsimony (W-MRP) method [24].
The W-MRP method creates a matrix whose characters
refer to the topologies of the sources trees. The rows of the
matrix correspond to the leaves (taxa) of input trees and
each column represents one internal branch in one source
tree, so the number of columns of the matrix is equal to
the total number of internal branches across all the source
trees. The method works by examining each internal
branch of each input tree, and assigning a '1' to any taxa
contained within the clade defined by that internal
branch. A '0' is assigned to any taxon present in the source
tree but not included in the clade, and a '?' is assigned to
any taxon absent from the source tree. To consider gene
duplications, '?' is allocated to any taxon whose genes are
found on both sides of the internal branch. For matrix
computation, only internal branches with a boostrap support higher than 50 has been considered. To enhance the
contribution, in the super-tree construction, of the highly
supported branches of source trees, the columns are
weighted as follow: each internal branch is represented by
a number p of columns, with p equal to 1 when the boostrap value is 50 and p is incremented by 1 for each increase
of 10 of the boostrap value. To recover the consensus tree,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/104

the Maximum Parsimony method has been applied with
100 boostrap replicates (phylip package, http://evolu
tion.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).
