Abstract
Background: The rapid evolution of Internet technologies and the collaborative approaches that
dominate the field have stimulated the development of numerous bioinformatics resources. To
address this new framework, several initiatives have tried to organize these services and resources.
In this paper, we present the BioInformatics Resource Inventory (BIRI), a new approach for
automatically discovering and indexing available public bioinformatics resources using information
extracted from the scientific literature. The index generated can be automatically updated by
adding additional manuscripts describing new resources. We have developed web services and
applications to test and validate our approach. It has not been designed to replace current indexes
but to extend their capabilities with richer functionalities.
Results: We developed a web service to provide a set of high-level query primitives to access the
index. The web service can be used by third-party web services or web-based applications. To test
the web service, we created a pilot web application to access a preliminary knowledge base of
resources. We tested our tool using an initial set of 400 abstracts. Almost 90% of the resources
described in the abstracts were correctly classified. More than 500 descriptions of functionalities
were extracted.
Conclusion: These experiments suggest the feasibility of our approach for automatically
discovering and indexing current and future bioinformatics resources. Given the domainindependent characteristics of this tool, it is currently being applied by the authors in other areas,
such as medical nanoinformatics. BIRI is available at http://edelman.dia.fi.upm.es/biri/.

Background
The number of public online bioinformatics resources has
grown exponentially over the past few years. Bioinformatics professionals can access and use a large number of
resources for their research --including databases, tools

and services. Discovering and accessing the appropriate
bioinformatics resource for a specific research task has
become increasingly important, as suggested in earlier
reports [1].

To address this issue, various significant projects and initiatives have been carried out, leading to several pioneering indexes of bioinformatics resources that are currently
available over the Internet. For instance, BioPortal [2] is a
web repository of biomedical ontology resources, developed at the National Center for Biomedical Ontology
(NCBO) [3]. This application enables collaborative development of biomedical ontologies. BioPortal includes a
service called Open Biomedical Resources (OBR) for
annotating and indexing biomedical resources [4].
Resources are annotated using concepts from a domain
ontology. The OBR service enables researchers to locate
resources by specifying ontology concepts.
Other examples of such indexes include the biomedical
database collection compiled by Galperin [5]--a yearly
updated web-based list of molecular biology databases
sorted in alphabetical order-- or the Bioinformatics Links
Directory (BLD) [6,7] --a catalogue of links to bioinformatics resources, tools and databases classified into
eleven major categories-- where resources can be searched
using keyword-based queries.
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) provides a
searchable index of an alphabetically-sorted inventory of
bioinformatics resources [8]. Resources are classified
according to the type of service they provide--databases,
tools and (web) services. The index includes both internal
and external resources.
The BioMoby platform provides an annotated registry of
bioinformatics web services enabling other applications
to integrate and use such services [9,10]. There are various
major installations of BioMoby, such as, for instance, the
PlaNet Consortium [11], the Australian Centre for Plant
Functional Genomics [12], the Generation Challenge Program of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research [13], Genome Canada [14], or the Spanish
National Institute of Bioinformatics (INB) [15]. They provide access to different bioinformatics resources depending on their own interests and needs.
A consortium composed of the seven US National Centers
for Biomedical Computing [16] has recently developed
another index of bioinformatics resources called iTools
[17,18]. Web services are used here to provide access to
resources that are annotated according to their functionality. A web-based interface enables researchers to locate the
resources they need using advanced search and visual navigation tools. Another initiative for organizing bioinformatics resources is the BIO2RDF system [19]. This system
considers the information contained in biological databases, providing uniform access to biological data stored
in public databases. Data is converted into RDF format
using a common reference ontology. More than 20 pub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/320

licly available databases --e.g. Entrez Gene, OMIM, GO,
OBO, PDB, GeneBank, Prosite, etc. -- have been successfully integrated, including more than 160 million RDF
documents.
In this paper we present a tool to automatically create a
searchable index of bioinformatics resources from the scientific literature. The resources are annotated with metadata regarding their functionality. Metadata are extracted
from abstracts of research papers retrieved from PubMed®
[20] and the ISI Web of Knowledge® [21] using patternmatching techniques. The generated index can be incrementally updated by feeding our tool with abstracts of
articles describing new resources. In the evaluation section, we present and analyze some figures that compare
the results of our approach with other existing indexes.

Methods
We extract relevant information about bioinformatics
resources from papers published in high-impact journals.
We focus on manuscript abstracts, which tend to condense the key information. We use classic natural language processing techniques--such as, for instance,
tokenizers, parsers, transition networks or part-of-speech
taggers--to extract this information. These techniques provide the basic framework for extracting data from textual
resources [22]. All the techniques we have used are
detailed in the following sections. The outcome of this
process is an indexed knowledge base including the most
relevant information about the resources.
Building the knowledge base
We propose a five-phase method for automatically generating a knowledge base of bioinformatics resources using
research paper abstracts. Figure 1 shows an overview of
the proposed methodology. Next we detail the five activities.
Abstract selection and generation of abstract surrogates
First we retrieve a collection of papers from well-known
scientific literature web sites. Each paper is then analyzed
to produce a structured surrogate, including the title,
authors, abstract and electronic references to the paper-i.e. the PubMed® Identifier (PMID). The structure of the
surrogate and a complete example is shown within the
"Papers" section in Table 1. Such surrogates simplify the
pattern-matching process. For instance, the title of the
paper usually contains the name of the resources. We use
that knowledge as a heuristic to discard unnecessary
searches in other sections of the manuscripts.
Surrogate pre-processing
Once the surrogates have been generated, the titles and
abstracts are divided into sentences, using strong punctuation marks as sentence delimiters. Then, each sentence is

the knowledge base: i) abstract selection, ii) surrogate pre-processing, iii) information extraction, iv) resource classification and

pre-processed by a lexical analyzer. The analyzer extracts
the words of the sentences using blanks and punctuation
marks as word delimiters. This produces a sorted set of
tokens tagged with lexical annotations. Next, each token is
labelled with its corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tag
using a probabilistic POS-tagger [23]. Stop words--such as
articles, prepositions, etc.--are also filtered during this
process. Finally, a stemming activity is performed to
reduce each token to its root form, thus returning a set of
lexemes tagged with morphological information [24].
Manual generation of patterns and transition networks
To automatically extract information from the abstracts, a
group of five experts with background in different bioinformatics and text mining techniques created a set of linguistic patterns and then analyzed the selected abstracts.
The set of linguistic patterns characterizes the type of
information to be extracted. We used an initial training set
of 100 abstracts of randomly chosen papers from
PubMed®, describing bioinformatics resources--e.g. data-

base and software papers published in the BMC Bioinformatics Journal [25] or application notes from the
Bioinformatics Journal [26]. The selected abstracts were
analyzed to discover and identify three different types of
patterns: i) resource-naming patterns (RNP), ii) functionality patterns (FP), and iii) classification patterns (CP).
RNPs aim to automatically extract the resource names
together with their corresponding URL. Conversely, FPs
aim to extract short textual descriptions of resource functionalities. By contrast, CPs focus on either i) the category
of the resource or ii) its target domain.
A set of categories and domains was defined by the team
of experts based on the taxonomy developed by the Bioinformatics Links Directory. This set includes the key categories of bioinformatics resources--e.g. databases,
annotation services, visualization tools, etc. Each category
is represented by a preferred name, together with a set of
synonyms. Each resource category is linked to a collection
of topics for its target domain(s). For instance, examples

Abstract:

GenePublisher, a system for automatic analysis of data from DNA microarray experiments, has been implemented with a web
interface at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenePublisher. Raw data are uploaded to the server together with a specification of the
data. The server performs normalization, statistical analysis and visualization of the data. The results are run against databases of signal
transduction pathways, metabolic pathways and promoter sequences in order to extract more information. The results of the entire
analysis are summarized in report form and returned to the user.

of domains for the "database" category are "DNA",
"microarray", "polymorphisms" or "protein". Table 2
shows the complete list of BIRI categories and domains.
Once the experts had identified the patterns, they were
translated into Transition Networks (TNs) [27]. TNs are
simple but effective abstract machines that determine
whether a string belongs to a language defined by a regular expression. We adopted this approach since TNs are

simple yet powerful tools suitable for performing patternmatching tasks. In our approach, TNs are used to recognize instances of the patterns in the abstracts. We defined
two different TNs. The first TN is designed to detect and
extract the names of the resources together with brief
descriptions of their functionalities. This TN is based on
the extracted RNPs and FPs. Conversely, the second TN is
designed to classify the resources into different categories
depending on their functionalities and target domains.

Figure 2
Fragment of the transition network to detect resource names
Fragment of the transition network to detect resource names. This is an extract of the transition network used to
identify resource names from the surrogates. According to the inputs (labels over the arcs), the transition network passes
from state 0 to other states until it reaches a final state that determines the identification of a new resource. Different tags are
used as labels: punctuation marks and words within quotes represent literals---i.e. marks or words that are in the surrogates--, and abbreviations in capital letters that represent morphological tags. For instance, NP is a proper noun, CC represents a
conjunction, NN refers to common noun, DT symbolizes a determiner, JJ denotes an adjective, RB is a general adverb, OF and
IN represent prepositions, PDT denotes a determiner, VB represents a verb, VBG refers to a verb in gerund form (ending in ing) or SYM is a symbol or formula.

Figure 2 shows an extract of the first TN. This is represented as a finite state machine. Each state is represented
by a numbered circle. The labelled edges show the
required textual input for transiting from one state to
another. Given an input, the aim is to reach a final state
(for instance, state 9 in Figure 2) from an initial state (for
example, state 0). If a final state is reached, then the TN
outputs the extracted information for the matched
resource.
Information extraction
Extracted patterns are applied to the abstracts as follows.
First, the abstract is analyzed by the first TN to locate the
substrings that match any of the patterns. Then, the relevant information is extracted from the substring. For
instance, the input sentence "The FSSP database of structurally aligned protein fold families" matches the RNP
["The" + Proper Noun + "database" + "of"]. In this case, the
analyzer identifies "FSSP" as a proper noun. Another
example of RNP could be [Proper Noun + ":" + "a"] that
would match the sentence "EMBL-Align: a public nucle-

otide and amino acid multiple sequence database. In this
case, "EMBL-Align" would be recognized as a proper
noun.
FPs are often more complex to match than RNPs and CPs
since their associated patterns require further lexical components for instantiation--e.g. verb tenses, part-of-speech
tags, etc. For instance, the input sentence "A novel method
for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment"
matches the following pattern ["A" + JJ++ "method" + "for"
+ (JJ + (CC + JJ)?)? + JJ* + NN++ "."], where JJ represents
an adjective, CC identifies a conjunction and NN is a common name. We use special characters of regular expressions to specify the patterns, where '?' represents
optionality, '+' one or more occurrences and '*' zero or
more occurrences of the component. In the last example,
the functionality extracted would be "sequence alignment". During the pattern-matching process, the instantiation of one of the patterns triggers a procedure that
extracts and stores the relevant information in the knowledge base.

Resources classification
Once the name and the description of the functionalities
for a given resource have been extracted, we run the second TN to perform the classification. The TN is fed with
the extracted description(s) of the functionality of the current resource, and it tries to match this description with a
resource category and domain. If successfully matched,
the resource is labelled with the preferred term associated
with the respective category or domain. Note that a
resource could be assigned to several categories or
domains. For instance, one possible pattern for detecting
and extracting a resource category and domain is: [("program" | "tool" | "server") + ("for"|"to") + (JJ* + (NN |
NNS))? + "^annot" + ("of" + JJ* + (NN | NNS)+)? + "."].
Applying this pattern to the sentence "AMIGene: a tool for
annotation of microbial genes", the category we get is
"annotation" and the resource domain is "genes".

Additionally, any extra information--such as resource
inputs and outputs--can also be extracted by the second
TN when available. We refer to the type of data received by
the resources when they are invoked as 'inputs' and to the
type of data they return as a result as 'outputs'. For
instance, applying the pattern ["discovery" + "of" + (JJ +
CC?)* + (NN | NNS)++ ("within" | "in") + JJ* + (NN |
NNS)++ "."] to the sentence "We present here a new tool
for discovery of unstructured or disordered regions within
proteins.", "proteins" would be the resource input data.
Data curation
Once all relevant information contained in the abstracts
has been extracted, a team of experts reviews the contents
of the knowledge base to assess its correctness. The curation process mainly focuses on the detection of categories
and domains incorrectly assigned to specific resources.
Then, the experts compare the previously extracted functionality with the assigned categories and domains. If any
errors are detected, the inaccurate entries are removed
from the BIRI knowledge base.
Description of the knowledge base
Once the information has been filtered, it is stored in a
knowledge base. For each discovered resource, we record
the following data: i) the name of the resource, ii) its corresponding URL, iii) a set of natural language descriptions
of its functionalities, iv) the resource's assigned categories,
v) its target domain(s) and vi) the resource's inputs and
outputs when available. Using the same example as
above, this information could be extended and used to
automatically orchestrate workflows involving multiple
resources. The knowledge base also stores data about the
original papers, including the paper's title, author(s),
abstract and PubMed® and ISI Web of Knowledge® identifiers.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/320

Figure 3 is a conceptual view of the knowledge base. As
Figure 3 shows, each resource can be linked to one or
more natural language descriptions of its functionalities-i.e. a tool may provide different functionalities. Each functionality consists of a natural language textual description
extracted from the papers. The descriptions of the functionalities are connected with their respective categories
and target domains. For instance, the 'FATCAT' resource in
Figure 3 is linked to two different functionalities: 'Functionality 2.1' and 'Functionality 2.2'. Similarly, 'Functionality 2.1' is linked to the category 'Search' and to the
domain 'Protein', whereas 'Functionality 2.2' is connected
to the 'Comparison' category and to the 'Protein' domain.
Therefore, the 'FATCAT' resource can be regarded as a tool
for searching and comparing proteins. Similarly,
'CrossLink' can be identified as a tool for exploring RNA
sequences, 'MATRAS' can be considered as a tool for aligning and comparing proteins and 'GenePublisher' can be
identified as a resource for analyzing DNA microarrays.

Results
We implemented the data extraction tool and the web
services layer (WSL) providing the query primitives to
access the knowledge base using the Java programming
language and associated technologies [28]. This includes
the Java Web Services Developer Pack (JWSDP) [29].
The system architecture includes a web services query
layer developed to cover the contents of the knowledge
base. To test the functionality of the developed WSL, we
created a pilot web application on top of the WSL to provide users with a searchable web index of bioinformatics
resources, by using popular web browsers including Internet Explorer®, Mozilla Firefox® and Safari®.
As Figure 4 shows, the pilot web application provides the
following search capabilities: i) retrieve all the information related to a specific resource given its name, and ii)
search for relevant resources belonging to a given category
and/or target domain. In both cases, the user is presented
with a list of records matching the user query and containing basic information on the retrieved resources. This
includes the resource name with a link to the complete
information of the resource, a short textual description of
the provided functionality, and its assigned categories and
domains. Note that the indexing engine may have classified a single resource into multiple categories and
domains, thus producing several entries in the results list.
Clicking on the resource name, the system shows the complete information on this resource, including additional
links to i) the official web page of the resource (if it is actually available in the abstract) and ii) the actual paper
record at the PubMed® website from which the information was extracted.

Figure 3
Conceptual schema of the BIRI knowledge base
Conceptual schema of the BIRI knowledge base. Each resource in the knowledge base is associated with one or more
functionalities. Functionalities are textual natural language descriptions, directly extracted from the papers. Each functionality is
linked with one category and one domain of the existing resource list of categories and domains.

A use case
Let us suppose that a researcher wants to identify
resources for analyzing information from microarrays.
The web application will show the existing categories and
domains in two combo-boxes. These categories and
domains are dynamically loaded using different web services. When the user selects a category, the domain combobox is automatically updated to show the domains associated with the selected category only. Similarly, when the
user selects a domain; the category combo-box is updated
with the appropriate categories. For instance, the
researcher may select "analysis" from the combo-box category. Then, the combo-box domain will be automatically
updated with all the available domains for the chosen category. It includes an extra option for selecting "All"
domains. The researcher will select the "microarray"
domain from that list and then click on the Search button.
The category and domain selection order is not mandatory. The user could select the domain first and the category afterwards.

After the user clicks the Search button, the web application displays a table with information about the resources
contained in the knowledge base that meet the userimposed restrictions. In the above example, the table contains eleven entries, as shown in Figure 4. Each entry contains the name of and a link to the resource, its
functionality, category and domain. Further details on a

given resource can be retrieved by clicking on the resource
name link.
The web application has been tested with multiple queries
selecting different combinations of categories/domains.
Users could also search for a resource by its name.
Searches by name are case-insensitive. The results would
be similar but restricted to the specified resource.
Another interesting feature of the application is to incrementally update the index with new resources. This is
achieved by entering the respective research papers in the
update module. This module verifies the new papers
added to prevent double entries. Papers that have been
previously processed by the system are passed up, and the
others are applied as described above. Users can also contribute by suggesting the inclusion of additional tools/
abstracts by sending an email to the contact address provided on the BIRI web page.
Evaluation
As stated previously, resources are automatically classified
and indexed according to a custom-created list of categories and domains shown in Table 2. This list is composed
of 28 categories--i.e. resource types--targeting nine different domains--i.e. data types. We conducted an experiment
using an input set of 400 abstracts extracted from the ISI
Web of Knowledge®. To create the test set, we queried the

system with the term "bioinformatics resources". Then,
we sorted the results by impact factor and date, and finally
we selected the first 392 documents (the most relevant)
according to this classification [see Additional file 1]. We
also included a small number of documents (eight, in this
case) unrelated to bioinformatics resources to test the
robustness of our approach. As Figure 5a shows, the first
TN extracted the names of 376 resources (94%)--i.e. 24
manuscripts (6%) did not produce anything. From these
24 manuscripts, 16 papers (4%) were discarded even
though they contained information about bioinformatics
resources and the remaining 8 papers were the control set

tions that still provided valuable information for automatically extracting their associated category and domain.
The remaining 2% matched up with incorrect or incoherent descriptions. The coherence of the extracted functionalities was manually assessed to verify the correctness of
the extraction method.

Regarding the functionality extraction process, the first TN
discovered 505 descriptions of functionalities. They were
assigned to the 333 identified resources. Note that a single
resource may be assigned to one or more functionalities.
As Figure 5c shows, a high percentage of the extracted
functionalities (88%) provided complete and coherent
descriptions. Conversely, 10% were incomplete descrip-

the corresponding resource has been classified. This clas-

Conversely, Figure 5b shows the results of the classification process carried out by the second TN. This was fed
with the set of descriptions extracted by the first TN. The
second TN successfully assigned at least one category to
305 resources, and at least one domain to 253 resources.

The table shows examples of the knowledge base contents according with the resources shown in Figure 3. After executing a query, this is the
information provided by the BIRI Web Application. It includes resource names and links, functionalities, categories, and domains.

sification is further refined in the fourth column, which
lists the specific application domain for this resource. For
instance, as shown in the Table 3, the "CrossLink"
resource has been classified under the category "Exploration" and targets the "RNA" domain. Therefore,
"CrossLink" can be regarded as a tool to explore RNA
sequences. Also, additional information can be retrieved
for each resource. Table 1 shows an example of all the
information BIRI provides about any resource. This information has been automatically extracted from the scientific papers using the proposed method. It contains the
resource name, functionalities, categories, domains,
inputs, outputs and paper from which the information
has been extracted. Links to the official web site of the
resource and to the whole paper --in PubMed®-- are provided if they are available in the abstract.
To evaluate the suitability of our approach, we have compared BIRI with other existing public indexes according to
two dimensions: i) features and characteristics provided
by the indexes, and ii) the number of resources contained
in each index that also appear in BIRI. Table 4 focuses on
the first dimension--i.e. features and characteristics of the
indexes. The information used to complete Table 4 has
been extracted from the literature and the official web sites
where the indexes are publicly available. We considered
five different features: i) generation of the index, --i.e.
whether the index was created manually or (semi-)automatically--, ii) indexation of external resources--i.e. whether
other resources have also been indexed in addition to
resources that actually belong to the institution or consortium that set up the index--, iii) the type of search capabilities provided by the index, iv) whether or not the resources
are annotated, and v) whether the index includes any form
of resource classification. As shown in Table 4, all the

indexes that have been analyzed provide some kind of
resource classification and annotation. Most of these
indexes consider external resources and provide other
advanced search capabilities. The major differences lie in
the index generation process since, in most cases, the
indexes are manually generated.
Table 5 deals with the second dimension of the evaluation. It compares the indexes according to the number of
resources that they contain. The yardstick was the curated
BIRI knowledge base. After the curation process, it contained 316 different resource names. Then, we compared
BIRI with the other indexes listed in Table 4. From this
comparison, we were able to obtain the full list of stored
resources. Table 5 shows the total number of resources for
each index, the number of matches with BIRI--i.e. the
number of resources that appear simultaneously in both
indexes--, and the number of resources discovered by BIRI
that the other indexes do not contain. As we can see in the
table, BIRI obtains high matching rates (over 73%) with
two indexes--the BLD and the Online Bioinformatics
Resource Collection. Matching rates for the other indexes
are from 3% to 10%. The difference is due to the kind of
resources each index contains. The indexes containing
heterogeneous resources, such as BIRI, achieve higher
matching rates than others containing only one type of
resources, such as Molecular Biology Database or Database of Databases --which only index databases.

Discussion
Based on pattern matching methods, our method can
automatically create a knowledge base of bioinformatics
resources by i) detecting resource names, ii) extracting
short descriptions of functionalities and iii) classifying the
extracted artefacts according to a list of categories and

We compare existing indexes containing information about resources. We considered several classification criteria: i) automatic index generation,
ii) whether or not the index indexes external resources, iii) whether the index interface provides advanced search capabilities, iv) whether or not
the resources are annotated, and v) whether the index establishes a resources classification.

domains of bioinformatics resources, which extends the
BLD classification [7] on which our list is based. We
believe that creating a standardized taxonomy or ontology
of bioinformatics resources is a crucial task to facilitate
collaborative and integrative approaches [1].
For the methodology proposed in this paper to work, the
bioinformatics resources have to have been previously
published and indexed in PubMed® or the ISI Web of
Knowledge®. Otherwise, the resources would never be
found using this method. In contrast, our approach guarantees that only high-quality resources are indexed. Once
these resources have passed a peer-review process, confidence in their quality can be actually higher.
Table 4 compares our approach with the most relevant
indexes available at the time of writing this paper --and

considering that BIRI is a prototype, currently being
expanded. As shown in Table 5, from an original set of
over 400 papers, the system automatically discovered
more than 230 resources that also appear in BLD or the
Online Bioinformatics Resource Collection. Another
interesting fact pointed out by Table 5 is that BIRI contains several resources not included in other indexes. The
number of new resources in BIRI ranges from 81 (when
compared to BLD) to 306 (when compared to Pathguide).
This happens since existing indexes are often updated
only considering manuscripts published in a reduced set
of journals. This limited vision hinders the creation and
maintenance of an exhaustive list of resources. Conversely, our methodology is not centered in any particular
journal. It follows a more general approach using
PubMed® or the ISI Web of Knowledge® as information
sources. This provides us with a broader vision of recent

We compare the resources contained in the curated BIRI knowledge base with the resources indexed by other public indexes at the time of writing
this paper. The table shows: i) the total number of resources indexed by each index, ii) the number of matches found between BIRI and the index,
and iii) the number of resources existing in BIRI knowledge base that do not exist in the other index.

developments. Once new manuscripts are available in
PubMed® or the ISI Web of Knowledge®, our system can be
updated with the new resources.
Our approach extends most of the search capabilities provided by other existing tools. In addition, the index is
automatically generated and updated in our approach.
The update process is a very time-consuming and tedious
task that is usually performed manually by groups of
experts. Applying the same methodology detailed above,
the contents of our index and knowledge base can be
automatically updated by just entering new manuscripts
and abstracts into the tool.
Our index provides users with advanced search capabilities. It can, for instance, perform complex searches, such
as searching for resources matching a definite category
and/or target domain. As stated previously, our knowledge base is built automatically using pattern-matching
techniques, whereas other indexes are created, maintained
and updated manually. Besides, our knowledge base can
be automatically updated with new resources simply by
feeding the developed information extraction tool with
manuscripts describing recently developed tools, databases and services.
Considering other existing indexes, our knowledge base
provides additional information, such as, for instance, the
target domains where the different types of resources can
be applied or the resource inputs and outputs. Using the
resources' names and extending the information about
inputs and outputs, BIRI could be useful for automatically
orchestrating workflows like applications combining several resources. An example of resource combination
through workflow definition is described in a previous

work carried out by the authors, where multiple databases
are queried to retrieve information regarding the proteins
involved in a genetic disease [30]. The results provided by
a database are used to build the query for the next database.
Additionally, text-mining based methods for information
extraction reported that they could benefit from manuscripts with more structured abstracts [31].

Conclusion
Our tool automatically extracts and organizes relevant
information about bioinformatics resources from
research papers describing the resources. Our method,
based on a domain-independent approach, can be used to
create inventories targeting different scientific fields
[32,33]. For instance, this approach is currently being
applied in the European Commission-funded ActionGRID project, coordinated by the authors [34]. In one of
the workpackages of this project, we are creating an inventory of bioinformatics and nanomedical resources that is
intended to help researchers in these areas [35].
Several initiatives have been carried out aimed at cataloguing the existing bioinformatics resources. Although
our tool could work as a standalone application, it has not
been designed for this purpose. Our tool is intended not
as a replacement for but an add-on to existing indexes and
applications. We are working on integrating our tool as a
plug-in for other consolidated applications, such as
BioPortal or BioMoby. Additionally, tools for defining
workflows, such as TAVERNA [36], could also benefit
from the information provided by an extended version of
our index.

The inventory of resources could also be collaboratively
updated by other external contributing researchers. This
collaborative approach is being successfully applied in
other fields, such as, for instance, developing biomedical
ontologies at the NCBO [3]. At the NCBO, different collaborative tools--developed using Web 2.0 techniques-are available for developing biomedical ontologies.
Researchers can contribute by entering new information
or comments about the existing information.
