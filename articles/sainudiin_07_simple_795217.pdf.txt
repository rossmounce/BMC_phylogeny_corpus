Abstract
Background: Descriptive hierarchical Poisson models and population-genetic coalescent mixture
models are used to describe the observed variation in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
density from samples of size two across the human genome.
Results: Using empirical estimates of recombination rate across the human genome and the
observed SNP density distribution, we produce a maximum likelihood estimate of the genomic
heterogeneity in the scaled mutation rate θ. Such models produce significantly better fits to the
observed SNP density distribution than those that ignore the empirically observed recombinational
heterogeneities.
Conclusion: Accounting for mutational and recombinational heterogeneities can allow for
empirically sound null distributions in genome scans for "outliers", when the alternative hypotheses
include fundamentally historical and unobserved phenomena.

Background
Understanding the population-genetic forces behind the
observed variation among human genome sequences is
vital to deciphering the genetic causes of phenotypic variation among humans. The phenomena that influence the
density of human SNPs include (1) variation-introducing
events that are empirically observable, such as, pointmutations, recombinations, and activities of various
transposable elements that may result from the counteraction of various DNA damage and repair pathways [[1], for
e.g.], as well as (2) genealogy-affecting events that are historical and generally unobserved, such as population
dynamics, population structure, and natural selection. A
biological understanding of the observed genomic variation in SNP density, by means of explicit populationgenetic models of coalescence in the presence of recombination and mutation, must incorporate any interplay

among the heterogeneities in the above phenomena. Here
we strive for an empirically sound understanding of the
observed human SNP density, as determined by a
genome-wide alignment of two different consensus
sequences, by accounting for the empirically observable
mutational and recombinational heterogeneities under
the simplest model of population history (selectively-neutral, constant-sized, random-mating). The two sequences
are the NCBI human genome sequence and the sequence
produced by Celera Genomics [2]. Our SNP density data
were obtained from first aligning the Celera consensus
sequence to the NCBI assembly and then counting the
number of SNPs in bins of 100 kb (100,000 base pairs),
as was done in section 6 of the above study [2]. Next, we
build simple models for the distribution of SNP density
from random samples of size 2 from a locus that is 100 kb
in length. Our objective is to explain as much of this sim-

ple measure of diversity as possible, under empirically
sound null hypotheses that include coarse-grained,
genome-wide measurements of recombinational variation.

Results
Two approaches toward modeling are taken. The first
approach is descriptive and employs hierarchical Poisson
models to obtain better fits than the homogeneous Poisson distribution used earlier [2]. Insights gained from the
first approach inform the second approach. The second
approach is non-descriptive and population-genetic with
biologically interpretable parameters. It employs mixtures
of SNP densities simulated under the coalescent with different mutation and recombination rates to obtain a better fit to the observed SNP density distribution. This
approach introduces heterogeneity into the coalescentbased simulation of SNP density that was shown to produce a poor fit under the assumptions of genome-wide
homogeneity and equality of mutation and recombination rates [2]. The simple closed-form expressions used in
the paper are elementary results in coalescent theory [3,4].
Descriptive Hierarchical Poisson Models
Let Λ and T be the parameters in the mass function of a
Poisson distribution given by Pr(X = x|ΛT) = e-ΛT(ΛT)x/x!.
The random variables Λ and T are generally proxies for relative mutation rate and the sum of branch lengths of the
coalescent trees for all the non-recombining segment(s) of
the 100 kb locus, respectively. In other words, T is a proxy
for the sum of the branch lengths of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG-size) of our sample of size 2 at a
locus that is 100 kb long. The random variable X represents the count of SNPs in contiguous 100 kb intervals
from an alignment of two human genomes. In this hierarchical scheme, heterogeneities are modeled by the
Gamma and Beta probability density functions (PDFs),
G(γ1, γ2) and B (β1, β2), respectively, as described in Methods. We chose the Gamma distribution G(γ1, γ2) to model
T for the following reasons. When there is no recombination, the depth of the coalescent tree of two samples is
exponentially distributed with rate parameter 1, i.e.,
G(1,1). And when there are n sites with free recombination in between them, the sum of the n independent and
exponentially distributed depths is G(n, 1). Thus, T is only
a mathematically convenient proxy for the ARG-size of
our sample of size 2, since T ~ G(γ1, γ2) does not explicitly
capture the distribution of ARG-size for intermediate levels of intra-locus recombination among sites at our locus.
We use the relatively flexible Beta family on [0, 1] to
model, Λ which is a proxy for relative mutation rate. The
Poisson distribution for SNP density follows from the
assumption of the infinitely-many-sites mutational
model under selective neutrality, where mutations hit a
site at most once according to the product of the total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/146

length of the site-specific coalescent tree and the site-specific relative mutation rate. Therefore, such hierarchical
Poisson models are merely descriptive, as they are built
via mathematically convenient Beta and Gamma distributed random variables Λ and T that act as proxies for the
relative mutation rate and the ARG-size, respectively.
The likelihood function for each of the following hierarchical Poisson models was maximized with the Newton's
method from several random initial conditions. We use
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [5] to make model
comparisons. For a given model AIC = -2 log(ML) + 2K,
where ML is the maximum likelihood value and K is the
number of parameters in the model. In the hierarchical
Poisson model A, we allow T ~ G(γ1, γ2), while Λ is fixed
at 1. The fit to the data (Figure 1) improved in comparison
to the homogeneous Poisson fit which completely ignores
the underlying ancestral recombination process. Thus,
when the Gamma distribution is used to approximate the
distribution of the sum of all branch lengths of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG-size) of a locus, the
observed variance is better explained. Model A is mutationally homogeneous as Λ, the proxy for mutation rate,
is fixed. In order to allow variation, a hierarchical Poisson
model A' that restricts T to a constant parameter λ while
allowing Λ to be Beta distributed (Λ ~ B(β1, β2)) was fit to
the data. The fit was significantly better than that of model
A. Thus, modeling heterogeneity in mutation rates, via the
Beta distributed proxy Λ, across the different 100 kb loci
gives better fits to the SNP density distribution. When we
allowed both Λ to be Beta distributed and T to be Gamma
distributed, we get the hierarchical Poisson model B. As
shown in Figure 1, the fit is significantly better to the
observed data when heterogeneities in both mutation and
recombination are approximately accounted for through
the proxies in model B. The results of the maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of these four Poisson models are
summarized in Table 1. The first and second moments

ˆ
( μ , and σ 2 ) under the maximum likelihood estimates
are also shown for each model in the Table. Note that the
means are almost the same but the variances vary considerably. If one wants a data-descriptive fit to the SNP density distribution, then Model B is a good candidate. With
the arrival of more refined data (with counts in low-density regions as discussed later) one could consider further
generalizations of such hierarchical Poisson models along
the zero-inflated class [6], for instance, to obtain better
descriptive fits. Unfortunately, the best-fitted parameters
of such descriptive models lack any explicit biological

interpretability, in terms of standard population-genetic
models of reproduction. Guided by insights from these
descriptive hierarchical Poisson models, we analyze the
simplest population-genetic model of the neutral coalescent with an explicit accounting for heterogeneities in
both mutation and recombination rates. We use a simu-

Population-Genetic Coalescent Mixture Models
A panmictic, Wright-Fisher, neutral coalescent model with
a constant effective population size of 10,000 diploid
individuals was assumed to simulate the distribution of
the number of segregating sites at a locus of 100 kb evolving under an infinitely-many-sites mutation model using
the C program ms [8]. The scaled product of the effective
population size (Ne) and the mutation rate per locus per
generation (μ) is denoted by θ = 4Neμ. The recombination
rate r is the probability of cross-over per generation
between the ends of the locus being simulated and its
scaled product with Ne is denoted by ρ = 4Ner.

In the absence of recombination and with constant mutation rates, the distribution of SNPs is known to have an
explicit form. The coalescent tree is identical for every
nucleotide site in the locus in any given realization of the
coalescent process of two samples. Since the rescaled time
to the coalescent event and the mutation event are exponentially distributed with rates 1 and θ, respectively, the
probability of a mutation event before the coalescent
event is θ/(1 + θ). Thus, the probability of observing x
mutations at our locus before the coalescent event is (θ/(1
+ θ))x 1/(1 + θ). In other words, the probability of observing x SNPs at a locus when r = 0 is geometrically distributed with parameter 1/(1 + θ).

It is also known that as the recombination rate at our
locus approaches infinity, the distribution of SNPs
approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter θ. This
can be seen from the following argument. High levels of
recombination assures that the coalescent tree at each site
is independent of those at other sites. Thus, for a locus
with n sites, the probability of observing x SNPs is

bution, as the number of replicates (N) used to estimate it

However, when the recombination rate is some intermediate value between the above two extremes no explicit
forms are known for the SNP density. We use empirical
estimates of the SNP density from a large number of simulations (typically 100,000). Figure 2 shows how the distribution of SNP density under our assumptions morphs
from the geometric distribution (black dots) towards the
Poisson distribution (grey dots) as the scaled recombination rate ρ increases from 0 to 1000 in decreasing shades
of grey. This behavior is identical for any fixed value of θ
except for a scale change.
The empirical estimates of the sex-averaged human
recombination rates in 1 Mbp intervals based on Genethon [9], Marshfield [10] and deCODE [11] maps were
downloaded from [12]. We intrapolated to obtain the
estimates over 100 kb segments by assuming rate constancy over the 10 consecutive 100 kb segments that constitute the 1 Mbp segment for which an empirical estimate
of the recombination rate were available. The empirical
distribution of the sex-averaged human recombination
rate in 100 kb intervals, based on Genethon map, as
shown in Figure 3, is denoted by R . The strategy
described in Methods was used to obtain a simulationbased empirical estimate of the SNP density distribution
for each scaled mutation rate

also used in a similar analysis. Comparable estimates were
obtained under a reasonably good fit (MSL = -185558)
with the deCODE map whose empirical CDF resembles
that of the Genethon Map. However, an analysis with the
Marshfield map yielded a poorer fit (MSL = -186007). Figure 4 summarizes the fits to the observed SNP data while

data.

Discussion
Another study [13] claimed to have achieved a good fit to
single reads with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 SNPs, by accounting for

mutational heterogeneity and genealogical variability in a
different manner. They partitioned the genome into 200
kb bins, and selected a single read from each bin. They calculated the observed GC content of the bin, and from a
regression of GC content on nucleotide diversity across
the whole genome, they calculated an expected diversity
given the local GC content of each bin induced by the
exponentially distributed coalescent time for samples of
size 2 in the absence of recombination. However, when
the full bin size of 100 kb were used [2], the SNP count
ranged to more than 100 per bin. Because many neighboring reads have shared genealogies, the magnitude of variability from bin to bin is much greater, and the power to
detect this heterogeneity is far greater. Thus, the latter
study [2] found that the coalescent in the presence of
recombination fit the observed SNP density better than
the coalescent without recombination. The model
employed in the former study [13] fits without recombination only because the power is so low to detect a departure and because there are correspondingly fewer
recombination events expected within single reads vs. 100

kb bins. Using the data of SNP counts in 100 kb bins in
this study, we find that the coalescent with heterogeneities
in recombination as well as mutation gives substantially
better fits than the coalescent with a constant rate of
recombination and mutation. We have shown that by
invoking heterogeneities in mutation and recombination
rates, one can better explain the observed variation in SNP
density across two randomly sampled 100 kb segments of
human chromosomes. Descriptive fits by means of hierarchical Poisson models, as well as population-genetic fits
by means of coalescent mixture models, significantly
improved when heterogeneities in recombination as well
as mutation rates were accounted for. The coalescent mixture model does not completely fit the data in the most
interesting region, namely, the segments with the least
SNP density. This is partly due to the filtering strategy used
to obtain the data. Since there were considerable gaps in
the alignments for several bins, there was an overestimation of bins with 0 SNPs. Thus, these bins were ignored
from the analysis. Were low SNP counts from such currently ignored bins made available from a high-resolution
alignment, a similar analysis would reveal the poorer fits
of the descriptive hierarchical Poisson models employed
here, unless they are further generalized to allow for a
larger mass at 0 through the zero-inflated class [6], for
instance. If one's objective is to produce a descriptive fit to
our observed SNP density distribution, then the hierarchical model B is clearly preferable to all the models considered in this study due to its strikingly high likelihood
value. However, if one wanted a population-genetic
model with biologically interpretable parameters to fit the
same data, then the best fitted coalescent mixture model
with the Genethon recombination map is preferable.
It is important to bear in mind that the distribution of T
will be affected not only by recombination rate but also by
population structure and demography. Likewise, the distribution of Λ and T will be affected by the complex interaction between various DNA damage and repair pathways
that ultimately lead to various types of mutational and
recombinational events [[1], for e.g.]. Moreover, the
action of selection will simultaneously affect both the distribution of T and Λ about the selected site(s). However,
since only a small percentage of the genome is expected to
be affected by recent selective sweeps, the overall SNP
density distribution should not be significantly affected
by such selective events. Thus, our MSL estimate of the
genomic variation in θ, based on the Genethon map, is
under the standard neutral coalescent that allows for
recombinational and mutational rate heterogeneity across
the genome. The true genomic variation in θ can also be
affected by several other confounded historical factors
including selection, population structure, and demography, besides genomic variation in mutation rate. All these
confounded historical factors can be seen as alternative

Conclusion
As high resolution data for larger samples become available at a genomic scale, one can use such simulated ML
methods (with appropriate sample sizes) to get the null
distributions of various test statistics while accounting for
heterogeneities in recombination rates (from empirical
maps or finer-scaled inferred maps) and mutation rates
(from the informative phylogenomic constraints imposed
by additional ape genomes). Such empirically observable
phenomena should be incorporated into the null hypothesis when more complex models with unobserved historical phenomena, such as population dynamics,
population structure, and/or natural selection are tested
in humans at the genomic scale. Current scans of the
human genome tend to underestimate the costs of ignoring the empirically observable heterogeneities under the
null hypothesis.

Methods
In the hierarchical Poisson scheme, heterogeneities are
modeled by the following Gamma and Beta probability
density functions (PDFs),
