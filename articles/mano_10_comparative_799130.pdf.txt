Abstract
Background: Pathways provide topical descriptions of cellular circuitry. Comparing analogous
pathways reveals intricate insights into individual functional differences among species. While previous
works in the field performed genomic comparisons and evolutionary studies that were based on specific
genes or proteins, whole genomic sequence, or even single pathways, none of them described a
genomic system level comparative analysis of metabolic pathways. In order to properly implement such
an analysis one should overcome two specific challenges: how to combine the effect of many pathways
under a unified framework and how to appropriately analyze co-evolution of pathways.
Here we present a computational approach for solving these two challenges. First, we describe a
comprehensive, scalable, information theory based computational pipeline that calculates pathway
alignment information and then compiles it in a novel manner that allows further analysis. This
approach can be used for building phylogenies and for pointing out specific differences that can then
be analyzed in depth. Second, we describe a new approach for comparing the evolution of
metabolic pathways. This approach can be used for detecting co-evolutionary relationships
between metabolic pathways.
Results: We demonstrate the advantages of our approach by applying our pipeline to data from
the MetaCyc repository (which includes a total of 205 organisms and 660 metabolic pathways).
Our analysis revealed several surprising biological observations. For example, we show that the
different habitats in which Archaea organisms reside are reflected by a pathway based phylogeny. In
addition, we discover two striking clusters of metabolic pathways, each cluster includes pathways
that have very similar evolution.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that distance measures that are based on the topology and the
content of metabolic networks are useful for studying evolution and co-evolution.

Background
The increasing availability of pathway information
enables the comparative analyses of organisms at the
functional level. As the basis for such studies we propose
to use pathway alignment, an effective technique that
provides both a similarity score as well as a clear
indication of specific differences between pathways.
The score can be used as yet another type of data with
which to build dissimilarity-based phylogenies, but - in
addition - the alignment details allow in-depth analysis
of the evolutionary changes that various pathways
underwent. Thus, our method allows a systematic
examination of evolutionary relationships among species using their functional traits, based on a description
of their entire metabolic processes rather than an
individual element as in conventional analysis. In
addition, such studies allow us both to further improve
pathway alignment techniques by finding more faithful
similarity scores, as well as to study co-evolution of
metabolic pathways.
Specifically, there is currently a significant amount of
metabolic pathways data residing in public and proprietary databases such as KEGG [1], MetaCyc [2], iPath [3]
and BioCarta [4]. The various databases have mostly
overlapping data; however, the pathways of many
organisms appear only in some of the databases, or
appear in all or some of them but with different
constituent enzymes and morphology. Nevertheless,
this data is rich enough to be used in order to determine
similarity in a large set of species and pathways.
A single analogous pathway can be used as the basis for
generating a similarity matrix between a set of species (i.e.
the similarity score that is obtained when comparing this
pathway in each pair of organisms is regarded as the
similarity between them), and then build a phylogenetic
tree that reflects the evolutionary history based on this
pathway alone. One pathway, however, does not tell the
whole story. The first algorithm that we propose here looks
at all the known pathways in a set of organisms and
combines their similarity scores in a systematic fashion to
produce a more comprehensive picture; an entropy-like
weight determines the information contents of each
individual pathway when computing the combined
similarity score between organisms.
Furthermore, pathways interact functionally with each
other; these interactions can be reflected in their
evolution. Our second algorithm is a novel approach
for studying the co-evolution of metabolic pathways.
Our method detects pathways whose evolution is
correlative both in terms of changes in their topology
and in terms of changes in their enzymatic content.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S1/S38

The application of our algorithms enabled us to draw
some specific conclusions about the usability of pathway
information. Moreover, we were able to make observations about the evolutionary relationships between
certain families of organisms and shed light on their
proper classification. For example, we were able to
resolve evolutionary relationships among different
archaeal species based on their metabolic pathways.
Furthermore, unique properties common to both thermophilic Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea were detected.
Additionally, we used our approach to study coevolution of metabolic pathways. We discovered that
the analyzed pathways can be clustered into two groups
according to their evolution. This result may imply that
there are strong functional relations between pathways
that are part of the same cluster.

Previous work
Both the algorithm for inferring phylogeny from metabolic pathways and the algorithm for studying coevolution of metabolic pathways are based on the
alignment of metabolic pathways [5]. There has been
considerable work on the alignment of pathways and
networks [5-7] and most methods provide some kind of
a similarity score; we refer the reader to [8] for a recent
review. Dandekar et al. [9] presented one of the earliest
efforts introducing comparative analysis of metabolic
pathways, combining three methods of comparing
biochemical pathways: analysis and comparison of
biochemical data, analysis based on elementary modes,
and comparative genome analysis. Among other results,
it showed high plasticity in the glycolysis pathway.
Clemente et al. [10] used metabolic pathway comparison
to show that vital biological processes in a group of
related species are usually expressed by a number of
highly conserved reactions. Furthermore, they show that
it is unlikely for a group of reactions to be completely
missing form one of the organisms in a set of similar
species.

There has also been growing interest in the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from the abovementioned
comparison results [11-15] in recent years. Heymans and
Singh [14] presented a technique for the phylogenetic
analysis of metabolic pathways based on the topology of
the underlying graphs. They defined a distance measure
between graphs using the similarity between nodes of
the graphs (and some consideration of the topological
relationship between them). This distance measure was
applied to the enzyme-enzyme relational graphs derived
from metabolic pathways and the resulting distance
matrix was used to obtain a phylogenetic tree. In a later
work by Clemente et al. [16], a software tool that uses
metabolic pathway comparison to create phylogenetic

BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 1):S38

trees is presented; the comparison method used here is
pseudo-alignment, i.e., mapping each reaction in one
pathway to another reaction or a group of reactions in
the other. This tool, however, covers only a limited
number of organisms and pathways for which a
phylogenetic tree can be built. Hong et al. [17] presented
a method for constructing a phylogenetic tree based on
metabolic data deduced from genomic sequences. This
method accounts for horizontal gene transfer and
specific gene loss by comparing whole metabolic
subpathways, and allows evaluation of evolutionary
relatedness and changes in metabolic pathways.
Another work in this area is by Chor and Tuller [18]. They
create phylogenetic trees based on distances between
metabolic networks of different species. The distance
measure they use is based on the relative description length
(RDL) of the networks, i.e. the number of bits needed to
describe one network given the other. This method is more
efficient when dealing with large metabolic networks than
most other known comparison methods.
Still, to the best of our knowledge, to date (except for the
MetaPathwayHunter, MPH, alignment algorithm of [5]
on which our paper is based) no one has used a score
that reflects both the pathway structure as well as the
identity of the enzymes in such studies and no
systematic handling of all pathways in many organisms
has been offered.
Finally, previous works showed that proteins with
similar functionality [2,19,20] that physically interact
[21], or that are close to each other in a metabolic
network [22,23], tend to have similar evolution. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work
analyzed co-evolution of metabolic pathways by a
measure that considers both the enzymes in the pathways and its topology.
Here we perform for the first time a complete computational comparison of organisms based on all the available
metabolic pathways that describe their function, taking
into account both enzyme contents as well as pathway
topology, and accounting for differences in functionality
that is reflected in missing pathways. Furthermore, we
deduce the co-evolution of pathways in different organisms
based on the same data. Our results reveal a few novel and
biologically significant observations.

Methods
Pathway alignment and data organization
Most pathway databases and repositories (such as KEGG
[1], MetaCyc [2], and BioCarta [4] provide an instance of
each pathway for each of the organisms in which this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S1/S38

pathway occurs. Instances describing the same cellular
process could be different, of course, but they are
considered analogous. Thus, differences between two
organisms that are specific to a given pathway can be
found by using a pathway alignment engine such as
MetaPathwayHunter (MPH) [5], to align the two
instances against each other, producing (the not necessarily equal) two similarity scores. When looking at a set
of n organisms, we can arrange the results of an allagainst-all comparison of the organisms for a specific
pathway in an n × n matrix a, where aij is the similarity
score of aligning the pathway as it appears in organism
i with its analogous occurrence in organism j.
Each such 2 dimensional array is called a page (Figure 1A),
and in itself it constitutes a similarity matrix that can be
used for building a phylogeny. A single pathway, however,
is not a good enough basis for deriving meaningful
phylogenies (and for calibrating the similarity score).
Rather, we are interested in a global picture based on all
the available pathways. Thus, we create a page for each of
the m pathways in the database; then, the resulting pages
are organized in an n × n × m 3 dimensional (3D) array, A,
where each page is indexed by the corresponding pathway
(Figure 1B); now Aijk is the similarity score for comparing
pathway k as it appears in organisms i and j. Note that since
some pathways do not exist for some of the organisms (or
are missing from the database), the sizes of the pages might
not be commensurate with each other; to accommodate for
this phenomenon and to obtain a regular n × n × m 3D
array we stretch the pages to be the same size, denoting
missing entries appropriately (see more on this below).

Interpreting and weighting the data
Analyzing these data in order to obtain insights about
the evolutionary history of the organisms was performed
as follows: We collapse the 3D array into a 2dimensional (dis)similarity matrix by combining the m
entries in each column into one scalar entry; this matrix
would serve us as a distance matrix in order to build a
phylogenetic tree using known algorithms. The first step
in the process of combining a column’s entries is setting
a threshold that describes scores as relevant: all similarity
scores below this threshold (assuming all similarity
scores, as produced by MPH, are lower than or equal to 0
and the higher the score - the better the similarity) will
not contribute to the values in the similarity matrix, and
all similarity scores above it will contribute to them
equally. Using this method - on one hand - causes some
loss of information, but - on the other hand - enables
combining the data in an effective manner while also
handling the issue of missing entries that will be
discussed in more detail later in this section. For each
page we create a Threshold Graph (TG) in the following

The “pages” matrix and its uses. (A) A “page” summarizes the alignment results for one pathway which actually describes
the evolution of a pathway; Many such pages, stacked on top of each other, create an organisms*organisms*pathways 3D

co-evolution of pathways (C).

manner: define a node v Œ V for each organism; two such
nodes are connected by a directed edge e Œ E if their
similarity score is higher than the given threshold. Using
(1) we calculate w, an assessed weight for each TG:
w(TG(V , E)) = −

∑
v∈V

⎛ deg(v)
deg(v)
log ⎜
⎜ V
V
⎝

⎞
⎟.
⎟
⎠

(1)

This weight, inspired by (but not identical to) Shannon’s
entropy [24], reflects the amount of information in the
page. This formula gives scores ≥0 to each graph, based
on the degrees of all its nodes. A graph will have w = 0
if the degrees of all nodes in the graph are 0, since
the −

deg( v)
V

part of the formula will be 0 for each node.

Alternatively, w = 0 if all node degrees are |V|, in which

⎛
⎞
case the log ⎜ deg(v) ⎟ will be equal to 0 for all nodes. In
V
⎝
⎠
the first case, the organisms are all different from one
another and there is nothing to learn about their
similarity. In the latter, each organism is “very similar”
to all the other organisms, which can teach us nothing

new about the whole group. Each edge in the TG is given
a weight according to this formula. The 3D array is
modified by replacing Aijk by 0 if nodes i and j are not
joined by an edge in the TG corresponding to pathway k,
and by the calculated weight w if an edge exists between
organisms i and j in the TG. In fact, each page is now the
adjacency matrix of the weighted TG.
This technique also solves the problem of missing entries,
as follows: for the cases where a pathway exists in one of
the organisms but does not in the other, we decided never
to connect the two organisms with an edge in the TG, and
as a result the corresponding entry in the array will always
be 0. To accommodate the cases where the pathway is
missing in both organisms, we added a new global,
Boolean parameter b: If b is true then each such two
organisms will be joined by an edge, otherwise such edges
will not be formed. Intuitively, if the confidence in the data
is high then b should be assigned true, since in this case the
absence of a pathway in both organisms tells us that they
are similar in their lacking. If our confidence in the data is
low, b should be assigned false since in this case the
pathway could be missing due to lack of data, and this
might not indicate a real (dis)similarity.

Naturally, using a threshold in forming the TG resulted
in loss of information. However, we found that the
advantage of being able to include missing entries is far
more significant to our results than the information lost
by not using the actual alignment score. Furthermore, by
adjusting the threshold value, we can make sure that our
results are as precise as possible. After dealing with this
issue we can safely add all the similarity scores in
each vector along the pathway axis and thus create a
2-dimensional similarity matrix.
Building phylogenetic trees
The resulting 2D matrix is turned into a dissimilarity
matrix so that it can be used as input to an algorithm for
building phylogenetic trees, e.g. the neighbor-joining
algorithm [25], as embodied in e.g. the Phylip [26]
package, as follows: each element in the matrix is
subtracted from the maximum element in it; recall that
this element must appear along the main diagonal since
each organism obtains a perfect similarity score when
aligned with itself.

Finally, it is possible to identify the contribution of
specific pathways to the resulting phylogeny: One can
trace differences among phylogenetic trees back to the
pathways that cause them in order to understand their
biological reason; furthermore, the alignments produced
by the MPH algorithm can be used to further elucidate
these differences. Moreover, we can study the pathways
whose TGs got the highest weights to see if they induce
an interesting classification of the organisms into groups.
The computational pipeline for inferring a phylogenetic
tree based on metabolic pathways

Data sources
Our algorithm was applied to data that was obtained
from the MetaCyc repository [2]. We chose this database
since it is very rich in data and it is organized in a way
that best suits our requirements, i.e., it contains one
variation of each pathway for all the organisms for which
it is known. Initially we used over 660 metabolic
pathways for the 205 organisms that were retrieved
from this database (the entire data available at the time
of the assay, September 2007). This presented a
significant computational challenge, namely making
over 26 million individual pathway alignments. Fortunately, this problem is “embarrassingly parallel", i.e.
each alignment can be run separately, and thus we were
able to solve it using a computational Grid facility.

Studying co-evolution of metabolic pathways
For comparing the evolution of different metabolic
pathways the following steps were performed. First, a
distance matrix (i.e. a page, see Figure 1) was computed
for each pathway (as before). Next, all the pages were
compared to each other, one pair at a time. To this end,
we considered both the fact that a pathway may appear
only in part of the organisms and that in cases that a
pathway appears in a pair of organisms its structure in
the two organisms may be different (see the previous
subsections). Thus, the distance measure between a pair
of matrices includes two components: one is the
generalized Hamming distance that ‘captures’ similar/
non-similar appearances in the same organism, H(p1,
p2). This can be further explained as follows: Let d1
denote the value of an entry in the distance matrix
corresponding to a case where a pathway does not
appear in the two organisms; let d2 denote the value of
an entry in the distance matrix corresponding to a case
where a pathway appears in the two organisms; let d3
denote the value of an entry in the distance matrix
corresponding to a case where a pathway appears in the
first organism but not in the second one; and let d4
denote the value of an entry in the distance matrix
corresponding to a case where a pathway appears in the
second organism but not in the first one. Let D(x, y)
denote the contribution to the generalized Hamming
distance due to value xin a certain entry in the page of
one pathway and y in the same entry in the page of the
second pathway. We used ∀xD(x, x) = 0;

D(d3, d4) = D(d4, d3) = 2, D(d3, d1) = D(d4, d1) = D(d3, d2) =
D(d4, d2) = 1, and D(d1, d3) = D(d1, d4) = D(d2, d3) =
D(d2, d4) = 1.
The final score was normalized by dividing it by the
number of entries in a page.
The second component, L(p1, p2), considers only entries
where both pathways appear in both organisms and it
is the L 1 distance between the vectors that are
composed of these entries in the two organisms. The
final distance is a weighted average of the two
distances, computed as in (2). As the first component
of the score reflected a rougher distance measure we
used Wp = 100; however, the result was robust to small
changes in Wp.

D(p1 , p 2 ) = (Wp ⋅ H(p1 , p 2 ) + L(p1 , p 2 )) /(1 + Wp ).

(2)

Based on this measure we generated a distance matrix
between pathways that can be further analyzed as
described in the next section (for example by clustering
analysis).

Results and discussion
Analysis of the entire dataset of MetaCyc
The version of MetaCyc that was used in this work includes
660 pathways and 205 organisms. Using a computational
grid comprising 250 nodes we were able to analyze the
entire dataset, i.e. to perform more than 26 million
individual pathway alignments in just a few days.

Evolutionary trees based on the entire dataset were very
noisy. The main reason for this result is the fact that the
data in most of the pathways/organisms are very partial.
For example, the mean size (number of enzymes) of 200 of
the pathways over the organisms that appear in the dataset
is less than 3. On the other hand, the size of the pathway
with the top mean size is 53. Thus, as specific biological
examples (as described in the next subsections) we chose
less biased subsets of organisms and pathways.
An example: a phylogenetic tree of Archaea based on
metabolic pathways
As a specific biological example we performed a deep
biological analysis of all the Archaea that appear in
MetaCyc based on their metabolic pathways. We chose
this dataset for two main reasons. First, this dataset is
less biased since the size of the metabolic network of all
Archaea in MetaCyc is relatively similar (up to 56%
difference; for example, in Eukaryotes the maximal
difference was 430% and in Bacteria it was much larger,
720%). Second, as the Archaea live in extreme and
diverse environments it is interesting to compare the
changes in their metabolic networks to their phylogeny.

A phylogenetic tree that was produced by running the
algorithm is displayed in Figure 2A and was compared to
the NCBI reference tree (displayed in Figure 2B). Note
that even though the two trees are differently structured,
the basic topology is very similar, i.e. the resulting tree is
well separated into Methanogens (Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanopyrus kandleri,
Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina acetivorans, and
Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus), Halophiles,
and Thermophiles and Archaeoglobus fulgidus is farthest
from the rest of the organisms.
The differences between these two trees are interesting
and usually can be explained: The Hyperthermophilic A.
fulgidus also falls close to the Methanogens. This can be
explained by the fact that A. fulgidus represents an
evolutionary transitional type of organism among the
Archaea: it is a hyperthermophile and yet is known to be
related to Methanogens [27]. For example, A. fulgidus
contains acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS), a
multienzyme complex catalyzing the reversible cleavage
and synthesis of acetyl-CoA in methanogens [28]. A.

a freshwater organism that can adapt to grow at elevated
salinities [31]. Thus, its metabolism resembles the
metabolism of Halobacteriaceae that are found in water
saturated or nearly saturated with salt.
Still, there are some unresolved discrepancies between
the two trees. One unresolved issue is the intermix of the
Thermophilic Crenarchaea and the Thermophilic Euryarchaea in the thermophilic cluster. Specifically, why are the
Thermophilic Crenarchaea divided in the tree shown in
Figure 2A? Why is Pyrococcus horikoshii linked to them
whereas the crenarchaeote Sofolobus solfataricus is
grouped with the euryarchaeotes Pyrococcus furiosus,
Thermoplasma acidophilum, and Thermoplasma volcanium?
This may be either a result of a curation error in the
MetaCyc database or it may suggest that the metabolism
of Thermophilic Crenarchaea and the Thermophilic Euryarchaea is not significantly different. We encourage an
additional future research on this issue.

website. (B) A tree constructed for the Archaea by our
algorithm using deletion score = -2, threshold = -5, b = true.

fulgidus is an example of an organism that contains a
functional ACDS complex and is not a methanogen.
Furthermore, Thermophilic Archaea are clustered together
(with representatives from both Thermophilic Crenarchaea
and Thermophilic Euryarchaea). This implies the existence
of unique pathways that are found only in thermophiles.
Anaerobic respiration, TCA cycle, and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways in MetaCyc were found to include
specific variations unique to thermophiles while chorismate biosynthesis, formaldehyde assimilation, threonine biosynthesis, and valine biosynthesis pathways
were missing from thermophiles in the MetaCyc dataset.
For example, in the chorismate pathway it is known that
many Archaea do have a distinct shikimate kinase [29].
In addition, a new pathway (using a ribulose monophosphate instead of fixating formaldehyde) for the generation of pentoses needed for the chorismate pathway was
recently found in thermophilic Archaea [30].
Another interesting discrepancy between the two trees is
the clustering of Methanosarcina mazei with Halobacteriaceae in the tree that is based on metabolism. This result
can be explained by the fact that Methanosarcina mazei is

Co-evolution of metabolic pathways
We examined our approach for detecting co-evolution of
pathways on a subset of the available pathways that are
known to be shared by many organisms such as amino
acids biosynthesis and degradation, glycolysis, TCA cycle,
and more (a total of 77 pathways; see Figure 3B). These
pathways have instances in most of the 205 organisms we
were considering, which enabled a significant outcome. We
generated a distance matrix between pathways as described
in the previous section and used the Click algorithm [32]
for clustering the pathways according to their corresponding rows in this distance matrix. Based on some
probabilistic assumptions on the input, Click finds both
the number of clusters and the partitioning of elements
into clusters [32].

As can be seen (Figure 3A), two very striking clusters were
observed. Each cluster includes metabolic pathways whose
pages are very similar to each other and are non similar to
pages in the second cluster (Figure 3). Specifically, pathways from the same clusters tend to co-occur in the same
organisms and pathways from different clusters tend to
occur in different organisms. The lists of the pathways in
each cluster appear in Figure 3B. This result suggests that
there is a very strong co-evolution of pathways: even
though there are a few variants in each metabolic pathway
that can theoretically correspond to a large number of
clusters, only two clusters were observed. It encourages
future biological studies about the functional constraints
that shaped the observed co-evolutionary relations.

Conclusion
In this work we describe a new approach for comparing
the metabolism of organisms and for studying

whereas red - dissimilarity. (B) The list of pathways in each cluster; bio is an abbreviation of biosynthesis, deg is an abbreviation
of degradation and is an abbreviation of variation.

co-evolution of metabolic pathways. We show that by
adopting this approach one can gain new interesting
biological conclusions about the evolution of metabolism in sets of organisms.
Naturally, the study presented in this work can be
generalized in various ways. First, when the data in the
various pathway databases will be more reliable and
robust, we shall be able to use our tool to construct a
complete phylogenetic tree based on all the pathways
and organisms in such a database (the same input as in
Figure 1). By using different parameters (deletion score,
the similarity score threshold, and the b parameter),
different trees would be created. These trees could then
be compared to reference trees using e.g. the RobinsonFoulds measure, and that way to determine the best
values for the parameters by picking those yielding the

best match. Furthermore, such a process could enable
comparative studies among the pathway databases
themselves; currently, they are incomparable in several
ways (e.g. the granularity of the pathways, the coverage
of species, and more), making such a study premature.
Another idea for future research is to consider an
alternative method for reconstructing the phylogenetic
trees: it would be to use an iterative process in which the
pages of our 3D array are used - one at a time - to refine
the constructed tree. One could sort the pages by their
specificity, and at each one of the iterations, the next
page would be used in order to refine the distribution of
the organisms, and thus create a new level for the tree.
This way one will be able to distinguish among pathways
that are common to all forms of life, those that delineate
kingdoms and families, all the way to those that

constitute the detailed separation into species and even
strains. Still, such an approach might present problems
in finding the right order for selecting the pathways, and
the method presented in this paper - which considers all
the pathways together - could well prove advantageous.
Finally, we described here a new method for studying coevolution of metabolic pathways. Our approach considers both the set of enzymes in a pathway and the
topology of the pathway. In this work, we demonstrated
this method by analyzing the evolution of 77 reliable
metabolic pathways over 205 organisms. When reliable
data about additional metabolic pathways will be
available it will be interesting to use our approach for
analyzing a larger set of metabolic pathways. It will be
interesting to use such an analysis for comparing the
evolution of entire pathways to the evolution of single
genes (enzymes) that are related to the pathways.
Additionally, a similar approach can be used for
analyzing other cellular biological sub-networks (e.g.
the co-evolution of complexes in protein-protein interaction networks).
