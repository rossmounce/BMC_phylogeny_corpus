Abstract
Background: It can be seen from the available mollusk mitogenomes that the family Pectinidae
exhibits the most variation in genome organization. In this study, comparative mitogenomic
analyses were performed for three scallops from the subfamily Chlamydinae (Pectinidae), with the
goal of characterizing the degree of variability of mitogenome organization and other
characteristics among species from the same subfamily and exploring their possible evolution route.
Findings: The complete or nearly complete mtDNA sequences of scallop Mimachlamys nobilis (17
935 bp), Mizuhopecten yessoensis (20 964 bp) and Chlamys farreri (17 035 bp) were determined using
long PCR amplification and primer walking sequencing strategy. Highly variable size difference of
the three genomes resulted primarily from length and number variations of non-coding regions, and
the major difference in gene content of the three scallop species are due to varying tRNA gene
sets. Only 21, 16, and 17 tRNA genes were detected in the mitogenomes of M. nobilis, M. yessoensis
and C. farreri, respectively. Remarkably, no trnS gene could be identified in any of the three scallops.
A newly-detected trnA-like sequence within the mitogenome of M. yessoensis seems to exemplify
the functional loss of a tRNA gene, and the duplication of trnD in M. yessoensis raises a fundamental
question of whether the retention of the tRNA gene copy of 2-tRNAs is easier than that of 4tRNAs. Analysis of putative evolutionary pathways of gene rearrangement indicates that
transposition of neighboring gene blocks may play an important role in the evolution of
mitogenomes in scallops. Parsimonious analysis of the genomic variations implies that the
mitogenomes of M. yessoensis and C. farreri are likely to derive independently from a common
ancestor that was closely related to M. nobilis.
Conclusion: Comparative mitogenomic analyses among three species from the subfamily
Chlamydinae show that the three genomes exhibit a high level of genomic variation and a diversity
of tRNA gene sets, characterized by extensive translocation of genes. These features provide useful
clues and information for evolutionary analysis of scallop mitogenomes.

Findings
It can be seen from the available mollusk mitogenomes
that the Pectinidae exhibits the most variation in genome
organization. When we were initiating the current study,
three complete or nearly complete mitogenomes, representing three subfamilies, were available from this family,
i.e., Argopecten irradians (Aequipectini group, GenBank:
EU023915), Mizuhopecten yessoensis (Chlamydinae, GenBank: AB271769) and Placopecten magellanicus (Palliolinae, GenBank: DQ088274). Obvious differences in
mitogenome organization of three scallops were
observed: 1) the sizes of three mitogenomes are distinct
from each other, i.e. 16 221 bp for A. irradians, 20 414 bp
for M. yessoensis and 32 115 bp for P. magellanicus [1]; 2)
allegedly, the three mitogenomes have significantly different tRNA gene sets, with the numbers of 22, 32 and 9 for
A. irradians, P. magellanicus and M. yessoensis, respectively;
3) the genomes show distinct gene arrangement patterns,
namely unique rearrangements involving nearly every
gene.
The degree of gene arrangements of mitogenomes from
different species in the same subfamily, Chlamydinae, is
one of our concerns. Therefore, in this study the complete
mtDNA sequences of Mimachlamys nobilis and M. yessoensis, and nearly complete mtDNA sequence of Chlamys farreri are determined using long PCR amplification and
primer walking sequencing strategy (see Additional file
1), and used for comparative analyses. Another reason for
inclusion of M. yessoensis is that its first mitogenome data
deposited in GenBank (AB271769) seems to bear significant omissions and mis-annotations of tRNA genes and
protein-coding gene. Apparently, these mis-annotations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/69

need to be amended for further studies of gene order variation, evolution and phylogenetic analysis.
Genome organization and nucleotide composition
The size of the mitogenome is 17 935 bp for M. nobilis
(GenBank: FJ595958). Due to technical difficulties in
sequencing, a small part (up to a couple of hundreds base
pairs) of the mitogenome of C. farreri was not obtained
and the nearly complete genome is 17 035 bp in length
(GenBank: FJ595957). Genome assembly indicated that
the unfinished section is the start part of the major noncoding region (MNR). The complete mtDNA sequence of
M. yessoensis obtained in this study is 20 964 bp in length
(GenBank: FJ595959), which is 550 bp longer than the
nearly complete genome. Genome assembly indicated
that the previously unfinished section is part of the MNR.
Annotation to the mitogenome obtained in the current
study and a re-annotation to AB271769 revealed the following findings: 1) the "absent" cox2 gene in previous
annotation is actually present, corresponding to nucleotides 14 638–15 325, with "CTG" as initiation codon
and "T" as termination codon; and 2) the genome has a
total of 16 tRNA genes, instead of nine identified in that
nearly complete genome. Additionally, 56 transitions
were detected from a comparison of mitogenomes
FJ595959 and AB271769.

The three mitogenomes contain 12 protein-coding genes
(PCGs), lacking the atp8 gene as in most bivalves, two
ribosomal RNA genes and varying numbers of tRNA gene
set (see Additional file 2; Additional file 3; Additional file
4; Additional file 5; Figure 1). No obvious difference in
gene length was observed among three scallops (Additional file 2); thus, what contributes to the differences in

genome sizes is primarily the number and length of noncoding regions (NCRs). An interesting finding of this
study is the existence of repeat units within the NCR of M.
yessoensis mtDNA (see Additional file 6). The nucleotide
compositions and usage frequencies of entire mitogenome for three scallops have a similar pattern (Additional
file 2). The nucleotide compositions are all strongly
skewed away from C in favor of G (the GC-skews are
0.312, 0.248 and 0.319 separately) and from A in favor of
T (the AT-skews are -0.252, -0.197 and -0.240 respectively) (Additional file 2). The AT content of the three
genomes are 59.6%, 55.3% and 57.9% in M. nobilis, M.
yessoensis, and C. farreri respectively, lower than the average AT content of 16 available bivalves (61.6%), but comparable to that of other two pectinids (57% for A.
irradians; 55.7% for P. magellanicus). Up to date, the five
species within the Pectinidae represent the lowest average
AT content (57.1%) compared to other molluscan lineages (66% for Gastropoda; 69.4 for Polyplacophora;
71.2% for Scaphopoda; 71.7% for Cephalopoda). The AT
contents are slightly higher in rrnL (61.0%, 57.8% and
58% separately) and lower in rrnS (56.7%, 50.6% and
52.5%) than that of each full mitogenome.
Protein-coding genes
Amino acid identity in proteins for pairs of three scallops
ranged from as low as 54.3% in nad2 between M. nobilis
and C. farreri to as high as 93.3% in cox1 between M. yessoensis and C. farreri (Table 1). M. yessoensis and C. farreri
share a higher degree of amino acid similarity in all genes
than do between other pairs. According to our data, it
appears that the most conserved PCGs are cox1, nad1, and
nad3 (identity > 80%), and the least conserved is nad2
(identity = 61.1%).

In this study, most of PCGs in three mitogenomes use
conventional initiation codons (20 for ATG, 10 for ATA
and 1 for ATT), but two genes use the alternative ones (M.
nobilis: nad1-TTG; M. yessoensis: cox2-CTG, nad1-GTG; C.
farreri: cox2-GTG, nad1-GTG). Notably, one of the alternative initiation codons, GTG was also frequently used in
two previously described scallop mitogenomes (5 for A.
irradians and 2 for P. magellanicus). Only two genes use
CTG as an initiation codon in the 45 reported molluscan
mitogenomes (M. yessoensis: cox2; Lottia digitalis: cox1).
Interestingly, six of 12 PCGs in M. yessoensis and C. farreri
show a derived characteristic in their use of initiation
codons when compared with those of M. nobilis, i.e. atp6
(ATA [M. nobilis]→ATG [M. yessoensis and C. farreri]), cox1
(ATA→ATG), cob (ATA→ATG), nad1 (TTG→GTG), nad2
(ATG→ATA) and nad4 (ATG→ATA). In general, the usage
of initiation codons among three scallops is flexible, but
not random.
Three genes stop with identical termination codon in all
three scallops, i.e. nad1 (TAG), nad4 (TAG) and nad4L
(TAA). Five genes (atp6, cox2, cox3, cob and nad2) share the
same termination codon in the mitogenomes of C. farreri
and M. nobili and three genes (cox1, nad3 and nad5) use
the same termination codon in the genomes of M. yessoensis and M. nobilis. The nad6 in M. yessoensis and C. farreri
display the derivative feature of termination codon usage
when compared with that of M. nobilis (TAA [M. nobilis]→TAG [M. yessoensis and C. farreri]). The cox2 gene in
both M. yessoensis and C. farreri contains a truncated termination codon, ending with a single thymine.
Transfer RNA genes
Despite an extensive search with the tRNAscan-SE [2] and
by eye inspection, only 21, 16, and 17 tRNA genes were
detected in the mitogenomes of M. nobilis, M. yessoensis
and C. farreri, respectively (Additional file 7; Additional
file 8; Additional file 9). Particularly, no trnS gene could
be identified in any of the three scallops, and four tRNAs
(trnG, trnV, trnW and trnY) were absent in the mitogenome of both M. yessoensis and C. farreri. Nevertheless, we
presume that the loss of trnW and trnY in the mitogenome
of C. farreri may be an artifact, due to unfinished sequencing of the region downstream of trnH. The loss of trnS may
present the ancestral state for all three scallops of the subfamily Chlamydinae. The loss of the tRNA cluster "GV" in
the mitogenome of M. yessoensis and C. farreri may present
the first step of tRNA gene loss from the common ancestor
of these two species belonging to the same tribe (Chlamydini). Additional derived features of tRNA gene loss and
translocations were observed separately for both M. yessoensis and C. farreri, e.g. the deletions of trnH, trnW, trnY
and trnA, and the duplication of trnD in the mitogenome
of M. yessoensis.

Another interesting finding of this study is the identification of a trnA-like sequence within the mitogenome of M.
yessoensis. For confirmation of this finding, at least three
individuals of M. yessoensis were used separately for amplification and sequencing of this fragment. This trnA-like
structure is just located following the trnC, where the
tRNA gene cluster "CA" has been observed in the mitogenome of both M. nobilis and C. farreri. Alignment of this
trnA-like sequence of M. yessoensis with trnA gene
sequences of other four available scallops (A. irradians, P.
magellanicus, M. nobilis and C. farreri) shows that it shares
similar nucleotide sequences in amino acid arm, DHU
arm, and anticodon arm with those of trnA genes, with a
distinct sequence in the anticodon loop (Figure 2A). We
therefore define this trnA-like genomic region as a pseudotRNA gene (PsA). The existence of PsA may provide evidence of intermediate status of tRNA gene loss. Several
mechanisms have been proposed for tRNA gene loss [35]. In this case, trnA gene loss seems fit the model that
tRNA genes are gradually lost functionally, and then physically, over long evolutionary periods of time. Gene functional loss via mutation of the anticodon loop may play
the most important role in this case.
In the mitogenomes of metazoan, almost all amino acids
codons but leucine and serine are decoded by only one
tRNA each [6]. The presence of two trnM genes was
reported in the mitogenomes of tunicates [7]. However, it
is a common phenomenon that mitogenomes of most
bivalves contain two trnM genes. In this study, the trnM2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/69

gene was found clustered with other tRNA genes, but the
locations of trnM1 were variable over species. Another case
of tRNA gene duplication is the trnD in M. yessoensis,
which is found in single copy in the mitogenomes of both
M. nobilis and C. farreri. Both trnD1 and trnD2 are considered true tRNA genes, based on sequence comparison
(Figure 2B) as well as their putative secondary structures
(Additional file 8). In order to probe into the mechanism
of the retention of two copies of non-trnL/trnS tRNA
genes, we examined the mitogenomes of all available
mollusks for their tRNA gene usage, and found that a total
of eight tRNA genes (trnD, trnE, trnF, trnK, trnM, trnN,
trnQ, trnV) appear in at least two copies for each (see
Additional file 10). Notably, all but trnV have anticodons
corresponding to the 2-fold degenerate codons. This finding raises a fundamental question of whether the retention of the tRNA gene copy of 2-tRNAs is easier than that
of 4-tRNAs (also see [6]). Perhaps there are differences in
the gene loss and import mechanisms from the cytoplasm
to the mitochondria of 4-tRNAs and 2-tRNAs. It is desirable to investigate the mechanisms of tRNA gene loss in
further studies; more mitogenomes with variable tRNA
gene sets should be included in future studies to draw a
solid conclusion.
Putative evolutionary pathway of gene rearrangements
It is often difficult to trace the evolutionary pathway of
metazoan mitogenomes due either to the generally low
number of reorganization events (e.g., mammals) or drastic reorganizations in some animal lineages (e.g., nema-

todes, snails and brachiopods etc; see [8,9]), particularly
in bivalves [e.g., [10,11]]. Phylogentic analyses for five
scallops, using the concatenated amino acid sequences of
12 PCGs, resulted a high supported relationship which
can be depicted as (A. irradians, (P. magellanicus, (M. nobilis, (M. yessoensis, C. farreri)))) (see Additional file 11).
Based on the inferred phylogeny, a putative evolutionary
pathway of gene rearrangement in the three species is
assumed, and our preferred scenario of mitogenome evolution is further elaborated in Figure 3. In detail, there are
at least three permutations between the mitogenomes of
M. nobilis and that of a putative common ancestor of M.
yessoensis and C. farreri: transposition of trnM1; transposition of the tRNA gene cluster "TPIL2M2", and loss of trnG
and trnV. The tRNA gene cluster "HWY" is assumed to
have been present in the putative common ancestor,
based on the fact that trnH is just downstream of nad4 in
C. farreri. Additionally, the absence of trnW and trnY may
be artificial due to the incompletely sequenced downstream region. At least four independent events occurred
in the mt gene rearrangement of M. yessoensis in the proc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/69

ess of derivation from the putative common ancestor:
deletion of the tRNA gene cluster "HWY", transposition of
gene block "cox1-trnC-trnA" with rrnS, duplication of trnD
and the generation of pseudogene PsA. Only one step is
then necessary for the rearrangement of C. farreri from the
common ancestor, i.e. the transposition of the large fragment "trnC-trnA-rrnS-nad5" with its neighbor block
"nad4L-nad6-trnL1-cob".
It has been commonly recognized that variations in gene
order are relatively rare in mitogenomes of most metazoan lineages [8]. Dowton et al. [12] estimated a probability of 1/2664 for a single event of gene translocation
occurring independently in two mitogenomes (starting
from the same gene order in both). However, this probability could be an underestimate according to yet unidentified constraints on modes of gene rearrangements, and it
should be applied cautiously. Pectinid bivalves seem to
represent another example, as five sequenced mitogenomes exhibit significant genomic rearrangements, suggesting that gene rearrangements occurred frequently

the minimum number of gene duplication, deletion and transposition is illustrated. A putative common ancestor of M. yessoensis
and C. farreri is shown as it can be most easily and parsimoniously explained. Putative intermediate gene order between "common ancestral gene order" and "M. yessoensis/C. farreri gene order" is also shown to explain the most parsimoniously possible
evolutionary pathway of these two species. Symbols are explained under the figure and gene abbreviations are designated as in
the text. Genes with identical order in the lineage are put in black/white boxes.

among lineages in this family. On the other hand, high
amino acid sequence identity between M. yessoensis and C.
farreri indicate that these species may have diverged only
recently. As illustrated in Figure 3, transposition of neighbor gene blocks (transposition 1, 3 and 4) may play an
important role in the evolution of scallop mitogenomes.
There is no doubt that mt genomic rearrangements are in
most cases appropriate markers to resolve both ancient
and recent divergence processes [6], but the result of this
study implies that a careful estimation of the rearrangement pathway is especially required in analyzing the
highly variable organizations of mitogenomes in the Pectinidae. However, the scallop mitogenomes with such
diversity in their organization seem to be a good model to
elucidate molecular evolutionary and phylogenetic issues
of mitogenomes in future studies.
