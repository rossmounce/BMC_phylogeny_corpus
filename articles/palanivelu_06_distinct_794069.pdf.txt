Abstract
Background: Pollen tubes deliver sperm after navigating through flower tissues in response to
attractive and repulsive cues. Genetic analyses in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana and cell ablation
studies in Torenia fournieri have shown that the female gametophyte (the 7-celled haploid embryo
sac within an ovule) and surrounding diploid tissues are essential for guiding pollen tubes to ovules.
The variety and inaccessibility of these cells and tissues has made it challenging to characterize the
sources of guidance signals and the dynamic responses they elicit in the pollen tubes.
Results: Here we developed an in vitro assay to study pollen tube guidance to excised A. thaliana
ovules. Using this assay we discerned the temporal and spatial regulation and species-specificity of
late stage guidance signals and characterized the dynamics of pollen tube responses. We established
that unfertilized A. thaliana ovules emit diffusible, developmentally regulated, species-specific
attractants, and demonstrated that ovules penetrated by pollen tubes rapidly release diffusible
pollen tube repellents.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that in vitro pollen tube guidance to excised A. thaliana
ovules efficiently recapitulates much of in vivo pollen tube behaviour during the final stages of pollen
tube growth. This assay will aid in confirming the roles of candidate guidance molecules, exploring
the phenotypes of A. thaliana pollen tube guidance mutants and characterizing interspecies
pollination interactions.

Background
After a pollen grain lands on the surface of the pistil, it
absorbs water from the stigma and forms a pollen tube –
a long polar process that transports all of the cellular contents, including the sperm [1]. Pollen tubes invade the pistil and migrate past several different cell types, growing
between the walls of the stigma cells, travelling through
the extracellular matrix of the transmitting tissue, and
finally arriving at the ovary, where they migrate up the
funiculus (a stalk that supports the ovule), and enter the

micropyle to deliver the two sperm cells-one fertilizes an
egg and other the central cell (Fig. 1a, 1b) [2]. Typically,
only one pollen tube enters the ovule through an opening
called the micropyle, terminates its journey within a synergid cell, and bursts to release sperm cells-a process
defined as pollen tube reception [3].
A combination of genetic and in vitro assays has defined
signals that contribute to the early stages of pollen tube
guidance. Chemocyanin, a small basic protein from lily

two synergid (s) cells that flank an egg cell (e). Upon lysis,
one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to form the zygote and the
other fuses with the central cell (c) to form the endosperm.

stigmas, attracts lily pollen tubes in vitro [4], and in A. thaliana, wild type pollen guidance was abnormal when
grown on stigmas over expressing the A. thaliana chemocyanin homolog [5]. Other signals are active in the nutrient-rich extracellular matrix secreted by the female
transmitting tissue. A pectin that may promote guidance
by mediating adhesion of pollen tubes to this matrix has
been identified in lily [6]. Glycoproteins that likely contribute to guidance have also been described: in lily, a
lipid transfer protein that contributes to adhesion [6], and
in tobacco, two glycoproteins (TTS1 and TTS2) that provide nutritional and guidance cues are known [7,8].
Although potential homologs of these proteins exist in A.
thaliana, their role in pollen tube growth is yet to be determined [6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/7

After emerging from the transmitting tract, pollen tubes
approach the ovule micropyle with remarkable precision.
Mutants defective in pollen tube guidance have demonstrated that this process is controlled by a series of molecular signals that involve pollen tubes, ovule tissues, and
female gametophytes [1]. The A. thaliana mutants, ino [9]
and pop2 [10] point to a role for diploid ovule tissue in
pollen tube guidance; these have aberrant interactions
between pollen tubes and diploid ovule cells, yet their
female gametophytes appear normal, and in the case of
pop2, can be fertilized with wild-type pollen [11]. Pollen
tubes fail to either reach or enter the micropyle in A. thaliana mutants with nonviable or aberrant female gametophytes yet apparently normal diploid ovule tissue,
providing strong support for the role of the haploid germ
unit in promoting growth to the micropyle [12,13]. Based
on these studies, it was proposed that final stages of pollen tube growth can be divided into two distinct phases:
funicular guidance, in which pollen tubes adhere to and
grow up the funiculus, and micropylar guidance, where
pollen tubes enter the micropyle to deliver sperm to the
female gametophyte [13]. Micropylar guidance signals
originate at least in part from the two synergid cells contained within the female gametophyte; pollen tubes do
not enter ovules in which synergid cells were either laser
ablated [14] or defective due to a lesion in A. thaliana
MYB98 gene [15]. The maize EA1 protein, which is exclusively expressed in the egg and synergids of unfertilized
female gametophytes, may specify a role for these cells in
regulating micropylar guidance. Plants expressing EA1
RNAi or antisense constructs produced significantly fewer
seeds than wild type, and wild type pollen tubes failed to
enter mutant ovules [16].
In vitro assays have been used to characterize intracellular
cues such as a Ca2+ gradient at the tip of pollen tubes that
is critical for growth. Disrupting this gradient by iontophoretic microinjection or by incubation with Ca2+ channel blockers can change the direction of tube growth [17].
The Ca2+ gradient in pollen tubes is controlled by Rho
GTPases; injection of antibodies against these proteins
into pollen tubes, or expression of dominant-negative
forms of RhoGTPase, causes the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient
to diffuse and eliminates tube growth [18], presumably by
disrupting F-actin assembly [19]. These pollen tube
growth defects can be partially alleviated by adding high
concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ [18].
In vitro grown pollen tubes also reorient their growth in
response to certain extracellular cues; lily pollen tubes are
attracted to chemocyanin [4] and repelled by a point
source of nitric oxide [20]. In addition, in vitro grown
pearl millet pollen tubes are attracted to ovary extracts
[21]. For T. fournieri pollen tube guidance across a simple
medium and into the ovule was achieved after pollen

aAlthough the same number of ovules were placed in each assay, only
those with a pollen tube tip ≤ 100 µm from the micropyle were
considered potential targets; bnumber of independent in vitro assays;
cexpanded ovules, indicating embryo growth, were collected 1 day
after pollination; dovules immersed in 100°C or 25°C water for 5 min;
tissues present (+) or absent (–) after removal by microdissection
(rows 1 and 4); assays in which pollen tubes germinated and grew

tubes were grown through a stigma and style [22]. In this
species, the female gametophyte protrudes from the
ovule, and pollen tubes enter the micropyle without interacting with funiculus [22]. Thus, the T. fournieri in vitro
guidance system serves as a model for the micropylar, but
not the funicular guidance phase of pollen tube growth to
ovules [23]. Here, we describe an A. thaliana in vitro guidance assay that recapitulates both funicular and micropylar guidance, serving as a model for ovules with encased
female gametophytes, an arrangement that is more common among flowering plants. With the sequenced A. thaliana genome, the large collection of mutants affecting
reproductive functions, and comparative genomic
resources, this assay will greatly facilitate identifying genes
that mediate the final phases of pollen tube guidance.

Results
The A. thaliana stigma and style confer pollen tube
targeting competence
Previous studies indicated that pollen tubes germinated in
a simple growth medium cannot be guided to the micropyle [14,22]. Consistent with these observations, when
such assays are performed for A. thaliana, few ovules are
targeted (~3%, Table 1). Hence, we instead removed the
upper portion of the pistil (the stigma and style
[4,10,14,24]), deposited pollen on the stigma surface and
showed that A. thaliana pollen tubes emerged from the
style, travelled across an agarose medium to excised
ovules and successfully entered the micropyle (Fig. 1a,
1b). To facilitate pollen tube observation, especially after
they enter the micropyle and are obscured by the opaque
ovule integument cells, we transformed plants with a GFP

reporter under the control of the pollen-specific LAT52
promoter [25], and identified GFP-expressing lines with
fully functional pollen tubes. Upon reaching the female
gametophyte, these tubes burst and release a large spot of
GFP (Fig. 1c, 1d, arrowheads and see Additional files 1
and 2), conveniently marking targeted ovules. Pollen
tubes that grew within ~100 µm of an unfertilized ovule
often made a sharp turn toward an ovule; of the tubes that
grew within this range, ~50% successfully entered the
micropyle (Table 1). This targeting efficiency is significantly higher than that of tubes germinated on agarose
(Table 1). Thus, pollen tubes acquire the ability from pistil tissue to perceive ovule guidance signals, perhaps by
absorbing essential nutrients or undergoing critical developmental transitions; a similar phenomenon was
reported in T. fournieri [22]. In some cases, pollen grains
that germinated on the stigma formed tubes that grew
onto the medium, rather than penetrating the pistil and
growing through the style. Nonetheless, these tubes successfully targeted excised ovules, suggesting that interaction with the stigma alone is sufficient to confer pollen
tube guidance competence (Table 1); targeting efficiency
was significantly reduced, however, suggesting that direct
contact with female cells, rather than exposure to diffusible factors in the medium, is most important.
Characterization of A. thaliana pollen tube-ovule
interactions
As tubes left the style, they dispersed (Fig. 1e and see Additional File 1), growing at 2.5 ± 1.0 (s.d) µm/min (n = 20)
and up to 3 mm before reaching an ovule (Fig. 2a–f). Near
a virgin ovule, however, growth rates decreased (1.2 ±
0.59 (s.d) µm/min (n = 20;Fig. 2a–f) and the tubes often
made sharp turns (Fig. 1d, arrows) within 33 ± 20 (s.d)
mm of a micropyle (avg. 60 ± 38° (s.d); n = 60). Pollen
tube guidance to ovules was abolished when fertilized or
heat-treated ovules were used (Table 1), indicating they
release a diffusible, heat-labile attractant prior to fertilization. Tube entry into the ovule appears to be not influenced by the number of tubes near a micropyle; targeting
was achieved regardless of whether one or multiple tubes
were in the vicinity of an ovule (see Additional files 1, 2,
3, 4). When approaching an ovule, the in vitro grown pollen tubes did not always migrate up a funiculus, Fig. 1c)
before entering it. To directly test the role of this tissue, we
removed funiculi from ovules, revealing a small but significant decrease in targeting efficiency (Table 1). These
results indicate that an interaction between the pollen
tube and funiculus is not essential, yet this interaction
enhances successful entry into the ovule, perhaps by i)
providing a physical support for pollen tubes to reach the
micropyle, ii) aiding in the generation and maintenance
of a signal gradient, or iii) enhancing the availability of
ovule-derived guidance signals.

Fig. 2g–l and see Additional files 1 and 2). While previous
work showed that pollen tube growth arrests only after
reaching the female gametophyte [9,10], our observations
point to additional signals that slow growth within the
ovule prior to this arrest. This delay coincides with meandering pollen tube navigation past the integument and

Short-range guidance signals from A. thaliana ovules are
developmentally regulated
The data presented above indicate that contact with A.
thaliana stigmas and styles enables pollen tubes to
respond to diffusible ovule signals. To understand the
nature and source of these signals, we examined their
activity during ovule development. Previously it was
shown that pollen tubes grow randomly or fail to elongate
in immature A. thaliana pistils [26]. However, it was
impossible to distinguish the contributions of distinct tissues in these experiments. Here, we exploited the modular
nature of the in vitro system, varying the age of stigmas,
styles, and ovules. While mature flower parts (stage 14
[27] were optimal, the stage of ovule development was
critical, with guidance factors completely absent at ~32
hrs (stage 12a) and lower at ~16–24 hrs (stages 12b–c)
before flowers mature (Table 2, upper panel). This pattern
correlates with synergid development, the suggested
source of pollen tube attractants; these cells form after
stage 12a [27,28]. Even so, immature ovules promote better pollen tube guidance than heat-treated or fertilized
ovules, suggesting that a basal signalling capability is
established early and increases as the female gametophyte
differentiates. In contrast, the developmental stage of the
stigma and style did not significantly alter targeting (χ2; P
> 0.1; Table 2, bottom panel), indicating that the signals

that confer targeting competence to pollen tubes do not
vary over the course of pistil maturation (stages 12a–18)
and that they emerge as early as stage 12a.
Short-range guidance signals from ovules are highly
species-specific
Like many traits that mediate reproduction [29,30], pollen tube guidance signals diverge rapidly – crosses
between A. thaliana and its relatives show random or
arrested pollen tube growth, even among species separated by <25 million years, MY [13,31]. Because these
interspecies crosses utilized intact pistils, it has been
impossible to discern the roles of individual tissues; moreover, early blocks in pollen tube migration have often
made it difficult to assess interactions at downstream
stages, including those near ovules. Here, we examined
whether the stigma, style and ovule-derived signalling
interactions are shared among A. thaliana relatives separated by ~5, 10, or 20 MY [31] (Table 3). The ability of the
stigma and style to promote pollen tube competence was
highly conserved (χ2; P > 0.05; Table 3, bottom panel),
while the ovule-derived attractant diverged rapidly (χ2; P
< 0.01; Table 3, upper panel). For example, A. thaliana
pollen tubes inefficiently target ovules from Arabidopsis
arenosa (separated by 5 MY from A. thaliana), rarely target
Olimarabidopsis pumila ovules (10 MY), and fail to target
Capsella rubella or Sysimbrium irio ovules (10 and 20 MY,
respectively, Table 3, upper panel). Because C. rubella and
S. irio are challenging to transform, it was not possible to
test whether ovules from these two species are able to
guide self-pollen expressing GFP under our assay conditions. Nonetheless, the ability of A. thaliana pollen to target ovules correlated with phylogenetic separation [30],
suggesting that A. thaliana pollen tubes are sufficiently
diverged that they fail to recognize attractants from C.
rubella and S. irio ovules. Unlike the calcium signals that
emanate from synergids [32,33], the proposed source of

micropylar guidance signals, our results point to a diffusible, heat-labile ovule-derived signal that is sufficiently
complex for rapid divergence – criteria that are most consistent with a protein-based signal. Pollen tubes perceive
this signal at a distance of ~100µm from ovules after a 5
hour incubation in the assay. To estimate the molecular
weight of this signal, we measured the diffusion rates of
fluorescently-labelled dextran molecules under the same
conditions in which the in vitro assay was performed, and
calculated that the ovule-derived signal could measure up
to approximately 85 kD (see methods).
Targeted A. thaliana ovules repel supernumerary pollen
tubes in vitro
Interestingly, while the ovule-derived attractant in the in
vitro assay acted to guide multiple pollen tubes toward
ovules, only one pollen tube gained access to each micropyle. This is reminiscent of polyspermy blocks in vivo,
where only one tube generally migrates up the funiculus
and into the ovule [13]. While the mechanisms that prevent multiple tubes from even approaching an ovule are
highly efficient, it is nonetheless possible for more than
one pollen tube to enter a micropyle. In wild-type maize,
heterofertilization results when the egg and central cell are
fertilized by different pollen tubes at a frequency of ~1/50
[34] and in A. thaliana, ~1% (wild type) and ~10% (feronia) of ovules are penetrated by multiple pollen tubes [3].
When we performed the in vitro assay with fertilized
ovules, many tubes grew within 100 µm, but none entered
(Table 1), suggesting that the release of the ovule attractant terminates after fertilization, or alternatively, that a
new signal repels additional pollen tubes. To distinguish
between these possibilities, we used time-lapse imaging
analysis (Fig. 3 and see Additional files 3 and 4). While
44% of targeted ovules (n = 143) were approached by
additional pollen tubes, in every instance, these tubes did
not enter the micropyle. Repelled tubes either stalled near
the micropyle or turned sharply away from the targeted
ovule (84 ± 42°; n = 61, Fig. 2e–h and see Additional files
3 and 4), a response that was observed as early as 10 min
after a successful targeting event. This effect was fairly
short-range; only tubes that approached within 27 ± 22
(s.d) µm were repelled. The diffusion rate of a series of
dextran molecules through the medium used in this assay
allowed us to estimate that a repellent measuring <10kD
could diffuse ~27 µm in 10 minutes. Such abrupt turning
behaviours were not observed when a single tube
approached a virgin ovule. Instead, these tubes changed
their growth direction by 60 ± 38° (s.d; n = 60), migrating
toward, and not away, from the micropyle.

In the A. thaliana female sterile feronia and sirene mutants,
wild type pollen tubes enter the mutant ovules but fail to
cease growth or burst. In addition to this defect, multiple
pollen tubes gain access to feronia and sirene mutant

ovules [3,35]. Based on these results, it was suggested that
repulsion of supernumerary tubes does not initiate until
pollen tube reception occurs. Our observations with wild
type pollen tubes in this in vitro assay indicate this is not
the case – repulsion responses occurred well before tube
growth terminated or tubes released their cytoplasm (n =
50, Fig. 3j, 3n and see Additional files 3 and 4). Moreover,
while previous work suggested that female gametophyte
cells release an inhibitory signal [3,35], our results show
that repulsion initiated soon after the pollen tubes
entered the micropyle and long before they reached the
female gametophyte (Fig. 3 and see Additional files 3 and

4). Thus, this work points to a diffusible repulsive signal
that is sufficient to override the ovule attractant. This signal may be derived directly from the diploid cells that surround the micropyle, from the female gametophyte, or
from the successfully targeted, but unlysed, pollen tubes.

Conclusion
Based on the results described here, we have defined three
signaling events that regulate pollen tube guidance in A.
thaliana: i) contact-mediated competence conferred by the
stigma and style, ii) diffusible ovule-derived attractants
and iii) repellents exuded from recently-targeted ovules.

The species specificity and diffusion properties of the
ovule attractant are consistent with a protein signal, while
the abrupt transmission and response to the repellent suggests the activity of a small molecule, a peptide, or posttranslational modifications to signals present before fertilization. This investigation also provides a platform to
confirm the roles of candidate guidance molecules and to
explore the phenotypes of A. thaliana mutants, including
those that affect the development of diploid [9,10] and
haploid [3,16,35] female tissues or pollen tubes [36]. The
ability to characterize interspecies pollination interactions
with this assay could lead to improvements in generating
novel plant hybrids, a process that often requires in vitro
manipulations [37].

Methods
Plant growth and material
Pollen was derived from LAT52:GFP transgenic lines
(Columbia background). Stigmas, styles, and ovules were
from the A. thaliana male sterile mutant, ms1 (CS75,
Landsberg background) or from A. arenosa (CS3901), O.
pumila (CS22562), C. rubella (CS22561) and S. irio
(CS22653), deposited in the A. thaliana Biological
Resources Center, Ohio State University. Female structures are unaffected by ms1, making it a convenient source
of virgin pistils without the need for emasculation. No difference was detected between assays performed with
materials derived from the Landsberg or Columbia ecotypes (not shown). Seeds were sown in soil and stratified
at 4°C for 2 days, and plants were grown under fluorescent light (100 µE) for 16 or 24 hrs/day at 40% humidity.
To consistently isolate pistils of varying developmental
stages, we correlated the initial day of flowering of our
plant population with previously defined floral development stages [26]. First, we confirmed that the youngest
open flower is similar to stage 14 [26]. In A. thaliana, flowers continuously arise at the floral apex and are arranged
in a spiral, with the younger buds on the inside. This predictable pattern allowed us to select stage 14 flowers as a
starting point and identify older flowers (up to stage 18)
and younger buds (up to 12a).
In vitro pollen tube guidance assay
Growth medium for in vitro manipulations of pollen
tubes [10] was determined to be optimal for also growing
pollen tubes through a cut pistil. For the in vitro assays
described here, pollen growth medium (3 ml) was poured
into a 35 mm petri dish (Fisher Scientific, Hampton,
USA). This volume of medium was ideal both for pollen
tube growth and for microscopically viewing the interactions between pollen tubes and ovules. Excised pistils
were pollinated under a dissection microscope (Zeiss
Stemi 2000), cut with surgical scissors at the junction
between the style and ovary (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA), and placed horizontally on pollen

growth medium. Pollen tubes emerged from the pistil ~3
hours after pollination and dispersed along the agarose
surface for up to ~3 mm from the pistil.
Unlike previous reports [12,18], ovules were excised dry
under a dissection microscope with a 27.5 gauge needle,
from pistils that were held horizontally on double-sided
tape (Scotch brand, 3M, St. Paul, USA). Excised ovules
were immediately placed on the pollen growth medium,
~2 mm from the pistil, a distance that was typically accessible by the emerging pollen tubes. To maximize pollen
tube-ovule interactions, 8–10 ovules were placed at the
base of a pistil as shown in Fig. 1d. Because pollen tubes
tend to disburse and grow randomly after leaving the
style, not all ovules, particularly those placed near the cut
pistil, are visited by a pollen tube (Fig. 1e).
For time-lapse imaging, ovules were placed with their
micropylar end closest to the pistil excision site. Although
not essential for targeting, ovules were oriented in this
manner to reduce the time elapsed before targeting was
achieved. In vitro assays were typically performed by completely coating stigmas of cut pistils with pollen (>100
grains per stigma); in contrast, for the repulsion assays
only 20–30 pollen grains were deposited per stigma, making it possible to clearly observe individual tube behaviour. Based on experiments with limited amounts of
pollen, we typically observed 50–80% of the pollen grains
produced tubes that emerged from the style.
LAT52:GFP transgenic plants
A HindIII fragment encoding GFP expressed from a postmeiotic, pollen-specific LAT52 promoter [25], was cloned
into PBI121 (Clonetech, CA) and introduced into A. thaliana (Columbia) plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Kanamycin-resistant transgenic plants were
selected, and a line containing a single transgene insertion, based on segregation of kanamycin resistance and
GFP, was chosen for this study. This line had no detectable
reproductive defects.
Microscopy
Ovules targeted by pollen tubes in the in vitro assay were
counted under a Zeiss fluorescent dissecting stereoscope.
For calculating targeting efficiencies, we included only
ovule micropyles within 100µm of a growing pollen tube;
within this range pollen tubes exhibited responses that are
typical for cells undergoing attraction: significant reorientation of growth towards the signal source, followed by a
steady advance towards the target. For time-lapse fluorescent microscopy, GFP-labelled pollen tubes were
observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fitted with an automated shutter, motorized stage and CCD camera (CoolSNAP fxHQ, Roper Scientific, Inc Tucson, AZ). Images
were captured at 10-minute intervals, converted to a TIFF

format per the manufacturer's instructions using Slidebook (Intelligent Innovations Imaging, Santa Monica,
CA). Pollen tube behaviours (growth rate, angle of turning, distance from micropyle) were measured and images
were assembled into movies using ImageJ image analysis
software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html).

In vitro pollen tube guidance assay monitors ovule targeting by pollen
tubes. Time-lapse imaging of GFP-tagged pollen tubes emerging from the
cut portion of the pistil, travelling across the agarose medium before
approaching a subset of excised ovules. In this instance, pollen tubes grew
within 100 µm only near two of the six ovules; of these two, only one was
successfully targeted.

Diffusion rates
To estimate the size of pollen tube signalling molecules,
we performed time-lapse imaging of diffusion of a series
of fluorescein-conjugated dextrans (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) ranging in molecular weight from 3 to 70 kD on the
pollen growth medium used for performing the in vitro
pollen tube guidance assay. We dissolved each dextran
compound in pollen growth medium, and spotted 2 ul
each of 10 ng/ul and 100 ng/ul onto pollen tube guidance
assay plates. Time-lapse imaging was performed as
described for in vitro pollen tube behaviours except that
images were captured once in 30 minutes. The rates of diffusion (3 kD = 5.5µm/min; 10 kD = 2.73 µm/min; 40 kD
= 2.43 µm/min and 70 kD = 1.01 µm/min) were measured from these images using ImageJ software. Specifically, the fluorescent intensities along a line drawn from
the centre of a dextran spot to the diffused periphery were
calculated for an entire time-lapse series. The data was
imported into Microsoft Excel and regression analyses
were performed. Extrapolating from these values, molecular weights were estimated for attractants that would diffuse 33 µm and repellents that would diffuse 27 µm in
300 minutes (the time required for a typical pollen tube
to reach an ovule in the in vitro assay).

GFP-tagged tube entering and navigating within the ovule. The growth
rate of the pollen tube decreases substantially before and soon after entry.
Within the ovule, pollen tube ceases growth presumably in one of the synergids and tube discharge occurs, leaving a visible GFP spot.

Pollen tube repulsion by a targeted ovule, example 2. Three pollen tubes
approach an ovule, however the pollen tube that arrived at the micropyle
first was successful. The unsuccessful tubes approached the micropyle;
however, one of them turned away from it, while the other one skips the
micropyle and grows over the successful tube and stalls. The repulsion
behaviors initiate well ahead of pollen tube discharge within ovule.

Statistical analysis
To measure the significance of the differences among
observed ovule targeting efficiencies, we employed a χ2
test for consistency in observed frequency distributions
with a dichotomous classification and variable sample
size [38].
