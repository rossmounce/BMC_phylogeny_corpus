Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small, non-coding RNAs approximately 21nucleotides in length, have become a major focus of research in molecular biology. Mammalian
miRNAs are proposed to regulate approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes. Previous studies
have focused on highly conserved miRNAs, but nonconserved miRNAs represent a potentially
important source of novel functionalities during evolution.
Results: An analysis of the chromosome distribution of miRNAs showed higher densities of
miRNAs on the X chromosome compared to the average densities on autosomes in all eight
mammalian species analyzed. The distribution pattern did not, however, apply well to species
beyond mammals. In addition, by comparing orthologous human and mouse miRNAs, we found
that X-linked miRNAs had higher substitution rates than autosomal miRNAs. Since the highest
proportion of X-linked miRNAs were found in mouse testis, we tested the hypothesis that testis
miRNAs are evolving faster on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Mature X-linked testis
miRNAs had an average substitution rate between mouse and human that was almost 25-fold
higher than mature testis miRNAs on autosomes. In contrast, for mature miRNAs with precursors
not expressed in testis, no significant difference in the substitution rate between the X
chromosome and autosomes was found. Among mammals, the rapid evolution of X-linked testis
miRNAs was also observed in rodents and primates.
Conclusion: The rapid evolution of X-linked testis miRNAs implies possible important male
reproductive functions and may contribute to speciation in mammals.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are families of small, non-coding
RNAs that are approximately 21-nucleotide in length.
Non-coding RNAs have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in metazoans and
plants, and thus have become a major focus of research.
By base pairing to mRNAs, miRNAs mediate translational
repression or mRNA degradation [1]. Bioinformatics pre-

diction indicates that mammalian miRNAs may regulate
~30% of all protein-coding genes [2]. Functional studies
indicate that miRNAs participate in the regulation of
almost every cellular process investigated to date [3-7].
Until now, most research has focused on highly conserved
miRNAs. Most current computational methods for the
prediction of miRNA genes rely heavily on phylogenetic

conservation of sequences, but nonconserved miRNAs
represent a potentially important source of novel functions during evolution. In this study, we analyzed the
genomic distribution of miRNAs and found higher densities of miRNAs on the mammalian X chromosome. Evolutionary analysis of miRNAs suggests rapid evolution of
X-linked miRNAs, which may be related to their function
in testis.

Results
Distribution of miRNAs on chromosomes in mammalian
and other species
Using miRNA data from the miRBase database we calculated the densities of miRNAs on chromosomes and
found no miRNA on the Y chromosome in any species.
Therefore, for subsequent distribution analysis of miRNAs
on sex chromosomes, only the X chromosome was considered. By comparing the densities of miRNAs on the X
chromosome and the average densities on autosomal
chromosomes, we found a higher density of miRNAs on X
chromosomes in mammalian species. In seven of eight
mammalian species, the densities were greater than twofold those on autosomes (Fig. 1). A paired Student's t-test
confirmed significantly higher densities of miRNAs on X
chromosome than those on autosomal chromosomes,
across mammalian species (p < 0.01).

The XX/XY system is one of the most common sex-determination systems and is found in the vast majority of

mammals. To better examine the differences of miRNA
densities between X chromosomes and autosomes, we calculated the density distributions in species beyond mammals, and found a ratio of 0.52 in mosquito and 0.94 in
fruitfly. In addition, we calculated the distribution of miRNAs in chicken, which has the ZW sex-determination system, in which females have two different kinds of
chromosomes (ZW), and males have two of the same kind
(ZZ). We found no miRNA on the W chromosome, and a
ratio of densities between the Z chromosome and autosomes of 0.64, a value less then 1, meaning that chicken
has lower miRNA densities on the sex chromosome. Thus,
it seems that mammals have higher densities of miRNAs
on the X chromosome, but this phenomenon does not
extend to all species. In fact, species other than mammals
may even have reversed density distributions.
Rapid evolution of X-linked miRNAs in mammals
The precursor miRNA substitution rates between human
and mouse were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter
model. Comparison of substitution rates showed significantly higher rates for X-linked than for autosomal precursor miRNAs (p = 0.0054) (Fig. 2). The average
substitution rates were 0.138 and 0.089, respectively. In
addition, we calculated the substitution rates for mature
miRNAs, which are the functional part of precursor miRNAs. The substitution rates for X chromosome and autosomes were significantly different (p = 6.9E-5), at 0.091
and 0.043, respectively. The ratio of mature miRNAs
between the X chromosome and autosomes (2.1 fold) was
greater than that of precursors (1.5 fold).

Tissue distribution of X-linked miRNAs in mouse
Landgraf et al. [8] constructed a mammalian microRNA
expression atlas based on a multi-laboratory effort to
sequence small RNA libraries. We used the data to analyze
the expression of X-linked mature miRNAs across different tissues in mouse. For 15 different mouse tissues, we
found the highest number of X-linked mature miRNAs in
testis. The proportion of X-linked mature miRNAs was
also highest in testis. For the 169 mature miRNAs identified from mouse testis whose genomic loci were mapped,
31 (18.3%) of them were from the X chromosome. (Fig.
3)
Rapid evolution of mammalian X-linked testisexpressedmiRNAs
Because the testis contains the highest proportion of Xlinked miRNAs in mouse, we separated miRNAs into two
genome-wide classes: those with evidence of expression in
mouse testis, and those without. Presently, mouse is the
species with most comprehensive data of miRNAs in testis. In addition to the Landgraf et al.'s miRNA atlas[8], Ro
et al. [9] also cloned mouse testis miRNAs. To achieve a
higher coverage of testis-expressed miRNAs, both two
datasets were used. For a total of 609 mature miRNAs, 548
were unique to a precursor and used for analysis, and of
these, 181 were annotated as expressed in testis. Comparison of 145 testis-expressed mature miRNAs with their
human orthologs showed a significantly higher substitution rate for X-linked mature miRNAs than for autosomal
mature miRNAs (Kimura80 distance: 0.1417 and 0.0056,
respectively; ratio: 25.2, p-value < 0.01) (Fig. 4). The difference for testis-expressed mature miRNAs was almost
25-fold, so non-testis mature miRNAs were analyzed for

similar differences. For 157 mature miRNAs with precursors not expressed in testis and with orthologs in human,
the substitution rate difference between the X chromosome and autosomes was not significantly different
(Kimura80 distance: 0.082 and 0.091, respectively; ratio:
0.89, p-value > 0.05). Thus, the higher substitution rates
seen in testis-expressed mature miRNAs correlated with
their testis expression (Fig. 4).
To better characterize the evolution of testis-expressed
miRNAs, we compared the testis-expressed precursor miRNAs and found their substitution rates were also higher
on the X chromosome than on autosomes (p-value <
0.05). After dividing the precursor into four parts: terminal loop, upper stem region, lower stem region and basal
segments, we found significant differences (p < 0.05) for
the terminal loop, upper stem region and lower stem
region. For miRNAs not expressed in testis, neither the
entire precursor nor any of the four parts showed a significant difference between the X chromosome and autosomes (Fig. 5A–B).
We did additional analyses to see if the phenomenon of
rapid evolution of X-linked testis miRNAs existed in the
primate and rodent branches of mammals. For orthologous miRNA sequences between mouse and rat, X-linked
testis precursor miRNAs evolved faster than those on
autosomes, with a significant difference (p < 0.01). The
upper stem regions and loops of testis precursor miRNAs
also showed higher substitution rates on X chromosome
than on autosomes (p < 0.01). In primates, the Kimura 2parameter substitution rates between human and
macaque were higher for X-linked testis precursor miR-

Comparison

substitution rates for precursor miRNAs on the X chromosome and autosomes, as well as their four parts, were compared.
For testis precursor miRNAs, substitution rate comparisons were performed for human and mouse orthologs (A), for mouse
and rat (C), and for human and macaque (E). The same analysis was performed for precursor miRNAs not expressed in testis
(B, D and F, respectively). The names used are: precursor, precursor miRNA; ustem, upper stem region; loop, terminal loop;
bseg, basal segments. Significant differences are indicated with * (p < 0.05) or ** (p < 0.01).

NAs than for autosomal testis ones (p < 0.01), and the
substitution rates were also higher in the upper stem
regions for X-linked testis miRNAs (p < 0.01). For miRNAs
not expressed in testis, the Kimura 2-parameter distances
of precursor miRNAs in both rodents and primates
showed no difference between the X chromosome and
autosomes (Fig. 5C–F). The prediction of orthologous
sequences used is given in Methods [see Additional file 1].
Testis expression data for human and macaque were from

the human miRNA tissue distribution data in the miRNA
atlas by Landgraf et al. [8].
Target gene analysis of X-linked miRNAs
Target genes of X-linked miRNAs, in both testis and nontestis, were predicted by TargetScan, which uses sequence
conservation information across mammals. Although
some X-linked miRNAs have non-conserved seed
sequences, for many miRNAs, the prediction of non-conPage 4 of 8

served targets will yield substantial false positives that
could hinder meaningful functional comparison between
target gene sets. Thus, only X-linked miRNAs with conserved sequences at nucleotides 2–8 were used for target
gene analysis. Using this criterion, six X-linked testis miRNAs and 16 X-linked non-testis miRNAs were analyzed.
Comparison of enriched biological process terms between
target gene sets of X-linked testis miRNAs and X-linked
non-testis miRNAs showed that the most enriched four
terms exclusively in target gene set of X-linked testis miRNAs were cell cycle, cell cycle process, regulation of progression through cell cycle and regulation of cell cycle [see
Additional file 2], which indicated the important roles of
X-linked testis miRNAs in the cell cycle.

Discussion
The mammalian sex chromosomes arose from autosomal
progenitors approximately 300 million years ago. Before
then, sex determination probably relied on environmental cues such as egg incubation temperature, as is the case
in many extant reptiles [10]. Ross et al. [11] confirmed
that much of the long arm of the human X is homologous
to the short arm of chicken chromosome 4, whereas most
of the short arm of human X matches a stretch of chicken
chromosome 1. The bird sex chromosomes Z and W, on
the other hand, show homology to human chromosome
9. These observations demonstrate the independent origins of genetic sex determination in mammals and birds.
Furthermore, comparison of the human and dog X chromosomes indicates that the gene order largely represents
that of the ancestral X. There is also remarkable synteny of
the X chromosome between human, mouse and rat [11].
Distribution analysis of miRNAs across chromosomes
showed that densities of miRNAs on X were higher than
the average densities on autosomes for eight mammals
analyzed, including human, mouse, rat and dog. However, this difference between chromosomes does not necessarily exist in species outside mammals. The density of
miRNAs on the mosquito X chromosome was about half
that of autosomes. For chicken, whose sex chromosome
has origin different from mammalian sex chromosome,
the density of miRNAs on the Z chromosome was lower
than that on autosomes. It should be noted that miRNAs
from some of the analyzed species such as cow, dog and
chicken, have not been fully identified, which may cause
potential bias in miRNA density analysis. As more comprehensive miRNA databases are available for the species
analyzed here, and others, it will be possible to test
whether this is a widely existing phenomenon. According
to current data, however, the higher density of miRNAs on
X implies that the X-linked miRNAs may have certain Xrelated properties or functions in mammals.
Analysis of substitution rates of genome-wide orthologous precursor and mature miRNAs between human and
mouse showed that the rates were higher on the X chromosome. With the available comprehensive testis miRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/97

data in mouse and the hints that mouse testis contains the
largest number and highest proportion of X-linked
mature miRNAs, we found the substitution rate difference
between X and autosomes was evident only for testisexpressed mature and precursor miRNAs. The difference
disappeared for mature and precursor miRNAs not
expressed in testis. By dividing precursor miRNAs into
four parts, differences were observed for upper stem parts,
terminal loops and lower stem parts. In addition, the phenomenon of faster evolution for X-linked testis precursor
miRNAs was also seen in rodents and primates by comparing orthologous miRNA sequences between mouse
and rat, and between human and macaque. Differences
for upper stem parts of precursor miRNA were significant
in all comparisons between X-linked testis miRNAs and
autosomal testis miRNAs. Upper stems are functional
parts of precursor miRNAs. Their rapid evolution in Xlinked testis precursor miRNA implies that they may play
important roles in testis function. Chromosomal location
alone does not explain the differences in substitution rate.
Sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes have been a central focus of research in many areas of evolutionary biology, and there are conflicting evidences as to whether the
evolutionary rate of the X chromosome is accelerated or
reduced compared with that of autosomes [12]. One theory is that there are greater selective constraints on the Xlinked genes than on autosomal genes, as any recessive
deleterious mutations will be expressed in males and may
be subject to stronger purifying selection [13]. However,
there are certain conditions where genes on the X chromosome can evolve faster than those on autosomes. If the
majority of new mutations are beneficial and are at least
partially recessive, haploid expression in the heterogametic sex will result in higher rates of sequence divergence
[14]. Two studies support the second scenario of faster X
evolution due to an increased likelihood of positive selection or a selective sweep of beneficial recessive mutations
on the X chromosome. First, reduced polymorphism on
the X chromosome has been reported in Drosophila simulans, suggesting that a form of positive selection may be
acting on sex chromosomes [15]. Second, a recent study of
X-linked and sex-biased protein-coding gene evolution in
Drosophila provided the evidence for increased adaptive
evolution of X-linked genes, consistent with a fast-X effect.
This study also revealed a strong fast-X effect for malebiased genes and a weak, but significant, fast-X effect for
unbiased genes [16]. These results suggest the frequent
occurrence of recessive beneficial mutations. Although
many similar studies have been done on the evolution of
protein-coding genes, little has been reported for noncoding genes, especially the important miRNA genes.
In this study, high substitution rates between orthologous Xlinked miRNAs from human and mouse were observed, and
a general pattern of rapid evolution was shown for mammalian X-linked testis-expressed miRNA genes. Additionally,

Zhang et al. [17] have reported that three human X-linked
testis miRNAs, miR-513-1, miR-508 and miR-510, have an
excess of substitutions over neutrality and are under positive
selection. This phenomenon is consistent with and supported by Rice's hypothesis [18], which states that because
males carry a single X chromosome, any recessive allele arising on the X that gives males a reproductive advantage is
immediately available for positive selection [19]. Thus, there
is a possibility that X-linked testis miRNA may have important reproductive functions in males and their fast evolution
may contribute to mammalian speciation.
Spermatogenesis in testis involves massive and continuous
cell division, from mitosis of spermatogonia to meiosis of
spermatocytes. This leads to approximately 40 million
sperm per testis daily in a sexually mature mouse [20].
Gene ontology annotation of the target genes of X-linked
miRNAs showed that the most enriched terms exclusively
in targets of testis X-linked miRNAs were related to the cell
cycle process. The enrichment of these target genes by Xlinked testis miRNAs implied that these testis miRNAs
might participate in regulation of mitosis of spermatogonia
and/or meiosis of spermatocytes and consequently be
important for the regulation of spermatogenesis. In a recent
research report, male mice lacking Dicer1, which is required
for miRNA processing, specifically in germ cells were subfertile. During the initial wave of spermatogenesis, testes
were approximately 50% smaller than those of wild type
littermates, had a decreased number of germ cells and contained many Sertoli-cell only tubules [21]. The loss of Xlinked testis miRNAs with predicted functions in cell cycle
regulation may contribute to these defects.

Conclusion
We have shown that testis-expressed miRNAs on the Xchromosome are highly diverged compared with those on
autosomes for mouse, rat, human and macaque comparisons. Sexual selection can influence sex gene-pool evolution by broad-sense sexual selection and may not be
limited to secondary sexual traits and mating behavior
[22]. The hemizygosity of the X chromosome, X-autosomal interaction, the higher proportion of X-linked miRNAs in testis, and stronger antagonistic and/or adaptive
sexual selection in the male, can all collectively drive evolution of testis miRNAs that are X-linked, at a faster rate
than those that are autosomal. In the future, it would be
of great interest to work out the developmental pathways
by which these miRNAs function and the biological significance of their rapid pace of evolution.

Methods
Comparison of miRNA densities on the X chromosome
andautosomes
The genome coordinates of miRNAs on chromosomes
were from miRBase Release 12.0 http://micro
rna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/ftp.shtml[23]. Densities of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/97

chromosomal miRNAs were calculated by dividing the
number of miRNAs on the X chromosome or all autosomes by the length of nucleotides on the corresponding
chromosomes for all species analyzed except chicken, for
which the Z chromosome was used instead of X chromosome. Species whose genomic sequences are not assembled into chromosomes in the public databases were not
used. Species used in the analysis were human (Homo sapiens, NBCI36), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PANTRO2.1),
macaque (Macaque mulatta, MMUL1.0), mouse (Mus musculus, NCBIM37), rat (Rattus norvegicus, RGSC 3.4), opossum (Monodelphis domestica, MONDOM5.0), cow (Bos
Taurus, BTAU4.0), dog (Canis familiaris, CanFam 2.0),
chicken (Gallus gallus, WASHUC2), mosquito (Anopheles
gambiae, AgamP3), and fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster,
BDGP 5.0).
Orthologous miRNA prediction
The mouse miRNA data used were from miRBase Release
11.0 http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/[23]. Rat
orthologs of mouse miRNAs were predicted using MULTIZ, a sequence alignment program that accurately aligns
vertebrate genomes in the ncRNA regions. MULTIZ
assumes that all matching segments occur in the same
order and orientation in the given sequences by synteny.
[24,25]. To further improve the quality of ortholog prediction, we kept only the predicted rat miRNAs that could be
mapped to the same miRNA in mouse, that is, the rat and
mouse orthologs that reciprocally mapped to each other
using MULTIZ. Predicted rat miRNAs were filtered with
thresholds of RNA secondary folding energy at -20 kcal/
mole (mfold) and 80% sequence length coverage [26,27].
The human orthologs of mouse miRNAs were predicted
using the same strategy, as was prediction of macaque
orthologs of human miRNAs except that blastz genome
sequence alignment [28] was used to map predicted
macaque ortholog sequences to human as no pre-computed MULTIZ alignments for macaque was available. The
human miRNA data used were from miRBase Release
11.0. The UCSC genome databases [29] were used for
sequence analysis, including the Human Mar. 2006
(hg18), the Rhesus Jan. 2006 (rheMac2), the Rat Nov.
2004 (rn4) and the Mouse Jul. 2007 (mm9) assemblies.
The pre-computed genome sequence alignments were
from the UCSC genome browser [30].
Calculation of the substitution rates of miRNAs
betweenspecies
The orthologous sequences of two species were aligned by
ClustalX. The Kimura 2-parameter model was used to calculate substitution rates (Kimura80 distance) of the precursor miRNAs and mature miRNAs [31]. For precursor
miRNAs, the secondary structure was predicted by mfold
[27]. The pre-miRNA sequences were divided into terminal loop, upper stem, lower stem and basal segments as

described before [32]. The substitution rates of each part
were also calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model.

miRNA expression datasets
The multi-tissue mouse miRNA expression data were from
a mammalian miRNA expression altas based on small
RNA library sequencing [8]. Additional mouse testis
miRNA profiling data [9] were used to improve the comprehensiveness of testis miRNA expression. We determined the expression of a precursor miRNA in a given
tissue according to its mature miRNAs. A precursor
miRNA was determined to be expressed in testis when
expression of a corresponding mature miRNA unique to
this precursor was found. If a precursor miRNA had only
one mature miRNA expressed in the testis, but it is not
unique to this precursor, expression was treated as indeterminant.
Target prediction and gene ontology analysis
Target gene analysis was performed using Targetscan 4.2
server
http://www.targetscan.org/vert_42/seed
match.html[2], which uses nucleotides 2–8 of an miRNA
as input. It uses TargetScanS to predict biological targets of
annotated miRNAs by searching for the presence of 7- and
8-mer sites that match the seed region of each miRNA. A
gene with conserved sites in human, mouse, rat and dog
was considered a target. Only miRNAs with conserved
nucleotides 2–8 in human, mouse, rat and dog was used
for analysis; miRNAs without unique nucleotides at 2–8
were excluded because TargetScan cannot differentiate target genes for these miRNAs.
