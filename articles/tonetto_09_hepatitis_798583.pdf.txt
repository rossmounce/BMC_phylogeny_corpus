Abstract
Background: Knowledge of HBV genotype is very important for clinical treatment. Studies have
suggested possible pathogenic and therapeutic differences among HBV genotypes. The aim of this
study was to determine HBV subtypes and genotypes in HBV-infected patients in our region
(southeast Brazil) and to correlate results with clinical and histopathological data.
Methods: One hundred and thirty-nine HBsAg-positive patients were included in the study. All
patients were anti-HCV and anti-HIV negative (64% male; mean age 42 ± 14.5 years; range 7-80
years; 84% Caucasian) and were followed up at the University Hospital. A method for genotyping
and subtyping HBV by partial HBsAg gene sequencing with primers common to all known
genotypes was used. The viral load was measured by Amplicor Monitor assay (Roche).
Results: HBV genotype A was the most prevalent (55%), while genotypes C, D and F were found
in 3%, 38% and 4% of HBV-infected patients, respectively. Among the patients infected by genotype
A, 18.3% (14/76) were African descendents and, among the patients infected by genotype D, 11.3%
(6/53) were also African descendents. In the four patients infected with genotype C, 2 were Asian
descendents and 2 were Caucasians. All (7) genotype F infected patients were Caucasians. Seventy
percent of our HBsAg-positive patients were HBeAg negative (62% genotypes A; 26.2% D; 7.1% C
and 4.7%F). The viral load of HBV-DNA was about 5 times higher in HBeAg-positive than in
HBeAg-negative patients. About 40% of these patients had alanine aminotransferase of up to 1.5
times the normal level. The mean stage of fibrosis in genotype A patients (2.8) was significantly
higher than the mean stage of fibrosis in genotype D patients (2.0) (P = 0.0179).
Conclusion: The genotypes encountered in our HBV-infected patients were apparently a
consequence of the types of immigration that occurred in our region, where European and African
descendents predominate. The HBeAg-negative status predominated, possibly due to the length of
time of infection. The viral load in HBeAg-positive patients was higher than in HBeAg-negative
individuals. The fibrosis grade in genotype A-infected patients was more advanced than genotype
D-infected patients.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in many
parts of the world. More than 2 billion people are infected
by HBV, 350 million of whom are chronic carriers of the
virus [1]. The course of disease can vary from unapparent
self limiting to chronic active hepatitis which may lead to
death after many years or, following contact with HBV,
can lead to fulminant hepatitis [2]. Chronic carrier states
occur in 5 to 10% of patients infected in adult life and 85
to 90% of those infected during infancy [3]. The outcome
of infection depends upon many factors such as host
immune status, age at infection, level of viral replication
and probably the genetic variability of virus influencing
the expression of viral antigens [4]. However, the impact
of the natural variability of the virus on the clinical course
of disease has become the focus of research only recently.
Prior to definition of genotypes, HBV strains were distinguished by serological analysis, based on the immunoreactivity of an antibody to a limited number of amino acids
in the major surface antigen, HBsAg. HBV was formally
classified into four different subtypes that were afterwards
subdivided according to the antigenic determinant of
HBsAg in adw (adw2 and adw4), ayw (ayw1, ayw2, ayw3
and ayw4), adr (adrq+, adrq-) and ayr [5]. All known subtypes contain the a-determinant [6], which is encoded
between amino acid residues 124 and 147. The difference
between the mutually exclusive subtype-specific determinants, d/y and w/r, is generated by amino acid exchanges
from K to R at residues 122 and 160, respectively [7,8]. It
has been shown that each of the known HBsAg subtypes
may belong to either one or several genotypes; although
in such cases, the genotype involved, rather than the subtype, is more likely to correlate with the geographical origin of the strain [9], which has been associated with
anthropologic history [9,10].
Genotypically, HBV genomes have been classified into
eight groups; designated A-H based on an intergroup
divergence of 8% [11] or 4%, using the gene S sequence
[12]. Genotype A is pandemic, but most prevalent in
Northern Europe, North America and Central Africa. Isolates belonging to genotypes B and C have been observed
in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Genotype D has a
worldwide distribution, and predominates in the Mediterranean region. Genotypes E and F are prevalent in West
Africa and in the Amerindian population, respectively
[13,14]. Recently, genotype G has been identified in the
USA and France [15], and genotype H has been found in
Central America [16]. The genotypes and subtypes have
been suggested to be useful clinical and epidemiological
markers [17,18], since it is well known that the genotypes
vary in geographical areas and correlate strongly with ethnicity [13,19].

Brazil is a federation of 26 states and one federal district
occupying approximately 8,500,000 km2 and divided
broadly into five geographic regions: North, Northeast,
Central-West, Southeast and South. In Brazil, wide variations in HBV infection prevalences have been reported,
depending upon the geographical region [20,21]. Brazil, a
country with a highly miscegenated population, exhibits
an HBV genotype circulation pattern that is distinct from
the distribution found in other Latin American countries,
with genotypes A, D and F being the most prevalent
among HBV carriers [22-24]. The distribution and characteristics of HBV genotypes in different regions of Brazil
have not been fully studied. This study was carried out in
Campinas, an industrialized urban area with approximately one million inhabitants, in São Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, where the estimated prevalence of HBsAg in
blood donors is around 1.5% (low rate) [25]. The aims of
this study were to identify HBV genotypes in HBV strains
obtained from HBV-infected patients and to correlate
them with clinical and histopathological features.

Methods
Patients
One hundred and thirty-nine consecutive serum samples
from HBsAg-positive patients were studied (89 males, 50
females, mean age 42 ± 14.5, range 7 to 80 years, 117 Caucasian, 20 Afro and 2 Asian descendents). All patients
were followed up by the Hepatitis Study Group of the
Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Ciências MédicasUNICAMP, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, from 2005 to
2007. Inclusion criteria were HBsAg-positive patients with
anti-HCV and anti-HIV negative markers. Serum samples
were stored at -20°C and thawed immediately before use.
Patients' records were consulted for data on gender, birth
date, probable source of infection (use of intravenous
drugs, transfusion, tattoos, healthcare professional or
unknown), serological markers for HBV (HBeAg, AntiHBeAg, Anti-HBcAg, anti-HBsAg) and liver biopsy results.
The stage of fibrosis and degree of inflammatory activity
were evaluated by the Metavir score system [26], which
classifies fibrosis into five stages: F0 - no fibrosis, F1 - portal fibrosis without septa, F2 - portal fibrosis with few
septa, F3 - portal fibrosis with numerous septa, without
cirrhosis, F4 - cirrhosis. The degree of inflammatory activity was divided into: A0 - lack of histological activity, A1 mild histological activity, A2 - moderate histological activity, A3 - severe histological activity. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved this study and informed consent
was obtained from all subjects.
HBV DNA Detection
Extraction and amplification of HBV-DNA were carried
out by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as
described by Kaneko et al (1989), somewhat modified
[27]. Selected primers corresponded to conserved regions

Page 2 of 7

BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:149

among the different genotypes and surrounding regions
that were heterogeneous among them, allowing the distinction of HBV genotypes. The selected region for amplification also covers the amino acid loop corresponding to
ad/y and w/r specificities and mutations related to HBIg,
anti-HBs monoclonal antibody and vaccine resistance.
Selected primers were as follows: HBS1F 5'-GAG TCT AGA
CTC GTG GTG GAC TTC-3' and HBS1R 5'-AAA TKG CAC
TAG TAA ACT GAG CCA-3' and inner HBS2F 5'-CGT GGT
GGA CTT CTC TCA ATT TTC-3' and HBS2R 5'-GCC ARG
AGA AAC GGR CTG AGG CCC-3'). The primer positions
in the HBV genome (strains HBV ADW; Genbank accession number V00866) were as follows: HBS1F (positions
244 to 267), HBS2F (positions 255 to 278), HBS2R (positions 648 to 671) and HBS1R (positions 668 to 691) [20].
Serum samples were subjected to two rounds of amplification with outer (HBS1F and HBS1R) and inner (HBS2F'
and HBS2R) primers, sequentially. The amplification conditions for the two rounds of PCR were as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, followed by 30 cycles;
94°C for 20 s, 56°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a
final extension step at 72°C for 1 min, in a DNA Thermal
Cycler 2400 (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Foster City, Ca, USA).
The nested PCR product was a 417 bp fragment covering
a region of S gene.
An aliquot of water was used as a negative control and
serum from an HBV-positive individual, according to EIA,
quantified by the Amplicor HBV Monitor test (Roche
Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) (1.0 × 102 copies/
mL), was used as a positive control. Serial dilutions were
made in an HBsAg low-titer performance panel (PHA 105;
Boston Biomedica, Inc., Boston, Mass), from which the
detection limit of this nested PCR was determined as
being 102 copies/mL. Carryover contamination was prevented as described by KWOK & HIGUCHI [28]. The final
amplification product was mixed with bromphenol blue,
eletrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel, visualized by UV fluorescence after staining with ethidium bromide, and photographed with Polaroid film. Samples were considered
positive if they yielded at least two positive results from
three amplifications. Samples were considered negative
when there were two negative results in two different reactions.
Analysis of HBV Sequence from Different Genotypes
The products of nested PCR were subjected to cycle
sequencing reactions, as described previously [29], by
using the second-round primers and the ABI Prism Bigdye
Terminator Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After purification, samples were denatured
and directly sequenced by automated cycle sequencing
(ABI 377, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Revision
of the nucleotide sequences was carried out using the
BioEdit program version 5.0.6 [30]. Sequences were then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/149

submitted to the Blast program in order to check their
similarity to other HBV strains deposited in GenBank. The
results of sequencing were consistent with those of HBV
isolates obtained from GenBank, corresponding to the
known HBV genotypes. The genotypes were assigned to
known groups using phylogenetics inference with known
genotypes corresponding to eight HBV genotypes identified in humans and deposited in the Genbank: Genotype
A (X75666, EF690536; subgenotype A1 = AF418672, subgenotype A2 = AB64314; subgenotype A3 (Acmr) =
AB194951), B (X75660 ayw1; D00330 adw2; AB191369):
C (D12980 adr; EU678472; AB24113.1); D (AB090270 ;
X75668 ayw3; X59795 ayw2) E (X75657; AP007262;
X75664) F (X75658; X69798 adw4; AY179735) G
(AP007264; AB191378) H (AB191383; AB298362) and
Genotype G/C recombinant (DQ078791).
HBV DNA Quantification
Of the total number of samples (139), only seventy positive samples (17 HBeAg positive and 53 HBeAg negative)
were submitted to HBV DNA quantification using the
commercial Amplicor HBV Monitor assay (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) with a threshold limit of
400 to 40,000,000 copies/ml
Statistical Analysis
The student t-test and the Mann-Whitney test were used to
analyze quantitative data. The χ2 test with either the Yates
correction or Fischer's exact test was used to analyze quantitative data and for comparing proportions. All calculated
P values were two-tailed; a P value of less 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
The patients' characteristics and the frequencies of the
viral genotypes in the 139 patients are shown in Table 1.
One hundred and seventeen (84.2%) of them were Caucasian descendents, 20 (14.4%) were African Brazilian
descendents and 2 (1.4%) were Asian descendents. In this
group, genotype A was the most prevalent (55%) followed by genotype D (38%), F (4%) and C (3%). The following subtypes were found, adw2 (48.2%), ayw
(44.6%), adw4 (4.3%) and adr (2.9%). In genotype A,
subtypes adw and ayw were detected. Genotypes C and F
presented only subtypes adr and adw4, respectively. In
genotype D, subtype ayw was the most frequent, with
three patients bearing subtype adw.
Among the 76 patients infected by genotype A, 18.4%
(14/76) of patients were African descendents, and of
those infected by genotype D, 11.3 (6/53) were African
descendents. Among the patients infected with genotype
C, two were Asian descendents and two were Caucasian.
Genotype F-infected patients were all Caucasians without
notified indigenous origin.

The data analysis regarding risk factors showed that, in 28
(20%), the parenteral route was the most common risk
factor while the sexual route was present in 15 (11%), and
probable vertical transmission occurred in 11 (8%);
although it is important to point out that in 85 (61%)
patients, identification of the risk factor was not possible.

were significantly younger than HBeAg-negative patients
(37 ± 17.2 vs. 44 ± 12.7 years), but there was no difference
in gender between the two groups (P = 0.1139). The mean
HBV DNA level was significantly higher among HBeAgpositive patients (21.152.706 copies/ml), compared to
HBeAg-negative patients (4.351.518 copies/ml) (P = <
0.0001).
Among the 65 patients who were submitted to the liver
biopsies (Table 3), a mean stage of fibrosis of 2.4 was
determined for genotype A, 1 for genotype C, 2 for genotype D and 3 for genotype F (P = 0.1148). The mean stage
of fibrosis in genotype A patients (2.8) was found to be
significantly higher than the mean stage of fibrosis in genotype D patients (2.0) (P = 0.0179). In addition, there was
no significant difference between the grade of fibrosis
when the different genotypes were compared according to
the presence or absence of HBeAg (Table 3).

Discussion
HBV genotyping has been studied extensively around the
world. We detected genotypes A, C, D and F in our group
of Brazilian patients from São Paulo state, Southeast Brazil. Genotype A was the most common and was found in
55% of the patients. Sitnik et al. [20] found genotypes A,
B, C, D, and F in various Brazilian regions, while in Rio de
Janeiro, Southeast Brazil, only the genotypes A, D, and F
were found [31]. These same genotypes have also been
encountered in populations from other Brazilian states
[32,33]. The population of Southeast Brazil contains
many European and African descendents, which would
explain the high prevalence of genotype A. We also
encountered a relatively high rate of genotype D (38%),
probably because São Paulo state received many immigrants from the Mediterranean region.

Fifty-six (40%) patients had chronic hepatitis (elevated
ALT value), and 83 (60%) were probably inactive carriers
(normal ALT value). The aminotransferase level was
measured using qALT, which represents the value
obtained by measuring samples of each patient and dividing by the normal unit limit (U/NUL). Thus, the qALT
medium in this group was 2.03. In our study, 97 (70%) of
patients were HBeAg negative and 42 (30%) HBeAg-positive (Table 2).

To our knowledge, this is the first time that genotype C
has been detected in Brazilian patients that are not of
Asian descent. Among our four genotype-C patients, two
were non-Asiatic. Several studies carried out with Oriental
Asians have shown that genotypes B and C are the most
common in that area of the world. Patients infected with
these genotypes have a poor prognosis, with more frequent progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [34]. Genotype C infections are more severe than
genotype B infections [35]. Other studies in China have
reported that the higher rate of mutants of the basal core
promoter (BCP) in patients with genotype C is associated
with a greater pathogenicity of this genotype [35,36].

We also found a lower percentage of patients with chronic
hepatitis in the HBeAg-negative group than in the HBeAgpositive group (P = 0.0077). The mean qALT was signifi-

As a group, the most important predictor of elevated ALT
and high HBV-DNA level was HBeAg status: HBeAg-positive patients were 1.5 times more likely to have elevated

ALT and high HBV-DNA, compared with HBeAg-negative
patients. The degree of observed difference in ALT and
HBV-DNA levels between HBeAg-positive and HBeAgnegative patients is related to the age of the patients and
the referral pattern.
Among our 139 patients, 56 (40%) had elevated ALT levels. Among the HBeAg positive patients, 57% showed
high ALT levels and, among the HBeAg-negative patients,
33% had high ALT levels (P = 0.007). HBeAg-positive
patients generally had higher virus levels when compared
to HBeAg-negative patients. This was also observed in our
study when we compared the viral load based on HBVDNA, which was about 4.9 times higher among HBeAg
positive patients, when compared with HBeAg negative
patients.
The high degree of replication, which probably means
more intense inflammation in the HBeAg-positive
patients, has also been observed in other studies [37-39].
The mean ALT level in HBeAg-positive patients was 2.5,

compared to 1.8 in HBeAg negative patients, which could
be due to a higher degree of inflammation.
Among HBeAg-positive patients, we found 43% of inactive carriers, compared to 57% of patients with chronic
hepatitis B (Table 2). Among 56 patients with chronic
hepatitis B (HBsAg positive, HBV-DNA positive and
increased ALT), 24 (43%) were HBeAg-positive and 32
(57%) were HBeAg-negative. This demonstrates the high
percentage of cases of HBV patients that were negative for
HBeAg in our population. In other studies, with different
populations, considerable differences were also observed
between the percentages of HBeAg-positive and HBeAgnegative patients thus the authors encountered a higher
prevalence of HBeAg-negative patients, varying from
52.5% to 63.3% [39-41]. Similar percentages were also
observed in another study in Brazil, in which 58% of the
HBV patients were HBeAg negative [42]. About 30% of
our patients were HBeAg positive and 70% were HBeAg
negative. Probably the majority of the HBV positive
patients in our region had been infected for a long time

and had developed mutations in the pre-core region
(HBeAg negative/anti-HBeAg positive).
When we examined the intensity of liver lesions, we did
not observe significant differences between the two
groups, although the HBeAg negative patients had usually
been infected for longer. The fibrosis stage was significantly greater among the HBeAg negative patients infected
by genotype A, when compared to patients infected by
genotype D. We believe that this occurred because approximately 18.3% of our genotype-A-infected patients were
African descendents

Conclusion
The genotypes encountered in our HBV-infected patients
were apparently a consequence of the types of immigration that occurred in our region, where immigrants predominate from European and African countries. In our
HBV-infected patients, HBeAg-negative was in the majority, which is associated with the time of infection and with
the presence of HBV core mutants. The viral load in
HBeAg-positive-patients was 5 times higher than HBeAgnegative individuals (higher grade of replication). The
genotype A patients showed more significant fibrosis than
the genotypes D and F in our population.
