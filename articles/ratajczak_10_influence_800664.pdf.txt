Abstract
Background: Escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium of the gastro-intestinal tract of human and vertebrate
animals, although the aquatic environment could be a secondary habitat. The aim of this study was to investigate
the effect of hydrological conditions on the structure of the E. coli population in the water of a creek on a small
rural watershed in France composed of pasture and with human occupation.
Results: It became apparent, after studying the distribution in the four main E. coli phylo-groups (A, B1, B2, D), the
presence of the hly (hemolysin) gene and the antibiotic resistance pattern, that the E. coli population structure was
modified not only by the hydrological conditions (dry versus wet periods, rainfall events), but also by how the
watershed was used (presence or absence of cattle). Isolates of the B1 phylo-group devoid of hly and sensitive to
antibiotics were particularly abundant during the dry period. During the wet period and the rainfall events,
contamination from human sources was predominantly characterized by strains of the A phylo-group, whereas
contamination by cattle mainly involved B1 phylo-group strains resistant to antibiotics and exhibiting hly. As E. coli
B1 was the main phylo-group isolated in water, the diversity of 112 E. coli B1 isolates was further investigated by
studying uidA alleles (beta-D-glucuronidase), the presence of hly, the O-type, and antibiotic resistance. Among the
forty epidemiolgical types (ETs) identified, five E. coli B1 ETs were more abundant in slightly contaminated water.
Conclusions: The structure of an E. coli population in water is not stable, but depends on the hydrological
conditions and on current use of the land on the watershed. In our study it was the ratio of A to B1 phylo-groups
that changed. However, a set of B1 phylo-group isolates seems to be persistent in water, strengthening the
hypothesis that they may correspond to specifically adapted strains.

Background
Ensuring the high microbiological quality of environmental water used as a source of recreational or drinking water is an important worldwide problem [1]. Poor
microbiological quality of water results from contamination by microorganisms of human or animal fecal origin,
and leads to the risk of gastro-enteritis in humans. Such
contamination is caused by fecal bacteria from (i) point
source pollution, e.g., treated effluents from wastewater
treatments plants (WWTPs) which primarily treat
wastewater of human origin, or (ii) nonpoint source

pollution consisting of inputs of microorganisms of
mainly animal origin, via run-off or leaching from pasture or manured soils [2-4]. The World Health Organization and, more recently, European guidelines (2006/7/
EC), use Escherichia coli as the bacterial indicator species for fecal contamination of water. Epidemiological
studies have been used to determine threshold values
for concentrations of E. coli in water above which there
is a risk of gastro-enteritis [5-7].
E. coli is a commensal bacterium of the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and vertebrate animals [8,9]. To
survive in an aqueous environment it must resist environmental stressors (oligotrophy, UV, temperature,
salinity) [10-12] and avoid predation by protozoa [13].
Some authors have suggested that some of these E. coli

strains might then persist by becoming naturalized in
fresh water and soil [14-16]. The aquatic environment
can thus be considered a secondary habitat, where some
authors have even shown the possible growth of E. coli
[17,18]. The diversity of E. coli populations in their secondary habitats has been studied by analyzing the
sequences of the gene uidA [19,20], palindromic
repetitive sequences [21,22], ribotypes [23], and profiles
of antibiotic resistance [24,25]. Using these methods,
the dynamics of E. coli populations have been investigated and, in some cases, it has been possible to discriminate between the human or animal origin of the
contamination.
The structure of an E. coli population is characterized
by four main phylo-groups (A, B1, B2, and D) [26-28].
Strains of the phylo-groups A and B1 are mainly found
as commensals in humans and vertebrate animals, with
the A phylo-group strains being predominant in humans
and the B1 strains in animals [29]. Extraintestinal infections are mainly caused by the strains of the phylogroups B2 and D [30]. Although strains of the B2 and D
phylo-groups are typically less abundant as commensals,
the distribution of the four phylo-groups can vary
according to diet or climate [9,31-33]. It also has been
suggested that some strains could be host-specific, such
as B1 strains exhibiting the hly (hemolysin) gene, found
only in animals, and B2 O81 O-type strains, found only
in humans [34,35].
The objective of this study was to investigate the
effects of various hydrological conditions on the structure of the E. coli population collected from stream
water in a small rural watershed in northern France
(Figure 1). Land use in the watershed is almost entirely
agricultural with a low population density. Results show
that an increase of fecal contamination was accompanied by a change in the distribution of phylo-groups in
the E. coli population, represented by a change in the
ratio of A to B1 phylo-groups. E. coli B1 isolates were
the dominant phylo-group isolated in the water. Among
E. coli B1 isolates, some epidemiological types (ETs)
seem to be specific to water that is only slightly
contaminated.

Results and discussion
E. coli population structure in creek water in relation to
hydrological conditions and watershed land use

E. coli were enumerated and the population structure
analyzed by phylo-grouping in three sets of samples collected under different hydrological and agricultural
land-use conditions (Table 1). In this study, the E. coli
population structure in creek water is analyzed from a
single sample integrating all the daily samples. The origin (animal or human) of specific strains was investigated, in addition to the phylo-grouping, by hly gene

detection in the E. coli B1 isolates and O81 typing of
E. coli B2 isolates, as well as by studying the antibiotic
resistance pattern. Statistical analyses (Chi2 test) were
performed in order to compare hydrological conditions
(dry versus wet periods, rainfall events).
During the dry period (May 2007), when cattle were
being grazed, but when there was no runoff or leaching,
the water was slightly contaminated by E. coli (6.2 102
CFU/100 ml) (Table 1). The structure of the E. coli
population was significantly different from the structures
analyzed from the other sample collection periods (c2
test P < 0.001), with a majority of E. coli B1 isolates
(87%) (Table 2). This structure argues for contamination
by E. coli B1 isolates that are better adapted to the
aquatic environment [15], rather than for residual
bovine fecal contamination, as the isolates were devoid
of the hly gene and sensitive to all antibiotics [35,36].
It was during the wet period (February 2007), when
there was no grazing, but when there was a malfunctioning septic system (4 equivalent inhabitants), that the
lowest value of E. coli (1.0 102 CFU/100 ml) was measured in the water. The E. coli population was characterized by a high proportion of phylo-group A isolates
(47%) (c2 test P < 0.001), followed by E. coli B1 isolates
without the hly gene (Table 2). None of the E. coli was
resistant to the seven antibiotics tested (Table 2). This
E. coli population is probably due to an input of solely
human origin, as the structure corresponds to that
already described for human commensal E. coli in
France [31,32].
The rainfall event that occurred during the dry period
(July 2007) resulted in runoff from the pastures and
leaching of soils. The density of the E. coli in the stream
water (4.0 104 CFU/100 ml) was two orders of magnitude higher than that measured for the two other periods (Table 1). During this rain event, an input of E. coli
from cattle contamination (172 head of cattle) was
added to that from human contamination (147 eq. inhabitants, 49 septic tanks, and the malfunctioning septic
tank). The structure of the E. coli population was characterized by two main phylo-groups, B1 (44%) and A
(32%). Some E. coli B1 isolates with the hly gene, presumably of animal origin were detected (2/15) [35].
More than 60% of these isolates were resistant to at
least one of the three antibiotics used in veterinary medicine (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin)
[37] (Table 2), suggesting an animal origin.
Thus, it appears that both hydrological conditions and
current land use in the watershed might affect the structure of the E. coli A and B1 populations in the stream. In
contrast, the hydrological and land-use conditions did not
exert a significant influence on the phylo-groups B2 and
D, which were the least abundant phylo-groups recovered
from the water (between 0 and 23%). No human-specific

three out of the twenty-four hourly samples. Our selection represented three key moments (5 hours before,
6 hours after, and 19 hours after the rain event) showing
how the turbidity and E. coli density evolved. It would
not have been possible to observe this evolution using
just a sample that integrated all the daily samples. The
rain event consisted of 14 mm of rain that fell during a
wet period, during which there were 42 cattle being

conditions, which is consistent with the low frequency of
these strains in the E. coli population [34].

suggesting fecal contamination of human origin resulting from leaching of soils and from surface runoff
(Table 3). This structure was significantly different
from that observed in the less contaminated water analyzed 19 hours after the rainfall event (c 2 test P <
0.001). At that time the E. coli density had decreased
to 2.8 102 CFU/100 ml (Figure 2), and E. coli B1 isolates (74%) were the predominant E. coli phylo-group.
These isolates are mainly hly positive (72%) with 31%
resistant to at least one antibiotic (amoxicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol), suggesting that there had
been an input on the soils of E. coli of bovine origin
that was then introduced into the water through runoff and/or leaching.

grazed in the watershed (March 2008) (Figure 2). Five
hours before rainfall began, the level of E. coli contamination was low (7.6 10 1 CFU/100 ml), and the small
number of isolates did not permit analysis of the structure of the E. coli population (Table 3). During the
rain event, the turbidity increased, as did the number
of E. coli, consistent with previous work demonstrating
a correlation between bacteria and particles [38]. Six
hours after the rainfall event the E. coli density
reached a value of 7.2 102 CFU/100 ml, at which point
the structure of the E. coli population was characterized by a majority of E. coli phylo-group A (56%), with
63% being resistant to at least one antibiotic (amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin),

We cannot exclude an input from wild animals
(mainly birds and rabbits), although wild E. coli strains
are usually not resistant to antibiotics [39]. These results
indicate that during the rain event, an increase in microbial contamination was accompanied by a modification
of the structure of the E. coli population, resulting in a
high ratio of phylo-groups A/B1. In contrast, in the
water collected 19 h after the rain event, and only
slightly contaminated by E. coli, the majority of E. coli
isolates belonged to the B1 phylo-group.
Diversity of E. coli B1 strains isolated from the creek
water

As E. coli B1 was the dominant phylo-group isolated in
water from the Bébec, accounting for between 15% to 87%
of the E. coli population (Tables 2 and 3), we investigated
further the diversity of E. coli B1 isolates by (i) sequencing
the uidA gene (beta-D-glucuronidase, 600 pb) and comparing the sequences obtained with those in the MLST
Pasteur database in order to find the uidA allele, (ii)
detecting the presence of hly and determining molecularly
the O-type, (iii) studying the antibiotic resistance profile.
A total of 40 epidemiological types (ETs) were identified among the 112 E. coli B1 isolated from the water
(Table 4) and the proportion of each ETs differed for
each sampling event (Figure 3A and 3B).

In the most contaminated water (4.0 ± 0.7 104 CFU/
100 ml), the diversity of E. coli B1 strains (i.e., number
of ETs/total number of B1 isolates for the sampling
campaign) was higher (12/15) than in less contaminated
water (9/17 in water containing 1.0 ± 0.1 102 CFU/100
ml; 12/39 in water containing 6.2 ± 0.6 102 CFU/100
ml) (Figure 3A). At the peak of the turbidity, E. coli
density reached a value of 7.2 10 2 CFU/100 ml, the
diversity of E. coli B1 strains was higher (6/6) than the
diversity observed when turbidity and E. coli density
decreased (10/29) (Figure 3B).
Among the 40 ETs, strains of the group ET1.1 were
present in all samples, regardless of the hydrological
condition or the current land use in the watershed.
However, they made up a greater proportion of the
strains under non-storm conditions: during the dry period (no contribution of fecal bacteria from the
watershed), 13 ET1.1/39 E. coli B1 were present, and
during the wet period (a low contribution of humanderived fecal material, but none from livestock) 6 ET1.1/
17 E. coli B1 were present (Figure 3A). In contrast,
other ETs were present only under certain hydrological
conditions and/or land-use conditions. ET1.7 and
ET14.1 were present only during the dry period. ET3.4
was present after the rain event only when the turbidity
decreased after the peak had been reached (Figure 3B).

more abundant in water that is only slightly contaminated, suggesting better survival of these ETs. These
results strengthen the hypothesis of Walk et al., [15],
that some strains of E. coli B1 phylo-group are persistent in water and might correspond to strains with an

adaptive advantage in water. However, it must be
pointed out that in this work, the E. coli A0 isolates (50/
213), without any amplification of the genes chuA, yjaA
and the fragment TSPE4.C2, could correspond to the
new clades of Escherichia recently described which
appear to be environmentally adapted [40].

Figure 3 Distribution of E. coli B1 epidemiological types in relation to hydrological conditions (A) and before and after a rain event
during a wet period (B).

Conclusions
In environmental water, the occurrence of E. coli, a bacterial indicator of fecal contamination, is related to both
the use of the watershed by livestock and humans combined and the hydrological conditions [2,3,41]. In this
study, focused on a small rural watershed composed of

pasture and human occupation, we showed that both
the number and the structure of the population of
E. coli were modified by hydrological conditions and use
of the watershed. In this watershed, following rainfall,
an increase of fecal contamination was accompanied by
a modification of the distribution of phylo-groups in the

Ratajczak et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/222

E. coli population, represented by change in the ratio of
A to B1 phylo-groups. E. coli B1 strains were the dominant phylo-group isolated in the water. Among E. coli
B1 isolates, some ETs seem to be specific to water that
is only slightly contaminated, suggesting different survival abilities among E. coli B1 strains.
The results from this study do not question the choice
of E. coli as a bacterial indicator of microbial quality of
water DCE 2006/7/CE (Excellent quality CFU/100 ml
≤500). They rather indicate that the structure of an
E. coli population in water is not stable, but depends on
the hydrological conditions, on current use of the
watershed land, and on both the origin and intensity of
the contamination by fecal bacteria.

Methods
Study site

The study was carried out in the experimental
watershed “Le Bébec” (Haute Normandie, France) (Figure 1). The Bébec stream drains a small watershed of
about 10 km2, of which 95% is classified as agricultural
land. The elevation of the plateau on which Le Bébec is
located averages about 100 m. The soils on the plateau
consist of silts approximately 10 m thick, and are highly
susceptible to crusting, compaction, and erosion, particularly during the autumn and winter. This watershed is
located in a temperate zone with an oceanic climate.
Annual precipitation during the period of the study was
1012 mm, and the daily average temperature was 10.9°
C. Flow in the Bébec varied from 3 l.s-1 in summer dry
periods to 15 l.s-1 in winter, and reached up to 500 l.s-1
in response to major winter storms. Water from the
creek recharges the underlying chalk aquifer through a
swallow hole. The karstified chalk aquifer has been
widely studied [38]. When the flow rate in the stream
exceeds the infiltration capacity of the swallow hole, the
creek water overflows its banks and floods the valley.
Land use in the area consists of approximately 55%
cropland, 30% pasture (42 beef cattle, 130 dairy cattle),
and 10% forest, with the remaining 5% divided among
several other uses. The 213 households in the watershed
(639 equivalent inhabitants) rely on on-site septic systems. Among them, 49 septic tanks (147 equivalent
inhabitants) were located on a 500 to 600 m stretch of
the stream. Untreated sewage of human origin (4
equivalent inhabitants) resulting from a dysfunctional
septic system was located 400 m from the sampling
location corresponding to a input of E. coli which varies
from 6.5 101 CFUs per 100 ml-1 in a wet period to 3.6
104 CFUs per 100 ml-1 after a rainfall event. The landuse data were provided by the “Groupement d’Intéret
Public Seine Aval”, and data on beef and dairy cattle
were provided by the “Direction Départementale de
l’Agriculture et de la Forêt (DDAF)”.

Materials and sampling method

Samples were collected with autosamplers (ISCO 6700 s,
Roucaire, Courtaboeuf, France) from the stream, near
the swallow hole, during a wet period in February 2007
(high flow) and during a dry period in May 2007 (low
flow), after a storm during a dry period in July 2007
(Table 1), and after a storm during a wet period in
March 2008, with samples taken 5 h before the storm, 6
h after the storm, and 19 h after the storm (Figure 2).
The site was equipped with dataprobes (YSI 6820) to
measure turbidity. Suspended sediment concentration
was measured by filtration through pre-weighed Millipore filters (0.45 μm). Water (1 L) was collected by
autosamplers every hour for 24 h, 250 ml of each flask
were mixed until subsequent microbial analysis, except
for the sampling campaign in March 2008. All samples
were kept at 4°C until the microbiological analyses were
carried out, which occurred within 8 h.
Enumeration of culturable E. coli

E. coli were enumerated using membrane filtration
methods (0.45 μm HA047 Millipore, Bedford, MA,
USA). E. coli were isolated from the water samples with
a selective chromogenic media specific for E. coli, with
the addition of a selective supplement for water samples
(RAPID’E.coli 2 Medium and Supplement; Biorad, USA),
and incubated for 24 h at 44°C. The threshold value
for the enumeration of E. coli in water was 5 CFUs per
100 ml-1.
E. coli isolates

Two hundred and thirteen isolates of E. coli were isolated from the creek water. The isolates were taken
from the membrane of RAPID’E.coli 2 medium and isolated on RAPID’E.coli 2 medium for 24 h at 37°C. Each
clone of E. coli was stored on a cryo-bead system (AES
laboratory, France) at -80°C. Four sets of isolates were
obtained from the stream under different hydrological
conditions: 44 isolates during dry season conditions
(February 2007); 45 isolates during wet season conditions (May 2007); 34 isolates after a storm during the
dry period (July 2007); and 90 isolates from the storm
during the wet period (March 2008).
Determination of the E. coli phylo-groups, O type, and
presence of the hly gene

The phylogenetic group to which the E. coli isolates
belonged was determined by the PCR-based method, as
described previously by Clermont et al. [42]. A total of
112 isolates of E. coli B1 were tested for the virulence
factor hly by the PCR amplification method as described
by Escobar-Páramo et al. [34] (hly.1: 5′-AGG-TTCTTG-GGC-ATG-TAT-CCT-3′; hly.2: 5′-TTG-CTTTGC-AGA-CTG-CAG-GTG-T-3′). All E. coli B2 were

Ratajczak et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/222

tested for the O81 type [10], and all E. coli B1 strains
were tested for O7, O8, O15, O26, O40, O45b, O78,
O81, O88, O103, O104, O111, O128 and O150 types by
using the PCR-based method described by Clermont
et al. [43] with the primers shown in [Additional file 1].
These O types have been previously shown to be
present in B1 group strains (Clermont and Denamur,
personal data).

Antibiotic resistance testing

Antibiotic resistance was determined by the agar diffusion method using seven antibiotic disks (BioMérieux,
France): amoxicillin (AMX), ticarcillin (TIC), chloramphenicol (CHL), tetracycline (TET), trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (SXT), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and
streptomycin (STR). Among them CHL, TET, STR are
used in veterinary medicine. After 24 h of incubation at
37°C, the bacteria were classified as sensitive, intermediate, or resistant according to French national guidelines
[44]. The E. coli CIP 7624 (ATCC 25922) was taken as
the quality control strain. The data were regrouped as
resistant or non-resistant, the latter corresponding to
sensitive and intermediate phenotypes.

Allele number attribution of uidA gene of E. coli B1

Partial uidA sequences (600 pb) of 112 E. coli B1 isolates from the stream (17, dry season; 39, wet season;
15, storm during dry period; 41, storm during wet period [6, 6, and 19 5 h before the storm, 6 h after the
storm, and 19 h after the storm, respectively]) were
sequenced after PCR amplification (uidAR: 5′-CCATCA-GCA-CGT-TAT-CGA-ATC-CTT-3′; uidAF:5′
CAT-TAC-GGC-AAA-GTG-TGG-GTC-AAT-3′).
Thirty-five μl of PCR product, containing an estimated
100 ng/μl of DNA, were sequenced in both forward and
reverse directions at Cogenics (Meylan, France). A consensus sequence was determined by aligning the forward
sequence with the reverse complement of the reverse
sequence. Alleles of uidA were determined by comparison of the uidA sequences found in the MLST database
Pasteur http://www.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/genopole/PF8/
mlstdbnet.pl?file=Eco_profiles.xml.
Statistical analyses

The frequencies of various phylo-groups in the water
samples were compared using the chi-square test. Tests
were carried out using the XLSTATS version 6.0
(Addinsoft).
