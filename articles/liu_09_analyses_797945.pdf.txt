Abstract
Background: Understanding the constituent domains of oncogenes, their origins and their fusions
may shed new light about the initiation and the development of cancers.
Results: We have developed a computational pipeline for identification of functional domains of
human genes, prediction of the origins of these domains and their major fusion events during
evolution through integration of existing and new tools of our own. An application of the pipeline
to 124 well-characterized human oncogenes has led to the identification of a collection of domains
and domain pairs that occur substantially more frequently in oncogenes than in human genes on
average. Most of these enriched domains and domain pairs are related to tyrosine kinase activities.
In addition, our analyses indicate that a substantial portion of the domain-fusion events of
oncogenes took place in metazoans during evolution.
Conclusion: We expect that the computational pipeline for domain identification, domain origin
and domain fusion prediction will prove to be useful for studying other groups of genes.

Background
An oncogene is a modified gene that promotes unregulated
proliferation of cells, increasing the chance that a normal
cell develops into a tumor cell, possibly resulting in cancer
[1]. The normal copy of such a gene is called a proto-oncogene. The first oncogene, SRC, was discovered in a chicken
retrovirus in 1970 [2]. Since then, numerous oncogenes
have been identified and classified into different groups
based on their cellular functions. As of now, oncogenes
have been identified at all levels of signal transduction
cascades that control cell growth, proliferation and differentiation [1-3].

Protein domains are compact and semi-independent
units of a protein, each of which may consist of one or
more contiguous segments of a peptide chain and have its
own biological function [3]. They are generally viewed as
the basic unit of protein function and evolution. Various
sequence- and structure-based methods have been developed for the identification of protein domains [4-6], and
several domain databases, such as DALI [7], PFAM [8],
SMART [9] and Prodom [10], have been established.
Recent studies on oncogenes and cancer pathology have
pointed to the importance of individual domains and

domain fusions in oncogenesis. It has been reported that
genes containing domains from specific domain families
may have particular relevance to human cancer [11-13].
For example, the tyrosine kinase domain is known to play
significant roles in the development of numerous diseases
such as cancer [11]. Another example is the ATM-related
domain that is required for histone acetyltransferase
recruitment and Myc-dependent oncogenesis [12]. Additionally, CML, a form of leukaemia, is associated with the
fusion of Bcr and Abl genes or their constituent domains
[13]. Therefore, understanding the constituent domains
of oncogenes as well as their origins may shed new light
about the initiation and development of cancers.
In this study, we have developed an integrated computational pipeline for studying the domain composition,
domain fusion and domain origin. Specifically, our computational pipeline includes the following key components: (1) identification of the origin of each component
domain of known oncogenes and the relevant fusion
events; (2) co-occurrence analysis of oncogene domains;
(3) identification of the domains and domain pairs that
appear more frequently in oncogenes than in the background, namely the collection of all human genes; and (4)
functional analyses of the identified frequent domains
and domain pairs. We then applied this pipeline to all
well characterized human oncogenes, and had a number
of new and interesting observations. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis specifically addressing the domain composition, origin and
fusion of oncogenes.

gene domains have their origins in the early stages of
organismal evolution prior to the emergence of the metazoans, and no domains are found to arise from mammals.
It should be noted that these results have been further
refined by our literature survey from the original subtractive searching results (see Material and Methods), to take
potential HGT into consideration. Based on the literature
search, we found that domain SWIB and non-enzymatic
domains ig and SAM are likely to have arisen in eukaryote.
Their homologs are identified in prokaryotes, likely
resulted from HGTs from eukaryotes [14]. Also the origin
of tyrosine kinases (Pkinase_Tyr) is probably in eukaryote
and their presence in bacteria may also be explained most
parsimoniously by HGT events [14].
In order to further analyze the statistical difference
between the domain origin distribution of oncogenes versus that of the other genes, we have compared our results
with Lipika et al. [15], which presented an analysis on the
origins of the conserved domains in the whole human
proteome. Table 1 presents a thorough calculation of the
enrichment ratios of oncogene domains that originated
from 8 categories (i.e., Bacteria_only, Archaea_only,
Bacteria_archaea, low level Eukaryotes, Metazoan, Chordate, Mammalian, Homo sapiens) compared with the
whole domain dataset in the human genes and their p-values. Our results indicate that the origin distribution of
oncogene domains is largely consistent with that reported
by Lipika et al. [15] for the whole human proteome,
EXCEPT FOR those of bacterial or metozoan origins.

Using the computational procedures outlined in Material
and Methods, we have carried out a detailed analysis of
oncogene domains and co-occurring domains for their
origins and functional analysis.

Domain functions
We divided the oncogene domains into groups based on
their GO annotation (Table 2). These oncogene domains
show diverse functions, including regulation of transcription and apoptosis, protein kinase activity and DNA/
RNA/protein binding activity.

A. Origin of oncogene domains
Origin of distinct domains in cellular organisms
103 distinct domains [see Additional file 1] have been
identified from 124 oncogenes, based on Pfam domain
assignments. We have considered the subtype scenarios
for specific domains, i.e., the different alignments for a
specific domain in one clan and using one domain ID to
denote the corresponding subtypes. In our dataset, there
exist two alignments SH3_2 and SH3_1 for the SH3
domain. The same holds for the SAM domain, where
SAM_PNT is the entry for the SAM domain and two different alignments, SAM_1 and SAM_2, exist for this entry,
respectively. Although they have different accession numbers in Pfam, we just use SH3 and SAM_PNT to denote
these two types of domains, respectively. The distribution
of these domains' origins across different cellular organisms is given in Figure 1. About 50% (55/103) of onco-

Further analyses suggest that domains with different functions might have come from different origins (Figure 1;
Table 2). For example, domains related to immunoglobulin and tyrosine kinase (e.g., SH2, SH3, I-sev, and V-set)
are found in archaea, bacteria or in both. These domains
are known to be closely related to oncogenesis [16] (Note
that another two important oncogenesis-related domains:
Pkinase_Tyr and ig, originated in eukaryotes, but were
horizontally transferred to prokaryotes [14]). Other
domains such as rhodopsin domains (7tm_1, 7tm_3),
cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) domains (Cyclin_N,
Cyclin_C) and the intracellular signalling domains (PH,
CH) seem to have originated in eukaryotes. Several
domains related to the development of the nervous system such as wnt, ephrin_lbd and Sema seem to have originated in metazoans. In addition, function domains
required by vertebrates such as hormones involved in

for the first time, considered as the origin of the oncogene
[see Additional file 3].

Domains originated from viruses
Among the 103 identified oncogene domains, 38 are
found to be present in viruses (Table 3). The three most
frequently occurring domains in virus proteins are
Helicase_C, Ank and DEAD. Ank has been reported in
diverse groups of proteins such as enzymes, toxins and
transcription factors. The existence of Ank in both
prokaryotes and viruses may have resulted from horizontal gene transfers [17]. The Helicase domain family
(including Helicase_C and DEAD) is reportedly related to
hepatitis virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and
involved in cell growth control [18]. In addition, some
other families such as Zinc finger domains (zf-C3HC4, zfC2H2, zf-C4), Immunoglobulin-related domains (ig, Vset, I-set) and protein-tyrosine kinase related domains
(Pkinase_Tyr, SH2, SH3) also have remote homologs in
viruses and all these three domain families are closely
related to oncogenesis. Overall, 20 of the 38 virus-originated domains are known to be related to oncogenesis.

Among the 24 oncogenes whose initial domain fusions
occurred in prokaryotes, 20 have the same domain
fusions in viruses (Table 4). It seems that domains with
prokaryotic origins tend to present in viruses.

B. Oncogene domain fusion
Domain fusion in cellular organisms
We have identified 50 whole domain fusion events in the
124 oncogenes. Among them, 21 contain two distinct
domains (domain pairs) and the others contain at least
three different domains. Their initial appearance in cellular organisms and their presence/absence in viruses are
given [see Additional file 2].
Fused domains in viruses
Among the 50 fused domains, 7 events have been identified in viruses. These 7 fused domains can be divided into
4 categories according to their functions: pkinase-related
domain fusion ({SH2, SH3, Pkinase_Tyr}, {SH2, FCH,
Pkinase_Tyr}); platelet-derived growth factor domain
fusion ({PDGF, PDGF_N}); helicases-related domain
fusion ({DEAD, Helicase_C}) and DNA/ligand-binding
domain fusion ({Hormone_recep, zf-C4}; {HLH,
Myc_N, Myc-LZ}; {HLH, Myc_N}). Interestingly, ~90%
of the virus proteins harbouring these fused domains
come from the Potyviridae family and the remaining
almost all come from the Orthoretrovirinae family. Potyviridae is one of the largest and most important families
of plant viruses. Although the relationship between retroviruses and cancer has been widely established [19-21],
the possible link between Potyviridae and oncogenesis is
unknown.
C. Proteome-wide patterns of origins of oncogenes
We have also examined the origins of all the oncogenes as
a whole. Our goal is to find out at what stage in evolution
all component domains of an oncogene are fused together

We have divided the oncogenes into six categories according to their functions: signal transducers, no-receptor
kinases, growth factors, growth factor receptors, transcription factors and others. Based on our examination of the
oncogene origins, we have observed some general relationships between the origins and the functional categories of the oncogenes (Table 5).
Signal transducers
In our dataset, most of the oncogenes acting as signal
transducers originated from prokaryotes. We have
observed that a large number of such genes contain the
Ras and Pkinase domains, and are involved in signal
transduction, protein binding and kinase activities. It is
believed that most ras proteins exist in an inactive state in
the resting cell where they bind GDP [22], and their oncogenesis is closely related to their interactions with other
receptors.
No-receptor kinases
Non-receptor kinases oncogenes are mostly tyrosine
kinases discovered through retroviral transduction and/or
through DNA transfection that do not have a receptor-like
transmembrane domain. These proteins are partly associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and
more related to cell differentiation than to proliferation.
Another group of serine/threonine kinases such as RAF1
also belongs to this category. Our analysis shows that all
the oncogenes of this group originated from metazoans.
Growth factors
Only one oncogene PDGFB (sis) is known to be a growth
factor. This gene encodes one of the two polypeptide
chains that together constitute PDGF, a platelet-derived
growth factor domain. Our analysis shows that the PDGF
domain generally originated in metazoans or chordates,
and the corresponding oncogene first came into being in
chordates.
Growth factor receptors
The ERBB oncogene family was originally isolated from
chicken erthroleukemia, encoding an epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor [1]. Several other oncogenes also
encode proteins with a receptor-like domain, including
KIT and ROS [1]. These oncogenes consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain
and an intracellular domain. Our analysis results show

that these genes generally originated in metazoans or
chordates, representing important regulatory proteins
involved in phosphorylation [23].
Transcription factors
Transcription factors are nuclear proteins that regulate the
expression of their target genes. They typically belong to
multi-gene families that share common DNA-binding
domains such as zinc fingers. Our data shows that oncogenes acting as transcription factors mostly originated in
chordates, and a few of them (25%) came from metazoans. It has been speculated that the pathologically activated form of these transcription factors no longer fulfils
their physiological regulating functions but acts as a carcinogen [1,24].

Many oncogenes of this category have been identified in
our dataset. One representative is JUN, which can bind
tightly to other nuclear onco-proteins. In addition, a substantial portion of oncogenes in this category belongs to
the myc gene family that is related to nuclear transcription
and myeloblastosis. It has been reported that the Myc
genes have been found in a wide variety of vertebrates,
including mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish [25,26].
The myeloblastosis function in these oncogenes may have
evolved in response to some specific needs by chordates.
Programmed cell death regulators
The first oncogene shown to regulate programmed cell
death is BCL2 [27]. Several other oncogenes related to
apoptosis have also been identified in our dataset. We
found that these oncogenes often originated in metazoans. The mechanisms of apoptosis have not been fully elucidated, but previous studies indicate that the process of
apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of cell signals
which may originate either extracellularly (extrinsic
inducers) or intracellularly (intrinsic inducers) [1,27].
This type of complex cell signal network may be more
active and required by metazoans.

D. Frequent domains and domain pairs in oncogenes
Oncogene domain co-occurrence graph
We have constructed a domain co-occurrence graph for
124 oncogenes, which consists of 105 domains (nodes)
and 141 co-occurring domain pairs (edges), as shown in
Figure 2. The graph has 8 connected components, each
containing at least 3 nodes, with the largest component
having 37 nodes and 82 edges. The graph has a sparse but
highly clustered structure. The few highly connected
nodes representing domains like Pkinase_Tyr, SH2, SH3
form hubs of the (co-occurrence) network.

A large-scale analysis of co-occurrence networks of the
protein domains collected from the ProDom, Pfam and
Prosite domain databases was previously performed by S.
Wuchty [28], which found that these networks exhibited
small-world and scale-free properties. In our study, the
same properties were observed for oncogene domain network (Figure 3). We conclude that the oncogene domain
network has a sparse but highly clustered structure. Highly
connected nodes emerge in the network which predominantly shapes the topology of the underlying network and
a few domains are connected to many different domains
forming a few hubs.
Frequent domains and domain pairs
We have identified a number of domains and domain
pairs that are highly frequent in oncogenes, compared
with those in the background human genome. We consider such domains as significant if they show high occurring frequencies and high numbers of co-occurring
domains in the oncogenes but not in the background set.
These domains are Pkinase_Tyr, SH2, SH3, RhoGEF and
fn3, with functions related to signal transduction, enzymatic activity, and cell surface binding. Moreover,
pkinase_Tyr has protein-tyrosine kinase activities, and
SH2 and SH3 mediate protein interactions. They are
known to play a key role in diverse biological processes
such as growth, differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis in response to external and internal stimuli.

Oncogene domain co-occurrence graph consisting of 105 domains
Oncogene domain co-occurrence graph consisting of 105 domains. Each node is labelled with a domain name. The
weight of each edge represents the co-occurrence frequency across all the 124 oncogenes.
To find out which domain pairs occur more frequently in
oncogenes than in the background genome, we have carried out enrichment analyses of the domain pairs. Table 6
gives the domain pairs with p-values more significant than
10-6. It should be noted that 10-6 is a rather significant cutoff based on our experience in identifying frequent
domain pairs from the background.

We expect that domain fusions might have brought new
functions to their host proteins. This type of functional
transformation has been reported previously [25,29-31].
For instance, the SH3 and SH2 domains frequently appear
together in various signalling proteins involved in recognition of phosphorylated tyrosine [30], where SH2 localizes tyrosine-phosphorylated sites and SH3 binds to target
proteins [31]. Another example is that the bHLH motif
and the "Myc boxes" co-exist in the Myc gene family.

Frequency distribution of node degrees in oncogene domain network
Frequency distribution of node degrees in oncogene domain network. The distribution follows a generalized power
law:. Parameter values of the fit (solid curve) are a = 1.125; b = -0.887, and r = 0.101.

bHLH uses a common mechanism for DNA binding and
dimerization while the Myc boxes, on the another hand,
appear to be unique to the Myc family and are involved in
transcription activation and neoplastic transformation
[25]. While the individual functions of these two domains
are generally understood, their synergistic effects in their
bounded protein complex are not known [25].
Two significant triad domain fusions, {SH2, SH3,
Pkinase_Tyr}
and
{Furin-like,
Recep_L_domain,
Pkinase_Tyr}, are found (Figure 2) and they form six
fused domain pairs (shown in Table 6). Pkinase_Tyr are
known to be related to protein tyrosine kinase activities
and amino acid phosphorylation. The other two domains,
Furin-like and Recep_L_domain, are involved in signal
transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases [32]. It is also
noteworthy that domains corresponding to the tyrosine

kinase family are among the most frequent families in
oncogenes. These domains may carry essential functions
as standalone domains and may also extend their functionality to accomplish complex tasks in combination
with other domains.
E. Phylogenetic profiling diversities of frequent domains and domain
pairs
Diverse origins of frequent domains and domain pairs are
found in cellular organisms through our phylogenetic
profile analyses, which provide complementary information to our earlier analysis of domains and domain pairs.
Phylogenetic profiling is a computational technique for
functional analyses of domains and their fusions [33]. We
have calculated the phylogenetic profiles of all oncogene
domains and domain pairs to find their taxonomic distribution across 495 cellular genomes, grouped into 7 taxa:

origins, most frequent domain pairs first came together in
higher organisms. Although multi-domain proteins are
more common in higher organisms, it is not clear if this
observation about frequent oncogene domain pairs is
generally true for any domain pairs from any groups of
genes, which will be left for future study.

Our data show that nearly all frequent individual
domains originated in prokaryotes, and have a wide distribution across many genomes, while the frequent
domain pairs almost all first emerged in metazoans (Table

Conclusion
We have analyzed the origins of component domains and
domain fusions of oncogenes, and studied the unique
characteristics of the oncogene domain pairs in comparison with those in the background human genome. Most
of these domains and domain pairs are functionally
related to protein tyrosine kinase activities, which are
closely related to cancer pathophysiology. Our phylogenetic profile analysis provides additional evidence to support our observation that frequent domain pairs in
oncogenes tend to originate in higher organisms. The
knowledge gained from this computational study may
provide useful insights about the complex processes of
oncongenesis.

Methods
A. Data sources
124 proto-oncogenes of Homo sapiens were collected from
CNIO
OncoChip
project
website
http://nci
array.nci.nih.gov/gi_acc_ug_title.shtml and the Cancer
Genome
Anatomy
Project
database
http://
cgap.nci.nih.gov/Info/CGAPDownload [see Additional
file 4], and their protein sequences were obtained from
the Uniprot database [34] (only the primary protein form
was used). The pre-calculated domain structures of these
proteins were retrieved from the Pfam-A database (version
21.0) [8], using HMMER [8] and RPS-BLAST [8] (E-value
cutoff 0.001; sequences were masked for coiled-coils and
low complexity regions). Our list includes all the important proto-oncogenes previously reported in the literature
[2,35-37]. All these proto-oncogenes were manually
curated based on the published literature.

A proto-oncogene only becomes an oncogene when
mutations or over-expressions take place [37]. Note that
"oncogenes" are different from "cancer genes". Commonly we consider oncogenes as those involved in uncontrollable cell growth while cancer genes are generally
referred to genes that are identified with somatic or germline mutations in cancer tissues. Futreal et al. recently conducted a census of human cancer genes on the basis of
genetic evidence [16], whose cancer-gene list partly overlaps our oncogene list. Throughout the rest of the paper,
we use oncogenes to refer proto-oncogenes for the terminology simplicity.
Two sets of genomes and their encoded proteins were
used in our study, one including the whole set of proteins
encoded in 495 sequenced genomes (with 34 archaea,
422 bacteria and 39 eukaryotes) from the Integr8 database
(release 58) [38] and the other including 367,752 protein
sequences with Pfam annotations from 6,774 sequenced
virus genomes. The second data set was downloaded from
the Uniprot database at the FTP site [39].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/88

The complete set of proteins of Homo sapiens with Pfam
domain annotation was downloaded from the Integr8
database, which contains 25,025 protein sequences without splicing isoforms. This dataset set served as the background for our statistical analyses.
It should be noted that currently there is no well-accepted
benchmark dataset for oncogenes. Since our data were
mainly selected from CNIO OncoChip project and Cancer
Genome Anatomy Project database, a likely bias may exist
when compared with other datasets. One future plan of
our work is to investigate several other cancer gene datasets, including those identified by exon sequencing studies such as TCGA [40] dataset from the group at John
Hopkins [41] and the cancer gene lists compiled by Futreal et al.[16], to derive a more comparative dataset of
oncogenes.
B. A computational pipeline for domain analyses of
oncogenes
Our computational pipeline for identification of the origins of oncogene domains and domain fusion events consists of three main steps (Figure 4). The first step is to
predict the origins of domains and domain fusion events
in oncogenes, which is done through application of a subtractive search procedure [15], in conjunction with identification and analyses of horizontal gene transfers to avoid
pitfalls, which could potentially lead to misclassification
of domain origins in prokaryotes. The second step is to
perform comparative analyses on domains between oncogenes and the background, namely the whole collection
of human proteins. Domains and domain pairs with
higher occurrence frequencies in oncogenes than in the
background are identified, through an analysis of a
domain co-occurrence graph. Detailed analyses on these
domains and domain pairs are carried out in the third step
of the pipeline, through a combination of a domain/
domain pair enrichment analysis and a phylogenetic profile analysis (see following sections for details).
Subtractive search
First we generate the domain list of all the 124 oncogenes,
and search them against all the sequenced genomes,
which are organized into a simplified taxonomy tree,
including viruses, archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, plus a few
increasingly finer subclasses of eukaryotes leading to
Homo sapiens, namely metazoans, chordates and mammalian (Figure 5). The questions we ask here are (a) for each
domain, where did it occur for the first time going from a
simplest class of organisms to the most complex one? (b)
for each pair of co-occurring domains, where did the cooccurrence take place for the first time in the aforementioned taxonomy?

Figure 4
A computational pipeline for prediction of origins of oncogene domains
A computational pipeline for prediction of origins of oncogene domains. Different components of the pipeline are
colour-coded with yellow for prediction of domain origins, blue for analysis of oncogene domain co-occurrence and red for
analysis of evolutionary characteristics of frequent domains and domain pairs.

In Figure 5, the term other_node is used to denote the
group of organisms excluding the next higher node in the
taxonomy. For example, if node B is next to node A in the
taxonomy, 'other_nodeA' refers to all species from 'nodeA
minus nodeB'. Thus, for node eukaryote, 'other_eukaryota'
refers to all species from eukaryotes minus metazoans.
Briefly, the tracing procedure starts from the organisms in
a bottom-level group, and goes up the taxonomy tree to
higher organisms in each of the groups. It should be noted
that when a remote homolog of a domain is found at one
other_node, its node of origin will be its immediate lower
major node. Then the hit domains will be subtracted from
the set and the others will be searched against the higher
level other_node until all other_nodes are searched along the
whole taxonomy. For example, if a domain is found at the
other_chordata node, then its node of origin will be the
chordata node. When a domain does not have a hit when
searched against all the other_node genomes, then its node
of origin will be considered as Homo sapiens [15].
We have used three types of nodes of origin for bacteria
and archaea depending on the presence of remote

homologs, i.e. archaea_only (first hit only in archaea, but
not in bacteria), bacteria_only (first hit only in bacteria but
not in archaea) and archaea_bacteria (first hit in both
archaea and bacteria).
A tool package TaxDom is developed to execute the procedure outlined above and to facilitate visualization of the
search results. The program is written in Perl and Java.
Refinement of subtractive search results
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a substantial
role in organismal and genome evolutions [42]. Gene
transfer from prokaryote to eukaryotes, particularly in the
context of organellar endosymbiosis, is a major evolutionary phenomenon [43]. However, horizontal transfer in
the opposite direction, i.e., from eukaryotes to bacteria or
archaea, has been reported only anecdotally [14].
Although this type of transfer may occur only rarely, we
have performed manual curation on the tracing results
generated by the subtractive searching procedure, to fix any
false origination classification for proteins that have been
reported in literature to have emerged in eukaryotes first

and then were transferred to prokaryotes. We have corrected such false origination predictions by our above procedure, based on our extensive literature search results.
Domain co-occurrence graph and enrichment analysis
We define a domain co-occurrence graph [44] as follows.
Each node represents a distinct domain in the oncogenes,
and two nodes are linked by an edge if they co-occur in
some proteins in one of the reference genomes. Each edge
has a weight defined as the number of co-occurrences of
the corresponding domains in the same protein. Note that
this graph is not necessarily a connected graph.

The following defines the enrichment ratio [45] of
domains between oncogenes and the background human
genome, for identification of domain pairs with higher
co-occurrence frequencies in oncogenes compared to the
whole human genome. Let
N = the number of proteins in the background set,
ns = the number of proteins in the background that contain domain pair s,
M = the number of proteins in the oncogene set, and
ms = the number of oncogene proteins that contain
domain pair s.

We use the following formula to calculate the enrichment
ratio of proteins that contain a specific domain pair in
oncogenes and its p-value, knowing that it follows a
hypergeometric distribution [45]:

Enrichment _ ratio =

ms / M
ns / N
