Abstract
Background: This study reports the first collection of validated microRNA genes in the sea squirt,
Ciona intestinalis. MicroRNAs are processed from hairpin precursors to ~22 nucleotide RNAs that
base pair to target mRNAs and inhibit expression. As a member of the subphylum Urochordata
(Tunicata) whose larval form has a notochord, the sea squirt is situated at the emergence of
vertebrates, and therefore may provide information about the evolution of molecular regulators of
early development.
Results: In this study, computational methods were used to predict 14 microRNA gene families in
Ciona intestinalis. The microRNA prediction algorithm utilizes configurable microRNA sequence
conservation and stem-loop specificity parameters, grouping by miRNA family, and phylogenetic
conservation to the related species, Ciona savignyi. The expression for 8, out of 9 attempted, of the
putative microRNAs in the adult tissue of Ciona intestinalis was validated by Northern blot analyses.
Additionally, a target prediction algorithm was implemented, which identified a high confidence list
of 240 potential target genes. Over half of the predicted targets can be grouped into the gene
ontology categories of metabolism, transport, regulation of transcription, and cell signaling.
Conclusion: The computational techniques implemented in this study can be applied to other
organisms and serve to increase the understanding of the origins of non-coding RNAs,
embryological and cellular developmental pathways, and the mechanisms for microRNA-controlled
gene regulatory networks.

Background
Small non-coding RNA genes have emerged in recent
years as regulators of transcription and translation in a
time and cell-state dependent manner. In particular,
mature microRNA (miRNA) molecules of approximately
22 nucleotides in length have been shown to inhibit gene

expression by base pairing to target mRNA. MicroRNAs
have been implicated in gene regulation during embryological development, disease, and cell differentiation [1].
Specifically, recent studies have linked miRNA to many
diverse biological processes such as clearing of maternal
mRNA during zebrafish embryogenesis [2], regulation of

the life span in Caenorhabditis elegans [3], and involvement in tumorigenesis in human cancer [4].
Although miRNAs were first discovered in the early
1990's, it has only been in the past five years that there has
been an explosion in the literature on their formation and
gene regulatory mechanisms, and on their abundance in
the genomes of different organisms. MicroRNAs are now
projected to occur at a frequency of approximately
0.5–1.5% of the total genes in the genome [5]. For the
human genome, which contains approximately 30,000
protein coding and large non-coding RNA genes, there are
currently 470 miRNAs reported in the miRNA database
[6]. It is estimated that possibly 20 to 30% of human
genes are targets of miRNA [7]. Since many miRNAs are
evolutionarily conserved [8], discoveries in model organisms may contribute to understanding the role of specific
miRNAs in gene regulatory networks for other organisms.
Recent studies have revealed many of the biological characteristics of miRNA formation and mechanism, which
can be used for computational prediction of new miRNAs
and their targets [9]. The microRNA primary transcripts
(pri-miRNAs) contain one or multiple hairpin secondary
structures. The ribonuclease Drosha complexes with a
double-stranded RNA binding protein DGCR8, to process
the pri-miRNA into a 70–100 nucleotide precursor
miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA is exported from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm via an Exportin-5 transport
mechanism. Once in the cytoplasm, the RNase III enzyme
Dicer cleaves the loop of the hairpin. The strands are separated, allowing the single-stranded mature microRNA
whose 5'end has lower stability base pairings, to associate
with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), while
the other strand is degraded. In RISC, the miRNA acts as a
guide to recognize mRNA targets via base pairing. The
mechanism of regulation is not entirely known, but the
current model suggests that if the base pairing of the
mature miRNA in the RISC complex shows sufficient
complementarity to the mRNA target, then there will be
cleavage and degradation of the mRNA target. With less
complementarity, the miRNA/RISC represses translation
of the mRNA target [10].
For animal miRNAs that partially base pair to target
sequences, several general characteristics further constrain
miRNA target prediction [10]. First, the miRNA binds to
the 3' untranslated region (UTR) in most of the established mRNA targets in metazoans. Second, the strongest
base-pairing between the miRNA and mRNA seems to
occur at the 5' end of the miRNA, especially in the first 8
or 9 nucleotides. Third, sequence conservation in the
UTRs of orthologous genes is a strong indicator of functional binding sites, and reduces false positive targets.
Fourth, miRNA target regulation has been shown to occur

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/445

when the same miRNA can recognize multiple sites in the
3'UTR of an mRNA target. Recently, multiple miRNAs in
the same family, i.e., mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241 in C.elegans, were found to act in concert to control developmental genes [11]. Accurate target prediction must consider all
of these properties of miRNA. Target prediction is difficult
because of the very short length of the mature miRNA and
the imperfect binding to the target. A variety of methods
have been reported in the literature for the computational
prediction of microRNA sequences and their targets [12].
This study involves the combination of computational
and biological techniques to identify and validate microRNAs in the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis. We performed
these analyses in C. intestinalis for several reasons. First, as
a member of the subphylum Urochordata (also known as
Tunicata) whose larval form has a notochord, the sea
squirt is situated phylogenetically at the emergence of the
vertebrates [13], and therefore can provide information
about the evolution of molecular regulators of early development. Second, the C. intestinalis genome has been completely sequenced [14], and another related urochordate
genome, Ciona savignyi, has also been sequenced. Third, it
has a compact genome of approximately 160 megabases
(Mb), containing few repeated sequences. This small size
and the consequent optimization of intergenic regions
makes the genome tractable to study computationally.
Fourth, Ciona is relatively easy to obtain and culture, and
embryos can be manipulated experimentally with genetic
techniques [15-17].
While another group has computationally predicted
microRNAs for Ciona intestinalis [18], there are currently
no experimentally validated microRNAs for Ciona intestinalis in the Sanger microRNA database, miRBase [6] (formerly known as "The microRNA Registry" [19]). To
qualify for inclusion into the miRBase database, the
expression of the microRNA must be detected using either
the Northern blotting method, or from a library of cDNA
made from size-fractionated RNA [20].
In the present study, we implemented microRNA gene
and target prediction techniques to examine the genomes
of the marine organisms Ciona intestinalis and Ciona
savignyi. In our parameterized approach, we capitalized on
the phylogenetic conservation of known miRNA gene
families to screen quickly the genome of an organism for
the possible presence of homologous miRNA genes. This
technique greatly reduces the number of putative miRNAs
that must be validated experimentally. Using the current
approach, we predicted 14 miRNA sequences for Ciona
intestinalis. We validated 8, out of 9 attempted, of the predicted miRNA sequences by Northern blot experiments.
Following the prediction of the miRNA sequences, we
computationally predicted and tabulated the most proba-

ble mRNA targets for these miRNAs. A subset of these targets exhibit conservation across phylogeny [21], and
therefore may point to microRNA-controlled regulatory
functions across evolutionary pathways.

Results and Discussion
Collection of known miRNA statistics
To tune the miRNA prediction algorithm parameters,
miRNA and precursor sequences were analyzed to determine physical and sequence conservation characteristics,
using the following three pairs of organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans vs. Caenorhabditis briggsae, Drosophila melanogaster vs. Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Homo sapiens vs.
Pan troglodytes. Additional File 1 summarizes the statistics
gathered for these three pairs of closely related organisms.
For each species examined, the average percent identity of
the two hairpin stem sequences was 78% or better, with a
minimum of 65% identity. The average percent identity of
the mature miRNA sequence between closely related species was 98%. The average hairpin loop length was 20
nucleotides, and ranged from 7 to 58 nucleotides. The
percent GC content in the mature and precursor
sequences was approximately 45%. These characteristics
directed our microRNA prediction algorithm.
Computational prediction of the Ciona intestinalis
microRNAs
Using the parameters from the statistical analysis (Figure
1), we predicted 14 miRNAs for Ciona intestinalis. Mapping the locations of these putative Ciona miRNAs to the
Ciona genome yielded additional information for comparison to the available known miRNAs. Additional File 2
lists the putative C. intestinalis miRNAs, their mature
miRNA sequence, oligonucleotide probe sequence, scaffold number, coordinates, strand, position, and nearest

neighboring gene. Figures 2 and 3 show the mfold program's text and graphical output for the putative miR-72
and let-7 for Ciona and C. elegans. The mfold output demonstrates the conservation of the precursor hairpin structure with the related species, Ciona savignyi. Using the
ClustalX program, the predicted mature miRNA
sequences for C. intestinalis and C. savignyi were aligned
with known mature miRNA sequences from other organisms. Figure 4 shows the mature miRNA multiple
sequence alignments which in turn demonstrate the
membership of the predicted Ciona miRNAs in existing
miRNA gene families.
The number of miRNAs from this computational prediction is likely to be lower than the actual number of
miRNA genes in C. intestinalis. Since miRNAs are believed
to occur at a frequency of approximately 0.5–1.5% of the
total genes in the genome [5], Ciona's 15,000 genes
should have generated between 75 – 225 miRNAs. Of the
19 miRNA families that appear in both C. elegans and H.
sapiens [22], our algorithm only predicted 5 of these families in C. intestinalis (Figure 5). We expected to find all of
the miRNA families that were present in both C. elegans
and H. sapiens. Therefore, this may be an indication that
our algorithm is underpredicting the miRNAs. The parameters of our prediction algorithm could be relaxed in
future studies, in order to produce additional miRNA
sequence candidates.
Experimental validation of predicted miRNA sequences

blot analysis (Figure 6). To validate the strand polarity of
the predicted mature miRNAs, we performed the Northern blot analysis with sense and anti-sense probes for the
top and bottom strands of the let-7 and miR-72 C. intestinalis homolog predictions. In both the let-7 and miR-72
homologs, no hybridization to the anti-sense strand
occurred. Therefore, the strand polarity of these two predicted miRNA sequences was confirmed.
As a control, equal quantities of total RNA from C. elegans
and C. intestinalis were run on the same Northern blot
[results not shown]. When hybridizing against the probes
for the miR-72 and let-7 Ciona homologs, the C. intestinalis lanes showed strong positive signals. The C. elegans
lanes showed a weak response to the Ciona miR-72
homolog probe, and no response to the Ciona let-7
homolog probe. These results were as expected, since
Northerns are extremely sensitive to the probe sequence.
Since there were known mismatches to the probe at the
ends of the C. elegans sequence, it did not hybridize as
well to the miR-72 probe as C. intestinalis. Similarly, since
the Ciona let-7 sequence contained 2 alignment gaps in
the middle section the C. elegans sequence, we did not
expect to see hybridization.
Hybridizations with 7 of the remaining predicted C. intestinalis miRNAs were attempted, yielding 6 additional positive Northern blot results. For these putative miRNA
sequences, probes were made against the predicted
mature miRNA sequences only, not against the bottom
sequences of the hairpin structure.

MicroRNA expression data from other organisms confirmed the results that we obtained in the Northern analyses of our predicted C. intestinalis miRNA sequences [2226]. For example, let-7 is highly expressed in adult tissue
of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and vertebrates [23]. Therefore, we were not surprised to find the let-7 homolog
expressed in the adult tissue of C. intestinalis. Conversely,
miR-47 has been experimentally validated in C. elegans,
but has not yet been predicted or validated in vertebrates
[22]. Although computationally there appears to be a
miR-47 homolog in C. intestinalis, we were not able to
detect its expression by Northern analysis. Since C. intestinalis is phylogenetically located at the emergence of vertebrates, the expression of miR-47 in C. intestinalis may be
more like vertebrates in this case.
We chose not to validate our predictions of miR-302a,
miR-33, miR-452*, miR-520d, and miR-7, based upon
reports of the expression of these homologs in the literature. The miR-302a sequence was validated by others in
mouse and human by cloning from embryonic stem cells.
Likewise, the miR-7 sequence was found in early embryonic development of the Drosophila (embryo to 6 hours)
[23]. Our validation was done with adult tissue. The miR452* and miR-520d sequences were detected by the arraycloning technique [27]. The miR-33 sequence failed to
validate by Northern in any of the tissues tested in a previous study, which included HeLa cells, mouse kidney,
adult fish, frog ovary, and S2 cells [23]. Therefore, since it
was unlikely to detect these homologs with Northern
analyses in adult tissue, we have not attempted to validate
them at this time.
Computational prediction of the Ciona intestinalis mRNA
targets
Application of the target prediction algorithm allowed
stepwise refinement of the 14,866 potential mRNA targets
to a high confidence list for validation. The algorithm for
mRNA target prediction was based upon the observed biological mechanism of miRNA in the regulation of gene
expression. That is, the target prediction algorithm
addresses the following miRNA properties: reverse complementary partial binding of the miRNA to the target; the
most critical binding at the 5' end of the miRNA strand;
and the binding to the 3'UTR of the target. Figure 7 contains a summary of the results of the computational target
prediction. The 14,866 mRNA sequences were input to
the prediction pipeline as potential targets for the Ciona
miRNA. The Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm,
highly sensitive to small sequences, reduced the number
of potential targets to 572 unique mRNAs. These
sequences were filtered to retain only reverse complementary matches in which the miRNA 5'end had the strongest
affinity for the target.

If 20 to 30% of the genes for an organism are regulated by
miRNA, then Ciona intestinalis should have approximately
3000 to 4500 mRNA targets based upon its 15,000 gene
size. However, since our algorithm underpredicted the
number of Ciona miRNAs by approximately a factor of 10,
this would explain a corresponding reduction of predicted
targets. Therefore, 240 targets for 14 gene families is a reasonable number of possible targets. Preliminary experimentation with the program parameters demonstrated
that varying the seed alignment lengths and sequence
identity percentages reflected a direct correlation to the
number of predicted targets. Configuring these parame-

ters may then be used to adjust the system to produce
more or less targets. Through computational analysis, we
assigned functional descriptions to the target genes which
had miRNA matches to the 3'UTR of the mRNAs. The target genes were also grouped according to their Gene
Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 8). The majority of target
gene functions are involved in metabolism, membrane
transport, and cell signaling.
To enforce the relationship between the miRNA binding
location and its potential to elicit a regulatory effect in the
target gene, we computationally calculated and assigned

5' untranslated region (5'UTR), and protein coding section (CDS). This procedure divided the 572 target
matches of the Ciona mRNA sequences into the following

5'UTR, and 70 matches to the CDS. As most established
miRNA targets exhibit binding in the 3'UTR [28], this
region was examined more closely. Further manual curation yielded three instances of multiple hits to the 3'UTR
of the same target by different miRNAs. Additional File 3
contains a list of the predicted targets with single and multiple hits to the 3'UTR region. The predicted targets which
contained multiple hits would be interesting to validate
because there is evidence in other organisms that multiple
miRNA binding sites in the 3'UTR contribute to more
potent regulation [11,29].
Finally, we attempted to use phylogenetic homology with
the C. savignyi genome to further prune the list of targets.
There are no functional gene descriptions available for C.
savignyi, and surprisingly, the C. intestinalis and C. savignyi
genomes are more divergent than we had expected. Therefore, this step removed virtually all of the potential targets,
and had to be abandoned from our algorithm. Other studies have also found that approximately 50% of the targets
would have been missed if conservation had been used
[2].

Because we could not use phylogenetic conservation with
C. savignyi for the final step, we assessed whether other
features supported the strength of the microRNA to
mRNA target pairings. That is, we evaluated seed region
match quality; we excluded G:U wobble pairs; and we
examined whether some amount of compensatory binding at the 3' end of the miRNA was present. Figure 9 shows
a sampling of the predicted mRNA targets. The RNAhybrid program [30] was applied to these miRNA:mRNA
sequence pairs, to calculate the minimal free energy of the
hybridization. The values obtained from RNAhybrid were
consistent with energetically favorable hybridizations.

Conclusion
In this study, we used computational methods to predict
14 miRNA sequences in the Ciona intestinalis genome. Of
the 9 miRNA sequences tested experimentally using
Northern blot analyses, we successfully validated the presence of 8 of our predicted Ciona miRNA homologs in the
RNA of the adult tissue of Ciona intestinalis. Currently, no
experimentally validated miRNAs are reported in the
Sanger miRBase for Ciona intestinalis. The addition of our
eight validated sequences to the database strengthens the
evidence of phylogenetic miRNA sequence conservation.
Additionally, a computational algorithm for mRNA target
prediction was developed in this study, which takes
advantage of the known biological properties of miRNA
function and their target binding behavior.

ism under study could be examined for known miRNAs
from a member of the same Class or Order [31-33]. Second, in the initial step of our algorithm, the strongest constraint for alignment was placed upon the first 10
nucleotides, which includes the seed region of the
miRNA. This differs from other methods that searched
along the entire mature miRNA for perfect or near-perfect

Although previous studies have used phylogenetic homology for the prediction of miRNAs, our algorithm involved
several novel concepts. First, since Ciona is located in an
area of the phylogenetic tree for which miRNAs have not
yet been validated, we chose to search for potential
miRNA sequences across widely divergent phyla and subphyla. In other homology-driven approaches, the organ-

matches [12,34-36]. This constraint was chosen because
the seed region is important in target binding [7], and has
been used in other studies as the basis for determining
miRNA family membership [22]. Third, our algorithm
used a second homology filter to compare the miRNA
candidates between two species for which miRNAs have
not yet been validated. Because the two genomes of Ciona
are so divergent, these conserved ~22 nucleotide
sequences are even more compelling as potentially valid
miRNA genes.
In the course of this study, another laboratory published
an initial computational prediction of miRNAs for Ciona
intestinalis [18], based upon homology between predicted
precursor hairpin structures in Ciona intestinalis, Ciona
savignyi, and Oikopleura dioica. Their published prediction
of 41 miRNA precursor sequences overlapped with ours
by just one microRNA, let-7. In a subsequent study [37], a
clustering approach was used with the Ciona non-coding
RNA candidate sequences. By this method, the authors
predicted 58 miRNAs, of which only let-7, miR-7, miR124, and miR-126 coincided with known miRNAs. Our
method predicted let-7, miR-7, and miR-126, as well as 11
other conserved miRNA families. While their approach
exhibits great potential for predicting conserved and novel
miRNA candidates, they report no experimental validation in either study, so we cannot evaluate the accuracy of
their prediction method's results.
Our miRNA prediction code was written to be highly configurable, allowing for different binding strengths, as well
as step-wise refinement to prune the candidates by phylogenetic conservation with homologous miRNA gene families. The entire prediction pipeline was designed so that
intermediate results could be extracted at each step and
examined for interesting patterns. As more characteristics
of miRNA are discovered, code modules can be added and
removed to reflect the changing paradigm. Establishing
statistics for the characteristics of known miRNA genes in
other organisms enabled the creation of a parameterized
prediction approach with a high success rate. Genomic
sequence analysis for conserved miRNA genes, coupled
with secondary structure folding, is not necessarily sufficient to find miRNA genes in an organism unless parameters are applied to aid in the selection process. In a recent
study involving the prediction of porcine miRNA genes
through homology, only 7 out of 20 attempted predictions were validated by Northern blot [31]. The details of
the prediction algorithm in this study were not shown, so
it is not clear if parameterization was applied during the
process. Our code was also designed so that parameters
could be configured to tighten or relax the constraints on
the matches. The current parameters may be too restrictive, if the percentages reported in the literature [5] are
extendable from human miRNAs to Ciona miRNAs. That

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/445

is, we should have obtained approximately 75 to 225
miRNAs based upon the 15,000 gene size of the Ciona
intestinalis genome. In future studies, several constraints
could be relaxed in order to potentially predict additional
miRNAs in Ciona intestinalis. In particular, the length of
alignment and percent identity between the C. intestinalis
and C. savignyi mature miRNA candidates could be
reduced. Further, the requirement of structural similarity,
involving a reasonable conservation of bulge size and
location in the hairpin stem region of the predicted
miRNA precursors, could be decreased between these two
species of Ciona.
Additionally, some miRNA genes and their targets may
have been missed by the phylogenetic conservation constraint to the C. savignyi genome. Our inability to find
orthologous targets across C. intestinalis and C. savignyi
may be due to several factors. First, the C. savignyi genome
has ambiguous and incomplete regions, which prevented
sufficient alignment with the C. intestinalis genome. Second, the two species of Ciona have recently been found to
be far more divergent than expected for such morphologically similar species. Using an analysis of 18S rRNA
sequences, it has been estimated that "the divergence
between the two species of Ciona is slightly greater than
that between human and chick [38]." Additionally, the
Ciona species exhibit an extremely high allelic polymorphism. The allelic polymorphism for C. intestinalis has
been estimated to be an average of 1.2% [13]. Sequencing
of two haplotypes of C. savignyi had an extremely high
heterozygosity rate of approximately 4.6% [39]. Because
of the high polymorphic rate, the C. savignyi genome
could not be assembled using the classical whole-genome
assembly method. Instead, two haplotypes were
sequenced separately, and then merged to produce the reference sequence. To confirm our predictions in C. savignyi,
it would be necessary to examine the pre-assembled alleles for the sequence. Therefore, it was necessary to reevaluate our target prediction algorithm and remove the
constraint of phylogenetic conservation with C. savignyi,
in order to produce a larger sample set for validation.
Despite these bioinformatic challenges, our miRNA prediction success rate demonstrates that this algorithm may
be used for other organisms, including those with poorly
or unannotated genomes. Further, our study highlights
the benefit of the selection of C. intestinalis as a model
organism for miRNA experimentation. In particular, since
miRNA expression appears to be tissue-specific, many
miRNAs of higher vertebrates might not be detected due
to the specific tissue or organ that is sampled. In Ciona, the
entire adult organism, including all organs, can be
homogenized and prepared for RNA extraction. Therefore, all tissue types of Ciona are represented in the

Page 8 of 13

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:445

homogenate that is used for miRNA detection, thereby
increasing the probability of successful validation.
A disadvantage to our miRNA prediction method is that it
will not find novel miRNAs in a genome. However, the
information of the existence of known ones in different
species may be used to refine the method of finding novel
ones. In the genome of an organism, one can find many
hairpin loops, and short conserved sequences as potential
miRNA candidates. However, not all of these candidates
will produce a mature miRNA. Therefore, as more miRNAs are experimentally confirmed, refinements can be
applied to the prediction algorithms.
Our computational predictions could also be used to construct a gene regulatory network model, using hierarchical
clustering of the miRNA and mRNA target binding
strengths. Initial experimental gene regulatory networks
are being constructed at several laboratories for Ciona
intestinalis [40,41]. However, there are currently no published miRNA-based regulatory networks for Ciona intestinalis. The development of a computational gene
regulatory network model of miRNA to target mRNA
mappings for Ciona would facilitate the process of experimental validation and gene regulatory mechanism discovery.
The outcome of this study involves the implementation of
computational techniques which can be applied to the
study of other organisms. In particular, the technique can
be used to quickly screen the genome of any organism for
the presence of existing miRNA homologs. The prediction
and validation of these factors may increase the understanding of evolution of microRNA-controlled regulatory
relationships and give insight into the origins of microRNA networks in diverse animal species.

Methods
Collection of known miRNA statistics
The analysis of characteristics of known miRNAs for several species yielded parameters used to predict miRNAs
and their mRNA targets in the two Ciona genomes. Mature
miRNA and precursor sequences were obtained from the
Sanger Institute's miRBase database ([6], July 2006). The
statistics collected for these known miRNA molecules
included loop length, percent identity in the stem region
of the hairpin structure of each miRNA, percent identity of
the mature miRNA sequences between the two closely
related species, and percent GC content of the sequences.
Computational prediction of the Ciona intestinalis
microRNAs
Computational prediction of Ciona intestinalis and Ciona
savignyi microRNAs was performed with genome data
available from the Department of Energy Joint Genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/445

Institute (JGI) and the Broad Institute. The Ciona intestinalis genome, Assembly v1.0 (April 2002) and Annotation
(V1.0), were obtained from the JGI website [14]. The
Ciona savignyi genome, Assembly v1.0 (April 2003), was
obtained from the Broad Institute website [42]. Using statistics for characteristics of known microRNAs gathered in
the first phase of this study, a miRNA prediction algorithm was implemented to search the Ciona intestinalis
genome for conserved mature microRNA genes (Figure 1).
The entire C. intestinalis and C. savignyi genomes were
searched for conservation with the seed region of the
known mature miRNA sequences from the Sanger miRBase. Although it has been estimated that 60% of miRNA
primary transcripts are found in the intergenic regions
[43], we chose to search the entire genome to avoid the
omission of any miRNA genes that might occur in introns
or coding regions. The list of mature miRNA sequences for
all organisms was obtained and used as query sequences.
Queries were aligned locally with the target genomes
using the FASTA/ssearch34 program [44]. Software was
written to examine the results and extract matches of high
similarity. Matches of 90% identity or better to the first 10
nucleotides of the known miRNAs were retained for further processing. Conservation of 90% identity or better in
this seed region, between C. intestinalis and C. savignyi,
was enforced. To remove repeated matches to miRNA
gene family members, only the matches to C. elegans and/
or H. sapiens were retained. The rationale for this choice
was the following: if the sequences existed in C.elegans
and/or H.sapiens, they were likely to exist in Ciona as well.
To prune the number of potential hairpin structures, the
list of seed matches between C. intestinalis and C. savignyi
were extended by 10 nucleotides downstream from the
match. These 20-mers were searched for 90% identity
between the two species. For all such conserved matches,
100 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the
match boundaries were extracted from the genomes and
examined for a hairpin structure.
The RNA folding software mfold [45] was used to confirm
the hairpin structure as the lowest energy folding form.
The low energy state is indicative of the secondary structure that the RNA sequence is most likely to adopt. The
structures were manually curated for the presence of hairpins with the mature miRNA sequence in the stem region,
loop lengths between 10 and 50 nucleotides, and reasonable conservation of bulge size and location in the hairpin
stem region between the two species. The procedure
resulted in the prediction of 18 miRNA molecules that
appear in both C. intestinalis and C. savignyi.
The ClustalX version 1.83 program [46] was used to confirm the miRNA gene family membership, and to verify

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:445

homology to C. elegans and/or H. sapiens. ClustalX analysis yielded 14 miRNA gene families for Ciona intestinalis.
The genome browsing capability of the Satoh laboratory
web site was utilized to examine the JGI Gene V1 and the
Kyoto Grailexp Gene 2005 tracks of the Ciona intestinalis
genome [42]. The coordinates for the putative Ciona miRNAs were mapped to the gene locations to determine the
position and nearest neighboring genes.
Experimental validation of predicted miRNA sequences
We chose nine sequences from our list of 14 predicted
miRNAs for experimental validation. The validation process involved the collection, culturing, dissection, and RNA
extraction from adult Ciona intestinalis. The total RNA was
analyzed via the Northern blot protocol with end-labeled
DNA oligonucleotide probes, specific to our predicted
miRNA sequences.

Adult Ciona intestinalis were collected in Mission Bay, San
Diego, CA. The adults were cultured at Scripps Institute of
Oceanography in an aquarium of constantly flowing filtered seawater, which was pumped from approximately
1000 feet offshore. The C. intestinalis were kept under constant light conditions to suppress the release of gametes.
Prior to RNA extraction, the tunic of the C. intestinalis was
removed to avoid the inclusion of contaminating organisms and material that may be growing on the surface. The
fresh tissue of the entire organism, without the tunic, was
immediately homogenized in the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and a total RNA extraction protocol was performed.
We used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
Northern blot methods to detect the presence of miRNA
in the RNA samples [8,47]. For a positive control on some
of the Northern blots, an equal amount of total RNA from
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was loaded in adjacent lanes to the C. intestinalis RNA. The C. elegans RNA
was extracted from wild-type N2 grown at 20C, and collected at 53 hours in young adult stage. This stage of C.elegans may contain some fertilized oocytes.
DNA oligonucleotides (Allele Biotechnology, Inc. and
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) were designed with
reverse complementary sequence to the putative mature
miRNA sequences. For the predicted let-7 and miR-72
Ciona miRNA homologs, oligonucleotides were designed
as probes for both the top and bottom strands of the hairpin structure. For all predicted miRNAs, the probe was
designed by extending the mature miRNA sequence by 3
nucleotides on each end. Additional File 2 lists mature
predicted miRNA sequences and their corresponding
probes.

Computational prediction of the Ciona intestinalis mRNA
targets
Following the prediction of the miRNA sequences, we
computationally predicted and tabulated the most probable mRNA targets for these miRNAs. Figure 7 contains a
flow diagram for the mRNA target prediction algorithm.
The process aligns miRNA sequences against potential target sequences, filters the output data according to
observed miRNA target binding characteristics, assigns
gene functional descriptions, determines the binding
locations, and prunes by phylogenetic homology with C.
savignyi. Each individual step will be discussed in more
detail in subsequent sections.

The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs a local alignment, as opposed to a global alignment. Although, it is
more time-consuming, local alignment is more sensitive
to finding smaller query sequences in the target
sequences. A series of filtering and ranking algorithms
were implemented in the Perl programming language.
The procedure was written such that parameters could easily be modified and was based upon slight variations in a
previously reported target prediction procedure [7] which
capitalizes on the seed region binding tendencies. In particular, the output matches from the Smith-Waterman
alignment were passed through a filter to confirm that the
miRNA exhibited reverse complementary binding to the
target. The matches were then classified according to the
length of their seed binding as follows: 6-mer matches
with perfect complementary for nucleotides 2 – 7 of the 5'
end of the miRNA; 7-mer matches at nucleotides 2 – 8; 7mer matches at nucleotides 1 – 7; 8-mer matches at nucleotides 2 – 9; and 8-mer matches located at nucleotides 1 –
8. Our algorithm did not enforce the presence of an adenosine (A) on either side of the 6-mer seed match.
The filtered matches were then ranked in two ways: by
number of matches of miRNA for each mRNA, and by
number of matches of mRNA per miRNA. The locations
on the mRNA target were retained for processing of the
relative hit location and for conservation with C. savignyi.
These steps are will be elaborated in the next four paragraphs.
The potential target gene data set used for the target prediction was constructed as follows. Predicted gene transcripts for Ciona intestinalis (Annotation, V1.0) were
obtained from the Satoh laboratory web site [48]. These
predicted mRNA sequences did not necessarily contain
the 5'UTR and 3'UTR regions of the mRNA. Thus, 1500
nucleotides upstream and downstream from the transcript boundaries were extracted from the C. intestinalis
genome. We focused on matches to the 3'UTR of the target
genes as the most likely genes regulated by miRNA.

Because the Ciona intestinalis genome is incompletely
annotated, we computationally assigned functional
descriptions to the sequences. The functional descriptions
for most transcription factor genes and some signaling
molecules, based on cDNA libraries and in situ hybridization studies, are available from the Ciona intestinalis
online database [49]. However, many of the predicted
transcripts across the genome were not functionally annotated. Therefore, the available data files were augmented
with functional descriptions to the mRNAs based on blast
alignments to proteins from the non-redundant database,
"nr" [50], using the MESH component of MAGPIE [51].
The top match for each mRNA target was chosen as a surrogate functional description. The mRNA functional
description list generated by MESH was joined to the
InterPro (IPR) functional descriptions from the Ciona
intestinalis online database, to produce a list of mRNA
identifiers and their functional descriptions.

sified as an orthologous C. savignyi mRNA. The target prediction code was applied to the C. savignyi subsequences,
to check that miRNAs matched the 3'UTR of orthologous
genes to C. intestinalis, according to the seed match criteria
described earlier.

The Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the mRNA targets
were assigned via custom software following alignment of
the mRNA sequences with the GO database. The GO identifiers were then input into the Gene Ontology (GO)
Terms Classification Counter [52], using the EGAD2GO
classification filter for higher level grouping.
To further restrict the number of potential targets, the
location of each binding site of a miRNA to a target gene
was classified by location: 5'UTR, CDS, or 3'UTR. Matches
to the 3'UTR of the mRNA were retained as the most probable targets of miRNA regulation. The EMBOSS transeq
program [53] was used to translate the C. intestinalis
mRNAs into 6 possible reading frames. A Perl script was
implemented to select the longest open reading frame
(ORF) and tabulate its coordinates in the mRNA
sequence. The region of the sequence upstream of the ORF
was assumed to be the 5'UTR, and the region downstream
of the stop codon of the ORF was assumed to be the
3'UTR. The ORF itself was classified as the coding
sequence (CDS). Next, another Perl script was written to
compare the location of the miRNA match in the mRNA
sequence, to the locations of the 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR.
Each miRNA match was classified as a 5'UTR, CDS, or
3'UTR match. This information was applied to the list of
potential targets, which could then be sorted and ranked
by the hit location.
The final step in the mRNA target prediction process
examined the mRNA targets for conservation in C.
savignyi. Currently, predicted transcripts of C. savignyi do
not exist. C.savignyi "pseudo" mRNAs were generated as
follows. The tera-tblastn program on the TimeLogic board
aligned the C.intestinalis mRNA gene sequences against
the entire C. savignyi genome. The top match of the C.
savignyi genome to each of the mRNA sequences was clas-
