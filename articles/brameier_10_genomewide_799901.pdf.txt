Genome-wide comparative analysis of microRNAs
in three non-human primates
Markus Brameier

Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. With the
recently completed sequencing of three primate genomes, the study of miRNA evolution within the primate
lineage has only begun and may be expected to provide the genetic and molecular explanations for many
phenotypic differences between human and non-human primates.
Findings: We scanned all three genomes of non-human primates, including chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), for homologs of human miRNA genes. Besides
sequence homology analysis, our comparative method relies on various postprocessing filters to verify other
features of miRNAs, including, in particular, their precursor structure or their occurrence (prediction) in other
primate genomes. Our study allows direct comparisons between the different species in terms of their miRNA
repertoire, their evolutionary distance to human, the effects of filters, as well as the identification of common and
species-specific miRNAs in the primate lineage. More than 500 novel putative miRNA genes have been discovered
in orangutan that show at least 85 percent identity in precursor sequence. Only about 40 percent are found to be
100 percent identical with their human ortholog.
Conclusion: Homologs of human precursor miRNAs with perfect or near-perfect sequence identity may be
considered to be likely functional in other primates. The computational identification of homologs with less similar
sequence, instead, requires further evidence to be provided.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of short endogenous non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences which
directly function as negative regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in multicellular
eukaryotes (see e.g. [1-3] for reviews). The ~70 nt long
precursor of animal miRNAs (pre-miRNA) forms a typical hairpin-like stem-loop structure. The contained
mature miRNA is only ~22 nt long and binds to complementary target sites in the untranslated region (UTR)
of messenger RNA. Perfect base-pairing is found only
for a 6-8 nt long seed region located at the 5’ end of the
miRNA. As a result, one miRNA may at least theoretically target hundreds of genes.
Comparative approaches to discover miRNA genes
[4,5] rely on sequence homology to known miRNAs [6],
sequence profiles [7], characteristic secondary structure

features and/or evolutionary conservation among different species [8-12]. Some approaches use both sequence
and secondary structure conservation to known miRNA
precursors [13,14]. Berezikov et al. [15] use phylogenetic
shadowing to derive a general conservation profile from
miRNA precursor sequences of 10 primate species
which is used to search for new miRNAs. Ab initio
approaches are able to discover miRNAs in a genome
without using sequence homology or conservation (see
e.g. [16] and references therein).
Three non-human primate genomes have been fully
sequenced and are publicly available, including rhesus
monkey (Macaca mulatta), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). While for the
first two species genome-wide comparative miRNA studies have been published recently [17,18], the current
list of miRNAs reported in miRBase [19] (most found
in [15]) is still largely incomplete and comprises only
84 sequences. According to recent estimates supported
by both genetic and fossil evidence [20], divergence of

the human and ape (chimpanzee) lineages occurred
about 6 million years ago (mya), orangutan and African
apes diverged about 14 mya from their common ancestor, and hominoids and Old World monkeys (like rhesus macaque) about 23 mya.

Methods
The comparative method favored in this study uses various sequence- and structure-based filters to find
miRNA homologs. A combination of multiple filters not
only captures more diverse aspects of miRNAs, but
allows lower thresholds (lower specificity) to be used for
each individual filter. This again is essential for detecting
homologs that are more distant (in sequence) and allows
a broader selection of more different subtypes of
miRNAs.
Furthermore, different filters and thresholds are
applied for accepting or rejecting a miRNA candidate
which excludes a (small) third set of undecided predictions. This is to increase the confidence in both positive
and negative predictions, i.e., to better control the number of false positives and false negatives.
Homology-based analysis

The genomes of the three non-human primates were
downloaded from the Ensembl database (release 50,
http://www.ensembl.org). The currently known miRNAs
in human were retrieved from the miRBase database
[19] (release 12.0, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) and
comprise 695 hairpin sequences and 692 different
mature sequences. Many miRNAs in miRBase have been
identified computationally in homology studies. The
human hairpin sequences were aligned against the three
primate genomes using NCBI BLAST [21] (offline version 2.2.18) with parameter settings -G 1 -E 1 -F F.
Among various settings tested here, this has been found
to increase the number of detected precursor homologs,
compared to the standard settings.
In a second-level BLAST analysis we check the conservation of mature miRNAs by aligning all mature
sequences known in human against the precursor
sequences predicted in the other primates. Because of
their small size, some query sequences did not produce
a BLAST hit or the alignment was incomplete. In these
few cases the alignment had to be manually corrected
and was extended to the length of the query sequence.
Secondary structure analysis

Structure folding, secondary structure sequence, and minimum free energy (MFE) of miRNA precursors are calculated by RNAfold from Vienna Package 1.6 [22]. The
absolute structure distance d, the percent structure distance Pd(p1, p2) and the percent structure identity (or similarity) Pid(p1, p2) are computed between the secondary

Page 2 of 6

structure sequences (in dot-bracket format) of two precursors p1 and p2:
d(p1 , p 2 )  d edit (p1 , p 2 ) | l(p1)  l(p 2 ) |
Pd (p1 , p 2 ) 

 100
min{l(p1),l(p 2 )}

Pid (p1 , p 2 )  100  Pd (p1 , p 2 )

(2)

(3)

All distances are based on the Levenshtein distance or
string edit distance d edit [23] which is the minimum
number of point mutations needed to transform one
sequence into the other. By subtracting the length difference in Equation 1 we reduce its influence on the
overall distance.
Filtering microRNA homologs

Multiple filtering steps are to be passed by a candidate
sequence to be accepted as a homolog of a human
miRNA precursor. Only one (the best) BLAST hit is
selected and processed.
(1) Precursor sequence filter: minimum 85 percent
sequence identity over an alignment length of at least
95 percent
(2) Structure sequence filter: minimum 85 percent
identity in secondary structure sequence
(3) Hairpin filter: minimum 15 base pairs in the stem
arm and only one terminal loop
(4) Seed filter: no mutations in the seed region of the
mature sequence
A cascade of Perl scripts makes the filtering process
fully automatic. The selection of thresholds is partly
motivated by the comparative analysis in Section Results
and discussion. An absolute maximum of -10 kcal/mol
is imposed on the MFE of a hairpin structure. This is
the highest value found among known human miRNAs.
The same applies to the required minimum of 15 base
pairs.
The seed region is expanded to positions 2-9 [24] (from
the 5’ end) and extracted from each human mature
miRNA. The 8mers are aligned against the mature homologs using perfect matching by Perl regular expressions.
A miRNA candidate (best BLAST match) is rejected,
instead, and a homolog is said to be not exiting in a
genome if the sequence identity drops below 70 percent.

Results and discussion
Comparative sequence and structure analysis

Figure 1 compares the number of precursor miRNAs
predicted in the three non-human primates when filtering with different minimum thresholds of sequence

identity. At a threshold of 85 percent, the number of
pre-miRNAs begins to converge and is nearly the same
in all genomes. With higher thresholds the total numbers of predictions decrease while the differences
between species increase. Only 40.8 percent of the precursors are 100 percent identical between human and
orangutan (ppy), compared to 60.3 percent between
human and chimpanzee (ptr). It is interesting to see
that above 95 percent identity the number of homologs
found in orangutan is closer to the level of rhesus macaque (mml) than of chimpanzee. This could mean that,
on the miRNA level, the evolutionary distance to human
is actually more similar for orangutan and rhesus. It
remains unclear, however, how far these figures are
influenced by differences in sequencing quality between
the non-human primate genomes.
miRNA homologs with perfect (100 percent) or nearperfect (around 98 percent) sequence identity allow us
to assume that these are likely functional (as in human).
Candidate sequences with less but more than 85 percent
similarity - true for 38 percent of the precursor homologs found in orangutan - require the verification of
more miRNA features.
One important aspect is how well the structure of a
miRNA precursor is preserved. Already a few nucleotide
mutations can imply large structural changes or even
disrupt the hairpin structure completely (see below). In
Figure 2 frequency distributions of precursor homologs
are plotted over the percent structure identity. As
defined in Section Methods, this is calculated between
the predicted secondary structure sequences. The vast
majority of structures meets a minimum requirement of
80 percent identity. For primate species more closely
related to human, this distribution is more shifted

bins include all structures with ≥ x and < x + 10 percent identity.

towards 100 percent. 73.0 percent of the precursor
homologs found in chimpanzee show no change in
structure compared to human. For the most part this is
due to a 100 percent identical sequence (see Figure 1).
This number compares to only 52.7 percent in orangutan and to 42.5 percent in rhesus monkey. Again, the
distributions between orangutan and rhesus macaque
are more similar than between orangutan and
chimpanzee.
Figures 3 contains the frequency distributions of
nucleotide mismatches (including deletions and insertions) in the mature subsequence. First, it demonstrates
that the total number of single nucleotide mutations in
mature miRNA homologs varies between 0-2 only with few exceptions - and, second, that the prevailing
number of mature sequences - 89.4/79.1/75.7 percent
for ptr/ppy/mml - is identical to the human counterpart.

Mutations in the mature region are, obviously, most
important for explaining phenotypic differences between
humans and primates. Except for requiring a 100 percent conservation of the seed region, we do not further
limit the number of mutations in the mature sequence.
Because miRNA-target binding shows near-perfect complementarity, the seed is less variable such that mutations are less likely under positive selection.
As an example, the multiple sequence alignment for
pre-miRNA mir-618 is given in Figure 4 together with
the corresponding secondary structure sequences and
stem-loop structures. Absolute distances to the human
version (hsa) are given in number of point mutations. In
case of orangutan, only a few nucleotide mutations
imply a significantly higher number of local changes in
the structure sequence. The global structure is, however,
much less affected. Actually, the stem region - including
the mature sequence - is the same as predicted for
chimpanzee. In case of rhesus macaque, on the other
hand, the basic stem-loop structure is still preserved
even with many nucleotide mutations.

MicroRNA gene identification in orangutan

Lists of positive and negative predictions from our analyses are provided in the supplementary material (see
Section Additional files). Additional file 1 contains all
605 homologs of human precursor miRNAs found for
orangutan, including 77 sequences which are already
known (i.e. in miRBase). 18 homologs are identical or
have an overlapping genome location with another
miRNA. This leaves 510 newly discovered miRNAs in
total.
Besides known miRNAs, candidates are marked in
Additional file 1 that pass various other filters (see Section Methods). This allows a flexible combination of filtering criteria, including those derived from the
precursor structure or the mature sequence. 526 orthologs (from 605) remain after applying the hairpin filter
and 494 after the seed filter. Here, we also utilize the
existence (detection) of a miRNA homolog in more than
one primate species (besides human). This is to improve
the reliability of predictions and helps to reduce the
effect of possible sequencing errors. In our setup,

499 human precursor miRNAs are found to have a
homologous sequence in all three primates. 563 miRNAs
are conserved in both chimpanzee and orangutan, and
530 are shared between orangutan and rhesus macaque.
Additional file 2 lists all homologs of human mature
miRNAs found in the orangutan precursors. The
682 entries include homologs of both 5’ and 3’ miRNAs,
some originating from the same precursor. 611 human
mature miRNAs are conserved in at least one orangutan
precursor, resulting in 624 different sequences.
Identification of lineage-specific microRNAs

Another question of interest is which and how many
miRNAs are lineage- or species-specific. Our analysis
especially supports the identification of human-specific
miRNAs. Since we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some homologs may not be found because of
erroneous or incomplete genome assembly, we require
the negative prediction of a miRNA to be confirmed by
our method in at least two of the three non-human primate genomes at hand. Additional file 3 lists all
35 homologs which are missing in this way. 12 human
miRNAs could not be identified in any of the three primate genomes and, thus, are the most likely to be
human-specific. These in particular may be responsible
for phenotypic differences between human and nonhuman primates, i.e., may help to explain what makes
us human.
Sequence and structural similarities to a human
miRNA are strong indications for a putative homolog to
be transcribed and functional. Nevertheless, the expression levels of both miRNAs may differ due to alterations
in the specific regulatory pathway that controls their
expression. In addition, the regulatory effects, i.e., the
selection and expression of target genes, may be significantly different. This is due to a fast evolution of
miRNA binding sites [25] which led to many lineage- or
species-specific sites and is just as responsible for what
makes us different from other primates.

Conclusion
In this comparative study we searched the genomes of
three non-human primates for miRNAs. The applied
prediction algorithm (outlined in Section Methods) verifies multiple criteria based on similarities to known
human miRNAs in sequence and structure to detect
both closely-related and more distantly-related homologs. The parallel analysis allows, in particular, the prediction of a miRNA in multiple species to be used as an
additional filter. In return, it provides some support for
the configuration of the method, i.e., for the parameter
settings (thresholds) and filter definitions used here. The

other results of this study may be summarized as
follows:
(1) A thorough and comprehensive search for novel
orangutan miRNAs. More than 500 putative miRNA
genes have been identified, where the precursor
sequence is at least 85 percent identical to its ortholog
in human.
(2) Both sequence distances and structure distances to
human miRNAs have been found to be more similar for
orangutan and rhesus macaque than for orangutan and
chimpanzee, indicating a more similar evolutionary distance to human on the miRNA level.
(3) The proportion of identical or nearly identical precursor sequences with human has been found relatively
small for all three primate species, considering the evolutionary distances and compared to the mature
sequences. Only about 40 percent are the same in
human and orangutan.
(4) Identification of common and lineage-specific miRNAs. 499 miRNA sequences are conserved in all primates investigated here. 35 human miRNAs have not
been found in at least two non-human primate genomes
and some of which might actually be human-specific.
