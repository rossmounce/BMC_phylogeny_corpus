Abstract
Background: In acoustic species, traits such as male calling song are likely to diverge quickly between
allopatric populations due to sexual selection, and divergence in parameters such as carrier frequency,
chirp structure, and other important song characters can influence sexual isolation. Here we make use of
two forms of Mormon crickets to examine differences in a broad suite of traits that have the potential to
influence speciation via sexual isolation. Mormon crickets in "gregarious" populations aggregate into dense
migratory bands, and females are the sexually competitive Fsex (sex-role reversal). There is also a nonoutbreak "solitary" form. These two forms are largely but not perfectly correlated with a significant
mtDNA subdivision within the species that is thought to have arisen in allopatry. Combined information
about multiple, independently evolving traits, such as morphology and structural and behavioural
differences in calling song, provides greater resolution of the overall differences between these allopatric
populations, and allows us to assess their stage of divergence. We test two predictions, first that the forms
differ in song and second that gregarious males are more reluctant to sing than solitary males due to sex
role reversal. We also tested for a difference in the relationship between the size of the forewing
resonator, the mirror, and carrier frequency, as most models of sound production in crickets indicate that
mirror size should predict carrier frequency.
Results: Multivariate analyses showed that solitary and gregarious individuals from different populations
representing the two mtDNA clades had almost non-overlapping distributions based on multiple song and
morphological measurements. Carrier frequency differed between the two, and gregarious males were
more reluctant to sing overall. Mirror size predicted carrier frequency; however, the relationship between
mirror size and surface area varied between solitary and gregarious forms, suggesting that factors above
and beyond mirror size contribute to carrier frequency.
Conclusion: The two clades of Mormon crickets differ in a broad suite of independent traits that
probably justify subspecies status (the two can successfully mate so may not be reproductively isolated).
However, our results emphasize the importance of carefully distinguishing the ultimate causation of
differences between traits used to delineate species or subspecies boundaries.

Background
Sexually selected traits – such as male calling song – have
been suggested to be particularly susceptible to divergence
in allopatrically isolated populations [1], and sexual selection-induced differences in song have been proposed to
be significant drivers of speciation [2-6]. Differences in
male song may evolve particularly rapidly, sometimes
even more rapidly than sexual isolation [1,7,8]. Regardless of the ultimate causation, divergence in such characters may be an important indicator of subspecies or
incipient speciation events [6,7,9,10].
The most common mechanism for singing in insects is
stridulation, where specialised areas of the body are made
to oscillate by striking against stridulatory pegs [11-13]. In
katydids (or bushcrickets)(Tettigoniidae), the tegmina are
modified so that during each wing-stroke, pegs on the
stridulatory file of the upper (left) elytron strike the plectrum on the lower (right) elytron, causing the mirror, a
circular membrane situated next to the plectrum, to
vibrate [12-14]. In some ensiferan species, particularly
Gryllidae, oscillation of the mirror (or harp in gryllids) is
not damped between peg strikes and thus calls are "musical", or pure tone. However, many katydids, especially
those found in the northern hemisphere, do not produce
pure tone songs because resonance from each peg strike is
highly damped before the onset of the next peg strike (see
figure 1). Under the "clockwork cricket" model of stridulation developed from studies of Gryllus campestris
[15,16], the dominant or carrier frequency of male song is
determined by properties of the harp, and in tettigonids,
the length of the mirror frame has been suggested to determine carrier frequency [17].
Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex, Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae, Tettigoniinae) are flightless katydids ranging
throughout the American west that occur in solitary and
gregarious forms. Solitary individuals comprise all populations on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and
are cryptically coloured brown or green, whereas gregarious individuals are more widely distributed in the west,
are typically black in colour and aggregate into destructive
migratory bands that can travel up to 2 km per day
[18,19]. Their banding behaviour reduces the risk of predation [20] and they may occur at densities over a thousand times higher than in solitary populations [21].
Solitary and gregarious Mormon crickets have different
mating systems. Gwynne [22] demonstrated that Mormon crickets are sex-role reversed at high population density, with females competing for matings with
discriminating males. Male tettigoniids transfer a spermatophylax (attached to the spermatophore) to females
upon mating [23], and this "nuptial gift" represents an
important food source for females when there is a greater

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/5

proportion of sexually active females, as is the case when
food availability is low in the dry sagebrush habitats
where gregarious outbreaks occur [21,22,24,25]. Few
studies have examined differences in male song in rolereversed ensiferans. Role-reversed males of the tettigoniid,
Metaballus litus, produce a different type of song than typical males, and males from typical conditions facultatively
change their song type when transferred to role-reversed
sites [26]. In pollen feeding katydids Kawanaphila nartee,
fewer males were observed singing in role-reversed populations that did not have access to high quality food [27].
The number of males and females available for mating,
and thus mating roles and the proportion of singing
males, can vary over relatively short geographical distances due to microhabitat differences between populations of this flightless species [27]. The proportion of
calling males may also vary over time. For example, in the
gryllid Gryllus campestris, more males adopted a calling
strategy during the course of one breeding season when
population density decreased and the sex ratio became
increasingly skewed towards males [28]. In a tettigoniid,
Ephippiger ephippiger, song traits vary under experimental
conditions of role reversal [29]. Role-reversed males sang
less frequently and at a lower intensity, but female preferences for one important song trait remained unchanged
[29]. In natural populations of Mormon crickets, males at
low-density (i.e. solitary) sites called for longer periods of
time than those at high-density (i.e. gregarious) sites,
mainly because females were attracted quickly in the latter
sites [21], but neither reluctance to sing (the incidence of
singing males) nor structural differences in song have previously been investigated.
Recent mtDNA studies have uncovered a significant
genetic division within Mormon crickets that broadly corresponds to western gregarious populations and eastern
solitary populations [31]. Molecular clock arguments suggest that this division is approximately 2 million years
old, and the two lineages likely represent discrete evolutionary histories [31]. Role reversal and sexual selection
during periods of allopatry have the potential to influence
male calling song evolution and morphology, but here we
do not attempt to disentangle the causative effects of these
two processes. Instead, we examine song and morphological parameters to address two questions. First, do the two
forms differ across a broad suite of traits? Second, are gregarious males more reluctant to sing than solitary males?
A key prediction is that in gregarious populations, song
parameters will reflect the consistently weaker sexual
selection on males due to role-reversal plus selection to
decrease the risk of attracting natural enemies attracted to
song [23,32]. Following this prediction, we expect that
gregarious males will be less likely to initiate singing, and
that if they do sing, they will chirp more slowly and use
less of their stridulatory file during each wing stroke (due

to relaxed sexual selection). We also test whether carrier
frequency (Cf) and the allometric relationship between
mirror size and carrier frequency differs between the
forms. Finally, in line with Gwynne's [21] observation
that sexual size dimorphism is more pronounced in gregarious populations (with females larger than males),
relaxed sexual selection on gregarious males might be
expected to increase their variance in body size relative to
that of gregarious females and solitary males.

Results and discussion
Differences between forms
A principal components analysis almost completely distinguished the solitary (eastern clade) and gregarious
(western clade) crickets (Figure 2). Most of the variation

(89.00%) in the first principal components axis was
between the two cricket forms (F1,56 = 218.89, P < 0.001)
with only a small (0.72%) and non-significant (F3,56 =
1.84, NS) component amongst populations within forms.
We therefore pooled populations into gregarious and solitary forms for further analyses. In a multivariate discriminant analysis, cross-validation successfully classified all
samples into the correct form, and the traits with the highest loadings on the discriminant function were: head capsule width (HCW), elytral surface area and mirror surface
area (which get smaller in the first principal components
axis), and carrier frequency, chirp rate and peg strike rate
(which get greater in the first principal components axis).
Thus solitary males had smaller HCWs, smaller elytral surface area, smaller mirror surface areas, higher carrier fre-

quencies, chirped faster and had more peg strikes per wing
stroke (table 1). Temperature did not have an effect on
chirp rate or the number of peg strikes per chirp, but solitary individuals chirped faster than gregarious ones (GLM:
F1,57 = 139.28, P < 0.001) and used more stridulatory pegs
for each wing stroke (GLM: F1,57 = 20.77, P < 0.001).
Despite these differences in song structure, the number of
stridulatory pegs did not differ between solitary and gregarious males (t-test: t59 = 1.24, NS) (table 1).
As expected, carrier frequency (Cf) varied negatively with
size (HCW) and mirror surface area, however, there were
unexpected aspects to this relationship (figure 3). A full
GLM showed that form, mirror surface area, and size all
independently influenced Cf, (table 2). Perhaps most
interestingly, the relationship between mirror surface area
and Cf varied between the forms (figure 3, table 2), which
is not predicted if Cf is solely determined by mirror surface
area, and suggests that there were effects beyond differences due to size. Solitary males have a higher Cf independent of mirror size, and the slope of the regression of
Cf on mirror size is steeper in solitary crickets (figure 3,
table 2).
There are two levels of explanation – proximate (mechanistic) and ultimate (evolutionary) – that can address
these differences. On a proximate level, the factors that
predict Cf may differ between forms. Under the "clockwork cricket" model of stridulation developed from studies of the pure-tone gryllid Gryllus campestris [15,16], the
stridulatory file represents an escapement mechanism
whereby the force (peg strike) causing vibration of the
oscillator (harp) is delivered at evenly spaced time intervals due to the incremental slippage and striking of pegs
upon the plectrum in much the same way a clock escapement functions. This model predicts that physical properties of the mirror – for example size, shape and tension –
predict Cf [15]. In Mormon crickets, it is possible that the
tension of the mirror differs between forms, but visual
analysis of mirrors did not suggest differences in cuticle
density. An alternative model developed from studies of
the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus suggests that the volume of the subalar space – a pocket of air enclosed by the
raised tegmina during singing – acts as an acoustic resonator for this gryllid [33]. Gryllids may vary the volume of
this space, and thus the Cf of their calls, using auditory
feedback control [33]. This model has received recent criticism [34]. Our study did not explicitly examine all the
factors that may predict Cf in Mormon crickets; however,
the fact that the relationship between mirror size and Cf
varies between forms suggests that there may be variation
between forms in the density or tension of the mirror or
the subalar volume.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/5

Other song parameters also varied between forms. Solitary and gregarious Mormon crickets did not differ in the
number of pegs on their stridulatory files, but solitary
crickets used significantly more pegs during each wing
stroke and chirped faster. Thus during an average wingstroke, solitary individuals struck a greater proportion of
their stridulatory pegs on the plectrum. Whether these differences are sufficient to influence female preference is
unknown, but fine details of stridulatory peg strikes can
influence preference in other tettigoniid species [35].
What ultimately accounts for the morphological and song
differences between forms? Gwynne [21] concluded that
sex-role reversal caused sexual selection to be stronger on
females than males in gregarious populations. Sex-role
reversal has been shown to cause changes in song parameters in other tettigoniid species in lab experiments [29]
and in the wild [27], and gregarious Mormon crickets are
likely to have experienced historically consistent sex-role
reversal [21]. Since carrier frequency and chirp rate can
convey information about present and past body condition [36,37] and variation in male song can be subject to
strong sexual selection [2,3,38-40], it is almost certain that
solitary and gregarious cricket populations have experienced differing sexual selection pressures on their calls.
However, the forms also broadly correspond with discrete
genetic lineages that split during the Pleistocene [31] and
song differences can arise via drift during allopatric separation [8]. Drift in allopatry can lead to differences in phenotypic characters important in sexual selection, but it is
unlikely to have a directional effect. In Mormon crickets,
the direction of almost all differences we uncovered is
consistent with the predictions we made based on the previously documented differences [21,22,24] in sexual
selection between solitary populations and role-reversed
gregarious populations. Gregarious males, as predicted,
were more reluctant to sing overall, chirped more slowly
independent of temperature, and struck fewer pegs on
their plectrum during elytral closing, so we conclude that
most of the differences detected here are likely to have
arisen in response to sexual selection
Reluctance to sing
Past results [21,22] have indicated that gregarious males
should experience diminished sexual selection on song
and increased potential to discriminate among females,
which we predicted would make them more reluctant to
sing. In this study, gregarious males were more reluctant
to sing overall (G-test: G1 = 4.38, P = 0.036) (figure 4),
however while year was not significant as a main effect (Gtest: G1 = 2.04, NS), temporal variation in this behaviour
was inferred from a significant interaction between year
and form (G-test: G1 = 10.64, P < 0.05). Gregarious males
were more reluctant to sing in 2004, but in 2005 solitary
males were more reluctant to sing.

Solitary and
Solitary and gregarious Mormon crickets were almost completely distinguishable based on the first axis of a principal components analysis. As the first PC axis increases, HCW, elytral surface area and mirror surface area are smaller, whereas chirp
rate, carrier frequency and peg strike rate are greater.

Temporal or spatial variation in the number of males and
females available for mating [27] could account for this
difference, in the sense that phonotaxis to song by natural
enemies is likely to cause males to produce less risky calls
when many receptive females are available for mating
[23]. Numerous studies of ensiferan species have identified acoustically-orienting predators and parasites and
adaptations for avoiding them [41-44]. Parasitism risk has

been shown to be a significant selection pressure on calling parameters in Teleogryllus oceanicus, with crickets in
parasitized populations being less likely to sing because
parasitoid flies acoustically orient towards singing T. oceanicus males [42,45]. Natural enemies of Mormon crickets
and other tettigoniids include acoustically orienting vertebrates and possibly ormiine flies [23]. In Mormon crickets, sexual selection pressure on male song may be

is no interaction between sexual size dimorphism
(inferred from head capsule width) and form (GLM: F1,82
= 2.48, NS) (figure 5b). Variance in size did not differ
between solitary and gregarious males and females for
either pronotum length (F-test: F = 2.55, NS) or head capsule width (F-test: F = 3.84, NS).
These findings do not concur with Gwynne's [21], that
females are larger than males only in gregarious rolereversed populations. Additionally, we found similar variance between sexes and phases, which does not support
our hypothesis that gregarious males have experienced
relaxed sexual selection. Our results suggest that these
measurements of sexual size dimorphism are unlikely to
accurately reflect the intensity of sexual selection in these
populations. This should ideally be inferred by demonstrating differential mating success directly resulting from
variation in the trait of interest [46].

Conclusion
The behavioural and morphological differences we have
found between solitary and gregarious Mormon cricket
populations are consistent with the previous discovery of
a genetic division that implies a distinct Pleistocene history. Some of these differences are expected given our predictions based on differences in natural history and sexual
selection between phases. The unusual variation in the
relationship between mirror size and carrier frequency is
more surprising, however, and the variation in song frequency in Mormon crickets provides an opportunity for
further research into the different models of sound production.
One definition of subspecies is that they should show
"concordant distributions of multiple, independent,
genetically based traits" [47]. The concept of subspecies
has been contentious, yet it remains very important for
evolutionary biology and conservation, and comparative
studies suggest the taxonomic rank has validity [48]. Two

mtDNA clades of Mormon crickets broadly correspond to
gregarious and solitary forms [31], and we show here that
the two forms are distinct when a broad suite of morphological and song traits are considered together. These animals therefore seem to satisfy subspecies criteria. Solitary
and gregarious Mormon crickets from the different clades
are capable of successfully mating and transferring spermatophores (pers. obs.), although observations on postcopulatory reproductive isolation are lacking. The existence of a population that is consistently solitary, but phylogenetically and geographically clustered with the
gregarious populations [31] suggests that recent or ongoing gene flow between the groups occurs, so they are
probably not reproductively isolated.

number of stridulatory pegs, carrier frequency (Cf), chirp
rate and the number of peg strikes per wing stroke.

An additional caveat is that our results emphasize the
importance of considering the development and causation of divergence in traits used to infer taxonomic distinctions. While differences in most song parameters we
studied in Mormon crickets support consistent and strong
selection, other behavioural traits like reluctance to sing
appear to be very flexible. Species or subspecies boundaries may be obfuscated by plasticity in the traits used to
define them, especially song parameters [49], and future
studies should carefully address the extent to which such
differences are plastic, and their influence on reproductive
isolation.

In 2004, reluctance to sing was assessed by placing individual males in a cylindrical mesh cage (approx. 30 cm in
diameter and 45 cm long) placed half in sunlight and half
in shade in an enclosed chamber. In these experiments,
males always moved to the sunny portion of the cage
regardless of whether they sang or not (pers. obs.). Mormon crickets can sing continuously for many consecutive
minutes, or song can be broken into shorter bouts of singing. Individual chirps are produced during the closing
motion of the wings and each peg strike produces highly
damped oscillations of the mirror (Figure 1). Calling
activity was recorded for 10 minutes using a Sennheiser
ME 66 directional microphone with a K6 powering module and a sampling rate of 96,000 samples per second. The
microphone had a nominal frequency response of 50 Hz
to 20 kHz, so frequencies above 20 kHz were unlikely to
be obtained (carrier frequency of Mormon cricket songs in
this study ranged from 11.6 kHz to 14.4 kHz). Recordings
were made digitally in the field using Sony Sound Forge
7.0a software (Sony Pictures Digital Inc. 2003) installed
on a laptop computer. Air temperature in the shade was
noted using a thermocouple accurate to the nearest tenth
of a degree Centigrade. We used 24 solitary males and 24
gregarious males, chosen randomly, and all trials were run
between 8:30 am and 1:00 pm when Mormon crickets are
most active. In 2005, the experiment was performed in the
field as close to the original population as possible but far
enough away to be out of hearing range of other singing
crickets (approx. 1 km). The mesh cage (approximately 10
cm in diameter and 25 cm long) was placed in a clump of
sagebrush, and the rest of the experiment was as before.
Seventeen gregarious males and 10 solitary males were
used. We tested whether the incidence of singing versus
non-singing males differed between solitary and gregarious populations and between years using a 3-factor G test
[50].

Methods
Study populations
Three gregarious populations were sampled in northwestern Colorado near Dinosaur National Monument
and are coded LE, CO and TM. Solitary populations were
sampled at Kelly Flats (KF) and Indian Meadows (IM) in
the Poudre Canyon on the eastern slope of the Colorado
Rockies. Due to their highly discontinuous distribution,
the three gregarious populations were about 300 km away
from the two solitary populations.

We used two multivariate analyses to examine differences
between the forms. First, a principal components analysis
was carried out to see if the solitary and gregarious forms
were distinct based on multiple traits (with no prior
assumptions about what differences might exist). We
tested whether we could combine populations within
form for subsequent analyses using an unbalanced nested
general linear model (GLM) on the scores from the first
principal components axis with form and population as
factors. We also carried out a discriminant function analysis with 'form' as the classification variable, using crossvalidation, to examine which traits contributed to differences between the solitary and gregarious forms. Both
analyses used the following morphological and behavioural measurements: head capsule width (HCW), total
surface area of the lower elytron, mirror surface area,

Reluctance to sing
'Reluctance to sing' experiments were performed in two
separate summers: June and July of 2004 and 2005. In
both years, adult solitary males were captured from KF
and IM, and adult gregarious males were captured from
LE. Subjects were fed an excess of lettuce, yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) and seed heads from grasses, and
kept in same-sex cages with approximately 15 individuals
for at least three days, to ensure that males who may have
mated previously replenished their accessory glands,
which produce the complex spermatophore.

In-situ recordings
In a separate experiment to test the relationship between
carrier frequency and mirror size, gregarious males were

recorded in the field from LE, TM and CO (n = 16, n = 8
and n = 16) and solitary males were recorded from IM and
KF (n = 10 and n = 11) during June and July of 2005 as
before. Care was taken not to disturb the crickets while
they were being recorded. The temperature at the time of
recording was noted, and after each male stopped singing
it was captured and preserved in ethanol. Carrier frequency (Cf) was determined by analysing five randomly
chosen one-quarter second samples per individual using a
Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) of size 32,768 with a Blackman-Harris smoothing window, and the average was used
in analyses.
To determine what factors predicted Cf, we used a full
GLM with temperature, head capsule width (HCW), form
and mirror surface area as the independent variables. In
tettigonids, the length of the mirror frame has been suggested to determine carrier frequency [17]; however, Mormon cricket mirrors are unusual in that they are almost
perfectly circular. The frequency produced by a circular
membrane is expected to vary according to the following
equation:
f = [k/D]*[√(T/σ)]

(1)

where k is a constant, D is diameter of the membrane, T is
tension of the membrane and σ is the density of the membrane [51]. If T and σ remain constant, D can be expressed
in terms of surface area (Sa) as √(4Sa/π) and substituting
into (1) gives:
f = b/[√(Sa)]

Morphology
We measured head capsule width (HCW), pronotum
length, number of stridulatory pegs, the total surface area
of the lower elytron and mirror surface area for all males.
A small sample of 12 gregarious (LE) and 12 solitary (KF
and IM) females were also measured for HCW and pronotum length to assess any sexual dimorphism, as described
by Gwynne [21], who found that females were larger than
males in gregarious populations but not in solitary populations. We assessed this using a GLM with sex, form and
two interaction terms as factors. We also tested for any differences in variance in size between sexes and forms using
an F-test.

where b is constant and Sa is mirror surface area. Given
this expected inverse square root relationship between Cf
and mirror surface area, we transformed mirror surface
area by inverting then taking the square root of the variable before adding it as a factor to the linear model. We
included two interaction terms; one between phase and
HCW, and the other between phase and mirror surface
area. The final model was reduced to form, mirror surface
area, HCW and a form×mirror surface area interaction
term.

For each recording, we counted the average number of
wing-strokes per second and the average number of peg
strikes against the plectrum within each wing stroke.
Given that chirp rate in other tettigoniines has been
shown to be a linear function of temperature [52], we
included temperature as a factor in separate GLMs testing
whether chirp rate and average peg strikes per chirp differed between forms.
