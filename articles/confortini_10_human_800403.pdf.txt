Abstract
Background: There is conclusive evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the cervix are a necessary
cause of cervical cancer. In Italy there are consistent data of HPV prevalence in women aged 25 - 64 years, but there is
limited data for younger women. The objective of this on-going 3-year prospective cohort study is to investigate the
prevalence, acquisition, clearance and persistence of HPV infections in young Tuscan women and the risk factors
correlated with such events.
Methods: One thousand and sixty-six women aged between 18 and 24 years were enrolled and received an initial HPV
test. They were asked to return to the clinic over the study period for further tests every 12 months, if their HPV HR
result was negative, or every 6 months, if positive. Additionally, women with an HPV positive result were given a
cytological examination and if the cytological diagnosis was ASC-US or more severe, only women with HPV HR, were
referred for colposcopy.
Results: We present here data for the enrolment phase of the study. At baseline, within the study sample, just under
30% of women were infected by HPV and 19.3% of women were infected with oncogenic types. A relationship was
highlighted between HPV infection, number of sexual partners (in particularly in the last 3 years) and the lifetime
number of partner's partners. Condom use showed a slight protective effect in univariate analysis but these data were
not statistically significant in multivariate analysis. The association between HPV infection and demographic and
behavioural variables were tested by crude odds ratio (OR). Multivariate logistic regression was applied to compute the
adjusted odds ratios.
Conclusions: The prevalence of oncogenic HPV types was high in young Tuscan women. The 3-year follow-up of this
cohort may provide a better understanding of the processes of acquisition, clearance and persistence of infection and
the correlated risk factors.
Background
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in
women worldwide and knowledge regarding its cause and
pathogenesis is rapidly expanding. Although there is conclusive evidence that infection of the cervix by some
types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary
cause of cervical cancer [1,2] the discrepancy between the

high frequency of HPV infections in young, sexually
active women and the relatively low occurrence of cervical lesions in the same population suggests that HPV is
not a sufficient cause for cervical neoplasia [3]. There is
evidence that most HPV infections are transient and only
women who harbour a persistent HPV infection are likely
to develop a cervical lesion [4,5].
The accumulated evidence that high risk types (HPV
HR) are a necessary cause of cervical cancer has led to the
design of prophylactic vaccines. The currently licensed
vaccines are Gardasil (Merck Pharmaceuticals) and Cer-

varix (GlaxoSmithKline) and protect against infection by
HPV types 6, 11, 16 & 18 and types 16 & 18, respectively.
The vaccines, both of which have been approved for girls
and young women, are designed to prevent 90% of all
genital warts and 70% of all cervical cancers (Gardasil)
and 70% of all cervical cancers (Cervarix). Studies have
shown that types 6 & 11 are responsible for 90% of genital
warts and types 16 & 18 for 70% of cervical cancers. In
Italy, there are consistent HPV prevalence data based on
NTCC studies for women aged 25 - 64 years [6,7] but
there is a paucity of data for younger women [8]. The
objective of this prospective cohort study is to investigate
the prevalence, acquisition, clearance and persistence of
HPV types in unvaccinated women aged 18 - 24 years and
the risk factors correlated with such events. For this age
group, that precedes the onset of screening, there are
very limited data of HPV prevalence in Italy. This ongoing 3-year prospective cohort study was initiated in
June 2007. Here we report the baseline results.

Methods
Study population

The study sample was recruited from three areas of Tuscany (Florence, Valdarno Aretino and Viareggio - respectively, urban, rural, and coastal areas) each with good
experience in delivering population-based cervical cancer
screening programmes which, following Italian national
guidelines [9], include a triennial recall of all women aged
25 - 64 years for a Pap test.
With the intention to enrol at least 1000 women and on
the assumption of a 10% and 15% compliance to invitation, approximately 8000 women aged 18 - 24 years were
randomly selected from Tuscan population registries, and
were sent a letter with a request that they participate by
calling and fixing an appointment. In cases of no
response, a reminder was sent.
Protocol

The study protocol is briefly summarized in the following
lines and shown graphically in Figure 1. At enrolment,
women were not considered eligible, if they were not sexually active, were pregnant, had undergone hysterectomy,
had been treated for CIN, had a genetic, chronic or dysmetabolic disease, were vaccinated for HPV or had an
immunodeficiency disease. All eligible women received
an initial HPV test. They were asked to return to the
clinic for a further test at 12 months, if their HPV HR
result was negative, or at 6 months, if positive. Additionally, women with an HPV HR positive result were given a
cytological examination and, if the cytological diagnosis
was ASC-US or more severe, were referred for a colposcopy. Women who were HPV LR positive were not
referred for colposcopy whatever their cytological diagnosis. If the colposcopy result was negative women were

recalled to repeat the HPV test after 6 months, but if positive, the suspicious areas identified by colposcopy were
biopsied. Histology was read locally by pathologists and
was not masked to cytology or HPV result. Women followed the routine protocol of treatment or follow-up
according to histological results. This regime is being
repeated throughout the 3-year study period.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee
in each area.
Examination

At enrolment, trained midwives explained the study aims
and procedures. A written informed consent was given by
each participating woman. The cervical cell samples,
obtained by using a plastic Ayre's spatula and a cytobrush, were put in PreservCyt solution (ThinPrep; Cytyc
Corporation, Boxborough, MA) and were used for HPV
testing and for cytological examination.
Participants provided information on socio-demographic characteristics and sexual history. In a face-toface, standardized interview participants gave information on age, race/ethnicity, education, occupation, reproductive and menstrual factors, number of pregnancies
and smoking habits, and in a self-administered questionnaire at the clinic participants provided information on
sexual history - age at first intercourse, age of the first
partner at time of first intercourse, number of sexual
partners in participant's lifetime and in the last year, lifetime number of partner's partners and use of contraceptive methods and condoms. During subsequent visits to
the clinic, information on changes in smoking and sexual
habits since baseline examination was requested, and
endo- and ectocervical cells from the uterine cervix were
collected.
HPV Testing

The Hybrid Capture 2 assay (HC2; Digene Corporation,
Gaithersburg, MD) was used for HPV testing. The two
groups of probes designed to detect high-risk HPV types
(16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, & 68) and lowrisk types (6, 11, 42, 43, 44) were used. Four mL of PreservCyt sample was processed with the Sample Conversion Kit (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD)
followed by an HC2 assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. HC2 results were expressed in Relative Light Units (RLU) as the ratio of the specimen's light
emission to that of three concurrently tested 1 pg/mL
HPV DNA controls. An RLU is an (indirect) measure of
the specimen's viral concentration relative to 1 pg/mL.
Typing

All HPV HR positive samples were typed using the 'Consensus High Risk HPV genotyping' kit (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, USA). The test is based on the reverse
hybridization principle. Denaturated biotynilated ampli-

cons, resulting from the amplification of a part of the L1
region with GP5+/GP6+ primers, were hybridized with
specific oligonucleotide probes, which were immobilized
as parallel lines on membrane strips. After hybridization
and stringent washing, streptavidin-conjugated alkaline
phosphatase was added and bound to any previously
formed biotinylated hybrid. Incubation with chromogen
yielded a purple precipitate and the results could be visually interpreted. The kit allows an easy and reliable identification of 18 HPV HR types (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,
51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, & 82).The HPV HR positive samples that were negative in the PCR enzymelinked immunoadsorbent assay were typed with cycle
sequencing and analyzed on an ABI PRISM 310 DNA
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
All nucleotide sequences were analyzed and compared
with HPV type sequences in GenBank using BLAST 2.0
(NCBI-NLM-NHI Bethesda, MD). A sequence was considered a match if it had a 90% nucleotide identity to an
HPV sequence in GenBank.
In order to identify the HPV LR types, samples positive
for HC2 probe A (specific for LR types) were amplified
using specific primers for five HPV LR types (6, 11, 42,
43, and 44).The amplified products were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide, and observed under ultraviolet light.

HPV infections were defined by oncogenic risk ( i.e.
high or low risk) and phylogenetic species (species 1,
types 42 and 89; species 3, types 61, 62, 72, 81, 83 & 84;
species 5, types 26, 51 & 82; species 6, types 53, 56 & 66;
species 7, types 18, 39, 45, 59, 68 & 70; species 9, types 16,
31, 33, 35, 52, 58 & 67; species 10, types 6, 11 & 55).
Cytology

Liquid-based cytology was performed using the ThinPrep system (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA ) for
all women who were HPV positive [10,11]. One slide was
prepared for each woman according to the manufacturer's instructions. Abnormal slides were reviewed by a
panel of cytologists before they reported the results to the
women. Cytology was classified according to the
Bethesda 2001 Guidelines (TBS 2001) [12].
Statistical analysis

The association between HPV infection and demographic and behavioural variables was tested by crude
odds ratio (OR). Multivariate logistic regression was
applied to compute the adjusted odds ratios.
All variables were analyzed in the univariate analysis,
but in the multivariate analysis we adjusted the model for
the statistically significant variables and those variables
that, though not statistically significant, play an important biological role.

All tests were two-sided. Stata 10 software was used for
analysis.

Results
Recruitment commenced in June 2007 and was completed by June 2008 with the enrolment of 1066 women.
Seven women had been excluded as they did not meet the
eligibility criteria. In Florence, Valdarno Aretino and
Viareggio, respectively, 542, 289, and 235 women were
enrolled. The overall compliance to invitation was 15.7%
with no statistically relevant difference between areas
(15.4%, 16.2% and 15.8% for Florence, Valdarno Aretino
and Viareggio, respectively). The compliance by age is
shown in Table 1. The mean age of the participants at
enrolment was 21.6 years (SD = 1.87).
Prevalence at enrolment

Of the study sample, 206 (19.32%) women were HPV HR
positive and 107 (10.03%) were HPV LR positive. Table 1
shows the HR/LR status by age. Infections with HPV HR
types alone were detected in 146 (13.70%) women, infections with HPV LR types alone were detected in 47
(4.41%)women and co-infections by HPV HR and LR
types were detected in 60 (5.63%) women. HPV 16, the
most prevalent type (8.53%), was followed by types HPV
31 and HPV 56 (2.44%), HPV 51 (2.06%) and HPV 18
(1.88%). The HPV LR vaccine types, 6 & 11, were
detected in 3.47% and 4.12% of women, respectively. Coinfections with two or more HPV HR types were revealed
in 46 (4.32%) women. The prevalence of HPV HR vaccine
types, whether single or in co-infection, was 10.41%.
Concomitant HPV 16 & 18 infections were present in 5
women only (0.47%). The distribution of the 23 HPV
types identified, as a percentage of the total HPV positive
women (low and high risk), is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the prevalence by age for cervical HPV
infection by oncogenic risk (A) and phylogenic species
(B) (the types in a species having common biological and
pathological properties).

Cytology

The association between HPV infection and the presence
of cervical cytological abnormalities was examined in all
HPV positive participants. Table 2 shows the association
between cytological outcomes and classes of viral oncogenic risk. The only HSIL diagnosis was associated with
an HPV HR single infection. All cytological diagnoses
ASCUS +, in patients HPV LR positive, were associated
with HPV types 6 & 11.
Compliance to colposcopy was 82.76% (48/58): 18 had
negative results, 24 had histological diagnoses lower than
CIN2, 5 had a histological diagnosis CIN 2 and 1 had a
histological diagnosis CIN 3.
Univariate analysis

Table 3 shows the univariate analysis of participants'
socio-behavioural characteristics and HPV infection status. The median ages for the first sexual intercourse and
of the first partner were 17 and 19 years, respectively.
Some 64.2% of participants (719/1066) reported to have
had more than one partner and 11.1% of participants
reported more than four partners (3.3% missing). A lower
age at first intercourse, a greater number of sexual partners (in lifetime and in the last three years) and a greater
lifetime number of partner's partners were strongly associated with prevalence of HPV infection.
Some 45.1% of participants reported no current use of
oral contraception (8 missing). The current use of oral
contraceptives in the univariate analysis showed no effect
on prevalence of infection.
Four hundred and twenty two women were smokers
(39.2%, 5 missing). Smoking increased the risk of infection (OR = 2.16, 95% CI, 1.62-2.88).
Women reporting an occasional use of condoms
(28.6%) had a similar risk to those who never used them
(24.6%) (OR = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.64-1.34), whereas an
increasing protection was observed for women who used
condoms most of the time (23.0%) (OR = 0.67 95% CI, 0

4.4-1.00) or always (22.3%) (OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.330.77).
No previous pregnancies showed a protective effect
(OR = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.36 -0.99) as did not reporting previous genital disease (OR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.4-0.8). No partner's genital disease showed a not statistically significant
protective effect (OR = 0.73, 95%CI, 0.4-1.3). A lower
level of education was associated with a not statistically
significant increased risk of infection.
Multivariate analysis

Table 4 shows the results of the multivariate analysis,
which included all the statistically significant variables
(plus age) of the univariate model. In this analysis, the
effects of the number of sexual partners in the last three
years and the lifetime number of partner's partners both
remained statistically significant. In comparison with
women reporting a partner who had had only one lifetime partner (the study participant) there was more than
a three-fold increase in risk for those whose partner had
between 2 and 4 lifetime partners (OR = 3.2, 95% CI,
1.60-6.43). The increase was more than five-fold when
the women's partner had 5 or more lifetime partners (OR
= 5.45, 95% CI, 2.62-11.33). In comparison with nonsmokers, women smoking more than ten cigarettes per
day had twice the risk of infection (OR = 2.22, 95% CI,
1.25-3.93).
After adjustment of the other covariates condom use,
no prior pregnancies, no previous genital disease and

greater age at first intercourse showed a very small and
not statistically significant protection.

Discussion and Conclusions
This paper reports the baseline results at enrolment for
an on-going study.
The compliance to the invitation (15%) was low in comparison with the compliance to invitations for the cervical
screening programs for women aged 25 - 64 years in the
same area (approximately 40%). It was particularly low for
women aged 18 and 19 years.The difference may be due,
in part, to the lower age of the study population and their
being unaccustomed to gynaecological examination, and
in part, to the test offered (the HPV test) which was still
little known in Italy when the study began. However, the
participation rate is very similar to that obtained in similar studies conducted in Italy [8].
Nevertheless, the participating women do not seem to
differ from the general population in terms of age at first
intercourse and the number of partners. In fact these
characteristics were similar to those found in other Italian
surveys. Ammatuna et al. in a study of 1000 Sicilian
women reported a mean age of 21.6, a mean age of first
sexual intercourse of 17.4, and mean number of lifetime
partners of 2.22 [8].
Our baseline result that almost 30% of sexually active
women aged 18 - 24 years were infected by HPV is comparable with the range (19.7% - 39%) reported worldwide
for women in the same age group [13,14]. Infection with
oncogenic HPV types was found in almost 20% of our

sample (19.32%). This prevalence was higher than that
found in NTCC studies in women aged 25 - 29 (14.25%),
confirming that the prevalence of infection is higher in
younger women [18-24] and tends to decrease with age
[6,7,15].
Cervical infection with multiple HPV types was relatively common among Italian cohort participants,
[16,17]. Goodman et al assessed that the risk of acquiring
some HPV HR types was enhanced among women with
coexisting cervical HPV infections [18]. Other investigators who have examined the dynamics of cervical HPV
infection in the presence of other types reported that the
concurrent acquisition of multiple HPV types exceeded
that expected by chance [19,20] although only Mendez et
al found that type specific HPV acquisition was dependent on a cervical infection with another type. Rousseau
et al [21] found that HPV acquisition was more likely
among women with another HPV type at study entry and

that certain co-infections (e.g. HPV 16 and 52) occurred
with a significant frequency. These observations suggest
common exposures and common routes of transmission,
although alternative explanations, such as biological
interaction between various HPV types, cannot be
excluded [20].
HPV 16 (8.53%) and HPV 18 (1.88%) were present in
10.41% of the study sample. This prevalence of vaccine
types would suggest that the young population being
studied, especially the 18 & 19 year-olds, is an appropriate target for the prophylactic vaccination. Amongst 18
year-olds the prevalence of HPV 16 was 1.94% (4/206)
and of HPV 18 was 0% (0/206), whereas amongst 19 yearolds the prevalence of HPV 16 was 2.43% (5/206) and of
HPV 18 was 0.97% (2/206).
Our baseline results confirm the roles of the number of
sexual partners (in particularly in the last 3 years) and of
the lifetime number of partner's partners [22] as determi-

nants of HPV infection. Both these variables act as independent risk factors in the multivariate model. In fact, in
comparison with women reporting one partner, the risk
of infection increased more than 6 times and more than 5
times for women reporting to have had more than 5 partners and for those reporting a current partner having had
more than 5 lifetime partners, respectively. These figures
are consistent with all types of HPV infection as well as
for HPV HR infection (data not shown). This finding is
congruent with previous studies [23-25] in which the
prevalence of HPV among women who had had two or
more sexual partners was double that in women who had
had only one partner.

At baseline smoking habits act as an independent factor
of increased acquisition of HPV infections in both the
univariate or multivariate models. This association has
been observed in the pooled analysis of the International
Agency for Research on smoking and human papillomavirus infection where the risk of being HPV positive
increased with smoking intensity, after allowing for lifetime number of sexual partners [26].
The use of condoms has an slight protective effect in
the univariate analysis, but is not statistically significant
in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that use of condoms is associated to low risk sexual behaviours. In fact,
our data shows that women who said they frequently use

condoms, also indicated that they have had a low number
of sexual partners.
This point is heavily debated and has important consequences. Many previous papers, in which a retrospective
approach has been adopted (as in this study) [14,27-31],
have shown similar effects. Winer et al. [22] in a recent
paper, carried out in a cohort of young women at their
first intercourse demonstrated that consistent condom
use reduces the risk of cervical HPV infection. It is worth

noting that Winer's study is based on one year of observation whereas in our study, on average at baseline, 4.5
years had passed since the sexual debut.
At least two different explanations might account for
these conflicting figures:
a) Information bias: information collected retrospectively could determine a misclassification bias. If this
were the case, the relationship between condom use
and HPV would move towards the null value.
b) The probability of developing HPV infection
depends on from the time passed since the first intercourse and as protection is not absolute for condom
users, in the long term, they also could be become
infected. In particular it is worth mentioning that, as
time passes, HPV infection tends to spread to areas
not protected by condoms and HPV infections can
still be transmitted through non-penetrative sexual
contact or contact with areas of unprotected genital
skin.
This study design will permit a prospective analysis, in
a relatively short interval, of the role of different risk factors (i.e. sexual behaviour, smoking habits, condom use
and so on) in the acquisition of new HPV infections (or
with a different HPV type) for women negative at baseline. Furthermore, it might permit an evaluation of the
role of these risk factors in the clearance of infections for
women positive at baseline.
In the follow-up of this study we will analyze data from
the yearly self-administered questionnaires regarding
only the year to date. In this manner we aim to reduce
reporting biases related to the large interval since the
beginning of sexual activity and also with a temporal
sequence of its progress.
